5212501,5,B0090SI3EI,"Fantastic movie, easily my favorite of all the Avengers tie-in sequels. Loads of action, but still with a sense of humor. Lots of twists as well. Some of them you will see coming if you're a comic fan, but many others will still surprise you. old school comic feel, but with a contemporary message. In particular I enjoyed the Winter Soldier. Think Anton Chigurn meets the Terminator. It's about time we have an awesome recurring villain besides Loki.",1383004800,20,451,4.794871794871795

5212561,5,B0090SI3EI,Captain America the winter soldier was in my opinion an awesome movie! I liked it even more than the first avenger. Why?Well firstly because the Captain and all of the characters were portrayed really cool in this movie. The fight scenes were much more intense and awesome in my opinion.

5212620,5,B0090SI3EI,"As of A3:IW, still my favorite Marvel.  Maybe my favorite superhero movie.

Cap has to develop nuance: the world is not black & white.  He maintains his purity and moral courage in the face of difficult morality.

Meanwhile it makes you think about current events: government monitoring, robotic combat, trusting the government intelligence apparatus, and so on.

Also, just a great twist.  And good tension.

Johansson, Jackson, Redford, and Evans give great performances.  Stan, meh.",1527033600,,485,5.373333333333333

They really crank up Captain America a notch in this film. He is now firmly in current day and back in the swing of things. And it shows as he is just a force in this movie. And gets a villain of his equal in his former pal Bucky as Winter Soldier.

You also get great supporting roles from Black Widow and Falcon.",1526688000,,437,4.011494252873563

Sold my tens of thousands of books. But got excited when they started with the movies, beginning with X-Men, then Tobey Maguire Spider-Man. Then it really took off upon formation of the MCU and bringing many superheroes together. Hope they bring X-Men and FF into the mix. Got me all enthused about Marvel again. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is my favorite Marvel film to date. I've watched it multiple times and it's just as exciting and breathtaking with each viewing.",1526342400,,627,4.814814814814815

5212695,4,B0090SI3EI,These posters on Amazon are odd not sure that I care for them that much. This is probably one of the best and still the best MCU movies. It somehow elevates itself beyond just the pure but forgettable entertainment and a lot of these MCU titles are. I had a chance to read the graphic novel years after seeing the movie and they do a very faithful adaptation of the story which very much feels more like good guy fighting villain of the week.

5212778,5,B0090SI3EI,"Wonderful.  Grittier, darker, more compelling than ever.  We last saw him in Captain America, the First Avenger, heroically crashing his plane into the sea.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier picks up his story about 2 years after he awakens from his 70 year long hibernation.  While working closely with  Natasha Romanoff,  aka Black Widow, for STRIKE, Captain America learns about a plot involving three helicarriers that are killing important individuals around the world.  Sam Wilson, aka Falcon, makes an appearance in this movie, which is great to see.  One of the fun aspects of Marvel is that characters never seem to really die.  Evil Doctor Zola makes an appearance as does Bucky, Chris Rogers' best friend from childhood.  The best part about Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the relationship between Rogers and Bucky- it's touching to watch them remember their friendship motto through thick and thin, as friends and as enemies.  I believe the reason Marvel movies are so successful is that they always champion the Good, the Noble, the Humble and the Servant.  It's never easy to achieve any of those traits in these movies, but it is always worth it.  The makers of these Marvel movies combine deeply emotional relationships within an exciting plot and add mind blowing special effects to bring pure magic to the screen.  I was blown away by this family friendly, awesome movie!",1521504000,3,1400,5.030434782608696

It's undoubtedly one of the best films within the Marvel Universe along with Iron Man, but the amazing thing about Winter Soldier is that even if it wasn't a superhero movie, it will still be a really amazing movie, and one of the best action-spy-thrillers of all time. The amazing thing about Captain America is that all its films besides the Winter Soldier are amazing in their own right; the same cannot be said with all of the other superhero movies within the Marvel Universe. The story was interesting (brings you closer), and though it's called the ""Winter Soldier"", that character didn't really get much of a screen time. Unlike most of the other films within the Marvel Universe, Winter Soldier is one of those films you would see AGAIN & AGAIN!!! it was entertaining. The movie looked serious too.

5213355,5,B0090SI3EI,"This is the second movie about Captain America and of all the Marvel moves that have come out in the past ten plus years it is one of their best. I have been a marvel comics fan for many years and honestly didn't read very much about Captain America beyond what he did in the few Avengers comics I picked up, he always felt a bit to boy scout-ish for me. The first movie, the origin movie, was good but felt a bit long and by the time he was getting more interesting he froze. This movie however showed a side to him that was unexpected, how he would react to a change in a lawful system that he is part of and in some ways a founder of and how he would react is doing the good thing even if it wasn't quite part of the established rules.
Always a character that was not so much super powered but peak of human athletics didn't shine is comics next to characters like Hulk, Thor and Spiderman. In this movie however he really was showcased in a way that showed him being the Super Soldier that they have always sold him as. Fighting groups of combatants, even high speed chases and the scene with the harrier jet were awesome and seeing it in the theater got some cheers. The nerdy side of me kept thinking that he must be good at geometry as well since the shield always bounces back to him. Though speaking of the shield there were some other really cool things done with that as well.
The story was good, bit of a mystery thriller and all the characters involved did a good job of portraying the character from the comics or at least the previous movies we know them from.
If you are not a big comic movie fan but you want to see what everyone else is raving about this is a good one to see.",1493683200,,1694,4.136363636363637

5213363,2,B0090SI3EI,"These 5-star reviewers work for Marvel. There's no way this is 5-stars.

Plotish: Captain meets this guy while running in Washington DC who just happens to be a veteran (who ends up being Falcon). Then Black Widow has some thing for Captain, but they leave things weird because they don't want to mess with the Agent Carter thing - who happens to have Alzheimer's (or something in that spectrum). They do kiss, which doesn't help the awkwardality of their relationship. SHIELD is compromised - it's actually Hydra who want to kill people they don't like based on Dr Zika's algorithm and flying gunships. Captain America's shield is a boomerang and somehow defies every law of physics known to man. Fury becomes Jedi Master Mace Windu and uses a light saber to evade the Winter Soldier - kinda. Their museum has no security. Agent Hill arrives in the movie at the right time to save Cap and gang because Hydra doesn't have background checks or roll call or conversations that would reveal her to be Agent Hill (who's awesome by the way).

The worst part of this movie is the acting. No amount of acting from Samuel L Jackson or Robert Redford could save this film. There are times in this movie where you feel like the Winter Soldier and your mind is being wiped (or you want it to be).",1492732800,,1285,4.582608695652174

To me this is the best of all the superhero flicks I have seen - important messages about individual freedom and our role in preserving privacy in this information era.  Robert Redford has a fabulous role as the bad guy we have all dreamed about - the insider with an agenda to sell us all out to Hydra = supreme globalist actors.  The film manages to let us make emotional connections with characters like Rogers, Fury, Natasha etc. while simultaneously taking us on a purely escapist adventure.  The nod to Jenny Agutter of ""Logans Run"" is just icing on the cake. Prime quote - Capn America to Nick Fury after hearing his explanation of the role of the helicarriers  - ""this isn't freedom, this is fear""  Absolutely the best of its kind!",1492473600,,908,4.4787878787878785

As he struggles to sort out his place in the midst of this messy world he must also figure out who his friends really are, and how much friendship costs, while dealing with people trying to kill him as they carry out their plans to disrupt civilization.  It is what I'd like to call a thinking person's action movie.

I'm used to Marvel movies having some fun with themselves but this was 2 plus hours of seriousness and stoicism. Also, unlike the first film, Captain America and his leading lady (Scarlett Johansson) had absolutely no chemistry together. Now if you prefer films with constant car chases, people shooting at other people, multiple explosions, destruction of public and private property, and macho man brawling, then this is the movie for you.

5214088,5,B0090SI3EI,"As far as comparisons go, I'd say this is on par with dropping your favorite mug and watching as it falls in slow-motion. Maybe you scream, maybe you're crying from the moment the cup leaves your hands, but the point of the matter is that your heart stops for a good 3 seconds until it shatters on the tile floor. Your coffee is all over your socks, there's ceramic every which way, and your dog is nosing the handle all the way under the fridge. You're in mourning and things only go downhill from here.

So watching this movie was a little like that. Steve ""No Sense of Self-Preservation"" Rogers is learning who he is in the 21st century, and who he is now that nobody remembers the man that he was. He flirts with the cute guy he sees running every morning on the national mall. You're lovingly pouring coffee into your coffee cup and there are birds singing outside. The sun is shining through your kitchen window and you are at peace.

You turn away from the kitchen counter. Maybe you have toast in the toaster, the point of the matter is that you're basking in the tranquility of the morning and Steve's shirt is soft and too tight for him but he's learning and he's Trying His Best. We find out that Natasha uses emoticons when she texts. I bet she uses the praise hands emoji with wild abandon. You feel warm.

And then something shifts. Maybe you take a step away from the counter and you aren't gripping your mug as tightly as you need to. Maybe a bird flies into your window because you cleaned it yesterday and it can't tell that there's glass there. Maybe you're just clumsy. Suddenly Nick Fury's dead and Captain America is chasing a Myspace-era scene kid across the rooftops of DC. There's a metal arm and a lot of screeching. The coffee cup slips from your grasp.

You watch in horror as things spiral out of control. Suddenly the Myspace scene kid is Steve's childhood pal, his best friend, the guy he thought he lost before he went into the ice. As they gaze tragically at one another-- because Steve and Bucky are only capable of tragedy-- Steve comes to the realization that this isn't the Bucky he knew back in WW II. Steve is experiencing a whole new level of mourning and your coffee cup makes first contact with the tile floor. It's a disaster and your toast just popped up.

As you try unsuccessfully to get your dog away from the mess so you can pick up the little ceramic shards and clean up the ruins of your good morning, you are gripped by the sudden desire to laugh. Steve is not laughing, mostly because Bucky is beating him half to death on a floating ship. There is still a lot of intense eye contact. Steve delivers a line that will destroy me for years to come. Your laughter has a hysterical edge to it.

And then just as soon as it happened, it's over. Your heartbeat slows, the coffee soaks into the millions of paper towels you've scattered all over your floor. Steve wakes up in a hospital (where we assume the cute guy from the national mall asks him out for coffee). The music swells and Bucky steps out of the shadows of the Smithsonian and as you take a breath in your kitchen you accept that the only thing you can do from here is rebuild.",1481155200,2,3186,4.3733108108108105

They want to show us that they're doing something in this movie because such and such happened in the first - Remember??  Now, I'm curious about who wrote or directed #1 and this one?

The plot also shows that Cap now lives in an era where good and evil are no longer as easily identified as they were when he first came on the scene.

5214634,2,B0090SI3EI,"The best way to summarize our experience with this movie is ""overly action packed"". Not that it had lots of different action sequences, or the action was interesting, but it was super redundant - the same childish action fighting over and over. It was so much action that after a short while it became annoyingly numbing and diluted the good parts of what could have been a great movie.

There was really good dialogue, story, and acting across the entire cast to interest us however, but lost in the incessant distraction of all the cookie cutter overflowing action. They made a movie to appeal to both intellect and extreme childish comic figure action- just way too much childish action. When the acting is very good as it was in this movie, you just don't expect it to be ""ruined"" by too much ridiculous action. But that is how to sell movies across all age groups, even though without all the repetitive boring action I would have really enjoyed this movie and given it at least four stars.",1474243200,,995,4.621468926553672

Full disclosure: I was never one for the Marvel universe (I'm more of a DC person) but it got such a high score on Rotten Tomatoes I decided to give it ago. If all you're after is lots of gunplay, large-scale explosions and special effects, this movie may be for you. If you're looking for an interesting story with a cohesive narrative arc, compelling character development and decent acting, I suggest you look elsewhere. I struggled to stay awake in the few scenes the movie required exposition but there is really nothing in this film that you would miss if you watched it on mute.

Overall, there is nothing noteworthy enough about this film to justify its 112 minute run-time or the slew of sequels to follow.",1471046400,2,749,4.548148148148148

5215083,4,B0090SI3EI,"More of a political thriller than a superhero movie, but it was done pretty well. The action scenes were awesome. The story and the twist were kind of predictable. The only thing that really caught me off guard is the group that all the bad guys were a part of and even then it was more annoying that said group was part of the story.

But also, the ""good guy being pursued by his own agency"" story in hollywood is getting tiresome, to me at least.
You got to see Nick Fury in action for once which was bad ass.

The Russo brothers directed this so there was a Community cameo which was cool. The mid credits scene was cool and lame. Cool because it setup a cross between the Fox Marvel universe which was surprising and lame because ... well, am I the only one tired of bad guys basing their baddery around found Asgard tech?

All in all, this movie was pretty cool. If you watched any of the trailers, you can pretty much figure out all of the main plot points and twists including who dies and who the real bad guy is. They give too much away in trailers these days",1470960000,,1068,4.2

5215866,5,B0090SI3EI,"Trust no one. Those three short words set the tone for the latest Marvel Cinematic feature, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, along with the executive producing team, should be complimented for crafting such a high-stakes, cold-war political thriller. Winter Soldier is not just a superhero film, its a game changer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, upending the status quo that fans really won't see coming. Just like Iron Man 3, risk taking is the new name of the game in the successful Marvel movie franchise that just continues to stay fresh and original with each endeavor.

Without giving too much away, Winter Soldier basically takes place after the Avengers, with Cap settling into his role as a soldier for S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury explains the world is not what it seems, and for a time, neither is the movie with the amount of smoke and mirrors and twists and turns the plot takes. The story is never predictable, and there are more than a few surprises awaiting fans, none more than the Winter Soldier.

Speaking of the Winter Soldier, kudos to the fight choreographers and stunt coordinators as the fight scenes, including multiple hand-to-hand moments between Winter Soldier and Cap, come at such a frenetic pace that if you blink you will definitely miss something. Those scenes are not just limited to that duo, as Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow once again provides some impressive fighting moments as well.

Beside the addition of the Winter Soldier, the film also features the debut of Alexander Pierce, a high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. member, and Sam Wilson, aka The Falcon, played by Robert Redford and Howard Mackie, respectively. Both actors slip into their roles so easily that the duo seems like they have been a part of these pictures since the beginning. Redford had a lot to do in this film, and did not disappoint, meanwhile Mackies and Chris Evans chemistry as a team is undeniable, as viewers can easily see the bond that develops between the two characters.

Winter Soldier at times is an action thriller and political drama, however at its heart the story is about character, the continuation of Steve Rogers understanding of this new world he has joined. There are a ton of cameos and special moments from the first film that contrast the world where Rogers came from and the world he is living now. Evans casting of Rogers continues to demonstrate to viewers that Marvel and its team really know what it is doing when selecting actors for these roles. Evans truly is the embodiment of Captain America.

It truly is an amazing piece of storytelling as this film opens new doors, while closing others and in the process upending the foundation of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Winter Soldier will have lasting repercussions in the upcoming films as well as the final episodes of the first season of Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (which is titled Uprising; in fact after watching the movie, viewers will understand whats behind some of the issues and mysteries that has occurred in recent previous episodes of the show).

No review of a Marvel film would be complete without mention of the post-credit scenes, including an Avengers: Age of Ultron setup.

Much like last summers The Wolverine, Captain America: The Winter Soldier cannot be labeled as a superhero film; its much more than that. Winter Soldier is a new breed of hero movies, in which the characters are everyday people with everyday problems, it just so happens that they also have superhuman abilities. Fans will not have had to see any of the previous Marvel films to appreciate this movie, although they will enjoy the little moments a lot more if they had.",1467676800,,3695,4.930868167202572

5217168,4,B0090SI3EI,"I was extremely disappointed by ""Captain America : The First Avenger"". Despite awesome looking trailers and a promising villain, the film fell flat at about the halfway point. I was disgusted by the cap's ""modern"" outfit - resembling some sort of Walmart Halloween costume - the ridiculous Redskull, and just about everything else. The cap's role in ""The Avengers"" didn't do much to change my opinion of the hero - actually, it changed it completely, but for the worse - he was a  self-righteous hypocrite who was bossy, annoying, and needed to shop for his clothes at Target.

Then came the Winter Soldier.

After the events in ""The Avengers"", we find Steve Rogers/Captain America working alongside S.H.I.E.L.D. to defend the U.S. However, in the course of the film, Steve comes to realize that the government may have been infiltrated by the enemy.... and an old face returns to haunt him. Now branded as a fugitive, the cap, along with the Black Widow and newcomer Falcon, must defeat the mysterious assassin the Winter Soldier, fight the traitors within the nation... and save the world as we know it.

This film is very cool, and much better then the first one. Steve Roger's character is far more likable, and now I can cheer him on as he battles the bad guys instead of yelling, ""Boo! Wardrobe Malfunction! Boo!""

PROS  - 1 The Cap. As mentioned above, Steve is more of the honest, to good to be true war hero he was meant to be. His outfit, while still slightly, ""ugh"", has been upgraded. I look forward to ""Civil War"", knowing that the directors will probably stay true to their take on the WW 2 veteran.

2 Cool moves - Yes, the lack of reality behind the fight scenes can make you groan, but there are many note worthy ""fisticuffs"" parts which I loved - Cap vs Batrock, old S.H.I.E.L.D. council woman vs bad guys, Black widow giving Winter Soldier the slip.

3 Falcon. Great addition to the Marvel Universe. Winged superheroes are cool.

4 Patriotism - I was surprised by the amount of bravery and patriotism  exhibited by  the good guys in this movie. The speech the cap delivers in the climax of the film is a great achievement.

CONS - 1 Winter Soldier. Dumb. Cool villain in concept, but the act falls apart as soon as mask comes off. The Avengers franchise has done very poorly with their villains.

2 Bullets. I have never watched a movie with the fear of getting shot. Where do all these bullets come from?!

3 WHY IS THE BLACK WIDOW FLIRTING WITH STEVE?! What happened to Natasha's ""Love is for children?"" The Black Widow was cool in the film, but her continual inconsistency of character - and multiple hairstyles - will make your head spin.

4 S.H.I.E.L.D. I can't spoil the plot, but...what? That is so LAME. Are we seriously supposed to believe that - well, you'll find out when you watch the film. Utterly ridiculous and unlikely.
This was a much better film than ""The First Avenger."" If you have to choose between the two, it's a no-brainer.",1464912000,2,2966,4.633587786259542

5217309,5,B0090SI3EI,"My favorite of all the Marvel Comic movies. Like many other reviewers, I thought the action sequences were great. The hand-to-hand combat reminded me of the Jason Bourne movies. But this is not just another action movie. It is also a political thriller with many layers to the story. Being a fan of Robert Redford, I couldn't help but remember a line from Sneakers, ""you won't know who to trust.""

The Cap is by far my favorite Avenger. His story in The First Avenger is always in my mind when watching him in other Marvel movies. Bucky said he would follow that kid from Brooklyn who didn't know how to run from a fight. That's what makes the Cap special.  The friendship between Steve and Bucky is touching, and gives more dimension to each character.

Finally, Natasha is very entertaining, and her toughness is a nice contrast to Steve's more old-fashioned all-American side. She clearly has a lot of vulnerabilities, which the Cap sees as well.. Those two have a lot of on-screen chemistry. I will keep hoping that they get together as more than friends at some point.",1464739200,,1073,4.666666666666667

Chris Evans plays a believable character in Captain America.  He makes the movie work and makes the character three dimensional.  His ability to ""think on his feet"" as well as still be somewhat taken aback by 21st Century life has him feeling as though he's a real person displaced from his time and life.

SPOILER BELOW:

In The Winter Soldier, his lifelong pal, Bucky becomes his nemesis.  Was this a shock to anybody?  I think so.  Yes, if you think back you can see it.  Could you possibly guess it?  Certainly.  Was it likely?  I _don't_ think so.  In doing so, The Winter Soldier is the perfect foil to The Captain.  Who would know Steve Rogers best?  Bucky Barnes is certainly the answer.

I'm not a huge diehard fan of any comics (yes, I'm old enough to NOT have to call them Graphic Novels).  However, I appreciate a good movie and one who has some history.  This movie definitely worked for me and I've seen it several times.  I'll probably see it a few more times in the future.  I like Evans acting, especially that as Johnny Storm in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantastic-Four/dp/B009EEP8P0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantastic Four</a>&nbsp;(the 2005 version).

Incredibly sexy and is a great actress to boot. I love the different direction they took with Winter Soldier making it much more edgy and intense than the previous Avengers movies.

There are WHAT? moments all over the place, but if you suspend your disbelief here and there with discretion, this will be the best Marvel movie made thus far.",1463616000,,480,4.690476190476191

5219645,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America's my favorite superhero, and while I really enjoyed his first two outings in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (First Avenger and The Avengers), I consistently heard people rag on the Cap. He's boring, he's old-fashioned, he's not very strong... It was understandable, but it made me seem like an outlier in my appreciation for movie Cap. I'm grateful this movie came along to help change a few people's minds. The movie blends action, drama, and humor incredibly (and surprisingly) well. The Russo Brothers are skilled in their direction (both in the loud and quiet moments), and the script is really solid, especially for a superhero movie. The movie deftly pulls off the 1970s-style Conspiracy Thriller it's going for, and it makes for a gripping story as Cap and Black Widow run from the law and figure out what's actually going on. The acting is superb, with Chris Evans giving his best performance as the character so far. Special shout-out to Robert Redford, who has a fantastic turn as Alexander Pierce. All in all, this is one of my favorite films of all time, and my favorite MCU film (though Civil War is now challenging that!).

The story was a little rushed in places, and there were a couple scenes that seemed hammy (like when the guy with the vulcan gun is shooting at Cap's shield only and ignoring his fully exposed head and legs).

5220221,3,B0090SI3EI,"I saw this in 2015 and was not exactly thrilled with it the first time as it was hard to track regarding certain characters and felt like this is a Captain America movie not a Avengers story but I was even less thrilled a year later when ... a yr later when another Captain America was released because I remembered it ended with a cliff hanger so on the opening Mothers Day weekend May 6, 2016 (5/6/2016) at the Cinneapolos theater in Thousand Oaks, California (about 1/2 hour or so from Hollywood itself) I was in for a shock as this wasn't Civil War the third Captain America movie this was Winters Soldier the same exact movie I had paid for and seen last yr (and bought and have somewhere) it took 2 minutes to realize it wasn't even a flashback or a look back at it was the same ... I kept looking around the packed theater to see if anyone felt the same way but no one seemed to notice and at $20 a ticket in 3D (which was not worth it as it didn't even feel like a 3D movie does) now I know why ... Captian America: Civil War is Captain America: Winters Soldier they are the exact same movie and u can go by Winters Soldier any where movies are sold which makes the 3D version the one that comes with the set when u buy it and not made for theater it also explains why I kept hearing random sounds that didn't belong like talking or laughing but it wasn't from the audience it was from the THX or Dolby surround sound.... What exactly are they trying to pull b/c now I have paid for and saw the same movie in the theater 2x and feel even more made a fool out of when they pulled 50!shades of Grey with Matther Bomer days before it released ... How can they get away with this and how can no one remember it at all (I mean their is serial boxes, gum packs everything pumping this movie).",1463011200,39,1794,4.113960113960114

5220508,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: The winter solider is one of the few sequels that I feel manage to perform at the same level as the previous movie. Chris Evans is an immaculate actor in this role, really bringing the role into the realm of reality (Maybe not the whole science experiment, but his unwavering patriotism and moral values). His acting really convinces an audience of his authenticity in character. Samual Jackson and Robert Redford also enhance the movie with whit while increasing the depth of Nick Furys character. I like Scarlet Johanson, but I liked her character a little more in the first avengers. She still provides a good performance, but I felt a few of the scenes with her didn't align with some of the characteristics of her overall character. Anthony Mackie also provides a great falcon, and is a perfect addition to these movies.
The movie provides a nice combination of action to comedy while still providing enough of a story line to keep it interesting. All in all definitely one of my favorites, even after seeing it a few times.",1462838400,,1046,4.7845303867403315

5220837,5,B0090SI3EI,"What can you say about Marvel films that hasn't been said already? When Marvel started making movies, with the exception of Batman, I hated superheroes, I hated everything about them. I had written them off as the lowest, cheapest form of  science fiction, and the first few Marvel films did little to prove me wrong, but then they started getting better, and arguably the best films in the franchise, or at least my favorites have been the Captain America films. Chris Evans is just terrific, he has this innocent naivet about him surrounded in a childlike wonderment, but when the time comes, he can still kick some ass and even crack a joke, Evans just fits the role like a glove. There's not much point summarizing the story, because if you're not into the whole Marvel scene, you're probably not going to understand or see this film anyway, and that's a shame, because from a visual stand point alone, The Winter Soldier rivals anything Marvel has put out to date. On that note, the one draw back to this film is there is a lot of Avenger story line involved. This is supposed to be a stand alone film, fans of the series loved it and rightfully so, but what about the people who just like the character and aren't into the whole genre? All the other Avenger/Shield/Hydra stuff and other characters from other series could make the story for them more than somewhat confusing. In watching this film, you almost have to have some kind of background knowledge of the characters involvement in other films in order to be in the know and that doesn't sit right with people, particularly kids, who just want to see Captain America. For the fans, however it doesn't get much better than this, it's slightly longer and rougher around the edges than The First Avenger, but it is still a great film, and a must see for anyone is trying to keep with the Marvel franchise.",1462752000,,1866,4.603603603603603

5221193,5,B0090SI3EI,"CAPTAIN AMERICA
THE WINTER SOLDIER

I loved the first Captain America movie, in fact in may have been the best film in the first phase from the solo films. The first film as a great adventure film that also had action, a true adaptation of the original Cap stories. So I was super excited for this film when it finally came out. After we went and saw it I left thinking that they had did it again, the Cap movie was probably the best solo film in the phase two series. The only difference this time was that it was more of an action/adventure film instead of the other way around, perfect.

Cap is adjusting to his life in this new world and getting along as expected. That all changes when a plot to compromise S.H.E.I.L.D. happens and Cap has to deal with a figure known as The Winter Soldier. Who is behind all of this and who is the soldier, the answer may be too much for even Cap to take.

This was and even still may be the best Marvel movie out there not about a team [The Avengers, The Guardians of the Galaxy]. Certainly the best from the solo films as of now in my opinion [seeing the third Cap flick this weekend as of this writing]. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo did an excellent job with this film and I am happy that they also directed the newly released third Cap flick Civil War as well as the upcoming Avengers two part epic, Infinity War. Credit of course also needs to go to writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who have given us the first Cap film as well as the third and the upcoming Avengers films. Of note they also wrote the second Thor film and of course the Agent Carter TV series.

This was a wonderfully fun but also smart film and a great addition to any film or comic fan collection. The performances only add to that statement of course with everyone doing an excellent job and I loved the addition of not only The Winter Soldier but of Falcon as well, great additions to the MCU. The Blu-Ray comes with some excellent special features including all kinds of behind the scenes features deleted scenes, gag reel and of course the best thing, the commentary with all four creators, the directors and writers. Highly recommended, highly.",1462492800,,2179,4.399503722084368

It's just a solid movie, I really enjoyed it.

I unwrapped it, and placed it in my machine, ready to (finally) enjoy the movie. The movie went up to chapter 9 and then froze. There are NO scratches on the disk, and as I said, I only now unwrapped it. I was REALLY into the movie, and so I unplugged my machine, then I rebooted - I then put a different movie in to make sure it was still able to play movies--- nope. It still freezes on Chp 9 and then skips to Chp 14. As i said, I am sure the seller would have replaced it had I watched it when i ordered this item -- but I rarely get time to watch movies (i have 2 young kids and my commute sucks which burns up most of my day), so it only adds to my disappointment when the movie jams.

5221884,5,B0090SI3EI,"Admittedly, I've been a dyed-in-the-wool Captain America fan for over half of a century, so I'm not the most objective person on the subject, but Captain America: The Winter Soldier has my vote for the best entry in the current run of Avengers (team AND individual members) movies from Marvel. The plot was intricate and engaging, and the action was compelling and unrelenting, The viewer learned so much about the nature of SHIELD in the MCU that I almost felt as if I were watching a Nick Fury movie that happened also to have Cap in it. That's not a criticism, though; it added to my enjoyment. (They should really consider making a stand-alone Nick Fury/Black Widow movie in the near future.)  The movie necessarily covers aspects of Cap's career from WWII to the present, revealing even more about his and Bucky's characters. As with other Marvel movies, Winter Soldier also ties in nicely with the other Avengers' appearances, plus the television Agents of SHIELD series.
  If there's still ANYONE left on the planet who hasn't seen Captaim America: The Winter Soldier, I have to ask, what's wrong with you?",1461369600,,1113,4.847368421052631

5222185,4,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the second film in Marvels Captain America franchise, though it also features Black Widow AKA Natasha Romanoff and Falcon AKA paratrooper Sam Wilson. Still trying to catch up with the times, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) becomes friendly with Sam Wilson, a fellow veteran whom he meets while working at SHIELD headquarters in Washington, DC. When Rogers learns that Agent Romanoffs (Scarlett Johansson) mission on a highjacked SHIELD ship conflicted with his own, Rogers feels betrayed and confronts Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who dismisses his concerns and tries to sell Rogers on Project Insight, which will position three heavily-armed helicarriers in the atmosphere to take out perceived security threats. After Fury is ambushed in the street, he advises Rogers that SHIELD is compromised and to trust no one.

The plot is convoluted, but the upshot is that the most honest Avenger, Captain America, teams up with the most duplicitous, Black Widow, to root out the real reason behind SHIELDs creeping security apparatus. In the tradition of taking on timely political themes, SHIELD, led by World Security Council Secretary Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), is creating an undeclared state of martial law that targets anyone who might be disrupt security, based solely on algorithmic inference. Unfortunately, the film cops out by making a long-dead Nazi the impetus behind this scheme rather than well-meaning politicians desperate for approval or self-serving defense contractors and government agencies hungry for cash. The big car chase in DC involves more guns than cars, and the final battle is big but hokey. Still, I would rate this better than an Avengers movie but not as good as Ironman.",1460678400,,1743,5.315217391304348

5222332,1,B0090SI3EI,"***Beyond disappointing!***
I am not a Marvel fan, at all, but I thought the first Captain America movie was a five-star winner.  Was looking forward to this sequel, but the body count in this one, Winter Soldier, is through the roof.  So much gratuitous violence that it got old; I found myself wondering when it would end.  It would have been boring, except that it was people dying (and many of them innocent bystanders).  I can't think of a way someone could die that wasn't showcased in the first twenty minutes.
And the slam-slash-crunch-crash-clobber took up most of the time that a plot would have normally occupied,  Captain America himself morphed from strong virtuous superhero into a whiny sensitive type whimpering about how he just doesn't know if he can do this. The tiny nugget of story line was never developed (though maybe it could have been),  Robert Redford was wooden as the bad guy, or one of them - the whole movie was full of crummy characters.
I think that possibly the writers depended too much on viewers being diehard Marvel comics fans who would know the backstory, love the comic book violence, and embrace anything that said ""Captain America."".  Whatever; this movie was, as my husband put it, ""The worst movie we've watched in years.""",1458864000,,1267,4.811059907834101
5222333,5,B0090SI3EI,"I think this is one of the very best of the Marvel movies and it shows. I give it high marks for action sequences and acting all around.
Hydra has infiltrated SHIELD to a point that they come after Captain America and it's ""faithful"" members with ""explosive"" consequences. Captain Rogers discovers that the ""Winter Soldier"" is that of his friend ""Bucky Barnes"" thought to have died years ago.
He tries in all honesty to bring his friend back all the while trying to fend off Hydra within SHIELD with the help of Black Widow and Falcon.
Robert Redford stars as the main bad guy in charge and employs ""The Winter Soldier"" to take out Captain America and his hero friends.
Nick Fury is believed dead by quite a few after getting shot, but is known to be alive by a select few toward the end of the movie. Well done Marvel!!

I think it gave him more character development, and really showed him interacting with characters we loved from previous movies, and new characters, on a level we hadn't seen before. The plot was great and exciting, and the humor, when it was there, was good. The action, though, that's where this movie really knocked it out of the park. Whoever choreographed the fight scenes deserves a raise.

There aren't many standalone MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) films out there..but this the exception. The only other super hero movie that is the very best of the best standalone is DC's The Dark Knight. I would even go as far as to say that this is as good as The Dark Knight.
From the very beginning of the movie you feel the different direction. ***Minor Spoilers*** The movie start off with a very small intro of about 5 minutes. But then it just gets straight to the action...and ..boy..That is what I called action!
Then the movie starts introducing the audience with the plot little by little without making it cliche.
The soundtrack of the entire movie, which is by Henry Jackman, is very good and it fits the movie so well. I liked specially the ""villain"" theme. Every time the theme form the villain started, It even reminded me to the ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" theme song. jaja

5222625,4,B0090SI3EI,"SO much better than the first one. Two things, though. I can accept a lot from Comic Book movies, but seriously, human beings are not made of rubber bouncy balls. The non-superpowered people in this movie would come away from car crashes, being thrown from a moving vehicle, and severe beatings looking like they were sort of inconvenienced. It sucks all the tension out of a fight scene when people look like they are removed from physics or physical limitations. I had less of a problem with the bullet-train fight in ""The Wolverine"" than the scene were Falcon dives out of a moving vehicle, rolls along the ground at 45 miles per hour, and does not have a single scratch. At least the guys in ""The Wolverine"" were ninjas. Comic book ninjas. The Falcon? Ordinary guy with a neat set of wings. He can get hurt.

It was refreshing to see Captain America actually fight like Captain America and not just be kind of underwhelming during the action sequences. And seeing him injured or shot was a big plus because it brought back at least a small amount of the tension lost elsewhere. But again, STOP SHAKING THE CAMERA! I bet fight choreographers love that they spend hours and hours planning and the actors spend days, sometimes months, preparing for a fight scene just so someone can kick the camera like an epileptic donkey and the audience can't even tell what's going on. You could have them playing Monopoly and it would have looked almost the same. It would be nice if they let us SEE the action in this lovely ACTION MOVIE.  I will admit they calmed their shaky cam down quite a bit in some of the scenes.

Overall, though, good movie. And Sam Jackson is always fun. Except in Star Wars",1454457600,,1692,4.559210526315789

5222983,3,B0090SI3EI,"It's okay, the good: The fight scenes are beyond awesome. Cap gets to show off skill and power and skill with his power. The fight coordinators are top notch. Cap maybe seems a bit more 3-dimenential but I'm not sure that they went a good direction in all ways either.

 The bad: the plot was convoluted and felt a little contrived. The plot device of ""brainwashed best friend"" has been done. I think I was supposed to feel like I liked Winter Soldier, but he had zero personality due to the brainwashing, so there was nothing there to like. They could have shown more of ""him"" underneath the brainwashing but they fell down on the job there. The character was powerful and believable as long as you read between the lines a bit too.

 Black Widow was grand, not vulnerable because she was a woman, but it showed that she also was not a super soldier as far as her abilities. Instead she got to where she is by hard work and training. They hinted at her ruthless side but then chose to bury it with the softer more female generalization of her character, unfortunately. But she WAS her own character, instead of being shunted to the background unless the director wanted boobs in the scene, so major kudos to the writers. You used her well.

Falcon... complete sidekick. Sorry for the Behind the Scenes commentary who tried to say he wasn't. He came off as ""Whatever Cap says to do"" yesman sidekick. Pity. I'm sure the character could shine, if he was written better. I did like that he was willing to go just on Cap's word, but then they tried to force the idea that he wasn't a sidekick.

The plot carries itself, and its so well directed, it makes you wish these guys had done Age of Ultron instead of Joss! Quality acting all around, action and drama well balanced, with a good smidgen of humor pepper throughout.

If you DO think he's at least bisexual, this is the story about Captain America finding new love and then immediately being reintroduced to his brainwashed, thought to be dead, love of his life. Steve bromances it up with Nat, which is awesome. Is pretty flirty with Sam, which is adorable. Has tragic lingering looks and loud declaration with Bucky.

5223314,4,B0090SI3EI,"This is a solid piece of the Marvel film franchise. Definitely one of the better films following the solo adventures of an Avengers team member. I like the idea of the Captain America character in modern times. As the literal embodiment of U.S. patriotism, placed in a country growing increasingly self aware of it's own faults, an increasing shift in power from the many to the few, and an unsure position in an increasingly globalized society. There is so much to work with here!

Unfortunately the film does not delve too deep into the above subject matter, but it still manages to be entertaining and at least address some of Captain America's internal struggles. There is plenty of action and special effects to make it an over the top spectacle.",1440547200,,751,4.776923076923077

I like the behind the scenes information included, it is an excellent movie.  I felt it necessary to see before the sequel came out, as I missed that one in theaters.  This film would clearly have benefited from a bigger screen than mine. Still, it is a well paced and well acted action/adventure movie with interesting plot points, especially for comic fans.

My ""A"" level only contains four movies, Avengers 1, Iron Man 1, Guardians of the Galaxy, and, at the top of the list, this one. They are top of the list because they are the ones si could watch over and over and never get tired of them.

Sometimes A1 and this will switch places only because of how awesome it was to see everybody together. However, CA2 always slips back into first place because it is not just a great superhero film, it is just a great film, period.",1437782400,,522,4.107843137254902

The allies show vulnerability, courage, and cunning.  The story, where somewhat predictable, has enough turns to keep you guessing.

My two disappointments are: the Robert Redford character is too mechanical and did not development much depth.  More background, emotion, and devotion to the cause was needed.  And the second is the ending, which is a little short sided. Such a vulnerable point would be well guarded.

Overly long, violent to the point that even the heroes don't care about innocent bystanders, irrelevant side-stories. I thought I kept up with most Marvel movies but this one was annoying because it had characters without background stories to explain their superpowers and therefore I couldn't find them engaging.  There is absolutely no driving urgency in the plot.  There is just talking tableaux, then a huge fight sequence, then more talking.  I am a huge fan of a good fight, but this movie is full of impossible fight choreography making it hard to enter into even make-believe/fantasy---I kept wondering, Why don't they just machine gun Capt. America at the knees below his shield?  This is a BIG scenescape movie with a lot of BIG action, and if that is all you need, you'll like it.",1436400000,,922,4.773584905660377

...(and of course a Superhero and a (maybe) Supervillain)

Captain America: The First Avenger was generally a hugely satisfying, if somewhat rushed, introduction of a superhuman patriot who forthrightly fights for truth, justice, and the American way.  Before we could find out how his 40s and World War II experiences shaped Caps (Chris Evans) outlook, battles with sinister Nazi scientific/military organizations cryogenically thrust him forward into our shockingly unfamiliar world.  Of course, part of the reason for this was that he had to be available for Avengers movies.  Nevertheless, this time travel motif set up the always engrossing and recurring conflict between Caps straight-arrow traditional beliefs and todays more obscure, ambiguous, and even cynical concepts of right and wrong.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier  (hereafter Cap A:WS) explores this conflict, and many others, with soul-stirring action, rousing battles, labyrinthine, twisty, secret government agendas, and the near-Kafkaesque difficulty in telling the good guys from the bad guys in todays world.

Cap A:WS begins in Washington, DC with Cap (aka: Steve Rogers) literally running circles around his new friend and partner Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), an aerial rescue expert whose alter ego is the high-soaring Falcon, at the Reflecting Pool.  Cap is still trying to get accustomed to 21st century modern life in his own unique version of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Sam works at the local VA hospital and invites Steve to hear about wounded veterans experiences and put his own into perspective. Despite his on-going culture shock, and his suspicions about S.H.I.E.L.D.s ultimate objectives, Steve/Cap still ably participates on missions under the watchful eye (literally) of the stern, enigmatic Colonel Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson).

On Furys orders, Steve/Cap, along with exquisitely martial-arts trained Russian (double?) spy Natasha Romanoff (aka: Black Widow) (Scarlett Johansson), goes on what he thinks is a routine mission to save some S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel held as hostages aboard a ship by brutal mercenary Georges Batroc (Georges St. Pierre). After a bruising battle, Steve/Cap and Natasha succeed in freeing the hostages, but then notices that the mission had another purpose unknown to him, but quite known to Natasha: retrieve a flash drive disk containing important information.  Steve angrily confronts Fury about this deception; Fury responds that the data pertains to the Insight Program, a type of national defense shield programmed to neutralize all hostile threats.  However, S.H.I.E.L.D is unable to decipher the flash drives data, prompting Fury to see an old acquaintance, World Security Chairman Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) to persuade him to delay implementing INSIGHT.  Pierce apparently acquiesces.

Subsequently, while driving home, Fury is ambushed by mercenaries disguised as cops and led by the Winter Soldier, an unidentified masked assassin with a metallic left arm who has superhuman abilities equal to Steves/Caps.  Despite grievous injuries, Fury escapes to the sanctuary of Steves/Caps apartment, gives Steve the flash drive disk, warns him to trust no one, and expires.  Now its up to Cap, Natasha, and Sam to avoid the Winter Soldier and his hordes (and other, unexpected people) and find out what is on the disk.  Eventually the trio uncover another organization with a name straight out of Greek mythology (and an apt name, too, if you know your Greek mythology) with short-term plans to seize S.H.I.E.L.D. satellites to kill millions of people, and long-term plans for world domination through promises of security.  Not only do
the trio have to stop this somehow without getting killed, they have to find out if S.H.I.E.L.D., the INSIGHT program and Councilman Pierce are complicit in this, AND defeat the Winter Soldier and uncover his identity (Hint: Its  somebody from Steves/Caps past, a most unexpected somebody.)

Cap A:WS certainly soars (often literally) above a typical mindless superhero brawl and even a Star Wars-type dogfight, and is certainly more thrilling, emotionally draining, and substantial.  As my review title mentions, Cap A:WS is an enhanced, more muscular, more windingly complex (you have to pay attention) and even more relevant update of the Bond movies, dealing with national security and fear and the sometimes tyrannical lengths government will go to preserve one and banish the other.  The movie deals with the paranoic effect corrupt agencies have on human loyalty, trust, and integrity and the psychological toll it can take; for example, even though they are effective partners, Natashas shady, double-crossing, mendacious past makes Steve feel a wee bit distrustful of her.  Ditto for Steves testy interactions with Fury. The movie even finds time for Steve/Cap to encounter reminders and would-be lovers from his past, and the bittersweet, nostalgic feelings they produce.  Not least important, Cap A: WS illustrates the strength of friendship, even if one person is more committed to the friendship than the other, and the sacrifices that committed person is willing to make to resurrect that friendship.  Youll recognize that friendship if you see the movie.

And I most enthusiastically recommend you do see Cap A:WS, both a critical and commercial triumph, because it is that oxymoronic rarity, the intelligent action movie  It stimulates your adrenaline and emotions, and it challenges your reasoning and your ethics, and it reassures you that despite the lies, deceit, disillusionment, hatred, and betrayals that seemingly overwhelm our modern world, you don't have to be Captain America, Black Widow, or Falcon to have the will to defy these bad things and do the right thing (youll recognize that scene when you see it).",1435190400,,5850,5.477196885428254

5223671,5,B0090SI3EI,"I'm what you might call a casual superhero movie fan. I've seen most of the new Marvel movies (I've thus far avoided Thor) and appreciate their quality. But no superhero movie has spoken to me like this one--not even ""The First Avenger,"" which was my previous favorite Marvel offering. I saw CA:TWS at a time when I was being faced with some of the same questions as posed in the movie: Who are you going to follow? Where will you draw a line? Will you take a stand, even when ""the law"" is not on your side? It's probably no coincidence that my favorite track from the soundtrack is titled ""Taking a Stand.""

Maybe I'm nostalgic about the ""good old days,"" because I grew up in a time (or at least a family) where there were absolute distinctions between right and wrong, good and evil, ethical and unethical. I suppose I identify with the Steve Rogers because, like his ""fish out of water"" Captain America, I often find myself at odd with ""ethics du jour."" His naivete/innocence is sweet, but resonates with me because it reminds me of simpler times--not just for me, but for the United States.

Also, there's lots of great action that's at least somewhat grounded in reality. I stand with you, Cap!",1434585600,,1199,4.546296296296297

5223674,5,B0090SI3EI,"Steve Rogers, aka Captain America (Chris Evans), is settling into life in the modern era.  He's still trying to catch up on culture he has missed, but the missions he goes on for S.H.I.E.L.D. are helping keep him busy, which he appreciates.

However, after one mission almost goes wrong because Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) has a separate mission, Steve begins to question his place in the organization.  At the same time, Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) begins to suspect there is something very rotten in his organization.  Couple that with a Russian assassin called The Winter Soldier who has a surprising connection to Steve's past, and you have a situation getting more complicated by the minute.  Who will survive?

Being a superhero movie, you'd expect lots of action, and you won't be disappointed.  The stunts and effects are outstanding, and I loved every minute of them.  This is a big budget event film living up to its expectations in every way, and I loved that.

However, sometimes that means the movie skimps on character as a result.  I didn't find that to be the case here at all.  In fact, the characters felt better defined for me than they did the first time around.  I really connected with Captain America and his struggle to find the right side to be fighting for.  When things turn personal late in the film, I really felt for him.  Yes, even as the explosions were going on around us, I was worried about his personal story.  I also loved his new friend Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie).

All this means the actors had more to do than in a normal action movie, but they did a wonderful job.  There are some great small moments that mean so much.  Heck, I think one reason I connected with Sam so quickly was that Anthony Mackie makes him so likable from the very beginning.  Chris Evans has the right mix to make us care for Steve, which is hard in a character as almost perfect as he is playing here.  Scarlett Johansson is having a blast as Black Widow, and that comes across for us as well.  Samuel L. Jackson is given the most to do in any of these movies so far, and he makes the most of it, too.

There is a nice smattering of humor in the movie, too.  It's just enough to lighten the mood without destroying the tension they are building.

And I mentioned the action and effects, right?  Because that climax was a sight to behold, and I loved it.

I'm definitely ready for the next stop in this franchise, both Marvel over all and Captain America specifically.  I hope they keep building on the success that is Captain America: The Winter Soldier.",1434499200,,2586,4.541125541125541

The Winter Soldier is a gritty and dynamic villain, a marvelous antagonist. The film is also politically astute with comments on the ability of governments to watch countless people through technology.

After seeing him in Fantastic Four I really didn't care at all for Chris Evans, but now I realize that was the movie's fault and not his.  He is a great actor with a lot of charisma and he owns the role as Captain America.  Scarlett Johansson is an absolute badass, and not hard to look at either.

They got the characterization spot on, the plot works wonderfully, fights are all choreographed well... but to me, the most important thing is that there's heart there, emotion and story and the characters are all tested and feel real. There aren't really any plot holes that I noticed, everything makes sense... overall it's just really amazing.

Okay that first statement is a slight exaggeration, I haven't seen all superhero films so I can't say that definitively. I have, however, seen all the Marvel ones and this is far and away the best, better than Avengers.",1431734400,,597,4.97

5223946,4,B0090SI3EI,"**Possible Spoilers**
I recently purchased this because the second Avengers movie just came out and I wanted to catch up a bit on the character movies that came out after the first Avengers. I am surprised I ended up buying this because the first C.A movie wasn't that interesting to me. Chris Evans as C.A is nice to look at but Steve Rogers for some reason does not grab me. I guess he doesn't have enough layers for me yet.

For me the real draw was The Winter Soldier. He and C.A share a past. If you saw the first C.A. movie you will know about that past. I found myself wanting more of TWS in the movie, and I hope more of his story apart from Steve comes out in future movies.

I was also intrigued by Emily Vancamp's Agent 13 and I read more of her will be in the next C.A. movie.

Because the Marvel Universe is so diverse, even if a character does not really grab your attention, they are surrounded by other characters that make the story interesting. For me, that is why I ended up liking this movie and subsequently purchasing it.

I feel like I need to mention this because my mother and next door neighbor got confused by this. Sam Wilson/ Falcon is not Antoine Triplett from Agents of Shield. Two different actors play these two characters Anthony Mackie played Sam and B.J Britt played Triplett. I can sort of understand the confusion because at certain angles the two men kind of resemble one another.",1431216000,,1419,4.38403041825095

5224112,1,B0090SI3EI,"What a complete crock of rot.  ...I was expecting so much more from the previews. ..  The premise of the story was just plain dumb, technologically impossible and insulting to anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature. ..  Somehow a Nazi scientist imported during Project Paperclip managed to insert his wicked brain into an antique computer system and magically influence the political direction of the US.  ... Lots of people in high places were influenced to follow his lead into evil.  Enormous war machines were built that would be stationed in the atmosphere and murder anyone who was annoying to their cause (whatever it was).  These machines were being built under the Potomac River in an enormous ""secret"" complex and the evil group had taken over the headquarters.  The location is that of the current Hyatt in Arlington, VA. .  From there, it got even dumber.  This is another of a whole series of ""action"" movies coming out of Hollywood that are militarizing youth in the US.  Kids will want to join the military and become Jedi Knights like Captain America - but this movie has one redeeming factor - it points out (and I'm certain that most people will miss it) that the majority of the military were actually Storm Troopers for the Evil Empire and they didn't know it.",1428969600,,1288,4.761261261261262

5224140,5,B0090SI3EI,"This movie is one of the best Super hero movies of all times. I am not an expert on Marvel Comics nor anything in the Marvel universe so I won't be able to make reference to specific characer plots or Marvel Universe story lines and say they got this or that wrong/right. I don't know all the aspects and characters of this movie and other movies and or comics based on the Marvel Universe and or Avengers.

But as a ""Pop Corn""  movie goer who like super hero movies too. This one is great. The story is good enough to keep your interest and there is no reason to try to point out any failures in plot and or story. The use of special effects is done well and enhance the experience not hamper it like you may find in many movies that are heavly rely on special effects to tell a story. The special effects are eye popping when they need to be and passive when called for.

The acting is ""standard"" for this type of film. Which now days is usually is good. The action is good and spread out evenly though out the film.
It is hard for me to compare it to other super hero movies because so many great films have come out in recent years, it is just too hard to pick one.
I thought Man of Steel was awesome and Iron Man(series) too along with Thor, The Avengers and a the Dark Night. Not to mention The first Avengers(Captain America) were all awesome from a layman's point of vIew.

I thought this film was better then the first one and I think the box office showed it was better too. I gave it a 5 because there are no 4.5 to choose from. So 5 is what I had to settle on because I think it is very close to a 5 star rating.

These Marvel Studio folks sure know how to turn out great films. It think it was the success of Marvel films that made The Man of a Steel so great too. I don't care to comment about the last Batman movie though.
If you like a good ""Pop Corn"" action hero movie with overall good acting, plot and special effects then by all means buy this movie.",1428451200,,1970,4.06701030927835

In our home movies and shows fall into 3 categories:  bad-not great (watch once, bury deep in collection or discard), pretty good (watch once, keep around for possible future viewing), and awesome (watch over and over and over).  This and the Avengers has our household (including our 4.5 year old boy) enthralled for many viewings.  I also like the basic and clear values that this series of Captain America upholds.  Though it was my husband's call that our little guy was old enough to watch the Marvel movies, I'm glad the the Cap movies are the only one he's really interested in.",1428364800,,660,4.8053097345132745

I always find ScarJo's Black Widow annoying, and the Winter Soldier actually seemed kind of extraneous (they could have replaced him with another assassin character and the story wouldn't have changed all that much; when Winter Soldier came out in the comics, the whole mystery revolved around him), but other than that it was great. Possibly my favorite Marvel movie. Also, gotta love the Pulp Fiction easter egg.",1426464000,,558,4.946808510638298

5224287,3,B0090SI3EI,"Really enjoyed this film. Here is an example of Marvel's movie production team really nailing it right in terms of drama, plot, and script then blending in the action, stunts, martial arts, and special effects to the highest quality level producing a comic book movie masterpiece worthy of the ""Avengers"" & name ""Captain America"".

 Basic theme: A few years after the events of ""Avengers"", Steve Rogers is trying to adjust living in the world of the 21st Century after being frozen in time since 1944. The world is so advanced and completely different that Rogers naturally has trouble adjusting & getting used to this strange new world to him, but normal reality to everyone else. WW2 & the ""FDR-Harry Truman"" depression era are clearly long over, and our hero tries to find meaning in his life while also still employed as an Avenger working with the ""Special Forces"" and the ""kick-rear end Ninja"" fem fatale ""woman commando"" Scarlett Johanson. Although a complete gentleman, Rogers finds himself both not trusting the shady Johanson & her untrustworthy agenda, while also finding himself sexually attracted to her beauty.

  Secretary of Homeland Security Robert Redford has a mission for the Captain, & there is a mysterious violent assassination attempt upon Samuel L. Jackson's ""Colonel Fury"" character that must be investigated.

 In the meantime Rogers meets an US Air Force retired Sergeant who worked as a Para-rescue operator, who is currently employed by the VA. This ""Afghanistan War"" hero finds a deep connection and friendship with the Captain as this man joins his team taking on a powerful new lone wolf -Terrorist slash assassin named ""Nomad"".

 I found this film to be so outstanding that I rank it up there with Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" reboot franchise, as well as other films like Tim Burton's first 1989 ""Batman"", Arnold's ""Terminator"" & ""Conan"" films, & even the ""Die Hard"" films.

 I liked the message of this film which clearly states modern society is overwhelmed by corrupt government officials trying to spy on innocent honest citizens, both at home & abroad through the NSA, FBI, & other sometimes out of control agencies in the name of ""Homeland Security"". There is no question government must defend the public from modern Terrorism, and prevent future plots, but politically we must be careful on how our authorities go about the practice of our National Security in a post 9-11 world.

  It had been too bad that ""Avengers 2 Age of Ultron"" had been such a piece of trash film.",1426377600,,2519,4.98090692124105

5224385,5,B0090SI3EI,"As a fan of the Marvel comics, Marvel Studio's Cinematic Universe and film in general, I was looking forward to Steve Roger's next adventure unfold on film following Chris Evan's great performances as Captain America in 'Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger' and 'Marvel's The Avengers'. To say that 'Marvel's Captain America: The Winter Soldier' met my expectations is an understatement. This film is GREAT for fans of comic books, comic book movies, action adventure films, suspense thrillers and fantasy films with a sense of humor.

The strength of Marvel Studios is that each film features a very unique character in a very specific genre who happen to inhabit a very distinctive universe and they've managed to pull off a magnificent sense of cohesion without tripping over their own cape.

The film, handled very confidently by the Russo Brothers, is a love letter to the labyrinthine political thrillers of the 1970's while still managing to be a thoroughly modern big budget superhero blockbuster that in many ways surpasses the previous films in this series, including 'Marvel's The Avengers'. Robert Redford, star of 1976's 'All The President's Men', even pops up to lend credibility to the tone and genre this film is paying homage to.

Two years have passed since Steve Rogers was thawed out from 70 years of ice and assembled the Avengers on Park Ave and 42nd Steet to successfully defend New York from an alien invasion. The Avengers have gone their separate ways and Steve Rogers, now working for S.H.I.E.L.D., struggles to figure out what to do with himself and where he fits in. Times have changed and is Steve Roger's moral compass, his values and ideals, as outdated as he feels at times in this new world?

The film, for all the insanely orchestrated set pieces and explosions, still takes the time to explore the daily life of a thoughtful man strong enough to have saved the world in WW2 and still humble enough to not want a shred of recognition without throwing a wrench in the pacing. Steve tries his best to move forward in life but stills finds himself thinking back to what he lost and left behind in the 1940's. Visits to Smithsonian exhibits about his legendary battles against Hydra, the Nazi rogue science division, in WW2, are his chance to reminisce about old friends, brothers in arms and a first love, in one of several callbacks to 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' that fans of that film will find fun and heartbreaking in equal measures.

The repercussions of the earth-shattering events of 'Marvel's The Avengers' are truly felt in this film and the global sense of paranoia and constant fear of attack is felt as the World Security Council debates the benefits of having the ability to take out threats before they happen. Loyal a (super) soldier as ever, Captain Steve Rogers has no issue taking orders from his superior officer Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), but has the wits, confidence in his beliefs and trust in his intuition to speak up when something doesn't feel right, reminding Fury that in the 1940's, punishment came AFTER the crime, a sly commentary in the real world's current War on Terror and the use of drones to execute targets remotely.

Rogers senses that something is amiss and to reveal any more would be a disservice to the tightly paced, intricately woven script (written by Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely) that brings Captain America out of WW2 and firmly into the present in a film that feels more of Marvel's take on 'The Bourne Supremacy' than Marvel's take on 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.

If you haven't seen any previous Marvel Cinematic Universe films, you won't be lost, but it GREATLY dimishes the impact of certain events in a film that is sure to DRASTICALLY affect the plot of Marvel films to follow.

If you're a fan of superhero films or summer blockbusters, you'll love the explosive action, thrilling hand to hand combat, exciting supporting cast (including fellow Avengers) and if you're NOT a fan of these types of films, you'll love the fantastic acting, truly surprising plot twists, subtle social and political commentary and the attention given to Steve Rogers, the man and not Captain America, the superhero.

Marvel Studios knocked this one out of the park, and Chris Evans carries the film as effortlessly as Steve Rogers carries his trusty shield. The acting is solid, the action is gritty and rough, and the plot rewards multiple viewings.

Not just a solid action film, but a genuinely great film overall, I can go on and on about 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' so I'll stop and wrap things up by reminding you to, as always with Marvel Studios, STAY AFTER THE CREDITS ;)",1425254400,,4691,4.867167919799499

5224394,5,B0090SI3EI,"This is how you do a superhero movie. After watching this movie, I have to say it is the best superhero movie I've ever seen other than The Dark Knight Rises and The Dark Knight. Speaking of those movies, I really liked how I finally got what I've wanted for so long. A darker and more somber movie from Marvel. This is that movie. While it's not as dark as TDK movies, it certainly has the darkest tone we've seen from a Marvel movie so far. It is a much more violent movie than we've seen from Marvel. The stakes feel very high and very dangerous. This is a political thriller at its core. I loved how they really examined Steve Rogers as a man just like The Dark Knight Trilogy examined Bruce Wayne more than Batman. In my opinion, this is the best Marvel movie so far. Yes, I liked it more than The Avengers and Iron Man 1 and 3. Chris Evans gives a fantastic performance that is just as memorable as all of Robert Downey Jr.'s performances as Iron Man. Scarlett Johansson is excellent again and is even more sassy and dangerous this time around. Anthony Mackie steals all the scenes that he is in as Falcon and Samuel L. Jackson is great as usual. Robert Redford is also very good as Alexander Pierce. The action scenes in this film are among the best I've seen. They are truly mesmerizing. This is one of the best superhero films I've seen, period.",1425168000,,1354,4.334645669291339

Winter Soldier delivers plenty of great action and furthers the primary Avengers' arc in a way that draws you into the story and leaves you impatient for the next installment. The verbal dueling between Cap and Natasha (Black Widow) was an unexpected but surprisingly enjoyable addition to the movie.  More of Steve Rogers' is NEVER a bad thing, and Winter Soldier delivers a deeper, more developed look into the duality of Captain America as he struggles with the passage of time and life experiences. Overall, this movie more than exceeded expectations and I look forward to watching it again in the future!",1424476800,,802,4.889705882352941

I hope the return of Bucky Barnes continues to be fleshed out in the next Cpt America movie.

5224530,5,B0090SI3EI,"First, Captain America was never my favorite comic character growing up.  I always felt that his powers were too generic, and his schtick - dressing up in an American flag - was passe.

But I love this film.

First, it presents an extra dimension to Cap that I never really got from the comics.  This is a man out of his own time.  For all intents and purposes, he died in the 1940s and was resurrected in the 21st century.  Everything and everyone he loved is gone, and the world is totally different.  Here is a man trying to find his place in a world that has moved on and forgotten him.  When it comes to loss, Batman has nothing on this guy.

Second, I like that this movie tests the hero according to his principles.  He is a man who put his life on the line for freedom - and paid the ultimate price for it - only to find that the world he lives in no longer values it.  This puts him in the odd position of fighting the very people who are supposed to be defending the world.

Third, I love the villain.  The Winter Soldier is a dark mirror of Cap himself, a warrior with just as much resolve, but fighting on the wrong side.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but let's just say that Cap is called on to make even greater sacrifices than his own life.  I compare this film to Mask of the Phantasm and Under the Red Hood because of similar themes of loss and conflict.

Fourth, I love the inclusion of Sam Wilson's character.  This is a man who has a truly deep connection to Cap because of their similar life experiences.  Without spoiling anything, I will just say that I love the friendship between these two men; you don't really see that kind of intimate (but not romantic) relationship in movies these days.  My question:  why isn't Sam on the cover?

Fifth, I like the Black Widow in this.  I found it quite fitting that, while there is tension between them, there is no romance with Cap.  They are coworkers and comrades, and later good friends.  I'm glad the movie didn't shoehorn an awkward romance between them (although I would love to see Sharon Carter return - I wonder if she is somehow connected to Peggy).

Conclusion:  It's a great action film, a great spy-conspiracy thriller, a great superhero adventure, and a great buddy ""cop"" movie.  Check it out.",1424217600,,2300,4.338028169014085

Not so with Soldier. The Winter Soldier is a first-rate thriller that grabs you by the collar and yanks you in; and its special effects and combat sequences are so masterfully rendered that at no point did I question if a lone Captain America could take out an attacking fighter jet, in flight, with nothing but his body and his shield.

5224649,5,B0090SI3EI,"Blending espionage, political intrigue, cold war politics, and super heroes sounds like a recipe for failure but it works so well thanks to two directors who absolutely understand the material and a cinematographer who knows how to shoot action. The Russo brothers knock it out of the park with their pitch perfect tone. The film is fun in the way the first Bourne Identity is fun. It's a man on the run film with Cap as the man on the run. The entire world is hunting him and he has no idea who to trust. It's classic. But I don't know if the movie would have been as much of a success if it hadn't been for the stellar cinematography of Trent Opaloch, who had previously worked on District 9 and Elysium. He cut his teeth on big action set pieces and when the Russos brought him on, gave him the inspirations visual of The Raid, Heat and Ronin, they had the recipe for a great movie.

This movie actually pairs incredible well with either of those three movies... The Raid inspired all the hand to hand combat (and it shows), Heat inspired all the gun fights (and it shows) and Ronin inspired the car chases (and it shows). Don't  believe me? Watch those films.",1422835200,,1163,4.404651162790698

5224709,4,B0090SI3EI,"A nice rummage through the genre bin in search of a hybrid that hadn't yet seen the light of day: the action / adventure / superhero / political thriller. It's enjoyable enough, if a touch on the shallow, superficial side. Though it runs a bit long, I don't feel like the drama was given quite enough time to simmer and skeptics will see right through an early plot twist involving a major death (or two). The action scenes look and feel great, though, with an emphasis on physical effects in lieu of CG that pays big dividends. Scarlett Johansson gets a lot of screen time, much more than I'd expected, but feels purposeful and at-home, where Anthony Mackie's equal turn as Falcon seems forced and irrelevant. Of course, Chris Evans is vanilla but strong in the leading role and Sebastian Stan is appropriately cool-looking, if slightly under-explored, as his momentary nemesis the Winter Soldier. They probably should've kept the mask on longer, though; he seems far less menacing and visually striking without. I'm really struggling to understand why this didn't feel more substantial than it did. Even Cap's most appealing personality quirk - his disconnection from the trappings of modern society - gets little more than a cursory glance. Good but middle-of-the-pack in the Marvel family.",1422230400,,1293,4.9907407407407405
5224710,5,B0090SI3EI,"Winter Soldier is easily my favorite superhero movie of all time; I say this as a person who's seen just about every superhero movie in existence (even utter trash like Condorman). The movie takes the crown  due to the Russo Bros. excellent pacing, up-close-and-personal handicam work, and the best fight choreography I've ever seen in an action movie. If you think Cap is a '40s square who runs down the street with a shield, watch Winter Soldier! Marvel's moral center kicks copious amount of ass in super-soldier fashion; the Russo Bros. understood that the only way that Cap looks super-human is if he looks super-human. It's a simple concept, but one that was missing in First Avenger and The Avengers.

Winter Solider works because its a team effort; there are characters of various degrees of heroism that play well off of Cap (Black Widow, Nick Fury). And Anthony Mackie's Falcon is a great new addition to the Marvel Universe. His scenes in the final third of the movie are incredible.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Buy it. Love it!",1422144000,,1049,4.849162011173185
5224711,4,B0090SI3EI,"The overall pacing of the film is a tad sluggish, and you can definitely tell the Russo brothers had to really stretch to make the SHIELD is evil thing work...but a good movie. Not my favorite of all the Marvel films, that will probably always be Iron Man 1, but definitely better than the first Captain America. Enjoyable, relatively exciting, and a solid film. Mackie is perfection as Falcon. He made the movie and brought the whole thing together. Agent Hill felt a tad out of place, bordering on unnecessary. ScarJo was probably the worst of them in terms of acting. I'm sorry, but I couldn't get over how smug yet irritating she appeared through the whole thing; it felt off for the character. What is up with the being obsessed with Cap's love life, Widow? Kinda creepy with the weird smiles. Evans was solid, played wonderfully off Mackie and gave a more rounded Cap this time. In Avengers it felt like he was fighting to keep up with everyone, and wasn't very authoritative. In this, we see more of who Cap is supposed to be. My recommendation is to watch it and enjoy it for what it is. A superhero cum spy movie with a touch of Disney flair and a dash of innuendo.",1422144000,2,1174,4.465116279069767

5224779,3,B0090SI3EI,"I was seriously disappointed with this movie.  The plot is an I-told-you-so criticism of big government, a la i, Robot, but with brutish characterization and shamelessly stilted writing.

Whereas the first Captain America uses the ramrod-straight character of the Captain to deftly explore nuanced topics, like old versus new, the role of human dignity, and patriotism (the difference between loyalty to marketing tricks and loyalty to a country's cause), The Winter Soldier is concerned only with making Captain America look as cool as possible.  He has to kill more people in more interesting ways, have more killer one-liners that all the circumstances of the movie conveniently line up for him to deliver, get sexier coincidental moments with the token beauty of the franchise -- and don't forget the saintly moment that squeezes out all the sentimental sap it can.

Though those elements are bearable to varying degrees, it is the absence of substantial plot, good writing and acting for the role of Captain America, and a balanced exploration of the movie's themes that all relegate this movie to, at best, three stars.

It has some great elements -- for example, the acting for Falcon was refreshingly genuine, and the method of portraying Captain America's lifestyle in the beginning of the movie hit all the right notes of frustration, grief, and humdrum sci-fi comedy (for his everyday life, I should say -- the barbershop quartet line was stupid).  There are others I don't remember.

In sum, while the movie is OK, if all you care about is cool action scenes (of which I am a fan), I would say that this is a shamefully stilted portrayal of a delicate character.  To write about Captain America, you have to honestly explore the virtues and vices of the patriotic hero he is.  You don't have to design his movies like propaganda billboards, as I think the first Captain America makes clear.  It shows lack of understanding for the character.  There are many movies out there that are far worse, but I personally do not plan on suffering through this one again.",1421452800,,2072,4.925287356321839

Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a solid sequel to 2011s Captain America: The First Avenger. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with an entertaining plot that offers a modicum of character development to go along with all the mayhem, chase scenes and CGI effects that are the lifes blood of the modern-day action flick.

In this installment, 40s relic Steve Rogers (he even has an all-American name) is still adjusting to life as a superhero in the 21st Century when he discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D, the fictional spy agency, has been infiltrated and taken over by a traitorous organization known as HYDRA. Rogers has no idea who he can and cannot trust as he endeavors to save S.H.I.E.L.D. and the world at large from certain destruction. Enter the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), a manufactured super being similar to Rogers, who just happens, however, to fight for the other side.

As the granite-jawed, all-American-boy hero, Chris Evans possesses a good-guy earnestness and a disarming charm that fit the character nicely, and hes matched by such stellar figures as Robert Redford, Scarlett Johansson,  Samuel L. Jackson, etc.

Its all in good fun, and the time passes quickly, but, when all is said and done, you probably won't remember much about The Winter Soldier a few hours after its over. But, then again, thats not exactly what modern Hollywood blockbusters are all about anyway.",1421020800,,1436,5.093617021276596

The funny thing is I HATED the first one but Winter Soldier is head and shoulders above the original and above ALL other comic-book movies, hands down. It actually has a well-written plot and great action sequences. As much as I loathe CGI, the effects were top notch. The story seemed to be almost ripped from the headlines since it deals with 24/7 surveillance/tracking of citizens and drones. I LOVED the Falcon character (Anthony Mackie did an excellent job) and hope they will bring him back in more Marvel movies. Also, Frank Grillo did a great job. I would say more but don't want to spoil it for future films. It absolutely impressed the hell out of me (especially since I don't really care for the acting of Chris Evans--he's usually the weak link in any film he's in).

5225010,5,B0090SI3EI,I actually liked this one more than the first. I really don't understand the complaints about the bundle. Most people who have a 3D tv or even a HD TV most likely have blu-ray players on all their televisions therefore it makes since to bundle the 3D and the Blu-ray together. The DVD is usually sold cheap so if you need buy it.,1420243200,,329,4.238095238095238
5225011,3,B0090SI3EI,"While this is a solid movie overall, there were some disappointments here.  The first comes in the title (and previews) of the movie.  The Winter Soldier is almost a red herring, as far as this movie goes.  He is a relatively minor character in the overall plot of the movie, and has relatively little screen time.  They do very little to develop him or his actual source of power with a very brief and incomplete flashback, which is also quite disappointing.  So why title your movie after him, and spend much of your preview time on him?  As someone who is interested in the next super villain, as portrayed in these comic book movies, this was a major disappointment.  It's likely they're setting him up for a bigger role in the future, but, again, why name your movie after him and spend all your preview time on him?  Also, the conclusion of the movie, as far as the Winter Soldier goes, was far too ""Return of the Jedi"" for me.  Very ""I am your father"", ""I won't kill you father"", etc, etc.  It worked great on the Star Wars saga, but is a bit cheesy in a rehash 20+ years later.  It would have also been nice to have a new overall antagonist in this movie, but that was passable, I suppose.  Obviously this, like all other comic book movies, sets up for a big sequel, and I can only hope this sequel will be better than part 2.  It is, no doubt, still a very entertaining movie, and action packed, as expected.  There was just a bit too much cheesy dialogue and a few too many lame jokes to go along with the disappointing Star Wars wrap-up and lack of a leading role for one of the title characters.  Not a great follow-up to the first movie, but still worth a watch.",1420243200,,1675,4.306709265175719

The Russo brothers did a great job of incorporating enough of the Captain America and Winter Soldier Canon to keep it close to the traditional storyline without having to do tons of flashbacks like in the original story. Seeing Robert Redford in another movie with Scarlett Johansson was great (""The Horse Whisperer"", her first major starring role). This is a much more down to Earth super-hero film, as most Captain America comics are, after all, we are talking about a Super Soldier, and the action sequences are absolutely fantastic! Every fight scene has it's own style due to the opponents involved, and using Georges St-Pierre as Batroc was an excellent choice as it provided a great deal of realism to the fight between Cap and Batroc.

There are moments where you think ""sure that can't be real"" or ""no way they'd survive that"" but it seems that modern movie industry makes allowances for craziness and unrealistic. In this movie you can explain all that by just saying "" well this guy is a superhuman, he can survive much more than regular people can"" and you'll be correct.

5225069,5,B0090SI3EI,"GET THIS MOVIE. GET THIS MOVIE. I have seen the Terminator series. I was a kid when they first introduced Star Wars in the late 1970's. I have seen everything from Buck Rogers to Battlestar Galactica to Star Trek. I have seen the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, and Iron Man. I have seen Superman and Wonder Woman(TV series). I have seen the cartoons(Superfriends, Justice League, etc.) of all of these characters including the X-Men & Wolverine(their movies as well!). NONE OF THEM COMPARE TO THIS. NONE. NOT ONE. This is the MASTERPIECE that Stan Lee, head of Marvel Comics, has waited for for decades! If I could rate it 15 stars, I would! ACTION. ACTION. ACTION. ACTION. Just when you think the action and the movie is over, the action starts up all over again! The best ""superhero"" movie EVER made! EASILY. One of the if not the best action films that I have ever seen! This is not just martial arts and or super streetfights with heroes like Thor or the Hulk(both do not appear in this movie) that can destroy a city in a day. This film is more like a WAR. UN...BE...LIEVABLE special effects and CGI! GUNFIGHTS, GUNFIGHTS, and more GUNFIGHTS. This is a Marvel movie that is not afraid to show PREMIUM VIOLENCE. Good martial arts fights are to be expected with anything that has Batroc, Black Widow, and Captain America in it. At times this was more of a Jackie Chan film than a gunfight film but do not let that statement fool you; this is easily the most violent superhero/comic book movie I have EVER seen and I am 44 years old and love comics, horror, and scifi. I would rate this movie PG-13 but the violence level is borderline rated R.  As with all Marvel films these days, STAY WATCHING UNTIL THE END OF THE FINAL CREDITS. THERE ARE 2, that means TWO, ""treats"". One in the middle of the final credits and one at the very end. They paint  a rather chilling picture of what the future holds for Captain America, the Avengers, and one guy(like Doctor Who says:NO SPOILERS!) who you probably will not believe is alive until you see it.

Bad Guy but there was some depth in the details that inspired some contemplative pause.  As it turns out, our Hero has more layers than I expected, as does Evans.  Honestly?  He could have played the whole film dressed in a white t-shirt and tattered bomber jacket.  He carries the Hero in his skin, not the suit.",1419984000,,403,4.465753424657534

5225103,5,B0090SI3EI,"Solid action-adventure based on Marvel Comics characters. Having Captain America, the Falcon, the Black Widow, and Nick Fury team up was both fun to watch and contained an undercurrent: the choice between security and freedom. To me, this goes deeper than most other superhero movies because our heroes have to make a choice and they choose what will be a harder path with implied consequences. Cgi effects were top notch giving this a feel of reality that simply wasn't possible only a few years ago. Though the heroes perform some feats that are well beyond what stuntmen can do it mostly looks believable. Sit back and enjoy, and think a little as well.
If you are a comic fan, as I am, lots of details and references make more sense but non-fans won't be missing much either as the story is told well.",1419811200,,805,4.636363636363637

This is an action packed adventure as we get to see Captain America dealing with life in the modern world, and confronting a long lost friend.

5225285,1,B0090SI3EI,"The worst plot and totally lacking substance. Remove all the fight scenes and you may get 5 minutes of drivel that doesn't even add to the character development, relationships or plot-in-absentia. The actors are doing their jobs -- the writers and director are the problem. This movie does not keep in step with the other Marvel movies where the heros and supporting characters have well-defined relationships and dialogue is meaningful. Rather, all you get are a bombardment of fight scenes and watered down plot that, by the time the movie ends, you realize that it actually was as bad as you thought before ever getting off the ground. Anyone who is more than 10 years old will find this boring. Anyone who is 10 or younger shouldn't be allowed to see it for all the violence in guns and beatings that dominate this 'movie'. Bleh. Waste of money and time I'll never get back.",1418515200,6,878,4.707792207792208

This movie explores some very real and present issues that we deal with in terms of national security: our eroding freedom in the face of paranoia from international threats.

5225431,5,B0090SI3EI,It is an awesome movie. I reccomend watching The Agents of S.H.I.E.l. D season one before watching which is an awesome show. AoS takes off right after the Avengers and Captain America The Winter Soldier takes place right after season one. An awesome movie. So cool that Falcon is an Avenger maybye Spiderman next.,1417737600,,313,4.814814814814815

5225434,4,B0090SI3EI,"I enjoyed this movie, it's a fine actioner.  Beyond that, however, it explored the issue of government surveillance that is so topical today.  In this movie (and in Iron Man 3 exploring PTSD), Marvel movies are delving into the character's psychology and motivation without getting as depressing as the Batman films.  I found Redford's character the least interesting.  I would have appreciated more about his turning.  These movies are fast paced even when there's no fighting, so you must pay attention to catch these character expositions.  I liked Bucky's credits scene.  Is he reformed now or will he return to Hydra?",1417737600,,622,5.099009900990099

After several buffering interruptions the video content was delivered at a lower bit rate which was very noticeable (and poor). I cant pay for HD content when all you can deliver is SD.  If this is Verizon's fault (my provider) I need evidence and I will complaint to them - if not I will dispute charge on my credit card.  I understand this is a touchy subject but I need clarify on who cannot ""deliver"" either the 'pipe"" (verizon)  or the content provider (Amazon).

5225481,5,B0090SI3EI,"I don't tend to review things I've watched unless I own a copy, seeing as most of what I do watch is free with Prime. I'm making an exception with this one. This movie just didn't feel like a movie. It felt like a dream. A really good, really intense dream. From a shamanic POV, that's a big deal.

I'd been salivating to watch it for a while, but these past few days I had trouble sleeping for the want of it. So I spent some Amazon credit to rent it. Like The Avengers, I can relate to some of the characters. That's a big deal to me, especially since a lot of movies these days just care about explosions and sex, and that's it. There's no sex in this, while there's lots of explosions. (If you think a platonic kiss or two is sexual content, you're too young to be watching movies like this or be on the internet.) For those of us who actually watch something for real purpose, not having to roll our eyes at gratuity is nice for once.

My favorite points are Cap's fighting style (the offensive use of the shield and those kicks), Sam Wilson, and the true to life way their lives as soldiers are portrayed here. I have PTSD. Those who do, too, know what it's like. I'm also pretty isolated, so movies like this that represent well make it a bit easier for me to not stay locked inside as much. It's nice to see it handled accurately. It almost never is, but Marvel's been good. Take the stigma and fear of it away and you're left with normal people going through a hard time - not crazed psychos who could snap at any moment. That's important. That positive image saves lives.

The Winter Soldier shines in this. I won't post spoilers, but he's who you think he is. I'd like him to be fleshed out a bit more in future movies. His own experiences, how he adjusts, and if he does it ""well,"" these are things I want to see. Since his actor has a contract for six movies, I imagine this will happen.

I just want to say Stan Lee appears in this, as he does all his movies. :)

And that this movie, while triggery, is well worth the watch. You aren't alone. Soldier on.",1417564800,,2069,4.2015113350125946

It's serious, fun, and heartbreaking. If you don't know the comics, you won't see the plot twist coming. There's not much that's not great in this. Quotes range from the pithy, wise ones, to the silly, and references abound.

Perhaps the most important message in this movie was the warning about out of control government which comes at a very apropos time in American history. The issues of expanding unconstitutional power of government and the insights provided by Edward Snowden are present in this movie.

5225787,5,B0090SI3EI,"In the closing days of World War II Captain America defeated Hydra, killing its founder and leader The Red Skull when they crashed into the water while fighting aboard a gigantic bomber enroute to wreak devastation upon New York.
The Red Skull is dead but did Hydra also die?
Everyone thinks so but did this evil organization, in fact, survive the death of its leader and continue into the present day using far more subtle methods to gain its ultimate end: World domination.
'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' explores that premise in this sequel to the original Captain America film. Like the original, this sequel features plenty of action, excellent CG effects and some old friends, including Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce.
In addition to the nearly non-stop action, however, the film asks some penetrating questions that in an age in which most people seem to be afraid of their neighbors - especially if those neighbors look and worship differently - seldom get asked.
For example: In order to feel safe, must we purchase a sense of security by using our basic freedoms as currency? Must we, in fact, surrender those freedoms to government agencies we hope will not abuse their power to control and manipulate us?
Even murder us 'for the greater good...'
Captain America doesn't think so, but he seems to be in the minority as S.H.I.E.L.D prepares to unveil new intelligence-gathering technology and advanced weapons systems designed to ferret out terrorists and stop them before they commit their barbarous acts. He sees this new technology, which represents an unprecedented incursion into the privacy of millions of innocent people, as a threat to those ideals he and his Howling Commandos fought to preserve in the Second World War. That throws him into direct conflict with his boss, Col. Nick Fury.
The film also asks its viewers to explore the boundaries of loyalty and the strength of friendship.
By asking these questions in a movie that features improbable costumed heroes and even more improbable villains, the writers have - in my opinion - elevated 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' beyond the action/adventure genre into something much more profound.
If for no other reason than that, I highly recommend it..",1416441600,2,2240,5.056756756756757

5225925,4,B0090SI3EI,"I watched Captain America: the Winter Soldier without the benefit of having watched the original, or Avengers, so the story came at me without background.  Chris Evans is a new face for an action hero for me; his expressions are rather bland, though not as tough-looking as the usual Clint Eastwood or Sylvester Stallone stare.  However there is quite a backup team of actors including the lovely Scarlett Johansson as ""Black Widow"", Robert Redford as the leader of SHIELD (secret agency created after 9/11 to protect the US), Anthony Mackey as ""Falcon"", a former soldier who Evans gets back in the game, Samuel Jackson as a boss of SHIELD, and a very large supporting cast even including Gary Shandling (still funny) as a politician--looks like he's a senator.

Samuel Jackson not giving Captain America (aka Cap) all the facts of a mission causes an argument between them afterward, in which our main character, Cap, first begins to wonder if SHIELD is quite as good and trustworthy as he thought.  His fears are soon confirmed with a vengeance (so to speak) though not in a way he would have predicted, as an attempt is made on Jackson's life for unclear reasons.  Soon both the Captain and Jackson find themselves publicly discredited and in fact everyone in SHIELD ends up ordered to kill or capture the Captain as a traitor, while he and the couple of people he thinks he can trust, try to figure out who is behind this, what they're up to, and how to stop them before getting caught or killed.

If you had concerns about an insufficient number of BIG EXPLOSIONS, BIG WEAPONS, USE OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS, a sufficient number of FAST HAND TO HAND FIGHTS, CAR-CHASE SCENES and the like: I think I can allay your fears and assure you there will be more than enough.  What the body count was, was hard to keep track of.  It must have been high but of course ""sanitized""--that is, people are only killed at a distance, with little or no gore.  Why this counts as not even PG-13 but ""12 or older"" is beyond me and illustrates America's continuing preoccupation with protecting our young from swearwords they hear at school anyhow, or from glimpses of flesh, while also teaching them killing people is the American way.  Anyhow--back to the plot.

In a way it seems like a generic action-suspense plot, but as many other reviewers noted, it has serious echoes of concerns about the kind of security state the US has created since 9/11, with numerous programs, operations and even agencies which are all ""classified"", and which the public isn't even supposed to know about, and Congress is even lied to about--despite how we re supposedly a democracy with the rule of law, transparency and all that.  Basically our government's position (like so many others) seems to be that transparency is a WONDERFUL THING...so long, that is, as you don't have to REVEAL ANYTHING that might CONCERN SOMEONE.  Yes, you can see this paradox playing out in a ""kids"" action film--perhaps one reason why some big-name actors signed on (in addition to the paycheck).",1416096000,2,3043,4.773333333333333

5225936,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America's first movie was largely fun and serviceable.  The character was introduced fine, had a good enough outing, then got slapped into the future to join The Avengers.  So, what to expect from a sequel for a character that was fun if not outstanding the way, say, Iron Man was?

Actually, this character's turn at a second movie was far superior to his first, and probably the best sequel Marvel has put out to date.  Adapting the clever Winter Soldier storyline, in which much of what Cap believed about one specific person from his past was turned on its ear, while also introducing longtime Cap friend and partner the Falcon (as played by the incredibly charismatic Anthony Mackie), the film goes for a fast-paced, action-packed throwback to 70s style paranoia thrillers while also making some major changes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that has already paid some dividends on the so-so Agents of SHIELD TV show.

5225979,5,B0090SI3EI,"I enjoyed Captain America; The First Avenger somewhat.  I liked the World War II setting and the cast was pretty good but it lacked gravitas (although that's kind of too big a word for this type movie) or grittiness.  It's hard to define but it isn't a movie I re-watch often.  Winter Soldier on the other hand feels like an up-to-date, fresher film.  The action sequences are frenetic and energized like most post Bourne Identity and Daniel Craig James Bond films.  I don't like fast, jump cut action sequences but these fight scenes are easy to follow and well-choreographed.  A lot of emphasis has been put on Captain America actually being a super soldier.  In the first film and the Avengers he seems little more than a really skilled gymnast.  Here he straddles the line between something more than human but still vulnerable.  They really make good use of his shield in this movie too.  It's used like I remember from the comic books.

The story is well told and consistent.  I'm sure there are plot holes and inconsistencies that some people could point out but there isn't anything in the story that made me scratch my head in confusion or disbelief.  There was one thing I missed in the theater when I first saw the movie (I must have gone for popcorn) that I caught this time that clarified what annoyed me the first time I saw the movie.  I like that Captain America is trying to reconcile old fashioned values with the modern world.  All in all it's a much more believable and intelligent movie than most I've seen lately.  It's definitely more consistent then the Avengers.  As much as I loved that film there were some Hulk-sized plot holes I have a hard time getting around.  I think I actually like Winter Soldier better than the Avengers.  I like the more realistic superhero movies like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight series and I would categorize this movie in that group.

There was a good dose of humor done in the right places and I thought Captain America and the Black Widow made a good duo.  The Falcon was always one of my favorite sidekicks and I enjoyed his inclusion.

Probably the biggest endorsement I can give for Winter Soldier is that my wife hated the first Captain America (she fell asleep in the theater) but loves this one.",1415836800,2,2263,4.605

5226024,4,B0090SI3EI,"I had serious issues with Captain America: The First Avenger.  What started as a really incredibly mapped out origin story (with some superb visual effects) fell flat in the end as it tried to cram everything into the remaining minutes, making the film come off rushed and unfocused.  I just couldn't rally behind it, and despite all the raves and beloved notices from fans, I was left feeling it was below its potential and a wasted effort.

In fact, most of the recent Marvel outpourings have left me feeling like they were wasted opportunities.  Its not that I hated them, but the massive amounts of buzz and legions of fans had me always expecting something more than I got.

You know, except for Guardians of the Galaxy, which was a masterpiece of genre.

So it was with this expectation of being underwhelmed that I sat down with the bestie to watch Captain America: Winter Soldier.  Yes, I was seeing it for the hype, despite my adverse reaction to the hype of its predecessors.  Yes, I was seeing it for the reviews, which were remarkably good.  Yes, I was seeing it at the prodding of the guy sitting next to me on the couch.  But lets be honest here; I was seeing this for Scarlett Johansson.

I have to say, this far surpassed my low expectations.  It was far more focused throughout than the first film, and while some it felt a little overlong (I guess that would be the opposite problem than the first film), it all came together in a really tightly wound and visually expressive package.  The choreographed fight scenes were astonishing, the detailed visual effects (those explosions, car chases and superhuman abilities) and most importantly, the expertly handled storyline give Winter Soldier an edge over the other superhero sequels that were polluting the theaters this year.  Anchored by a real superhero (which I am fully convinced Chris Evans is) and littered with great supporting performances by Johansson, Jackson, Mackie and a surprisingly loose Robert Redford, Winter Soldier has a lot going for it.

And lets just establish now that this contains the greatest car chase scene in the history of modern cinema and one of the coolest elevator sequences ever included in film.

I admit that Im not the greatest judge when it comes to Marvel films, since I really have only loved two of them (Spider-Man 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy), but I have to say that Winter Soldier, while not perfect, feels like top tier Marvel.  With a plot that feels gritty and honest, falling more in line with a Mission Impossible type spy film and less in line with an over-the-top nature of most Marvel films, this is a film that has a real punch and is one that Ill remember for it.",1415750400,,2689,4.687234042553191
5226025,5,B0090SI3EI,Amazing. I loved the first Captain America and I think this one was even better than the first. Great action and storyline,1415750400,,122,4.590909090909091
5226026,5,B0090SI3EI,"Marvel has done a great job with all of their movies the past few years (a long way from the Fantastic Four and Punisher films) and this is no exception. The director has stated how he wanted a different vibe for this movie, bringing a 70's spy film feel to it (even casting Three Days of the Condor star Robert Redford) and he was successful.

As with all the Marvel movies there are great moments of levity and even some humor though due to the much darker tone in this it isn't as funny as say the Iron Man series.

Fans might want to check out Ed Brubaker's run on the Captain America comic as the story was directly lifted from his Winter Soldier story.",1415750400,,658,4.256

I think it's the best Marvel movie to date, with Iron Man 1 being a close second.  I like that it's not just about superheros clobbering endless amounts of dumb, anonymous aliens/henchmen.  Instead, the movie and its characters are smart and clever.

The fight scenes were very detailed and well done.  The action scenes were smart and well crafted.  The acting was good as well.  Chris Evans is great at being the Captain.  Scarlett Johansson was great too- one of my favorite performances of her's.

I'm not a fan of those flying fortresses, however. I call them, ""slow moving, easy to hit targets"".  I know we are ask to suspend belief when watching movies but I just think those things are dumb. lol

I enjoy movies like 'The Avengers' and all but I'd rather see more 'Winter Soldiers'.  I'd much rather see heroes that have to solve problems by being smart than by just blasting away dumb bad guys/aliens.  Hopefully there's a third Captain America in the works.",1415577600,,1063,4.769230769230769

I'm in my late 50s, this isn't the Captain America I remember from the comic books and that's disappointing. Also as I remember the story, in WWII Nick Fury had his howling commandoes, DumDum Duggan and company. Cap had Bucky as his sidekick against The Red Skull. Winter Soldier was a minor character in the late 60s, sort of a low powered, quirky, conflicted, counter culture anti hero,  when did he become Cap's nemesis?

And what did they do to Black Widow in this one? She's not a super hero here, she was basically just scenery. I know that Scarlet Johansen was pregnant during the shooting but they couldn't get a body double to do some action scenes???",1415318400,,758,4.446043165467626

The Winter Soldier is probably one of the best films Marvel has made to date. (Along with The Avengers and The Guardians of the Galaxy.)

This film is different, as it seems more a political intrigue/action film than a ""Superhero"" film. Well done, Marvel...keep 'em coming!!!",1415232000,,393,4.36986301369863

5226189,4,B0090SI3EI,"Finally a Marvelverse movie that is worth the time and money. Before this movie, I didn't like any of the ""marvelverse"" movies because they were all trite, formulaic, pandering ripoffs that insult the intelligence of all movie watchers. (At least in my opinion) The biggest defense I've heard for these Marvel movies is ""it's just a summer action movie. It's supposed to be fun and stupid"" to which I say that is garbage. Summer movies DO NOT have to be stupid bland, pandering crap. They can be fun and entertaining while still having some substance to it. Is it too much to ask to have a movie with a good cohesive plot, 3 dimensional characters all revolving around a well thought out concept? NO. We've seen it done before and it can still be done now. Captain America: The winter Soldier shows that it can be done. It has all the things a good movie needs, a good plot, engaging characters all revolving around a good concept. (Even Black Widow shows some real personality. She finally does more stuff than hit people while spouting cliche-female-badass-one-liners) It's executed very well which sort of makes me upset that this level of quality movie making is now the exception instead of the norm.

  Look, if you like all the marvelverse movies, good for you, you'll like this one as well. If you didn't like the marvelverse movies because of their sub-par movie making qualities, I can assure you that Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the 1 movie that is worth your time. If I had to compare it to another quality superhero movie, I'd say it falls within the realm of Batman Begins. It really could be the start of something good. However, this is in the hands of Marvel so it's possible that the few people employed there with a semblance of creativity and story-telling ability were able to input something of worth into this movie before Marvel found them and had them destroyed, forever snuffing out that last bit of quality storytelling, characterization and decency. Enjoy it while it lasts.",1415145600,,2013,4.7457142857142856

This is a fast moving action film that has some good fight scenes and more than a few tense moments, laced with a bit of thoughtful philosophy. Nonetheless, the plot tries to pack in far too many elements -- many of them reaching into other previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so that Crossover Syndrome gets to be too much: you have to be aware of and remember events in other films in order to make full sense of some of what happens and is said in this one. Chris Evans continues his perfectly nailed depiction of Cap, and Scarlett Johansson is impeccable in her role. In the end, however, this becomes too much of a mish-mash that is wrapped up through the expedient of things-blowing-up while keeping a number of threads still very loose. In that sense, this is often seems more an all-purpose prequel than a film that tells a complete, satisfying story. But it's still okay, and more than watchable.",1414972800,,1011,4.653631284916201

A thrilling and exciting summer movie that we were expecting back in 2008, and up until now we get. While it's easy to compare it to The Dark Knight as a Summer Blockbuster Comic Book achievement, Winter Soilder has it's own achievements and milestones to make it a monster of it's own and one of your collection.

Not only does it adapt very well the great Brubaker and Epting Run, but also it shows the diversity and quality Marvel Movies can and likely bring every time. A great Action movie, a well paced Thriller, an Adventure and enough emotion, all balanced and engrained in this episodic adventure Marvel Studios brings. Not only does it live up to the milestone Brubaker's Captain America was but also as part of the continous Marvel Cinematic Universe piece it is and as Summer Movie well balanced for all ages, tastes and entertainment you seek.",1414540800,,907,4.69811320754717

5226361,4,B0090SI3EI,"What's life like when you've been frozen for a few decades, then revived to become a champion of the modern era?  Complicated.  Steve Rodgers (Chris Evans) moonlights as Captain America, except it's really who he is all the time: a popular figure head, bouncing back and forth at the orders of his immediate commander Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), and S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford).  But when he finds himself on a questionable mission, immediately followed by an attack on a key S.H.I.E.L.D. figure, Rodgers must face the ultimate question: has he actually been used as a weapon against freedom?

THE WINTER SOLDIER is a far superior film to its predecessor, which was glamorous and entertaining, but ultimately rather shallow.  SOLDIER has some bite; there are genuine repercussions here that will affect Marvel films to come.  There's also quite a bit of violence: the slick, stylized action sequences meant to dazzle (and they do), but also a few quick scenes that are actually rather disturbing.  There's a moral ambiguity that pervades the film, as the good guys and the bad guys seem to change from scene to scene.  It's not truly groundbreaking (come on: at the end of the day, the Cap will come through for us), but it's got some grit that many superhero films seem to lack.

What truly helps elevate this film is the cast: Evans is charismatic, sort of a humble Robert Downey Jr.  He and Scarlett Johansson have great chemistry; it's also nice to see Johansson being more than just eye candy, which she was when Black Widow made her debut in IRON MAN 2.  Jackson does his thing (it seems to get better with each Marvel film, as he has more to do), and Redford injects a nice bit of humor into his role, especially near the end.  Anthonie Mackie is a welcome side-kick, and Sebastian Stan's stunt double is a great, nearly-unstoppable force as the titular villain.  Packed in are a couple of recurring roles that I won't spoil, plus a post-credits scene that would be absolutely perfect if not for certain copyright issues.

The gist: THE WINTER SOLDIER is a CAPTAIN AMERICA film for the real world.  He's not just Uncle Sam's bosom buddy; he's a regular Joe forced to realize that his government may not have his best interests at heart.  That said, the good guys ultimately win, which is what we want in a Marvel film: enough bite to put us on edge, but an ending that is at least happy enough to make us think that tomorrow might be better.  But then again, that post credits scene...maybe not so happy after all.",1414454400,,2550,4.707207207207207

5226497,3,B0090SI3EI,"I have always found Captain America to be the dullest of the major superheroes. Unlike the others in the Marvel stable, he lacks depth and moral complexity. Created as a piece of World War II propaganda, Cap is a tough sell for modern audiences.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Civil-War/dp/078512179X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Civil War</a>&nbsp;recast him as a civil libertarian, and we get a taste of that here, but he mostly just punches Nazis in the face, just as Captain America has for the last seven decades.

The film does offer some interesting political commentary when a neo-fascist HYDRA agent proclaims his organization's goal is the same as that of CIA stand-in SHIELD: order. The film asks the viewer to consider, although not too seriously, whether the post-9/11 American security state is really all that different from the totalitarian governments Captain America took on in the Golden Age of comics. But then  the film's closing scenes largely contradict this message.

Chris Evans does his best with such a bland character, but largely just reacts to other, more interesting, characters like Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury. While Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk and even Thor can hold their own in ""solo"" movies, Captain America needs support from fellow Avengers Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce is a predictable and tepid clone of Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B001FD5KJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>.

Of the films in the Marvel Cinematic University (which, due to studio licensing deals, does not include Spider-Man, X-Men or the Fantastic Four), this is the weakest. It is entertaining enough, but there is only so much that can be done with such a flat hero. The film's greatest virtue is how it sets up the series finale for 'Marvel's Agents of SHIELD.'

However, Amazon's streaming video always seems to have lowered audio.

5226528,5,B0090SI3EI,"By far the best film in the new Disney Marvel Cinematic Universe so far. Character driven, smartly written, and it doesn't pull any punches. The amazing thing about these films is that they don't shy away from plot points which delve into the more obscure aspects of comic book lore for fear of confusing viewers... Much like tv and film of the UK, the writers have assumed correctly that the people watching Winter Soldier aren't idiots and can figure things out for themselves without being spoon fed. Rightly so! The results are spectacular. While Cap is the central focus of the film, and we get to see a LOT more character moments with him (more than any other film - kudos for that), we have some fellow Avengers (well... Black Widow) and plenty of SHIELD action, not to mention plenty of Cap's past interwoven into the plot. I can't recommend this one enough, and for any of you who didn't quite get the first film? This one wraps it up and puts a bow on it for you. Enjoy.",1414022400,,980,4.4804469273743015

5226624,5,B0090SI3EI,"The Winter Soldier is a very good follow up to not only The Avengers (the events of which are lightly touched on in this movie) but The first Avenger. It is, not surprisingly more of a follow up to the latter. Steve Rodgers is still trying to adjust to living in this century after having ""died"" in the 1940s. It continues the S.H.E.I.L.D/Hydra battle that started during the events of the first movie when it was assumed Hydra was defeated. To say much more would be to give away too much of the plot, but Hydra uses their own super soldier (The Winter Soldier) who ties back to the first movie as well. And, of course for those who follow The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D series, the fallout from the events of this movie continued there.

The movie is very well written and acted. Some of the familiar notables (Black Widow, Agent Hill, Nick Fury), all play roles in the movie. It also introduces the character of Falcon into the movies. Scarlett Johansson probably has the biggest supporting role in the movie as Black Widow, and she and Evans have pretty good chemistry playing the straight laced Rodgers against the not so straight laced Black Widow. There are 2 scenes after the movie, one during the credits and one post credits that will set up the inevitable Captain America 3.

As for extras for those who do get the blu ray, on the single disc version there are a few short featurettes, some deleted scenes and a gag reel. There is also a commentary track for the film. Not a ton of material, but fine for what there is. Of course the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.

All in all, if you are a fan of the Marvel movies, this one is up there quality wise for the stand alone movies. If you liked the first Captain America movie then you will probably like this one as well.",1413763200,,1785,4.403030303030303

I suppose there are quite a few diehard Captain American comic book fans who would have preferred that they had stayed with the comic book origin of his powers, and that they had not abbreviate the comic book story line, but as we all seem to know, that's Hollywood.  Both of the relatively new Captain American movies are, in my opinion, fantastic.  The acting is good, the story line well defined, the special effects are fantastic.  Viewing the Blu-ray version on my sixty inch HD flat screen made me feel as if were actually there.

5226884,5,B0090SI3EI,"A+ for the film, B- for the extras.

The good; the film is simply phenomenal, right up there with the Avengers as one of Marvel's best.  The picturre is good; when I saw this in theaters I noticed that the fight scenes seemed a bit juttery, but noticed the same at home so it must be by design.

The not so good; the extras are fairly ligjht; gone are the days of the amazing Iron Man Special Edition.  No Marvel One-Shot, the making of stuff is OK but relatively short.

Overall, despite the light extras the film is a must see and the Captain America film we've all been waiting for;  Highly recommended.",1413244800,,606,4.31858407079646

5226918,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of those extremely rare sequels that makes its predecessor even better by comparison.  Not because it's so much better (though it is), but because it serves as a fascinating counterpoint to it: instead of the pulpy world of black-and-white ethics presented in the first, Cap (and the viewer) is thrust into a world of dubious loyalties, shaky allegiances, and moral ambiguity.  The fact that the filmmakers make the conflict both thematically and emotionally relevant is all the more impressive.  Character work has never been stronger, the action is on point, the sense of intrigue is unlike anything seen in this cinematic universe thus far.

It's not so unexpected a surprise as Iron Man, and it's not the culmination of decades of fanboy wishing like The Avengers, so it may not be the most *enjoyable* of the Marvel movies.  But with its smart story, strong characterization, and bold storytelling choices, it very well may be the best.",1413244800,,984,5.012269938650307
5226929,3,B0090SI3EI,"I like the Captain America actor.  I think he seems cool and is a good lead, but often throughout the movie I found that his lines felt so righteous that they were hard for him to deliver as an actor.  Captain America comes off as an icon instead of a real person.  The plot, hmm... what is the plot? Oh, that's right, save the world from mad-man.  Not much about Steve Rogers and a real life.  I know we want action in such a film and many of the action scenes are very good, but for the most part there is so much action that they stop being action.  It left me flat. Then, at the end, the teaser for the next movie didn't do anything for me. Not great.",1413244800,,655,4.0

5226936,5,B0090SI3EI,"One of the best of the Marvel hero movies. Good story that also added some meat to Cap's persona & history. I would have liked to see more bits about his 'out of place' feeling in the present time, like we've seen with the cut scenes from Avengers, etc.

And I wish Marvel would hire more 'technical accuracy experts' to call BS on the technically inaccurate things the writers come up with. Anyone with a computer, technical, science, or engineering background just grind at the technically inaccurate and hocus-pocus things they pull out of their hat, going all the way back to Iron Man. That's one of my main gripes through all the hero movies.

Other than that, I'm still thrilled that movie technology can now bring these heroes to life on the big screen and that Marvel is helming things to keep them as close to the comics & characters as possible. As a fan and comic book reader/collector during the 80-90s, it's always been some far off dream to see them come to life on screen.",1413244800,,987,4.53932584269663

Samuel Jackson and Robert Redford play off well together throughout the movie and share a number of scenes. Politically, I was impressed with the writing and the dialogue between the characters. The main focus of the movie is basically how much government control we need to have, and why are secrets secret. The Black Widow character sums it all up. ""All the intelligence we had was fabricated, so why are we so concerned about preserving these so called secrets?"" I could never have said it better.
Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansen have the best action scenes in the movie, and their relationship is very complicated throughout the entire movie. Their dialogue with each other is crisp and meaningful.
The real outlyer here is Redford. Where does he come from, and why is he doing this movie? I think the answer is very complex. i think he wanted to do the movie since it exposes (in an unreal fictional universe) a number of pressing questions in our country today.",1413072000,2,1061,4.679144385026738

5227132,4,B0090SI3EI,"I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could. I am stunned, absolutely stunned, that Marvel has maintained such a high quality series of movies. Even the flawed movies, like ""Iron Man 2"" and ""X-Men 3,"" are worthy movies if not great ones. Compare this to the original Superman films with Christopher Reeve, whose quality declined appreciably over time. Look at almost any extended series of movies and you see that in just about all cases, they turn into garbage over time. (Harry Potter is a notable exception. The filmmakers really did a remarkable job with that series.) Just as an example, Superman II, while still a worthy follow up to part 1, introduced those weird additional powers at the end of the film (Supes threw a a cellophane ""S"" off his chest at one of the Kryptonians). Part III was a simply bizarre mix of slapstick comedy and dark themes. And, of course, part IV was appalling--the less said about it, the better. Consider also the Alien series, beginning with part III, and the original Batman series beginning with the arrival of Joel Schumacher. Of course, Marvel did have some misfires, especially toward the beginning of the super-hero phenomenon in cinema...I'm looking at you Fantastic Four and Elektra. On the whole, however, the people overseeing the production of these movies are doing a remarkable job. The DC people are doing a pretty good job too. Christopher Nolan is very possibly the most gifted director of his generation. Also, I say without shame, that The Green Lantern was not as bad as it was made out to be.

I was skeptical that an exciting Captain America movie could actually be made, but I was very impressed with both the first film and with this one. Cap's powers are fun to see, for sure, but his action sequences aren't exactly like those in Iron Man. The filmmakers wisely balance the excitement of Cap's powers with an interesting story that has drama, surprises, and intrigue, a la ""Three Days of the Condor"" or  ""The Day of the Jackal."" It has a lot of action, but is is also a relatively sophisticated film, particularly in terms of its story, filmmaking artistry, and powerful presence of the great Robert Redford.",1412985600,,2167,4.745358090185676

I have the 3D version, and the 3D presentation was excellent.

Definitely a recommendation to folks that like the Marvel series.",1412726400,,315,4.777777777777778
5227272,5,B0090SI3EI,"I would give this movie 6 stars if I could, it's that good. There's plenty of reviews outlining the plot, so I'll just add that this movie does the rare job of elevating the first Captain America film to something far more intriguing and important than it initially seemed. Many plot elements that found their genesis as almost throw-away moments in that movie have bloomed to devastating effect in The Winter Soldier. All the characters gained enormous depth in this one, and Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier especially so, bringing an incredible array of emotional depth with very few lines. The film's score is magnificent not in the way of, say, Howard Shore's ""Lord of the Rings"" symphonic genius, but in the way of building suspense to such visceral levels that it actually raises the heart rate before anything's happened on screen. There are moments where the Captain America theme from the first movie emerges, especially at the beginning, but more often than not, there are mere pulse beats of low-register percussive notes that bring to mind the brilliant use of score in Jaws. The Winter Soldier theme especially claws at the viewer with discordant and screeching menace that will raise goosebumps on anyone with a pulse, and the rising noise of it in the end-of-the-end credits scene is both poignant and haunting as it dissolves into silence with the image's fade to black. Not enough attention's been given to just how much the score elevates the movie into something truly brilliant.

As for the Blu-ray package itself, I've not watched the 3-D version, so I can't speak to that, but the Blu-ray is about what you expect--crystal clear images, perhaps a little muddled on the sound. I've heard that unless you have a true home theater system, Blu-ray's never quite have the sound mix right. Dialogue is a little too quiet and explosions are too loud--that seems the case with every single movie I own, so I won't really criticize this set too harshly because of that issue. I figure until I have the wherewithal to redo my entire sound system, it's just something I have to tolerate. I have the highest quality digital copy on my Kindle--took half a day to download on my slow-ish wi-fi but was well worth it. Plays perfectly and with earbuds the sound quality is so excellent that I can hear things I missed, like the changing tone of the bullets hitting Cap's shield during the bridge battle as he closed in on one of the Strike/HYDRA gunmen.

All in all, this is a must-have for the serious Marvel movie collector and the more casual fan of the movie alike.",1412726400,,2580,4.756696428571429

5227293,5,B0090SI3EI,"As a huge fan of the Marvel universe, in my estimation Captain America: Winter Soldier is the best Marvel movie of 2014 and definitely in the top five Marvel films made to date.  With far better pacing than Guardians of the Galaxy (which did not prevent me from seeing GotG twice at the theater), Winter Soldier offers solid performances from a great cast, an excellent screen play, fast paced editing, and special effects that are consistently awesome.  All of which contribute to the high standards we have come to expect from a Marvel/Disney production.  If there is a short coming to the Bluray set it is in the special features which are fewer and fewer as the saga unfolds from movie to movie.

The most irksome change Disney has made is with its Digital Copy.  Disney has created an alternative cloud (similar to Ultraviolet) in which your copy is kept on the Disney website, which feels rather like Disney has joined the ranks of HYDRA, to quote from the Winter Soldier, in order to give us the freedom we deserve.  That is to say I now only have the freedom and ability to view a Disney/Marvel movie when and how Disney dictates.  The Disney cloud is purportedly shared with iTunes although I haven't been able to get either Thor: Dark World or Captain America: Winter Soldier to appear in my iTunes library to share.

But this is Disney, and Disney has historically demanded and gotten top dollar for its DVD and Bluray movies in animated and childrens products so I guess it shouldnt be a surprise that they will now follow Sonys lead and expect Marvel consumers to pay even more in order to actually own a digital copy rather than borrowing a copy via streaming.  For those consumers who might want to access the newer Marvel movies on a non-WiFi device such as some Amazon Fire Tablets or an Apple Touch or Classic iTunes device without paying hundreds of dollars a month for a data plan this is just the End of the Beginning -- Hail HYDRAand pull out your credit card.",1412640000,,1982,4.592067988668555

There is a major plot that involes people at the highest level of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Jackson did his usual excellent job as Nick Fury but his role was minimized far more than it should have been for the plot of the film.  Absolute worst was the edition of Black Falcon.  They wouldn't even call him Black Falcon out of sheer political correctness.  Not even Falcon...except to refer to him off hand by that code name.  No backstory and no real reason to add him in.  He's just painfully tacked on and given a few lame scenes.  Some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a major motion picture.

The story?  I won't add any spoilers except to say its stupid, politically correct, unlikely and quite frankly an insult to 50 years of better plots.  You probably won't be seeing another Captain America even though the plot leaves it clear they intended another one.",1412467200,,940,4.568862275449102
5227406,4,B0090SI3EI,Good flick,1412467200,,10,4.5
5227407,5,B0090SI3EI,Fantastic movie. 1960's and 70's era Cold War Thriller meets SuperHeroes. Just imagine SEVEN DAYS IN MAY or THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and raise the stakes to where only a SuperHero could solve them. Robert Redford is incredible as the man with a vision for the future but it's a smoke screen for the complex plot that will subjugate humanity using SHIELD tech. Comic fans will also enjoy how cleverly current day problems faced by our Vets are touched on as they adapt to a society they find no place in.,1412467200,,503,4.478260869565218

5227520,4,B0090SI3EI,"I didn't like this as much as the first Captain America which I thought was just short of a great movie. The only flaw was killing the Red Skull after only one movie. I just don't understand why movies do this - The first Spiderman thrilogy did this as well and don't understand why it's done.

For example - in the comics Dr Doom, the Joker, etc have been around for a very long time but in the movies many foes are defeated in a single 2-1/2 hour movie. And eventually that causes problems as after 3 or 4 movies they run out of first rate bad guys. Then come the reboots ala Spiderman, etc.

This movie was little over the top for me in terms of the constant action. I would have preferred a little less action and a little more 'story' - a little more character development if you will. The basic story was good, the acting ranged form very good to above average. Picture is outstanding as was the sound - but you would expect that from a recent movie being relapsed on Blu-ray.

I would rate this a very strong 8.25 to 8.75 out of 10 recommended!",1412208000,,1051,4.218905472636816

However, the tone and premise (how does Captain America survive a post-9/11, post-Avengers world?) was intriguing, and I gave it a shot. And it was very well written with some great turns.

And the movie is novel, in that it sets the table for the second half of ""Marvel's Agents of SHIELD"", giving a new and terrifying direction for that season (and season 2, which recently started).

I wouldn't have thought anyone could adapt the uber-goodie two-shoes superhero, Captain America, to the big screen but they really nailed it with this one.  Chris Evans is perfect in the role, both physically and character-wise -- it will be difficult for anyone ever to top his portrayal.

The supporting cast (Nick Fury, Black Widow, Maria Hill) from previous movies are back and they've also added a few other favorites, the Falcon, Crossbones (before he's enhanced), and of course the Winter Soldier.  They wove in more a plausible origin for Falcon than they have in the comics and Anthony Mackie gives a great performance (as usual).

The story was topical, given the recent overextension of US government surveillance and policing activities.  The plot holds together pretty well for a comic book.  It's fast-paced/the story moves along, it's got lots of fun action, and is full of people that are fun to watch.  What more can you ask for?",1411948800,,1022,4.833333333333333

This time around SHIELD is imploding and HYDRA is making a name for itself in the terrorism market trying to take down cap and his friends at all costs.
We get to see a few Hydra hold overs from the first movie, and the introduction of Crossbones and his origin(end easter egg) the only thing I would say was lacking was the main bad guy who was behind the scenes. He did just not work out for me, one thing that did though was the winter soldier aka Bucky Barnes!  Tons of cool fights especially in the end aboard the shield heli-carrier with the soldier and cap one on one.

5227729,5,B0090SI3EI,"When I first heard that Marvel was coming out with the inevitable sequel to Captain America, I had misgivings; after all, superhero follow-ups do not always go over well. If you disagree, I would point to Thor: the Dark World or Iron Man 2, both sequels to Marvel movies. These two resulted very differently: IM2, a highly-anticipated sequel to one of the best superhero movies ever (my opinion, shared by many), was really very bad. Yes, it had good bits, such as the Mark VI suitcase armor scene, which was hilarious and hyper cool, but the plot was shoddy and Tony Stark was far too antiheroic and stupid to be charismatic. Thor 2, on the other hand, followed arguably the worst movie of the Phase 1 set; ""Thor"" was very promising, but incredibly disappointing in many ways. The romance was over-accelerated and awkward, and most of the plot was difficult to follow due to a backstory we are expected to know but was never established. Its sequel was better than the original, but had many of the same problems, and a MacGuffin artifact that doesn't exist before or after the movie. So, naturally, the idea of the Cap sequel brought me both hope and anxiety; would they ruin the most admirable and honorable of the Avengers?
The answer was a resounding no. Where I liked the first one, I felt the whole time that I knew exactly what was going to happen. And every time, I was right. While watching this movie, I was floored by how original the plot was, considering it was a sequel. Marvel learned its lesson from Thor 2: in superhero movies, you can't make the same story work twice. This movie is incredibly original, drawing from a comic book storyline with every bit the fascination of Days of Future Past, and then some. For the first time, Steve Rogers is depicted not as the out-of-touch and out-of-his-depth super soldier, but as a leader. Sure, he's still acclimating to the 2010s, but he's very much in control, in some ways more so than Natasha Romanoff. Which brings us to the next thing I loved: Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, is a person, finally. I'm not saying she never had a personality; in the Avengers she was possibly the most amusing character, but she was not really a person. She was all Black Widow, sexy assassin, and 0% Natasha Romanoff, former KGB spy of nightmarish childhood, still hurting on the inside. There was only one scene in the Avengers when the woman supplanted the body entirely, when she was speaking to Hawkeye inside a containment cell aboard the helicarrier. But now, she is not only more human, she's also more herself. While her prickly personality and dry humor are still there, she somehow comes across as a victim of terrible circumstances, only now, after surviving a global catastrophe, beginning to see past the red in her ledger to what she could be instead. Romanoff's transformation is both physical and of character. She seems younger, more open, and is no longer the obvious eye candy of Iron Man 2, her first appearence. The revealing catsuits make very few appearances, as she spends almost the entire movie pretending to be a regular young woman, which means far less ostentatious outfits, though there is one scene toward the end in which she appears in an outfit ludicrously different from anything she's worn in the past.
While you may think that Marvel is going too far, putting Black Widow into a relationship with Rogers so soon, it must be noted that while they definitely develop a relationship, it's a thoroughly Platonic one for most of the movie, interrupted by a few romantic episodes which take place for reasons I will not spoil.
The villains in this movie follow the by-now standard Marvel layout: a baddie that turns out to be just a lackey of a much bigger baddie. While one of the villains appears in the title of the movie, so there is no surprise, and even despite the fact that his identity is known by almost everyone by the time they actually see this movie, he is so fascinating that one almost forgets you knew the revelation was coming. This guy isn't just evil; he's emotionless, and that somehow makes him even more terrifying. While I don't pretend the enormous plot device that his existence turns on isn't ridiculous, it's not that outlandish for Marvel. The other non-human villain who appears briefly before destroying himself (hint: not killing) is really unnecessary, and adds a scene which is very creepy but also completely unnecessary, and just seems to be disturbing for the sake of being disturbing, and nothing more. The primary villain, however, is not nearly as interesting, despite being the Bond-type villain you really, really hate. He's pretty stereotypical, and does nothing unexpected. But you'll still enjoy watching him, because he's Robert Redford.
I love this movie for the fantastic action, the character development, and the human interest. But not the plot. While the plot is original and interesting, it fails to really stand up in the face of scrutiny, possibly by design. Much is left unexplained, and the anti-villian in the title is never redeemed, really (BUT: watch the mid- and post- credits scenes. You'll be glad you did). However, this can be let go because Marvel has a whole universe in which they can work to shore up problems in coming movies.
I recommend getting this from Redbox, and watching it before you buy. I caution that this is no family movie, and deals with issues of human rights, terrorism, espionage, and contains some very scary images, particularly during the scene that takes place a bunker underground. I plan to buy this, but you may not like it as much as I did, so don't buy sight-unseen.",1411862400,,5648,4.770173646578141

5227765,5,B0090SI3EI,"Do you know who Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America: The Winter Soldier are for?  They are for comic book fans who endured 70 years full of pitiful portrayals of Captain America on the big and small screen.  They are for those who had to watch a chubby Dick Purcell play Cap in the 1944 film serial NOT as soldier Steve Rogers but rather as District Attorney Grant Gardner who used a gun rather than a shield.  They are for those who suffered through two horrendous made-for-TV movies in the 1970s starring Reb Brown, who wore a costume featuring a winged motorcycle helmet and a shield made of clear plexiglass.  They are for those who squirmed at the 1990 direct-to-video film which starred Matt Salinger who then, as now, is most famous for being the son of novelist J.D. Salinger.  In fact up until 2011s Captain America: The First Avenger, the best version of Cap comic books fans had was the 1960s Marvel cartoons which were little more than motion comics with limited animation but which at least featured Stan Lee stories and Jack Kirby art.

The film opens two years after the events in The Avengers with Cap now working for S.H.I.E.L.D.  He, the Black Widow (Johansson) and a strike team are assigned to rescue a group of agents being held hostage aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel by mercenaries led by Georges Batroc (I.e. Batroc the Leaper).  The opening sequence gets the film off to a thundering start and sets the tone for the rest of the way  More than any other previous appearance fans get full on Captain America of the comicsfast, agile, courageous, and a hand-to-hand combatant without peer.

Fury is ambushed by an assassin known as the Winter Soldier and presumed dead.  Cap and the Black Widow are branded as fugitives by S.H.I.E.L.D. official Alexander Pierce (Redford) and have to go on the run from multitudes of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who are searching for them.  They discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker and the cyber presence of former Red Skull scientist Arnim Zola who reveals that Hydra has been infiltrating S.H.I.E.L.D.s ranks ever since the organization was founded after World War II.  Cap recruits former USAF pararescueman Sam Wilson to aid in their effort to stop the Winter Soldier and destroy the Hydra moles before they can gain full control of S.H.I.E.L.D and several Helicarriers.

It is monumental disservice to refer to Captain America: The Winter Soldier as a superhero movie.  Yes it is a movie with superheroes but at its core this James Bond-style espionage thriller with a nod to the Jim Steranko S.H.I.E.L.D. stories of the 1960s.  There are agents, double agents, and triple agents and part of the fun is in trying to figure out which characters are playing for which sides. Bond himself would be jealous at the many high-tech gadgets utilized in the film, including the Wilsons Falcon wings, and the cloaking disguise that The Black Widow uses to infiltrate the World Security Council. Evil Gods, invading alien hordes and gamma-spawned behemoths have nothing on power-hungry men when it comes to great villains.  Alexander Pierce and The Winter Soldier combine to make a formidable inside/outside threat to the entire security of the country.

Perhaps more than any other of the current cycle of Marvel films The Winter Soldier plays into many of the fears and tensions we have about the government and who is really pulling the strings of power.  In the face of all this, Chris Evans plays Captain America--but more importantly Steve Rogers--as a man who isn't conflicted about whats right and wrong and is unwavering in his purpose. His long period of being frozen on ice has yet to turn him into a cynical American.  At one point he debates with Fury over S.H.I.E.L.D.s heavy handed methods of security stating, holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection Thats not free, thats fear!

The Winter Solder abounds in strong performances from Evans, Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson to Redfords sinister turn as Alexander Pierce and Anthony Mackies colorful debut as The Falcon.  The effects got a little over the top near the end but up until that point the amazing fight choreography, the car chase involving Nick Fury, and Caps fight with the Winter Soldier all hit the bell.  While the tie-in to Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. may not have spiked the ratings as Disney/ABC had hoped for, the mid-credits appearance of Baron Von Strucker and a certain couple of super-powered beings has this guy already looking forward to Captain America 3.

5227769,5,B0090SI3EI,"I was surprised by how good this was. In every way the movie excelled. The story was pretty good, the acting was good, the action scenes with fabulous and very well choreographed, the special effects were great, highly detailed, and realistic. The wing suit was a bit much and took from the movie, but otherwise I liked everything else. This is a good super hero movie but it is even more than that. It makes some subtle and over-the-top criticisms of overbearing government control, the complications of war, and the pitfalls of advancing technology. Mixes suspense, action, intrigue, and moral dilemma together well. The Captain America character is growing on me and finding his own niche on par with the other Avenger characters.",1411776000,,733,4.967479674796748

5227815,5,B0090SI3EI,"Phenomenol movie!  But I'm assuming if you're buying this movie, you know that already.  So my review will strictly be on this particular version of the Blu-Ray.  I picked up the steel book special edition due to the fact that it came with a digital copy and only cost $2 more than the non-steel book version.  The only difference between this one and the regular 3D one is the packaging.  Both come with a 2D Bluray, a 3D Bluray, and an HD digital copy code, and all content on the blurays are the same. I'm not a 3D person, but the cheaper 2D only versions DO NOT include a digital copy.  I would prefer if they would offer the ideal setup of 2D Bluray, DVD, and digital copy, like most other movies offer.  Unfortunately, in Disney/Marvel's quest to wring every last dime out of us consumers, they do not offer any Bluray/DVD combos. The bonus content on the bluray is adequate, but could have been better.  I really enjoyed the behind the scenes featurette showing some of the action/stunt work.  The nifty steel pagacking is a nice touch if you are into that sort of thing.  It is the exact same dimensions as a regular Bluray case, albeit slightly thicker. The case is sturdy and has a very high quality finish.  Overall, I give the movie a HUGE 5 stars, the packaging 5 stars, and the combo 4 stars for lacking a Bluray/DVD combo option.",1411689600,5,1344,4.444897959183673

5227824,1,B0090SI3EI,"This movie is a FIVE star and would recommend it 100%!!  In fact, I LOVE that they finally did a ""no DVD"" combo pack so I can get just what I need:  Blu-Ray 2D and 3D plus a digital copy.  I feel this is the best to date of the Marvel hero movies (though I need to see Guardians again as that may top this one).

I am ""One Starring"" this to protest Amazon's treatment of the pre-order.  I am an Amazon fan boy and Prime member, but do NOT approve of how Amazon is trying to strong arm Disney by not allowing pre-orders.

I bought from Best Buy on release day (and it was cheaper) to protest the Pre-Order politics Amazon is deploying.

5227851,3,B0090SI3EI,"The movie market has been super-saturated with superhero fare for years.  So much so that now Marvel can sustain a studio based on their properties.  There's the rub; they're properties, not original works. We've been here before... so many times.  What can sustain interest here?  Two things: Robert Redford's involvement, and Scarlett Johansson's image problem.

Robert Redford is virtually the last of the old Hollywood stars.  The strangely androgynous post-Tom Cruise generation of leading men just don't cut it.  Never mind that his face is older leather than his trusty saddle, Redford's heavy thatch of blonde hair soldiers on.  As an actor (and especially as a director) he commands respect.  He recently had a hit with ""All Is Lost.""  Presumably his finances are in order, so why did he agree to appear in this superhero film?  Perhaps because the film's theme reflects Redford's sensibilities: the growth of neo-fascism within America's intelligence community.  On the other hand, perhaps he needs a fat paycheck to pay for an independent project.  Who knows?

On another front, someone really, truly hates Scarlett Johansson.  I think it's the cinematographer.  Scarlett the Starlet is filmed from angles which expose her big knobby nose and weak chin.  Moreover, the choreography doesn't disguise her short, stubby proportions.  Her skin looks bad in some scenes, with an orange hue that seems to have come from ""Tan In A Can.""  The straight red hair doesn't help.  She generally doesn't even dress well in most scenes.  Finding the culprit here would be much more interesting than this super-soporific film.",1411516800,2,1621,5.205426356589148

5227857,5,B0090SI3EI,"As the Marvel Universe expands so do the characters. Marvel could not have done a better job than with Captain America:The Winter Soldier.

This film at points does not feel like you are watching a Marvel film. It is a story that involves espionage, sabotage and comic book villainy that actually is very believable. It gives us Captain America pretty much doing SHIELD's dirty work only to find out that the forces of good may not be the best out there. He uncovers a plot that is going to destroy everything that he stands for. To make things worse his past comes back to haunt him in more ways that he would like. The acting is incredible and the story is a real white knuckle thrill ride. It was incredible to see an actor like Robert Redford in this film and it was great to see Black Widow's character get a little more developed. It would have been nice to see Hawkeye make an appearance. Still, the best part of this film was how it ties into the television show Agents of SHIELD, which is something that has never happened before in film history.

While the story of Captain America is far from over, I am unsure if Marvel is ever going to top this one. There is a good chance that not even Avengers: Age of Ultron will upstage it, but I could be wrong.

See this movie Marvel fan or not, it is just a great enjoyable film.",1411516800,,1332,4.32

Now that I have laid all my cards on the table let me tell you why this movie is a must have for your collection. First, the storyline is fantastic, absolutely fantastic when you consider the various issues that confront the government from time to time, corruptions, attacks from within our borders and attacks from without. The integrity of the one ""Captain America"" can overcome the deceit of the many. The character development was also outstanding for filling in events of the past while incorporating the new characters for the future. All of the actors are completely believable in their respective roles. Now the number one reason to buy this movie is that the action sequences are tremendous, from the hand to hand combat, car chases, and gun play will all keep you on the edge of your seat. It also addresses emotional and relationship issues that the females in the family might still latch on to. This movie will take you inside the complete life of an historic national icon as he lives through it. This is a movie that you will learn something new each time you watch it.

Still great non-computerized stunts along with the computer ones.  I like the hand-to-hand fight scenes.  Very fun movie.  I was never a Captain fan as a kid.  He was way too square but the way he's written and portrayed makes him much less moralizing than the comic book.  I'm glad I saw it, you will be too.",1411430400,2,586,4.342592592592593

Scarlett Johansson is on her way to being cast the most in marvel movies as this is the 3rd franchise she's been in.  Something about her didn't seem quiet right in this one though.

I know they tried to make Cap more of a person, but really this guy squeaks when he walks still. He need to loosen up and start breaking the rules with the rest of them.

5228005,5,B0090SI3EI,"Though I may not be very familiar with the comics from which they are based, I have, for the most part, enjoyed the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. From The Avengers, to the more recent Iron Man 3 and Thor 2, the films are consistently fun, and rarely a dull experience. And somehow, Marvel has outdone itself once more with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, creating possibly their most thrilling film to date, with the possible exception of The Avengers. It is the start of what should be a promising summer for movies.

The Winter Soldier takes place approximately 2 years after the events of The Avengers. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is still adjusting to life in the modern world, after being frozen in ice for 70 years after what happened to him in Captain America: The First Avenger. He now works for S.H.I.E.L.D., headed by Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson). But, things are starting to shake up, as an attack is soon made on S.H.I.E.L.Ds own members. It is up to Cap to save the day, along with Natasha Ramanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and newly found friend Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie).

What makes The Winter Soldier so engaging is not only its intense action sequences, but also its refreshingly original story. Think of an espionage thriller similar to The Bourne Identity, in which an evil organization is running beneath a seemingly good one, and is also secretly led by high-level officials, including one named Alexander Pierce (shrewdly played by Robert Redford). The ultimate plan of this evil organization may be one that has been overdone, but the journey to get there is full of twists and turns, even relating back to Captain Americas own past in several ways. It makes what would have been a typical action film into something deeper, where the quiet moments are just as enjoyable as the loud ones.

That being said, this action superhero film is also everything you hoped it would be. Captain America, who seems from the outset to be Marvels most boring superhero, is here a joy to watch. He tumbles around with his powerful star-spangled shield, blocking off bullets while simultaneously slamming bad guys left and right; he sprints across the screen at super speeds, never appearing to tire or slow down; and he kicks and punches with karate and jiu-jitsu moves, with no one standing much of a chance against him.

But, it also appears that Captain America might have met his match, as he soon confronts a powerful soldier with the same abilities as himself, known as the Winter Soldier. The intense battles between the two bring us even to the point where we worry if Cap is going to make it (although planned sequels might already answer that question). Moments like this help to humanize the character, as we realize that, behind the colorful suit, this is also a human being, even if a super-charged one. Chris Evans, who plays Captain America, brings heart and soul to the role.

Completing the trio of superheroes is Black Widow, who was before seen in Iron Man 2 and also The Avengers, and a new character named Falcon who, equipped with a winged flight suit, literally flies across the screen, as his name suggests. The scenes between the three characters are among the most entertaining in the Marvel series, especially in the climactic final battle. And keep an eye out for Nick Fury, who has a much larger role in this film than he has in the past.

The Winter Soldier may be a darker entry in the Marvel series, yet it is still ripe with that light-hearted humor so typical to them, which comes at the most precise moments. It is easy to tell that Anthony and Joe Russo, who direct the film, have a background in comedy, as their timing is always just right. For humor, thrills, action, and even some unexpected emotion, The Winter Soldier is hard to beat.

And be sure to stick around for a scene after the credits, which shows a scene that is a tie-in to what is sure to be another enjoyable entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",1411344000,,3993,4.712034383954155

He believes in fighting for freedom instead of fighting fear and he stands up to Nick Fury, calling him out and questioning all the secrecy behind the new weapons that have been developed. S.H.I.E.L.D. becomes infiltrated by HYDRA and the action scenes and chaos that ensues was phenomenal. I thought the fighting scenes were better thought out and executed than in the first movie. They did not seem so cheesy and fake. Character development was great, Cap was more hardened and not so naive. I liked the Falcon as well, I like how he was implemented and the jet pack/wings effects were awesome! I love how he maneuvered through the sky especially during one of the fighting scenes where he was being shot at! The last part of the story that was moving and emotional was the revelation that Bucky Barnes is not dead. I thought they did a good job bringing this character back.

5228032,5,B0090SI3EI,"I can tell you that it doesn't disappoint...if anything it is better than the first ""Captain America"" movie! The plot and the screenplay are both faithful to the Marvel comics characters; and the story - while just as unbelievable as in most comic book actioners - is totally within the purview of Marvel reality...the fans of Marvel and of Captain America should love it. Chris Evans continues his fine characterization of the Captain; as does Samuel Jackson, as Nick Fury...and there are a couple of outstanding additions to this one. Scarlett Johansson is an inspired choice for Natasha Romanoff, ""The Black Widow"". Although we've seen Johansson in this role in ""Iron Man II"" and in ""The Avengers"" she brings the Black Widow character to fruition in this film, as the Captain's primary sidekick. Anthony Mackie is also a great addition as another sidekick, Sam Wilson, ""The Falcon""...the first black super hero, both in comics and on the big screen. Also look for a fine outing from Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, a corrupt leader within S.H.I.E.L.D....first time I've seen Redford as a villain. Romanian actor, Sebastian Stan also excels as the Captain's primary antagonist, ""The Winter Soldier""...who turns out to be someone from Steve Rogers' past. There are also several bright lights among the support cast, who I suspect we'll see in the next iteration...including the characters played by Cobie Smulders, and Emily VanCamp.

I really like the Captain America story. It makes sense out of the whole Marvel universe along with Spiderman. It's fun, action pack and just down right amazing. I love the when Cap is working with the Black Widow, I think there is a love/relationship connection there that I feel between them. I wish that she had her own film that would be so cool.

Out of the whole film, I think that both Nick's car ride was one of the best scenes in the film and every scene that Cap and Widow had was just simple amazing. Chemistry I see there. Why not those two go out?

One more thing, I really think that this movie should deserve some respect. The Blu-ray disc look like s***. It's just a plan disc with the small name on the left side of the disc. Also it's only in Blu-ray, DVD and a 3D-Blu-Ray, DVD and Ultra-Volt? What the hell? Why not a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack?! This film did a lot better than The Amazing Spiderman 2 and it got the special treatment.  Marvel/Disney studios really drop the ball on this one.

5228111,5,B0090SI3EI,"Well, who doesn't love Chris Evans with his all American good looks, hard body, sense of humor and this grandma thinks he's hot, hot, hot. Captain America, the winter soldier is a really good movie in my book. I thought, before I saw it, that this story wouldn't carry a whole movie w/o Iron Man, Thor and the rest but was I ever wrong. The way in which Chris channels CA is so believable and the fight scenes are ""bar none."" Ouch!!! Didn't even miss the rest of the gang. The story line with his friend Bucky was very good and the cliff hanger in the end leaves me wanting more. I loved this movie and can hardly wait until they make the next one. It was nice to be let into the depth of the characters and the intertwining of the relationships of the characters in the story. Good to see Scarlett and Samuel in their superhero roles. In the extras at the end of the movie it shows Chris and Scarlett with their stunt doubles. The stars give them so much genuine respect and credit. I love, love, love this flick and am a big fan of Marvel, and Chris Evans.",1411257600,,1058,4.216748768472907

5228116,2,B0090SI3EI,"Warning: Spoilers Down Below

 Phase Two of Walt Disneys Marvel movie franchise has been decidedly hit and miss for me on a number of different personal levels (switching from film to digital beginning with the first Avengers movie would be a start), but none more so than Captain America: The Winter Soldier. What it implies both politically and (this extends back to Phase One as well) racially is nothing short of detestable.

 After I first saw the film in theaters back in April, my first reactions were these: the first scene involving Rogers blazing past Wilson several times on a run and then standing over him, hands on his hips, ready for more while Wilson is out of breath is racist, and all the political conspiracy stuff is very supportive (annoyingly so) of Edward Snowden spilling the beans on the NSA. Looking back at a lot of Marvel movies, black characters are usually relegated to supportive, second fiddle roles to the main, white hero. James Rhodes as War Machine in the Iron Man series plays sidekick/second fiddle to the white hero. Heimdall is relegated to supporting the white British guys in the Thor movies. Nick Fury has no choice but to hand over authority to Captain America to destroy SHIELD/HYDRA. That scene when the ""cops"" eye him in that giant car he's driving when he says, ""wanna see my lease?"" doesn't help much either. Even Djimon Hounsou in Guardians of the Galaxy, apparently the only black person in that galaxy, is an evil android lackey. I remember working in a movie theater back when the first Thor came out and all that my Black and Latino friends there could talk about was how awesome Heimdall was when all he really did was kill a couple frost giants after breaking free of the ice Loki had trapped him in. It was like Thor wasn't even in the movie to them. I guess this really shouldnt surprise me given how far back this sort of thing goes (The Green Hornet TV show comes to mind), but it also disappoints me how little things have really progressed over the years. Ill be curious to see how Marvel deals with its inevitable Black Panther film. Will they tell it from his perspective or start with a white outsider who comes to Africa and discovers Black Panther? I wonder.

 Politically, Cap 2 is working in the same vein as Iron Man 3. In that movie, it was implied that our enemies were no longer located overseas (thanks I suspect to Bin Ladens death 2 years prior), but rather were located right here in America (domestic terror). The fact that the Boston Marathon bombings occurred just around a month before IM3 came out is more than a little disturbing (I talk about this at greater length in my review for Star Trek Into Darkness). Cap 2 furthers this idea by implying that the American Intelligence community and the government is being run by a bunch of Nazis trying to spy on everybody. It confuses me that people feel antagonistic against other people working in the government spying on them through technology in Cap 2, but don't raise much concern that one person, Heimdall, as gatekeeper of Asgard, has the power to see and hear almost everything and anything he wants to in the Thor movies. Perhaps because Heimdall is more of a mythical figure with mythical powers who lives in the mythical Asgard and Captain America is grounded in a more real world that Americans can identify more with Cap than Heimdall in that sense. In Cap 2 its implied that any surveillance used against people at all is wrong and everything they do and how they do it should be made public knowledge, yet in Thor: The Dark World, Heimdall actually uses his powers of omnipotence to uncover a stealth attack by the Dark Elves on Asgard. Apparently the Dark Elves were not aware of Heimdalls power or Im sure they would have taken him out first.

 Im pretty sure most people wouldnt mind calling the NSA and government Nazis, especially after the whole Snowden case. I think by implying that in Cap 2, it further cheapens the negative opinions Americans have of the NSA. The NSA is made up of real, hard working people, like you and me, who have jobs and took real, serious oaths right before they began their jobs (which can be found here, http://9websites.com/airforce/oath.htm and here http://uspolitics.about.com/od/usgovernment/a/oaths_of_office_4.htm). It really is a cheap shot by the filmmakers and the people at Disney. Of course, people would talk about shady government conspiracies and laugh and say and know its probably nothing new. Its only when it becomes real that people become scared and angry.

 A few weeks ago I stumbled upon a couple of excellent articles that talked about my views but went into greater detail and took them even further. You can find links to them, and another one on domestic terror, down at the very end. Ill paraphrase some of what they both say. In regards to the title, Captain America is actually himself the Winter Soldier as opposed to Bucky. Bucky is simply called that because of a gimmick in the comics where he gets put on ice whenever he isn't needed. The term Winter Soldier actually comes from the Vietnam War era. It was used by the Vietnam veterans against the war who called their public hearing on US war crimes in Vietnam The Winter Soldier investigation (John Kerry was actually one of them). The Winter Soldiers were formed to counter the Summer Soldiers and Sunshine Patriots, who spread and helped preach the truth that Vietnam was a Just war and that the military had not been committing atrocities. The Winter Soldiers were whistleblowers essentially, just as Captain America and his compatriots are in the movie, just as Snowden was (according to popular public opinion). The title of the movie is not actually in episode format. Captain America is The Winter Soldier, just as he was The First Avenger in his previous solo movie. The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, were brought on to direct the film because their previous work in Arrested Development delivered great political satire on Bush and the Iraq War, and as we all know (or should), comedy is hard, drama is easy, so it would make sense to hire two comedy people to direct something as political as Cap 2 turned out to be (you can read that article here http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/04/captain-america-winter-soldier-obama-kill-list-politics-drones-nsa)

 Paraphrasing some of the other article I mentioned, an interesting scene occurs between Cap and Nick Fury in an elevator. Fury recounts how his grandfather was an elevator operator in NYC who carried a loaded handgun with him walking home. This shows where Fury gets his distrust of people. However, this also shows that Furys distrust is actually very racialized behavior and exposes a very big weakness of the film in that the film stops just short of reminding us that Furys grandfathers world is the very same world that Captain America grew up in (remember hes from Brooklyn). The studio simply refuses to allow Rogers to explore his own racial baggage from having grown up in a segregated North, yet were forced to believe that Rogers has absolutely no comment about this at all?  The closest it ever comes to that is when Rogers tells Wilson that it has taken some getting used to (hilariously, reading the first scene of the abridged version of the screenplay goes where the studio would never in a million years go http://www.the-editing-room.com/captain-america-the-winter-soldier.html), but naturally we just assume he means getting used to other cultural changes, of which he keeps an ever growing and changing list in his pocket.

Other thoughts:

It really does feel like Sam Wilson is physically incompetent next to everybody else. He needs technology, his falcon wings and guns, to really be of any help in a fight. When he fights hand to hand against Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) during the climax, he's clearly outmatched and is only saved when the helicarrier crashes into the building (caused by Cap).

Clearly all of this came out in the earlier half of 2014 and back before that, before ISIS came into the American vocabulary. Depending on how long that mess goes on overseas, I wonder if Disney and Marvel will again shift their views in their films to implying our enemies are overseas again as opposed to domestic.

The Helicarrier crashing into the Triskelion was another thing I disliked. Can we just move on past the whole 9/11 thing already? Do we really need to twist images like that around to mean we should be tearing down the walls of secrecy?

5228183,3,B0090SI3EI,"The film is decent as far as visuals and action but it gets too bogged down with an unnecessarily heavy plot. Personal, I thought The Black Widow looked way too tan for a Russian superhero.  Scarlet Johanson also looked a bit overly weary, even in scenes where exhaustion was not required. And her hair? It looked crappy. More importantly, I don't get Caps powers. In the Avengers, he is able to fight the likes of Loki in hand to hand combat along with withstanding the Asgardian power of Thor's hammer. In this film, he has trouble fighting  well trained soldiers one on one. In the Avengers he jumped out of a high flying moving plane only to somehow land on his feet(we never see where he landed, he just appears in the tree). This film has him getting pretty banged up in high jumping scenes. The shield wielding action is puzzling too. He catches it at full force when tossed back at him by a super villian which should have split his hand open( remember, this shield stuck in a steel wall). In this case, Cap has Superman style strength. Actually, this scene  depicts a more comic centered portrayal of Captain America.  In this movie, one minute his powers are watered down (as in the first film), and other times he's mega strong. It's just inconsistent and if you enjoy superhero films, you want accuracy on a relatable level.

The Falcon was great. Every scene he was in gave added momentum to the film. His ambitious attitude presented an innocent but powerful display of a superhero in the making. I'm a big fan of The Falcon and other black superheroes from 1970s Marvel comics. I'm looking forward to a spruced up Falcon costume along with some new tricks. It was interesting to see Robert Redford in a film such as this, and it worked for the most part. He had a physical frailness to him that I felt was the only draw back. He is an older gentlemen , I understand that, but it almost looked like the filmmakers said, ""hey, lets toss this famous actor in the film no matter what.""

Captain America needed work in the consistency of powers area along with a less burdening sense of dialogue. Both shortcomings affected my viewing experience.",1411084800,2,2156,4.572538860103627

5228186,5,B0090SI3EI,"This could possibly be the best superhero movie of all time.  This ranks right up there with Batman Begins and X2.  The film has it all.  It's got tons of action, special effects, great casting, etc. However, what separates it from other hero movies is the plot.  Someone put some real effort into it, that's for sure.  It's a scenario that is not all that different with what's going on today with PRISM and the Patriot Act.  Great stuff.  There are even some good plot twists that keep things interesting.  I love what they did with the Steve Rogers character.  He's not a 2 dimensional cardboard cutout, like Ghost Rider.  Not at all.  You really care about these characters, and that always makes a movie better.  Loved the villains as well.  The Winter Soldier character was terrific as well.

To me, this represents the gold standard for Superhero movies and action films in general.  You can still have explosions and fight scenes wrapped around a good plot and come out with a very entertaining film.  The polar opposite of this would be Transformers:Extinction.

Chris Evans turns in a solid performance as the Cap, a modern day boy scout that just happens to be a super soldier as well...  and there are many odes to his past that touch your heart as you feel just how alone the Captain truly is in the modern age.  And was that some heat that I detected between Evans' Captain America and Scarlett Johanssen's Black Widow?...

Samuel L. Jackson is as ""Fury-ous"" as ever, and there's plenty of plot twists and intrigue to keep you interested.

5228221,5,B0090SI3EI,"I watched the crap out of this movie. When it first came out in theaters, I couldn't wait for it to hit DVD so I could get it an watch it again. I say that about a lot of movies I like, but usually my interest for them kind of fades after a while and I end up either not getting them, or not watching them after I do get them on DVD. Not the case with Winter Soldier. I watched it this morning again, finishing it five minutes before I had to leave for work... and now I want to watch it again.... hehe.

But seriously. CA: Winter Soldier... or CA2, was probably one of the best comic action movies in the last 5 years. What's so different about CA2 from the Avengers? Not all that much really, except that Captain America is kind of alone. So what's different about CA2 from CA1? Its totally different... and totally the same. The first Captain America was a period based movie during the second World War, and basically the creating of a hero, based around the fall of Hydra. The second Captain America dealt with Hydra again, but this time Steve Rogers was a little older and a little wiser. He was looking at the past in a way very few heros have ever gotten the opportunity to--as a living relic. There was that surreal moment when he went to a museum exhibit about himself and saw a boy who recognized him in the crowd. And quietly, like Steve does, signaled for the boy to keep it a secret. It says something about Steve Rogers as a character... always the silent hero. And this movie was very much about that internal compass and heroism that fuels Steve Rogers.

If watching Shield implode on itself, Natasha do crazy amazing stuff, and Sam Wilson fly on a pair of incredible metal wings through a bunch of explosions doesn't sell you, along with all the crazy stuff Steve Rogers does... there's the fact that Natasha ended up in Steve's arms like four times. Yes, there's even a cute factor in this movie. And if that doesn't do it for you, there's always Bucky. So you see... plenty to love about this movie.

But I think what made this movie really great wasn't just the fact that we were watching yet another hero trying to battle some unknown evil. Steve was battling the organization that brought him back and gave him a purpose... and yet even that organization wasn't totally evil. Even the weakest in that organization rose up to fight the good fight.",1410998400,,2369,4.3917995444191344

5228223,5,B0090SI3EI,"This is an excellent portrayal of Steve Rogers as Captain America. They did, occasionally, over-due it in the action parts of the movie, but I can't blame them since this show is trying to bring in everyone of all ages (teens +), not just the die-hard comic fans. This part of Captain America really 'zooms' closer into the skill and raw power of Steve Rogers without utterly making him a corny dude with a costume on swinging a shield around. Anyways, I would recommend this movie to anyone who gets a kick out of marvel movies or to anyone who enjoys suspense, action, and/or conspiracy theories. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I have!",1410998400,,645,4.521367521367521

5228231,4,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier tells a very entertaining, surprisingly intelligent story (for a superhero film) involving themes of government espionage, distrust, and police state/military practices, all while not being too overly cerebral to not be an engaging action film. Picking up time wise where the Avengers movie left off, Steve Rogers/Captain America is still trying to find his place in modern times (having been awoken from his WW2-era cryofreeze), all the while going on insanely cool missions involving punching, kicking and shield-throwing (and I have yet to quite figure out how he can do impossible feats like jump thousands of feet through the air from an airplane into the ocean and survive, or smash out of buildings and slam hundreds of feet through glass onto concrete, and yet bullets still hurt him?  Eh, minor details and the film was cool enough to ignore this...)

The big ""mystery"" of the identify of the Winter Soldier antagonist wasn't that big of a deal to anyone who watched the first film, or who didn't catch the blatantly obviously setup in the ""Captain America museum"" sequence, but he did turn out to be an incredibly nasty bad guy, and you really wanted to see Cap take this creep down. A great film involves not just a great hero but a great villain, and this film really met the mark.  Robert Redford's character was also well-developed and entertaining (with, I thought, subtle shades of his Bob Woodward character from 'All the President's Men').

The Falcon character was a fun addition to the story, in a way evoking the feel of an Iron Man-type character flying around dodging explosions, and he paired well with Captain America, although I couldn't help but pick up the subtle narrative of the military advertisement that seems to stem from many of these big-budget Hollywood action films (see for instance the Transformers films, G.I.Joe, Man of Steel, etc, for more of that nuanced advertising.) The Falcon character ultimately worked, but was forgettable enough that if there's a Cap 3 he wouldn't necessarily be needed for the story.

Also, the romantic subplot seemed a little convoluted with the Natasha/Black Widow character. From the beginning, her constantly asking Steve about who he was dating, or shares important dialog in close quarters (or even the scene with the kiss on the escalator) and it all seemed to be building some sort of romantic tension between the two characters, and yet the film never really did anything with this. The whole idea just seemed to be pushed aside for more action/punching/kicking/explosions, and this is disappointing as I think this relationship would have been an interesting dynamic to explore.

The final battle sequence gets a little heavy with the CG flying battleships, but we do see an entertaining (albeit predictable) resolution of the Captain/Winter Soldier conflict, with plenty of questions left hanging by the end of the film (be sure to watch both of the segments hidden in the credits for a little bit of resolution). Captain America: Winter Soldier was a lot of fun, and surprisingly intelligent, but I would caution that, unlike the first one, this was just graphic enough with fighting, shooting and a few deaths, to not be appropriate for small kids and probably more appropriate for older viewers.",1410998400,,3315,5.04014598540146

5228300,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier will turn the Marvel Cinematic Universe upside down! In this installment Steve Rogers must struggle to embrace his role in the modern world while he battles a new threat from old history: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier.  Joe Simon and Jack Kirby are the ones who created the comic characters that were used for the film while Ed Brubaker came up with the concept and story.  Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely where the ones who wrote the screenplay for this installment.  There were two directors for this film and they are Anthony and Joe Russo  who are both known for directing films and TV shows such as You, Me and Dupree and Comunity.

Steve Rogers (Chris Evans)  is trying to find a way to deal with the fact that things are different in modern-day America.  50 years causes a lot of things to change and while trying to deal with the change a new threat against S.H.I.E.L.D. arises called The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan).  S.H.I.E.L.D.  is unsure where the origins of this Winter Soldier  are and he is just as powerful as Captain America.  Things get worse when S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is murdered. .  With little time to spare Captain America decides to launch an investigation into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s origins and it has him returning to the very Army base where he once underwent basic training nearly 100 years ago. What he and Romanoff discover there leads to a very startling development with S.H.I.E.L.D., a top-secret project called ""Operation Insight"", and the launch of the next generation of Helicarrier. It is here where things go wrong and Agent Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America are betrayed and left for dead.  They escape and now know that S.H.I.E.L.D. and now know something isn't right, so they go and in list the help of Sam Wilson/ Falcon (Anthony Mackie) who has a unique talent that comes in very handy. Can all of them stop the launch of the next generation of Helicarriers before it's too late??

o-CAPTAIN-AMERICA-THE-WINTER-SOLDIER-900

This film takes everything you knew about the Marvel Cinematic Universe and shakes it up.  It starts off with Steve Rogers meeting Sam Wilson for the first time and you see Rogers lapping Wilson over and over again showing you how incredibly in shape Rogers actually is.  Then Rogers must go because duty calls and that is where he meets up with Agent Romanoff and they go on a mission to save some shield agents, (or at least that is what Rogers is told).  At the beginning Rogers and his team are flying over their target and he just jumps out of the plane with no parachute which shocks everyone.  Then you get to see Rogers take on almost everyone on the ship by himself using mainly hand to hand combat and throwing his shield around.  You finally get to see the shield used a little bit more than just a shield and what it can do is awesome.  It is at the end of rescuing everyone captured on the ship that Rogers realizes that Agent Romanoff had a separate mission that he was not aware of and that doesn't fly well with him.  He goes to see Nick Fury and express his feeling about this and it is there where he learns that S.H.I.E.L.D. is building Helicarriers that will protect via ""fear"" according to Rogers.  This is where Fury has started to second guess what S.H.I.E.L.D. is doing so he asks his friend Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), who is part of the World Council, to postpone the production of project Insight.  Then there is an awesome car chase seen that ends with Nick Fury being attacked in his car but he somehow manages to escape.  Not knowing who to trust he goes to Rogers place to talk to him.  Knowing that everything is bugged there he talks via text until he is shot, but not before he was able to give Rogers a USB drive.

Wanting to find out who tried to assassinate Fury, Pierce asks Rogers a bunch of questions but is unable to get any answers out of him which leads to one of the most amazing fight scenes I have ever seen.  I say that because it all occurs in just the space of an elevator.  It all begins with Captain America saying ""Before we get started, does anyone want to get out?""  Nobody does and then he beats the crap out of everyone in the elevator leaving it looking like the photo below.

captain-america-the-winter-soldier-teaser-trailer-elevator-fight-3

It gets even better from there as now Captain America is considered a fugitive and must figure things out on this own with only the help of Black Widow.  The two of them both go to Rogers old training facility and there is a secret underground facility that has a computer in which the USB drive, that Fury gave him, goes into.  It is there that they realize, through the computer that has the mind of Dr. Arnim Zola (Toby Jones), that things get crazy.  They plan on using the Helicarriers to murder any ""potential"" threats based off their past.  While learning all this Rogers and Agent Romenoff are almost killed. The two of them go to the only one that they can trust, which is Rogers new friend Sam Wilson, and that is where he joins up with the two of them to try to stop the horrible plans that they have learned.

Now the entire film was amazing, it was full of action, and cast with amazing chemistry.  The only thing that bothered me was a scene close to the ending because it was set up exactly like the first Captain America film.  Now I won't tell you anymore about it than that because I don't want to spoil it for you.  It just seems ridiculous to me that things happen very similar to Captain America that could determine the outcome on his life.

Overall though I would give this film an A+ because it is something that I could watch over and over again and enjoy it every time while believing it along the way.  It also changed the way of thinking for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe which was epic especially if you were one of the many watching ABC's Marvel Agent's Of S.H.I.E.L.D.  If you have not seen this yet... YOU MUST.

  A few things that bothered me:  too much fighting. Seems like every battle was ""epic"" and could have been replaced by more creative story-line. Also, you will notice that some of the injuries would just magically be healed or go away if it didn't fit the next scene.
Plus the whole Captain America won't fight his ""buddy"" thing did not line up with his trying to defend the World.

5228311,4,B0090SI3EI,"Marvel and Walt Disney Home Entertainment give fans the chance to watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier over and over as they unleash it on Blu-ray and DVD. I knew I had to experience all the fun and excitement again as quickly as possible when I saw it in theaters. The time has come and after viewing it for a second time, I can say that its one of the few times a sequel comes very close to topping its predecessor.

Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) have continued to work for Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of ""The Avengers."" When it's discovered that the evil organization Hydra is still running strong and has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., Cap and Widow go rogue to help discover who the enemy plants are. They team up with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and find themselves confronting a powerful assassin named the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) as they embark on their mission.

The Blu-ray version of Captain America: The Winter Soldier is presented in 1080p high-definition (2.40:1) with 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. The picture quality is superb and a real treat for the eyes with so much frenetic action, spectacular stunts, and explosions happening in front of you. The surround sound keeps you grounded in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with bombastic blasts and noises and a score that blends together elements of pulsing electronic music with classic symphonic arrangements.

Theres some interesting bonus material included for the Captain America: The Winter Soldier Blu-ray edition. Audio commentary is provided by Directors Anthony and Joe Russo with Screenwriters Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. Two featurettes entitled ""On the Front Line: An Inside Look at Captain America's Battlegrounds"" and ""On Set with Anthony Mackie: Cut the Check!"" take viewers behind the scenes of the movie.

Four different deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary from the Russo Brothers are found as well. Theyre made up of ""Hill and Sitwell Talk Loyalty,"" ""In Pursuit of Captain America,"" ""Nick Fury's Circle,"" and ""Widow Reveals Her Past."" We also get an inside look at ""Steve Rogers' Notebook."" A gag real rounds out the special features.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence, gunplay and action throughout. A lot of stuff gets blown up and many people get shot. However, there isn't much blood to be seen. Parents might also want to know theres a little bad language to be heard.

Although it differs greatly in tone from the first movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an exceptionally well crafted continuation that perfectly complements its forerunner and The Avengers. While The First Avenger was a patriotic period piece, its follow-up is a modern day spy and espionage thriller that packs a sizeable punch with all its non-stop action and solid pacing.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier is available now on 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, DVD, and as a Digital Download.",1410825600,,3008,5.114052953156823
5228312,4,B0090SI3EI,"Hello all
I just got the  Two disc Special Edition Blu Ray of Captain America The Winter Soldier Let me say first off That I saw the movie in theaters and it rocked. IT was an earthquake and it changed a lot about the marvel Universe. It had a lot of Easter eggs for the fans and now that you can see it at home looking over every scene you will find a lot of them. The movie is full of action, suspense, and thrills and scarlett Johanson, Samuel L Jackson, Cobie Smouthers and the other supporting cast members are excellent and but Robert Redford as a villain and Sebastan Stan as The brainwashed Winter Soldier were excellent villains and proved they were the threat cap needed to defeat. The special features I liked from the gag reel was nice, the commentary is as most commentary for movies, the deleted scenes were great and the extended scenes were ok, however I must say I am a little disappointed in Marvel.
 This has been the first movie to not have a marvel one shot and I really like this short films. I feel it did a real big disservice to the movie not have one on especially when the movie left a lot open for many one shots. I hope that when Guardians of the Galaxy makes of for this when they come out on Blu ray but still it was a major disservice in my opinion to a great movie.

The movie itself has a classic (read: comic book) Captain America feel.  The Cap'n slings his famous shield a lot, and as a fan of the comics (circa the 1960's) that felt... 'right' somehow.  There are some hard-to-swallow points in the film (like one of the stars getting shot 3 times and then flying a helicopter a few days later), but overall I think this is a great way to spend a couple of hours.",1410825600,,575,4.345794392523365

The 3D conversion is very well done in my opinion. There are no gimmicky or ear-plucking effects that I remember, just a greater sense of immersion than one gets with the 2D version.

The 2D version also has its merits, since 3D sacrifices horizontal resolution. When watching in 2D on BluRay, the definition is very clear, so much so that one can read the text on various computer & heads-up displays - a fun thing to do (if you're a geek) after you've watched through the movie a couple of times.

5228397,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America The Winter Soldier is the film I was most excited to see this year.  When the film came out everyone said it was a spectacular film.  People even said that it was the best Marvel movie thus far.  When I saw the film I thought it was a very good film.  I like it a little more than the first film.  However, I do not think it was the end-all-be-all of Marvel films.  I personally like the first Iron Man and Thor more.  I think I raised my expectations a little too high.  I guess thats what I get for listening to reviews before viewing the film first.  It probably had to do with the bad crowd I saw the film with as well.

The film takes place sometime after Avengers.  Steve Rodgers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) is trying his best to adjust to life in the modern era.  Most of his friends and family from his era are now dead or dying and he finds himself alone.  He also finds that the modern era is not as simple or as black and white as his era was.  He finds himself being challenged both physically and morally.  His moral code gets challenged a lot in this film.  While he is dealing with this it is made clear that S.H.E.I.L.D. has been compromised by an unknown enemy and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is being targeted.  Now Captain America and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) must uncover this mystery and stop them.

There is a lot to praise about this movie.  The film is very well made and plotted.  The film has a faster start than the first movie.  The first film started off a bit slow because it is an origin story.  However, since we now know the characters, this film starts off right in the action.  There are a few things that are upped from the first Captain America film.  The special effects are better as well as the action.  The action is bigger, more exciting, and better choreographed.  The fight between Captain America and the Winter Soldier is much better than his fight with Red Skull in the first film.  This is also a deeper film.  The first film was a usual stop the bad guy type of movie (though a good one).  This one there is more of a shade of grey and it is more layered.

I also like how they handled the characters.  Steve Rodgers really never changes or grows throughout the film.  Normally this would be a bad thing, but here it was the right call.  Steve does not grow or change because he does not need to.  He does go through a character ark of whether his morals methods are outdated in this new time.  He also goes through the hardship of knowing that his old world is gone.  However he decides that his methods are still necessary and are still right.  He decides not to let the world change him which I thought was the right move.  I also like how Black Widow and Nick Fury get bigger roles in this film.  Also, Steves new sidekick called Falcon is awesome.  He is a great addition to the cast.

I still have a couple issues, but most are nitpicks.  The film does have some passing issues in the middle.  They are not big but I found some scenes to be a bit slow.  The other issue I have is with The Winter Soldier himself.  The Winter Soldier is an awesome villain but he is not given enough to do.  His name is in the title but he is not in the film that much.  Plus, in regarding to main villain plot, he is not that important to the overall story.  He is important when it comes to Steves character, but I wish he played a bigger role in the overall plot.  Also, his backstory was rushed.

Overall, despite some issues I have, The Winter Soldier is a great superhero film and a great film in general.  I do highly recommend it.  I do not think it is the best Marvel movie overall, but it is one of the best.  I will say I like this better than First Avenger, Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, Incredible Hulk, Thor 2, and even The Avengers.",1410739200,,3810,4.204986149584488

5228404,4,B0090SI3EI,"This makes a really nice follow-up to The First Avenger, which itself is a solid cross between superhero movie and World War II movie. Make no mistakethe Captain is no longer in a simple battle against a Nazi officer. Somethings not quite right with SHIELD, the organization meant to protect people from super-powered threats.

The paranoid-conspiracy-thriller style of the story lends itself to a twisting, winding plot that goes to all sorts of places without seeming to be overly contrived. It might even make you think about what you are willing to compromise to either live safely or live freely. You also get to see how the complicated scenario challenges the Captains idealism for truth, justice, and the American way. Speaking of characters, they are all ably portrayed.

Of course, there are also the fancy effects and the action set-pieces. The gunfights, the explosions, the chases, the all-out melees, and the duels are wild. The climax with the giant flying machines is, quite naturally, a highlight. The mind boggles over what well see in next years Avengers: Age of Ultron. In the meantime, let me just say that this movie is solid.",1410739200,,1147,4.96875
5228405,4,B0090SI3EI,"First off, I saw in some of the blurbs that people were saying this movie is better than The Avengers, and I definitely disagree with that assessment. The Avengers had a whole CAST of superheroes, including Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, fighting a full scale alien invasion of New York city. This movie features one superhero fighting one nefarious government organization, although the organization in question is very resourceful and nefarious indeed.

There are so many plot twists in this film, I can't really describe the storyline without ruining it. I read that it was ""inspired"" by 70's government conspiracy films like Three Days of the Condor, and it definitely seems like it was. Basically everybody is out to betray everybody at some point in this film. To be honest, the intrigue came so quick and fast that I had a hard time keeping up with it, what with my frequent bathroom breaks and messing around on my phone. I guess I shouldn't knock it for that, since I didn't give it my full attention, but I will anyway. It's not a film to multitask with.

The action is, as expected, big and loud, although not quite as compelling as one of the Marvel movies where the main character has actual ""superpowers,"" like Spider-Man swinging through the Big Apple on webs or the Incredible Hulk shrugging off bullets. Captain America's foil, the titular ""winter soldier,"" is more like a cypher than an actual character, and although they try to flesh him out a bit near the end he comes off as rather cardboard and uninspiring. He also allows himself to be manipulated in a way that seems absolutely counter-productive and confusing to me. He looks awfully cool, though.

Scarlett Johannsen is in this film also, reprising her role as the Black Widow, looking as hot as ever. There's a little sexual tension between her and Captain America that I could appreciate, given that their relationship never moves beyond the platonic. Oh, how I know that place so well! Anyway, I suppose her and the handsome fellow who plays Cap turn in acceptable acting jobs, although nothing to write home about. They're surprised and shocked in the appropriate spots, but nothing really emotional or demanding is expected of them. And the ""mastermind"" villain does a pretty good job of leaving the scenery intact, instead of chewing it all to hell.

All in all I say this movie is definitely incredibly action-packed and fun to watch, although a little confusing if you don't play close attention. I think I liked the first one a little better, though, simply because it featured Hugo Weaving playing the Red Skull. I guess if you were to evaluate the movies ""objectively,"" however, Winter Soldier would have to come out on top. I'd have to say I give it a definite ""thumbs up,"" and four stars out of five.",1410739200,,2793,4.77639751552795

5228408,5,B0090SI3EI,Far better than the prequel and possible every other Marvel movie excluding Spiderman 2 (with Toby Macguire),1410739200,,108,5.411764705882353
5228409,5,B0090SI3EI,"There has been a ton of hype about the recently released (and very successful) ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" film.  Needless to say, the film did manage to live up to the hype and showed that Marvel could take characters that are fairly unknown out of comic reading circles and make an excellent film with them.  I saw it and I loved it, but the real shining star in Marvel's cinematic releases this year has got to be ""Captain America:  The Winter Soldier.""

Cap's first film was very good, but I felt as if it (as well as the first Thor film) was rushed along and used more to lead up to the heavily anticipated ""The Avengers"" instead of giving us a decent story about the hero.  In ""The Avengers,"" Cap took a backseat to the other players, with most of the action going to heavies like Thor, Hulk, and Iron Man.  This time around, Cap leads the story and never lets go of that lead.

""The Winter Soldier"" is not heavily laden in CGI or even close to as humorous as ""GOTG"" is, but it is an excellent espionage thriller with a major whodunit plot that perfectly addresses similar actions happening in our world now, a brilliant cast, and excellent direction.

The film takes a look at Cap's world post-New York incident (""The Avengers"").  S.H.I.E.L.D. is taking measures to not only protect the United States, but the world.  When Cap finds out what S.H.I.E.L.D. is up to, he instantly questions the reasoning behind it.  Soon enough, Captain Steve Rogers finds himself on the run with few clues, fewer friends, and a very nasty group of villains hot on his heels.  I honestly cannot say too much more than this since revealing the enemy in this film would ruin it overall.  Just know that if you haven't seen the film in theaters (I did, but am just now getting around to my review after buying the Blu-ray), you're in for a surprise.

Oh, and that whole Winter Soldier bit?  It's pretty important as well, as the Winter Soldier is a key member of the enemy's arsenal, and he more than holds his own against Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, and even old Nick Fury.

Watching this film reminded me of the spy flicks and political thrillers that came out during the 70's and 80's.  It's fast-paced, there's a constant threat, and the resolution leaves you with more questions (that I'm sure will be resolved throughout the other Marvel films) than answers.

The cast is solid.  Chris Evans nails his role as the Captain once again, and I still can't get over how brilliant he is in the role.  There is no other Steve Rogers as far as I'm concerned.  Evans is it!  Scarlett Johansson does a fine job once again as Black Widow.  We get to see a little bit more about her character (especially in the deleted scenes), and she brings a bit of humor to the film much like she did in ""The Avengers.""  Anthony Mackie introduces us to Falcon, a soldier who counsels fellow soldiers that are trying to adapt back into their former civilian lives.  Falcon gets back into uniform to help the Captain when friends are far and few between.  Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role as Nick Fury, and even though he's put this character on multiple times, he gives us an even deeper look at Fury in brief sequences with Rogers and other characters in the film.

Sebastian Stan portrays the Winter Soldier.  Fans of the comics know this character's real identity, but for those of you unaware, I won't reveal who he really is.  Just know that his battle with Captain America becomes very personal and is intense both physically and emotionally for both of them.  I hope to see more of the Winter Soldier in later films.  Another brilliant castmember is the legendary Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, head of S.H.I.E.L.D.  Sadly, that's all I can really say about him without giving away too much.

There are a lot of supporting actors and actresses that did brilliant jobs as well.  Most notably, Frank Grillo, Cobie Smulders, Hayley Atwell, Emily VanCamp, and Toby Jones.  There are others, but the list is much too long.

Simply put, this film is brilliant.  The direction was great.  The production layed off of the CGI as much as possible and used real props for most of the scenes (even many parts of the bigger action scenes).  The story took the front seat while the gee-whiz factor took a step back.  It's literally a superhero film with a very real and grounded superhero.

Highly recommended.",1410739200,,4386,4.5933075933075935

The fight scenes were so-so, but helped to take your mind off of the corny, cliched, predictable dialogue. If this was the best marvel movie to date, as some have suggested, I would say that would be because the others have set the bar low. Based on this critique you might assume that I hated the movie.

While I was sort of luke-warm with the first Captain America movie, I had higher hopes for this one. I had read the source material for the Winter Soldier and was a big fan of that story line. I knew they were going to incorporate Scarlett Johansen's Black Widow into a large part of the movie and would also be introducing the character of Sam Wilson - aka The Falcon. The movie previews looked great, and it had been a very long wait for this to debut on video disc. And the wait was completely worth it!

This movie was fantastic! Great writing, great acting, great cast, great action sequences, great effects, and a very satisfying story line from start to finish. I enjoyed this movie immensely, and even having just watched it, wouldn't hesitate to watch it again, tomorrow. I loved it and would almost say that I enjoyed it better than The Avengers. However, some of my enthusiasm is probably based on the newness of the movie, so I can't say that with absolute certainty. Avengers may have been a bit more fun, but this movie was enjoyable on a more serious level. I highly recommend this movie to all fans of the genre!

Video: The movie is presented in 2:40 anamorphic widescreen and is an excellent transfer.

Audio: English, French, and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.

Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, and French

Extras:
The dvd edition has one deleted scene ('In Pursuit of Captain America') and the non-essential 3 min 'Steve Rogers' Notebook'.

It is hard to believe that the 18 additional minutes of extras could not be included on the dvd. There is plenty of room on the dvd for all the extras AND the commentary. The absence must be part of some evil plan that Hydra is cooking up.

If you really love extras you may want to buy the bluray. It has the above extras PLUS...

* An essential audio commentary with directors Anthony and Joe Russo; and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. The commentary is very informative and it is a shame this wasn't included on the dvd edition.

The rest of the extras are nothing too essential...

* On the Front Line: An Inside Look at Captain America's Battlegrounds (10 minutes)

5228432,2,B0090SI3EI,"Comic Book level violence, where people are squashed like bugs or dispatched with a few deft kicks and punches makes up the major portion of this film.  It's dark, sad, angry, and doesn't even end with a message of hope for the future.  All the characters, even the ""good guys"" relentlessly injure and kill others with a cold detachment as they fight their way through the film.  After a while I found the incredible body count overwhelming and distasteful and then I remembered: oh yeah, it's a comic book!  So I lowered my expectations and just spent most of the film fast-forwarding through all the wreckage, hoping the ending would be satisfying.  Nope.",1410652800,2,657,4.778761061946903

5228476,5,B0090SI3EI,"In the sequel to the first Captain America, in CA: Winter Soldier, Steve Rogers (Evans) struggles to embrace his role in the modern world and battles a new threat from old history, the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier.

When I originally watched the first Captain America, I thought it was one of the better if not best Marvel Comic adaptations that had been done. Considering some of the movies that has included that I enjoyed a lot, that says something to me. The first movie provided a great background story that allowed both the Avengers storyline and CA to have their own intertwining stories that both stand alone and link together.

Winter Soldier like the original has great special effects and fantastic set design, great action with a bit of humor thrown in and of course Stan Lee thrown into the mix somewhere. This sequel also provides a worthy adversary and ends in a climatic battle that you would expect in this type of movie. The conspiracy within story is well done and the story throughout keeps you entertained all the way through.

Evans has done well at embracing the role, and in this sequel you can tell he feels more comfortable in playing the character and his own issues in dealing with being in the modern world and reflecting on his past while he questions his values and whether or not he can live up to them in a world that is not so black and white. As a character, I came to appreciate how well written and well acted CA has been done, becoming a favorite of mine along with Downey's version of Iron Man.

CA is a movie that does well standing on its own as its own story and is action packed, well written and a fun time. Although there are moments of predictability, it didn't detract from me thoroughly enjoying the film and waiting for the 3rd installment. If you like superhero type movies, then this is one you won't be disappointed in watching.",1410652800,,1893,4.542521994134898

5228493,5,B0090SI3EI,"Finally, I got to see this! This was one of my most anticipated movies this year, and boy was it worth the wait! In this latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America and a few friends take on S.H.I.E.L.D. after an assassination attempt on Nick Fury. Along the way, he uncovers some secrets that fundamentally change his understanding of how he thought things were. That's probably all the plot you need going in, because to say anymore would spoil the experience. Everything and everyone fires on all cylinders here. Chris Evans is outstanding as Captain America, as well as Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon. What I appreciated most was the attention to character development in addition to the jaw-dropping action sequences. But what surprised me was how smart this film actually is. The basic premise of the film, you could say, is ""ripped from the headlines."" With the NSA scandals and privacy vs. security debate currently going on in the US, this film couldn't be more timely. It also fits in nicely with the other films in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. While the story is self-contained, there are nods to other Marvel characters and past events so that everything ties together quite well. Honestly, there's not too much more I can really say about it, except that if you haven't seen it you don't know what you're missing. Also, as expected with comic book films these days, don't forget to stay for the mid- and post-credits sequences, which hint at things to come.",1410652800,3,1538,4.9192307692307695

The action is terrific in this film. Sure, car chases, gun battles, and secrets have all been done before, but they take the action way above all other films. The plot is not hard to follow, but that is not a bad thing. It is paced just right to go along with the character of Captain America. Sometimes films try to have too many plot twists and it just becomes confusing or doesn't make any sense at all, but this movie has a good twist to it that fits so well. Of course Samuel L. Jackson is brilliant as the elusive Nick Fury, and Scarlett Johansson is perfect as the Black Widow. New comer to the franchise, Anthony Mackie, is great as the Falcon, and Sebastian Stan is excellent as the Winter Soldier. To me, there are no bad actors in this film.

It's the most personal, the best-written, and it draws on some very fine source material. Ed Brubaker's cameo appearance was nice to see. Sam and Natasha's roles were delightful. Nick Fury is a badass again. For someone who definitely isn't Captain America, Bucky sure did spend a lot of time holding that shield. How much foreshadowing do we want to read into THAT one?

5228588,3,B0090SI3EI,"I loved Captain America:The First Avenger. It was a good story, did not take itself too seriously and it had everything you would expect in a movie featuring Captain America.  Unfortunately Winter Soldier  feels hurried. They were trying to fit in Bucky Barnes resurrection as a equally powerful opposite to C.A.  And its always a dead give away when a major star like Robert Redford stars in a film as a newcomer to a Black Ops organization, showing such fatherly concern that its no suprise that in the end Ta Da he is so the traitor, the mole. This is a cliched tactics used in movies a hundred times. Then we get the Professor who worked for Red Skull, still alive in a way on computer, not unlike Helena Bonham Carter in Skynet:Salvation. Somehow between the end of WW2 and today, Hydra has managed to infiltrate everything and even put Nick Fury into retirement. But the knowledge gap, the build up of expectation of how Hydra moved forward, how did Shield suddenly become such an easy mark. There seems to be too much information and not much back ground other then one line here or there that gives you hints as to what has happened but its really glossed over. In the Avengers everything from Lokis appearance to the end made sense and was one great moment to the next.

Not enough focus on Bucky Barnes other then quick flashback at his capture, mutilation and brainwash all in a minutes time, the whole movie seemed to basically jump from one happening to another, making one ask Whoa, how did we suddenly arrive here to this juncture.?

Overall I did like Winter Soldier but not as much as I thought I would.  If the Winter Soldier was more in the forefront of the movie as it is sub-named Winter Soldier, instead of appearing and disappearing constantly thru the move, threatening but yet not menacing enough then maybe I would like it a little more. The Avengers had dozens of Characters doing their thing and yet the movie flowed seamlessly showing them operating in a team effort. Here it was about C.A. best friend and basically chugged along at snails pace most of the time. They sure were quick to destroy Shield and put Samuel Jacksons Nick Fury to pasture. He only has a cameo in the next Avengers film and that's a real stupidit, as he was an amazing presence which made you feel things would turn out alright. I think Shield could have starred in couple more movies and not need to be introduced in one and then put out of the Franchise in the next.",1410480000,6,2472,4.531390134529148

5228591,5,B0090SI3EI,"This is a step up from the first Captain America, which I thought was very good. This film, however, is great. Chris Evans, who I hated in The Fantastic Four, is just about flawless in the title role. He is no longer the totally naive to a fault soldier but rather a more modern, assimilating humorous character in search of himself. I doubt he will get the recognition he deserves but I would rank it as amongst the very best ever in a superhero film. The rest of the cast is also good but special mention should be given to Robert Redford. Again, I am not a big fan but he is also very good as the bad guy. There is also the Winter Soldier, who is also the bad guy. He is very effective but won't spoil anything about him.
The effects are just astonishing. And they are beautiful. A lot of CGI films, like The Avengers, I get weary watching. Not so with this film.
There is a very touching scene early on when Steve visits Peggy Carter that gave a depth to the character, and the film, I didn't expect. Peggy is now at least in her 90s and while age and circumstance have conspired to keep them apart, their love feels genuine and when Steve says 'Well I couldn't leave my best girl, now when she owes me a dance.', he means it. Not the typical scene in a superhero film. Again, both actors are exceptional.
This film feels more like a DC epic film and that is high praise coming from me.
My only criticism is minor. I didn't feel like the Falcon character quite fit. Or was necessary.

The effects of the 3D in this movie are up there in my top 5. Pacific Rim being #1.  I ripped it to a 19gig file with DVDFab and the picture is almost too clear as i can see some makeup on Captain America but its not a big deal.

Love the movie before and even more now. I have watched this movie around 5 times and last night was my first time watching it in 3D on my tv and i will tell you now that i will probably watch it another 5 times in 3D.

Mild Spoiler alert:

First on the list:

The Winter Soldier turns out to be ghost from Cap's past that comes back to haunt him

Nick Fury turns out to be a target on the Winter Soldier's list.

Chaos ensues.

Second:

Sam Wilson, Cap's super hero partner has a good role in this film.  I hope he's in the sequel because the director's gave all the characters a chance to shine.

If you are a fan of this genre, the trailer doesn't give the entire movie away.  This one was an action spectacle from the first moment.  Marvel should keep these two director's on the payroll because deliver the goods and keep fans like myself coming back.

Third:

Robert Redford has a major role in this film and he has respect for the material.  He doesn't phone in his performance.  If your a Redford fan, you won't be disappointed.

Overall I don't have any major criticisms of this movie and it's one that will go down in history as a great Marvel movie.  The super hero genre of films is finally getting the respect it deserves!",1410307200,,1246,4.453333333333333

This is a cut & paste from my actual order. It specifically listed Blu-Ray AND DVD. When the item arrived yesterday, it's the Blu-Ray 3D and Blu-Ray discs only, no DVD whatsoever.

The price also dropped by another $5 - I'm guessing to mask the fact that the item was labeled as a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack and it clearly isn't.

It is an udder disgrace that the studio would choose such archaic solution as iTunes. A man who has been resurrected from the dead should not be tied to a dying movie format.

Furthermore, trying to convert such a disc to digital using VUDU conversion will leave the user with an incompatibility issue as this version of the film already has a digital copy associated with it.

Curse you iTunes, we shall never meet again!

UPDATED:

I put in a call to UV and it seems the operation Codenamed: Hello Bucky was already well under way. UV assured me the code inside the packaging would work for accessing the digital copy through services like Vudu.

5228674,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not only a great stand-alone movie, but it is the best Marvel film since 2012's The Avengers!!! It has relatable characters, surprising twists and turns, a great modern-day story and amazing action sequences throughout the entire film. It features the return of fan-favorites Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Samuel L. Jackson, Hayley Atwell and Cobie Smulders reprising their roles from previous Marvel (Avengers-related) films along with newcomers Anthony Mackie, Robert Redford, Frank Grillo and Emily Van Camp. And Marvel does not disappoint!!!

After several years in the ice and fighting to save New York from aliens, Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) starts to figure out his place in the modern world as he continues working for SHIELD. But he starts to grow suspicious about what he signed up for as he realizes that he must face a world of subtler threat. He is called into action once again when Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) falls dead in Cap's arms saying that SHIELD has been infiltrated. Warned not to trust anybody, he finds that a new enemy from within SHIELD has made him a fugitive. Now, with help from fellow Avenger Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and his new friend Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Cap must work to uncover a sinister plot for mass destruction. But things get more difficult when Cap and his allies come across a threat that may link to Cap's own past: a mysterious assassin called the Winter Soldier.

Now this film goes over the ranking. It has everything that no other Marvel film has. It has a sense of political thriller that reenacts with the world of today. And I must say, I was very impressed with it. This is by far, Marvel's very first political thriller type film since 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger was an introductory film that takes place in a historical time, given the sense of the 1940's.

Now everyone knows about several characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by now. I did mention that some fan favorites do indeed return such as Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill and Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. But the big one is Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. Now I saw that her previous appearances were an okay start for character. Iron Man 2 was just the introduction and The Avengers was an expansion of Johansson's character due to Loki describing some of her past. And she still does an amazing job of kicking butt!!! Now this Marvel movie is thus far, the film that expanded Nick Fury's character a little bit. This is Samuel L. Jackson's best film since The Avengers to date (at least until Avengers: Age of Ultron). Now Jackson's role as the director of SHIELD was reduced to brief cameos in previous films with his role being more major in both Iron Man 2 and The Avengers. And he still nails that role. I'm wondering how many more films Jackson has till his contract goes out. Even Sebastian Stan returns as Bucky Barnes. Only this time, he is put into a brainwashed version of himself: The Winter Soldier. But I didn't really see him as a villain here in the film. Sure he was great. But he was more of the anti-hero type villain for me since he is not the main antagonist here.

Now going toward the newer characters. Anthony Mackie as the Falcon was a totally awesome move for Marvel to make. The wings for Falcon were so amazing, I went ""OMG!!! Those wings are awesome!!!"" He nailed that role so well, I think he should have an expansion on his contract with Marvel. He is the most loyal sidekick for Captain America!!! Moving on to Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow/Crossbones. I found Grillo's character rather surprising. Though we didn't see him in his Crossbones persona, we did see him in his Crossbones uniform at the climax of the film. He was a villain who knew how to take down Captain America. But he totally killed that role!!! Emily Van Camp as Sharon Carter. She is the niece of Peggy Carter here. But she also is an ally of Captain America because she works for SHIELD. I thought that they would connect even more (aside from that apartment scene). But I hope that Van Camp will return for Captain America 3 so that Sharon and Rogers can be boyfriend/girlfriend. Now for Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce. What better way to portray the main antagonist than to have a legendary actor? Redford's villain was such a great addition to the Marvel Universe rogues gallery. This is one villain who has a sense on what goes on in the modern world. If they ever do another political thriller superhero film, I think they should take their villains to how Robert Redford did it. He was an amazing choice and a great villain.

Now you probably know by now, for those of you who have seen this film, that HYDRA has returned. This time, we learn that over the course of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, HYDRA has secretly been running SHIELD right under their noses. So we see from Arnim Zola that HYDRA has been behind the killing of Rogers' old ally Howard Stark (Tony Stark's father) and that everything about SHIELD was practically a lie. Yes SHIELD agents are the good guys, but HYDRA were posing the whole time.

I kind of notice that this Marvel film ties in with The Avengers really really well. It references several other characters and gives an awesome aftermath to what happened in New York with the alien invasion. It even gives us a tease to some characters (like Doctor Strange) that could be introduced in future films.

Now the direction of this film, done by the Russo brothers here was set to a great aspect of today's world. As I said, it is a superhero/political thriller action film that has a way to remind us of what goes on in today's world. The Russo brothers did such a terrific job of directing this film, I hear that they will return for Captain America 3 in 2016.

Now at the end of the film, we get a tease to what may happen in 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron. According to Marvel producer/president Kevin Feige, this film is a tease to what may occur in that film when it hits theaters next year. We are here introduced to Thomas Kretschmann as Baron Wolfgang von Strucker who observes Loki's scepter from The Avengers and then plans to use Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen (they were the main couple in Godzilla) as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to move against the Avengers. Now this gets me wondering if they will be against them or if they will join them in their fight against Ultron.

Now as an overall statement, I've got to give this film five stars for being an amazing thrill ride all the way from start to finish with the 'Star Spangled Man with a Plan'. So I encourage you guys to watch this movie or buy it if you haven't already.",1410220800,,6765,4.644945697577277

Right from the go this movie has you hooked on it's every move. The great thing about this movie is that it coincides with the Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. show, so you can actually see the beginning and after affect of the film.

I think Marvel has chosen some really cool directors for this film and they make it seem fresh and on the edge of your seat intense. It is also great to see Robert Redford in a Marvel film and bringing a sense of class to the film. Clocking in at 136 minutes this film clearly shines and shows that Marvel movies can be any kind of genre and this genre is like a 1970's political thriller.

5228688,1,B0090SI3EI,"I loved the movie, don't get me wrong. It is definitely one of the best I've seen out of Marvel in recent years, same goes with: Thor The Dark World.

The problem with the new Marvel Blu-Rays is that the only release the blu ray and the dvd separately. Iron Man 3 didn't have this problem when it was released, they released the Blu-Ray+DVD Combo Pack but by the time Thor: The Dark World came to home media, that's where I think Disney really dropped the ball.

For someone who wants to be a filmmaker (like myself), I love watching the bonus content that the Blu-Rays have offer. My problem with stand alone DVD's is that they lack bonus content now these days, Why they are so cheap to NOT release it with a second disc is a mystery.

Another problem is that I don't own a 3D Blu-Ray player, and personally I don't need one. 3D in my opinion is just an excuse to make more money. I could buy the DVD and the Blu Ray simultaneously, but that makes it more expensive. I like owning Blu-Ray combo packs because they are more convenient to the consumer that way they don't have to go running back to get the different format of the same movie.

But whatever the case, I'll just have to settle for one of them. All I can ask is, which version has the more bonus content?",1410134400,42,1268,4.24896265560166

It should be noted,  the description of the (2-Disc 3D Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack + Digital HD) is INCORRECT.  The item in question is in fact, according to its picture, and Marvel's movie site, a 3D BluRay disc, and a non-3d, but still BluRay disc.  it is NOT a 3d BluRay and DVD.",1410048000,23,535,4.568421052631579

5228695,3,B0090SI3EI,"""That's not freedom, that's fear."" Steve Rogers (Evans) is still trying to adjust to life in the modern world but he does have Natasha (Johansson) and Nick Fury to help him. Thinking there may be a problem inside the walls of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury warns Rogers not to trust anyone. He takes this to heart and when Fury is killed Rogers becomes a fugitive from the organization. He must now fight the mysterious Winter Soldier in order to avenge Fury and also to clear his name. The first thing I will talk about are the good things about this movie. The Avengers movies seem to be leaning more to the adult side with a real story line and leaning less on the special effects that earlier comic book movies fell back on.  This one is no exception. It is dark and has depth to it to make you interested in what is happening rather than what is blowing up. They all do a great job of tying into each other which makes it feel like one long story rather then separate stories they attempt to tie together. On the other hand the fact that they keep pumping these movies out is what made the main plot of this movie not work. The whole movie has to deal with the leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D. becoming corrupt and Captain America being an outcast. The fact that they have already started to film Avengers 2 and have announced Captain America 3 takes away all the tension and suspense of Rogers and Fury's story lines. From the beginning you know that Fury will be fine and Rogers will clear his name and fix what is wrong with S.H.I.E.L.D. If they wanted to really have the viewer wonder what will happen they shouldn't have announced future plans for the series. To me the Avengers movies have become more of franchise done solely to make money rather than movies done to tell a story.  While they do make a killing when they come out they are starting to cheapen the industry and are watering down the product. There is failure to see that the longer the series goes on the more it will take away from what has been done so far. If you don't believe me now you will when Iron Man 6, Captain America 5, Thor 6 and Avengers 7 all come out. Overall, the movie is OK and worth seeing but there is no tension or suspense already knowing what the next movie will be like. I give it a B.",1410048000,,2266,4.316901408450704

Did they not learn the lessons the music industry learned the hard way that immediately allowing for rental or in the music industries case allow download of singles is the best way to combat pirating?

So a long labor day weekend comes and goes and four movies I wanted to see were all still only available for purchase. Half the time when I do get the time to watch them they are already on prime or Netflix and I pay nothing.

5228725,3,B0090SI3EI,"With regard to the product itself - I am disappointed in the lack of a combo pack, especially for the price.

With regard to the movie - I enjoyed watching the film for the most part - but it was definitely cheesy action flick more so than the slightly deeper first movie. There was a moral behind the story (to be expected in a super hero movie), but the emphasis was not on the philosophical premise so much on how much destruction could be accomplished.

I've rated this a 3-star but the majority of the reasons require spoilers (significant ones). Scroll past the space for more.

 I found myself expecting Samuel L. Jackson to die but not actually die (a la Agent Coulson in Avengers/Agents of SHIELD), and I was disappointed to discover they followed the pattern. The chemistry between Chris Evans (Capt. America) and Scarlet Johansson (Black Widow/Natasha) seemed forced. The visual effects / explosions were quite nice, but even these were overly gratuitous. The final rescue of one member by diving out of an exploding building into a waiting helicopter stretched my willingness to suspend disbelief (the character saved outran a crashing giant airship moving with enough force to completely destroy the theoretically reinforced building it hit). The redemption theme had either too little build up -- the character had too fast of a change for no reason whatever (and Chris Evans hit the water and went under in the classic, drowning but someone will save him scene).",1409875200,,1477,4.896

That said; I love this film. I thought that the characters were pretty strong on their own and stronger in a group, so it seemed a bit more believable to me that they were able to do the things they did. Although there were a few weak spots in the story, I didn't think there was anything so weak that the movie was just destroyed because of it. But this sort of film for me is always graded differently than other films. Certainly not going to hold it up to the same standard as American History X or The Great Dictator. If you're looking for a good action film with a lot of heart if not a superb story, then I'd say give this a go and have a good time.

 As many have said, this is the very best Super Hero movie ever- and I agree!  I had never been a fan of the character of Captain America, until the first movie came out- then I was a fan..........but with the second movie- I'm hooked!  Chris Evans is perfectly cast- this talent showing  multiple insights into this character, Scarlett Johannson continues to captivate- showing she's not just a pretty face, but also able to  bring out deeper sides to her character, and the storyline is ""right on the money""!

I almost hated taking back the one ""star"" in the rating, but that's for Disney/Marvel again shoving a 3D/Bluy-Ray combo on us, just so we can get the digital version, and have to buy the DVD separate.

5228805,1,B0090SI3EI,"First of all, I LOVED this movie... my review is regarding Disney/Marvel NOT releasing a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack... I am a Disney Movie Club customer so I have direct access to all Disney & Marvel titles, several months before they're released, and I can confirm they are YET AGAIN NOT releasing a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack. I have been very frustrated recently with Disney/Marvel's apparent disregard for consumers as (for a 2nd time), they don't release the combo pack, which EVERY OTHER MAJOR FILM STUDIO is still doing. Thor: The Dark World was another movie earlier this year that they didn't release the blu-ray/DVD combo pack. They clearly are trying to make more money by: 1) up-selling people to the 3D/2D blu-ray & digital copy version (I personally have no use for 3D), or 2) forcing people who have both DVD and blu-ray players to buy each separately (blu-ray alone and DVD alone). They are not even releasing the standard blu-ray with digital copy - you have to spend more money for the 3D version if you want an HD digital copy. A lot of consumers want the blu-ray/DVD (and digital copy) combo packs (all 3 in one preferred), which is why nearly all studios are still making those. Disney/Marvel needs to get with the program and continue meeting consumer needs rather than just filling their fat wallets!!

I'm sorry to rant, but I don't know how else to get Disney/Marvel to understand unless I complain publicly. I already attempted to contact Marvel about it directly but no one seems to care. If you agree with my point, please check Yes that this review was helpful. There is also a comment thread about this in a review for Thor: The Dark World, already with 42 commenters participating.

UPDATE 9/9/2014: I got a response from Marvel customer service providing a link to send them comments, suggestions or questions - this is specifically for Marvel Consumer Products: [...]
It has an email address and phone number - they recommended I send them a suggestion to continue printing Blu-ray/DVD combo packs. Feel free to contact them to voice your concerns! I will also be mentioning a preference for having digital copies included with all releases, not just the 3D version.

5228868,5,B0090SI3EI,"Coming back after decades of being put ""on ice"", Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is still adjusting to life in an America that isn't the flag-waving, uber-patriotic place he left behind.  But sticking to his ideals and beliefs become even more important when a vicious (and pretty awesomely-filmed) assassination attempt at S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) forces Rogers to distrust even those around him he's thought of as his closest allies.  Suddenly seen as a traitor by his own organization, as Captain America he becomes determined to get to the truth of who is friend and who is foe - all the while chasing down the elusive Winter Soldier, an enemy who will strike much closer to home than he'd ever realized.  Incredible action, fight sequences, effects, all wrapped around a beautifully-crafted film with Evans' sympathetic hero at its center, make this one of the best ""superhero"" films ever made.  In fact, if I may so so, it's downright ""Marvel-ous"".",1409529600,,976,5.043478260869565

No matter how great a movie is, I flat out refuse to download it, especially after reading other folks reviews of them having difficulties doing so. If Amazon continues to do this kind of thing with anything else in an attempt to get their way in contract negotiations, they won't be in business for much longer.

5228891,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier
 The summer blockbuster season has arrived early with Captain America: the Winter Soldier storming into 3,938 theaters across the country.  Films like this are meant to be financial tent poles, that is to generate a huge part of the total business for the year.  With Captain America: The Winter Soldier the dreams of the producers seem likely to come true in a very big way.  The producers trusted a team of not very well proven directors, the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, with $170 million to make this sequel to the 2011 Captain America: The First Avenger .  In one day our film of the week absconded with movie goers cash to a worldwide gross of $132 million.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier set a domestic April opening day record of over $37 million.
 The brothers Russo have only two other directing credits on their sheet, both comedies.  Their first movie Welcome to Collingwood suffered a critical and financial catastrophe.  Their other effort You, Me and Dupree managed to squeak out a profit but only just. From such a slender record the producers chose them to make a gigantic action/Sci-fi flick.  Most think this an odd choice but the two Russo boys have hit the jackpot on this thrilling, engaging and above all, big, movie.
 The-to some extent-novice directors (admittedly guys who turned out to be able to make a satisfying big screen hit) are teamed with pair of writers with an astonishing record of success.
Ink-men Christopher Markus and Steven McFeely have teamed up for their entire, very successful, writing careers.  They wrote Captain America: The First Avenger and also Thor: The Dark World which seems to have brought them the favor of the Marvel franchise.  They also penned the three movies in the Chronicles of Narnia series of Christian flavored childrens films.  The three Chronicles films grossed over a billion and a half dollars.
 But we go to films like this to see big stars and big explosions, lets not kid ourselves.  Chris Evans returns to his role as WWII soldier Steve Rogers.  The young Steve could not qualify physically to join the forces of freedom in the greatest war of all time, until he volunteered for an experiment in creating a super soldier.  The puny Steve Rogers transformed into Captain America via a serum and defeats the Red Skull and his minions to win WWII.  If this seems silly, let it go.  Welcome to the comic book world created by legendary writer Stan Lee, not the real world.  Odd things happen.  We enjoy the Marvel universe because of the inter- action of our super human characters in very human ways.
 If Captain America sleeps for 60 years or so, so what?  If he can jump out of an airplane without a parachute, who cares?  Captain America after all, can do and does do whatever it takes.  Just hold on and be entertained.  When actor Chris Evans takes or delivers a punch, he sells it so well that we don't question it for a minute.  That makes for a kind of good acting and a kind of good directing.  I saw a celebrated film this week from the 1980s and the choreographed fight scenes seemed wooden and stilted by comparison.  We have come a long way.
 The role of the Black Widow has grown since the first Captain America film, all to the good for me.  The Black Widow appears in most of the scenes in the new movie and has the best line in the film.  Scarlett Johansson plays the ex-KGB operative who now works for S.H.I.E.L.D., the agency that protects the USA and the world from the super villains.  Scarlett Johansson played the same character in The Avengers for which she was nominated for but somehow did not win the coveted Blimp award for Best Female Butt Kicker.  The Black Widow as played by Scarlett Johansson is an exceptionally kinetic character.
 Naturally Samuel L. Jackson returns to play the one eyed head of S.H.I.E.L.D., the fabled Nick Fury.  In the Marvel world even a comic book cut out like Nick Fury breathes and his personality occupies an actual person.  Fury has as his personal problem the disappearance of his self image.  He has spent so much of his life lying to everyone around him that he doesnt know anymore who or what he is.  That doesnt stop him from taking on the baddies.
 We also have Robert Redford in a critical role as the over seer of S.H.I.E.L.D.  Watch when he opens the refrigerator.  Look for the jar of Newmans Own sauce, in homage to Redfords friend and twice co-star Paul Newman.
 Also appearing is Romanian born Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier of the title.  The Winter Soldier has a mechanical arm, an impossible technology today but apparently not in the 1940s.  Anthony Mackie gets to fly in the Falcon flying suit as Sam Wilson, an ex-special ops soldier that lends a hand.  In typical Marvel magic, the suit has the logo of Stark Industries.  Stark Industries is a company owned by Tony Stark aka Iron Man.
 The distinct looking Toby Jones adds a role here as a computer dwelling personality to his other 77 acting credits.  And of course Stan Lee himself appears in a cameo.
 This will be a huge success and it should be.  The Russo brothers have given we film fans a completely captivating and enormously fun film to watch.  The directors even allowed the actors Johansson and Evans to write some of the dialog between their characters, something that I have never heard of before.  This solidly four saw blade Sci-Fi/action flick lasts for two hours and 16 minutes, but watch all the way through the credits.  It is rated a mild PG-13.  There are no bad words or naked people (but the Captain and the Black Widow do wear form fitting tights).  The body count is very very high but the dead just die, they don't gush out gallons of blood or other gore.  The summer season starts in April this year.  Rejoice.",1409443200,3,5795,4.630029440628067

5229010,4,B0090SI3EI,"The sequel to Captain America the first Avenger is a Smorgasbord of close quarter hand to hand combat and firearms special effects staged on the streets of Cleveland Ohio. Steven Rogers appears to have made the transition relatively well and everything at SHEILD appears to be moving along at a seemingly normal pace. What is most interesting is how Steve keeps avoiding the come-ons set forth by Nathaha Romanoff ""The Black Widow"" as played by sexy Scarlett Johansson, now how could Roger's hold back, on something most mortal men would weaken in the knees over....Not so for ""Bucky The Winter Soldier, who in the first film chased women like a normal red-blooded American Hero. Steves attraction to action falls short of the bedroom, whig is disappointing to some CA fans...like me.

5229015,5,B0090SI3EI,"I loved this movie! Cannot wait for it to come out in Standard Def as my computer is not geared for HD. However, I am a late bloomer when it comes to technology. I was truly hoping for a regular DVD format of this movie to come out so I could watch it without worrying about the computer. It is only out on Blu-Ray that I can see on Amazon. My TV is strictly old school. I have an old school DVD player. Will this movie ever be released on regular DVD format? I realize the time is coming I will have to upgrade my devices, but financially speaking not feasible for the next few months. And then there comes the upgrading to Blu-Ray for all my other DVD's. Seriously, I can't keep up financially. That... is my only real complaint about this. The movie itself? WORTH getting my hands on it in any format I possibly can! The BEST Marvel movie to date. I kid you not. No movie stirred my spirit more than The Winter Soldier. The plight that is Steve's as a result... oh, well, that's okay.

It's got more sass, more Black Widow, and introduces the fabulous Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson aka Falcon.

The flaws in the good guys makes them even more heroic in the end.  The betrayal of the guys that are supposed to be good makes them even more reprehensible.  It was a fun movie and the tweens could watch it and enjoy it along with the parents.

5229050,3,B0090SI3EI,"I really, really, really wanted to love this movie because there was such hype about it when it was released. The movie reviews stated how deeply it delved into characters' psyches and the issues, but actually these ""deep"" conversations really only consisted of one liners and conversations lasting less than 2 minutes throughout the movie.  The movie just didn't deliver my money's worth for me. Plenty of action, as I expected there would be, and CGI effects and all.  I didn't see the movie when it was in the cinemas and now I wish I did because it wouldn't have cost me $19.99 as this purchase did. So, I'm not a die hard Marvel fan and I won't be paying this much money again for a movie. I'll just wait the required year until it is available on Netflix.",1408924800,2,761,4.467625899280575

5229082,5,B0090SI3EI,"I enjoyed this movie. I do not recall hearing any times in the movie where God or Jesus is used as a curse word like in most movies. This was important to me. The volume of the movie was a bit low which is strange because the bonus features had a higher volume at a normal expected level. This is one of those movies full of little tidbits and or ""Easter eggs"". I will list some of the things in the movie that interested me (contains SPOILERS:)

-Captain America seems to think Polio was eradicated ""No polio, that's good"" he says when reflecting on the differences about the 'present' and his past.

-Pisco? while looking on ""the list"" of Cap, we see Pisco. Some have speculated it is Disco and others speculate its an alcoholic beverage.

-The multiple scenes with Natasha using two pistols, one in each hand, was very cheesy. This is a very overused and impractical movie gimmick.

-The D.C. Phallic symbol is seen no less than 3 times in this movie other than the symbol in the credits which I will mention later. This is a common symbol or monument to be shown in movies. Sometimes it is used to show the viewers the location of the current action, sometimes for other reasons.

-This is the first movie I have seen that actually mentions compartmentalization, then the concept is actually explained in the movie.

-This is another movie that shows deep, huge, underground military bases / cities.

-The concept of pre-crime and how bad it can be are shown in this movie. As you probably know, Minority Report is the movie that first brought this concept out to the mainstream. ""I Thought the punishment came after the crime"" Captain America. ""By holding a gun to everyone on earth you're calling it protection."" Cap. ""This isn't freedom, it's fear."" Steve Rodgers. ""Maybe we need someone to oversee us"" secretary Pierce.

-This is the second movie that I can recall that shows government or corporate agents impersonating police (with all of the gear) in order to kill the hero. The other movie is ""The Island"", with ironically Scarlett in that movie also. This concept of impersonation is very disturbing.

-""What's not damaged?"" The SUV replies ""Air conditioning is fully operational"". Awesome, at least one of the heroes might die cool.

-to build a better world, the old one must be torn down, that makes enemies. This is a paraphrase of what Pierce says in the movie. The order out of chaos type of theory.

-""Shall we play a game?"" Natasha pretends to be Joshua in the movie ""Wargames"" when referring to the Hydra AI computer. Awesome.

-Hydra created wars and chaos in order to cause people to give up their freedom in order to gain security. A time of purification and then a new world order as the Hydra AI describes while stalling Cap and Natasha.

-The 3 carriers kind of reminded me of Skynet.

""Hydra was telling you lies, not intelligence."" Natasha

-at 2:06:43 in the credits, we are show the mirror symbol of the exoteric and esoteric ""pyramid"" which instead of a ""pyramid"" it is the Phallic symbol, the city, Cap, etc, which all represent the 'good' 'shield' shown to the public, and the reverse unseen esoteric Hydra which infiltrates and causes chaos. On the top of the image with Cap is the Eagle symbol with 7 feathers if you include the tail. on the bottom of the image is the Hydra symbol with a skull and 6 serpents or tentacles with each in the shape of a 6. yep, you guessed right, that's a symbol with 6 number 6's in it. or, 666 on the left, and 666 on the right. This mirror image of the Phallic symbol is also hinted at at 1:26 in the movie when we see the symbol and its reflection in the water.

-at 2:10:07 in the credits, there is a flickering of the text, almost as if a joke or hint about computer viruses or corrupted AI.

-the credits tell us about the future release of ""Age of Ultron"".

-A scene near the end shows us what this next movie might be about, Hyrda using people with special powers or the ability to make 'miracles' (good or bad...).",1408838400,,3992,4.536211699164346

While the Avengers is the ""team up"" movie it can't take the time to flesh out all of these characters and take them on personal journeys like the solo films do. Winter Soldier takes Cap and throws him into the modern world and adopts the sub genre of political thriller/spy movie along the way. Plus I consider this movie a tipping point for the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe,  this movie throws everything all the way back to the first Iron Man on it's head as a groundbreaking revelation is unveiled.

It was full of action and had my attention held the whole way through. It was a good storyline adding twists from CA's past adding an extra emotional struggle for the American hero.
Great acting, great entertainment and of course leaving it wide open for a sequel.
Best of all - no really corny bits",1408752000,,460,4.423529411764706
5229162,5,B0090SI3EI,"i watched CA:TWS in the moviesbecause it starred chris evans and scarlett johansson. so when amazon had it, i immediately downloaded the movie. what caught me watching this was, aside from the actors, the storyline itself, albeit a marvel character was the hero, was very brooding and dark, very realistic and in a dimmer sense, apocalyptic. the notion of masquerading a political thriller into a superhero movie was very fantastic. it plastered the message straight-upon what dangers and intelligence hidden organizations possess over the majority. one cannot deny that stalking, infiltration of privacy and the likes are very much rampant and real. and the thought that these organizations sow deceit, spread stories and create wars is very unnerving. however, even with this storyline, i was also amazed by the limited use of cgi effects, and that the actors themselves did some of the stunts. the lighter moments also got me well. even though cap and widow were comrades, they did have chemistry. the kiss they shared, though just as an act to avoid arrest, was a breath of fresh air. and widow is a funny character. she kept pushing cap to go on dates, yet there wasn't even time for that. that scene in falcon's bathroom, with cap and widow talking about trust and gratitude, helped cemented their partnership. sebastian stan was also awesome as the winter soldier. he is very cool, very evil, yet somehow, he lacked the very soul which made him steve's friend. him trying to remember ""the man on the bridge"" was somehow like an awakening of his frozen mind. and somehow, i wanted to know if this humanity might be the reason he pulled cap out of the water. falcon was also a very cool character, militarily dressed yet with wings i wish i could use going to work (jk!). anthony macked nailed it well. ""cut the check!"", haha! samuel jackson, cobie smulders, and robert redford (not the cake) were simply outstanding! 5/5 ratings is not enough for this. i wish i could give it 7/5!",1408752000,,1986,4.826979472140763
5229163,4,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: The First Avenger was pretty low key. A little bit twee and humorous as well as largely harmless. At least Chris Evans (as with Rob Downey Jr. and Chris Hemsworth), proved a great casting choice for Marvel Studios juggernaut of heroes brought to life on the big screen. The thing was though, compared to the booming Iron Man films, the mega-popular Thor and the super hero blockbuster to end all blockbusters; The Avengers, Captain Americas origin movie was mainly uneventful, even for a Phase 1 flick. But you cant exactly make such a character that glamorous anyway can you? I enjoyed it and while it was admirable in forging its own vibe (that of a glossy WW2 matinee), it ultimately seemed plodding and lacking purpose. Ironic, considering it sets up a lot of the ground floor elements for the entire Avengers universe.

I approached this second instalment, The Winter Soldier, still with anticipation of where Marvel could now take their potentially most interesting Avenger, but also with a decent level of what I considered justified trepidation. After I sat through it however, the latter proved quite unnecessary. This film echoes the blueprint of the classic sequel, the distinctive second or middle film, and ends up being the most mature and one of the best executed of all ten films thus far released by the studio giant in their huge intertwined Avengers franchise. But lets not forget that this is still yet another super hero film and a lot can be said for over-saturation. A tricky balance of making billions and satisfying fans is something Marvel seems to be successful enough at, usually by having sly wit and jaw dropping CGI to cover major hiccups or plot holes. I have for a while now though approached each new film with great scrutiny, when in the past the spectacle alone and love of comics had me ready to plunge down a lobster or push play. Its getting harder to apply the context to something that constantly plays out the same only with different backdrops. If I cant justify anything beyond that these days, Ill tend to ignore or put some of the newer films on the back-burner. Theres much more purpose and bigger picture stuff in Winter Soldier compared to its predecessor, not to mention the excellent, combat heavy action sequences. All reasons I found it so refreshing.

With a blockbuster, you cant really escape formula of course. Even the best Marvel films have still openly required themselves to subscribe to a level of purposeful formulaic momentum. But there is room to move in it, and its usually only when a franchise is established, it will start to morph into something more unique (take the X-Men franchise for example). And it takes somebody with the balls to do it of course. The return to form, but imperfect third Iron Man film does such a thing. Mainly due to enlisting  and allowing  a fresh, exceptional talent to invent within said formula. In IM3s case it was much respected writer/director Shane Black, and what he delivered was something that was Marvel through and through, but achieves much broader things in terms of story, humour and direction. He put his personal stamp on it and it worked (for the most part). Captain America has done mostly this with its second film; albeit on a completely different tonal plane and in a much more subtle manner, and less about a personal stamp than an unwavering concept of genre. Once again, its due to Marvel taking that chance with directors that almost always seems to pay off  something that has been nothing short of inspired most of the time. The directors (s) in this case, Anthony and Joe Russo, are hardly household names, but their experience says something about being the unique choice for this, and now the upcoming third CA film. Primarily know for television work, the brothers have hands in several episodes (including pilots and finales) for Arrested Development and Community. TWS proves they aren't so bad at action thrillers either.

Writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who have penned three other Marvel movies including the first Captain America, set the agenda clear from the start. Specific in wanting a sub-genre present and intentionally channelling 1970s political paranoia films such as The Parallax View & Three Days of the Condor, that room to move I mentioned has been filled with intelligent dialogue and handled with dead seriousness; all which works in its comic book film favour. Even to the point of casting Hollywood legend and Condor star, Robert Redford, in an integral role as S.H.I.E.L.D. honcho Alexander Pierce. His presence brings unsurprising weight and rather than phoning it in too much, Redford solidly takes on the responsibility professionally and convincingly. Samuel L. Jacksons staple Nick Fury gets plenty of screen and story time and as usual, he is characteristically watchable. Scarlett Johansson is employed to link The Avengers/S.H.I.E.L.D a little more familiarly for the audience it seems but also to fill a void of an in-the-mix confidant for Cap which the lack of possibly hindered the first film a bit. Not to mention some male eye candy to counter Chris Evans ripped specimen for the ladies. Other faces including Anthony Mackie and Cobie Smulders are good and welcomed in an instalment that will have plenty of repercussions for future Avengers films of every ilk; story and tone wise.

Of course, despite the significance and entwining nature of the storyline, this remains Steve Rogers aka Captain Americas film, and fans of the character are given a treat to see him finally start acting the reputation. Evans rises to the challenge. Whether its his charisma and physical strength working better to ensure Rogers is likeable, infallible and heroic throughout, or simply through the film-makers deciding to use his most iconic appendage  his shield  as more of an offensive weapon this time around too. Finally we see the shield come to life in the way we all know it deserves too. And Rogers himself wreaks havoc on any poor fool willing to give him a shot. Were talking about a super solider after all, and as expected the directors have taken the gleeful approach to Cap laying the smack down more and better than hes done in his other two appearances. No mercy is shown and the body count is refreshingly high in The Winter Soldier. I wouldnt go so far as too call it brutal, but many of the fight scene choreography are of the highest duke em out variety with Cap an expert at delivering it. What makes it all the more fun, is our titular villain, the winter soldier himself (played by Sebastian Stan), is no pushover and is a perfect nemesis in both strength and coldness. A set piece between them at the centre of the film is quite superbly orchestrated, if maybe a little brief.

The Caps angle is still of course, the fish out of water hero from the past trying to fit into the 21st century. It is handled with a bit of clunk at times but overall, after the progression of this ongoing character designation from the first film through to The Avengers and now here, the significance is fluid and convincing enough without be overly distracting. It is a credit to the writers and performers that most of such moments do bring a nice human feel to the overall grounded vibe. Also of course, this angle leads to some good punch-line material (Foods a lot better, we used to boil everything. Internet, so helpful). Speaking of humour, look out for a great homage to Sam Jacksons Jules Winfield and as usual, a mid-closing credit sequence is an interesting cherry. Delving into the actual plot would be difficult without giving out spoilers so Ill just leave it as saying what plays out, opens the whole Avengers storyline wide open

When the smoke clears after two plus hours, you cant deny it is still mostly brain-at-the-door stuff, with holes, but it doesnt insult you. That context again. Stripped down, this is simply an excellently directed action thriller. Take away the costumes, tone down the gloss a bit and put Matt Damon in this, and youd be forgiven to think some scenes were straight out of Bourne. Such is the dominating fervour of Rogers when hes ready to take names. He is unstoppable and incorruptible. This is the Captain America film fans have waited to see. Along with Iron Man, The Avengers and the recent Guardians of the Galaxy, The Winter Soldier is the best Marvel has delivered thus far.",1408665600,,8418,4.838888888888889

I have been a Prime member since they began. My Internet is too unstable to enjoy streaming consistently. I pre-order most things I buy from Amazon, pay that Prime premium and do not feel I am getting my money's worth when one of the biggest blockbusters of the year is being used as a bargaining chip in talks with Disney. As a loyal customer, I waited. Got response from Amazon's customer service that did not help, so I did what any customer would do, I went elsewhere. Other websites sell this movie in its US Blu Ray release. This will make me rethink my Prime membership and my ordering future releases from them.

I think some of the action scenes could've been toned down a bit, but it didn't take away from how much I enjoyed the movie.  The elevator scene was excellently done, and I appreciated how they didn't rely on CGI so heavily.  I know my father was all into the fight scenes, and he kept saying ""Wow"" for about five minutes after the movie was over.  That was close to what I thought when I watched it back in April at the theater.  It was like I had just gotten off an intense rollercoaster ride and catching my breath.

Chris Evans was hot, and I really liked the interaction between him and Black Widow.  I really enjoyed the Falcon character too.  Even Nick Fury had more screen time and he chewed it up and spit it out like it was nothing.  Cool dude vibe going strong.

If I had one complaint about the movie it would have to be the sound, I am sorry but the sound is so imbalanced it makes it a pain in the ass to have to keep readjusting from them talking to music or any other effects in the movie.

5229220,5,B0090SI3EI,"When I first heard that Marvel was starting a new movie franchise with Captain America I was concerned about how they would make him relevant in a world that's skeptical about such things as country, honor, and patriotism.  The first movie being staged in WWII was a brilliant move, but even more brilliant was the move to incorporate him into the current-day terrorism-filled world of Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.  This has given them a platform for relevant topics that can attract more mature audiences.  Of course the world of S.H.I.E.L.D.is a way over-the-top sci-fi version of intelligence and anti-terrorism agencies, I think they made a good move with this storyline to rectify that and provide a more realistic situation for future stories.  I'm really looking forward to where this storyline goes in the next few years.  KUDO's to the writers and the outstanding casting of this movie.  An even bigger KUDO to the director for having the insight to make this more of a harsh street-level action movie with the feel of an espionage thriller.",1408579200,,1048,4.96

It almost seems like they rated Winter Soldier poorly so that people wouldn't watch it, potentially because they don't want the obvious message of the movie to be heard, which is; don't let anyone, government or private become too powerful this is what happens.

5229231,5,B0090SI3EI,"This is not a mild PG-13 for those with children who are squeamish about military violence.  Nothing graphic, no torture or anything absurd and distasteful, I don't remember any swearing at all, no sexual content, and no drug use.  However they use (replicas of) real firearms and fire a literal ton of bullets throughout the movie, nothing graphic but yeah good guys and bad guys are clearly being shot and killed, not to mention innocent bystanders getting hit a few times I'm pretty sure.  Everyone including the good guys ends up getting shot at least once, I think most of the actors get shot multiple times.

Similar to the first Iron Man overall The Winter Soldier took a more grounded approach than many ""Super Hero"" movies and comes away better for it.  No poorly implemented and childish energy rifles in this one, regardless of how lore based they are.

Incredible action sequences with VERY well choreographed gun battles and hand to hand combat.  Acting was exceptional all the way through.  Pretty much guaranteed top 3 Marvel Movie for anyone who sees it.

5229235,5,B0090SI3EI,"BEST superhero movie yet!  Not kidding.

Writing is solid, with fun twists, believable dialogue, and good characterization.  You can relate to all the heroes and villains.

The effects are so crisp and realistic that you will NEVER be brought out of suspension of disbelief!  Even in the air ships, plummeting or soaring through the air!

The action is intense and relentless.  A BUNCH of cringe-worthy crashes and clashes inhabit this movie.  It is the kind of movie that you HAVE to watch again, WANT to watch again, and LOVE to watch again because the choreography is clear and impressive and brutal.  No corny dialogue or shaky cameras ruining anything.

So many bullets!  So many punches and kicks and martial arts acrobatics!  So many realistic injuries and near-death escapes!  Wow.

The villains are as exciting as the heroes.  Incredible acting on all fronts.  The Leaper gives Cap a real fight!  Love GSP.  He was perfect.  A few of the Hydra/Shield soldiers were scary dangerous.  They muscle the heroes around quite a bit!

Falcon is an amazing new hero with a lot of vulnerabilities, like Black Widow.  So his clashes are really tense.  What a great addition, too.  There is no one like him, swooping and diving and jumping off buildings.  Awesome.

Then, of course, we get a few surprise re-appearances that will have you raising eyebrows.  Nazi's are like roaches!

Cap 2's story is fun and realistic, interweaving a conspiracy that is not too far from the truth here in the USA.  SHIELD and Hydra start to resemble the crackleheads in our government.  Scary well.

Anyway, I found it really unsettling that this plot kind of mirrors the following books:

1) Rule by Secrecy by Jim Marrs
2) Rise of the Fourth Reich by Jim Marrs
3) 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read by Jesse Ventura
4) War is a Racket by General Smedley Butler

To name a few!

Very cool idea, making the whole SHIELD and Hydra worlds clash the way some believe our own governments and shadow governments do today.  You may not believe it, but it sure is fun to read about and watch.

Captain America 2 is deeper and more interesting than your average superhero movie.  It rivals Avengers in its action and effects.  It resembles the Batman movies with its more realistic presentation of heroes.  Just perfect.

5229241,5,B0090SI3EI,"I enjoyed this film in it's entirety.  Besides being a wonderful movie on it's own, this is the first modern superhero flick where I can look at the main character and say ""This IS Captain America"", no other film has given me that feeling so completely.  While Robert Downey looks and acts A LOT like Tony Stark, and Henry Cavil seems like the perfect actor to play Superman, the material they have been given to work with hasn't always been quite spot on to stay true to the characters they're playing, but I feel like this version of Cap could have stepped right out of the pages of a comic, they captured his character wonderfully.

While some of the other second phase Marvel movies have been mediocre as films, I feel as if they have been putting more effort into capturing the basics of the Marvel Heros and bringing them to the screen, but no other film has done it so well.  I may sound a bit redundant, but to me this key to a good superhero movie.  I don't look to nitpick on random facts and minutiae, but I do always want to see a movie where they at least attempt to portray the basics of what makes the character who they are, rather than just putting out a film with a superhero's name in the title and a completely unrecognizable character making there way through the film.

Iron Man 3 did a fairly good job of this, giving us a more well rounded and recognizable Tony Stark than we have seen before on the big screen, but they fell short on a few points, and the film seemed a bit lacking at times.  Thor 2, while a decent film, didn't show me much in the way of character development, and while there were moments where I felt they captured Thor as a character well, I feel like they missed more often than not.  I hate to sound like I'm nitpicking, but I can't really see Thor as a character NOT being a God, and in the films, they have gone out of there way to point out that the Asgardians are not Gods, it just annoys me a bit, and it makes the actions of the characters seem even less believable than if they were divine.  In the comics, Odin can get away with being a massive dick BECAUSE he's the All Father, because he sees almost everything, and you can believe that he's acting and making choices on a wider scope than other characters, but in the films, lacking divinity, he just comes across as a bit of a tyrant, a wise tyrant, but a tyrant all the same.  Hell, in the comics even Tony Stark, the man of science who believes everything is explainable, is convinced that the Asgardians are deities.  The Winter Soldier though feels as if it could have come straight from the pages of any stand alone Cap story.

Chris Evans does a wonderful job as Captain America, he really fits into the role, and it shows throughout the film.  He looks like Cap, and he does a great job of making the character believable.  The fight sequences were fantastic, super well choreographed, very technical, and the way they were filmed made you really FEEL every blow.  I enjoyed Bucky aka the Winter Soldier, I think the actor cast to play him did a good job, but I feel like the character was a bit underused and could have been developed more, I'm hoping that will happen in future films though.  Scarlet Johansson continues to succeed as Black Widow, I was surprised with how large her role was in this film, and she handled it really well, bringing more depth to the character than we have seen before.  She did a great job humanizing and fleshing out Natasha in The Avengers, and now has taken the character even farther in The Winter Soldier.

Marvel has done a great job of bringing these characters to the big screen and giving us stories that have a comic book feel.  As a fan of the source materiel, I'm constantly amazed that we have been able to see all of this play out in films, it's like a dream come true, and I hope that this continues for a long time.",1408406400,,3882,4.337016574585635

At times dark, at times funny and always well directed and acted. Chris Evans is finally comfortable as Cap and he did an excellent job portraying Cap's loneliness and his disillusionment with SHIELD. He wants to do what's right but what IS right? He was finding his way and Evans nailed it. As did Sebastian Stan (his heartbreaking ***SPOILER***  ""but I knew him"" owned me), Anthony Mackie (he was so fun and was a perfect wing man-pun intended) and Scarlett Johannsen elevated every scene she was in.

5229253,1,B0090SI3EI,"Where do you want to start? First this is not a political thriller and to call it that is to disgrace the genre that spawned the likes of the Pelican Brief along with Murder At 1600. Second of all, you watch a movie like this because you don't want to pay attention and it is impossible to do that, ridiculous fight scenes along with firepower that somehow fails to cause any collateral damage. My personal favorite? Hydra within SHIELD, I mean at least GI Joe Retaliation they had a President being portrayed by an impostor which made that premise more palatable. Much like Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol - this is a movie without a soul. You're not going to want to watch for any real emotions because the dialogue is uninspired and we're not even beginning to cover the lack of a sense of good vs evil. Captain America is cynical in this one, far less idealistic and anything but inspiring. You almost feel like he's the superhero equivalent of a cop who has to respond to 'threats' not because he believes in the mission but more due to being paid by the hour for it. Robert Redford gets the Ben Kingsley treatment as they emasculate his acting ability in favor of a colorless villain. Not since the demise of the pathetic excuse for the Mandarin have we had such a watered down bad guy. At least Loki, Red Skull and Thanos stayed true to their villainous nature with plans that actually emerged as being diabolical.

5229268,5,B0090SI3EI,"Chris Evans was the perfect choice for Capt. America. He's a handsome, clean-cut guy, but not so pretty that he annoys, threatens, or confuses other guys; he has the charisma and like-able nature necessary for anyone playing Steve Rogers. That's actually a fairly difficult commodity to find in Hollywood. I guarantee some idiot agent or casting director tried to pitch Channing freaking Tatum as Cap for the first film, and that would have been a disaster. I bet someone threw Ashton Kutcher's name out there for consideration when they were casting the first Iron Man. Contemplate that atrocity-that-never-was. But Evans has been excellent in high-tension film roles for years now, from Sunshine to Snowpiercer. He even has experience as a Marvel Superhero, playing the Human Torch in the Not-So Fantastic Four adaptations.

This story is straight from the Ed Brubaker-run on Captain America that is probably the best in the characters' long history, all the way back to Kirby and Simon's origin story in the '40's. Where Brubaker had the Winter Soldier storyline directly follow the Death of Capt. America, directors the Russo Bros. place it squarely within the tightly co-ordinated 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', and it's 'Three Phase Plan' and whatnot (It sounds like a scary political platform, not some ideas on a few superhero flicks). It works well, and the cold war elements of the story don't seem out of place. George St. Pierre has some nice fight scenes in his appearances as a toned down version of Batroc the Leaper, and of course Bucky Barnes makes a surprising reappearance... there were plenty of twists I wasn't expecting, and Scarlett Johansen as Black Widow has been a great addition in all her MCU roles playing the Russian superspy. It almost feels as if she's had a movie of her own, and maybe a Black Widow movie is forthcoming. Or maybe Disney will 'punish' her for the full frontal nudity in 'Under The Skin'. It wasn't long ago Disney did things like that, maybe they still do. Anyway...

The Winter Soldier isn't bearing the burden of telling Cap's origin story (which is really quite lame... superserums?), it just sets off at a crazy pace and never stops. It's as much a classic cold-war style spy thriller as it is a superhero movie. It has moles, and snipers, and hostage-taking mercenaries, and secret SHIELD bunkers containing... well, never mind.

It's got: melodrama between characters that seek no real emotional investment from the viewers, needless plot convolutions that do nothing but act as a distraction from its recycled ideas and predictable twists, futuristic technology with accompanying incomprehensible banter, loads of CGI, shaky action sequences, cheesy one-liners, and lots of sex appeal. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is honestly the only character with any likable traits. Robert Redford is a delight to see anytime, same goes with Scarlett Johansson and Cobie Smulders, but their performances are just what one would expect from the given material and nothing more. Chris Evans as Captain America comes off as just another pretty boy that worked his way into the Hollywood system with model good looks and not much else. The score could have been cut and pasted from any other Marvel film, go figure. There is just nothing original about Captain America: The Winter Soldier, yet its obvious that it would become a huge box office hit. Audiences can't seem to get enough of the critically overused formula of tried-and-true tactics, and hey, Marvel is dishing them out with amazing frequency.

I am first of all a pretty big fan of the first Captain America movie, I understand though that it's not for everyone. That being said, I saw this on opening day, walked into the theater not really expecting much, but WOW! I couldn't have been anymore wrong!

I know the first Captain America movie, being an origins tale, was kind of slow moving in its plot to really get going. Not this one! Right from the get go, you see Rogers as Captain America in action, doing what he does best. There's plenty of action, drama, and plot twists. In fact, not to give anything away, but the plot twist in this movie pretty much HUGELY changes the Marvel Cinematic Universe!! After being disappointed by Iron Man 3, it was so nice and refreshing to actually see MCU going back to making another good movie, though I do think Thor: the Dark World was pretty good, as well, but not on this level. I would definitely rank this movie up there with the top super-hero movies, and marvel movies. Really far as I'm concerned this movie is right on notch with the Avengers.

Only gripe I have, if it's even a gripe at all, is I wish I would have seen more of the Winter Soldier!! Since the movie is titled after him, you'd think you would see him a lot in the movie, but honestly it really doesn't seem like the plot revolves around him essentially too much and he doesn't have as many scenes as you'd think.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a franchise deeply rooted in American jingoism, takes this cynicism head on with its titular hero in a way that feels surprisingly modern.

Our hero, Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans) does what good soldiers should: he follows orders.  So when he discovers that his companion Natasha Romanoff AKA Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) has an ulterior motive during a standard counter-terrorism mission, Rogers suspects something is up.  This dichotomy -- Captain America forthright and public, Black Widow secretive and in the shadows  is a theme that runs throughout the film that parallels the challenge of the modern whistleblower: should we fight the creation of these privacy-invading organizations in public or release secrets illegally like Edward Snowden?

Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) prefers the latter, and he uses Black widow as a tool to get to the truth.  When he gets too close, the truth attempts to rub him out in a thrilling car chase sequence with a hovercraft mode that conveniently won't kick in when its needed most.  With Fury presumed dead, Cap and Black Widow track down the contents of a mysterious flash drive, where they discover that when a global event threatens the authority of the worlds superpowers (the alien invasion from The Avengers) it reasserts itself with terrible force in a way reminiscent of fascismthe kind of fascism Captain America fought in World War II.  His idealism has never felt more relevant.

And thats what makes The Winter Soldier so great. What could easily be a dated concept feels fresh because the issues Captain America grapples with have changed names, countries, and titles, but are still lurking in the shadowy corners of our beloved institutions.  Just don't watch Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. first  the concurrent episodes give away the entire plot.",1401667200,14,2063,5.2560975609756095

What happens when a superhero dedicated to American ideals starts questioning the government organization he works for?

What did I think?

The Captain America sequel is a rollicking comic book adventure with a nice modern twist: How does an all-American hero with 1940s ideals fit into a world of black-ops and clandestine government strategies? Its a refreshing angle though turns out to be a little simplistic in delivery.

Thankfully theres a barrage of action, stunts and fighting to distract you from the occasional clunkiness and predictable moments. Good character development further establishes this as not only a fun movie but a very important touchstone for future Marvel franchise flicks. Chris Evans brings out the conflict of Steve Rogers' Man Out Of Time and his interaction with seemingly heartless super spy Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) is a delight. Entertaining and one both comic lovers and casuals will appreciate.",1401580800,2,961,5.386666666666667

I have seen the earlier Cap film and I have been a casual reader of Captain America since the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee run, so didn't know what to expect here.

Story:

The story is one of trust.  The Trust theme goes throughout the film.  People who you thought were your friend seem to betray and want to kill you.  Why?  Nick Fury finds that out fast with some help from the General Secretary, played competently by Robert Redford, who has aged gracefully and has some pretty evil one-liners in this film.

The SHIELD helicarriers, what are they, a new peace machine or as Cap puts it, holding a gun to our heads to keep the peace?

And what of Hydra?  Did they really go away after WWII or whats going on with that?

Characters:

Love Chris Evans whole creation of Cap.  A man out of time, still trying to relate to a 21st century world where he finds the goals of freedom and democracy from the America he knew to one of subplots, secrecies within secrecies, and a culture of mistrust that could get a guy killed.

Love the Falcon, remembering his team up with Cap in the comics back in the 70s and 80s.

The Black Widow is no slouch, lots of shooting and beating and so on.  Yikes!

Final Word:  Not a lot of blow up action, much more of a cerebral, spy story that might appeal to fan boys but is mostly created for a general audience that doesnt know a lot about the Marvel characters.

Stay tuned for the mid credit scene and a final scene at the end that makes you think and wonder.

Sorry for an abbreviated review.  Tough to write this without giving away the story.  Do watch it!",1401321600,5,1619,4.323333333333333

The action was great , the story line  was awesome . The fight scenes were great , an when it gets to my second hand movie theater Ill see it again . They did show too much on they trailers an won't write about any spoilers . Captain America is a image , He was in WW-2  an also in our era . What He see here is a culture totally the opposite of His era back in the 40's . Back then You had honor an respect , not in the 21st century , its all about greed an really cant believe what anyone says either on the media  or at SHIELD . Cap plays
off the Black Widow good , and makes a good team , Cap , as Steve Rogers makes a friend at the VA hospital who in time asks for His help. They throw Us a few future Bad Guys . As the title of the movie Winter Soldier , if You read the books You know the character , but He seems to be one of the Bad Guys an attacks Fury  who gets critical injuries . I found this films screenplay is like something off the news of today .At points , It don't seem  to be a Super Hero film , it could had been a 007 film . I came out after seeing very satisfied , not many movie stick with You as You drop off the 3-D glasses much any more , but came out now wanting  for when  DVD ,will come out ,  now this leads to another matter . I see that they are releasing this film alone , only one DVD , one Bluray , but no "" combo-pack with a Bluray and DVD  ! Why is Disney doing this / With Thor they did the same thing but offered a combo -with Bluray/ DVD / 3-D for $28 .

5229281,5,B0090SI3EI,"Just as Spidey is swinging back into theaters for, doubtless, another big opening at the box office, The Peoples Critic is just getting a chance to write up the Springs first big blockbuster. Thats right, Cap is back, and in a big, big way! Remember when Sam Raimis Spiderman came out, and everyone was saying, Now that is how you make a comic book movie!? But then The Dark Knight came out and everyone said, No wait, now that is how you make a comic book movie! Taking nothing away from Spiderman, The Dark Knight, or the other entries in the Marvel franchise, I would like to formally invite Captain America: The Winter Soldier into the conversation because this is how you make a comic book movie!

To begin with, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a terrific political conspiracy thriller in the style of Three Days of the Condor or The Parallax View except with superheroes and a bigger budget. I can honestly say that anyone can enjoy this film even without previous knowledge of other Marvel franchise films. I can say this because I took my mother to the film and she loved it. For those of you who know my mothers skepticism to all things comic, that should send you to the theater immediately.

For those of you who don't know my mother or need even more motivation, now Im speaking to you. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the follow-up to Joe Johnstons 2011 film, Captain America: The First Avenger. The sequel, exquisitely directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, finds Cap Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finally adjusting to life in the 21st century. Still an active member of S.H.I.E.L.D, Rogers continues to take missions but is finding modern ethics a bit distasteful compared to those he lived by in the 1940s.

When S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), reveals a new initiative called Project Insight, Rogers has major doubts. Spearheaded by the World Security Council, Project Insight would use triangulated helicarriers that track bio-levels in all humans to determine future threats and then eliminate them before they can ever strike. Similar to the conflicts in the film Minority Report, this form of pre-crime judgment is a tough pill for Rogers to swallow. After Fury requests that Secretary of Defense Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) delay Project Insight, Fury is suddenly attacked in one of the finest action sequences put to film in recent memory.

Now Rogers along with new pal, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson), must search to find who it is that is attacking S.H.I.E.L.D. and preserve the safety of America and the world. His efforts are complicated with the arrival of The Winter Soldier, a mysterious super soldier with talents and abilities rivaling those of Rogerss. The cats mostly out of the bag regarding what the Winter Soldiers identity truly is, but I will not reveal it here.

Back to my original statement about why this film belongs in the conversation of finest comic book movies. While many films of this genre are born into intergalactic conflicts and absurdly fantastic plotlines, the best of them are grounded, at least partially, in reality. The motive for Captain America has always been protecting his homeland from threats, and it is a credit to the Russo brothers and writers Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely to put him in an environment where he is doing that very thing.  Additionally, the performances are pitch perfect.  Evans brings the perfect balance of charm, bravado, and idealism to the role of Captain America, and Robert Redford puts forth a very real and noteworthy performance as Pierce, no doubt inspired by how Tommy Lee Jones treated his role as Colonel Phillips in Captain America: The First Avenger.

The film, while capable of standing alone, is also so well woven in to the Marvel universe. References and Easter eggs abound including one small homage to actor, Samuel L. Jackson that is sure to delight fans of his films. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is yet another fantastic entry into this still unrivaled and unprecedented series of associated franchises. However, this film sets a new bar but one that I have no doubts will be surpassed again. A

Captain America: The Winter Soldier is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes. Marvel continues its trend of providing stingers after the credits, so stay comfortable and enjoy two scenes  one midway through the credits and one afterwards.",1400544000,10,4464,4.916334661354582
5229282,3,B0090SI3EI,"A movie is only as good as its weakest Turning Point, and the first of those is the Inciting Incident. Filmmakers usually give much attention to this plot point, and the Climax, as they constitute the two important endpoints of the story arc. In Captain America: Winter Soldier, the Inciting Incident comes right out of the gate in the film's opening scene. Bantering Captain America team members carry out a nominally successful mission, but Captain America, a.k.a. Steve Rogers learns the team was put in jeopardy by Director Nick Furys compartmentalizing, assigning Natasha a separate mission (to upload enemy hard-drive data) without Rogers knowledge, thus putting all of the team in danger. It turns out Fury had good reason for this. How is this a turning point ... Rogers thought he was the mission leader, but in fact no one was, they were all acting separately, no longer as a team. Rogers concludes that this indicates problems higher up the chain of command in Shield. This isn't really a turning point, it's more the first in a series of discoveries by Rogers that gives him pause. The other plot points are smooth escalations, increasing the suspense. A 5-star story brings on revelations, surprises, and reveals information that then changes the meaning of earlier events. This is a workmanlike film story with fine production values, special effects, and acting.",1400544000,2,1377,5.043859649122807
5229283,2,B0090SI3EI,"I was very excited to see this movie when it came out in the cinema. 90% on rotten tomatoes! Better than the first Captain America! The best superhero movie around! It deals with Totally Real World Issues You Guys, Its Super Serious.

To me, this movie fell short - massively short - of all the hype and excitement. 90% on rotten tomatoes, for me, means (or meant, I guess) that the movie was really really super good, with a great balance of story and action, likable characters - I don't know, something that I'd want to watch again, or at least really enjoy the first time.

TWS (The Winter Soldier) is setup as a throwback to ""old school"" spy films, and deals with ""current"" real world concerns (think/Snowden and WikiLeaks if you're reading this in 2015+). It is also a ""superhero"" film, which I suppose is like an ""action"" film, only with someone who has ""powers beyond mortal's ken (or, is Batman)"". I'm a little fuzzy on the details - was Unbreakable a superhero film? Or is the title only reserved for comic book heroes? Anyway, it also runs for north of two hours, which is a Long Time. And brother, you feel every minute of it.

So! Why didn't I like this film? I didn't like it because it has almost no story or plot (it touches on some great ideas and then just forgets them), it has no end of ""action scenes"" that often don't make sense and combined become incredibly dull, and has zero tension.

It is also extremely violent, so not great for the little ones.

I gave it two stars because,  while it's not a *terrible* film, it doesn't justify the hype, and given how excited you will be to see it, well, the lack of quality just makes it a bit worse. Also, I would never want to see this again.

To expand:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. No Story! No Plot!
  TWS has some good possibilities for plot - a govt agency gone wrong! The whole concept of an intelligence agency using freely available data (think facebook & gmail) to determine someone's political stance and then use that as an excuse to eliminate them! Who watches the agency that watches us? Can you be ""redeemed"" if you did bad deeds while thinking they were good?

  Alas, that is the *extent* of the questions, and the attention paid to them. Great ideas, great launchpads for an innovative story - and all of it entirely ignored, mentioned once in passing and then forgotten about.

Instead you get

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. No end of action scenes!
Think that idea about redemption was interesting? Hah! Sucks to be you, instead watch The Captain & co. attack a ship at night... with an extended action scene - that is not needed at all. He fights Batroc! Who then escapes!

  Were you wondering who *does* watch the watchmen? Well, instead watch how The Captain can take apart another one billion dollar fancy flying mini-airship with a minimum of fuss. Is there redemption? There are bullets. Endless bullets.

  Action scenes as they're done here don't work in a superhero movie - superheroes don't die, so the scene either effectively involves

  a) none of the bullets hit the hero, so he's just vaguely inconvenienced... if you don't show the hero having to re-do his shoelace while walking, why show him be similarly inconvenienced by bullets?
  b) all of the bullets hit, but the hero is invincible. This is even less of an inconvenience, but doesn't really happen here.

  So many of the action scenes, had they been cut, would have added to the tension by allowing more story and maybe even made the movie a manageable length. Instead of showing an attack on a ship, why not just mention it like those poor Bothans who died were mentioned?
  It isn't that the action scenes are ""bad"" by any stretch - the scene where The Captain attacks the airplane is pretty neat. So is the Heat-like shootout on the freeway, so is the attack on the ship... but when you just have endless action sequences, *none* of them end up standing out. Your favourite colour might be red, say - but that doesn't mean you want *everything* to be red. The film became a wall of action scenes, each competing against the other.
  It just ends up feeling like they shot the film and realised they had an extra hundred million dollars left over, so kept on cramming in action. It doesn't work - if one action scene is good, 100 doesn't make it 100 times as good... especially because

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. There Is No Tension.
This is a ""taught"" and ""tense"" spy thriller with very little tension. The endless action scenes - where The Captain (or whoever it might be at the time) handily avoids/beats/evades the villain just ends up showing how useless and incompetent evil SHIELD is, which somewhat significantly lowers the drama. Evil SHIELD sadly stumbles from one setback to the next. I started feeling sorry for how badly it was going for evil SHIELD, they just couldn't get a break.

  In a particularly damning scene, right after some interesting exposition about how HYDRA took over SHIELD, I guess the directors fretted that the confused ADHD riddled 6 year olds that are apparently the core target audience might lose interest and leave to see Spider Man, so included a giant missile-strike on the... ugh. Look, it made no sense for a missile to be fired on that location, all it did was set the villains back. Again. And, again, the hero just evaded the missile. Because of course he did, he's the hero of a billion-dollar franchise.

  Initially tense scenes even find themselves undercut by almost loony-tunes level devices -  Nicky Fury has something that can *literally* cut through all the pavement in the world into the sewers below in the time it takes the average man to cross the street! What! How is that not a standard weapon for everyone??

  The titular Winter Soldier walks everywhere slowly, and messes up *every* single assignment he has. Everyone kept saying how dangerous he was, but... man, dude struggled.
By the time he staggers into the film's grand finale, TWS has gone from ""bad-ass"" to ""punching bag"". I kept wondering why Hydra kept sending him, he obviously wasn't cut out for the job.

  All of this - all of the above - combined with the lack of focus on story means the film plods from one action scene which blends into another, but the villains never seem to be on the verge of winning. By the end, its a forgone conclusion that evil SHIELD have lost the day. I just wanted the film to end.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Conclusion:
This is a long review - and all of it negative. That's because if you, the humble reader, were to read the Rotten Tomatoes reviews on this, or look at the amazon reviews, you'd probably come away thinking this was like ""The Dark Knight"". It isn't - it's a decent enough action film that has a superhero in it, which is let down by it's massive time, and it's seemingly endless series of action scenes.

  If you're struggling to believe me, have a read of the 4 star reviews for this film. The majority of them are, stars aside, pretty damning of the movie in the content of the reviews ~ eg

'""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is entertaining, to be sure, but may not be as great as you are led to believe.'

'So, it's well put together, with great production (and moral) values, and certainly popcorn-worthy. But it's not one I'll come back to.'

'My biggest complaint is that the action is relatively non-stop to the point of being tiresome. By the time I got to end sequence, I was more interested in getting the movie over, than seeing what happens next'

'felt like Dick Cheney was waterboarding me'

'No. I'm sorry but no. Not even close. Nothing in this film really ranked too far above average.'

  I really really wanted to like this film - but of late, I've been getting a bit disappointed with the superhero films we're getting. Sure, they're true to the  source material, but is that *all* it takes to make a good film these days? The great comics moments were driven by great plot and characterization - which is why ""The Death of Superman"" isn't considered great, while ""The Dark Knight Returns"" is.

  Here, there is minimal excitement because *omg everything is constantly exciting*, and while it is a massive improvement on the first Captain America, it's Just Not Very Good.

  If you want endless explosions, well, there is this franchise called ""Transformers"" that might fit the bill. I would stay clear of TWS - even on a rainy day, this is a boring, grinding, paint-by-numbers action film that has just too much hype (but to be fair, pick this over Transformers).",1400457600,11,8528,4.630738522954092

I remember I spent the first half of the movie begging for it to pick up the pace and it never really seemed to. just stayed pretty flat the whole time. (Solely my opinion)

The Winter Soldier however, is a night and day difference from it's predecessor! What an improvement. The story flows well and I was enticed from beginning to end. I really can't find anything I dislike about this movie. The action is well-paced there's humor mixed in, the cast is fantastic and everything makes sense. Kudos to the Russo Brothers and their crew.

Speaking of a fantastic cast; Chris Evans is once again fantastic as Cap / Steve. He's really starting to grow into the role, which is great to see. I thought Anthony Mackie was an odd choice when I first heard of him being cast, but he's great, seemed to play well off of Evans. The coolest casting of all was Robert Redford as Senator Pierce. That about made my day haha. Awesome to see him in a superhero movie.

So to sum it up: Just a total kick-ass movie that's a wicked fun time and a huge improvement over The First Avenger. Highly recommended!",1399852800,11,1212,4.475113122171946
5229287,2,B0090SI3EI,"I'm not into comic book movies(and movies in this era in general), so if you feel the same way, this review may help; or it may not.  I think this is the second Captain America movie to come out in recent years.

I won't even try to describe the plot, so I'll just describe the movie the best I can.  Captain America is hanging out and then the SHIELD agency is involved in some conspiracy to stage a false flag attack to consolidate political power with shield.  Scarlett Johansen and Samuel L. Jackson(I think he goes with the eye patch everywhere now) are around helping/screwing with Captain America during the duration of the movie.

Robert Redford plays the bad guy, mostly concerned with power or profits or a combination of both.  The movie is about 2 hours and 15 minutes and there so much nonsensical dialogue that I stopped paying attention to it about an hour into the movie.  There is an interesting subplot where we see the backgrounds of the Captain America project and a fellow soldier Captain America knew who is reprogrammed to go after Captain America.

The main plot revolves around the building of some next generation aircraft which looks like a combination of an aircraft carrier with the engine of a Harrier jet.  There is a fight scene on the ship later in the movie that is entertaining, but most of the movie is this fast paced mess where dialogue, action and fighting is throw at you on screen.

I think this movie is typical of most movies released these days: another comic book movie sequel, aimed at international audiences, over two hours and short on content.  Most teenagers might enjoy this; for you, I suggest popcorn, some herb maybe and some snickers and you might be able to get through this one.",1399766400,7,1736,4.62214983713355
5229288,4,B0090SI3EI,"Marvel's universe continues to expand with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, where Steve Rogers aka. Captain America (Chris Evan) gets involved in a plot to change the world order. It sounds a bit familiar, you know, but unlike Marvel's The Avengers made two years ago, the new Captain America film is surprisingly political. Well, I mean political for a Marvel film.

Captain America suspects there is something not quite right with the recent activities of S.H.I.E.L.D., the espionage agency he is currently working for. As he learns about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new counter-terrorism system Project Insight, he is attacked by a mysterious assassin called The Winter Soldier.

The political aspect of the film is represented by one character Alexander Pierce played by Robert Redford, whose presence reminds us of several 1970s films like Three Days of the Condor and All the President's Men. Fortunately (and unfortunately for some) the films political aspect is not fully developed, being sidelined by a series of action/combat scenes. They are exciting and visually impressive, employing a slightly documentary-like visual style, though I could not help feeling I had seen them somewhere before.

While you can enjoy Captain America: The Winter Soldier as a stand-alone movie, some parts of it will be lost on those unfamiliar with what happened in its direct predecessor Captain America: The First Avenger. Also, even those who know the story of the first Captain America film will find some parts of the sequels story forced and far-fetched. (Did they really need a Peggy Carter scene?)

The big sequence at the end, explosions and all, is one of the best to date. The Captain America character recalls a day when heroes were truly heroic - there's not a trace of irony to be seen anywhere. And of course, Stan Lee's brief appearance adds an amusing touch.

Perhaps I should have said ""the amusing touch."" The only one. This takes itself so seriously that it borders on grim. And, now that we've gotten used to characters with human flaws, failings, and uncertainty, the Captain comes across as one-dimensional, as if the only crayons in the box were red, white, and blue.

So, it's well put together, with great production (and moral) values, and certainly popcorn-worthy. But it's not one I'll come back to.

All because of how much a let-down that film was compared to what it could have been... but getting back to the point...

What a Captain America Film Set In The Modern Day Should Be

Way back when the first Captain America film came out, I was worried that it would change from the noble character that I so love to one that was reduced to nothing more than another ra-ra, blow up everyone who isn't American action hero stereotype. Thankfully, the writers, directors, and star who plays this iconic character seem to get the core of what is means to be Captain America very well. Chis Evans was asked what it was like in an interview and how much he was like the character. He said something to the effect that it is an honor to play a character like him, and he hopes that some part of him is like Captain America. I think that is why this movie is so dang good. Well, part of the reason anyway.

Making this film into a political thriller (with Robert Redford no less!) was a stroke of genius. Yes, there is action, and yes, it is awesome. You believe that Cap really can throw that shield and have it bounce off of three people, then land back in his hands. You believe he can run flat-out at top speed for miles and take out a whole heli-carrier by himself with nothing but a shield and take out a jet after leaping on top of it (this could be unbelievable cheesy but instead you just accept that he really can do these things, and it is incredible). But what makes this more than just another Iron Man or Hulk is that there are sinister plots at play, and the good Captain has to try to get to the bottom or it whilst he confronts a new nemesis and an old friend.

It's self aware

If you are going to take a larger-than-life character and throw him into the real world, you have to be self-aware to a degree or I think it just turns into pure cheese. Here the writing is so good that there's a reason for every trope that's invoked. Yes, the big bad is obvious, and hence no one is surprised at who it turns out to be after the way he has behaved. And when a villain starts monologuing, yeah that was on purpose and for a reason too. What I'm getting at is that this film is exceedingly clever, and that makes it exceedingly entertaining.

It's relevant

The delicate balance of privacy and security, freedom and safety is a hot topic nowadays, and it's at the heart of what this film is about. From the evil organization's point of view, they are the good guys, trying to create a better world. For a comic book film that resonates much more strongly than just a group of power-crazed loonies out to take over/destroy the world. In a world like ours that's gone completely mad, the character of Captain America resonates even more strongly because he represents the a force for good with a conscience (akin to the classic Superman), and definitely the type of person that we should all want to imitate (willing to fight to protect, and sacrifice to save). The world needs people like that now more than ever.

Dark and Gritty, Light-Hearted and Fun

There's a militaristic overtone to this film, and a grittiness to the fights. There's Ridley Scott-style choppiness during close fights and sense that everything is a bit more real world than any Marvel film thus far except perhaps Iron Man. And the story and characters that contrast so well with the title character drive the dark nature of the film time and again, telling him that he needs to wake up to the nature of the world he's found himself in. Joyfully the overall message of the film is the exact opposite, that everyone has to be better than a person who just follows orders and lets things descend into darkness. Heck, the best piece of music on the soundtrack is entitled ""Taking a Stand"". It plays at the climax of the film, but is featured most prominently at the End Credits (which are completely awesome and really should be the Opening Credits).

Thankfully the writers, actors, and director never let things get too dark, and there's plenty of fun silly lines that will make you smile and ease the tension down a few notches when needed. Overall, the film is quite balanced in that regard. It's helped along by some great camerawork and special effects (good old fashioned film-making!). At no point do the special effects overwhelm the film thankfully.

The music is good for the film, but doesn't really stand on it's own except for the the two Ending Credits Themes, which are quite nice. Speaking of ending Credits, yes there are two of them. And there are also two ending scenes that roll after the credits. And yes, they, like this film, were quite worth waiting for. This is great action film, but I have a feeling many people will want to buy a copy to watch at home and pull out when they have a taste for a good political thriller.",1399334400,12,5170,4.454545454545454

Fury is killed, SHIELD is after him, and the only allies he has is the Black Widow and a ex marine who goes by the code name Falcon.

5229297,4,B0090SI3EI,"I was worried that Marvel movies were kind of determined to take Cap and turn him into a sidekick...kind of like Gimli in the Lord of the Rings.  In LotR (book), Gimli was the match of anyone else.  In the movie, they turned him into comic relief.  When Cap had the mini fight with Thor and Iron Man in the Avengers, they showed him as being pretty much nothing compared to the other heroes.  I'm glad that trend seems to be turning.

In the comics, Cap is a master of everything dealing with war and combat.  I'm not a genius on Cap history or anything, but supposedly the serum he took also affected, to some degree, his mind as well as his body.  And with his increased ability to learn he learned everything.  He is the best alive at every aspect of combat, all of the way from planning whole campaigns to winning a bar fight.  He's not just a Spider-man with out a web shooter.  He kicks Spider-man's butt in a fight.  He's the perfect fighter.  Add to that solid morals and perfect courage and you can see why the comic has lasted and has been as respected for as long as it has.  He's a pure hero.

Full kudos on the movie.  It was as intelligent and stunning as I could have ever hoped for.  I would have gladly given it five stars, but for some reason, Marvel decided to put in some profanity.  Time to grow up guys...or has the world just not fallen to shreds far enough for you yet?  Please figure it out.",1398729600,3,1416,4.220149253731344

I introduced her to this new movieverse with the Avengers, and she wanted more. After we watched the Avengers she went back home and started watching all the movies leading up to it. The other great thing is that Marvel has incorporated the tv series (Agents of SHIELD) into the movieverse. Whatever happens in the movies has an effect on the tv series. I love how they have found ways to bring all these movies together into on big universe. I only wish that they could get the rights to the X-Men and Spiderman so they could include them in this universe. Maybe that will be down the road.

5229299,4,B0090SI3EI,"To start, this movie is good.  I really liked it.  I am not going to say it is great as far as movies go, or even comics, but it is somewhere in the middle of the two. Captain America comics have always been steeped in social commentary from day one back in the 40s when the comic started and this movie touches on the modern aspect of the survalliance state.  Is it better to be free or secure?  How much freedom are we willing to sacrifice to be secure?  While this is touched on, its never fully explored.  No sooner does Cap discover Shields plan for world wide survallience, then its revealed the Evil Hydra has taken over Shield, and is plotting to kill millions of people that could stand in their way of future dominance.  No longer is the movie a social commentary on freedom and security, but now a full blown good versus evil.  This movie would have been a far better thriller had it stayed with the concept of no true bad guys, and just well meaning, but miss guided good guys.  This would have been an iconic mission for Cap who represents everything America was in the 40s.  In retro spec, the comics have never failed to explore these grey areas in modern America, but the movie quickly degrades into good vs evil and over the top action.  Regarding the action.  Its awesome, and assures every Marvel Fanboy, Cap would pown Batman in a fight.  My biggest complaint is that the action is relatively non-stop to the point of being tiresome.  By the time I got to end sequence, I was more interested in getting the movie over, than seeing what happens next.  When the action did stop, I had no interest in watching the epilogue and which at that point felt like Dick Cheney was waterboarding me until the credits started.

In comparison to the comic, the movie bares no resemblance to the Winter Soldier Arc in the comic which did have a much stronger plot.  Its a shame they didn't take more from the comic which was a deeper social commentary than this movie.

There was some pleasentness for the fans though.  It was awesome seeing the Falcon in action.  This version of the Falcon is way cooler than the comic.  We had a reference to Doctor Strange, which is all but confirmed a Marvel movie.  Zola appeared in the movie, who next to the Red Skull, is Caps second greatest nemesis.  Its a shame though we didn't get to see more of him, though I suspect the Agent Carter TV show will explore him more.  We also got an origin story for Crossbones, another iconic Cap bad guy who will likely appear in the next Cap movie.  I would of have personnally perferred Nuke, who is a far greater commentary on the Vietnam era and misplaced patriotism.

In the end, this is a fun movie, that missed its strongest potential as a thriller to morph into a summer action flick.  It is extremely fast paced, but in a 3 hour movie, becomes very exhausting by the end.  Mid-way, its basically a paint-by-numbers action movie.  It was an especially nice touch with how well the characters interacted with each other.  You can tell the actors are enjoying themselves.  I was especialy pleased to see how they took a wooden character like the Winter Soldier and showed him in one scene as being deeply vulnerable as he questions his memories only to have him quickly mindwiped back into a ruthless kill.  This shows their is indeed much more to this character than a T-1000 esque bad guy.

For Cap 3, here's hoping for more character exploration on Winter Soldier, more Zola, more social commentary, (Nuke for example,) and how about a M.O.D.O.K. to get us fan boys worked up and eager to watch this over the Superman Vs Batman Cashin and hailmary for DC Comic's flailing movie presense which they questionably decided to open the same day.",1398556800,4,3734,4.508928571428571

5229302,4,B0090SI3EI,"With Captain America: The Winter Soldier we are honestly getting something that is like a mix between ""The Avengers"" and ""Bourne"", but in the absolute best way possible!
First, let me get this out of the way, the film's flaws are few and far between. Alexander Pierce is a totally underdeveloped character, although Robert Redford tries hard to give him personality. The rest of this is honestly just me nitpicking, but one thing the MCU struggles with is killing off characters and once they die making them stay dead, which this film in particular suffers from. A few times, really tense action scenes are somewhat undercut by weird gadgets, like the kill squad bringing and using a battering ram for Nick Furys car, Fury escaping by using by curing a giant whole through the concrete in like 20 seconds(I don't care that Fitz created it, its dumb and overly convenient.) and the super magnetic handcuffs in the elevator scene. Also, the very end of the final battle (""I'm with you to the end of the line"") was a little melodramatic and predictable.
Thats honestly just me nitpicking though. This movie is fantastic!
The Russo's prove themselves to be really great directors! Seriously, they are really good! They bring the perfect amount of tension, emotion, suspense and/or excitement required for each scene! It's actually remarkable that they've never directed a big budget and/or action movie before, because they are so good at it!
The action scenes are outstanding! Each and every one is extremely impressive! The opening scene on the ship was great! Nick Fury's chase though the streets of D.C. was fantastic! The Russo's somehow found a way to make car chases fresh again! The highway battle was awesome and was expertly shot/directed/edited! Finally, the final battle was crowd pleasing entertainment at it's most epic!
The script is outstanding! Every line of the movie has an incredible amount of wit and depth. This is honestly screenwriting at it's finest!
The whole cast is great! Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson in particular bring their characters to new and deep levels. Needless to say, Johansson is incredible and Sam Jackson is absolutely fantastic, delivering lines that will make you laugh and feel the urge to back off.
The music by Henry Jackman is also outstanding! This is easily the best music from the MCU since Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, both in 2008.
This is just a really great movie on every level!",1398124800,2,2449,4.932203389830509

3: It was a game changer...  Without giving spoilers all I can say is that by the end of the movie the MCU is different than at the start",1398038400,,386,4.361111111111111
5229304,5,B0090SI3EI,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe, otherwise dubbed as MCU, continues to expand and impress with each new film introduced into the respective universe and the newest Captain America film, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, exceeds expectations more than ever.  Marvel Studios seems to now uncover pieces of a puzzle to us one at a time, letting audiences dive into the action and lore of the current generation.  Some pieces have several adjacent pieces already exposed in prior releases, while on other sides we have only film titles, future release dates, and a handful of factoids.  Regardless, the amount of cohesion that is the MCU puzzle is impressive and never before been done; Marvel Studios Kevin Feige have pioneered the film industry and what it means to be a franchise.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier fits into the puzzle so well, its quality is on par with or even exceeds Joss Whedons 2012, The Avengers.  Gone are the days of the cheesy Marvel films, audiences now get to enjoy comic book films that are deeply entrenched in nerdery but so well-crafted it is as-if we are watching the newest high-caliber thriller, espionage film akin to the likes of Ludlums Bourne or the grittiness of a Ridley Scott drama.  Captain America: Winter Soldier is no exception, and while uncovering a new piece of the Marvel puzzle to us, it also pulls from the rich genre well of the great conspiracy films from the 1970s Bits and pieces elegantly placed together to create a modern retelling of some of the great genre films of the past.

If curious check out this great article by IGNs Daniel Krupa, 5 Films You Should See After Captain America: Winter Soldier.  Krupa details out specifics references of Winter Soldiers obvious respect to cinema history and recommends some of the best espionage films of the era that Captain America: Winter Soldier most-likely pulls from.

Picking up after the events of the first Captain America as well as The Avengers, the newest entry into the Marvel series places Captain Steve Rogers in a new world, specifically a new world order.  The inside jokes and technological marvels of the second modern millennium are not as confounding to the Captain as they were in The Avengers (2012), but he still lives as a man out of time.  He is conflicted, but at an ideological level.

He pulls upon the threads of a lost life by finding lovers and compatriots of the old.  However, more important than his lust for a forgotten time, he is torn between the ideologies of the time.  Forcing good and evil into a black and white spectrum, just doesnt seem as easy as it was back in the day, and the idea of secrecy and espionage being the mainstay in a constant struggle tears at Captain America, which is essentially the driving force behind the film.

Captain America is in a brave new world and he knows nothing else than being a soldier.  He is at service to his country, and is trying to find his footing in a different type of war.  The film opens with Cap making a connection with a fellow soldier as they run laps around the mall in front of the Washington Monument.  This seemingly small connection expands throughout the film because it provides Cap a connection to the era; war is eternal and the two can relate even across the decades.

Captain Americas newfound running mate is later introduced as Falcon (aka Sam Wilson) played by the talented Anthony Mackie.  Alongside Captain America and Falcon, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson); Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders); and Nick Fury (Sam Jackson) round out the primary protagonists, subsequently pitting them against a villain from Caps past and present in a sweeping plot that will have long lasting consequences upon S.H.I.E.L.D., the Avengers, and the entirety of the MCU.

The action scenes are tightly shot and fluid.  Captain America is finally given the chance to prove his dynamism in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.  He is agile and more gymnastic than he has ever been Obviously refining his skills and training in order to adapt to Norse Gods, men in Iron suits, and, wellHulk, along with a new world paradigm.  Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), who stands by Cap throughout the narrative, is just as fluid and badass as she has been in the prior Marvel films.  This time around we get to see Natasha more in the raw A little bit of backstory and vulnerability are exposed along with a dash of flirtatiousness thrown in for good measure.  Nick Fury remains stoic and secretive as always, but his role within the MCU also is called into question similarly to that of Captain Americas place.

The cinematography and art style is at its best in this film.  Not only does Marvel Studios manage to keep an atmospheric cohesion between two films set seventy-years apart, they also manage to tie the two plot lines to one of Caps greatest villains as well as the massive juggernaut of The Avengers. This is an incredible filmmaking feat and a tricky endeavor on multiple fronts Finesse is the word that comes to mind.  Continuity is tricky, especially when dealing with comics and an expanded film universe that now encompasses nine films and counting, but like aforementioned Captain America: Winter Soldier is merely a new puzzle piece being revealed to audiences.  It fits perfectly in the overall scope of things, and doesnt deviant anyway from the big picture.

The acting is superb in Captain America: Winter Soldier.  Chris Evans is excellent as always and is a more believable Captain America than he ever was a Johnny Storm.  Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow seems to improve every time she stars in a new Marvel film, and the vulnerability and rawness that Johansson brings to the character was particularly believable and refreshing.  It is honestly coming to the point where she could probably handle her own, standalone Black Widow film and Marvel would see the return that they would need to film another.  Anthony Mackie is a standout actor that brings a certain modernity to his role as Falcon and ultimately one of Captain Americas closest friends.  The Winter Soldier was excellently cast and written; the presence, shock and awe, and gravitas that Sebastian Stan brings is impressive.  Villains have always been a comics mainstay, and (as Loki has proven) can be incredibly popular and successful in their own right, and with further backstory and films the Winter Soldier can perhaps reach the lofty height of Hiddlestons portrayal as Loki.  Watching Robert Redford on screen was fantastic.  He played Alexander Pierce wonderfully and his inclusion added another layer of sophistication that rounded out an already stellar cast and well-constructed plot.  Redfords inclusion was very much akin to Tommy Lee Jones portrayal of Colonel Chester Phillips in Captain America: The First Avenger.

The film was impressive to say the least.  The plot line was impressive for its continuity and level of construction; the castings and overall acting were topnotch and more than a couple of decades ago would have been unheard of for a comic book film; the atmosphere, art direction, and cinematography managed to tie in numerous elements of prior films while remaining cohesive is the films high point among many highs.  At the moment, it is difficult to imagine a film franchise reaching such heights, except for maybe Star Wars.

As an aside, I had the pleasure of seeing two different showing of Captain America: The Winter Soldier.  One was opening evening (but was a standard theater showing), however the second viewing was an IMAX 3D one.  I usually don't prefer IMAX 3D presentations due to issues with my contact lenses, but this time around I preferred the experience because it was more enveloping.  The IMAX presentation showed quite a bit more peripheral action in the extended sequences and the 3D was not harsh upon the eyes, actually translating quite well to the viewer.  It was visually stunning and added to an already great cinematic experience.

To cap off such a film, movies goers were shown a brief glimpse into the franchises with not one but two after the credit scenes, so make sure to check out the post-credits before leaving the theater.  The first scene gives audiences as glimpse into The Avengers: Age of Ultron, while the second is little more specific to Captain America.  Nevertheless, they're both worth checking out, so if you plan on seeing The Avengers 2 and/or Captain America 3 stay seated till film stops rollin.",1398038400,4,8462,4.899018232819074
5229305,5,B0090SI3EI,"Saw Captain America-The Winter Soldier for the second time today and I'm sure that I will surprise many Avengers fans when I say that I think its the best Marvel film ever and certainly one of my 5 favorite comic book films. (I've met a few other fans who agree with me that this is the best Marvel film ever.)
Where to start?  The film is almost non-stop action with one fantastic action sequence after another.  Yet there are some nice dramatic moments such as when the Captain visits the now-elderly Peggy Carter, his romantic interest in the first film, now frail and riddled with Alzheimers.  The film has several other good moments like this and others such as the Captain visiting the Captain America exhibit at the Smithsonian in disguise.
If you've read anything about this film (or if you've been watching TV's Marvel's Agents of Shield lately,) you will know the basic plot of this film is the evil Hydra infiltrating the highest levels of Shield.  It is not the Captain fighting aliens in this film like the Avengers but the Captain fighting individuals formerly his friends and comrades.
The entire cast is terrific from the very likeable Chris Evans as the Captain and Scarlett Johanssen a scene stealer as the Black Widow.  Samuel L. Jackson returns as Nick Fury and Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill.  Newcomers include Anthony Mackie as the Falcon and Emily VanCamp (the star of TV's Revenge,) as a fellow Shield Agent. Robert Redford also appears as a highly questionable intelligence official.  Everybody in the cast is great and Marvel legend Stan Lee appears in his customary amusing cameo.
But as stated before, this film has some of the best action sequences that I've seen and a countdown ending that rivals some of the great James Bond films like You Only Live Twice or The Spy Who Loved Me.
I loved the original Captain America-The First Avenger.  I particularly loved the World War II motif.  I love this film even more.  (My only bit of vague criticism is that I wish they had used the Captain America musical theme from the first film.  They use if briefly at the beginning of this film, but thats it.  I'm sorry they didn't use it more.)
Anyway, as stated, I've seen this film twice already and I have no doubt I'll be seeing it again as soon as it is released on blu-ray.  However, if you want a really satisfying time at the movies, go see it while you still can.  (Like the other Marvel films, sit through the entire credits for two additional brief scenes.  There is one fairly important scene partway through the credits and a very brief scene at the end of the credits.)",1397952000,4,2601,4.623913043478261

5229308,4,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America as a character doesn't quite fit in modern culture. He's a flag-wearing patriot who believes in following the chain of command and doing what's best for the country he loves. Perhaps this attitude was a lot easier in World War II 1940s when issues looked so clear. Nazis and the Axis countries were bad; America and the Allies were good. Modern culture doesn't allow for such neat divisions into moral categories. What's a super-soldier to do?

At the beginning of this movie, Captain America is working for S.H.I.E.L.D., a highly resourced and highly effective intelligence agency. One of their ships in the Indian Ocean is raided by pirates intent on ransoming the crew and the scientists on board. Cap leads a rescue mission. In addition to regular S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Black Widow is on the team. After securing the boat, Cap discovers her taking information from the ship's computers, an assignment she had from Nick Fury, head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Cap knew nothing about it and is frustrated that Fury didn't let him in on it. As he and Fury discuss it, Fury acknowledges that Cap wouldn't have gone on the mission if Black Widow's assignment had been the primary goal, but she is willing to do things he isn't. Cap doubts he's working for the right people if information is more important than lives. Fury shows Cap a new S.H.I.E.L.D. initiative that will enable them to kill bad guys even before they are going to commit crimes. It's a combination of low-orbit weapons and high-tech surveillance. Cap bristles even more at this project. Following the chain of command and doing what's best for the country he loves comes into conflict.

A mysterious figure (later identified as the Winter Soldier) tries to kill Fury. Fury goes to Cap's home and tells him not to trust anyone. Things with the project are fishy and he gives Cap the USB drive with the ship's information. Fury is taken off to the hospital and Cap comes into conflict with Fury's superior (played well by Robert Redford), who wants to know what Fury told him. Cap is accused of withholding information S.H.I.E.L.D. needs and has to go on the run. Black Widow joins him, presumably because she's used to trusting no one. Events spiral out of control.

So in addition to the usual comic book film action sequences, which are plentiful and exciting, the film has an elaborate conspiracy plot that keeps viewers' brains engaged. I was a little worried when Cap and Black Widow went on the run they'd be shoe-horned into a romantic relationship but they kept it professional (and Black Widow wasn't treated as eye-candy the way she was at the beginning of The Avengers). The unraveling of the plot is well paced, heightening the drama and providing plenty of opportunities for action. It's a fun film that moves the Marvel universe forward in interesting ways.",1397779200,3,2839,4.849484536082474
5229309,5,B0090SI3EI,"The direction of this movie is a welcome change. I did enjoy The First Avenger (almost more than Thor for nostalgic reasons), but this entry of phase 2 of Marvel's Cinematic Universe is a complete improvement. Instead of witnessing another Superhero movie or another Superhero movie sequel, the audience is treated to a change of pace where you get to explore more of Marvel cinematic universe as if it was ripped from comic author Ed Brubaker's Captain America run. In argubly the best version of Super Soldier, Steve Rogers, we now get to see him becoming more of what Brubaker envisioned: A man out of time with the past haunting his judgment of what is fear and what is freedom. Who can he trust? Who is the real enemy? And most importantly, how will this effect the rest of the continuity.

Actions scenes will not dissapoint for those seeking a smarter summer blockbuster variety and conspiracy flick beautifully intertiwned. Spectacular hand to hand combat is throughout almost rivaling the much appreciated The Raid: Redemption. As a side joke though, you could literally turn this movie a drinking game for the amount of people getting kicked quota.  Marvel comic fans will have fun picking out references and set ups for more related comic characters either hero or villian.

Speaking of villians, The Winter Soldier here is a perfect representation from the comics. The character's ruthlessness is something we haven't seen in a long time at the movies, almost in spirit of the Terminator. If I had to complain about one thing of this movie, is that I wanted more scenes of the Winter Soldier. Maybe a bit more explaining his past. I doubt there will be a director's cut, but I would welcome it if there was more of this guy.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier left me wanting more, but in a positive fan boy way. Avengers: Age of Ultron is too far away. However, next up: Guardians of the Galaxy.",1397779200,4,1909,4.761329305135952
5229310,4,B0090SI3EI,"Directed with the sure hands of brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (TVs Community) from an excellent screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is easily the best of the stand alone Marvel films and a thrilling action film full of big surprises and twists with far reaching consequences.  A superior sequel like X Men 2 and The Dark Knight, it raises the stakes of good story telling and intricate plotting of comic book adaptations in the guise of a political thriller.

Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans) continues his adjustment to 21st century life after his thaw from the deep freeze (in Captain America: The First Avenger) and befriends a fellow veteran, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie).  On a typical mission for S.H.I.E.L.D., Cap and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) lead a team of agents to rescue a pirated ship which turns up an interesting bit of information.  Meanwhile, as S.H.I.E.L.D. readies the major launch of a defense system in Washington, D.C., there are growing concerns expressed by boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to his superior, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford).  As suspicions multiply, all hell breaks loose when there is an assassination attempt on one of S.H.I.E.L.D.s own.  The conspiracy leads Captain America to a confrontation with a mysterious, formidable figure, The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), whose strength and skills are extraordinary. With only a small circle of comrades, everything Cap has come to value comes crashing down. Loyalties are tested and just who will survive a major shift in the world order is just the beginning of an insidious plot.

For fans of Cap, these are grand times as the filmmakers have chosen a major story arc (The Winter Soldier) from his comic annals and incorporated Silver Age characters, e.g. The Falcon (Mackie) and Batroc.  Recently, super hero films have chosen to bend the rules and take chances with tradition. This film goes much further than any previous Marvel adaptation.  It features a good mystery, topical subject matter on individual privacy, and significant plot twists so much so that it is essential for the viewer to watch them unfold without any spoilers.  The smart script contains witty lines amid a pervasive feeling of mistrust and paranoia.  When Cap responds to Furys state of the art weaponry to combat threats and says, This isn't freedom. This is fear, it sums up the theme of the story.  Think of this as homage to 1970s conspiracy classics like Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man.  The film also employs moments that references Mission Impossible, The X Files, RoboCop, and 24.

Acting is uniformly strong as some old, familiar faces return, and a few new ones get introduced.  By now Evans has become the embodiment of the iconic hero, retaining his sense of justice, duty, and morals, virtues which are downright refreshing in a post 9/11 world.  Rogers is a Rip Van Winkle out of his time and still learning to assimilate the world changes and cultural references with amusing results.  Evans chemistry with Johansson is believable yet ironic since their two characters have vastly different backgrounds.  In a costarring role, Johanssons Black Widow is resourceful, smart, and deadly as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative whose history is only beginning to be scratched.  Perhaps Black Widow should have her own film!

Jacksons Fury has an expanded role and reveals more facets of his mysterious background.  Robert Redford (All the Presidents Men) has a significant, atypical role as a high level official, and he is outstanding. His presence alone adds legitimacy and authority to the film.  Mackie (The Hurt Locker) is an ideal buddy in arms to Evans.  Emily VanCamp makes a good first impression as a young agent, and Cobie Smulders (returning as Agent Maria Hill) provides solid backup.

The many impressive action sequences are noteworthy for their ferocity and meticulous detail, but the standouts are a mad, opening car chase through the streets of D.C., and a remarkable fight in a glass elevator that surpasses the gem in Die Hard: With a Vengeance.  There are moments of intense hand to hand combat that recall the best moments of the Bourne films on steroids.  Youve also got to love that shield; the film wisely displays all the creative ways Caps shield is employed in combat.  The violence here is realistically depicted and not cartoonish which pushes its PG-13 rating.  Extensive use of handheld cameras and more live action special effects than CGI lend a stronger sense of realism.  D.C. locations make a splendid backdrop for much of the film.

Taking super hero filmmaking to new heights, Captain America: The Winter Soldier successfully interconnects what we know from previous films and effectively challenges you to reevaluate everything in the Marvel Universe.  It certainly helps to have seen the previous films, but there is sufficient background and context that a casual outsider would still enjoy it.  (Fans of TVs Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will have a field day as the events tie directly with the show.)  Though the film ends with open ended story threads that beg for another sequel, consider this as The Empire Strikes Back of Captain America. Thats not such a bad place to be.

5229315,5,B0090SI3EI,"There is nothing better than when a movie not only lives up to expectations, but actually exceeds them-something that doesn't happen that much anymore, but is certainly true of CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER. By not trying to top THE AVENGERS with its wonderfully over the top action and characters, but instead dropping Cap down in the middle of a conspiracy thriller where he has to constantly watch his back, Marvel has made a movie that makes their very old school 1940's hero totally relevant, not to mention cool, again for the 21st  Century.

And this is how they do it:

First of the plot, which could best be described as a super hero story as written by Robert Ludlum.  Steve Rogers is having a tough time working for SHIELD and Nick Fury, more to the point, getting with a program that values security more than freedom and trust; he's more than willing to take on the bad guys, but this new war is a far cry from what he signed up for in WWII, especially now that SHIELD wants to be preemptive and take out threats before they arise and to hell with due process.  Right out of the gate tension is created between the fish out of water Captain America and the badass Nick Fury.  Then it becomes apparent that SHIELD has been infiltrated by one of the Marvel Universe's great invisible empires of evil, who plan to take control of all their impressive firepower and impose a new world order.  In the blink of an eye, former comrades in arms are enemies and Cap is on the run for his life.

Second is the spot on casting and great characterizations by terrific actors, starting with Chris Evans in his third go round as the First Avenger; not only is he physically perfect in the part, but he gets Cap's integrity and essential toughness just right.  Scarlet Johansson is given much more to do this time around as the Black Widow; here she has to be Cap's right hand when the going gets rough as well as come to grips with her her own less than heroic past.  Anthony Mackie makes Sam Wilson, aka The Falcon, not only an indispensable ally when everyone at SHIELD turns on the Captain, but he's also proves to be a good friend.  Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury finds himself in unknown territory this time out when he's no longer the badass in charge.  Then there is the inspired casting of  Robert Redford as a Rumsfeld like Security council honcho, turning memories of his work in THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN  on their heads. The only false note for me is when Gary Shandling shows up and I suddenly wonder what the hell is Larry Sanders doing here?

Third and maybe the most important is the villain, because what's a super hero movie without an equally powerful super foe?  And in the Winter Soldier, Cap is up against an opponent who is his mirror image in every way.  I'm not giving anything away by revealing that the Winter Soldier is really Bucky Barnes, Cap's best friend and fellow soldier, seemingly dead at the end of the first film. Of course us comic fans book knew better; here he has been enhanced into a super assassin by Arnim Zola with his memory erased.  Nothing captures the menace of this character better than when the Winter Soldier deftly catches Cap's shield in mid air and hurls it back at him; Sebastian Stan has created a villain who is capable of equaling Loki as a fan favorite.

Then there is the well staged action scenes, especially Cap's take down of an elevator filled with SHIELD operatives; that, along with Nick Fury's ambush in his suped up SUV and the climatic battle of helicarriers, are great examples of special effects seamlessly merged within a great story. Seeing all those CGI guns going off makes me wonder what Sam Peckinpah might have done with today's technology.

THE WINTER SOLDIER does an excellent job of expanding and fleshing out the cinematic Marvel universe: Hydra, Batroc, Arnim Zola, Jasper Stilwell, Agent 13.  The mid credit and post credit scenes introduce another one of Captain America's oldest foes, not to mention two other heretofore unseen Marvel heroes, thus opening the door for THE AVENGERS: THE AGE OF ULTRON.  And the there is a strong hint at where a third Captain America film might be going

There are some holes in the story, like how did Zola (Toby Jones in a cameo) transform Bucky if he was a prisoner of the American army?  why didn't Zola's consciousness transfer itself somewhere else before the bunker housing it was blown up? Why not just send the Winter Soldier alone, instead of a small army of operatives, to take out Fury on the the street?  Where are the other Avengers while all this was going on?  Am I the only one who missed Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye?  No matter, the Russo brothers have done justice to Ed Brubaker's original comic story-even if they streamlined it a little too much for some fanboys.

Bring on Ultron.",1397520000,6,4852,4.5844907407407405
5229316,5,B0090SI3EI,"Saw Captain America: The Winter Soldier today.

Bottom line: Awesome; see it.

I had one bit of unpleasantness about it. The camerawork, particularly during the fight scenes was nerve wracking. My daughter or a bit said she didn't want to watch it because it was making her motion sick.

That said, the fight scenes were well choreographed and really captured what I imagined of Cap's fighting style from the comics. The story started with blazing action and never let up. Don't go in expecting deep, philosophical discussion but there is philosophy there.

I do like the interpretation of The Falcon here. I hope they keep the character around in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I was also very pleased by the Black Widow's part in the movie.

One of the things I liked about the comics, at least back when I was reading comics regularly (for various reasons I dropped out in the mid-late eighties) is that they kept Cap patriotic and idealistic without using him as a mouthpiece for partisan politics. Well, there was the occasional break in the latter part of that but the writers were only human. But Cap's devotion to America, and the ideals of its founding (while recognizing the failings of the all-too-fallible humans that organized that founding) is one of the things that made him one of my favorite characters back in the day. And he remains so in the Marvel movies because they appear to be continuing that tradition.

Really, very little negative to say about the move, just that bit about the camerawork. So, yeah, see it.

I do wonder if ""Agents of Shield was picked up for a second season (I haven't seen most of it yet and reviews I've seen on it have been very mixed indeed) and, if so, well, the ending of the movie does present some challenges for that, let us say.",1397347200,3,1784,4.662420382165605
5229317,5,B0090SI3EI,"Note: I will eventually replace this review with a more concise one about tech specs and extras when I acquire the Blu-ray.

As much as I love watching movies, I admit I actually don't watch too many of 'em in theaters. The crowds can be annoying and I hate driving through the small amounts of traffic just to get there and back. But on semi-rare occasions, I'll *make* the effort to go out of my way for certain films. In this particular case, it was to see the next entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier.'

Not sure if this has been mentioned to death already, but, in my opinion, the MCU is a pretty stellar achievement in movie-making. Yeah, they're based on comic books, and comic books probably aren't that special to the general movie-going public (shame on you if you're a part of it). But if you consider the sheer amount of continuity that Marvel has managed to construct since 'Iron Man,' it's amazing how everything has been tied together and continues to do so over half a decade later (with even more on the horizon).

So what's the big draw here? Ever since 'The Avengers' most of the general public (there they go, again) hasn't been as exuberant about any of these Phase 2 movies. 'Iron Man 3' and 'Thor 2' weren't as epic as Avengers; and rightfully so, 'cause why would you want to set expectations so high and just keep surpassing awesomeness? Sure, the films expand on their respective characters. But given the recent moniker, ""masters of the waiting game,"" Marvel did it before by building up worlds and plot reveals with a sprinkle of this and that towards ""the bigger picture."" Heck, they even managed to create 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,' another property that doesn't seem get a lot of love. But guess what? Another payout has been made, and a *huge* one at that.

Firstly, we start off with the expansion of Steve Rogers' character. In Cap 1, we get to see the kind of person he is. In Cap 2, we get to see how his sort of ""old-school mentality"" adapts to the present day. Working with Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D., the adjustments to the modern world seem okay enough, but there's an obvious tension between ideologies. Gone are the straight-forward days of observation and response. Instead, ""protecting the world"" has resorted to covert operations and compartmentalization: missions within missions and withheld information for the greater good. This causes Rogers to question the system, maybe even dislike it. And when things get a little crazy (actually, *very* crazy, but I won't spoil it, 'cause it's a pretty cool surprise that plays out), conspiracy abounds, and allegiances are put to the test.

Remember that ""big payoff"" I mentioned? Well, not only is it a tie-in to AoS, but it's an *absolute* game-changer to the landscape of things from here on out (again, big spoiler that's best to be seen to be believed). Oh yeah, and I haven't even talked about the stupendous action sequences in this film: a hostage rescue mission, a Nick Fury car chase, various encounters with The Winter Soldier, and the grand finale involving a slew of S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives. Take those, put 'em together with some sleek production values, crystal-clear digital cinematography, and an adrenaline-inducing score by composer Henry Jackman, and you've got another formula for, arguably, the best Marvel film since Avengers.

I wouldn't say you *had* to be watching AoS to really get the same impact from the big plot reveal, but I think it will certainly help you appreciate both, Cap 2 and AoS, on a much, *much* higher and more intricate level. Again, I'm simply amazed at the continuity established through the TV show and all these wonderful films. To see such great writing portrayed and carried out with such excellent execution has me so excited for, pretty much, anything else Marvel Studios has coming up next. You simply never know what surprises they'll have in store.

A definite 10/10, and my favorite film of the year, so far.",1397347200,4,3998,4.819241982507289
5229318,5,B0090SI3EI,"After 2014's rocky start, Finally I have a review that is going to be thoroughly positive. And I must say I am not only ready to view this movie a 2nd time, I am Eagerly ready to make the blu ray purchase for Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

After a mission that pits our Captain against a deadly mercenary by the name of Batroc, Captain America is called upon by Alexander Pierce to Shield. But after an immediate distrust between these two and the rise of a new prey simply known as, Winter Soldier, Captain America is thrust into a vicious war.

Chris Evans really upped his level of heroism and expertise in donning the infamous shield with honor. Samuel L Jackson I feel  did a lot better portraying Nick Fury than he did in the previous Marvel movies. And I definitely commend Marvel for making the decision to include Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon. He was definitely well suited to play the character and I do hope we see more of him in the future. Scarlett Johansson's role as Black Widow was just as good; the scenes she and Captain America share make me wonder will they fall in love, or are they already there? And finally to our two forms of evil, one being acting great Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce. While I would definitely like to see Redford in other movies, he had a wondrous outing as Pierce. And finally, Sebastian Stan is the right guy for the Winter Soldier. Not only does he handle the job well, but he puts fear and panic into the minds of all those determined to stop him. Impressive job by all the actors.

There is so much to like that i may forget to write it all down but here it goes. The fight sequences have been getting multiple stamps of supreme approval and they get applause and acclaim from me. With every punch in the movie that lands and every time Cap throws his shield you definitely feel it. Great fight sequences combined with the fact that in the movie you never really know who to trust, which brings me to my thoughts on the story line. The writers of this movie crafted an amazing screenplay; while the way the movie plays itself is almost surreal, with the secrets and the idea of conspiracies within those who are supposed to have the best interest of mankind in their reach. It almost feels like a modern day society, if you know what I mean. The thrill and the suspense only grow with each act and as the credits rolled, the only thing I can remember thinking was: Avengers 2 & Captain America 3 NOW!!

So in what has perhaps been my longest review in awhile, by living up to hype and satisfying everyone's anticipation Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not only one of the best sequels Marvel has put out, it IS one of the best films Marvel Studios has made. I myself cannot wait to view/buy this movie again. And Phase 2 finally put out a movie worthy of

5229319,5,B0090SI3EI,"Let's have a discussion. Well, sort of. This is not going to be a typical movie review for me, because I want to talk about a lot of stuff that doesn't actually pertain directly to the movie but is stuff that is brilliant about the movie. If I had my way, this would be all of us going out after the movie and sitting around talking about the movie. So not a review, but a discussion. Like my wife saying, ""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I just step on your moment?"" was her favorite part and my daughter responding with, ""On your left. On your left. On your left."" Not that I probably won't wrap it up with a bit of a review at the end, but, first, let's talk about some things.

Like the Winter Soldier.

Comic books were a big part of my life for a long time. Something like 20 years. But I've, now, been out of comics for something like a decade, and the Winter Soldier was introduced after I quit reading and following comics. I had no idea who or what he was, so that whole part of the movie was pretty cool. And I'm glad I didn't know anything about it, although it caused problems for members of my family who wanted to ask me questions (because if it's about comics, I almost always have an answer), and all I could say was, ""I don't know anything about the Winter Soldier.""

Then there's the whole Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. aspect of the movie.

Nick Fury is one of those divergences from the comic books. In the comics, Nick Fury, also, fought in World War II and is still alive today because he takes something resembling the super soldier serum that keeps him alive. The Howling Commandos actually ran with Fury during the war, not Captain America. But they've done a great job so far of twining the Fury/Captain America stories into something that works for the movies, and they did that again in Winter Soldier by bringing in major elements of the vs. SHIELD story. Being someone that read that story back in the 80s when it came out, I really appreciated that they worked it in here. And what they did makes me really want to see what's coming next (and makes me really wish I could watch the SHIELD television series and see what they're going to do with all of this there).

I was also gratified with the reveal on Arnim Zola, because I wondered about what they were going to do with him after the first movie. It will be interesting to see how that will play out in the future, too.

Possibly, the best thing, though, was the introduction of the Falcon. I have issues of Captain America going back to when the Falcon was Cap's partner. Or sidekick. Or whatever you want to call him. It's great to see them (Marvel) bringing in characters like this. It gives the Marvel Movie Universe so much more depth. Which brings me to what was probably my favorite line in the movie, ""I do what he does... only slower.""

That's about all I can talk about without giving actual spoilers, which is why it's too bad that you guys didn't go see the movie with me and are sitting around at a Round Table (pizza place) with me eating Parmesan twists and talking the movie. Maybe next time, right?

So, now, the movie:

Captain America: The First Avenger is one of the best super hero movies in terms of capturing the essence of the comic that has ever been done. Of course, Marvel is making it harder and harder to say ""one of  the best"" because they keep doing that over and over. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is easily of the same quality as its predecessor. I hesitate to say that it's better, but it might be. If nothing else, Chris Evans is as much Captain America as he's ever been and I'm beginning to think he may actually really be Steve Rogers.

One of  the things Marvel seems to be exploring is who their heroes are just on their own. Of course, Thor starts out that way, with Odin taking his hammer. Iron Man 3 asks the question of just who is Tony Stark without his armor. And The Winter Soldier not only poses the question, ""I heard you're more than just the shield,"" it puts Cap up against a villain that is able to dismiss the shield as nothing more than a piece of equipment, forcing Cap to be just Steve Rogers. Of course, there's more to it than that, but, again, spoilers.

As I mentioned, Chris Evans is excellent. If nothing else, Marvel has found actors to be the perfect embodiment of their heroes, and it wouldn't actually surprise me to find out that Evans is just a cover for Captain America.

Samuel Jackson continues to be Nick Fury. He's more Nick Fury in this one than in any of the other Marvels so far. Not only is he more in this one than the others (except, maybe, The Avengers), but he really shows us who Fury is.

Scarlett Johansson is everything that you could hope for alongside Cap. And her goal of finding him a date adds humor throughout the movie and comes off completely naturally.

It was great to see Robert Redford in this. His physical presence on camera is just as strong as ever; he was excellent as Alexander Pierce. He oozed politician, and it was great.

But the greatest addition was Anthony Mackie as the Falcon. He was... well, perfect. Just a hint of young Will Smith cockiness but with his own maturity. He's another example of great casting, and I hope we see more of him in the future movies, both Captain America and the Avengers.

If you've liked (loved) the other Marvel movies, I don't see that there's any way that you will not enjoy The Winter Soldier. If you've found that the Marvel movies aren't your style, well, I think you should go home and re-think your life.

5229320,4,B0090SI3EI,"enjoyed the movie much more than the original.  worth a watch, the cameo of stan lee is funny part of movie.  very entertaining, more like an averager movie I thought then captain america.",1397260800,,188,4.666666666666667
5229321,5,B0090SI3EI,"When you go to see a Marvel movie you expect to see some pretty awesome stunts, God like superheroes with swoon worthy bodily attributes, dangerous villains, terror inducing and awe inspiring weapons and a thrilling experience which stays with you for days or even months after you have seen the movie making you go back and watch it any number of times with no loss in its appeal!

 Captain America: The Winter Soldier takes the audience on a yet another dangerous, thrilling, goosebumps inducing ride in present day Washington D.C where The United States, although free is now threatened by a covert and deeply rooted society called the Hydra. Meanwhile SHIELD's Director, Alexander Pierce played by Robert Redford, is planning on launching weapons which will eliminate any threat even before it itself realizes its potential! :)

Add a Nazi era villain to the mix, The Winter Soldier, who will destroy anyone and anything in his path to get the ultimate power over the world for Hydra and a super secretive and somewhat shady, Director Fury ( played by Samuel L. Jackson) and you have a spicy mix of secrets, grey situations and a suspicious outlook towards everyone.

Captain America is restless and undecided on his ideals in the present day world. Struggling to adjust to the present day situations and adapt to his changed responsibilities which often conflict with his ingrained morality, it is very interesting to see how he will face the ruthless, unemotional and his complete opposite opponent, The Winter Soldier.

""Trust no one."" Fury tells him and so starts a battle where no one is to be trusted and anyone can be Hydra!

Will Captain America be able to save the world from the Winter Soldier and will he survive after this?
Who is the Winter Soldier and why is he out to get Captain America specifically?

I loved Chris Evans as Steve Rogers or Captain America yet again with his classic good boy innocence, kind and beseeching eyes and his beautiful transformation into the super warrior Captain America without losing his very appealing innocence and idealistic morality. Only some actors can pull off this very difficult mix of innocence, fragility and strength at once and Chris Evans plays his part to perfection. He often seems almost naive and even frail very unlike the hardened fighter that he is and this is an appeal only present with him. Samuel Jackson as Fury is his usual splendid self and even when he is venturing in the grey, we know that ultimately he is the good guy. His presence is strong and his acting perfect as Nick Fury. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce is amazing and makes his presence felt in the movie with his classically great acting and throws the audience some very interesting but very shocking twists. Scarlett Johansson is the only woman character given so much limelight and she proves that she is one great actor by her flawless acting and dangerous stunts as Natasha or The Black Widow. Sebastian Stan as The Winter Soldier inspires fear and a chill in the hearts of the viewers with his picture perfect acting and even the lack of dialogues does nothing to diminish his presence. Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson or Falcon is funny, vivacious and daring. His presence makes the otherwise very dark movie, so much fun. His acting is great, his stage presence strong and he is funny. :)
Last but not the least, Toby Jones as Dr. Zola inspires fear, hate and anger with his classic acting and even though he has a very short role but still he makes the viewers remember him from among a hoard of characters. :)

The direction is crisp and the editing first class. As soon as you start feeling that a scene is stretching, the flow changes and you are thrown head first in another intensely satisfying scene connected beautifully with the previous and the subsequent one. The photography is skillful and vividly captures the surroundings, making all events and actions so real as if we are there. All aspects of the movie are beautifully handled to give us a story which is both captivating and thrilling.

Intense action, great editing, expert photography, elaborate sets, great makeup and costumes, skilled direction and great actors make this movie worth every rupee spent. A strong recommendation that you go watch the movie and do wait till after the end credits to ensure that you don't miss the secret endings. I am told that there are two of them in this movie. I seem to have missed the second one. :(

A full 4.5 out of 5 to  Captain America: The Winter Soldier. So go watch, enjoy and I hope the next part releases soon. Do let me know if there really were two endings. :)

5229322,5,B0090SI3EI,"Ok, so the story goes something like this. We were out with friends, just finished eating pizza, and the excitement was high. you see, we'd been waiting for this moment since we saw the first trailer. Taking our tickets, we hand them to the guy at the front entrance and load up on popcorn, hurriedly making our way into the theater afterwards. Previews begin and I endure them (most trailers don't wow me a whole lot)... there goes Spiderman, X-men, Guardians of the Galaxy, a fantasy thing with Jolie... then the feature film begins with the trademark Marvel slogan. Then the soundtrack plays. Then the first line is spoken... ""On your left...""

Thus began the best 140 minutes of my recent movie-watching experience...

So, about two years after the events in The Avengers, we find that Steve Rogers (Extremely well-played by Chris Evans) is residing in Washington DC, getting used to modern life and adjusting to the things of today's world having been frozen for over 70 years. As a career, he works as S.H.I.E.L.D's champion - being sent on various missions with his fellow agents to keep the peace and end threats around the globe. In his private life, not only is he getting used to the current culture of America, but he is also pursuing friends and starting to distrust others. Mostly, his life is getting back to normal (as normal as a supersoldier's life can get). This pattern suddenly gets interrupted after his superior, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), is attacked and killed by an unknown enemy. S.H.I.E.L.D, suspicious of the Captain's involvement with his own friend/boss' death, turns on him, and he is forced to run, for both his life and the drive to uncover the scheming plot that is boiling within the organization that is now out to kill him. Unable to complete this overwhelming task on his own, he is forced to team up with the sly Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a new face in the Marvel Universe... The Falcon aka Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie). They make progress together and learn to count on one another, but as the trio continues to dig deeper and scratch past the surface of their goal, the threats continue to mount against them. Not only do they find out that enemies lurk everywhere, but they discover that even close friends, co-workers and people they originally trusted and loved... are not who they once were. The Captain learns this more than anyone else...

Allow me to go into what sets this film on the top of the Marvel totem pole ... even more so than The Avengers which I sincerely didn't think would be able to be topped.
First, this movie displays real heart and emotion - real reasons why we should root for these guys (and girls)... it brings up themes that I didn't really expect from a superhero film... contains twists and turns that would make other movies a little jealous... and contains fighting sequences that are on par if not better than ANYTHING I've seen in the Bourne Movies. But the list doesn't just stop there. Humor is very well done here - and rarely feels out of place. Excitement is high and, of course, CGI and special effects are absolutely breathtaking! I should also add a little bravo for the guys at Cleveland, as this film was partially filmed there. WOOT! WOOT!

Now let's go into a wee bit more detail, shall we? (you can stop now if you like).

EMOTION  - I will say this right now... Do NOT expect the comedy and constant silliness that were in the last two movies! This is truly the most emotional and dark Marvel film to date. By ""emotional"", I don't only mean the commonplace humor and excitement that all movies can easily serve their audiences... but true tension and worry - as well as sadness and even tear-jerking. That's right... crying! Without giving too much away, I can think of at least three such instances where I felt my eyes get wet: One involves the Captain and his former love interest (SO SAD!). Another is the death of Nick Fury (extremely well done and realistic). And another involves the Captain and a friend of his (you'll know which scene(s) I'm talking about when you watch it).

Note to parents: Don't worry about your kids watching this one, though. By ""dark"" I don't mean that it's inappropriate in any way. No strong language. Little Blood. No sex or drug use. It's completely MATURE kid friendly...

TENSION - And as for tension and worry - it's real... and you FEEL it. There were numerous instances where I went ""Oh-no!"" or ""OMG!"" in both amazement and fear. You can feel the threat that looms over the heroes. You legitimately worry over these characters - even the so called ""title villain"". You sense every blow they receive and every blow they deal their enemies. Though we always know how these Marvel movies will end up, the journey that takes us to that end is so stressful (in a good way) and nerve-racking that it doesn't have the same ""good guys always win"" vibe to it.

HUMOR - one of the things that has bugged me SO much with these latest marvel films is the ridiculousness and ill-timing of the jokes... and the tendency to constantly bring in things that the writers THINK is funny, but really is just plain irritating. Some people amount that to Disney's take over of Marvel and I can understand that. Let's face it, Disney isn't exactly famous for it's serious stories. I, personally, amount it to the writers and directors. This film has proven to me that it isn't the company's fault, it's the guys with the pens. Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 were so loaded with comedy that it's impossible to feel worry for the characters... and you can never take the plot seriously. It makes the ending that much more predicable when characters are constantly throwing jokes out there and doing goofy things.
Now, don't get me wrong, I like humor. Humor is a human element that you can't take out of a story no matter what (unless you want a depressing story like The Road). However, it has to be done right... and praise the Lord that this movie almost always gets it right. Most of the jokes apply to the situations and really ARE funny. Never is it in-your-face and it never really breaks the overall mood of the story. Nor does it make you forget the mission at hand and the danger that is up against the ""good guys""

EXCITEMENT - this is downright the most adrenaline-pumping film I have seen in, hmm, maybe the last few years? Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (also starring Anthony Mackie) and the Bourne Movies gave me a similar feeling, but not like this. Not to the extent that this film brought out. My clothes were literally wet with sweat when we left after the credits and my body was stiff from sitting for the time I had... time that went by SO fast that it didn't feel like over two hours, yet at the same time it was perfectly satisfying and never felt rushed.

THEMES - the topics that this film shares with it's audience while telling it's story revolves primarily around government secrecy and what happens when a government is infiltrated by the enemy. It's extremely well-done and thought-out HOW this take-over was done. At first I was skeptical as the explanation began, but as it all started to be pieced together... I realized the brilliance of it all.
Two other topics that are explored is the grey area of protecting people - the morality of sacrificing the few to save the many... as well as the struggle that veterans experience when they finally return home from active war duty.

TWISTS AND TURNS - The plot bends so many times during the movie that it will take at least two viewings to really catch where all the surprises begin... and mind you, there are a LOT of them here in this film. No sooner do you think the story is going one way, than it  shifts naturally (for the most part) and the story goes a different route. Thinking back, I can see all the hints that these twists were coming up, but at the moment of viewing it was so well hidden and fit in so well with the story that I was rarely caught unsurprised. At one point I was like, ""Oh comon! Really? How did that character do that?"".... then the story gives a quick explanation... or reveals that everything wasn't what it seemed, and the story continues... getting better and better as it goes.

ACTION - OH... MY... GOODNESS! Never have I seen such good choreography and special effects in an action movie... ever. This is leaps and bounds over the stuff that is showcased in the first Captain America, and way better than anything in previous Marvel movies with the possible exception of The Avengers. Possible exception.
The combat looks painful. Looks powerful. Fits each and every characters' play style. And never feels biased toward one faction or the other. What I mean is that it doesn't have the happy sappy fighting like the last two Iron Man movies... nor does it go from darker to black with good guys and heroes dying here and there - at least not in the ending. Finally we get to see the Captain's real powers and skills! Finally we get to see Black Widow and all her gadgets! Finally Nick Fury gets a good action scene! FINALLY we feel conflicted when the ""villain"" characters fight the heroes...
Plus, the two car scenes in particular have got to be the BEST I've seen in any movie... outdoing both the Bourne movies and the opening sequence of World War Z. Yes, yes, I know we've been beaten over the head with car chases in just about EVERY action movie, but these are so well done and fit in so well with the story that it doesn't register as a clich unless you over-analyze it.

CONSISTENCY - Lastly... and this is the biggest one that makes this movie the greatest Marvel installment yet. It's the most consistent with it's origin story... and really the whole MCU. For example: Reminders and tie-ins with the first Captain movie are scattered throughout the plotline taking the form of flashbacks, words and emotions, explanations from certain characters, or simply the environment... such as, a, um, museum?
One such moment involves Black Widow and the Captain after a fight that would've resulted in one of them dead. Not only is it emotional and drives the story forward... but it gives yet another blip of insight into the character of Black Widow and what may be going on inside her head.
Another Marvel tie-in involves the senator from Iron Man 2 (played by Garry Shandling) and fleshes out the reasons as to why he wanted Tony's suits in the first place. Absolutely brilliant.
There are many others... but I'll let you guys see it for yourself...

If there are any things I would criticize about this film (and mind you, I'm approaching nitpicking now), it would be some of Scarlett Johansson's lines that seemed forced, possibly the lack of development for Sam Wilson (The Falcon) and fewer character interactions when compared to The Avengers. Also, a few moments seem in need of a little more time to truly flesh things out.
Another thing someone commented on was the total abandonment of physics concerning the Captain's super shield... but comon! It's a superhero movie! It isn't super unless you have fantastical elements in it. To said critic (who will remain unnamed): At least it wasn't outright ridiculous like flaming humans who can break through Iron Man's suits when even military-grade missiles can't.
Other than the above, to criticize anything else would be extreme complaining and perfectionism as this film is an absolute superhero masterpiece in terms of heart, humor and head-screwing. Don't believe me? Well, go ahead and watch it for yourself (after seeing the First Captain America and The Avengers).
Is it art? No. Is it artsy? Not really. Is it literary? Not at all. But is it an adrenaline-pumping, mind-scrambling, thought-provoking, tear-jerking, roller coaster of a superhero/action film? 100% YES!!!

Just go see it. To me, it's the Best Marvel Movie. Best Action Movie. And one of the best films I've seen in my life. No Bulls***.",1397260800,11,11908,4.662857142857143

5229324,5,B0090SI3EI,"I loved the movie. I am a Captain America fan, so may appear a bit biased, but my sister (who is in no way, shape, or form a part of this fandom) enjoyed it as well, so I feel pretty good about my opinion.

First, let me gush about the acting. Chris Evans makes for an amazing Steve Rogers - so much so that I am not sure what Marvel is going to do if the rumors about him leaving the franchise after this movie prove true. Scarlett Johansson is similarly a perfect fit for the Black Widow, capturing the chameleon of an operative with the charm and strength the character deserves. Samuel L. Jackson /is/ Nick Fury (and I cannot bring myself to hate him, no matter how sneaky his character gets), and Cobie Smulders absolutely owns the persona of Agent Maria Hill.

Now. The Witner Soldier. (SPOILERS AHEAD)

Sebastian Stan - where do I begin? I adored Bucky in Captain America, but people he almost made me cry in this movie. There was so much pain in his eyes after he saw Steve - it is precisely this kind of dedication to the character that separates a movie about superheroes and explosions from the category of ""mindless action film."" The only other comic-verse movie that moved me this much was X-Men: First Class (Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy's Erik and Charles). I look forward to seeing how the relationship between Bucky and Steve plays out.

Finally, I simply loved the action. Yes, there are a lot of explosions, car accidents, hellicarrier accidents (they should just stop building those, never ends well for them), lots of Chris Evans' muscles - but you know what? It worked. The fight scenes were exciting, and not only in the show-off kind of way; many of them were rooted in emotion (such as those between Steve and the Winter Soldier, or Steve and the SHIELD agents), prompting the viewers to consider what is right and wrong in the situation rather than feeding them mindless violence.

All in all, this movie was totally worth seeing. I will probably be buying the DVD version once it comes out, as well.",1397174400,5,2033,4.558904109589041

5229327,5,B0090SI3EI,"NO PLOT SPOILERS.

In this film Captain America (Chris Evans) is attempting to catch up. He is losing some of the dorkiness which made him lovable. He teams up with the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) because she tested well with male audiences in the 8 to 80 age bracket. Iron Man is mentioned, but it seems the rest of the Avengers are on vacation during the struggle for humanity.

This film has a decent plot (i.e. fitting bad guys for good guys) with a good mix of action and drama. It even has some light moments such as when our twosome are among some old computers and Black Widow does her 1983 ""WarGames"" voice and proclaims, ""Shall we play a game?"" Of course Captain America can't catch the humor.

Great popcorn film that explodes on the screen. I enjoyed this more than the recent Thor film.",1397088000,,804,4.493150684931507
5229328,5,B0090SI3EI,"As a big fan of Captain America, I had big expectations for this film, and it did not disappoint. The Winter Soldier is by far the best of the Marvel stand-alone movies, and challenges the Avengers as the best of the series. period. The cast is almost perfect, even down to Batroc the Leaper, and of course Chris Evans is near flawless as Captain America-being a morally centered, honest, loyal, and caring guy who can also kick your ass is not easy to do without it being corny, yet it is execute brilliantly in The Winter Soldier. Samuel L Jackson gives a solid performance as Nick Fury, and Scarlett Johannson brings even more depth to the Black Widow, actually making her a human being rather than a hot looking ninja. Robert Redford is surprisingly cool and cunning as the very ambiguous Alexander Pierce. Anthony Mackie is excellent as Falcon, once again turning an action hero into a real person that you care about. The Winter Soldier, played by Sebastian Stan, does a good job of looking menacing-and he truly is menacing, but his dialogue is minimal throughout the film.

Where the film shines is in it's organic nature. Cap is a superhero that does not use lasers, missiles, or magic; he delivers the pain with his fists and his shield. As it were, the action sequences in the movie are up close and personal, and use a minimum of CGI, which is a huge plus. The action seems real-world, not comic book, which works extremely well in the film, and there are several great showcases of Cap's fighting ability and athleticism, which are touched upon in the other films but not fully developed.

Not lost in all of this is the story, which is the best (and probably best acted) and most thought-out in the Marvel series. Without giving away too many plot points, Cap soon learns that not everything in SHIELD, already an organization which isn't known for being forthright, is as it should be. Cap, seeing that he has fewer and fewer allies that he can trust, soon finds himself in a fight not only for his own survival, but the fate of the entire world.

Lastly, this is not a movie for little kids. There are several very real, and very violent shoot outs. As I said, this isn't superheroes beating up each other comic book style, there are gun fights and hand-to-hand sequences that are quite intense, and that is what makes the movie stand apart from the other Marvel films. Also, the Winter Soldier's plot is the most essential thus far in the Marvel series, not only standing tall in it's own right, but progressing the series much farther than the other stand alone films. The Winter Soldier is also the only movie in Marvel's Phase 2 which serves as a direct prequel to the next Avengers film.

Overall-this movie really raises the bar in the Marvel universe. A great story, top notch acting, intense action sequences, and continuing plot lines are where the bar is set in the Marvel series of films, and The Winter Soldier now stands at the top of the list as one of the best in the genre.",1397088000,5,3005,4.5799256505576205
5229329,3,B0090SI3EI,"Because the movie has Captain America, who is thoroughly amazing and cool, the film is overall enjoyable. But I do not understand the extreme hype around this film extolling its merits. It's good, but it's not that good.

The strengths of the film all definitely involve the titular hero. Marvel has definitely succeeded in adding some great depth, soul and levity to their boy scout. This film gives him near superpowers as his strength and speed are showcased at heretofore unseen levels of athleticism. His furious fistfighting and slick shield-throwing are superbly done and always a highlight. Whenever Captain America is onscreen, fighting or otherwise, the movie is great.

Unfortunately, he doesn't dictate enough of the action. Black Widow and Falcon are bigtime sidekicks who often steal the show and the story. Both are fine in their portrayals, but every time one of them gets an action sequence, that basically means it's yet another scene without the Captain. Add in Nick Fury, Maria Hill, Agent 13 and Robert Redford all as other heroes trying to solve the mystery and save the day, and the narrative becomes quite crowded with inferior protagonists all stepping on each other's feet. Again, they are good, but not as great as the main attraction, who is often relegated to the background while the others clamor about what to do next.

For villains, there's only one, and unfortunately he only appears sporadically and with minimal effect. I don't know if he even speaks for the first hour and a half. Most people who know their superhero movies will often cite the quality of the villain as a primary contributor of the film's overall success. So while classic characters like the Joker, Loki, Magneto or Lex Luthor can add to the fun of a film, the Winter Soldier is honestly the driest bad guy in the modern superhero film boom.

The story really isn't that smart and is quite predictable. Some may get caught up in the fancypants talk of spooks, spies and double-crosses, or touched by the many philosophical musings on freedom, liberty, information, NSA/Snowden/drone talk. But this really only amounts to far too many scenes where characters blankly recite these dull bloviations about modern American surveillance. The film easily could've chopped a half hour of this rambling claptrap from its 2hr+ runtime and benefited for it. These dull diatribes are solely designed to trick you into thinking this very stock ""traitor amongst us / world domination"" story is anything deeper than a subpar subplot on ""24.""

Ultimately, I blame Captain America's lackluster outing here on Disney. The Avengers and origin movies were all superb classics. But now that Disney has its fangs on these properties, every sequel has been packed with way too many side characters to boost the subsidiary merchandise sales and global appeal, always trying to be all things to all people. With all of Cap's buddies on the scene, it's like watching Batman running around with Robin, Gordon, Alfred, Batgirl and Nightwing all in tow, which are always goofier and more childish affairs, never as good as stories concentrating solely on the main hero. As Disney has repeatedly proven their inability to handle live-action sci-fi/fantasy adventure properties - see the calamitous ""Tron,"" ""Lone Ranger, ""John Carter,"" ""Oz,"" or ""Pirates"" 2 through 4 movies - it's little surprise that the Marvel films are also depreciating in quality too despite their talented stars and big-budget FX.

Diehard superhero fans will enjoy the movie, but seasoned filmgoers will see that the spy thriller aspect could have been far smarter and more involving. But thankfully, just like how Captain America often saves the world, here he also saves this movie from being a simple and nonsensical bore.",1397001600,10,3774,5.069243156199678

5229333,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: He's both the quintessential and the antithesis of the Marvel superhero. On his most basic level, he's perceived as an overgrown, superhumanly strong Boy Scout with a shield, which is a huge stretch from almost all of Marvel's other big heroes, who are either demigods, armored geniuses, genetic misfits, irradiated rage monsters, or radioactive spider-bite victims. But if you go beyond that surface, he's perhaps Marvel's most complex superhero. He's a man out of his time who suffers with adjusting to the modern world, who lives with survivor's guilt beyond anything that other heroes can comprehend, and has a very black-and-white moral world view. But times change, and sometimes what makes a hero great isn't just what he does, but who he is, and that is why Captain America is such a great hero. Tony Stark's assessment of him in THE AVENGERS, when he tells him, ""Everything special about you came out of a bottle"" simply isn't true. Steve Rogers had the heart and soul of a hero when he was still a ninety-pound asthmatic. He's the man to lead the charge against evil, but in our time, the heroes and the villains are not as black-and-white as they once were. How can you lead a fight when you don't know who your enemies are? That is just one of the many questions raised in CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, which is easily the best of the standalone Marvel Cinematic Universe films.

THE WINTER SOLDIER, based loosely on the instant-classic comic arc by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Steve Epting, begins with showcasing Steve Rogers (reprised again in his third/fourth appearance in this role by Chris Evans) as a man with a new mission. He works as an agent of SHIELD, taking point for their tactical team, rescuing the good guys and stopping the bad guys, and has been doing this since the events of THE AVENGERS. He, along with fellow agent Natasha Romanoff aka The Black Widow (reprised for a third time by Scarlett Johanssen), are tasked with saving SHIELD hostages from a crew of pirates. While Cap does most of the heavy fighting, Widow has a mission of her own that leads the rest of the film. It initially illustrates how different Cap and Widow are when it comes to their duties and how it puts Cap and SHIELD director Nick Fury (reprised here for the fourth/fifth time by Samuel L. Jackson) at odds. The strange computer program Widow recovers leads Nick to the office of Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), the secretary/liasion to the World Security Council (some of whose members we initially met in THE AVENGERS), and this meeting prompts Nick to understand that something is amiss. Nick is then assaulted by a mysterious figure known to intelligence sources around the world as The Winter Soldier. The identity of The Winter Soldier is known to fans of the comics, but isn't something I could spoil here. This tragic incident suddenly puts Cap and Natasha at odds with SHIELD, not knowing who to trust, and gains them a new ally in Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), a former Para-Rescue soldier with an amazing exosuit with jets and wings that earns him the nickname of Falcon as they have to stop the forces both without and within to not only save millions of lives, but a personal stake that Cap has with The Winter Soldier.

To call THE WINTER SOLDIER simply a big-budget tentpole superhero film is to do it a disservice, because it is so much more than that. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo (best known for their work on the television show COMMUNITY) and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (also writers of CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER and co-writers of THOR: THE DARK WORLD) have created a superhero film of the modern age of technology and how it can be easily abused in the name of ""freedom"". It's an extremely timely film in the days of drone strikes and the NSA surveillance scandal, but it's also a great throwback to the classic 70's paranoia thrillers like THE PARALLAX VIEW, as well as THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (the latter two starring Redford, so having his presence in the film is a huge casting coup for this type of film). They are artfully able to insert this undercurrent of subversion to the superhero film amongst all of the superheroics going on, and they ARE super. Almost every action sequence in the film is practically worth the price of admission alone, from the opening scene vs. the pirates led by Batroc (who is a second-tier villain well-known to Cap fans) to Nick's car chase confrontation to Cap's elevator fight to Steve, Natasha and Sam's first run-in with The Winter Soldier (which was a sequence so expertly tense and bravura that it reminded me of the street shootout in Michael Mann's HEAT).

The film doesn't skimp on the surprises, either. The re-emergence of a believed long-dead threat personified in a slightly more realistic way than the character is represented in the comics is a little clunky with its hyper-expository monologuing, but ultimately fits well into the framework this film has presented. Also nice to see are Cobie Smulders reprising her role as Agent Maria Hill and Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter, both young and her older self in an incredibly heart-rending scene. But these elements are all enhanced by the other performances here. Evans continues to make his earnestness and humor and heroism blend seamlessly together in his best work in this role to date. Johanssen also continues to nail the hard edges of Black Widow, while letting cracks in her tough-as-nails and controlled veneer crack slightly to see more of the inner wounds she carries with her. Also something that's nice about her character in this film is that she's not there just for eye candy nor for a romantic interest. She's her own character and while Johanssen firmly owned this role in THE AVENGERS, she does harder work in this film, and deserves more praise. Jackson does his best work to date during his tenure as Nick Fury. He's finally given something to do other than stand around, verbally lay down the law, and look foreboding. Redford is fantastic as Pierce. He has the front of being an ultimate bureaucrat, but there's something menacing behind that exterior, which Redford has more than enough gravitas to convey. But the real star of this film is Mackie as Sam Wilson, who is an actor I've loved since first seeing him in THE HURT LOCKER, and he really gets a chance to shine extremely brightly. He has such an immediate chemistry with all of his compatriots and is totally believable and accessible, being kind of the ""normal guy"" of this mix and being thrust into this chaos, he's still able to keep his character's focus and make him smart, tough, capable, funny and human. There's nothing token about his character, which I've seen in some reviews as a complaint, and it's absolutely not true. It's hard to talk about the specific actor portraying The Winter Soldier, but he is totally 100% believable as a badass villain, but also completely sympathetic and kind of heartbreaking as the film reaches its climax, understanding what he's endured. He's a perfect balance to Cap as another soldier out of time, but not understanding what he's fighting for.

Also a definite high point is the score by Henry Jackman, the composer behind some great recent scores such as X-MEN: FIRST CLASS and CAPTAIN PHILLIPS. One of the beautiful things he gives this score is a slight discordant combination of notes when The Winter Soldier appears. It's music in the key of fear, but almost imperceptible, which is similar to the bow-against-the-electric-guitar-string theme that Hans Zimmer gave The Joker in THE DARK KNIGHT (although, this might be no coincidence, since Jackman also worked on TDK as well).

While I may not love this film as instantly and as easily as THE AVENGERS, it needs to be understood that this is a much deeper film than any of the previous entries into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While a piece of raw entertainment like THE AVENGERS is extremely well-written and well-acted, it's pretty much all surface. You know exactly what you're getting when you bought your ticket. With THE WINTER SOLDIER though, there are so many game-changing elements for the characters as well as the whole of the MCU. But more than that, you leave the theater asking questions not only about the film, but about the state of security in our world, and those are some really deep questions to be posed by a ""superhero movie"".",1396828800,3,8468,4.813186813186813
5229334,5,B0090SI3EI,"In the not so distant future (much like Star Wars lovers continue to reminisce about the original trilogy), comic book fans, film critics, and anyone else that simply appreciates good movies will look back on this period in history and be flat-out astonished at what Marvel Studios has accomplished with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).  From the initial release of Iron Man, culminating with a superhero bonanza in The Avengers, the MCU has managed to set the bar a little bit higher with each new chapter.  In Phase II, Iron Man III and Thor: The Dark World continuously pushed the proverbial envelope, not only with interesting adventures post-Avengers, but also with creating and establishing a specific tone of discontent in the aftermath of an alien invasion.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier deals directly with the outcome, serving as a direct sequel to the events of Marvel's The Avengers.

Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (TVs Arrested Development), Chris Evans returns to the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America in the sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier.  In the aftermath of the Battle of New York, Cap is still finding it difficult to adapt to the modern world.  In the mean time, S.H.I.E.L.D. has implemented Operation: Insight  a project overseen by S.H.I.E.L.D. director, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), that will (when completed) allow three state-of-the-art Helicarriers the ability to eliminate potential and individual threats in moments.

Abruptly, Fury is brutally attacked by a masked assassin, called the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), thrusting Captain America into a diabolical mystery that also quickly warrants the attention of one of Furys closest friends and World Security Council member, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford).  Cap, refusing to cooperate with Pierce (after Fury warns him not to trust anyone), is quickly flagged as a fugitive for allegedly withholding information.  On the run, Cap turns to Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to aid him in tracking down the Winter Soldier.  Severely outgunned with S.H.I.E.L.D. constantly in pursuit of them, the Avengers duo must then turn to a new ally and former military paratrooper, Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) for additional help.

Unfortunately, comic book films receive a vast amount of criticism and are often given far better initial treatment than they deserve.  Iron Man III was given heavy praise right out of the gate, but looking back at it now  its a relatively average film.  Even the excitement surrounding Marvels The Avengers has finally cooled to the point that the real examination of the $1.5 billion juggernaut can begin (again, like the Star Wars trilogy is still examined and interpreted today).  Regardless of its minor flaws, The Avengers is without a doubt a monumental achievement that no other MCU film can transcend (other than possibly Age of Ultron)  and that immediately includes The Winter Soldier, too.  But, thats not to say the newest Cap adventure isn't an outstanding individual superhero flick or spectacular flick in its own right.  In fact, The Winter Solider is easily a top-three MCU film (right behind The Avengers and Iron Man).

Chris Evans continues his contractual obligation to play Captain America (yes, that's a sarcastic remark based on his recent comments), but with this being his third film playing the part, hes visually comfortable in the role.  Steve Rogers story progresses steadily, sort of learning on the fly how to navigate through the political waters of working for S.H.I.E.L.D.  At the same time, his past is far from forgotten (not just because Bucky Barnes makes an unexpected return), but also because a few familiar faces from The First Avenger appear alive and well.  The meeting youd fully expect to take place finally does, in which Steve pays a visit to his old (literally) love interest, Peggy Carter  portrayed by future TV star, Hayley Atwell.  And, as Cap delves deeper into the mystery of the Winter Soldier, he is surprised to discover the Red Skulls former sidekick, Arnim Zola  portrayed again by Toby Jones, has also managed to live on past his expiration date.

The rest of the supporting characters, including Nick Fury, face their own set of past demons and personal conundrums.  If theres one person that is most affected by the events of this sequel, its easily Nick Fury.  And, if Fury is around, you know The Black Widow cant be far behind.  The climax of this film, though centered clearly on Cap and Bucky, still has plenty to do with the franchise's new addition The Falcon, and the Black Widow.  Natashas past, momentarily referenced in this film and The Avengers, appears to be so deep in secret that it could wind up warranting a solo adventure for Johansson.  The idea of a possible Black Widow/Hawkeye/Winter Soldier project is enticing  based on the characters onscreen and comic book involvements together.  And, speaking of Hawkeye  despite the absence of Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) in this film (which is completely bothersome given his connection to S.H.I.E.L.D. in both Thor and The Avengers), news that he will play a major role in Age of Ultron is reassuring.

For the legions of comic book fans, the origin story of the Winter Soldier will be a main discussion point.  Ed Brukbaker, the man responsible for creating the Winter Solder persona, used a far more invasive plot than the film had time to incorporate.  Buckys absence, in the years since his apparent death in The First Avenger, is easily explained and straightforward, yet still true to the essence of the comic storyline.  Regardless of your final opinion on this well-trained adversary, the reveal of the films true villain will leave you disappointed if you were expecting the reemergence of the Red Skull.  But, the Skulls vision of the future has never been more important and it runs rampant through every inch of this film.  We will have to hold on to hope that Hugo Weaving will want to return to the role after The Winter Soldier becomes a critical and commercial success.

Overall, Captain America: The Winter Solider is nearly a perfect solo comic book film by every possible criteria  although the abuse of additional character appearances (Black Widow, The Falcon, Nick Fury) will need to stop at some point, or it simply won't be a solo film anymore.  Never the less, The Winter Soldier is action-packed, full of character development, and will  above all else, leave you begging for more.  The only real complaint is the lack of mystery surrounding the villains, especially the identity of the Winter Soldier (though its obvious to readers by the films title).  In any event, The Winter Soldier completely changes the landscape of the MCU, and it will be interesting to see how the events of this film play out in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

P.S.  As usual, don't leave your seat until ALL of the credits have rolled.  There are two post-credit scenes, one of which is a direct lead-in to Age of Ultron (and was even directed by Joss Whedon), while the other scene mildly adds on to this films conclusion.",1396828800,3,7147,5.044293015332197
5229335,5,B0090SI3EI,"CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER is perhaps the best film Marvel Studios has released and here are my SPOILER FREE reasons why:

1. CAST:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chris-Evans/dp/B009EEMJ0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chris Evans</a>'s performance as Steve Rogers has always been for me, the most compelling, relatable, and interesting of the Avengers. His moral compass clashes with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s grey view of the world to thought-provoking effect. Supporting him is a charismatic and badass cast:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samuel-L-Jackson/dp/B005T5MYXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samuel L.

But the true standouts of the film belong to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-Redford/dp/B004EERGHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert Redford</a>, who, without revealing too much, is compelling and riveting, and also the best character of his kind that Marvel has put out yet. Yet the real scene-stealer is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sebastian-Stan/dp/B004U8VWLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sebastian Stan</a>, who surprises us all with an *electrifying* performance as the Winter Soldier. Stan is intense, dangerous, ruthless, and absolutely memorable. Marvel has always had problems with its villains. I think it's safe to say they struck home with the Winter Soldier.

2. ACTION: I think it's safe to say that Joe and Anthony Russo have crafted a film that contains some of the best action ever seen in a superhero film, rivaling anything you've seen before. Brutal, hard-hitting, grounded and real, you'll find no flying hammers or thrusters here; this is down and dirty hand-to-hand mayhem. Look for a brilliantly choreographed fight between MMA champion Georges St-Pierre and Chris Evans, and not one but TWO riveting, edge-of-your-seat car chases that will have you gripping whatever your fists can clutch, be it popcorn box or a nearby forearm.

3. THEMES: Carefully tempered with this action is an intelligent analysis of surveillance, government, and the importance of power. Pretty much fresh off of Thor 2's rock-em-sock-em big dumb fun, I don't think anyone was expecting a film this smart from the guys who made You, Me, and Dupree. I found myself thinking about the political symbolism of a shield - a defensive weapon, and the way it was used as an offensive weapon by Cap. I was probably over-thinking, but a few moments really stuck in my head, but heck, to mention them would be to spoil the film for you and I wouldn't want to do that. Suffice it to say that the political machinations and shadow games the Russo's are giving us is powerful indeed.

4. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, post-Avengers Marvel has been adhering very closely to their formula. This formula works, and we love watching it. But CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER broke this mould in half. It was smarter, grittier, more compelling, more riveting, more unpredictable, better acted, better characterized, and finally, better plotted than your average blockbuster film. I would argue that it is superior in fact, to The Avengers or any film Marvel Studios has put out yet. If this is where the future of Marvel is headed, sign me up immediately! An absolute MUST-SEE!

P.S. Should we talk cons? Can a metal shield really be used as a boomerang/bouncing ball/ hammer/ skateboard/ fall-stopper/ Frisbee? Anyways, if this review was helpful in your decision, please give it a like. Cheers!",1396828800,5,3966,6.503787878787879
5229336,5,B0090SI3EI,"No spoiler alerts in this review. This is my first time writing a review for a movie as far as I can remember. I really find reviewing movies to be completely subjective. Movies are like food and art in my opinion. Everyone has a taste and flavor something different. I felt compelled to write a review for this movie because, well in my opinion, it well exceeded my expectations for what this movie would deliver.

The first captain america movie was OK at best. It was more of a Monologue that began to build his character. The fight scenes/ action scenes kinda felt flat very one note. By contrast, the winter soldier tied in that first movie and gave it the depth it needed to make this a great film.

I have felt that Disney had really underpowered Captain America as a superhero. In this movie I feel like that gave him a significant boost in power that made him a more formidable superhero. The fight scenes were incredible in my opinion. Kudos to whoever was doing the stunts because they were incredible. It isn't unusual for the editor to speed up the fight scenes to make them more dramatic and if they did that in this movie it was nearly as noticeable as I had seen in other movies.

Captain America really steps up his game in this movie and you really see his leadership abilities as well. The dialogue between characters is well developed as well as the banter.

The villains were well developed as well.

The post credit scenes (yes there are two) are worth sitting around for and waiting. They give a nice prelude of what's to come. I want to write more but for the sake of not giving away any part of the movie I will refrain.",1396828800,3,1645,4.415841584158416
5229337,5,B0090SI3EI,"The over-saturation of Marvel superhero movies on Hollywood and movie theaters across the world continues with the second Captain America movie, The Winter Soldier. There is an over-saturation that many will take issue with me saying and many will agree, but in order to remain diplomatic I will admit that over-saturation can be forgiven when the script is good. I don't mind superhero movies, in fact, I love them; but I have had issues with the vanilla screenplays that have been present more often than not.

The original Captain America film, in my opinion, was one of those vanilla screenplays with a ultra weak villain and large chunks of film taken up with multiple montage sequences due to lazy storytelling and doing what many of the superhero movies are guilty of, setting up future films. They are all guilty of setting up future films, but some it seems it was their only purpose. Captain America: The Winter Soldier sets up future films as well, but I'm happy to say that I didn't see a single montage in the entire film and the script is one of the better of all of the Marvel movies.

There are some flashback scenes in Winter Soldier that remind us of events in the original film. The original was 3-years ago and so the reminders are welcome, but more importantly they serve importance because the films are connected. It is recommended that you watch the first film before seeing the new one, despite the fact that I found it disappointing for the most part. Thankfully, Winter Soldier makes viewing the first one worth while.

Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have maybe learned a lesson after writing the first Captain America because they also wrote Thor: The Dark World. Both Dark World and Winter Soldier are in my humble opinion, huge improvements upon the typical screenplay's we are getting with these movies. Finally, we are getting stories with some substance and movies that are not just superhero movies but great action movies and great science fiction movies.

Winter Soldier is a grand technological achievement because the best thing about it is that the creators have achieved a world where you feel as if the marvel world could exist. The action sequences are real and intense and the 'superness' of Captain America is nicely blended into the real world environments. The best part of Winter Soldier though, is that we actually get a feel of who Captain America is. Not just his powers, but who he is as a man and what makes him tick. That is the type thing that makes a good movie and a good screenplay, great.

Whether you like superhero movies are not, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not just that; it is a great action movie. It quite simply revitalizes my hope that the rest of Marvel's flood of movies won't be disappointing, just as I was about to lose interest. Marvel is finally putting all that money we've given them toward a better product and in wiser places; screenplays.",1396828800,7,2950,4.776470588235294
5229338,5,B0090SI3EI,"It's no secret that Marvel Studios has been killing it lately, releasing at least two huge comic book adaptations every year. In 2013 we had the box-office sensations that were ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"", which both made back their colossal budgets, and then some. And with the original Captain America having equal success back in the summer of 2011, Marvel was smart to get a sequel in the works. Starting off this movie-filled summer with a bang, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a pleasure to watch, and shows just what Marvel can do.

Picking up where the first film left off, we see Steve Rogers as he struggles to embrace his role in the 21st century, and as he battles various threats alongside Shield. With a new villain called The Winter Soldier wreaking havoc, his world begins to crumble, and he doesn't know who to trust. Forced to team up with his only allies, Black Widow and Nick Fury, he works to find the source of the threat that could quickly endanger America.

Action-packed and full of priceless comedic moments, this is a blast to see on the big screen. With plenty of fantastic acting, mostly from the three leads, it may be one of the strongest Marvel movies out there. Rated PG-13 for action sequences, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is more than fun, it's great.",1396828800,,1317,4.672413793103448
5229339,5,B0090SI3EI,"I'll be honest with you, I wasn't all that excited for this movie when I saw the first trailer. The first Captain America was a dud, my vote for the worst Marvel movie leading up to The Avengers. In the second wave we've been treated to a God awful Iron Man 3, one of my picks for worst movies of 2013, and a Thor that, while pretty cool, didn't wow me in the same way as some of Marvel's better films did. The Winter Soldier looked to me like just another obligatory movie they had to do to set up The Avengers 2. Cool? Maybe, but ultimately something people are going to forget in a year or so. Well, as Thorin Oakenshield would say, I have never been so wrong.

Set a short time after The Avengers, Captain America finds himself working for Nick Fury and Shield, though he's conflicted about the organizations goals and tactics and finds himself butting heads with them as much as working with them. The Captain sees Shield as playing to people's fears and taking advantage of that instead of protecting people's freedom, and he seems to have a point. Shield plans to launch three new Helo Carriers with the ability to take out any human being in the planet easily, efficiently, and without putting any lives in danger to do so. Sound familiar? Captain America, being the boyscout that he is, disproves, but being the solider that he is doesn't know quite what to do about it. That all changes when The Winter Soldier, a super assassin on a vendetta against Shield, shows up and starts wreaking havoc. But who is this Winter Soldier, who does he work for, and what is their plan?

I guess the thing I love most about this movie is the way it morphs a standard super hero flick with a healthy touch of James Bond. This isn't your everyday gun ho action flick like we're used to from Marvel, and it's also a far cry from the dreary, brooding recent DC adaptions we've had. Cap's punches a lot of guys in the face, sure, sure, but deep down in this movies heart it's a spy flick through and through with a healthy dose of super humans and high tech weaponry. And you know what? I approve. Captain America fits perfectly in a movie like this and gets incredible support from Black Widow, The Falcon (not to be confused with Hawk Eye who, sadly, doesn't appear in this film) and Agent Robin Sparkles. Together with Nick Fury they make a hell of a team.

Along with having a great cast of hero's we're also treated to some great villains as well. Besides Loki Marvel villains... well, they're kind of lame. Let's be honest, who here cares about Red Mask, or Dark Eldar, or Human Torch clones? Forgettable, one shot, lame villains the lot of them. Though The Winter Soldier himself was, I will admit, a bit of a disappointment once the mystery about him was stripped away, he's not the only one Cap's and company has to deal with. I'm not going to spoil anything for you but I will say the villains, and the threat they pose, are the best in the Marvel universe besides Loki himself.

Marvel has made some incredible movies. Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and especially The Avengers were all fantastic films. Captain America: The Winter Soldier deserves to stand among these as one of their best. The action is just incredible, the characters and villains memorable, and it breathes life into the Captain America franchise. If you are a super hero fan, you owe it to yourself to see this film. You will not be disappointed.",1396742400,5,3420,4.484751203852327
5229340,3,B0090SI3EI,"I struggle with Captain America movies because back in the 70s, his was my favorite comic. Many people are purists in this situation but I am not hidebound with it. I really believe the better the Marvel movie, the closer it follows the comic. Storyboarding right from the pages would be so good. This movie and the first as well pretty much got the pureness of Steve Rogers spirit and while I wasn't thrilled when I heard he was cast for the first movie, Chris Evan's performances have made me a believer. The cast is right, the budget is right and the quality of the effects are right. I saw the movie last night and left the theater disappointed. Cap is physically stronger, faster and more durable than he is portrayed in these movies. He is more acrobatic and he does much more with his shield than he has done so far in the movies. The story doesn't really ring a bell which always annoys me about many marvel movies. There is a lifetime of stories and histories to pull from yet they insist on rewriting so much. If I knew nothing about the comic, I'd be a lot happier with the movies but as it is, the movie was not remarkable. I wish I had saved my money and waited for it on Prime.",1396742400,3,1191,4.297777777777778
5229341,4,B0090SI3EI,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

In this terrific sequel to the 2011 ""The First Avenger,"" the excellent Chris Evans returns as Steve Rogers/Captain America.  He has clearly captured this superhero character and has made the transition from the 1940's.  He's still a red, white and blue patriot and that is a driving force in this episode.  The story revolves around an issue that is being debated today.  That is, how much personal freedom do we give up in the search for security?

S.H.I.E.L.D. has been compromised by those that believe the world would be safer and better off with a few million less humans.  And those are targeted by a computer that has predicted their worthiness based on their personal histories.  Remember ""Minority Report?""  Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is front and center in his biggest role yet.  He's the target for assassination because he suspects something is awry.  Cap is having second thoughts about why the SHIELD organization even exists.  A closer relationship with Natasha/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a new one with newcomer Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) convinces Cap he must find out what's going on.

Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and screenwriter Christopher Markus provide some welcome depth to the story.  All superheroes must have a physical enemy to deal with and The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) provides that presence.  Clearly TWS is a hybrid similar to Captain America, complete with a mechanical arm.  He's fast, strong and smart.  There are other similarities as well that I won't go into.  Robert Redford adds some storyline credibility as Fury's boss.  Emily VanCamp, fresh from TV's ""Revenge"" plays Kate/Agent 13, a SHIELD agent and potential love interest for Steve/Cap.  Also watch for Toby Jones as computer genius Arnim Zola.  Stan Lee can be spotted as well early in the final act.

This Captain America is slightly better than the fine original.  It is loaded with CGI, cool effects including some flying sequences.  And of course, the final scenes are filled with plenty of gun fire (large and extra-large calibers), hand to hand combat, crashes, and general destruction.  The film runs 136 minutes, but went by pretty quickly.  There are two secret scenes.  One nice, fairly lengthy one shows up after the cast credits and the other is too brief and shows up at the very end of the credits.",1396742400,3,2391,5.030612244897959
5229342,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not only a great sequel but perhaps the best standalone Marvel Studios film to date.  Trust me, I don't say that lightly.  I wasn't overly fond of the Captain's first feature, and my reaction to most of the Marvel Studios films has been mixed.  With that in mind, coming out of the theater I have to say 'The Winter Soldier' isn't only a great superhero movie, a great standalone Marvel Studios film, but that Captain America: The Winter Soldier may even be better than The Avengers!

At the start of the film Steve Rogers (AKA Captain America) is still acclimating to modern life after having been frozen since WWII, and is working under the orders of Nick Fury and SHIELD.  Already having doubts about SHIELD's motives and methods Rogers suddenly finds himself at the center of a conflict festering at the heart of SHIELD and must fight alongside other agents to stop a villainous plot to establish a new world order.  Along the way he'll have to face a dark figure which may be connected to his past and decide what freedom truly stands for.

The Winter Soldier is arguably the smartest Marvel Studios film to date.  While still providing the fantastical set-pieces, humor, and over the top action spectacles one would expect from a Marvel film The Winter Soldier's antagonist is grounded in real-world fears, and possibilities.  For this reason I felt more invested in the film's action than any other Marvel film to date.  While movies like The Avengers and the first Iron Man were fun superhero romps The Winter Soldier actually feels like it is addressing real-world concerns regarding government secrecy and drone warfare in a way which made me feel invested in the characters, and the stakes they were up against.  The decision to make it an internal, spy-movie type struggle also quelled any questions like ""Where the rest of The Avengers?!""  While that constantly bothered me in Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 I never asked that during The Winter Soldier because the nature of the villain makes it believable that most of the film's events are covered up and kept from the other heroes' knowledge.

Then there's Rogers himself who truly defines himself as a superhero in this film.  In his first outing and The Avengers Captain America always seemed like a wet blanket, coming across as a giant flag draped Boy Scout.  While he was likable enough he never warranted in-depth analysis.  That all changes in The Winter Soldier.  Here Rogers' reflects on his past, question his own values and whether or not he can uphold them in this cloak and dagger modern world.  He is a fish out of water and he knows it.  His commitment to remain true to the values that carried him through WWII becomes his character's greatest strength rather than holding his character back. Through clever writing, and tender character moments The Winter Soldier transformed Steve Rogers into quite possibly my favorite character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (sorry Tony Stark).

What ultimately sets the Captain's new adventure apart from other Marvel Studios films is that The Winter Soldier is the first standalone Marvel movie since the original Iron Man I've felt actually stood proud on its own two feet.  It features everything we know and love about this universe without feeling burdened by references other Marvel Studios films.  While Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World had me saying ""Can't wait to see the next Avengers"" The Winter Soldier had me leaving the theater saying: ""I can't wait to see the next /Captain America/ movie!""

For this reason I am giving my full recommendation for Captain America: The Winter Soldier",1396742400,705,3653,4.856451612903226
5229343,5,B0090SI3EI,"FULL DISCLOSURE: When I went to the movie theatre this weekend, I had very low expectations of this film for the following reasons:

a) Captain America was very low on my list of favorite comic book heroes;
b) The original film, Captain America: the First Avenger, was not particularly compelling or memorable;
c) There are so many other Marvel films ( such as Spiderman 2,  X-Men: Days of Future Past and Guardians of the Galaxy) that I was more interested in seeing.

But, Captain America: Winter Soldier blew me away! It was phenomenal! Let me give you a few reasons why:

1) IT'S ACTION- PACKED: The Winter Soldier has a few quiet moments but, for the most part, it flows from one action sequence to the next. These action sequences are brilliantly executed, riveting and are perfectly aligned with the film's storyline. There are no repetitive scenes in this film, either. There are three hand-to-hand combat scenes that are as good as anything we've seen in the Bourne Identity and new (Daniel Craig) James Bond films. There is a car chase that rivals the best aspects of the Fast and the Furious. And all of these scenes have a real sense of grace to them.

2) EXCELLENT ACTING & STORYTELLING: The people who put this film together obviously spent a lot of time thinking about moving its primary characters Captain America, Black Widow and Nick Fury beyond their prior stereotypical roles as the super soldier, femme fatale and the tough-talking head of SHIELD (the counter-terrorist organization) respectively. Some of Chris Evan's scenes as Captain America are among the most touching that we've seen in a superhero film. Furthermore, the teasing and somewhat flirtatious chemistry between Evans and Scarlett Johanson (Black Widow) is sublime. Anthony Mackie as the Falcon is a welcome addition to the team. He plays another veteran who, like Captain America, is trying to find his place in the civilian world after several tours of duty. Finally, Robert Redford nails it as a politically -adept bureaucrat who is attempting to balance the divide between his counterparts on the United Nations Security Council and an increasingly skeptical Nick Fury, whom the international community is beginning to view as a reckless and paranoid warmonger. Redford's role in this film harkens back to his 1970s star turns in spy films like ""Three Days of the Condor.""

3) IT INCREASES THE CAPTAIN'S RELEVANCE: I loved the Avengers! However, I think most viewers would agree that some characters shined in the film much more than others. In my opinion, the Avengers belonged to Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man, Mark Ruffalo's understated and somewhat soulful turn as the Hulk and the villian, Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Many of the other characters (like Captain America and Hawkeye), while cool to watch, were somewhat lost in the shuffle. In the comic books, Captain America is the battle-tested leader of the Avengers. In the Winter Soldier, we get to see why he is trusted with the leadership mantle.

FINAL ANALYSIS - Go see this film immediately. Like X-Men: First Class which was released in the early spring a few years ago, this movie is an unexpectedly intense thriller. (Grade - Solid ""A."")",1396742400,5,3189,4.96067415730337
5229344,5,B0090SI3EI,Very action packed and extremely political. It touches base on everything that has been happening in the US and the New World Order. I can't wait until the next Avenger film.,1396742400,2,174,4.645161290322581
5229345,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an absolute blast and fans young and old will be delighted with how well it establishes Captain America as the hero we've always known him as. It is in my opinion the finest movie Marvel Studios has ever made(Iron Man being a very very close second), and also the darkest, and i mean dark. This is NOT the family friendly action film that the first Avengers and Iron Man movies were, more people die in this film than all the Rambo films combined, even the comedy people have become accustomed to seeing in a Marvel movie takes a backseat in this Espionage action flick. I applaud Marvel Studios for not compromising Captain America and the Winter Soldier's characters to give this movie a more family friendly feel. This was such a massive improvement from the first Cap movie whose focus was more about being the catalyst for The Avengers film than as a fully fleshed out Cap film. From the acting, to the action/special effects, and the story, this is everything that a Captain America movie should be, even the Apple customer service guy was awesome, and just try to keep your eyes from watering up when Cap visits an old friend from the past. Here we're shown the life of a man who is living a mentally and physically punishing existence, still trying to get a better understanding of the decade he's living in, all the while shouldering the responsibility of being a figurehead and an essential member of a global organization. From start to Finish the tension remains high as Cap and the others put their lives on the line to stop Hydra, and blood will be shed. This movie has raised the bar to a whole new level for Marvel and i can only hope we get another one like this, not only is this an excellent standalone film, but it also perfectly sets the stage for an even more interesting Avengers 2. So check this movie out and see the most bad-ass 95-year-old the world has ever known, Cap's orders.

Chris Evans, Samuel Jackson, Scarlett Johannsson, Robert Redford, and Anthony Mackie star in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.",1396656000,2,440,5.285714285714286
5229347,5,B0090SI3EI,"Captain America The Winter soldier is by far the best movie in the marvel cinematic universe, at least in my opinion, which is a highly educated one. I absolutely hated the first Captain America, i love the character of Cap, but the origin story is to dull and boring to make for good entertainment, at least in my eyes.

But behold the winter soldier, a true masterpiece of entertainment, that has good characters, functional plot, and intense action scenes.

I am not going to spool anything about the plot, but one thing i really liked, was Steve's internal struggle. He is trying to adapt to a new world, one in which is very dangerous and hectic. So he joins shield, to protect people, but director Nick Fury wants to go a little further than just ""protecting people"" Shield plans to launch project insight, which would protect people alright. . . But at the cost of a lot of freedom. This of course doesn't fly with Cap.

Marvel actually made Captain America, an almost god like perfect human being, into a relate able person who struggles internally through out this movie, and that is fantastic.

They also expanded on the character of black widow. She was kinda just. . . there, in the Avengers and Iron man 2. Here she has an actual purpose in the plot.

Nick Fury was also expanded upon as well, and they take the character places i didn't expect, and it was awesome!

Simon Riley AKA Falcon, is an absolute beast! He was developed as a character and acts as a really cool side character in this film. And this was one of the things i liked, we get to see Cap interacting with people and relating. He relates to Simon Riley because he lost a friend in combat, and you see an immediate connection between the two characters.

The Winter Soldier was used extremely well in this movie. Instead of having him the main focus of the plot, he is a brooding and menacing presence in the background, the threat of him is looming in the air, and it gives the movie a great intensity factor.

This is easily the most intense and violent of the marvel films in the cinematic universe, and also a lot more serious than the other ones including its phase 2 counter parts Iron man 3 and Thor 2: The Dark world. It also has a much more complex plot than the other two, which only helps.

Conclusion.

Captain America the winter soldier is a much more mature, and serious movie than the rest of the marvel films in the cinematic universe. It is deeper, more intense, and more moving than the rest. Certainly this will go down as one of the great super hero films in history, as well as a fantastic film on its own.",1396656000,5,2608,4.448637316561845
5229348,5,B0090SI3EI,"It's a darker film than I normally prefer, certainly darker than Captain America: The First Avenger, and it's more political thriller than superhero action movie. But it's still a Marvel movie. The characterization is impressive and the humor is still there. The relationship between Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) has grown in the two years since they first worked together as part of SHIELD's Avengers Initiative. They're comfortable with each other, evidenced in the film's opening, when Romanoff finds Rogers and new friend Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) on a Washington DC street and asks how to get to the Smithsonian. ""I'm picking up a fossil,"" she says, a reference to Rogers' age (95, as he was born in 1918!).

At first, Rogers is finding it difficult to trust SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Fury raised suspicions in The Avengers when Rogers, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) discovered Fury had neglected to tell them SHIELD was developing weapons of mass destruction. Now, Rogers finds that Romanoff has been ordered by Fury to take data from the hard drive aboard a ship on which SHIELD hostages were held. He confronts Fury...but soon finds Fury himself is targeted by other SHIELD operatives and is on the run.

As Rogers, Romanoff and Wilson search for the truth, they find SHIELD has been taken over by an organization Rogers believed he'd neutralized back in 1944. The leader of the World Council (Robert Redford)...a corrupt politician (Garry Shandling)...SHIELD operatives...their tentacles of power are everywhere. The trio no longer knows who can and can't be trusted. ""How do we tell the good guys from the bad guys?"" Wilson asks.

""If they're shooting at us, they're bad,"" Rogers tells him.

Then he discovers it's really not that simple.

The enemy has a secret weapon. ""He's called the Winter Soldier,"" Romanoff tells him, recalling her own encounter with the super-assassin, years ago, and the scars it left on her. He's a super soldier like Rogers, with a metal arm designed to do serious damage. The difference? When he's not needed, he's kept in cryostasis. No real life, nothing beyond carrying out the orders of his masters.

Rogers faces off with the Winter Soldier...and discovers the assassin is his best friend, James Buchanan ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the man Rogers has considered a brother since their youth in Brooklyn.  Rogers recalls Barnes' role in the Howling Commandos, heroes of World War II, and his tragic fall into a ravine from a moving train while they were attempting to capture Dr. Arnim Zola (Toby Jones), a scientist working with Hydra, a Nazi-offshoot. He's stunned that Barnes is alive--but doesn't remember him or anything of his past life.

Will the conspiracy be exposed before it's too late? Will Barnes regain his memory before he and Rogers find themselves in a fight to the death? Will Stan Lee make his usual cameo appearance?  My recommendation: see the movie and find out!",1396656000,2,3077,5.113545816733068
5229349,5,B0090SI3EI,"""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" is an outstanding movie full of surprises, not least its willingness to shake up the viewer's faith in SHIELD. It's a thrill ride all the way to the credits (and make sure you stay all the way through).

Post ""Avengers"", Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is working for SHIELD as a strike team leader, and trying to fit into a world he can't quite get used to. A hostage rescue mission in the Indian Ocean leaves some troubling questions in its wake. Rogers and fellow strike teamer Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are about to discover that everything they thought they knew about SHIELD might not be true...

Captain American and the Black Widow will find themselves up against a frightening conspiracy, one that resurrects a few ghosts from Steve Rogers' past. Uncertain whom to trust, they recruit former paratrooper and VA counselor Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), while a couple of old friends will find them. The interaction between Rogers and Romanoff is fun, featuring two people with trust issues. Anthony Mackie is a good addition to the cast as the flying Falcon. Samuel L Jackson inhabits Nick Fury as if born to the role. Cobie Smulders is back as Agent Maria Hill, and Emily VanCamp has a short but promising turn as Agent Sharon Carter. Hayley Atwell has a nice cameo as Rogers' old flame Peggy Carter. Highly recommended to fans of the current crop of Marvel superhero movies.",1396656000,,1451,4.942622950819672
5229350,4,B0090SI3EI,"Nine Things about the Movie ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (USA, 2014)

1. I didn't really like the first Captain America movie. I thought he was a goofy, generic, and one-dimensional character. But they fixed that in this movie. This movie is much grittier, and Captain America has some good character development, as he is forced to grapple with modern political realities, where it's not so easy to figure out what being a ""good guy"" means (in a nice symbolic touch, his cheesy American-flag uniform in the first movie has been replaced by a darker uniform with a lot more shades of gray).

2. The movie is surprisingly complicated for a superhero movie - it's a conspiracy thriller that kind of feels like the old 1970's political/conspiracy classics. Casting Robert Redford in the movie helped with that.

3. As the Marvel universe expands and overlaps each other in various movies, it gets harder to keep up with what's going on. In order to really understand everything in this superhero mythology, you need to make sure you've seen not only the first Captain America movie, but also ""The Avengers"".

4. Scarlett Johansson is one of the best parts of the movie, as she continues her Black Widow character from ""The Avengers"".

5. The action scenes are well done. Some are also pretty unique. This movie ranks fairly high on the kick-ass scale.

6. For some reason, it's refreshing to see a superhero that doesn't always need to hide his identity. Captain America is Captain America whether he's in uniform or not, which gives him more flexibility to handle situations.

7. His shield is kind of cool to watch, but it's still stupid, though. And it completely defies the laws of physics.

8. The final confrontation between Captain America and The Winter Soldier was a little too melodramatic for me. And it features one of those cheesy, played-out ""countdown clock"" sequences. So I think it kind of wasted part of what it had built up along the way.

9. While this isn't the best superhero movie ever made, it is in the top half. It's relatively smart, with characters that are starting to feel more real. It's fun to watch, and is a nice addition to the Marvel mythology.",1396656000,4,2186,4.777188328912467
5229351,5,B0090SI3EI,"What a rowing rollercoaster of a ride. This is a MUST-SEE, not just for Marvel Fans but for everyone who loves a good action movie.  Twice as much action as The Avengers, and three times the Entertainment Value.  I'm not saying anything else about it.  Just go see it!  Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier",1396569600,,307,4.527272727272727
5229352,5,B0090SI3EI,"I won't go into much of a review, I don't think I can top the ones posted before me, however I will say the positive reviews are right on, this is a cool movie, plenty of action in this one, & Scarlett Johansson is always easy on the eyes as is Cobie Smulders, you will not be disappointed!!",1396569600,2,291,4.0344827586206895
5229353,5,B0090SI3EI,"No spoilers, I wouldn't jack you up like that.

When I was a kid I avidly watched those Captain America cartoons from the 1960s. Those suckers barely passed muster as animated fare, essentially composed of photocopied images lifted directly from the comics and tweaked into minimum motion to meet the bare bones criteria of animation. The only things that moved were the characters' lips (when they spoke) and the occasional limb or two. I don't know if you're old school like me, but can you imagine my sense of gratification at how technology has advanced to such a stage that, today, we get something like Captain America: The Winter Soldier? But do any of you remember the theme song from the 1966 Cap cartoon?

""When Captain America throws his mighty shield,
all those who chose to oppose his shield must yield.""

With all that said, it'd be twenty kinds of messed up if now I started crapping on the movie, right? I won't do that. I love this sequel, but I think I may have bought too much into the early buzz surrounding this movie. I rate this 5 out of 5 stars, but The Avengers is better, The Dark Knight is better. And, really, that's not too damning a slam. The Marvel suits were smart to go with an approach that showcased hot button themes and real-world elements, or as real-world as the Marvel cinematic universe allows it to be. Where do you go after the hi-tech bombast of Iron Man 3 and the otherworldly scope of Thor: The Dark World? And, by the way, I love Marvel's habit of choosing directors that are out-of-left-field. James Gunn for Guardians of the Galaxy, Shane Black for Iron Man 3, and now Anthony and Joe Russo for the Cap sequel.

The Russos have opted to channel the gritty 1970s-type political thriller, and I think this tonal shift is inspired and it works. It resets the paradigm. And it plants Captain America right where he can be the most interesting. Making Cap interesting is an ongoing chore because he's such a bland, noble dude it's hard to enmesh him in ""sexy"" conflict (it's the same issue with Superman). But, here, the Russos pit Steve Rogers' greatest generation values against modern-day paranoia and contemporary cynicism, and this wide rift in ideology makes for an arresting study. By the way, it's gotten to that stage now where, for me, Chris Evans, mustering equal bits of idealism and melancholia, has become indistinguishable from Captain America. Welcome to typecasting hell, Chris Evans. It's awesome to see Cap questioning authority, taking it to the Man.

It's an awesome cast that's given real direction and strong character beats. This is the Black Widow movie you'd been waiting for. Turns out, Joss Whedon isn't the only one on Marvel's payroll who knows how to develop compelling female characters. Even old Nick Fury plays a more prominent role. Samuel Jackson actually gets chances to act instead of just breaking out his badass Samuel Jackson routine. This time, Nick Fury is more than just a figurehead. He does stuff. Stuff happens to him.

I love, love, love that Robert Redford agreed to do this film. His presence alone lends such weight and authority and instant legitimacy, and, of course, he's another link to those 1970s political/espionage thrillers. It's a testament to the man's acting chops that he conveys so much just by lounging around in that executive room and seeming not to do very much. So, yeah, Redford does so much more for this film, but, if nothing else, he has one line that cracked me up the most (""Did you get my flowers?"").

So many more side characters of note. I'll just touch on three more. Yes, we do get an Agent 13 sighting, but she's pretty much relegated to glorified cameo status. The tortured Winter Soldier, for someone who gets tapped for secondary film title honors, isn't as much in the movie as you'd expect. But he's very effective when he's onscreen and I would lump him in that category of super-villains who are so badass and seemingly unstoppable that you actually grow alarmed for the good guys who get in his way. Going in, Anthony Mackie as the Falcon was a concern for me. But I should never have fretted. Mackie proves to be one of the best things. I relished the instant chemistry between his Sam Wilson and Steve Rogers - the lighthearted opening scene right away establishes their bond. I appreciate that Mackie isn't over-the-top, and that his character doesn't take a back seat. I like that Sam Wilson has a military background (he's an ex-paratrooper from the 58th Para Rescue squad); it makes more sense for Steve to strike up a friendship with him. The Falcon's high-flying scenes are exhilarating stuff. Those wings are wicked legit!

For a thematically darker movie, there's a welcome amount of funny. The best bits are, surprisingly, the exchanges between the Widow and Cap:

- Natasha Romanoff (rolling up in her ride): ""Hey, fellas, either one of you know where The Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil.""
- Steve Rogers: ""That's hilarious.""

Okay, so, mostly, it's the Widow who delivers the good lines. Cap isn't gonna light up the room with jokes.

Omigosh, the action! This is action with real-world grit. The striking fight choreography is staged so that you can feel the bone-crunching impact and the lethality of the moves. It really showcases Cap's indomitable fighting spirit. Lest you forgot, Cap is a damn super-soldier, a powerhouse when compared to us mere mortals. He's a straight-up beast at hand-to-hand combat, and the film recognizes this. His amazing early scrap with Batroc the Leaper (Georges St-Pierre) jacks up your adrenaline to overdrive. And I won't even go into Cap's several run-ins with the Winter Soldier, him what's whispered in the spook circle as a ghost story for the past fifty years. Also awesome is that Cap isn't frugal with bouncing his shield off people's domes. Get set for some crazy caroms.

In these times, it's hard to be an old-fashioned guy, hard to be that guy who's out of step. I'll say again that Chris Evans is so good as the man out of time, driven still with idealism but his eyes now wide open. This is a superior sequel. Absolutely, I reveled in the stunts and the f/x and the fighty fights. But, also, I savored the narrative's gritty underbelly, the topical real-world issues surrounding civil liberty, national security, and intelligence gathering, and the fleshing out of these four-color characters. Importantly, this is a character journey as much as it is a flight of fancy. It's also the best episode yet of The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. At the end of the day, the events in this movie will resonate thru the Marvel cinematic universe on a sweeping scale. We're made privy to some game-changing ish. And, as usual, stay for the stingers - one mid-credit, the other post-credit.

Some parting thoughts:

- There are plenty of old guys in the Marvel cinematic universe, and they're all played by Stan Lee
- Steve Rogers' arsenal consists of his shield, a Harley-Davidson Street 750, and, apparently, a key to the vending machine
- Love what it said on that tombstone
- Hey, what's that inside Redford's fridge?
- you should check out Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting's ten-year-old ""Winter Soldier"" arc on the Captain America comic book; it's strong storytelling

5229354,5,B0090SI3EI,"Let me start off by saying that this is a great movie, very exciting, action packed, with decent character development and good character interplay and propelling intrigue but a whopping entry in how it changes the Marvel cinematic universe and the future changes it portends.  It practically made me giddy for future Marvel movies.  And, let's just admit it now, Cap is the man!

But before I go on I wanted to admit that I had a hard time coming up with a title for this review as there are so many good choices like:

""An ensemble cast propels this exciting Marvel franchise entry.""
""Absolutely Captastic!""
""Stand up and salute 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'""
""Exciting action, smartly placed humor, and far reaching in scope the new Cap A is a must C!""
""You can't keep a good character dead.""
""A solid cast brings this gritty and bendy bit of intrigue into range for fans and casual viewers alike.""
""Steve Rogers: true blue.""
""Stand at attention for 'The Winter Soldier'""
""Bring back the Russo brothers to direct Cap 3 and they've got my ticket sale already!""
""The Winter Soldier will freeze you to your seat for a solid 2.5 hours.""
""Helicarrier, Helicarrier: is that a gun on your mounting or are you just (un)happy to see me?""

I could go on but I'll stop and finish my review with a few remarks (warning: minor spoilers ahead):

Everything you need to know about this movie is perhaps best summed up in a scene hinted at in the trailer where Steve Rogers is in a large elevator with about fifteen other men and presciently asks them, ""Before we get started, does anyone wish to leave?"" before giving them all a righteous beat down as they swarm over and attack him.  The build up to this scene is nicely handled putting the audience in Cap's boots wondering who he can trust, shows his canniness and awareness as he anticipates what's about to happen, but makes us smile and squirm a little as the film doesn't just launch us into an action moment but develops it so the payoff is extremely satisfying and leaves us smiling and waiting for more, more, more.  And this film delivers as I can think of many moments like that.

There are a ton of nods to important Cap storylines from the comics but the casual moviegoer, who won't catch these, won't lose much as most of what is introduced looks like it will be fleshed out in the future (good news Bucky Barnes/ Sebastion Stan fans!).  Amidst the espionage and intrigue we get healthy doses of Steve Rogers and the Black Widow whose means and methods are sharply contrasted even as they draw solid line distinctions between their beliefs and challenge each other to think about how and why they act as they do.  Are you worried or interested for these two to develop a romance in the flick?  I'll give you a hint at what happens between them romantically: they kiss!  Nick Fury is given his best action piece yet and it is truly exciting.  Sam Wilson (played by Anthony Mackie who is given some great quips) is introduced as the Falcon in both a believable and satisfying way, as is Sharon Carter/ Agent 13.  And Marvel continues to get good acting talent to fill roles.

What's sure to excite, aside from The Winter Soldier character being a solid Cap antagonist--ruthless and deadly--are those post credit scenes with one in particular setting up for the Avengers 2 and a couple of new character introductions.  And lest I forget this movie has a few things to say about politics and how man tries to enact and keep control.  It banks off of that question of would you kill Hitler before he was born if you knew what he was going to do...and would you be justified in doing so?

In many ways ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is the purest Marvel movie that's been put out yet and it's certainly one of, if not, the best standing up there with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers"".  The scale and scope is just as grand but the film feels intimate in tone.

P.S.  I WANT MY OWN CAPTAIN AMERICA MUSEUM!!!  How freaking cool would that be?!",1396569600,3,4000,4.555865921787709
5229355,5,B0090SI3EI,"I was curious how they would work the story of him being in modern times. I was amazed at how great it was and how they work in  the Falcon, which I thought added to the story, unlike some other reviewers thought. The action scenes were on the same level as those in The Avengers and better than any Post-Avengers Marvel film. They added more depth to some flat characters in this film that makes you like them better. The only thing I have to complain about is that they had way too many explosions in the movie, I like explosions but not in almost every scene.

I would rank this as the best Post-Avengers film, followed by Thor 2 and Iron 3 in that order.

P.S. There is a scene during the credits pertaining to Avengers: Age of Ultron that you will not want to miss.

To those who do not find this review helpful I know why that is. It is due to me placing this movie above the other two. You must remember though a review is a person 'personal opinion' on a product. Not everybody opinion will match yours so by disagreeing with me due to not agreeing with your view is selfish.

Highly recommended.",1396483200,4,374,4.514705882352941
5229357,5,B0090SI3EI,"Well, here we have the sequel I wasn't really looking forward to and wasn't especially interested in. I liked the first movie well enough, but the idea of another movie didn't interest me all that much. Im just not that into Captain America as a character.

But I must say, whatever expectations I had were shattered. This movie was excellent. It was nicely-paced and struck a good balance between humor and drama; something that isn't always easy to do. All the major characters worked well, even the Black Widow, who I normally just roll eyes at and quickly lose interest in. I will say that the titular Winter Soldier was a bit undeserved. He didn't really do much, other than look vaguely menacing and incredibly hot (note to self: watch for guys cosplaying as him when Comicon rolls around). I also like that Nick Fury was actually given a larger role, which is a nice change of pace from his normal habit of popping up, making a couple of quips and leaving again.

The movie itself did indeed live up to the notion, as its directors said it would, of feeling like a 1970s political thriller (complete with Robert Redford), with a bit of action thrown in; and the action was, for the most part, in service to the plot. Thats something fairly rare in many movies now (Im looking at you, Michael Bay). It was also nice to see some discussion about the ethics of SHIELD and the way they behave, though I wish it had been more than a surface discussion. I also really enjoyed seeing Captain America get a lot more characterization than he had in his previous two major appearances.

The one minor complaint that I have about the movie is that it was a bit crowded with main characters. We had Captain America, Falcon, Nick Fury and Black Widow, in addition to several different villains. I like a good ensemble cast, but there is a limit. Seeing the Winter Soldier get a bit more development would have been nice, too, but mostly I just spent time looking at him and thinking, Giggity! a lot.

As a final word on this movie, be aware that there are two credits teasers. One, that actually matters, happens in the middle of the credits. The other, which doesnt, really, happens at the end. Stay for both, unless you're at the theater I work at, in which case get out quickly! We have a mess to clean up.",1396483200,34,2303,4.502392344497608
5229358,4,B0090SI3EI,"Minor Spoilers ahead.  Cap 2 is an impressive rebound after the dud that was Thor 2 and in many ways provided a new standard for superhero films to strive for.  The action was incredibly impressive with the limitations of Steve Rogers' powers pushed beyond what many thought him capable of.  You'd think that there would only be so much that a strong man with a shield could do, but you're in for a surprise when you see this film.  The story consisted of a conspiracy that undermined the stability of Cap's world with many twists and turns that should delight fans, although I can't help but feel like they held back, that they could've gone further in many cases.

The humour in Marvel films of late has been hit and miss to say the least, and I'm happy to say that it's more hit than miss in this movie.  The Russo brothers have struck a nice balance between the tenser moments and levity.  The inclusion of S.H.I.E.L.D. and particularly Nick Fury and Black Widow was an effective decision, taking the sole focus away from Cap without letting you forget that he's the main character.  Some of the occurrences at the SHIELD headquarters are among the best scenes in the film.  The Winter Soldier himself was a threatening foil to our hero although considering that his name is in the title, he isn't present in the film for that long, nor is his story too prevalent, although saying that, for every scene he is in, Sebastian Stan emits a strong presence.  The apparent spoiler of his identity is ridiculous to anyone that has simply seen the first film and the direction of this does seem to be a bit muted, as if they're going to explore it more in the sequel, but I would've liked to have seen it taken further in this movie.

The climax was a little simplistic but provided a nice spectacle to behold.  Frank Grillo as Rumlow was very memorable as well as Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce and yet I feel that once again, the latter could've been so much more.  As well as some implications that weren't really explored, like the possibility that Fury was a bad guy, a traitor, and Black Widow a double agent, the story could've been much deeper.

It wasn't perfect; the camera couldn't keep still for the first 20 minutes and the blurriness made me feel ill. . Admittedly, the weakest aspect of Captain America: The Winter Soldier was easily The Falcon, he was shoehorned in without a good reason and as a result, he just seemed like the token black guy the entire time. Had he been set up as a government agent to keep an eye on Cap, as the ""nurse"" was, and maybe Cap made a quip about who else is an agent, the tramp in the street or something, that's all that was needed for us to be able to accept Falcon. Having him be some random guy that has wings for some weird reason highlighted how out of place he was in an otherwise relatively grounded experience.  When he fought Frank Grillo, I kept thinking 'he doesn't deserve to be here at this point in the film, he hasn't earned it'.

Oh well, I still enjoyed it a lot, and would put it 3rd in the MCU, behind Iron Man 3 and of course The Avengers.

A major death (or more) to up the stakes would've assured Cap 2's brilliance as well as having a final showdown without the typical large scale, big explosions we've become accustomed to. The stakes still could've been high, with the helicarriers in the air awaiting orders, but a clash in the SHIELD headquarters could've prevented Pierce from sending out the orders. This should've been a fight between the duo of Pierce (unmasked as the Red Skull) and Rumlow, the Winter Soldier (who fights Pierce as well as Cap and his group due to a failsafe), Cap, Falcon and Fury, with Black Widow against them all, having her own mission of getting helicarrier specs or something, as the Russians need to catch up with all of these American advancements. The anarchy of this division and violence, with the superpowered Cap, Skull and Winter Soldier further displaying their physical advantages over the non superpowered would have been highly refreshing and for me, preferred. But considering that the writers of Cap 2 wrote Thor 2, I guess we should just be happy that they didn't wholly disappoint this time around.",1396396800,,4220,4.546174142480211
5229359,5,B0090SI3EI,"I was expecting so much after Avengers but Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 were lacking something, good movies, but not as good as their previous ones. The Winter Soldier is everything you would expect and more.
The chemistry between Cap and Black Widow is perfect, they both different but they complement each other. The Winter Soldier is the villain we needed since Loki appeared in Thor.  Finally someone who is a threat and make you feel excited.
The best part is even when this is a Cap movie, the plot focuses on all the characters, Nick Fury, Falcon and of course, The Winter Soldier.

5229360,5,B0090SI3EI,"Marvel Comics produces such mindless PG-13 fun: Captain America is my favorite anachronism. Because of a military experiment in the 40s, he is mistakenly placed in a future time where he does not belong, so his earnest comprehension of that world is engaging and fun.

This time out, we enjoyed Large, Medium and Small visions of that world. For Large, we had humongous aircraft poised to start World War III; Medium offered truly astonishing vehicular mayhem and blowie uppie stuff; while Small brought endless fisticuffs and gun battles.

The parts I really liked were even smaller: the personal exchanges between our hero and his cohorts...AND his rousing, patriotic speech to the folks at S.H.I.E.L.D. Their new threat comes from old history, an awesome Soviet agent known as ""Winter Soldier.""

We watch:
  * Chris Evans (""The Nanny Diaries"") This is Evans' fifth time out as Steve Rogers/Captain America (the sixth is in production right now). This guy is earnest, sincere, patriotic, a born leader, and alone: the woman he loved is in her 90s, so you do the math.
  * Scarlett Johansson (""Don Jon"") Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow seems to be the only person left that our hero can trust...and she's a little iffy. (I first saw Evans as The Harvard Hottie in ""The Nanny Diaries"" wearing nothing but a hand towel and Johansson was the Nanny.)
  * Anthony Mackie (""The Fifth Estate"") Sam Wilson/Falcon seems to be a likely addition to The Avengers. He meets our hero during his morning run around the Tidal Basin.
  * Samuel L. Jackson (""RoboCop"") is our perpetual Nick Fury, the force behind S.H.I.E.L.D. It was hard for me to watch when his vehicle was targeted by the villainous Hydra forces.
  * Sebastian Stan (Lots of TV) is Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier, a fierce fellow with a bionic left arm; our hero thinks he knows him....
  * Robert Redford (""All is Lost"") Elder statesman Alexander Pierce is determined to win peace at any price.

Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeeley (""Pain and Gain"") bring us many intimate moments leavened with humor; there is only a hinted flirtation, and mild profanity. The loss of trust between our hero and Nick Fury is a problem. He says,""It's trust that turns men with guns into an army.""

Two things: Expect a LOT of Computer Generated Imaging and be sure to suspend disbelief! Our savvy screening audience stayed put for both of the teasers we have come to expect from Marvel during and after the final credits.

5229361,5,B0090SI3EI,"Marvel continues its winning run with ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". While the last movie was busy setting up the history and mythos of Steve Rogers, this movie places Captain right in the middle of the modern ""fog of war"" world. Rogers, along with Nick Fury and Black Widow, becomes entangled in a dangerous conspiracy in which he comes to question his mission, his allegiance and his place in the modern world. From the beginning the action never lets up, mixed with some humour and good character moments, especially between the idealistic Cap and the razor sharp and cynical Widow.
Marvel continues making a great job of translating its complex universe to the big screen, with inspired casting and excellent storytelling choices, in this case the inclusion of The Winter Soldier, a relatively recent addition to the Marvel canon, by acclaimed Cap writer Ed Brubaker. Classic characters such as the villainous Arnim Zola are introduced in a striking way, and there are shades of the classic Bob Harras ""Nick Fury vs. SHIELD"" mini series back from the Eighties.
Chris Evans couldn't be better as Steve Rogers, conveying the character's decency and stoicism, but also bringing a dry irony to the proceedings; Scarlett Johansonn makes a great case for a Black Widow solo film.
Marvel has made a great job of establishing specific worlds and moods for each of its characters in their individual efforts, and this is the case with Captain America, with a super powered mix of high action, patriotism, politics, espionage, secret organizations, and the legacy of the Second World War as well as the Cold War.
So, basically, it's great fun.",1396137600,13,1645,5.007299270072993
5229362,5,B0090SI3EI,"NON-SPOILER REVIEW (mostly) OF CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER!!!! BIG SMILES!  :)

OK, so saw Winter Soldier for the first time last night at an advance screening in Cleveland due to the fact about 60% of the film was made there.
So of course I won't spoil anything or give them away, everyone will see it for themselves soon enough.
And I will definitely be going back again and again since Cap is after all one of my two favorite male characters in the whole Marvel Universe...
I will says that this movie hits like a freight train and as far as action is on par with Man of Steel for sure but with a much better story and better character moments too. I can't imagine any Marvel fan or comic book fan that would be unhappy with it. The whole movie goes at a frantic pace and all of the main action sequences are done so fast it left me a little dizzy but then that's what would happen if you were in those situations in real life too and that's the main theme behind this movie. I think Marvel has upped the anty considerably in terms of realism in this. This is as Kevin Feige said a turning point in the MCU for certain! and although Cleveland is very easily and plainly visible all over this movie it only really slows down during the Terminal Tower mall scenes, the Captain America Museum and the Army Vet AA meeting scenes with the Falcon which are more dialogue based. Everything else is so fast whenever there is action you can barely even make out the main actors with all the jump cuts and quick angle shifts so I think most of the Extras in the Cleveland scenes are going to have a difficult if not impossible time trying to see themselves.
So many parts of Cleveland are used and substituted for Washington DC in this film, I'm starting to think that Cleveland is more like 65-70% of this movie. Locations included the Terminal Tower Mall, Lakeview Cemetery, the Motorway (winter Soldier attack sequence), The Art Museum lobby (SHIELD Headquarters), Euclid & East 9th Street and Superior Avenue both used for the Nick Fury car chase sequence and the hand to hand combat fight in the film between Cap and the Winter Soldier. An old Army base in Ravenna, Ohio was used for the abandoned Camp Leigh Hi from Cap 1. I was an Extra/Background actor in the bust shelter scene near the end of the SUV chase involving Sam Jackson (he's tall!) and it took us three days to film it over the Memorial Day Weekend in May 2013, it was cold, then hot, but always fun and cool being on set! The bridge and underground SHIELD base was adjacent to the Cemetery. The causeway bridge leading to the SHIELD base is Cleveland. Too many places to count really and Cleveland is all over this film just as it was in The Avengers.

With that being said, the two hour sixteen minute movie flies by enormously fast and at times it felt like I was almost watching a music video only without a band playing and with a good story. I think comparisons to the Bourne Identity/Supremacy/Legacy films is apt but Cap is even better and a bit dizzying to say the least. But that didn't bother me much at all.
Now, that doesn't mean it was incomprehensible. Far from it, all the acting and quiet scenes and scenes with dialogue were spot on. But the movie doesn't waste a second, there are no lost moments in this film, no body fat at all. This is a lean, mean machine, every bit as fit as Captain America is himself.
Speaking of Cap, Evans embodies the character perfectly. He carries that sense of right and wrong from WWII into the present just as he should, there are many many nods and connections to the first film including photos of friends from the past and discussions about them and even flashbacks. Yes, I will say one thing. Skinny Steve returns in a few scenes and they are great scenes for that pre-Cap Steve Rogers characters. And everyone knows that what makes Steve Rogers Captain America isn't really the serum but how great his heart is and his morals and that carries over from the first film perfectly and is at the center of this film as it should be.
There is a wonderful moment between Cap and a little boy in the Captain America museum in the middle of the movie and some nice scenes about trust or who not to trust between Cap and Nick Fury. This is every bit a government conspiracy movie just as much as those Bourne films are but Cap is a lot more fun to watch and there's a lot more humor too. Nothing that ruins the mood, this is not a comedy, this is DARK and so far as dark as it gets in the MCU too. Even darker than Thor: The Dark World in terms of intent and ideas go. I thought Thor 2 was great but it relied mostly on the chemistry between Thor and Loki - it was their show and I didn't get into the villains that much but with The Winter Soldier there are so many villains and surprises of who is who that like Cap himself you don't know who to trust and it seems like the only two people that he can really trust are Black Widow and Falcon and he's not 100% on Black Widow even because she always has a hidden agenda even from him. This movie is ALL about secrets and lies and cover-ups and how a man with honor and an extremely high moral standard who comes from a more B&W time is able to deal with being in a new world that is so grey. The posters on this should have all said, ""Who do you trust?""

The Black Widow comes off as Caps accomplice when they are dodging bad guys and has a bit of a thing for his quaint almost farm boy charm. Cap really is the closet thing to Superman in Marvel in terms of his character and patriotism and a certain innocence. She on the other hand is the jaded spy who has switched sides more than once, what they have n common besides being two out of six of the most skilled and dangerous or powerful people on the planet is that they are the only Avengers besides Hawkey who are used to taking orders and being part of a command structure... Well, not after THIS movie! The Winter Soldier when first introduced seems more like just another thug until we get to see his conflict with recognizing Rogers. By the end we find out that this movie is only the tip of the iceberg as far as The Winter Soldier is concerned and this movie feels much more like a piece of a much larger puzzle in the Marvel Cinematic Universe more than any other film. James Barnes is a much darker and complicated character than Steve is and has to be and is handled perfectly here I think. He is the dark Captain America - Cap fights for honor and to save lives, his identity as an individual and as an American is all important to him while The Winter Soldier is little more than a very efficient killing machine.... at first.

I'm not saying that the movie is incomplete by saying that this is the tip of the iceberg, the main story is wrapped up by the end yet the threads of each of the main characters are only beginning to unravel and unravel they do in huge way by the end of the film and this is just the very beginning of Cap's adventures in the modern world...
It's really too bad that Evans, like Downey Jr. is quitting after Avengers 3 when his contract is up.
That being said, we've seen Steve Rogers go from a weakling with a good heart into an amateur adventurer in The First Avenger and then in The Avengers he is a bit lost but has had enough experience to hold his own.
But in The Winter Soldier he has found his own and is the full-fledged super hero and war torn vet everyone recognizes from the comics easily. Chris Evans IS Captain America in this movie, The Cap from the comics and after this film he will always stand out as Steve Rogers - the hero we all know and the Living Legend and the expert leader and super hero strategist. Evans maybe not really like Rogers in real life at all and some here in Cleveland will tell you he's actually a big jerk who met him, I never did. I was only in the same room with him at the wrap party but onscreen he shines as great as his shield. The shield play in this movie is a Captain America fan's dream. He fights and uses the shield like an artist - that was the one complaint I had with Cap in both The First Avenger and The Avengers is that he used the shield quite a bit to defend himself in both movies but rarely used it as an offensive weapon. Here he masterfully does both and the shield is like another character in the film, not just an accessory. It's part of him, an extension, just as it should be.

Sam Wilson is a fully realized character and expert in his own right, The Falcon soars in this movie and is already my second favorite character in the MCU because of this film. Really wishing he was in A2 at this point and a bit sad that we won't see him again until Cap 3. I like him a lot better than Black Widow or Hawkeye as a super hero in these films even after Black Widow has been in now 3 films The Falcon flies a lot farther as both a hero and a characters and Anthony Mackie is cast perfectly as the war vet with wings. The same with Agent 13 Sharon Carter, she is exactly as she should be. It's a near perfect film in its pacing, very tightly put together and satisfying to watch from start to after the credits. Just as with Thor: The Dark World there are two tags at the end. One is in the middle of the credits and the other at the very end after the credits. One is a very definite lead into Avengers: Age of Ultron and reminded me a lot of the tag where Nick Fury recruits the scientist from Thor to work on the Tesseract. Same sort of idea but from the villains perspective with surprise guest characters.... The tag at the end of the credits has more to do with continuing the story of one of the main characters from this movie...
Robert Redford makes a surprising great villain and is just as masterful at Alexander Pierce as Hugo Weaving was as The Red Skull in First Avenger. Redford is the subtle puppet master who controls all the strings while The Winter Soldier is his iron fist and Frank Grillo an awesome guy in real life who I met at the wrap party is Redford's vicious trained dog in this movie! But I really hope to see him as full fledged Crossbones in the next movie complete with signature costume let's hope!
I will say that out of all the MCU films this definitely felt much more like a piece of a larger whole. The journey of the characters is incomplete and this feels like a middle movie in a trilogy for certain. This is more than anything the Empire Strikes Back of the Captain America franchise and nearly every bit as good.

This film very nearly felt like a comic book, where you just can't wait to pick up the next issue to see where the story goes next. Only unfortunately Captain America 3 doesn't come out until May 6th, 2016.
So we'll have to wait a lot longer than a month to find out what happens next in this story.
I have an idea that whatever the plotline of Avengers 2 it will just be a break from this continuing story for Cap and Black Widow and hopefully expand once again on their characters, BW should be a lot more confidant and controlled after this and not worried about her ""red ledger"" anymore. While Cap better be using his shield in Avengers just as well as here only he should show some remnants of stress and concern over the events in this film and the fate of Bucky Barns and Nick Fury but still have much more confidence as well in his own abilities as a leader and as a super hero. Then after the Age of Ultron is over it will be back to continuing this story again and wrapping up the Captain America trilogy for I hope one hell of a conclusion. Because so far between Cap 1 & 2 it looks like Cap is the leader of a continued story from 1st film to 2nd, much more than Thor or Iron Man have ever been between 2 Thor movies and 3 IM films. There is much more continuity here with the 1st Cap, the Avengers and the rest of the MCU.

So far each movie in the MCU has been pretty self contained with just small little connections and mentions of names or the introduction of a character to link them up. The tags did most of the work, but that all ends with The Winter Soldier because this movie more than any other seems much more connected to everything that has come before and what will come after and a lot of that has to do with what happens with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Some new character names set to be in Phase Three are happily name dropped, as are other characters from The Avengers who do not make an appearance but their presence is felt nonetheless.
All in all this is a hugely strong addition to the MCU and it has as much action in it as Man of Steel, and is just as dark in tone. This movie shakes up the MCU in many different ways and makes me wonder how it will affect the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. TV show as it rightly should because many things are tested in this movie and not the least being what happens with S.H.I.E.L.D. in this film as an organization.
There's just so much going on in this movie and its ramifications in the MCU will having people coming back to see it over and over again just to take it all in that's for sure.
There are a lot of references to the rest of the MCU as well as some sly and funny references to other movies as well like War Games and Pulp Fiction. There's so much going on and so much that happens it will have you salivating for Age of Ultron and Cap 3 but before any of that actually happens happily we still have Guardians of the Galaxy on the way and I am REALLY looking forward to that too... and I will do a review of that as well and hopefully see a screening for that, but even if I don't I'll be first in line when it hits theaters and be doing another non-spoiler review for that as well... Here's to next time!  :)
Can't wait for this Blu-ray release to add it to my MCU collection, I'm sure it will be fantastic and a perfect compliment to an already great film.",1395964800,2,13806,4.218608169440242
5229363,5,B0090SI3EI,"(I will do my best to make this as spoiler free as possible, sorry if most of the review sounds incredibly vague in the interest of maintaining the secrecy of some of the plot twists).  The advanced screening answered a lot of questions from fans on how Captain America's 2004-2005 story arc would be adapted to fit the Marvel cinematic universe, with the cosmic cube being stretched about as far as it can go during phase one.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier takes an alternate take on the Winter Soldier's role.  He's still a russian assassin but there's the sense that you don't truly know who he's working for.  Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury tells Captain America to not trust anyone, and the writers definitely wanted you to keep guessing at who is good and bad.  It's a genre-defying take on the superhero movie in that this feels more like a Mission: Impossible action-espionage movie set in the Marvel Universe.  The movie has spectacular action sequences both large scale and small (assault on the helicarriers vs Cap fighting agents in the elevator).  The humor is there as well and hits the ground running from the first scene (which also introduces Anthony Mackie's Falcon character).  Speaking of the Falcon, I was pleasantly surprised with his movie adaptation and can't wait to see him back in future installments.  The writers/director did a lot of fan service with subtle nods to the comic scattered all over if you pay close enough attention.  There are some setups as well that seem to be indicating how Avengers 2 will weave in the Ultron storyline.  Despite the rewrites from the comic books, the crew did a fantastic job at maintaining the integrity of the story (unlike Iron Man 3).  Characters driving the conflict may have changed, but they kept most of the major plot points and even squeezed some direct-from-the-pages material into it.  For instance, one of the most famous lines in the book's first Cap vs Winter Soldier battle drew the biggest crowd roar.  Even new characters introduced in this movie will have subtle parallels to comic characters that give the avid fans a little foreshadowing, making you feel ""in the know.""  Overall, this is hands down the best Marvel movie next to the Avengers and I can't wait for the rest of you to see it.

P.S. - the mid-credits stinger is worth the wait but feel free to leave before the post-credits stinger, it's a let down.",1395360000,4,2402,4.779661016949152
