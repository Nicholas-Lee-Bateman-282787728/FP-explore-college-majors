8319046,2,B001LNOMHM,"It is very rare indeed that I would rate any movie this low!!!  Please be aware the movie is great it is the product offered by "" Sinister Cinema"" that is HORRIBLE!!!  I saw this movie for the first time on the Net & it must have been a restored version because it was beautiful!  The story is awesome & set in a time period that is not showcased by many movies.  The version I saw on the Net should be used in Film School's to show how a really good movie can be elevated to a fine work of art by the use of vivid amazing color!!!  What I got from "" Sinister Cinema"" can barley be called a color movie as it is so bleached out it looks Black & White with hints of color the picture quality is very poor & zero efforts were made to restore this movie.  There is absolutely zero excuses for "" Sinister Cinema"" selling this terrible quality version of what is a great movie because I watched the beautifully restored version & it was a visual feast for the eye's!!!  As I said before the use of color separates this movie from its peers & truly makes it become a work of art.  It is company's like Sinister Cinema passing off garbage like this that makes me almost able to forgive pirates!!!  If you can find a restored version of this film it will make a great addition to your movie collection but please do not support "" Sinister Cinema"" by purchasing their version of this great movie.  I am not going through the hassle of trying to get a refund but I will never purchase anything from Sinister Cinema because what they are selling as "" Revak the Rebel"" is a Cinematic SIN!!!!  P.S.  Do not blame Amazon.com they cannot screen everything sold through their wonderful store ...this falls all on Sinister cinema!!!!!!!!!!  I would happily give "" Revak the Rebel"" 5 stars in the restored condition I watched it in.  As I said earlier there is a lack of movies dealing with this time period other than the silent film "" Cabiara"" & Victor Mature's film "" Hannibal"" , "" Revak the rebel"" is the only other one I am aware of.  It has Spartan mercenaries, a defeated Roman general & even a Indian boy trained as a Mahut  ( Elephant trainer) incase I spelled that wrong...all coming to the aid of a Celtic prince in a desperate fight for freedom !!!  That is quite a host of characters & all ones you might have run a crossed during the Punic Wars.",1496275200,,2341,4.260180995475113

8319048,2,B001LNOMHM,"I bought the Sinister Cinema DVD-R release of this film some years ago and was disappointed.  The film was OK, what I was able to see of it.  The DVD-R started glitching and would come to a standstill.  I would like to see a re-mastered, clear, pristine version released soon.",1379721600,,276,4.48
8319049,1,B001LNOMHM,I originally saw this film at the cinema back in the 1960's or early 70's.  Sadly though the DVD suffers from very poor reproduction quality.  The original film print must have deteriorated.,1375401600,,190,4.90625

  I received the movie in good condition and in atimely manner. The movie is good. It was a surprise to see a young jack palance in fine form.",1325894400,,152,4.172413793103448
8319052,3,B001LNOMHM,"""Revak the Rebel"" is a 1960 film about an Iberian prince from Penda (a small island) where Carthage took slaves after defeating them in war, and Jack Palance (the prince) eventually becomes so bitter and bent on revenge that he never allowed himself to see opportunities he had for love and comfort; instead sides with yet another army that attacks the Carthagians - this time Rome.  Starring Jack Palance, Milly Vitale, Deirdre Sullivan, Austin Willis, Guy Rolfe, Richard Wyler, Joseph Cuby, Melody O'Brien, and of course, etc.  Jack Palance seemed more at home when (1961 in Italy) he made ""The Mongols"" than this film (""Revak the Rebel""); further known as ""The Barbarians,"" ""Rivak the Barbarian,"" and foreign titles.
Jack Palance reduced from Iberian prince to elephant driving slave, his sister having taken her own life to avoid being defiled by her captors, he learns how to win allies among the slaves and a few of nobility so he can hope to turn the tables against those who conquered his people - and along the way he makes one of the beautiful Carthage women interested in him romantically.  Without Jack Palance's ability as an actor, this movie would never have been referred to in ""Schlock! The Secret History of American Movies"" as a newspaper article which calls this movie ""Revolt of the Barbarian.""  This DVD movie may be where the adage came from that says, ""The floggings will continue until morale improves.""
This is meant to be similar in theme to epic films such as ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" among others, however, even with the presence that Jack Palance delivers, ""Revak the Rebel"" isn't quite at such a caliber.  That said, the cinema version ""Revak the Rebel"" was shown in Denmark, Finland, West Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, France, and of course in the USA.",1320364800,3,1786,4.900662251655629
