8393788,5,B003BNCMUE,"An excellent rendition of Middle East history with the focus on World War 1 and the fall of the Ottoman Empire.  Its military history regarding primarily Britain, France, Germany, Russia and what was to become Turkey is beautifully interwoven with concurrent  political developments of the period.  The historical backdrop rendered dispels any mystery those less informed might entertain regarding the mess the Middle East has found itself in since World War 1.  Any criticism of this documentary as to its lack of detail regarding more contemporary developments in the Middle East might remember the documentary's title and thus, its intended focus. The criticism that the documentary doesn't place enough emphasis on oil and its influence on the events depicted is silly and not supported by a careful viewing of this fine documentary.",1408233600,,837,5.318181818181818
8393789,3,B003BNCMUE,"Didn't live up to its potential billing.  We all need to take this DVD seriously, though, if we are able to put it into a historical context.
Our ""allies"",  France and Britain, made huge mistakes around the time of WW1, even if at great sacrifice to themselves.  We are still dealing with the aftermath today.  However, the video gets bogged down in repetitious recitations of military campaigns, without putting any of it into a larger, relevant context until the very, very end.",1406851200,,480,4.817073170731708
8393790,4,B003BNCMUE,"The producers of this DVD did not accurately entitle the work inasmuch as there is a lot of blood but not much about oil and it is true that the viewer will not get much insight into the US intervention in Iraq and why that intervention sputtered so badly.  It is also true that the treatment of the Ottoman Empire and Turkey takes a Turkish slant in not even mentioning the Armenian genocide.  Except for the last 10-15 minutes, which presents a superficial summary of events in the Middle East after 1924, the documentary is worth watching notwithstanding limitations. The film footage is worth watching and the recouning of events in the various sub-theatres ot the WW! in the Middle East (Caucasus, Gallipoli, SInai, Mesopotamia, Hejaz) holds the viewers interest.",1387411200,,768,4.9
8393791,4,B003BNCMUE,This video is thorough and gives excellent Middle East background as far as recent history goes. It also depicts the shortcomings of human and political decisions in light of conflicting national interests. However I believe the roots of this particular conflict are deeply embedded in past millennia before the Western World began its consumption of oil.,1312848000,,355,5.357142857142857
