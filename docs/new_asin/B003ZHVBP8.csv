8410340,1,B003ZHVBP8,"I was really looking forward to using this DVD as part of my winter shape-up plan.  Unfortunately, my DVD player would not read it.
I have no difficulty playing any other DVD's.  It plays on my laptop but that wasn't how I planned to use it.  In short, I have thought about returning it but have been too busy with the holidays to do so.  I wish there had been some information regarding the viewing format.  I would have selected another product.",1388793600,,447,4.402439024390244
8410341,5,B003ZHVBP8,"I just love Louise Solomon, she is a great instructor.  I am enjoying all my DVD's.  I have 5 that I rotate so as not to become monotonous.  I started out with the Yoga & Pilates with the stretchy band.  I love this one but it was getting old, so I ordered more.  Haven't found one I don't like.
Just be careful when you order, make sure you get the American one, I ordered the UK and it wouldn't play on my DVD player.  I got it converted, but that was a lot of trouble.",1370563200,6,471,3.905263157894737
