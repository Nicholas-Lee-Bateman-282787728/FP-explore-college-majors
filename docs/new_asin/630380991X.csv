7853259,5,630380991X,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film but I always enjoy Richard Dean Anderson and Bernard Hughes :) There are a few places where the story drops off and leaves holes, but it has a good message for anyone trying to work through the loss of a child and a senior in their life. I would seriously recommend it and although it is somewhat bitter sweet it is far from depressing. I was amazed that I had never seen it before and will watch it again!",1389484800,,437,4.214285714285714
7853260,5,630380991X,"Richard Dean Anderson was once again at his best in this family style movie.  It was both emotive and encouraging, outlining the pain felt at the loss of a child and the range of emotions that go along with that, that must be dealt with.  The young Grayson Fricke was equally good in playing the role of the boy who was unable to speak but filled the void in the lives of the Parishes.  Bernard Hughes, well known from Sister Act II, and Doc Hollywood, completed the mix with his role.",1295913600,3,485,4.3076923076923075
7853261,4,630380991X,"I thought the movie was very good and touching.  Richard Dean Anderson did a wonderful job, as always.  The only problem I found with the story was that it didn't get detailed enough.  The character had a couple of major events happening in his life and they just skimmed over them.  The movie ends and you never find out how the big events turned out.  Good story, good acting, and worth watching, it just has a couple of holes.",1081900800,6,429,4.379746835443038
7853262,4,630380991X,Heart-gripping tale of a new beginning.  A must see movie for anyone who enjoys mystery and morality in a story.,1031702400,4,112,4.6
