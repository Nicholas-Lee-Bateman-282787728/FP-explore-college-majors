8162937,5,B000LP6KT4,"Great program with Jools Holland, British Musician. This is a 3 hour best of, from a British Series called Beat Route. I have several cds featuring Jools, usually backed by a large band and featuring prominent instrumentalists and singers. This series takes him on a tour, music, travel and culture of six major cities. Usually he travels in a large impressive convertible. In the segments he often plays piano with the musicians. I loved the segment in Cuba, with the young ballet performers, and a visit to a Cuban cigar factory. The visit to Dublin featured the chieftains and Van the Man. Chicago, blues scene featured Koko Taylor and Lonnie Brooks. Great scenery and music and very entertaining.",1432425600,,700,4.940677966101695
8162938,5,B000LP6KT4,"I loved the Beat Route TV series when it was on the Ovation channel several years ago and I was very happy to discover this DVD, especially that it incorporates all four of my favorite episodes - Beirut, Seville, Budapest and Havana.  If you love world music, you will not want to miss Jools Holland's unique tour of several different styles of music in each city.  He not only covers local traditional music, but also current trends in music in each location, and he brings a lot of local area familiarization into his presentation.  This is an excellent addition to my/anyone's world music DVD collection.",1352073600,,607,4.761904761904762
8162939,5,B000LP6KT4,Jools Holland does a great job exploring these cities and the music of the area bringing his own style of humor with him on the way.  I fully recommend this dvd - great job!!,1216944000,,174,4.117647058823529
8162940,4,B000LP6KT4,"This BBC series -- six half hours -- takes the Squeeze keyboard player on a musical tour around the world (well, a good portion of it anyway). Jools doesn't always seem entirely at ease in front of the camera, but that's okay: he knows all the hot spots to visit, and where the best cigars are made in Havana.  Many unexpected moments and his cheeky commentary give the shows a bit of an edgy feel. Each  episode is more like musical postcard than a complete travel guide, and you'll always stop at a pub for what Jools describes as a ""knees up""  good time and a pint or two. There's  great music, too: in Dublin,  Van Morrison and the Chieftains perform  ""Shandendoah"" as a heart-breaking Irish ballad, in Havana there's a  wonderful solo appearance by 79-year-old pianist, Ruben Gonzalez. There are gems in each episode.

The cities visited are Chicago, Dublin, Seville, Havana, Budapest, and Beirut. Some may be surprising choices, but all in keeping with the series' admirable goal of demonstrating music's universal appeal -- if not Jools's habit of bringing out a piano before each episode is over. He also finds some classic cars to tour in: be sure to check out that sporty, East German-built 1958 Wartburg convertible! He's obviously enjoying himself among all the pints of Guinness, Cuban cigars, and  gypsy dancing. Jools gets in some history lessons, too, and makes a lot of musical connections in each show.  It's an exciting, if brief, introduction to world music, and a lot of fun.",1194393600,4,1496,4.785992217898833
