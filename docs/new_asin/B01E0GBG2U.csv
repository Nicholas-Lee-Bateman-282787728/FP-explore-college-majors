8757489,2,B01E0GBG2U,"This not like any movie called a ""movie"" I have seen.
It's filmed super low budget but the actors try their best!
It's very boring & I've tried to stay awake three times watching it & I  get so drowsy except from this one.
It's three hours on DVD & I got it for only $6.00.

I'm a huge Dark Shadows fan of the old sixties era goth soap but this I just pop in if I feal I need to go to sleep.

The sets look super fake but with a dreamy quality.

Worth a shot.",1535500800,,459,3.7010309278350517
8757490,3,B01E0GBG2U,"2 & 1/2.  This has little to do with the Dr. Mabuse novel, or the three Fritz Lang movies.  Colorful nonsense that fails to produce a satisfactory ending.  A bit like watching ""Sin City"", if Sin City had been done in color, and without a plot, and without a budget.",1526169600,,265,4.26
8757491,5,B01E0GBG2U,"This is the two films put out in 2013 & 2014. Each is around 122 minutes. It is much like the old Dark Shadows T.V. series with moody music, cheesy props, and marvelous over acting. It features Jerry Lacy, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Lara Parker, and Christopher Pennock (only in Etipomar).

Special features include trailers, a 45 minute making of featurette of both films that was made in 2015. It appears to include additions to the one on the first Dr. Mabuse DVD. It does not include the deleted scenes.

The actors are mostly in front of green screens as these movies are on a shoe string budget and made by a brilliant 20 year old who appreciates the shows of yesteryear. The actors are brilliant and convey the deep feeling and intense drama that you love from the old Dark Shadows. I hope they make a few more, and get a bigger budget.",1513209600,,837,4.4640522875816995
8757492,4,B01E0GBG2U,"Not as good as I expected it to be, but not as bad either. A bit on the computer generate side, and cheap looking, but then I wasn't looking to see high art or drama. Over all though, I liked the acting, and give them an A for effort.",1494201600,,234,3.795918367346939
8757493,1,B01E0GBG2U,"Leave your memories of Lara Parker and other Dark Shadows cast members intact. Zero budget and the non DS cast members weren't great actors. Honestly, high school productions have better production values.",1491091200,3,205,5.4375
8757494,1,B01E0GBG2U,It was too artificial for me I did not like it at all,1471305600,3,53,3.1538461538461537
8757495,5,B01E0GBG2U,Very good movie I would recommend it to any one to purchase this movie Jerry Lacy was great in the movie he has done so many rolls in his career. Ansel Faraj was great as the director in this movie look forward to seeing more of the director work . Where can I see more of Ansel Faraj movies ?,1465084800,2,293,3.9
