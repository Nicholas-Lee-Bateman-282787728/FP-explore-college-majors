1983038,2,B0001A79BC,"honestly, i don't care about racist jokes. if they are done right they are funny.
unfortunately the majority of this dvd was just not that funny. the first episode was outrageously funny the way that south park is. then it goes steadily downhill, as its writers clearly didn't really have any good ideas beyond the premise of the show itself (as evidenced by the so-called 'music video' of the theme song thrown in about halfway through the dvd). by the time i got toward the end i couldn't wait for the stupid thing to be over.",1082419200,5,528,4.510416666666667
1983039,1,B0001A79BC,"The two main characters are Ms. Pam and Mr. Wong, respectively voiced by Pam Brady and Kyle McCulloch. Ms. Pam is a self-absorbed and sadistic single white female and Mr. Wong is her 85-year-old servant. The Mr. Wong character is vile, foul-mouthed, grotesque and all-around offensive. His living arrangements are no better than a jail cell; the bed he sleeps on is made of wooden slats arranged on cinder blocks and he uses two bricks to lay his head upon.
These people show no creativity beyond rehashing tired and lame racist jokes through the played-out medium of cartoons. The cartoon itself resembles shiny paper cutouts pasted onto popsicle sticks, moving back and forth.
The two main arguments used to deflect criticism of the show is that Asian Americans cannot take a joke or laugh at themselves and that the show is just an equal opportunity bigot, making fun of both whites and Asians. But these are paltry arguments and do not even address the main point of the criticisms. That is, this cartoon perpetuates white racist attitudes and actions toward anyone who is non-white. This is not anything to scoff at; we have history on our side. Mr. Wong is yet more proof of the mass media's complicity in keeping the racist flame alive.",1080604800,6,1243,4.813084112149533
1983040,5,B0001A79BC,"Mr wong is Funny, but be warned this style of humor is not for children or people who are easily offended. In the past this cartoon has caused a stir witht he aisian community for its ""racist tones"". I personally think that those who find it racist totaly miss the point as it really makes fun of racist views. You just have to be smart enough to read in between the lines. This should not be viewed by young kids though as they usually are impressionable. If you are comfortalbe with south park you will love Mr. Wong",1077840000,6,518,4.295918367346939
8008937,4,B0001A79BC,"Yes, it's so un-PC it's scary, but it's also quite funny. And seriously people, Mr. Wong has a million more redeeming qualities than that wonderful/terrible bitch-in-heels Miss Pam (she gets points for the no-gag reflex). If you like irreverent, crude, perverted comedy, this could be your show. However, some episodes seem like filler.",1422230400,,336,5.3584905660377355
8008938,2,B0001A79BC,"Mr. Wong is a series of Flash cartoons made for the internet. Mr. Wong himself is an 85-year old Asian fella. He's Miss Pam's servant, and ""came with the estate,"" as the opening song states. The episodes run in the 3-4 minute range, but with the warning, intro, closing theme, and recap/preview, I'm probably seeing 2 minutes of original, new material per episode (the packaging states the disc runs 80 minutes). Am I supposed to be offended by Mr. Wong's portrayal? The show was unfunny, politically incorrect or not, although I've gotta say I loved the song ""Hockey Monkey"" by The Zambonis. Had nothing to do with the episode, of course. Also, there was a documentary about a Canadian guy who built a suit of armor (again, nothing to do with anything), which I found more entertainment value in than the show.",1358985600,,811,4.71830985915493
8008939,1,B0001A79BC,"Mr. Wong is a brilliant show. Its main ""protagonist,"" Mr. Wong, is an amalgamation of just about every East-Asian stereotype ever conjured, whipped by a brunette WASP boss into wild circumstances. The show, with respect to the ingenuity of its creators, rides the race-express to Fame under the disguise of an assault on all races and things politically correct (PC), and convinces some viewers that the show is not all about stereotyping Asians. As if stereotyping every race forgives stereotyping one. The show's creators, Pam Brady and Kyle McCulloch, exploited a fissure in America's PC defenses, and that fissure belongs to Asian Americans. That the show is allowed to be released on DVD and sold in a major online vendor in 21st century America reveals the inequities of Asian American recognition, despite their invaluable contributions to our society. It also reveals America's ""appreciation"" for cultural diversity as contempt for political muscle, gilded by obsequious acceptance, and exemplified by public apathy to the show. Realizing that Asian Americans lack the lobbying power of African Americans, Brady and McCulloch devised a show humiliating Asians for shock money. Can you imagine a puffy-lipped, Jheri-curled black man in place of Mr. Wong on retail shelves? Knowing that most Americans fear doing so, the creators resorted to lampooning Asians for a shot at fame and a quick buck. That such a show can exist is itself a lampoon of American viewers as being uneducated, easily entertained, and more easily manipulated. Giving the creators your money amounts to an insult against yourself.",1263513600,4,1609,5.2890625
8008940,1,B0001A79BC,"this is essentially a racist piece of crap. i'm all for freedom of speech etc but you have to essentially draw the line somewhere. The jokes all hinge on poking fun at the chinaman character mr wong and has very little wit or substance unlike the simpsons or futurama. the producers must have been dropped on their heads when they were babies numerous times when they thought up this cringe, nausea-inducing piece of junk crap turd.... avoid at all cost.",1210118400,3,454,4.6875
8008941,4,B0001A79BC,"Ok, get over your politically correct self and get this DVD. Absolutely hilarious short episodes.",1208476800,2,97,5.533333333333333
8008942,5,B0001A79BC,"This hilarious satire is politically incorrect in the manner of South Park. Open-minded people of all races will enjoy it; prudes and up-tight types will say:  ""You ... you cheat me!""

Mr. Wong for president!",1155513600,3,208,4.914285714285715
8008943,5,B0001A79BC,"...you laugh out loud, just purchase this DVD. Mr. Wong is an 85 year old Chinese houseboy who worked for Bing Crosby for 37 years. When Bing dies, his estate is purchased by Miss Pam, a super wealthy socialite, who soon learns that she has also purchased the services of Mr. Wong. Simply put, it is in your face humor that is funnier than hell. Of course, there are Asian groups who dislike it as Wong is the stereotypical Oriental flim flam man - he has buck teeth, a heavy accent, and he loves to gamble, drink, and curse. If you like ""in your face"" type humor, and you don't worry that every word you say is going to offend someone, then this is the DVD for you.",1103241600,4,666,4.2109375
8008944,2,B0001A79BC,"I'd enjoy this if the stereotypes extended to other minority groups, as popular shows like ""King of the Hill"" and ""The Simpsons"" do, in equal judicious amounts.  In this DVD, the joke falls solely on ""The Chinaman"". No one else. This singling out is what makes everyone uncomfortable and the humor substandard. Rickles, Mason, and other ""Race Humorists"" disperse their venom in unbaised portions, and that is when everyone can laugh. I gave this DVD 2 stars for its beautifully rendered art and retro appeal. Everything else is like eating Matzos sans aqua! Chitterlings mit no Tabasco. Tasteless. Take that, honkey! Just Kidding.",1087171200,4,630,5.116504854368932
8008945,3,B0001A79BC,""" Mr. Wong is very funny, but it is definetly not for kids due to the profanity. I don't think that it is that much different from "" South Park"" with its' irreverant humour, though Asians will criticize it for having racist stereotypes. Please!! This politically correct garbage that the public has had rammed down their throats for years now is so infuriating and pathetic. Everyone is so afraid for even  saying something slightly provacative, that lots of films,music etc. get shuttled aside so that people are not 'offended'. Yes,yes, I know... we all have to live together and should respect one another,etc.,etc., but I think people should be honest enough with themselves to look and laugh at what their individual culture is perceived to be by others. Caucasian people are very funny in their habits, views,etc. So are Asian people. Perhaps their cultural upbringing is such that it is not considered good manners to poke fun at themselves. Some might say that they simply cannot take a joke. Whatever the reason is for the dislike of 'Mr. Wong' by various individuals, it is a very funny comedic diversion and I'm SURE you will laugh. If you like 'South Park', you will probably like 'Mr Wong'. The extras on the dvd were interesting and also amusing. The only thing I didn't like was that I thought the episode length was particularly short and should have been longer.",1084752000,4,1379,4.818565400843882
