7155587,5,B00X3DC6SK,"I love this movie! It is has so many elements. It is funny, dramatic,  touching, a little sad. I think the director, Christopher Nolen did an excellent job bringing all of the characters to life and making them totally relatable. It is definitely one to watch more than once.",1440547200,2,275,4.612244897959184
7155588,5,B00X3DC6SK,"Christopher Nolen never disappoints when it comes to making great films. This film focuses on relationships, true friendship, love and commitment. The character, Cleavon Von Burkett, a restaurateur has to make amends within 72 hours to all the women he has mistreated in the past. Some of the female characters were downright crazy hilarious, and selecting Harry Lennix, one of my favorite actors, to play the role of GOD was an excellent pick. And of course Cleavon's best friend, played by Brian Hooks, brought so much humor to the story. The scenery is stunning, and all of the actors did a top-notched job. As witty as the film is, there are two important serious and powerful messages: Whatever choices you make in your life, can come at a cost, and just having sex does not necessarily lead to a first-rate, long lasting relationship. I really enjoyed this film, which has an ending you will never see coming. Congratulations, Christopher Nolen on bringing yet another inspirational film.",1440288000,4,994,4.993975903614458

8714794,4,B00X3DC6SK,This is a very good family film. It's about a man who has mistreated women. He must obtain their forgiveness. Cynda Williams looks great. She is one of the many beautiful woman that Durrett has to ask for forgiveness. Men must never mistreat women. The film is funny but it also explores the importance of honesty and fidelity in relationships. Hooks is funny as usual. Recommended for fans of clean romantic comedies.,1461110400,,418,4.819444444444445
