I found it very informative for use in option pricing and duration ,Swing trading vs. day trading. Not your average seminar but a traders perspective on dealing with the daily gyrations of the market and the noise that can persuade you to enter a trade that is better left alone. If you like Yale Hirsch and the Traders Almanac I think you may enjoy this lecture.",1298851200,,478,4.7023809523809526
8361383,1,B002BHSG7E,"I purchased this DVD at well below the outrageous $99 price listed on the DVD, but if it is offered to you for free I would still recommend turning down the offer.  Many people rip the Trader's Library DVDs as being poor quality footage of presentations made by speakers at big investment conferences; while I can't argue completely with that assessment, I can usually find something worthwhile to take away from the videos.  In this case I could not.  I have not read any of Alan Farley's highly-rated books, but can only assume he does a far better job of presenting material than in this presentation.  He shows about 4 charts during the presentation (which are useless anyway).  The rest of the time is him speaking in front of an audience (mainly about cycles) yet managing to not say anything important.  The ONLY thing of use in this video is where he mentions using multiple time-frame charts, but he doesn't flesh this out at all- he merely shows a slide saying if you scalp, use 1-, 3- and 5-minute charts (or 1-, 5-, and 60-min charts for daytraders); he gives no explanation or examples of what to look for in these charts- one can only assume what he means.  Really a terrible presentation and even worse DVD.",1282694400,,1222,4.6036866359447
