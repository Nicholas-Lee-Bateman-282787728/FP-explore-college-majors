7982330,5,B00008EY8U,"This TV edition shows the connection between the Motown acts and between Dusty Sprinfield, who idolized the Motown moves and sound.  The Miracles, The Temptations, Martha and the Vandellas and the Supremes are backed by the Motown band and the sounds are unbelievable.  Dusty sings ""You Lost the Sweetest Boy"" and every Motown act gets into the groove singing ""Micky's Monkey"" at the conclusion.  The Supremes wear their radiant red fringe dresses, and this is the introduction of the palm up choreography for ""Stop! In the Name of Love"" which is famous even today.  Any fan of Motown should snap a copy of this pioneering show - it's worth every penny.",1167609600,,653,4.8558558558558556
