8517829,4,B007IU8Z0M,"Bangkok Bound is an underrated film. It is worthy of a 9/10.  Audience provided with authentic Bangkok city - day and night scenes: street glamour, beautiful buildings, sensational skyscrapers, luminous lights - realism. True it portrays the seedier side of Bangkok: desperation, prostitution, and poverty, but it does so without adapting to please audiences that want the usual Blockbuster film formula - Yawn. The sex scenes, involving young Jack, are interspersed with tenderness, not brutal. If you like your films to promote your thinking, encourage you to interpret the storyline, rather than providing all the clues and the answers, then this film is for you. I watched it last night and I want to watch it again soon.",1432339200,,725,5.1440677966101696
8517830,1,B007IU8Z0M,"I do not disagree with any of the reviews... thus far.  But from my perspective this movie was lacking in almost every aspect of film production.  The cinematography was awful,  the plot was disjointed,  taking the characters from flashbacks to present day..  not just once,  but,  all over the place.  The writing style was more narrative solique ( sp?) than actual meaningful dialogue.  The best part of the whole movie was Bai Lings  2 or 3 minute vignettes .. most notably without clothes.  And for the ending..  the main character has a shoot out with a fan and dies.  I judge movies mostly by their entertainment value..  This movie gets a failing grade from me.",1425254400,,668,4.695652173913044
8517831,3,B007IU8Z0M,"I really like Bai Ling. Her appearance in this movie is brief, however. The movie itself meanders aimlessly. There is interesting footage of debauched Thailand, and this is the best aspect of the thing.",1401753600,,202,4.970588235294118
8517832,3,B007IU8Z0M,"This film was originally released under the title ""The Bad Penny.""  The visual and music during the opening credits hinted that the film would be grindhouse style.

Jack (Casey T. Evans) known as ""The Ripper"" owns a bar in Bangkok. He is a former boxer from St. Louis. He is visited by a fan Marcus (Nick Faltas) who is congenial in spite of the fact he lost money betting on Jack. As it turned out, Jack was supposed to take a dive in the fifth round, but that never happened. It was a ""sure thing"" as Marcus bet everything he had, including his double wide on it. Tom Arnold has an early role as a bookie.

After the double cross, Jack goes on the lam to Bangkok where he is manipulated with drugs and women. The movie has some theme about choices and if we really have them. Jack makes decisions with a coin toss. The movie seemed like your average grindhouse fare. It wasn't remarkable yet at you didn't get bored.

8517833,4,B007IU8Z0M,An unexpected thriller with fantastic action scenes. This is an art / action film! The fight scenes are beautifully articulated and poetic. The action is intense. The characters are cool and the story is surreal. Great twist.,1334102400,4,225,5.108108108108108
