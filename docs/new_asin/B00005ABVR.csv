7935227,5,B00005ABVR,"I enjoyed this movie.  There are two versions of this movie, rated PG for violence, and the other R because of the nudity, violence, and sexual situations.  The plot is interesting even though a little sluggish as a lot of the horror movies during the 60's and 70's usually are but the story is rather interesting..",1425427200,,315,4.607142857142857

7935229,1,B00005ABVR,"this was the last movie in the doctor orloff series.  The awful doctor orloff is a great movie but this one isn't.  It's a bad movie but many horror movies are. but I believe even a bad horror deserves to have remastering done to the print. It's in fair shape but I wish image
would take more time on old movies and repair the print. The acting is fine in this flick these are all well known europeon actors from 1970.
Howard vernon is a great actor but he can't save this one. The movie is close to plan nine from outer space but without that movies charm.  Still I enjoy bad horror movies and many so called bad ones have many fine aspects about them.  This one is for those looking for a plan nine from outer space type of bad movie though.  Buf for the cheap price you can get this it may be worth it if you enjoy badly made horror movies.  It does feature female nudity though and shouldn't be for small kids.  Even though it is sort of funny once you see the so called 'invisible man"".  As another reviewer said this movie does have a robot monster type of villian.  That movie is more entertaining than this one though.  Still for this price even a bad horror movie is a good edition to a horror fans dvd collection.",1221177600,3,1223,4.188034188034188
7935230,1,B00005ABVR,"This is yet another in the inexplicably-popular ""Dr. Orloff"" series (those Europeans, eh? guess they'll watch ANYthing...). It USED to go by the title ""The Invisible Dead"", but this is it's actual release title.
It is an endurance contest - no kidding. Some friends and I used to joke about the VHS version we'd seen because it was about the ONLY film we'd ever seen that made ""Red Zone Cuba"" and ""Manos"" look fast-paced and exciting. In typical Euro-style, we get odd zoom-in close-up shots of the (mugging) faces of the supporting cast, a plot that drags on and on and on and on, and the ""monster"" is neither invisible NOR a man - if anything, it will remind you of the Ro-Man from ""Robot Monster"", only without the laughs. Special effects? Hah! Watch ""footsteps"" being made while the thing is ""invisible"" - these ""steps"" form at a pace indicating the monster has severe gout in both knees AND feet and will make it all the way across the room by this time next year.
Don't be fooled - there is NO saving this one. No riffs, no beer, NOTHING can prepare you for the unbelievable sadness, boredom, and general sense of ""I wasted my time on THIS?!?!"" that this movie will produce. I actually pride myself on having seen the entire movie, but that's so YOU don't HAVE to...",999734400,12,1272,4.534782608695652
7935231,3,B00005ABVR,"here's a real euro stinker for you. a doctor is summoned to orloffs castle during a storm. there he meets orloffs invisible man which despite being called an invisible man is a)only invisible part of the time b)appears to be somebody in an ape suit rather than a man. not much in particular happens throughout the entire film but it still manages to be so bad it's good. for a few years i actually thought this was a jess franco film-it's uncanny! buy it,grab a few friends and some beer and have a great time!",983577600,5,510,4.378947368421053
7935232,2,B00005ABVR,"If you're a fan of the cheap Euro horror films of the 70s, then this is a five star. If not, probably a one star and switch off halfway through. Typical story about a doctor who turns up at a castle only to find that it is being haunted by an invisible monster. Plenty of dubbing and implied sex scenes. It's a sort of ""Invisible Frankenstein"". It'll make a nice companion piece to ""Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks"" and the Jess Franco movies.
This has also been released as ""The Invisible Dead"" in the UK.",983577600,3,506,4.3936170212765955
