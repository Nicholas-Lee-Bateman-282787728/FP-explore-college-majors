8526444,5,B0089VX12G,"My kids have read the books and watched all of Geronimo Stilton episodes on Volumes 1 and 2.  I couldn't wait for Amazon.com to carry volumes 3 and 4, so I bought them from Amazon.ca (Canadian Amazon!)  Of course, there is a hefty shipping fee as my Amazon Prime account doesn't apply to Amazon in Canada, but it was worth it to see their faces on Easter morning when my girls got Geronimo Stilton Volumes 3 and 4 in their Easter baskets!  So far they are just as entertaining as Volumes 1 and 2!  Geronimo Stilton is entertaining and educational too.  I highly recommend these DVDs.",1364688000,,583,4.462264150943396
