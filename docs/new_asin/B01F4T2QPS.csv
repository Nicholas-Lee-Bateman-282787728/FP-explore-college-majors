8760119,5,B01F4T2QPS,I was so excited to find a complete series edition of power rangers turbo for a great price and then when it arrived I discovered it wouldn't play in my blu-ray player. Deeply recommend the specification be made that it won't play in all dvd and blu-ray players. But overall a great experience both in shipping and return.,1486512000,,322,4.568965517241379
