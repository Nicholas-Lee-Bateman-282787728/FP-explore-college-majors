8236711,3,B00103C20W,"Paul Krugman comes to Charlie Rose with his latest book, 'The Conscience of a Liberal'. Krugman outlines where he believes America should be going in terms of becoming a more fair society. He is especially concerned about extending Health Care for all. He speaks about what it means for him to be a Liberal, and why he feels Americans shun the Liberal label while in fact advocating most Liberal policies. Krugman makes a vicious and in my judgment unfair attack on President Reagan. I feel Charlie Rose should have been much more vigorous here in defense of Reagan. Krugman calls him a racist , motivated by anti- black sentiment in his desire to reduce Welfare, and cut down on Government aid to the poor. Charlie Rose who is always so courteous to his guests should have been less courteous here. He should have put up an angry defense of Reagan. In any case there is much to learn from Krugman on Economic matters despite his irritating manners.",1224979200,,949,4.688622754491018
