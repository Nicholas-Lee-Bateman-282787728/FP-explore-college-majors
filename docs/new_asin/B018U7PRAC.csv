8743026,4,B018U7PRAC,"I learned about Cosmic Yoga after my grandson started greeting me in a ""yoga"" way. His preschool teacher later told me the class does yoga as part of their curriculum, and then I learned it was yoga for children. Okay, that's awesome! That's how I ended up purchasing the series. My four year old granddaughter also loves Cosmic Yoga. The woman leading each 15 minute session tells a cute story, and the poses match an animal or action at that point in the story. I also find the sessions to be quite fun. I would also highly recommend the series to anyone who needs to modify a yoga routine, or maybe wants to move through moves more frequently. As you can imagine, a child is not made to move slowly through an adult-oriented yoga routine.",1525392000,,741,4.496296296296296

8743033,5,B018U7PRAC,We love everything about Cosmic Kids yoga. Can't say enough. We use the online content and have these for travel purposes and because we want to help support this company to keep them doing what they do. It is engaging for the little one and gets the introduction to yoga going with such fun and light-hearted content. Love all of the various themes. Our little one asks for it all the time. And it is so good to start this healthy habit young. I think this is just one of the best products I've seen for kids. I'm not a fan of much screen time for kids but this is worth it. I'd give it a million stars if I could. Absolutely love the whole series.,1467072000,7,649,4.158730158730159
