381062,5,6301954890,"Al Capps' masterpiece lived up to the broadway stage play, but for me the most fasinating fact about the movie is that Mammy Yokum was played by a woman 3 years younger that her son.  Hollywood is a magical place.",1494028800,,213,4.325

381064,5,6301954890,"Great movie and musical.  Saw it years ago, and recently watched it again. Loved ""Lil' Abner"" comics as a kid and once on vacation we visited a them park based on this same comic strip, called ""Dogpatch USA"".  Innocent fun for the family.

Interesting to see Julie Newmar in all her glory as Stupefying Jones, and pre-Batman.  A very brief appearance, but this also was probably the only un-credited appearance in a movie by Jerry Lewis.  And if you look closely, you will see un-credited appearances by both Valerie Harper (Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Donna Douglas (before later achieving fame as Elly Mae in the Beverly Hillbillies).  I completely missed noticing Donna Douglas, until the second viewing.",1488499200,2,706,4.940677966101695

Mammy Holkum is none other than Billie Hayes AKA Witchie Pooh from H R Puf-n-stuf. one of my all time favorite Saturday Line up as a kid.,1486339200,,453,4.512195121951219

381098,4,6301954890,"The big pity here is that this film was made in Technicolor, and VistaVision - two processes that were the best ever. So why does the print look so bad? This film, whatever you think of it, looked stunning in the original release. It needs a full restoration guys, and it deserves it. It's political satire that still stands up today. The original impact it had is lacking because it looks fuzzy and faded.",1484697600,,406,4.5

381196,1,6301954890,I hate it not because of the movie itself but because I was misled by reviews posted here which were for the VHS version of the 1959 film with Peter Palmer and Stubby Kay. I wanted to order that 1959 version as a dvd. This version is not what I wanted. It looks like the one I wanted is not available here or doesn't exist. I hope to be able to return this one without difficulty.,1472256000,,380,4.0131578947368425
381197,4,6301954890,A delightfully silly Hillbilly romp.

381368,5,6301954890,"A genuine hoot and a half! Just good fun. The acting is passable, and dancing is dorky, but it IS about redneks and mountain folk. All in all, thoroughly enjoyed it with my wife. She remembered seeing it in the theater as a kid. The casting is ""spot-on"". I couldn't imagine a better Abner, Daisy Mae or Mammy Yokum. Keep an eye out for a young Donna Douglas in the 'chorus line', Jerry Lewis has a little cameo, as well.

It trashes almost everything in this country from being lazy, corrupt politicians, voluptuous women, muscular men, our libidos.  And then there is the great music score, athletic choreography and very stagy appearance to this movie.  It almost feels like a filmed play yet it works.  The technicolor is garish and appropriate to the material.  Not to sound politically incorrect but it was wonderful to see curvy and attractive women in the movie.  Julie Newmar is literally a physical knockout as is the rest of the cast.  The plot is silly yet it has a lot of the bite that Al Capp had in his comic strip.",1454716800,4,703,4.760330578512397

The characters are varied, colorful, and entertainingly over the top - and Stubby Kaye never disappoints.  (And is that Valerie Harper in the chorus?)

Now I am without it, and I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and pay the arm-and-a-leg price for it, because it isn't likely to be re-released and it isn't likely to get any cheaper.  It's just the law of supply and demand.  If you remember the film fondly but don't have it, you may want to bite the bullet, too.

I get a chuckle recalling L'il Abner's ideal, Fearless Fosdick.  This film lovingly recalls the Dogpatch as I remember it.  You have to chuckle at Mammy Yokem's grotesque protruding chin or Pappy's bulbous nose.  Granville Owen makes for an affable Abner and Martha O'Driscoll makes for a fetching Daisy Mae.  You're on the edge of your seat rooting for Daisy Mae to catch Abner on Sadie Hawkins Day.  The tuneful title song was co-written by Milton Berle.  On this disc the feature is accompanied by ""Private Snuffy Smith"" based on Fred Laswell's comic strip.  An adequate programmer nothing more or nothing less.

The musical is always entertaining, and you can keep your eye open for live performances, or fall back on the DVD.

381904,1,6301954890,"""Li'l Abner"" was originally filmed in a visual aspect of 1.33:1, as were all TV films and programs of the time.  This shady outfit offers you a version that's 16:9.  Now, how do you suppose they did that?  There's 2 ways and either one is a mutilation of the original film.

First, you can cut off the top and bottom of each frame.  This is the way many ""widescreen"" films were made immediately after 1953.  Converting to 16:9 will lose about 1/3 of the image.  You want to pay full price for only 2/3 of the film?

Second, you can expand the image to the widescreen aspect.  This means everyone and everything is bloated.  Try it yourself:  while watching anything that's 1.33:1, use your controller to convert the screen to the wide aspect.  If you like what you see -- say, Humphry Bogart looking like Sidney Greenstreet -- then maybe this travesty is for you -- assuming they didn't just chop it to pieces.

Please note they don't even bother to tell you how they do the deed.  They don't want you to find out how they butchered this film.  These people are not doing you a service.  They're trying to capitalize on the widespread and utterly stupid fear of black bars on the TV screen.  ""This picture has been modified to fit your screen.""  What a bunch of irrational hogwash.  If you're afraid of black bars, maybe TV isn't for you.  There's always radio:  it ALWAYS fits your screen.",1269129600,10,1390,4.48

381906,1,6301954890,"Li'l Abner, 1940 film

The film begins in a rural hamlet, a horse wanders in the dirt road. Daisy Mae awakes to a new day. The characters from the comic strip are here, with make-up to match the cartoon reality. Porkchops for breakfast? There is a reward for ""Earthquake McGoon"". [Can a cigarette lighter be found in such a primitive backwoods community?] The young women wear clothes that are impractical for rural life even today. The script was taken from the comic strip, and suffers for that. The ""Sadie Hawkins Day"" celebration is explained. The comedy seems dated. Was it ridiculous even then? Li'l Abner muses about the important things, like a skunk in a woodshed. [Nobody has any worries about the weather or the economy.] Li'l Abner makes a sandwich, but has stomach pains. The ""doctor"" diagnoses him!

A kiss is a marriage proposal in ""the code of the hills"". Daisy Mae and Li'l Abner will be married the next day. Li'l Abner goes to Skunk Hollow to capture Earthquake McGoon for the huge $25 reward. A fight breaks out, McGoon is captured. Wendy Wilecat shows up to help - for a price. Li'l Abner imagines himself in heaven! Can he keep his promises? The Mayor makes a decision. Is it better to be a hound dog than a rabbit? And so the race begins. The event are comic and unbelievable, like a cartoon. Will Daisy Mae ever catch Li'l Abner? There was never a sequel to this simple-minded story which lacks an ending. Did the audiences dislike it?

The only reason to watch this film is to get an idea of what was once a popular comic strip. In June 1972 just after Watergate newspaper reported that Al Capp was arrested for trying to rape a teenager. His comic strip was dropped by the newspapers and he died a few years later.",1266537600,,1740,4.535031847133758

381908,3,6301954890,"Gray market discs such as this offer no commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features. Dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair.

This non-musical version of the Al Capp comic strip is remarkable for the uncanny likeness these actors bear to the cartoon folks they portray. Buster Keaton is a stand-out in his small role of Lonesome Polecat, legendary brewer of Kickapoo Joy Juice. Mammy and Pappy Yokum (given names: Pansy and Lucifer) are also a delight. A side note: as of 1/10 little Mona Ray (Mammy) was still going strong at age 104!

Many silent era clowns appear (Conklin, Littlefield, St. John, Jamison and former Our Ganger, Mickey Daniels). One is ""slow burn"" specialist Edgar Kennedy (as Cornelius Cornpone).

If you're a fan of Al Capp's work, this picture won't disappoint.

381943,4,6301954890,"I bought the DVD because I have an old lp record of the show's music, and decided to by a DVD before IT became outmoded.  It pleased me to discover  that the show holds up very well.  Al Capp's crazy world of Dogpatch is brought to life with absolutely  no effort at realism. The back drops are literally those of the stage, the choreography  has real people moving and singing like comic strip characters.  I played it for my two-year old granddaughter and she in front of the TV entranced by it all for minutes at a time. Normally she pays no attention at all to live-action films.  For people who remember Capp's strip, of course, the satire comes through loud and clear, and enough of it is sufficiently timeless for everyone to get most of the jokes.  Stubby Kaye is the real star of the film, and he is perfect as Marrying Sam, a minor figure in the strip, and his vigor holds the film together.  But all the cast is pleasant and more than capable.  Although I wish that Edie Adams had been cast as Daisie Mae, Lesie Parrish does a fine job in the role, and Peter Palmer sings well and is appropriately good-looking and naive  as L'l Abner.

381946,5,6301954890,"Musically it's no Rodgers & Hammerstein; but it is an exceptional adaptation from comic strip to cinema, the more so considering its meager budget. Leslie Parrish, Peter Palmer (reprising his Broadway role as Abner), Billie Hayes and Al Nesor are dead ringers for their Dogpatch counterparts, and so is everyone else ...except for Earthquake McGoon (though no one notices). Cult legend Julie Newmar has a minor role as Stupefyin' Jones, and Jerry Lewis makes a stupified cameo. Only Salomey is missing!

Script and sets have a trace of Al Capp's sharp pen and wit (""'Afternoon, I'm Moonbeam McSwine; sleepin' out with pigs is mah line""), and even the choreography resembles the strip's manic tempo and outlandish draftsmanship -something the much more lavished ""Dick Tracy"" tried hard to achieve years later, but didn't.

Given today's infatuation with putting comics and graphic novels on film, it would be interesting to see a LI'L ABNER remake done with state of the art technology, but only if they repeat what makes this forgotten movie a gem: good script and good casting. One can put all the eye-popping visuals money can buy on screen, they won't amount to much if those two basic ingredients are missing.

The introduction of a tonic, that makes men handsome and strong, while at the same time decreasing their virility, was thought to be cause to save the town - Dogpatch USA.

I was born 3 years after this movie was produced. I remember first seeing it in b&w, (not rich enough for a color tv) as a child and was enthralled.
Later (in my early twenties) I saw the last half of this movie (in color!) and was enthralled all over again.
The characterizations and musical numbers are spot on, and one can sense the eagerness of the actors to get it right. Try searching YouTube for Lil Abner and see if this movie's right for you too!",1236124800,,619,5.515789473684211
381973,3,6301954890,"I enjoyed this film as a kid. I performed in the play as a teenager. And yet, watching the first 15 minutes in 2009 socked me in the head with it's base stereotyping and vulgar satirization of an economic sub-class of Americans. If the skin tones had been any other color than Wonder Bread white the film would never see the light of day again. It ought to be required viewing for any non-european-based ethnic group, who would relish it as one massive cakewalk on southern crackers.

381974,4,6301954890,"This is one really strange film. The people who made tried to make humans into cartoon characters through the application of pounds of makeup. Everyone has the look of a postnuclear mutant tribe. The dialog was really hard to follow because of the way they talk (I can't even describe it). Its almost like a warhol film from the 1960s. Everything about it just seems strange and off. But for whatever reasons, its compelling to watch. One virtue is that its not boring like other adaptations of Lil Abner (the musical in particular) and there is always something stranger to see every few minutes.

I think the film as a film probably works better with people who understand the source material really well. If you don't know it, its really difficult to follow whats going on.

But regardless, this film will be an interesting experience for almost anyone. I don't think its ever shown up on DVD unfortunately and the VHS print isn't all that great.",1233878400,3,949,4.710843373493976

As an old-fashioned musical there is something missing from the entire production to make it a true classic that would warrant watching it many times like SINGING IN THE RAIN or SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS.  Political theme still surpirisingly timely. Boy meets girl etc. concept cute.  Leads talented.  I think what's missing is inspired innovative choeorgraphy - lots of box and circle formations and bouncing up and down which is actually boring to watch.  If you've seen just about every musical in the A and B leagues and you have time on your hands or if you're related to one of the cast members, Li'l Abner is just OK as an ole relic.",1226361600,,672,4.669491525423729

382033,4,6301954890,"Al Capp's characters went to Broadway, then to Hollywood. Capp lost a leg in a trolley accident as a boy. His bitterness wraps itself in satire. The music is forgettable. My interest is Julie Newmar as Stupefyin' Jones. She is a secret weapon invented by Available Jones, a metaphor for the atomic bomb. Jones unleashes her in the Sadie Hawkins Day race to stupefy men so the women of Dogpatch catch husbands. Newmar is devastating in seamed nylons. She was the sexiest woman in the history of women---5'11"", 145 pounds. She was never an actress, being cast in nonhuman roles. Ultimately, she proved more than a body, raising her son, who was born with Down Syndrome. Li'l Abner is dated but still turns up on the stage. I saw it at the Derby Dinner Playhouse in Clarksville, Indiana.",1203552000,,784,4.688405797101449

The cast of characters then try to prove there is something useful. At first it is thought that Mammie's tonic will provide the proof. That fails, but they are saved at the last moment. The show includes the Sadie Hawkins race where women try to catch a husband and an evil businessman and his shady female associate try to control the race and the availability of Mammie's tonic. The highlight of the entire show, however, is Stubby Kaye who plays the part of Marrying Sam. His portrayal and his singing are superb. I recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys fun improbabilities and especially those who remember the Lil Abner cartoon strip that was printed for so many years in the nation's newspapers.",1201046400,,849,4.704697986577181

382036,3,6301954890,"The musical is based upon the newspaper cartoon that came out daily until the 70s.  It's creator, Al Capp, used the hicks and hillbillys of Dogpatch to make subtle points about the U.S. and its government and big business.  This musical follows along those lines.  In this era of multi-national corporations and rampant greed, it hits a cord.  The song, ""Whats Good for General Bullmoose is Good for the USA"" is funny, but right on target for today's corporations and right wingers.  Gen. Bullmoose is the CEO of his business, not a military leader and it is sung by a chorus of ""yes"" men.  Perhaps it was supposed to be a play on General Motors, I don't know, but there is a lot of that type of satire.  Our friend's younger children loved it and have watched it over and over.  The choreography is frantic, think ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" at double speed.  There are several nice tunes, and the story does not seem contrived like today's juke box broadway plays such as Mamma Mia.  Overall, a great choice for children, and just ok for adults.",1184371200,,1053,4.5828877005347595

The gorgeous 50's pin-up style women are especially true to their source (and Julie Newmar really earns the name ""Stupefyin' Jones"").  Leslie Parish makes a luminous Daisy May, and Peter Palmer is the biggest, brawniest baritone Abner you could imagine.  Mammy and Pappy are also great, but the weirdest impersonation has got to be Eagle-Eye Fleagle-- that guy moves like a cartoon!  The plot is as kooky as one of Capp's Sunday half-page strips.  Kind of corny but lively, with very athletic dancing by various hillbilly-clad young Broadway performers.  The only flaw is its stagey-ness and flat lighting with multiple shadows on the studio floor.  Still, with Gen. Bullmoose, Marryin' Sam (Stubby Kaye), Mooshine McSine, the Scraggs and a lot of plot convolutions, it is a very satisfying fable.",1178064000,2,916,5.10738255033557

382039,3,6301954890,"I'd heard of this show over the years and have been very curious to see what it was like.  Fortunately, a friend gave me a copy as a gift, and I finally saw what Lil Abner is about.  A very strange story about a secret formula that turns ordinary men into asexual musclemen is one of the stranger plot threads.  I guess the word for it is camp.  The scenery is very cartoony (which works well with the feel of this film), and the cast is full of terrific performers (Stubby Kaye is a brilliant performer as always), but the one that really blew me away is the very young Billie Hayes recreating her stage performance as Abner's elderly mother.  According to my estimate, Hayes had not yet hit 30 when she played this character, and she is nothing short of wonderful.  I couldn't help be think that Paul Henning based his Beverly Hillbillies television series on this film and stage musical, so many of the characters are echoed in that series.  The character of Granny is so much like Billie Hayes' portrayal in this film, that I am surprised that Henning didn't just hire Hayes when he was casting his ""Granny.""  The film is a bit slow in places, and the musical numbers are just not as good as in some other Broadway scores, but the movies is enjoyable and obviously not meant to be taken seriously.",1171152000,3,1301,4.436974789915967

382042,1,6301954890,"Buster Keaton should have known better. This is one of the most insufferable films in history. I may donate my copy to the CIA to assist with interrogation of especially hardened suspects. It's that bad. The film immortalizes the unfunny antics of L'il Abner (Jeff York) along with other characters from Dogpatch (and neighboring Skunk Hollow) like the villain Earthquake McGoon (Charles Post,) and the most embarrassing ""Indian"" in screen history, Lonesome Polecat (Buster Keaton,) whose performance ranks as perhaps the worst ever.

The plot concerns the hilarious events of life with one brain cell: entrapment into marriage; the awkwardness of kissing; fistfights; sharing an annual bath with a pig; eating mustard and wondering if that leads to death or merely indigestion, etc. In the physical deformity department Exhibit A is the nose. Most of the cast has on idiotic round nose appliances making them appear more inbred than you might even expect. This was all a bit irritating, but perhaps most annoying of all was the theme song (which we get to hear twice, and was co-written by Milton Berle, who should also have known better) which goes on an on about how all the girls want L'il Abner, and then concludes with a line (about how L'il Abner just wants a porkchop) that fits neither the rhyme or meter of the song.

I may not be from a generation that really ""gets"" the comedic genius of L'il Abner, but this movie was given to me by a friend (I will be avenged), who, in turn, was given this film by his mother who is advanced enough in age to be in the subset of the population who should be able to appreciate this film. She is a very smart and wise woman, and has increased in stature in my eyes for her extremely concise and accurate review of this film, which I think stands as an excellent summary. She said ""This is the worst movie I have ever seen.""

Heed this sage advice and do not watch this if you value your time or sanity. If you are given this as a gift, I recommend a strategy differing from the one that I used (which was acceptance and a troubled ""thank you""). Instead I recommend that you momentarily hand it back to the giver, point behind you and exclaim ""Look! A bear with the head of Sandra Day O'Connor!"" When the giver turns to look for the bear, run in the opposite direction as fast as you can, abandon all your belongings in place, move to Bolivia, and do not reveal your identity for at least ten years.

382060,5,6301954890,"LIL ABNER is a delightful comedy-musical with stronger emphasis on comedy than most movie musicals.  This film version of the Broadway hit musical that was based on the legendary comic strip looks fantastic on DVD in a beautiful print with it's comic book coloring.  It's also superbly cast.  The film's producers did take a risk hiring two unknowns to play Lil Abner and Daisy Mae - Peter Palmer (who starred in the Broadway show) and Leslie Parrish - but they are perfectly cast and excellent in the roles (it's hard to picture any major male movie stars of the period as Abner anyway, although Daisy Mae might have been played by a number of buxom blondes of the era). It's a shame neither Palmer or Parrish went on to much movie work after this although both were quite active guest starring on television for many years. Both are mighty fine delectable representations of their sexes appeals, as the Dogpatch crowd might say.

It's true that perhaps only a few of the songs are memorable - notably ""Jublian P. Cornpone"", ""A Typical Day in Dogpatch"", and ""Put 'em Back The Way They Was"" which is sung by five hillbilly cuties including the very young Valerie Harper (""Rhoda"") and Beth Howland (""Alice"") but most of the songs are good-humored  and enthusically put over by the cast and dancers most of whom were in the original Broadway show.  Jerry Lewis has a funny walk-on cameo and the gorgeous Julie Newmar and Stella Stevens have amusing secondary roles. Most of the ladies in the picture are making their film debuts here, including Donna Douglas as the busty hillbilly girl (a few years before becoming famous as one on THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES) who wants ""to broaden our horizons"" and is informed by Mammy Yokum (superbly played by Billie Hayes) that she her horizons is broaden enough.  There's quite a bit of political satire in here as well (with politicans with such apt names as Mayor Dogmeat and Senator Jack S. Phigbound) and the Sadie Hawkins Day sequence (a Dogpatch storyline that became a pop culture phenomeon of it's own with many high schools for years having an annual  ""Sadie Hawkins Dance"" in where girls would be the ones to ask guys for a date years before this was considered ""acceptable"") is a lot of fun.

But I just purchased it out of curiosity and was pretty much floored by how bad this movie is. The print transfer was great, and the quaility and color are everything one could hope to see. And if you like looking at very beautiful women in costumes that accentuate their best physical qualities, then I have to say it fits that bill. It's worth the price just to see Julie Newmar as Stupefyin' Jones.

However, the movie just isn't worth the time. The musical numbers are not very good. The direction isn't what one would hope. The casting wasn't very good, either, with most performers seeming to stroll through their roles, or in some cases just examples of some really bad acting. Yes, it was caricature and an adaptation of a musical of a comic strip filled with fantastic folk. But in some cases the portrayals were so over-the-top as to induce groans.

One thing I was surprised to note was the brief appearance of Jerry Lewis. I'd forgotten that he had the cameo.

If you have some fond childhood memories of this movie, then it's worth a look. Or if you just want to see the faithful adaptation of the female comic strip characters to flesh and blood actresses, then you'll probably like it.

382106,3,6301954890,"When LI'L ABNER was made, in 1940, Al Capp's comic strip of the same name was one of the U.S.'s favorites, with his hayseed creation finding himself in one jam after the other, without trying at all. A story by Capp is the foundation for this film, which holds a unique spot in cinema history, as it is the only attempt to precisely recreate comic illustration, utilizing makeup, costumes and exact phrasing (without interpretation). The plot and subplots generally revolve about the annual Sadie Hawkins Day celebration in Dogpatch, which presents area females with just about their only opportunity to catch a husband, by literally running down and snaring one of the town's fleeing bachelors. For those who remember the silent film era, this effort provides small roles for many pre-talkie stalwarts, including Buster Keaton, Edgar Kennedy, Chester Conklin, Al St. John, Lucien Littlefield, Hank Mann and Edward Brady. At times very reminiscent of Capp's drawing, the very tall Jeff York, billed as Granville Owen, is effective as Abner. Martha O'Driscoll, Kay Sutton and Billie Seward, as the three women most vigorously seeking marriage with Abner, do their hearty best with the thin scenario. More silly than cute, this picture is not marked by outstanding work from cast and crew, its significance coming only from the mentioned verisimilitude.",1145836800,5,1351,5.201834862385321

I think Johnny Mercer is as badly overrated as are Hammerstein, Ira Gershwin and Harburg.  Someone said that Abner was his masterpiece.  I don't even think it's his best effort.  He did a few moderately adquate pieces with Henry Mancini, but that's about it.  The plot is ridiculous and that adds to the fun.  Stubby Kaye was Stubby Kaye and that's good enough for me.  He and Peter Palmer (both from the stage show) were treasures, as was everyone else in the movie.  I thought the Sady Hawkins dance was boring and long, but it's a small price to pay for such delicious singing and inspired nonsense.  One warning.  The dialogue sucks!

Jeff York could of used about 30 more pounds of muscle to really look like Abner(those skinny arms just didn't cut it). At least he wasn't sloppy and overweight as he was in the 1950's when he appeared in ""Old Yeller"". This movie is now being sold on DVD at stores like Walmart for $1.00, what a shame as some of this high budget trash they make today and sell for 20 bucks isn't even worth a nickel!

382129,3,6301954890,"While it is great for us Ll'L ABNER fans to finally have the delightful musical on DVD, Paramount has done a poor job on this one. I suppose they don't consider the film ""important enough"" for better treatment. The widescreen print is not genuinely widescreen; comparing it to the VHS full-screen format, there is only slightly more picture on the sides, while the top and bottom of the frame are somewhat cut off. While the colors are a huge improvement over the pale VHS, there is an odd, unnatural hue to skin-tones and over-saturation in the more vivid scenic elements. Yes, the intense colors were part of the comic-strip concept in the art direction, but the reproduction on the DVD is rather uneven.  The lack of ANY special features is the worst offense. Many of the original cast members are still alive and could have contributed either audio commentary or interviews; in fact, Peter Palmer - Abner himself -  is alive and well in Florida and recently did a newspaper interview about the making of the film. There were two filmed musical numbers which were cut from the movie - about 2/3 of ""If Had My Druthers"" was excised (a still from the cut section is used as one of the menu backgrounds),  and ""Unecessary Town"" was filmed but cut entirely. It would have been nice to have had the outtakes. The recent releases on WB of ""Brigadoon,"" ""Bells Are Ringing,"" ""Easter Parade"" and ""The Band Wagon"" feature a large number of outtakes, cut musical numbers. If only Paramount had shown a fraction of the care which WB has given to their musical releases, this LI'L ABNER would have been a much more satisfying disc.",1114905600,24,1621,4.680701754385965
382130,4,6301954890,"I have a vague recollection as a child in the seventies of the comic strip ""Li'l Abner"" is based on.  The hilbilly vernacular that writer Al Capp used was a slight chore getting through and the political satire was a little over my head.  This 1959 film is quite enjoyable, however.  Director Melvin Frank and co-scripter Norman Panama have retained the pointed satire of Capp's strip.  Peter Palmer has a hunky affability as Abner.  Leslie Parrish does a sweet turn as Daisy Mae.  Good supporting turns by the cast in particular Stubby Kaye as Marryin' Sam and Billy Hayes as Mammy Yokum.  The choreography is quite imaginative which is most prevalent in the Sadie Hawkins Day sequence.  If I can find a fault with the film it would be in the score.  Though energetically performed by a game cast the songs were not particularly memorable to me.  Though alot of the film's humor is derived from the Cold War politics of it's day the film does not seem dated.  I wholeheartedly suggest that you'll have a good time with ""Li'l Abner"".

Much of the Broadway cast was here to bring life to this endearing Al Capp opus. Leslie Parrish is gorgeous; one of Stella Stevens' first roles; the singing is great and the very athletic dancing, on a smaller scale, is reminiscent of ""7 Brides"" (also choreographed by Michael Kidd). Stubby Kaye, as usual, is wonderful. The adapted Score was Oscar nominated. I was 10 years old when I first saw this in a theatre in 1959.""The country's in the very best of hands"". Government deception could never happen, huh? This play and film was made in the 50's, the ""comfortable"" Eisenhower years, and after Joe McCarthy's disgrace. Think about the thoughts at that time. How're we doin' now? This was one of the first films/plays to suggest government ""ambivilence""...in a humorous way.",1114214400,10,932,4.942675159235669
382132,2,6301954890,"Al Capp's cartoon strip was so satirically acidic that he was constantly being threatened with suit by the public figures he parodied--and at least one, Joan Baez, actually took him to court.  But viewers needn't expect much of Capp's celebrated wit in this 1940 cinematic take on the much celebrated residents of Dogpatch, USA; more silly than clever and more embarassing than entertaining, L'IL ABNER has been justly neglected for more than a half a century.

Still, it does have a few charms, and most of these are among the cast.  Director Albert S. Rogell was a workhorse of the silent era, and the film is crammed to overflowing with a host of silent actors taking one more shot at fame--with the great Buster Keaton the most celebrated name on the roster.  Sad to say, they are largely wasted, but we're at least given a chance to see them once more, a decade after their stars faded.

The most successful members of the cast are actually the younger players, with Jeff York (billed as Granville Owen) unexpectedly effective in actually looking the part of L'il Abner himself.  Martha O'Driscoll is merely acceptable as Daisy Mae, but Billie Seward strikes all the right notes as the man-hungry Cousin Delightful.  And now and then a moment ""pops"" enough for you to see a little of what made Capp's concepts so wickedly funny.

The plot is standard Capp, but it lacks Capp's bite: Daisy Mae loves Abner, Cousin Delightful wants him for herself, and Abner prefers porkchops.  In terms of production values, the film was very obviously done on the cheap, and Rogell's direction is hardly inspired: not only is the camera static, the pace is positively leaden.  The Digiview DVD release states that it has been ""digitally remastered,"" but if so, you'd hardly know it; the elements are at absolute best merely tolerable.  Fans of the original strip will probably find it a guilty pleasure, but even they will likely admit that this is Al Capp with both fangs pulled.

382134,3,6301954890,"When LI'L ABNER was made, in 1940, Al Capp's comic strip of the same name was one of the U.S.'s favorites, with his hayseed creation finding himself in one jam after the other, without trying at all. A story by Capp is the foundation for this film, which holds a unique spot in cinema history, as it is the only attempt to precisely recreate comic illustration, utilizing makeup, costumes and exact phrasing (without interpretation). The plot and subplots generally revolve about the annual Sadie Hawkins Day celebration in Dogpatch, which presents area females with just about their only opportunity to catch a husband, by literally running down and snaring one of the town's fleeing bachelors. For those who remember the silent film era, this effort provides small roles for many pre-talkie stalwarts, including Buster Keaton, Edgar Kennedy, Chester Conklin, Al St. John, Lucien Littlefield, Hank Mann and Edward Brady. At times very reminiscent of Capp's drawing, the very tall Jeff York, billed as Granville Owen, is effective as Abner. Martha O'Driscoll, Kay Sutton and Billie Seward, as the three women most vigorously seeking marriage with Abner, do their hearty best with the thin scenario. More silly than cute, this picture is not marked by outstanding work from cast and crew, its significance coming only from the mentioned verisimilitude.",1105747200,2,1351,5.201834862385321

382147,5,6301954890,"I'm sorry but I really love this movie. Not only a thoroughly enjoyable old-fashioned musical comedy, but also one of the most successful transitions of a Broadway show from stage to screen. Probably because they didn't try to ""open it out"" too much but kept to its theatrical origins and style by filming entirely on sound stages against cartoon-ish backdrops and sets. The show is, after all, based on a famous comic strip and the film is able to recreate that look much better than any stage production could. The result is a high-energy, fast-paced, knee-slappingly funny, rip-roaring musical amusement.

The ever reliable team of Melvin Frank and Norman Panama not only managed to bring Li'l Abner to the screen virtually intact, they also brought along some of the key members of the original cast, most notably Stubby Kaye (never better) as Marryin' Sam and the amazing Peter Palmer as Li'l Abner. The screen is also filled with attractive and scantily-clad (in the best possible taste) females including winsome Leslie Parrish as Daisy Mae, stunning Julie Newmar as Stupefyin' Jones, and delectable Stella Stevens as the wonderfully named Appassionata Von Climax. All the familiar Dogpatch characters are there, back by the most energetic chorus line ever seen.

If the film occasionally brings to mind that other classic backwoods musical Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, that's because the songs are by Johnny Mercer and Gene De Paul and the show's original choreography was by Michael Kidd - all of whom contributed so effectively to that earlier film.

Li'l Abner is nothing if not fun with a decidedly bawdy and occasional cynical sense of humor that ranges from terrible puns and double entendres to slightly risque observations on male/female relationships to political satire. The satire is not as dated as you might think - just listen to the song ""The Country's In The Very Best Of Hands"".

The world was a different place back when Li'l Abner was made and, of course, there really isn't a Dogpatch. But it's still a wonderful place to visit for a couple of hours. What I wouldn't give for a restored, widescreen, stereo DVD of this film...",1093478400,53,2158,4.969529085872576

382149,5,6301954890,"It may not be a classic, but ""Li'l Abner"" is a lively movie with a convoluted storyline that does credit to its creator, the late Al Capp.  All the characters are here: Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat, brewers extraordinaire of Kickapoo Joy Juice; Moonbeam McSwine (Carmen Alvarez), who sings that ""sleepin' out with pigs is my line;"" Earthquake McGoon (Bern Hoffman), the ""world's champeen dirty rassler,"" who is so besotted with the beautiful Daisy Mae (Parrish) that he conspires with Senator Jack S. Phogbound (Ted Thurston) to get Dogpatch evacuated and destroyed so its inhabitants will be forced to give up their cherished tradition of Sadie Hawkins Day, under which no man can marry a girl unless she first catches him in the annual race (Daisy, of course, has eyes only for Li'l Abner); Available Jones (William Lanteau), the avaricious storekeeper, and his cousin, the statuesque Stupefyin' (Julie Newmar), whose body can stop any red-blooded male dead in his tracks; General Bullmoose (Howard St. John), the world's richest man, who dreams of owning ""all the money in the world,"" and his ""executive secretary,"" the redheaded Appassionatta Von Climax (Stella Stevens), who plot to gain control of the formula for Yokumberry Tonic (even unto planning Abner's murder); Evil-Eye Fleagle (Al Nesor), the scurrying Brooklynite with an arsenal of ""whammies,"" who hires out to further their plan; ""mystical"" and ""pugilistical"" Mammy Yokum (Billie Hayes), who originated the tonic, and her henpecked husband Pappy (Joe E. Marks); Marryin' Sam (Kaye), who returns ""home"" to Dogpatch every year to unite the Sadie Hawkins victors and their captives in holy matrimony; and, of course, the devoted Daisy and her reluctant swain, nave and patriotic Abner (Palmer).  Adapted by Melvin Frank (who also directed) and Norman Panama (who produced) from their stage version, it turns upon the efforts of the Dogpatchers to save their town by finding ""something valuable""--which seems at first blush to be Mammy's tonic, brewed from the fruits of the world's only Yokumberry tree.  This tonic, which makes men youthful and physically perfect, is instantly coveted by the government and General Bullmoose alike--but it has the unfortunate side-effect of making the user completely disinclined to romance, hence Abner's stiff resistance to being ""caught"" by Daisy Mae, even though he is fond of her.  In the end, Daisy is willing to sacrifice herself (as Earthquake's bride) to gain her suitor's help for her beloved Abner, but it's Pappy Yokum who saves the day with shrewd psychology.  And Dogpatch is saved too, by a most unexpected revelation.
Casting and makeup are to be commended for creating an assortment of characters that match Capp's vision uncannily (as do Alvin Colt's costumes); I'm always particularly impressed at the size difference between Li'l Abner and his parents.  Michael Kidd offers several dance numbers of great verve in ""Don't That Take the Rag Offen the Bush,"" ""Jubilation T. Cornpone,"" and ""The Matrimonial Stomp.""  The cartoonist's satirical tone is echoed in Palmer and Kaye's duet, ""The Country's in the Very Best of Hands,"" and Palmer and Parrish's two numbers, ""Namely Me"" (a frequent catchphrase from the strip) and ""Otherwise,"" deserve to be better known.  The entire movie was, of course, shot on sound stages, but considering its previous incarnation on Broadway that should be little distraction.  Its broadly portrayed ""hillbillies"" and occasional '50's chauvinism are far from politically correct, but it should appeal to kids (who will probably miss the double entendres and the sharp pokes at government, big biz, and the like, and just enjoy the laughs) and adults alike.",1044403200,83,3706,5.2571912013536375

382154,4,6301954890,"Based on Al Capp's long-lived send-up of hillbilly life, this 1959 production of ""Lil Abner"" definitely violates contemporary standards related to cultural sensitivity and political correctness, but I have to confess that I still find it funny and charming.
I can certainly understand that southern hill people would find the unrelenting ridicule with which they are treated in this show offensive (the portrayal of Indians as comical purveyors of ""Kickapoo Joy Juice"" is also hard to overlook). On the other hand, however, the movie overall should be seen as a satirical farce, one that skewers corporate executives and Washington politicians every bit as fiercely as it does poor white mountain people. As such, viewers can't be blamed for enjoying the knee-slapping comedy and (especially) the catchy and clever songs that render the show truly memorable.
The staging of ""Lil Abner"" is low-budget and cheesy, including amateurishly painted scenic backdrops and for some reason, evergreen trees that have been allowed to turn brown and dead-looking. The numerous ensemble dance numbers are competently choreographed, but from a post-millenial vantage point, this style of frenetic, jazzy dance routine gets tiresome quickly.
Overall, the show is lots of fun for the social and political satire it incorporates, and for the memorable musical numbers, including especially the hilarious ""Jubilation T. Cornpone,"" Leslie Parrish as Daisy Mae's lamenting ""I'm Past My Prime,"" and the short but priceless ditty that declared, ""What's good for General Bullmoose is good for the U.S.A."" Great stuff!
It's the Al Capp of Earthquake McGoon, Stupifyin' Jones, Marryin' Sam, Mammy Yokum, and Sadie Hawkins Day that I remember fondly, and it's this playfully fun vision of Dogpatch U.S.A. that is captured so well in ""Lil' Abner.""
