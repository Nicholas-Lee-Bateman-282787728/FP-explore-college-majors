I think that the quality of the DVD is Excellent, but the book that comes with the dvd is printed in very small, very hard to read print. the book is a small insert that comes inside the dvd. I found it nearly impossible to read the micro tabs and play the banjo. I still think Tony is the man and have just ordered his full size book.",1232841600,,353,3.9166666666666665
