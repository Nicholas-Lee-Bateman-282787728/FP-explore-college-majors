7108758,1,B00VTDQ7ZO,"I started watching the documentary and pulled up the the Wikipedia page for the lady serial killer. My question is what came first , the wiki page on the lady or the documentary??? Because the documentary was almost word for word as the wiki page. Go ahead . google her name, check out the wiki page while you are watching the show. Not sure who got lazy.",1441065600,3,355,4.313432835820896
7108759,4,B00VTDQ7ZO,"The information about this woman was presented in a slightly different manner that I found illuminating and...well... it's a strange word for this dreadful topic, but 'entertaining' as well.  I remember reading about this woman as I did my research for the book I wrote on Belle Gunness.  There were two other ladies in London doing this, too...and way too many orphanages in the U.S. allowing children to die, either of disease or starvation.  We think of the Victorian/Edwardian age as a time of high morals by the middle class. We're very wrong.",1440979200,,548,4.870967741935484

7108761,3,B00VTDQ7ZO,"""Angel Maker: Serial Killer Queen"" is a documentary about the mother of all child killers, Amelia Dyer. During the same period in British history as Jack The Ripper and Sherlock Holmes novels, Amelia disguised her sinister motives under the guise of nurturing do-gooder. She took in the infants and toddlers of destitute, and single mothers in need and set out to methodically murder each one.

""Angel Maker"" is a chilling and heart-wrenching true story of a very evil and possibly criminally insane woman during a period of history that seemed ideal breeding grounds for the serial killer, insane mind. The documentary manages to tell that story with haunting, and macabre conviction to the crimes of child murdering in an emotionally effective manner. The soundtrack is an instrumental row of depressed melodies that give the piece, and especially the suffrage of these tiny victims, some real depth of sorrow. The narrator is as somber and monotone as you would expect and need to give this thing a respective, non-sensationalized level of respect. He, along with the soundtrack makes it very clear and concise that Amelia Dyer was a monster and not a legend to be held with the same macabre fascination as say Lizzie Borden.
The downside and gripe that I have with ""Angel Maker: Serial Killer Queen"" is the lack of actual material that surrounded her case or life. No pictures, crime scene photos, news paper stuff, nothing. The whole thing seemed filled with public domain clips from film and photographs of generic moments from the the time period. True it does set the tone and atmosphere of the society and quality of life that gave rise to this horror, but not one real, recognizable slice of Amelia Dyer or her actual life is visual in here. Strip away the material that is just about that period in history or a generalization of the people and environment and you may have 30 minutes of material. So I am on the fence. It tells Amelia's stories but no more than an audio book could do. It is like a ""half-made"" documentary. ( ? )

Amazon doesn't do 1/2 stars so I always give the other half to the film...Or this would get only 2 1/2 stars from me.",1433376000,7,2160,4.726790450928382

7108767,2,B00VTDQ7ZO,"most of the video or photos had nothing to do with Amelia Dyer.  I was seeing the same pictures again and again throughout the 23 min's of movie I could manage to make it through.  They had probably  20 min's of info, if that and the video mostly consisted of videos that had nothing to do with her bio or crimes.

8711179,1,B00VTDQ7ZO,"OMG this is bad. I love true crime documentaries and this is one of the worst. Just look at Amelia Dyer's Wikipedia entry and save the minutes of your life watching this disaster.
It's basically someone reading her Wikipedia entry poorly edited together with lots of public domain black and white photos and video. Ugh. It would be a really good high school project but that is all it is. So glad I didn't waste money on this.
