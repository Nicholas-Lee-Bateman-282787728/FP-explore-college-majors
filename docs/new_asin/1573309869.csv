191115,4,1573309869,"This tape while on the short side and not overly challenging, works great for me.  I'm able to get in an energizing workout before heading to work without getting up much earlier than I normally do.  While you don't get  all the calorie burning benefits of a longer workout, I will definitely be  able to do this tape more often than some of the longer ones and pick up  the intensity as I improve.  This is a great companion to her other fat  burning tapes(I have one of her older ones and intend to purchase 2 of her  newer ones).  I will rotate this in for variety or use it on the days when  I just don't have time for the 50 minute to 1hr workouts.",943833600,15,653,4.111111111111111
191116,5,1573309869,"This is an exercise video for which there are no adequate superlatives.  I only wish it had been available when I was unable to walk for 6 months and was in dire need of exercise.  This video would have given me exactly what  I needed.  Not only are these exercises beneficial for amputees, they would  also benefit the elderly or anyone who is inactive.  From the very  beginning of this video, it's immediately apparent this is an exercise  video which will keep you in excellent physical form.  It is very easy to  follow and works up to a great cardiovascular workout.  For those who  aren't currently involved in an exercise program, this is a great place to  begin - it will make you feel stronger and more energetic.  I  wholeheartedly recommend this video for EVERYONE!",940118400,6,777,4.651851851851852
191117,5,1573309869,I've tried many exercise videos and find this one the most fun and because it's only a 30 min. workout is much easier to work into my daily schedule.  I also use Kathy Smith's Fat-Burning Workout but find this one easier to  fit in because of it's slightly shorter length.  I really love this one  because it's dancey and the music is really great!!  Thank you Kathy!,923788800,3,367,4.417910447761194
191118,5,1573309869,"This video integrates marching/walking with arm movements that really get the heart to pumping. The movements are easy to follow and the entire workout is NOT boring.  A great video for beginners or for more advanced  who want a moderate workout. I own 4 Kathy Smith videos and enjoy each one  for their diversity of content.  ""Marching to Fitness"" is one of  the best ""walk videos"" I have seen.",923702400,25,395,4.666666666666667
191129,4,1573309869,"I absolutely love this tape!  I find it very simple to follow and not too strenious on your body.
If you are a hardcore aerobic lover, I do admit this tape is not for you.  It is definetely not high aerobics at all.
For somebody who is just starting out exercising, this tape is excellent.  And for somebody who is an avid exerciser, this tape is great for those days that you want to take it easy, but get your heart rate pumping.",1051747200,,431,4.168674698795181

191131,5,1573309869,"This tape is easy and fun to do.  I have done it many times and still enjoy the variety of moves and the music.  Kathy integrates basic marching with simple to learn dance steps that work well with the music.  You aren't bored--wondering if it will ever be over. The time flys by and you get a good workout that you can modify for intensity as you need to.
  I have about 30 exercise tapes (most of which collect dust) and am always looking for new tapes that I enjoy and can actually DO.  (over 50 here and need to lose a few pounds).  This one stays on top of my tv and gets used frequently.  I rotate this with Leslie Sansone's Two Mile Walk for variety.
  Kathy is always on top of her cueing and you never get lost in the middle of a move.  I have never met a Kathy Smith tape I didn't like.  She is friendly, gives good instruction, and is energetic without being hyper.
  This one gets an A.  Thanks Kathy.",1022889600,3,913,4.107954545454546
191132,5,1573309869,"Kathy smith is great.  She has two additional instructors working with her in the background showing more advanced moves than the ones she does.  It's a great exercise video for beginner exercisers or for people like myself who want to work on their cardio and the other fitness instructors are too challenging.  The music and the moves are fun, but remember, this is a work out video, so it will be cheezy at times.  Still, she's one of my favorite instructors and I love this tape.  It's your half hour cardio workout all in one tape.",1020902400,2,536,4.541666666666667
191133,5,1573309869,"I have never been one to enjoy exercising.  But, I have always had a struggle with losing and maintaining my weight.  I thought I would buy this video after reading all of the reviews on Amazon.com.  I am VERY happy that I did buy it.  Kathy Smith is great.  She has an entire segment (before the actual workout) where she explains what the video entails and what kinds of movements, etc., you will be doing.  During the workout itself, she explains every move and goes over it several times before incorporating it into a mini routine.  She also educates you on how to tell if you are over-doing it, during the workout; and she stresses to slow down if you are over-doing it.  Finally, she is always reminding you to drink water and rehydrate yourself.  I highly recommend this video to someone who usually dreads exercise, but knows they have to, if they want to lose or maintain weight.  I know it's something I will continue WANTING to do... and for me, that's an amazing thing... and a first!!!",1018310400,6,999,4.5307262569832405
191134,3,1573309869,"A non-intimidating and easy to follow introduction to aerobics.  This is a fun, gentle workout that allows beginners to actually move the next day without painkillers or a taunt a spouse.  What does this mean?  You can come back for more!  Kathy's motto is consistency; she encourages the start of a regular routine by creating a safe, short workout that is adaptable for people with different abilities.
Familiar music and dance moves keep things interesting.  The dancy moves aren't too extreme, nor do they require a lot of space to perform correctly.  Great for those needing to ""take it easy"" and ease into exercise in a safe, but effective way.",1002499200,5,650,4.863636363636363
191135,3,1573309869,"As another viewer noted...  This is more of a dance video, not a walking tape.  I found most of the moves difficult to follow.  (I'll stick with the Queen Bee of Walk Aerobics--Leslie Sansone.)  I also found it too distracting to watch people with what I consider to be odd body shapes.  Thank goodness there were only three to begin with...  Definitely too masculine looking, with the exception of the curvaceous, dark haired lady on Kathy's left.  She helped to make the difference.  (She should be in a Leslie Sansone video!)  In all fairness however, I must admit that the studio was absolutely break taking, and I did enjoy most of the music and the energy of all three women.  All in all... it was fun to WATCH for entertainment... but not to exercise too.",985132800,3,762,4.5777777777777775
191136,5,1573309869,"This is an excellent workout for beginners, intermediates, and really, anyone who wants a short, easy, straight-to-the-point workout. It's only 30 mins long, so even the busiest person should be able to fit it into their day. What I have found to be very beneficial, (if you have time and want more of a workout), is to combine this program with Kathy Smith's ""Secrets for a great body"" tapes. There's 2...one for upper body and one for lower body. I alternate them so, along with a short aerobic tape like this one, you get a good cardio and body sculpting workout. But even by itself, it's a good workout and easy on the joints.",981244800,3,630,4.535087719298246
191137,5,1573309869,"March To Fitness was my second exercise video. The original Buns Of Steel was my first, but turned me off to exercising. Kathy Smith's video, on the  other hand, motivated me to exercise on a regular basis. I have been doing  her workouts for almost 6 years. She consistently adds fun into her  workouts.
I found this workout to be fun and very unintimidating. My fav  part of it is when she does the 90s funk exercises!",969408000,6,420,4.415584415584416
7798019,5,1573309869,"LOVE THIS!!! BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE LONG WORKOUTS, I CREATED MY OWN ""DANCE"" WORKOUT THAT FITS INTO MY TIMING. I LOVE BALLET & MANY OF HER SEGMENTS ARE BEAUTIFUL BALLET MOVES. I ENDED UP WITH A 32 MIN. DANCE WORKOUT THAT I THOROUGHLY ENJOY!!!",1423958400,,239,4.454545454545454

7798022,5,1573309869,"I love this workout.  It was in my collection as a VHS tape and I bought the DVD when I no longer had a tape player.
If you don't work up a sweat doing this tape then you're not putting the effort into it.  I walk on 5 miles on varied terrain in 1.5 hrs so I'm not out of shape.  I just did this workout again because weather won't permit me to go outside and I was slightly breathless for the entire workout (once I had warmed up) and ended up in a good sweat.
It's easy to follow - no extraneous chit chat or squeals (thank goodness) and it's FANTASTIC if you're just getting back into an exercise routine because you can build on it
When I first got this years ago I was very out of shape, could only do the leg movements, no arms and had to sit out the middle (Latin) section, in just a few weeks I was doing the entire tape including the arms.
Kathy is my ""go to"" workout instructor.",1395792000,,888,3.9775280898876404
7798023,5,1573309869,"I've been using Kathy Smith workout videos since the 1980's and she really is the best!  It's been awhile since I've worked out and I've gained a substantial amount of weight plus have some back problems.  I needed a video that wouldn't be too difficult for me and motivating enough to help me get back on track to getting fit.  This video is just that!  The ""marching"" is a great way to get your cardio and have fun doing it!  Don't get me wrong though, it may not be too difficult but it had me drenched in sweat when I was done!  Excellent workout!  :)",1332892800,2,555,4.228571428571429
7798024,5,1573309869,"Stephanie Herman's workouts make me feel lean and long. They combine dance moves, yoga breathing, pilates toning and even dancers' physical therapy exercises. I do Workout #1 ""Fitness through conscious movement"" when I don't feel too energetic.  It allows to work every body part without jumping around and exhaustion.  I save ""Esprit De Danse"" Workout #2 for my energetic days.  It is a fun, cardiovascular, dance-type workout.  And #3 ""Stretch and Feel it"" is a fantastic feel-good-all-over stretch routine, a tension-reliever, and a breathing exercise that can be done every day of the week.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1241481600,3,624,5.262626262626263
7798025,5,1573309869,"this is great product for a large auditorium. For former dancers and for people who wants to start to dance.
i like her fitness program on the floor - really amazing - with minimal efforts, maximum muscle relaxation and training.
i like all Stefanie Herman programs and presented some to friends.",1236902400,2,296,4.823529411764706
7798026,4,1573309869,"I love Stephanie Herman's Dance with Me Ballet. She has GREAT body awareness, which she should since she was a prima ballerina for over 10 years & has dance with many of the famous ballet dancers. They're originally on VHS & seem to be low budget copies. There is only one menu w/the 3 workout choices:

Fitness though conscious movement - 36 min Mixed music, mostly light, some nicer tempos. Stephanie on small black stage with a student. Very slow paced, easy ballet movements that work on fine tuning your movements to add grace, balance, coordination & body awareness. There are some kicks, but they are done slowly to work on balance alone, not power/cardio. This is for people who want to fine tune their ballet dancing or who need to work on coordination, rehabilitation, older generation, etc. This is a VERY easy workout, there will be no increased heart rate & may be found very boring.

Espirit De Danse - 40 min Same stage as her other 2 workouts, her & 2 female students, great world beat like like Engima music, Irish music, Olympic inspired music, jazzy music all to go perfectly with her movements. Still more about coordination, balance & being more graceful & body aware. More dancey & more normal paced type workout that uses the same movements from the Fitness though Conscious Movement, but also adds more leg lifts in different angles for balance & even a touch of easy moves from Irish dance & big band swing.
The most demanding of the 3, more a normal workout feel since movements change often & a lot of leg lifts & kicks. I felt more in balance, coordination doing it. The movements are repeated many times over a small amount of routines & got a bit boring, but they were easy to follow & did work to help my coordination & learned a few easy jazz, swing, Irish moves which was a nice bonus.
You don't really need to do her other workout to follow along. If you like to work on being more graceful balance/coordination with a lot of dance kicks, this is for you. If you get bored easily or have good balance & can kick forward, side & back w/o teetering, this is too easy for you. If you get bored easily, this also might not be for you.

Stretch & Feel it! - 37 min. basic good stretching, yoga, toning, balance, pilates to really stretch you out. She uses different music from classical to world beat. Some of the sound on my disk was a bit muffed here & there, but still good & even one time the music was louder then her mic. She is on a stage with 2 backup women, one doing modifications. There is some table, camel, leg lifts, fwd bends, leg stretches, modified push ups, etc. I felt much loser/freer in my joints after doing this, but not as much as her ""Dance with me Ballet"" which really helped my cure my tight joint problem for days like nothing else could, but definitely better the many stretching workouts & some yoga ones as well.

You can read more about her at her site muscleballet  (name of her first workout vhs)",1182297600,14,2959,4.452029520295203
7798027,5,1573309869,This workout video really works.  It really is a total body workout.  I had the video for about eight years before it wore out from constant use!  I tried to find it again in stores in the UK but had no success until I tried Amazon.  I was so excited when i saw it online.,1153958400,,272,3.890909090909091
7798028,5,1573309869,"As someone who has been up and down and up and down on the scale and in consistent workouts, I have to say I love this tape!  Kathy Smith gives you a great 30 minute workout with a warm up, exercise and cool down.  What I like about this tape is that in 30 minutes, you really have put in some energy and exercise.  In each segment, you will also find a start up, a moving fast segment and then a bit of a pull back (breather) before moving on to the next segment.  This name of the tape ""March to Fitness"" should give you a clue.  This tape is all about exercising that ties to a walking/marching move.  It works well for beginners and intermediate fitness levels.  Advanced fitness users may find it a bit slow, but you can always modify the moves or do this tape along with some other form of exercise.  For those of you with little time in the morning, this is a great way to start the day.",1153872000,,894,4.097701149425287
