7875521,4,6304652879,"pretty good for a ""B"" movie! Entertaining, sometimes sexy, and the rivalry is absolutely delicious!! Defiantly worth the few bucks to rent the movie, and the story is good enough to keep you interested as well. I would definatly recommend this movie to any movie buffs who are in to ""B"" movies!!!",1484784000,2,296,4.711538461538462
7875522,2,6304652879,It's a terrible early 90s Troma movie with awful characters and a nonsense plot; you know exactly what you're getting going in.,1483574400,,127,4.818181818181818

7875525,5,6304652879,"I watched this for ""s***ty movie sunday"" tradition.  And, man did it hit the nail on the head.  Terrible script, acting, early 90s special effects, with the added surprise of egg magic.  There were so many options and debates for Halloween costumes.  For the first 45 minutes we still couldn't determine if we were watching softcore porn, you could cut the sexual tension with a spoon.  5 stars for egg magic.  5 stars for costumes.  5 stars for the line ""he tried to shake hands with lightning and lost"".

Watch this movie if you plan on making fun of it or making a drinking game out of it.",1476748800,3,592,4.416666666666667
