801201,5,6304179073,"I've watched ABFAB numerous times on the television and I've also rented the complete collection and had an ""ABFAB NIGHT"" with a few friends. We bought some Boli and Stoli and dressed as our favorite  characters. It was a blast. I'm biting the bullet and spending the money to  own all seven videos. It will be Absolutely Worth The Money!

801202,4,6304179073,"Wow. I've had a good read of the reviews and I'm very flattered to see that America (and other countries) have such a high view on British humour. Must have been all those Carry on movies.
For those of you unitiated, Ab  Fab was developed from a two minute sketch on French and Saunders (much  loved bizarre comedy duo, intrinsically linked with most modern humour in  the UK). It grew into this beast, starring some of the cream of British.  Jane Horrocks is the master of drama (playing an inane secretary?!?), June  Whitfield from the older generation of comedy, Joanna Lumley may she always  be god, Julia Swahala my particular favourite as the daughter - she has  been in many award winning drama series over here.
The comedy is non stop  on occasion - it did get a bit repetitive towards the last series (hence it  wasn't very popular and may have resulted in it's own demise), but how far  could you have gone on such a simple set up?
I'd recommend getting the  first series. Once you are addicted and want more, venture into the second  series. If you think that you need some more, go for the third series. That  should fill you up.",926380800,4,1141,4.480582524271845
801203,5,6304179073,"AbFab is downright hilarious--once addicted, you can't get enough.  The writing is witty and is  delivered with the sharpest of tongues.  This and Fawlty Towers are some of the most articulate, uproariously funny moments  in comedy I have ever had the pleasure to watch and watch and watch...",923529600,,292,5.020833333333333
801204,2,6304179073,"Am I the only person on the planet who found this show to be painfully unfunny?  I'm ordinarily very much into British comedy, but this does very little for me.  It's just...not funny.  Okay, it has the odd moment of  levity, but it's really not enough, and the characters are less than  appealing as well, so it doesn't even work very well in that regard.  Hmph...I suppose its very lack of humour is the reason it's so popular here  in the U.S.  The American sense of humour has never been exactly sharp,  after all, based on the garbage that passes for situation comedy made over  here.",916790400,,589,4.471698113207547
801205,5,6304179073,"I first caught an episode of Absolutely fabulous about 5 years ago. This is probably the funniest comedy I have ever seen in my life. I usually don't purchase tapes, as once you've seen the movie and caught it on TV,  that's usually enough...but this is different. I have to admit that I've  watched these tapes over and over again, and they just get funnier!  Jennifer Saunders is an extremely talented woman when it comes to her  writing and acting skills here. The cast and characters are perfect, which  makes it all work so well. I understand there were plans to recreate this  series in America...I don't even think they should try as it would never  come across the same. The only unfortunate thing about this series is that  they only made 18 episodes. I would love to see more!",911606400,6,786,4.564285714285714
801206,5,6304179073,"I have this collection of TV episodes and I watch them weekly, for the past 2-years!  Addicted, maybe, but as a comedy writer myself I just can't get enough of Jennifer Saunders style of comedy.  She's truly Absolutely  Fabulous!  Where does she come up with all those lines?  And, those facial  expressions are so great and funny too.  Watch these sitcoms and you'll see  why our American actors just don't know what comedy truly is all about.  You can't go wrong buying this entire collection.  The sound and video  quality is very good, not to mention the hours of laughs.  The jokes just  don't stop.  Highly recommended!",911260800,,625,4.719626168224299
801207,5,6304179073,"I got this set for my birthday.  My partner knew I would love it, and I  did.  I had taped all of the episodes, but this is better, you get to hear  the censored parts.  And there are no commercials!!  END",905472000,,205,3.8780487804878048
801480,5,6304179073,"These two would NOT be my best friends! Ah, but isn't it fun to watch them? I'm glad to say I don't really know anyone who reminds me in the least of Eddie and Patsy. But I love to watch again and again the awful mess they make of their lives -- if only to make me think how much better I've done with mine! Jennifer and Joanna are absolutely perfect as these two totally dysfunctional human beings. Eddie's ever-so-patient daughter is played subtly and warmly. And if you like these shows, you might also like ""Bridget Jones's Diary.""",972691200,6,535,4.414141414141414
801481,5,6304179073,"Absolutley Fabulous is undoubtedly one of the very, very best British sitcoms. Every episode is hilarious and it started a nation crying out ""sweetie darling"". The pairing of Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley is priceless! These form a hilariously over the top duo who are  both in the fashion industry but do very little work and mainly leave it up to the incompentent and very dizzy Bubbles (played brilliantly by the talented Jane Horrocks) to do all the work even though she makes a shambles out of it most of the time. Theres also Saffron (perfectly played by Julia Sawalha) who is Edinas' poor, put upon daughter and comedy veteran June Whitfield as Edinas' batty mother. This is certainly a big highlight in the career of  the enormously talented writer and actress Jennifer Saunders. All of these 18 episodes are classics, made instantly memroable by its sharp, witty diaogue and magnificent comic playing. Its intersting to see Joanna Lumley escape her usual aristocratic image and play foul mouthed, chain smoking Patsy Stone. Saunders and Lumley have masterminded that essential comic delivery and timing brilliantly. It really iis impossible to select a favourite episode but could say that amongst the best are POOR (series two) when Edina and Patsy are arrested for drunk driving. One of the funniest scenes to take place in this episode is when Eddy and Pats are holding up traffic. A lady presses the car horn continually to which they jump out the car and go up to the car the lady is in and start hurling abuse at her. Classic stuff. Other excellent episodes include where they go off to Morroco to promote Edinas new business venture, Pop specs. An episode titled DoorHandle (series three) is where they travel all the way to New York in search of a new, hip, door handle for Edinas living room. FIRE is a great one when Eddy, Pats and Saffron are locked in a room together and they all reveal there darkest secrets. The quality in all three series' never once falters. A CLASSIC! HILARIOUS! A COMIC MASTERPIECE! Excellent comic playing and a hilarious, rollercoaster dialogue. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!",970963200,20,2127,4.922005571030641
801482,5,6304179073,"This is not a review, but a response to some of the other reviews out  there.  Ab Fab has a DVD release date! It will be available in the UK from  mid November on DVD (only region 2 coding, though).
Keep up the pressure  and a zone 1 (USA) version will not be far behind.",968803200,4,271,3.8727272727272726
801483,5,6304179073,"I first saw this show in 1993, and I was hooked, it was the second episode called , 'Fat', by the time Edina was having her lips filled with so much collogan youd fit a small country onto it, I was hooked for life, i then  preceeded to tape the rest of teh season.  I have brought all 6 normal  videos and 2 other misc. vids over the years, and I have watched them  hundreds of times, there is seriously no tiring of these decrepit old  witches as they really are so much fun, and they just don't give a s#*t.  the show has been played around 20 times (repeats of series) on Aus tv  since conception and I have hooked all my friends, just for the fact you  can laugh like you never have and you can laugh at yourself.  this show  portrays capitialism satire at its best, the funny outcome of it really was  about the U.S's uproaring of airing the show in the first place.  the only  downfall was Patsy's and Edina's appearence on 'Roseanne'.  the acting is  flawless, the scripts perfect and the laughs so fast you need to come up  for air.",959212800,,1040,4.2030456852791875

The art of the comedy sitcom in the US is lost.  All of  our shows are just more mounds of crap centered around commercial breaks.  The UK has once again produced some of the finest material ever.",939427200,,358,4.53125
801488,5,6304179073,"Well... the Good British Folks have done it again! EXCELLENT COMEDY.. WONDERFULL characters.. a bit of off-side humour (even comprehensible to us Americans... no translation necessary, on other words)....
ABFAB has the  pure ""balls"" to do what what most American comedies (read:  sitcoms) fail to do. This wonderful series simply presents the irony of a  disfunctional family, no excuses necessary nor required!
To sum it up:  LAUGH AT YOURSELF! LAUGH AT YOUR FAMILY! and just maybe... JUST MAYBE...  get a grip on the snafus of life!
It isn't too much to ask, is it?

As far as the comedy goes I used to Enjoy British humor, but this set didn't turn me on at all. It just seemed to me that the laughing responses were 'canned' and slipped into the program in different places. In one scene the laughter lasted longer than the scene took place. I sampled a few of the tapes but found them Not to be enjoyable so am dumping the set to my local thrift store.",1425859200,,514,4.099009900990099

7863851,5,6304179073,"These beautifully funny shows rival the old screwball comedies of the 1930's & '40's for roll-on-the-ground laughing madness. In fact, the old and rarely seen adjective ""madcap"" describes the shows perfectly.
Edina Monsoon is a self-absorbed slacker who lives high by ripping off her ex-husbands. She and her friend Patsy Stone get into almost as many misadventures as they do bottles of vodka. Saffy, Edina's long-suffering, introverted daughter provides the foil for the madness.
Jennifer Saunders has talent coming out of her ears; not only does she perform pratfalls and other physical comedy without the help of a stand-in, but her non-stop delivery would be funny if were just reading the phone book. As it is, the scripts are works of art, much funnier than Seinfeld, funnier than Monty Python even.
The only problem with these shows is that you can't eat while watching them, because you can't eat while laughing unceasingly.",1063670400,3,933,5.144736842105263

7863854,5,6304179073,"Absolutely Fabulous is one of my favorite British sitcoms.  It is totally outrageous--plots built around two self-absorbed women with alcohol and drug problems!  It would never fly on American TV, but I'm glad the BBC takes more chances.  The supporting characters are fun, as well.  Eddy's mother is actually a lot more wise than her seeming daffy personality lets on; Bubbles is hopelessly incompetant as a secretary; and the women who work at the fashion magazine (esp. the one with the heavy Cockney accent) are a scream.  I also love seeing Ruby Wax (a writer on the show) and Mo Gaffney playing various wacky Americans.  And those catty lines!  Worth double the price of admission!",1008806400,,687,4.921739130434783

Its the ultimate in TV entertainment!!",1006387200,,247,4.391304347826087
7863856,5,6304179073,"I cannot pin down my reasons for enjoying AbFab as much as I do; I just know that I can watch the episodes again and again and never tire of the over-the-top humor. Jennifer Saunders has captured the 70's and the 90's with her broad physical comedy as well as with sarcastic statements which express some of womens' deepest fears. One of my favorite moments occurs when Edina responds to Saffie's question as to why Patsie's extremely thin, aging and caustic sister can continually get away with flinging insulting sarcasm toward her. As though it is the answer to every question pertaining to bad behavior, her mother replies ""Because she's thin!""
Another of my favorites is FRANCE. After bumbling their way to the wrong vacation house, drowning in wine and unable to speak any French whatsoever, Eddie and Patsy call Saffie and Bubble to come from England to bring food and direction to their vacation. In the end they are saved by the air-headed Bubble whom, it turns out, speaks perfect French.
There are too many notable moments to list here. Suffice it to say that there never was and may never again be such mahem or such hilarity in a British comedy series . I only wish that Ms. Saunders would make more episodes where you are free to park your superego at the door and sit back and laugh till you cry. So tuck your cell phone in your tiny purse, put on your zebra coat, pour yourself a voddie,light up a fag and enjoy.",984182400,,1428,4.560311284046692
