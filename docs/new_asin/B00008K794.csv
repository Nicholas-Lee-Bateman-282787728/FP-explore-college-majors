7984766,5,B00008K794,"BRIGITTE BARDOT as a NUN?  Bit of a stretch, but as Kay Parker (porn star of ""Taboo"" , the original) once told me ""but dear you must remember..."" (when I asked her if she believed in incest) ...""I AM an actress, I am acting in this movie""! Draw your own conclusions!",1462924800,,266,4.215686274509804
7984767,4,B00008K794,"This film is in French with English subtitles.  The film is rather silly.  Brigitte Bardot plays a novice nun who runs away when the nuns are having an outing at the beach.  She makes her way to Paris where she's befriended by a hooker played by Annie Girardot.  (Annie if famous in France, but not here in the US.)  They have various adventures.  The reason I bought the film is for the beach scene where Annie and Brigitte are at the beach wearing loose-knit bras making their breasts visible.  This alone makes the film worthwhile.",1376524800,,534,4.557894736842106
7984768,4,B00008K794,"Annie Girardot est parfaite dans son rle de prostitu, drle, lectrique, humaine, une rouspteuse au coeur d'or. Brigitte Bardot, toujours la mme, est peu crdible en nave novice. Miss Girardot FAIT le film.",1326931200,3,203,5.181818181818182
7984769,3,B00008K794,I was excited to see another Bardot film out on DVD and ordered this before it was released. Though rather entertaining and with a stunning Bardot in her mid 30's looking at her most beautiful self I can't help wondering if it could have been better. The ingredients were certainly there : an alluring Bardot and the great comedian in Annie Girardot. To be fair it was enjoyable enough but it just lacked that extra punch that would have made it better.,1172707200,4,453,4.536585365853658
7984770,4,B00008K794,"This Bardot vehicle boasts an excellent transfer to DVD. BB is in fine comedic form, and Annie Girardot is altogether convincing in her ""straight"" role as a serious prostitute. The best moments include Brigitte (Agnes) learning the ""tricks"" of the trade, being followed everywhere by the scroungy mutt she has adopted, and trying to get up the courage to kill a stolen chicken for dinner. Guaranteed to make you laugh.

Although BB is very sexy in her street clothes and nurse's uniform (don't ask), you won't find any nudity in this film---unless you count a see-thru bra worn at the beach.

This film was released in 1970, so BB is 36 years old and is at the peak of her sexual charm and alluring beauty (she is showing her age three years later in ""Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman;"" on the bright side, she is also showing a lot more skin). My favorite BB films are still ""Please Not Now!"" and ""Plucking the Daisy"" (in that order), but I'm definitely pleased to have ""Les Novices"" in my collection of 12 BB films. By the way, my least favorite is ""Les Femmes.""

As usual Brigitte speaks French clearly enough and slowly enough for any American who understands French to understand. Annie, on the other hand, speaks French so rapidly that I had to glance at the subtitles now and then to catch what she was saying. Unfortunately, the subtitles are not all that accurate. They are correctly spelled, however.

I give ""Les Novices"" 4 stars because it's a well made film, because it has both comedic and poignant moments, because it is creative in its storyline, and because BB is such a pleasure to watch. You'll love it when she winks!",1080691200,14,1642,4.574829931972789
7984771,4,B00008K794,"Brigitte Bardot plays an innocent nun Agnes, who escapes from the convent and ending to Parish with a [prostitute]-playing Annie Girardot. This Guy Gasarel's film has a some problems at a time of filming-but anyway ,result seems very good and fun. BB shows that she can be brilliant comedienne as she wants-and Annie Girardot has a soul of all [prostitutes]of the world!.
  When those women try to get that old-proffession job, there is meny enjoyable moments with ladys at a Parish nights-when novice is a real novice as a new job. Brigitte bardot's acting has a clamour and the rhytm of comedy. It is perfect contrast with opposite Annie Girardot's stone-hearth professional. And she will chance...I don't tell the ending-but I'm shure you'l suprise. This DVD earns special thanks for it's original frens dialogue-beautiful color and sharp picture-also a art of case is fine and not so over-sexy packing as BB's films usually.",1067817600,5,928,5.0588235294117645
