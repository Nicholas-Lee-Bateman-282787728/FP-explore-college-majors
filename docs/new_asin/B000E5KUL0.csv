2494050,5,B000E5KUL0,This movie is a great thrill for the whole family.  Though it is a cartoon it even holds Mom's interest.  The pictures are surprisingly good.,1231804800,,141,4.6
2494051,4,B000E5KUL0,"If you claim to be a G-Fan and don't have this in your library, you are behind.  These animated adventures of the American ""Godzi"" are pretty good.

They appear to be produced by the same team that did the ""Men In Black"" series with sharp animation and interesting storylines.  I particularly love the monster designs.

If the rest of the series makes it to DVD, I will gladly add them to my growing library of Godzilla lore.",1178928000,2,425,4.48051948051948
