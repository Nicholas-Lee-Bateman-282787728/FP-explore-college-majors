8326622,5,B001NF6T06,"I have watched this DVD numerous times and am absolutely intrigued by the ideas and innovations that are demonstrated. Having lived through a 5 year drought, I discovered that  one can implement water conservation in the home without suffering any deprivation. It begins with an awareness of where and how water is wasted and  changing bad habits. Our drought is over and water tables are back to normal but I will continue to be frugal with my water usage and have also installed a gray water system. I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn how to make a difference with how our resources are used.",1431734400,,609,4.62962962962963
8326623,3,B001NF6T06,This dvd was okay. I purchased it by mistake...I was looking for garden shows. I hope Amazon considers broadening its selection of garden \ landscape resources. There are a few patrons who would enjoy a greater selection to help improve our means of beautifying the land.,1370476800,,271,4.913043478260869
