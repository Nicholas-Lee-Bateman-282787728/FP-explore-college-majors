8708552,4,B000AEE4NK,"Man of the East with Terrence Hill starring is very entertaining and lovely movie. It somehow mantains a romantism of the western movies with humor in well balanced bland. The plot is simple - ""boss"" of a small 4 heads gang of desperates dies and in his testament he demised his only son to them with one wish - to turn him into THE MAN.

The only problem is that son of his is a nobleman just arriving to The Wild West after finishing the studies on a well know British University. His humanistic ideals somehow clash with the Wild West reality, but love toward beautifull young lady makes him realise that fulfilling his father wish is the only way how their love can be mantained.

It is simple ploted, direct story with nice and easy to read characters which speaks about dreams, love, friendship and some basic life trues in its own funny way. Do not forget that movie is from 1972 has one goal - to serve humor gently througout one and half hour. FOr most of people I know it was fun and they reamember it for years. Ready for fun? This is the movie definitelly worth seeing.",1252800000,2,1081,4.373134328358209
