Not sure why amazon isn't fixing this.",1504051200,,289,3.8983050847457625
7804584,5,6300186032,"The adaptation of Mark Twain's book ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" to the screen left in the fun parts of the story and took out all the point of the book. The book contains many lessons and thoughts that did not make it into the movie; one of the subjects is that the amount of money you make is only relevant to the price of a loaf of bread. However the movie is fun to watch and can be quite funny.

An auto mechanic and inventor Hank (Bing Crosby) is transported back to A.D. 528 with his almanac. After realizing where he is, he uses his wits and knowledge of the future to survive. He has many adventures. He helps a King (Cedric Hardwicke) to understand his people, overcomes a tyrant and finds a loyal friend (William Bendix). Naturally being Bing there is music and incantations to blot out the sun. Eventually there is true love Alisande (Rhonda Fleming). The movie leaves the questions: Will Hank settles down with his love or will he be dispatched with one of his own inventions?

Attached to this film is a second ""the Emperor Waltz""
Another Billy Wilder film

Sort of Bing Crosby formula film. Acted with Bing Crosby, Joan Fontaine, Roland Culver, Lucile Watson, Richard Haydn, and Sig Ruman. Filming Location is Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada.

Virgil Smith (Bing Crosby), traveling gramophone salesman has a special customer in mind, Emperor Franz Joseph (Richard Haydn). On the way, his purpose is mistaken, correcting that he has a politically improper love interest with Austrian Countess Johanna Augusta Franziska (Joan Fontaine). In addition, they both fall in love with a little fuzzy pooch. Who gets the girl? Who gets the pooch? Who knew the plot before it even started",1502668800,2,1715,4.764309764309765
7804585,5,6300186032,"This film, ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, is so very romantic and charming.  It is a great escape movie into a wonderful land of Camelot, that makes oyu bleieve it could really be.  Rhonda Fleming and BIng Crosby are both wonderful in it and a very romantic and beautiful couple.  The song ""Once and for Always,"" is one of th elovliest an dmost heartfelt songs ever.  It's a must see film for the entire family, an done never tires of watching it.  Each time of viewing it is like the first time.  Bing has some catchy tunes and is great as Hank the machanic.  It has a charm and old fashion romance that is so often lacking in today's films.",1052006400,8,657,4.336065573770492
7804586,4,6300186032,"Amidst the current state of world affairs, which usually concern the Mideast, this is a couple hours of light entertainment. Bing Crosby provides romance, song, and humor. William Bendix in a support role adds some charm and humor as well. This film has done well over the years because of the good mix of characters and the excellent sets and costumes. It is well worth a look. I pre-ordered it on DVD to be delivered 3/4/03.",1029283200,3,426,4.618421052631579
7804587,5,6300186032,"Twain's grand fantasy is pleasing from every angle in this lavishly mounted production rich in color and songs. Crosby, at the height of his immense popularity is the Connecticut blacksmith knocked unconscious in a  wild rainstrorm and sent into another world, waking up in King Arthur's  Camelot. The quality of this Crosby version far outstrips previous ones with  it's gorgeous color and imaginitive sets. Rhonda Fleming is stunning as the  titian haired Alisande. The direction by Tay Garnett is excellent and the  film was very popular among the public upon it's release in 1949. A highly  recommended family film.",944611200,9,619,5.202020202020202
