7878626,5,6304870353,Watched it all in two days.  It was better that I could imagine with great photography.  Color was excellent.  Never a dull moment.,1397865600,,131,4.608695652173913
7878627,1,6304870353,"As with ALL of Madacy's productions, I found this to be, as one reviewer here said I might, BORING. I lived through the history of NASA presented in the DVD, and was expecting much more than a poor patchwork of stock footage, loosely connected by tepid narration.",1075766400,2,263,4.617021276595745
7878628,4,6304870353,"This DVD is a collection of NASA's orginal 'propoganda' films on the US manned space program. These are the films you may have seen during a science class in 1963-6 (presumably when your science teacher needed a  break).  A retrospective view from 1999 makes these films look low-tech and  corny, however for those who lived through these times they are a reminder  of the very different world view ('Free World') then about.  Anybody with a  serious interest of fondness of the early space age will value this DVD as  a collector.  For the rest of you, this DVD may be quite boring!  I,  however, am ordering the remainder of the set of five.",940118400,4,643,4.610619469026549
