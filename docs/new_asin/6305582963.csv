7893552,5,6305582963,"I love this film and wish that it would come out in DVD.  I saw it on television a number of years ago and have a VHS copy.  It's pretty timeless, most especially in times when a belief system is sorely needed.  It's even very comforting if you're remotely skeptical or fearful of ""the other side"".  Bruce Greenwood is absolutely wonderful and perfectly cast as Zachariah, an angel of sorts; his job is to meet the newly deceased and accompany them to the other side.  Unfortunately, he's not very dedicated and a tad careless to his task so misses his appointment wherein the higher-ups decide to send him to earth to learn to realize the consequences of his carelessness.  You've GOT to see Greenwood when he first arrives in a place where sight, smell, taste, and touch are completely new to him.  He is a master actor, but never more so than in scenes where only his facial expressions and body language tell us everything we need to know.  It is a lovely story; the frustration of his supervisor played beautifully by Ossie Davis, his relationship with the sweet widow played by Melissa Gilbert, and especially his relationship with her best friend suffering from the recurrence of a deadly disease.  His scenes with her in her sickbed will have you grabbing for tissue or, in a pinch, your shirtsleeves.  This is a must-see movie, it will warm your heart.  It NEEDS TO BE OUT ON DVD.",1248048000,,1389,4.605691056910569
7893553,5,6305582963,"This is such a beautiful story!  I do so wish it would come out on DVD.  I have only seen it on television in the past.  Bruce Greenwood is an angel who comes to earth and falls in love with Melissa Gilbert.  Bruce is a soul collector (one of several).  He retrieves the souls of those who die and takes them to Heaven.  He is a very kind and loving spirit.  Melissa is a widow.  Of course, there is more to the story.  You always have the little twists and turns.  It's a beautiful, heartwarming show.  There is also a part where someone dies and the soul collector turns the sadness into joy.  For those who believe in angels and believe that death is NOT the end . . .

Namaste'

Note that when I last checked, whatever they are showing here is not the story I rated.  Something fowled up",1236297600,,791,4.145695364238411
