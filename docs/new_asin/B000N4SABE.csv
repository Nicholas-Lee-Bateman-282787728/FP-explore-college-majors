This set doesn't have the Lon Chaney episode (which is commonly available, but only in incomplete versions).  The Christmas episode presented here is a little murkier than on other sets.

This information is what's actually on the set, which differs slightly from the description on the back of the box, which omits an episode, and lists bloopers that aren't anywhere to be found.  In any case, this is a good collection for any Abbott & Costello to add to their shelf, at least until a complete set ever gets released.",1208217600,41,2204,4.748031496062992
