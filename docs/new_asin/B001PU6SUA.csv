Overall Excellent!!!

3761262,4,B001PU6SUA,"When I bought this title I wanted to hear DiDonato's performance. Yes, she is excellent: beautiful voice, excellent technique, good acting. The other main star was less convincing for me: Juan Diego Florez is good, but his acting skills are not fitting entirely to the style of the production, sometimes he is wooden (especially when compared to the other cast members). The direction is clear and full of ideas, the director, Joan Font has a strong view on the opera and he is able to show it with colorful costumes and well-designed set. The conductor is familiar with the Rossini style, however, he uses sometimes very slow tempi which are at least strange a bit, and not always convincing.
If you compare this to the other versions available on the market, it is worth buying beacuse of DiDonato perfect performance and the stunning production. Not a classic (like Ponelle's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rossini-La-Cenerentola-Frederica-von-Stade-Francisco-Araiza-Paolo-Montarsolo-Claudio-Desderi-Laura-Zannini-Claudio-Abbado/dp/B000A3VTT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rossini - La Cenerentola / Frederica von Stade, Francisco Araiza, Paolo Montarsolo, Claudio Desderi, Laura Zannini, Claudio Abbado</a>), not a bravura (like Bartoli's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rossini-La-Cenerentola/dp/B00005BEYB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rossini - La Cenerentola</a>).

3761263,2,B001PU6SUA,"Here we have a Decca DVD of the Liceu production that was scheduled to be released in Blu-ray but was canceled. What we are left with here is the standard DVD version which I will compare with another Decca standard DVD version, that of the Huston Grand Opera with Cecilia Bartoli.

Right from the start it s obvious that the liceu production has a threadbare stringy sound:
The overture does not have that magical sound that will set our mood into the magic world of the story and most annoying is the cymbal clashes sonic that are akin to a distorted sneeze.
In contrast to this, the sonic of Decca release of the Huston Grand Opera is much more robust, dynamic and full-bodied, and that sound quality carries itself through the whole recording (speaking of the sonic quality of both productions).
Moreover, the sonic quality of this Liceu production has the characteristic of being cut and pasted, one sound-field piece upon the other piece, without depth perspective and no `who is bigger than the other': this is also obvious with the singing voices: the audio recording does not differentiate between who singles softer and who sings more with a full-throat - that, is courtesy of the multi microphones used throughout and the use of personnel microphones being glued to the singer's head or shoulders.
With the Huston production this sonic difference is very obvious: more `breathe' to the sound, more sweetness and more dynamics there.

As for the singers:
The entrance of Cecilia Bartoli for the Houston production is at once `a canon-shot' of an impression:
The voice and the acting are show stoppers and this Lady Bartoli knows her tricks:
The voice and the acting are all integrated: The facial mimic, the sad or smart gaze of the eyes, the gestures, the body-language, the manner in which this Cenerentola sings the repetition of ""Una volta"" tune at her sisters just to tease them...
And take this short passage for an example, when Cenerentola goes down the staircase and is surprised by the `intruder' (the price); Bartoli utters a scream of fear and with it at the same time the tray she carries smashes to the floor (and this, with true sound of an object being smashed...) with Didonato this instance is glossed over, reduced to slightly less of a surprise not very impressive, as if she spares her vocal cords right there...
And there are many other instances where DiDonato acting is lacking:
The scene where Cenerentola begs her step-father to take her to the ball: Bartili crawls on the floor attaching herself to his leg begging and get kicked, than continues to crawl on the floor clinging to her broom...while here, DiDonato just caresses her father's hand begging - not that convincing, not that effective and not acting...and there are many more instances as such.

Vocally, although Joyce DiDonato's mezzo-soprano voice is full-bodied and gets the top to bottom notes convincingly, in pitch, in hue and with an almost `full-swing' - something is missing: (the humor?) Would it be that the shading of her voice, retracting it to pianissimo, tossing it around from a whisper `sotto-voce' to the forte and with the Italian pronunciation are all beyond her artistic capacity?
(Note: We sure miss Jennifer Larmore in this roll, although Larmore too would have gotten a stiff competition from Bartoli here).
Personally, and in the past, I was suspicious of Cecilia Bartoli's ability to sustain legato passages, taking into account her racing coloratura speed and voice tessitura as a rare Mezzo-soprano coloratura; all that suspicious came to rest and fade away when seeing and listening to her performance ""The Barcelona concert"" and the ""Cecilia Bartoli Live in Italy"" (where amazingly her vocal agility and suppleness encompass even the soprano high C note - and with a vengeance - at the end of the Rossini ""Riedi al soglio"" area !!!...
I have named these two Cecilia Bartoli' DVDs for the benefit of those who are interested in Belcanto and for those who are interested in an exceptionally cultured voice).
Make no mistake: DiDonato possess a nice balanced voice overall, but it is not something which is endowed with exceptional mezzo qualities.

The tenor Diego Florez has Don Ramiro (the Prince) roll under his knee and his `Tenorino' voice is a rarity - he is considered to be THE Rossini/Donizetti tenorino of our time; This young man Florez, has in the past set a milestone when appearing in the Barber of Seville (Blu-ray DVD version - Teatro-Real, Madrid) and also in Donizetti Don Pasquale for the Opernhause Zurich, and twice for Donizetti Filled du Regiment; with The Royal Opera house, and in the Teatro Carlo Felice di Geneva production - and yet, he is surpassed here in the roll of Don Ramiro by Raul Gimenez for the Huston production. Raul Gimenez (high-tenor) voice is more ""romantic"", more expressive, has a soave lyric quality and the limpid coloratura and warmth to match.

The other rolls:
The Don Magnifico (step-father to Cenerentola) buffo bass Enzo Dara, for the Huston Opera, has a more dominant, full bass voice with which he presents the roll full of humor, gestures, facial expressions and stage presence - while Bruno de Simone in that roll for the Liceu, has a meager voice, meager stage presence (he starts with a real un-warm-voice that gets a tad better with the passing of time on the stage but still, he can not command the presence this roll asks for).

The two soprano (step-sisters to Cenerentola) do their best to sing and act but their voices does not mix well together and both lack in fineness the two sisters in this roll has for the Huston production.

All in all - this is a mild Rossini Cenerentola we are presented here with this Decca Teatre Liceu.

This Liceu production colorful staging, Walt-Disney sorts of concept for the costumes, the two dimensional `cartoon-features' and the dcor, and with the participation of the six mice figures - if made available in an abridge version, and with an added simple narration of Cinderella's story  - might make a nice Christmas gift for children, as an entry to the young into the world of opera.
As things are right now, Decca decision to abandon the release of this DVD in the more costly Blu-ray version is, to my opinion, a very justified one.",1263340800,11,6267,4.860486891385768
3761264,5,B001PU6SUA,"Here is my review reprinted from Wholenote Magazine,February 2010 issue under their Copyright.

  Such a pleasure to enjoy this completely original, very imaginative and colourful performance of the 24 year old Rossini's comic masterpiece completed under great pressure in a few weeks for the carnival season of 1817.  Original indeed.  What an inspired idea to bring in the `Comediants', a group of itinerant players who give outdoor impromptu performances all over Catalonia much like in the Middle Ages.  The overall effect is the work of Joan Fonts (director) and it's like a comic book fairy tale with strong primary colours that are everchanging with mirrors and the magic of backlighting.  One hilarious feature is a group of anthropomorphic rats constantly moving around in the background following and silently commenting on the action.

  And it's a musical triumph as well.  The two principals, Joyce diDonato and Juan Diego Florez are top of the line today in terms of bel canto singing.  American mezzo DiDonato easily conquers the fierce technical demands of Rossini fioraturas but is also capable of pathos and introspection to move audiences with the warmth of her voice. Juan Diego Florez's voice is spectacular in the high flying tessitura and he throws out the high C's with the greatest of ease. After his aria in the second act Si, ritrovarla, io giuro the audience goes simply hysterical.
There is no disappointment in the three supporting baritone/basso roles either. One is better than the other.  Perhaps veteran Italian basso Bruno de Simone (Don Magnifico) stands out
in his characterization, irresistible comedy and bravura Rossinian pattering, a feature that Arthur Sullivan adopted later into his English operettas.

  Indiana born conductor Patrick Sommers is fast becoming a force to reckon with especially in bel canto repertoire. His unerring beat of metronomic precision and graceful and stylish tempos, sometimes at lightning speed, contribute to an outstandingly memorable evening. .",1261612800,3,2020,5.344936708860759
3761265,3,B001PU6SUA,"Let me first say that I fully agree with the reviewer above, Mr. Dollinger, that the singing is first rate among the two main protaganists, Signor Florez and Signorina Didonato. I myself was put off by the staging which, unfortunately, is among the common type of euro-trash that is abundant in opera today. Why can't we just let the music and poetry speak for itself? Maybe I'm an old fashioned purist when it comes to operatic staging but what would one think if ""South Pacific"" was staged on the moon or in the 13th century? I mean...how many times does the stage director have to subjegate the art to their own ""reinterpretation""?
 My main concern with this particular performance, though, is the music and the conductor Patrick Summers. From the first few bars of the overture, and throughout the opera, in numerous places in the score - especially in the tutti parts - the cymbals are used almost without rest. You can take ""L'Italiana in Algeri"", ""Il Turco in Italia"" and even Mozart's ""Abduction from the Harem"" and combine all the parts that were actually written for cymbals(an instrument not commonly used in the orchestra at the time that this opera was composed...and only used for an ""oriental"" effect)and it wouldn't add up to the amount of times it is employed in this performance. It was a real distraction to me and I really felt myself cringing as this wonderful score unfolded and with every accent in the music there was another ""clang!!"". It reminded me of Sir Thomas Beecham's famous remark about the sound of the harpsichord being likened to the sound of two skeletons copulating on a metal roof!",1258329600,34,1620,4.765124555160142
3761266,4,B001PU6SUA,"When I first read that there was a Cenerentola in the pipeline with JDF and DiDonato I began anticipating its release. Subsequently there were some clips on YouTube which were disturbing--not the singing but the staging. When it arrived I played it immediately to see how it would compare with the Glyndebourne DVD. Well, my anticipation of the two leads was validated. In short they are superb both vocally, dramatically and physically. As good as the leads in the Glyndebourne are (Ruxandra Donose and Maxim Mirinov) and they are very good-- but better is clearly the enemy of the good.

There are two areas of criticism, however, that must be aired. The Liceu production is a joint effort of four (!) houses. Alas it is evocative of nothing in particular. Utilitarian, but nothing more. The production at Glyndebourne is traditional yet the production is directed by Peter Hall and it shows. The Liceu production aimed at a cartoon effect. They succeeded. A pity. I wonder how long this production will last. I can't imagine that it will have ""legs"". The costumes are exaggerated and ""day-glo"" colors are used throughout. Hall aimed at a much more realistic concept. Rossini wanted nothing ""magical"" and that is what Hall delivers. But Rossini delivered a different kind of magic: the music. Jurowski and the London Philharmonic deliver a wonderful performance, elegant spirited and glowing. While the Liceu pit band may not be the equivalent of the London Phil are a very good house orchestra and play very well for Summers--who has conducted this production in Texas.

In the Liceu production the remainder of the roles are cast from regular singers in the house. The Glyndebourne production is cast from strength and delivers better singers. This was a festival production and it shows. The Liceu singers are always adequate and sometime more, but in the end they have to yield to the English production, notably the Don Magnifico, sung by Luciano di Pasquale whose scrofulous appearance is matched by a wonderfully Italian buffo bass. When on stage he clearly dominates by virtue of physique and voice. His counterpart at the Liceu is both leaner of figure and voice.

But in the end we have to return to Juan Diego and DiDonato. They are charismatic stylish singers who never fail to deliver. Indeed the auditor is treated to some of the best Rossini singing in years. When they are on stage there is a frisson that is unmatched. Clearly theirs is a five star performance. It also has to noted that the Glndebourne performace is on Opus Arte and is very pricey although Amazon sellers probably offer a more attractive price.",1256947200,41,2632,4.910112359550562
8334706,4,B001PU6SUA,"The musicality was great, but I found the staging a bit distracting.  That is just a personal taste -- for another it might be a plus.

8334709,5,B001PU6SUA,"This is an excellent version of one of the greatest of all comic operas, featuring superb singing and orchestral playing.  And it's not just the two headliners; listen, for example, to the entrance of the stepsisters at the beginning of Act One.  Nevertheless, some viewers may find the staging problematic, with singers in clown-like costumes and sets featuring human-sized rodents.  Those seeking a more conventional production might want to consider the Houston Grand Opera DVD, also on Decca, with Cecilia Bartoli and Raul Jimenez.  Both sets are wonderful, but, for me, Joyce Didonato and Juan Diego Florez are slightly to be preferred.  Highly recommended.",1406937600,2,662,5.326923076923077

8334712,4,B001PU6SUA,"After reading the various reviews here, half of which are depressing and unduly critical (is there such a thing as a PERFECT opera production for heavens sake??) it was a relief to read at least one or two reviews that were really positive and could enter into the spirit of the opera. I found this opera fun and light and full of gaiety without losing its deeper meaning for those of us who care about such things.  The singing is marvelous - DiDonato is in her prime and is both a great actor and singer, and Florez more than makes the most of his limited role.  I just love the six rats making unspoken commentary in the background. The whole production is terrific and well worth the dollars if you are a DiDonato and/or Florez and/or Rossini fan.",1306713600,,751,4.434782608695652
