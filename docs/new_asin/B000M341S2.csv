2720797,4,B000M341S2,"George Lopez is absolutely hilarious, ever since I saw his comedy routine, ""Why you crying?"" I fell in love with his sense of humor!
George Lopez is a light-hearted, family friendly comedy that can easily appeal to all ages. The disfunctional relationship between George and his mom one of the funniest things about the show, George makes light of a rather sad and tramatic childhood relationship with his real life mother by writing it into the script as a kind of joke that is truely hilarious to watch. Benny Lopez is one of my favorite characters on the show next to George, and Angie's father.
The holiday episodes are always outrageously funny!
The actors work well together, and are easily believable as a real family.

This is a great collection of 3 DVDs containing the complete 1st & 2nd season of George Lopez, my only complaint being that the theme song, ""Low Rider"" doesn't appear in this collection, it is replaced instead by an annoying bass beat accompanied by George Lopez making some funny sounds such as, ""I know huh"" Funny the first time you hear it, but gets really annoying if you're watching more than one episode at once...

Overall Rating: 4.5 Stars

Please don't drop the ball with releasing the entire series on DVD as some other shows have had happen to them (Leave It To Beaver, The Bob Newhart Show, Simon and Simon).",1187136000,9,334,4.301587301587301

2720800,5,B000M341S2,This collection is a must have...the first and second seasons of GEORGE LOPEZ are a joy to watch.  His unique perspective and ability to bring humor to family life is wonderful. BRAVO,1184198400,2,183,4.71875
2720801,5,B000M341S2,"The George Lopez show is twenty first century family entertainment at its best. He is the Captain of the house, as long as you do not tell his Cubain born wife Angie. His kids respect him-NOT and his mother Benny...well lets say, she won't win mother of the year anytime soon

Lopez is part in the vein of Desi Arnaz and Part in the vein of Chico  (Freddie Prinze SR) of Chico & the Man. He is also the first comic to survive in TV as a latino, since Chico and the man. The humor is dry and rapid. Not just one liners, but heartfelt barbs of family life. Think Roseanne with more heart and better humor

One of my two favorite episodes is George not wanting to celebrate his birthday and his son Max following suit. The end of the episode (SPOILER)is George spending time with his childhood hero. I won't say who that
is, that would be a real spoiler. However the last 5 minutes (HINT) will be well KROFTED (note not mispelled) for the kid in all of us.

the second of my two episodes involves accident Amy (played by executive producer Sandra Bullock). She seems to have so much fun pratfalling and ending up in mishap after mishap, while George tries for a 30 day accident free shop.

So if you want family fun with a target on fun. This hits the bullseye on all accounts

2720802,5,B000M341S2,"I just finished watching the first two seasons.  I laughed so much.  There are 28 episodes, the first season being only 4 episodes long.  I really enjoyed how the show hit on real life issues but always with funny moments to keep it lighthearted.  Also the cast really works well together.  If you give the show a chance you will laugh and really enjoy it.  I have only watched these DVDs so I can't speak for the rest of the show, but I really enjoyed these first two seasons.  I highly recommend you buy/watch this DVD set.",1177977600,21,525,4.350515463917525
2720803,5,B000M341S2,"I am one of George's biggest Fans and I ordered this before it was even released.  I already received it and have watched it twice from start to finish.  As the seasons go by, it is sure to get funnier. I have not missed an episode since day 1. Get this and get his upcoming seasons as they are released!  George! Hit me up! It's HEXX!",1177632000,9,335,4.045454545454546
2720804,5,B000M341S2,"I am grateful that this show is finally out on DVD. This is hilarious. I have only been watching this show for about a year now so I am finally able to start watching from the beginning.

I picked up my copy of seasons 1 and 2 and will definately not regret it a minute.

Do yourself a favor and go pick this up",1176768000,8,311,3.84375
2720805,5,B000M341S2,"George Lopez, came along way until I Love Lucy hit the air. Before it was George Lopez, there was I Love Lucy.  Where Desi Arnaz broke barriers of Latino Entertainment.  There were a few latins nobody ever heard of T.V., Lynda Carter who played Wonder Woman she was half latin and half white, Mario Lopez who plays A.C. Slater in Saved By The Bell was a Latino-American, Alexis Bledel who played Rory Gilmore in the Gilmore was a latino chick she's part Argentinian and Mexican and Charisma Carpenter who played Cordelia Chase is part white and Mexican.  I never have to worry ethnic backgrounds for a while.  Constance Marie who plays George's Wife Angie, she's looks and acts more like George's Daughter than his wife.  I always thought Angie was his daughter, not his wife.  Constance Marie doesn't look or act latin, she looks like a white girl than a latin chick.  Constance Marie has the greatest resemblance of Penelope Cruz and Gilmore Girls Lauren Graham. Masiela Lusha who plays Carmen, she has the greatest resemblance of Alexis Bledel from the Gilmore Girls and Katie Holmes.  It must not be easy being George Lopez.",1170288000,6,1128,4.778350515463917
2720806,5,B000M341S2,"I cannot tell you how much I love this show.  It's so funny and under-rated.  George's humour is so dry and quick and he pulls it off amazingly.  I love the banter between him and his mother, and how he talks about his kids to his wife.

It's about time that this finally came to dvd.  I cannot wait to get my hands on it because I want to see it all again from the beginning.  Here in Australia we only get to see it during the early hours of the morning (I guess our networks don't know a good thing when they see it), so I'm also hoping to catch up on the episodes I might have missed, or they cut out of it.

For 8 episodes, one of the executive producers was Sandra Bullock and she's responsible for this fantastic show getting off the ground.  Do yourself a favour and pick this up when it's released.  It's so funny and enjoyable, you're bound to love it as much as I do.",1169856000,32,878,4.028901734104046

2720868,5,B000M341S2,"I really think that Belita Moreno (Benny Lopez) should have been awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy. She played George's mother, Benny. The sitcom itself is funny, timely, and unique. The first season was only six episodes so the second season includes a memorable ""Thanksgiving"" episode with Cheech Marin as a possible father. Other memorable characters include executive producer Sandra Bullock who played a klutzy colleague at the airplane factory where George and his mother, Benny, work together.

At George's home, he is married to the beautiful Constance Marie who played Angie Lopez and their two children, Carmen and Max. George's best friend is played brilliantly by Valento Rodriguez. Angie's parents live somewhere else and make a memorable Christmas appearance. Other memorable guest appearances include Lou Diamond Phillips (LaBamba) and Cristina.

There are two features like the mind of George Lopez and the gag reel. The series deserved a lot more respect when it was on the air. It was never recognized for social topics like bullying, sexuality, and relationships. George has his best memorable and funny moments with his mother, Benny. I never get tired of seeing Belita Moreno especially as Benny.",1482969600,,1252,5.318181818181818

I purchased this set and the Season 3 set to support the show and hopefully to help create a demand for future season releases. The only thing I found extremely disappointing was the replacing of ""Low Rider"" with that annoying new theme. It's awful. It's especially bad in the season 2 finale, where the band begins to play ""Low Rider,"" leading into the opening sequence. It doesn't flow at all with the goofy new theme song. Hopefully by the time season 4 comes around they can sort out the rights/money issues and get the original theme song back.",1427328000,,707,4.404580152671755

2721281,1,B000M341S2,"March 23, 2011

On last night's episode of ""Lopez Tonight"" a skit was performed featuring a priest who ran a religious-themed strip club, ""Bad Habits."" Among the dancers were two nuns in full habit and an altar boy.

Catholic League president Bill Donohue addressed this show today:

This isn't the first time George Lopez has gone after the Catholic clergy--last September he maligned gay priests on two occasions for the sexual abuse of minors. However, this time was different: he decided to throw nuns and altar boys into the mix.

The nuns (dressed in full habit, of course) were paraded out prancing around on stage and dancing suggestively; one of them even gave an audience member a lap dance. While watching the nuns dance, the priest announced to the audience that one of the nuns was making him reconsider his vow of celibacy. Is this juvenile display considered humor nowadays?

Of course Lopez couldn't just mock nuns; he had to throw in an altar boy. The altar boy entered the stage and removed his garments to reveal his scantily-clad body. This is the type of thing you could expect to hear in an 8th grade class room.

That a rabbi was featured as one of the dancers matters not. He was sandwiched between two stripping nuns and an altar boy at a club run by a priest. I think it's pretty clear who Lopez was gunning for.

Lopez's humor is more than inane--it is one more example of a comedian who wants to push the envelope at the expense of Catholics.

""This show has been like the family I didn't have growing up,"" Lopez said.

George Lopez - The Complete 1st & 2nd Seasons is a 4-disc (644 min.) set featuring the show's first 28 episodes (all 4 from Season One, plus all 24 from Season Two); Full Frame (1.33:1) video; English and Spanish Stereo audio; Spanish subtitles, plus the following Special Features: ""Inside the Comedic Mind"" - featurette explores what shapes George's comic outlook, according to George, his castmates and the show's creative personnel; and a Gag Reel - Hilarious outtakes and bloopers set to music. To this day, ABC's ""George Lopez"" remains one of my all-time favorite shows, and it looks and sounds great on DVD. Keep 'em coming, Warner Home Video!

2721366,5,B000M341S2,This is a great sitcom that will entertain the whole family.  I recomend this to anyone who likes comedy mixed with the everyday life of a suburban blue collared family.,1209081600,2,169,4.633333333333334
2721367,5,B000M341S2,"My son and I discovered the George Lopez Show about 6 months ago in reruns on Nick. We love it! The whole cast is great, but George and Benny's relationship and banter back and forth is hysterical! We just had to start collecting the DVD's of the different seasons so we could watch whenever we wanted. So far only the first and second season are available, but we are waiting for more!",1207785600,,386,4.375
2721368,5,B000M341S2,this product came right on time and was hilarious if you like latino comedy this is the item to buy!!!,1207699200,,102,4.15
2721369,5,B000M341S2,"this show is a RIOT! I definitely love it because:
- there is a blend of the cuban and (americanized) mexican cultures; it's a subtle but direct way of reminding people that not all hispanics/latinos are from the same country.
- the issues seem more real/modern and not necessarily sugar-coated and the family deals w/ them in a more unique and sometimes crazy way (ex: dyslexia; bedwetting; sex before 18; quinceaneras; job security; drinking; etc)
- the script seems much more original and not so mainstream/mass-produced. at least for me, the writing sounds fresh and definitely more original than other mainstream shows.

you may or may not agree, but at least check it out. :o)",1206316800,2,682,4.930434782608696

However, not only was the product received in excellent shape for enjoyment, as if bought at the mall in a bookstore, but also the time span of delivery was completely acceptable. Just disappointed in some of matter and views expressed via comedian.
Thanks much,

2721407,4,B000M341S2,Although one of the DVD's that we ordered from Amazon.com arrived scratched the kids could not stop watching it. Super funny.,1200182400,,125,5.0
2721408,2,B000M341S2,I received the George Lopez series 1 and 2 dvd's and there were 3 dvd's all together. One was disc 1 and the other two were disc 2. I do not know if there is supossed to be a disc 3 or another disc 2. Other then that it was ok and easy to order. I was happy to find it because I could not find it in any stores in my area. I hope I was not cheated out of some episodes.,1199577600,3,369,3.4578313253012047
2721409,5,B000M341S2,I think this is one of the most entertaining and funny TV sitcoms ever produced. The mixture of  George's quick wit and the talent of the rest of the supporting Actors combine to bring an honest humour rarely seen on TV. I can't wait for the next season to be released.,1199145600,,269,4.2745098039215685
2721410,5,B000M341S2,"I loved the the show from the beginning.  George Lopez really tells it like it is and much resembles my own family upbringing.  I hope they complete the series with the following seasons.  There is one flaw.  During each of the beginning credits, why was the song ""Low Rider"" by War taken out of the beginning credits and replaced with some weird moaning and groaning music.  Keep up the good work George!",1193616000,14,405,4.569444444444445

8166068,1,B000M341S2,"Was surprised (or maybe not) GL's show was still around to be seen.  I had seen some of his sketches that were sort of funny but this series.... Unbelievably crude, racist, sexist/misogynistic ""comedy."" The mother's character is appallingly nasty and ignorant.  Definitely not family fare.",1520812800,,289,5.4

8166074,5,B000M341S2,The George Lopez show is a true gem being one of the last television sitcom shows to come along during the 2000s to teach morals and family values the entire family could enjoy because of its clean humor.  There are a few situations in some episodes such as Benny's alcohol problems a parent may want to check for before allowing their children to watch but in my opinion I think the situations teach life's hard lessons exposing how the real world is.  The entire cast comes together flawlessly and each character shines through individually with personality.,1509235200,,560,4.822916666666667
