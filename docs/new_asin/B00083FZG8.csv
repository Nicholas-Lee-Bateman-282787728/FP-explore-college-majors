2257286,5,B00083FZG8,"The currently available B western movies of Tim McCoy are far and few in between. Texas Cyclone from Columbia is presently the best of the lot. This is remastered in high definition (whatever that means). For an early 30's film, the images are sharp and clear with nary a sign of deterioration so common among the other economical B western products. Tim McCoy fans are lucky to have this one. But this is essentially being marketed as an early John Wayne western. Duke was not lead man but a supporting character to McCoy. But that's marketing for you. Columbia should release more B westerns kept in their vaults. The two Charles Starret releases are moves in the right direction. Another good Tim McCoy copy is Ghost Patrol by Alpha. The other Alpha Tim McCoy releases strain the eyes. I still have to try the VCI Mc Coy movies though frankly, I was disappointed by  their Buck Jones releases which are not of the same high standards seen in Texas Cyclone.",1119398400,19,959,4.641176470588236
2257287,4,B00083FZG8,"This has got to be the best reproduction of a 30's movie of any kind that I've seen. They've done a wonderful job. The more of Tim McCoy I see, the more I like him. He's such an oddball, though quiet about it. Love the hat and the 8, or is it 9 shirtsleeve buttons in a row. It's a good B Western story. For an added bonus we have John Wayne as almost-the-Duke, and as a real delight, Walter Brennan as almost_Walter Brennan. It might seem expensive for an hour-long black and white B-western but when you consider the rediculous quality of some of the cheaper versions of these westerns out there, this is well worth it. I still buy those cheap ones anyway, since that's all we can get.
  I've changed this review, was 4 stars, now on second thought, I'm giving it 5 (though I can't seem to change the star rating).
  Please, please, please, we need more like this! More early Tim McCoy. Also:
-More early Tex Ritter, preferably not already out in 5 different versions unless they are of the quality of this Tim McCoy
-More early John Wayne, preferably not already out in 5 different versions unless they are of the quality of this Tim McCoy
-More early Buster Crabbe Billy the Kid
-More early Buck Jones
-More early Ken Maynard
-More early Roy Rogers
-More early Crash Corrigan

2257288,3,B00083FZG8,"I've always considered it very strange why Wayne's westerns of the 1930's are not given the same sort of revered status that other western stars like Hopalong Cassidy and Roy Rogers received. Sure they're B movies but so were the films by Cassidy and Rogers. They might not have been as good from a pure technical standpoint, but they weren't awful either.

Wayne is strictly a supporter here as this was a starring vehicle for Tim McCoy.  Being from Columbia this film was not quite as rough production wise as some of Wayne's other early westerns.  McCoy is  Pecos Grant who comes to town and is mistaken for Jim Rawlins, who has been dead for several years.  Turns out Rawlins had an enemy in a man named Utah Becker (Wheeler Oakman) the town boss. The Sheriff (Walter Brennan), convinces Grant to play along as Rawlins.  Rawlins' wife is has been having her cattled ruslted so Grant calls in the help of his friends that include Steve Pickett (John Wayne), and they run Becker and his gange out of town.

Bit of a hard to swallow plot but actually pretty action-packed.  One just wishes that the Duke had more to do.",1114041600,2,1120,4.565
2257289,2,B00083FZG8,"This is essentially a Tim McCoy film and a darn good one, too. The ""Duke"" has a minor, supporting role in it, due primarily to the fact that Columbia's Harry Cohn didn't like Wayne and was giving him bit  parts. He later ""escaped"" to Mascot where he made three serials  before landing the Western series at Warner's. And of course, the rest is  history. The ""Duke"" also had a minor role in another McCoy film,  ""Two Fisted Law,"" both released in l932.",964224000,11,451,4.463414634146342
2257296,3,B00083FZG8,"This is actually a relatively good ""quickie"" Western from the early 1930s and one of seemingly dozens that included the Nova Scotian actor Wallace MacDonald in the cast before he switched to producing, and not acting, in films. This is also not the only one of those Westerns in which Tim McCoy heads the cast. A very young John Wayne rounds out the casting interests.

2257299,4,B00083FZG8,"This Tim McCoy western from Columbia Pictures has excellent quality, no splices, and a great story.  It's hard to say about the running time of 57 minutes(most sources say 63).  The worst of it is that the opening credits and end title have all been replaced by a re-issuer(Gail Pictures).  This DVD put out by Sony uses a re-issued print, which is disgraceful.  I can only assume they have no original print of this.  Here we have a very good example of how studios did not take care of their films.  Studios treated some of their films bad enough, but the re-issuers were even worse.  All references to Columbia have been removed and the replaced credits look horrible.  It is extremely depressing to hear the music of the glorious Columbia logo and the original titles and have to suffer through these new ones.",1356825600,,814,4.643356643356643
2257300,4,B00083FZG8,"It's just a dream.  This movie starring Tim McCoy is a very good example of 1930's westerns.  Costarring John Wayne, McCoy is mistaken for a ""missing"" rancher.

This one shines above them so much there is no possible comparison. I don't know how it has survived since it's release on July 8, 1932. but it has faired better the the Range Feud, again by Columbia Pictures that was released a few months eariler.

The 8th Movie to credit and have John Wayne In it

First let's tell some truth here the only reason Wayne name is on this is to sale it. He is not in much of it at all. It is a Tim McCoy western and it follows the basic formula save the helpless girl, save the ranch get the bad guys. It a fun move and kids safe. The basis is Tim McCoy rides into town he mistaken for another man. Then he starts to pretend to be that man. I really enjoyed this movie. It will bring back memories of the ""Little Rascals"" every time you see the horses ride

The Video:

All though it does list itself as remastered in HD is not as clear as it could be. If you seen any of the ""I love Lucy"" sets you have seem what can be done with black and white film. It has some specs though it doesn't jump anywhere. I watched this on my 60 inch Sony Wega and am sorry to say its grainy a lot of places. No spots or dirt though just complete grain thru most of the picture. Of course it is shot in full screen since the aspects of the theaters were 4:3 back then.

The Audio

Its mono and done in true 1930's style where u can see they are feeling out how to place microphones. It's crisp though easy to hear not going to wake the neighbors on this track but its easy on the ears.

Summary

If you just want a fun western with a little bit of the young duke in it this movie is for you. It's a family fun film and the 40 gallon hats are a riot to watch.",1156464000,,1438,3.8344594594594597
2257304,5,B00083FZG8,"This one is remastered in High Definition; which proberly means that a great more care was taken during the process. The end result is a sharp, clear, black and white print that may have been filmed only yesterday instead of in 1932, the 73 years differential isn't at all apparent. Infact, if this one had been filmed yesterday the critics would be full of praise for the black and white photography, it's really that good.

John Wayne has a supporting role, (third in the credits after Shirley Grey) but his screen presence is already very evident throughout.

 Tim McCoy's steely eyed presence really screams out that he is the star of this one, and rightly so. I've not seen a weak movie with Tim McCoy, oater's maybe, but all have good scripts with good plots. Not so well known today, it is unfortunate that his rising star coincided with that of Tom Mix and Buck Jones, and although he made some excellent films in the 1930's and '40's he was overshadowed by Gene Audrey, Johnny Mack Brown, Roy Rogers, and others, including of course ""Hoppy"". He left the excellent Rough Riders series to serve his country in WW2 (he was in the Army Reserve) and on his return, as far as I am aware and I must look it up, his movie career then passed into oblivion.

Back to the movie. It is also great to see a 1932 Walter Brennan, his screen presence also grabs you to take notice. It is great to see Bud Osbourne, (not credited) one of the reliable bad guys from yester-year, without all the wear and tear scratches that one usually sees in old ""B"" Westens from repeated showings.

I only received this one today, then played it, and then I couldn't wait to review it. Highly recommended, buy it, even at the relatively high price for a ""B"" movie of this vintage, the experience is worth having. The five stars are for the exceptional quality of the print. I would give the film three and a half for story and production values.

It's worth noting, for non Region 1 viewers, that although this one is marked as Region 1 on the cover it is in fact uncoded and will play anywhere in the world.",1131494400,9,2085,4.459317585301838
2257305,5,B00083FZG8,"This review is for the Columbia Tristar DVD issue of Texas Cyclone (1932) starring Tim McCoy.

I can hardly believe just how detailed and razor sharp this B&W film is on DVD!!!  It looks like it was shot yesterday.

For a 1932 film, and B-Western at that, this is the holy grail.  The fact that you also get co-starring roles filled by a very young John Wayne and Walter Brennan is just icing on the cake.  But, make no mistake, the star here is definitely Tim McCoy who fills those boots with a commanding screen presence and a confident piercing stare that cuts right through the bad guys!

And those huge hats!  Somewhere around 1939 the typical western movie hat got smaller, but here you get a massive tower sitting on Tim McCoy's head!  Wow!

It was also interesting to see a lot of interesting, but unknown character actor faces here - in most later b-westerns you have seen a lot of the actors time and time again, but here the supporting bit parts are filled with actors I had never seen before.  There are several close-up shots of the supporting actors that really bring out their individual characteristics - it reminds me of certain close-up shots and sequences later seen in Howard Hawks' ""Red River"".  I like a lot of the camera work in ""Texas Cyclone"".

The story itself is pretty good and moves right along - you can read the plot in more detail in the other reviews here so I won't repeat it.

In summary, if you like B-Westerns then you must acquire this exceptionally sharp film looking film on DVD!

For some other excellent film transfers check out any of the Hopalong Cassidy films issued by Platinum or the Red Ryder films issued by VCI.  The Cassidy films are generally pristine while the Red Ryders range from very good to excellent.",1123891200,4,1759,4.5396825396825395

I caught this film on the Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures classic channel-Get TV.  I was not familiar with Tim McCoy, but he was great.  It was fun to see Duke Wayne as young actor. You see the raw ingredients that made him a star.  I loved Tim's giant 10 gallon hat.  I also loved the early special effects.  They speed up the camera during barroom brawls so that it is super fast fighting.  Fun pre1940s film.
