8458309,1,B0055HOIO2,"After dramatic music thunders... dramatically, IRON SOLDIER (2010) begins! ""Soldiers"" in green T-shirts and camouflage pajama pants, firing toy guns, are field-testing a new robot from the local dollar store's giant, plastic dingus department. Oh no! ""Terrorists"" -also equipped w/ amazing toy armaments- break into the super secret facility where the dingus is kept! Halfhearted fighting erupts, resulting in many dead scientists. We know they're scientists because: A) They're wearing lab coats. And B) Scientists cannot act. Enter General Brooks (Joe Estevez- MURDER IN-LAW) sporting a Bride Of Frankenstein wig, who attempts to organize a strike team to rescue the dingus and whatever humans may have survived. Meanwhile, Major John Arbor (Derick Fage) is on a touching family outing. Wouldn't you know it? He's called in to assist, since he's the only one who can operate the dingus. At this point we're asking: A) Where the hell is that dingus, and when will it start killing these people? And B) Who trained the squirrels that filmed this abomination? Oh my goodness! The dingus has been released! A helicopter turns into a cartoon, before crash landing! People run sideways, due to the squirrels' inability to hold the camera straight w/ their tiny hands! The dingus is controlled remotely. Woah! Dingus vision! Run, Terrorists! Run! Toy guns are no match for his laser beam! More tilted camera shots can only mean one thing: It's time to feed the squirrels. A lackluster fist fight breaks out. A big ""twist"" happens. THE END. How many squirrels can dance on the top of an acorn? The dingus surely knows! In the annals of ultra-sludge, sub-dreck films, this one shall forever be known -in squirrel Latin- as Turdus Elephantus...",1512432000,,1736,5.137809187279152
8458310,3,B0055HOIO2,"Acting was not that bad for a low budget movie. The script could have been a lot better; I doubt that the screenwriter or director served in the army. The uniforms were lame, but better acting by the supporting cast of ""soldiers"" might have covered that up. I cannot imagine Canada being so hot that a full field uniform would not have been desirable in the woods. For a prime customer like me, my time was not wasted.",1504569600,2,418,4.371794871794871
8458311,1,B0055HOIO2,"Just finished watching Iron Solider.  It is the worst movie I ever wasted time and money.  This is a low, low, low budget movie made.  First off the soldiers are just wearing t-shirts on a combat exercise and through out the movie.  The acting, the writing and special effects, are amateurish at best. The Robot looks like it was a reject from a childrens Japanese TV show. The scene with they have a helicopter come into take the hostage, robot and three terrorists was 2 man attack helicopter.  If the robot only operates because of DNA of the operator, then the son should ever has worked for him.  This movie is so bad, that it is not even going to meet campy status. This move is going to go into a black hole and never to return.",1316217600,6,735,4.328467153284672
