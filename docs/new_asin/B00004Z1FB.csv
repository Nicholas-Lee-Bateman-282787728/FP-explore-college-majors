7927928,5,B00004Z1FB,"This is one of my personal favorites of the videos that my daughter has. The story line is very close to my heart as it is about a whale, who is the king of the ocean, who loves his people so much that he is willing to die for them. You see, one of his people (or should I say fish) accidentally betrays him into the hands of his enemy. He knows he can do one of two things: Escape his enemy and let his kingdom suffer or face his enemy and save his kingdom. Like I said previously, he loved his kingdom so much that he was willing to die so that they may live. It is a great way to help your children understand the price that Christ paid for our sins. I highly recommend this very colorful and fun video!",1077062400,14,706,3.944055944055944
