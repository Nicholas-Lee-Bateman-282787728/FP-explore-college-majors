8533017,4,B00012FXFO,"This is fun to have in your collection but with regards to performance this wasn't the greatest of brass playing. I like to believe that we have progress further in playing since then (mnozil brass, gewandhaus brass, German brass etc). The audio is fairly good but the video is grainy.

Great selection of pieces and neat to see these three brass sections/groups on stage together.",1344902400,,381,4.861538461538461
