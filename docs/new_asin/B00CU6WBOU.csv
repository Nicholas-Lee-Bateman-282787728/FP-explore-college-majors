5740864,5,B00CU6WBOU,"**No Spoilers**

Should you have liked the series Black Lagoon, this will be a great addition to the series. It expands on the main characters and develops them more. This is a spin off from the main series and it keeps up with what you expect from Black Lagoon.

This is a good buy if you desire more Black Lagoon while you wait for Season 3",1488931200,2,342,4.166666666666667

5740866,5,B00CU6WBOU,"I've owned and watched this series for years, first saw them on adult swim. Roberta's Blood Trail is a fantastic mini ""movie"" branching from the TV show broken into individual episodes. (*plot without spoilers*) All the best characters re-appear and the city is thrown into chaos when Roberta returns to extract revenge on the CIA after they murder her master. A couple new characters are introduced and of course it ends in terrible blood shed you've come to expect but with the combination of emotional stress and heart break only Black Lagoon can provide.",1483747200,3,558,4.946808510638298

5740877,4,B00CU6WBOU,"After reading the Amazon description of this (as well as that for the first two Black Lagoon series) supplied by Charles Solomon, I wondered who he was and why I should care.  Google took care of the first (he is a useless git of a media studies/self proclaimed animation expert teaching at UCLA) but utterly failed to reveal why his opinion might be worth more than used toiled paper.  (Frankly, the cretins meepings suggest that he lives an extraordinarily sheltered life and knows little history, current events, or culture outside that of his protected ivory tower.)  That said, no, this is likely not something you show to your kids along with ""Frozen"" because it has (OMG!) people smoking and drinking.  Well, there is a lot of gratuitous violence, too.  And some rather Disney-inappropriate vulgar language.  Also, apparently most upsetting to Mr. Solomon, USSOCOM operators are not portrayed as heroes doing universally heroic things all the time.  (Were Mr Solomon writing a /review/ of this or any other anime, his opinion would be fine, however, it is presented as a /description/ where his personal squeamishness and political views are inappropriate and irrelevant.)

Roberta's Blood Trail is, in story terms, I think weaker than the first two Black Lagoon series, but still enjoyable.  (I do like the animated iteration moreso than the printed counterpart, especially in this arc.)  Its still a Black Lagooon story: pirates in Elco torpedo boats, displaced Spetznaz, well-dressed Triads, nuns with guns and hidden agendas, all in the nest of corruption and vipers that is Ruanapur.  The English language cast hasn't changed and their performances remain strong.  Where I feel that ""Roberta's Blood Trail"" falls short in comparison to the two previous series, is that while the premise is strong (in the stylized universe it occupies) the actions of some characters, their thinking, their motivations, did not cross cultural barriers as well as in earlier arcs.  It feels especially ""Japanese"" at some key points, such that it did not flow evenly--at least to me, an outsider to that particular cultural milieu--and strongly enough that it pulled me out of the narrative and left me scratching my head a few times.

Regardless of its minor shortcomings, ""Roberta's Blood Trail"" is still a lot of fun.",1445126400,3,2313,5.117021276595745

5740889,5,B00CU6WBOU,"Black Lagoon the Series was absolutely brilliant.  It didn't follow the normal trend or fall into cliches that most anime tend to run into.  It also has one of my favorite intros of all time.

Enter Roberta's Blood Trail which continues on the story already set up(so it's better to watch the entire series first).  This is essentially 5 more episodes of the series.  The action scenes and story are on the same level that the show itself has followed thus far.  I feel some of the themes touched upon are rather realistic and some of the dynamics touching(if in a bit crazy way of doing so).

If you are a fan of the series then it's a no brainier to watch this.  If you haven't watched yet, I highly recommend catching up on the originals before watching this.",1427155200,,762,4.431654676258993

5740947,1,B00CU6WBOU,"In addition to just pacing issues, my biggest problem with Roberta, both story arch and the character, is that she's a cliche that Black Lagoon was completely free of.  I loved Black Lagoon for being gritty, different and refusing to go down any of the cheesy or moe cliche's that permeate Anime.  Every adult character acted like an adult who was making the best of who and where they were.

And then Roberta shows up, a robo-killer maid, weapons and frilly apron ready to go.  OK, she's not technically a robot, but she might as well be.  To me it feels as if the author just gave up coming up with good scenarios.  Had they done it differently, say like Denzel Williams in ""Man on Fire,"" I would have been a lot happier.  I'm sure there are many of you who live for that in an Anime and can't stand the idea of a great series without a maid cafe and a hot tub scene but for those of us who love the original series for what it was I wish they'd kept the entire character out of this series and used her elsewhere.  Perhaps as a new foil to Hayate the Combat Butler.

If you had never seen Black Lagoon, and saw this I think you'd give it 3 to 4 stars for the action sequences, but for those of us who loved the world and characters the release of ""Blood Trail"" was a time to mourn the passing of a great and unique series.",1406764800,5,1325,4.14453125

Blu-ray qualities are excellent. I have never had the DVD version, but the BD is crystal clear. No up-conversion problems there.

Highly recommended - purchased this together with the OVA called Roberta's Blood Trail as it is a 6 or 7 episode sorta-kinda sequel/finish to Black Lagoon S1 & S2.

Also purchased this with Jormungand S1 and S2 for one of the best action anime fixes ever. Both titles have superior plot and dialogue compared to many other animes of similar genre.",1405468800,,533,4.771739130434782

The main characters seem like they have no place in this and are just standing on the sidelines while Rock goes on a wild goose chase but without the action.

Black Lagoon is among the few anime titles released within the last 8 years I can look back on fondly. While the series on occasion can dip into the ultra fantasy with females appearing to be much stronger than what they should be. I simply cannot ignore the other things that grabs my interest. One of its main draws for me has been the tonal consistency and mature direction it manages to pull off on occasion. I enjoy its dark humor most of the time, and admire that it doesn't attempt to jam in random and absurd comedic moments simply to ""lighten up the mood"". Many anime titles just annoy me as they attempt to please everyone which leads to severe genre clashing and Black Lagoon just isn't like that. Based on Rei Hiroe's manga and directed by Sunao Katabuchi, Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail is the third season of the series that takes place in OVA format and contains episodes 25 - 29. Although these episodes can stand on their own I still highly suggest that new viewers pick up from the beginning, because I feel it's necessary to know these characters.

The main story behind Black Lagoon for those unfamiliar is like this; the series follows the Lagoon Company which is made up of four members: Dutch, Revy, Benny, and Rock. They operate as something like a mercenary group making deliveries and some times work as escorts. They reside in the city of Roanapur, which happens to be about as lawless as a city can get. Rock is clearly a man out of place and spends his time attempting to adjust to his new surroundings and tries to hold on to his ideals, but this becomes tougher as he delves deeper into the world of criminals. This third season also follows Rock's steady decline towards giving in to his negative surroundings.

The main plot of the story follows Roberta; she was introduced in the first season as a near unstoppable killer whom people compared with the Terminator. She was definitely among the cooler characters as she was just armed to the teeth, and began taking out anyone crazy enough to cross her. This time around the gloves are off and she's more vicious than ever.

Fans of the first two seasons must be warned that this portion of the series runs a bit differently. The first season did its job in building up the characters and it was more action oriented. The second season did contain quite a bit of action, but it also focused heavily on the series themes which were introduced in the first season. The latter portion of the second season was more cerebral and used its characters to push things such as existential beliefs, isolation, and consequences for one's actions. This season does the same and it's a bit more dialog heavy, but I enjoyed it a great deal mainly due to the well development of its characters: Rock, Roberta, Garcia, Fabiola, and Revy. They carry the narrative very well through some very engaging and interesting interactions. While the plot does have its pacing issues, there is so much going on to keep more patient viewers gripped.

The plot follows Roberta as she hunts down Diego's killers whom happens to be an American special forces unit. However, the story is much thicker than that; Roberta's killing of top ranked officials along with bringing her showdown against the U.S. to Roanapur threatens the outlaw lifestyle of the city, which forces the Mafia families to step in against her. There is plenty going on and it all wraps up in an action packed finale. The characters continue to impress in one way or another, as even the American troops whom are painted as bad guys, prove they're far from that title as they display hearts of gold. It's hard to root against them at times, and I found myself conflicted on whether I wanted them to kill Roberta or not. The small war involves plenty of people, and characters from the previous seasons make unexpected appearances.

It's difficult to point out any real highlight in this season. The action can be spectacular but the characters are every bit attention worthy. The writing is delivered very well, and it's kind of tough watching some of these people try to cling on to ideals in a city that destroys ideals. Roanapur brings out the worst in a lot of people and the writing continues to excel in developing this cesspool of a city. In regards to Rock, this is where it becomes very important to watch at least the second season, because it puts his entire experience in perspective. If there's any issue I have with this season, then perhaps it's small cases with the writing as it marches towards being heavy-handed. There is a lot of dialog on some occasions and there's a feeling that it's just eating up time.

The production values are solid all around; the animation is gorgeous with its detailed night time backgrounds, lit up towns, and camera work detailing the action. There are no shortcuts in the action here folks. The shootouts are intense, the close range stabbings and chainsaw ripping combat deliver the bloody goods, and there's very little to no overly cheap fan service. I love my anime like this.

The sound effects are also worth noting and for the blu-ray this show should be played loud. The gunfire is cool to hear and this also goes for the rifle silencers; and as usual the soundtrack is rocking which adds to the intensity of the action, and it's used at the right times as well. The voice acting for the English dub is once again wire tight working well for dramatic and hair raising moments alike. The profanity is rolled on thick as usual too.  Brad Swaile as Rock stands out again having good chemistry with everyone from the gun toting Revy played by Maryke Hendrikse, to the capoeria fighter Fabiola played by Shannon Chan-Kent.

Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail is easily the best anime released in the states during 2013 I had seen. If you saw the previous seasons then give this a shot as well, but expect something a bit different yet not very much. If you haven't seen any of the series I suggest starting from the beginning. This release is about 125 minutes.

Pros: Well developed story line and outstanding visuals

Cons: More dialog heavy than previous seasons, pacing issues for some",1395705600,,6597,4.687392055267703

5740985,5,B00CU6WBOU,"Robertas blood trail is a 5 episode OVA, do not buy this if you have not seen the main show, as you may not understand the backstory of some of the characters, so please purchase seasons 1 and 2, and after watching/grasping an understanding of the main story buy and watch this.

Robertas blood trail comes in both blu ray and dvd format, dvd format works in australia on most dvd players, but the blu ray disc will need a american dvd player with the correct region code, so region code 1.
you can use a region code 4 dvd player, but it may give you the ability to change the region code to 1, but be weary as some have a limit on how many times you are able to change the code ""usually its 5""
But there is no problem if you live in america as you don't have to change anything.... obviously lol

other than that, i had no problem viewing the movie/episodes. the blu ray was more crisp and had better resolution than the dvd counterpart. it is a must have for all anime/black lagoon fans.

10/10 for the anime, great story, the voice acting was done spot on, i generally prefer dubbed anime over subbed as it allows for greater voice acting flexibility, such as columbian, spanish, british, russian, american accents. one of the best english dubbed anime's out there. The bluray/dvd gives the option to view the anime in subbed ""so Japanese voice dubbing with english subtitles"" so if you prefer subbed it can quench your thirst too..

overall its a great anime, i found no negatives about the movie.
but thats my opinion, took around 1 week to ship to australia, so i received it quickly, and the packaging was done greatly. there was no damage or scratches on the case.

A must have, get it now while its hot... and im not talking about revy.",1391990400,,1745,4.390092879256966

5740988,4,B00CU6WBOU,"Honestly, I wasn't as taken with this story line. Plenty of guns and mayhem, but the chaotic joie de vivre seems to be lacking. A lot of angst and suffering, which, perhaps is inevitable in the world of Roanapur. It was nice to see Shenhua, Sawyer and Rotton again, but they seemed more window dressing than keys to the plot.

Please don't misunderstand: the evolution of characters ... and subsequent insight into some of what we could only assume until now ... was welcome. And folks who have come to appreciate the dark world of Roanapur will enjoy Roberta's Blood Trail. But after the runaway train of the first two seasons, it seems to lag a bit.

By all means get it if you want a greater understanding of how our characters got where they are. But be aware that you may not like what you find.",1390608000,,800,4.4353741496598635

The balance between newcomer Rock, the pretty and profane Revy, the cool-headed Duke, and the computer wiz Benny keeps the series interesting while they deal with Russian ex-soldiers, Chinese mobsters, and one crazy maid with plenty of secrets under the skirts.  Here the maid returns for vengeance, and it threatens to set the whole town on fire (instead of a few buildings like last time).

Roberta blood trail is the story of revenge, and by the one person who would make a terminator take a second to reconsider fighting again.  the problem, the ppl she hunting are the US CIA and the hunt ground is our favorite city where the black lagoon screw reside.  and it just fun fun fun from there
the graphic, and music have alway been good in black lagoon and that still haven't chance, but i was hoping for a bit more music track to get me excite.  funimation bring back the original cast, so they have my absolute gratitude cause those are some of the best dub i ever hear
one problem i have with this OVA is at the very end where they chance how much damage roberta took, and that ruin it a lot for.  im not sure who make this decision, but it upset me to no end, to the point where i rage and decide not to buy the ova for the longest time. but everything else about this ova was wonderful, and it should give u a ride, when they reach the forest at the end however, i complete recommend u read that part from the manga instead, cause i still hold the opinion that the decision that they make for roberta, was cruel and unnecessary",1387411200,2,1354,4.249027237354086

That story arc is one of my two favorite arcs from the first two seasons of the original Black Lagoon, the other being the Yakuza story arc. Roberta's Blood Trail raises the action to an unbelievable level as the Maid of destruction seeks revenge on the CIA team that accidentally kills her beloved master. Many of the characters from the original series appear in this tale: the Black Lagoon crew, Hotel Moscow, the Chinese Triad and of course the crew's favorite watering hole the Yellow Flag. Rock, the Japanese salaryman that joined the crew has evolved as well over the original 25 episodes and takes an unusual role in this story. Aiding the young master in his quest to find and stop Roberta is a new character Fabiola Englacias another family maid.

now the this is an OVA special that happens after S2  so its on fuel tracks while being ignited of sheer awesomeness , the main 4 casts are back  badass gunslinger Revy  ,  poor diluted  Rock ( or is he  )  ,  cyber Tec genius Benny  and last but not least  team mastermind Dutch .

the main story of this Amazing OVA is about the very tragic life changing twist to young master Garcia of the loveless family after his father was killed in a rally resulting into a devastating loss to the master and more importantly the so ever faithful Roberta .

so the hunt begins the maid  x Terminator must once again unleash here deadliest , crazy , brutal and  old self again as the BLOOD HOUND ( Ay-yay-yay )  , her opposition is remarkably an elite  group of fox hound agents of USA  now thing are going to heat up  like never before .

this OVA set is really worth the watch and this series is still packing one hell of a punch on the trigger , I cant wait going to be next to this series  , and most noticeably  the darkness has taken rock to next level which makes it more interesting to see what's next in the future

if you bought the the pervious dvd set from funimation  you must get this its totally worth it  ,  the art is very good  , music is mostly the same but still rocks out as in the originals , story boarding in this OVA was sensational and mind blowing to the show in many aspects  ,  Japanese dup is still solid while English dub is still really worth it to follow up .

If you haven't seen Seasons 1&2 of Black Lagoon, this is NOT for you - yet. Go watch the first two seasons, THEN get this. Or get all three at once, which is a great idea. Then enjoy.

The series - and this 5-episode coda - are not for the weak of heart. Lots of blood, lots of gunfire, lots of appropriate nasty nasty language. And lots of humor, most of it black.

This story picks up when characters we met in episodes 8-10 get their lives screwed around, and come looking for payback. Being it's Roberta, you know there's going to be bloodshed. Since Revy is involved, and she drags in my favorite side character from Seasons 1&2, Chinglish, well wear galoshes and a raincoat. And bring towels. Lots and lots of towels.

You've seen seasons 1&2 - you already know the players. Blood Trail gives more insight into the backstory of Ruanapur. The original series left at least one story arc to be filled - this could be the start of that. I'd really like that to be the case.

Highly, highly recommended.",1378425600,,1138,4.4

While it is not required viewing to enjoy this OVA series, it would definitely aid the viewer in some of the dialogue and story lines that are covered. Quite a few references are made to the previous 2 seasons and is at the core of Rock's (one of the primary characters) motivations in the story.

In a nutshell, this story is about the character Roberta seeking revenge for the death of her benefactor, friend, and employer. Her pursuit of the murderers leads her to the city of Roanapur where the crew of the Black Lagoon are hired to track her down. I do not wish to give away any spoilers but suffice it to say if you are a fan of the original Black Lagoon series you will most certainly enjoy this OVA.

This series if for a more adult audience and contains graphic violence, nudity, and vulgar language, but I wouldn't have Revy any other way!

5741053,5,B00CU6WBOU,"I love the first two seasons of Black lagoon, but this is balls to the wall insane. Never a dull moment. I'd give more specifics, but it'll only ruin the show ( I'm not a spoiler kind of guy). If you're a fan then this one will not disappoint.",1377216000,,243,3.979591836734694
5741054,5,B00CU6WBOU,"Black Lagoon is my #1 favorite anime - partly because it's how I was introduced to anime several years ago by accidentally catching an episode on the Starz channels on cable.  But catching that episode, which happened to be the 4th in the series made me instantly hunt for the show times on any others coming up and what was on demand.  Unfortunately, there was no ""Starz on Demand"" channel at the time - so I rushed out and bought the series, sat down and watched it start to finish, wholly in LOVE with Revy from that point forward.  Plus, the entire series is epic, nearly beyond words in my opinion.

Small ""spoiler-ish"" info ahead, but nothing damaging to the story if you haven't seen it yet and if you can stand a little chatter before watching. Personally if I'd heard / read this before watching I would not have been upset nor felt that someone screwed it up for me.  I'm not listing specifics to the point of spelling out the goings on.  So please read on if you can handle some internal knowledge that doesn't betray what you'll see when you watch:

Roberta - ""the four-eyed super-terrorist"" (as Revy puts it) - is a top notch character & addition.  And while the ""finale"" to Black Lagoon is only this 5 episode set, they did a great job bringing out the ""terror"" in Roberta and showing not simply her going insane for the sake of killing people, or for the sake of merely being a murderous psychopath.  There IS in fact a reason, most of which comes to fruition due to the utterly complete and truly selfless devotion to the family that ""saved"" her.  Even if it did drive her over the proverbial edge...it happened out of harming the one thing in her life to date that was finally worth having, loving, and being part of without requiring she remain a ""monster"".  That said, she really makes an excellent mindless super-killer, albeit farfetched and quasi-Terminator like...in human form.

What we get is a VERY pissed off, now family member, and revenge on behalf of Garcia, is the only way she knows to repay her young master for making her life between acceptance to present, more than pleasant and something she needn't fight to maintain any longer.  And she battles for that particular 'justice' in a way that unfortunately causes her to come unglued.  It sounds silly to say but she began with good intentions - but her history, her life beforehand, and her methods simply would not allow her to keep an even keel while paying back [in SPADES] what ""they"" did to her new family.

**Spoiler-ish chatter complete**

Among the 5 episodes, I truly cannot think of a single scene that I didn't thoroughly enjoy, nor that I thought didn't belong in the set.  If anything at all, it needed more but that's nothing more than the BL fan in me dying for more, more and more to get a bigger, better 'fix'!! (LOL)  ""Roberta's Blood Trail"" was very much in line with past seasons and episodes regarding violence and crossing the line so to speak, to the point it could very well be (depending of course on one's own personal palate for violence, blood, gore, and other ""adult"" situations) the most horrifying 5 episodes in the entire series.

Obviously I am quite biased when it comes to Black Lagoon but I tried to remain as objective as possible while giving my own review here.  As such, if I HAD to pick something I didn't like or felt could have been better or more and whatnot, it would be the flashbacks.  I could have (rather, I wanted to), see SO MUCH MORE of the flashback info we get in this set.  They are truly awful flashes of back-story for Revy and for Roberta - both of which I wish had been a full episode, if not more.  I most definitely felt bad - downright sick - during parts of them.  They touch on subjects that are rarely easy to digest whether they're fiction or not.  But they also explain SO much about heroines that more could have only been even better...at least from a character building point of view.

And if I had to choose something selfishly, I would have **REALLY** LOVED more story for Revy and Rock!  But frankly, anyone who is a Black Lagoon fan probably wants the same thing to one degree or another!  Yeah - it's not that kind of series, but still - I'd have liked it to go down that avenue for those two - I believe that would have made for a great deal of even happier fans. :-)

And that's it!  In a nutshell I cannot recommended either RBT, or Black Lagoon as a whole, enough to anyone - whether you're an anime watcher or not!  If you like action, violence, crime, etc., you cannot go wrong giving this series a chance.  I absolutely loved it!  Every second of it!!  From here I can only hope someday they make even more seasons / OVA sets - anything honestly.  Just as long as they can keep the original cast.  No one will ever be Revy except Maryke Hendrikse!!  NO ONE - not for me...

Hope you love it as much as I did!!",1377216000,,4877,4.426008968609866
5741065,2,B00CU6WBOU,"I really liked the first arc with the ""killer maid"" Roberta in Season 1 of Black Lagoon. This was nowhere even remotely as good. Roberta went from being an over-the-top foil for Revy to being a complete Mary Sue who pushes the other characters to the sidelines. She also becomes completely unlikeable, which is a problem when you're apparently supposed to sympathize with her. I found nearly all of her victims to be more likeable than she was in this one.

And did I mention that all of the Black Lagoon crew get pushed aside for this? Rock gets wrapped up in his ""master plan"" which involves doing nothing and smoking lots of cigarettes, Revy gets sidelined early on and does nothing but sulk, and Benny and Dutch just sit on the boat.

So to sum up: deprotagonization, Mary Sue-ism, wildly inconsistent tone, unlikeable turns for previously likeable characters, lame action sequences, and a huge big pile of stupid.",1376524800,10,918,4.767295597484277
5741066,5,B00CU6WBOU,"Finally, after four years of waiting, Universal/Geneon has released the third season of ""Black Lagoon"" called ""Roberta's Blood  Trail"". The psycho soldier turned maid has returned to create more havoc and spill a very large volume of blood. ""Lagoon"" fans will remember 'Roberta' from her murderous rampage in the first season. Those of you who have never seen ""Black Lagoon"" should go and buy season one (Black Lagoon) and season two (Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage) to get the complete back story of the Black Lagoon crew and Roberta's first psychotic attack on the rat-hole city of Roanpour. Her first visit was bloody, but this time it's a massacre.

Without going too far into thls season to spoil it for you, she is on a rampage against the CIA/NSA for killing her employer Mr. Martinez, who saved her life when she needed it and she became his maid in return. Naturally she seeks revenge for his murder and
to protect his only son. The blood flows in buckets and the Lagoon crew find themselves involved in her revenge,as the CIA/NSA soldiers have hidden themselves in Roanpour. And 'Rock' has to come up with a plan to save everyone involved.

The animation is first class and this season doesn't disappoint. It's just as good as the first two seasons (still available) so you really should buy these to help you become involved in this whole sordid, bloody affair. Available either in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack or Blu-Ray only. (I have noticed that almost all the new anime being released is as a combo pack, with some exceptions.)

You will enjoy this season as you will the first two. The price is very reasonable through Amazon.com (in fact it's the lowest price I've seen). There are a few extras on the DVD, but more on the Blu-Ray. If you enjoy great anime, you will love the entire three seasons of BLACK LAGOON and Amazon.com has them all.

All of the voice actors return for this string of episodes and it has all of the blood and mayhem of previous installments. the first episode alone is well worth the price of the Blu-ray. and Roberta is one of my favorite characters so seeing a series that she takes such a large part in was very fun. I hope that they are working on more of these in the future.",1376006400,10,487,3.88
5741069,5,B00CU6WBOU,"Long Time Black Lagoon fan, for a long time I have put off watching this for various reasons but all the worries I had about these episodes were wrong.  This is a great addition to the series, Roberta really turns into something frightening the deeper you go into the story.  Very nice and thrilling, self contained, story with some character development I didn't see coming or even expected.  The real shame here is I have no idea if more episodes will ever be released but if this is the end of the anime it ended on a very strong note.  If you are a long time fan you'll love it, seeing the old gang again definitely stirs up some nostalgia for me.

Extras, disappointingly there is only previews of other Animes, textless credits, and trailers.  I haven't seen a commentary or interview with Japanese or English Voice Actors.  Not a huge ding but i would have loved to check some of that stuff, especially riding high after the conclusion where I love soaking in all the little extras/nuances.  Blu-ray quality is great, as another reviewer said there's also a dvd included with the bluray.  Just don't make my mistake and binge on the whole thing in one sitting Haha.

The Manga series was suppose to be back in development, if that gets off the ground we probably won't see more anime content for at least a coupe years, shame. BUY THIS THOUGH :P",1375920000,,1352,4.526748971193416

I was completely wrong, and I actually enjoyed this 5 episode story the most! I think its completely worth the purchase. You really get a lot more character development out of Rock and Revy, and I really hope that the Manga picks up again.

5741074,5,B00CU6WBOU,"Black Lagoon was an unforgettable experience thanks to its intoxicating blend of action and awesome characters. So when the series ended many were left at a loss to find a suitable replacement. But fans need worry no longer, as this set brings back the explosions , guns and characters we love so much - all in an English dub! If that isn't enough to get you excited, then the return of a certain gun wielding Spanish maid is sure to clench the deal for you.

Black Lagoon: Roberta's Blood Trail (BL:RBT) is a five episode OVA series animated by Madhouse, that centres around the character of Roberta, who previously appeared in BL season 1. Her first appearance made it clear she was not to be taken lightly as she was one of the few who could match Revy in terms of sheer madness and skills with a gun; however, in RBT we see an even more extreme version of Roberta; one which will excite and create fear at the same time.

The set begins with the death of a certain person close to Roberta - an event which leads to her abandoning her role as maid to the Lovelace family and becoming a bloodhound who is determined to have her vengeance - even if it means fighting against Roanapur and the US army! The setup is a brilliant one, and paves the way for 5 episodes of intense action and ends with a sensational climax.

Of course, this being an OVA format as opposed to a set amount of episodes such as season 1 and 2 of BL means that there are changes. Fortunately, every single one of these changes are for the better. For starters, the episodes themselves are longer - 33 minutes as opposed to 23. This allows for a more natural pace so that the story can be done full justice and not feel rushed in any shape or form. Another change that's arrived, and perhaps one of the more noticeable changes, is the increase in violence. Fully living upto it's reputation as a senin, RBT makes a statement of intent that this version of BL is more intense, dark and violent than what came before it, even the vampire twin stuff.

Though the gore levels may be ramped up a level it's not necessarily just there for the sake of it. In my opinion, the violence is necessary to show viewers the other side of the emotionally damaged Roberta; she is a completely different person with a gun in her hands, and the contrast between the quiet, docile maid persona she normally adapts and the pill popping, rifle wielding maniac is shocking.

Still, this set isn't actually all about the action (BL is more than that, thankfully), and ample time is spent examining Roberta's character and psyche, providing background into why she ended up the way she has. In fact, she's not the only character who has changed. For those wondering what happened to Rock's character after the emotionally damaging trip to Japan, well this set answers that, too. His character goes about quiet the interesting change.

Also present in this set are some welcome, fan favourite faces, and also some new ones. What else? Well the usual awesome action scenes, philosophies about life, gun movie references and Revy of course! If that isn't enough to convince you to buy this then I can say no more. Oh, wait - did I mention the animation is gorgeous? Well, it really is excellent and a treat for the eyes. Madhouse are one of the best animators in the business and this OVA is no different. Production qualities are superb: the sound, action, animation and storytelling all come together for 5 amazing episodes which stand up as the highlight of Black Lagoon so far. Highly recommended.",1369440000,68,3547,4.551724137931035

8586343,5,B00CU6WBOU,"Otaku John, the anime / manga / light novel fan here to review another great Anime Series of the Black Lagoon legacy.  This follows the arc of Roberta's Blood Trail, exploring in detail the past and backstory of the maid Roberta, who's actually an ex-assassin, working for the rich ""Lovelace"" family as a maid, while she's hiding out from the authorities.  When her employer (and old family friend) is accidentally murdered by government agents, Roberta goes on the warpath, treading down the dark road of her past to get even.  Being Black Lagoon, it delivers the goods on all levels of action, violence, and all-out entertainment.  You'll just wish there was more, as you just can't get enough of Roberta, especially when she's as hard-core and psychotic as she is in this series.  Animation and voice acting is top-notch, and all your favorite characters from the first two seasons of Black Lagoon are back, including Revy, Rock, Dutch, Benny, Balalaika, Mr. Chang, and of course, Roberta and her ""master"" Garcia.  If you loved the first two seasons of Black Lagoon, then this is a must-have.  If you haven't seen the original Black Lagoon, start with that one first, as this is an add-on, and won't make much sense without having seen the first one.  But if you're really new, go ahead and get them both, because you won't be disappointed.  If you like to read, I suggest the mangas too, written by Rei Hiroe, available on Amazon too.
