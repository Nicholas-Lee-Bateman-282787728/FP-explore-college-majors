7155227,2,B00WYMNLA8,"The film played out like soft-core gay porn at several points; way too much detail w/bodily fluids. it seemed to drag out midway through and I started using my smartphone midway to get through the boredom. I stopped caring at one point. The surprise ending did a little to redeem it; Monique was good in the film.

It also felt a bit unrealistic for a small town in Mississippi (based on true experience) - in real life, there's very little inter-racial mingling other than what's mandatory. The ""Adolf Hitler Syndrome"" unfortunately is a primary factor in places like these.",1438128000,,575,4.808080808080808

7155237,2,B00WYMNLA8,I was expecting so much more. The movie had great potential but it could have benefitted from more thought-out script that expanded the character development. The plot seemed a bit disjointed although Monique's acting role is always spot on! I was routing for this film but for me it was lacking. Congrats to Julian Walker and the rest of the cast as I felt each contributed to the movie at large. Really looking forward to seeing Terrell Tilford in some more roles as I think he's a good actor and Ive enjoyed his work. Hats off to Isaiah Washington as well.,1483574400,,559,4.544554455445544

7155248,2,B00WYMNLA8,"EVEN TO THE PART WHERE (IN HIS DREAM) HIS FATHER AND MOTHER CAME TOGETHER AGAIN BECAUSE THE FATHER TOLD HIM CLEARLY THAT HE IS A PITCH-HITTER; HE GOES  EITHER WAY.  (I FELT SAD.)  DID HE KNOW THAT ABOUT HIMSELF WHEN HE MARRIED?  MAYBE.  MAYBE NOT.  THAT'S WHY I WAS SAID.  (THAT'S HOW LIFE CAN WORK DURING ""TIMES"").

THIS MOVIE INTRODUCES THE ""IDEA"" THAT ALL BOYS OR MOST BOYS GO THROUGH A DILEMMA OF COMING TO KNOW THEIR SEXUALITY AND IT IS ALL A PART OF GROWING UP.  WELL YEAH.  OKAY.  WE'RE FREE.  OUR PARENTS AND THE CHURCH, AND THE GOVERNMENT, CAN'T FORCE US IN TO WHAT THEY THINK WILL BE BETTER FOR US  (AND SOCIETY) IN THE LONG-RUN.  THAT'S THE PERCEPTION DURING THESE ""TIMES"".  (WELL.  GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.)

I WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT THE MOTHER WAS NOT PLANNING ON HAVING A BED OF YOUNG GUYS IN HER HOUSE JUST TO TO BE NICE.  THAT'S NOT HER JOB  AS A PARENT.  BOYS AND GIRLS ARE SUPPOSE TO OBEY AND RESPECT THE RULES OF THE HOUSE.

AS ADULTS WE ALL LEAVE OUR MOTHER TO FIND OUR WAY IN LIFE.  THIS MOTHER SHOULD BE PREPARING TO MOVE ON KNOWING FAIR WELL SHE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HER CHILDREN BECOME EVEN IF THE FATHER WASN'T THERE AND ONE HER OF HER CHILDREN WAS KIDNAPPED.  BUT, THIS MOM REMAINED AT THE NEST....BUT THAT'S OKAY... YEAH (each mother chooses her own adjustments)  BUT ONCE HER CHILDREN GET TO 21...A MOM SHOULD DEFINITELY HAVE HER NEW WINGS HERSELF.

THE YOUNG FILMMAKER KEPT SAYING IN THIS MOVIE THAT ""GOD IS LOVE""...WELL, GOD IS LOVE... BUT I MUST ADD THE ONLY THING I CAN ADD AND THAT IS : ""THERE IS MORE THAN ONE GOD.""  *ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLES DO NOT GET TO COME IN AND CHANGE PEOPLE'S GOD AND REPLACE PEOPLE'S GOD WITH THEIR BRAND OF GOD;.  *THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND SAYING LOUDLY.*  SO.  THAT'S SOMETHING AMERICA WILL HAVE TO WORK ON.

THERE ARE A MILLION WAYS TO CREATE AND CONNECT TO A god FOR WORSHIP AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ""SPIRITS"" AND ""ATTITUDES"" AND THERE ARE A LOT OF ""principles'"" and ""practices"" TO GO ALONG WITH THAT....YOU KNOW: to make the connection to your own sense of god.
*TRADITIONALISTS CAN'T CELEBRATE TWO BOYS OR TWO MEN TOGETHER WHEN HETEROSEXUALS  ""WERE BORN in THEIR WAY TOO"";  THEY WERE BORN TO MAKE BABIES WHEN THEY HAVE SEX AND BABIES ARE NEW LIFE FOR THE FUTURE.  AND HOMOSEXUAL SEX IS JUST AN ORGASM.  (WELL.  THAT'S WHAT I THINK.  AND THIS IS WHY I WAS MISERABLE THROUGHOUT.)
  IN OTHER WORDS, HETEROSEXUAL TRADITIONALIST HAVE A DIFFERENT GOD BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT MISSION IN LIFE.
  THIS IS WHAT I SAY IN MY SCHOLARSHIP.]",1474243200,,2505,4.407894736842105

7155270,5,B00WYMNLA8,"Enjoyed main character journey toward understanding SELF,and where he fits. His
mother portrayed by Monique was so on target.
Kudos also to Isaih Washington (though not
physically with wife/son ); his character steers and motivates his son forward. Cast was
excellent.",1459555200,,268,5.560975609756097
7155271,3,B00WYMNLA8,"I really wanted to like this movie.  I have been a fan of Ian Polk since his Noah's Arc days.  The story starts off pretty straightforward, young man struggling with his sexuality and his commitment to his family and religion. Towards the end, it lost me!  It started off as a realistic story and somehow turned into some wacky sub plots with unbelievable endings.  The kidnapping storyline, the miscarriage/abortion/death (not sure what is was), did not fit with the initial story.  I just felt like it was disjointed and lacked cohesiveness. The acting was ok.  Monique really outshined everyone in this film.",1458518400,,611,4.9411764705882355
7155272,5,B00WYMNLA8,"I love this move so much!  It is so tender and relatable. I found myself reminiscing, hopeful,  crying, and smiling throughout the entire movie. It is well written, acted and directed. What a wonderful gem.",1458345600,,206,4.857142857142857

7155274,5,B00WYMNLA8,"This is not a good movie, for a start it doesn't seem to be able to decide whether it is a soft porn film or not. The plot is very busy, containing many different elements and requires some concentration to follow. The lead character's younger sisters abduction several years earlier has led to his parents splitting up, his father leaving home and his mother struggling to come to terms with her daughter's disappearance. The lead's high school friends have to deal with teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease and casual gay sex all set against the backdrop of a suffocating church. Add to this the lead's supernatural ability to see the future, an exorcism, the deaths of two of his closest friends and his struggle with his own sexuality, it is a film that could be confusing especially as the writing could be better in places. But despite it's flaws (or maybe because of them) the film is actually an extremely powerful coming of age drama and a beautiful, beautiful love story. This coupled to the movie's amazing soundtrack makes this is a really wonderful movie that I would recommend to everybody.",1456963200,2,1115,4.842931937172775

7155277,5,B00WYMNLA8,Absolutely love this movie bought it for my best friend just so we can both watch it together. Excellent story and great quality.,1456012800,,129,4.6521739130434785
7155278,3,B00WYMNLA8,"Overall, the movie was okay story wise but the acting, and dialogue could've been better. I didn't like how it's given that someone was going to die, because the main character was able to see glimpse of the future. Also I felt this was another movie with stereotypes that didn't need to be addressed. Like really ""let's sleep together to see, if you're actual gay"" #Really? However, I enjoyed the ending scene it was bittersweet.",1453939200,,430,4.746666666666667
7155279,1,B00WYMNLA8,This movie was so horrible! Soft gay porn is the best word for this movie. This movie is for in the closet gay young boys. I couldn't get back my 30 mins of watching this movie. I had to turn it off!,1453766400,,199,3.761904761904762

7155292,1,B00WYMNLA8,"Not a good movie. The trailer for this movie made it seem like it had such promise and it looked so interesting and they kept showing an enraged Monique as a mother angry with her son because of his lifestyle and we hardly got that at all.  I found the lead to have a great voice, do't know if he was a professional singer at all but he was awesome but at the same time he was very distracting from the story. The characters to me did not seem real and as for Monique I was not impressed.  To come from Precious to this role to me was a let down.

If you want a movie at least to me that could really show what being gay in the black community can be like I highly recommend ""Pariah"".  It has really depicts what life can be like least to me.  I wanted to like this movie but it just could not hold water.",1444608000,,805,3.914110429447853
7155293,5,B00WYMNLA8,"I eagerly awaited this dvd and was not disappointed.
At the beginning there was a little bit of dodgy miming (although I like to think maybe my audio /pic was temporarily out of sync!) but the singing and acting was superb.
I thoroughly enjoyed this film which will have a permanent place in my 'must keep to enjoy again ' library.
Of particular note for me was Kevin Allesee who stole every scene with his wonderful accent. But this does in no way belittle the performances by all concerned.",1444521600,,492,4.53932584269663

7155297,3,B00WYMNLA8,First of all I would like to say that Julian Walker did a fine job for his first film. I did not go in with a lot of expectations so this movie was just okay. I felt that the film could have flowed a bit better but overall it was okay.

7155311,5,B00WYMNLA8,Great Movie. This movie relates to a lot of young African American men in our Black Churches of today. We need stonger male role models so  our young men don't drift away.

7155318,5,B00WYMNLA8,This movie was one of the best movies I've seen I a while! I couldn't  stop thinking about my youth and how relatable the characters life was with regarding loving a man that necessarily wasn't gay. or at least we thought until he was told different in dream at the end.

7155323,4,B00WYMNLA8,"The movie has a great story and the lead actor was wonderful, however I found that there was just way too much going on within the film that pulled your attention away from the main plot points. It is powerful in the way that it depicts the struggle of a young black Christian coming to terms with his sexuality especially with it being set within the bible belt of Mississippi. Mo's a much better actress than what I saw in this movie. I get it, she's a church fanatic who had a mental breakdown. Isaiah Washington's role though subtle was actually one of my favorites. He didn't get much screen time but his points came across well. I loved seeing little Nelson from The Cosby Show within the film, it has been such a long time since I've seen him in anything. If you are looking for a Christian drama with a message about the importance of love and acceptance then this is a good one. There is some strong language at times and a lot of sex scenes so not a good one for young kids.",1441584000,8,984,4.267379679144385

7155364,2,B00WYMNLA8,"At first glance, director Patrik-Ian Polks tale of Randy, a closeted gay black kid living in a religious community, is a commendable, valiant and timely endeavor. Bloodcurdling prejudice still reigns in many parts of America, and light needs to be shed on those injustices. Unfortunately, upon closer scrutiny, the film  an adaptation of Larry Duplechans 1986 book  reveals itself to be off-putting and overstuffed; perhaps they stuck too close to the rhetoric and many plot points of a novel written 30 years ago, which was well-meaning but now feels somewhat outdated.

The very first sequence throws you off-balance, introducing Randy (newcomer Julian Walker) singing at a church choir. His eyes meet Todds (Torrey Laamar), chemistry sparks, and they make out, causing choir members to gasp and faint. Its all relatively amusing and promising, but then the tone swiftly shifts to somber, as Randy awakens from his wet dream and prays to the Lord to forgive him for his sins.

This constant shifting of tones remains prevalent throughout the film. And how could it not? The filmmakers, instead of focusing on this kids intimate plight, tackle an incredible variety of themes and plot points. Its about (get ready for this) a boy who is gay and in love with his friends boyfriend, and sings in a choir, and stars in a local (hysterically cheesy) film production, and works on an all-male adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, and meets a filmmaking hunk (deep breath) His sister is missing, with an ongoing investigation functioning as a minor subplot; Randy has an estranged father (Isaiah Washington), while his mother (MoNique) is a borderline-crazy religious fanatic; Randys friend is pregnant, which causes a furor in the community; and he has premonitions, some of them involving dead peoplePlus, there are nods to Shakespeare, John Cassavetes (which, within the films context, are borderline sacrilegious  its like the filmmakers are letting us know they're aware of Cassavetes, but have learned nothing from seeing his films), and there are even semen sequences straight out of a Farrelly brothers film.

Most of the young cast  with a few exceptions, including the lead  give amateurish performances, but the overwritten, obvious script, by Polk and his co-writer Rikki Beadle Blair (both worked on the short-lived Logo show Noahs Arc), doesnt make the job any easier for them  you try saying the following lines and make them sound plausible: Randy: I wake up and Im soaked in in His friend: Say it! Randy: Sin! Or how about this insightful outburst: My virginity is nothing but a curse! The following line summarizes the films bogus, misguided solemnity, as well as, I believe, its main point: Whats wrong with the occasional dream?

Dream? Dream about what? Randy exclaims early on in the film; before he can answer, Todd rides in on a bicycle, shirtless, and starts pouring water on his head in slow-motion. Blackbird is full of such jarring, ridiculous moments. Randys first sexual experience with a young man just happens to be in front of his own, fanatically-religious and grieving mothers house (you can guess where that leads). Todd keeps climbing through Randys window to chat with him, in obvious nods to the Shakespeare play they're staging (hey, at least you cant fault the filmmakers for having low aspirations!). Some scenes almost transcend their ludicrousness, such as the You SuckBut In The Most Attractive Way song Randy sings to Todd, as hes cuddling with his girlfriend (the rest of the films many songs sound like theyve been written by Mandy Moore). The final sequence, where Todd gives Randy a speech through the window, is so stretched-out and laughable and out-of-context, one wonders what the F the filmmakers were thinking.

This precarious mix of campiness, crassness and earnestness makes for an uneasy but strangely-compelling watch. Blackbird tries to satisfy a variety of demographics: Bible-Belt folks, contemporary hip teens, Academy Award votersAs a result, it alienates them all. One character says Jesus is there, in everything we do. Same applies to this film  Jesus is mentioned at least 300 times  but it contains too many F-bombs to appeal to the stringent faith-based audiences, who would also balk at certain sequences, such as one involving a simulated male rape, and another portraying a male threesome (both played for comedic effect).

Its a shame, as the film had potential. Isaiah Washington and MoNique are top-billed, but rarely appear, though in some of the films best  and painfully short  scenes. Washington atones for his Greys Anatomy debacle with a sequence where he talks about kissing a boy, tongues and everything (he also produced Blackbird, further establishing his gay-friendly cred); MoNique has to utter some terrible, pseudo-Biblical lines, but also has a somewhat-powerful sequence, where she tries to exorcize the homosexuality out of her son. Julian Walker does a commendable job in the lead. Most importantly, the films heart is in the right place, its powerful messages of religion, tolerance and sexuality well-intentioned but inadequately relayed, diluted by too many head-scratching moments and half-explored themes.

It seems like Blackbirds filmmakers were unsure of which direction to take it; a more firmer stance was needed. The film is as at war with itself as its main character. As a result, the soapy mixture, at least in tone and substance, is much more A Walk to Remember than A Woman Under the Influence.",1438560000,4,5496,5.150392817059484
7155365,4,B00WYMNLA8,"This film was very well written and I dug the vibe and past through out the whole film. My only critique of the film is the lead character. I feel like they could have found someone better. He played the character a lil too soft to me. It would have went against the grain for the lead to actually not look an act like the stereotypically portrayed gay man. Also, an awkward Caucasian spouse always seems to sneak his way into a gay black film. Why couldn't his boyfriend be black? But other than that, the screenplay alone makes up for my opinions on the downward side of the film. I solely, still recommend this film. Monique and Isaiah Washington were stellar. The girl who played Crystal oddly enough was one of my favorites as well. Ian Polk rarely disappoints. #Icons",1438473600,3,773,4.48936170212766
7155366,2,B00WYMNLA8,"I was anxious to support Monique and this film but was honestly disappointed. The characters and story lines had no real depth, just a series of events linked together. I don't understand why we (Blacks) always feel a need to feature some random white person in our films.
