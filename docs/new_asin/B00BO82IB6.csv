5661733,5,B00BO82IB6,great movie it hit every angle with realistic perfection in the horror genre. :) Plus the actors played their part great so I definitely recommend this movie.,1373760000,,158,4.888888888888889
5661734,5,B00BO82IB6,"I found this disturbing and original, with a great lead actress and lots of the dark weirdness that I love so much in a movie.  It's a little bit ""just wrong""...but I found it to be so fascinating at the same time!  There are torture scenes which may bother some, but those things don't bother me and I feel like this movie was really well put together",1370390400,2,352,4.2388059701492535
5661735,4,B00BO82IB6,"This was a great movie that had everything I wanted...cool torture scenes, a crafty heroine, a totally twisted plot (I'm into that sort of thing).  What I didn't expect though was how much it made me question myself.  There are many scenes that just really shouldn't be sexy, but somehow they are undeniably so.  They are twisted and horrific and somehow totally hot.  A big part of it is the actress, she does a great job at playing a girl who won't be beaten down by ANY man.",1368316800,4,477,4.386363636363637

5661737,2,B00BO82IB6,"Really well made film about runaways,psychos who pickup hitch-hikers and just pains of all kinds.
There is a certain Anthony Perkins-esque feel to the lead,But anyone watching probably won't remember the nuance that is.
The female lead is very good and I hope bigger and better things for her (Maura Murphy [...]  )and the bad guy.",1363219200,2,331,4.910714285714286

8571863,3,B00BO82IB6,"9 Days is a pretty decent film that focuses more on character relations and suspenseful drama. Most of the terror involved comes from the surrealistic yet organic setting of the film and the simple fact that a psycho lures young girls to his home and sets out to torture them into a better way of life. In some serial circles this is probably a great date-movie. Schleichers Virgil is a fun demented kind of crazy which makes you like his type of sinister s*** but I found Murphys Danielle a bit inconvincible in her role. I had to push the fact that she looked more 28 than 18 from my mind to appreciate the characters story. However I never really believed she ever feared for her life or was anything but mildly aroused by her captor.

 That being said Murphy did give a straight performance and was able to draw enough of the character out for me to enjoy the movie. It is a dark off-beat portrayal that rides heavy on melodrama with some really raw yet minimal violence. Toward the middle of the film I did find myself drifting off in thought but I came back to the story as it neared day nine. That is when the story gets stimulating once more. There is not much of a high intensity to the film instead riding a steady psychological antagony. I saw this film as more of a story about how to pick up chicks in Hell anti-romantic drama as opposed to a tense thrilling story of torture and survival.",1431129600,,1402,4.367816091954023

8571865,4,B00BO82IB6,"Fairly good horror movie, Kind of strange ending!",1415923200,,49,5.25
8571866,1,B00BO82IB6,"I'm not sure why I watched this thing; in the beginning I had the idea it was some kind of amateur production.
Sometimes once I get started on something like this, it's easier to finish it than quit.
I was glad that the villains got killed off in the end, but that doesn't justify the time spent on this load of old crap.

I'm basically inclined to agree with the other 1-star reviewers that this is a total waste of time, but evidently some people like it.  I don't understand what they liked about it; I guess horror movies are not really my thing, but if I do see a horror movie I expect to be scared.  This isn't scary at all, just disgusting.
I have to say, the actors did a good job, and deserve much better.

So, evidently this works for some people; but I'm going to rate it 1-star on the basis that it's mostly unpleasant, disgusting, boring, and I don't see any point to it.",1413072000,,884,4.21301775147929
8571867,2,B00BO82IB6,"The film is loosely inspired by "" Dante's Inferno."" Danielle (Maura Murphy) is abused by her foster father. She leaves home and gets picked up by Vigil (Chris Schleicher) a creepy personable psychopath who belongs to a Christian order of one that promotes the idea you must sin in order to be redeemed. Danielle becomes one in a series of victims.

The religious idea was one similarly practiced by an early Christian Gnostic sect. The torture sequences are light as compared to other films, i.e. this is ""G"" rated compared to the ""Saw"" series. Most of the film takes place in the basement of Vigil's house. The soundtrack consisted of a light song that appears to be sung in Hebrew. The problem is that the film is somewhat pointless and non-entertaining. It is supposed to be a dark comedy. The humor relies solely on Vigil's lines, which grew tiresome.

8571870,1,B00BO82IB6,"Any reviews of this that are good are by someone making money off of it, that's for sure.  The best thing I can say about it, is that's it's not the absolute worst I've seen, but pretty close.  Don't waste your time.",1376265600,16,216,4.119047619047619
8571871,2,B00BO82IB6,THIS MOVIE WAS SO GOOD I WATCHED IT IN ABOUT 10 MIN. THE ACTING WAS HORRIBLE WHOEVER WROTE THIS NEEDS TO BE SHOT. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WHIPS AND CHAINS LOOK ELSEWHERE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR HOT WOMEN IN OR OUT OF CLOTHES LOOK ELSEWHERE. BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PHONY SENES A ROTTEN PSYCOPATH WHO CAN'T EVEN ACT LIKE ONE THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU. I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT THE PLOT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AS IT HAD NONE. THIS WAS THE STORY OF O WITHOUT THE O,1376265600,16,461,3.863157894736842
