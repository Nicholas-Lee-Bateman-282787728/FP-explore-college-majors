2081326,5,B0002EJ8IE,"the Tien Shinhan saga is one of great conflict, revenge, redemption and features a very unexpected and dramatic cliffhanger. the 22nd tenkaichi budokai begins with some very interesting fights. very soon the tournament becomes a battle for survival not victory. it all plays out in a very believable and epic way. one of the highlights is the fight between goku and krillin and tiens insurrection. we get a new character that we really start to care about. i would highly reccomend this saga as it features some of the best fights of the series and greatest moments in character development.",1228608000,,591,4.92
2081327,5,B0002EJ8IE,This saga has the crane hermits pupils in the tournement only to find out that goku had fought tao and defeated tao and that fired them up. So that makes even harder for goku and krillin. And it also has the return of jackie chun the champian of the the last world tournement. And finally tien turns from his evil ways. But at the end we find after goku forgets his power pole and the four star dragonball at the restraunt entrence. krillin offers to get it but goku senses danger but still lets him go but after awhile he does not come back. Goku can hear krillin in his head so goku rushes out of the restaraunt only to find his best friend dead with the man that announces the tournement laid next to him with goku furious of his freinds death that ends the the saga for now. I personnaly love this saga because it has pretty good fights. I give this five stars.,1155427200,,865,4.216867469879518
2081328,5,B0002EJ8IE,I loved this saga mostly because of the action. This saga contains 18episodes (9episodes on each disc. Tien won the tournament because Goku had bad luck and crashed into a stupid truck. I thought that that was extremely cheap but what really fascinated me was in the end of the saga. Krillan was killed by a mysterious new villain. I really suggest buying this saga because you'll have a lot of fun!!!!,1153353600,,402,4.597222222222222
2081329,5,B0002EJ8IE,"The Tien Shinhan Saga is wonderful. It contains 18 episodes of Dragon Ball on only 2 discs which is just incredible.  This saga deals with the 22nd Annual World Martial Arts Tournament.  Once again Goku, Krillin, Yamcha, and Jackie Chun enter the tournament, but who are these two new fighters who seem to know Master Roshi? A new master from Roshi's past is revealed.  The fights are not to be missed as almost all of them are spectacular.  My personal favorites were Tien vs. Jackie Chun and Tien vs. Goku.

This saga is my second favorite in Dragon Ball due to the final episode entitled, ""The Fallen.""  This episode's title has a double meaning in that it literally means Goku and Tien are falling from the sky and only one can become champion, but it also means the death of one of our heroes.  This episode sets up for in my opinion the greatest saga of Dragon Ball, the King Piccolo saga.

Overall, the Tienshinhan Saga has a great amount of fighting and many episodes.  I would recommend it to any fans of DB or DBZ.",1152489600,2,1024,4.462365591397849
2081330,5,B0002EJ8IE,"Arguably the best saga in the original Dragonball anime, we find that Goku, Kuririn, Yamcha, and Master Roshi/Jackie Chun are once again participating in the Tenkaichi Budokai.  However, Tenshinhan and Chaozu, the two warriors Goku encountered at the end of the Fortuneteller Baba set, have also entered, and soon what starts out as a fun-filled time turns into a fight for life!  You see, Tenshinhan and Chaozu's master is the evil Crane Hermit, and he just happens to be Master Roshi's rival!  Not only that, but Tao, the assassin Goku defeated, happened to be his younger brother!  When the Crane Hermit learns what happened to his baby bro, he's determined to make sure that Goku and Kuririn die no matter what!  Complicating matters are the mysterious Manwolf, who seems to have it in for Jackie Chun, and the fighter Panputto, who's sleazy agent is determined to make sure he wins the Budokai.  Not only that, but despite Tenshinhan's claims that he wants to become an assassin, Master Roshi realizes that there is some good in him.  Will he be able to get Tenshinhan to change his ways?

Of course, this saga is a tournament, and with that you can expect tons of fighting, correct?  Well, of course!  With 18 episodes total, there are a ton of brawls throughout, but the highlight for me has to be the final five.  These form a whopping 5-episode battle between Goku and Tenshinhan, which are some of the greatest parts of the entire Dragonball storyline ever.  The ending also ends on quite a cliffhanger, leading into the next set(King Piccolo, part 1), but even though I don't own that one yet, but, I'm more than happy with this one, which is easily worth the $40 price.",1119052800,11,1681,4.719178082191781

2081333,5,B0002EJ8IE,"Finally they release the last of the DragonBall series, although I hope they release the un-edited first 13 episdoes later...(please God).  The Tien Saga truly shows a lot of progression from the first tournament. The level of choreagraphy is astounding. When I watched this saga on tv, my jaw was to the floor for the entire thing.  If you're  fan of the series , this is essential.",1097452800,3,383,4.686567164179104
2081334,5,B0002EJ8IE,"Funimation has been doing a bang-up job subtitling this, my favorite of animes, too bad it has taken three years to put all the DVDs out (not to mention the fact that they haven't even went back and re-released the first 13 episodes uncut/subtitled).

In this installment, we see Goku's second tournament and the rivalry between the schools of Turtle and Crane. Really good stuff.

 Even though I hated Funimation for raping and pillaging Dragon Ball Z many years ago with droning techno over what is beautiful and appropriate original background music, changing character names, so forth, I appreciate that they have recognized the fans of this show that enjoy the original Japanese version by offering a near perfect translation and audio transfer.",1095724800,7,750,5.08130081300813

8027173,5,B0002EJ8IE,"This saga introduces Tien Shinhan  to the world of Dragonball.  The character is well-developed, and has plenty of screen time.  This set is a great way to enjoy Tien over and over.  The DVD has a Play All feature.  There are 18 episodes on two discs.  Nice packaging too.  The prequel episode which introduces Tien and Chiaotzu is not included, but I have the blue brick set, so no problem.  Tien is a fantastic character in the Dragonball/Z universe, and as he is an Earthling, I find him easy to relate to.  His transition from mean to clean is a blueprint for Piccolo, Vegeta, Android 18, and Fat Buu.  Tien Shinhan rocks!",1455235200,,626,4.508928571428571

8027178,5,B0002EJ8IE,"Came fast! easily one of the best sagas of dragon ball before king piccolo!
for 6 bucks, totally worth it!
comes with all 18 episodes of the saga!",1350777600,,146,4.25
8027179,5,B0002EJ8IE,"Last year I managed to purchase all of the Dragonball episodes made, and Dragonball Z too. I purchased this one while working my way through watching them all in sequence. If you love Dragonball, you will love this. This particular saga covers one of the World Tournament events, when it is Tien Shinhan's chance to shine. I can't say more except that as a true Dragonball addict and fan, I am glad I bought it.",1267574400,,411,4.493333333333333
8027180,5,B0002EJ8IE,"While the first Tournament was a gimmick fest without any memorable matches and nobody fighting hard, this tournament took the characters from the series to new heights. It introduces the Crane School, rivals of the Turtle School, Tien, Chiaozu, and their master Shen. Just about every fight in the tournament is a good one. Tien and Yamcha face off in one of my favorite fight of all time in the first round, and Chiaozu's fight with Krillin is really the only time we get to see the little guy fight. Roshi's match in the semifinals with Tien is another all time great, as we get to see the old master finally get serious, and the fight between Krillin and Goku was excellent (not to mention the only time those two really fought each other). The final battle between Tien and Goku was brutal to the finish as the main character of the series meets his first true rival. The Dragon Ball series takes a big turn in this saga, dumping the 'Kids Only' approach for top notch action and a compelling story. It's also easily one of the biggest of the old box sets, since it didn't get split up. There's Nine Episodes on each disc! If only the newer boxsets did as much.",1243296000,,1166,4.453271028037383
