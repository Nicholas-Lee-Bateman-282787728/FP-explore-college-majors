277004,5,6300250253,"The year is 1986. Spandex,make-up,glitzy hair,earrings and fishnet are in style and glam is king. The songs on this video are great except Thank God for the Bomb and Killer of Giants which sounded somewhat dated because of their lyrics. I could do without all those keyboards,but then again it was the mid 80's. Jake E. Lee did a great job on guitar and delivered a blistering solo. He may not have been Ozzy's most popular guitarist,but he was certainly talented. The rest of the band also performed well and this arena spectacular displays Ozzy at the top of his game. I thought Suicide Solution,I Don't Know and Bark at the Moon were the best songs on here. Never Know Why was performed in a different key than the studio version.

This video takes you back in time and makes you wish that the mid 80's never ended. This was the true heyday for heavy metal as it reached popularity levels that reached the stratosphere. It's a bit cheesy at times but it captures the feel of an era and a must own for any Ozzy fan. I only wish this was on DVD,but because of region code issues,I settled for this old VHS copy instead. Get it while you still can.",1242691200,,1148,4.415094339622642
277005,5,6300250253,I was very excited to see the Ozzman in his prime and was not disappointed. I was blown away with the movie and am super glad I chose to purchase it. A defininite must for all you fans of the Prince of Darkness. He put on one of the best shows of all time and this video is proof.,1191024000,,280,3.76271186440678
277006,4,6300250253,"Best tracks are Bark the moon, Secret Loser and Mr. Crowley.

A must have for any metal fan.",1147737600,,92,4.111111111111111
277007,5,6300250253,"This out of print VHS is the only means of watching this excellent concert.  The Jake E. Lee era is and will always be my favorite Ozzy era.  With that being said, this entire video illustrates 80's metal and all of its glory!  Jake E. Lee and Randy Costello are a pleasure to watch live!  They're both showmen, knowing what to do, when to do it, and how to make it look easy!  The Ozzy Osbourne Camp is at the top of their game during The Ultimate Sin Tour!  The bottom line is, this is a classic, 80's, hard rock show!",1124236800,2,520,4.099009900990099
277008,5,6300250253,"Great concert, Seen them here in Lousiville in 86. I wish they had this on DVD. If any one knows where or even if they have it out on Dvd. Give me a yell. Thanks  Signed Ozzy Fan",1041206400,5,178,3.6842105263157894
277009,4,6300250253,"There is nothing better than watching Ozzy perform live! ""Suicide Solution"",""Lightening Strikes"", and the ""Ultimate Sin"" are the best songs on this video. The video for ""Shot in the  Dark"" is a little cheesy but the song rocks and is one of best hard  rock songs ever made! I wish Ozzy could have left out ""Killer of  Giants"" and ""Thank God for the Bomb."" I would rather have  seen ""Never"" and ""Fool Like You"" from the  ""Ultimate Sin"" album on this video. Will Ozzy ever release a home  video that contains all his music videos? I would be the first in line to  buy it! Once again, a true Ozzy fan will appreciate this concert!",951177600,6,627,4.4

7807322,5,6300250253,"This was the show that introduced me to Ozzy, and made me a fan. After the loss of Randy Rhoads on lead guitar, Ozzy went through a string of great guitarists. In my humble opinion, the best of them was Jake E. Lee, who is featured in this show. The band is tight, and Ozzy sounds great!",1465257600,,287,4.052631578947368

7807325,5,6300250253,This is a great live concert from Ozzy Osbourne with Jake E. Lee from the ultimate sin tour in 1986. Ozzy and Jake are both in top form here. The three videos from the ultimate sin album are mixed in with the concert.,1395187200,,217,4.069767441860465

7807327,5,6300250253,Great footage of Ozzy at his best. Many songs from Ultimate Sin album that I haven't been able to find elsewhere. Why hasn't this been released on dvd?,1361145600,,151,4.428571428571429
7807328,5,6300250253,"This is basically a video with great sound, of the Ultimate Sin Tour.  It has some snippets of amusing videos with Ozzy and beautiful girls during parts of some songs, but seems mostly all from one venue of unknown location.  The band is great, with special mention of just how great Jake E. Lee was at that time, 1986.  Talk about shredding better than Van Halen, and filling the boots of RIP Randy Rhoads with great solos!!!  Ozzy has a talent for getting the best guitar players, great bass and drums, too.  Two Black Sabbath songs, 6 RR era songs and 7 from the Jake E. Lee albums era, plus a separate tripping great guitar solo, and wild drum solo.  Looking at reviews of other Ozzy videos, and the expensiveness of the DVD for this one, I chose this VHS, and don't regret it.  I got it because of Jake E. Lee, who deserves equal prestige with the late great Randy Rhoads, Zakk Wylde at his best, Ed Van Halen at his best, and Gus G.",1281139200,3,938,4.295454545454546
