8309405,4,B001HRJFXI,"This movie differs from the original manga. In the manga the main character Ryo Narushima is actually an unrepentant and often unsympathetic person. In the film they change the chracters and plot a bit to make Ryo more likeable. The story starts with Ryo killing his parents at the young age of 16 and being sent to a juvenile detention center for two years where he learns to survive or be killed. Living a life on the streets selling his body to old rich women to make money after he is released. He wants more to his life and wants to prove he is strong and defy the public eye of everyone who sees him as nothing but a parent murderer. More or less a darker version of ""Rocky"". Without ruining the story let's just say along the way you learn more about Ryo and get to like a character that you know you shouldn't but respect by the end of the film. The fighting is excellent and everything moves at a more brisk pace where the manga would sometimes drag. The director Cheang Pou-Soi knows how mix brutal action with emotions perfectly just like his previous film before this ""Dog Bite Dog"". Deserves a rental at least for fans of the manga and a buy from anyone that loves a good underdog movie.",1346457600,3,1200,4.361607142857143
8309406,4,B001HRJFXI,"I saw it a over 1 year ago. I liked the film. I think the story was
good and interesting. Good realistic and brutal fights in my opinion. I
think they made it like Shawn Yue actually knew martial arts.

What was rare in this was that they didn't use much wires in the fights.
I noticed 1 or 2 wires in the film. I think Shawn did a good job in the
fight scenes, and acting. It had enough action scenes for me. I hope a sequel will be made to this film.

It think it deserves a sequel. If you like
a action film with a good enough story, and a film with well made fight
choreography and realistic, brutal fights, then i can for sure
recommend this film to you.",1252368000,,659,3.9473684210526314
