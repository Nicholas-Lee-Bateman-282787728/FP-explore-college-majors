Would be better if this title was available on DVD so people like myself could jump right to the secions we wre having trouble with.  Just a suggestion.  Definite purchase for anyone looking to play Tequila !!!",1010880000,4,371,4.765625

Okay, it's a decently made video, alright presentation, easy to pick up on the licks, the on-screen tablature is great...
BUT I never got past Misirlou (the first song on the tape) because... it's not Misirlou. The video instructs you to play the song in the wrong SCALE. If you listen to a Dick Dale recording of this song and then watch the tape, you will laugh yourself off your stool.
It's wrong. You can find a tab transcription book with this song and see for yourself that it's wrong.
[opening lick actual notes: bottom string 0,1,4,5,7,8,11,8,7 and on the video: 0,3,4,5,7,10,11,8]
Waste of ten bucks.",991699200,18,666,4.75
7888296,5,6305347999,This video is great! I am playing all the songs on the tape and it took less than a weekend to pick up the basic licks of each song. The tablature is on screen with the fingering so it makes learning some great surf music  really easy.,952041600,5,235,4.0
