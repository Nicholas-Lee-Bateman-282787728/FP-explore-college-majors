8139289,3,B000HEVZF8,"An early showcase for the vivacious French-Canadian star Fifi D'Orsay, THE GIRL FROM CALGARY (1932) is an adorable Pre-Code gem with lots of romantic comedy and musical surprises.

A rodeo rider by day and cabaret star by night, Fifi Follette (Fifi D'Orsay) is the city of Calgary's best-kept secret, until a brash young publicity agent scoops her up and helps her win the Miss America pageant.  Harbouring strong romantic feelings for his latest discovery, Larry (Paul Kelly) is soon pushed aside by larger agents when Fifi lands a Broadway contract.  Will Larry and Fifi ever manage to find love and happiness together?  To quote one of Fifi's songs from the film - ""Maybe, Perhaps!""...

The glowing, fun-loving performance of Ms D'Orsay is the main reason to recommend THE GIRL FROM CALGARY, a highly entertaining Pre-Code gem which never wears out it's welcome thanks to a brisk 64 minute running-time.  Paul Kelly provides a sweet love interest for D'Orsay; their chemistry is delightful.  Astrid Allwyn co-stars as Fifi's showgirl best friend.

The DVD from Alpha/Oldies is a decent quality, which I suspect comes from a 1951 television broadcast print.  The main titles have been newly reconstructed and the black levels are very solid.  There's minor image jitter and some jumps in scenes but nothing that will seriously affect your viewing pleasure.

If you like Pre-Code classics, THE GIRL FROM CALGARY is the girl for you!",1214438400,4,1433,5.081196581196581
