8498101,5,B006H3V4U4,"Michel van der Aa, a Dutch composer born 1970, is the composer-in-residence for Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. He was awarded 2013 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition in December 2012 for Up-Close, ""a highly innovative fusion of musical and visual art"". As visual art is an indispensable part of the work, one will have to either experience it in the concert hall, or with a DVD like this. Here is some information of the DVD.

1. Technical information. This DVD is encoded in the PAL format for all regions.(*1) Thus the newer models of DVD/BD players should have no problem of playing it anywhere in the world. The total playing time is very short, at about 31 minutes. There are 3 sound tracks in uncompresed PCM stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1. (In my system, the PCM track sounds the best.) The liner notes by Tim Ruthford-Johnson is worth reading.

2. The music and film. How should I describe the ""fusion""? Think about the solo concertos with tape in the early days of electronic music. Then think about the musical works which requires musicians to move and act ritualistically on stage, like in some of music by George Crumb and Steve Reich. Up-Close is a combination of all these, updated to fit the psyche of 21st Century. One may call it a concerto for solo cello, string ensemble and film, but it is really an audacious synthesis of music and film -- an experience defying traditional classification. On the one hand, if played without the visual aspect of the film, it's a cello concerto ""with tape"".(*2) On the other hand, this half-an-hour piece is intended as a multimedia experience and is intimately linked with the film. Van der Aa manages to create a hybrid of music and film which is so much more than the sum of its parts.(*3)

3. The performance is outstanding! Ms. Sol Gabetta, an Argentinian-French cellist for whom Up-Close was composed, is a virtuoso cellist of the first rate. I am glad to report that the required physical movements and acting do not compromise her musical performance. Amsterdam Sinfonietta gives very strong ensemble support.

4. Where to buy? Try Van der Aa's own label ""disquietmedia.net"". It's also available through ""amazon.fr"". More information about Michel van der Aa can be found at his own website ""vanderaa.net"".

An impressive release and an engrossing experience. Not to be missed.

Highest recommendation.

-------------------
(*1) I think Mr. Van der Aa's label made a mistake by producing this DVD in PAL format instead of NTSC. Most of the major labels in classical music have moved to NTSC.
(*2) Some sound comes from the film which is projected from a notebook computer.
(*3) In a concert hall performance, the film would be projected on a screen and the performers have to ""sync"" with the actions in the film. The DVD presentation, however, frequently cuts between the stage and the film. The common objects and actions on stage and in film provide links between these parallel universes. For example, at just past 12-minute mark, both Sol Gabetta and Vakil Eelman (the actress in film) are seen carrying a lamp, walking parallel to each other.",1366502400,3,3133,4.87781954887218
