8256224,1,B0014SW4CE,"I felt this DVD was severely lacking in any useful information concerning it's application in hypnotherapy.  That being said, it offered VERY basic information about the definition of fears and phobias, just in case no one ever opened a dictionary. I had hoped to learn specific techniques that might be helpful in treating thoses with phobias.  I have been a therapist for 30 years, and the information presented in this DVD could be found in any basic reference.  I had initially planned on purchasing a few other hypnotherapy DVD's from this individual, but I wouldn't waste my money on another.  Don't waste your money.",1259539200,2,623,4.961538461538462
