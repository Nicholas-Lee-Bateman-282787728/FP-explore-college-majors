1395523,4,B000055ZKB,"Well, Judgment Day in a lot of people's minds was a dissappointment, but I disagree. Backlash, that was dissappointing, but at the same time, it was also expected to flop. This wasn't expected to be that great, but it was. The Triple H/Kane match was great. Intense, with great crowd support and the crowd went nuts when Kane got the win. It was a brutal match too, which helps. The main event was your basic Taker/Austin match. Pretty much the same as any other one they've had. Summerslam 1998, Over the Edge 1999. This was similar, thus, good. The Two out of Three Falls match with Angle and Benoit was the best match, next to HHH/Kane on the whole card. This did not let anyone down and was very well done by both men. Lita and Chyna was unexpectingly good, as was Tag Team Turmoil. Except for the fact that X-Factor stayed in too long. I hate them! Anyway, I advise you to buy this video for sure. It's good.",995846400,,913,4.376470588235295

One of my favorite matches was the chain match between kane and triple h. Triple h gets all busted open and bloody and kane wins the intercontinental championship. The women's championship is on the line too at Judgement Day, as chyna defends her title against lita! The main event is Undertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin as austin defends the world title against undertaker. This is a pay per view you must own!!

1395527,5,B000055ZKB,"Judgment Day certainly was the most aggressive ppv thus far for 2001. With the less than impressive Backlash getting stinker ratings, the WWF obviously tried to pick up the pace with Judgment Day, and they succeeded admirably. This was nothing short of an amazing ppv. The chain match, no holds barred match, tag team turmoil, hardcore match, and even the women's title match was a little impressive (if you pause it just right, you'll see a clear blooper on Chyna's outfit). All in all, excellent, solid, and entertaining. Here are the matches:
1. William Regal vs. Rikishi - great opener, Regal gets a stink face.
2. 2 OUT OF 3 FALLS (PINFALL, SUBMISSION, AND LADDER) Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit - another classic and runner up for best match of 2001
3. HARDCORE CHAMPIONSHIP Test vs. Big Show vs. Rhyno - solid and very hardcore, with an impressive gore from Rhyno.
4. WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Chyna vs. Lita - good match, not as disappointing as Chyna's WrestleMania and Royal Rumble matches.
5. INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP CHAIN MATCH Kane vs. Triple H - very brutal, a classic with a good ending. This is another runner up for match of 2001.
6. TAG TEAM TURMOIL NO. 1 CONTENDER'S MATCH Acolytes vs. Radicalz vs. Dudley Boyz vs. X-Factor vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit vs. Edge & Christian - good match between seven great teams.
7. WWF CHAMPIONSHIP Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Undertaker - great main event, extremely brutal and entertaining No Holds Barred match. Get this tape as soon as its availible. Well worth the money. Hopefully, WWF will continue with more ppvs like these.",990662400,19,1603,4.832727272727273
1395528,5,B000055ZKB,"After The dreadful, predictable, and boring Backlash 2001, WWF Judgment Day came to us with a great card, and man it delievered.  Not the best ppv, but a very good one.  We start off with Commisioner Regal vs. Rikishi in a solid and exciting opener.  Next up was Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit in a 2 out of 3 falls match.  First fall was pinfalls only, second fall was submissions only, and the 3rd fall was  aladder match for Angle's gold medals than Benoit had stolen.  This was another match of the year canidate.  After waging purely technical wars at Wrestlemania X-7 and Backlash 2001, these two men jus rip into each other and fight it out in one hell of a match.  Next was Test vs. Big Show vs. Rhyno for the Hardcore title in a solid and exciting match.  Next was Chyna vs. Lita for the Women's title in a short and interesting match.  Next up was the Chain Match for the IC Title between HHH and Kane.  What a war.  Very brutal, violent, and shocking.  An explosive match with a classic ending.  Next was the Tag Team Turmoil which was a little long but very exciting and good.  Finally, The WWF Title Match between Stone Cold and The Undertaker.  This match was made No Holds Barred earlier in the night by Regal and man this was a war.  This was the best meeting between these two to date. Very, very excting and carnage filled match.  Pick this one up now.  A really good ppv.",990403200,3,1387,4.326848249027237

Rikishi giving WWF Commissioner William Regal the ""Stink Face"", Chyna holding onto the WWF Women's Championship, Kurt Angle winning his medals back, Kane winning the WWF Intercontinental Championship, Stone Cold keeping the WWF Championship, Jericho & Benoit winning Tag Team Termoil and Rhyno keeping the WWF Hardcore Championship. Super PPV, BUY IT NOW!!",990403200,,418,5.348484848484849
1395558,5,B000055ZKB,"This was one of the best PPV's in 2001 but it gets forgotten about due to the fact that it's either not one of the big 5 PPV (Rumble, Mania, King Of Ring, SummerSlam, S. Series) or this was one of the PPV's before the infamous WCW/ECW invasion angle.  Either way, this was a good standout PPV on the behalf of the WWE.

Rikishi vs. William Regal - Rikishi just recently turned face again & put into a fued with Regal who was defending the honor of Stephanie McMahon (who recieved a stinkface).  Rikishi had a shoulder injury so this was pretty short & sweet but very entertaining as Regal's facial expressions after the stinkface were priceless.

3 Stages Of Hell Match: Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit - The first fall was a ""pinfall only"" match which Benoit won in under a minute.  The second fall was ""submission only"" while the third fall was a ladder match with Kurt Angle's medals hanging from the top.  This doesn't match their previous & future encounters but it ranks right up there as one of the match of the years as they put forth a tremendous effort resulting on another awesome chapter in their ongoing series of matches.

Hardcore Champion Rhyno vs. Test vs. Big Show - This wasn't strickly a ""New Jack"" weaponsfest as it was just a 3 way brawl that went all over the place and very entertaining with the occassional weapon being used only to have things more impactful.

Womens Champion Chyna vs. Lita - This was Chyna's best match as champion since Lita was able to show off how tough she was with Chyna including that powerbomb at the end.  This wasn't a blow away performance but it wasn't a Chyna dominated match as they whole streak in the womens division was.

Intercontinental Champion Triple H vs. Kane - 17 months before they would meet again in a Unification match that was overshadowed by a unbelievable storyline involving ""Katie Vick"", they put on an awesome performance here in this chain match.  Watch out for some of the chain & chair shots...including the last one by Stone Cold Steve Austin.

Tag Team Turmoil Match: This was probably the best ""turmoil"" match WWF has had since it wasn't heavily rushed though or had a bunch of quick fluke wins.  The two big highlights were Hardcore Holly's ""Alabama Slam"" on D-Von though a table & the last two matches with Benoit's performance concidering the long 3 falls match with Kurt Angle a little over an hour earlier.

No Holds Barred Match: WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Undertaker - This was unbelievable as they didn't use weapons alot (minus a couple of chair shots) but this was a straight intense brawl & I think Austin set the record for the most low blows in one match.  These two work well together & this ranks right up there with their First Blood match as my favorite encounter between these two.  Vince McMahon doing the commentary added to this match as well.

Overall, there was only one average match in the Womens match but overall, this is a ""forgotten"" 5 star classic that I recommend.",1180656000,,2989,4.577861163227017
1395559,4,B000055ZKB,"After re-watching this event last night, I decided to delete my old review of this and redo it. I still think this is a 4 star event but I think my first review of this wasn't that informative like my reviews are now.

William Regal vs. Rikishi
I felt this wasn't a very good opener. The match went way too short and Rikishi and Regal (particularly Regal) didn't really show us what they are capable of. Regals gets busted open at the end of the match but his facial expression after suffering the stink face is absolutely priceless. 2.5/5

Best 2 out of 3 Falls Match (Pin Falls/Submission Match/Ladder Match)
Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle
This 2 out of 3 Falls match was for the Gold Medals of Kurt Angle. The first fall didn't really exist. Benoit gets the pin in under a minute. The Submission Match I felt was the best out of the 3. The second fall was very physical. Angle wins with the Ankle Lock. The thrid fall was very good as well. A couple of good spots dealing with the ladder. Angle gets suplexed at one point on the ladder. Edge & Christian would interfere and cost Benoit the match. But Benoit would get revenge later in the PPV. A very good 2 out of 3 Falls match but don't feel this was Benoit's and Angle's best match together. 4.5/5

Hardcore Championship
Rhyno (C) vs. Test vs. Big Show
This was a good match for the Hardcore title. All three men would make their way into the crowd and fight all the way into the backstage area. The match gets better once back in the square circle. Rhyno hits the GORE! to the Big Show through a trash can for the win. 4/5

Women's Championship
Chyna (C) vs. Lita
A very good Women's Title match. Lita did a great job holding her own against the bigger and stronger 9th Wonder of the World. Both divas used a couple of good submission and grabbling holds. A good Women's Title match. And also, watch out for Chyna's boob nearly popping out of her top. 3/5

Chain Match for the Intercontinental Championship
Kane vs. Triple H (C)
Great match for the IC Title. Kane's arm was still injured from the violent attack from Trips and Stone Cold. Kane and Trips both used the chain very effectively on each other. Trips gets bloody in this one as well. With a screw up from Stone Cold, Kane gets the win and captures his first IC Title gold. 5/5

Tag Team Turmoil for the #1 Contendership
Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz vs. APA vs. Perry Saturn & Dean Malenko vs. X-Pac & Justin Credible vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit
Good match. The APA along with Saturn and Malenko start things off. APA would get the win there and then meet the Dudleys for the second match. The APA and Dudleys has a better match then with Malenko and Saturn. With help from the Hollys and a table, APA gets the win here too. X-Pac and Credible would meet the APA next. With help from ALbert, X-Pac and Credible gets the win over the APA. The next team was the Hardyz. The Hardyz meshed in well with Pac and Credible. Pac and Credible gets the win here too. The next team was Chris Jericho and a Mystery partner who turned out to be the Rabid Wolverine, Chris Benoit. Benot and Jericho put Pac and Credible in their places then would meet the Edge & Christain in the Final match. Jericho/Benoit and Edge & Christian has a pretty good match. Overall a good Tag Team Turmoil. 4/5

No Holds Barred for the WWE Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin (C) vs. Undertaker
This match was just a fight. It started out as a brawl when Taker meets Austin in the aisle way. The match slowed a bit once back in the ring. A nice table spot too where Austin gets chokeslammed through the announce table. Trips and McMahon helps Austin retain his title. A good match but not nearly one of Austin's or Taker's better matches. 4.5/5

Overall Judgment Day is a good DVD/VHS to pick up. And for the trivia buffs out there, this was Triple H's last PPV until Royal Rumble 2002.",1169856000,,3891,4.3646408839779

Rikishi V. William Regal

Ok opener that actually got the crowd into it. Regal cheats to win. *1/2

Two-Out-Of-Three Falls Match For Gold Medals:

First Fall: Pinfall Only

Second Fall: Submission Only

Third Fall: Ladder Match

Kurt Angle V. Chris Benoit

Great Match however, my least favorite for all the Angle/Benoit matches. This was still a very, very good match, but I think the first and last falls were two short, while the second fall was too long, very solid submission match, but too long for a 2 out of 3 falls match. Angle wins. ***3/4

Triple Threat Match for the WWF Hardcore Championship:

Rhyno (Champion) V. Big Show V. Test

1395573,3,B000055ZKB,"WWE Judgment Day 2001: Above Average

I though Judgment Day was above average with some really entertaining match-ups with a couple of really poor excuses for matches.

Rikishi vs William Regal
This match is a classic example of proving that nine times out of ten that opening matches of wwe ppvs are crap. This match was terrible the only entertaining part was when Rikishi backed his ass in Regal's face. 3/10

2-Out Of 3-Falls Match for The gold medals
Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit
Ist Fall - Pinfall only: This first fall was over really quick when Angle tried to use Beniot's head butt but he missed and got angle slammed.
2nd Fall - Submission Only: This was great with plenty of submission moves that have been seen before between these two and some new ones. Angle finally wins when he applies the ankle lock for the fourth time in the centre of the ring.
3rd Fall - Ladder Match: This is where the entire match picked up. Including Suplexes on and off the ladder, Irish whips into the ladder etc. My favourite part is where Beniot is swinging the ladder missing Angle the first time then getting him in the second swing. Edge & Christian interfere in the match costing Beniot the match. Overall a very exciting match. 8.5/10

Triple Threat WWF Hardcore Title Match
Rhyno (c) vs Big Show vs Test
I was disappointed with this hardcore match when I expected much more from it. Throughout the match it seemed like that Rhyno was the only person who knew what he was doing. Best part I remember was Rhyno delivers a trolley load of anvil cases to Big Show's head. Rhyno wins with the gore to trashcan to Big show. Average Match 5.5/10

WWF Women's Title
Lita vs. Chyna (c)
Chyna's Power vs. Lita's quickness made the match a little bit entertaining also still I did not enjoy the match overall. 5.5/10

Chain Match For WWF Intercontinental Championship
Kane vs. Triple H
This was the match of the night a very brutal match with tons of blood. There was great use of the chain throughout the match. The best moment was where Kane pulled Triple H with the chain right into a steel chair. Austin came out to help although whacked Triple H with the chair instead of Kane. Kane wins and becomes the New IC Champ. Great bloodbath 9.5/10

Tag Team Turmoil Match #1 Contender's Match for Tag Team Titles
APA vs. Radicals vs. Dudleys vs. X-Factor vs. Hardys vs. Jericho & Beniot vs. Edge & Christian
This was the best tag turmoil match I've ever seen it was very long match with plenty of action that kept the crowd going. Hollys came out and put Devon through a table and Albert helped X Factor a lot. Very unique + entertaining match 8/10

No Holds Barred Match for the WWF Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Undertaker
This was a great and also slow main event at the same time. Undertaker dominated the rattlesnake in the first half of the match including choke slamming Austin through an announce table. Stone Cold then smacked Taker with a monitor and started to work on his legs. Then Triple H came in with a sledge and saved Austin's title. A great main event 8.5/10

Overall Mark 48/80 roughly about 68% making Judgment Day a B rated event in which I believe that if you really want this ppv I suggest that you rent it out and then decide if you want to buy it or not. Thankyou for reading my review on WWF Judgment Day 2001.",1124409600,2,3333,4.486798679867987

1.)Rikishi vs William Regal

I wouldn't say this match is as bad as everyone says it is. Only good part of the match was the stinkface and the look on regal's face after. 6 1/2

2.)2-Out Of 3-Falls Match for The gold medals

Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit

1st Fall. Singles match. The first fall was very fast. Benoit wins with kurt's Angle Slam.

2nd Fall. Submission Match. It was pretty slow but it was good. Angle wins with the Ankle Lock.

3rd Fall. Ladder Match. This was a pretty good fall with both men taking a few bumps with the ladder. But Edge & Christian interfered and held benoit back so that Angle can get the medals. 7 5/10

3.)Triple Threat Hardcore Title Match

Rhyno(c) vs Big Show vs Test

I thought this match would be better. This was a letdown. And when Rhyno hits Show with a gore through the trash can. It didn't even look like there was a lot of Impact. 6 5/10

4.)Chyna vs Lita

Whoa. Better than I expected but still it wasn't great. But what would you expect from the women of the wwe/f. 5 5/10

5.)Intercontinental Championship

Chain Match

Triple H vs Kane

I feel this match is a bit overrated. But its still pretty good nontheless. Austin came out and then grabbed a chair but he hit Triple H instead which looked so stupid because he could've hit Kane in the back,and Triple H got his hand up when he got hit with the chair. But is still looked pretty cool when Triple H hit the chair and began bleeding. Still pretty good match. 8 5/10

6.)Tag Team Turrmoil Match to determine the #1 contender for the Tag Titles.

I though this match was gonna have more action,plenty of high risk manuevers. But man was i wrong. This match was only average and i was dissapointed in these competitors. They could've done better. Only good part of the match was when Holly's came down a hardcore holly gave D-Von an alabama slam through the table.

Here's the order of elimination...

A.P.A. defeated Dean Malenko & Saturn

A.P.A. defeated Dudley Boyz

X-Pac & Justin Credible defeated A.P.A.

Stone cold vs Undertaker

So many people under rate this match. I dunno why. This match was fantastic. This match had monitor shots,outside interference,more than 10 chair shots throughout the whole match,broken table,close pinfalls. This match was awesome. The only dull part of the match was when Austin gave Taker a submission that was for about 2 minutes. I think these two men mesh well together.

  Another great match.  Triple H actually loses to Kane.  You should really enjoy this match because it is brutal and there is so much hatrid for each other.***3/4

A.P.A. v. The Radicalz v. Dudley Boyz v. X-Factor v. Hardy Boyz v. Edge & Christian v. Chris Benoit & Chris Jericho  # 1 contender for World Tag Titles

  This was one of the best tag matches ever.  Scary thing was that this wasn't even for Tag Title gold.  It was to see who the # 1 contender is.  Benoit & Jericho win.  When Benoit makes Bradshaw tap to the Crossface.****1/2

Stone Cold Steve Austin v. Undertaker  World Title

  The Main event tops off a great PPV.  Austin and Taker have an completly awesome match.  I loved the way they kept having stare downs.  I wish they could have kept this match go longer it was awesome.  Austin wins with a Stunner.*****",1099612800,4,1548,4.381294964028777

I agree with you in every way about how Judgment Day 2002 was one of the best of 2002, but I think they didn't want to release it elsewhere because during the PPV both King and JR mention the name WWF. Therefore, the WWE probably want to cover their butts from a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund. That idea just sprung to me out of nowhere, actually.",1096502400,,447,4.090909090909091
1395589,4,B000055ZKB,"This is actually a review for Judgment Day 2002.  For some reason the WWE only released this DVD on their website, which I don't understand because it was one of the better PPV's of the year.  This was the first PPV under the new name of the WWE not F.

1. Eddie Guerrero vs. Rob Van Dam (Intercontinental Title)

Good way to kick off the show.  Very entertaining, fast paced match.  Good match, although these two would go on to have one of the matches of the year a couple of weeks later with a ladder match on RAW.  (8/10)

2. Trish Stratus vs. Stacy Kiebler (Women's Title)

Nothing too exciting here.  Bubba Dudley gets put through a table.  This match featured Batista's first appearance at a WWE PPV, although he was known back then as Deacon Batista.  (5/10)

3. Hardy's vs. Brock Lesnar & Paul Heyman

Nothing too exciting here except for Lesnar tossing the Hardy's around.  It is pretty funny when Heyman gets involved in the match.  (7/10)

4. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Ric Flair & The Big Show (Handicap Match)

Pretty good match.  Austin put on a good performance.  X-Pac gets involved in the match.  Watch X-Pac sell the stunner from Austin.  It is sick.  Austin's last match on WWE PPV before quitting the organization for nine months.  (8/10)

5. Edge vs. Kurt Angle (Hair vs. Hair Match)

Another amazing match.  Even better than their match at Backlash.  Very fast paced from the beginning.  Great finish with a lot of near falls.  In my opionion, one of the top ten matches of the year.  (9/10)

6. Triple H vs. Chris Jericho (Hell In A Cell)

This seems to be the forgotten Hell In  A Cell match.  Again, I feel it was one of the top ten matches of the year.  There is a lot of blood, sick moves, announce table bumps, and weapon use.  Referee Tim White takes a nasty bump in this match.  The match even goes onto the top of the cage.  Awesome finish.  (9.5/10)

7. Rikishi & Rico vs. Billy & Chuck (Tag Titles)

Rico was actually a ""surprise"" partner of Rikishi in this match (although everyone knew it would be him). Horrible match.  (4/10)

8. Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs. Undertaker (Undisputed Title)

Not the best match, but it is pretty cool to see Taker and Hogan wrestle again.  Vince makes an appearance in the match.  Nothing too exciting.  (7/10)

If you can find this DVD, pick it up.  It will be worthwhile for the Hair vs. Hair match and the Hell In A Cell match, as they are two of the best matches of the year.

1395590,5,B000055ZKB,"Judgment Day broke out in May of 2001.  It was a great pay per view with few flaws.  The first match unfortunatly is one of them.  William Regal vs. Rikishi, its an ok match but you really feel like your wasting your time.  The 2nd match should have been one of the main events.  Its a 2 out of 3 falls match featuring Kurt Angle & Chris Benoit for Angle's gold medals.  The stipulation were that the first match would be a first fall match.  The 2nd would be a submission match, & if it came to a 3rd, a ladder match.  Well ofcourse it goes to a third, and the two put on a awesome match.  Kurt Angle does a spectaculor job in his first ever ladder match.
A Triple Threat Hardcore Championship match is next pitting champion Rhyno against, Test & Big Show.  Good hardcore match, featuring the men going backstage & all the usual hardcore weapons.  Rhyno gives a great gore to Big Show through a trash can.  The Women's Championship match is next.  Champion Chyna, & Lita put on the best Women's Championship match in a long time.  Lita is the only female to give it to Chyna & the results are pretty good.
The Intercontinental Championship match is next.  It features champ Triple H against Kane.  These men put on a great chain match.  It gets bloody, & violent, & the ending is good.
The Tag Team Turmoil match for the #1 Contedership for the Tag Team Championship is next.  Doesn't get really fired up until the Hardy Boyz enter.
The main event for the WWF Championship was very good.  Undertaker made sure that it would be a no holds barred match so it gets pretty violent.  Stone Cold shows why he is a great heel in this match, flicking off the crowd a number of times.
The bottom line for Judgment Day 2001 is that Kane, Triple H, Undertaker, & Stone Cold make up for there dud match at Backlash.
Strongly reccomend this one.",1088121600,3,1833,4.3352941176470585

I luckily had a friend tape this for me and I checked it out.
I wasn't very big one the matches except for
UNDERTAKER VS AUSTIN For the wwe championship.
Sadly the dead man didn't get there.  But hey!!!  I was rooting for taker since he is my favorite wwe wrestler.
Even though he didn't win the title atleast he won the wwe championship at the next Judgment Day.  Wierd coincedence hu?
HHH VS Kane in a chain match wasn't the best KANE/HHH MATCH I've ever seen.
These men have had lots and lots of battles together.
There best would have to be the one on RAW when it was HHH/Kane for Wwe championship and if kane had lost he would have had to take off his mask.
Kane won but Undertaker didn't, so I would have to say I was disapointed with this PPV.  I'm not going to review the rest of the matches But I will say they were pretty good.

Below is a review of all the matches, the overall extra features and the overall DVD, hopefully it will help you decide if you should buy this DVD or not. The review will not directly give away who wins any of the matches but the winner may seem pretty obvious by my explanations of the matches. Let me also warn you that the mystery partner for the Tag Team Turmoil Match will be revealed.
( Match Reviews )
--- Rikishi Vs William Regal ---
All though the pace during this match was good the action seemed pretty lame, I believe this match to be the opener just so the crowd could warm up by cheering for the stink face. Bad finish for an overall bad opener. (3/10)
--- Two-Out-of-Three Falls Medal Match - Chris Benoit Vs Kurt Angle ---
The action in the match picked up almost instantly as the first fall came and went very quickly, the second fall contained some good counter wrestling at a good pace but nothing compared to there many other battles. The third fall contained nothing innovative or crazy when you compare it to other ladder matches however it was still good and quite exciting at times. Still almost the entire match was very entertaining and went on at a pretty good pace, the ending is very bad to a otherwise very good match. (7.5/10)
--- Triple-Threat Hardcore Title Match - Rhyno Vs Big Show Vs Test ---
This was an slightly above average hardcore match that went around the arena and fortunately did not have any interference's. The match was not very hardcore and contained nothing breathtaking, but it was solid and contained some close pin falls. (6.5/10)
--- WWF Women's Championship Match - Chyna Vs Lita ---
This was hard-hitting for a women's match, Chyna's boob almost slipped a few times which interfered with the way she wrestled, the close boob slip will also distract most if not all viewers from the actual match. I believe the wrong person won but still it was good for a WWE women's match. (6/10)
--- WWF Intercontinental Title Chain Match - Triple H Vs Kane ---
This was a very good match with some hard hitting action and a very good use of the chain, the crowd was well into the end of this match as it was very exciting to watch. Kane did not duck Austin's Interference chair shot yet Austin still hit Triple which made no sense, Its all right though, this match gave me and will probably give you more then you expect. (7/10)
--- Tag Team Turmoil Match to Determine the #1 Contenders for The Tag Team Titles - A.P.A Vs Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit Vs The Dudley Boyz Vs Edge and Christian Vs The Hardy Boyz Vs The Radicalz Vs X-Factor ---
The length was good for a match containing 7 tag-teams however some teams came and went to quickly, the first few falls mostly contained power moves so that the beginning matches could go at a shorter length. There where not many double team moves however there where some cool ones. I believe that to many teams won by interference's, the end to the Jericho and Benoit Vs X-Factor part of match is great. This match could've been quite a bit better not to say it was awful at all, Chris Benoit and Jericho came out of this match looking pretty well together. (6.5/10)
--- No-Holds-Barred Match for the WWF Championship - Stone Cold Steve Austin Vs The Undertaker ---
This match was more hardcore then the actual hardcore match before it, it contained tons of hard chair shots and the announce table, as well as a few other dirty tricks. The pace during the middle of this match seemed to go rather slowly but I guess for these two main event wrestlers its ok. The Interference's went well with this match however I think Kane should've helped his brother a bit at the end. Again Austin had to look stupid missing a chair shot, this time because Undertaker did not duck when he should have. Overall a pretty good main event and possibly the best encounter between these two wrestlers. (6/10)
( Extra Features )
The extras on this DVD are lacking, it contains 5 Extra Interviews from Sunday Night Heat, match histories which are already in the pay per view anyway and the Kurt Angle medal ceremony from Raw the night after this judgement day. The medal ceremony is easily the best extra feature as it is pretty funny and contains a awesome angle slam, however it does not save the extras from being anything more then lacking. (3.5/10)
( Overall DVD )
This event is not worth picking up for its extra features however the event does contain some good matches that are worth watching at least once. I believe this DVD is especially good for Chris Benoit fans as he shines in this pay per view. The DVD is average and may be worth picking up for some fans, however if you do not buy many WWE DVD's then I would recommend looking into other events, still you should make your own decision on whether you would like to see the above matches or not.",1054080000,5,4970,4.498893805309734
1395594,4,B000055ZKB,"I actually really enjoyed this event, for one reason or another. The crowd was REALLY into it. Out of 5 stars. . .
Rikishi vs. William Regal. 2 stars, not sure why this match just HAD to happen on the PPV. It is fairly entertaining until, GASP, a screwjob ending in a William Regal match!?
2 out of 3 Falls Medal Match: Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit. 4 and a half stars, very good display by both athletes. Not their technical field day from WrestleMania, but still having a few slow spots which brings it down.
Hardcore Championship: Rhyno (c) vs. Big Show vs. Test. 3 stars, entertaining match, but kept a bit too short. Wouldn't the gore at the end have hurt Rhyno just as bad, or worse, than Big Show?
Women's Championship: Chyna (c) vs. Lita. 3 stars, Lita gets an amazing pop, but the WWF decides to keep the belt on Chyna, having Lita job all the way. It would make sense to give the belt to somebody else if the holder is leaving, wouldn't it?
IC Championship Chain Match: Triple H (c) vs. Kane. 4 stars, an awesome match with some great spots, but definitely not an all time classic. Still very fun to watch.
Tag Team Turmoil: APA vs. Radicalz vs. Dudleyz vs. Hardyz vs. X-Factor vs. Edge & Christian vs. Jericho & Benoit. 3 and a half stars, as good as a tag team turmoil could be, but nothing outstanding here. Where does Chris Benoit get the energy?
WWF Championship: Stone Cold (c) vs. Undertaker. 3 and a half stars, good match, if not a little predictable, but even the botched ending can't take away from a solid match.
In conclusion, this was a good show which served its purpose: to hold the fans over until the annual disappointment; King of the Ring.",1041033600,4,1668,4.401294498381877
1395605,2,B000055ZKB,"This PPV was O.K. but not worth buying on home video. I rented this and watched it. I would not recommend anyone buying this. Just rent it like I did. It's not worth your money. The Undertaker takes on Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWE Championship in a no-holds-barred match. This match wasn't as good as I expected. It only gets good near the end when The Undertaker starts beating everybody up with a steel chair (Vince McMahon, Steve Austin, and Triple H). If you ever wanted to see Stone Cold wrestling as a heel (bad guy)  then you'll need to see this matchup.  Triple H takes on Kane for the Intercontinental Championship in a chain match. This match also could've been a heck of a lot better than it was. Triple H gets ""busted open"" in this match, but nothing much here. This was probably this best match on this PPV.  The triple-threat match for the Hardcore title - Test vs. The Big Show vs. Rhino - was boring and pathetic. William Regal takes on Rikishi in the very 1st match on the card, and ends up getting the 'stinky face' from the 'phat man'. Regal gets his head slammed onto the steel ring steps and he begins bleeding a little bit. Lita takes on Chyna for the Women's title in a fairly good match. I wish Lita would've won this match since Chyna later retired from wrestling.  This PPV wasn't so bad, but it was fair. I've seen better. Rent this video, but don't buy it.

The 2/3 falls match between Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit was nice but it was kind of obvious that Kurt Angle was gonna win.  The 3-way hordcore championship between Test, Big show, and Rhyno was awesome.  Alot of weapons were being used and it showed that these 3 guys were hardcore.  The women's title between Lta and Chyna was great because Chyna(who is big and strong)finally had someone who could give her a challenge.  I loved the Chain Match between HHH and Kane because it was so brutal and pretty much all that butality went to HHH.  The 7- way tag team turmoil was okay even though nobody had rivalry except Edge and Christian and Y2J who brought his mystery partner:Chris Benoit! The one match I was really looking foward to was the WWF (WWE Today) Championship between Austin 3:16 and the Undertaker.  The match was AWESOME, it was no hold barred(anything goes), brutality, forighn objects (items used as weapons)being broke like the announce table, and even when guys interfered, Undertaker was able to resist them.

The DVD extras include 5 extra (or 'heat') interviews.  These include William Regal, Mr. McMahon, Jericho, Guerrero, and Benoit.  The interviews were good.  It also includes 4 match hitories and were nicely put together.  Got to love Benoit putting Angle's medals in a 'nice, warm place'.
The best DVD extra is a funny event on the next night on RAW.  It involves Angle and Shane McMahon and sets up their match at King Of The Ring.
Here are the matches:
1) Rikishi vs. Commissioner Regal: Good match but ended was pretty quick.  Good fan excitement though.  3.5 stars out of 5.
2) Angle vs. Benoit: Medal match 2-out-of-3 falls.  I was hoping it would be like three good length matches in one.  No such luck.  The first fall (pinfalls only) was pretty quick and almost pointless.  The next fall was better with submissions only to win.  The match did go to a third fall, a ladder match.  Nice stuff with the ladder.  Watch out for the suplex on a ladder.  4 stars.
3) Rhyno vs. Big Show vs. Test: Hardcore champ match.  Nice hardcore stuff but seemed underpaced not as exciting as usual.  Hardcore matches are better one-on-one.  3 stars.
4) Chyna vs. Lita: Women's Champ match.  Best darn women's match I've seen ever.  Fun, exciting and each lady reached a new level.  4.5 stars.
5) Triple H vs. Kane: Chain Intercontinental champ match.  Nice stuff with the chain.  More exciting then I thought.  I like the showing of Kane being human.  Don't like the unclean ending.  4 stars.
6) Tag Team Turmoil: 7 teams eliminated by pinfall.  2 teams start out (APA vs. Radicalz).  The first match were kind of short, which made sense because they need to fit all 7 teams are still make the ending nice.  Still wish some of them were longer.  Other teams include Dudleys, X-Factor, Hardyz, E & C, and Jericho and. . .can't spoil it for ya.  The last match in this was good.  4 stars.
7) Austin vs. 'Taker: WWF Champ match No Holds Barred.  Nice not great.  Lots of hardcore stuff but didn't seem very brutal.  Ending looked liek it wasn't timed well.  3.5 stars.
I use the word 'nice' alot.  It was a nice ppv.  Unfortunately for +20.00 bucks,  you want 'excellent' and 'exciting'.  Too bad.  Benoit vs. Angle could have been great.  Austin vs. 'Taker could have been brutal as No Way Out's 3 stages of Hell.",1001203200,,2521,4.568539325842696

The first fall is straight wrestling, the second fall is submission only, and the third (if neccessary), a ladder match.  This match brought out the best in two of the best wrestlers in the WWF.  They definately deserved to be a headliners and not middle cards on this PPV.  Triple H and Kane's chain match was pretty cool but got boring fast.

7931525,5,B000055ZKB,"1.) William Regal vs Rikishi

Rikishi had recently returned prior to the PPV and turned face after giving Stephanie McMahon a Stinkface and Commissioner Regal was out for revenge on her behalf. I guess WWF realized that Rikishi didn't make a believable heel and that his heel run was ultimately a flop. Regal gets Stinkfaced and sells it to perfection. Regal puts Rikishi away with the Regal Cutter to win this quick opening match

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) 2 out of 3 Falls Match: Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit

First Fall: Pinfall Only / Second Fall: Submission Only / Third Fall: Ladder Match

This was now the third PPV bout that Angle and Benoit were fighting off at. The score was tied 1-1. Angle at Wrestlemania and Benoit at Backlash. And following Backlash, the storyline took an entertaining turn where Benoit stole Angle's gold medals that he won with a broken freakin neck and kept them.....in his tights! Angle wanted them back so this match took place for the gold medals. Benoit wins the first fall, using Kurt's Angle Slam to get the win. Angle gets the best of Benoit in the second fall with the Ankle Lock. The third fall got really violent in the Ladder Match. A variety of sick moves used involving the ladder and in the end, Angle retrieves the medals with help from Edge and Christian. A classic and one of the best 2 out of 3 Falls matches to ever happen! We'd have to wait until 2002's Unforgiven to witness Benoit and Angle butt heads again on PPV but it'd be well worth the wait

Regal is in his office being checked by a doctor for a cut on his head and threatens Regal to make the WWF Championship Match with Austin, a No Holds Barred Match. Regal scarily grants Undertaker his wish

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

3,) WWF Hardcore Triple Threat Championship Match: Test vs Big Show vs Rhyno (c)

One of my not so favorite Hardcore matches. Not too much Hardcore action going on that you'd expect from a Hardcore Match. Slight back and forth action with Rhyno getting the win, following a Gore on Big Show.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) WWF Women's Championship Match: Lita vs Chyna (c)

At the time, Lita and Chyna were probably WWF's most talented divas on the Diva's Division and this was their first time fighting for the Women's Championship. A decent match that could've been better and perhaps a bit longer. Chyna gets the win with a powerbomb on Lita. This was Chyna's last match in WWF/WWE as she'd leave the company months later. As a result, the Women's Championship would become vacant until that year's Survivor Series PPV

Kurt Angle finds Edge and Christian backstage and thanks them for helping him win the match. After Angle disappears, Edge says ""Finally. Operation: Never Have To Hear Kurt Bitch About His Medals, is complete. Really funny segment! That's why Edge and Christian were my favorite tag team back in the day

5.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Chain Match: Kane vs Triple H (c) w/Stephanie McMahon

Definitely one of Kane and Triple H's best matches along with their 2002 No Mercy encounter and their 2003 Raw match. Their 1999 matches were horrendous. Triple H gets the cheap shot in on Kane early on and works over Kane's arm (which had been kayfabe injured in the storyline at the hands of Triple H and Steve Austin). Triple H gets busted open after a sick chair collision into the turnbuckle post. Stone Cold interferes at the end and accidentally cracks Triple H over the head with a steel chair. Kane capitalizes and pins The Game to win the Intercontinental Championship

6.) #1 Contender Tag Team Turmoil Match: APA vs Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn vs The Dudley Boyz vs X-Factor vs Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit (surprise partner) vs The Hardy Boyz vs Edge and Christian

The rules of this match were that two teams would start the match off and when one team gets eliminated, the next would arrive. The winners would be the #1 Contenders for the WWF Tag Team Championships. This was a good and long Tag Team match to enjoy that showcased every major WWF Tag Team to get some tv time. The final 2 teams were Edge and Christian against Jericho and Benoit. Benoit and Jericho win after Christian taps out to the Crossface, earning a Tag Team Championship match against Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H. Benoit and Jericho would win the titles the next night on Raw, which was also the same Raw where Triple H suffered his quad injury that put him out for 8 months. Unfortunately Benoit and Jericho didn't last long as a Tag Team, as Benoit would suffer a neck injury just weeks after Triple H's quad injury, that would put him out of action for a year. It really was unfortunate because Benoit and Jericho could've been a great Tag Team in WWF. Kind of strange that at this Judgment Day they were Tag Team partners but at the previous Judgment Day in 2000 they were enemies

7.) WWF Championship No Holds Barred Match: The Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)

The Undertaker and Stone Cold had a tremendous feud in 1998 and 1999 and we were lucky to see it renewed for a short stint in 2001. Making the match a No Holds Barred Match was probably best for this match as I'm sure the amazing build-up for this feud wouldn't have paid off with just a normal match. Similar to the 1999 Fully Loaded First Blood match between the 2, Vince McMahon came out to do commentary for the match, who would play a factor in the end of the match. Honestly, this match was great. I'd put it in my top 3 with the other 2 being their 1998 SummerSlam and 1999 Fully Loaded matches. Triple H comes to the ring and attacks Undertaker with his sledgehammer and Kane comes out for the save but he's 2 seconds too late as Austin retains the the title, following help from Triple H and McMahon. It was quite a disappointing way for fans to end the PPV as I'm sure most would've loved to have seen Judgment Day close with the Brothers of Destruction in the ring as champions. Somewhat of a bitter way to end a sweet PPV

Overall: Not much bad to say about this event. An amazing 2 out of 3 Falls match, a quick and decent divas match, an okay Hardcore match, great Tag Team Turmoil match, the Chain Match was good, and the main event was a classic. I give Judgment Day 2001 a 5/5",1399420800,,6945,5.162956366874443
7931526,3,B000055ZKB,"The William Regal-Rikishi match was BORING! The 2 out of 3 falls match between Kurt Angle & Chris Beniot while the 1st two bouts were good,the ladder match part was mediocre. The Triple Threat match for the Hardcore title(Rhyno vs Test vs Big Show) was just your basic hardcore bout but a good one none the less. The Women's title match between Chyna & Lita was interesting. The Chain match for the Intercontinental title between Triple H & Kane was just kind of series of spots rather then a real match. The #1 contenders Tag Team Turmoil match was pretty good with the final match being the best one of all. The No Holds Barred match for the Worlds title between The Undertaker & Steve Austin was not great but pretty good. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1357344000,,756,4.368794326241135
7931527,5,B000055ZKB,"The Year 2001 brought many great thing to the WWE such as WrestleMania X-Seven, the best WrestleMania, the WCW and ECW Invasion, and this very entertaining Pay Per View. Overall, I give this event a regular 4 stars. The extra star is because I could sit through this entire event without getting bored of it. I loved EVERY MINUTE OF IT!!!!! To be honest, that is very rare for me.

1. Commissioner William Regal vs. Rikishi (3:57)
William Regal came out first and stated that as commissioner, he can make bad things happen to Rikishi if he chose to give him the Stinkface. Rikishi came out to many cheers by the crowd. The match is under way. This was pretty much a squash match with Rikishi taunting and crushing Regal. Biggest pop was when Rikishi put the stinkface on Regal. Overall, a funny match and something that isn't hard to sit through. 4/10

Before the next match would start you see Edge and Christian talking then Kurt Angle comes and asks for advice. He says he knows that they are the experts on the Ladder match and asks them for advice if he he even makes it to the third fall (Which is a Ladder match) and says even though he won't, what should he do. The brothers just say don't look or fall down then walk away.

2. 2 out of 3 Falls Match for Kurt Angle's Gold Medals:
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit (23:58)
This match all started at WrestleMania X-Seven when Angle and Benoit had one of the best matches in WrestleMania history and one of the best technical matches of all time. Angle cheated to pick up the win then. Next month, Angle and Benoit would have a lost classic 31 Minute Ultimate Submission match at Backlash. Benoit won then. After that, the two had a 2 out of 3 falls match at the worst WWE event of all time, InsurreXtion 2001. It wasn't that good. Once again, Benoit wins. The rivalry gets interesting when the two have this big brawl on RAW and Benoit steals Angle's medals and shoves them in his pants. Angle gets furious now and the two start brwaling crazy. Thus, this match was created.

Fall 1: Singles match: This was about a minute long. Quickly, Benoit would but in the Crippler Crossface and make Angle tap.
Fall 2: Submission Match: This match started quckly and was taken to the outside. Benoit pretty much wrecked Angle then Angle visciously started banging his head on the anounce table. Once they brought it back to the ring they turned it into a technical match with exchanging suplexes all around. Eventually Angle put on the Ankle Lock to make Benoit Tap
Fall 3: Ladder Match: The best and final part of this Match. The Olympic Gold Medals were hanging from the cieling like a normal ladder match.  These men put great use into a one ladder after taking things back to the outside another time. They hit and crished each other with this one ladder just back and forth and brutal. Benoit hits a big move on Angle to give him the oppurtunity to climb the Ladder. Then out of nowhere, Edge and Christian come to Angles aid and knock Benoit off the Ladder. They keep working on Benoit and give Angle the win and his medals. 9/10

3. Triple Threat Match for the Hardcore Championship
Rhyno(c) vs. The Big Show vs. Test (9:13)
First Test comes out to the ring. Then out comes the Big Show. Before the Champ comes out the other two fight in the ring and Big Show knocks Test on to the outside. Rhyno then runs to the ring a this match is started. Rhyno brings in the steel steps. Big show knocks them out of the ring and the three fight out there. They take it to the crowd and next thing you know they're backstage. The highlight here was Rhyno and Test double team Big Show and he falls onto a wood pallet. Hes out. From there they take it to the ring and do finishers to each other also with use of the steel steps, steel trash cans, steel trash can lids and a fire extinguisher. Great hardcore match 8.5/10

4. Womens Championship Match
Chyna(c) vs. Lita (6:30)
I would normally say I don't care about these matches but this one wasn't bad. It had a short promo. Like I said this entire event was entertaining so I sat through it. 6/10

5. Intercontinental Championship Chain Match
Triple H(c) vs. Kane (12:27)
This a good match and I thought it would be lame. Both men made great use of the chain. Kane was mostly dominating Triple H but Kane didn't have all of the upper hand. They even brought a steel chair into the match.  Towards the end Stone Cold interfered and it made the match even more interesting. Watch this. 9/10

6. Tag Team Turmoil Match for the World Tag Team Championship:
The APA vs. The Radicalz vs. The Dudleys vs. The X-Factor vs. The Hardyz vs. Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit vs. Edge and Christian: (32:09)
The highlight here was the APA taking out 2 different teams. The APA got eliminated by the X-Factor and they cheated. Then the Hardy Boyz would come out to almost beat the X-Factor cheated with the help of Albert, again. Next would be Chris Jericho and his mystery partner, CHRIS BENOIT!!!! It got very good here with outside action and suplexes Benoit and Jericho would eliminate them by putting their submission holds on both of them and they tapped. Finally, the moment we've waiting for... Edge and Christian come out to Chris Benoit punishing them for what they did earlier in the night. In the end, Benoit and Jericho would come out on top. I know I left out so much of this match but, well you gotta get the DVD. 9/10

7. WWF Championship No Disqualification Match:
Stone Cold Steve Austin(c) vs. The Undertaker (23:05)
We got the match of the night here in an incredible match up. This was intense and went all over the outside of the ring. The main weapon used here was themselves and a chair. Spots included Undertaker sending Austin through the announce table or Undertakers chair rampage when Triple H came in. Like I said once agian, ENTERTAINMENT ON DVD PEOPLE!!!!!!! 10/10",1314144000,,5868,4.474766355140187

Match 7: Steve Austin (c) defeated The Undertaker (No Holds Barred match for the WWF Championship)
Rating: 7.5/10- Expected finish, as usual Austin goes on top thanks to Triple H. Good match, ending is a bit foolish on WWF's part. Kane and Undertaker at this time were fuding with HHH and Austin. HHH comes to help Austin and helps him win the match, but Kane comes out to help Undertaker when Austin is pinning Undertaker and it is obviously WAY too late.

7931529,4,B000055ZKB,"***NOTE - This is a review of the VHS tape.  I didn't wanna pay this much money for the DVD.***

My favorite years in WWF/WWE history are 2001 and 2002.  So, I blindly swallowed my buyer's caution, and just bought this PPV on a whim.  I should've been more careful, considering I think WRESTLEMANIA 17 is overrated, and also since BACKLASH 2001 wasn't exactly the greatest event in Chicago history, either.

JUDGMENT DAY is a good card, but is it worth this much money?

1) William Regal (WWF Commissioner) v. Rikishi
---The more I read other Amazon reviews, the more I realize that people hate pointless grudge matches like this.  I didn't watch this match for the story; I sat through it because I really like both wrestlers.  But my fellow fans & reviewers are right about this one.  There really is no reason to go out of your way to check this opener out.  I wasn't bored, but other than Regal's bloody forehead, I couldn't tell you what else happened.
""5.0 / 10""
------------------------------------

2) Two-Out-of-Three Falls Match
(Pinfall Only / Submission Match / Ladder Match)
Winner Keeps The Olympic Gold Medals
Kurt Angle v. Chris Benoit
---I'm guessing you already know what a great series of matches these men had in their careers, so let's move onto this particular encounter.  I hate to spoil things, but you might be disappointed that the pinfall victory occurs in less than 2 minutes.  But trust me, once the Submission Match begins, you won't care.  It allows both men to try to outperform their BACKLASH Ultimate Submission Match, and in my opinion, they come close.  And when the Ladder Match begins (don't even pretend you didn't know it would), Angle proves that he indeed can compete in this style of match if he had to.  This is the main reason to buy this DVD.  Most will say that JUDGMENT DAY 2001 is the least of the Angle/Benoit encounters; I say you should watch them all.
""8.5 / 10""
------------------------------------

3) Hardcore Championship
Test v. Big Show v. Rhyno (champion)
---If you want the epitome of disappointment, look no further.  Surely, these three tough-as-nails competitors could've done more than a punch-kick brawl all over the arena.  I know WWF thought ""hardcore"" simply meant ""Falls Count Anywhere"", but gimme a break.  Other than the last few moments - ironically, when everybody returns to the ring - there isn't anything remarkable about this one.
""3.0 / 10""
------------------------------------

4) Women's Championship
Lita v. Chyna (champion)
---If you're a fan of Chyna's (which I was), then this is a good one.  If you're not, then this might not change your mind.  I never expected Chyna to be a technical competitor; the fact that she could fistfight and lift some male wrestlers was enough for me.  I liked the power/speed contrast between both ladies.  Unfortunately, there is an over-exaggerated issue where one of Chyna's breasts kept slipping out of her costume, which prevents the ladies from going all out.  Also, because this is pre-injury Lita, you can expect more dynamic work than in her later career.
""7.0 / 10""
------------------------------------

5) Chain Match - Intercontinental Championship
Triple H (champion) v. Kane
---Boy, did these guys beat the crap out of each other, or what?  Like the classic Angle/Shane Street Fight that occurred one month later, the sheer amount of punishment these two inflict is unbearable.  I never liked any HHH/Kane matches that I can remember, but this is one exceptional exception.  Now, this isn't the most hardcore or brutal match I've ever seen.  But I think fans of the old ECW will have a blast watching this!
""8.0 / 10""
------------------------------------

6) Tag Team Turmoil
The APA v. Dean Malenko & Perry Saturn v.
The Dudley Boyz v. X Factor v. The Hardy Boyz
v. Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit v. Edge & Christian
---This number-one contender event is truly a mixed bag.  On the one hand, there is a tremendous amount of talent, and each gets a good few minutes to make their mark on the match.  There are times when this gauntlet-style showcase reminds you of the tag team classics that we saw in late 2002.  But on the other hand, there are times where this match is incredibly sloppy and hard to follow.  I honestly think that this match kept alternating between two extremes: confusing mishmash & legendary presentation, and rarely the two shall meet.  Overall, this is a good display of the Fed's tag team division, but there are moments where you'll stare at disbelief, and wonder how the quality suddenly sunk.
""7.0 / 10""
------------------------------------

7) No Holds Barred - WWF Championship
""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (champion) v. The Undertaker
---First off, I give all the credit in the world for Taker and Austin giving their absolute best for the 25 minutes they gave us.  They used everything from weapons & tables, to fists and mat-style wrestling.  This isn't the poor lazy effort we saw from BACKLASH 2002.  However, I have two huge complaints that totally ruined it for me.  For starters, the interference from Vince McMahon and Triple H would've been predicted by someone who knew nothing about wrestling.  Instead of being a suspenseful turn of events, I just kept waiting for the finish because I knew everything else was inconsequential.  But secondly, I wasn't all that interested in the match itself.  Taker and Austin kept going at it for an endless amount of time, I just couldn't keep track.  Here's the bottom line: the pickier the wrestling fan you are, the less you'll like this main event.  I admit I probably gave this one way too much thought, but 25 mintues is a long time to digest what's going on.

OVERALL
---JUDGMENT DAY 2001 is a pretty good PPV, but not worth the amount of money that people are asking for on Amazon.  It's worth the standard $20 price tag; anything more is pure retail markup.  This is one of those PPVs that if you choose to pay the money, you'll have a good time, but it's not a must-own event.",1222646400,2,6039,4.8429268292682925
7931530,5,B000055ZKB,"Rikishi VS William Regal: Regal was really nice when I met him in person, but he can play a heel better then anyone in the WWF/WWE. Rikishi almost gets a stinkface within a few minutes but Regal hit a low blow. I didn't see the low blow but luckily they replayed it a few minutes later. Rikishi hits the stinkface and Regal makes an awesome face afterwards. A quick match but fun.

Kurt Angle VS Chris Benoit in a 3 Stages of Hell match: Two of the finest wrestlers ever. Would you expect a bad match from these two? Edge and Christian help out Angle to win but it really didn't take away from the match.

Then we got a promo with Jerry Lynn, the light heavyweight champion. Really Lynn worked all of his life for this worthless belt? He goes off on JR, then goes into a heavy metal growl saying Judgement Day, then he says just watch him. What ever happened after this?

Test VS Rhyno VS Big Show: What WWE is lacking this days, the hardcore division. It started off as a joke but towards the end, they got serious with it. This was a great match even though I don't care for Test or Rhyno. Rhyno might have been good in ECW but his career never took off after ECW folded- either in WWF/WWE or TNA. He was a world champion in TNA for a short time and then sent back to the midcard.

Chyna VS Lita: Both women can wrestle, but I never watch women wrestling.

Kane VS HHH in a Chain Match: Overall, a good match and im glad Kane won it.

The Radicals vs APA vs The Dudley Boys vs The X Factor vs Hardy Boys vs Edge and Christan vs Chris Jerhico and Chris Benoit: This match is featured on alot of WWE PPV's for some reason. This one had the most talented tag teams and it was a classic. Benoit and Jericho win in a predictable ending but I still enjoyed it.

Steve Austin VS Undertaker: It was made a No DQ match during this PPV. I liked Undertaker putting Austin thru the table with a chokeslam, alot of vicious chair shots, a great brawl overall. I just hated the ending.

A really good PPV overall that was stacked from top to bottom.",1210464000,,2036,4.176020408163265
7931531,5,B000055ZKB,"WWF continued their streak of great PPVs in 2001 as this was one of the best shows of the year to the point where it's a shame that it was forgotten later in the year due to the Invasion angle taking up the rest of the year.

Rikishi vs William Regal. This was a short but enjoyable match as Rikishi was injured during this time while Regal makes some of the funniest faces after receiving a stinkface.

3 Stages of Hell Medals Match: Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit. The first fall was a pinfall only match that Benoit won in less than a minute. The second fall was a submission match while the third was a ladder match with the gold medals being hung above the ring. Angle & Benoit never had a bad match as this was one of the best matches of the year with these two putting on an awesome performance along with telling a great story of Kurt being behind early in the match & having to catch up to Benoit along with Edge & Christian making a cameo in the end.

Hardcore Champion Rhyno vs Big Show vs Test. This was one of those matches where they spent more time out of the ring than they did inside as they brawled in the crowd, went to the backstage area & eventually returned back to the ring to use weapons like trash cans, a fire extinguisher, & steel steps to make their moves more impactful. An enjoyable match but one moment to check out is Rhyno's gore to the Big Show using the trash can for impact.

WWF Women's Champion Chyna vs Lita. This was Chyna's best match during her reign as champion due to the fact that Lita was able to bring out a good performance out of Chyna instead of being reduced to squash like most of Chyna's matches.

Chain Match: Intercontinental Champion Triple H vs Kane. Before they went through a dumb storyline in 2002, they gave an awesome performance in this chain match as they really beat the living hell out of each other to the point where Triple H was rammed into the post while he had a chair in his hand that busted him open. The ending featured Stone Cold Steve Austin getting involved & accidently hitting his own partner to give Kane his first Intercontinental championship.

Tag Team Turmoil. This was the best turmoil match that the WWF had done as there were many series of matches & situations going on here. Moments include some decent wrestling between the Radicals & APA, the interaction between the Dudleyz & the Hollys that lead to D-Von getting the Alabama slam through the table, The Hardyz putting on a good performance with X-Pac & Justin Credible with Albert getting involved in their matches. However, the big story here was Chris Jericho getting Chris Benoit as his partner & having two good matches including against Edge & Christian which is something considering Benoit just had a three stages of hell match.

No Holds Barred: WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs The Undertaker. Undertaker threatened William Regal earlier in the night to make this a No Holds Barred match that Austin accepted without concern. This was just an intense & physical brawl with Austin actually working on the legs at one point & even delivering more lowblows than I can ever recall seeing in a match as this match ranks up with their SummerSlam & First Blood matches as my favorite encounter between these two with Vince McMahon doing commentary & Triple H getting involved at the end.

DVD extras include promos, skits from Sunday Night Heat & Kurt Angle's Medals Ceremony that was interrupted by Shane McMahon that lead to their street fight a month later at King of the Ring.

In the end, this was my favorite Judgment Day event of them all & one of the best from 2001 that is worth going out of your way to see.",1207526400,,3665,4.466367713004484
7931532,4,B000055ZKB,"Judgment Day 2001 was yet another great ppv during the last full year of the wwf. With several titles on the line, including Stone Cold Steve Austin putting the WWF title on the line against the Undertaker as well as Kane and HHH figing it out in a chain match for the Intercontinental championship...

Rikishi vs. William Regal:
I was not much of a fan of Rikishi when he was still around, but the crowd did enjoy seeing Regal suffer a lot during this match! Rikishi gives Regal the stinkface much to Regal's horror! Regal even gets cut open near the end of the match but still manages to win by pinning the big man. 7.5/10

3 Stages of Hell
Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit:
After a great submission match between these two just one month earlier, they met again in a best of 3 falls match. the first match was a normal wrestling match, in which Benoit won. The second was submission match which Angle won. The third was a ladder match where Angle's gold medals were on the line. Angle gets the win in another great chapter of one of my favorite rivalries. 9/10

Hardcore Championship
Test vs. Rhyno (champion) vs. Big Show:
A good hardcore title match fought between these three men. a lot of back and forth action, including the three of them fighting backstage and using weapons all over the place. In the end Rhyno gets the win after goring The Big Show through a trash can and gets the win. 8/10

Women's Championship
Chyna (champion) vs. Lita:
A good match between these two former WWE divas. A lot of back and forth action and Lita uses her high flying ability to try and take down the massive looking chyna. However at the end Chyna gives Lita a vicious powerbomb and later gets the win to retain the championship. 7.10

Intercontinental Championship
Chain Match
Kane vs. HHH(champion):
A great match between these two involving the chain and a steel chair. HHH tried to take down the monster, who was wrestling with a broken arm, but Kane used his strength and power to take down the Game. A lot of hard hitting shots took place in this match, including one sick spot with the chair and HHH. At the end of the match Stone Cold comes down to the ring but hits HHH with a chair by accident and Kane gets the win and the IC title. 9/10

Tag Team Turmoil Match
The Radicals vs The APA vs The Dudley boys vs The x factor vs the Hardy Boys vs Edge and Christan vs Crhis Jerhico and Chris Benoit:ot
A lot of great moments in this match. One of my favorites is when D-Von Dudley gets an Alabama Slam through a table by Hardcore holly. The ending of the match had Edge and Christian vs. Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho. The ending is great as Benoit and Jericho get the titles after beating E and C. 8.5/10

WWF Championship
Stone Cold Steve Austin (champion) vs. The Undertaker
Not the best these two have put on, but still a very good match. The undertaker at one point chokeslams Austin through the announce table! Mr. McMahon tried to get involved but Austin nailed him with a chair by accident! In the end Taker tries to hit the last ride powerbomb to Austin but HHH comes down and hits Taker with a sledgehammer to get the win. 9/10

This is really hard to get on DVD. Took me a couple of days and several different video stores before I finally found a used version that still had the WWF logos on it. Still a good buy if you can find it, highly recommended",1182124800,,3360,4.373397435897436
