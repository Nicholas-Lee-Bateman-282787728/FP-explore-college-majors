1898146,1,B00009YXEQ,"RODENTZ is almost so bad that its good.  Especially the hilarious giant rat that looks like someone running around in a rat suit.  Guy Vieg, who plays the professor, looks like he needs a good hit of Pepto Bismol; Aaron Haff, who tries to generate some life into Walter, merely looks dazed and confused.  The rest of the cast, oh boy....where did they find them?  And notice that in the outdoor scenes, there are no other people or cars around.  The director also likes to segue into action scenes by showing the same silhouetted moon and cars going 160 miles on the freeway.  A lame excuse for a horror movie that doesn't quite make cult cheez status.",1081036800,4,652,4.52991452991453
1898147,2,B00009YXEQ,"Have you ever heard of a formula for a horror movie or a teen movie?  In theory, a movie following this formula would be very predictable and uninteresting because horror movies succeed by being unpredictable.  This movie was predictable, and the movie was low budget, which means that there really is little going for it.
If you are a horror aficionado, then you would probably appreciate a low-budget movie about science gone awry.  However, the script and special effects used here seem to detract from the fun of a low-budget movie.  The chief scientist seems very irritable as he is questioned, as if he were hiding something.  Unfortunately, if he was, the secret is never revealed leaving the viewer to assume that the scientist is just an irritable old man.
 Non-professional actors can add humor to a low-budget flick, but seeing these actors do their best to emote but it left me confused about what I was supposed to think about the different characters.  There seemed to be an attempt at a background, but it was never made cleared to the viewer.
The commentary on the DVD was not very helpful in understanding the movie.
I would not recommend this movie unless you are a horror fan who likes low-budget films.",1077321600,2,1222,4.76303317535545
1898148,3,B00009YXEQ,"I love cheesy corny horror movies and this was both. From the 30 something year old actresses that were supposed to be college age to the giant fake rat clinging to the top of a moving vehicle, I enjoyed it in all of it's stupid splendor. I thought it was very funny.",1070064000,2,267,4.153846153846154
1898149,1,B00009YXEQ,"Even though I got this DVD at a rock bottom price I felt ripped off. The scariest thing about it is the cover of the DVD. The scenes in which the super rats attack their victims are poorly done, the camera moves rapidly back and forth during these attacks. This is obviously due to how un-graphic the gore factor is. You see blood but it's on a PG-13ish level. We are also to believe that rats climb walls and bite through metal cage wire. Rats climbing walls is an urban legend, when I was younger I bred rats. There were times that I had 30 at one time. These rats were simular in appearance to the ones in this film. Never once did any of them climb the walls. I guess the lab researchers injection was suppose to make them super rodents. After the janitor and one of the researchers are tripped by the rats (yes, tripped) and then eaten, we then realize that the van load of twenty something year old victims are just on time to lend a hand in the rise of the bodycount. The back of the DVD packaging says ""has all the makings of your worst rodent nightmare"", don't believe that, It's a classic case of false advertising. I don't recommend this film to anyone, it is worse than moldy cheese.",1067644800,2,1195,4.292035398230088
1898150,1,B00009YXEQ,"One of the worst movies ever. Talk about bad computer generated effects. This movie has the worst. The effects are cartoonish at best. The only thing worse than the computer generated effects are the ones done the good old fashioned way which appear to be close-ups of somebody's house slippers.
There are several other movies like this available that are much better films, ""The Rats"" for instance.
I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",1065139200,5,442,4.986486486486487

1898172,3,B00009YXEQ,"After an experimental serum is injected into common rats, they are transformed into CGI-enhanced, super rats. After shredding a cat and a janitor, the RODENTZ are ready for action. One of the scientists at the lab gets a bit too curious, and must be dealt w/ rat-style! Meanwhile, a group of 30yo ""teens"" are out partying, on their way to a party in their par-tee van. They drop by the laboratory to visit their scientist friend, Walter. Little do they know, these RODENTZ are about to poop all over their party! Shockingly, the fact that not one of these ""teens"" has a discernible IQ figures directly into their lowered chances of survival. Rule number one should have been: No idiots in the lab! Instead, they are allowed to wander around, getting into trouble. Thankfully, the super-charged RODENTZ happen to love the tender flesh of imbeciles! The problem w/ this movie is that in between the rat-on-human slaughter, things get very, VERY boring. The characters just aren't interesting enough to keep one riveted. Even w/ the addition of squirting blood and female nudity, RODENTZ is a cinematic migraine. Extra points for the giant mega-rat. He's sort of a rat-zilla or franken-rat!

1898173,1,B00009YXEQ,"""Rodentz"" (also known as ""Altered Species"") is a nigh-unbearable lab-animals-run-amok film starring a bunch of unknowns. This film will, no doubt, help their careers delve even deeper into obscurity. The film has a run of the mill plot about Professor Irwin (Guy Vieg) conducting laboratory experiments that go horribly awry, in this case producing super-aggressive gigantic mutant rats (or is that ratz?) The film features some cartoonish CGI, some hilarious rat costuming, lots of repeated footage of actual rodents in cages, and some of the worst acting on record.

The film is not only poorly conceived and executed, it's so boring that I had to watch it with the Spanish subtitles on to make it interesting enough to prevent dozing off (I knew three years of Spanish would finally come in handy some day.) The film does raise some interesting questions, such as how do rats electrocute a college student? All will be revealed (although not as realistically as you might wish.) The scary deserted science building with state of the art labs but no method of contacting the outside world is increasingly infested with lamer and lamer looking rats which continuously outsmart the collegiate twenty-something cast members. Sadly, this is the most believable part of the plot. Having spent a lot of time in college and professional labs, I was also interested to learn that half-length fishnet stockings were appropriate lab attire.

After hearing the name ""Gary"" yelled about a zillion times, the failure of a chemical warfare rodental elimination technique, and various annoying cast members being picked off in turn, a couple of the students end up in an elevator surrounded by bloodthirsty rats. What would the best course of action be? Surely for leading man Allen Lee Haff to climb up the elevator cables to chew on wiring in a fire alarm, resulting on the siren going off and causing the rats to die from blood shooting out of their ears. Obviously. While that was obvious, here's a puzzler they couldn't figure out: if you put on a gas mask and there's a rat inside it that starts to bite your face, should you attempt to take the mask off? This, believe it or not, required deliberation by more than one person.

Two survivors escape the building with the assistance of a homemade portable fire alarm (don't ask) and after fighting off a man in a horribly mangy flaming giant rat suit, escape in a VW Microbus. This is the only movie I am aware of that features a giant rat clawing its way through the roof of a Volkswagen of any sort, by the way. After what seems like a flaming ending to the rodental nightmare, the film closes in typical B-movie fashion with a tarantula getting into the same substance that made the rats evil and huge. While I prefer to think of that as an homage to earlier sci fi movies, it still elicited an eye roll and groan from me.

The DVD features a commentary track, but it is one of the most boring commentaries I have ever listened to. The commentary makes the point that expectations are very high of modern CGI, and that it's hard to live up to them, especially on a low-budget movie. I think that's actually a fair point, but it's also fair to point out that this movie is still a dreadful experience. It has a few high camp moments (the guy in the rat suit chief among them,) but even dedicated lovers of B-movies will find this one tough to enjoy.",1285804800,2,3394,4.699159663865546

1898175,1,B00009YXEQ,"It's bad, bad, bad. The plot is dumb, the special effects are awful.

My prayer is that the makers of this nausea-fest were only kidding, but it's never quite bad enough to make me laugh -- just turn away.

Add a point to this review if you suspect that I'm not sophisticated enough to get some fabulous inside joke that makes Rodentz high camp.

With all due respect, I don't think so. To each his own.",1190073600,,403,4.276315789473684
1898176,1,B00009YXEQ,"This ratty little fright-flick is cheesy at best. The story follows the aftermath of a lab accident, in which the furry subjects are exposed to a chemical goop that turns them into voracious, 200-lb killers who render movie producers incapable of correct spelling.

It's monumentally horiffic in every way. It's about mutant rats and of course, they start killing everyone...Great stuff...You name it, it has it, all the elements that make a horrible horror movie: Cheesy script, bad acting, gratuitous sex scene, bad gore, fake looking rat suit, fake sounding dialogue, holes in the storyline and super corny ending.

Lines like, ""We had to try to make the rats look scary, so we blew cold air on them to make them run."" I laughed so hard...And so will you if this is your thing. DO NOT watch this unless you are into cheesy movies! If you are looking for a 'good' horror movie don't watch this and don't watch it if you want to be scared.

1898178,5,B00009YXEQ,"Everybody is right about this movie. It has terrible special effects, a guy in a giant rat suit, and mistakes in the movie that don't even begin to make sense.

So why did I rate it a five?

Come on people, the title is ""Rodentz"", spelled with a Z, did you expect it to be a good movie? I rented this with a bunch of friends because we wanted to watch a crappy sci-fi movie, and thats exactly what we got. This movie is halarious when you want it to be, and that is why I rated it a five. Best movie ever",1138233600,3,504,3.883495145631068
1898179,5,B00009YXEQ,"So much action, great special effects!  And the plotline, so intriguing!!

Um, wait, I thought I was reviewing Matrix Reloaded.  Oh sorry, what's this movie?

Oh Rodentz.  Well maybe I will keep the 5 stars, and say some good stuff.  I thought that guy in the large rat suit was pretty good.  And the erector set robotic rat at the beginning was super cool.

I didn't even mind seeing the same scene over and over, I mean if it is good-why not?  We saw movie-greatness when we saw people walking through corridors one thousand times-that was very nice.

Just think of the camera work...

And the fuzzy slippers and stuffed animals that were attacking the people, those were pretty scary I thought!  I don't think I'm going to open my dresser drawers for a good long time now.

I enjoyed seeing the large rat tail also, that was pure entertainment.  Oh my gosh this would've been cool to see on the big screen, just think-an even bigger tail!

I liked this movie so much, I think I'm going to put in in my car, and try out my own amazing pyrotechnics, and I'll smile as my car and the DVD go up in flames.  Thank god those two survived.  I can't wait for Rodentz-The Rise of the Machines.

1898180,1,B00009YXEQ,"""Rodentz,"" also known as ""Altered Species,"" is one of those commodities with which lovers of bad cinema so often have a love/hate relationship. In fact, the movie could well stand as the poster child for wildly over the top, awful B-budget horror movies. The director and producers made no effort whatsoever to take any of the proceedings seriously, arguably a wise move on their part considering the atrocious levels every aspect of this film achieves. I imagine the film tried to mimic, and probably spoof in the process, every zero budget monster film made from the 1940s on, but I really, REALLY wished it hadn't failed so miserably. Why is it that every ""monster"" or ""creatures gone mad"" film released in the last few years has a low budget, bad acting, and horrible pacing? Why, when the idea of raging sharks, mad octopi, and mutated crocodiles crosses somebody's mind in Hollywood does it automatically mean a straight to video release? How many ""Shark Attack"" films will we have to wade through before someone gets the formula right? Well, I guess I am just as much to blame for the continued release of these terrible pictures as everyone else. After all, I rented ""Rodentz"" along with millions of other sheep.
""Rodentz"" does have a theme: never pour experimental growth hormones in a sink. When weary graduate student Walter dumps a beaker full of the stuff down the drain, hilarity ensues in the form of giant killer rats. Walt should have known better than to do something this stupid, but he's tired after working hours and hours on Professor Irwin's controversial growth experiment. Irwin, a cantankerous old coot who spends most of his short screen time barking orders at Walt and insisting his hormone is ""fine,"" promptly disappears after searching for his lost cat. So does an alky janitor. And so will a lot more people by the time the movie judders to an excruciating halt an eternity later. In the meantime, Walt has little idea of the carnage he has unwittingly released on the world. He continues to studiously monitor the progress of dozens of rats in cages spread across the laboratory, blithely unaware that the formula is far from ""fine"" and that crazed rats are doing the cha-cha on the janitor and the professor in other parts of the building. Oh sure, a few warning signs appear. One of the rats, for instance, begins to gain weight at a frightening pace after receiving an injection of the tainted hormone. Don't worry, though. Walt is only slightly concerned about this alarming development. Irwin, before his untimely passing, isn't concerned at all.
Meanwhile, a group of Walt's friends (sigh) head out for some evening fun. With nothing more than that youthful insouciance, a jug of tequila, and a gallon of hair gel, Walt's pals head over to the lab to pick up their hardworking amigo. The group consists of Walter's girlfriend, another girl who fulfills the obligatory ""catty"" role, and two loud mouthed jerks. Well soused by the time they arrive to get Walt, they bully their way into the lab in an effort to convince the grad student to join them. Walter, unaware that Irwin expired some time ago, tries to keep them out. But you know how it is when a script calls for mayhem; the Chinese army couldn't keep these four kids out of trouble. Predictably, oh so predictably, the carnage begins. The catty girl is the first one to run into the king daddy of the mutated rats, a creature grown to a height of roughly seven feet with teeth the size of daggers. She's one of the lucky ones, though, despite having her face completely chewed away. At least she gets the chance to bow out of this movie early on, a chance denied to Walt and his girlfriend. Panic follows, as do chase scenes and the mandatory ""here's how we can save the world from the rats"" idea before the movie mercifully ends. I will never, never manage to burn that cheesy image of a seven foot tall burned rat riding on top of a van. Somebody help me. Please.
It is difficult to put my finger on one specific nightmare that makes ""Rodentz"" such a forgettable picture, but I'll try. Let's start with the acting. It's bad, and not in a ""so bad, it's good"" way. I could forgive a film if the actors made me laugh with over the top performances. Instead, this film's thespians manage to irritate on a regular basis. Special mention goes to the Gary character; a guy who gets so far under your skin it would take a chainsaw to get the memory of him out. He's annoying in the extreme, and may well rank as one of the most annoying characters in the history of B moviedom. The horror of Gary nearly obscures the many other faults of the film, but not quite. Plot holes abound (How did the rats know how to chew through the phone lines? How did the power come back on?), and the editing is uniformly poor (check out those lousy reaction shots). The CGI effects look rather pathetic, too. Overall, I would say ""Rodentz"" is an experience akin to having a root canal without any anesthesia.
The DVD has a commentary track from the director, but I couldn't bear to listen to it. I've decided to abandon my usual ""Oh the humanity"" tag line for a one star movie review starting with ""Rodentz."" In its place, I'm going to start using ""The horror...the horror"" from ""Apocalypse Now."" I think that line, summing up all the mental trauma of senseless brutality in war on the human mind, is an adequate one to describe this and other cinematic atrocities. You'd do well to stay far away from ""Rodentz.""",1082332800,3,5485,4.6440329218107
7994389,3,B00009YXEQ,When I watch a science-fiction  or horror movies I usually don't expect anything earth shattering or fantastic. I usually expect change of pace not too serious maybe some Gore and fun.  That's what this movie pretty much was. It reminds you of the science fiction  or horror movies from the 50s and 60s. Pretty much what you expect from science fiction or low-budget horror.  Like the stuff you see on the Syfy channel. I liked it.,1489017600,,431,4.631578947368421

7994391,4,B00009YXEQ,"I was not expecting this movie to be over-the-top action with phenomenal special effects and memorable characters and in a way it was not, but surprisingly it is not a bad movie.

The story was okay; it is about these rats that are being experimented on for science and one of the rats--named Brenda--gets injected with an unusual dosage of hormone growth. The rats are exposed to this green goo and establish a knack to kill and feed off victims who mostly make loud sounds in the environment.

The introduction may appear to start off very slow to build up the atmosphere and the setting, but after some time the premise for the movie stuck well. It focuses on two separate stories between a doctor and the smart student, and a group of his friends that were always getting in trouble with alcohol and amorous situations later in the film. It was clear on who was going to survive and who was going to die.

For the special effects, there wasn't a lot in this film; there were violent shakes of the camera to simulate the violent movement of the mice. There were close-up shots of the bigger mice biting their victims and the face of the biggest rat in the movie.

Probably the best thing about this movie is the climax at the end. I do not want to ruin the climax as it could be a spoiler for those who may watch it, but after watching this whole movie all the way through I have to say the climax is the best thing to see. Also, don't expect another movie related to mice after this because it ends on a cliffhanger.
