7823550,5,6302277485,"Are you creative? Most people would say no and relegate creativity to certain people. The fact of the matter is that all people are creative and can use this valuable resource in enriching their lives.
  Bill Turpie, our host, shows us how we can realize our creative potential through interviewing professionals in the field and sharing techniques to unfold the creative process. One of the first things he does is provide us with a working definition of creativity. For the purpose of this presentation it is defined as a way of looking at different unrelated things and seeing the connections of them.
  We are then introduced to Bob Kindler, an artist, who collects things we think of us junk and forms them into collages. He goes in detail on how the creative process works. Another person who taps into his creative source is Jerry Ellis. Ellis is the owner of Building 19 a business which  sells salvage items. Jerry shares with you his wild ideas of marketing which made his business into a multi-million dollar enterprise.
  The film identifies blocks to creativity, gives us techniques on how to stimulate the creative process and shows us that creativity is a right and left brain source of functioning. Creativity is a natural extension of your life.
  I highly recommend this film for training in small and mid-size businesses which are trying to tap into new markets. The professional advice given would stimulate the creative process in companies that are in a highly competitive market. Individuals and managers would also benefit from the techniques in tapping into a resource that will enrich their lives and business.",986083200,4,1636,4.9633699633699635
