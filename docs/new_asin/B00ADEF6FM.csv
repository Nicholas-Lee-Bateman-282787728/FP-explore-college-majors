8550070,2,B00ADEF6FM,"The actual show is great, but this seller just rips it onto a DVD and there is no menu, etc. Also the subtitles do not always match up with what is going on (time delay more so than incorrect translation)",1421884800,,204,4.125
8550071,2,B00ADEF6FM,"Product is a bootleg and is poor VHS transfer quality. It does not contain ending credits and it has English subtitle errors and corruption. I was disappointed as I an an avid Gundam fan and collector. The art quality is poor like a photo scan put onto glossy paper, same goes for the two TWO covers, they too are poorly made disc not of ""manufacturer"" quality.

Beware of product if you want 100% a true product.",1420848000,3,413,4.434210526315789
8550072,5,B00ADEF6FM,A great action anime film !!,1416182400,,28,3.8333333333333335
8550073,4,B00ADEF6FM,"Gundam X really is a great series, cut short due to various time-slot issues and production set backs.  If Gundam Wing and Mobile Suit Gundam had a love child, this is the result.  Great characters, awesome mech, and for the price it is well worth it.  Yes it is bootleg and there is occasional lag in the subtitles, but that never kept me or my friends from enjoying a great, hidden gem in the Gundam franchise.  I've seen everything Gundam.  This is a favorite.  Enjoy!",1408579200,,471,4.482352941176471
8550074,4,B00ADEF6FM,"After War X Bootleg edition.

The show itself is quite worth the purchase, but this is a Chinese Bootleg. The quality is questionable, but doesn't ruin the enjoyment of a solid and well made show.

The opening and endings are only shown at the start and end of each disk, 2 disks. So I really do mean low quality. The grammer and editing for the subtitles are off, and several episodes have unsynched audio.  But again, the bulk is a decent attempt.

This is a flawed product, but the flaws are minor and don't ruin the experience or flow. Just minor gripes.",1403740800,,558,4.4411764705882355
8550075,4,B00ADEF6FM,"Gundam X has always been my favorite Gundam show! I just wish that someone would give it a chance and give it an English dub. I'd been waiting years for that, so now it seems that Bandai has cancelled English production of anything related to Gundam? Thus, I had to settle on this. The downside is that the video quality is poor depending upon what media player you use. I have been using VLC, and other free media players, but in order to get the proper presentation I had to use the DVD player on my computer to get good video quality. I didn't like the print on the case. It looked like a bootleg that the seller sold me; but I'm not sure. I suggest that you only buy this set if you absolutely love Gundam X like me. Otherwise, you're better off finding a better quality release or searching for it in person so that you can see what you're getting.",1395964800,,853,4.2392638036809815
8550076,2,B00ADEF6FM,"Poor subtitles, often far ahead of the animation. Very poor VHS quality transfer. Mostly useless menus. Too bad really it's a good series",1394668800,6,137,5.0
