8506415,5,B006YD43M8,"The high value of every little baby that is growing in the womb shines through powerfully in this film.  I was very impressed by the testimonies of doctors who used to perform abortions.  Eventually they came to see the horror of what they were doing.  They just weren't ""removing tissue.""  They were deliberately snuffing out the life of a real, living human being.  I was also impressed by the testimonies of men & women whose mothers were considering an abortion, but decided against it.  What wonderful, crearive & productive human beings these adults turned out to be!  Films like this should be shown in every high school ""Health Education"" class in America  in order to give a viable & reasoned option to the usual propaganda that is almost universally promoted.  At least give our highly intelligent teens the option of making an informed decision without slanting everything one way!  I am personally thankful to those who produced ""The Gift of Life.""  They did a great job!",1363737600,,983,4.86144578313253
8506416,5,B006YD43M8,Most profound in its content. Every young person needs to see this.
