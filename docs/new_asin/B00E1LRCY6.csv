5883330,5,B00E1LRCY6,"First I must admit that I grew up with most of this wonderful music. Saw this in June at Lincoln Center. This is the way a music documentary should be made. Full of information, fascinating interviews, and the music! This is the ""real"" story told by the people who were there AND STILL ARE! Only regret: I wish it would have been much longer.",1380240000,,342,4.359375
5883331,5,B00E1LRCY6,"I was totally unaware of this movie until a vocalist friend of mine asked me if I wanted to see it.  Some friends in her all female singing group had seen it and raved about it.  So, on an impulse I went to see it.

Behind every great star is a great singing talent backing them up.  Sting, Rolling Stones, George Harrison, Lynyrd Skynrd, Luther Vandross, Michael Jackson, Stevie wonder.

Twenty feet tells the story of backup singers who we are impressed by but have not necessarily given much thought to their story.  However to see this movie is to become of aware of their story, their talent, and their struggles.

Thematically, it visits  the theme explored in Standing in the Shadows of Motown, which explored the musician talent behind all the great Motown hits. Most of the great hits of Motown featured almost the exact same musicians creating the distinctive Motown sound, and that movie explored their story.

Although I loved that movie which I highly recommend I loved this one more, because it explores the more personal dimension of the singer.  We get inside the story of these women singers and learn of their trials and tribulations, and as the title suggests the closeness to fame and the elusive quality of fame itself. These ladies are undoubtedly very talented, and I pulled out a pen and started writing down their names as I watched the movie so that I could explore more of their work later.

Most of the great artists do use backup singers, and there is no doubt that the harmonies and counter-melodies they contribute add a huge dimension to the artists performance, and to our experience as a listener.

Major artists such as Sting, Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder contribute their insights, and their stories, and we also get to see some Michael Jackson footage, and the backup singer on the verge of becoming famous until you know what.. happened.

One particular highlight for me was the story of the recording of Gimme Shelter with the Rolling Stones.  I will never think of that song the same way again.

Another was the harrowing story of Darlene Love and her experiences with Phil Spector.  While his brilliance as a producer is undoubted his treatment of her was horrible.

I was previously unaware that before the era of Milli Vanilli, some well known female singing acts performed in concert lip synching to vocals provided by studio backup singer in concert, although we all know about Audrey Hepburn and My Fair Lady I think.

Similarly a story of a woman backup singer who finally gets her own recording contract, and records a hit song.  However the song is put out under the name of a different artist and gets to number one using her vocals.

Most movies when released make the biggest money on the opening weekend, and often trail off spectacularly losing as much as much as 50% the following week, and often fizzle or disappear after a few weeks.  Twenty feet made on a budget of approximately $1 million grossed $54,000 on it's opening weekend  in June on 3 screens.  An impressive number per screen on a limited release.  One month later it grosses
$370,000, and $390,000 on back to back weekend, and in August it's still going strong having grossed over $3,000,000.  It has also won several awards including the San Francisco International Film Festival audience award.

I think we all love to root for the underdog, if you're like me as you watch this movie, you may wonder why isn't this particular woman a superstar.  Some of them very definitely deserve to be.

Some names to remember and explore: Ciandra Lennear, Merry Clayton,  Darlene Love, Lisa Fischer, and Judith Hill.

We enjoyed it.  It got a round of applause at the end.  I would not be the least bit surprised if this was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary.

I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",1376265600,72,3863,4.709388971684054
5883332,5,B00E1LRCY6,"So you never thought about those backup singers that make so many songs memorable?  You will after you see this movie.  The Stones, Beatles, David Bowie, Springstein, Elton, Bette Midler, Lynard Skynard, and other greats all used backup singers on their most famous songs, and as we learn here, they are blazing talents equal to Aretha who had to live in the shadows of the stars they sang behind.

When you hear these ladies unleash their unbelievable voices, you will wonder how they never made it to stardom.  Their voices are beyond belief.  So how is it possible that one was reduced to cleaning people's houses to survive?

This movie explores all the reasons these incredible ladies who sing never made it all the way to the stardom they deserved.  They even were the actual voices of The Crystals in the 1960's, and watched as The Crystals were celebrated stars, while lip syncing and taking credit for their own voices.

You won't have a dull moment watching this.  And you will remember it for a long time.  The music, the singing, are rare treats.  This is in theaters now where I live, but it is such a great documentary, so well done, so entertaining, with such an amazing display of talent and such unbelievable voices, that I want to watch it several more times, something I never do.

The soundtrack and performances are rare footage that I've not seen anyplace.  It's worth seeing just for the that.  The Beatles, Stevie Wonder, The Stones, Bowie, Springstein, Cream, Lynard Skynard, Tina Turner and the Ikettes (Ike Turner is described as thinking of himself as a pimp), Luther Vandross, and other such greats, are shown in early performances, with their backup singers.  No one should miss seeing the young Tina Turner with the Ikettes, shaking their tail feathers circa 1969.  The old people sitting behind me were gasping for air.

The audience of elderly retirees where I live, who most likely don't listen to the Stones or other groups shown, were amazed, and were breathlessly raving about this as they shuffled out of the theater.  It's almost unheard of to be this thoroughly entertained by a movie.

Rotten Tomatoes rating for this is 99%.

This should win an of award for its story, and musical entertainment value, as well as being one of the absolute best documentaries ever made.  And I have no doubt it will do just that.  Don't miss seeing this one.",1376006400,104,2382,4.744525547445256
5883333,4,B00E1LRCY6,"In ""20 Feet From Stardom"" (2013 release; 91 min.), director Morgan Neville brings a great look into the importance of the backup singers in rock and roll and R&B. There is an enjoyable mix of interviews of ""big names"" (the movie opens with insights from none other than Bruce Springsteen himself, later on Mick Jagger provides comments as well), along with archive footage, and then focusing on several famously un-famous backup singers both from the old days (Merry Clayton, Darlene Love, Tata Vega) and more recently (Lisa Fischer, Judith Hill). Did you know that one of those songers won a Grammy? If you wonder who, just watch! The best moment in the documentary comes when we see a discussion about the backup singers of Luther Vandross, only then to learn that Vandross himself started out as a back-up singer for David Bowie! Best of all, the documentary gives us archive footage of this (when Bowie went through his soul period on the ""Young Americans"" album). The person who comes out worst in this documentary is Phil ""Wall of Sound"" Spector. If you wonder why, just watch!

The bigger question relating to those obviously talented singers is why did they not make it big while other less talented singers did? Stevie Wonder comments that ""it's not a matter of talent, it's luck and circumstances"" and Springsteen says the same but in different words. (Please note that there is a great soundtrack album, containing many of the songs featured in this movie, including Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side"", Talking Heads' ""Slippery People"" (the live version from ""Stop Making Sense""), David Bowie's ""Young Americans"", and several tracks from the 'backup' singers.)

I saw this documentary at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati a couple of weekends ago (and the screening was very well attended, incidentally). So glad I did. ""20 Feet From Stardom"" brings a slice of life in the music business that we the fans know little about, and Neville has put together an entertaining documentary that also gives some bigger lessons in life. If you are a music buff, I'd say that is documentary is a can't miss, must-see. ""20 Feet From Stardom"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1374537600,70,2174,4.904891304347826

An interesting lesson in the evolution of music. You'll meet the singer who had that primal solo in Gimme Shelter. Much more. Definitely recommend this movie.",1525910400,,325,5.269230769230769
5883366,5,B00E1LRCY6,"This DVD is singularly spectacular in showing off the talent behind the talent.

Stories featuring the careers of people like Merry Clayton, Darlene Love, Lisa Fischer and others, is only matched by the history they bring. These were the voices that grooved America and no one knew... til now. Merry Clayton howling some soul into The Rolling Stones, Darlene Love getting messed over by Phil Specter and the Lisa Fischer's ethereal voice. Singer Judith Hill is the modern example of the role of a backup singer who is trying to make it as a soloist.

Kind of disappointed that Motown's background group, The Andantes, were not included or even mentioned when they were the voices behind most of Motown's smash hits.

5883400,3,B00E1LRCY6,"Why is this look at background singers limited to only one race and one gender? It suffer from being too biased that way. Thus, one star off for each offense. No mention of the Pips from Gladys Knight, for example. A great background singer who made the jump to becoming a fantastic lead singer was sitting right next to Darlene Love at time 23:24, and they didn't even dare say her name. Amazing. Why? Progressives like Bruce Springsteen need to understand that ""diversity"" and inclusion go both ways. Otherwise, they are just using the concept as a cudgel against one gender and one race.

5883420,4,B00E1LRCY6,"Had heard about this documentary and finally watched it yesterday. It was quite interesting actually. One comment that caught my mind was something along the lines that people tend to sing what the background singers sing. Yes, I realized that I'm doing that a lot :)",1500249600,,267,4.826086956521739
5883421,1,B00E1LRCY6,"This documentary, which is superb in so many respects, alternates between brief snippets of speaking followed by brief snippets of singing: in other words, of explanation followed by demonstration. And that alternating pattern is repeated countless times over the course of the entire program.

I got my start as a backup singer in December of 1965 when Ernie Stafford woke me in the middle of the night and told me to come into the studio that very instantwhich is what I did, wearing nothing but a nightie under my winter coat. And that kind of explanation is followed by a snippet from a hit record this backup singer backed in early 1966.

Such a format could be fine EXCEPT for the way the sound levels have been mixed by the filmmaker: the musical portion is far, far louder than the spoken portion. The result is that if you set your own volume loud enough to hear and understand what happened in 1965, the music snippet will blow you out of your living room. And if you turn it down enough so that the music sounds right, the spoken segment will be practically inaudibleand youll have to strain to follow the narrative.

A little of this aural imbalance is annoying in a full-length documentary. But when the entire program is packed with it, the problem becomes intolerable.

It does help, after the volume is set on low, to turn on the subtitles. But its a third-rate solution to a problem the viewer shouldnt have to face.",1500249600,3,1433,4.607843137254902

5883537,1,B00E1LRCY6,"This film presents a needless, utterly false and indefensibly racist context that denigrates white singers in a sick attempt to elevate black singers (although the documentary curiously ONLY features black women, not black men). The film actually states that white people can't sing with any soul (Well, of course, everyone knows that!), so there were simply no good singers prior to the 1960's when the color barrier was finally broken! I've loved many documentaries about Jimi Hendrix, but not one of them deemed it necessary to PUT DOWN and even deny the existence of white guitarists from a prior generation (be it Link Wray, Carl Perkins or Les Paul) in order to elevate Jimi. Jimi Hendrix would have thought that as ugly and stupid as the attitude of this vehicle of political correctness.",1480809600,,795,4.984962406015038

The voices are amazing, and the personalities behind each of those voices are compelling in their own special, individual way.  There's also some great concert footage and insightful interviews with major rockers.  Satisfying all around, it made me wish I had paid more attention to how the music was truly made.  Merry Clayton is wonderful, yet I only knew her as that startling, haunting voice on ""Gimme Shelter"".",1480636800,,523,4.977011494252873

Great topic, touching on the various issues backup singers face, the changes and players in the music industry, as well as the personal journeys of the singers. I was hoping to hear more vocal harmonies but in the 2nd half of the movie, there was a lot more emphasis in their potential solo careers, and so there was a lot more solo audio and very little vocal harmonies. Towards the end, it seemed to me too much like advertising. But overall I think it's really worth watching for anyone who like vocal music.",1468540800,,575,4.538461538461538

Like the Funk Brothers of ""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"" fame, these women are consummate musicians who have been under-appreciated for pretty much their entire careers.

5883661,4,B00E1LRCY6,"Very good documentary about several top background singers and their contributions to rock and pop music. This is long overdue, and my family enjoyed it. The only thing that would have made it better for us was if it covered more ground. The singers that were profiled are all utterly amazing for sure, but we would have liked to also see other great background singers like Yvonne Elliman and Marcy Levy (Clapton's awesome background singers), and Rosemary Butler who did backup vocals for so many stars. Also, the part about Darlene Love and the Crystals was confusing and we were left with the impression that the Crystals weren't real singers. We had to look it up to understand the conflict, which was the fault of Phil Spector. Anyway, the film is great, the singers are fabulous, I love the title, just think this film would have been even better with tighter editing and more variety. I love background singers btw and have been interested in them since I was a little kid reading the liner notes on my older siblings albums. I would love to see more films on this subject.

I give one star reviews to get people to read it- actually- i thoroly enjoyed this - my main criticism is- there is n o politics in it- the racism is everywhere apparent- only Sting has the intelligence to notice-
The singers should have rebelled- but- they needed the money?
Do you realize that you can survive on very little in this world?
If you have the sm arts you can realize!

5883805,5,B00E1LRCY6,"Another great film that serious singers and musicians and music lovers MUST SEE. This film focuses on a half dozen of the best and most celebrated backup singers ever. You've heard their voices all your life on countless hit records. However, they've not been so lucky to have hit records of their own, for various reasons. The film's title comes from a great comment by Bruce Springsteen (one of the many stars interviewed in the film) on how difficult it is to become a star, even when you have the talent.

The film gives a great history lesson about rock music's female backing vocal groups, beginning with the Blossoms and Darlene Love. The film pays great homage to these wonderful singers and shows how rotten the industry can be. After seeing this film, you won't be able to hear those records the same way ever again. It's a beautifully and lovingly made film, it looks and sounds very good.

FYI - There is a soundtrack to the film but it lacks many of the classic songs that are featured in the film.

5883919,5,B00E1LRCY6,"Being a musician, this really struck home. It's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.

Here's the scoop. This film looks at essentially everything involving backup singers in rock. It deals with the evolution, the stars of the backup singers, the attempts by some of them to step into the limelight and the current state of affairs.

This is a phenomenal documentary. First is the outline. It takes you through the evolution, showing some of the earliest backup folk. Then it continually talks with the most popular of backups along with those they backed up. It features their recorded work along with live clips of them doing their thing. You hear from artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Mick Jagger, David Bowie et al and how they happened to come across those they chose as backup and how they felt it affected their music. As you hear from all these people you are turned on to subtle aspects of what they do, as well as how this communicated with audiences. They talked about things I might have known subconsciously but never delineated. Such as: How anyone might sing a song to themselves but were singing the backup part as opposed to the main melody. Or how the backup to the stones' ""Give Me Shelter"" is as important as anything else going on in the song.

One section takes the viewer through the attempts by some to enter the spotlight and how sometimes they made it. Sometimes the didn't. And sometimes they tasted it only briefly. Then there is a later section on how record companies don't want to pay for the time backup singers require in the studio to hone their work to a given artist or song. It's a sad world.

This will forever change the way you view this wholly underestimated facet of rock music. It is absolutely worth every minute you spend watching it.",1437350400,,1789,4.634069400630914

5883969,4,B00E1LRCY6,"This is something I've been fascinated with for years.  I always thought making a documentary about back-up singers would be awesome.  I just never thought I could make it happen as a non-film maker.  I was excited when this came one was made.  Overall, I liked it, but it made a few missteps along the way.  Here are my issues with it:
1. It seemed that other than Lisa Fisher, when you see them singing in current day the music doesn't seem to suit their voices.
2. Donna Delory and Niki Harris sang back up for Madonna on both albums and tour from 1987 through 2001.  That's a long run to stay with one artist under your own free will.  They weren't bound to her by record contract like Darlene to Phil Spector.  I think these two women would have had a lot ot add to this documentary.  Maybe they opted out, who knows?  I just think they should have been included if only in photos.
3,  There was really no point for Judith Hill to take that dig at Kylie Minogue by talking about being embarrassed by singing back up for her on the Jay Leno show.  It's no secret that most back-up singers can out sing the people they back up, there was no reason to take a dig on Kylie.  Even still, Kylie is one of the most successful recording artists of all time and that's world wide.  It's another example of how we always have to pit women against each other in the entertainment industry.
4. There seemed to be some underlying resentment between a few of the most seasoned women.  It was never addressed and I wondered why.  Certain comments were made alluding to who was the queen and it seemed they ran in cliques, but it went unaddressed.

These four things aside, this is a fascinating look at the women (and the few men) who were the movers and the shakers while largely going unnoticed.  This is worth watching and I think anyone who has an interest that dates back to the 60s will really appreciate this.  And it's sad that the back up singer is now going by the wayside.  People recording at home and layering their own vocals.  There will always be a place for them on the big tours, but it seems these days that most pop stars lip sync their entire shows.

Do watch this, my four issues are minor.",1432166400,,2202,4.319512195121951

Instead it was a boring name-dropping bragfest by certain backup singers about who they sang with and how they were ""personally requested"" by certain famous people to sing on their records or on their tours.  Who cares who these people sang with?  This documentary wants you to think how unappreciated these singers were, etc. but instead it shows how they chose their lot, didn't want to be up-front, were full of themselves and had egos bigger than the ""stars"".  Also, there was too much screaming instead of singing for me.  Why must people scream and scat instead of sing?  We turned it off after 40 minutes because we couldn't take the bragging.  If you want to hear how unknown well-healed backup singers made a living this is the movie for you.

5884045,5,B00E1LRCY6,"'20 Feet From Stardom' is an amazing documentary which talks about music's unsung heroes - backup singers.  The film details the story of several backup singers who likely will be unfamiliar to the viewer, but once you hear the songs, it will bring back memories.  A good part of the film focuses on the career of Darlene Love, who was one of the Phil Spector artists and went on to be perhaps the most famous backup singer ever.

The singers are magnificent, the music memorable, and the stories heartwarming.  At the end of the film, there is a very touching and memorable scene where many of the backup singers that have appeared in the movie perform an ensemble which is just spectacular and brings tears to your eyes.  One great thing about the movie is how many mainstream stars - including Bruce Springsteen, Sting and Stevie Wonder - speak on behalf of the backup singers, talking about how great they are.

If you love music, and are interested in learning about its inner workings, then '20 Feet From Stardom' is the movie for you.  It is well worth watching - you will enjoy it for years to come.",1425427200,3,1107,4.5606060606060606

5884106,5,B00E1LRCY6,"I started out the New Year right with this film.  I actually have many of the solo records from these underappreciated (mostly) goddesses and to watch them tell their stories as they do here is just wonderful.  While all of them show that they can handle lead vocals better than most, they show that background vocals often take as much talent and in fact are the heart of many of the world's favorite songs.  A clear example is Merry Clayton's haunting part in the Stones' ""Gimme Shelter.""  Lisa Fischer is shown to be a transcendent backup vocalist who won her own Grammy for her one solo CD (which contained the ballad ""How Can I Ease the Pain"").  The follow-up fell through, and I wish the filmmakers had her talk more about that.  I'm not clear if it was a ""business"" decision or whether Ms. Fischer just didn't enjoy being out front.  The great Darlene Love, at one point reunited with her fellow Blossoms, is shown to be a hidden (by Phil Spector's machinations) lead singer as well as first-rate backing vocalist.  To see these, and other talented ladies and gentlemen, interviewed, with praise from the likes of Bruuuce, Mick, and Sting, is such a treat.  If you love popular music you need to see and own this film.  Then check the credits on all your CDs and LPs and watch for everybody's names.",1420156800,7,1306,4.5665236051502145

5884113,3,B00E1LRCY6,"This is a study of those backup singers possessed of as much talent as the stars they work for, but who have somehow not managed to ascend to show business' top tier.  Partly this is due to lack of will; partly due to luck; and partly due to the fact that perhaps talent is not enough to ensure one's name emblazoned on marquees outside theaters.

Among those interviewed include producer Lou Adler, singers Patti Austin, Merry Clayton, Amy Christian and Carole Childs (among others), Mick Jagger, Stevie Wonder and Sheryl Crow.  What emerges most tangibly from Morgan Neville's film is that there exists a definite pecking-order between stars and their backing singers; although Wonder and Jagger (especially) praise the efforts of those who have worked so hard to make their albums memorable, they regard the singers as secondary beings.  In Jagger's case, there is a definite sense that he treats them as commodities, to be engaged by producers and to be available whenever the star requires.

The careers of these singers stretch way back to the mid-1960s; and some of them continue working to this day.  For the most part they are philosophical about their careers; even to be a backing singer on some of the greatest hits of the last five decades is something memorable.  But we cannot but help empathize with their underlying disappointment as they reflect on what might have been, had the breaks gone their way.

There are some memorable performances in 20 FEET FROM STARDOM, which make the film eminently watchable, but the overall mood is elegaic, a longing for what might have happened, even though most of the singers have enjoyed financially successful existences.",1419724800,5,1677,4.964285714285714

5884160,4,B00E1LRCY6,"It was a little different than what I was expecting. I thought it was more about background singers in general, but it actually focused on just a few African-American singers. You're given the impression that background singers are only black, and being held back by the music business. I would have preferred a wider look at background singers if that's what the movie was really about. As it is, the Darlene Love, Merry Clayton and Lisa Fischer stories would have made great films on their own. That being said it was very interesting, lots of great music. It's probably just me but it seemed to meander throughout, as if it was trying to cover too much in one movie. The trials and tribulations of the music business (then and now), being a background singer, wanting to be a star, the passion for singing, and singing with superstars. It may have benefitted from a little more focus. It might have made two great movies instead of one very good one. The interviews with Springsteen, Jagger, Wonder and Sting weren't much. I always admire artistic ambition though, and this was ambitious. Well worth seeing. It's worth seeing just for Darlene Love's performance of ""Lean on Me.""",1416700800,4,1181,4.794117647058823

5884253,5,B00E1LRCY6,"Loved it. Fast moving, moving, informative, not dry at all. Music is fabulous.

I totally disagree with these comments from another reviewer:
""If I were to do this documentary, I would have started by showcasing the apparently few, like the wonderful Luther Vandross, who successfully stepped forward twenty feet and carved out a first-class career."" It's a movie about the people 20 feet FROM stardom, not the ones who became stars. Although some of the showcased singers did indeed move into the bigtime, the focus of the film is their time in the background.

""Then I would have introduced the few backup singers that were in the movie and told their stories, their hopes, their unfulfilled dreams."" In my opinion, the movie did exactly that.

""far too much off-stage screaming and wailing gospel-style singing for my taste"" Totally disagree. I very much enjoyed the parts showing singers offstage and I love gospel music. If you like R & B, soul, gospel, Motown, etc., you'll enjoy the singing whether onstage or sitting around a table at home. There are scenes of big rockers like the Stones and David Bowie performing, but that's a small part of the movie.

My one minor complaint is that the opening scene with Bruce Springsteen is kind of confusing because it seems like he's answering a question but you don't know what it is. In retrospect, I know that he was addressing the psychological implications of a singer moving from being a background singer to becoming a star, which is addressed several times during the film.

I liked this movie so much, and was fascinated by being introduced to many fabulous singers that I had never heard of, that I watched all of the outtakes and bonus material. I almost never watch that stuff! Then I had to google them all to find out even more and mentally add them to my Favorite Artists list.",1412726400,,1842,4.761755485893417

There is no drama, no coherent story, very little background on the singers, and far too much off-stage screaming and wailing gospel-style singing for my taste.

If I were to do this documentary, I would have started by showcasing the apparently few, like the wonderful Luther Vandross, who successfully stepped forward twenty feet and carved out a first-class career.

I knew this movie was never going to play in a theatre in my town so I bought the download, and am glad I did.  I have already seen it a couple of times.  The segment on Merry Clayton singing the beginning of the Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter (which also has comments from Mick Jagger) is just fantastic.  Bruce Springsteen isn't a big presence in this movie but his comments about how hard it is to go from a backup singer to a star are moving.  Loved the movie.",1412208000,3,594,4.267857142857143

Sometimes they're right up front, like Merry Clayton, who sang the unforgettable ""Rape- murder"" on the Rolling Stones' ""Gimmee Shelter."" What they all share in common is that to the listening public they're almost entirely unknowns, performers working for scale or at least for a whole lot less than the bands and singers they're backing up. Many, like Darlene Love, had been great solo artists in their own right.

The documentary introduces you to a number of these great singer, and their stories, and does so with great affection for the music and the performers. It's an absolute must-see for anyone with a love for popular music and the people who perform it.",1411257600,,809,4.820143884892087

Its kind of sad how these people worked so hard and had as much talent as the celebs they sang back up for and now they have trouble paying their bills. I thought it couldve been expanded out more though. They seem to only concentrate on a few specific singers. It was more of a human interest documentary. I wouldve like to have seen something more informational that delved into the history of back up singers and how they got started.  Other than Bruce Springsteen, it pretty much just concentrated on R&B, which I love. I just wouldve liked to have seen the different types of music sung by the back up singers.

Another fabulous thing about Twenty Steps is all the big names in music who participated; for example, Bruce Springsteen, Mick Jagger, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Lou Adler and many more.

This is my fourth or fifth time watching it; so, it goes without saying that I absolutely love this movie, lol!  Beyond hearing these wonderful voices, and seeing how these singers' careers progressed - or didn't; beyond offering up the fun facts regarding who sang what background vocal on what song; 20 Feet From Stardom is also a movie that raises questions about the music industry, stardom, ego and so many other issues.  Why does one person whose talent is mediocre make it big while another with the voice of an angel fades into obscurity?  Is it just the ""it"" factor?  Is it having the right producer and the right song at the right time?  Is it luck?  A combination of all of those things?  Are those who languish in the background simply not hungry or aggressive enough?  And is staying in the background such a bad thing if you're still doing what you love?  I'm telling you, each time I watch this movie, I notice something that I missed before, and new questions arise for me.  In a world where pretty much anyone can become ""famous"" via youtube, Instagram, or one of the ubiquitous TV talent shows, does stardom still mean what it once did?  I will undoubtedly watch this movie again.  If you haven't already done so, see it.  I hope you love it as much as I do.",1406160000,6,1352,4.46530612244898

5884377,5,B00E1LRCY6,"An entity of the music industry/business is truly ""unsung"". And that is the contribution from background singers. While I love an array of Divas and male artists, often the accents that background singers add to the mix is undeniable. Though early on I knew I was a forever disciple of Diana Ross, the call and response harmony on something like ""Come See About Me"", reminds me of how exciting they once were in harmony as a trio. Watching and listening to Teddy Pendergrass and his background singers on ""You're My Latest, My Greatest, Inspiration"" is truly inspiring, Aretha without Carolyn or Erma Franklin singing ""ree, ree, ree ,respect"" in the background, Diana with The Jones Girls in the 70s, Ike & Tina Turner with the Ikettes, Ray Charles with The Raelettes, Stevie Wonder with Wonderlove, The Supremes/Diana with The Andantes, on and on, added that special ingredient to a great record into a classic.
""20 Feet from Stardom"" goes a long way in underscoring the often neglected contribution of the background singers. (Really for the life of me, I cannot imagine remembering where the ""oohs and a aahs"" go without being tempted to sing the entire verse.....It is definitely an art form).
I distinctly remember how The Blossoms on Shindig seemed to add support to any number of guests appearing, however, though she had a distinctive face, I never knew how much was owed to Darlene Love. I was hard pressed to name a particular song by Ike & Tina Turner that made me love Tina so much....but, boy do I remember The Ikettes. (The rather crass, but, honest take that Ike Turner thought of himself as ""a pimp"" while the ladies, including his wife, Anna Mae Bullock, as his working girls, his hoes.......seemed to be not far off from how they translated visually. But out from the ladies, rose one, Claudia Linnear, who struck me as one of the toughest chics in the group).
And try as my may, I never connected with Merry Clayton as a solo artist (though I was quite aware of the critical acclaim she had in rock circles), ""Gimme Shelter"" would be lacking without her wild, gospel wailing. Though her solo albums never made much of an impact, her stardom in the 70s was undeniable. I read her name on the back of many of my album covers.
The goodie two shoes description of the exclusively white background singers in the 40s and 50s made no impact anywhere near the forthcoming inclusion of black female background singers.....because they just didn't seem very essential. I would yawn at The Lennon Sisters or couldn't wait until The King Sisters left the stage, or it was off to the kitchen for another snack.
Luther Vandross' love for The Supremes or The Sweet Inspirations backing Aretha, inspired him to have topnotch background singers like the great Lisa Fischer, Cindy Mizelle and Fonzi Thorton supporting him on his tours. The ladies often wore the ultra-elegant type gowns Diana Ross & The Supremes wore on their award winning television special, ""G.I.T."" or their final ""Farewell Tour"". In fact, on Wikipedia, the last photo pictured is Luther & Diana at the ""Return to Love Tour"" saluting the music of The Supremes which he attended on opening and closing night.
""20 Feet from Stardom"" features none other than Bruce Springsteen, Sting and Bette Midler (who came from The Harlettes) paying homage to these ladies, 99% of them were black.
It is heartbreaking to hear Darlene Love sharing that at one point she ""cleaned houses to make ends meet"" or Claudia Linnear becoming a language teacher though she was not ready to give up performing.
Even more sobering is the fact that today, the huge recording sessions of yesteryear is all but a memory......removing an important opportunity for background singers to work, studio technology beginning with Marvin Gaye's admittedly beautiful multiple voice layering and further underscored by Michael Jackson's ""Off the Wall"" also replacing the need for background singers.......Darlene Love shared that at one point in the late 80s/early 90s, you would be hard pressed to find background singers employed to enrich recording sessions. Thankfully, most artists of integrity still utilizes background singers on tour. However, none other than Babyface, a once successful partner in making LaFace a close replica of Motown in the 90s, revealed on ""The Braxton Family Values"" that he pipes in pre-recorded background vocals on tour.
An interesting example of the distance of that virtual 20 feet on stage, can be found in the case of Lisa Fischer. After a gold debut album featuring a #1 single and two more Top 10 singles for a total of 4/Top 20 singles, never followed up on her solo success. Lisa revealed that she loves singing....period! and Merry Clayton states that Lisa doesn't possess the ego or desire to walk that 20 feet to headline. The praise she gets from Rolling Stones and the once great Luther Vandross' fans is quite fulfilling enough.....thank you.
""20 Feet from Stardom"" focuses your attention on possibly taking background singers for granted. Thankfully, I never really have. I understood that it takes all the ingredients necessary to make a successful recording. The entree may well be the centerpiece, but, the vocal and visual acoutrements, make for a true feast.
In a talent like Judith Hill that realizes the danger in being typecast as a background singer, if you truly want to walk that distance. But a Stevvi Alexander reminds you of the wake-up call you get backing a non-talent like Britney Spears. These ladies could make a Britney Spears go home and hide under the sheets and ""cry herself a river"" once they displayed their talents......I would love to have a sequel to this award winning documentary.",1405814400,2,5693,4.925078043704475

5884424,4,B00E1LRCY6,"I like TWENTY FEET FROM STARDOM very much but how did it beat DIRTY WARS for the Best Documentary of 2013 Oscar? Anyway, I wonder if the final scene, where Darlene Love is in concert with Bruce Springsteen, stands to drive home the point about why some singers and musicians become stars and others don't. With all due respect to Darlene Love and her talent, the people in that audience had to be watching Springsteen, as magnetic a performer as their ever was. While he probably isn't trying to upstage her, he does.

I, for one, could not help but find my eyes drawn to Judith Hill, one of the backup singers this film features, the way Springsteen makes you look at him.  It would not surprise me to see her reach stardom.

To answer my opening question, all I can figure is TWENTY FEET FROM STARDOM hits home with the masses who, like the unsung singers featured in the film, get no glory for the dirty work they must do for a living.  Not as many of us can relate to getting assassinated by J.S.O.C., the topic of DIRTY WARS, even though it ought to concern us more than another heart broken by show biz.",1403913600,,1109,4.368932038834951

Listening to Merry Clayton recount the story of being woken up in the middle of the night, 8 months pregnant, and heading over to a studio in LA to record for a group she'd never heard of called The Rolling Stones was in of itself worth the price of the film.  And hearing Diane Love talk about hearing one of her songs on the radio many, many years later, while working as a cleaning lady and realizing that her voice needed to be heard again was inspirational.

5884486,2,B00E1LRCY6,"Below is a Facebook post from La La Brooks of The Crystals, bringing to a head, all the out and out lies Darlene Love stated in this documentary. Obviously, the fault has to lie with the Director, for not doing his research. I was very disappointed that the Academy overlooked Joshua Oppenheimer's harrowing documentary, 'The Act Of Killing,' for this film. Now, 20 Feet From Stardom's merit, is further tarnished. Here's the post by La La: (God Bless You La La!) LX Skye / NPR kzmu.org

Hello Facebook Family,

Yesterday I received an email from a 60's dj which read:

Hello Lala, I wanted you to know I just saw 20 Feet from Stardom and was flabbergasted about the claims that were being made about your group and I'm not sure how you got left out.

I was a Top 40 radio DJ during the 60s and know your music really well. Saw you on a recent Oldies show on PBS. You really knocked them out! Keep rocking -

This is just one of many emails I've received in recent weeks in regard to Darlene Love's false claims with respect to The Crystals in the movie, ""20 Feet From Stardom."" In the film, Darlene creates the impression that The Crystals were merely a `dummy'group that were the public face of the real singers on the Phil Spector records (who, as we're led to believe, were Darlene and her group, The Blossoms).

This, of course, is completely inaccurate and further underscores Darlene's propensity to lie and rewrite history. The Crystals were a legitimate group who could sing very well and who toured extensively both domestically and internationally. To suggest otherwise is an insult both to the group and to me personally, and if the lie is not corrected, it will tarnish our legacy for future generations.

Unlike a newspaper which can issue corrections to inaccurate statements it may have printed, once a movie is released, it is there on the screen permanently. I have spoken with the film's director, Morgan Neville about the inaccuracies and he was genuinely apologetic about not being aware of them at the time that he made it. Unfortunately, however, Darlene's lie continues to be perpetuated every time someone goes to a theater to watch this movie.

But there is something we can do. At some point, the movie will probably be released as a DVD. Many times these DVD packages contain bonus material including outtakes, comments from the filmmakers, etc. This would be an opportunity for Mr. Neville to make the much-needed corrections. If he wishes to interview me so that I could explain the truth, I would certainly be a willing participant.

I know you guys are well aware of what The Crystals did and their place in musical history. If you, who know the truth, would write a message to Mr. Neville expressing your thoughts, our combined efforts will go a long way in helping to preserve the musical legacy of the Crystals. You may write to him at: tremoloproductions.com and click on the `contact' tab at the top of the screen; there will be a box for you to write your message.

As always, I thank you for your loyal support. I will fight forever to preserve our legacy by continuing to speak out against Darlene's lies. I'm so grateful to know that you guys have my back.

Love to all, La La",1400889600,4,3217,4.626315789473685

Their stories are remarkable, and these people are true musicians, dedicated to improving the music as a whole rather than standing out as individuals. It's a shame that so many of them, brimming with talent, have had a hard time breaking into the mainstream. I'm so glad this movie got made so we can start to appreciate the individual gifts of some remarkable artists.",1400544000,,507,4.839080459770115

5884502,3,B00E1LRCY6,"I appreciated hearing about many of the backup singers from the early days of  up to the present. I just wish: they had more current singers, background information on their families, how much they were paid (or how little), if they get royalties and album credits, how the business has changed over the years, and more information on more backup singers. What the movie did present was well done and interesting though. Three stars for the lack of information.",1400544000,4,461,4.8354430379746836

5884504,5,B00E1LRCY6,"this is a 5 star documentary.  It takes you to the world of backround singers that I never knew about.  it's interesting to note that not all backround singers want solo careers.  The ones that do have a difficult time.  You will recognize a lot of these women, and they are fabubously talented, beautiful women.  The movie is an hour and a half, but it is fast moving.  I enjoyed it a lot.",1400284800,,390,4.273972602739726
5884505,5,B00E1LRCY6,"Darlene Love - no question - IS the Lady Voice of the sixties and the early seventies.  And to see Claudia Laneear, transformed from her ""look what Leon has me looking like"" mode to her real authentic self is wonderful, also.  But just that one snippet where Darlene says ""The English groups all tried to sound black...that's where WE came in!,"" and then segueing into Merry Clayton, walking into the studio and reflecting on her involvement on the GREATEST SONG IN ALL OF ROCK AND ROLL HISTORY, ""Gimme Shelter"" - folks that is Rock and Roll Vocal Lesson # ONE.  If it hadn't have been for that Lady's involvement with ""Gimme Shelter,"" it would have been a GREAT Stones' song, sure, but her vocal...one word: ethereal.
Also, I just can NOT stop watching it, hearing the Ladies tell their fantastic stories.  And Lisa Fischer just stole a place in my heart by a) whispering to Darlene Love that Valarie Simpson was in the audience and b) how she reacted when that jerk from the Times tried to pick a fight between her & Merry about ""how she feels, singing Merry Clayton's part on 'Gimme Shelter.'""  And Lisa, bless her heart, almost tears up, and Merry is just almost saying to her, ""Ain't no thing.""  And the icing on the cake is when the three Ladies sing together - folks, that is what the angels in Heaven are probably going to sound like when we all get there.
Fortunately, ""Cher""yl Crowe's place on the DVD only spots her the 30 seconds she deserves.",1400284800,,1455,4.534351145038168

I knew that all these back up singers truly made up ""the sound"" of her teen years, and we all love the music we came of age to. This is enlightening and well done. Loved it! Watch it with your parents, and listen to them recall their memories from their youth with every song. It's a fun way to connect with that generation.",1399593600,,459,4.054945054945055

5884529,5,B00E1LRCY6,"This tribute to background singers is far more--it explores why some choose to be center stage and others prefer to be part of the musical ""community"" call and response. The voices are simply stunning--why Merry Clayton is not a superstar in her own right remains a perplexing question to this day, since she has the pipes and the motivation. Lisa Fischer's talents will rip you apart and sew you back into the earthly constellations, but what is really stunning is her true artistry and her groundedness. And Darlene Love--the only thing Phil Spector did right with her is give her the name ""Love"" because she embodies it in her every moment. There is sadness in this movie, but mostly righteous glory. If you love music, you need to see this movie. Background singers finally move to the forefront and we are all the richer for it.",1399420800,,833,4.712328767123288

5884542,5,B00E1LRCY6,"This was a fun movie and very informative, a real behind-the-scenes look at the business. The film explores the effects of metaphorically being so close to stardom, in some cases superstardom. There are real impacts both positive and negative, and always questions about how far the singers should go to try and establish their own careers, or to hold on to role of backup singer, for what it is. Sometimes not being the headliner in the spotlight seems protects a person from the worst excesses of the business as well- in particular I think Lisa Fischer is better off not becoming quite as famous as other members of the Rolling Stones, despite having such great talent and artistry. You'll probably never listen to backup singers the same way ever again.",1398729600,,757,4.8307692307692305

For the one or two who ""broke out"" and found a little fame, they seemed content, regardless of how well their record sold.  They were and still are in it, not so much for the fame, but for the love of what they do.

This quote made me think a lot when I first heard it. It is so simply put. Taking a cue from the above quote, I can say without any drama that 20 feet from Stardom has a bunch of background singers you would say the same about. I mean yes they are good and soulful but would you ever pay to listen to their voice? Would these people with limited apprehensive personalities truly delve into greatness?

My first qualm with the film is just how casual it is. I didn't find myself engaged remotely. It tried to rely on Ray Charles, Sting and even Bowie, but the film itself lacked a plausible effort.  My gripe also consists of feeling the film is very skewed by the audiences/crowd that made it.

In fairness, it does fifteen minutes before it end, beg to ask the question as to WHY DIDNT THESE PEOPLE BECOME AS SUCCESSFUL as the successful ones? The answer is plain and simple. They didn't have drive. Or they couldn't afford to leave their basic jobs because they wouldnt be able to support the struggle.

20 Feet from Stardom is quite bland, un-engaging and the music isn't too good to begin with. I cannot believe its success.",1396915200,,1211,4.436936936936937

And even extremely talented people will not be tapped, there is no automatic upgrade or graduation to lead singer request and record deal opportunities just because you sing back up. I was surprised at reality. Great to see the singers surviving and keeping a great face throughout it all. Loved seeing Luthor Vandross on tape been a long time brother.

5884679,5,B00E1LRCY6,"I really thought the documentary was extremely well done and well balanced.  The back up singers were by far the most talented people you've ""never"" seen.  We were of course given the usual justification for why they hadn't made it to star by an industry that favors the people who understand the business -- and have the requisite amount of ice water in their veins.  And how has that worked for the music industry? According to Rolling Stone January 8, 2014, ""digital music sales dropped for the first time since the iTunes store launched in 2003, according to new year-end data from Nielsen SoundScan, Track sales decreased 6 percent, despite massive hits, overall album sales, including CDs, were down 8 percent.""

All in all music as an industry suffers from a lack of quality content, (and listeners too, funny how that works)  maybe they should get rid of people who understand the business and can navigate its choppy waters and promote people who can sing, like the artists in this documentary.

A meritocracy is not just about artists turning into piranhas to navigate the industry; it's about keeping the business profitable.  So keep ignoring the talented people in your ranks and keep them 20 feet from stardom.  How's that working for you?",1396310400,5,1253,4.877358490566038

5884684,5,B00E1LRCY6,"While I found the whole movie to be extremely interesting and very well done, the phrase ""back-up singer"" seems somewhat misused here.  Darlene Love was the lead on at least one #1 hit sadly credited to the Crystals and her voice is one of the most easily recognizable in rock history.  She's been inducted into the rock hall of fame.  Her inclusion as an unsung hero seems a bit odd.  Merry Clayton's performance on ""gimme shelter"" completely steals the song.  Without her it would be just another good Stones song.  With her, it's spine tingling.  Her singing of the words ""rape, murder, it's just a shot away"" are earth shattering.  Words cannot describe the power behind what she gives this song.  I don't think any one of these women was as great as Aretha, however (as some have suggested).  Aretha transcended genre and she could not be denied.  The point is that there should have been room for all of them at the top.  It came down to luck and material.  Nobody here was singing music as accessible yet soulful as ""Chain of Fools"" or ""Respect"".  I think if Clayton had found the right song in the 70s she would have been a big star.  But the movie is really a joy from beginning to end, and the talent on display is mind boggling.",1396137600,,1239,4.46875

It won a well deserved Oscar.  There is a lot of talent here, and some tragedy as well.  These stories are emblematic of the role of women in music.  They each keep their dignity and pride, despite being essential but un-rewarded.  Remember that Luther Vandross was a back up?  There are only so many spots on the beach, it seems, and the documentary shows.  Well done.",1396137600,,580,4.314814814814815
5884696,5,B00E1LRCY6,"The few who have made it to known-name status (Sheryl Crow, for example) aren't explored here, since the real story is what music gets from the singers who are willing to be 20 feet away from the known face.

And thankfully, these backup singers have persevered in their careers, stardom or not.

I had always loved the injections of soul in much of the white folks' rock of the 60s and 70s, and wondered who they were--that haunting voice on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon (Clare Torry, not interviewed here); the kickass vocals on the Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter (Merry Clayton, interviewed extensively here); or the soul-injections provided on David Bowie's Young Americans (interviewed, with great live footage of a contemporary performance). No matter how much I loved the pop and rock on its own merits (and I was a huge Elton John fan in the 70s), I always felt the music more intensely when there were these soul background layers in the music.

So the documentary is fascinating and full of both interview tidbits and great musical clips from back in the day, as well as present day renditions. Some of today's continuing presences, such as Judith Hill and Lisa Fischer, was especially riveting for the obvious current contributions they are making to music in our time.

As for Mick, and Sting, and even Bruce, while I was interested to hear what they had to say, in the end it just seemed a little washed-out and insincere--shrugged shoulders and ""Yeah, she was a beautiful girl, and she could sing, but backup singers aren't the stars.""",1396137600,,1554,4.787313432835821

5884717,5,B00E1LRCY6,"I have loved all types of music since the time I was a tot.  As such, music is like oxygen to me and I've listened countless times to the songs they listed in this movie, wondering, ""OMG, who is that voice?"" Oftentimes, I like the song especially because of the back-up singer/s.

Got goose-bumps in several places along the viewing continuum.  Some of the things I would have liked was a more compact, less disjointed (hopped around a bit) presentation.  It left me wondering how these singers are paid - flat fee or royalties?  I would have liked the list of those they sang with to stay up longer so I could wrap my mind around each collaboration while hearing the music in my head as I read them.

I think Sting was right-on, pondering why some reach stardom and are not always the most talented.  (luck) For example, I've always loved Darlene's voice. Always.  She far-eclipsed the whiney, nasally, limited range of Diana Ross.  I  turned off all Supremes' songs whenever they  came on (sorry, Mary and Flo).  Darlene's talent, as well as those others featured in this film, should have soared them to the heights.

At the end of the day, the industry is controlled by men.  And I won't even say white men, although it's a fact.  And they were - and are - the puppet masters.  I think that anyone in the entertainment business has to develop a thick skin for rejection and be able to accept it as a given.  It was sad to hear so many regrets - both spoken and unspoken.

Now I wish all of them would tour together.  That's a concert I'd definitely attend.  Perhaps some of the payment, besides the money, was the fun.  It definitely seems as though that's a thread that ran through everyone's stories.  It was wonderful to see the light and energy return when they were talking about some of the gigs.

5884720,5,B00E1LRCY6,"In the beginning of this documentary, Bruce Springsteen talks about 'The Long Walk To Stardom', and for the backup singers that this documentary follows that walk is 20 feet. What an extraordinary film this is, and the singers who talk about their favorite backups give credence to the world of music.

This documentary directed by Morgan Neville introduces us to voices we have heard for years. One of the most clarifying moments for me was to hear that the lyrics of songs we most often sing were the ones sung by the backup singers. How very true. We meet Darlene Love who started as a backup singer and after many years she decided she just had to get out there, and she made a name for herself. Darlene Love accepted the Oscar when this documentary won in that category, and she sang the roof off the house.

Some of the memorable backup singers are Merry Clayton  who sang the refrains of 'rape, murder, it's just a shot away' to the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" in 1989. We meet the fabulous, Claudia Lennear, and my favorite  Lisa Fischer, now 54, who can sing anything and you will stop and listen. Tata Vega, now 61, who has a voice to be reckoned with,and the new phenomenom, Judith Hill, 29, who is destined to be a star.

Morgan Neville was able to find icons of song, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Bette Midler, Sting and Mick Jagger, to discuss the need and the brilliance of these backup singers. These are superb moments, especially as they wonder how and why these backups have not become popular singular stars. Many anecdotes are shared by both icons and the backups, and that is what gives this film its special brilliance.

I cannot say enough superlatives about this documentary. Anyone who loves music, and needs music in their lives will appreciate this film.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-26-14",1395792000,5,1829,4.714733542319749

This movie is great if you like music because you'll know the songs but you may be unaware of the part the men and women shown here played in your songs. Two poignant moments:
1-Hearing the back-up singer track from the Stones ""Gimmie Shelter"" in isolation and feeling the secondary chill that they must have felt firsthand that night.
2- Realizing that many of these artist unwillingness and sometimes inability to get ""fame"" becomes secondary to their absolute commitment to making songs and artist sound great.

As you will for the mega-talented singers who you'll also meet in this film that -- and it's about time -- gives credit where credit is due, to the mega-talented studio and background singers who toiled behind the headliners (hence the title) and/or gave the world gigantic hit performances but were robbed of proper acknowledgement.

Also after watching this film, go back and look at the liner notes of your pop music albums. You'll see their names. Over and over again.

This documentary also questions the issue of what constitutes ""stardom"" and true ""success."" Becoming rich and famous relies on talent, luck, persistence and being at the right place at the right time -- yet some do not achieve it with all four. Yet, is a life well lived, working in a art form that you love, its own reward. Is the grass always greener? Is being content synonymous with ""settling?""

I don't think being able to hold onto who are and what is dear to you is ""settling."" Regardless of being famous or being ""niche,"" integrity matters, quality matters, and these artists exemplify these attributes.

Even if they aren't household names, how many of the biggest name in entertainment remembered by the general public after more than a few decades? What matters is what they have given us to enjoy and cherish. That is what lives on.

Cheers to you, great makers of music magic.",1395273600,,1548,4.8226415094339625

5884751,5,B00E1LRCY6,"'Twenty Feet From Stardom' looks back on the life and times of great backup singers like Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer Darlene Love and others. This film which won the Academy Award for best documentary last month gives us a chance to see and hear these amazing voices from yesterday today. The filmmaker shows the singers in rare footage performing with music legends - The Beatles, Ray Charles, Bowie, Cream, Lynard Skynard, Ike & Tina Turner - and adds interviews of other stars who talk about the talents of these unheralded singers - Bruce Springsteen, Chris Botti, Sting, Stevie Wonder, Sheryl Crow as well as behind the scenes music producers.

If you are a true music fan you'll want to see this film much like you wanted to see 'Standing in the Shadows of Motown' when that came out a few years ago. The filmaker - Morgan Neville catches up with these back-up singers today. In interviews they reflect back on their musical journey (and give us some impromptu entertainment along the way). You will hear stories about how the back up singers were not properly credited or compensated for their work - in one instance Ms. Love talks about how Phil Specter used her voice on records credited to 'the Crystals.' No doubt things like this happened in the music world. But the story is not a negative or bitter one. The film embraces their considerable talent. The singers we see today are energized, articulate and empowered women who have added to the soundtrack of our lives.",1395273600,,1480,4.7587548638132295
5884752,5,B00E1LRCY6,"The film focuses on background singers whose careers stretch from the early 1960s to the present day. Among the points of interest is the view of some of the black singers of the racial elements of background singing, especially early on when, as they tell it, white background singers relied on reading music while black singers who learned harmony by singing spontaneously in church relied on musical instincts, with very different results. Tales of often uncredited work for acts from Gene Autrey to the Beach Boys to the Rolling Stones are initially surprising, but it soon becomes clear that this relatively small group of artists has had a much larger and wider role than most of us ever suspected.

The film includes material from many background singers but centers on a few natural stars, particularly Darlene Love, the Waters family, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, Tata Vega, and Judith Hill. In the deleted scenes and other extra features, as interesting as the film itself, we see more about, among others, Jo Lawry, who often appears in the film but whose story didn't make the final cut. All the extra features are worth seeing.",1395273600,,1140,4.9375
5884753,4,B00E1LRCY6,"""20 Feet from Stardom"" explores what musical performance is like from the perspective of those just behind the star.  The film is about backup singers.  The subjects of the documentary are able to live out their dreams on stage and in the recording booth.  Some may desire more fame and fortune, but most seem content where they are - after all, not everyone is comfortable in the spotlight.

What I found most interesting is how many of these backup vocalists are every bit as talented as the big stars.  It really shows how many people deserve to have stardom but never get the chance to be front and center.  The great thing about this documentary is that it gives a few of these ladies their moment to shine.

Having said that, there are some pacing problems in the film.  Certain portions of the film were a bit boring to me, while other moments I thought could have been explored further.  But that is the nature of documentary filmmaking, the director used what he had and cut together the best possible film - one that is both enlightening and entertaining.

So overall, if you enjoy music and/or performance, I would recommend this film.

Side Note: This film won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.  I saw all five nominated documentary features (and also many of the documentary short subjects), and I thought many of them were actually better than this one.  So I'll use this space to recommend a few of my favorites: ""The Act of Killing"", ""Cutie and the Boxer"", and the short doc ""Cavedigger"".",1395187200,,1510,4.652830188679245

This film shows that in so many ways if you look a bit deeper into it. It's not always being in the right place at the right time. It takes a whole lot more than just luck,a prayer and talent when it comes to success in the entreatment industry, and the competition is excessively strong. One thing this film showed me was that all the wanna-bes that go on shows like American Idol and The Voice, et al have less of a chance in making it as one does in finding a bag of gold at the end of a rainbow. It takes a whole lot more than luck and a good voice to make it to the top. Even paying your dues doesn't guarantee anything. One needs every single aspect of stage presence to make it to the top. It's the same in any field, but in the music industry where there are hundreds of thousands of very talented people out there you better be great beyond words in every aspect possible.

I'm also surprised that Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent Wilson - two Motown backup singers who later teamed up with Tony Orlando to form Dawn - were excluded. There are also interviews with Mick Jagger, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Sting (whose comments about ""American Idol"" are spot-on), Bette Midler, Patti Austin, and more.

Bonus features include deleted scenes, a mini-documentary called ""The Buddy System,"" and a New York Times TV Q&A session with Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, and director Morgan Neville. Very entertaining.

The movie's main drawback is that its focus should have been broader, and not limited to only black female backup singers; there are many talented white, Asian, Hispanic, and male backups as well.

You know who else was a great backup singer? The late Linda McCartney.

I learned to improvise from an early age.  I never wanted to be a soloist, rather would always enjoy playing harmonies.  As a singer in later life, I just wanted to do ""back up vocals"".  I always thought I was just being ""insecure"" in only wanting to do back up vocals.

This movie really spoke to me in so many ways.  ""we knew our part in life"", one of the artist said, ""and we just joined in"".  How very inspirational the movie was to me - hum if only I had seen this documentary when I was younger,  - I would have pursued my dreams as a ""back up "" artist.  Now that I am retired from the engineering profession, I just have to laugh, instead of cry.

We all choose our 'positions in life"". I can see now WHY I always was a great ""team player"" later in life. Being an instrumentalist in an orchestra gives you the sense of real Team Playing.

I saw it twice in the theater, it does have some slow parts, but the story and music make up for it, and some surprises on who these gals sang for some groups that were (are) very popular, but I did not follow that closely. I just bought the DVD as well.

The CD which I bought by mistake is not worth the $$.",1394755200,,540,4.037383177570093
5884808,5,B00E1LRCY6,"Lots of stars and profiles of some of the greatest backup singers in the business.  The music is in bits and pieces, in between interviews and history.  Some of the history is pretty seamy, especially when Phil Spector's abusive treatment and exploitation of Darlene Love is covered. Most of it is just interesting if you're into music and wondered why so many of those great background singers never became stars.",1394755200,,414,4.9

5884810,3,B00E1LRCY6,"background singers are talented artists but many don't break into stardom because that requires well written songs with catchy hooks (and a good singer may not be a good songwriter, and the better songs being circulated will most likely be offered to established singers from songwriters aiming to make a name for themselves - I mean, if you're trying to become a successful songwriter would you rather have had Frank Sinatra singing your stuff or Joe Shmoe?); also required, a good team behind you, and luck.  you also need to have a solid sense of your own self worth (maybe even an elevated sense of your self worth to help you battle in such a dog eat dog business), and determination. abit of beauty and youth doesn't hurt. it was nice seeing some of the faces of the background talent who have sung on so many of my favorite songs. had the majority of the artists featured here become stars, they would've significantly enriched the world musically, but they're still alive and it's not over yet. I hope they all make it. One of my favorite singers in this film was the world class background singer who is so talented that she's multilingual and teaches Spanish as her Plan B: impressive. 3 and 1/2 stars.

P.S. Great seeing so many stars. Some of my favorites were the Rolling Stones. I really like seeing older people (not saying they're old), who look their age, who obviously haven't had nips and tucks. The faces of the Rolling Stones band members look lived in; craggly and interesting. I understand why famous people have plastic surgery, no judgement here, but when you see famous people who haven't had it, or have had only a tiny tweek here or there, they look almost exotic by comparison.",1394668800,,1706,4.664451827242525
5884811,5,B00E1LRCY6,"What a delightful movie, on the stars behind the stars. I find the film informative, and entertaining. I always used to keep my eyes on the background singers before. But now I have an idea of the history, and why. For music fans of all genres, will not disappoint.",1394668800,,265,4.428571428571429
5884812,4,B00E1LRCY6,"I guess I never really wondered where back up singers went.  I'm in my mid-30's, so the new wave pop that was rolling out when I was a kid had already moved beyond a lot of the sounds that back up singers brought to pop music.  It was a more sterile time I guess.  That said, who doesn't love the Motown sound?

20 Feet from Stardom gives a great, candid look at a so many women that did a bit of the 'grunt work' of pop music for so many years.  It feels like a film about the power and work ethic of women, not only in the music industry, but in general.  It had a very 'girl power' feel to it.  Not a bad thing at all, but the overall tone of the film resonated much deeper with my wife than with myself.

You can't really knock it, 20 Feet from Stardom just won the Oscar award for Best Documentary.  It's certainly a very fine film that shines a light on a shadow of what the music business used to be (or still is?), and shows the viewer something they probably have never seen before.  Worth a look.",1394668800,,1006,4.010050251256281
5884813,5,B00E1LRCY6,"I knew a few things about some of the more famous background singers who made it as solo artists, such as Luther Vandross, Bette Midler and Barry Manilow. However, I was surprised by the number of spectacular singers, such as Merry Clayton and Darlene Love, who never reached those heights. The film is a good lesson in perseverance, networking and the unbelievable role luck plays in attaining success. It should be noted that in some cases, the artists prefer to remain as background singers and don't covet the spotlight that shines on solo artists. Lisa Fischer is one example of that. Overall, it's an entertaining and informative documentary and deserves the Academy Award it won for Best Documentary.",1394582400,,707,5.0

Not saying that it wasn't informative, but the story (the ongoing job market for back-up singers) was no different than any other supply and demand commodity.  I would rather the script was more about the positive contributions they made.

5884835,5,B00E1LRCY6,"Watching this disc (I didn't see the film in a theatre while it was playing here in Denver) took me back and made me very, very happy that I had purchased (or traded discs - I previously worked for two major recording labels while still living in NY) the solo albums (yes I have them on vinyl!) of Lisa Fisher, Claudia Lennear, Merry Clayton, Tata Vega, and Darlene Love.  Although I was familiar with some of their personal stories, to hear them lay it out there, and to hear their contemporaries speak to these performers talents was wonderful.  (It also took me back to my days in a vocal group when we hoped/thought we might be the next Supremes, et al.)  I knew that Judith Hill would have been part of Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT tour and I also saw her (singing background) on the recent CBS special, THE NIGHT THAT CHANGED AMERICA which celebrated the Beatles first performance on the Ed Sullivan show fifty years ago.  I hope that she will very shortly be recognized for her talent and will be standing in front of the ""star's mic.""  It was also great to hear the celebrities: Bruce, Mick, Sting, Chris Botti, etc. ""testity"" to the talents of these singers.  In going through my ""vast"" vinyl collection, I recalled that some other singers featured like The Waters Family, Gloria Jones and so on, were featured singing background on quite a number of my albums.  I just don't understand why these performers never received their proper due for their talents!?!

If you are as ""rabid"" a fan as I am for good vocals and want to know more about these performers who (in my opinion) shouldn't have been relegated to be just ""20 Feet [or more!] From Stardom ... purchase this DVD!!!  And it won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature on March 2nd!!!!",1394496000,2,1762,4.568253968253968

5884849,4,B00E1LRCY6,"I highly anticipated seeing this doc, yet felt strangely unsatisfied by the end. The concept was wonderful, but the execution not as strong as I'd hoped for.; were I to use ""hit record talk"", the film cracked the top Twenty, but stalled short of the Top 5 I was actually expecting. Surely they could've tracked down a somewhat broader group of the background singers, By keeping the focus on only a few individuals, amazingly talented as they are, the whole thing felt a little thin and less exciting than I'd imagined it would be. Where were The Raeletts? The Blossoms, who even the ladies in this film acknowledged as being the trailblazer background group before any of them started getting session work? How many records did The Cookies do back- up on before they hit the charts with ""Chains""? Ever heard of The Andantes? They sang on many of Motown's magical tracks. Where was Martha Wash? Didn't Doris Troy sing on ""Dark Side of the Moon""? Perhaps some of these people are no longer with us, but if PBS can find them for the fantastic oldies shows they have been featuring here in L.A. it makes me wonder why the makers of this movie concentrated on so few singers. I also would've liked the ladies interviewed, not their record company reps, to offer some thoughts on why they felt their solo records didn't hit; I'm sure they all had opinions on this, even if a few sparks might've erupted on-camera.  I wasn't looking for bitterness, angst, and regret, but it would've been really interesting to know why they felt their big shots at the limelight sputtered. I am a huge fan of Darlene Love, (""He's a Rebel"" is one of the greatest pop singles ever made!) but a little more love to a wider range of those who were ""20 Feet"" away would've made this movie better for me. It certainly helped the film's exposure to have such artists as Springsteen, Sting, Jagger, and other luminaries show their love for the ladies, but frankly it didn't result in much more than predictable accolades.. Yes, I basically enjoyed this film, but I thought Muscle Shoals was a far more moving and musically stirring documentary. I wanted my socks rocked off by this, but it was just a pleasant way to spend some time. Nevertheless, congrats on the Oscar win, and yes, ladies, you are all stars to those of us who bought all those amazing and timeless records you sang on..",1394409600,,2358,4.614285714285714
5884850,5,B00E1LRCY6,I really enjoyed this movie.  This makes me want to see a film or documentary on the blossoms.  The background singers need to be recognized and thanked for all that they do to make a song come to life.,1394409600,,202,4.153846153846154
5884851,2,B00E1LRCY6,"This movie bored me. I am sure there are many other back-up singers in Los Angeles and on Broadway who could have been included in this film. A documentary film such as this needs a little more diversity and less focus on one singer. Having some of the singers that hired these back-ups in the film, would have made it a little more universal and would have created a great story line. I don't know if the budget was small, or the producers too old to know there is a whole universe of ages and races who would have been inspired by the true message he ""tried"" to complete. It failed miserably in its mail focus..........perhaps next time.",1394409600,5,639,4.423728813559322

The stories are very interesting and enlightening about the music industry and the voices are unbelievable - especially Lisa Fischer.

We heard about it from a friend who did a good job of describing it (I think she heard about it on the Academy Awards) - and decided to set aside time to rent it from Amazon Prime.

The interviews with artists were startling - in some cases scenes of them when they were young right next to recent footage of them as seniors, they've been entertaining us for decades. I don't remember ever knowing exactly how backup singers were exploited or cornered into their jobs singing backup for the ""stars,"" to the exclusion of ever having a career as lead vocalists themselves.

This made me want to listen to old songs again, this time with a different perspective on the whole song, and more appreciation for how different they would sound without the contributions made by backup singers.",1394150400,,883,4.611464968152866

Honestly it has made me  re-exam at a lot of the music that I love/loved  throughout my life and listen to it with new ears. Considering that I've listened to some of this stuff hundreds if not thousands of times, that in itself is no small gift.

5884926,4,B00E1LRCY6,"As I write, this film won last night's Oscar for best documentary. I don't think I'd go so far, but I guess it was worth it hear Darlene Love sing some more, even if only for a minute or so.

And the singing here is the attraction. There is a lot of it and it is uniformly wonderful. While I can happily live without the Sting parts, it's not like they detract.

Much of the film focuses on Darlene Love. While this is always going to be a good thing, it does make the title a bit disingenuous: while contemporary pop music scene is likely, sadly, unfamiliar with her and her amazing voice and style, Love has certainly spent a good deal of time right there IN stardom. Certainly her vocals were slotted under a number of different group names (the Crystals, most notably, along with Bobby Soxx and the Blue Jeans, etc., and so on), anyone paying attention to pop and popular R&B in the 1960s knew and revered her, and, if they are still alive, like I am, still adore and revere her.

The film does provide the occasional insight into the life of the career background singer, and does bring some wonderful singers into the spotlight for well-deserved bows, in a lot of ways this is a film for the general, not-paying-enough-attention audience. And that makes this a worthwhile project and earns it's popularity. It is an easy and enjoyable view. Extra kudos for some deconstructing of Lou Reed's Walk on the Wild Side and how its use of the background vocals underscore its lyrics.

In all, this feels a little light-weight, but while I might raise an eyebrow as to its Oscar-worthiness (Oscar-worthiness being a whole different topic, ultimately), I cannot but recommend this as a great time overall. Fun and happiness are in short supply these days and this film provides a good deal of both. And who could possibly frown on listening to more Darlene Love?",1393804800,,1859,4.590361445783133

This documentary taught me about the role of background singers and how important they are despite often being overshadowed by lead singers. They are an integral part of any performance and any recording but I used to look at the name of the recording artist and not the background singers when buying cd or album.  As a result of this documentary this will change. I will read about the background singers and listen to their voices as well.

This documentary also shined the light on these background singers and let me hear them sing solo or with other background singers.  As a result my ears heard some very special music. This is a joy to the ears. The extras on this dvd included deleted scenes which allow the viewer to hear even more amazing music from these singers.

The documentary is put together well. There is a nice mixture of music and story. One of the extras includes question and answers with Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and director Morgan Neville.",1393718400,,1241,4.618181818181818
5884928,5,B00E1LRCY6,"What a treasure to have these wonderful singers highlighted.  After watching 20 Feet from Stardom youll never hear these vintage songs in the same way again.  All the singers featured are backup singers but what a misnomer.  They are talented!  Most of them never made it to headline status or if they did it was for a brief time.  Their voices are unmistakable and youll recognize them immediately.  People like Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Judith Hill, Lisa Fischer and Luther Vandross with Luther being an exception and going on to have a solo career.  Uncannily they are able to give the featured artist a sound they didn't even know they wanted or didn't think they could achieve.  Making someone else look and sound better is a rare talent.

What they all have in common is an uncanny level of musicianship.  They have the rare talent to change their style as needed in order to blend with each soloist, each band and their fellow back up artists.  They put their egos aside and become part of a balanced group in order to support the overall sound.  This might sound easy but its not.  Ive played in and heard orchestras and ensembles where one person or a section of musicians is determined to stand out to the detriment of the whole.  Im sure youve heard this too.

5884934,4,B00E1LRCY6,"Have you ever sat in a club or otherwise heard the performance of a musician and wondered how someone this good is relatively unknown.  This well-made documentary directed by Morgan Neville tells the stories of numerous back-up singers going back many decades.  Most of the singers are black women and many are as talented as the headliners they support.  Offering testimony throughout the film are interview snippets from Bruce Springsteen, Mick Jagger, Sting, Stevie Wonder, Chris Botti and Cheryl Crow (once a backup singer herself).

While individual struggles differ, these great voices never made it to headliner status.  The film focuses on Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and Claudia Linnear.  But there are numerous others interviewed.  Most of these ladies have several things in common.  Most come from a gospel background.  Most can easily adapt to various musical genres.  And all love to sing.  In fact that last item is why most remain in supporting roles.  All tried to headline but few succeeded, so in order to sing, they fell back into the backup role.  In one case (Lisa Fischer), her preference was to backup.  She didn't want the angst, pressure and scheduling obligation of headlining.

This is a highly entertaining (plenty of music), informative and sometimes heartbreaking Oscar nominated film.  Highly recommended.

The Blu ray disc is technically very well done.  The video comes in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  As you might expect, the documentary features many older clips from TV and printed material.  Some is certainly not the quality of modern technology, but they look excellent here.  Clear and always watchable.  The more current material is perfectly presented.  Excellent balance, deep black levels, with crisp, clear definition throughout.  The audio come in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and again is perfect.  The interviews are always very clear and understandable.  The musical segments really shine with the full effect of the surrounds in place.  Subtitles come in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras are minimal and include some deleted scenes, a Q & A session with some of the ladies and the director, and a 9 minute piece called ""The Buddy System"" about the skills needed as a backup singer.",1393632000,2,2247,5.132596685082873

But this really only focused on a handful of singers and mostly music that was before my time, even though I am in my mid fifties. I'm not sure why I was bored, but somehow the film didn't really penetrate the subject. But the singers are, of course, fabulous. Perhaps if these stories comprised just the first twenty minutes and then went on from there toward a larger scope, I would have loved it. I think I expected and wanted an overview of the whole industry, not just the beginning players.

5884954,4,B00E1LRCY6,"I have friends who LOVED this movie enough to see it twice in the theater.

Frankly, I'm not quite as enthused, though it's nice to see the people with the great voices acknowledged, especially the ones who were never given credit for their work.  The best moment for me was hearing the backing vocal on the Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" by itself and the story behind its creation.

That said, the movie never really examines why some people with great voices stay background singers rather than becoming front people.  While some of the reasons are touched upon -- Bruce Springsteen and Lou Adler note that producers and songwriters play a part -- not one person mentions the ""It"" factor, or talks about whether any of these singers have it, or talks about how much writing your own songs plays into it.  There's only a brief discussion of industry racism, and no real sense of how radio in the '70s, particularly, limited the number of girl acts it would play.

A lot of people will disagree with my opinion that the movie is short on insight, but for me 20 Feet From Stardom was interesting primarily for the music history and the long overdue recognition of some of these singers.  But I was left with the sense that a lot of what could have been the best parts never got explored as a trade-off for getting the well-known performers to appear.  As a result, personal recollections take precedence over context.  It's not bad, just not my preference.

A worthwhile view for music fans.",1393372800,,1484,4.6513409961685825

It gives me pause to think about how many songs have been made great (or at least greater) because of the backup singers whose names we usually don't even know. Yes, some have made the move from backup singing to star (Darlene Love, Luther Vandross, and others) but most stay in the background, working just as hard as the stars.

This is one of a handful of movies that I know I will watch again, more than once.

Have to say, Darlene Love's annual performance of ""Christmas, Baby Please Come Home"" on Letterman's show is a must-view in our home. Her career in the Blossoms was legendary and she still has ""IT.""",1393372800,,722,4.546153846153846

Their story reminds me of so many struggles of artists and performers, from novelists to stand-up comices. Some of them achieve minor success but it's a matter of luck and timing regardless of talent. And after someone's done a lot of backup, it might be hard to move those critical 20 feet to the spotlight.

The movie explores the stories of singers who created the sound we know as Motown. It's well done as a documentary, but it's very hard to watch.

Love was hamstrung by a restrictive contract she signed with Phil Spector.  For both Clayton and Lennear their solo careers never took off despite, or because of, the efforts of their record companies.  After winning a Grammy for her debut effort Fischer couldn't get the creative juices going for a follow-up. Another singer, Judith Hill, is briefly profiled and the film relates how she was going to tour with Michael Jackson before he died unexpectedly. These women are real troopers and they relay their stories with a lot of humor.

5884999,5,B00E1LRCY6,"Stunning, enlightening and informative, thoroughly entertaining... all good words to describe this documentary. It is so good in so many ways, space does not permit listing them all.

For starters, I had no idea who I was hearing during the formative years of my musical taste development. From about 1963-1975 or thereabouts, these people provide the contrast in the overall sound so the stars of the piece can shine. From their description of the experiences, you can tell that these people, primarily women, had a great time doing the backup vocals for some of the biggest acts of those years. For example, we get to hear from Brown Sugar herself, Claudia Lennear, what it was like to sing with the early Stones... and to have posed for Playboy during that time.

Harmonies... when 2 or 3 of these people get together, some magic tends to happen. It is not easy to put together backing vocal harmonies but these singers have put in the work to make it look like a piece of cake. At times, they hear the song... and they know exactly what to do. They can also take direction, but I liked the segments where they were given the barest of instructions KNOWING that they would knock it out of the park if left to their own devices.

There's a segment with Sting and he's working on an upcoming LIVE concert and he features Lisa Fischer's background portion. Listening to the nuance of emotions she can put in her voice will STOP you dead in your tracks. She has nothing short of a World Class singing voice. During this segment, she demonstrates her artistry when given minimal instruction of what the artist wants.

Lisa, Jo Lawry and Judith Hill were the true revelations for me here. I had never heard of any of them before, but, believe me, I will be searching out their work and obtaining some for my music library.

When you get into the soul ladies, you find Darlene Love, Merry Clayton and Claudia Lennear. These women flat belt that s*** out! If you don't feel good after listening to these gals sing, you don't have a heart.

Think of the 'hook' part of famous songs... these people sang the parts that YOU sing when those songs come on the radio or your stereo or your iPod. That was an interesting nugget to find out here.

If you are any kind of a fan of great singing and the human voice as an instrument, you will be thrilled to watch this film. Very well written and edited, it flat moves along.

Then I hit the Deleted Scenes feature and... BOOM! I just hit PLAY ALL and it played and seemed to be sequenced the same as the main material. I've watched both the main feature and this bonus material twice and they are equally powerful. Here you will find some extended or complete versions of songs you heard only snippets of in the main program and they will leave you breathless. Judith Hill's closing song will hurt you in a real good way.

Sometimes you come across something like this material and because of what it teaches you, it makes a lot of the music in your collection seem brand new again. What's that worth?",1392940800,,3037,4.507272727272727

5885002,4,B00E1LRCY6,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable documentary on several of the very best ""backing vocals"" ladies who have provided such vocal power to bands like the Stones, Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs & Englishmen band, and far too many to list here. The focus is primarily on Merry Clayton (responsible for the backing vocal stunner on the Stones' Gimme Shelter), Darlene Love (part of Phil Spector's greatest hits) and Claudia Lennear, who was a powerhouse on so many albums in the late '60s and early '70s, but retired to teach as a living. And that is the only flaw of this documentary: most of the film centers on Merry Clayton and Darlene Love, plus Love's sister, Edna Wright who also sang as a back-up singer, but to a lesser degree. Time is also given to Lisa Fischer, a contemporary backing vocalist who can still be seen if one looks close enough (the Beatles' Ed Sullivan debut all star tribute, most recently). And it is interesting and often sad to learn of the fate of those who are or were, literally, twenty feet from the stars they supported so skillfully, I would have liked to have seen more stage footage and a few more stories from other backing vocalists past and present. But a good film overall.",1392854400,,1197,4.598130841121495
5885003,5,B00E1LRCY6,"I am probably the perfect target audience for this documentary film: I grew up during the height of the 1960s music explosion (I was about 10 when the Beatles came around) and I was fortunate enough to have been a Motown fan from the time that I was 11 or 12 years old and I spent much of my adult life on the outskirts of the music industry (as a concert producer and an FM DJ). I grew up in a musical family and the soul and R&B music of the 60s (in particular) and beyond was at the very core of my musical world. I used to lay on the floor of my bedroom when I was a kid listening to the Raylettes sing on live Ray Charles' albums and I was a Phil Spector addict from day one (the music, not the man). Later I  became (and I still am) an enormous fan of Van Morrison (he carries the torch of great vocal backups like no one else) and great backing vocals are like a drug in my soul: they reach me even deeper than the lead vocals most of the time. I first saw the great Tina Turner with the Ike and Tina Turner Soul Review (Tina you rock the world) with the Ikettes at Madison Square Garden, opening for the Rolling Stones on the 1969 ""Let it Bleed"" tour.

All of which is to say: this documentary found a great home in my heart. ""20 Feet of Stardom"" is a documentary that is so long overdue, I wondered if it would ever be made. This video tells the story of the soulful backup singers (many who should have been frontline singers, no question) who helped make the careers of people like Otis Redding (RIP, Otis), Ray Charles, Tina Turner, the Rolling Stones and countless many others. To hear the behind-the-scenes journeys of these singers tell the story of what it was like to be the voices-behind-the-voice in their own words is just so amazing. Some of the stories quite nearly rip your heart out: the magnificent Darlene Love (perhaps the greatest soul singer of all time) who gave up music to clean houses, who was abused and re-abused by the inglorious Phil Spector (rot in jail Phil) and sold like a commodity and to see her climb out of that and step back into her destiny is something I've been waiting to know about my whole life. And God bless David Letterman for reaching into this woman's life and letting millions upon millions of people KNOW whose voice it was that Phil Spector built his career on. What David Letterman (and Paul Shaffer) did for for the history of rock and roll and for Darlene  with his Christmas show is reason enough--IS REASON ENOUGH--to put David Letterman in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

It is so wonderful to hear the stories of legendary backup singers like Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, Claudia Lennear, Judith Hill and Tata Vega told by some of the greatest names in music: Bruce Springtseen, Mick Jagger, Sting, Stevie Wonder, Bette Midler: this is the art of the music documentary at its height. You know that Mick Jagger and Bruce Springsteen understood the significance of this film project just by their openness in agreeing to be so extensively interviewed for it.

Personally I think there could easily be a sequel to this documentary because, if anything, there are many more stories to be told here. One interesting note that developed during the storyline of this documentary is that throughout the history of R&B and R&R and the interesting way that the British Invasion helped to meld the two, particularly for American audiences, is the underlying racial tension that existed. To their great credit, none of the performers interviewed blame any of their misfortunes (and there were many) on racism, but you can see that there was a constant thread of racism that seeped (and sometimes stepped) into the music industry during this entire era. I think that should be explored more: we should all know the prices paid by the performers that we listened to so casually and enjoyed so much. These singers were and are so anonymous, so deep in the shadows of glory that now every time I see an anonymous person humming on the street, I'll have to wonder if he or she didn't help build the music industry.

More than anything, this documentary shows you just what the title states: these are the women (and some men) who stood 20 feet from glory, 20 feet from stardom, 20 feet from another destiny to live in the shadows of wealth and superstardom. Some are grateful they lived in the shadows, some live with a wistful ""what might have been"" perspective. But all know full well that they are the voices and it was upon their souls and lives that rock and roll and R&B were built. There was a much less powerful Ray Charles without the Raylettes, there was NO Gimme Shelter without Merry Clayton and there was NO Phil Spector without a lot of great women singers, most notably Darlene Love.

This is a superb film. There are omissions (Van Morrison's use of great backing vocals for more than 40 years isn't mentioned, I think he should have been mentioned) and there is very little mention of Otis Redding and some others. But overall, if you want to know the true story of the history of rock and roll, this film puts it in a first-person perspective. I've been doing FM radio for 20+ years and knew almost all of the music in the film, have played most of it on the air, but much of what I learned was completely enlightening. The most profound thing I came to realize in watching this i that Darlene Love is the soul of rock and roll. She may be the greatest singer alive.",1392854400,,5435,4.461770623742455
5885004,5,B00E1LRCY6,"OK, I grew up when much of this was going on so watching the movie was like watching Rock & Roll history being made, and I was there.

It is a great movie about a great group of people. Since I have always been a fan of bass players and backup singers I found the movie fascinating. People like Mary Clayton and Claudia Lennear have always been favorites and I learned new names such as Tata Vega and Lisa Fischer. Lisa Fischer is amazing! If you are my age (60+) watch this movie and if you are younger, watch it anyway.

5885018,5,B00E1LRCY6,"If you're a singer, even if its karaoke, you need to watch this film. If you're a music buff, you need to watch this film.  If you're a human being, you need to watch this film.  What's the difference between a solo artist in the spotlight, and the back up singers who make them sound great? Usually, the difference isn't talent, or drive, or ambition. These back up singers are the best of the best, so no one can fault them for choosing not to sacrifice their personal lives, to commit to a life in the insane spot light of the super star. Most of the backing vocalists in the film are African American, and come from a gospel back round. Quite a few have strong jazz chops that would floor Lady Day.  Yet these people are not house hold names, often because the industry is not set up to allow that. Obviously most of the super stars are white, and male, and most of the back up singers are black, and female. Quite a few of their stories will shock you, especially Darlene Love's dip in popularity that had her cleaning houses, and Claudia Lennear's work as a high school Spanish teacher.  Everybody lamented that the age of the back up singer ended in the eighties, when digital pitch correction, and cheap digital multi-track recorders replaced back up singers.

Mostly I was awed by the sheer intensity of the vocal work.  I literally had goose bumps all over my body when Merry Clayton's famous back round vocals for the Rolling Stone's GIMME SHELTER were isolated from the master track and played solo. Whooh! Quite a bit of time is spent showing how the music changed from decade to decade, beginning with Phil Spector's Wall of Sound introducing Darlene Love (The Blossoms), upon who's shoulders every R&B back up singer stands. Next comes the sixties, with Merry Clayton singing for the Stones, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Leon Russell, along with her stunted solo carrier. In the 80s you discover Lisa Fischer, and her pathway backing up new wave and pop musicians, right up to today's biggest back round star, Judith Hill, who would have sang back up for the 2009 Michael Jackson tour had it occurred, as well as appearing on THE VOICE. (The film doesn't cover that, because she was amazingly voted off.)  Sting, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger and Bruce Springsteen appear throughout the film, discussing the various singers. Their insights into what constitutes that invisible line between the world famous singer, and their back up harmony singers, sheds a lot of light on the dynamics of the music industry, and how some people are kept back.  There isn't much that you can criticize the film for, except that some of the big names in R&B back up singers aren't spotlighted, especially Claudie King and Clare Torry (back up singer on Pink Floyd's ""Great Gig in the Sky."")

The film leaves you with the realization that not everybody enjoys the spotlight. That there's a spiritual journey just from sharing your gift of voice, and blending into the chorus.  Not everybody is the preacher, but we can all sing in the choir. Even if you're not a musician, or music buff, you're sure to walk away from the film holding onto that. It's one of those films that get under your skin. If you just rent the film, you won't be able to enjoy the special features, including at least 20 minutes of deleted scenes that bring you closer to the various singers including their gigs singing jingles, a short film called THE BUDDY SYSTEM, and a Q&A with Lisa Fischer and the film's director.",1392854400,,3478,4.649837133550489
5885019,5,B00E1LRCY6,"The documentary 20 Feet From Stardom sheds light on the forgotten 'soldiers' of pop, rock, and soul music: the background vocalists.  20 Feet From Stardom features several components, including how vital the role of background vocalists were back-when, the flawed solo career launches/struggles of the vocalists, and the role of background vocalists in the present age.  From start to finish, the documentary gets the viewer's attention, as the subject matter is captivating, regardless whether you are a musician, music enthusiast, or just a casual film fan.  There is something for everybody to take in.

As a musician myself, I have some insight on being under-recognized and overshadowed by others, regardless of the degree of musical talent.  Even given my own experiences,  20 Feet From Stardom truly illustrated just how underrated such prodigiously talented musicians like Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, and Lisa Fischer (among others) were throughout their career.  Darlene Love often failed to receive credit for her exceptional work in the 60s, including infamously being released as The Crystals, whom lip-synced to Love and company's vocals.  Merry Clayton, who sang alongside the likes of The Rolling Stones, was a true diva, but when her time arrived as a solo artist, it just didn't work out commercially.  The incredibly gifted Lisa Fischer managed to win a Grammy as a solo artist, but following her debut, things just went south.  The stories and situations are endless, and the questions are raised throughout why some background vocalists just can't succeed at the next level, which for many is their dream.

Throughout its 91-minute course, 20 Feet From Stardom is nothing short of spectacular.  It educates both the educated (like myself as a musician) and the uneducated about the difficulties and unfairness that is the music industry.  It paints the both the perks and hardships of being a background vocalist.  Insight from established artists like Sting, Stevie Wonder, and Bruce Springsteen enhances perspective as well.  Ultimately, this is a must-see.  Enthusiastically recommended.",1392768000,3,2111,5.390243902439025

You will enjoy hearing the stories and singing from such famous background singers such as Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, Claudia Lennear, Judith Hill and more.

The film is a wonderful journey from the beginning of the background singers, that started with such stars as Perry Como being surrounded by lovely ladies voices to the deep soulful voices that Darlene Love and her singing companions brought to the top hits of the time. It's great listening to the superstars themselves share stories about the importance of those wonderful voices behind every song. Superstars Sting, Mick Jagger, Bette Midler, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen and more bring a lot of interesting stories to the film.

Merry Clayton, who was one of Ray Charles' Rayettes, is just fascinating to listen to as she goes back in time to share those past memories with us. There are stories that are both shocking and heart breaking as well. I always loved 60's Motown, and when I found out that the Crystals lead singer was lip synching to Darlene Love's voice- I was really shocked. Phil Spector used Darlene Love's voice for other singers, whose songs were huge hits. It's amazing what studio executives could get away with back then.

The most wonderful thing about this dvd, is seeing these wonderful background singers singing back then and singing today. Talent never ages- and their beautiful voices are just as powerful and gorgeous as they were decades ago! For anyone who loves music and would like to learn about the hidden talents of the background singers from decades ago up to today, you will really enjoy this 4 1/2 Star dvd!",1392249600,3,1823,4.931596091205212

And Merry Clayton with her powerful voice takes you to church everytime she opens her mouth to sing.  I can still remember her in a little comedy from the eighties, Maid to Order, in which she portrayed an ex-singer turned housekeeper.  The song she sang in the film, I Can Still Shine, is true of her today.  She still shines.  Watch this film.  It's so uplifting, you'll be humming the songs days later.  Fame is elusive.  I know how hard it is to be successful in a creative forum.  Seems like the harder you try, the worse your luck is.  But the point is, you have to do what you love and the ladies, and men, depicted in this film truly love what they do.

I was originally drawn to this documentary because I am a big fan of Judith Hill. I first heard her sing at Michael Jackson's memorial and I was mesmerized by her vocal skill. When she sang on The Voice, it was another chance to be entertained, and it was thrilling!

Once ""20 Feet from Stardom"" began, I realized that hey, I know these other voices too! I may not have known their names, but I know their voices because I have heard those pipes back Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Sting, and the list goes on.

It was a fascinating ride into the lives of these singers and their journeys to the present. If you are a popular music fan, or a music lover, you will be entertained by this movie. Highly recommend!",1391644800,,845,4.509803921568627
5885111,5,B00E1LRCY6,"""20 Feet from Stardom""
(Radius, 2013)
. . .

Profiling several of the best-respected backup singers of the last fifty years, ""20 Feet From Stardom"" is a moving, intelligent exploration of the soulful vocalists who brought gospel music ooompf into American pop and rock.  The film skilfully examines their personal joys and their professional frustrations, their impact on popular music, and the hardships that some have endured.

Everyone gives their props to Darlene Love, the expressive central singer of the Blossoms, a vocal trio who helped define the ""girl group"" sound, and became one of the most in-demand session groups in the early 1960s. The Blossoms were drawn into the orbit of producer Phil Spector, a notoriously manipulative control freak who cynically exploited Love's restrictive contract, repeatedly having her sing the lead on hit singles that were credited to other artists. She finally became so frustrated that she left show business altogether rather than work under Spector's control, returning years later to belated fame and recognition as a solo artist.

Also profiled are singers Lisa Fischer, Tta Vega, Judith Hill and Merry Clayton (famously Mick Jagger's duet partner ""Gimme Shelter"") The film peels away the psychological layers of these tremendously talented artists who either choose the more comfortable role in the background or crave the spotlight, but find the challenges of stardom daunting. For some, it's personality alone that determines their role, and others find their paths blocked by the mechanisms of the music industry... There is both heartbreak and joy in these interviews, and the movie has many genuinely moving moments as well as some stunning and well-chosen archival footage. An excellent film that should be of interest to fans of soul and classic rock. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To World Music)",1391644800,,1857,5.3061224489795915
5885112,5,B00E1LRCY6,"The old axiom is that ""Behind every great man is a great woman."" The movie ""20 Feet From Stardom"" offers its own spin on that, ""Behind every great rocker is a great back up singer.""

""20 Feet From Stardom"" is a documentary about the life and careers of a variety of some of the highest profile ladies (and a few less known men) that have sung behind superstars such as Bruce Springsteen, Mick Jagger, Bette Midler and Sting (among others) all of whom share filmed interviews and praise for these exceptional women.

And their stories are fascinating as is film footage of their past triumphs and their memories of their careers.

Some of the singers profiled are Darlene Love who, as a member of The Blossoms, was the primary voice of the Wall Of Sound producer Phil Spector (currently in jail for murder) who used her vocals on many huge hit records but gave the credit to girl groups that did not otherwise exist and did his best to suppress her career as a solo artist. But the world knew her voice and ultimately she was elected to the Rock'n'Roll Hall Of Fame.

Lisa Fischer sang backup for the late great Luther Vandross (who also started out doing back up work) and he went on to produce a solo album for her including a single that would win her a Grammy award for best R&B Performance by a female vocalist. Yet somehow that success didn't generate stardom and the viewer empathizes as she tells that story. (The footage of Luther as a backup singer and at work as a producer is a treasure this documentary provides).

Judith Hill was on the edge of stardom, beating out hundred of others to become featured backup vocalist for Michael Jackson's ""This Is It"" comeback World Tour. Then one night, as you all know, he went to sleep and never awoke, leaving Judith Hill out of work. She sang at his funeral and turned heads but it wasn't enough to restart her career momentum. We watch as she pays the bills singing backup while working on a solo career that will likely keep her working but not make her a star.

With commentary and footage of Merry Clayton, Patti Austin and Claudia Lennear as well, ""20 Feet From Stardom"" gives us insight into an art form that, with computers and Autotunes, is rapidly disappearing from the music business.

If you listened to the radio in the '70s and '80 you will remember the music and the voices. ""20 Feet From Stardom"" will help you put faces on that beautiful noise.

NOTE: Last night, March 2, 2014, Twenty Feet From Stardom won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.",1391644800,,2525,4.546255506607929
5885113,5,B00E1LRCY6,"These folks are the unsung heroes of popular music. You might not know their names but you will recognize their voices.
My one issue with this movie is the way amazon lists the stars as Sting and Springsteen. The whole point of the movie is that these folks aren't recognized nearly enough for their talents.",1391558400,,308,4.618181818181818
5885114,5,B00E1LRCY6,"This movie charts the careers of several amazing singers, most of whom you've heard a ga-jillion times without knowing who they were. They are backup singers. Among them are Merry Clayton, who delivers the hair-raising vocals that feature on the Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter; Darlene Love, whose imprint is just about everywhere; and Lisa Fischer, who is just plain remarkable on everything she does. As talented as these people are, even more impressive is the fact that many of them have every right to be bitter; yet none of them is. They love what they do, and that's why they do it. This movie, paired with Waiting For Sugarman, are about people imbued with a love of music, without regard for how the music BUSINESS chews a person up and spits them out. It's about how a person should live.",1391558400,,797,4.7
5885125,5,B00E1LRCY6,"This movie is a real treasure, not only for the insight into the history of backup singers and the life of a backup singer, but most especially for the amazing archival footage of actual performances.

I had heard of Merry Clayton, and Darlene Love of course (whom I never thought of as a backup) but some of the other featured singers were a revelation.  I get serious chills watching and listening to Lisa Fischer.  Tata Vega and Judith Hill - amazing.  Seeing these wonderful singers perform with Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, Tom Jones and others was simply riveting.

This movie introduces us to some wonderful artists and we gain an appreciation for their talent and what they have been through.  (Darlene Love made a record and found out when it dropped that The Crystals got the credit!)  It's also an interesting commentary on fame and artistry.  Many of the featured backup singers got their foot in the door to start a solo career but with the exception of Darlene Love (again, a special case), no one has broken through.  Not the right material, not handled or marketed properly, or just not the right artist at the right place and time.  Based on vocal chops alone, they are more than deserving of the big break.

The movie is chock full of interviews with big stars, including Sting who makes the point that any American Idol contestant can win the big prize but most will not have staying power because they don't have the emotional experience to inform their music.  (That's not exactly what he said but that's what I got out of it.)

My only reservation is that the narrative is kind of all over the place.  It is a wonderful intro to these singers and the lifestyle, but beyond that I couldn't tell if the filmmaker had a point to drive home.  When they ran out of good stuff to put in, they ended the movie.  Still, for pure enjoyment, can't be beat.  Anyone who lived through the time will want to share it with their children -  they truly don't make music like this any more and it's a shame.  Highly recommended.",1391558400,,2061,4.581967213114754
5885126,5,B00E1LRCY6,"I really enjoyed this!

One thing I'll say is that I never really noticed that part of the reason I don't like modern music as much is...there's not as good background.  A lot of it is digitized now or ""enhanced"" so you don't get that richness and there aren't as many voices over all.

This documentary highlight several background singers from years past all the way up to the present and some of the trials they've faced from skimpy outfits to stolen credit.

Of course race played a big role...particularly as most background singers over the years have been black and female.  One line I thought was particularly funny was when a group of the girls were reminiscing and ""Monster Mash"" came up and one said ""oh, remember that song where we had to sound white?""  I do kind of wonder though if it really was ALL black after the 1940s or if that's just what the documentary commented on.  I did notice one white girl in the modern scenes singing back up but they didn't talk to her.  Clearly though there's a huge influence and race has played a large part as has gender and sex (appeal).

It was also great to hear some of the artists talk about why they like to work with background singers and what they think of it as well as some of the singers talk about artists.

I did find it somewhat disturbing though that right in the beginning the voiceover implied that some of the girls didn't make it the ""20 feet forward to stardom"" because they didn't want it bad enough.  Some clearly did/do.

And it was also interesting to see how back up singers became so popular (and really a lot of my favorite songs are the kind they sing, so I LOVED the music in this) and now are not as much because they are seen as an added expense when technology can take care of it.  One comment in the movie was how it was now a waste of time to sing perfect because they'd just fix it later.

All in all a very interesting watch.  I liked it and would recommend for anyone who likes documentaries.",1391472000,,1982,4.333333333333333

Everyone in this film has the voice of a megastar...but most didn't want to play the game and  lack the narcissism that often passes for talent.

Many of us in life are ""diamonds in the rough"" and don't get nearly the notice as the headliners do, but are nevertheless absolutely necessary to the balance of life.",1391385600,,515,4.797752808988764
5885133,5,B00E1LRCY6,"I saw this wonderful 91-minute film last April at the WXPN Music Film Festival in Philly (followed by a Q&A and performance by Darlene Love and Lisa Fischer) and could hardly wait till it hit the theaters and home DVD. It played first run theaters last fall and now is out on DVD. And, as I had hoped for, the DVD is loaded with bonuses.
As I post this, there are plenty of reviews of the FILM itself so I won't provide a lot a details on it but I will concentrate on the Bonus Features, which are enough of a reason to get the DVD, even if you saw the film in a theater. I want to also point out that Amazon has a policy of combining all reviews of ALL formats (whether DVD, BD or Amazon Instant) together. Im fairly certain that the Amazon Instant version does not include the bonuses.
The bonus features total more than an hour and add immensely to the core film. First come 12 deleted scenes which average about 3 minutes each and total 28 minutes in length. A few of these are musical performances, not in the final film (especially Merry Clayton). You can chose Play All but Ill suggest you use the Deleted Scenes index so you will know which singer you are watching.

Next comes an 8  minute featurette called The Buddy System where the singers talk about how they refer each other to gigs and recording sessions. Finally we are treated to 29-minute Q&A session hosted by the NY Times with Darlene Love, Lisa Fischer and Merry Clayton  plus the films director (Morgan Neville) which is just super. Neville speaks briefly at the beginning but, after that, its all about the girls as music journalist Jon Pareles asks the questions.

If you love pop and rock music from 1960 to today, youll love the film (and it is ESSENTIAL viewing for any Phil Spector Sound and Rolling Stones fans).Its also on Bluray as well but this review is based on the DVD. To my knowledge, there are no added ""features"" on the BD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5885149,3,B00E1LRCY6,"This is a hard review to write. In today's PC climate, I don't know how
to share my opinion on this dvd without sounding racist. What concerns me
is that there is a certain amount of reverse racism here. I will do the
best I can.

This is an interesting documentary. Some of the women are fabulous
singers. I LOVE the anti-auto-tune stance (Auto tune is a computer that
makes flat singers sound on pitch). I also love the anti-American Idol
comments. These singers are not Britney Spears pop garbage. These are very
talented women.

What bothers me is that this is marketed as a documentary on back up
singers. Stupid me took that to mean ALL backup singers.

This is actually a documentary on African American back up singers (95%
female) who sing pop in a gospel style. There's nothing wrong with that,
other than the lack of disclosure.

With 2 exceptions (& a 5 second long 3rd exception), all people not of color in
this documentary are male businessmen or rock stars.

We get tons of talking head time with Sting (& there is a brief
clip of David Byrne performing with gospel styled back up singers)

Exception #1: One of Sting's 3 backup singers is a white female. She
only sings once in 90 minutes; but she talks a lot.

#2: Sheryl Crow is given 5 seconds of on screen time to state she once
sang back up.

#3: There is 1 white male b.u. singer mostly used as a talking head. I
have no clue who he is, & he only sings for the interviewer.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the video. Lots of good info about
a largely ignored part of the profession. Oh...... & after 30+ years I finally
understood the words that Merry Clayton sings in Gimme Shelter!

But........... There also are talented back up singers both of color &
not of color who sing in styles other than gospel based. THE GOSPEL
STYLE FOCUS SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE TITLE OF THE DVD.

A few brief examples:

1. Stevie Nicks has had the same 2 b-u singers her entire career.
They're quite good, & I suspect they've never set foot in a baptist
church. (& they're not mentioned in this doc); nor are the countless
60's & 70's Folk-Rock back up singers.

2. They spend a lot of time on Bruce Springsteen, but where is Patti
Scialfa?

2. As far as those who ""made it"":

They spend a lot of time with Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs & Englishmen
tour. Claudia Linnear is a superb singer & is mentioned often in this
documentary. Rita Coolidge is also a superb singer who had a more
successful career then Clayton. She is not mentioned once.

And speaking of MD&E: imo it's the best example of this style of singing
ever recorded. It's barely mentioned. Reviewing this motivated me to rewatch
the film (mediocre) & play  the ""deluxe version"" of the CD (to die for).
And if there ever was an album that would have suffered without the amazing
back up singers (here they're called the choir); it's M,D & E.

And on the subject of b.u. singers who ""made it"", they spend a lot of time
on Luther Vandross, Darlene Love, & Lisa Fischer.

But what about non gospel backup singers who ""made it""; I kept waiting
for Paula Cole (never  once mentioned); other than Vandross, at one time Cole
was a bigger star than any of these people. And there's Ronnie Spector:
Why mention Love & not Spector?

If you can get past the gospel issue (which would not bother me if they
mentioned it in the title & official description) this is an interesting
watch.

musicians.",1391299200,11,3468,4.436908517350158

Sting is clear in describing the talent possessed by the singers, but explains that getting to stardom is something almost mystical, beyond the hard work and talent.

You don't get to sing backup vocals without  real talent. Consider Merry Clayton, always onstage with the Stones. Mick explains why in 20 Feet From Stardom.

How about Darlene Love? Darlene was the lead singer for the Blossom's whose single He's A  Rebel was released by Phil Spector under the Crystals name. Darlene sang behind Elvis, Cher, the Righteous Brothers,Luther Van Dross, Bruce Springsteen. Essentially a backup vocalist Darlene was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.

5885167,5,B00E1LRCY6,"I absolutely loved this movie.  You don't pay attention to the background singers in a hit song, but that's usually the part that you sing along to when you listen to that song.  The background singers are stars, they are beautiful, sexy, talented, and they really carry the song.  Without them the lead singer would sound flat and dull, no matter how good the song is.  The women featured in this film are really cheated of the fame and fortune they deserve, but that is the way the industry works.  Definitely a worthy and important film.  I will always appreciate the background singers in every hit song in a more profound way after seeing this movie.

5885180,4,B00E1LRCY6,"Have you ever put on an album by one of your favorite artists and found yourself reading through the linear notes trying to find out who was singing the chorus line you love so much?  Ive found myself doing that, wondering why there wasn't a feat. So-and-so following the track title.  Ive even Googled songs before, trying to find out what singer was lending their vocals to a particular track to no avail.  But, after watching 20 Feet From Stardom I understand.

The ones with the biggest voices have, until this point in time, have had no voice.

When looking through the roster of singers associated with this documentary, one may instantly gravitate towards names like Ray Charles, David Bowie, Sheryl Crow and Sting, but when you're finished watching this film, names like Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, Judith Hill and Darlene Love will mean more to you.  In fact, the minute the documentary was through I found myself downloaded How Can I Ease the Pain by Lisa Fischer, who has one of the most impressive voices Ive ever heard in my life.  Honestly, shes up there with Mariah and Whitney as one of the best voices ever to grace the world.  Listening to her sing and realizing that no one knows who she is because she disappeared from center stage so quickly is the sad reality of this industry.

And yet, watching this documentary lets you know that Lisa had a lot to do with that as well.

20 Feet From Stardom takes a look at the voices behind the artists we love.  These are the legendary talents within their inner circle that are not household names and are pretty much forgotten by anyone who isn't hiring them to make them sound better.  Sting certainly knows who these artists are.  Sting has had Lisa as his dominant backing vocalist for years.  She tours with him, records with him, has a great friendship with him.  He knows who she is.

Why don't we?

As a whole, 20 Feet From Stardom is an informative and engaging documentary.  That being said, it isn't without its flaws.  For me, the point of 20 Feet From Stardom takes a while to establish itself.  It was one of those films that about halfway through I thought to myself, what is this trying to tell me?  The constant shifting from one artist to another made the focus seem uneven to a degree and kept me from truly connecting as a whole with the film, and while I know that this is a documentary on a subject and not a singular biopic, I really would have loved to see some of these women fleshed out a little more.  Lisa is by far the most humble, and to me the most talented (and the documentary seems to think so as well) but Merry Claytons story was truly heartbreaking, and watching her shift from this seemingly self-absorbed tortured artist to a real human being was a highlight of the film, and something I really wish had been worked with more.

I would blame the editing for some of my issues here.  I found the snippets of interviews used to be uneven.  Like I said, for a large portion of the film, Merry Clayton comes across like a conceited and self-absorbed woman.  Shes not appealing at all.  But as the film progresses and we get to her full story (and failed success) you can see a real woman emerge in the tearful nostalgia of it all.

I also found the entire Waters Family to be the most obnoxious and annoying individuals Ive seen in film this year.

Still, the impact of the film cannot be faked.  You begin to feel for these voices, and it raises awareness for the hardworking people in show business who don't get the recognition they deserve.  Watching them talk about how they were worked out of record deals and taken advantage of for the greater good (Im looking at you Phil Spector) was upsetting.  That being said, Im still left wondering what this documentary was supposed to tell me.  When you have someone like Lisa Fischer actively working against being famous, I wonder why this documentary seems so focused on telling me that she should be.

But if Judith Hill gets a record deal out of this whole experience, then it was worth it.",1390867200,,4042,4.506868131868132

A lot can be learned from their experiences and I purchased the dvd for that very reason.  It's mandatory viewing for anyone who is serious about their craft as a vocalist in front of or behind the crowd.  Add my fave male background vocalist, David Lasley, and you have someone who is extremely happy.

And I have known of these unsung heroines for as long, having seen their names on the backs of dozens of albums.  You get to know them on a whole new level in this film and what they sacrificed their whole lives for.  Were I wealthy enough, I would give this DVD to every single person I know.",1390608000,,470,4.188888888888889
5885207,2,B00E1LRCY6,"I have long been interested in back-up singers and musicians whose names we never learn. When I first heard, ""Gimme Shelter"" as a teenager, I decided right then - and still believe - that it's the most devastating rock song ever written. I had to know the name of the woman who delivered one of the most blistering vocal solos ever recorded. I've known it was Merry Clayton for years, and even argued with people when they suggested otherwise. Therefore, it was with real anticipation that I sat down to watch this documentary.

I enjoyed many parts of it, even though I found Darlene Love to be somewhat ego-maniacal. I was dismayed that there was no discussion about performance royalties. Why did Darlene Love have to resort to cleaning houses? How much money did these women earn? A discussion of this would have added much-needed depth to the film.

But here is what bothered me: On many of the clips, black female backup singers were standing alongside white female backup singers. Early in the documentary, there is a clip of a 1950's cheesy singer with his requisite white gal-singers around him. Cut to present-tense, and the singers being interviewed (all black) were gleeful in their dismissal of these singers; they were white and therefore boring and lacking in passion. Fair enough. But what about Joe Cocker's back up singers? The only white female singer featured is Sheryl Crowe who - despite being enormously talented - isn't exactly a powerhouse in the pantheon of great singers.

Near the end, we see several of the women portrayed singing with a white female with short blonde hair. That she isn't even mentioned, or spoken to, bothered me. Did no one think to say, ""Wait a minute...we're ignoring this person who is right here in this room, standing in front of the microphone with us?"" Why? Because she's white? I would be the first to agree that black singers are, for the most part, superior vocalists. But as a person watching this documentary, I found the decision to keep the white female singers nameless - and therefore obscure, which is what this film is supposedly attempting to rectify - deeply hypocritical. Imagine the reverse scenario: the only singer being utterly ignored is black. The subsequent outrage would be justified; why is there none in this instance? Where's the sisterhood? I felt sorry for this young woman and it kind of ruined the whole documentary for me.",1390608000,5,2408,4.839805825242719
5885208,3,B00E1LRCY6,"I love music. I love music documentaries. I have several that I've watched numerous times each. I love hearing about great musician's or singer's lives while I listen to their music, as told by both the artists and the people around them. But I also have two or three documentaries that I haven't watched but once or twice. '20 Feet from Stardom' is going into that collection, I'm afraid.

This one had some great moments in it, but most of them were talked over. I watch a musical documentary for the music. And one hundred five second snippets because all the music is being continually talked over is extremely frustrating, especially for someone who pretty much detests hearing a five second snippet of a great tune.

As for how great the artists are or were, and what an impact they've made, I'd rather hear someone else talk about that than have the artists themselves do it. But either way, only do it sparingly and then show me instead of talking about it, with the music.

I do think that the importance of back-up singers to rock and roll may have been overstated. And I'm not sure that the ones who made records that didn't sell did a very good job of stating their case that it was anything other than them not having what it took that caused that.

It should have been a crime, what happened to Ms. Love. But, if you watch 'Crazy', it doesn't seem that those things only happened to black women singers. There seemed to be some very sorry people who were allowed to get away with some very sorry things in the music business, at least in the past.",1390521600,3,1561,4.466666666666667

I am a HUGE Darlene Love fan, who never misses her yearly appearance on David Letterman's show, when she does a rousing rendition of Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).  Every year she changes it up and I love watching for how her Sax man is going to enter.  (Minus 2007, during the writer's strike -- I still watched her 2006 appearance again!)  It's my favorite part of Christmas!

My only complaint -- I wish they would have brought together as many singers that they could and had let them loose with a Gab Fest.  That would haven been interesting.  Though Love stated that they had to fit it into 90 minutes -- they should have made it longer.

5885251,5,B00E1LRCY6,"The 20 FEET FROM STARDOM BLU-RAY is a fascinating look at the unsung heroes -- the unknown backup singers -- who really push good songs into the stratosphere and make them iconic. It's amazing that most people will know these popular songs, will know the chorus and can identify the background singers' sound, but not be able to name them.

This documentary has two parallel story tracks, maybe three, aside from just getting the backup singers' individual stories and that helps focus the movie so it isn't just a bunch of talking heads. The documentary takes us into the fascinating story of Darlene Love, who was THE voice of the whole Phil Spector ""Wall Of Sound"" and how her voice was used in many number one hits, as lead singer, yet credit was given to other singers/groups (The Crystals). Once you hear Love's singing you'll know instantly that voice (if you're a fan of 60s girl group songs) and she represents one dynamic to the story.

Contrasting that we are introduced to Judith Hill, who rose to fame being selected to take part in Michael Jackson's comeback tour before his untimely death a few years back, and she's young and starting her career. She's a triple threat being uniquely beautiful, an enormously talented singer, and she writes and plays music. Hill is desperately trying to avoid the pitfall of getting stuck and comfortable in the background and trying to achieve her dreams of solo stardom.

And that brings us to the next dynamic in the story and that is Lisa Fischer. She was the incredibly GIFTED (and still is) singer who was Luther Vandross's protege. He took her on tour and gave her wings to fly. She released her solo album in 1990, SO INTENSE, which featured the number one hit single ""How Can I Ease The Pain,"" that she co-wrote, and won the Grammy (tied with the incomparable Patti Labelle -- no less), and was a monster success. But Fischer turned her back on all of that, instead choosing to remain a backup singer for which she was more comfortable, and one in high demand, traveling for the last 25 years with the Rolling Stones, as well as with Sting and others. I always wondered what happen to her and it's good to know she's still thriving. She represents the middle ground between Love and Hill, and she enjoys being able to continue sharing her gift, while at the same time still being able to be anonymous. Of course that's not good news for us fans! I've been waiting for the next Lisa Fischer CD to drop for more than a decade ever since I fell in love with that voice on her first album.

Of course there are many other background singers featured in 20 FEET FROM STARDOM, I just chose those three to give you a sense of the story line, but other incredible singers featured are Tata Vega, Merry Clayton, Claudia Lennear, the Waters (Julia, Oren, Maxine - I wonder if these were the same ""Waters"" that were the Andantes at Motown?), Susaye Green, Edna Wright, David Lasley, Jo Lawry, Gloria Jones, among many others. And there's also a reunion of Darlene Love with her The Blossoms group mates Fanita James and Jean King. Many of these singers have released solo albums but, with the exception of Fischer, none ever reached critical acclaim or success that they deserved, not counting underground/cult followings. Hopefully this film will rectify that.

Anyway, there's plenty of music and singing in the film and includes many archival footage of these singers in action. Also, though the film focuses mainly on female background singers there are male background vocalists too like David Lasley, Luther Vandross, Oren Waters and others which are featured throughout.

Plus there are plenty of celebrities on hand as well like Sting, Bruce Springsteen, Bette Midler, Mick Jagger, and Stevie Wonder who express their deep gratitude to these unsung heroes and why they've been so important.

Featurette that explains the ""buddy system"" and how background singers will refer each other to sessions that they hear about and how the music industry is changing where it's becoming more difficult to find work, since most soloists are doing their own backgrounds or hiring family members to do them.

*New York Times Talk* -- 29:24-minutes
Live Q&A with Darlene Love, Lisa Fischer, Merry Clayton, and the director Morgan Neville on how the project got off the ground. Singer and prolific songwriter Valerie Simpson is in the audience.

These are just some of the many stories out there about the highs and lows of being in the ""background,"" and it's both entertaining and heart-breaking at the same time. You do come to realize that many more factors come into play other than talent and ambition, or even fairness, when one is fortunate enough to realize their dream of being a star and here is the proof.

Likewise, not every seminal background singer is featured here like Venetta Fields who was part of the Ikettes (in one iteration) and went on to become a very much in demand background singer for many superstars (Streisand, Ross, Quincy Jones, Joe Cocker, Rolling Stones to name a few) in the 70s.

Another interesting story would've been Martha Wash, although she is featured in the bonus section in a short clip. Wash was another great singer who, along with Izora Rhodes-Armstead, started out as background singers for Sylvester and the two would become the Weather Girls. Wash would eventually go solo and then, like Darlene Love before her, sing lead on many huge hits in the 90s, particularly for groups like C.C. Music Factory and Black Box, but get no credit for it. Her story would've showed that stuff like this was still happening even in the current day.

I also would've like to learn or hear more from those who started in the background but gained at least some success like Deniece Williams who was one of Stevie Wonder's background singers in a group called ""Wonderlove"" before she would achieve some acclaim with her solo records, hitting big in the 80s with ""Let's Hear For The Boy"" from the movie Footloose. And superstar Mariah Carey also got her start singing backup for Brenda K. Starr, so it would've been interesting on they were able to maneuver from the back to the front, but maybe those interviews would've detracted from the main story.

Anyway, 20 FEET FROM STARDOM  is definitely a must see.",1389916800,4,6517,4.793226381461675

Theses artist are extremely talented and in a lot of cases make a song memorable just by lending their voices. Darlene Love a major featured artist has such a touching story of what Phil Spector did to her early in her career that her strength of character allowed her to survive and achieve Rock and roll Hall of fame induction.

My feeling is that there should be more of a policy of inducting  Background singers into the Rock Hall. If you love music and singers buy this. You will not regret it. The music is great. I bought the Blu-Ray. I would recommend that. Give yourself a treat and get this documentary.

5885265,5,B00E1LRCY6,"HD cameras and web streaming services have given documentary filmmakers the ability to highlight people and topics that might not otherwise get any attention. It's great the singers profiled in 20 Feet from Stardom are finally able take center stage. It's just too bad it took this long. The Blu-ray cover might boast the participation of Springsteen, Sting, Mick Jagger, Stevie Wonder, and Bette Midler, the real stars of this film are the dozens of backing singers interviewed. Although plenty of singers get screentime, director Neville spends the most time on the core group of Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, and Claudia Lennearall of whom reached the highest heights of popular music without getting the recognition they deserved.

Background singing is the art of blending with others. For many of the singers profiled in 20 Feet from Stardom, that unique talent was learned in church gospel groups. In the '50s, rock music used the sounds of gospel to sell songs about sin, and everyone wanted background performers who could sing with soul. The music industry shifted away from all-white backing vocalists to African American singers like Fanita James, Gloria Jones, and Darlene Lovewho, as The Blossoms, were among the first black background singers. It wasn't long before they were being used on songs as diverse as ""Monster Mash,"" ""That's Life,"" ""Da Doo Ron Ron,"" and ""He's a Rebel""the latter of which was credited by producer Phil Spector to another girl group, The Crystals. Spector subjected the under-contract Love to more ghost sessions over the years, hiding her prolific output from the public.

Merry Clayton spent her early career as a ""Raelette"" backing singer for Ray Charles. Later, she would sing with Joe Cocker and give one of rock's most famous supporting performances as the female voice in the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter."" Clayton describing that session is one of the highlights of the film, both for the powerful isolated audio track and the story she tells about being calling up to sing in the middle of the night, belting out chilling lines about ""rape and murder"" in pajamas and curlers. Claudia Lennear also began as an ""ette""as one of Ike and Tina Turner's background singer-dancers, before performing with artists including George Harrison and the Rolling Stones. Mick Jagger talks in the film about his personal and professional relationship with Lennear, who is rumored to be the inspiration for ""Brown Sugar.""

Lisa Fischer also sang with the Stonesjoining them on several tours to sing Clayton's part in ""Gimme Shelter""and even winning a Grammy-winning for her 1992 album. Although Fischer's solo success is unique among her peers, Fischer isn't the only background artist to record her own album. Lennear, Clayton, and Love all released solo albums, none of which made these veterans household names. It wasn't a matter of talent. These women are every bit as good, if not better, as artists who made it big. Neville makes the case for these amazing performers, not by telling us how great they are but by putting them behind microphones and letting them sing. As fascinating as this oral history of background singers is, the best thing about 20 Feet from Stardom are the performances shot for this film. These women may be decades past their biggest successes, but they are just as stunning now.

20 Feet from Stardom is about a group of artists who never got their due, but it's not a downer. There are pangs of regret here and there, but for the most part the documentary is a celebration. Neville points out how many songs feature singers we never knew before. Now we've met them, and it allows for a new appreciation of old classics. Clayton describing her performance on ""Sweet Home Alabama"" as a blow for Civil Rights means I'll never listen to that song the same way again. Heck, even the Growing Pains theme song seems more important now that I've met The Waters family.

20 Feet from Stardom has a lot to say about the importance of passion in making art. Background singers sing not for attention but because they love to sing. Not only that, but they practice an art form that is about making sure they don't stand out. That anonymity would be hard for most musicians. As we see in the film, it's not always easy for those who have committed their lives to it. I'm sure all these women and men are grateful to Neville for telling their stories, but even so it's clear they see themselves as a community and not competitors. They live, figuratively and literally, in harmony with each othera rare thing among artists and one more reason to be inspired by this film.

20 Feet from Stardom hits Blu-ray courtesy of Anchor Bay, with a gorgeous 1.78:1/1080p picture. The modern HD interviews are clean and sharp, the archival footage less so, with dramatically lit, stylish in-studio performances. Those performances are visual highlights as well as showcases for the film's 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audioa surprisingly robust mix for a film with so many talking heads. 20 Feet is one of the rare documentaries that benefits from a hi-def release.

20 Feet from Stardom includes the following bonus features:

 ""Deleted Scenes"" (29:00): These 12 extra scenes feature some of the 50 singers who were interviewed by Neville but didn't make it into the film.

 ""Buddy System"" (8:52): Unlike the cutthroat world of solo performance, backing singers help each other get work. In this featurette, interviewees talk about their professional friendships and the inherent togetherness of singing with others.

 ""Times Talks: Q&A with Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer, and director Morgan Neville"" (29:24): This engaging New York Times Q&A gives 20 Feet's stars a chance to expand on the stories from the film.

5885272,5,B00E1LRCY6,"20 FEET FROM STARDOM is an engrossing documentary feature that looks at the lives of backup singers; the ladies who stand behind headliners like Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Bette Midler, Mick Jagger and Sting, harmonizing to make them sound even better than they would be alone.  These singers are the voices behind some of the greatest rock, pop and R&B hits of all time, and yet the public does not know their names.

Director Morgan Neville endeavors to change that status by shining the spotlight on such legendary backup singers as Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fisher, Claudia Lennear and Judith Hill, several of whom have tried with little success to break out from the chorus and perform on their own.  Theirs is a story of triumph, heartbreak and betrayal.  Some of these talented ladies resigned themselves to remaining backup singers, while others left the shrinking profession altogether.

20 FEET FROM STARDOM not only features interviews from the ladies themselves, as well as the stars and record producers (e.g. Lou Adler) with whom they worked, but there is also vintage footage of Michael Jackson, Ray Charles, Ike & Tina Turner and Luther Vandross.

The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes several deleted scenes, Q&A sessions with Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and director Neville, and a featurette, The Buddy System.

5885273,4,B00E1LRCY6,"What would it be like to sing as a back-up singer? How would you feel singing when youve got talent to be in the spotlight? Morgan Nevilles documentary 20 Feet from Stardom may not tell you the whole story, but it will give you a fairly clear idea of being a back-up singer, with interesting and sometimes poignant accounts of the artists whose talent should deserve more recognition.

The 90-minute documentary largely consists of concert footage and interviews with artists including back-up singers and musicians with whom they collaborated. As for the back-up singers, 20 Feet from Stardom mainly covers the following six artists who agreed to talk before the camera:

Merry Clayton, a former Raelettes member who recounts the night when she sang the Rape, murder part of Rolling Stones Gimme Shelter; Darlene Love, dynamic singer who actually did the lead of Crystals hit Hes a Rebel (and better known for her annual performance of Christmas, Baby Please Come Home on TV); Lisa Fischer, Grammy-winning vocalist frequently seen singing in the Rolling Stones concerts; Judith Hill, talented singer who sang ""Heal the World at Michael Jackson's memorial service; Claudia Lennear, who reportedly became inspiration for Mick Jagger and David Bowie in the early 70s; and Tta Vega, extremely gifted singer who has received a reputation as a back-up singer (and singer of the soundtrack of The Color Purple including mesmerizing Miss Celie's Blues), but somehow success as a solo artist (Motown) eluded in the disco era.

The film also features interviews with Mick Jagger, Gloria Jones, Bette Midler, Bruce Springsteen, Sting and Stevie Wonder, to name a few.

Some may complain, understandably, that 20 Feet from Stardom lacks a historical perspective, moving back and forth chronologically too much. You may notice some major names are missing (where is Cissy Houston?). Also, the film refuses to touch some aspects of being a back-up singer, including business-related matters like the money these singers actually received for their job. How much would you get paid for back-up singing for, say, Elvis Presley?

The film gives focus on the act of singing, or what it takes to be a star or back-up singer. And as such, the film works, an insightful and moving tribute to their talent and passion for music.",1388448000,2,2307,5.092592592592593

A lot of history and music came together for me watching them recount their stories and the cameos of some stars/groups they performed with made it all the more complex.

It was fun to see Darlene Love along with her group The Blossoms,  have a reunion after 40 years. I particularly enjoyed hearing them do backing on That's Life the Frank Sinatra hit.

5885284,3,B00E1LRCY6,"One of my early on fantasies was to either sass my way through ""Hit the Road Jack"" as a Raelette, backing up the great Ray Charles. Or grove with the ultimate R&B legend, Luther Vandross, who left us way too soon. Or believe it or not, really wanted to harmonize with Reba McEntire, you'd be amazed at how many of her songs from the 90's I know by heart.  The on the road lifestyle would have suited me well too; there's nothing tying me to being a homebody, a new city every other night, 4 star hotels, the camaraderie of the other musicians and roadies, staying up till 2am, getting up at noon - all of it would have fit right into my idea of living the life!

And I would have pursued this dream too, if it weren't for one thing -  I can't sing.  I mean, I can carry a tune, but believe me, there's nobody asking me to belt out a number.  I know other people who also think being a backup singer for famous singers and musicians would be a dream come true - so it's odd that Twenty Feet From Stardom, a documentary by Morgan Neville, decided to show the disappointments and dissatisfaction that comes from being in the background rather than center stage.

The idea for this doc came from former president of A&M records Gil Friesen, who suggested it to Morgan Neville for his next project. Neville said when he began researching the world of backup singers he found very little information, movies, articles etc on the subject and wound up interviewing over 50 different singers of varying ages, race and musical backgrounds. And I think in light of this, the subject deserves a second pass with this wider spectrum in mind.  Don't get me wrong...READ MORE [...]",1380844800,,1666,4.442622950819672

They have talent and they were in positions where they got to do something they love. That's ""making it"" in my book. Not all of them were bitter (I especially liked the interviews with The Waters) but it didn't seem like a story worth telling in this format. Might have been better as a film.
