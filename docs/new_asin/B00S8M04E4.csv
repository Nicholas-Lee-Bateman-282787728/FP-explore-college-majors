Im no film student/critic/expert; Im just a person whos watched enough shows and films from a handful of non-USA countries to feel confident making such a statement.

As noted in my review heading, I liked the story and made it about 75% of the way through - but then Pomme (the now forest-dwelling wife) made her first attempt at hunting. This one was acceptable for my somewhat delicate sensibilities.
The second one was a different story entirely. I watched longer than I should have, and I can still see it playing out in my mind even though its been at least a week since I stopped the film. No matter how the destination, the hunting journey was too much for me. The animals in question certainly looked real, and that was all I could handle.",1517443200,,910,4.548780487804878

8697667,4,B00S8M04E4,"Today's Film on Friday entry is If You Don't, I Will from French director Sophie Fillires. As with all of Film Movement's films, it was an official selection at many festivals.

Pomme (Emmanuelle Devos) and Pierre (Mathieu Amalric) have been married for many years. That initial flush and fire of new love has slowly faded away. On a hike, Pomme asks "" What have we become?"" Pierre's reply? "" Your parents.""

Fillires takes us into this couple's life - and although it seems like they both still want to 'fix' things, it is quite obvious that this is more on Pomme's part than on Pierre's. Until one last hike, where Pomme decides she is going to stay in the forest - without Pierre. ""I'll totally lose weight - among other things.""

Fillires uses visual metaphors to great effect - the too heavy backpack is a great example. Pierre is initially carrying it - and complaining. When Pomme takes over and takes off, she begins emptying the contents, mirroring the self exploration of her life and marriage while in the forest. Pierre attempts to do the same back in civilization.

Silence and still shots are used effectively to underscore the contemplation, the loneliness, the hurt and the separation. The forest setting is absolutely beautiful.

Both actors use expressions and body language to great effect - Devos's are more subtle - she says much with a simple smile and a knowing eye. Amalric's are more overt - and more hurtful. I was firmly in Pomme's corner for the entire film. But at the end of the film, I rethought my stance - it does take two. I'm not going to reveal what does happen -  but I thought the ending was perfect. The last set of dialogue between the two is quite telling - and full of truth. The chemistry between these two actors was absolutely perfect and easy to believe.

If You Don't, I Will is another great addition to the Film Movement collection - and mine.

As always, there is a short bonus film included. A 17 yr old girl finds out she's pregnant minutes before she has to take her driving test - with her grandmother in tow. A good pairing - this is another look at love.",1434067200,,2110,4.5488126649076515
8697668,5,B00S8M04E4,"This little French film form Film Movement was originally called ""Arrte ou je continue"" (Stop or I'll continue): now it is IF YOU WON'T' I WILL.' It seems many viewers are missing the point of this very delicately composed eulogy on marriage. Written and directed by Sophie Filli&egrave;res this is one of the more sensitive examinations of prolonged relationships or marriages whose glow has dimmed and needs to alter. Others have shown the bitter finality of divorce, the distancing that can end in mental and even physical abuse - exit paths for marriage. But this little exquisite film has the ability to observe the increasingly flattening of response to a couple as they find the spark of sensuality has faded along with the maturing of children and allowing their lives to supersede that of the couple's togetherness.

Pomme (Emmanuelle Devos) and Pierre (Mathieu Amalric) have been together a long time. Passion and spontaneity have given way to predictability and cold shoulders. On a hike together one afternoon, Pomme declares her independence by deciding to stay in the woods rather than return to an underwhelming life with Pierre. Pierre tries to get back to normal, despite his worry over her whereabouts and the indelible sense that he's missing his better half. Meanwhile, Pomme begins an extended meditation in the forest on where her own life should go next, with or without Pierre. In the end, both are left to contemplate the strength and meaning of each other's commitment.

If viewers find the film dissociative and lacking focus in the beginning - many feel they just don't understand what the film is doing at first - then that is likely the point Sophie Filli&egrave;res is making: those little moments of chipping away at the bond of marriage that if unheeded result in fractures and dissolution are subtle. But with the assistance of both Devos and Amalric as the couple the film makes its poignant point extraordinarily well. Grady Harp, April 15",1430006400,3,1975,5.0
8697669,4,B00S8M04E4,"Mathieu Almaric plays Pierre who is in a stale relationship with Emmanuelle Devos (Pomme) - they have what `Tindersticks' called `a lazy love'.  They try to inject some life back into the relic of the relationship by sharing experiences and relying on the confirmation of friends.

They also do rather a lot of hiking in the woods - communing with nature and having picnics - with wine. Now not a lot happens here but that is the point. It is the meaninglessness of a failing relationship that is being exposed and being seen for how pathetic it really is. The interactions are always filed with spikiness - the sort where all are either preludes or post mortems to a row. The humour is the sort that is an acquired taste. That is you have to have a wry Gallic smirk at the ridiculousness of it all.

All the acting is fine and there are some exquisite moments here, but it is `lyrically paced' and an understanding of France and the French will not be a handicap here. One for Francophiles and those who like a bit of surreality served up with the decree nisi.",1428451200,,1061,4.458762886597938
8697670,4,B00S8M04E4,"""If You Don't, I Will"" (2014 release from France; 102 min.; original title ""Arrte ou je continue"", ""Stop or I'll Continue"") brings the story of a couple, Pierre (played by Mathieu Amalric) and Pomme (played by Emmanuelle Devos). As the movie opens, we see the couple at the opening of an exhibition and it's not long before they are arguing, and arguing some more, over the littlest and pettiest things. Along the way we also get to know Pomme's college-going son (from an earlier marriage), as well as Mellie, Pierre's female friend who might have a strong interest in him. We also find out that Pomme is recovering from a benign brain tumor. Amidst all that bickering and arguing, life goes on, one weekend Pierre and Pomme go on a hike in the Chamoiselle forest (near Lyon). Imagine Pierre's shock when at the end of the hike, Pomme announces she is staying behind in the forest. How long will Pomme stay in the forest? Is this the end of the marriage? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest film from French writer-director Sophie Fillires, and this time she tackles a hapless topic: how do couples manage in a loveless and bored marriage? She captures the mood perfectly on a number of occasions when Pierre and Pomme don't know how to carry on the conversation (if they are not arguing) and an awkward silence takes over. When Pomme decides to remain in the forest, there is a completely different type of silence, a liberating silence that is augmented by chirping birds and other animal sounds. I couldn't help but think back to a play from the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre over 50 years ago when Sartre observed ""L'enfer, c'est les autres"" (""hell is the others""). This is not always an easy movie to watch, as the problems between Pierre and Pomme are profound and not easily fixable (if at all). Both lead stars give brilliant performances, but a special kudos for Emmanuelle Devos (you may remember her from ""Coco Before Chanel"").

This is the March, 2015 release of the Film Movement DVD-of-the-Month Club. As always, the DVD comes with a bonus shortie, and this time we get ""Driving Lessons"" (2014 release from Belgium; 14 min.) where a 17 yr. old girl is required to take her grandmother along to her driving lessons... Just watch! Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a tough marriage drama, this movie is just for you. ""If you Don't, I Will"" is a welcome addition to the ever-growing Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies.",1426636800,4,2572,4.688053097345133
