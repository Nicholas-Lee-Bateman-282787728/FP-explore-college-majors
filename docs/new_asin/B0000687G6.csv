7963966,3,B0000687G6,"This was a very artsy film that started with a half seen accident and deaths and then fast forwards two decades.

We find a woman who is very icy in her interactions with her lover and colleagues.

A mysterious man (played by the ever versatile Julian Sands) starts intersecting with our protagonist.

There are many odd angles, stunning monochrome takes, and close-ups of eyes, ears, etc.

** beware spoilers follow **

It turns out that Julian Sands is playing the husband that lost his wife and daughter.  He is looking for closure in a positive way, and he needs to be able to talk with a woman who remembers what happened to reach that closure.

This is an interesting film for the semi-professional video crowd or serious film fan.",1469923200,,737,4.666666666666667
7963967,1,B0000687G6,"ONE QUESTIONS. IS IT POSSIBLE TO GIVE -5 STARS so the overall review would more accurately reflect the true content of the movie.?
  Having read all 3 reviews, Mr John D. Hernandez deserves a metal, since after reading his review it is apparent he managed to watch the whole movie.  He also reported accurately on what happened, or what little happened. Definitely NOT an action film.  This low budget film was one of those DARK MOVIES, with needless CLOSE-UPS and really BAD SOUND QUALITY.  I actually fell asleep 3 times and had to rewind because I kept hoping for some point to the story.  Having made it to the ending, I am still not sure. The other two reviews were worded exactly the same, only the second one had lots of spelling or typo errors. Also, these last two review were either written by the same person, using differnt logins, or they invested in this movie and wanted their money back. I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A BAD REVIEW LIKE THIS BEFORE, SORRY, but this movie was that bad.",1241827200,,991,4.53932584269663
