8535770,5,B0094AH3BQ,"Very nice set and costumes by Mauro Carosi. The procuction is well staged in the relatively small scene at Parma by Joseph Franconi Lee. Here's a performance that really works. Everything seems just right, but if you MUST have the top soloists (Pavarotti, Domingo...), look elsewhere. However, I think that the ones here (Susanna Branchini (Aida), Mariana Pentcheva (Amneris), Walter Fraccaro (Radames), Alberto Gazale (Amonasro), Carlo Malinverno (Il Re di Egitto) do a fantastic job. Also pluses for the ballet and the video production.",1469923200,,538,5.416666666666667

8535772,4,B0094AH3BQ,"Here we go again: the preceding single review simply demolishes this performance, everything is bad, nothing is good. Even the gods hate it because there was an earthquake during the first performance. Plus a 10/10 rousing cheer from what is now more a like a fan club, but none of this estimable crowd has actually seen this production.  However, if you read the review carefully, you'll find it full of empty gestures, generalities and irrelevant points. `Blue Aida' indeed.  More like a blue reviewer.(and by the way, Noam spelt backwards is MOAN which is what his spiel is all about.)

Well, we all know that Aida has been recorded umpteen times, probably the most recorded, video-ed opera ever. After all it never left the stage for some 140 years. And it's a spectacular work as it was definitely intended ever since its premiere in Cairo. Nowadays with our search for `relevance and meaning' we were blessed with avant -garde productions like the one in Toronto where Aida became a washer-woman complete with dirty overalls and distressed shoes, scrubbing the floor  in some executive board room of a big corporation.

This director quite rightly intended to bring us back to the splendour with a monumental set reminding me of the Karnak temple with beautiful backlighting that create interesting silhouettes. Colours are resplendent and ever changing according to the atmosphere of each act. Without going into details the effect is a knockout, a delight to the eye. I doubt any viewer will start differentiating as to the museum-precise  origins of the clothes or symbols etc. like Mr. No. 1 Reviewer finds time for, unless you deliberately look for faults.

For the young conductor, Antonino Fogliani who is dismissed summarily, can I perhaps point out that he conducted the whole opera without a score? Not many conductors are capable to do that; last time I looked it was Toscanini who did it because he wouldn't wear glasses. He was a bit vain, bless his soul.  Karajan could do it too, but he was Karajan.

The singers are not even worthy of mention by Mr. No. 1 Reviewer. Instead there is some gibberish about major and minor scales and challenging the reader to pick out quarter tones. Dare I mention them? Susanna Branchini  is a fresh, new, very appealing  young star-soprano in the best Verdi tradition and what a delightful change from those aged super-heavy warhorses featured in past shows. Walter Fraccaro a very able Radames, a strong heldentenor. Mariana Pencheva (Amneris), a well-established lead mezzo world-wide, a many shaded characterization and real knockout in the 4th act. Of the lesser roles I only found Andguladze's Ramphis the weakest. Alberto Gazale's Amonasro was wonderful.

I am no expert on body-microphones etc. but I found the sound wavering in the first 2 acts, but it improved later. Yes, this may be a weakness, so I deduct 1 point,but otherwise this latest Aida is a fine accomplishment.",1377561600,12,2937,4.959266802443992
8535773,1,B0094AH3BQ,"This is the worst release in the Tutto Verdi series, even though it gets a little better in the last two acts. It was compiled from two performances on February 2012. I didn't give it only one star because of a hissy fit, but because there is nothing in it worth another star.

It is a challenging task to review the singing honestly without coming across as mean-spirited and/or boring, so I'll pass. Body mikes were used and everything in the orchestra pit is spot miked, so there is no sense of a coherent, continuous space and you don't get a feeling of the hall ambiance or of ""being there"". The sets are traditional but the costumes are a confusion of style from anywhere but ancient Egypt (Nepal? Mongolia? I think I even detected Aztecs). There are miles of colorful fabric on stage, not counting footwear, headgear and endless various accessories. The prevailing color is blue - this was nicknamed ""Blue Aida"" when it first appeared in the Verdi Festival in 2005. The direction is static - the singers engage in solemn, stereotypical postures (or are just on their own, there is little acting). There is absolutely no dramatic tension or development; it's all flat and lifeless. The conductor is useless. Even the gods expressed their disapproval by causing an earthquake the day of the prima - it lasted about 30-40 seconds, a magnitude of 4.9, strong shaking.

This release may have one practical use: to be used as a tool to diagnose tone deafness. One of the leads has the worst intonation I've ever heard (among other serious problems). He/she is sometimes flat by more than a quartertone, a few times by almost half a tone! That means he/she sometimes hits closer to the next note down instead of to the right one, and this is easy to spot because it happens in loud, exposed singing. All twenty-four major and minor scales have half tone intervals, so if you are unable to spot this singer you may be tone deaf.",1370217600,22,1927,4.648093841642229
