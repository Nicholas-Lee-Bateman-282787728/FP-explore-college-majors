8269777,5,B0018GFNP2,This should be reviewed by red letter media... Should be on top of everyone's have-to-get list of bad movies. I laughed. Actors suck. Scenes suck. Music sucks. Screenplay sucks. Movie quality suck. All I was looking for in a bad movie was found... One thing though: not too sure if this movie respects any animal rights.,1380672000,2,320,4.732142857142857
8269778,5,B0018GFNP2,"Shot on video, arguably the most collectable film in my bad films collection.  Which means this is the worst movie I have ever owned.  I love every second of it--from the ""shot on video"" feel to the overdramatic synth music throughout the film.  Every actor/actress in the film is likeable.  If you collect bad films, this is a must-own.  LOVE IT.",1314835200,3,347,4.622950819672131
