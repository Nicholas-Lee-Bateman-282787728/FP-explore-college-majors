4896760,2,B005V5HIMC,"Ok...much too long. Melodramtic, it was too much. The best part was the music. The actress that portrayed the mother (in the wheelchair) can sing. Not much more to say.",1421366400,2,168,4.633333333333334
4896761,2,B005V5HIMC,"This DVD was on sale for 499.00. Idk if it was a typo on the listing or what but when it went down to 15$, I purchased it and thought it was going to blow me away. I took it to the Salon and my clients ask me to put another DVD in....",1382054400,,234,3.4339622641509435

4896765,5,B005V5HIMC,I thought this play was funny but also kept me on the edge of my seat.... I never would have guessed the end... And so many things twisted and turned and it was fun.... I almost hated the Mayor myself... The ending scene really pulled at my heartstrings.  The actress really played that moment and I loved that we saw her change as a character... Keep them coming Vanessa Lynn productions!,1327017600,,389,4.47887323943662
4896766,5,B005V5HIMC,"This play takes you by surprise, from beginning to end.  It will have you on the edge of your seat anticipating the next twist and turn, of which there are many.  I have never seen a stage play with such originality.  This writer dares to push the envelope in combining two totally separate genres, gospel and murder mystery.  She is so skillful at blending the two that by the end the audience is left speechless and in awe by the emotion roller coaster ride they experienced.  A definite must see.  It felt like I was watching a movie on stage.",1324598400,5,546,4.41
4896767,5,B005V5HIMC,"I have been a fan of stage play DVD's for a while, but I have never seen anything like this ever. This is more like a movie, they kept me guessing to the very end with the murderer and I was almost in tears when the play was over, this is excellent 2 thumbs way up for creativity!",1322438400,2,280,3.8448275862068964

4896780,2,B005V5HIMC,"Sorry, I couldn't finish it. I only got into it for about 30 minutes then I turned it off. I don't like the live-theater type movies.",1437523200,,133,4.153846153846154
4896781,1,B005V5HIMC,"The scenes were Melo,drama to heavy.",1437436800,,36,5.166666666666667
4896782,2,B005V5HIMC,Plays on film don't work you to have put more money into it to make it a full cinematic production. Content was good; The presentation is good for the stage but not for the big screen.,1429574400,,184,4.138888888888889

4896787,4,B005V5HIMC,I still have to finish looking at it but so far it's ok,1424390400,,55,3.3076923076923075
8487298,2,B005V5HIMC,This movie was just as bad at the end as it was in it's beginning. I suffered myself through the duration of it because of my policy to support black film. I have also devoted myself watching a movie in it's entirety in order to fairly cast judgement. This was a very bad film. I gave it two stars only because I've already given one star to movies that are even worse. Otherwise I would have given it no stars!!!,1482105600,,413,4.175
8487299,5,B005V5HIMC,This was actually a good movie.,1470787200,,31,4.333333333333333
8487300,3,B005V5HIMC,"This is presented as a play. Matter fact, a copy of a play. Looks like a ""bootlegged"" copy. I haven't finished watching. Will rate later.",1465516800,,137,4.52

8487302,4,B005V5HIMC,"If  you  like  Tyler  Perry plays, then you'll  like this stage play ,.....it's  like Gospel with a twist of mystery and  ""whodunit""...while it  does start out unbearably slow like most movies  or plays began to interesting in the  middle, and  yes the low  budget  actors almost  spoiled  the  entire  show but  it  was  still  worth  it  and quite  interesting  in the end....i think  the Director  has a lot  of  potential . ...watch  it all the  way  thru , you'll  enjoy  it  :)",1463270400,,483,4.475609756097561

8487304,1,B005V5HIMC,"Bad writing, terrible acting! This is the same woman that wrote a book for playwrights?! I would NEVER purchase it. I'm sad I paid for this DVD. I probably can't even give it away. No wonder people don't take ""Black"" theater seriously.",1450656000,,235,4.619047619047619
8487305,2,B005V5HIMC,Not good. I didn't watch it all the way through. Low budget at its worse.,1448236800,,73,3.933333333333333

8487307,1,B005V5HIMC,I HATED IT!!!! It is a screen play that was video taped for a movie. The acting is awful. I think it was 2.00 and it was not worth it.,1438214400,,134,3.5
