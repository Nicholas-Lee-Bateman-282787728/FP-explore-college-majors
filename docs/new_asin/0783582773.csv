7790674,4,0783582773,"Too many documentaries about pre-colonial empires cover the same superficial topics.  I found this work refreshing and recommend it for individual viewers as well as classrooms.
The work avoids implying that the Inca were all-powerful.  It stated that their reign was slightly a century.  It includes that Incas took ideas from people who lived in Peru before them.  The work speaks of peoples called the Nazca and Mache too.
Although the work concludes with the decimation of the Inca by Pissarro, this is not the focus of the work as it is with many pre-colonial documentaries.  The work spoke about crop circles and terraces and irrigation and many other issues.
Too many documentaries have cheesy reenactments.  This work presents modern Inca performing ancient rituals.  It admits to taking clips from a Hollywood film called ""Royal Hunt of the Sun.""  The outfits were so colorful and different from modern garb that it is visually pleasing.
Again, thumbs up and well done1",1250812800,2,978,5.06875
