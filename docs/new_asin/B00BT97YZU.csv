5671547,4,B00BT97YZU,"So lets be real, what can you get out of this film.  Well if you skim the first 45 minutes, youll get the characters and a lot of really good fist fights, the old western style.  From 50 minutes on it begins the setup of a gun battle with the odds as bad as the Alamo. A LOT OF REALLY GOOD HORSE STUFF. And the shoot outs from a minute ten on are the way of the old west.  A large staged gun battle with a lot of actors on horses with real olde style guns.  And the stunt men we from the Gymnastics Team.  So it is a good spin of an hour and you will get to see some styles and shots you just don't get anymore. So fast forward and enjoy the over the top western shot like they used to be shot and shown.",1452988800,2,704,3.72972972972973
5671548,4,B00BT97YZU,"The legendary Spaghetti Western actor Franco Nero stars as a half-breed Indian outcast, who grew up being tormented by his three spiteful half-brothers. The forsaken vagabond returns home after an unnamed period of time only to be greeted by his kin with gun in hand. Luckily for Keoma, his father and now fallen idol George have remained loyal to him.

Everything from the shot selection to the acting, characters, story and overall pacing in this movie is great, all except the music. Now I understand Ennio Morricone could not possibly have scored every single Western shot in Italy during the 60's and 70's (and I don't think he should have) but the soundtrack on Keoma is awful. I could tell that they were going for a folk style, but instead they ended up with a few tracks that sounded more like wounded coyote howls with whining acoustic guitars in the background.

Enzo G Castellari, who would later go on to make the original Inglorious Bastards (1978), took a few pages out of the SP Western Godfather's playbook in this one. Using lots of close-ups and dramatic pauses as well as other subtle effects (the water hose constantly running in the middle of town), Leone's influence is strongly felt. The quick draw slo-mo scenes were very effectively used, making us feel like these cowboys were faster than greased lightning. Keoma's weapon of choice, a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun, is definitely something that sets him apart from other Western anti-heroes. This weapon was almost certainly homaged when used in the self-dubbed ""Mexican Western"", Desperado, directed by Robert Rodriguez. If you like the noodle Western genre or just Westerns in general, I highly recommend giving Keoma a viewing.",1403740800,4,1712,5.024647887323944

8573563,1,B00BT97YZU,"The truly great thing about this film is that it, eventually, ends.  Sadly, not before bludgeoning the viewer with a mare's nest of Christ metaphors mixed liberally with every stale cliche in the genre, repeated entirely too often.  Then there's the soundtrack, third rate on its best day, which isastonishinglydiminished by vocals ranging from men channeling broken machinery to females giving their best imitation of cats fighting as they drown in molasses.

8573566,4,B00BT97YZU,"Let us please drop the inaccurate classification ""Spaghetti"" for these films?  It makes little sense, and was coined by people who do not understand the films... Presumably the term is derived from the dry, unusual, and sometimes ironic, sense of humour that permeates most, but not yet all, of the {Italian} Westerns.  The humour is however neither a necessary, not a sufficient, characteristic, and so I suggest the terminology ""Spaghetti"" be dropped.

This film features Franco Nero, one of the major stars of the Italian Western, appearing here in a film with no humour, similar therefore to ""Death Rides a Horse"" (which had next to none), and ""Grand Duel"", also having very little.  ""Keoma"" is somewhat unique in that it did not have any.  In contrast, the more famous Sergio Leone Westerns tended to have much more of odd, whimsical humour.  It was perhaps this element that made his films more appealing, if only immediately so.

""Keoma"" nonetheless should be classified as ""Italian"" Western for the presence of many features that is typical of them.  Such as it's use of an anti-hero as the protagonist, being a character having good and bad moral traits at the same time; melodramatic music; the frequent use of close-ups and slow motion; violence; a convoluted and difficult plot with ironic, spiritual, or enigmatic elements; and the basic dignity, and sanctity, of death, as well as that of life.

These were challenging, intellectual, films, not for children, and additionally not for people who too quickly want to generalize and come up with ridiculous slogans.  ""Keoma"" is in line with the more serious variety of the Italian Western, similar to the twain I have mentioned, and is recommended for fans of the genre.  I did think it proved a little long due to the fact that the plot was not that substantial.",1460160000,,1824,4.928104575163399
