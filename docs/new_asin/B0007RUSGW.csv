2239333,1,B0007RUSGW,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I accidently sat down in Hitch, and about a half hour later, wish I had stayed in Hitch.  With the exception of 2 or 3 funny parts, it was horrible.  I have never walked out on a movie, but I was real close this time.  This movie was utterly depressing.  I loved Giamatti in ""Private Parts"", and wished I had stayed home and watched that again.  Take some happy pills before you watch this, to keep from slitting your wrists half way through.",1111017600,14,494,4.202127659574468
2239334,5,B0007RUSGW,"What are ordinary people in the San-San conurbation really like? Well take a look at Sideways and you get a snapshot.

American TV watchers will recognise the actors, but to most of us they are 'unknowns' which lends the characters they play almost documentary-like credibility.

It's an hilarious romp. We follow two buddies, one a seemingly intellectual good guy, who actually is a complicated, near alcoholic, self centred, unscrupulous (he steals money from his own mother !)nerd. The other, a woman-chasing ego-maniac out-of-work actor. What a combination !!! The calamitous opening scenes give us the plot,,two guys going on a stag weekend to the wine growing area of Southern California.

The film is beautifully shot and is evocative of a long gone image of the 'California Dreamin' generation. We see what they have become. Instead of 'peace and love' we have 'cheat and shove'.

The romp takes us through a delicious farce of infidelity, wine soaked sentimentalism and immorality. We are given a broad canvass and it captures a great deal, this film is a feast of images, ideas and stimulating suggestions. Ultimately, this sun-soaked portrayal of Californian life leaves us feeling fascinated by lives that are not ours, but what we may have been

or what may yet happen should we follow 'the dream' . It is brilliant!",1110844800,10,1329,5.050228310502283
2239335,5,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Buddy movies are sometimes mindless, but this is more of an ""intellectual"" buddy movie. For those who have recently been to Wine Country (as I have), it is a must-see, as it makes you just want to go right back to the vineyards of California.

Don't miss this movie!

2239336,2,B0007RUSGW,"Jack is about to be married, but decides to go on one last fling and essentially drags Miles along.  It's not that Miles dislikes the destination - wine country - when in fact Miles is a wine connoseur and frequents the wine country.  Jack is using Miles and the trip as a cover for Jack's ultimate goal - to have a last fling before marriage.

This is friendship and humor?  Miles was used by Jack over and over again.  At their destination, Jack quickly hooks up with Stephanie and leaves Miles on his own.  Miles is depressed and can't move past the thought that his wife divorced him and remarried.  Jack doesn't want Stephanie to know that he is about to be married and Jack agrees not to say anything.  Miles retrieves Jack's wallet after he left it at the home of another woman he bedded.  And, Miles covers for Jack and crashes his own car in order to develop a believable alibi for Jack's broken nose.

Although this may be reality for some men, the movie was filled with pathos.  Another reviewer likened the movie, I believe, to works by Camus.  Having recently reread ""No Exit"", I have to agree.  I hadn't thought of it at the time, but the 'humor' is in the pathos and misery of the lives of the characters and was not comedy in the traditional sense.  Had the movie been classified differently, and not as a comedy, my rating may have been higher.

The discussion of wines and wine tasting was somewhat educational.  However, I began to wish that the movie was being shown in a winery so I could enjoy drinking wine along with the characters.",1109808000,9,1556,4.445229681978798
2239337,5,B0007RUSGW,"Middle-aged Miles' (Paul Giamatti) life isn't going forward. And it isn't going backwards either. His life is going ""Sideways"".

Miles is headed to No-wheresville. He's a failed writer, has a messed up friendship with a nearly washed-up actor named Jack (Thomas Haden Church...remember the low-IQ mechanic from the WINGS TV series? Yep, he's back), and is spinning into a pit of self-loathing since his divorce two years prior.

If that weren't enough, Jack, his best buddy, is now getting married and Miles has to be his Best Man. Oh! And did we mention that Miles' ex-wife and her new husband are coming to the wedding, too. Lovely! For Miles, already on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications, something is about to break. Better do something unpredictable. But what? Ah yes! ROAD TRIP!

So Miles and Jack take a jaunt into California's wine country. Miles, who is a connoisseur of great wines, tries to teach Jake (who's only interests are in getting nasty with a girl -- any girl -- who's interested in him) how to enjoy Pinots, Blancs, and all the other available grape incarnations.

But what the two have brought along with them on this trip is their pasts, their present, and, ultimately, their futures.

Will this trip spell the end of Jack's engagement if he falls in love with someone else (or thinks he falls)? Can Miles wrestle his own personal demons out from under him while meanwhile trying to keep his best friend from self-destructing?

Okay, so some of you might be asking yourselves, ""So what's with the title of your film review?"" Let me explain. First off, this movie has zero CGI effects (Did you hear that! Zero!). Second, there are no heroic battle scenes (not really, unless you consider Susan Oh beating on someone with her motorcycle helmet a ""battle scene"") or impressive set shots. Third, this film moves you into the characters' lives gently, kind of like getting into a pool filled with ice water. You have to go slowly, let your body adjust to the temperature change. For film, this is known as plot and character development (something that Hollyweird sometimes has trouble with). Fourth, you won't find Cindy Crawford look-alikes, or Vin Diesel muscle-types strutting their stuff in this film. This movie has ""true"" characters."" They're F#@$ed up people who look like you or me. And they have real-world problems (they aren't trying to save the world from Zork-the-Terrible before he implodes Earth with his Confabulator 9000).

So if you're the type who goes into a theater expecting to be ""blown away"" by the special effects, bypass this one and spare us your review here. But if you enjoy character studies, and don't mind a slow, funny, touching, and downright realistic film, you'll probably love this one.

(Congratulations to the screenwriters for their Oscar win!)",1109635200,11,2815,4.961783439490445
2239338,4,B0007RUSGW,"Paul Giamatti (American Splendor, Storytelling) plays Miles, a man whose passion is wine and writing novels and Thomas Haden Church (Rolling Kansas, George Of The Jungle) plays Jack, a soon to be married man. Giamatti and Haden Church go take a little trip for the week test tasting wine and many other things. Haden Church, a soon to be married man goes crazy and hooks up with a single wine selling mom named Stephanie, played by Sandra Oh. Giamatti falls for divorced single wine lover Mya, played by Virginia Madsen (Candy Man, The Rainmaker). Tensions flare, comedy insues and a bunch of wine is consumed in this hilarious and  dramatic independent film directed by About Schmidt and Election director Alexander Payne. Giamatti and Haden Church give two performances that are simply outstanding and are among one of their best. Madsen is simply gorgeous as ever (Virginia Madsen is sister of actor Michael Madsen) and Sandra Oh is hot and spicy. Wine jargon to last you a life time but hey, now you know what to drink and what not to drink...thanks Sideways (2 thumbs up). I basically know what to do. It's delicate.... Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor one Oscar for best original screenplay. It also one a lot of Independent Spirit Awards...Giamatti one Best Actor.",1109635200,,1269,4.875
2239339,4,B0007RUSGW,"2004's ""little film that could"", following ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and ""Lost In Translation"". A film whose subtle touches, scenes and words stay with you long after you've left the theater. A few serious plot holes in the second half can't cancel out the writing, acting and ""I-know-someone-just-like-that (and sometimes it's me)"" realism of so many of the situations and characters' reactions to them.

The location shooting (almost all the wineries and restaurants are referred to by their real names; the Windmill Inn, which in real life is a Days Inn, is one of the few exceptions) adds to both the realism and the ""indie"" feel of the film. Likewise the writers' knowledge of wine is extensive - though it's odd that Miles would shout ""I'm NOT drinking any EFFING Merlot"" when his most prized bottle, a 1961 Cheval Blanc Bordeaux, is 40% Merlot.

Obviously the most discussed scene concerns the gorgeous metaphors exchanged by Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Maya (Virginia Madsen) on Stephanie's back porch. Absolutely nobody in the theater exhaled until the cutaway of Miles cursing himself in the bathroom. Here's hoping the Academy will use a strategically-placed bleep to permit what one wit on IMDB called ""The Virginia Monologue"" to be shown in its entirety when they acknowledge Madsen's nomination. Some here have protested that ""people don't really talk like that"", but Maya has an impressive academic resume (a professor's ex-wife who's taking post-graduate courses), and who among us hasn't used a nice buzz as an excuse to make profound pronouncements? (Nobody really says things like ""the problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world"" either....)

The plot holes (spoilers):

- Jack *had* to know that it was Miles who spilled the beans about the wedding.

- Jack's confessional about really loving Christine. If it was on the level, it runs totally counter to the scenes where he raves about Stephanie and considers calling off the wedding. If it was a put-on (remember, Jack's an ACTOR), then the audience was never given the ""wink"" to let us in on the scam.

- Miles is built up as the ultimate ""loyal friend"" with a sense of duty, yet as Best Man he abandons the wedding before the reception where he has the obligation to make the toast. This is not only completely out of character, it squanders the tragi-comic possibilities of the reception (Miles + Jack + pregnant ex-wife + alcohol...).

But again, the thoughtfulness and performances overcome these annoyances. It's also interesting that a film set entirely in California is so non-Hollywood: the lead is a balding overweight alcoholic with a blanket of back hair, there are no CGI effects, the one car crash goes ""wrong"", and even though there's a lot of sex, neither female lead has a gratuitious topless shot (and trust me, NOBODY is going to do a screen capture of the film's one frontal nudity scene!).",1108252800,,2909,4.924489795918367
2239340,5,B0007RUSGW,"Fantastic movie!  I cant watch it enough times honestly.  If you have friends and you've sort of grown up and apart over the years but you're still friends with them (sometimes questioning why) then you'll totally get this movie.  It has many facets to it from dealing with depression, divorce, finding love again, peer pressure, trying to find yourself, etc.

However, I don't feel like this movie is for everyone though.  First, I think you have to be 40ish, give or take 10 years, to truly appreciate it.  A 20 year old just isn't going to connect to the characters (more than likely).  And I feel like if you've never faced adversity, had friends who you've been friends with for a long time but maybe aren't that close with anymore, dealt with trying to re-imagine yourself, depression, anxiety, etc., you might not really appreciate it.

That said, as a current 41 year old who's had a very full life to this point, I've loved this movie since I first saw it around 10 years ago.  I absolutely love the characters, their personalities & how they interact and their intertwined stories.  I watch it over and over as I feel like I really know the characters it follows.",1524182400,,1173,4.6231884057971016
2239341,5,B0007RUSGW,"Miles Raymond (Paul Giamatti), and his best friend Jack (Thomas Hayden Church), are two middle aged men who embark on a trip across California's wine country, one week before Jack's wedding.

Miles is a divorced, crestfallen, deeply unhappy writer, to whom life has brought little except disappointment, and a deep longing for his ex-wife who is now remarried, and wants nothing to do with him.

During this long road trip (the only highlight of which is the wine), Miles anxiously awaits news about whether or not his first novel The Day After Yesterday, is finally going to be published.

Jack, meanwhile, has his own agenda...

A dyed in the wool womanizer for whom fidelity is not even a concept, Jack has vowed to get Miles (and himself) laid before the end of the week.

This means bringing the lovely Maya (Virginia Madsen), and her best friend Stephanie (Sandra Oh) into the picture.

While Jack and Stephanie quickly ""hit it off"" with the handsome Jack misleading his luscious conquest, Miles finds himself feeling more and more attracted to the enigmatic, quizzical Maya who shares his interest in wine, and might (in some strange way) turn out to be his salvation.

All four lead actors are excellent.

The story is original, funny and sad, with a screenplay which deserves the Academy Award it won.

This is a surprising film you'll never see coming.

It catches the audience off guard, a rare achievement in Hollywood.

The commentary feature... A bit of insight behind the scenes to be sure, but they didn't even have one glass of wine while commenting. Would have been great if they went through at least a few bottles, announcing what they were opening, clinking glasses together, toasting and loosening up more. Thomas starts throwing out big words with abstract references and Paul follows, which ensues a game of one-upmanship between the two throughout.

I learned a lot about wine during that movie and even more after I researched it and bought the DVD. I wasn't much of a connoisseur of wine but this movie help changed my direction.

The movie itself is funny well directed, well written and well-acted. But most of all, the interaction between Paul giamatti's character and Thomas Haden Church definitely putting up with each other.

I have definitely been swayed by the Sideways effect. My taste towards wine has definitely shifted towards the Pinot Noir.

2239432,4,B0007RUSGW,"This film directed by Alexander Payne won many awards when it came out in 2004. Its not a fast-paced film or action thriller, but a wonderful bitter-sweet film about two buddies who search somehow for their meaning of and in life. Miles Raymond a middle-aged, depressed, aspiring  but unsuccessful  writer, still moping about his failed marriage, and wine enthusiast/borderline alcoholic, who has taken a few knocks and lost his confidence and way in life, takes his soon-to-be-married actor friend and former college roommate, Jack Cole, in a final bachelor fling through the beautiful, sunny golden Californian wine country. While quaffing good quality wine both men appear to have found their soul-mates but the contrast in behaviour between the two friends is both poignant and hilarious. Its a gentle, quiet, intelligent, human, mildly amusing, gentle, yet moving film with adult themes. I liked very much the beautiful cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack, the intelligent sharp and witty screenplay and the overall melancholy tone of the movie. The plot is full of real life events and complications, and the superb narrative is matched by wonderful acting. Don't be put off by the slow start. Suddenly from not caring a damn about the characters things get so much more interesting. Wonderful film, riddled with pieces of hope and sadness. It should be on everyone's list.",1486512000,,1384,5.257918552036199

2239440,5,B0007RUSGW,"What a great movie. I saw it a long time ago and I was hankering to watch it again, only none of my subscription services had it for free with my subscription (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime) so I was kinda SOL. I figured I could pay $3.99 to rent it from Amazon Prime for a day or two, or I could pay $3.99 for the DVD and have it forever.

I just love this movie. So many memorable scenes. Paul Giamatti's Miles' frustrations are relatable and, when they come to a head, hilarious and instantly classic. Thomas Haden Church, through his character, Jack, does a great job at eliciting conflicting responses from the viewer throughout the movie. One minute, you just wanna backhand him. The next, you feel sorry for him. And hands down he has the best line in the movie. Sandra Oh's performance as Stephanie is top-notch, my favorite part of which is what would be the final interaction between her & Jack and Miles. And Virginia Madsen (Maya) is captivating thoughout the movie, but especially during her candlelit soliloquy where discusses the life of wine. Overall I give this movie 10/10. Paul G. should have won best actor at the Oscars - not that I give a darn about the Academy awards - but his acting sure came a long way since Private Parts and Big Fat Liar.

I don't even like wine, but this movie is among my favorites.",1484524800,9,1327,4.45679012345679

2239442,5,B0007RUSGW,"The ostensible truth is that this movie is about wine. The full truth is that it is about many things. It is largely about two characters, one of which wants to go to sample the wines he and his ex had a connection with. It is also a buddy travel movie, because his friend, the other main character, wants only to ""get laid"" with a stranger a week before his own upcoming nuptuals. The movie spends a lot of time contrasting these two characters separate and divergent goals, and in the process, highlights the character of Paul Giamatti, who renders it with glee, gallows humor and dark brooding between bouts of energetic self-loathing. Thomas Hayden Church is stupendous as his sidekick. However, the part of the movie
I most enjoy is Giamatti's character's meeting with that of Virginia Madsen, and their knowing double-entendre talk about the pinot-noir grape.
The discussion is about ANYTHING but the grape!",1484352000,3,913,4.858974358974359

An amazing cast and and amazing movie. I rank the film among my Top 10. So I bought the book to see exactly what was the inspiration for the film, and I was not disappointed. It turns out they copied the book almost word for word. Much of the dialogue in the novel can be found in the film, and I was actually pleased by this. The novel is very funny, just like the film. Author Rex Pickett knows how to keep you riveted to the page. The relationships between the main characters seems plausible and entertaining.

Mostly I loved the interaction between Miles and Jack, trying to see which one was more likable.  It is a road trip film, showing the two friends drive up to wine country in California.  One is an alcoholic wine snob who teaches English to junior high kids, and the other is a fading television star who likes to cheat on his fiancee. Miles has a book he is trying to publish but like everything is his life it is not going well.  And you get to meet his mom, so that he can steal money from her.  Still, it is played for laughs.  Road trip!  So along the way they drink pretentious wine and hit golfballs at other golfers and hit on women- well, mostly Jack does that.  Miles is a depressive who mopes a great deal, to Jack's consternation.  Don't worry, Jack gets what's coming to him.  No to spoil this story, but it is a great slice-of life piece with sex scenes.",1468540800,4,977,4.198924731182796
2239505,4,B0007RUSGW,"4 Stars. From the director of Election (1999), About Schmidt (2002), The Descendants (2011), and Nebraska (2013) comes another well-directed and acted story about human nature. Based on a book, the movie won the Academy Award for best Adapted Screenplay and earned nominations for Best Picture, Directing, Actor in Supporting Role (Thomas Haden Church), and Actress in Support Role (Virginia Madsen). Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a lonely writer, who has never gotten over his divorce three years ago. His book, based on personal details of his marriage, is being shopped around. Hes the best man for his old college friend and has been actor, Jack (Church). As lover of wine, Miles plans a week long getaway for them in the wine country north of LA with tastings and golf. Once they embark, things instantly turn sour. Miles is a borderline alcoholic, who drinks to forget the failed marriage that he still dwells upon and his poor career as a writer. Jack sets out to score a few more times before he ties the knot. Jack hooks up with a waitress, Stephanie (Sandra Oh), which strains his relationship with Miles. Jack spends the days with Stephanie against Miles approval, and Jack is sick of Miles constant drinking and dwelling on the pass. Stephanie helps set Miles up with Maya (Madsen), whom Miles had a crush on. Soon after Miles mentions to Maya that Jack is getting married, and things get worse. Funny and moving, this movie was surprise hit. All the characters were dealing with their own issues, which is why it is extremely human. Miles alcoholism was never really addressed in the end, as he downed his prize bottle of wine in a styrofoam cup at a fast food joint. It gave the movie an added edge along with the ending where it cuts on Miles knocking on Mayas door. We never learn what happens, only that the characters have changed. The movie also impacted the wine industry, as Miles favored Pinot Noirs, where sales rose 16%, and hated Merlot, where sales dropped 2% that year. Throughout his career, Payne has always dealt with his unique brand of human comedy, and its most effective in this movie. Its definitely worth checking out (again).",1468454400,,2157,4.785522788203753

The things they did were also entirely uninteresting.

There are a few things about this movie that I'll remember and appreciate, which is why it's not one star. There's the Merlot quote and a handful of quotes from the wine tasting montage that collectively make a couple minutes of good cinema. The plot, characters, and dated nature of the film (even though it's not THAT old), I'll do my best to forget. Just go look through the ""quotes"" in IMDB and see how bored you get.

One man is taking a little time off before his wedding by going to the wine country north of Santa Barbara. A washed up actor, he has sex with two women in preparation for his nuptials. The other guy, his sidekick, is divorced and also suffers from low self esteem. At one point, in a wine tasting room, the second guy gets angry because the attendant won't pour him a full glass.

2239543,2,B0007RUSGW,"Update:

Sorry that some didn't like my review, but frankly it was a bad movie.  It's only my opinion.

About a wine connoisseur who goes on a weekend wine trip with his friend Jack.  Except Jack is getting married and wants to cheat on his fiance.  Jack gets into all sorts of trouble when doing this and pulls Miles into the fray as well.

Miles is an insecure wine lover who takes anti depressants and gets drunk whenever he thinks about his two year old divorce, especially when he finds out his ex is getting married.  His friend Jack is a pig who gets girls into bed with him with disasterous results!

Overall, good cinematography and you learn a lot about the wine industry, but the unneeded sex images and the clearly immoral Jack make for a tough watch.  The ending is sweet though, so worth one watch.",1461542400,,812,4.4324324324324325

I failed to comprehend what a hard working intelligent woman who put herself through college would see in the main character.  Hopefully, it was pity and she moved on.  If possible, his failed actor friend was even lower on the human scale.  What bothered me most was that they got away with their behavior.

2239569,5,B0007RUSGW,"From Alexander Payne comes an outstanding and impeccably performed film, that is poignant, deeply funny, tragic and truthful, with some consistent moments of wit as well. Sideways also gets my pick as the best film of 2004, and there were a few strong films that year, however it was this film that touched me the most.

For one thing, it looks beautiful. The cinematography is stunning and the scenery is wonderfully picturesque. The music is lovely, while the direction is faultless. I also loved how engaging the story was, and how fresh it was as well, while the script is both moving and funny. As far as I could see, there were no pacing problems, it may start slow, but the quality of everything else left me transfixed.

The acting is absolutely astonishing. Paul Giamatti is brilliant as Miles, a teacher full of nervous self-loathing, while Thomas Haden Church is excellent as Jack, a deliciously deadpan sort of character who provides the laughs. Miles is the more likable character of the two I agree as you feel genuinely for him, while Virginia Madsen's character is the most likable in the film, and speaking of Virginia Madsen she was delightful in this film.

It's one of my favorite movies and gets better and funnier every time I watch it - not to mention that it was nominated for Best Picture and has 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes!  Come on, people!  It's a great buddy picture, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church have great chemistry (if you buy the DVD or Blu-ray, you must watch with their audio commentary. It's like watching the movie with Miles and Jack.  :-)

Some reviewers say it's not the most uplifting movie.  Well, sure, it has some sad, maybe even depressing elements and centers around two characters who are SERIOUSLY flawed and do some despicable things, but to me, that's what makes it so good (and Jack, the lesser of the two, definitely gets what's coming to him).  It's not fairy tale, but it doesn't end on a sad note.

I would highly recommend this for those who can laugh at dry comedy, love wine, love a buddy picture, if you're a fan of either actor or especially the director (Alexander Payne, who also directed Election, About Schmidt, The Descendants and Nebraska - I haven't seen The Descendants yet, but the others are all very good.)",1454803200,,1162,4.552884615384615

It plays twice in the movie:  an edited version during a love scene, and the full version during the last sequence of the movie.  This piece of music alone makes the movie so worth checking out!!

Acting and cinematography are very, very good. The male leads brought to mind specific belly-button staring acquaintances whose pathological commitment to self and imagined hardships make them tiresome in the best of circumstances.  The strongest character in the movie is Madsen's whose character is undermined by improbabilities.

The acting is wonderful, don't get me wrong, the reason it gained an extra star from me was the portrayal of the characters, but the story in general just about put me to sleep.

2239685,5,B0007RUSGW,"A very good filmmaker in Alexander Payne meets a quirky, wine-soaked script and together they create Sideways (2004) - an excellent romantic comedy and subtle road trip movie. Payne really finds the beauty in the Santa Barbara and Ventura County regions of Southern California wine country. He combines that natural beauty with flawed people trying to find beauty and naturalness in their own lives. The low-key, jazzy musical score never interferes with the dialogue, which is key to this film's success. It is funny and heartfelt at the same time. Paul Giamatti plays Miles as a self-loathing, wine-loving wingman to Thomas Hayden Church's up tempo, albeit wine-ignorant, charmer; a nice contrast. The female leads also complement each other nicely. Virginia Madsen uses listening and conversation as a tool to pry open the hard-shelled, crusty Miles to reveal a good guy who loves wine, wants love, and to be taken seriously. Meanwhile, Sandra Oh's flirty Maya scores the right pitch with Church's character Jack: a man-child who is as funny and he is insecure. Character-driven, uniquely set in the west coast wine country, and wonderful human writing make Payne's Sideways a winner. It is tough not to like it.",1429315200,,1215,5.141414141414141

2239785,5,B0007RUSGW,"A very personal favorite of mine, I love this movie.  I am Miles Raymond in so many ways. Tentative, reluctant to act out of fear of failure, a wine aficionado, and often a prescription drug abuser. The saddest scene is when Miles fails to act on Maya's obvious affection for him, after two great incisive soliloquies by each character. Instead, he retreats to the bathroom and curses himself as being a sore, pathetic loser. He then tries to make up for his not ""striking while the iron is hot"" in the kitchen scene, but it's too late. You can't force romance on a woman after the right moment has passed. An overall poignant, complex character study, this movie's quartet of actors bring the story to vivid life with brutal honesty, pathos, humor, and love. I finally bought a copy from Amazon for my movie collection, not sure why it took me so long, as I've seen the movie three times previously, and it always gets better with each viewing.",1407024000,,945,4.591715976331361

2239812,1,B0007RUSGW,"Its rare that I walk out of a movie but Sideways prompted me to leave and get a refund. It had nothing to do with the acting, I love the four main actors and their work was stellar but it was the story that sucked big time. First off lets be honest, if you identify with this film you are a sad, sad individual. In fact if you weren't a little repulsed by the actions of the two male stars you seriously have zero standards in your life. Perhaps that is why I didn't like the film, I wouldnt associate with Cretans like this and to be totally honest I have never met anyone that is this pathetic so the film loses out on the believability scale.

I love good stories and unbelievable charcters and science fiction but that was the problem, the film tried to portray this a real-life scenario. And while I don't doubt that there are losers like this, they usually appear on Jerry Springer for all of us to gawk.

To those who call this a buddy flick, you completely missed the fact that Jack and Miles don't like each other very much. I find it amazing reading other peoples reviews who don't see this and think they are in fact true friends. The movie went to great lengths to show that they are only together because it seems no one else would be friends with these consummate losers in life.

If you think this is a wine flick then you have almost zero knowledge of wine. Personally I think all of the wine faux pas were the writers attempt at making fun of the audience who want to be as pretentious as Miles without having any knowledge of what they are talking about. It also pokes funs at Miles who values intelligence over anything else but shows that he actually is not as bright as he thinks while Jack who doesnt give a damn about IQ is actually the more intelligent one, albeit the more slimy one.

The bottom line is if you are identifying with this film or claiming that you know Jack or Miles you need some serious help. This film is about the pathetic losers in life and how they can make almost everyone miserable around them. If this sort of thing appeals to you than enjoy, as for me I will give it a pass.",1396915200,3,2124,4.25
2239813,1,B0007RUSGW,"This was very depressing. I love wine, drama, comedy. This was odd, depressing, and we didn't finish watching the movie.",1396742400,,120,5.05
2239814,5,B0007RUSGW,"SIDEWAYS is a buddy flick about two friends who travel for a week of wine-tasting together as one last hurrah before one of the friends gets married. Paul Giamatti stars as the slightly-mild mannered and extremely intelligent Miles Raymond. Miles is finding himself in a serious mid-life crisis. His wife of several years divorced him two years prior, running away with her extramarital lover. Miles is a writer, but every publishing company in the country has rejected his manuscript except for one. He can't even get any free lance work and has wound up teaching 8th grade English at a college prep school. Miles' best friend is Jack (Thomas Haden Church). They first met as roommates during their freshmen year at college. Their lives are very much total opposites: Jack is a jock, Miles is not; Jack is very handsome and suave, Miles is an everyman; Jack isn't all that intelligent, Miles is too smart for his good sometimes. Nevertheless, the two became best friends in college and have remained so throughout their lives.

Jack is engaged to a beautiful young woman whom he seems to love very much. The wine-tasting trip is Miles' gift to Jack for his wedding. The duo really don't journey all that far geographically. But each of them travels an immense distance emotionally, mentally, and psychologically during their week trip. The two travel from one winery to another. Along the way, Jack meets up with a young woman named Stephanie whom he becomes consumed by lust for. Miles on the other hand, realizes that a young waitress at one of the local eateries is someone who he shares a great deal in common with. Troubles ensue for both men, but the picture ends on a note of unsaccharinated hope.

The writing in the movie is fantastic. Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor's script has some unbelievable dialogue. Wine is a key backdrop in the film, but serves more as metaphor than anything else. In addition to the writing, the acting is superb. Paul Giamatti gives a brilliant performance and was once again snubbed by the Academy for his efforts. I guess Hollywood is ready to let normal looking people back into their elite club, yet. All of the supporting roles were just as strong as Giamatti's performance and are a joy to watch together.

A couple of side notes, Payne brings back a character (Dr. Hendricks) from one of his previous works, ELECTION, as a very minor character in the film. Also, Jack makes several references to his career in the movie. Many of these references are actually sidebars about Thomas Haden Church's real-life career.

Overall, SIDEWAYS is a wonderful and brilliant quirky, little film. Not everyone will enjoy it. But it does capture the essence of the struggle of a man at midlife and is worth watching for Giamatti's performance.",1396569600,,2774,4.833684210526315
2239815,5,B0007RUSGW,"I liked this film well enough the first time around, but after a second viewing a year later, I've become somewhat fascinated by it. Paul Giamatti's performance is enough to make you cry. Some people have disliked the film, which I think is because it it's a bit slower and makes you inhabit the awkward and mundane moments in the characters' lives as well as the beautiful, emotional, or funny. Personally I like subtle movies, and the traces of bitterness and hope in equal measure in this one get me every time. Also, the backdrop of California's vineyards is wonderful.",1396483200,,573,4.74

The people who put this movie together put it together from the point of view of the line in this movie that a bottle of wine is alive.
The story has depth and the characters are totally believable. This movie is one of those excellent ""slice of life"" movies that convinced you that the characters here are real people and the story is real and not just excellent actors you see on the screen.
Slice of life movies are my favorites and those movies, the well-made ones are very rare in American cinema today.
Great combination of comedy and drama. Great story from the start as it slowly unfolds before your eyes. I am sorry I missed this one at the theater but this is a great one to watch on today's large screen televisions what with the very beautiful California wine country as one of the characters in the movie.

2239838,4,B0007RUSGW,"Warning: my attitude towards this film is idiosyncratic.  I adamantly refused to see this film when it was new, because I didn't like what I read in the reviews.  When it came out in 2004 I was a relatively new wine connoisseur, and the film seemed to represent superficial notions about wine.  I might still find fault with the film's depiction of drinking in wine bars, since my idea of mixing wine and romance is a tete-a-tete with a great wine and a great meal prepared by a sensuous lover...but that's a different story.  I thoroughly sympathized with Miles' disdain for mediocre so-called ""Merlot"" - but felt a wine-lover's annoyance at the unfair slight to a great grape!  I know - what doest this have to do with film?  It's CA Merlot that is the problem!  Smith Haut-Laffite '95 was an awesome wine - a Bordeaux blend based primarily on Merlot. Joseph Phelps Insignia from CA is an excellent Bordeaux-style blend which depends on Merlot.  Pape Clement makes an excellent moderately expensive wine based primarily on Merlot. So let's not diss Merlot!  What does that have to do with the film?  Nothing! Since I study film, and this film received great reviews including a 96% Rotten Tomatoes rating, I had to watch it - and I enjoyed it very well.  It's an excellent ensemble film, in which wine isn't much more than a pretense for the story, which in many ways follows a pattern of other good stories featuring one uptight guy and one looser.  The writers received an Academy Award for their excellent work and deserved it.  The acting was excellent as well, and the characters are appealing.

""Sideways"" was a little independent film that made modest waves the year it came out. Paul Giamatti (""The Illusionist"" and ""American Splendor"") plays a recently divorced schlub who has a hobby of wine tasting. An old acquaintance from college has sent him a wedding invitation, and because Giamatti's character doesn't have many friends, he decides to take this guy (Thomas Haden Church, who was nominated for an Academy Award for this role) on a wine-tasting tour of the California wine country as a wedding gift. This is more an excuse for companionship than an act of generosity.

The friend is blustery, claims to be blissfully happy with his impending marriage and is delighted to take off on the tour. The minute they get out of town, he starts being an absolute jerk. He is immediately unfaithful to his fiance, gets into one scrape after another and generally turns this ""gift"" into an unmitigated disaster. HE is on a wine-drinking tour, not a wine-tasting one.

Sandra Oh plays one of the women with whom he hooks up. When she discovers that the men have to be back ""home"" in time for his wedding, she pops a cork! That scene is immensely satisfying to every woman in the audience, so stay with it, even when you are becoming very impatient with the characters. Talk about getting your just deserts!

Having watched this almost 10 years ago for the first time I am not surprised when I find something new in it, I don't know if time has given me a different perspective or it had been there all along. If you want to watch a movie about love there are plenty of those around, or about rites of passage, or about friendship or even depression but somehow this movie has all of that but none of those elements define it; this is the sort of movie you could paraphrase in a couple of sentences, but that would always be selling it short.

The movie doesn't go out of it's way, to be raunchy for cheap laughs. ..Pretty much how guys talk and act when they're not with mixed company.

It's kind of a mid-life crisis movie. ..Or the humorous side of mid-life crisis. ..The comedy is mostly due to one guy being in crisis mode and the other guy looking to have a wild time before his wedding. ..Neither of these guys would be one of my buddies in real life (both are irritating), but they are funny characters. ..Sandra Oh is really cute in this movie.",1375315200,,824,4.437086092715232

2239894,5,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways is one of my favorite movies of all time. I have watched it at least three times a year for the last 7 years. I just ordered a new DVD because the old one was worn out and scratched. Can't wait to watch the new copy. I don't know why it is that I like this movie so much. Watching it is like hanging out with my two best friends. I just feel totally comfortable hanging around with Miles and Jack. I used to be like Miles after getting left by each of my first two girlfriends. I was despondent and anti-social for 6 months to a year after both incidents. I didn't want to even think about getting with new girls for the first six months after they left me. I was a total sap. I was dependent on them for my sense of identity and confidence. So I can really identify with Miles for saying, ""I just got divorced, Phyllis"" to his mom when he actually had been divorced for two years. I am also a writer, like Miles, looking for a home for my new book.

I also really really relate to Jack, the actor from LA who is getting married in the movie. I also relate to his love of and need for new women. I too am an actor in LA. After doing sales for 4 years, I became much more self-confident and more of the ""lady-killer"" type and never again got that upset after a break up. Jack has a need to really party it up and tap a few women before he gets married on Saturday, something that Miles is completely uncomfortable with.
So, the two characters are opposites, just like my different personalities have been over the years. Watching the two of them interact is like watching a 26 year old version of myself hanging out with the 38 year old version of myself...totally different views of women and views of self. One is depressed, one is full of life and super confident.

I love this movie! The music is so perfect, the dialogue is so choice. The scenery is refreshing looking and nice, and the acting by Sarah Oh and the other actress are so sensitive and spot on... I hope everyone can enjoy this classic.",1369699200,2,2012,4.209844559585492

2239902,5,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways is the story of two men, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) who take a week off from their normal lives in San Diego and go to California's wine country.  The pair is a subtle, comedic duo of contrasting personalities.  Miles, is a deeply serious man who is working on a book, Jack is a carefree part-time actor who is betrothed to the sumptuous daughter of a wealthy Armenian businessman.  Additionally, Jack is one of those men who have little talent other than seducing women.

In both cases they are men who have failed to launch.  Miles is a divorced 8th Grade English Teacher who dreams of publishing a great work of literature, but hasn't yet and Jack has a difficult time admitting to himself his acting career is going nowhere.

While away from home and commitments, they connect with two women, Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh).  Jack's affair with Stephanie leads to serious, last minute doubts on the part of Jack and his pending marriage, but Miles meets his soul mate.  The resulting situation is a complex, interesting study of the gray areas of life.  It is a balanced, well-aged, full bodied comedy.

The movie is filmed in a most realistic way.  It is clearly California 2005.  Illegal immigrants pick the grapes, Bush and Rumsfeld are shown on TV, the hotel has the pre-fabricated, mid-grade Hotel look, there are many shots of on-ramps, freeways, and suburban sprawl.  The apartments of both Maya and Miles have an old, shabby-made in the 1950's look to it.  When the characters drink, the film takes a soft focus of wine goggles.

As the vacation progresses, Jack decides to make the commitment and get married and the movie ends with Miles seemingly able to get the inspiration he needs to make it as a writer from Maya.",1364947200,3,1785,4.75

Ridiculous moral judgements of the characters or shallow observations about who would date these men in 'real life' is like looking for aerodynamic flaws in a movie about dragons. What is authentic, and the focus of the film, is that life is not tidy, it doesn't always get wrapped up in 90 minutes like American Idol finales and can be ugly and beautiful all at once. This movie is a great example of what happens when a darling of independent film festivals become large enough to go mainstream and becomes widely available. If you want a movie that delivers a truly unrealistic outcome then simply visit the Rom-Com section of this site and search 'Matthew+ McConaughey' and you will LOVE the ending, or if non-stop action if your thing, any Mission Impossible movie will do.

2239936,5,B0007RUSGW,"SPOILER ALERT!

Much like the pinot noir described in the movie, this film is full of complexity, nuance and depth.  It is an extremely intelligent movie that only gets better as different layers are discovered upon multiple viewing.  It is a lot like wine that gets better with age.  This movie is an exploration of the human condition:  the frailties, the hope, the weaknesses, the desperation, the beauty and the inevitable humor that result from the follies of the characters--mostly Miles' depression and Jack's peter-pan syndrome.  Additional depth can be found in the way the anthropomorphic qualities of wine and wine-making are explored and juxtaposed with human nature as a metaphor.  And herein lies the genious of this movie.

Pinot noir is a delicate grape that is difficult to grow.  It is high-maintenance and result in low yields.  If done right, the result is a wine of complexity, subtlety, nuance and uncommon flavor.  Much like his beloved varietal, Miles (Giamatti) is a complex, erudite scribe with a delicate psyche.  As pinots are sensitive to its environment; so is Miles.  As harsh and extreme weather conditions would destroy the pinot noir, the harshness of life (dealing with a divorce from someone he still loves, not being able to get his novel published) has exposed and frayed Miles' delicate nature in the form of depression, anxiety, inadequacy, self-loathing, violent intolerance towards merlot, etc.  Fortunately, nature shows him kindness, and warms his fields in the form of a beautiful, intelligent oenophile that knows and loves wine as much as he does.

Miles goes on a weeklong trip with his college friend Jack (Church).  Miles is to pinot; what Jack is to merlot.  Much like the merlot described in the movie--the approachable, fruit-forward but yet simple California merlot--Jack is a bit of a simpleton.  Jack is an overgrown child that tries to sow his wild oats as much as he possibly can before his imminent marriage.  The happy-go-lucky Jack also provides wonderful counterbalance to the sulky Miles in the form of levity and humor.  While the two buddies traverse their way through the California Central Coast, they meet Stephanie (Oh) and Maya (Madsen), who are also buddies.

Stephanie works at a vineyard.  Stephanie is bold, strong, assertive, and could even kick the ass of the man that breaks her heart.  Stephanie is an adoptee and a single mom.  In the movie, Miles describes cabernet sauvignon as a low-maintenance grape that could survive anywhere.  Stephanie is cabernet sauvignon.  Much like bordeauxs from the left-bank, cabernet and merlot blend very well in this movie in the form of Jack and Stephanie.  They waste no time in getting it on--and  get along very well....

Maya is an attractive server at a restaurant with a sharp palate.  She knows and loves wine as much as Miles.  For reasons unexplained in the film, she likes Miles.  She also studies horticulture.  While the other three (IMO) represent a grape varietal, maya, on the other hand, does not.  She plays the role of the vini-/viticulturalist that seems capable of cultivating Miles back to mental health.  (Did i mention maya studies horticulture?)

The crux of this smart film can be found in a scene where Maya leads Miles out to the patio in order to escape from the awkwardness that escalates between them as the moans and the groans emanate louder and louder from Stephanie's room.  What takes place is the most beautiful scene of the whole movie.  Miles' awkwardness and discomfort briefly disappears once Maya asks him about his ""thing"" for pinots.  Maya is somehow able to take miles away from his neuroses and coax out his passion.  In turn, Miles asks Maya how she got into wine, and what follows is a beautiful monologue that accomplishes several things:  she reveals her passion and heightens the sexual intensity to a point where Miles just cannot take it anymore and has to eject himself into the bathroom.  What follows is another brilliant scene where the inadequate, self-loathing depressive beats himself up.  And true to form, injects more awkwardness between the two by forcing himself upon her in the kitchen.  (They say self-conscious people have a poor sense of timing in the heat of passion.)

 Ultimately, the self-defeating nature of Miles takes over.  Upon hearing of his ex-wife's pregnancy to her now husband at the wedding, Miles spirals out of control, skips the reception and drinks his prized Cheval Blanc at a burger joint out of a styrofoam cup all by his lonesome.

I have to say that I am completely pleased with the video quality -- very crisp where i look for details and resolution -- wheel spokes, tree limbs, etc. I agree also with the above reviewer concerning some of the soft lighting and diffusion effects -- yes, they are indeed intentional and a good cine/photo technique in various scenes for this movie.

I went back to check a few scenes of another of my personal favorites on a standard DVD, ""Goodnight and Good Luck"" which was filmed in beautiful black and white-- on my player this DVD reaches near HD, BD quality also. One has to remember the DVD/BRD player, with which we watch these movies. Mine is the Oppo BDP-93, easily one of the BEST for the consumer market. I have DVD movies that are so near BlueRay quality that it is indeed  difficult to tell much difference between them on this player, and video processor.

The machine/player is the one variable that makes all the difference when we are reviewing the overall quality of the DVD, or BlueRay as we individually perceive it. So -- for my money, the BlueRay version is definitely a keeper.

Just received my BD version of ""China Town"" this week -- can't wait to check this one!",1347494400,,1347,4.526748971193416

2239945,5,B0007RUSGW,"In SIDEWAYS, Miles Raymond (Giamatti), a middle-aged wine connoissseur who dreams of publishing a novel, takes old college buddy Jack (Haden-Church) to California's wine country for a week of good food and drink, great scenery and some golf, prior to Jack's imminent marriage.

Being a total heel, Jack gets very involved with a local gal named Stephanie (Oh) and never tells her until it's almost time to go back home that he's engaged. Meanwhile, often-inebriated Miles finds out no publisher wants his book just as he falls for unlucky Stephanie's girlfriend, Maya (Madsen).

This rather dark ""comedy"" is actually one of the most introspectively maudlin pictures you could possibly see, however knowing this going in, you can't ask for a more engaging story or cast.

2239952,5,B0007RUSGW,"""Sideways"" is a buddy film where a bachelor week to wine country in Northern California allows two good friends to enjoy some time away from the city.

Protagonists Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) are at different stages in their lives with Miles clinically depressed because of his divorce and Jack about to take the plunge for the first time in his life.

The two are an unlikely pair as Miles presents as considerate while Jack is reckless and is only interested in thrills for himself.

During their trip away they put themselves in situations which bring out the best and the worst in each other. Their adventures and misadventures are entertaining, yet it is the unveiling of their true demeanour and the direction they take with their lives that gives the viewer a lot to enjoy.

But the main problem I had with this film is the same problem I always seem to have with R rated films:  They would be as good or better if they were PG.  There is no subtlety in filmmaking these days.  As if I couldn't tell the characters were having sex unless I actually see their legs in the air and their bare ugly asses.  For some reason film directors have a need to shock us with pornographic images.  The depictions od sex in this film weren't as graphic as what you often see, but they were totally unnecessary.  Same goes for the drug use.  Is getting the R rating really that important?

But besides that, there was, as I said plenty to dislike about the characters.  I will break with many of the other negative reviews at a certain point.  I saw Miles character as yes, a worthless, self centered yuppie type, but he was obviously aware that something was lacking in his life and he does in fact take the next step into adulthood by the end. A bit late in life, but he does.",1331683200,5,1109,4.309178743961352
2239956,3,B0007RUSGW,"This is a somewhat enjoyable film, but more than anything else it is a 2 hour commercial for the vintners of California, and, in particular, those north of Santa Barbara.

The irony of it is that we were thinking of going for a wine tour vacation in California, and watched the movie to heighten our interest.  Suddenly, though, Germany seems ever so much more interesting ...

The problems with the film start in the first line of dialogue, in the first scene, where we see that the central character of the film is an habitual liar - you know, the stupid kinds of lies people make as excuses?  A little later we see this 40-ish character make an unannounced visit to his aging mother, ostensibly as a birthday surprise, but in reality to steal money from her.  In many movies this kind of incident is a set-up scene for later events - one might expect that before the end of the film he would have a growth moment, return the money, make apologies, etc., etc., and become a better person. But no, not so much.  Not in this film.

The other male character is not as sympathetic.  He merely decides to decieve a single mother for a week of sex as a prelude to marriage to his fiancee.

The film follows this nebish guy and his lounge-lizard-Larry friend as they proceed from vinyard to vinyard - one wine commercial after another, in effect.

Altough the film never says so (is it in denial?) the central character is pretty clearly an alcoholic, and one can understand from his phone call to his former wife that his over-indulgence in the fruit of the grape may have been a factor in their divorce.  So the movie then details his attraction to another woman eminently suited to enabling his alcoholism.  His friend has problems with a sex drive that needs therapy and all sorts of problems with honesty and trustworthiness.

The movie is supposed to be a (romantic?) comedy.
It is diverting.  The scenery isn't bad to look at.  There are worse movies, definitely.
The comedy, and the script generally, is pretty lame - rather like a guy who has had too much to drink and can't, ... well, ... you know...",1331510400,4,2105,4.531746031746032

What begins as a tour of California wineries and golf courses takes a fateful turn as the groom-to-be makes clear his intention to sample more than just prestigious vintages and pristine fairways.  It is a dearth of the more salacious pleasures (rather those of dusky pinots and well-manicured greens) that Jack anticipates with the coming of married life, as his quest for wanton female companionship becomes the focus of their trip.  This change of agenda proves to be unnerving to poor Miles: an intellectual oenophile, English teacher, and frustrated novelist still gun shy in wake of his recent divorce.  Nevertheless, these adventures prove illuminating for these two very different friends.  While Miles, at the urging of the gregarious Jack, attempts to be more outgoing, Jack ultimately seems to take to heart Mile's concern regarding his reckless behavior.",1316995200,,967,5.253246753246753

2239969,5,B0007RUSGW,"As anyone who has seen Paul Giamatti act will know, nobody does miserable/depressed/self-loathing/angst-ridden/complicated/face-like-a-slapped-bottom better than him. When a film needs a complex male character who can convey troubled and complicated emotions, Giamatti's the go-to guy. His face is a portrait worthy of a hybrid Hieronymus Bosch-van Gogh-Edvard Munch painting. In other words, he's a master of confused misery. Is there any other actor - besides the late Philip Seymour Hoffman - who can rank with him for complexity?

Unsurprisingly, then, Giamatti's most notable roles are masterclasses in misery. One only needs to think of Lady In The Water (2006), where he plays Cleveland Heep, a miserable, depressed caretaker/superintendent; American Splendor (2004), in which he inhabits the soul of Harvey Pekar, the depressed, famous underground comic book novelist. Besides which, there's his vastly underrated film, Cold Souls (2009), in which he plays a version of his 'real' self and who is angst-ridden to the umpteenth degree from losing his actor's soul - and reminiscent of Malkovich in Being John Malkovich (2000).

So, to this glorious film: It's a lovely, touching movie, that uses as its springboard a venture into Californian wine country, as a holiday between two male friends. Thomas Haden Church plays a superficial, selfish guy, albeit always good-humoured. He's about to get married and wants to have some last flings before doing so. The other, of course, is Giamatti's character, an unpublished novelist, depressed and (surprise) self-loathing, obsessive wine connoisseur, who is still suffering from the divorce from his wife two years previously.

The two female leads, Virginia Madsen, who plays the love interest to Giamatti's character, and Sandra Oh, who plays the sex/passion interest of Thomas Haden Church's character, are both performed with sensitivity, good humour and a touching, gentle and real grace.

While some have described this as a slow/or slow start movie, arguably it's a drama that instead builds gradually on a simple premise and, as it does so, it unravels/reveals a mesh of complex themes around love, desire, denial, depression, hypocrisy, friendship, self-respect, integrity and passion.

It's also a great addition to the Hollywood road trip genre as well as buddy/friendship sagas. Having watched it a good few times, it doesn't lose its charm. The dialogue is crisp and sharp, the acting from the entire ensemble is top notch and it's a joy, joy, joy - besides which, you gain a wonderful education about some terrific Californian wines along the way - cheers!

2239971,5,B0007RUSGW,"What do you get when you put together two guys going through a mid-life crisis, wine country and a humorous yet moving portrayal of all the ups and downs of life?  You get the best film of 2004.  Miles is a depressed English teacher that went through a divorce two years ago and has a drinking problem.  His best friend Jack is an irresponsible has-been actor that is about to get married.  The two of them take a trip to wine country to celebrate Jack's wedding.  While Miles believes that this is going to be a regular trip, Jack decides to have one last fling before the big day.  While in wine country, they come across Maya (an acquaintance of Miles) and her friend, Stephanie.  During this one week, Miles and Jack will learn important lessons about who they are, what they want and that little ""Sideways"" adventure called life.  The direction and script are top notch but what really makes this film are the performances by the four leads.  Paul Giamatti gives the performance of the his career a man who's life is not turning out the way he would like it too and where he goes from here.  Thomas Haden Church also shines as a guy who makes many reckless mistakes but also learns about himself in the process.  You might not like them at first but by the end of the film, you find yourself both liking and feeling sympathy for the both of them (especially Miles).  Virginia Madsen is terrific as a waitress at Miles favorite restaurant that is going through the growing pains of life.  The scene with her and Miles talking about wine (when in actuality they are describing themselves) is a major highlight.  Sandra Oh was also good even though we do not see as much of her.  She is lively and feisty as Jack's ""love interest.""  The film works because all of these characters are real people with hopes, dreams, desires and their own sets of problems.  Because of this, we can relate to all of them.  The film received a total of five Academy Award nominations (Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor for Church and Supporting Actress for Madsen).  The real crime here is that Paul Giamatti's humorous and moving performance was not nominated for Best Actor.  This man was the emotional core of the entire movie.  His character might have seemed pompous and self-centered but we really feel for this guy and hope that things will turn around for him.  The ending perfectly does this.  As a little side note, the ending mirrors the very beginning of the film but you will have to see it for yourself.  For anyone going through the ups, downs and ""sideways"" of life (whether young, middle aged or old), you need to see this movie.  It was a life changing experience for me and I am only 23-years-old.  The first time I watched it I was a couple of years ago.

2239973,4,B0007RUSGW,"2004's ""little film that could"", following ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and ""Lost In Translation"". A film whose subtle touches, scenes and words stay with you long after you've left the theater. A few serious plot holes in the second half can't cancel out the writing, acting and ""I-know-someone-just-like-that (and sometimes it's me)"" realism of so many of the situations and characters' reactions to them.

The location shooting (almost all the wineries and restaurants are referred to by their real names; the Windmill Inn, which in real life is a Days Inn, is one of the few exceptions) adds to both the realism and the ""indie"" feel of the film. Likewise the writers' knowledge of wine is extensive - though it's odd that Miles would shout ""I'm NOT drinking any EFFING Merlot"" when his most prized bottle, a 1961 Cheval Blanc Bordeaux, is 40% Merlot.

Obviously the most discussed scene concerns the gorgeous metaphors exchanged by Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Maya (Virginia Madsen) on Stephanie's back porch. Absolutely nobody in the theater exhaled until the cutaway of Miles cursing himself in the bathroom. Here's hoping the Academy will use a strategically-placed bleep to permit what one wit on IMDB called ""The Virginia Monologue"" to be shown in its entirety when they acknowledge Madsen's nomination. Some here have protested that ""people don't really talk like that"", but Maya has an impressive academic resume (a professor's ex-wife who's taking post-graduate courses), and who among us hasn't used a nice buzz as an excuse to make profound pronouncements? (Nobody really says things like ""the problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world"" either....)

The plot holes (spoilers):

- Jack *had* to know that it was Miles who spilled the beans about the wedding.

- Jack's confessional about really loving Christine. If it was on the level, it runs totally counter to the scenes where he raves about Stephanie and considers calling off the wedding. If it was a put-on (remember, Jack's an ACTOR), then the audience was never given the ""wink"" to let us in on the scam.

- Miles is built up as the ultimate ""loyal friend"" with a sense of duty, yet as Best Man he abandons the wedding before the reception where he has the obligation to make the toast. This is not only completely out of character, it squanders the tragi-comic possibilities of the reception (Miles + Jack + pregnant ex-wife + alcohol...).

But again, the thoughtfulness and performances overcome these annoyances. It's also interesting that a film set entirely in California is so non-Hollywood: the lead is a balding overweight alcoholic with a blanket of back hair, there are no CGI effects, the one car crash goes ""wrong"", and even though there's a lot of sex, neither female lead has a gratuitious topless shot (and trust me, NOBODY is going to do a screen capture of the film's one frontal nudity scene!).",1309305600,,2909,4.924489795918367

The movie shows depth of character and juxtaposes the travails of a struggling, burnt out writer alongside the ridiculous tribulations of his immature friend about to be married and the trouble he gets himself into.  It is an ironic pairing and they are a bit of an odd couple. But the performances are brilliant. For all of Hayden-Church's character's immaturity, his performance is ripe! All the performances are brilliant and it's just a pleasure to watch over and over again.",1304899200,,1121,4.384615384615385
2239977,5,B0007RUSGW,"In SIDEWAYS, Miles Raymond (Giamatti), a middle-aged wine connoissseur who dreams of publishing a novel, takes old college buddy Jack (Haden-Church) to California's wine country for a week of good food and drink, great scenery and some golf, prior to Jack's imminent marriage.

Being a total heel, Jack gets very involved with a local gal named Stephanie (Oh) and never tells her until it's almost time to go back home that he's engaged. Meanwhile, often-inebriated Miles finds out no publisher wants his book just as he falls for unlucky Stephanie's girlfriend, Maya (Madsen).

This rather dark ""comedy"" is actually one of the most introspectively maudlin pictures you could possibly see, however knowing this going in, you can't ask for a more engaging story or cast.

2239978,1,B0007RUSGW,"No disrespect to those who loved this movie, but to me it was a wine so full of alcohol you couldn't taste the fruit.  This is the sort of movie that critics love.  Others in the same vein include Little Miss Sunshine and Annie Hall.  This is supposed to be a hilarious comedy, the best movie of the year with an incredible script.  To me it's a pretentious sitcom, but because it's a movie and not a show it can have heaps of nudity and awkward sex situations for shock humor.  The script for the first half of the movie is forced and the characters, instead of being realistic are fleshed out cliches.  At least when the women enter the dialogue gets better.  Yes, the scene between Miles and Maya is nice, but it can't save the movie.  I kept watching Miles's life tailspin wondering when the humor was supposed to come.  It, in my humble opinion, never did.  I must have been missing something, right?  I must not be smart enough and the jokes must have gone over my head.  I think, however, that they went under me.  There's a lot of low-brow humor here and the script feels weighted down by over-use of profanity.  No, saying [...] doesn't make you more realistic, nor is it especially funny.  Yet that's the opening punchline and the script-writers go-to bag of tricks.  This is a film about a loser winning (Jack) and a loser losing but perhaps making a surprise come-back (Miles).  What it never explains is the relationship between the two losers.  Why are Jack and Miles friends, and why is Miles Jack's best man?  I know, I know-- they're the odd couple and that's the point of the film, but when the only glue to hold that premise together is the excuse that they were roommates in college, then it's not credible from the beginning.  What follows builds upon that premise in a sort of frenetic ""If we pile on the booze they won't notice"" sort of way.  Well perhaps next time I'll watch this movie when I'm drunk and sideways.",1300320000,,1939,4.451704545454546
2239979,5,B0007RUSGW,"'Sideways' isn't for the simple minded, or for those that feel you have to have your life completely figured out at 13. People make mistakes. Life sometimes doesn't go the way you want it to. This is the story of trying to get back on the path to who you thought you were going to be.

Miles, a middle-aged high school teacher, takes his shallow best friend Jack on a tour of wine country for Jack's bachelor party. Once they get there, however, Jack decides to sow his wild oats by having a sexual fling instead of Mile's ideas of wine tasting, playing golf, and eating out. Miles, still fresh from his year-old divorce from a woman he's clearly not over, rebels at the idea, but is helpless as Jack does whatever he wants.

I won't go any further than that, for fear of ruining this brilliant movie for those who have the aptitude for it. I don't think that people who don't like this movie are stupid, but I do think that they don't have a grasp of how hard and bleak life can feel when nothing is going your way.

2239986,5,B0007RUSGW,"The Film

What a great film. Sideways is one of the few movies based on a book that improves a good deal over its source material. And it is absolutely hilarious. The reason I like Sideways, for better or for worse, is I know both Jack and Miles too well. At one time or another, I've walked in both of their shoes. Alexander Payne reaches a zenith of sorts with his quiet eccentric style. The film blends friendship, the road trip and a party flick. The wine provides an interesting tenor to boot. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are completely irreplaceable in their respective roles. They're sort of cosmopolitan R2D2 and C3P0 roadies.

The Blu-Ray

There's been a lot of complaints over perceived Blu-Ray quality over the standard DVD.  I can tell you, the Blu-Ray is better.  On a large 1080p screen, there is a noticeable difference.  Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael created a unique look for the visuals to give the film a signature feel.  All those smudgy light plumes, and glowing highlights come from diffusion and slight overexposure folks, maybe even a shot of digital grading to punch the highlights.  None of those things lend themselves to the sharpest end products - the end product is a vintage style soft image.  The Blu-Ray IS indeed better. There is no way i would choose the DVD over this. If you don't have a big enough 1080p screen for it to matter, however, the DVD will probably suffice.  But come on, at $10 for the BD, why choose the DVD?",1287792000,15,1474,4.656370656370656

Plus they are losers with a sense of adventure, and they are trying or hoping (kind of) to stop being losers.

Charles Krauthammer, the conservative political columnist, praised this movie as being highly intelligent. He was correct. The movie is so intelligent that it demands that you be intelligent too. Not about wine (although some people say that too), but about people. To enjoy this movie you will need to be understanding of people, both in the sense of caring about people and knowing them. The movie is a satire of sorts but, because it likes its characters, does not bite. It does not want to draw blood. It knows that being screwed up does not mean that we are not lovable. This movie proves that sometimes we do laugh to keep from crying. If this story wasn't so charming, it would be depressing.",1285632000,6,1159,4.545454545454546
2239988,5,B0007RUSGW,"I watched ""Sideways"" several months ago and I find myself still thinking about it a lot.  I watched it because it won an Oscar for something, I don't even know what.  My guess would be for Best Writing.  Anyway, I wasn't expecting anything all that much but I was very impressed on how the movie kept coming at me with more and more to offer.

The story begins with a look at what appears to be a rather inept individual.  It's a lot of little things (along with an apparent hangover) that gives us this impression.  That's one of the keys to ""Sideways""; the many subtle little things that enhance the movie.

We come to understand that the man is picking up a former college roommate for a two-some bachelor party weekend in the California wine district.  The ex-roommate has a personality; our main character seems to lack anything of the sort.

They arrive at their motel and start checking out the scene and we gradually get to know more and more about these guys.  The ex-roommate is out to have fun; the other has planned how they will have fun.  One is spontaneous and the other is calculated and that is another key to ""Sideways""; the way these two play off each other.

There's a lot of funny things that take place in the movie.  I would categorize ""Sideways"" as a comedy.  However, the part that impressed me the most was the romantic aspect of the movie.  I was really touched by the relationship that developed with our bumbling hero.  It was the part that stayed with me the longest.

So many laughs and a bit of anguish led me to conclude that Hollywood can still do it.  ""Sideways"" is my idea of a complete movie.",1285113600,3,1629,4.427609427609427

2239992,4,B0007RUSGW,"What is so excellent about Sideways is not the plot, although the plot could not be much better. It is not the acting, though this cast does some of the best work I have seen in ages, nor is it the writing, though if I could write like this, I certainly would not be here talking to you about Sideways at 2am on a Monday morning.

But this film has an amazing way of making you sympathize, and care for, two deeply flawed characters. Miles, (Paul Giamatti) who broke up with his previous girlfriend, is waiting to hear if his novel will see print, and is drinking heavily, decides to bring his friend Jack on a last party through California Wine Country a week before he gets married.

Miles is depressed about his state of affairs, and this shows both in how limps himself through the trip, and the amount he drinks. He is a wine expert, but a definite swallower as opposed to a taster. This becomes clearly evident when he grabs an entire bowl of spit out wine at a tasting and, in a desperate moment, gulps the vino.

Jack's (Thomas Haden Church) problem is women. He tries, and succeeds, at picking up any women he meets during the trip, despite his upcoming tying of the not. Depressed and drunk as Miles is he is unable to partake in any of this, even when the friends pick up two beautiful and smart women on their road adventure. (Sandra Oh and Virgina Madson)

Both men engage in more than their share of bad behavior during the trip, but it is behavior driven by depression, compulsion, and the most human of heartbreak and vulnerability. We have all acted like this or felt this bad at one point or another. But watching the relationship between the two men, how they support and compliment each other in their imperfection, is what makes us love these characters.

The buddy film goes back to the beginning of cinema, and the road movie has been used regularly since the 1960s. Both devices work here, but it is how Sideways shows how two incredibly faulted yet fundamentally decent people can connect with each other, and us. I was reminded watching Sideways how hard, and easy, it is, to keep a bond with someone as imperfect as I am. As we all are.",1278201600,2,2163,4.452020202020202

So you have a pairing of Giamatti & Haden Church as ""road buddies,"" out for a final fling before T.H.C.'s wedding. Madsen's a waitress, Oh is a wine pourer in a winery, the four hook up, chaos ensues.

You have to have some interest in what Giamatti and Haden Church's characters have (or have not) ""done with their lives."" When it comes to Madsen and Oh, it's basically ""smart women, foolish choices.""

Mix in breathtaking scenery of the SoCal wine country and a lite-jazz soundtrack and you see that one person's five star film is another person's one star film.

For me, it's five.

Giamatti's ""woulda, coulda, shoulda"" personality won't make you want to rush up and give him a hug, but we've all either KNOWN that kind of person or have BEEN that kind of persom. Haden Church is a nice guy who is also a hedonistic pig. We've know THEM too.

ONE of the FIVE stars I'm giving the DVD is for the commentary by Giamatti and Haden Church. Unlike other ""stars"" who seem bored and / or annoyed with the DVD commentary process, they get INTO it, having fun, offering a multitude of inside tidbits, and making it a whole new experience after you've watched the fim. It's probably the most enjoyable DVD commentary I've listened to to date.

The movie is either going to connect with you or it isn't.  I was pleased that I finally saw it.  A friend of mine is planning a wine-tasting trip to everywhere the movie went (which are all real places, I believe--even the Hitching Post).

The cast is outstanding.  The production is top-notch.  But it takes a while to get going.  I don't know if it needed all that set-up to get the characters going but I stuck it out through a dry opening.  Miles, the Paul Giammatti character, nearly loses me right off the bat.  Okay, he's a frustrated writer who isn't going anywhere (I just watched WE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE and that was about TWO frustrated writer/teachers who didn't go anywhere).  Fine.  But when he steals money from his mother...how do you get ""lovable loser"" back after that?  Misstep or really revealing character flaw?  That's up to each viewer.

His hopeless behavior with women and then adding alcohol to unleash darker rages didn't help either.  He is such a loser by the midpoint that, instead of seeing him pull it together and win the girl or whatever happy ending you want to tag on this, I wanted to see him pay for his boorish behavior to everyone.

Thankfully, Thomas Haden Church is on hand to goose this movie to life.  His wild, reckless needs give an unpredictable energy to everything.  You don't care so much about what Miles will do next, you wonder what his buddy will get into next!

Its pacing is interminable, its characters stupid, its script (adapted by Payne from Rex Pickett's novel) an interesting if failed attempt at... something. I could never quite figure out what.

Plot: Jack (Wings' Thomas Haden Church) is about to get married, and his friend Miles (Paul Giamatti, recently of The Hawk Is Dying) takes him on the ultimate bachelor party: a week in Napa wine country. There, the two run into Miles' old friend Maya (The Haunting in Connecticut's Virginia Madsen) and her party-girl friend Stephanie (Sandra Oh of Grey's Anatomy). Jack, in the pursuit of getting Miles hooked up with the recently-divorced Maya, finds himself hooked up with Stephanie, which leads to a possible crisis in his future; does he want to marry the safe girlfriend at home, or drop everything and ride off into the sunset with Stephanie? And meanwhile, can Miles grow enough of a spine to finally woo Maya, who's obviously attracted to him? Oh, and I should add that all of these characters (save Jack, who could care less) know far more about wine than you or I ever will, and never let you forget it.

Now, because it's been addressed in a couple of reviews I've read, I'll start off by saying that my problem with these characters is not that they are, in the main, hateful, depraved beasts. I generally love movies with hateful, depraved beasts as characters (viz., for example, The Sweet Smell of Success). No, my problem with these characters is one that literary types know as the golden rule: these characters, with one exception, do not change. And that one exception is not Miles; he's as spineless at the end of the movie as he is in the beginning. (I hope that's not a spoiler.) Unless he feels there's no chance he'll get caught, Miles takes no initiative unless he's prodded to the point where he has no other choice, from the first scene to the last. As Miles is the center of the movie, that he doesn't change is the cardinal sin.

Not that the movie doesn't have other problems. The pacing is constantly undermined by the movie stopping to talk wine. Which, I guess, is fine if you're a wine snob. And yes, I do understand that the wine is being used as a metaphor. I'd find it hard not to; it's constant, heavy-handed, and just as much hammering you with the message as it would be if he just came out with it (as he did, for example, in Election; despite that, Election is by far the better movie. Relatively, of course). I'd say that that makes the movie only worthwhile for wine snobs, but this is obviously not the case, given the number of people who seem to enjoy it. Unless there are a whole lot more wine snobs in America than I think there are.

I was planning on going on, but why bother? I'm sure you can tell where I'm going with this. Terrible movie, only worth watching because Virginia Madsen is, in general, the best thing about any movie she's in. Never has that been more the case than it is here. *",1242950400,14,3268,4.589041095890411
2240014,3,B0007RUSGW,"I have only seen four of Alexander Payne's films: Citizen Ruth, Election, About Schmidt and Sideways. These four irreverent films share a common thread. They are each in their own way a meditation on hopelessness and despair. Payne's gift, or rather his forte, is to coat most of this misery with a black comic enamel. They are mostly all character-driven stories with what can only be described as 'sometimes-lovable-losers' at the helm.

In Citizen Ruth it's Laura Dern as poor ""Ruth Stoops"" the glue-sniffing titular anti-heroine; in Election it's Matthew Broderick's poor ""Mr. McAllister"" who engages in some highly questionable personal and professional affairs including adultery, student council election rigging and revenge among other things; in About Schmidt it's Jack Nicholson's poor ""Warren Schmidt"" who must come to terms with a life of failed relationships and a future just as worse; and now it's Paul Giamatti (arguably the biggest loser of them all) who portrays poor ""Miles"" in Sideways as a wounded man who lives in his own little world but soon finds himself on a precipice and is given the chance to stay put or transform into something more.

Like all of these interesting and inventive characters, Miles' journey is not an easy one. There are plenty of set-backs, obstacles, awkward sexual encounters and most of all demons that he must face. Miles seems to like his demons however, or at least he's gotten used to them. I wish we could have learned more about this man other than what he knows about wine and how he responds to his gregarious friend and horny road-trip mate. The only problem I have with Payne's major body of work is -- they are all essentially the same character on the same quest. What makes each of these movies interesting is not necessarily the constant personal misery that the main characters face (or rather resist facing until the end) but the supporting players along for the ride.

In Sideways, it's Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen (both nominated for Academy Awards for this film). Church's ""Jack"" is a mixed bag. He's equally engaging and completely revolting. It's no wonder for he plays a spoiled playboy and soap opera actor in this. He is a delight to watch. He is also perhaps the only character in the film who knows exactly who he is as a person even though he never really knows what he wants. Madsen plays ""Maya"", the waitress with a heart of gold. What could have been an easily forgettable female protagonist is saved and graced by Madsen with one Oscar-clip moment that in my humble opinion almost elevates the entire film. If you've seen the movie or watched the Oscars you know what scene I'm referring to. There's no tears, no fancy camera tricks, no heightened drama really. It's simply Maya talking about wine (yet so much more). This brief and wonderful moment made the whole film worth watching for me or perhaps it's the one bright thing that I have taken away from this movie and held onto inside.

Sideways is a sometimes-funny film (I think it was supposed to be a comedy) but it tries too hard to be about 'real life' that it seems more movie-real than anything else. There's enough anxiety in this film to make even Woody Allen or Albert Brooks blush a little and the great Paul Giamatti handles most of it with deft aplomb but like all of Payne's miserable losers his character just runs out of steam by the end. I intentionally stayed far away from this one when it first came out. I didn't want the hype (like near-unanimous critical praise and one Academy Award for Payne's adapted screenplay) surrounding it to effect my viewing and potential enjoyment. I'm glad I saw this film (like all of Payne's films) but he really needs to get a new act. I'm starting to think he's cornered the market on movies with pathetic people resisting the urge to change.

In that respect, I feel Citizen Ruth is his best film. Ruth certainly manufacturers her own problems but she's also being exploited by everyone else in the system and there's the difference. It's also his least cloying and most edgy film to date. Ultimately, I wanted Sideways to be better than what it was. It's the greatest movie about the art of appreciating wine that I have ever seen. Sure there's a lot more going on but that's what I found most successful about it. I think Payne might have been reaching for a little more.",1236902400,2,4378,4.74015748031496
2240015,5,B0007RUSGW,"The following describes the tasks performed to prepare for a reviewing of the film and the Blu Ray media format as well...

The ""Sideways"" Blu Ray disc arrived at my house 'on' the day it was released (Amazon obviously obtained their allotment prior to the release date).  But, I had to wait 2 weeks until everyone who was to participate in the viewing could attend.  I do not yet have an HD setup, so one of the attendees' home was appropriated for the event.

Most of the attendees had already seen the film at least once, and many had viewed it both in the theater and on regular DVD (during it's popular sales period, found on end-caps of the grocery store wine aisles).

Since this was to be an HD viewing with the proper sound system attached,  I strove to find a way to further enhance the proper atmosphere and moods for each scene.  To accomplish that feat,  I provided various types and qualities of wines to pair with the sequence of events throughout the film.

There was of course much feasting prior to the start of the film, with snakkies consisting of smoked salmon, triple-cream brie, green grapes, and a variety of crackers.

The wine selection started with what I thought would present a 'cheap' bland beverage, to accompany the visit to Mile's mothers home, but it turned out to be an excellent wine (2007 Gruner VELTLINER , pronounced with heavy German accent).  Who would've thought that an $8 bottle of white wine, contained in what appears to be a green Tanqueray Gin bottle with a beer cap top, would turn out to be a favorite of the evening... (is there a hidden message in there somewhere ?)

Once the evening and the film moved along,  the wines progressed into the red variety,  with Pinot Noir's presented at the appropriate moment, as well as (ironically) Merlot, just when it was stated that there shouldn't be any...

At the end (when the C****l B***c is imbibed) I served a 2002 ""Sarah's Blend"" by the 'original' Marquis Phillips vineyard (a wine which represents one which 'I' take out for special occasions).

Once the film viewing was completed, and several of the attendees had passed-out,  I was able to contemplate the quality of the film and the new HD format it was presented in...

The film ""Sideways"" itself, has already been reviewed by viewers extensively, with 'half' praising it, and the other denouncing it as either 'trash', 'boring' (no light sabers), or 'making no sense'.  I would not argue with any of the points of view, since I've come to realize, that the movie as a whole, is itself an allegory to wine.  No two people will get the same appreciation, perception, flavor, etc from a particular wine, and this film can be interpreted in so many ways, that everyone comes away with a different perspective as to the quality of the movie, as well as what the storyline really was...

There are people who just do not like wine, and those who will just not like this film.  Those that enjoy 'sweet', light, critter-labeled, wines, and may only see what's presented 'on the surface' in the movie, and those that taste something different in the same wine every time they serve it, and see a different aspect of the story every time they view the film.  I myself thought the whole ""Merlot"" scene was a slight at that variety of wine,  but now (after getting hints from other film reviews) see that it was just another allegory for a character in the movie (I won't reveal who).  The more you watch ""Sideways"", the more you understand, and see how the nuances of the dialogue are like those of wine, which change as your pallet learns to discern them.  Those who do not like the movie, probably never will.  For those who think highly of the film, they will always find enjoyment from watching it again (especially with snakkies and wine).

The only 'gripe' from those that complain about the movie, that I can understand, is that it is marketed and hinted-at to be an extreme comedy.  Obviously this is not so..  I find the film to be very sad at times, with a general malange that mirrors Miles' general state of mind.  There are 'cringe factor' moments and a non-glossing-over of the character's faults or actions, which, along with the attire of the characters, creates a realism which makes you believe that 'you' could be driving down route 101 through that region, and pass them walking along the road (heading to or from the hitching post).

As for the Blu Ray format of the film...  I was expecting better.  Being a recent production,  I had hoped that it was filmed in digital format from the start (was it ?), which should transfer to HD easily.  Though the picture was clean, the only moment that it stood out was during the scene (with the gum) where both Miles and Jack hold up their wine glasses (at an angle to check for the water layer on the surface).  I was able to judge the clarity, color and the water layer from my seat which was the furthest from the screen (10 feet from a 50"" LCD).  I've always felt that the quality of an HD video, as well as the equipment used to display it, was best illustrated by 'glass', 'liquid', and 'reflections'.  The scene with the glasses held aloft had all three elements in view, and I could find no flaws.

Needless to say, I had been drinking while viewing the film, which must be taken into consideration.  I intend to watch it again (like many fans of the movie) with my soon-to-be superior HD environment, and will compare the Blu Ray release to the 'standard' DVD (which will be played in a 1080P uplifting drive).

Perhaps I will then see yet another nuance to the film, or figure out why Miles doesn't like 'manipulated' Chardonnay's (I 'do').",1236124800,7,5658,4.583499005964215

""Sideways"" is one of those movies that seems to be made entirely for the scholarly and intellectual. The artsy, deep, hip and high-brow. Films about those people going through a turning point in their lives. Mid-life crisis's and the like. And ones like this in paticular always seem to reap critical praise, a crowd of feverent fans and prestigious award nominations.

""Sideways"" strangely has one of those cool quirky titles that sounds really hip and grabs your attention. You know, it'll be an edgy movie. Like ""Entourage,"" ""Purgatory,"" ""Angel Eyes"" and the like. Something about ""Sideways"" says it's going to be different. Smarter. Sharper. In a word, better.

But unlike the title for the Johnny Depp-Winona Ryder vehicle ""Finding Neverland,"" this one doesn't pretty much reveal the whole movie in with it's title. ""Sideways"" is about something--more than just moving in a different direction.

""Sideways"" uses wine and wine country as a backdrop, yes, but the movie is about more than just the symbolism of wine and it's drinkers. It's essentially about people who are connected and realize how hard, brief and fragile life itself is and pursue happiness by any means necessary. And they're so true and worthy of it, we want them to find it and thus, assure we will find it ourselves. It has the mixed feeling of life.

It's stars, Miles Richmond and Jack Lopate have been buddy-buddy since their college dorm years. And have always been (and will be) total polar opposites. Miles is just a sad-sack neurotic nebbish with a bundle of neuroses that seem unwilling to disappear no matter how much therapy or medication he can get his hands on. His book won't get sold, his ex-wife is remarried (not that Miles was happy with her), he seems to be closer to death than life and he hasn't made an iota of the impact he wanted to.

Jack's a less-than-successful actor who's most respected credit was a short-lived role on a soap opera years ago. Now his more recent stuff is the voice-over who mumbles the warning for the side effects from non-prescription meds near the end of the commercial. Jack is living an ideal life otherwise and Miles has seen better days. In fact, he's borderline suicidal--taking plenty of meds and alcohol himself, usually all at once. Jack is about to get married. He wants to go out to local wine country and bring Miles with him, and hopefully out of his funk.

Miles thinks and feels too much. He's been borderline suicidal for a while now and it's only getting worse. He was unhappy during his marriage which led to him giving his wife the perfect reason to end.

Jack is a self-satisfied animal who enjoys giving in to his baser animal instincts. Jack doesn't give so much as a damn about wine that's ""just right."" He only wants a drink. And the movie illustrates how that's exactly who he is. A total tomcat who enjoys being ""on the edge"" and flirting with danger, he sort of enjoys toeing the line. The most outrageous thing about Jack is he often gets off lighter than he should. We all root for Miles and idolize Jack.

Maybe a trip out to wine country is just what Miles needs. We all know some big things are about to happen over the course of this one week.

One of Miles' true passions that does bring him happiness in wine. The right wine. And with great wine, you have to know what you're talking about. You treat it as an art, as yourself. It's not like any other drug. It becomes a way of like, not only as art and a way of life, but as a way of who you are.

Paul Giamatti is simply an actor who never ceases to amaze me. From his breakthrough role as the anal-retentive watchdog station manager in ""Private Parts"" (he was one of the bigger surprises in that movie. The fact that he was passed over for an Oscar nod for this one (as well as ""American Splendor"" and ""Cinderella Man"") borderlines on criminal. On felony.

Thomas Hayden Church, who was pretty much just vaguely remembered for his stock idiot second-banana comic relief mechanic character the on the one of the world's most generic sit-com, simply rivets here. He's eons ahead of Lowell and ""Wings.""

As Jack, he has the charm of a stud who's about to peak, but doesn't realize and doesn't care. A serial philanderer, he is literally willing to cheat on his fiance without second thought or guilt right before the wedding. He has a womanizer charm that doesn't seem lecherous or arrogant. We don't mind him cheating. In fact, we encourage it. Let's see where his libido might lead him. To pleasure, now, yes. But we all know it'll lead him into a hornet's nest eventually. And we're anxious to see how.

When the arrive at their destination, two women come into the picture. A waitress, Maya (Virgina Madsen) and a hostess, (Sandra Oh) come into the picture. We know they're the ones who are going to put everything into play.

Sandra Oh, writer-director Payne's then-wife, moves us in a big way as one of the wine hostess who falls for Jack and his animal way. They wind up having a fast relationship and one of the most surprising moments comes when Miles realizes how fast their relationship is going. We know Jack is sticking his pride and joy into a hornet's nest and we want him to, because we know he'll have a blast and we'll do the same just watching. She isn't just a hottie, she has a wild spirit we'd all want to get into.

And Virgina Madsen (""The Rainmaker"") plays the kind of angel from above here on Earth, walking as a mortal that Miles seems to have been praying for. And when she's on screen, we all feel that Miles may be finally saved. And is there a chance someone like her will rush down at save us when we really need it?

The film owes a lot to the works of Albert Brooks of Woody Allen, where the most effective comedy and drama comes the ordinary plight of the human condition. It's the kind of movie where  you keep thinking, ""Yeah, this is life. This is so exactly true to life... right down to every last detail.""

Co-writer-director Alexander Payne (""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"") along with co-writer Rex Pickett (from his own novel) have fashioned their screenplay in a natural true-to-life way all about the fascination of human nature. The ways of ordinary life--laughter, anger, frustration and brain candy--all translate to a cathartic experience for it's little characters as well as it' audience. Composer Rolfe Kent gives ""Sideways"" a light, loose jazzy score. Sometimes rocking. Not unlike the works of Ryan Shore. And Payne not only directs beautifully and passionately, but manages to get the right feel in every frame. We even identify with his slapstick scenes.

Like most of the population who saw ""Sideways,"" I was relieved to see that the screenplay managed to walk off with nearly every honor for writing there was: The Oscar, the British Academy Award, the Golden Globe, the Independent Spirit Award, the New York Film Critic Circle Award. And it's cast got it's props as well. Speaking as someone who saw this movie as well as others that came out for '04, yeah.

One of those rare and precious years where the Academy actually got it right.

NOTE: This review is dedicated in loving memory to my grandfather, Arthur Benzie. He had a lot of Miles in him. A schoolteacher with a passion for the written word--especially the well-written word. Life was harder than for him than most and he always seemed frustrated that society was doing it's best to become intellectually sterile and eager to turn back mankind's long evolutionary process as quickly as possible.

It all got to him in a big way. Like Miles, he had a deep passion, an insight. For the highbrow and the savory. The man always appreciated a good drink. And needed it more than he really should have.

2240017,5,B0007RUSGW,"This has become one of my all-time favourite films. I have caught myself watching it a couple of times a year on DVD since I saw it theatrically and even bought Rolfe Kent's superb soundtrack to liven up my Cheval Blanc and hamburgers too. The self-deprecating commentary track alone is worth the price of the disc. It's just like listening to Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church in the film - it must be the funniest and most entertaining commentary track I've heard in years. The transfer is identical to the theatrical experience; the whole film is shot with a soft filter in front of the lens, but the film grain is visible and there is none of that digital noise reduction nonsense. The audio is pretty similar to the DVD, which was very good. I suppose Fox could've thrown in a theatrical trailer but they've ported over the deleted scenes and rather vapid featurette from the DVD. The film was such a low profile, low budget production; I don't think the producers thought to make more extensive supplements for posterity.

1. Everybody is different (thank God), and, thus, everyone will see things differently.
2. Please try to stress that your review is your opinion and not unimpeachable truth.
3. If you're bored, you're boring.
4. Miles desperately wants to get a book published and to get a woman in his life. Jack, well, he has a ""plight"" that is insufferable and possibly irredeemable, but clearly suffers from it. These are interesting characters with a lot at stake. Which makes for a great story not involving explosions or ghosts. In my opinion.
5. If you find it pretentious or too intellectual or too clever, you are simply lashing out because you don't understand, and that threatens you somehow. Which is okay. Calm down. Breathe. See number 1 above.
6. Hype is a problem. Don't ever believe it. Ask around first. Ask people who aren't just like you so that you may get a different perspective.
7. The worst ""review"" is the one which cannot separate the film from the characters' action and/or the subject matter. If you abhor the subject matter or the characters, this does not mean it is a poor film. Who liked Humbert Humbert in Lolita? Anyone? Pretty good book though, eh?",1231459200,3,1294,4.700440528634362
2240022,5,B0007RUSGW,"The Bottom Line:

One of the more successful blends of laughs and pathos to come out of Hollywood in the last few years, Sideways lures viewers in with its (very funny) comedy and leaves them with its suprisingly-moving drama",1229472000,,225,4.769230769230769
2240023,5,B0007RUSGW,"The characters in this movie demonstrate drinking, smoking, taking drugs (prescription) and promiscuity.  I do none of these things, and after watching this movie I would be in no hurry to start.

I enjoyed the acting.  I loved how the actors - all of them - portrayed their individual characters.  I loved listening to the way they spoke their lines and timed their facial expressions:  Outstanding talent.

A similar movie could be made without the excessive drinking and without the other ""bad habits"" and it would be a better film for many people.  These 'depravities' were not the reasons why the movie succeeded.  In fact, many will have to ""suffer indignities"" in order to appreciate the underlying humor.

Watching the characters act in group settings, and then alone or in one-on-one settings, was the foundation of the humor.  The contrast between how polite, charming and intelligent the characters strove to be when in the company of others, and their genuine thoughts and feelings apart from any company was amusing, to me.

I loved Virginia Madsen and her portrayal of ""Maya.""  Maya's interest in Miles seems to be a fantasy of the author - the real-life Miles.  But I sure enjoyed Virginia Madsen's portrayal of a remarkable woman showing interest in a rather pathetic man (and no, I'm not that either).

Scenes with the female characters apart from the male characters (showing the same contrast mentioned above) would have improved the movie.",1225670400,2,1459,5.0
2240024,4,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways was a 2004 sleeper comedy hit by director Alexander Payne that really deserved its plaudits. He previously made the funny Reese Witherspoon comedy Election and the so-so Jack Nicholson film About Schmidt. The film's title comes from the proper way to store a bottle of wine, as well the angle a drunk sees the world from when he's recovering from passing out on the floor. While not a particularly deep film, and at two hours and four minutes in length it is about a half an hour too long, the film nonetheless does provide some insights into male insecurities and mid-life crises, as it celebrates human foibles in an intelligent manner. It was adapted by Payne and Jim Taylor from an unpublished novel by a writer named Rex Pickett, and won a well deserved Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.
  The film follows in a long tradition of buddy comedies, from the silent era, wherein one guy is a good fellow, and the other is his ne'er do well pal. Basically, a week before the bad pal, his ex-college roommate, Jack (Thomas Haden Church), a failed actor, is to get married, his good pal, Miles (Paul Giamatti), a divorced school teacher of English, and an aspiring novelist, plans to take him on a week's getaway to the California wine country, to relax and play golf.... the film is a ray of hope for viewers who want intelligent films, especially comedies, from someone not named Woody Allen. Payne was quoted as saying, in an online interview: `I want Sideways, which has no movie stars in it, and a movie for which I had final cut, to make money, not just for my own career but for other film makers so that film makers and studios can point, if I didn't have stars to make money, Sideways didn't have a gun or a chase even though that made money, we have to be changing our cinema, little by little and have more human films. But the only way it's going to happen is there are examples they can point to, where they made money. It was just like that in the late 60s and 70s. Look, Easy Rider made money, The Graduate made money, Midnight Cowboy made money, and we should make more movies like those. That's what we need.'
  He's right, of course. Here's hoping that he has a long career of such hits as Sideways, but that he only gets better with each succeeding film.",1221696000,,2281,4.489156626506024
2240025,4,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways is a buddy movie about two flawed buddies who go off on a wine-tasting adventure in lieu of a bachelor party. The story is more melancholic than comic as the buddies each bump up against their disappointments and failures.
There are lots of reasons to watch this film. The acting is masterful, Sandra Oh is delectable and the scenery is-for most of us-a delight. What sets this movie up for a special place in my heart is one great wine joke.

There's a scene in the beginning where Miles (Paul Giamatti) carries on at some length about Merlot and his dislike of it. It's a rant that I've seen imitated a few times. At the very end of the movie, Miles decides to drink the one great bottle of wine that he's been saving for ' a special occasion'. He's depressed at the time (Miles is depressed a lot) and so he takes it to a fast food joint and drinks it with a Wiftyburger or whatever they call 'em. As he pulls the wine out of the bag, we get a quick peek at the label. It's a fabled Bordeaux called Cheval Blanc.

2240026,5,B0007RUSGW,"What a marvelous film. The latest, brilliant work from director Alexander Payne, who once again finds the empty, lonely heart at the center of so much American life. I have watched it many times, and still find wonderful things in the performances of Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh (Mrs Payne at the time the film was made).

All the characters in Payne films share the prospect of being trapped in shallow roles and jobs they have accepted in suburban American life. They yearn to, if only for a second, or a weekend, escape from or rise above the tedium of their existence. It's no accident of course that his most memorable protagonists have included middle school teachers (Election and Sideways) and an insurance company drone (About Schmidt).

To the reviewer who wrote:

""I felt such raw hate for it that I had to buy it - 1) because it elicited such strong disgust and abject hatred and 2) because I am happy to have found a movie that perfectly exemplifies just how terrible, inferior, and worthless a movie can possibly be.""

They are spending a week in the California wine country before one of them marries, but this groom lacks a certain fidelity. Both men seemed self-centered, boorish. At first I thought ""Who cares?"" But the film picked up and turned into a powerful portrait of the costs of friendship and the nature of hope. I think the two friends and the women they encounter are types of people that we all know. It captures the angst generated by failure and the resultant rejection. ""Nobody wants you when you're down and out."" There's an effective blend of pathos and humor. At first rather flat, it turned into a heady brew.",1215129600,,767,4.647058823529412

It's filled with amazing dialogue and alot of really funny moments.  I would recommend this film to anyone who likes substance and realism without the overblown characterisms and plots usually found in Hollywood films.",1214438400,2,673,4.826086956521739
2240029,4,B0007RUSGW,"I just finished watching this film and admittedly was very hesitant too watch it in the first place. Having said that, I finely decided to rent it and take a look at the hype. I must said I was pleasantly surprised, and found it to be a highly intellectual film.

I do think that this film might be lost on non creative working people. Meaning if you have not been involved in the arts, acting, writing novels, photography, painting, dancing.......then you may not understand the struggles of the two main characters. Those two guys remind me so much of the type of people you meet in the world of the Arts. Meaning that the highs are high and the lows are low. Most of them are selfish and very weak people, as we will see with the two main characters.

 I found 80% of the script to be spot on, and very realistic. The subject of wine was actually interesting, and I find wine info to be about as exciting as watching paint dry. But this storyteller did an outstanding job. There are moments where the dialogue is outstanding. When actress Virginia Madsen talks about why she got into wine, I was blown away. Very intense and impressive performance. However he and Giamatti being a pair just does not strike me as real. Ok, well it takes place in California so anything is possible!

What I find to be most impressive about this movie, is the fact that it is an accurate portrait of life in general. It just so happens that a wild number of things occur in a few days in the film. But if you stretch that out in your own life, you'll find that we all go through things like this. So the message to me if you find this film confusing is to really ""look before you leap,"" in the decisions you make with your life.

I do not consider this film to be a comedy, it has funny moments to be sure. I consider it a drama, that is very serious. I do not wish to refer to it as a chick flick, but there are moments when it comes close. I think I would call it a life lesson film. So if you want insight into your own life and how to relate that to others, then I think this film might offer you a gaze into that world.",1214352000,,2109,4.184729064039409

Miles (Paul Giamatti) is the guy that just can't seem to win. He is something of a middle aged Charlie Brown. He is in what appears to be an unfulfilling career as a school teacher and he has recently gotten divorced. Miles last hope for redemption in life is that his novel will get published which is currently being shopped around by his agent. Miles can't worry about that now though because his best friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) is about to get married and Miles plans to take Jack out to wine country as a sort of one on one bachelor party. Miles has plans of a week long low key male bonding trip but Jack has different plans. Jack envisions a week of chasing women and cutting loose and the contrasting bachelor party ideas collide as the two head out to wine country...

""Sideways"" is not for everyone but I loved this movie. Although classified as a comedy I think of this as more of a character examination movie. Sideways is a character driven movie and is primarily about Miles as he attempts to deal with the shambles he feels his life has become while at the same time trying to be a gracious host to Jack as Jack stomps all over Miles plans for their week in wine Country. As you watch you see Miles go through an emotional roller coaster ride as he deals with Jack who is almost his polar opposite, tries to get over his ex wife and looks for something positive to hope for in the future as he indulges in the last thing he truly enjoys which is drinking good wine.

The Good: The acting all around was great. Paul Giamatti was absolutely perfect for the Miles character and Thomas Haden Church was a perfect to play off of Gimatti's Miles and the character dynamic between the 2 was great. You can't help but to pull for Miles as runs into one pitfall after another usually created by Jack.

The score for this movie was superbly done. The music perfectly accents Miles and his moods and feelings. With the combination of Gimatti's acting and the score I felt like I knew exactly what was going on in Miles' head.

The Bad: Nothing memorable.

Overall: This is not for everyone so be warned. This is not an overtly funny movie even though it is labeled as a comedy. If you want to watch a movie about interesting characters and don't require big explosions or slap stick comedy then pick up Sideways and give it a try.",1210896000,7,2569,4.685144124168515
2240034,5,B0007RUSGW,"I don't know why such a large amount of people don't like this movie.  I guess it's not for everyone.  I'm tempted to say, ""If you don't like this, you're an idiot!""... but I can't say that... I guess.

This movie is slow, but well-paced, and I think to get the most of it you have to be able to identify with Miles (Giamatti), because this is his story.  If you're like Jack (Church) - completely happy and carefree, fun, superficial, shallow and immoral - you probably won't get the movie.  But if you're like Miles and you've struggled with off-the-beaten-path ambitions, anxiety, heartbreak, sexual frustration, etc., you're at the center of this comedy and you can really appreciate how it seems to ""nail"" the subtleties of life in such a lighthearted, humorous way.  It's a pleasure to see the contrast between the complicated, depressed Miles, and the simple, happy Jack.  I'm not sure Sideways is a movie that women will really appreciate, even though there are significant female roles... they're just more of a backdrop for the Miles and Jack characters and their dysfunctional ""buddy"" adventure.

The scene where Miles summons the nerve to get out of bed and visit Mia at the Hitching Post, ends up ordering an entire bottle of wine, finds out she's not working, drinks the whole bottle by himself, stumbles home tanked?  GENIUS.",1208908800,2,1340,4.816593886462882
2240035,1,B0007RUSGW,"Review updated: 3/7/09

I'm going to start off by saying I absolutely hated this movie. In fact, I turned it off midway through because the characters were chatting it up in a restaurant and the dialogue was so contrived (and yet realistic) that, had these been actual people in a restaurant I was eating in, I would have probably turned around and told them to shut up. The characters were as annoying as that one guy we all have encountered on the metro or in a bookstore who answers his cell-phone and talks at full volume, earning ""I will kill you"" looks from everyone around him. But because I am a glutton for eternal punishment I turned the movie back on and finished it a few hours later and all I can say is I called this movie from the very beginning as being something only the 40+ crowd could possibly enjoy. Let's put it this way: Everyone I know has never seen it...but their parents own it and have given it out as Christmas gifts for more poor, unsuspecting souls. I really tried to like this movie, even going so far as to appreciating just how dark and deep this movie seems to get 1/3 of the way through - until it tanks miserably and I can finally conclude that I absolutely hated all of the characters in the end and didn't sympathize with any of their situations. Seriously, when you have a one night stand do you honestly think that person loves you and wants to be with you for the rest of your life, and would make an awesome father figure for your 5 yr old son??? Apparently the character Stephanie thinks so! What the eff???? Sideways had so much potential to me before I viewed it and the hype behind it made it appear as a kitschy wacky movie for wine lovers...it wasn't of any of those things. It just straight up SUCKED.",1207872000,6,1751,4.3547400611620795

If your into wine you'll love sideways, unless of course your a merlot drinker. If your sick of slap stick immature humor then sideways is your best bet.

The premise of this 2004 film sounds flimsy on the surface - two guys, one about to get married, take a week-long trip through the Santa Barbara wine country as a last hurrah celebration filled with fine wine, good food and golf. But the execution of this plot is full of shrewd observations and so many delightfully unexpected scenes that seem like non-sequiturs at first but somehow mesh into a story that keeps you guessing what will come next. It's a fascinating journey, often hysterical, sometimes painful, about lost opportunities and facing one's deep-seeded fears.

The characters are familiar and unpredictable at the same time, and the actors inhabiting them are terrific. In a relatively understated, finely detailed performance, Paul Giamatti provides the emotional core of the story as put-upon, unrelentingly dissatisfied Miles, the pinot wine aficionado so caught up in his passion for the grape he has no idea how pretentious he sounds. His character's aching, post-divorce vulnerability and decreased sense of worth wring truthfully through his hound dog expressions, excessive drinking and pained fits of anger. A failing novelist and quite likely an alcoholic, Miles hides behind his extensive wine knowledge to avoid getting hurt again even when confronted by a beautiful woman open to the possibility of starting a relationship with him. After years of medium-level success in TV sitcoms, Thomas Haden Church makes the ideal comic foil as Jack, a has-been soap star and self-proclaimed ladies' man who is not nearly ready to face commitment at the altar.

The two actors have an easy and sometimes tense rapport as best friends with opposite approaches to life but a strong sense of devotion to each other. Their wine tasting scenes with a liberal use of jargon, in particular, are hilarious in that only-in-California sort of way. Of course, women complicate the journey. Sandra Oh shows surprising female swagger as wine pourer Stephanie, who blindly falls for all of Jack's lines. And it's gratifying to see Virginia Madsen make the most of a good role. This beautiful, searingly intelligent actress had been kicking around bad potboilers and horror flicks for over two decades, and it's about time someone saved her from Lifetime TV-movie hell. She plays the smart, wine-worshipping waitress Maya with lovely subtlety and has a wonderfully transfixing, wine-as-life monologue that makes Miles look all the more foolish for not capitalizing on the moment.

But like a wine that peaks and fades, as she seductively describes, so does Miles in fits of depression that make his search for love and fulfillment an evasive proposition at best. The 2005 DVD package provides a wonderfully hilarious commentary track courtesy of the improvisational wit of Giamatti and especially Church, who seems to be a treasure trove of erudite trivia. Make sure to have the English subtitle feature on as they talk non-stop over the film. Their natural chemistry is unforced off-screen. Eight deleted scenes are included with Payne's written descriptions of what function they served and why they were ultimate excised. My favorite is a side trip to the mall to shop for a pair of sporty sneakers for Miles. There is a brief making-of featurette, totally dispensable, and the original theatrical trailer.",1206403200,4,4222,6.1525423728813555
2240038,3,B0007RUSGW,"Long before this movie appeared, I was into visiting vineyards around the country during my frequent travels. And because the Central Coast of California is one of my favorite wine regions, it is no surprise that I easily succumbed to all the hype surrounding this film. Unfortunately, it does not live up to its hype at all. Oh, there is lots of wine, but there is far more ""whine"" as well.
The first time I saw this a couple of years ago, I thought it was interesting. Last night, I put it on again while swilling some great Barbera to see if I could find anything I missed. Well, not really. The two protagonists are absolutely insufferable. I could not stand to spend another hour with either one of them. On one hand, you have the hang-dog Miles, a whiny schoolteacher who fancies himself a budding author, and on the other you have his unlikely friend Jack, a third-rate actor who fancies himself a ladies' man. The combination, far from being amusing, is often cringe-inducing.
Another duality is that Miles is well-versed in wine lingo but has no clue about women, while Jack doesn't have a clue about wine but is willing to go along with whatever any pretty woman has to say about whatever is being poured at the moment if it advances his agenda with her.
The movie is probably better for people who have actually been to Los Olivos, Buellton and Solvang. They can appreciate the scenery more and possibly recognize local landmarks such as the Hitchin' Post restaurant (Jocko's in nearby Nipomo is better) that is featured prominently in the film.
You'll see that the story is really carried by the main female characters though I could never figure out what the attractive and intelligent Maya saw in a pitiful, snivelling loser like Miles. Then there is the beautiful and flirtatious Stephanie, winningly portayed by Sandra Oh, who at least comes away with her dignity intact after her dalliance with and subsequent revenge on the smarmy Jack.
Overall, it wasn't a bad movie. It probably would have been better had the male leads been more likeable. We are supposed to feel sorry for a guy who steals money from his mother and another one who thinks the world revolves around him? Probably the best part is that the wine novice can actually learn SOMETHING about wine while smirking at some of the wine world's sillier affectations.",1202688000,5,2343,4.717073170731707
2240039,4,B0007RUSGW,"Alexander Payne is the young wunderkind director of this terrific dramedy, He is the proud director of CITIZEN RUTH (1996), ELECTION (1999), and ABOUT SCHMIDT (2002). He is also a terrific writer, and he shared those honors with his often used collaborator Jim Taylor; who also has directed a couple of Indie films. It is based on the best-selling novel by Rex Pickett, who prior to this was considered a film script writer; and who also has directed a movie; HOLLYWOOD TO DEADWOOD (1989).

Rarely has a novel transferred so seamlessly to the screen. Roger Ebert wrote,""Payne finds plots that service his characters, instead of limiting them."" Payne has a terrific eye for his casting as well. Ebert wrote further,"" He chooses actors who will prevent you from ever being able to imagine anyone else in the role.""

One critic wrote,"" This is a film about wine and whine."" Two old college buddies decide on a bachelor party adventure. Jack, a middle-aged actor clinging to the last of his looks, and delegated to voice overs on commercials, is getting married. His buddy, Miles, a dumpy depressed Junior High English teacher, still stunned after two years from his divorce, sets them off to northern California, near San Luis Obispo, to take a wine tour of some of his favorite vineyards. It is the story of faded youth and faded potential.

It is a comedy with dramatic moments. It is a drama with laughs in it. It is both tragic farce, mixing Commedia absurdity with John Steinbeck scenarios, and slapstick situational comedy, mixing belly laughs with geniune heart-touching moments. Miles has envisioned a halcyon week of wine tasting, stimulating conversations, and some winner hangovers. Jack has envisioned a series of hustles giving him a chance to score heatedly before the finality of his upcoming nuptials. Enter two incredible women, one a waitress going to night school, and one a counter pour-girl at a local winery who is a single mother. They are very well written characters, and these women appear real and fresh and sexy and complicated.

Paul Giamatti is Miles. He is a fine character actor with a theatre background who has been delegated to a score of lightweight comedies, punctuated by good work in DONNIE BRASCO (1997), MAN IN THE MOON (1999), and a star-turn as Harvey Pekar in AMERICAN SPLENDOR (2003). SIDEWAYS is his best work to date. He did not receive a Golden Globe, though nominated. Perhaps Oscar will be kinder. Thomas Haden Church played Jack. This film was his breakthrough role. Most of his films, and TV work over the last twenty years has been less than classic in stature. The lovely Virginia Madsen played Maya, the fetching waitress. Payne coaxed her very best performance to date onto the screen. She is stunning, vulnurable, and beautiful to her core. A scene she has with Miles, where they sit quietly discussing wine, is one of the most heartwarming scenes in any film this year. Sandra Oh, Payne's real-life wife, played Stephanie, and she had a red hot passionate presence; like a cat in heat. She was sexy and intelligent and geniunely a free spirit; but when betrayed her wrath was astonishing.

One does not have to be an oenophile to appreciate the lovely and accurate education in wine tasting that was received along with all the other goodies in this movie. This film is easily the best American comedy of 2004. It deserves every accolade and award it can garner. I adored this film.

What will offend your sensibilities even more is that neither of these losers is punished for their weaknesses and subsequent transgressions.

2240046,4,B0007RUSGW,"I liked Sideways for many reasons, but mostly because the characters were very believable and honest to me. I have read critics say they were upset about the undeserving happy ending. I'm not sure what movie they were watching but a happy ending is not the conclusion I drew at all. At best, it is a vague and open-ended conclusion. The only thing we might infer is that Miles, as played by Paul Giamatti in what should have been an Oscar winning performance, finally begins to realize that he is a worthwhile person and that he has made peace with his divorce and begun the slow move forward. When he opens the forty year old bottle of wine he had been saving for the ""right moment with the right person,"" and drinks it alone, I knew that his character had stopped the self-loathing that had eaten away at his happiness, his confidence, and his self-esteem. He was the right person and that was a powerful statement.
As for his sexually compulsive acquaintance, the mere fact that he managed to get away with his debauched and troubling week of infidelity and cruel behavior does not mean that he got the happy ending. Without any sense of the kind of self-actualization Miles went through, this shallow and most likely self-hating person is doomed to continue his need for self-value via sexual conquests until his marriage is ruined or he has the chance to find out the root of his self-destructive behavior. The grin he flashes Miles as he is getting married is all I need to know that there was no epiphany in his tearful plea to Miles at the motel. His future looks far from happy to me.
The women both seemed to be far ahead of their male counterparts. Maya, the perfect compliment to the needy and delicate Miles, has already re-directed her life after her deceit-filled marriage ended and it is her steadfastness and her new-found confidence and independence that allow her to re-connect with Miles and give him the benefit of a second chance. The scene between Miles and Maya in which they describe their love of wine is one of the most eloquent I have seen in a movie in a long while.
This is a movie of characters. It is a movie about people who are wounded and far from perfect and yet who battle through the misery that life can be. These characters do things that make you angry and perhaps feel pity for them, but don't we all in the course of our lives? There are indeed no syrupy happy endings to Sideways. There is merely the knock at the door and the uncertainty of what will happen next. If you crave explosions, fast moving plots, blood, gore, puerile humor (all of which I can find quite entertaining!), Sideways is most assuredly not any of those things. It is a quiet movie that takes a wealth of empathy and understanding of the frailties of man to fully appreciate. Calling the characters whiny or saying it is boring means you simply didn't get it. Not everyone will. Not all movies are made for everyone on the planet to enjoy either. I enjoyed Sideways and am glad I bought it.",1198886400,5,3007,4.529411764705882

Neither Giamatti nor Church played likable characters. The best thing in the film is Virginia Madsen, who was other-worldly radiant as the angel of death in ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and is realistically radiant here. I had a lot in common with Giamatti's sad-sack broken-hearted failure, and one of my best friends behaves a like lot Thomas Hayden Church's character. Halfway through the film, I was planning to send my copy on to him to see if he agreed that these men were a lot like us.

And when Miles is talking to Vicki at a wedding near the end, Paul Giamatti does wonders with his expression.

2240056,3,B0007RUSGW,"I rented this film recently, having heard all the Oscar buzz, and was expecting something spectacular, especially considering that I had loved Alexander Payne's previous work, About Schmidt. However, although this is a solid film with many great aspects to it, it wasn't as wonderful as I was expecting.

The plot concerns two men, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Hayden Church). Miles is an aspiring writer working as a junior high school teacher who is Pinot Noir-obsessed and recovering from a not-so-recent divorce. Jack is a former soap opera star who is about to get married in a week. As an extended bachelor party of sorts, Miles decides to take Jack on a trip through California wine country. Miles is a true wine connoisseur, and, following his divorce, wine seems to be the only thing about which he can truly be excited. Jack, on the other hand, can only get excited about the prospect of getting laid one last time before his wedding.

This film effectively has two stars - wine and Paul Giamatti. In this film's best moments, wine is employed as a character. When he discusses wine, Miles speaks as if he's discussing some long-loved, reliable friend.  In the scenes where Miles is alone, drinking, you almost feel as if two actors are on screen, so palpable is Miles's passion.

Miles's favorite wine, Pinot Noir, functions as a metaphor for his own personality. In describing why he loved his ex-wife, he speaks fondly of her palate. When slowly wooing a new potential love, Miles asks her his ultimate getting-to-know-you question - ""Why are you into wine?"" Giamatti inhabits the role of Miles so completely, you wouldn't even call it acting. He is at times melancholy, at others frustrated, at others just plain drunk, and his journey is perfectly, and frequently humorously, set against the lush beauty of California wine country.

Unfortunately, a film that could have been wonderful, especially in the way  Miles was written and portrayed, was tainted by Thomas Hayden Church's Jack. It's not that his character was unlikeable - it was just plain uninteresting. He wants to have one last affair before his wedding. Alright, well, what else is there to him? Ummm.... nothing. That's it. That's all Jack has to offer. His character is simply one-dimensional. It isn't even two-dimensional enough to be considered shallow. Unfortunately, the film wasted precious time on him that could have been spent exploring more of Paul Giamatti's, Virginia Madsen's, and even Sandra Oh's characters.

So, in the end, this film wasn't what I'd call mediocre - rather it had many brilliant moments which were detracted from by the insertion of this one character/actor.

Worth seeing, but I wouldn't buy it.",1187049600,5,2719,4.986754966887418
2240057,3,B0007RUSGW,"Is it me or does Paul Giamatti always deliver? It's fitting that like fine wine, you may have to watch this movie more than once to fully savor its richness. While Giamatti delivers yet another on target performance, it's Virginia Madsen who anchors this film. Her performance opens your mind to the world of wine tasting and how, like tattoos, it's a very personal and individual experience for all of us. Of course, the zany, madcap events of the boys last hoorah helps move things along too. It's funny how relationships shape and direct our lives. Sideways offers so many things to it's audience that it's hard to pin down exactly what makes this film tick but in the end, I think it's about vulnerability and in that respect Sideways delivers.",1186444800,3,748,4.717557251908397

Miles, of course, is too dismayed by hopelessness to receive Maya's good vibrations, while the painfully immature Jack (hilariously played by ""Wings"" veteran Church) has his hands full with feisty beauty Stephanie, clueless that he's soon due to walk down the aisle. Oscar winner Payne has a sure hand in ""Sideways,"" and a unique way of blending comedy and poignant storytelling.",1185321600,2,679,5.238532110091743

2240062,5,B0007RUSGW,"Paul Giamatti should be an Oscar winner, and not for his nominated performance in `Cinderella Man' but for his brilliant turn as Miles in `Sideways', a performance that was evilly snubbed back in 2004.  In `Sideways' Paul Giamatti is so on point, so in tune with Miles that he becomes one of the most relatable and likable characters of that given year.  We travel with Miles not only through the countryside but through life itself and see his values, his fears, his wants and desires.  We understand him as a person and that's very important for the effectiveness of the film.  Thomas Haden Church's character is far from sympathetic and so it rest firmly on Giamatti's shoulders to keep the viewer caring for the film and the people within.  He does so with warmth and depth.

The film follows friends Miles and Jack as they travel the California countryside for a wine tasting extravaganza before Jack gets married the next weekend.  It's supposed to be a vacation filled with wine, golf and male bonding, but thanks to Jack's weak will power Miles ends up spending most his time alone while Jack is out pursuing the attention of single mother Stephanie.  When Miles isn't commiserating over his failed marriage he's slowly but surely forming a bond with Maya, a sweet and gentle bartender who's been on Miles mind for some time.  As their vacation comes to an end and the wedding gets closer Jack must decide how to end his relationship with Stephanie without telling her too much and Miles must find a way to salvage all that's good with his relationship with Maya in the wake of the storm.

Thomas Haden Church, while playing a character that even I couldn't justify, does so with such dire devotion that you can't help but appreciate him.  He's splendid here and well deserved the Oscar nomination.  Virginia Madsen is so luminous as Maya, I just can't help but fall in love with her.  When I first saw the film I couldn't quite understand how she received the Oscar nomination, but after repeated viewings I was able to see the brilliance in her subtlety.  She was fantastic.  Sandra Oh is unfairly ignored when it comes to praising the actors in this film.  She may not be in very many scenes, but her character is fleshed out well for her lack of major screen time.  But in the end this film begins and ends with Paul Giamatti who is just a revelation here.  He's so extraordinary as Miles that his snub for even a nomination is so disgusting to me.  And for who, Clint Eastwood?  He was already going to win the directing Oscar; did he really need an acting nomination?

The film does a wonderful job of showing the strength of true friendship.  Alexander Payne adapted this screenplay brilliantly and directs it with effortless passion and compassion.  I couldn't help but rationalize with Miles mainly because I've had friends like Jack who don't seem to show too much care or concern for your general feelings but in the end you know they love you.  Miles and Jack are so close they cross the line of family and once that happens your friends get away with treating you worse then you'd normally put up with.  We all have our friends we let walk all over us, not because we're weak or spineless but because losing them would be worse than putting up with their quarks.  In the end Jack is a lucky man to have a friend as devoted and forgiving as Miles.

I will mention that, although I rant and rave about this film and truly believe it should have walked away with top honors at the Oscars (especially of the five films nominated) I must admit to being the only person in my family to feel that way.  My wife likes this film, but it's nothing she'd rush to watch a second time (I on the other hand have seen it numerous times) and my parents and siblings found it rather boring.  It all depends on your type of film or your type of humor.  I know this is registered as a comedy, but to me it's more of a drama with some funny scenes.  It's very sad in parts, frustrating in others, dramatic and touching and then, yes, funny.  Miles tantrum where he drinks the wine out of the spit bucket is probably my favorite single scene in the film for it perfectly fuses the dramatic tension and sense of total frustration with pure comedy.  Just know that this may not be your cup of tea, but give it a try before you cast judgment.",1184544000,5,4339,4.500638569604087
2240063,2,B0007RUSGW,"I really want to give this movie a 1 star, but Paul Giamatti in a handful of scenes pulls off a his role quite well (I especially liked his reunion with his ex-wife... well done).  But the script is a repugnant pile of trash.  The characters (there are only two, both male, the women are mere cardboard props on stage simply to interact with the men) are about as uninteresting as one could find.  Their angst is something I had no patience or sympathy for or interest in - very juvenile stuff.  There is only so much you can do in a story with characters who are immature, morally shallow, self-absorbed, alcoholic, slovenly middle-aged men.  The scriptwriters of this story chose to do nothing with them - we leave them as we met them.  Perhaps in comedy the prop of the ""unlikely duo"" can be a source of laughs and lightness when done right, but in this case, the two characters have the most unbelievable of friendships.  Supposedly these two have been friends for many many years, since freshman year of college.  Miles is to be the best man at Jack's wedding.  And yet, it is clear that they don't know each other, don't know how to be with each other, don't know how to act around each other.  It is not even clear that they enjoy each other's company very much.  The only way way Miles could be Jack's best man is if Jack doesn't have any other friends - which, by the way, may be true, since Jack is such a monster of a person; but why would Miles want to be Jack's friend?  I am still trying to figure that one out.

One last comment about the women: it is amazing how one-dimensional the women of this movie are.  Women are, in this movie, those things we men pursue.  Oh, and they don't like it when we are dishonest with them.  And they often have baggage, like these things called ""children"" whose photos appear on refrigerator doors and who are always either asleep in the next room or away at grandma's for the weekend.  And sometimes they can be good conversationalists, indulging us men in the things we care about most and telling us when we need to hear it how amazing we are.  That is about as much character development as the women characters get in this movie.  This is a movie about the men and their ""pains"".  Women are, as I mention above, just stage props for propelling the men's story along.

The acting was excellent.  I don't see the genius that others find in Paul Giamatti, except as perhaps, a modern Woody Allen, the world's greatest ""sad sack."" But Giamatti doesn't have Woody's comedy genius - so I'll have to revise what I just said - Paul Giamatti is the world's greatest sad sack.  Tom Church played a man with absolutely no redeeming characteristics, except perhaps that he has befriended the worlds greatest sad sack.

I thought Virginia Madsen was very good until the scene where she describes her romantic interest in wine.  Then, like other reviewers, I thought she was amazing.  In this movie, I think wine is a metaphor for what can be cheap, pompous and superficial.  Wine experts are usually just trying to impress other people with cheap, self-serving superficiality.  But then ""Maya"" gives us an honest and genuine assessment, reminding us that there is decency and honesty, even in the world of wine.

""Sideways"" very effectively portrayed lives that seemed to be going nowhere but sideways.  And this is the reason, despite all the funny things that happen in this movie, why I think its sad.  The character development in ""Sideways"" is excellent.  As I got to know the characters, I began to empathize with them, so I began to feel bad about the miserable lives they are leading.  Worst of all, was life so miserable for Madsen's magnificent ""Maya"" character that she would find comfort in Giamatti's miserable ""Miles"" character?  Ouch.  And the young woman who actually believed everything she heard from the Tom Church character.  Oh well.  (pun intended).  Basically, these to guys are complete losers.  But because I felt I knew them, I cared for them, and thus, in between the humor, it was painful to watch.

One day, I may watch it again for the humor, which had its moments, like when Giamatti takes the monster hit from the dregs bucket, or Tom Church walking around with the bandage on his nose (which seemed to advertise, I am a loser, a complete loser), or the two people having sex while Giamatti re-steals Church's wallet.  But I'll wait a while.

One star for Virginia Madsen's acting, one star for Giamatti's dance with the dregs bucket, one star for Church's nose bandage, and another star for Virginia Madsen's face.

7/27/08 Update:  Oh no!  (Pun not intended this time.) I just saw Virginia Madsen's ""botox"" commercial!

2240072,5,B0007RUSGW,"Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a wine aficionado, an aspiring writer, and a high school English teacher. He wants to take his friend since college, Jack (Thomas Haden Church), on a wine tour before Jack gets married. Jack is anxious to sow a few wild oats before he gets hitched, and also wants Miles to sow a few of his own, so Miles can get over the depression of his divorce. Jack is a bounder, a bit of a cad, and an aging rake. He is an actor, primarily television, soap operas, and commercials. His career has peaked, though, and he sees marriage as his last chance. But before that ball and chain gets strapped on to his ankle, he manages to hook up with Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and fixes Miles up with Maya (Virginia Madsen). Together they will go on a double date that will take them through deception to ultimate truth, and for Jack and Miles, it will be a lesson in life, betrayal, and a chance for redemption.

Sideways is a great film about 4 humans, each with their own good points and flaws. It was played by 4 actors, each with their own virtues and shortcomings. There was also a writer, who wrote a book that was turned into a screenplay by the director. The director was married to one of the actresses in real life. She was quoted as saying that her favorite rock musician was Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips, because he looked like her husband, Alexander Payne, and she could fantasize that she was married to a rock star. They married shortly before starting the film project, and divorced soon after. In an interview on NPR Sandra Oh said that it was all right working with a spouse, but on the way home from the set each night, they would talk about themselves in the third person. Alexander would say, ""So, was the director being too harsh with you today?"" I am speculating that some of the steamy love scenes might have created a lot of friction, that wasn't being resolved because of their oblique approach to conflict resolution, the third person discussions of themselves, the disguised arguments that must have come off like some kind of passive-aggressive Olympics.

Sandra Oh gave an excellent performance in Sideways. Nowadays she plays Dr Christina Yang on Gray's Anatomy. I used to like the TV show, but the preposterous plots finally got in the way of my enjoyment of the strong characters. I stopped believing in it, I think, after Dr Gray somehow got her hand stuck on a bomb that might go off if she let go, while in the OR next door, another doctor's lover was having brain surgery, and then, they realized that all of the oxygen tubes that ran throughout the hospital would ignite if even a small bomb went off, it would start a chain reaction that would destroy the entire hospital. Puh-lease.

I have been watching Oh work since she made The Diary of Evelyn Lau for Canadian television. Evelyn Lau ran away from home, and became a drug addict, a prostitute, and a poet and a writer. Out of 1,000 young women who auditioned for the role, Oh got the part, and gave a very memorable performance, so I wasn't surprised to see her turn up again in Sideways, and doing Oh so well.

Her character in Sideways is Stephanie, a single mother who works as a bartender in a winery. She is very knowledgeable about wine, and also has a zest for living. Even though she may be a product of the wish fulfillment principle, she was a very real person, who was totally believable. If I met her, I might pinch myself, but there she was.

Virginia Madsen, who played Maya, was also fantastic. Her brother, Michael Madsen, played a cold blooded killer who gleefully sliced off a man's ear while rocking out to Stuck in The Middle with You by Stealer's Wheel in Quentin Tarrentino's Reservoir Dogs. I guess acting talent runs in their family, because she was equally convincing in her role as a wine country waitress studying for her Master's degree in Horticulture (I am surprised that Miles didn't pun ""You can lead a horticulture, but you can't make her think"" at that point). She not only feigned attraction to Miles, but also gave an excellent monologue about how much she loved wine, and how she came to realize that she loved wine.  She was too good to be true, but there she was.

Alexander Payne did a great job of directing. Repeated viewings constantly reward you with new details and insights into how well the story was paced, how the momentum flowed, how little details were juxtaposed to either counterpoint or enhance the main action. The settings were all so well chosen. California, from Los Angeles to the little wine country towns. The wineries, the Wind Mill motel, the golf courses, The Hitching Post restaurant. There seemed to be a bit of a wind mill motif running through it all, as if they were on a quixotic journey, and The Hitching Post was a foreshadowing of Jack's eminent marriage. One scene in a restaurant with elaborately carved woodwork in the faux Danish town of Solvang was reminiscent of Pinocchio and Lampwick before setting off to Pleasure Island. Another scene was filmed in a run down house that had recently been a meth lab, and was left intact, except for a new door that replaced the one the cops busted down. The cinematography was excellent, with colors that were almost pastel, or depending on the mood, dark and foreboding. Payne takes risks, making Miles and Jack do despicable things, daring you to not care about the characters.

Thomas Haden Church has a life that in some ways parallels his character Jack. He is an actor who has appeared in sitcoms, maybe not soap operas, but he was the mechanic Lowell on Wings, and played Ned in Ned and Stacy. Wings wasn't a very good show, but he was someone who really stood out. You just knew that if only he had the right vehicle, he could really shine. Sideways is that vehicle. There are so many great scenes and little touches that make his character come to life. The way he praises the latest draft of Miles' novel, though he obviously hasn't read it. The way he keeps three condoms for himself and gives Miles one when they all end up at Stephanie's after their double date. And then later the next day, takes it back. And for this, he was nominated for an Oscar.

Miles is exasperating and pretentious. As they embark on their journey, they stop off to visit Miles' mother. He steals money from her. How can you care about someone who would do that? He is passionate about wine, especially Pinot Noir, and seems sincere and genuine, but is an alcoholic, or at least using wine to escape from his problems--one of them being excessive drinking. Paul Giamatti is perfectly cast in this role. He has the middle aged paunch, the bald spot, the pretentious bohemian goatee, and a flair for physical comedy. He played Harvey Peckar in American Splendor, and has that quirky, awkward, misfit kind of character down. He can go from funny to sad in 60 seconds. There are lots of great scenes and little touches that make his character come to life, like the way he sprinkles his vocabulary with French, does crossword puzzles from the New York Times in pen, and refuses to drink Merlot, because it is too prosaic, too much the worn out clich.

2240073,5,B0007RUSGW,"Alexander Payne's wonderful, Academy Award winning film, ""Sideways"" is a mixture of two types of comedy genres, the 'road picture' and the 'buddy picture'. Both these genres mesh together perfectly to create both big laughs and some sobering reflections about how people live their lives.

In the film we meet two old friends. First there is Miles (Paul Giamatti) a schlumpy, depressed, middle aged, high school teacher and would-be novelist. He is also a wine connoiseur, who is using his hobby as a cover to get drunk and medicate his depression over his divorce from two years ago. His life is basically stuck in neutral. Then there is Jack (Thomas Haden Church) a handsome but shallow actor, who seems to do most of his thinking with his private parts. His addiction is women and he will say just about anything to get them into bed.

As the film opens, Jack is about to get married. The two middle aged men embark on a ""bachelor's week"", vacation road trip, before the nupitals occur. Miles' plan is to go north from San Diego, visit a number of wineries for ""tastings"", have some good meals and take in a little golf. But Jack has other ideals, which are basically more carnal in nature. In their travels, they meet and pick-up, both Maya (Virginia Madsen) a local waitress (and fellow wine connoisseur) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) a sexy winery employee. Romantic sparks fly and entanglements occur, that produce humor, hidden truths, and self-realizations for the characters.

The Academy Award winning Script (""2005 Best writing, Adapted Screenplay"") by Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor is both witty, funny and emotionally moving. They have created interesting characters, who you just want to listen to and find out more about. The most interesting scenes in the movie don't necessary involve the slapstick humor, but are the parts, where the characters just sit and talk about themselves. In one of the most memorable scenes of the film, Miles is describing Pinot Noir grapes (his favorite) but eventually you realize he's actually talking about himself. Maya's response to his description is just as good. The scene is almost poetic.

The cast in this film is just first rate. Paul Giamatti as the morose, Miles, dosn't just play his part, but inhabits it! The fact that Giamatti wasn't even nominated for an Academy award is mind-boggling. Virginia Madsen (who was nominated) plays the Maya character with a special vitality and sexiness, that the role requires. She makes it believable, that this bright, sexy woman could fall for this sad-sack of a man. Thomas Haden Church (also nomimnated) and Sandra Oh are very funny in their indespensible roles. After seeing these actors you can't imagine anyone else playing these characters.

I also want to mention how much this film does work as a road picture. Most movies of this nature ar either filled with endless highways or national monuments. But in this picture, not only are the characters interesting, but so are their vacation stops. Both the locations and the beautiful cinematography (By Phedon Papamichael) just hold your interest and make wish you were there! (In real life the film locations became tourist hotspots!) Finally, I want to mention the breezy, light jazz sountrack from composer, Rolfe Kent, that unobtrusively adds to the flavor of the film. You will unknowingly be humming along with it. This is a wonderfully, funny and moving film, that has some interesting characters. Highly recommended!",1179792000,3,3476,5.006920415224913
2240074,4,B0007RUSGW,"OK, Look, if you like wine and are not obsessed with being morally and ethically correct, YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.

If you don't like wine, and think your on some kind of higher ground than everyone else when it comes to moral values, then you will hate this movie.

It is that simple.

Personally I like wine and having fun, so my personal opinion is that the movie was great.",1179360000,,378,4.295774647887324
2240075,5,B0007RUSGW,"In the first-hand surveys I've taken, this film, surprisingly, has been more popular with men than women. Women, perhaps influenced by the stalest sort of conventional feminist propaganda, complain that the hero of the film is shown, among other defects, stealing from his own mother, and this without payback. But surely such a narrow response is to miss the point. Miles (Paul Giamatti) may wind up the ultimate hero, but the film shows his growth, not his initial perfection. At the start, he's no more than an incipient drunk and a liar. His stealing from his own mother, in order to enjoy a drinking weekend with his about to be married buddy, is thus thoroughly, though sadly enough, in character.

As a matter of fact, it is the influence of Maya (Virginia Madsen), a woman and the moral center of the film, who sets him on the path toward true personhood. She initiates the process of turning a sow's ear into a silk purse. This is not because, as a woman, she's in any way obligated to such a duty. Instead, she has had occasion to see through his limitations to his potential value, and, therefore, she finds him worth her while. At the same time as their companion couple commence a dishonest relationship, Miles and Maya, out on a patio, begin a wonderful conversation, ostensibly about the merits of pinot noir, but in fact a conversation about human value and longing.  This scene is the turning point of the film and one of the most beautifully written scenes in world cinema.

After it, Miles, a former failed husband, is able to greet his ex-wife at her remarriage with civility, rather than the rage he'd forecasted. It is Maya, finally, whom he seeks to bond with, rather than his reprehensible male buddy. Only a man or woman without a heart could fail to be impressed by Miles' growth through the film, and this owing to his connection with a woman more profound than he.

One final and amusing note on Miles' pretentiousness as a wine conoisseur. A local (Los Angeles) wine critic has pointed out that the cherished bottle which the Merlot hating Miles drinks on his way to Santa Barbara at the film's end is actually a Merlot blend. So much for the idea that Miles is to any extent writer and director Alexander Payne's insufficiently criticized hero.",1175990400,5,2274,4.69172932330827
2240076,5,B0007RUSGW,"The medium of the cinema can be entertaining as well as educational, and when it's done well, a film can be both.  Such is the case with ""Sideways,"" directed by Alexander Payne, who also wrote the screenplay, which he adapted from the novel by Rex Pickett.

Jack (Thomas Haden Church), an actor whose ""star"" peaked some eleven years earlier and who now ekes out a living primarily doing commercials, is about to be married.  With one week to go before the big day, his best man/friend/former college roommate, Miles (Paul Giamatti), has cooked up a trip to California's wine country, where he proposes a week of friendship, good wine, good food and golf as a send-off for Jack into that most blessed state of matrimony.

As is often the case with the hand that Life deals us, however, the week does not quite go as planned, for a couple of reasons: First, though Miles proclaims this week to be about Jack, Miles is battling his own demons of depression, which have plagued him for going on two years now, ever since his divorce from his beloved Victoria (Jessica Hecht).  In addition to which, although he makes his living as an Eighth-Grade English Teacher, Miles is also an aspiring novelist, who happens to be waiting for a call from his agent, who has a publisher interested in the novel Miles has been working on for more than three years.  So there is an ulterior motive for Miles at work here; a wine connoisseur, he's taking Jack into country that is not only familiar to him, but is without question a ""comfort zone"" for Miles, who desperately needs a temporary respite from his own cares right now.

The other problem is that Jack has an inflated ego and an overactive libido, a potent combination that quickly dictates an alternate plan of action for the week.  Jack, it seems, is bent on sowing every last wild oat that remains, active or dormant, within him, before his impending nuptials scheduled for the following Saturday.  Soon he is involved with Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who works pouring samples of wine for visitors at one of the first vineyards to which Miles takes Jack on their tour.

Jack then successfully devises a plan that gets Miles involved with Maya (Virginia Madsen), a waitress at one of the restaurants Miles frequents on his visits to this part of the world.  Maya also happens to be a recent divorcee who is working on her Master's in Horticulture at one of the local colleges, as well as being a wine connoisseur in her own right and a friend of Stephanie's to boot.  All of which sounds like the makings of a good time for all, with one exception: Jack conveniently fails to tell Stephanie that he is about to be married.

Bad move, Jack...

In ""Sideways,"" Payne has created a highly entertaining and emotionally involving film with characters and situations to which a broad cross-section of viewers will readily be able to relate and identify.  Payne has an eye for nuance and subtlety, which makes his film- essentially a character study- a succinct examination of the human condition.

Subtlety and nuance is exactly what Paul Giamatti brings to the role of Miles, as well.  It's a performance that is so real it's almost excruciatingly so at times, but it makes Miles someone you can empathize with.  Giamatti creates a sympathetic character you can't help but root for on this vast wilderness of a stage we call life; it's a performance that should easily have earned him an Oscar for Best Actor.

Haden Church does an exemplary job, too, as Jack.  He imbues his character with such believable self-centered shallowness that you want to laugh at him and hit him at the same time.  The rub is, Jack knows what he's doing, but simply can't help himself; so in the end you may find yourself sympathizing with him anyway, because Haden Church presents Jack as someone who just does not possess the intellectual capacity to do otherwise, which somehow makes you want to let him off the hook.  You realize that this is just Jack honestly being who he is.  And it takes a good performance to get you as a viewer to that place.

The striking Virginia Madsen does a good job, as well, as Maya, creating a character that is a perfect counterpart to the Miles created by Giamatti.  And Sandra Oh, currently riding a surging wave of popularity due to her role on televisions ""Grey's Anatomy,"" brings some definite pizzazz to her role of Stephanie, successfully displaying her character's spirit, while at the same time exposing a decidedly vulnerable side of her.

The supporting cast includes Missy Doty (Cammi), M.C. Gainey (Cammi's husband), Patrick Gallagher (Gary the bartender), Marylouise Burke (Mile's mother), Alysia Reiner (Christine) and Stephanie Faracy (Stephanie's mother).

A film that lends itself to repeated viewings, ""Sideways"" is one of those gems that makes you appreciate not only the artists involved, as well as the art of filmmaking, but the medium itself.  I like this movie more every time I see it.",1175472000,18,4959,4.761682242990654
2240077,5,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways starts right off as a ""road trip"" movie.  Two ex-college room mates get in the car and hop off to the Coastal Wine Region of Southern California.  It doesn't take too long to figure out the two men, Miles and Jack, are not the finest examples of human beings.  They openly drink champagne in the car.  Miles steals cash from his mother in a brief stopover.  Jack is getting married on the upcoming Saturday and he sees this trip as a means to let loose his carnal desires.  It gets worse as the trip goes on.  Each is a self-absorbed loser, but each in different way.

Most films of this type will have one or both of the characters ""grow"" as the trip progresses.  This is not the case here.  When all is said and done, the two end up no different than how they started.  This is why the film is titled ""Sideways"" as the characters do not move forward.  This is probably why some viewers have trouble with this film.  It doesn't fit the mold.

I like the film's attention to detail - particularly the accuracy of the locations as I am familiar with this region.  The interaction between the two main characters and the women they meet is engaging.  Every one of them seems very real to me as they each remind me of people I know or knew.  I also like how even though one of the characters is still the self-absorbed loser, he finally shows a glimmer of improvement in the very final scene.

2240080,5,B0007RUSGW,"It's taken me three long years to finally see the film, Sideways, starring Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church.  I'm like the coyote in the ""Roadrunner"" cartoons that pays a visit to the kicking machine after every stupid mistake.  Not seeing this brilliant movie sooner was certainly a mistake on my part.  At least it's now been corrected.  Though this movie is referred to as a comedy (and it is funny in a lot of places), I saw Sideways as more of a serious drama with humor mixed in.  There's a lot of emotional sadness and heartache in this film, and it's not to be taken lightly.
The movie deals with two middle-aged California men who are experiencing somewhat of a mid-life crisis.  Miles (played by Giamatti) is an 8th Grade schoolteacher who has dreams of being a published writer.  Also, after being divorced for two years, he still hasn't gotten over his ex-wife and foolishly believes that there's a chance they'll eventually get back together.  Jack (played by Church) is a long-time struggling actor whose career may actually be over.  He just doesn't know it, yet.  Jack's about to marry into a rich family in a few days, and he's starting to have second thoughts about his decision.  Miles decides to take Jack on a road trip up to the wine vineyards in Santa Barbara the week before the wedding so that they can sample a lot of different wines, played golf, and relax a little bit before the big day finally arrives.  During the trip, the two men inadvertently get involved with two very intelligent, passionate, and independent women (Maya who's played by Virginia Madsen and Stephanie who's played by Sandra Oh), setting the stage for humor, betrayal, and a great deal of emotional turmoil.  This is why I say that Sideways isn't a comedy, but rather a serious drama.  Both men are attempting to face their own inner demons and to find solutions to stheir dilemmas.  Through an up-and-down roller coaster ride of emotions that involve the relationships that are developed with Maya and Stephanie, the two guys soon realize that it may be necessary to let their old dreams go, if they want to embrace a better future and to finally be happy.
Sideways is a vivid study of male friendship, mid-life crisis, and how difficult it is to give up your old dreams for newer and better ones.  The acting by the four main principles is subtle; yet also deeply truthful in its grasp of human behavior.  There are three really powerful scenes in the film that stood out for me.  The first is at the beginning when Miles and Jack stop on their way to Santa Barbara to see Miles' mother.  While there, Miles pays a visit to his mother's bedroom and steals several hundred dollars from her dresser bureau.  This is when you suddenly know that Sideways isn't a comedy.  You unexpectedly find yourself filled with a mixture of dark emotions as Miles stares into the mirror on the bureau, not liking what he sees and feeling disgust over what he's just done.  The second scene is when Miles is explaining to Maya why he likes and maybe subconsciously identifies with a particular type of grape.  Maya then explains to him the things that drew her to an appreciation of good wine, especially how a bottle of wine is alive and constantly developing and how it can taste different from one moment to the next.  This scene is definitely one of Virginia Madsen's best.  The third scene in the movie is near the end when Jack is literally begging Miles to help him retrieve his lost wallet because it has the wedding rings in it.  Jack finally admits that he's done a bad thing and that he doesn't want to lose his fianc.  This is powerful acting by both Giamatti and Church.  The expression on their faces captured perfectly the heart-felt emotions that two friends can have for each other, knowing that it's impossible not to help the other.  Alexander Payne, the director of Sideways, is going to have hard time trying to surpass this masterpiece of a film.  This is the best piece of work that he's done to date and About Schmidt was one of his earlier films.  It just goes to show that it doesn't take a hundred million dollars to make a great movie.  What it does take, however, is a strong script, strong direction, and strong acting.  I now wish that Sideways had won more Academy Awards than it did.

2240081,2,B0007RUSGW,"This movie was so overhyped. Any one who writes a review here who says ""I know wine and I approve this movie"" is full of it. Those who work in the wine industry know about the meritage of the featured Pinot including Merlot, but aside from that piece of trivia the fact is, Merlot is a great varietal. It just got too popular, so this movie takes a cheap shot to make fun of it, and all of the people who enjoy it. Wine is not about being snobby and pretentious, it's about drinking wine that YOU you like.(It did a huge disservice to Merlot growers and winemakers by bashing it BTW). That's beside the point, however. The movie was just pathetic in it's interpretation of middle aged men. It had a few moments, but nothing to make up for the pain of having to watch these horrible characters for the length of the movie. Just sad and blah.

It makes some silly propaganda of Armenians in California, like Jewish and Greek propaganda in some of the latest Hollywood movies. It makes me to think as being an American, for these people being Armenian, Greek or Jewish is more important than being an American or being part of an American culture. It's hard to accept an American guy was begging and crying to get married with an Armenian- American girl because her family is rich and her father wasn't pleased because he wasn't of Armenian origin, I couldn't believe the story, I hope the facts were just a part of an imagination not truth.

2240086,1,B0007RUSGW,"First, let me say that if you liked this movie, it might be indicative of why you're middle-aged and going through a crisis, have a trail of broken marriages behind you, and wondering why you're single yet again.  Please, for all of our sakes, grow up.

That's a good segue into why this is such a sophomoric movie.  The main perps are pitiful, narcissistic boomers who never grew up, and when the credits roll, should you somehow make it that far, you realize they never will.  I found every aspect of this story stupid, but maybe that was their point.  I can accept that, but to then call it ""intelligent comedy""?  Doublespeak.

Miles, the hero, is is a 40-something man/boy who gets his mom drunk and steals her money when she passes out so that he and his role model can get drunk for a week. He strives for, achieves and laments mediocrity.  He knows wrong from right, but like the rest of the PC crowd, he looks the other way, afraid that if he identifies wrong, people might not like him.  He tries to impress others with his pretentiousness and lives his life in fear.  Worst of all, he's a school teacher, and we're supposed to think he's funny?  If you think it's funny that someone this lacking in quality of character could be teaching YOUR kids, you need professional help, and a visit from social services.

Jack is a self-absorbed *user* whose must unzip his pants to engage his brain.  Engaged to be married in a week, he's out to screw as many women as he can before it becomes grounds for divorce, which is inevitable.  This behavior isn't unusual for him, it's SOP, and we are to believe he's not a walking STD incubator.  It's obvious he doesn't value marriage because one of his conquests is married.  When confronted by another of his trophies, he gets the snot beat out of him. Honestly, I was very disappointed that she didn't shoot him.  He does meet the love of his life though...in every mirror.  Jack is so Hollywood.

Maya is a hard working waitress, and the least dysfunctional of the cast, which isn't saying much.  Everyone else in the movie is trying to get her to sleep with loser, er, Miles.  She tries to like Miles, but it's a constant compromise of her standards. The more she finds out about him, the more she realizes her instincts are correct about his true character (or lack thereof).  In the end, she's a compromised loser like everybody else and the movie begs us to pity her.

And Stephanie?  Well, Steph is just looking for a man to take care of her and her daughter, and she's not getting any younger, you know.  The Stephanie method; jump into bed with every guy who comes along and screw his brains out, of course.  After all, sex=love, love=sex, right?  In the end, she's been had (yet again).  But she was a willing participant, so why is she so angry?  Because she's stupid, that's why.  She thinks men want to marry women who jump into bed with them after two hours.  She apparently also thinks that she's entitled to marriage after screwing the same stranger four times.  If she were 16, we might call her naive. But Steph's been around this block and should know better.

I have a question for the women out there who loved this film.  Is this how you want men to behave with you?  Is this (compromising, stupid, sleazy and desperate) the image of women that you want men to have in mind when they meet you?  How about when they meet your daughter?  Yeah, that's what I thought.

This was not a comedy.  It was a sad film about unhappy people.  At the end, you aren't left laughing, you are just stricken by the hopelessness of it all.  The only redeeming quality to be found in this toilet bowl full of soft porn and vulgarity is as a warning to grow up.

Why did the Hollywood crowd so eagerly buzz over this garbage?  No, not because they're flies (well, I might reconsider that).  It's because this type of self-indulgent and stupid behavior is reflective of liberal Hollywood values.  It's how the liberal crowd lives...indulging every animalistic urge no matter what sad consequences result.  Like Jack, they simply love themselves, and they litter a path of brokenness in their wake as they screw their way through their loveless lives.

The wise accumulate wisdom; fools get stupider by the day.

Everything is perfect - the actors' choice, the acting, directing , and the pace. It is a long film but it never rushes and it is never slow. The perfect combination of hilarity and bitter-sweetness, humor and drama, depressing realizations about life and hope make ""Sideways' one of the best films of that year for me. It is the best of three Alexander Payne's films I've seen. This film like a fine wine would not get old or outdated.

2240091,5,B0007RUSGW,"While reading the novel that this movie is based upon, I was struck by how timing and identification can make or break one's reaction to a book.  The same goes for movies. In 1995 I probably wouldn't have given this movie a second glance.  But I had gotten into drinking wine a couple of years before ""Sideways"" came out, and I was also close to the age of the main characters.  So in 2005 I was primed to empathize with their cathartic journey of middle-aged self-discovery.

The plot is pretty straightforward.  Miles and Jack are two fortysomething guys who've been friends since college.  Miles is a divorced schoolteacher and failed writer, while Jack is a has-been actor engaged to a rich young woman.  Despite his shaky financial status, Miles likes the finer things in life - such as fine dining and stimulating conversation over a good pinot noir.  So, as a ""last hurrah"" before Jack's marriage, Miles decides to take him on a weeklong trip through California wine country.  However, they get more than they bargained for, especially after meeting Maya and Stephanie.  To say much more would turn a fine vintage into vinegar.

The four main actors are uniformly excellent.  Paul Giamatti brings a sharp pathos to Miles, and Thomas Haden Church embodies Jack as a likeable but selfish aging lothario.  As for the ladies, Virginia Madsen's Maya is a lovely, intelligent woman with a great palate who is a bit out of Miles' league, and Sandra Oh's Stephanie is sexy, sassy, and vulnerable to Jack's seductive charisma.  For me, Giamatti's performance is especially poignant, since he perfectly embodies the solitary, yearning existence of a middle-aged singleton whose literary and relational dreams have withered on the vine.  In addition, as a single man that has ""lost"" many friends to marriage, I identified with Miles' reactions to Jack's withdrawal from their friendship into matrimony (not to mention his withdrawal into Stephanie).  Based on my own life, I could tell that Miles had plenty of practice making the best of solitude.

The DVD extras add body and flavor to the feature presentation.  For example, each of the deleted scenes comes with a text introduction by the director explaining its significance and why it was cut.  But the real standout is the commentary by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church.  They have a natural chemistry, and their banter really shines.  The intriguing insights they provide are leavened with plenty of self-deprecating humor (almost as funny as the movie itself), with just enough trivia to leave one wanting more.  It's how film commentary should be done.  The only possible improvement would've been input by the female leads.  I certainly would've enjoyed their perspective on the proceedings.

2240092,5,B0007RUSGW,"I was told before viewing by my 52 year old uncle that I probably wouldn't like ""Sideways"" because I'm only 28 years old, he concluded that I should wait a few years before seeing it so I could fairly access it. Well, I'm proud to say that he couldn't have been more wrong, I absolutely love this movie. I love the calm, relaxed vibe of it, it makes the bizarre, over the top scenes (too many to mention!) stand out that much more. Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church have a level of chemistry that I can't remember seeing on film since...well, ever maybe, I'd love to see them do the Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder thing. Their chemistry is also evident off film as well, the DVD commentary track is almost as good as the movie, they really do seem like 2 guys who genuinely enjoyed working together. I recommend this to any and everyone with at least a normal IQ level, lol, you will not be disappointed I promise.

2240093,5,B0007RUSGW,"One of the best movies of 2004 was this highly entertaining 'feel good' drama/comedy of a week-long 2 man bachelor's party. It's kind of a 'mut and jeff' story. Set in the beautiful California wine country, this is an amusing human character study of two guys, old friends from college, and very different from each other in temperament.

The husband-to-be experiences his second guessing, particularly as he encounters any member of the opposite sex as he gleefully views the week as his 'last harrah' and wastes no time nor opportunity to 'live it up'. The other, emotionally conservative, cerebral and introspective, and still lamenting over a failed marriage, is so wrapped up in his own feelings of inadequacy that he doesn't really want to be there in the first place. The dynamic between the two is great. They actually really complement each other in their contrasting yet endearing friendship.

The screenplay is exceptionally well written with very 'human' character flaws revealed in these two rather lovable clowns that are displayed in the most humorous of ways. Along the way they meet up with interesting and provocative women and each guy has a very different reaction to the whole thing. The scenery is of course wonderful and the film also serves as an introductory primer about those who live with an attuned awareness of fine wines. A rather interesting world, it seems almost cult-like. It inspires me to want to take such a trip someday, bouncing from winery to winery, sampling the grapes. Sound like fun? Does to me!

The combination of drama to humor is a deft mix. The story is progressively interesting yet interjected with a lot of dry humor. It really captivates one's interest as these characters are further defined. By the end of the film both of their personalities are revealed to a degree of complexity that is rare for a movie coming out of hollywood these days. Both men have the propensity to deceive themselves, although to greatly different degrees. The net result is the viewer comes away with a good deal of empathy for these flawed characters.

All in all, an excellent, light film that will make you laugh out loud and end up making you feel good. Very well done.",1164067200,3,2207,4.861702127659575

The two main characters are the two old college odd-couple buddies Jack (Thomas Haden Church) and Miles (Paul Giamatti) hit the road for Jack's last week of freedom before his wedding. Jack is an actor who was on a daytime soap opera once, but now does voiceovers for commercials. And Miles is a mid-school English teacher who fancies him self a novelist.

Miles thinks he is going to introduce his friend into marriage with a tour of the wine country and some golf. While Jack has no morals and wants to just go wild party every night. They both hook up with woman played by Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh. While Jack is getting him self deeper into to trouble each day, Miles is just standing at the edge of life and is waiting to be pushed back into it.

SIDEWAYS, based on a novel by Rex Pickett, is a good film, but beware, there's full frontal nudity in the last 20 minutes! Also, The DVD commentary is hilarious, and there are two easter eggs.

Damn, I almost fell asleep.  I am like the review before me; except I was alone.  I kept looking around mouthing the words:  ""Is it me?  It's them, right?"" as I gestured toward the convoluted conversations coming from my home viewing screen.  Sorry, but watching two white guys discuss wine for 2+ achingly boring hours is not my idea of an award winning movie!  I guess the saving grace is seeing the Asian woman, and imagining the ""freaky"" activities going on behind closed doors.  But what a schmuck that guy was, as it was the weekend before his wedding.

Also, I didn't appreciate how there was no damn explanation of what these two goofballs were doing, driving across California, to various wineries.  What the hell was going on?  This is how some horny white guy spends his last weekend of freedom?  How about living a little, going to a strip club, or even taking in a Broadway show?  But sitting in restaurants, and tasting booths?  Nah ahh!  Homie don't play that.

I watched this movie the other night and it caught my interest and never lost it.  This is a good movie!  What can I say about Jack?  He is getting married on Saturday, but you'd never know it with his crazy adventures the week before as he and Miles travel through California wine country down to San Diego to his wedding.  Miles, Jack's college roomate, could not be more different from Jack.  I've always been a fan of Virginia Madsen and she shines in this movie.  No wonder she got nominated for an Academy Award.  The other girl is a regular on Grey's Anatomy I think.  Forgive me for not knowing her name, but she really knows how to beat up a guy with a purse.

2240109,4,B0007RUSGW,"I was at risk of disliking a film about wine snobs where nothing much happens (the gist of bad reviews of ""Sideways"").  To my surprise, I liked this DVD for the following reasons:

* A barrel of laughs and action-packed compared to the previous DVD I watched (""Capote"").

* The scenery in the wine country of Southern California is beautiful, as are the restaurants the characters visit and Stephanie's rural home.

* Maya seemed like such a sympathetic character, plowing through Miles' book even though she barely knew him, and Jack, though a rogue himself, has Miles' best interests at heart, helping Miles and Maya get together.

If you want DUMB comedy, buy this movie. It's really for people that laugh at nudity, wine, and immorality. Stealing from your mom? A little petty, but still, not that funny.

2240113,5,B0007RUSGW,I loved this movie. I normally would not appreciate a writer writing about his angst. This movie was done with a self-effacing humor. The characters are flawed but loveable.,1155427200,,173,5.0
2240114,4,B0007RUSGW,"It's difficult to sum up this movie with one concise paragraph. It's the story of Jack and Miles road trip to the Santa Barbara wine country the week before Jack's wedding. It contains beautiful scenery, lots of wine, little real life unsexy sex, a small amount of comedy, but seems to primarily be about how Miles and Jack deal with their dissappointing lives.

Miles is a school teacher and a writer from San Diego. His first book is being shopped around and is now in the hands of a small publisher - probably the last chance for the book. His main passion in life, however, is wine. He enjoys it both for it's sensual pleasure, but also to numb his angst. Miles, you see, suffers from anxiety and depression. He drinks too much when his problems seem to much to handle, which is often.  Especially since his divorce 2 years ago.

Miles main goal for the trip is to show Jack a good time. To drink some fine wine, play some golf, and take in the beautiful location.

Jack wants to get laid one last time before he get's married. He also decides that it's time for Miles, his former college roomate, to get over his ex-wife and has made it his goal to get a women for Miles as well.

Jack is seemily the exact opposite of Miles. Charming and confident on the surface, he's a former soap opera star who is now doing commericial voice overs. He can't quite give up the acting dream. Jack's finance comes from a wealthy family so Jack may have some other options once he ties the knot.

Their trip, of course, follows both their plans. They drink wine, play golf, and chase women. They meet Maya and Stephanie, two intelligent, attractive, and interesting women, but things don't go quite as planned. Neither man really get's what they want from the week. There's long simmering tension between Miles and Jack, brought out by their different desires for the week. They like each other, but their differences are such that a week together is just too much time to be together.

So say any more would give away too much of the plot. I will mention, though, that the acting is first rate. All 4 main actors do excellent jobs with their roles.

There is an added bonus if you are a wine geek, yourself. They drink real wines in this movie. You see the labels and they talk about the wines. They are first rate wines, though Miles is a bit of a snob.

I enjoyed the movie. It's very likely that you may not like either Miles or Jack. They are both flawed individuals. The movie goes out of it's way to show that. All of use are flawed in our own ways (some more than others, of course). We all have our ways for dealing with it. For Miles it's wine, and for Jacks it's sex. The cure is only temporary, but they keep trying.",1155340800,,2717,4.375

Not even a little snigger, let alone a big belly laugh anywhere in sight. I don't know what Rex Pickett's book's like, but this was very disappointing. I'm not a big fan of American Pie-style humor, but at least that did make me laugh, unlike this. Maybe I'm far less cerebral than I imagine and that's why I didn't get it.

It's a great road trip/buddy movie.  It isn't perfect--Jack's emotional breakdown at the end is a bit unbelieveable given his character to that point--but the performances throughout are wonderful, and the two leads play off each other perfectly.

It's a wonderful actor's movie.  The players run with their characters.  Giamatti and Church play off each other like a comfortable old team; it's a pleasure to watch them.  I read somewhere that George Clooney wanted the role of Jack--the philandering sidekick.  The director was wise enough to avoid the temptation--if it even was a temptation--and go with Church, who is far more believeable than Clooney would have been as a one-time soap opera star now getting by on voice-over work. How would we have felt about such vile language pouring out of Mr. Suave's mouth?

It's a poignant comedy, but it does have its crude moments--if you are of a prissy nature, forget it, this one's not for you.  There's nudity, sex, foul language, and drunkenness.

The commentary track on the movie features Giamatti and Church...there isn't much there.  It's pretty much just a riff on the movie without much actual insight or information, but amusing in it's way.

They don't get it and don't want to get it.  The comments remind me of Jack trying to comment about the novel Miles wrote.  Lol.

If you watch this film for no other reason than to see one of our time's finest actors (Giamatti) in one of the best performances of the last several years, then you are doing yourself a favor. Giamatti's performance is subtle but his range of expression and emotion is incredible. There are no flaws in his acting and he's so good in the role that you believe entirely that he is the character Miles. I don't usually gush but this is one of those actors whose films you watch for his performance alone.

In some ways it's a metaphor for modern America - one character having a brash, and blatant disregard for others, while simultaneously expounding that it's really all going to be ok in the end.

The other character is quietly going about his business, standing steadfast to the morals he really believes in, but is powerless in being able to stop the determined, and misguided oaf.",1153526400,3,714,4.6141732283464565
2240124,5,B0007RUSGW,"How incredibly uplifting it is to view another genius film by director Alexander Payne. Payne, whose earlier films include, ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"" were darkly humorous, and about people who look at themselves as losers and failures. ""Sideways"" is no exception, and Payne has done an excellent job on creating a film (such as his previous works) that do not have much complexity to the characters, which in turn, ends up making them very complex.

The film stars Paul Giammati as Miles who has just written a book and hopes to find a publisher. He has been divorced for two years and his life is very unstable. His best friend since college, Jack played by Thomas Haden Church, is about to get married. Miles wants to make sure his best friend receives the proper sendoff before he takes the trip down the altar.  Jack and Miles take a week long excursion through the beautiful wine valleys of Southern California. The trip is of more interest to Miles, as he is very wine savvy.  It is quite clear that both Jack and Miles are complete opposites as Miles is quiet and introspective, while Jack is very outgoing and fun loving.  The movie continues with Jack and Miles up and down experiences and eventually finding themselves.

It is very clear after watching ""Sideways"" in addition to Payne's previous films, he consistently provides concentration to the small details of everyday life, and places the characters in realistic settings so the audience can associate and relate.  The dialogue is very natural and sincere, as every conversation sounds like something you would have with one of your friends.  As a result, the film feels very genuine and comforting and forces you to identify.

""Sideways"" has a good balance of drama and comedy in addition to an excellent jazz score that heightens the film. Payne also does an excellent job of directing the flow and pace, in addition to strategic comedic timing, makes the lengthy movie feel like it is just as long as it needs to be.  The tongue-in-cheek humor is very clever, so if you are drawn more towards a comedy such as ""Old School"" versus ""Rushmore"", you may not enjoy this movie.  Nothing is spoon fed, as much of the meaning you'll derive will rely on you reflecting on your own life experiences.  This will often turn off mainstream audiences that may take it for face value. I strongly recommend this film, as it is easily Payne's best film and one of my all time favorites.",1153440000,3,2444,4.754137115839243

When it came to town I was really anxious to see what many reviewers commented in the papers: that it was a great movie. However, once I saw it, what a dissapointment! I thought it was so dull, uninteresting and terribly boring. None of the characters was attractive to me; on the contrary, I always felt them distant and cold. And that's exactly what the movie is, a piece of ice which does not move anybody. I agree 100% in saying that it's a big waste of time and money. It was Oscar nominated? You must be kidding!

The are doing some crazy things and the story and the actings are right on target and very convincing. However, it's not a light comedy. Some scenes are pretty bitter, and some are just outrangeous (like two guys drinking wine while driving). The movie doesn't end happily and doesn't give much hope.

Overall, it's really a masterpiece. The actors play is great, the story is full of fine little details, etc. But the movie subject is sad and depressing and not everyone will enjoy it.

2240127,4,B0007RUSGW,"I must admit before I watched this film, I had no idea what it was about.  It was recommended to me from friends and I decided to take a break from my horror movies and get into some drama.  Don't get me wrong I am not a stranger from the drama genre but it's not my forte. I have always been a fan of Paul Giamatti.  I remember the first time I saw him in ""Private Parts"" and though he was just hilarious.  I then rented ""American Splendor"", and ""Cinderella Man"" and though he did a wonderful performance in both films, in ""Sideways"" he was incredible.  I am not sure what it is, but he is able to play very memorable characters.

In ""Sideways"" he plays a recently divorced 8th grade school teacher who is a wine connoisseur.  A very unique character to say the least, Thomas Haden Church plays Jack a friend Miles (Giamatti) who is having doubts about his wedding.  The two characters venture out on a trip to tour different wineries.  Jack not knowing anything about wine is hilarious when Miles tries to explain the joys of wine drinking to him.  During this trip both characters get involved with two women and that's when the dominos just begin to fall.  Miles is looking for a real relationship but is struggling with still feeling like he needs his ex-wife, while Jack however is just looking for some wild fun before he gets married.  Miles fights through the whole film trying to get Jack to do the right thing while also trying to deal with his own demons.  Jack meanwhile just gets them both in deeper and deeper trouble.  While viewing this film I was constantly rooting for Giamatti's character.  His loyalty to his unmoral friend is amazing.  Seeing how Jack nearly ruins his chances of reinventing his life for the better.  This was a film that I truly enjoyed.

2240130,5,B0007RUSGW,"I remember when there was a time we used to watch movies for entertainment, with good editing, good direction & excellent scripts; Alexander Payne did a good job with this movie & went back to the basics to create this masterpiece.

The only thing that equally harmed the movie yet made it a success was the hype. A funny thing with hype is that it raises the bar on the quality of the movie which makes it hard to live up to yet with all that publicity the movie has a better success rate. It's a no-win situation.

But overall Sideways does come out on top although it's not meant for all audiences (besides the R rating) you need to have gone through the ups & downs of life to experience what Paul Giamatti is going through & me being divorced know exactly how that feels (especially the Xanax phase).

Reading some of the earlier reviews, I've noticed reviewers branding Giamatti & Thomas Haden Church, as loosers! Well I don't know about Church but Giamatti is definitely not. There is a thin line between being human with feelings & a looser. People like Giamatti put a lot of emotion & feeling in what they do be it wine tasting, experiencing gourmet cooking or writing a novel so when something goes wrong it sort of eats away at their soul; its more like an amalgamation of midlife crisis, loss & low sense of worth. A deadly combination, whichever way you look at it.

There is no shortage of human emotion in this movie although I really thought Giamatti ought to have been nominated for an Oscar as opposed to Church; don't get me wrong I like Thomas Haden Church, I've been a fan of his ever since Wings & Ned & Stacy, he's good, versatile & overall quite believable but I think Giamatti takes the cake in this movie & a great choice for his role.

Verdict: Overall quite an enjoyable movie with some really witty dialogue not to mention the mini-plots within the main plot. It strikes a decent balance between good filmmaking & a modern-day romantic comedy.

Rating: 4 &  stars for a well written movie made with a lot of emotion & creditable performance.",1152144000,3,2070,4.48936170212766

2240132,5,B0007RUSGW,"""Sideways"" follows the journey of two middle aged men Miles and Jack as they drive to vacation before Jack walks down the aisle.  Jack determined to have one last fling gives this vacation a more problematic twist.  Miles is a wine expert, and he intises this hobby as he meets a local waitress who he has seen time by time.  Little do Miles and Jack know is that how their female finds will affect them in the next few days and even their lifetimes.  This becomes more than just a journey.  This is a journey of them finding themselves and why their lives are so dramatic.

""Sideways"" proceeded to win several awards, including two Golden Globes and one Oscar.  It stars Paul Giamotti (""American Splender""), Thomas Haden Church (TV's ""Wings""), Virginia Madsen (""Candyman""), and Sandra Oh (TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"").  This film was well adapted from the book version with its soft-headed humor with a dramatic twist.  This unique storyline combines love, reflection, and alcohol finely.  It contains the style that of old-fashioned journey films and modernizes it with the alcohol hobbies.  This technique combines well with all of the themes and turn of events.  This allows the characters to have a motive to bond so well instead of just cause.  Therefore, this comedy is not just an action comedy; this is a thematic comedy.

Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen make terrific comebacks in this film in their Oscar and Golden Globe nominated roles (both supporting performances).  Not just did they make comebacks; they performed the best roles in their careers.  Paul Giomatti proves his acting capabilities with the second consecutive outstanding performance in a film (the first being ""American Splender"").  His performance notes the overall film theme the truest.  Though Sandra Oh didn't receive many award nominations for this film, she still gave great essence to it like her fellow cast members.

Such film quality gives ""Sideways"" the worthiness for becoming a classic in the following years.  It will surely continue pleasing many audiences as it already has.",1151366400,3,2072,5.056047197640118

Thankfully it avoids the depressing tone of other films such as American Beauty and finds humor in the journey.  Giamatti is a great actor and lets you feel his despair about the failures of his marriage and budding novel career.  However he still can lighten it up in the more humorous scenes.  Jack (Thomas Haydan Church) plays a sterotypical mid-life crisis male, he's afraid he's missing out and chooses to sleep around one week before his wedding.  However THC is also very funny and is always working to pull his friend out of his funk.  Virginia Madsen finally gets a role to showcase what she's capable of.  How great is it that a man is attracted to a woman his age because of her intellect and interests.  Yes she's very pretty, but if regular Hollywood was casting they would probably choose a 20 something starlet in the role.  Her maturity is a large part of her appeal.  Overall it has laugh out loud scenes as well as great dialog.  Many films try to acheive this level but never get there.",1149120000,4,1076,4.466666666666667
2240134,4,B0007RUSGW,"""Sideways"" has a fine premise for a movie:  Two friends go traveling in Northern California to celebrate the freedom of bachelorhood before one of them gets married.  Both have their own selfish interests and addictions:  (One is addicted to alcohol [Paul Giamatti]; the other is addicted to sex [Thomas Hayden Church].)  Their passions seem to be their only bond, for they increasingly separate from one another, each to pursue his own obsession.  Their escapades reveal desperation for each and provide some revealing and comic situations along the way.

The acting is exceptional.  Paul Giamatti is particularly expert at playing the lonely wino and conniosseur.  We may not always like the characters (and maybe we're not supposed to), but we can find their struggles and the story appealing enough.  The story is complete, unlike some films that only try to illustrate relationships and do little else.

2240136,3,B0007RUSGW,"Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the bottle, out pops on corker of a movie. From the director of ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"", Alexander Payne teams up with fellow writer, Jim Taylor once again.  Bottled as a dark comedy with a hint of romance and a label that reads, ""13% Drama by Volume,"" ""Sideways"" tries but fails to capture any one genre.  Maybe that is why some moments are touching and others; absurd and pretentious.

 Miles (Paul Giamatti) and his best friend, Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) decide to tour the wine-clad hills of California the week before Jack's nuptials; a kind of bachelor party for the wine aficionado except that Jack is everything but and Miles is in such a depressed slump that his vast knowledge of wine can only be summed up with the words, ""I'm not drinking any f@%! Merlot!"" Miles intentions for the week are quite clear: bond with his best friend over a few bottles of wine, forget about the demise of his marriage, relax from the pressures of trying to get his novel published, and hey! play a few holes of golf. What he gets is a week full of more strife, all thanks to his sidekick, Jack, whose intentions are less muddled -sex, sex, sex, and more sex.

 Although Miles is steering the car to their destinations; Jack is the pilot. Jack meets an exotic local cashier at one of the winery stops and decides to temporarily put a halt to his impending nuptials much to Mile's chagrin.  Stephanie, played by the delightful Sandra Oh (Gray's Anatomy), is everything that Jack believes has been missing from his life.  She is a cross between Biker Barbie and a Wrecking Ball and she comes complete with a single friend, Maya, for Miles. Only Miles is still reeling from his recent divorce from his wife that the best he can muster awkward silence followed by the best display of triathlon alcoholic binge drinking since ""Bridget Jones' Diary.""

 Virginia Madsen plays Maya, a fellow wine connoisseur. She is the only character capable of bringing the movie back from is sophomoric antics of Jack. In one of the most poignant scenes, Miles and Maya go tte--tte in a wine slam that not only reveals their knowledge of wine, but also the philosophies that guide their lives. Finally! The writer's supply dialogue that is noteworthy and Madsen is more than apt to take up the challenge of giving the words, and movie, life. Watching Madsen in this scene is like knowing exactly what was going on in Mona Lisa's head when she posed for DaVinci- wine!

 Jack, Jack, Jack. How hard is it to insert an egocentric, masochistic, two-dimensional buddy like Jack? Miles knows where his faults lie and completely gives up on himself before anyone else can.  Jack has no idea that he has any faults and quickly forgets about them ten seconds after they are revealed. How there two could be friends is beyond me.  Miles is the every loveable tragic figure and Jack- one of the reasons they made those ""I'm with Stupid"" tee-shirts.  Poor Miles spends most of the movie trying to reel in the Great White that is Jack. Thomas  Hayden Church does his best in his performance, but I can still only anticipate that Stephen Weber will walk across the screen as Crystal Bernard cleans a counter.

 ""Sideways"" is not a movie about romance, nor is it a drama. It falls into that space between the splendor of ""American Beauty"" and ""Dumb and Dumber."" However, it is a move about those moments in one's life, however ordinary, where perfection cannot be attained. Regardless of how hard we try to make ourselves believe otherwise, life, like a fine wine, has its moments where it peaks.",1148256000,16,3610,4.658267716535433

Paul Giamatti (whatshisname) is a great actor. He might look as innocous as they come with his balding feature but he manages to actually become the soul of character,that of a writer who is helplessly in love with wine and the fading memory of his ex-wife, quite perfectly. Along with a friend, he manages to stunt my expectations and come out with a film that I wasn't expecting one bit. This film has excitement,that of a kind of it's own, this film is not funny, not one bit but yet it is meant for a patient viewer who's been yearning to watch a film of a ""Certain"" kind for a long time.

Sideways will entertain you if you read the first para rather well. I might have failed in nailing the point and convincing you but atleast you know how I feel.

It made me feel so MANY things,and I never thought much about wine before I seen this movie...Driving through wine country and tasting along the way is what the story anchored on,But the people Miles and Jack come into contact with,how we connect with people we meet,was so true to life like.

 Especially Miles character got to me so much. Jack was pretty shallow and his shenanigans were pretty..funny/stupid, but Miles character had raw EMOTION in everything he did and everyone he touched.

I was happy we were left to believe he and Maya connected as a couple when he knocked at her door at the ending,His character was just so sad, unsure of himself,hurt after his breakup,dissapointed in all the people around him,and in life in general..

Basically, it's a good old-fashioned ""buddy picture"" in the same spirit as ""The Odd Couple."" It deals with serious adult issues of marriage, divorce, sex, commitment, jealousy, failure, shame, rage... with a lot of humor. And that's life! (My favorite line was Thomas Haden Church's response to Paul Giamatti's lament that he wasn't even famous enough to commit suicide -- ""What about that guy who wrote ""Confederacy of Dunces?"") Parts of this film are very slapstick-y, but I admit I laughed a lot.  Mostly it's just a story about four people, in their late 30's, early 40's with bad jobs, failed marriages and crummy apartments.

2240141,5,B0007RUSGW,"I've seen the reviews of this movie that call it ""slow"" or ""meandering"", but those reviewers just don't get the premise of the film.

Sideways is a tale of two friends' journey to wine country (Santa Ynez) that ends in love, hate, betrayal and comedy. It is a stream of consciousness story, but it has all the elements of a good adventure.

The best part about this movie is its reality. Two pre-middle aged guys, one who loves wine and the other who could care less, take a trip from Los Angeles northward to the wineries of the Santa Ynez Valley on the eve of the latter's wedding. They find great wine, good women, and bad situations. Each scene takes place in a real restaurant, winery, or hotel located on California's Central coast. This sense of reality really makes you connect with the characters.

Paul Giamatti is classic Paul Giamatti in this movie. He's a neurotic writer who can't get over his ex-wife or his love of wine. These two loves provide the conflict in the story and make for some really funny adventures with his neanderthal-like co-star who also loves women and wine for the totally wrong reasons.

As stories go, ""Sideways"" isn't your typical love story or comedy. It's a little of both that reminds you of the relationship between Vince Vaughn and John Favreau in ""Swingers"".

If you're looking for a movie with a clear cut introduction, problem and solution - this isn't it. If you're looking for a good story with fun acting and character development, ""Sideways"" will fit the bill.

2240142,5,B0007RUSGW,"This film is one of those movies that are made for people that can understand the deeper meaning of certian subjects & Content, the movie is some what similar to ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zizzou"" and ""Lost in Translation"", Paul Giamatti to me is a alot like Bill Murray other than the fact the Mr. Murray has a bit more of a humorous side, Giamatti in my opinion is one of the most under-rated actors of this decade. His performance in ""Cinnderella Man"" was oscar worthy as was his remarkable performance the the low-budget film, American Splender. I cannot wait to see the new M. Night Shaymalon film in which he plays the lead role, I believe it is called ""Lady In The Water"".BUT back to the subject at hand, Sideways follows to very different people, Jack and Miles (played by Thomas Haden Church & Giamatti) and how they spend a week vacation in the wine country of California. Though Jack is planning on getting married when he returns from their trip he hooks up with a young woman who Jack says is quote ""Nasty, Nasty, Nasty! Miles!, do you have that condom I gave you?"" ( I think you get the picture...), The movie & Jack continuously point out Miles's low self-esteem, bland and depressing attitude toward life & but of corse his major problems with da ladies!, though the movie can make you somewhat depressed for poor Miles it also has a tendencey to throw you off a bit for a good laugh or two.

The cinamatography is absolutly stunning, the humor is uncanny, the acting is flawless and the dialouge, direction & screenplay are all exceptional, though the movie can be slow to some with small attention spands and others who have to have either non-stop action or constant humor, I thought it was very good and would recommend it to most. Great Film!

2240143,2,B0007RUSGW,"This movie has good people in actors and actresses roles.  However, I would not recommend this movie to most people because the vulgarity is not mentioned enough to people interested in this movie.

2240144,5,B0007RUSGW,"From his first scene in Sideways, Alexander Payne's masterfully structured coming-of-middle-age story, it is obvious that Miles (Paul Giamatti) cannot perform even the simplest task without error.  Hungover, he oversleeps only to find he must immediately evade the landlord to whom he owes rent and pick up Jack (Thomas Haden Church), his best friend and college roommate, for a week-long getaway in the northern California wine country before Jack's wedding the following Saturday.

Except that most men their age have abandoned such hijinks.  College was a longtime ago for these forty-somethings.  Miles' life reeks of failure - his marriage has recently ended (likely due to growing love affair with the bottle, especially Pinot) and the book he wrote eludes publication.  For Jack, an actor whose greatest success occurred years ago with a recognizable commercial voiceover and engaged to a woman he does not love, life is a series of compromises.  But their combination of masochism and hedonism makes for one compelling symbiotic relationship.

Both spend Miles' ill-planned week wine-tasting running from something; Miles is trying to forget his past, while Jack attempts to delay his future when the two meet two female counterparts: the educated waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen) and her friend Stephanie (Sandra Oh), a single mother who shares one trait in common with Jack: promiscuity, a trait that seems to be enough for the two of them.

Different as they are, Payne and co-screenwriter Jim Taylor (adapting Rex Pickett's novel) have nothing but respect for all four leading characters.  The secrets of male companionship and middle age have never been laid bare like this before, and both Giamatti and Church are nothing short of revelatory.  The characters of Maya and Stephanie aren't props either; one can envision running into either one of them in life.  One of the more gorgeous scenes in the film involve Maya's initial seduction of Miles as both metaphorically talk about the qualities of wine, when in reality describe themselves.  One of the most impressive feats in Sideways is Payne's sense of economy; not a single shot or line of dialogue seems extraneous, especially when backed by Rolfe Kent's jazz score.

As solid an ensemble piece as this is, it is Giamatti's tour-de-force that is the film's crowning achievement.  As Miles, his deft work and attention to detail creates a real person, rather than a showy performance.  He demonstrates what it is to be a person who recognizes but has not quite accepted life's limitations.  Most films stick to celebrating the beautiful people, life's winners; they avoid life's also-rans.  Sideways forces us to watch them.

And the rewards could not be more intoxicating.",1143590400,10,2741,5.20501138952164
2240145,3,B0007RUSGW,"If one didn't think the movie `Sideways' was a `wine' movie then one could be forgiven in the light of the tours and wine clubs that have grown up since its release: maps featuring the 18 locations of the film including the wineries and restaurants, a special `Sideways Package including wine tastings and accommodation, and of, course the Sideways Wine Club...

Without giving too much away, the main protagonist Miles (Paul Giamatti) is having a crisis-he is divorced and still in love with his ex-wife. His novel (the third he has written?), `The Day After Yesterday' is being considered by a publisher whose name doesn't exactly inspire confidence - Conundrum, although it has a certain resonance with his novel's title. He is down on his job, teaching `middle' English. He has two things, which sustain him: his love of wine and his love of his old college buddy Jack (Thomas Haden Church). Miles is taking his friend for a tour of the Santa Barbara wine country as a final `fling' before his friend gets married. Miles wants to eat, drink and play golf and all his friend can think about is getting laid.

So does this belong to that recherch&eacute; genre in films - the `wine' movie? Unlike Babettes Feast (1988) whose whole plot has as its culmination the creation of the ultimate food extravaganza, the same in Vatel (2000) starring Gerard Depardieu, these are both clearly `food' movies, Sideways doesn't begin to tug at the real wine lovers' strings and indeed throws it all away at the end when the characterisation breaks down for the sake of a popular moment of poignancy.

Miles does not like California Chardonnay but loves Pinot Noir, no matter its provenance. And he is `not drinking any f****** Merlot'. Which sounds pretty final. As he and his pal drive around Santa Barbara we pick up a few wine tips. How to savour the wine in the glass and that by finishing the day after a tour of wineries at the one closest to the motel one has less far to drive home. Miles' love of wine is the vehicle by which his buddy finds his first date. She is working in a winery where the Syrah doesn't match Miles' expectations (she agrees) - `flabby'. And Miles himself finds company with a local waitress who shares his passion. She even likes his book which Miles describes as some kind of `Robbe-Grillet' mystery - she gives a knowing look but I'm not sure how many people would have the faintest idea what he was talking about. The film makes a strong attempt in developing the characterisation of the players although the women come across as stereotypical.

The tenderest moment in the film is when Miles and Maja are sitting out on a porch still unsure of each other. When Maja asks Miles why he is `so into Pinot' it reveals him at his most articulate. Continuing the self-revelations Miles probes Maja as to how she got her love of the beverage which she reveals was down to a bottle of 1988 Sassicaia and because ""if I opened a bottle today, it would taste different from any other day"".

Towards the end of the movie, after Miles and his pal have basically upset everyone around them they return home and Miles meets his ex-wife. She is pregnant. It is enough to send Miles home to dig out his Cheval Blanc '61. He takes it to the local diner and there, while he eats a burger and fries, he drinks the bottle on his own from a large polystyrene cup eschewing all his earlier instructions on appreciating wine. Thus, in one small gesture he repudiates all his earlier character which was so painstakingly constructed. He treats the wine like a cup of Coke. And, Cheval Blanc is, if course, more than 40% Merlot (see note at the bottom of the page).

No, this isn't a `wine' movie but it's an entertaining comedy which is worth the price of a cinema ticket.

Some wines they mention:

1992 Byron ""100% Pinot Noir""

Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc ""12 months in French oak""

Whitecraft Winery 2001 Pinot Noir

Sea Smoke (Botella) 2001?

Kistler Vineyards

Pommard 1er Cru

Richebourg ""wow""

Andrew Murray ""too much alcohol which overwhelms the fruit""

Chteau Cheval Blanc 1961 - Miles' bottle which he is saving for a special occasion.

1988 Saissicaia: the wine that introduced Maja to wine loving.

Frass Canyon ""that's a joke"" - and it was. Based on another winery.

NOTE

According to Olivier Berrouet (Responsable de Qualit&eacute;) at Ch. Cheval Blanc currently 45% of the blend is Merlot (Cabernet Franc making up 55%). In 1961, when he wasn't there, he reckoned it was of an order closer to 50%.",1143244800,5,4511,4.664564943253468

Not only is Sandra Oh the only ""visible"" minority in this movie, she is the only character given a minor role.  The role of Oh's character as the asian sex freak is simply used to offset the ""deep"" character developoment of the other three major characters.  The Sandra Oh role should have been the Virginia Madsen character -- but then again Hollywood seems to be bent on maintaining certain stereotypes.",1141862400,2,585,4.888888888888889

It has a veneer of sophistication with the wine and divorced man pining for his ex and lost career, but that to me comes off almost as snobbery.

There are a few scenes which are memorable, but not really that many.  One of the great things about it is that it's mostly shot on location which is not common these days.  Also the acting is very good until the movie's almost over, and then some of the seconds don't live up to the par of the leads.

So, if you like this type of art house comedy then go for it.  If you like any of the actors, the same.  If not, maybe see it at a friends house.",1141862400,4,767,3.9607843137254903

2240154,4,B0007RUSGW,"SIDEWAYS is the film that made pinot noir the in-wine for a generation and reduced once-chic merlot to near pariah status. I still enjoy a nice merlot but I have to admit that I now know about and buy pinot noir which I did not do before I first saw SIDEWAYS. (One wonders if pinot noir vineyards had an investment in this film. Hmmmm....) Paul Giamatti plays Miles, a hyper, twitchy would-be novelist, recently divorced, and Thomas Haden Church plays his best friend Jack, a laid-back, hunky, second-rate actor. Both take a boys-only, wine-tasting excursion together through the vineyards of California. For Miles this is an opportunity perhaps to contemplate his failed marriage. For Jack, it is his last time to get laid before getting married. Miles, the nuerotic nerd, is a serious student of wines and Jack, the shallow stud, is a serious student of women. One wonders how these two complete opposites ever became best friends. But, putting convenient and somewhat strange screenplay logic aside, Miles and Jack together find adventure, romance and redemption on the road. I have seen SIDEWAYS twice; the second time I enjoyed it more than the first viewing. It is a film that grows on you; a character study and a film with some depth, the perfect antidote to mindless thrillers. The scene where Miles and a recently divorced acquaintance of Miles, played by Virginia Madsen, passionately discuss what they like about wine is worth the price of admission. SIDEWAYS is one of the best films of the year or maybe the decade. Rent it or buy it but enjoy it with a bottle of pinot noir.",1140912000,3,1589,4.802919708029197

2240158,5,B0007RUSGW,"I watched this twice on two consecutive days, and then vowed not to watch it again for a while - I have a tendency to indulge in too much of a good thing, and it ruins the experience. As it was, I really savoured this wonderful comic drama.

The story concerns a would-be-novelist and wine connoisseur, divorced and depressed, dissatisfied as a high-school English teacher, and struggling financially. It's his best friend's wedding, and the two of them take off into Californian wine country for a last bit of fun together.

This central relationship is beautifully portrayed. The two are poles apart on every level, having in common only the fact they shared a room together in college, and yet they share a strong bond that goes deep.

Paul Giamatti's performance as Miles is the backbone of the film. You're always wondering what he's thinking, and even though for a long time you're unsure whether you even really *like* him, he immediately garners our sympathy, because his pain shows through in so many ways. He invests the character with all kinds of nuances.

Having praised Giammati's performance, let's not underrate his support. His scenes with Virginia Madsen are particularly poignant. The porch scene, in which the script gets heavily into wine-as-metaphor-for-life territory, could have been disastrously pretentious, but it works because of two perfect performances and because it is obvious the characters are aware of what's going on - she's trying to communicate with something deep inside Miles, while he's trying to fasten his seatbelt and avoid getting close. Their deep connection, her warm heart and his hurt are so evident.

Other delights in the film are the Californian landscape and Guy Rolfe's quirky, jazzy score. Payne is a great storyteller, and throws in lots of neat devices to tell us more about the characters and the story without having to hit us in the face with the script all the time.",1140566400,2,1927,4.972049689440993
2240159,5,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways is a classic film, because it perfectly captures the angst of a growing american demographic-  older singles who are still spiritually lost as they approach middle age. Many films explore the angst of the young. This movie is one of the few that explore the angst of those who are no longer young. This movie is so true to some people's lives that they will view it like a horror movie- it will make them squirm in discomfort.

Living in New York City, I have encountered many people like Miles, the main character in ""sideways"".

They are in their late thirties and early forties, and they are surprised that their lives are not turning out the way they were supposed to. They live in small rented apartments, work in boring jobs, have endured painful breakups, and wonder what the hell happened to all of their grand plans.

They are intelligent, but the hard knocks of life have taken their toll. They no longer have youth on their side, and they  find they don't enjoy the things that used to distract them when they were younger like drinking and partying. They have started to realize the emptiness of a shallow existence. They still want to reach out, but their growing cynicism makes it harder for them to do so. They are simply adrift and don't know where to go next.

Sideways is the story of such a man, Miles, played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti ( he was flat out robbed of not only an oscar nomination, but the oscar itself).

The entire movie takes place in the course of a road trip to wine country in santa barbara, where Miles and his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church, who is a revelation)are celebrating Jack's last week of freedom before getting married. They meet two women (Sandra oh and virginia madsen) who will affect each of them in surprising ways.

What I love about sideways is that it is realistic, but ultimately hopeful. Miles may be divorced, a failed writer, and a near alcoholic, but the last scene shows that he may still find the contentment he so desperately craves.

Though it could be seeen as a horror film for the lost middle aged, it is also ultimately a life affirming story for them. And that is why this film is a classic.",1140393600,7,2176,4.544757033248082

I do not want to ruin the film for any who have not seen it yet, but the scene which really angered me came when a female character, believing herself to have been betrayed by a male character, smashes said male character in the face numerous times with her handbag and causes enough damage, we later learn, to require surgery. If any movie had shown a male lead beating the tar out of a female character, critics and feminist groups would have cried out-and rightly so. But the film simply goes on as though nothing much has happened and the guy assaulted makes it clear that he will not press charges. What's good for the goose should be good for the gander: Female on male violence should not be treated so lightly.

2240161,5,B0007RUSGW,"This movie has got so many reviews that I'm just going to restrict myself to the benefits of buying the DVD. I really enjoyed the feature commentary by Giamatti and Haden Church - at times it sounds as if they'd just downed one or two bottles of pinot (not f-  merlot) themselves, but you can really hear how they get along and they give some interesting insights. Especially about the ending - ""Alexander's view was that.."" - it really quite struck me because in my thoughts it had always been the opposite. They sound like really nice people - Haden Chruch especially sounds like a vastly underrated actor.

The deleted scenes add another nice touch of character insight. There's an ironic scene where Miles, sober for a change, hits a dog on the road...

Women seem to like this movie less than men and sometimes it gets quite vitriolic comments but for me, it has been the best movie of the last couple years...I first saw it in Siam Square, Bangkok, in March 2005. Certainly not full house, and I was the one laughing most but I've seen it four times since and I just keep loving it. I've typed in Buellton on Google Maps and zoomed in full force on satellite view to check out where they were golfing. I've already found The Hitching Post.

His buddy is about to get married but decides that it's his right to go on spree of getting laid as much as possible before exchanging his vows.

2240166,1,B0007RUSGW,"Let me get one thing straight:  I don't mind offbeat films, the ones that aren't made by big-name directors, with big-name producers and actors.  I loved ""Waking Life"", ""The Mighty"", ""Brotherhood of the Wolf (Les Pact de Loups)"", ""Amelie"".  But THIS movie is in a class of its own.  There is nothing noteworthy about it.  The script is unremarkable and boring, the plot is murky at best, the characters are some of the most horrible I've ever seen.  How can one respect a man who decides to cheat on his fiancee?  Who consciously makes an effort to cheat on her?  And the friend who doesn't speak out until the end?  I'm sorry, if my best friend decided to cheat on HIS fiancee, I would NOT idly stand by and watch.

As if all this was not enough, the whole MOVIE is boring.  I don't know, maybe I just didn't see what the point was, but to me, the movie dragged and dragged.  I thought it was never going to end.  Since when did we start settling for mediocrity?  It's as though the screenwriters just took a crap on the papers, and said, ""Look, it's a movie.""  This movie is based on a book?  Even worse!

The ONLY redeeming quality of this movie is that the viewer learns a lot about wine.  But if you really want to learn about wine, READ A BOOK.  They have many on the subject.

2240167,5,B0007RUSGW,"First of all the characters in Sideways are not cardboard. In my life I've known each one of these characters, even dated some. Bet you have too!

Miles: Middle aged middle school teacher (exciting existence huh?) Carrying a red hot torch for his ex-wife who has married a man who is handsome, rich and successful, everything Miles is NOT. Trying to become something of consequence before he dies, such as a novelist. But such a bad novelist that he can't even describe what his book is ABOUT to Maya! So how's his agent supposed to market this mishmash and who is his readership? He's a failure, looking at more failure in his future. Who doesn't know a guy like this? Maybe he's YOU!

That's why he drowns his life in drink and that's why he's a wine snob- just so he can attempt to lift his station in life above what it and he really is. Miles can't write because he hasn't LIVED! He's afraid to live. He stands on the side of the pool called Life and just paces, too afraid to jump in and then has contempt for Jack because that dude climbs to the highest diving board and does a cannonball straight down into Life!

 I don't believe I've ever seen anything with Paul Giamatti in it before and I am an instant fan! He got right into the skin of this complex character!

Jack- Yes, the King of Pig Men! I've dated pigs like this and worked with them. Always on the make! Always the Big Lie when it comes to women. It's a pathetic game to them. Young women should watch this movie to see guys like this in action. But Jack was funny! Jack is an uncomplicated happy dog that seeks out life and bites big chunks out of it. When Jack leaves his wallet at the waitress's dirty house (if you live like a slob, you SHOULD be outed in a movie!), he forces Miles to go in to retrieve it. This is probably the first time Miles had ever done anything courageous.

Jack forces the sulky, reluctant Miles to LIVE!

This is a road movie about facing the things in your life that need changing if you're ever going to move ahead, instead of sitting, drinking and  moaning about it like Miles in the beginning.

I did not agreee with the scene of Miles stealing money from his mother or reading magazines like Barely Legal, but the rest of the movie is Real Life. People's careers and lives, more often than not, don't turn out the way we planned them as kids. Life happens and it ain't always happy ever after. But this movie does have a happy ending and Miles' life did make a turn because he got the backbone to grab for happiness instead of dwelling on his past failures.

It works on the big screen and on the small one in your bedroom. It works as a date movie and as a solitary adventure. With humor and sadness, Sideways tracks two men on a last tango in Napa as they guzzle the grape extract, golf and find love and romance.

- Lack of depth: characters that never achieve audience sympathy; they're purely cardboard cutouts.  (""Who"" would be the proper pronoun -- if the characters were even vaguely human)

- Trite resolution:  Asian woman ends up unhappy; the nebbishy guy gets the girl; and, the womanizer lamely hides his debauchery from his fiancee.

- Snobbishness:  Shots and dialogue which openly mock less expensive wines, tract houses, and almost anyone middle or working class -- except the central characters.

- Too much:  Unpublished writing about an unpublished writer; director casting his wife as the hot woman.  Shows many guns and then doesn't fire them.  (Chekhov would strangle the author.)

Yes, it's a poorly-edited, unendearing, pretentious, post-pubescent coming-of-age movie.  Worse, the fact that it rips off so many teen coming-of-age road trip movies makes it a retread to boot.  The only people I know who like this movie are themselves men in or near mid-life-crisis.  If you thought Sally Potter's _The Tango Lesson_ was a cheesy and poorly-done post-menopausal fantasy... well, here's the male version.

1. Jack has a fling with a fat waitress at her horrendously filthy tract home and her fat tow-truck-driving husband comes home and catches them in the act. Jack must run 5 miles through the countryside back to the motel nekkid as a jaybird, through an OSTRICH FARM! That's FUNNY! He said they were really mean.

2. Jack leave his wallet in the filthy house with the one-of-a-kind wedding rings in it. He co-erces Miles into sneaking into the filthy house to recover the wallet.

Miles sneaks into the bedroom while the walrus fat waitress and tow-truck driver are having some hot ""punishment sex"" and snags the wallet, but the fat tow-truck driver chases him outside. Watching the fat guy run BUCK NAKED towards the car and down the street with his manhood swinging in the wind is hilarious!

3. Since Jack has gotten a broken nose from Stephanie because he had no intention of getting serious with her, he must stage a car accident to justify the injury to his unknowing fiancee' (actually two car accidents because they botched the first one AND the second one.)

That's FUNNY!

This movie's comedy scenes segway seamlessly into each other, making it all natural, not contrived like so many LAME so-called comedies of today...say the abysmally awful ""Ron Burgundy""??!!

The characters are refreshingly deep and well drawn, so rare nowdays. I found myself wondering what would happen to these characters after the movie ended.

Jack would get found in the saddle by his new wife and be divorced because Jack is a ""men are pigs"" type guy and he knows he is. No excuses. He is what he is and always will be.

Miles will have a happy marriage and kids and WILL publish a book someday.

Stephanie will go on to more Mr. Wrongs and have another out-of-wedlock kid because she thinks early sex and pregnancy will snag her a husband.  Nope, never does!

I read about the author of this story who went through the same tribulations as Miles in trying to get published. He would have a book nearly sold, then his editor would quit/get fired and the new editor would throw out his book. So getting this picture made was a struggle.

And so it was for me with ""Sideways."" This buddy story of two unmarried men (one newly divorced and one about to be married for the first time) who spend a bachelor-party week in California wine country is competent and smoothly written/acted, but it lacks the pizzazz of a memorable movie.  This film is enjoyable and often funny, but also somewhat predictable.

Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) have been friends since college, and they are dedicated friends despite being caught in their own personal dramas.  Miles, a whiney middle school English teacher, is mourning his divorce and hoping that his 750 page novel will be published.  Jack is a former soap opera star now relegated to commercial voice-overs who is about to get married to an Armenian beauty; Jack isn't sure about settling down, so he wants to sleep with as many women as will have him.  Miles knows everything about wine (at least, he thinks he does), and Jack knows nothing and is barely willing to learn.  The two men meet up with Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh), two wine-loving friends who are as different from each other as the guys are.

Sandra Oh, in the smallest part of the four, steals the show with her luminous, sexy, no-nonsense characterization of Stephanie.  Giamatti's Miles grows on the viewer despite the pathetic and not always sympathetic nature of his character; the changes in Miles form the core of the film. Madsen doesn't get enough screen time, especially since her seductive monologue about ""living wine"" is riveting.  Church, on the other hand, plays a jerk, and it's difficult to do much with that kind of role.

The film turns on wine, particularly the delicacy of pinot noir, and the wine talk makes the film incredibly pretentious at times. If not for the sweetness of true love and friendship, the movie could have become mired in self-importance. Ironically, Jack's ignorance keeps the tone light and saves the movie from its own snobbishness.  It is Jack's stupidity and single-mindedness that moves everything forward.

This film is worth watching for the performances as it is more character- than plot-driven.  As long as you don't expect too much, you'll enjoy this film that melds male bonding with romantic comedy, thus appealing to both genders. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",1136246400,2,2548,4.964705882352941
2240181,5,B0007RUSGW,"Alexander Payne, indie wunderkind, has done what he can to cover the various population demographs in his previous works. Pregnant single mothers (Citizen Ruth), academic overachievers (Election), retired senior citizens (About Schimdt). Now he turns his social sights on wine-loving middle-aged buddies who are facing middle age crisis.

Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) are two former college buddies who set out on a wine tasting road trip. It sounds like a relatively simple-plotted or plodded movie, but it is the screenplay and the acting that makes this movie stands out.

Giamatti, in a career defining role, fills in the role of Miles, a failed author and husband, comfortably. With his hang-dog loser looks, he embodies every failing aspect of being middle aged. Jack, on the other hand, seems to have his pathetic dead-end life on a turnaround, with him getting married to a beautiful bride and standing to inherit his father-in-law's business.

Miles and Jack heads out for one last chance in their sorry lives to recapture their lost youth in typical ""Animal House"" college manner. With Miles as his reluctant accomplice, we see Jack lusting over a wine pourer (Sandra Oh) and Miles, pondering over Maya (Virginia Madsen in a comeback mode).

Ultimately, even though the focus early on is on Jack's hedonistic exploits, it is really about Miles, and his inner journey towards self-reflection and redemption.

Even though, the DVD looks great with its green slip cover, the special features were a little tad disappointing. Aside from the obligatory commentaries (which are quite funny!) and deleted scenes, the making-of-featurette does not shed any light. The picture transfer here is tip-top. The soft focused reflections of the California sunshine is perfectly captured in context of the copious amount of footage of wine drinking and grapes.",1136073600,5,1878,5.2675585284280935

Meanwhile, all Jack wants to do is get laid and he wants Miles to help him in this endeavor. Don't worry ladies, most guys aren't like this (but I'm sure a few are). Both play their parts well, however Giamatti does such a good job and is very believable. Church's part isn't nearly as demanding. Miles meets Maya, (the beautiful Virgina Madsen) but he's so wrapped up in his own emotions he can barely even notice her and I'm thinking man, you need to pull yourself out of your hole and do anything you can to get this woman. She would be the best thing that could ever happen to this guy. Well it goes on and Jack gets what he deserves while ruining Miles chances with Maya.

2240185,5,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways is an evocative film about male friendship, relationships, flings, marriage, careers, the approach of middle age, settling instead of realizing your true dreams, and, of course, wine.  Wine snobbishness, wine overindulgence, proper wine etiquette, wine as a prelude to sex, wine as an obsession, etc.  Wine is a character, a driving force in this film.  This isn't a film for everyone, and it most likely has appeal to the age group featured in the plotline.

The two male leads are former college roommates and complete opposites-Giamatti is an over-indulging, depressed wannabe novelist who just went through a divorce.  Church is an actor/playboy looking for one last fling before he gets married.  The two take a weekend bachelor party trip to wine country.  At first, Giamatti seems like a loser who is dragging everyone down, but then Church takes over as the jerk, the character we are all supposed to hate for his self-centered, reckless behavior.  The movie explores their friendship and their attempts at relationships with women.  This is a powerful drama with some very comedic scenes interspersed (including the discussion of whether committing suicide with further Giamatti's novel, and the scene in which a naked cuckholded husband chases down the pair, beating on their car).",1135641600,3,1300,5.241545893719807

It's sad because there are moments when the movie really could have been funny.  (golfing, walking drunk down the road, 'breakup' scene)  It is actually more depressing than anything.

First of all, it is mostly boring and is not funny at all. Secondly, one character, Jack, is completely unlikeable and the other, Miles, is just depressing.  Jack is simply displayed as an immature idiot who never shows any likeable qualities.  He just keeps using women, and this is neither funny nor interesting.  And Miles' pathetic situation is boring at best and depressing at worst.  What a horrible plot.  I kept watching it, thinking it would get better, and it simply got worse.

Church), who's a sex addict, gets in trouble and loses his wallet, which his buddy Miles (Paul Giamatti) has to retrieve for him.  On the positive side, ""Sideways"" is a pleasure to watch for Giamatti's and Virginia Madsen's (Maya) performances.  These are characters we can like, and they have true chemistry.  Church and Sandra Oh (Stephanie) are also very good, but I would have liked more screen time for Oh's character, and more exploration of the lives of Maya and Stephanie.  The concept of male bonding that might lead to the elusive goal of men growing up, set against the backdrop of a winery tour, isn't bad, but Jack and Miles aren't always incredibly interesting.  We need more of Stephanie and Maya.  Again, kudos galore to Giamatti, who portrays Miles beautifully with flaws as well as strengths.

This was definitely Thomas Haden Church's best performance to date. He was absolutely hilarious & insanely lovable in ""Sideways"". And if you're not familiar with Paul Giamatti (American Splendor) then you should know he's a funny, intelligent & thought-provoking actor.

Together, Giamatti & Church play Miles and Jack; two men in the mid years of their lives. (Who are embarking on a road trip to 'wine country') Miles (Giamatti) who is the wine expert of the two, prefers to be more serious than to let loose. Jack (Church) who is more laid back, decides he's going to have some last minute fun before tieing the knot to his fiancee back home. In this fun-filled, yet serious journey; we also meet Virginia Madsen & Sandra Oh's characters. Which both actresses were also very excellent in this film.

If you're at all interested in this smart, fun-filled movie that shows the pros & cons of life..then don't hesitate. This film is not a disappointment. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.",1134604800,,1116,4.597989949748744
2240191,5,B0007RUSGW,"I was a little surprised to see this billed as a comedy.  Not that I didn't experience many wry grins, tickling chuckles, and some outright belly laughs as I watched it.  I did.  And it is a whole lot funnier than most movies that are supposed to be comedies.  But this is not a comedy, per se.  It is a relationship movie.  It is a buddy movie.  It is a brilliant tour de force by Alexander Payne, who along with Jim Taylor wrote the script, and who directed, based on the novel by Rex Pickett.  On the basis of seeing two of his movies, this and Election (1999) I can say without the slightest doubt, Payne is one very talented man who has Hollywood by the proverbials.

Both the script and the direction were superb.  One might say Payne spent a little too much time developing character, but when you see the result, you have to say, it was worth it.  Yes, the movie begins a little slowly, just a little.  Everything seems a little on the ordinary side.  There is not much happening.  We can see that Miles is one of life's losers and that his best bud Jack is one of life's lucky guys.  They are off to the wine country for one last buddy time together before Jack gets married.

Jack is a sometime, somewhat talented actor.  God, I knew a few of those guys.  And Miles is a talented but somehow failed writer, a school teacher who has penned a 750-page novel.  Oh, Lord let me buy you a Mercedes Benz.  (Sorry that lyric just slipped in.)  He also reminds me of someone.

Miles recently (two years ago actually) got dumped by the true love of his life, his now ex-wife Victoria.  And Jack, bless his heart, is about to marry a very well appointed and very nice looking young woman who lives in a grand house in Palos Verdes (in the script; in the movie it's more like BelAir or thereabouts--which amount to about the same thing).  And so off the two go for wine and golf and the open road.  But be back by Friday night for the rehearsal.  (I'll say no more about that, but keep the word ""rehearsal"" in mind.  Those who have seen the movie know what I mean.)

All right I confess.  This movie hit home with me.  I have been there and done that in a number of ways.  In fact, the familiarity kind of put me off at the beginning.  I mean, I have been to France and I have drunk Chateau Cheval Blanc, and to be honest I have also drunk great burgundies with (God help us) fast food, although unlike Miles I took the food home; I wouldn't de-sanctify the wine by drinking it on the sly at a diner.  By the way, Cheval Blanc is NOT a burgundy and it not made with Pinot Noir grapes.  It is a red wine from Bordeaux made with Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapes.

And I and a buddy dated two young women many years ago and almost the same thing happened.  But never mind.

In other words, the movie is realistic, so much so that I suspect a lot of viewers will find something in it that relates directly and even spookily to their own lives.  Watch it and see.

Can you be too realistic?  Can a movie be so absolutely true to life that it...what?  Loses something?  Is too painful?  Is too prosaic?  Well, I almost thought that in the beginning.  But the movie is so well planned, so well contrived (if you will) so aggressively true to life and honest about human nature that I came within a hair breath of turning it off.

Don't you do that!  Don't give up on this movie!  It is craftily planned to reward the viewer with a most interesting and enjoyable movie experience.  This is not to say it is perfect.  Some of the wine dialogue is compromised because what is said must make sense to the general viewer while at the same time remain true (almost) to what afficionados of wine would actually say.  And yes, Payne could have cut to the chase a little quicker.  But sometimes the appetite is whetted when the meal is delayed.

In addition to a brilliant script and some very fine direction from Payne, the movie is blessed with some excellent casting.  Paul Giamatti is perfect as Miles, who really is not a loser.  Thomas Haden Church is exactly right as the attractive and confident, every-hustling, womanizing, marginal actor who will get his comeuppance in the next life, not in this one.  Sandra Oh provides a perfect fit as the Asian-American who falls heavily for American men who are not necessarily of Asian descent; and Virginia Madsen keeps just enough of her beauty hidden to be believable as the waitress with a head on her shoulders.

I guess I could give Hollywood the ultimate compliment and say that this movie is so slick that it doesn't seem in the slightest bit slick.  That it is so realistic that one never thinks for a moment that it is contrived.  To paraphrase somebody, the essence of the art of story, whether it be a novel, a short story or a movie, is in believable characters in believable situations doing the things we all do, but in a way that goes beyond realism to artistry.  If you can fake that you can make it big not only in Hollywood but anywhere there is an audience, a viewer, a reader, anybody who seeks to be enlightened and entertained and experience the catharsis that art can bring.

2240193,4,B0007RUSGW,"Director Alexander Payne followed up his 2002 masterpiece ""About Schmidt"" (starring Jack Nicholson) with this fine 2004 film ""Sideways"".  Like the three previous movies Payne has directed himself, the screenplay for ""Sideways"" was written by him and Jim Taylor.  It's similar to ""About Schmidt"" in the way that it straddles the line between being a comedy and a drama, but ""Sideways"" is considerably more lightweight.

There are many positive aspects to this movie.  Payne and Taylor once again demonstrate their incredible knack for rich dialogue, as well as sly and occasionally over-the-top hilarity.  It's great to see former Wings star Thomas Haden Church get a role that he can really go to town with.  Virginia Madsen is also wonderful, delivering a sensitive and tender performance.

""Sideways"" does work very well as a comedy, but overall, it's not a full-blown masterpiece.  The basic plot really is kind of stupid and hard to take seriously, which makes some of the more 'serious' scenes a little eyeroll-inducing in context, particularly ones later in the movie featuring Thomas Haden Church.  I mean, the Haden Church character really is quite a knucklehead.

The movie also comes across as strangely incomplete.  Madsen should have been given some more screen time--like I said before, her performance here is terrific, and at the end of the movie, it just feels like we haven't seen quite enough of her.

If you love ""About Schmidt"" and ""Election"", ""Sideways"" is a must see.  It's unfair to say that ""Sideways"" is just another 'road movie' or 'buddy flick', but those remarks are understandable in the sense that I think it does lean a little too far toward the 'buddy flick' stereotype for its own good.  It's a very good film, but it feels like Payne kind of bit off more than he could chew this time around, and as entertaining and funny as the film is, it leaves one feeling a little unsatisfied when it's over.",1133827200,6,1930,4.916666666666667

1) It doesn't glorify cheating...

2) It doesn't glorify alcoholism...

3) While holding a big magnifying glass up to its characters' flaws, it doesn't, on the other hand, condemn them, rather shows them to be human, interesting, like all (or some) of us....

Well, you get the idea - it's a little more complex than some people are able to get, apparently...

Excellent wine country footage, and great winetasting ephemera as well. It manages to both satirize and glorify the wine world at the same time.

Sure, there were moments of black humor, gorgeous shots of vineyards, and poetic passages about wine, but basically, the entire movie is shot in a dingy cafe near the vineyards, and is a glorified look at cheating. They call it such a wonderful indie movie, such a great look at vineyards and winemaking, but I tell you, that is not true.

Jack, who is mere days away from getting married, spends a good week banging his heart with a poor girl that has no idea he is about to get married, then he leaves her and goes back to his smiling fiancee, who has no idea what her loser soon-to-be husband has been up to. He also sleeps with an 18 year old waitress whose giant husband chases him down the street when he runs back to get his wallet that he has left behind. Miles, his best friend, is constantly moping about his failed marriage and crappy novel. Both of the characters are losers and the movie is 80% sexual infidelity, 20% wine.

I saw this movie on my first date with my now husband and it really depressed me. As the wife of a winemaker, I like wine, but this movie was more about cheating and the glory that comes with getting away with your sins. If you want to go see it, go in with the knowledge that you will be watching cheaters joyously romping around dirty hotel rooms the majority of the movie, and less than 10 minutes of footage of vineyards.

Paul Giamatti plays Miles, a struggling novelist and wine snob who is disenchanted with his personal and professional life. He went through a painful divorce two years ago and hasn't had a relationship since then. He's also suffocating in his teaching position and is hoping that a publisher will finally accept his manuscript. Then there's Jack (Thomas Haden Church), Miles' best friend from college. Jack is a small-time actor who is getting married in a week, and he and Miles decide to embark on a final ""guy trip"" and spend a week touring the California vineyards. Miles and Jack are as different as night and day, and while Miles plans on simply having a good time with his friend, Jack fully intends to make the most of his final days of bachelorhood and has only one objective: to get laid.

While Jack enjoys his last hurrah before saying ""I do,"" Miles finds light at the end of the tunnel with Maya, a woman who awakens feeling in him that have been dead for a long time.

Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a middle-aged high school english teacher, wine connoiseur and unpublished writer. Jack (Thomas Haden-Church) is a part-time actor and full-time ladies man who is soon to be married in to a wealthy family.

As best man, Miles, decides that a tour of California's wine country and an introduction to the finer things in life is the perfect wedding gift for his best friend. Jack on the other hand sees the trip as his one last gasp of sexual freedom.

Jack follows his loins and it doesnt take long before he's hooked up with sexy young wine merchant, Stephanie (Sandra Oh). It's hard to imagine why Miles remains loyal to Jack after the groom-to-be avoids his fiance's calls and convinces himself he is in love with his fling.

Stephanie is unaware of Jack's situation and the ongoing disception threatens not only his impending marriage but also Miles' chance at true love with Stephanie's friend Maya (Virginia Madsen).

Paul Giamatti channels the insecure Miles as he makes us feel for the sensativity of his character without necessarily pitying him. His performance is of grange quality and it would be no exaggeration to say that he saves this film from medicroty.

To his credit Thomas Haden-Church brings the sleazy and shallow Jack to life even if the end result is a largely unlikable character.

Both Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh are fantastic as the sassy and intelligent women that become entangled in the lives of Jack and Miles, although in reality it's hard to imagine women like them ending up with guys like these.

Paul Giamatti's performance would be his best if there wasn't a movie out there by the name of ""American Splendor.""  Thomas Haden Church, though, is the reason that this movie really works.  Rather than playing a letcherous, narcissistic, idiot with no redeeming traits, Church's portrayal of Jack makes him letcherous, narcissistic and stupid, while still leaving room for the viewers to like him.  The result is that you find yourself cheering for a character whose behavior would warrant complete disgust.

But isn't that what life is all about?  People do not live their lives as protagonists, love interests, and villains.  By having the courage to create four central characters that are all lovable, admirable and flawed individuals, this movie offers up a slice of life that will continue to affect you long after watching it.

The only film in recent memory that compares is Lost in Translation, which is also about the development of two very real people over a short period of time.  The critical difference between that piece and this one is that Lost in Translation captured its two characters in an unfamiliar environment.

2240205,5,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways starts off like your typical behavioral comedy. We meet the main characters and become familiar with their little eccentricities as they go through the motions of a normal miserable day. We meet Miles, a forty-something wine enthusiast who really makes an effort to be friendly to the people around. It's dishonest, and we can see that easily. But there's something about the way he makes small talk which makes him easy to empathize with from the get-go.

His friend Jack is about to be married. Like Miles, Jack is kind to those around him. But where Miles seems more miserably isolated, Jack is an egotistical jerk. Still, like all great egotistical jerks in comedies, we secretly want to be like him, to carry that confidence that eludes us. We want to be antiheroes.

Before Jack's wedding, Miles and Jack decide to take a week-long trip to wine-country. On the way, they stop at the home of Miles' mother, a sweet lady whose good intentions often lead to more misery. During dinner, Miles excuses himself to steal about $1000 from his mother's bedroom. This is a shock, but typical of the way children exploit their parents. Miles needed the money for the trip. We see the shame in his eyes, but also the helplessness. He seems beyond the point of redemption, but from what exactly?

When he returns to dinner we find out. Like all mother's she tells Miles that he needs to get married, but while our brains are processing this cliche she continues one word longer than expected, saying ""You should get married again."" Suddenly all the pieces fall into place, and we understand how he came to be so heartbroken.

There's something about Miles that I really connected with. He just wants to have a peaceful weekend, but circumstance demands that he puts up Jack's bullsh*t antics. The film never feels like it's exploiting Jack for comedic effect, but his utter lack of inhibition allows us to greater experience Miles' listlessness. He lives from wine sample to wine sample, percieving a poetry in the taste that no one else can appreciate. This is the one thing that keeps him going, but it also keeps him isolated from those around him.

In a pivotal scene in the film, Miles ""drinks and dials"" his ex-wife who, as cruel fate would have it, has remarried. The lenswork in this scene awed me beyond belief my first time viewing it. Miles paces as he talks on the phone, to and from the camera's point of view. He stays in focus, but his his movements cause the background to drift between different levels of focus. As well as offering an intimite look at Miles' detachment from the world, it also gave the distinct impression of being drunk.

A lot of people call Sideways overrated, but the way I see it, they just have an underdeveloped pallette and can't appreciate its bittersweet taste. In my opinion, this is the best film of 2004 (Kill Bill: Volume 2 is inferior unless combined with Volume 1).",1131062400,7,2918,4.700587084148728
2240206,3,B0007RUSGW,"It's not often a film this close to mediocre gets nominated for Oscar consideration. Most buddy films like this one -- including ""Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion"" and ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" -- are viewed as two and a half star films.

This one, for whatever reason, was given far more consideration by the Hollywood establishment and was nominated for an Oscar for best picture. Why would that happen? Most people know the films that are most heavily-promoted get the most nominations, meaning this film must have won the promotion award.

Also, this fantasy about two middle aged slackers resonated with the wine-drinking establishment in L.A. and probably seemed to them like some kind of reality. This seems reasonable since the characters they projected -- an actor and failing writer -- are the archtype cliches from New York and Hollywood films. These characters are perhaps more representative of the Hollywood establishment than any other.

Whatever the case, there is nothing outstanding in this movie except for one funny scene crashing a car. There were some nice scenes and a couple that were funny, but this is a two and a half star film. It is absurd to think this film so magnificent is ranks in league with the greatest films ever made.

There are nice parallels, if a bit transparent (so to speak), between the main character and his favorite wine.  THe photography is beautiful and creative.

The two protagonists start off on a wine tasting trip and one is a neurotic mother's boy, the other a playboy who has seen better days.  That's pretty much it.  They are one-dimensional, predictable amateurs who painfully try to link together two hours worth of film.  I will admit that I laughed-twice.  But it was nothing more funny than you could have seen on any sitcom.

This is all the more remarkable when you consider that this film was nominated for Oscars, critically praised to the heavens, and reviewed as the ""best movie of the year!""

2240217,4,B0007RUSGW,"I have a soft spot for dialogue driven movies, as I find those tend to be more about people and less about situation. I like movies where the characters are trivial in a way, completely believable, exactly like people we know, doing things that are mundane yet exciting. ""Sideways"" fits all these bills and that's pretty much why it is one of the best films I've seen lately.

Long story short, it tells the story of two life-long friends, Miles and Jack, who embark on a week long road trip to California's wine country just as the latter is about to get married. This is all fine and dandy, except Jack is not only looking for the first chance of getting laid, he's also trying to get Miles laid too.

What happens during the trip I'm not going to tell you as I'd be simply ruining the film for those who haven't seen it yet. Suffice to say that when the ending credits rolled I felt like I could keep on following the lives of these two for a long time. Miles and Jack could be you and me while the girls they met are perfect examples of the proverbial ""girls next door"".

If you like independent movies that feature interesting yet ordinary characters and are heavily based upon dialogue, then this film is definitely for you. I must admit that upon second viewing, it wasn't as exciting as the first time, but that's not to degrade my opinion of this fantastic film. The surprise factor is important and the fun is all in unraveling the adventures these two guys come across. I laughed more the second time, though.",1128816000,3,1520,4.440860215053763
2240218,4,B0007RUSGW,"Alexander Payne`s ""Sideways"" is what is known in the movie business as a ""Little Movie That Could,"" a low budget, independent film without major stars or dazzling special effects that, nevertheless, achieves a measure of success at the box office and, in this case at least, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture of the year.

Based on the novel by Rex Pickett, ""Sideways"" tells the story of two middle-aged men, Miles and Jack, who head to the wine country of Central California for one final fling before Jack gets married.  Miles is an aspiring writer whose recent failures in life have left him bruised, cynical and deeply depressed.  In fact, he feels like a loser on two fronts, both as an author and as a husband, for he has yet to have a single work of his published, and he has recently gotten divorced from a woman whom he obviously still loves deeply and whom he can't quite seem to let go of.  The one aspect of life in which Miles really seems to excel and in which his passion is given free rein is his connoisseurship of fine wine.  His buddy, Jack, is a has-been TV actor who has spent the last few years doing voiceover work for pharmaceutical commercials.  Jack wants his final week as a bachelor to be a non-stop orgy of wine, women and song, but Miles prefers a quiet week of three parts wine tasting to one part self pity.

Like a rare, vintage Pinot Noir, ""Sideways"" is a film best appreciated by those with a finely developed taste for the subtle and offbeat.  What often happens with a ""small"" film that achieves an unexpectedly wide crossover success is that it tends to suffer a certain critical backlash from people who go into it with soaring expectations and come out wondering what all the fuss is about.  The ideal way to experience a film like ""Sideways"" is to allow it to sneak up on you, to let it catch you unawares with its uniqueness and charm.  But since none of us can turn back time to that particular moment of nascent discovery, we are forced to watch it through the filter of our own preconceived notions and expectations.

All this is preparatory to saying that ""Sideways"" is a very enjoyable little film for those willing to give it a chance.  Not only are the premise and the setting novel and unique, but the film boasts some of the finest ensemble acting in any movie of recent years.  Paul Giamatti, long one of our most talented and underrated actors, gives a performance of tremendous understatement and restraint, creating an entire character as much through facial expressions and body language as through dialogue.  Miles isn't even all that likeable at times - he actually steals money from his own mother on her birthday then leaves without saying goodbye - but his lack of self-image, his clear-eyed rationality and his puppy dog vulnerability win us over anyway.  As the playboy, Jack, Thomas Hayden Church reveals a layer of sensitivity buried under all that cold-blooded crassness.  Playing the two women who enter into their lives that week, Sandra Oh and, especially, Virginia Madsen provide a sweetness and warmth that contrasts nicely with these two emotionally stunted middle-aged ""losers.""

In a perfect blending of form and content, Payne and co-author Jim Taylor have created a tasty mixture of revelatory conversation, understated humor and lyrical camerawork.  So sit back, uncork a bottle of your favorite vintage and enjoy the aperitif that is ""Sideways.""",1128556800,2,3426,4.758445945945946

The two main male characters are neither charming nor funny, and the women are -- with the exception of one -- idiots who are so grateful to have the attention of these two losers that it's difficult to watch.

Well, all I can say - don't stop watching after the beginning - this movie really deserves to be seen. Giamatti's and Church's characters may not be role models but they are truthful and full of life. This is very true-life film in general. The genre is hard to define, it's just a movie about life.

Characters are very vivid, situations are real, relashionship is full of nuances, ""Sideways"" sometimes are extremely funny and very sad also. You really start feeling compassion towards the characters especially if you try to imagine yourself in their shoes. And especially if you're a man. Because practically Giamatti and Church personify here two types of men that exist on our planet. So anyway you can identify yourself with one or another. Both are lonely although differently, both are struggling to find themselves in life although again their lives and nature are very different. They try to find love and some meaning as all of us so I can't imagine this movie leaving someone apathetic. It's really touching and although it's not a tear-jerker sometimes you feel like crying.

2240223,3,B0007RUSGW,"Driving through the Santa Ynez Valley wine country over the weekend reminded me of Sideways, which we'd heard much hype about, but hadn't seen until just the other week. My overall impression is that it was well done, but I don't think it rose to ""Best Picture of the Year"" worthiness. I'm not sure how much of it I'll remember many years from now, except possibly to laugh about the cultural influence it has had in attitudes about pinot noir and merlot. I thinking the acting was excellent. Paul Giamatti perfectly personified the neurotic author-poseur wine-snob, and Thomas Haden Church captured the immature actor on his bachelor party ""final fling"", while Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh were great as the two wine country women who the guys hook up with. The direction was impeccable, with Alexander Payne not only getting great performances out of his actors, but beautifully capturing the setting, the odd juxtaposition of beautiful central California oak-studded hillsides, cheap roadside motels, and the Danish kitsch of Solvang. Payne doesn't over-accentuate the kitsch (which as anyone who's read Susan Sontag's famous essay knows would puncture its delicate facade), but simply shows it and lets it speak for itself.

So where does this film fall short? That would be in this bizarre story, centered on two rather repulsive main characters, one of which has overslept, parked in a tow zone, told a few small lies to his best friend, and stolen money from his own mother all in the first ten minutes of the movie. And he's the better of the two. Perhaps I'm a bit old-fashioned that way, or perhaps it's my idealism, but I found the deep cynicism inherent in the story unpleasant to take. And what's with that ending? It was so non-sequitur. I can only imagine that the original story had Miles dump his novel in the trash just before slitting his wrists, but the Hollywood execs said no, no, no, we have to end it on a note of hope. Well here's what I hope: I hope that Maya slams the door in his face and avoids getting further mixed up with that loser poseur.

Perhaps what was most off-putting (even disturbing in the sort of way that sticks with me) was the notion that this movie might be a deeply cynical commentary on life in California. Is that the reality behind the California dream, where everyone is an actor and everyone's life is an act, a bunch of self-absorbed amoral people? When an outsider (think Woody Allen) ridicules California stereotypes, it's easy to laugh and shrug it off. But when one of our own becomes disillusioned (think Joan Didion), the cynicism of disillusionment can cut to the bone. This was definitely an inside job, by someone who's way too jaded for my tastes.",1126569600,9,2712,4.780383795309168
2240224,4,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways tells of a weekend road trip shared by Jack and Miles - two unlikely friends who are also borderline losers - during a pivotal weekend of their lives.  Jack, an unaccomplished actor, is about to marry a woman he doesn't really love.  Miles, an unaccomplished writer and wine enthusiast, has already lost the woman he loves, and is on the verge of having his just-finished novel rejected by his publisher.  Though trapped in an existence teaching literature to unimpressed high-schoolers, and unlikely to make an impact with his own writing, Miles is buoyed by his wine senses.  (Especially Pino, the sensitive grape that requires lots of TLC; he resolutely refuses to even look at Merlot, which seems to be the Paris Hilton of wines.)  Looking for distractions, the two drive out to California's wine country for an antidepressant-free weekend of fine wines, good food and wholesome golf.  Jack - out of a mixture of sympathy for the downtrodden Miles and his own compulsion for pleasure - is determined to have both of them...serviced.  Miles is smart enough to see through Jack's plans - which include a passionate and free-spirited winery pourer named Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and a pretty waitress named Maya (Virginia Madsen) - but lacks the force of will to object to them.  Jack won't listen to reason - even as a failed actor, he's ruled by his actor's instincts.  Of course neither Maya nor Stephanie know of Jack's wedding plans, and Miles overlooks the imminent possibility that his novel won't be published.  Jack salves his near-dead ego by feeding his passion for fine wines -sampling the finest Pinot and also sharing his intellectual love with Maya.

Almost everybody in this flick loves wines (or in the case of Jack, he shares an emotional bond with everybody else into wines).  Happily ""Sideways"" manages not to become a movie about wines (like ""Year of the Comet"") as much as a story about people who are into wines.  We're never asked to accept the virtues of the vine as much as recognize why the characters have a weakness for it.  For its passion, ""Sideways"" is a soft-spoken movie that never becomes remote.  Not a laugh-riot, it does have its comic moments - mostly towards the end of Jack & Miles's strange weekend.  Giamatti works pretty well for a depressive character who seems to seek in wine what he knows he can't find in other people; Church also excels as another seemingly unsympathetic character - he lies and exploits, though it's obvious that he's the most consistent victim of his own instincts and desires; Sandra Oh rises to the occasion but gets little attention from the story; Virginia Madsen is a revelation as Maya, who seems to be as sensitive as Miles.

It's no spoiler to reveal that nothing happens as our heroes planned, yet like a glass of fine wine, we pretty much see the end from the beginning, and savor instead the taste left between the two moments.",1126396800,3,2914,4.807615230460922

I think my wife and I chuckled at exactly one line in the movie.  Maybe if I hadn't heard so much about how funny it was, I could've appreciated it as a non-comedy.  But as a comedy, it falls flat.

Other reviewers are correct that the acting was excellent.  Too many times an actor takes the blame for poor directing, editing, script, etc.  In this case, I think the film got a lot of kudos due to the fine acting.

The scenery is gorgeous.  My wife and I recently toured through some California wineries and the cinematography brought all of that back.  But I never mistook my good feelings about California wine country with good feelings about the movie.

All I ask in a movie is to give me characters, however flawed, that I CARE about.  In this movie, the main characters were people I wouldn't give the time of day.  All we SAW was their flaws.  In order to care, we need to see some good qualities early in the movie.  Some good qualities are revealed too late in this movie to make me think more than, ""Well, maybe he's not a TOTAL loser"".  Add to that the fact that I could basically predict the ending of the film after the first 15 minutes.  ""Formulaic"" comes to mind.

Review of the movie ""Sideways""

Have you ever seen Anywhere But Here with Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon? That may be the ultimate ""chick flick"" outside of Ingmar Bergman. Two hours of a mother and a daughter arguing. Yum.

""Sideways"" is like that. Only with men. Puzzling.

It is well done, and the start is promising, very quirky. But it soon started to try my patience, and by the middle of the film I was thinking ""OK, but what is it *about*?!""

The issue with this kind of film is that the characters have no external problems. They only have the problems in their own heads. And it does not make for very exciting story telling. You keep yelling at them: ""Just make up your mind!"" or ""Get off your butt!""

Sure, we may all have our problems in our heads, but *other people's* silly neuroses just aren't very interesting.

Don't get me wrong, I don't demand a lot of action, just a story. For instance one of my all-time favorite movies is Postcards From The Edge, and that is a very talky movie. But it has a story, and the dialogue is fabulous, quirky, and very funny.

On some levels, this movie delivers.  The cinematography is excellent, and the screenwriters knew their wine.  There are parts of this movie that are really funny.  But the movie never transcends the loathsome, reprehensible behavior of Miles and Jack, the two characters who are supposed to be our heroes.  Their actions near the beginning of this movie do not make them sympathetic.  Rather, they are established early on as pathetic middle-aged losers who deserve any and all of the bad things that happen to them.  Even though Miles makes a stab at redemption near the end, it's too little, too late.  There are some funny moments where we laugh at them, not with them, but then it's time to go back to looking at your watch and waiting for the the movie to end.

2240233,2,B0007RUSGW,"I finally got around to catching on of last years most critically acclaimed movies, Sideway.  All during awards season, everyone keeps talking how the movie should win or how it got shafted in certain categories.  So with all the build up, I had high expectations for the film.  And to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.

The film follows two guys around on one last hooray the week before one of their wedding.  The major problem with the film is neither male lead is likeable.  We first catch them in a lie, then we drinking and driving, then they stop by one of their mother's because it the day before her birthday.  Except the son steals her money then skips out on her before she can wake up on her birthday.  So before the first half hour is over, I could care less about the characters.  Thing don't get much better from their when they meet some girls on their getaway.

There are also a lot of scenes that go excruciatingly long while the characters talk excessively about wine.  The movie could have been cut an hour off its run time if they cut the unnecessary talk about wine.  There was even a wine montage that looked liked like a montage from the Partridge Family. Okay, they like wine, now let's get on with the movie.

The movie does pick up once the female leads disappear, but it's never a good sign when the first time you laugh in a comedy is an hour and a half in.  I think it is easy to see why movie critics like this movie as the main character is a fail writer, and I'm sure many critics can relate as they probably have a few rejected novels or screenplay cluttering up their closets.  And I find it odd how all the movie critics can pan movies like Wedding Crashers for its gratuitous nudity yet their quite a lot of it in Sideways.  And referring to Sidways, by nudity, I mean male nudity.  Full frontal male nudity.  A lot of it.  I was beginning to think there was a gay porn that accidentally got edited into the film.

In the end, I can't see how anyone who isn't gay, over the hill, wannabe writer, wine coinsurer could possibly enjoy this movie.  And if you fit that description and you decide to watch the movie, be sure to look out for cameos by George Bush and Donald Rumsfield.",1124582400,6,2233,4.332530120481928
2240234,3,B0007RUSGW,"You'll notice from the DVD cover that Access Hollywood calls this the ""Best Comedy of the Year.""  I'm not sure what they mean--there are lots of funny scenes, but this is the most melancholy comedy I've ever seen.  In fact, I'm not sure the writers/directors would even classify this as a comedy.  The characters are well developed, with two, Sandra Oh and Thomas Haden Church, as the shallow, drop-your-trousers-quickly-while-we're-still-young ones, and two, Giamatti and Madsen, as requiring some time to learn about each other.  Perhaps because Giamatti and Madsen get to explore deeper characters, they can shine more--and they do.

The filmmaking is nice, and there are some beautiful views of California's wine country, and some poignant moments.  To me, the most poignant is when Giamatti, near the end of the movie, finds out something about his ex-wife.  The look of diplomatic hurt is priceless, and something not many actors could pull off as believable.  Were it not for the trite overuse of the f-bomb, I could give this movie more than three stars, but after about the four-hundrenth time, it becomes redundantly distracting and loses its effect.",1124496000,4,1160,5.132978723404255
2240235,4,B0007RUSGW,"SYNPOSIS:

Jack (Thomas Haden Church) is an engaged actor fighting commitment, toying with women, and seeking some sophistication, while his morose English teacher buddy Miles (Paul Giamatti) is popping Xanax, hoping to get a novel published, and struggling to keep his ex-wife's flame flickering after 2 years apart. SIDEWAYS is a road film, following along as the pair take a trip into California Wine Country. Miles has visions of wine tastings and golf outings, while Jack sees it as his last chance to sow wild oats before getting married. Along the way, Jack finally learns the grass may not really be greener on the other side of the fence after all (through a dalliance with Sandra Oh's character ""Stephanie"") and Miles learns he may still find new love outside of his ex-wife in a fellow wine connoisseur, beautiful waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen). The flick won Golden Globe awards for Best Picture (Comedy/Musical) and Best Screenplay as well as an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.

WHAT I LIKED:

Miles' speech to Maya about Pinot wines that reveals his own character:""it's thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early, it's not a survivor like Cabernet..pinot needs constant care and attention"" (Scene 15)

Miles' epiphany with the '61 wine in the diner: I won't ruin the ending but I'll just say I liked how it didn't fully resolve, paralleling Miles' own unpublished novel.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:

The scene where Miles goes to retrieve Jack's wallet after it's been left behind when he runs away from the husband of the woman he's been caught in bed with (Scene 27). I'm sure some critics will insist it has to be there to show the deep fraternity between Jack and Miles but I didn't see it as being essential to the plot, more of just a device to show again how much of a screw-up Jack is. It wouldn't have really ruined the movie to leave it out.

BOTTOM LINE:

Even though all the high-falutin' reviewer types seemed to eat the movie up, it didn't have the pretentious aura many critic's darlings do. It's a genuinely likable movie. Kick back with a nice glass of wine and enjoy....

2240236,5,B0007RUSGW,"Okay, there are a few things I need to get out of the way before I write my ""Review""

1. Many reviewers say that the only way to really appreciate this movie is if you have had a midlife crisis, well I'm 15 and I just have to say that that's not true

2. This is definetly a Love it/Hate it movie. (Like the ""Suckways"" review below) Everyones reaction to it is incredibly Bipolar. Fans of Alex Payne's other movies (About Schmidt, Election, Citizen Ruth) will like it, as will people who like people like Woody Allen and David O. Russell.

Okay, first of all, the reasons I like the movie:

1. The acting is really superb.

2. The Characters are there. They aren't likeable people. The whole movie is about Men lying to women, yet these are people you know. It's very realistic

3. The dialogue is great, and the Dry humor is just about perfect. Me, being a huge fan of dry humor (Lost in Translation, Rushmore, ect.) loved that, theres also some just flat out funny parts (being chased down the street by a fat naked man)

Anyways, I don't think I really have to state the whole premise of the movie, just look down and you'll see it in every persons review. Overall, If you like movies like Lost In Translation, About Schmidt, The Royal Tenenbaums, ect. See this movie. If you like sad dramatic movies like Million Dollar baby, or ""thing go boom, me go 'Wow'"" movies like The Matrix Reloaded and Constantine. Please, do yourself a favor and don't see this movie, and if you do, do us all a favor and don't post crap like ""Suckways"" on here because even though that is clever, its just retarded.",1123891200,7,1596,4.408163265306122
2240237,4,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways is the story of two best friends, Miles (a neurotic wine loving depressive) and Jack (overloaded with testosterone), who leave on a one-week vacation to Southern California wine country ahead of Jack's marriage the following week.

The two men clearly see life quite differently, where Miles is bogged down in everything that's wrong with the world, Jack is just looking to have a good old time, in spite of the fact that he's about to get married. The movie focuses heavily on this conflict, which is intensified when the duo comes in contact with two local woman (played by Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen), and Jack has a wild fling with one of them. The main focus of this film is the dialogue that outlines the conflict between Miles and Jack, as well as the setting in wine country, which provides great scenery but also serves as the basis for a lot of the conversation and the direction of the plot.

This movie can stand on its own with the plot and dialogue, but it will be more meaningful to someone who either knows about wine (which I do not) or who has spent time driving through California wine country. Since the setting is a very key aspect of the film, familiarity with the location is useful. There is plenty humor in this movie, although it's subtle, and it's not the type of picture that will have you falling out of your chair with laughter.

I recommend ""Sideways"" if you're looking for a film with clever dialogue and a serious plot with crafty humor. If you like movies like ""Lost in Translation"" this should be appealing. I also found similarities to certain Woody Allen movies and characters, but without the New York neuroticisms.",1123891200,6,1665,4.656462585034014

Character development in this movie is top-class and the seemingly minor incidents in this movie would make any ""thinking person"" analyze the consequences of his/her decision. For example, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) are fond of telling little lies and this would lead to comical as well as catastrophic consequences. Miles is a depressed person while Jack is a ""harmless"" playboy who never realizes the consequences of his antics. These two unlikely pair creates an atmosphere of comical friendship.

In short, the story is excellent, the dialog is filled with witty humour and the actors were brilliant. This movie was also nominated for 5 academy awards including best picture and best director. This is unsurprising as the scenery in this movie is also breathtaking. However, I would not recommend this movie for action and horror buffs. These viewers WILL find this movie boring.

2240242,4,B0007RUSGW,"This kaleidoscopic movie has certain highlights: structurally well made, with the taste and enrapturing company of the wine: this emblematic friendship drink. Around the standpoints of this kind connoisseur, we assist to a  road movie about two extremely closed friends: emotionally they are separated 180o  . One of them is profoundly depressed since his divorce two years ago, he has been unable to forget his ex wife Vicky ; he is a literature teacher and waits for the approbation for publishing his last auto biographical novel. He decides to make a true gift to his friend : an ex actor who finds himself at the edge of the collective forgetfulness, his narcissism rules and sharps his behavior with the women. Both of them are too worried by the pass of time and try to revive their vanished university experiences. Along the road they will meet two women: both of them are somehow the mirror image: they are divorced and find in the wine a good reason to live.

The story maintains the surprise element in its two thirds parts: in fact our loser, isolated, frustrated and desperate writer seems to be emerged from the Woody Allen imagination: his memories don't allow to grow up and enjoy the little details the life gives us; his wine dissertations are cerebral

But the film experiments a lack of creative breath since the announcement of Jack's marriage to Maya. From that instant the inspiration's light lacks intensity and the story becomes predictable: the magic starts to vanish.

Virginia Madsen is terrific with this role that deserved her  a nomination in the Academy Awards. But we have to recognize and even celebrate the great return of the author cinema: there are some flashes in the script that remind me to the French filmmaker: Eric Rohmer.

2240244,5,B0007RUSGW,"It's always dangerous when you are late in coming to a small movie that has unexpectedly hit the big time -- your viewing enjoyment may be hampered by the crushing weight of expectations.  It's wonderful when you can be among the first to see small-budget classics like Stanely Tucci's ""Big Night,"" but I didn't get to see ""Sideways"" until after the Oscar nominations, the critics' Top 10 lists, and so on.  How could ""Sideways"" possibly live up to these awesome credentials?

Well, ""Sideways"" does live up to its billing, and it does so through one simple virtue -- truth.  ""Sideways"" is an extremely funny and insightful examination of two men struggling with their mediocrity -- one who is all too aware of his shortcomings, and another who uses a pathetic Peter Pan syndrome to keep at bay the harsh glare of reality.

The self-aware guy is Miles (the lovable schlub Paul Giamatti), a recently divorced middle school English teacher who's having a difficult time getting his novel published . . . or even explained.  Miles is awash in bitterness, but he knows deep down that he's a sweet guy once you get past the sour layers (of which there are many).  The ignorant guy is Jack (Thomas Hayden Church), Miles' freshman roommate from San Diego State and a mildly successful actor.  Jack is one of those guys who should be thankful for the successes he has, but is incapable of doing so because by accepting a given success, he is placing a ceiling on his dreams.

The ""plot"" of ""Sideways"" revolves around Jack's impending marriage.  Engaged to a rich beauty and walking down the aisle on Saturday, Jack gets escorted by Miles for a week of freedom in the California central coast wine country.  While wine, for Jack, is a means for getting drunk, it is a religion for Miles.  Of course, it's obvious to anyone who spends five minutes with Miles that he uses his mastery of wine as a defense mechanism (""I appreciate great wine, so I must be worth something"") - thanks to the witty script, ""there's just like the faintest soupon of like, uh, asparagus,"" has entered our lexicon of pretentious criticism.  Miles can use his focus on wine to avoid meeting people who could possibly reject him.

That's difficult on this trip, because Miles has met his soulmate, Maya (Virginia Madsen), who is a waitress at a wine country restaurant.  Miles and Maya share a devotion to wine, and Miles is continuously surprised at the depth and character of this woman.  The question of whether Miles can break out of his various layers of emotional armor to forge a connection with this delightful woman dominates the movie.

Unfortunately for Miles, Jack is as shallow as Miles is deep.  In a classic self-destructive move, Jack gets involved with Stepanie (Sandra Oh), a vibrant single mother and good friend of Maya's.  A pell-mell romance ensues, with the ever-so-slight complication that Jack hasn't told Stephanie about his impending marriage.  Watching Jack skirt emotional ruin while selfishly justifying his caddish behavior is a gruesome delight.

Through it all, the script for ""Sideways"" puts believable, memorable lines into the mouths of these talented actors.  Long narratives about wine reveal surprising details of the speakers, and each character receives a separate, distinct voice (this isn't a Quentin Tarantino movie where all the actors sound like Saint Quentin, or a George Lucas movie where all the actors sound like idiots).  A ""talky"" movie, ""Sideways"" never runs out of steam.

There is plenty of humor in ""Sideways,"" but most of it is reserved - you will chuckle more often than laugh outright - but there are a few gut-busting moments, as well.

""Sideways"" is an attractive movie, but it is shot with a realistic eye -- the California wine country looks great, but this is not an ""eye candy"" movie like ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" which looked sumptuous but had little else to offer.  ""Sideways"" gets the balance of visuals and substance just right - one can easily imagine Miles liking his own movie, and that is high praise.",1122854400,89,4037,4.848396501457726

2240246,5,B0007RUSGW,"If you're in the arts at all, this film will make even more sense to you. Certainly, two friends, both ""arts oriented,"" are at a crossroads. Miles is on the cusp of another wasted effort (his latest literary opus is with an obscure publisher, ""Conundrum,"" tottering on yet another rejection) while his actor friend, Jack, has come to realize his better days may be behind him (he's about to ""cave in"" and get married to a rather conventional, though lovely woman -- and, most likely, follow in the family business). This film is about their last hurrah; before possibly renouncing their youthful dreams of artistic glory.
The character of Miles is just brilliant -- funny, neurotic, self-loathing (and real because of it); he's like a lot artist friends I know. (Okay, actually, he's like ME.) His friend, Jack, appears more stable and ""together"" yet he too (as we later find out) is racked with insecurities and self-doubt.
In many ways, this is a coming-of-age, buddy flick; it's about making certain crucial ""adjustments"" and fully entering adulthood. In my opinion, the friendship is based on an unspoken mutual support; they both value the idea of clinging onto their artistic hopes despite the pressing needs of finding a way to support themselves and some kind of adult stability.
And of course the film is also about ""moving on"" -- and the loss of youthful male friendship. This road trip is, in effect, a wake for their friendship. As Jack intends to marry, both Miles and Jack realize (without ever mentioning it) that things will never be the same. Marriage is often the final nail in the coffin of friendship between men (as, often, with women). Later, there is even a quote from the novel, A Separate Peace, in which a funeral is described -- and in which the comparison is clearly drawn.
Anyway, a great film. A FUNNY film -- my review may have painted it as ""gloomy"" when it is not. It's VERY entertaining and lively. It's an unconventional, character-driven film for grown-ups that is FUN!
In addition to this movie, I also need recommend another Amazon pick, a comic novel, ""THE LOSERS' CLUB: Complete Restored Edition"" by Richard Perez, which deals with similar themes of loss and friendships while also managing to be quite funny, lively, and off the cuff.

2240247,5,B0007RUSGW,"Most movies, in order to be entertaining, resort to extreme unrealism.  There are space aliens and/or lots of explosions (cf. Star Wars).  The characters are completely evil or saintly.  The characters are incredibly beautiful and rich with fabulous possessions or incredibly poor and yet noble.  The events are incredibly emotional, e.g., violent deaths or long hoped-for births.

Sideways eschews the crutch of taking us out of everyday life first.  The characters are not unbelievably good-looking or wealthy.  They live in apartments and drive 5-year-old cars.  There are no explosions or murders.  Given these constraints one can still hope for a movie that makes us laugh, that tells us things about the human condition, and that makes us more sympathetic to the foibles of our friends and familes.  Sideways delivers on those hopes.  It is a great achievement.  Certainly the best movie of 2004.

After a while, you begin to believe this is a Californian wine infomercial masquerading as a movie. (Notice that they never give you an idea of the price Miles is paying for his beloved Pinot.) Then suddenly the two girls arrive on the scene, we see a certain amount of bonking and f***ing, and we begin to have a real plot on our hands.

There is one excellent sight-gag, when Jack decides that the original prang isn't sufficient damage to the car consistent with his broken nose. That is sheer Laurel and Hardy at their peak -- although Miles is more of a Buster Keaton than a Stan Laurel. My favourite instant in the film is the expression on Miles's face when he is sizing up whether he can make it to the dresser to retrieve Jack's wallet before the bonking couple notice his presence.

2240252,5,B0007RUSGW,"I think that it's truly the mark of a stupendous actor when you can't believe they're pulling off role that you're simultaneously seeing them in. This is exactly the case with Paul Giamatti playing Miles in this film. After seeing American Splendor, I could not fathom how the same man could so convincingly depict a Californian metrosexual, wine snob who is far more sensitive than the women he meets. Giamatti's is a heckuva talent because, on top of everything else, he takes the thoroughly beaten clich&eacute; of unpublished layabout writer and morphs it into a believable role, or as his friend says, which so aptly describes his life: ""They think you're a writer."" If I would have read the description of his character on paper, there would be no way that I'd even be slightly interested in him, but in this movie you cannot help but care throughout.

The film definitely has an avant-guard feel with its early double, triple, and quadruple feature frames and camera angles. The landscape of the wine country is marvelous so the physical setting could not be improved upon. Authenticity is the most accurate word for the film making. The actors look like real people and so does everybody else. When Miles calls his ex-wife via a payphone, her voice legitimately sounds as if we're listening to it through an obsolete receiver.

The only real quandary I had when watching Sideways is just how Thomas Haden Church, who plays Jack, ever became best friends with Miles in the first place even if they were college roommates. Church is a wooden, shallow Ken doll who just wants to have a good time and forget that he's getting married; whereas, Miles wishes he were still married. The one is a connoisseur of outstanding wine while the other just wants to know what the alcohol content is.

Virginia Madsen is the sister of Michael Madson and she looks far younger than her real age. Speaking of which, it was a fine idea to use older, mature looking actors in this film because there are few wine enthusiasts in their early twenties. A particularly well-done, and uncommon, scene occurs when Miles projects his own personality onto the Pino grape. He seems to have no idea that he is doing it but, in Madsen's eyes, we can see that she comprehends.

However the film is quite easy to watch and the sadness is its beauty.  The characters are all flawed and foolish and above all - realistic portrayals of actual people we know in life, perhaps even ourselves.

The film is absolutely hilarious and the characters are so wonderful that the saddness that does pervade the movie is cleansed with great hope.  This film really reminded me of some of those fantastic greek tragedies we all read in college.

2240261,4,B0007RUSGW,"Alexander Payne is fast becoming one of the most interesting film directors in the business. His previous films Election and About Schmidt are light social commentary comedies. His latest, Sideways, is no different.

Sideways tells the story of two middle aged men, one a middle school Social Studies teacher named Miles Raymond played by Paul Giamatti, and the other an actor named Jack played by Thomas Haden Church. Jack is supposedly getting married in a week, while Miles is still suffering from a two year old divorce. The two men go on a trip through the wine counties of California on a wine-tasting tour that Miles is an expert at. Along the way, they meet the humble, charming waitress Maya, played by Virginia Madsen, and the wild single mother Stephanie, played by Sandra Oh. Jack has a dirty plan of enjoying one last sexual fling before he ties the knot and at the same time show his depressed buddy Miles that life is still worth looking into and enjoying by trying to hook him up with Maya. Miles becomes outraged with Jack's disloyalty and at the same time his own struggles to fall in love again.

With funny dialogue and the Alexander Payne style of realism, Sideways succeeds in making a connection with the audience. Even if you are not a middle aged person, you will still enjoy watching Church and Giamatti in their ridiculous and sometimes absurd shenanigans.

2240263,5,B0007RUSGW,"First off, the basic story and the superb acting have been covered by most everyone else that has posted reviews here.

So instead, I thought I'd cover the ""secret"" items on the DVD. There are actually about 30 minutes of fun items that await you if you can find them!  Unfortunately, they can't be found by just clicking on an item on the menu. Instead, you have to jump to a subsequent ""title"" on the disc to see them.

So what are you missing? 2 fun items.

1) A fake behind-the-scenes video on production 'overrun' costs that is about 16 minutes long. In this short feature someone is hired by 20th Century Fox to drive (and use his videocamera) to check out the set of the SIDEWAYS production area. His mission: find out why the movie is over budget when those working in the movie are putting in shortened work days. As I stated, it's all done for fun and it's worth a look.

and

2) A series of funny bloopers and shots of the crew on location, running about 14 minutes in length. There are quite a few fun items here. Definitely worth a look.

Why these were made so hard to find on the disc I don't know, but  if you've got the DVD, pop it in and find them. They're very enjoyable.",1121040000,,1190,4.257777777777778

2240265,5,B0007RUSGW,"Two former college room-mates, now entering middle-age, embark on a get-away in the Santa Barbara wine country.  Miles is recuperating from a divorce, and Jack will marry for the first time the Saturday following the trek.

At first look we notice the many differences between the two men.  Miles is , cerebral, introverted, literary and a connaiseur ofg fine wines.  Jack is a good-looking, outgoing, smooth-talkin, philistine, actor.

The two men have not acheived success according to societal standards.  Miles has already had had two novels rejected and expects the same fate for a recently completed work.  He teaches 8th grade, a position neither well remunerated, nor -unfortunately-well respected.  Jack gets the occasional voice-over gig and, his claim to fame, once had a starring role in a soap opera.  Now he hopes to secure a corporate position through the help of his soon-to-be brother-in-law.

When the old friends meet a couple of local waitresses, Maya and

Stephanie, we notice another common trait.  Both men depend  largely on women for ego-gratification, though this gets expressed differently according to each character's personality.

Miles cannot get over the divorce and his hopes of getting back with his ex-wife are dashed when Jack informs him that she has remarried.  His self-worth has been annihilated.  We understand that one reason for the divorce may have been Miles' inability to impregnate her.  Anti-depressants offer no relief. He is drowning in self-absorption, self-pity and when inebriated, he calls his wife for some succor to his bruised ego, gets rebuked and plummets further.

Jack on the other hand gets his ego stroked by womanizing.  His acting skills serve him well in this role, and he manages to fool Stephanie into believing that he loves her.  What's worse, he gets so caught-up in his lie that he imagines himself to be in love and even considers calling-off the marriage with his fiancee, Victoria.

When the truth about the upcoming nuptials gets outted.  Maya and Stephanie send both men packing.  We resist calling Miles and Jack losers; despite their flaws, we feel sympathy for them. So many men, who for one reason or another, don't achieve bourgeois success stand humiliated before society.  In such circumstances, they seek out recognition some other way, often through women.  As the movie ends, we find Jack at his wedding and Miles driving back to Maya after having recieved a reconciliatory voice mail.  But one wonders whether  Victoria and Maya will be able to mend these tattered men.",1120953600,4,2557,5.128329297820823

2240268,4,B0007RUSGW,"_The lives of Miles and Jack are typical of perhaps a great many thirty-somethings in our modern society- pointless and pretentious. These two old college roommates are perfect examples of failed adults and latent adolescents. They drift through life working sporadic ""careers"" while telling themselves that their true callings are really something more meaningful. They aren't. Don't expect a buddy comedy here- even though it was marketed as that in some areas.

_The film starts out with our two ""heroes"" heading of for a weekend of wine tasting and golf. It ends up as a prolonged ordeal of illicit sex and drunken irresponsible behavior. I know that sounds funny, but it turns painful. You see, both Miles and Jack are walking train wrecks. Jack (a would-be actor) is apparently a male nymphomaniac who is absolutely incapable of showing restraint by not bedding every woman he meets (he is engaged to get married immediately after the trip.) Miles (a would-be writer) on the other hand is a passive train wreck incapable of not being swept along by the actions of others. Neither is an adult (demonstrated by the fact that the trip is financed by Miles visiting his 70 year old mother on the way- and stealing the money for the trip from her dresser.) While the trip starts with high aspirations in the best wineries of the Napa Valley, it ends with Miles surreptitiously swilling wine from a paper cup in a fast food restaurant. It would seem that the difference between wine connoisseur and wino is less than one would imagine- the moral difference is even less.

_Oh, by the way, while there are a few writers' names thrown around there is never any real discussion of anything of a true, meaningful intellectual nature- this film is no ""My Dinner with Andre.""

_I primarily enjoyed this film because of its shining accuracy in depicting so many of the people I see around me. It shows their emptiness and lack of substance. A generation of pretentious, impotent chaff sustained by illusions of cultural and intellectual superiority.

2240269,5,B0007RUSGW,"Since it's tough to classify (it's not quite a comedy, not quite a drama, and not quite anything else) and  it rewards repeated viewing, it's probably no surprise that Sideways wasn't exactly a commercial blockbuster on the level of Jurassic Park, but that didn't stop it from being probably the best movie released last year.  Although granted, I've been a total Alexander Payne sycophant since I went and saw Election back when I was 20, so I may be somewhat biased.  There's just something he manages to put in every one of his movies that can appeal to just about anyone who takes the time to appreciate them, and this one is no exception.  Sideways is certainly far from the twisted and violent fare I typically patronize, but no matter.  I also hate wine, which occupies a good deal of the focus in this movie, but that proved to be nothing more than a minor stumbling block as well.  This is, to put it simply, a brilliant movie, sometimes not all that easy to watch but in the end all the better for it.  Those accustomed to movies with tidy plots and unambiguous endings will probably find themselves disappointed with this one, but I actually found its irregular rhythms and relaxed pace to be a welcome deviation from the norm.  Sideways is filled with open spaces, uncomfortable silences, and some truly painful moments, but it's also filled with hilarious, deadpan dialogue, occasionally unlikable but persistently believable characters, and random bits of outrageous slapstick humor and unforgettable imagery.  At its best, this movie perfectly captures the boredom, frustration, and mounting indignities of lives that don't turn out the way we think they will.  Not to mention, it further demonstrates Payne's genius when it comes finding meaning and hilarity in the lives of completely ordinary people.

Payne has long since demonstrated a knack for crafting characters who are deeply flawed but strangely sympathetic at the same time, and in Miles Raymond he may have his best protagonist yet.  Played in note-perfect fashion down to the minutest facial expression by Paul Giamatti, Miles is a pudgy bundle of nerves, hangups, and regrets who could turn a trip to the bathroom into an occasion for negativity and self-loathing.  This guy is, for lack of a better term, a tool, but at the same time he's the kind of tool you can easily find yourself sympathizing with, even rooting for, in spite of his many less-than-stellar qualities.  Stuck teaching English to eighth-graders while he tries to get his mammoth novel published, and still trying to get over his three-year-old divorce, Miles is rocketing towards middle age and clearly primed for a blowup.  At more than one point in the movie, I found myself thinking Miles was a prime candidate to be found dangling at the end of a rope in his bachelor pad by the end.

It's against this backdrop that Miles embarks on a weeklong bachelor-party trip to California wine country with Jack (Thomas Haden Church), his mismatched best buddy, who's looking to score some action before his wedding.  Jack is everything Miles isn't: a laid-back, charming, seat-of-his-pants-living actor who means well but seems completely oblivious to the consequences of his actions.  Although it starts out promisingly enough, the trip quickly becomes an ordeal for Miles as his lack of anything meaningful in common with Jack and his utter discomfort in social situations become increasingly apparent.  It ends up descending into a tangle of lies, infidelity, recriminations, and resentments, as the movie explores such weighty subjects as friendship, love, and the meaning of life without ever being heavy-handed or manipulative about it. There are also plenty of classic comedy moments thrown in to lighten the mood a bit, a few of which rival even anything from Election in terms of hilarity: Miles's erm, vehement objections to ordering Merlot on a double date; his complete meltdown at a low-grade winery when he can't get enough to drink; his discovery of Jack violating a woman in their hotel room; and of course the indelible image of an overweight couple having makeup sex.

In a wise move, Payne decides to leave the camera on Miles througout the movie (repeating the device he used with Jack Nicholson's character in About Schmidt), a strategy that pays off as we get to see him at his highest and (mostly) lowest moments, capturing the mounting desperation and alienation that he experiences.  This is obviously a guy who has major difficulty connecting with people, a trait that's certainly not going to serve him well as he continues getting older and less attractive.  The only hope he manages to find comes in the form of Mya (Virginia Madsen, who's old enough to be my much older sister but still pretty hot), a local waitress with whom he manages to form an unlikely connection in spite of himself.  To its credit, though, the movie even leaves that relationship open-ended, as there's ultimately only a hint of an indication where it's going to end up, fitting the air of uncertainty that generally prevails.  The depiction of their relationship is kept pretty low-key, but in a movie that's generally as subdued as this one it wouldn't feel right otherwise.

Just in the case the movie isn't enough (which it should be) the DVD edition comes with a commentary from Giamatti and Church that just may be the BEST COMMENTARY TRACK EVER, even better than the classic Henry Hill commentary from the special edition of Goodfellas.  Too many director commentaries wind up dwelling excessively on the technical aspects of the movies, but obviously there's no concern about that here, as the two actors seem intent on just having a good time.  The tone of the commentary is mock pretentious and consistently self-deprecating, as Giamatti and Church spend two hours making high-toned allusions and ripping on themselves as well as occasionally talking about the movie.  At some points it's even funnier than the movie itself, which is saying something.  Not to mention, it reveals that Paul Giamatti is the son of none other than A. Bartlett Giamatti, the late former commissioner of Major League Baseball best known for banning Pete Rose, one of those little-known facts that are always nice to find out when watching a DVD.  Oh and of course, it goes without saying that you should pick up the widescreen edition, as the transfer you get with it is decidedly excellent.",1120608000,5,6429,4.953488372093023
2240270,2,B0007RUSGW,"""Sideways"" strikes me as a film that makes a big impact the year it comes out--but then over time becomes forgettable as the hype wears off. (An example: ""The Grifters"".) And how big the hype for ""Sideways"" in 2005!

Let's first start from where I am coming from in reviewing this film. I love wine and I love the California wine regions, including the Central Coast where ""Sideways"" takes place. The cinematography of the vinyards and rolling hills and places like Buellton took my breath away with nostalgia for that area.

The landscapes looked as beautiful as in some of the shots in ""Elvira Madigan"" from the 60's.

That being said, I have a lot of problems with the movie. I don't like and can't relate to any of the characters, except for beautiful and endearing Virginia Madsen. (In contrast I could relate to Scarlett Johansson in ""Lost in Translation"" so much that it hurt!)

Paul Giomatti in particular came off as a real schmuck that I had absolutely no use for; and I found it hard to believe that luminous blonde goddess Virginia Madsen would fall in love with someone almost as unattractive as the orangutan Limbo that Giomatti played in the 2001 remake of ""Planet of the Apes"". Just because he has semi-poetic thoughts to share on wine? (And when in a Hollywood film would the reverse ever happen: Attractive male character falls in love with frumpy unattractive female character?)

I do also agree that the film is tremendously mean-spirited--especially in relation to the pastoral beauty of the vinyards.

P.S. It's a well-made film, I admit. It just did not carry my interest all the way through, and only Virginia Madsen intrigued me with her fragile, romantic, heartfelt performance. Worthy of the loveliness of the wine-growing areas of California.

As the years pass I will almost completely forget this film while never forgetting others like ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"".",1120608000,3,1915,4.8919753086419755
2240271,5,B0007RUSGW,"I remember when there was a time we used to watch movies for entertainment, with good editing, good direction & excellent scripts; Alexander Payne did a good job with this movie & went back to the basics to create this masterpiece.

The only thing that equally harmed the movie yet made it a success was the hype. A funny thing with hype is that it raises the bar on the quality of the movie which makes it hard to live up to yet with all that publicity the movie has a better success rate. It's a no-win situation.

But overall Sideways does come out on top although it's not meant for all audiences (besides the R rating) you need to have gone through the ups & downs of life to experience what Paul Giamatti is going through & me being divorced know exactly how that feels (especially the Xanax phase).

Reading some of the earlier reviews, I've noticed reviewers branding Giamatti & Thomas Haden Church, as loosers! Well I don't know about Church but Giamatti is definitely not. There is a thin line between being human with feelings & a looser. People like Giamatti put a lot of emotion & feeling in what they do be it wine tasting, experiencing gourmet cooking or writing a novel so when something goes wrong it sort of eats away at their soul; its more like an amalgamation of midlife crisis, loss & low sense of worth. A deadly combination, whichever way you look at it.

There is no shortage of human emotion in this movie although I really thought Giamatti ought to have been nominated for an Oscar as opposed to Church; don't get me wrong I like Thomas Haden Church, I've been a fan of his ever since Wings & Ned & Stacy, he's good, versatile & overall quite believable but I think Giamatti takes the cake in this movie & a great choice for his role.

Verdict: Overall quite an enjoyable movie with some really witty dialogue not to mention the mini-plots within the main plot. It strikes a decent balance between good filmmaking & a modern-day romantic comedy.

Both main characters are pretty pathetic and despicable.  Who would marry either one?  I won't recap the plot, such as there is one, besides two losers bumbling from one drunken screw-up to the next.

Miles is a depressed, low-self-esteemed, would-be writer, obsessed with his Ex and a borderline alcoholic.  He wants to appear a wine snob and knowledgeable.  He so worried about his wine that he has lost the ability to enjoy the $5 bottle in the park, in coffee mugs.  (At least he knows that Richebourg kicks any CA pinot noir!  Riesling right next to pinot noir, next to cabernet sauvignon, next to syrah, next to chardonnay, next to zinfandel?!  Give me a break.)

Jack is an arrogant, washed-up soap opera actor, uncertain about his impending marriage - uncertain enough to go after anything in a skirt and lie to everyone around him for a final, sordid fling before the wedding.

The two female leads are decent enough characters (though why Sandra Oh's character would fall for that loser Jack is beyond me.)

I'm male, straight, married, well-educated, well-read, well-traveled, and I have made a serious study of wine.  There wasn't much here to interest me.  It had a few funny moments, here and there, that's about it.  Virtually nothing about wine, and what was there was about 50% wrong.  A lot of it was rather ham-handed (the scene behind the ""industrial"" winery; the scene where Miles tells Maya why he likes Pinot Noir - gag me!).  It thoroughly deserves its ""R"" rating:  sex, nudity, language.  The final scene is at least hopeful - probably the best scene in the movie.  The film won an Oscar for screen writing adaptation from a novel.  It may have deserved that -- if so, that sure wouldn't make me want to run out and read the novel!

2240278,2,B0007RUSGW,"I have only just seen the film, having been obliged to await its arrival on DVD with eager anticipation, as the Oscar nomination and several reviewers spoke so overwhelmingly in its favour.

Let me begin by stating that I am completely mystified by the film's positive reception and, so much so, that I feel compelled to air my views publicly. Although most of the performances are certainly acceptable if even excellent by notably the lead and the two main actresses and several of the supporting cast, I personally found it hard to look at the main actor's sidekick, who reminded me uncomfortably of Schwartzenegger with a bad wig. In his defense, I should probably add that he did the best that could have been expected from him with the disgusting part that was written for him.

Having said this, my main objection to the film, however, was its unapologetic, torrid subject matter, which actually propogates (and almost approves) of conduct so unbecoming that it left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.  The script also makes absolutely no attempt to excuse the errant behaviour of its main persona.  Of course people such as this probably do exist, but I wish to suggest that too many of their reactions were contrived and ridiculously improbable:  allow me to name the retrieval of the wallet merely as as one such example, but in the end, there are simply too many examples such as this, not to destroy the film's credibility altogether.

I was equally appalled by the script's suggestion that wine-tasting by apparent connoisseurs and uncontrolled inebriation may go hand in hand, not to mention its condonation of the sexual mores of its principal characters.  I am by no means conservative or a moralist, but do believe that conduct such of this in a relatively serious film, needs to be qualified to avoid creating the impression that this would be considered normal behaviour under the circumstances.

I was equally appalled by the shallowness of the script, the cliched camera work and its heavy-handed and its insensitive approach to life and people in general.

In fact, many scenes which were clearly intended to be humerous, failed miserably and merely managed to make me feel vaguely uncomfortable and embarrassed.

Finally I would like to end by saying that I find it almost impossible to believe that the film's reviewers were not influenced by reasons of their own.  I do not believe this to simply be a matter of taste.  As the film deals with the consumption of excellent wines to the extent that it does, it would do to be reminded that there exists a very definite distinction between good and bad wines.  Apropos more than a merely superficial inspection this film cannot possibly be considered a good vintage and most certainly one undeserving of its acclaim, the remarkable presence of which prompted this entirely superfluous letter.

*Sideways* isn't a great film, but if you don't like films with complexity and nuance that challenge the viewer, then by all means stick to *The Dukes of Hazzard.*",1119744000,13,842,5.007142857142857
2240281,2,B0007RUSGW,I felt the main character was flawed in ways that made me uncomfortable. The graphic sex seemed unnecessary and watching the full frontal fat naked man running down the street turned my stomach. Did I get all the subtle messages of the movie? Sure.  It was a very introspective piece.  Did I get all the romance about the wines and was moved? Sure. Can't help but look at wine differently after this movie.  But to spice up an otherwise boring movie with sex is just pandering. The only saving grace was Sandra Ho...she is now one of my favorite actresses and I hope to see her in more things.  This is one of those movies you either really love or really hate.,1119657600,12,661,4.39344262295082
2240282,5,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways follows old friends Miles (Giamatti) and Jack (Church) on a final road trip before Jack's wedding. Miles, a wine enthusiast and failed writer, takes B-list actor Jack to the California wine country, where he envisions them sipping pinot noir and enjoying delicious food. Jack, however, sees the trip as a final opportunity to sow his very wild oats before entering into the eternal servitude of marriage. As expected, the trip doesn't turn out quite as either friend has planned it.

The cinematography in this film was absolutely beautiful, with magnificent sweeping pans of the California countryside. As well, I really appreciated how the film, through the eyes of Miles, explored the world of wine and food. It was passionate and interesting.

Also, let me add my voice to the chorus of people who were surprised when Paul Giamatti was not nominated for an Academy Award last year. He did a great job in Sideways. What I liked best about Miles was that he was a contradictory character, like so many of us are. He did bad things, like steal money from his mother and lie to his best friend, but he was also capable of great loyalty, self-examination, and devotion. (On the flip side, I felt that Jack was almost a total idiot, with very few redeeming characteristics to his muddy name.)

I also liked the way that, although the story didn't end with everything tied up in a nice bow, you definitely felt that Miles was going to be all right, that he was going to make it just fine.

Secondly his buddy Jack is a complete jackass loathsome to the point of disgust.  There are a few lighthearted funny moments but they are few and far between.  This movie left a bad taste in my mouth and I can only surmise that with the glut of TV shows turned movies that any original script no matter how bad it is has the potential of precieved greatness.

Later I remembered that I have never liked Woody's Allen's movies for the same reason -- spending 123 minutes watching a neurotic whiner is not fun. On the other hand, if you like Woody Allen, you may like this.

Of course, Paul Giamatti is simply playing a role in this film, and it may be that (unlike Woody Allen) the person he is in real life is markedly different than the person he portrays, as was the case with Reese Witherspoon in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Election/dp/B00001MXXJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Election</a>.

If I could get my money back for renting this film, I would do so.

I didn't care for Paul Giamatti in American Splender.  This had less to do with Giamatti than my own distaste for characters and screenplays that whine about the human condition.  In Sideways, I got over it.  Giamatti is a very fine actor.  If you want to see the difference between good acting and poor, see Adam Sandler in Spanglish and then Giamatti in Sideways.  It's a revelation.

The events of our buddy movie seem a bit stretched, especially the lost wallet scenes, which though funny, couldn't actually happen.  Drowning your sorrow in wine, that could happen and most of the film is pinned on the idea that two opposites from their college days could drive around picturesque wine country, get drunk, get laid, and in one character at least, learn something about the grueling trials of manly life.  Sideways is not perfect, but it does have a nutty, aromatic, fruity bouquet.",1118880000,3,1145,4.880829015544041
2240292,4,B0007RUSGW,"Summary: Miles (Paul Giamatti) is Jack's (Thomas Haden Church) best man and wants to show Jack a fun time before he ties the knot. To cautious, divorced Miles, this means golf and a wine-tasting tour of his old stomping grounds. To Jack, this means sowing his wild oats before the wedding night. Less than a week before the wedding, and much to Miles' disapproval, Jack gets into a deceptive and sexual relationship with Stephanie (Sandra Oh). In the mean time, Miles begins to fall in love with Sandra's friend Maya (Virginia Madsen - yes, Princess Irulan), who is also a waitress at his old familiar pub. Miles tries to have an honest relationship with Maya, but finds himself getting tangled into Jack's scheme for sex, which includes furthering the lie about the publication of Miles' book. Miles is a loyal friend goes to great lengths to clean up after Jack, including fetching a wallet left at a one-night stand gone awry, and allowing Jack to wreck his car to create a cover story for Jack's broken nose - so that his fianc does not find out that it was actually belligerent Sandra who repeatedly smashed it with her motorcycle helmet.

Analysis: The film was quite slow, but the speed really allowed the viewer to get into the heart of each of the characters. I could feel Mile's frustration with Jack's careless behavior. I liked that the acting and script were very earthy and true to life - vs. pretentious with strings of one line zingers. It was the accurate portrait of ungodly, middle-aged men, trying to find their place in the world. It's a story of apprehension, fear, love, and love lost - all over bottle after bottle of wine, a sub-theme that tied together the whole movie.  There were some flashes of nudity and sex that lasted a few moments too long - I am rather scarred by seeing a flabby, nude trucker throwing himself onto Miles' red car to attempt to stop he and Jack from leaving the scene. Yet the nudity, too, seemed very human - no soft lighting or over-the-top romance scenes.

Sideways has a thought provoking aftertaste - I know I'll be thinking about this film and its character portrayals for a while.",1118880000,4,2139,4.6534391534391535
2240293,5,B0007RUSGW,"I browsed through 50 or so of our amazon reviewers' critiques (they are quite conflicting!) and realized an important distinction. If you are one who finds it difficult to appreciate the beauty and to induce light-hearted humor from the visceral strifes of aging individuals, people who are sure that they are beginning the downhill trend in their secular pleasures, then this film is not for you.

Sideways must be approached with the attitude, ""Man, I've been down in the gutters before and it wasn't good, but looking back now, I can smile upon some of my faults and appreciate what I now have today."" Like watching young babies learning to walk, it can be funny when they do not succeed in their antics and end up fumbling around. They will eventually learn to walk! Sideways is a movie about the process, the mistakes, and not the end result.

I watched this on a return flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco and was seated between two 6'3"", overstressed, sullen male adults. At the end of the movie, the three of us (and a large number of others on the flight), were laughing together and reminiscing about the characters in Sideways. Coming from the Bay Area, I can assure u that the demography seated on the plane was most diverse. Teenagers and adults of all ages seemed to have appreciated the movie.

Some will view Sideways as dull, crude (the director uses the female cast much like Hemingway does in his novels), or linear (the characters are not catastrophically changed by the end). Nonetheless, I assure you that it will not hurt to try out the movie!  Loosen inhibitions generated by critiques and forget the lofty preconceptions stimulated by adoring fans. Given 2 hrs to watch any movie in the world, one of this caliber should definitely not be overlooked.",1118793600,11,1778,4.762987012987013

I was very disappointed!!!",1118793600,8,255,4.404255319148936
2240295,1,B0007RUSGW,"After all of the glowing praise I heard with regards to this movie, I was quite disappointed when I actually saw it.  I thought the story was trite and without charm, the characters were basically stock characters (the pseudo-artist and the playboy), there was little character development and even less character growth, and the actual filming itself was nothing special.  In my opinion, Babette's Feast is a much worthier tribute to the joys of food and drink, if one can bear a subtitle or two.  In fact, it seemed as though the wine was a secondary premise in the plot of Sideways anyhow; mostly the characters chased women and lowered their moral bearings (if either can be said to have had any in the first place), before returning to the same old life as before.  Certainly there was no deeper examination of wine then a bit of pretentious name-dropping and ignorant gulping.  I took nothing from this movie besides a bit of remorse at having spent $3 to rent it and 2+ hours to watch it.  I found this movie to be unoriginal, artless, and shallow.  It is not particularly beautiful to watch, interesting to contemplate, or enlightening to experience.  It is a formula-picture about two overgrown adolescents whose opinions of themselves far exceed their talents or insights.  I know I hold the minority opinion about this, but I think there are so many better-quality films out there, it is a shame that this rather standard fare receives so much attention.

I would like to point out that my reason for disliking this movie is not due to the vices of the characters or to age issues, as other reviewers have noted.  It is due to the fact that I consider it to be a poor story, poorly told; I didn't care about the characters or the situation because the plot was obvious and fixed for most of the movie, and nothing else about the movie was able to mask that deficiency for me.  I honestly don't think that there is anything noteworthy about this movie despite the fact that it received a lot of critical attention.  It's a pretty simple picture, if you really boil it down: two age-old character-types run through a series of predictable scenarios and end up pretty much where you'd guess they would within the first 5 minutes.  Along the way, there is a bit of humor, a bit of despair, and a bit of wine-related banter meant to try to make personal failure interesting for what must be the millionth time.  My advice is to pass on this one, but if you must see it, at least have a few bottles on hand yourself.",1118707200,25,2521,4.571111111111111
2240296,5,B0007RUSGW,"I found this to be one of the best films I've seen in the past year. I think what you get out of this movie depends greatly on your age and your current situation you find yourself in when you watch it. I am 34 years old, and I would not have liked this movie, say, ten years ago. Ten years ago I loved the movie Swingers, because it had much more appeal for someone in that age group (immediately post-college years). What Swingers and Sideways have in common is that both stories are told from the point of view of the anti-hero (this is pompous literate-speak for ""loser""). Both are about someone who has been unlucky in love, having just broken up with their girlfriend/spouse, and the situation made worse by their respective best friends being brashly confident and handsome and thus bedding most any women they want to. I suppose most people can at least relate to the loneliness and self-deprication seen in Paul Giammatti's character (or John Favreau in Swingers), but the more so, the more empathy for that character. People in their teens to twenties might have a more difficult time relating to the situations portrayed in Sideways because they haven't yet experienced that pre-midlife crisis age, when it feels like your options have become desperately slim and your choices you make feel like they are final (as opposed to mid-life crisis age, when you feel like your choices have already been made and finalized, so you go out and buy a sports car to compensate for any perceived shortcomings). Additionally, the more confident and self-assured personality probably will have a difficult time relating to Miles (Paul Giamatti's character) and understanding his neurotic and depressed point-of-view. In the end, this movie isn't for everyone because it wasn't written for everyone (at least this is my impression; it's not like I know Alexander Payne). It should appeal to a certain age and disposition, but for those who can relate at all to Miles, it is written brilliantly.",1118707200,6,1990,4.855882352941176

The acting and casting are excellent: Giamatti, Church, Madsen and Oh are all very good. The story is bittersweet, but the movie has some very funny scenes. The movie is literate and intelligent. My favorite part is when the characters of Giamatti and Madsen discuss why they love wine. The movie gives me insight into an obsession and a world of which I am not familiar.

There are several scenes where the characters are talking, eating, drinking wine and enjoying life and each other. The movie works in part, because the characters seem to enjoy each others company. There is nothing I really dislike about the movie. The two main characters are not very likeable, but the movie works because the characters are not perfect or even good people. They are two losers and that is the point.

The DVD has extra features. The deleted scenes are okay, but nothing stands out. The commentary by Church and Giammatti is funny, but not very poignant. They really enjoyed making the movie and they have an enjoyable self-deprecating sense of humor.

Miles is a wine connoisseur, so his idea of a really good time is a trip through wine country. Jack's idea of a good time? Getting laid as often as possible before he ties the knot. Oh, by the way, Miles is funding their little jaunt with cash he stole from his mother's secret nightie-drawer stash. Are you in love with these guys yet?

Predictably, Jack spends the entire trip chasing women, while Miles never seems to tire of alternately rolling his eyes at Jack's antics and feeling sorry for himself because he hasn't had a book pubished and because his ex wife has recently remarried. Trying to milk some meaning from all of this, I wonder if sneering at Jack's jerkiness makes Miles feel like a better person by comparison. 'Cause, if you're stealing from your mother, you gotta self-validate somehow.

As the hapless pair meanders through Whine Country, hilarity keeps threatening to ensue (but doesn't). Miles drunkenly phones his ex-wife. Jack has a torrid affair with a single mother. Miles angsts over an attractive woman (Maya) who seems interested, but doesn't meet up to his high standards. ""How is THAT going to work?"" he complains, ""She's a HOSTESS!"" Later, trying to explain to her his love of Pinot grapes, he explains that he loves them because they are so delicate, very thin-skinned, and they need a lot of nurturing to bring out their full potential. He's obviously talking about himself and it's almost funny, but any hope of ""comedy"" is ruined when Maya listens with a straight face, hanging on his every word.

The plot wanders on, offering the occasional chuckle, but little in the way of enjoyment.

aside from the plodding pace this movie followed to it's 2+ hour conclusion, the creepiest aspect of this movie was that i suddenly realized what it was like to a be a white, upper-middle-class male cutting loose on a ""wild"" road trip.. not a pleasant experience.

basically, these two goonie old men go on a road trip to bid farewell to their freewheeling youth.... well that's the reason that the guy from ""wings"" is here anyway.  the other guy, played by paul giamatti, is this geeky, punched-in-the gut, kneed-in-the-crotch loser-type who drowns his sorrows in buckets of wine and wants nothing more than to meet a super lady and walk down the wine aisle in the grocery store happily ever after.

their hijinx and hilarity pretty much stops short with some of the close-ups of sweaty pores and unfocused camera shots that are supposed to make the viewer be all, like, woooo.... i'm drunk... or something.

where gonzo makes you want to eat all of the drugs in the world and wash it down with tequila, these old fuddy duddies manage to make even something as inherently radical as boozing it up seem lame and boring.

Jack's constant harping on ""c'mon, man! You need to get laid!' got real old real quick. And Miles' boo-hooing-lookie-at-poor-poor-pitiful-me persona throughout this stupid story just got annoying. You'd think the writers could have come up with something, anything, to break the monotony. I actually have a mild interest in wine and wine making. But even the diatribes about this in the movie got on my nerves. Miles shouting ""no one is going to drink any f****** merlot!!!"" as though life and death depended on it was another example of the fine comedy writing in this movie. Yeah. Now there's some humor for ya.

And the women in this story weren't really any better. Jack's newfound girlfriend allows herself to get emotionally involved with a man she barely knows and then gets mad when his secret is found out. Who knew that sleeping with a stranger on your first date may lead to some unpleasant surprises? But then, adding insult to injury, the writers of this crap seemed to expect us to feel sympathy for her, as well as Jack. By this point, the only thing I felt was a strong urge to smack myself across my head with a baseball bat because there I sat, waiting.........still waiting.......for the funny parts. I like Virginia Madsen in general, but her wine obsessions and lectures in this movie made her character out to be an extremly personalityless and boring individual.

Still waiting for the funny parts.......can't take it anymore. Fast-forward the last 30 minutes. At last, a mildly amusing moment. OK, so I laughed when Jack was trying to fake a car accident because he needed an excuse to tell his dimwit bride to be for his broken nose, given to him by his woman scorned, and the car missed the tree. The idiot deserved that one.

Gosh, don't I feel like the unsophisticated fool.  To think all of these years I thought Caddyshack was funny.",1118275200,13,3222,4.681978798586573

2240309,5,B0007RUSGW,"""Sideways"" is at once a quirky comedy, and a moving, sometimes painful, drama about two men approaching middle-age, struggling with their identity and uncertain futures. Director Alexander Payne adapted the screenplay with his longtime writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book ""Sideways"" by Rex Pickett.  They created a well crafted plot, and complex, flawed characters. And the actors provide superb performances.

Miles Raymond, (played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti), a somewhat nerdy, middle school English teacher and would-be novelist, has been unhappily divorced for two years, and is lonely, perpetually depressed and disappointed by his own failures and missed opportunities. He anxiously awaits a publisher's decision about the fate of his book, entitled ""The Day After Yesterday,"" while he prepares for a much needed get-away trip with friend Jack Lopate. Jack, (Thomas Haden Church), and Miles were college roommates and have maintained a close, if neurotic friendship. Jack, a fading bit part TV actor and total commitment-phobe, is getting married in a week - for the first time. Before the wedding the two 40-something schlemiels take-off on a road trip through California's wine country. Miles wants to give his friend a worthy send-off, a wedding gift, before he finally takes the walk down the aisle. An amateur wine enthusiast and snob, Miles has planned a week of wine tasting, fine food, male bonding and golf. Jack has another agenda. He wants to sow as many wild oats as he can cram into seven days. And he wants the melancholy, unwilling Miles to have at least one one-night-stand. This is so not your father's bachelor party! They travel light but carry some heavy baggage with them.

The two travel and taste wine throughout the gorgeous Santa Ynez region. The cinematography is wonderful and some of the rural landscapes resemble paintings. At a restaurant Miles frequents when in the area, they meet waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen), who Miles has long been attracted to. Jack is immediately on his buddy's back to ""party"" with Maya. His pushy insistence fills Miles with disgust and dismay. Then the men meet winery employee, Stephanie (Sandra Oh). Jack immediately hits on the young hottie and is successful!? However, he fails to mention his upcoming wedding plans to her. After 24 hours he does mention that he loves her and is thinking of moving to the valley, and, perhaps, buying a winery. Sadly he believes every word he says. Stephanie knows Maya, and the four get together for dinner. Later, while Jack and Steph are romancing, Miles and Maya talk about their passion for wine. When Maya asks Miles why he ""has a thing for Pinot Noir,"" his response is sad and self-revealing. ""It's a hard grape to grow. It's thin-skinned, temperamental, and ripens early. It is not like Cabernet, which can grow anywhere and thrive, even when it's neglected. In fact, it can only grow in these specific tucked-away corners of the world. Only the most patient and nurturing of growers can do it...to understand Pinot's potential and coax it into its fullest expression."" Maya, a wise and sensitive woman, who is studying horticulture at the local university, understands. Her response, a wonderfully poetic monologue about what wine means to her, is mesmerizing. This gem of a scene is one of my favorites in the film.

Eventually, after much character development, multiple adventures, plot twists, excellent dialogue, terrific humor, (there is a golf course scene which is hilarious!), many a bottle of great wine imbibed, and intense moments of self-revelation, the two guys, still friends, go home - back to reality. This is definitely a 5 Star film, nuanced, complex, with fabulous depth, seductive and not too fruity! A must see!

2240310,5,B0007RUSGW,"For me, it's the misty rolling green backdrop and the true of the color of sun -- or the fondness of my own memories over many years since gone -- that made this film work so well for me.  I'm a horrible movie snob mostly and, though lacking a nose for wine, I had to rent Sideways twice in a row.  Wine touring and the rural beauty of California fit with escapism like nothing else -- and if you need to run away, go to where your money buys you a little temporary pleasure at least, and a California dream at best.  Dreaming is what this movie is all about, along with great lines and great acting.  Virginia Madsen is the lone exception; maybe its the roles she seems to get or the lines that seem to lack sincere weight, particularly in this movie where the dream somehow seems to goes to black when she's the focus.  The other three play their roles with absolute perfection.  Bring a sense of humor and your love for wanderlust, and this movie will not steer you wrong.  Pragmatists just won't get it.",1118102400,2,1007,4.296296296296297
2240311,1,B0007RUSGW,"First of all, to defend the rest of the one star reviewers: I am, with no false modesty, an intelligent individual. I am well read, cultured, eloquent, and affluent. I don't enjoy summer blockbusters with their huge budgets and special effects, or movies that serve as nothing more than star vehicles for the most recent actor du jour. I prefer character-driven stories with deeply textured characters, complete with thought-provoking dialogue.

And believe me, Sideways had none of the above. From a completely flat storyline that went nowhere except into a series of dead-ends with horrible dialogue, to empty shells of characters, this movie was a huge disappointment and a monumental waste of time.

I don't mind so-called ""despicable"" characters when they are presented in an interesting manner. But these characters were just so uninteresting in spite of their reprehensible behavior.

And nudity aside, which I personally have no problem with, this film was just a huge exercise in tastelessness. Hell, it even turned me off to wine a little bit.",1118102400,22,1053,5.182352941176471
2240312,4,B0007RUSGW,"I really like Paul Giamatti and his performance didn't disappoint.  He is such an incredible actor that you really feel his pain.  I like the idea of the film and generally felt the characters stayed true to themselves.  I did, however, have some complaints.

I felt like Thomas Haden Church's character never got what was coming to him.  He behaves like a spoiled child, going from one disaster to the next, and then pouting when things don't go as expected.  He cheats on his fiancee more than once and doesn't get caught.  He still gets to marry his beautiful fiancee and never really learns anything from his adventure.

I didn't like the ending because it implied that Paul Giamatti's character and Virginia Madsen's character get together, but it's not confirmed.  I guess I'm a sucker for a really happy ending. :)

Warning - this movie will give you a wine craving like never before.  Try to have a bottle on hand...trust me, you'll want it!

2240314,5,B0007RUSGW,"Hollywood needs more films like this. Director Alexander Payne took a gigantic risk in choosing non superstar actors for major roles- Paul Giamatti (Miles) and Alexander Payne Thomas Hadden Church (Jack) and sending these two guys, facing various mid life difficulties, on a road trip just prior to Jack's upcoming wedding to a smart girl in San Diego. Miles is a failed novelist, sensitive intellectual and Pinot Noir quaffing wine snob who awaits news on his 750 page autobiographical novel which is churning around a small publishing house in New York, and looks forwards to a civilized, convivial week of good food and wine with his one time college roomate. Jack on the other hand is a compulsive ass chaser who wants one more bout of sexual freedom before he ties the knot. The friends' two personalities grate terrifically, which makes for some superb character comedy .

Sideways works so well because the characters of Miles and Jack are so realistically and intelligently drawn by Payne, bringing them from Rex Pickett's novel to the screen with thoughtful dexterity. Every man at some point in his life has been a Miles (self pitying, depressed, anxious about his failings with women) or a Jack (anxious to get his rocks off), or if not has encountered men like this.

The comedy is a mixture of high farce (the scenes when Jack is playing the field as ferociously as he can in his final pre- marital days), and the more poignant comedy of self absorbed anquish (such as when Miles pours the tasting bucket in a wine tasting bar over himself in a climactic moment of self loathing and mental collapse). The romantic sagas of the two guys perfectly reflects their characters. Jack wastes no time in going to bed with Stephanie (played by Sandra Oh who is one of those women with a unique, indefinable sex appeal) whereas Miles is more unnerved by the whole process and needs to be jolted into action by the almost implausibly tolerant Maya (Virginia Madsen). The sexual tension between them allows some poignant scenes. Miles, unable to communicate his emotions in bare form uses wine as a metaphor for his existence - he adores Pinot Noir because it is a delicate grape that requires nurturing, not a survivor in all situations like the more common Cabernet (which reads obviously as a metaphor for the more sexually confident Jack).

If there is a criticism, it is that the characters are perhaps too crassly drawn as representing the various totems of male mid life crisis too one sidedly, and the extras on the DVD are missable - a trite, self indulgent commentary on the movie by Giamatti and Hadden Church and some deleted scenes. But Sideways is an important film that suggests there is a potential for quality filmaking in contemporary Hollywood that doesn't solely involve one dimensional glamour models thrashing around in formulaic plots that touch the subtleties of human relationships not one jot.",1118016000,3,2920,4.883064516129032

Jack is just a womanizer.  It's hard to see how these two would hang out together. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did.  The whole scene with Cammi was just not necessary.

But I digress. I really just want to comment on many of those reviewing the film here. To those who expressed disdain for the film because it shows 'poor morals', etc., or who were offended by the nudity, I say, Get Thee to a Nunnery!, or similar establishment. Why are so many Americans still such 19th-Century prudes? Why do Conservatives always want to make everything into a goddamn morality play?? These people should watch the news more often, to see what the President is doing to our country - now THAT'S offensive! Next you'll be banning ""Sideways"" from being shown to patients in a ""persistent vegetative state"", or in the presence of stem cells, or God knows what, simply because you can't let the act of censorship reside in the individual.

But again I digress! To those who express contempt for anyone who dares to say that ""Sideways"" is less than a cinematic masterpiece, I would say you need to get (your mind) out more. Liberals (at least that's how your posturing sounds, to mix metaphors) do themselves no favors, and win no converts to watching this film, by making unfavorable references to 'rural folk', etc. Adopting a superior tone simply because you think this was a superior film simply shows how thin and weak your argument really is. Readers will have to take my word for it, but I am well-read / educated / traveled, and also really love wine, and I'm telling you this film is nothing special. Some of your antagonistic reviews lead me to recommend that you skip some movies and read up on syllogistic logic and rhetoric instead.

And to both ""sides"" of the debate I would say, frickin' relax - it's just a damn movie!

It's very much a coming of age film for people who face a mid-life crisis. So with that stated, let me break down first the good aspects of ""Sideways"".

Good

 Writing- Loved the qups between Jack and Miles

  Chemistry- All 4 characters were perfectly well cast. I especially liked Virginia Madsen's performacne, as she had the ability to do what Miles wanted from someone all along, and that was to tell him he wasn't a failure. Somtimes in life, we need people like that.

Symbolism- I loved how they would discuss wine as a metaphor for life and love. Beautiful.

The bad

NUDITY(specifically last 5 minutes)- There are 2 ""sex"" scenes in this movie. The first involves Jack(Haden Church) and Stephanie(Sandra Oh). I actually found this scene to be pretty funny, and quick. The one scene that hurt the movie, was the last 5 minutes of the movie, in which Miles goes to retrive Jack's wallet that he has left at an apartment, in which he sleeps with a married woman(not the same woman in sex scene 1). I do want to warn everyone that thisb scene is graphic, and probably classifies as Porn by my defintion. It involves the dead beat trucker driver and the cheating wife using such foul language, that even I(and I'm not a prude mind you) blushed. This scene is very misoginistic and hurts the tone of the movie. It could have been handled more discretly, and still managed to be funny(I found the part where the guy was running naked after Miles, HILARIOUS).

  Overall, a wonderful film about life, love and what friendship really entails, and yes it was very profound at times, and yes it was extremly funny on many occassions, but that one scene in the final 5 minutes really hurt this film considerably.",1117670400,,2016,4.569444444444445

None of the characters were remotely interesting, and a third grader could have written better dialogue. I somehow made it all the way through the movie, but feel that 2 hours of my life have been wasted.

And to all of you out there who think you will love this movie because you are wine lovers and think this movie will speak to you, I would like to warn you. I also love wine and spend many vacations around the very locations where this movie was filmed. Fortunately I have never come across people so void of any interesting characteristics in my travels to these parts.

Nothing against Paul Giamatti, who I think is a fabulous actor that I would love to represent (I'm a PR guy!!!), but the acting, story, and every single line of dialogue was just atrocious. Atrocious! I didn't like or care about any of the characters, and every time they opened their mouths to speak I despised them more. What did everybody see in this movie??? I don't get it!

I was also very put off by the frontal male nudity. Why do directors think they need to show male genitals to shock? I mean I guess I can't blame this director, since he probably knew people would have to be half asleep towards the end of the movie. So why not have a big floppy man part swinging every which way to wake the audience up? Well I think it was unnecessary, and if I were the director's publicist I would have told him to remove that scene. In fact I would have told him to scrap this movie and make a different one. A good one.

2240327,5,B0007RUSGW,"In the scheme of things, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) couldn't be as different as night and day. Miles, a schoolteacher and aspiring novelist, is precise and enjoys a good Pinot Noir. Jack, over his frat-boy prime and a mediocre acting career, shoots off the cuff and enjoys pushing his man-child behavior to the limit.

It's true that opposites attract, and former college roommates Miles and Jack have managed to remain friends despite their extreme differences. After two years, Miles is still nursing the wounds of his divorce. Jack on the other hand is ready to take the big plunge. To celebrate the occasion, Miles takes Jack on a week-long trip through California's wine country.

Sideways, the new film from writer-director Alexander Payne and writer Jim Taylor (Election, About Schmidt), starts off as an amusing tale of male bonding, and before the bottle is empty, turns into a heartfelt examination of a wounded man's enduring spirit.

Like all of Payne and Taylor's films, Sideways takes us on a journey of self-reflection, a celluloid mirror that totally captures the honesty and reality of the characters and situations. Even when the characters stray off the beaten path, it proves advantageous to all concerned. Instead of a movie about two best friends who come to blows over wine and women, we are treated to an engrossing analysis of the fragile state of the human psyche.

Giamatti, with his sad, hang dog eyes and introspective kowtow, is perfectly cast as Miles, a man looking for meaning in his life but settling for mediocrity. Miles prides himself on his vast knowledge of all things grape, unaware he's becoming a raisin. Miles doesn't just want this week off, he needs it. He's waiting word from his agent about his long-in-the-works novel, afraid with every ring of the phone comes rejection.

Miles is so lost in himself that he becomes vulnerable to Jack's last minute attempt to sow his wild oats, lying to sweet, good natured tasting room server Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and hurting her best friend and potential suitor Maya (Virgina Madsen) in the process. Payne/Taylor leading men are flawed but likeable, and Miles is no exception. We're not sure if he deserves success, but root for him nonetheless.

Sideways is as unexpected as it is unique. The characters seem familiar, but that's because they're real. I love that the filmmakers never feel compelled to reduce them or their feelings to convenient plot devices. Sideways is much smarter than that, and is one of the best films of the year.",1117584000,8,2552,4.964871194379391

2240330,1,B0007RUSGW,"This is very likely one of the worst films I have ever seen; although it should be noted that I don't make a habit of seeing films I know will be bad. Sideways can best be described as a dull, simplistic plot about mediocre characters delivered through amazingly uninteresting and uninspired dialog.

If the intent of the film was indeed to reveal a realistic treatment of the mid-life crisis of heterosexual men, it failed utterly. I was positive the main characters were gay lovers through the first 30 minutes--which would have, I think, resulted in a more believable and interesting movie. As a middle aged man I found nothing in common or familiar with the two main characters, however even if I had it would still not have helped as this film has many more problems than a bad premise.

The soundtrack seemingly stolen from a bad porno flick was so annoying it actually made it hard to concentrate on the events transpiring in the film. The acting ranged from fair to bad, with Thomas Haden Church turning in a very stiff, unconvincing performance. Yet by far the writing was inexcusable; realistic, believable characters engaged in recognizable life situations does not have to equal dull and boring. The writer(s) here appeared to be trying so hard to force the appearance of mundane everyday life that they interpreted it as uninteresting and unexciting. Real life people have far more interesting and engaging conversations than these people (with the exception of the dialog where Miles and his girl friend explain to each other why they love wine which stands out in such brilliant contrast to the rest of the film's writing quality that is seems horribly inconsistent and out of place).

Clearly it seems based on this movie's critical acclaim that huge special effects extravaganzas, that have no writing at all, has left audiences so desperate for any kind of serious attempt at a character driven film that even an extremely bad one appears wonderful by contrast. Movies hold most of their value in entertainment and their ability to transport us to places we've never been and to distract us from our problems if only for two hours. A movie that is as tedious as our own lives, or worse yet, the even more dull lives of our neighbors (who we wouldn't want to spend a week with in real life much less watch a movie about), is a failure to achieve its most basic goal of a pleasant diversion.",1117497600,24,2407,4.753588516746412

And on this front the film succeeeds brilliantly.

Alexander Payne has composed his best film to date and hopefully ushered in a new era of adult themed films.",1117497600,7,713,4.590551181102362
2240333,4,B0007RUSGW,"I made the mistake of watching this film after I had just finished reading the novel, after all the critical acclaim and awards...which meant that I couldn't experience it fresh, without all the hype. Thus, I had to watch it a few times before I could really appreciate this film for what it is...a tale of two buddies in the last days of their friendship before one of them gets married off. First, let me say that if you haven't read the novel and you love this film, then I hope you will buy and read the novel. There were so many amusing scenes left out, which only added to my disappointment upon first viewing...but I understand that they had to cut a lot of things out to keep the film to a decent running time.

This film has plenty going for it: a fine cast, a great and complimentary soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, awesome location, and a clever script. Unfortunately, the story shows a rather unsavory side to men, which I hope women won't think ALL MEN have some compulsary need to have one last affair before getting married. Both men are rather pathetic and its surprising that they have remained friends for so long (from freshmen in college through middle age). Paul Giamattie is simply great in his role as an introverted loser who lacks confidence with women and tends to go to the dark side of pessimistic outlook. He has a great sparring partner in Thomas Harden Church, who plays an extroverted, womanizing lout with a diminishing acting career. In the Santa Ynez valley on a wine tasting tour, hanging out at the Windmill Motel near the Danish tourist town of Solvang, they meet two ladies and begin their unique ways of flirtation. Thomas plays the more confident one of the two and quickly has Stephanie (Sandra Oh) wanting to get jump in the sack with him. The scenes between Paul and Virginia Madsen are the best in the film...as their dialogue about life and using wine as a metaphor represents a cool style of flirtation. Paul's character simply is slower when it comes to attracting women, and its interesting to hear Virginia comparing the quality of a wine and when it begins its decline. Is she talking about wine or him? She's brilliant and the best thing about this film.

The scene I didn't like, however, comes near the end of their sojourn when Jack (Thomas Harden Church) begs his friend to retrieve an important item left at a one night stand's house. Although that scene was in the book...I was shocked by what they actually show the audience. It does add a bit of humor (on the gross-out side) but I thought it was unnecessary. Because of that scene, I couldn't recommend this film to many people I'd otherwise recommend it to (their sensibilities would not find much humor in it). Other than that...it was a good film. For those who like or love this film, I would recommend you to read the novel by Rex Pickett. It is so much better and you'll gain a fuller appreciation for the characters. Plus, the film made some changes in the beginning and the ending, as well as changing Stephanie from the novel's character of ""Terra"". So, buy the soundtrack to listen to as you read the novel, sipping a glass of Pinot Noir...and get ready for a belly full of laughs!",1117411200,4,3208,4.587108013937282

The two lead characters were absolutely pathetic, boorish, selfish losers. I did not need to see a movie about them and their drunkenness. They each needed to grow up and get a life.

What made anyone think that a movie about two losers spending a week getting drunk and having sex was a good idea? Stupid stupid movie. Stupid plot (if you can call it a plot). Stupid idea.",1117411200,13,581,4.420560747663552

The good things were the acting was excellent and the dialogue was written by a real writer, not some of the hacks that write most of the movies made today. The bad is it was pretty dull most of the time. I've heard this called a comedy masterpiece but I didn't see it. I don't think I laughed out loud once; I smiled and chuckled a few times. I did end up rooting for something good to happen to Paul Giamatti's character in the end, but some of his problems wouldn't have exitsed if he had a backbone. Thomas Hayden Church's character had no redeeming qualities I could see and I saw no reason why the two guys were even friends. There was also a scene that was unnecessarily vulgar.

2240336,2,B0007RUSGW,"The hype surrounding this movie is unbelievable.  Basically, ""Sideways"" is a grown-up version of Road Trip or American Pie.  Sure, there are metaphors such as the references to wine and their parallels to personalities in the movie.  However, the rest of the movie is a series of epiphanies and middle age woes that have all been done before.  I really appreciate the talent of Paul Giamatti, but Sideways merely tells the tale of two buddies spending one last week of bachelorhood together before Jack (Thomas Haden Church) gets married.  There's nothing original here, and I was disgusted by the unnecessary full-frontal (overweight) male nudity.

2240338,4,B0007RUSGW,"The risk involved in describing ""Sideways"" as a road movie about obsessive wine tasting is that people who are not wine buffs/connoisseurs are likely to stay away from it, which would be a pity. So let me discuss it from a different perspective: Sideways is in fact a buddy movie, and not an overly comic one. Granted, there is a fair share of funny scenes but overall the tone of the movie veers clearly toward the dramatic.

Meet Miles and Jack. The former is a small-time english teacher (and aspiring novelist...too bad his aspirations are constantly frustrated), the latter is a washed-up tv actor with a career that after a promising start never really took off. Both are middle-aged guys who are coping with lowered expectations and shattered ambitions.

Jack is about to marry (although he feels uneasy about his marital future) and the two friends embark on a wine-tasting extended bachelor party that eventually feels much like a coming of age story.

There is a lot of wine talking going on throughout the movie but wine isn't the whole point. Wine is more like a metaphor for life and there is a brilliant dialogue between Miles and Maya (the girl he falls in love with) that clearly shows this point.

This is not a happy-ending movie. There's a lot of stark realism in it and although the finale leaves some hope for Miles, it's quite obvious that this is LIFE, not some fairy tale.

This is no educational movie either. There are scenes where ""getting sideways"", far from being frowned upon, is elevated to something very romantic or, at least, something that lets us understand Miles' deep suffering, forcing us to be sympathetic to his condition.

Anyway, enough with the social commentary, I greatly appreciated this movie and I think that anybody with a passing interest in non-mainstream stuff should see it.",1117238400,8,1828,4.824281150159744
2240339,5,B0007RUSGW,"I won't rehash the plot, the characters, etc., as that's all so familiar by now.  Why is this film a small wonder?  Because it's what happens in the interstices, between the minimal action and the raucous laughs.  Like the characters or not, they are painfully real, and we get so few real characters in movies today.  We get so few honestly-motivated characters today.  And the reason:  one has only to peruse the one-star reviews on this site.  Has anyone noticed that the one-star reviews are generally very short, as if the attention span of the denouncer couldn't sustain a paragraph, let alone a reasonably lengthy explanation of their disgust?  It's usually ""boring"" -- it's not to any true cineaste, of course -- or the characters are morally bankrupt -- so, that's not a valid reason to loathe a movie; in fact, it's a completely biased and stupid reason to mount a criticism of a work of art on.  Face it, ""Sideways"" was made for people who love film that challenges them, surprises them, moves them, forces them to see life in a different light.  Most people don't want to be challenged -- you know who you are, you brain-dead video gamers, you Internet-addled, low-alpha brain-wave unguents -- so why bother to voice your complaints about this brilliant movie unless you really have something profound to say in defense of your criticism.  Compared to the one-star reviews, the five-star reviews are very lengthy, usually articulate and thoughtful and understand what the filmmaker was trying to accomplish.  An Alexander Payne should be celebrated, a studio that gives him money should be extolled.  It's just too bad there aren't more of him.  I did have one criticism of the DVD, though -- but it won't change my five-star rating -- and that's the voice-over commentary by Thomas Church and Giamatti.  It's so puerile at times, so uninformative; too bad Payne didn't do it with his writing partner.  Oh, well, fortunately one doesn't have to listen to their drivel, and even if one decides to suffer it, it in no way detracts from their courageous performances.",1117152000,5,2076,4.855113636363637
2240340,5,B0007RUSGW,"I guess I could start with a short synopsis.  Two college buddies are headed North to the wine country for a week long bachelor party.  Miles is in a depressed state because of a divorce and Jack is looking to get some before he gets married.  From this spouts some crazy situations in and out of vineyards.

What you do get from this movie is excellent characters.  Even though Miles could be incredibly annoying you end up feeling for him.  I think a lot of people have friends that are like Jack.  They're a bit older but still act immature at times.  Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh are both awesome too.  While Sandra Oh's character could have been developed more I don't think the movie suffers because of it.

The dialogue is witty and sarcastic sometimes to the point of being outright hilarious.  Granted it may take a special kind of humor to understand why some things are funny.  There are some things that are just sophomoric but they lighten the film at times where you think Miles might drag you down.

There is definitely a reason why this movie was nominated for a bunch of awards.  You can't go wrong with sharp/witty writing and excellent acting/direction.  I would highly recommend at least going out and renting this movie.  I know it will soon become a part of my collection.",1117152000,5,1295,4.565217391304348

This film has everything I love-- witty dialouge with an underlying sense of sarcasm and black humor, it's about a writer, wine, dispicable characters, social commentary on how shallow secular America has become in relationships with other people, and wine.

I loved seeing Giammatti's character-- a pansy New York Times reading whiner, get his midlife crisis in full, and the scenery was masterfully incorporated into the story, adding a whole other dimension to the poignancy.

The acting was top notch, and it is a brilliantly written character study. People who are dissing this film do it because they're reminded of their own pathetic lives. At least, that's my take on it.

Many scenes made me wince because I felt like I had already lived through them. Who out there was actually looking for a morality play in an R rated movie that is quite obviously about DRINKING? If you are thinking about writing a review of this film, stop for a moment and think back to the scene in the movie where Miles and Jack are sitting under a rail road trestle discussing the rejection of Miles' book. The book ""Confederacy of Dunces"" (by John Kennedy Toole) is mentioned, as is the writer Charles Bukowski. If you are not familiar with either that book, or that writer, don't write a review of this film, because you obviously do not have enough information to fully understand it.",1116979200,5,852,4.57516339869281
2240343,4,B0007RUSGW,"Lost in all the hype about Oscar nominations and accusations of overkill is the fact that Sideways is a fun little movie.  It makes no pretention to be anything else.  It is in the style of Bridget Jones (the first one) - two flawed and over-the-top stereotyped guys (in this case) get into situations that lead to comedic results.  What makes the movie good, though, is that the situations and the reactions to them are consistent and grow out of the characters, not because of plot points that must be followed.

This is basically a guy's version of a chick flick.  It is probably not a teenager date movie (certainly not for a 1st date).  The audience at which the film is aimed is probably the same as the main characters - slightly balding, slightly pauncy 30-40 year olds (of both sexes).  Okay, only the guys will be slightly balding, but you know what I mean!  The story - two male friends take off on a road trip in a last week of ""freedom"" before one's wedding.  The best man, Miles, thinks this is a good opportunity to introduce his friend to the fine art of oenology (wine tasting), especially since he will be marrying into a socially elite and rich family.  That Miles is an alcoholic using this as an excuse to go drinking is obvious to the audience, but probably not to Miles himself.  The friend, Jack, wants nothing from the alcohol except as a lubricant to get as much single-guy sex in before he's tied down.

There's no way around this description, even though it makes the two characters seem like cads.  They are - not only is Miles an alcoholic (and a petulant one at that), he even steals money from his own mother in one scene.  Jack is an amoral compulsive womaniser who cannot be convinced that anonymous sex is cheating on his fiancee.  Similarly, they lie to themselves, each other, and to the women they meet.  Somehow, though, we immediately care for them and like them, knowing objectively that they are inherently unlikeable.  Part of it is the performances by Giamatti and Church, which are very good.  The other part is the direction and the script - they are written just a little bit over-the-top, which allows the audience to relax and forgive them their foibles.  Well, the guys in the audience will, I'm not so sure of the gals.

The women in the film are much more realistic and more subtle.  They provide the solid emotional grounding and realism that offsets the insanity revolving around the two guys.  The film is really about relationships - much is said about the wine, but that's incidental.  The movie's hook could have been anything - baseball, environmental activism, or a motorcycle club.  The characters' relations to each other (and, granted, to the object holding it all together, wine) underpins all the events in the film.  There are poignant moments, but most of the time the film is humourous in its observations about the people, and the humour grows naturally from the characters and the inextricable logic they must follow once they get themselves into the situation they are in.

On reflection at the end, you know that in the real world, Miles would continue to be an alcoholic and Jack would promptly cheat on his wife.  But this is a pseudo-fantasy world where the people, if they don't quite live happily ever after, at least are better off then when they started.  And we have spent a satisfying and fun 2 hours with the characters, without having been cheated by a cheap and artificially contrived grand resolution.

This DVD edition has some interesting tidbits.  The audio commentary by the two stars is fun, if not particularly informative.  There are some cut scenes, which, on seeing them, were rightfully cut.  But it's fun to see them nonetheless.",1116979200,8,3725,4.683076923076923

2240354,4,B0007RUSGW,"In Sideways, Paul Giamatti plays Miles, a divorced english teacher who is hopelessly trying to get his novel published.  Miles and his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) go on a wine tasting trip as sort of a bachelor party for Jack who is a former soap opera actor and is about to get married.  Crazy adventures occur on the trip involving infidelity, love, and above all lots of wine.

Giamatti is probably most recently recognized for his role in American Splendor where he played a comic book writter who was kind of a loser.  Giamatti's character in this movie has some similarities to the one in American Splendor, but Miles is more of a funny loser because he is prone to hissy fits, alcoholic silliness, and general nervousness around women.  The intelligent yet insecure character of Miles plays a good foil to that of Jack, the cool, convident ladies' man who is just looking to have some fun before he gets married.  The characters' friendship works well in the movie and enlights many instances of humor.

This movie also includes contrasts between romances: a semi-serious one between Miles and Mya (Virginia Madsen), a bar-tender, and a fling between Jack and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) that is mainly for pleasure.  While watching this movie, I couldn't help but hope that the relationship between Miles and Mya would work out because they seemed so perfect for each other; at the same time I was also hoping that the relationship between Jack and Stephanie would fall apart because he as just using her.

Sideways may not have won the best picture of the year and I don't really think that it deserved the award either because it is a bit formulic and maybe a bit too much of the story's plot revolves around information about wine than most viewers would not understand.

I did purchase the DVD when it came out and watched it that night with my wife. Both my wife and myself have a wide range in movie interest, however my wife fell asleep 3/4 of the way through it and I couldn't wait for the movie to end.

The primary focus of the movie was on Paul Giamatti, and wine tasting. The only way the writers could have made the movie any slower was if they had cheese tasting, too.

Paul Giamatti is a very good actor, but the part he played within this movie was extremely slow and whiney. To be honest, the whole movie was slow and tame, except when Paul Giamatti's co-star, Thomas Haden Church, was given the spot light to interact with the other characters.

The editors and director could have trimmed out a large part of Paul Giamatti's character and made him the secondary character within the story. They should have focused more on making Thomas Haden Church the main character of the story, and they would have made the movie a bigger sell.

The acting is first rate by all, but Paul Giamatti is an absolute revelation. I have never seen a character so morally flawed (he steals from his own mother for chrissakes), who I cared about so much.

The film's storyline has been adequately covered by previous reviewers, but one facet warrants special mention.  This guy knows how to end a movie.

His foibles and Jack's (the counter-point protaganist) drive the movie.  Interesting the ethos that permits stealing from one's lonely mother for a boys' weekend but balks at philandering.  Meanwhile, the philanderer is displaying a sense of principle in not wanting to take a father in law's job offer.

The similarities and dissimilarities between Jack and Miles make the movie interesting.  A few funny lines (""flutter of Edam cheese"") and scenarios (retrieving a lost wallet) are welcome in a story that seems a miserable view of men and men's relationships.  Miles is so pathetic, though, that it's surprising that he's been embraced by hordes of vacationing amateur oenthologists wishing to stay at the same crappy motel.  I suppose some yuppies have trouble finding their own dives.

The redeeming scene in the movie, the one that salvages it from mediocrity, is the revealing exchange between two thoughtful characters explaining their appreciation of wine.  Both have reasons that are rooted in their self-image and are surprisingly well-developed.

The plot is plain.  The characters are boderline annoying.  There a few good moments sprinkled thourghout, but they're too few and far between to redeem this pretensious film.

Character development, on location scenery, great performances and a script that is one of the best I've seen and heard in years.  Paul Giamatti is excellent as Miles, the down on his luck author and school teacher trying to get his life in order.  I think he was robbed of an Oscar nomination.  Thomas Haden Church (Ned & Stacey, Wings) gets the break out role of his career as Jack, the guy who is unfaithful but lovable.  Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh round out the cast to make this movie a true Independent film classic.",1115769600,7,577,4.563106796116505
2240361,5,B0007RUSGW,"I will continually stand by my point with two arguments pertaining to this film.  The first being that this fine piece of cinematic brilliance should have won an Academy Award this year.  The Academy should not have just handed Alexander Payne the award for Best Screenplay (as they did Sophia Coppola), but instead awarded him top honors.  This was more than just a story about a famous singer, or an aviator, or a suffering boxer, but instead a story about the human spirit, the bond of friendship, and the power of wine.  To me, all very symbolic of being a human being.  The second argument that I have is that Paul Giamatti was, literally, robbed from being involved with the Oscars this year.  His performance was the strongest that I saw last year, and the strongest that I have seen so far this year.  He brought his character to life, giving us this sense of ""every man"" coupled with that oh-so-familiar feeling of loss and frustration.  We have all been there, we have all seen the effects that it can have on us, and I truly think that Giamatti best embodied that sensation.

With that grumbling aside, I strongly think that this was an amazing film by any standards.  The performances, like wine, were rich, subtle, and just some small scents of fruitiness.  Alexander Payne has proven, with this film and his previous outings that he can capture the American spirit while also showing us a world that is originally not seen in other films.  I cannot remember the last film that I saw where wine was nearly the central character and the surroundings just happened to be quaint little bits of wine country.  The cinematography was beautiful and breathtaking.  For any of us that have never been to that side of the world, Payne gives us that glimpse and creates that sensation of excitement.  After seeing this film, I want to go there, I want to smell what Miles smelled, while racing through the vineyards.  You know that a film has been successful when it actually creates a stir in your body to want to visit that place and experience it yourself.  Payne not only miraculously showed us a beautiful part of our country, but also brought forward the passion for wine.  Wine enthusiasts could only have written the speeches that Giamatti delivers.  While I know that Payne did not do this all his own, you could almost taste the wine that he, Jim Taylor, and Rex Pickett tasted while they were writing.  It is one of those rare cinematic moments where the wine just seeps from the edges of your television, and you instantly fall in love.

So, you have a brilliant mind behind the camera giving the direction, you have a passionate subject that explores one of America's pastimes, what else is there to rave about this film.  Well, as if I didn't semi-mention it already, how about the acting?  Could anyone else have put together a stronger cast than Payne did?  Would anyone else have seen Giamatti as the lead and thought that he could handle the pressures of a leading man?  What about Thomas Haden Church?  Did anyone think that this material would put his name into the Oscar scrapbook?  Then there is Madsen, who literally ventured out of the dark to do this project, and she proved that she is ready for Hollywood.  To say that the acting in this film carried this picture would be bad, because every element co-existed together perfectly, but the acting was a notch above your normal field of Hollywood movies.  Giamatti was, well, a genius and I will forever wave my fist at the Academy for forgetting him.  He couldn't have carried this film on his own, thanks to Oh, Church, and Madsen, these four prove they were the power behind this movie.  They were jaw-dropping pieces of perfection.

Overall, as if you couldn't tell already, I thought that this was one of the best cinematic outings to come out of Hollywood this year.  Payne, unlike his early work with Miramax, had complete creative control over this project and he proved that he could handle a balanced story, with complex characters and plenty of wine.  His passion for our American landscape shined brightly through this film as it did with About Schmidt, as he toured us through some unknown nooks and crannies of our nation.  He proved that he could bring some lost nobodies out into the mainstream light and prove that he could bring the best out from them.  He proved, to the film community, that he is ready for bigger, bolder projects, and I have no doubt in my mind that we will soon see his face with a ""Best Director"" Oscar right next to it.  Alexander Payne is one of Hollywood's most underappreciated secrets, and it is about time that he is unleashed onto the world.

Bravo Sideways, Bravo.

Considering all the great reviews, I watched it.

What I saw was something that could easily be a Hollywood movie.  I'm not saying it was a bad movie.  It was a good movie but not something that I felt was anything special afterwards.

Paul Giamatti did not do anything that took any special acting talent.  The role didn't call for anything difficult.  He basically needed to be a sort of a sad sack and constantly put on a disappointed and ironic expression in his constantly disillusioning situations.  He did his role just fine but it was a simple role.

The other guy Thomas Hayden Church(?) was just annoying and really brought the enjoyment level down as the guy just grates on me for some reason.

This is another one of those ""it's of higher-value because it's (psuedo) independent""-type things such as the abominable Blair Witch Project, poor Lost in Translation or adequate Crying Game.",1115510400,2,1075,4.825136612021858
2240369,1,B0007RUSGW,"I rented this movie with somewhat high hopes that this would be a good film, even though from trailers and such it looked like it would be another overrated critical darling about vapid middle-aged men undergoing a midlife crisis.  I could watch only about half an hour of this thing before I realized that it was an overrated critical darling about vapid middle-aged men under going a midlife crisis.  I see no need to waste my time watching a movie about two guys I wouldn't bother being in the same room with.

It's not that the characters are unlikeable (although they are) or are liars, or cheats.  It's that they are so damn boring.  They don't want anything interesting, and what they do want, they won't try and get.  Thus, there's no story to hold one's interest.

And no, I don't insist that movies feature only nice people.  Nice people aren't interesting to watch either.  I want people who are interesting to watch, who want something (money, power, sex, safety), and the something they want is powerful in their lives.  The nothing lives of these people just isn't interesting to watch.

I should have known, however, that this critic's darling would be like this.  They usually are:  About Schmidt, American Beauty (middle-aged-white-guy bashing)  Oh well, there's always Shakespeare and his not very nice liars and power-mad heroes.",1115510400,18,1348,4.881057268722467
2240370,5,B0007RUSGW,"Early one morning while everything seemed difficult and problematic as usual, Miles (Paul Giamatti) wakes up to a neighbor knocking on the door telling him to move his car.  Miles, an interesting character in his own right, suffers internally from his long ago divorce that keeps him in a prolonged depression.  He feeds this depression with his preoccupation of negative thinking, which even oozes from his poor appearance and his untidy tiny apartment.  He is the kind of guy most would steer away from, as his presence provides contagious negativity.  He sees himself as a failed writer that tries to get by in life teaching English while the students probably openly disrespect him.  The essence of his character has all of the negative traits of a lonely middle-aged man that has hit a middle age crisis and believes that there is nothing better for him in life than a bleak, sad, pass, and isolated existence.

Miles returns to the apartment while being aware that he is behind schedule, as he has over slept.  Over the phone Miles excuses himself, which he probably does frequently, for being late while he still finds a moment to escape reality through the thousands of books that cover most of his apartment.  The apartment alone tells more than a thousand words in regards to Miles' situation in life, as all the books suggest that he must be escaping reality as often as he can.  Besides having a fetish for books Miles also dreams of having his own vineyard, which explains his inclination for wine.  Wine is also the reason for why he has overslept, as he recovers from last night's hangover and begins his journey to meet his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church).

These two middle-aged men have decide to venture through the Californian wine land while visiting as many vineyards and golf courses as possible over a period of six days.  The reason for this expedition is Jack's upcoming wedding, as they have decided that Jack should enjoy freedom before marriage one final time.  One striking notion is how Jack could be friends with Miles, as Jack is the polar opposite of Miles.  Jack has a career and options to try new things while being a positive, strong, and confident man who seems to have it all.  Why would a person such as Jack hang out with Miles?  Well, this question will answer itself, as Jack is the kind of guy that most people like to know, but only until the moment his true self appears.

Middle-age depression compiled by feelings of unworthiness, poor self-esteem, professional rejection, loneliness, and much more seem to be the reason why Miles welcomes Jacks presence.  After all Miles is the key for Jack to be able to be himself - a first-class jerk.  Jack's persona reveals itself when the audience hears Jack say, """"...I was dying in there."" in regards to his new family and wife to be.  This, however, could be Jack expressing his anxiety for the wedding by having cold feet.  Later, in the film, more of Jack's two-facedness will become more consistent which only exists in order to serve his own personal desires without consideration for others.  Jack's career as an actor truly seems to be self-servant for him, as he cheats his way through conversations by deceiving people to like him.  Also, somewhere under this exterior Jack seems to have some form of a confused ego that only lives in the present.  Miles seems to be the only one who is aware of Jack's true nature, but accepts it due to his psychosocial status.

Sideways turns into an likable dissection of these two characters, as they will find a crossroad through golf, wine, and women.  On their way to this crossroad Miles will explore his own and other's existence and character, which will give him an opportunity to expand sideways.  Miles realize that he does not have to try to move forward to find what he needs.  Much of this Miles owe to Jack who is the catalyst that pulls him out of his own miserable void.  Yet, Miles does not approve of Jack's methods, which places him in a conundrum.  As an interesting side note, Conundrum is also the name of the publishing company that might publish Miles book.

Words such as vibrantly alive and authentic come to mind when listening to what the two main characters say.  This is due to a brilliantly adapted screen play by Alexander Payne who co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Taylor, which originates from a novel by Rex Pickett.  Illustrative, the communication between Miles and Jack displays their friendship by default, as the chemistry between the two transparently exhibits each character's psychology and their interaction with their present social environment.  Ultimately, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church's character contrasts makes the film very absorbing while providing performances of the highest level.  The female antagonists performed by Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh help augment the characteristics of these two, in their own way, pathetic men.  This leaves the audience with an authentic tale of existence, hope, and love, which makes it ok to dream while also trying to work toward those dreams.",1115424000,6,5083,4.842592592592593
2240371,5,B0007RUSGW,"I really can't understand those who have been giving this outstanding movie low marks because they don't like the charcters or their morals.

Just because you make or like a movie about a serial killer (i.e. Silence of the Lambs) does that mean that you condone serial killing or that the movie is automatically a bad one?  Can movies only be made about moral do gooders - what kind of garbage is that?  Can you only make movies that express a certain point of view or have a certain type of character and, if so, are we living in the United States of America?

If you don't like the performances, the direction, the plot, the script, the music, etc. that's one thing, but obviously you can make a great movie about unlikeable characters just the same way you can make a horrible movie about likeable characters.  Most if not all of the most celebrated movies of all time by critics and audiences alike contain morally bad characters and portray conduct by some characters that we do not aspire to (i.e. Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, Godfather, etc) - by presenting it, it doesn't mean the movie is agreeing with it or condoning it or that you agree with it or condone it if you like the movie, it's just a part of the plot.

I also can't understand the criticisms that the movie is  pretentious.  Sideways has fun at the expense of these pathetic lost souls more than anything else, and really makes fun of their self-importance and attempts at sophistication. The movie is about two guys who spend a week in wine country so (surprise, surprise) there are jokes about wines and wine tasting.  Making fun of pretentiousness does not mean the movie is pretentious.

Jack (Thomas Haden Church), his ""friend"" is not a good person, but for some reason, you like him anyway.  Jack wants to have one last romp (or two) before he ties the knot, and wants Miles to have some fun with him.  One reviewer said that ""both lead characters are spineless, juvenile, cheating twerps who seem to subscribe to the notion that women are worthless disposable creatures put here simply for their pleasure.""  Not true; Jack is a cheater, and some would say ""spineless"", but as you watch the film, it's easy to see that the man is confused, and a little arrogant, and although his actions are not OK in anyway, you get the idea that he learns his lesson by the end of the film.  Miles, on the other hand, is not spineless, juvenile, or a cheater at all.  He's just a depressed man with a love for wine; a hopeless romantic, who happens to get caught up in a mess brought on by Jack.

What a disappointment. This film is charmless, boring, pompous, and leaves you feeling blank. The best part of it was seeing areas I grew up in. It is PRETENTIOUS. You do not care about the characters at all. And worst of all, the characters raise below their surrounding. All their problems are self-imposed.

But perhaps the one aspect of Sideways that can never be forgiven is how it portrays teaching. Here Miles is pining away at not getting published and worrying about how empty and worthless his life is. Yet there he is in the classroom. Quite a nice classroom BTW, with well dressed and behaved kids zoning out on how worthless his life is, when he has the opportunity EVERY DAY to give something to these kids and have meaning in his life.

But NOOOOO. The movie is way too pretentious for that. You can have no meaning in your life by doing something ordinary and praise worthy. You have to be published author for goodness sakes (or maybe a director and script writer) to have meaning and accomplish something. BLUCK.

2240383,2,B0007RUSGW,"I utterly detested this slick and glittery but pretentious and shallow attempt at a ""buddy film,"" first of all because it reminds me of the scores of insufferable, nauseating, viciously condescending yuppie ""wine snob"" phonies I have often encountered.

Jack and Miles were just utterly loathsome and completely pathetic characters; their whiny immaturity,  aimless self-conscious materialism, fierce self-absorption and utter cluelessness was just awful and quite unfunny for a film that claims to be a sophisticated and deft comedy/satire--the tragic thing is that scores of people here in Southern California these days are just like those two if not worse; like Miles and Jack, they seem to quickly grow old without ever really growing up. Worse, these overgrown boys are quite thoughtlessly destructive; blithely creating meaningless tragedies all along the way while not learning much of anything useful or life-changing.

What's most unfortunate is that this picture had great potential to be a clever and brutal satire lambasting the greedy, pretentious snobbery, barely concealed sadism and exhaustingly neurotic phoniness of so many upper-class (and upper-class wannabe) Southern Californians, but the director, Alex Payne (whose prior films, ""Citizen Ruth,"" ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"" were superb) seems to have dropped the ball. Two grown, unmarried, presumably heterosexual men going on a ""wine tasting"" road trip together? Face it, it's absurd, but with a different director (say, Christopher Guest or Alex Cox) it could have been hilarious, a male version of the wonderful Britcom ""Absolutely Fabulous,"" perhaps.

In view of films like ""Sideways,"" it appears that over the past 30 odd years the time-honored American ""buddy film"" concept, sadly, has degenerated significantly, falling from the heights of deep, gritty and often amusing and touching studies about male friendship to the pathetic current lows of castrated, juvenile, prissy, lily-livered, mutual whining. I think of such ""buddy"" films of the past, the best of them from the 1970s (e.g., ""Scarecrow"" with Al Pacino and Gene Hackman; ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot"" with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges; ""The In-Laws"" with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk; ""Bang The Drum Slowly"" with Robert DeNiro and Michael Moriarty) and they easily stand head and shoulders above transparently self-indulgent yuppie trash like ""Sideways.""

I give ""Sideways"" two stars only because it had done a fine job of capturing and reflecting the bucolic beauty of California's largely still-rural central coast.",1115078400,13,2558,5.582474226804123
2240384,4,B0007RUSGW,"My initial feelings about this movie was that it was overrated. Here is a movie going to the Academy Awards, that no one has seen,  or heard about. To me this generally means an artsy movie, that no one can stay awake through.

Boy was I wrong! My wife, bless her heart, rented this a few days ago. I haven't had as much fun watching a movie in quite a while.

Two guys, one a depressed writer and wine enthusiast who, believes in the bottom of his heart that he is a pinot grape. The other one, a womanizing jerk, who is getting married, but tries to chase down every skirt that crosses his field of vision. Now, one of these skirts is Sandra Oh, (which improves the bouquet of any movie she's on) so that can be justified, but after she breaks up with him, with the creative use of a helmet, he links up with a married, fluffy waitress, who is more the ""wine in a box"" varietal.
These two losers (the guys, not the girls) take off in a tour of the California wine country, where one shows off his (greatly imaginary) wine knowledge, and the other just tries to pick up girls. A scene where he is chewing gum while tasting wine is, to me, a classic.
If you (like me) grew up in a culture where wine is what you mix baby formula with, it is even funnier to see someone remember what bottle of wine turned her into an aficionada.
I recommend this one without reservations. You will enjoy it. I think it will go well with a Sonoma red Zinfandel myself.",1114992000,5,1450,4.2086330935251794

This movie is about two men who are still coming of age and despite their adult years still have much learning and growing up to do. One is a wine expert who reveals his incredible knowledge of the subject in the movie and the other is too busy chang skirts to know the differecne between a Pinot and White Zin. Essentially the two men embark on a week holiday, comprised of golf, relaxing, eating, flirting, and ofcourse drinking wine. One of the men is soon to be married but before he settles he wants to have one last fling with a woman and despite his lack luster ways he actually finds a cutie and they become intimate and a relationship begins; ofcourse she has not clue that he is to marry another woman in just a few days, OUCH! Talk about a low blow. Clearly he has much growing up to do and maybe he thinks once he sows his wild oats he will finally be able to marry and commit to one lady. The other man, his friend, doesn't approve of his cheating ways and is upset in general. He is a sympathetic character which is what i like about him. He drowns his sorrows and frustration in his beloved wine and associated wine with life. Actually wine is used as a metaphor about life in this movie.  I think you should watch it once and take it all in, with a glass of red wine ofcourse.  CHEERS.",1114905600,3,1437,4.26007326007326

While they are a collection of extremely smart people, rarely do my tastes in really good movies ever agree with theirs.  I kept waiting for something, anything to happen to keep this from being the most boring and predictable movie I was thinking it would be from a glimpse of the first 10 minutes.  Alas, my wait was for naught.  Nothing against any of the actors, they handled their characters with the professionalism expected of actors of their caliber, however, the actual plot was a lost cause.  Couldn't have cared less about the plot.  It was plopped down without aplomb probably hoping that someone would care about what was happening to any of the characters.  Wrong.  Didn't Care.  Next time, try to invest a little more into the sheme.  The actors in the movie deserved more...",1114905600,7,870,4.701986754966887
2240387,5,B0007RUSGW,"Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church star in Alexander Payne's wise film, ""Sideways"".  Paul plays Miles, a middle-aged 8th grade english teacher who writes good novels that his agent can't find a publisher for.  Miles is also an amateur wine expert, and enjoys the spirits a little more than is good for him.  You get the sense that much of the unhappiness in his life he has brought on himself from his drinking, and his unhappiness only makes him drink so...  Despite all this, Miles seems an honestly good-hearted fellow and I felt myself pulling for him.

Church plays Jack, an actor who once played a Doctor on a soap opera, but now can only get work recording incredibly fast ""fine print"" material at the end of car dealer ads.  He and Paul were roommates as freshmen in college, and although Paul has grown into a sad, balding geek, Jack retains enough of those good looks that got him on a soap - and he can't help but use those good looks to come on to the prettiest girl he spies in every building he walks into.

Jack is now engaged, and Paul wants them to have a final bachelor's week in California wine country.  Paul wants his friend to develop a little appreciation for the wine.  Jack wants them both to meet willing women.

Virginia Madsen plays Maya, who is a waitress working her way through Horticulture grad school.  She has met Miles on his previous trips to wine country, but what Miles doesn't know initially is that pretty Maya was divorced last year.  Maya is also an amateur wine expert and everyone in the film can tell that they are soulmates.

At another winery they meet Sandra Oh as Stephanie, pouring wine and acknowledging to randy Jack that she is a bad girl and ""needs to be spanked"".  Jack pours on the soap actor charm and leaves out the fact that he's getting married on Saturday.

Without being preachy, the movie provides a stark contrast between Jack, who is interested in having as much hot sweaty bedroom encounters as possible, and Miles, who is dumpy and middle-aged and hesitantly pursues a much deeper relationship with Maya.

There are no moments when I laughed my head off, but the clever screenplay made me chuckle appreciatively every couple of minutes.  These people and their dialogue seemed very real and familiar.

By the end you hope Jack will have learned a lesson of sorts, and you hope for good things for Miles and Maya.",1114819200,4,2382,4.591016548463357
2240388,5,B0007RUSGW,"My wife called this the odd couple movie and she is right as two forty something men go off for a lost weekend with contrasting goals. One is a manically depressed teacher and aspiring writer (Giamatti) trying to get over his divorce while the other is a former well known actor (Church) who although he is getting married is determined to have a final fling. The aspiring writer is a wine connoisseur and a bit of a snob who plans their week long escape into wine country where, besides a wine tasting spree, they run into two wonderful independent women. Church plunges into a torrid romance while the depressed Giamatti is for more cautious. Church's charcter goes forward with reckless abandon that culminates into a terrific relationship disaster of large proportions. But of course Church barely escapes to get caught in a virtually worse situation that Giamatti has to help solve. Definitely a dark comedy that has very funny moments and but neither of the two male characters are anything to empathize with but both Madsen and Oh play positive characters and they balance the film. Oh offers the film energy along with Church and she has the most memorable moments in the film. The film has several refences to sex, and one set of borderline graphic nudity that adds shock to the film but based on how this movies starts to sink for the two main characters its adds an almost what else can happen aspect.

Now, I feel like I should start a support group for people who have seen the movie.

I never considered myself a prude but the last 20 minutes of the movie were just too much for me.  It may be worth seeing just for the shock value.

Also, if you are the type of movie goer that enjoys the ""happily ever after"" ending, don't even BOTHER to watch this movie, you will be disappointed.

That said, all of the main actors give wonderfully believable performances and the wine country setting is very engaging.

2240391,3,B0007RUSGW,"""Sideways,"" the first comedy (well, dramedy) to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture in recent memory, is in serious danger of being overhyped. Viewers will come to it expecting ""one of the best films of the last decade"" or a ""hilarious"" film and be disappointed, which is a shame, because the modest charms it actually has are quite engaging.

To wit: This is a film that substitutes quiet charm for laugh-out-loud jokes, wry observations for deep insights into the human condition, and a mellow rambling pace for a plot that pulls the characters (or viewers) along. It is more a mellow afternoon spent at an out of the way winery than it is a glitzy event of a movie.

This is definitely worth a rental, but do not go in expecting to have your life changed by ""Sideways."" And, frankly, thank goodness for that.

2240392,5,B0007RUSGW,"Upon first glance Sideways may appear to be your ordinary buddy movie.  However, upon closer inspection you find a tapestry as deep, rich and enjoyable as the wines our 'buddies' taste.  The story follows two mens follies in a week of wine tasting in California.  If you want to know more about the movies plot read the next review, I'm sure it will be helpful.

Some may accuse the plot as a bit too plodding but when taken into consideration the plodding lives of our two antiheros, it's a perfect complement.  The warm tones and stylistic visuals of the vinyards will give you the free feel of driving through the valley yourself.  Your characters aren't completely original but they way they are spun off by these four actors is nothing short of brilliant.

Although Sideways may not be as side splitting as you might hope it's a delightful introspective of a friendship that is preparing to be changed forever.  Almost painful at times it's warmth is radiated from the fact that they are willing to forgive each others errors and continually go to bat, even if they don't agree with the reasoning.

Two sidenotes:  I do wish they would have included the Boar hunt from the book.  Secondly, there is a scene of male nudity, however, you will be laughing so hard at this point the tears should block out anything you definately don't want to see.  Trust me.",1114560000,4,1360,4.644351464435147
2240393,5,B0007RUSGW,"In essence this is a film in which one of the characters learns that "" he would not be riding through Paris in a sports car with the wind in his hair."" The character is one who has written a novel that he hoped to publish and turn his life around. Instead he now has to retreat from fantasy and to look at his life and start to rebuild it getting a job and trying to enter a relationship. Perhaps more importantly he has to cope with his ordinariness.

The action of the film takes place mainly during a week when the aspiring writer takes a university buddy on a week trip to a wine growing area. The author's friend is a former soapy star whose career has been declining probably and his main work is doing voice-overs. Both characters are unattractive being adolescents who have not made the transaction to adulthood. One steals a large sum of money from his alcoholic mother to finance the trip and the other cheats on his fiancee in a way that is almost pathological.

After hearing a summary of the plot one would think that the film is a grim affair which might have a week season in one or two art-house cinemas. In fact the film has been one of the most successful low budget films in years. The reason for that is despite the repellent nature of the characters it is hilarious. Each scene is a minor masterpiece either comic in itself or part of the gradual development of the character study of both of the participants.

Perhaps one of the most bizarre things about the film is that you feel drawn to the two protagonists. Despite the fact that one is a brilliantly drawn pompous wine snob and the other is both superficial and not bright, one cheers for them. Some of the scenes are classics of comedy. The first wine tasting, the preparation for the night out, the later visit to the commercial winery, and the attempt to recover the actor's wallet.

2240397,2,B0007RUSGW,"I am glad to see that the average review for this movie is only 3-1/2 stars. The raves that this film got from most reviewers illustrates that most professional critics are middle-aged men. I would think that to enjoy this movie one would have to be a guy in the throes of a mid-life crisis, or a middle-aged man who can't seem to get stay in an adult relationship because he can't ""keep it in his pants""--in other words, you would have to be like one of the pathetic main characters in this film. Don't get me wrong, I'm a middle-aged man myself, but I cannot relate to either of the weasels in this movie, or the dumb screenplay and its cliche, and much too obvious, theme of wine as a metaphor for life.

The first 2/3 of the movie was almost passable--I would have given it three stars up to that point--but like many movies of its kind, it falls too far below the beltline in the end, esp. when Mr. can't-keep-it-in-his-pants ""picks up"" a chubby waitress and ""BF's"" her on the floor of her squalid living room, and gets chased out of the house by her neanderthal husband...yeah, really classy and sophisticated humor here. I don't require humor to be sophisticated--hell, I've seen Caddyshack ten times!--but this movie seemed like it was trying to be a more grown up comedy, only to go ""right for the crotch"" in the end.

I allowed my wife to ""drag"" me to see this movie on the eve of the academy awards, because she's a real movie buff, and she likes to see all of the oscar-nominated movies each year. I had vetoed it once before when she tried to get me to see it after the initial positive reviews. I had asked her what it's about, and when she said, ""Well, it's about two middle-aged guys on a wine-tasting weekend; sort of a 'last hurrah' before one of them gets married."" I replied, sarcastically, ""Oh yeah, that sounds like it's right up my alley."" Well, after we finally saw it, my wife immediately apologized, because she disliked it just as much as I did (but we were even, because I have dragged her to some pretty crummy movies too, i.e. six years later, she still sometimes razzes me about taking her to Bringing Out the Dead).

I don't know what's going on with your circle of friends, family, and acquaintences--and anybody who loved this film--but I don't know one person who has thought this was any better than so-so, and most everyone I know thinks its overrated at best, if not downright lousy.",1114387200,14,2421,4.472850678733032

- see a man lie to his fiance
- see a man make promises of eternal love and devotion to a woman who he has known only a few days
- see the same man use the same woman's child to ingratiate himself with her
- see a 40+ year old man get publicly drunk and confrontational (many times)
- see a 40+ year old man talk obsessively about himself to a woman who, totally inexplicably, puts up with it and indeed supports him in his infantile self-preoccupation.

Miles is a soft, balding, middle school English teacher with aspirations to be a published author. Jack is an aging actor whose career had declined to doing voice-over bit parts. Jack's character is a caricature of the glory-bound hunk of yesteryear; an incorrigible skirt-chasing, on-the-prowl predator. Miles is the alter ego: intellectual, nerdy, wallflower type. The only thing that seems to unite them is having been college roomates freshman year. Two more unlikely friends would be hard to find.

Therein lies the story. The relationship of these two and the people they meet take twists and turns toward the inevitable. Sort of.

The film is set against a backdrop of California wine country and wine becomes a metaphor for their lives. There are some funny, moments - ""If anyone orders merlot, I am leaving!"" - and touching scenes of life, love, and treachery.

2240404,1,B0007RUSGW,"I saw Sideways in the theater only because it was being so well reviewed. This is perhaps the only time i have done this, and now i regret doing so. The previews for the film didn't interest me at all, mostly because i find wine snobs about as interesting as obscure winter sports. This, ultimately, was my problem with the film. I just didn't care. I was generally bored, until the second half when i began to be occasionally offended.

I agree with other reviewers who question the plausibility of the friendship between these two men. The film was marketed as a buddy-flick, making it more frustrating to watch two actors with so little chemistry. I also was vaguely annoyed by Virginia Madsen's attraction to Paul Giamatti, she was obviously far too good for him, not to mention attractive, and no amount of love for wine would enable her to get past his neuroses.

Thomas Hayden Church's character was simply offensive. It's not that I question the morality of his character (I've learned that Mr. Payne doesn't really deal in morality), I just found certain scenes very hard to watch, especially the saga of the ""fat"" waitress. I didn't think it was funny, i simply felt sorry for her, until the audience is subjected to a terrible view of the ugliest sex i could ever imagine. Then you just wish the movie was over. At that point (after the husband's disgusting body is slammed against the car), I wanted to leave. But my little brother said, ""If I've sat through this much, I'm going to find out how it ends."" So we stayed. And it ended as expected, ambiguously and unsatisfyingly.

Finally, I just thought the film's humor was a little elitist (not that i didn't ""get it,"" but that it was desigend to go over the head of most folks, probably red-staters). I think in order to laugh at most of it you either need to be a middle aged man in the middle of a midlife crisis with an obsession with Pinot, or you have to be really concerned with finding obscure, snobbish humor to be funny. This aspect of the film simultaneously bored me and rubbed me quietly the wrong way. I did laugh when Giamatti goes completely crazy, so i wasn't immune to laughter. In fact, I wanted to like the film. But if I told you I did I'd be just as much of a poser as the critics that reiviewed this film so glowingly.

2240406,5,B0007RUSGW,"Some of the reviewers problems with the ""morality"" of the characters.  How interesting would a movie be with 2 perfect buddies taking a trip, enjoying wine, and then going home?  C'mon.  Try to think a little critically here.

I found this to be a strongly entertaining and funny movie about two ""FLAWED"" men who are lost in the world of relationships.  One is introverted and withdrawn--deeper--the other is extroverted and fun, but just as lost.

The extroverted one, played beautifully by Thomas Haden Church (of ""Wings"" fame) can get a woman in bed, no problem, but fails to value and understand intimacy.

The introverted one, played by Giamatti is extremely neurotic and self-conscious, but has an attractive and undying passion for wine.  One of his most memorable moments has him expressing why he loves ""Pinot Noir"" due to the effort it takes to nurture and grow a healthy Pinot Noir grape.  It's metaphorical for how he now realizes he should have approached his now over marriage.  Ironically, Giamatti, although nearly crippled by regret and neurosis, grows more and exposes his feelings with more honesty than Haden Church's character, who just sleeps around.

Watching the characters develop, make mistakes, and grow is what changes a viewer who's paying attention.  I learned from this movie.  I identified with some of the flaws of the characters.

The beauty of the wine, countryside, and lovely women only adds to the entertainment value of this gorgeous movie.  Giamatti stealing from his mother only highlights the lost nature of his character and makes the payoff of his enlightenment all that more sweet and complex.

I found myself not feeling much for the main characters in Sideways.  For a TRULY original buddy flick, rent the lovely and moving Norwegian film ""Elling.""",1114214400,5,611,4.601851851851852

My wife and I frequently disagree upon the quality of the movies we watch, but after fifteen minutes into this one we were in complete agreement that this was a boring piece of trash.  With the hope  that the film would get better, we continued watching it through its unremarkable conclusion.  Our desire to find humor in this ""comedy"" about two morally/ethically challenged losers and their visit to the California wine country was unsatisfied.  With all the good reviews this film received, I can only guess that it must have become politically incorrect to disagree.",1114128000,18,747,4.75968992248062
2240410,3,B0007RUSGW,"It was with some anticipation I awaited a preordered copy of ""Sideways"" when released on DVD so very soon after its theatrical run. With reasonably high expectations, a comfortable chair and an open mind, I sat back to enjoy this film's much talked about endearing quirkyness. Ouch. Despite the sometimes richly descriptive dialog, there is little chance the average viewer will exit a viewing armed with a new-found appreciation for Chardonnay.....Charolais maybe. We've been down this path before. This film ranks right up there with ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" as examples of shamelessly overhyped and medocre product trotted out by a well oiled and savvy media machine to be presented as a cinematic version of a four course feast. Middle aged angst can be fertile ground for satire but I have to reasonably ask just what is so funny about the central character of Miles, (Paul Giamatti) a divorced, depressed borderline alcoholic prone to occasional violence, a high school teacher who consumes ""barely legal"" porn and with some premeditation, steals money from his elderly mother to subsidize a road trip with his boyhood friend?  Then there is Jack, (Thomas Haden Church) a fading voice-over actor mere days from being wed.  Jack is driven with childish and mindless abandon to copulate with every willing consort he can possibly seduce before his impending nuptials. I suppose the fact that responsible condom use by Jack  emphasized more than once in this film makes his unrestrained behavior all the more endearing and acceptable. Hmm. Alternatively, I was easily impressed and enchanted by the gifted and beautiful Virginia Madsen in her effortless turn as Maya, a sensitive and introspective wine country waitress who is inexplicably attracted to Miles. Madsen is one talented and woefully underemployed actress that should be high on Hollywood's A list. Sandra Oh played Stephanie, an unwed mother searching for love and was considerably more appealing than the cosmopolitan lesbian mom she portrayed in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". Much comment has been given over to the male full frontal nudity that supposedly shattered conventional taboos about such things in mainstream film and I will concede to its mildy amusing if totally ridiculous context though. All in all, 3 stars is all I could honestly muster even though I liked all of the actors and some of the dialog. We all read reviews...the opinions of others in the hope of validating our preconcieved  expectations. I wish I could have been a bit more supportive of this film but there you have it.  I've said enough.  By the closing credits, you are either going to love this movie or scratch your head in mild bemusement as to what the fuss is all about.  Sigh. I must be counted among the latter.",1114128000,6,2779,5.041394335511982
2240411,5,B0007RUSGW,"Payne's last film, About Schmidt, continued his fascination with American cinema in the `70s by featuring one its biggest (and most prolific) stars, Jack Nicholson. His latest movie, Sideways, continues the road movie motif from Schmidt and combines it with the buddy film. Jack (Haden Church) is a failed actor about to be married. He decides to go on one last week of uninhibited fun with his best friend, Miles (Giamatti), a school teacher and struggling author. They go on a wine-tasting tour through California's Central Coast and squeeze in a bit of golfing as well.

Jack and Miles are complete messes as human beings. They lack direction and are hypocrites. Miles says he is an author but his book is going nowhere, while Jack is getting married and proceeds to hit on anything in a dress. They are hardly a sympathetic pair. And yet Payne is able to get a good amount of comedic mileage from the pair. An interesting thing happens during the course of the movie. At first, Miles starts off as an unsympathetic character while we warm up to Jack's funny repartee as the charming rogue. Halfway through the film they flip roles and it is Jack who is exposed as a pathetic womanizer and Miles becomes more sympathetic thanks to Maya's (Madsen) influence.

Fresh off the success of American Splendor, Paul Giamatti is one of those actors who makes it look so effortless as he inhabits the characters he plays completely. Giamatti is able to tap into his character's deep reservoir of pain and anger and pull out an incredible performance that is, in some ways a variation of his take on the equally acerbic Harvey Pekar in Splendor.

Ever since Ned and Stacey, Thomas Haden Church has been an untapped resource and with Sideways he has finally been given the role of his career. As Miles' crass, philandering best friend, he plays Jack as a middle-aged frat boy who still calls women, ""chicks."" Haden Church's deadpanned delivery of smart-ass lines works well against Giamatti's uptight straight man.

20th Century Fox's recent DVD release includes a modest collection of supplemental material. There is an audio commentary by actors Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church. As a review in Entertainment Weekly has pointed out, this track is almost a sequel of sorts as Haden Church goes into vintage smart-ass mode while Giamatti plays the straight man and tries to keep things on track by occasionally commenting on what we are seeing. Haden Church then proceeds to deflate this by delivering ironic statements like, ""Also, I love your head in this scene,"" in a deadpan style that is very funny.

Also included are seven deleted scenes with written introductions by Payne that explain why they were cut. Most of this footage was rightly excised, including a nasty subplot involving a dog being hit and killed by Miles' car.

Rounding out the DVD is a theatrical trailer and a ""Behind-the-Scenes Featurette"" that is pretty standard stuff with clips of Payne and the cast talking about the movie mixed with clips from the movie.",1114128000,2,3031,4.8757281553398055
2240412,4,B0007RUSGW,"Alexander Payne's Sideways is a very funny, but deep movie about two friends, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church), who travel up to wine country for a weeklong bachelor party for Jack.  Miles is a depressed divorcee who is an English teacher, but is trying to get a novel published while Jack is a womanizing former soap opera star that is making a living doing voiceovers.  Miles is also a major oenophile and wine plays a huge part in the film.  Miles & Jack go out to dinner at a restaurant Miles frequents while he's in the area and they meet a waitress, Mya (Virginia Madsen), that Jack tries to hook Miles up with.  Jack falls for a server at a vineyard, Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who ends up being friends with Mya and the four have dinner and end up spending time together.  Through it all Miles can't break out of his depression and Jack ends up paying a price for his sexual dalliances.  All four lead actors are excellent, but Mr. Giamatti is the heart and soul of the film.  He gives a brilliant performance and his lack of an Academy Award nomination will go down as one of the biggest snubs in history.  The one problem with the film is that the last half-hour is quite slow and doesn't live up to rest of the picture.  Other than that, Sideways is an excellent film. Mr. Payne's Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar is well deserved as the dialogue is funny, thought-provoking and never dull.",1114128000,3,1414,4.4921875

There is too much of the ""f"" word and video-sexual union outside of marriage for this reviewer.  I don't find this comedy that I enjoy nor recommend for others to watch.  A friend recommended this having heard of all its rewards won.  Other moral standards than this reviewer, for sure.  Stealing from one's mother, and other substandard morals are displayed.

The contrast between the two friends is dramatic. One has conscience pangs, while the other just is used to letting his yearnings control his life.  Was any other viewer's pulling for the one standing up for principles and faithfulness.  The two women they engage seem to exhibit this same disparity.  I was drawn to the character who didn't really want to engage in petting on the first encounter.

The beautiful wine country backdrops give the movie such a unique  'California cool' vibe too and also the laid back , cool jazz music from the very 1st scene at Miles apartment.

Around Oscar time I'd heard some buzz about it, but I really didn't know what to expect (and I'm always a little suspicious of such effervescence anyway). During the two hours I was hooked to the headphones, I became hooked on this movie.  A wonderful gem, it is a rarity in its elegant simplicity.  The human comedy of the four characters who collide over the course of a wine-imbued weekend is alternately touching and laugh-out-loud.  There is no standout character because the main character IS the ensemble comprised of the four main actors. Such remarkable chemistry within an ensemble is also rare, which means they were likely well-directed (kudos to Alexander Payne).  Sandra Oh is someone I'd seen only once before, and her unusual features and quirkiness just beg to get more camera time---more movies with Sandra, please.  Virginia Madsen managed to convey tremendous sexiness/heat/compassion/passion while waxing almost Shakespeare-poetic---terrific actress.  Thomas Hayden Church has to be one of the most rubber-faced, he's-so-ugly-he's-cute actors and, while the character could have been unsympathetic to the audience, Church played it to perfection so that we felt sorrow and pity for him.  Finally, Paul Giamatti is no one I've seen in anything (who's he?), but his talent in conveying charm, pathos, hope and determination rivaled even the greatest of the classic clowns of cinema. Great film, great performances, how could I give it less than five stars?  The only thing I'm concerned about is that it'll negatively impact the sales of Merlot!",1113955200,5,1706,5.129963898916968

Gross and pointless.  The movie just drags on and didn't touch me in any way mostly cause I think mid life crisis is such an excuse for people to blame others and forces beyond their control for the failures in their life.  I think even people searching for meaning in their life would be thinking thank god I'm not as bad as these two losers.

2240419,5,B0007RUSGW,"Nominated for five Academy Awards, and winner of Best Screenplay adapted from an outside source, Sideways turned out to be one of the surprise blockbusters of 2004. Based on the Rex Pickett novel of the same name, Sideways is a clever comedy about wine, life, and a group of friends - each in search of his unique identity. Unlike the plot-driven movies that traditionally dominate Hollywood, Sideways is one of those rare pictures which actually ""reads"" like a novel. The film resembles Seinfeld in that it's really about nothing, but it's about everything all at the same time. With very little to speak of in the way of plot, the movie relies heavily on the development of its quirky characters, and in this aspect, Sideways is an overwhelming success. Something about this movie (which I can't quite put my finger on) makes me love it, and I'm willing to bet that you'll enjoy it too...

Paul Giamatti plays the role of Miles Raymond, a middle-aged, recently-divorced high school teacher struggling to publish his novel, The Day After Yesterday (which is, of course, ""today"" - but it's not the same). The film begins when Miles picks up his college roommate Jack (Thomas Haden Church) for a one week bachelor party excursion into the vineyards of Napa Valley. With one week left as a single man, Jack is set for a week of drunkenness and debauchery - but Miles stands in his way. Suffering from a mild depression, Miles wants to savor wine rather than chug it, talk to a woman rather than sleep with her, and generally act as a drag on any of Jack's plans.

But when Jack pushes Miles to chase after his waitress friend Maya (Virginia Madsen), life takes a turn for Miles. Meanwhile Jack carries on a torrid affair with Maya's friend Stephanie (Sandra Oh), neither of the women knowing of Jack's impending marriage. When the truth about Jack's wedding slips out, the tidbit threatens to destroy each character's relationship with the other...

Oftentimes hilarious, sometimes deeply symbolic, Sideways runs the gambit of human emotion. In addition, the lack of a manufactured plot template serves the purpose of keeping the audience on edge. You never quite know what to expect next. Thomas Haden Church (formerly of Lowell Mather fame on Wings, one my all-time favorite sitcoms) shows his diversity as an actor in his fascinating portrayal of the aggressive, hormone-driven Jack. Determined to live out a wild week of drunken sexual conquest before his wedding day, Jack's self-destructive binge behavior stands in stark contrast to the paralyzed, low risk attitude of Miles. Together, Haden Church and Giamatti create an unforgettable screen combination.

And it's this powder keg mixture of relationships between Jack, Miles, Maya, and Stephanie that give Sideways its enticing cinematic flavor. Virginia Madsen received her own Academy Award nomination to go along with Thomas Haden Church, but the Oscar nominations could just as easily have gone to Paul Giamatti and Sandra Oh. In short, Sideways wanders the hills of California wine country as well as the peeks and valleys of the human experience. It's a film about life and decisions and relationships and happiness and everything else. More importantly, it's one of the most interesting and entertaining films of the last several years, and that's why Sideways is a definite must-see film...

2240420,2,B0007RUSGW,"I love a smart, well written, quirky movie. 'Sideways' was none of these. It had potential, with great actors, a good , but overused premise (getting married this weekend so I want to party with my buddy and get ____.) There were definitely some good spots, Stephanie pounding away with her helmet, but as a whole, very disappointing. The whole pretentious wine-geek theme got old  very early on. These fellas and gals could have just as easily been sports fanatics or techno-dweebs without adding or subtracting from the tired story line. The characters lacked dimension and never actually strayed from their initial presentation, they learned nothing, overcame anything, or scored life victories over adversity, they merely cheated their way out of jams.  This film has been called 'quirky' and 'smart'. I would agree, if we could also apply the same words to 'Porky's""",1113955200,5,871,5.083916083916084
2240421,5,B0007RUSGW,"Believe all the hype that you have heard on this film it is absolutely wonderful in so many ways.

Meet Miles (Paul Giamatti) and his engaged friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) as they embark upon a last effort at freedom before Jack heads down the aisle. Miles is a hapless writer struggling to overcome a breakup with an old flame and Jack is every woman's worst nightmare...that really stupid, overly sexy man who lies like a fiend! The friends end up going for a tour of wineries, Miles is obsessed with Pinot Grigio and Jack with sex. As they spend a week together things start to unravel because of lost dreams, new lives and selfish indulgences that lead to broken hearts along the way. The boys meet a couple of bright and wonderful women who add to the fiasco. A waitress (Virginia Madsen) coming to terms with a divorce and a new way of life describes wine as only a true poet can. While a wild and exuberant wine pourer (Sandra Oh) indulges herself in more than one area. So it is a week of laughter, disappointment, rage and discovery for all the parties involved. But the wine is the true star!

This film is written lyrically and it flows like the wine which remains its sub-textural subject. It deals with the complexities of relationships the same way that wineries deal with their crops, some are quick and tart while others have to sit before they build their full bouquets. The acting is phenomenal offering both comic and emotional depth in each of the characters. Madsen is luminous and has the best lines; her character probably the best soul. Giamatti is subtle yet hilarious as the unconfident man with a heart of gold. Church makes women swoon and then cringe but he also makes viewers laugh out loud.

Sideways is basically two middle-age guys on a road trip. That's it. I might understand if they were placed in interesting situations, but they aren't. Sadly, it's pretty boring. And it's made even worse because the main characters are poorly developed. Miles is depressed and in a mid-life crisis, but do we know why? No. There is no real insight given to the audience as to why he is the way he is. And he's not a very good person, so without understanding the reason behind his motives, we cannot identify with the protagonist. The only thing I knew about Miles is that he is selfish and depressed.

2240427,5,B0007RUSGW,"I generally don't make a point of responding to previous Amazon reviewers critiques of movies that I enjoy but seeing how I so loved "" Sideways "" I feel the over-whelming need to throw in my two cents regarding this magnificent film and question the venom mixed with a particular brand of animosity that many critics here have heaped upon this film. For those of you who seem to especially loath this movie ( and you know who you are! ) you may wish to stop reading here as I have no intention of damning "" Sideways "" with faint praise. Let the accolades begin!

A good starting off point might very well be that many film-goers fully expected "" Sideways "" to be little more then a flat-out comedy. Rather a ' boys adventure ' with beautiful scenery and a few healthy guffaws as we watch the misadventures of Miles and Jack all wrapped up with a nice and tidy predictable Hollywood ending. If that was indeed your expectations when viewing this film then you truly were in for a huge disappointment. "" Sideways "" encompasses not just comedy ( and an extremely black comedy at that! ) but also a healthy dose of drama with a sprinkle of suspense thrown in. Miles, played by the remarkable Paul Giammatti, portraying a teacher/writer ( unpublished at that! ) who is essentially an 'everyman' who when it comes to life is the perennial sad sack. He's simply a man who goes thru life with his tail between his legs and fully expects life to hit him square in the face at every juncture. Miles is portrayed not as a sympathetic character and that is important to remember. He's self-absorbed and when at first we are introduced to him it doesn't take long for us to have ambivalent feelings about our protagonist. But there are several issues which are key here...1) is that most men can identify with a character such as this as life continues to throw things at us that we are ill prepared for. Miles is not unlike you and me and I suspect many of thse who dislike this movie are perhaps uncomfortable with that fact. Miles is the perennial downer who never got to go to the prom, never achieved success in his chosen field and whose history with women is little more then one disastrous relationship after yet another. Its not a character that deserves much empathy from the viewer but it is one in which we can, at one time or another, certainly identify with. If not then you have most definitely lead a charmed life! 2) Is that like many of us Miles secretly seeks redemption in the oddest of places. For most men it might the love of a good woman. But for Miles not only is he searching for his 'soul mate' ( I hate that term but it fits so what the heck! ) but he also finds solace and comfort in his one true passion. That of course being a good bottle of wine. The wine acts as a metaphor for what Miles truly believes in and it creates a certain nurturing aspect that is missing from his hum-drum existence.

What truly, for me at least, turned this film from being simply good to arguably a great movie experience is that as "" Sideways "" developes we unknowlingly turn a sympathetic eye toward Miles and ultimately by the end of the movie are cheering him on and crossing our fingers for our very own 'happy ending.' What director Alexander Payne does so effectively is to let his characters develope at their very own pace, knowing full well that as more and more of Miles character is revealed the audience will begin to understand and empathize with his faults and liabilities. That is key in a movie such as this and if one walks into the theatre, watches the character and passes a quick value judgement without any sense of compassion and understanding then in the case of "" Sideways "" your expereince will be a disappointing one. But as a viewer we stay with Miles, learn form his odd sense of narcissism and begin to care then as a movie-going experience our lives will be enriched ten-fold. I know mine was!

Overall, "" Sideways "" is a movie with many layers and dimensions. Some truly inspired comedic moments i.e. Jack and Miles purposefully wrecking Miles car so as to help convince Jacks soon-to-be-bride of the fictitious story in order to help his friend out of yet another predicament. Yet there are some terribly moving episodes as well such as Miles and his recently divorced waitress/friend Virginia Madsen explaining to the other as to their heart-felt devotion to wine. Its moments like these that makes "" Sideways "" a movie that like a fine bottle of wine ( and no Merlot please! ) simply gets better and more fully appreciated with the passing of time.",1113696000,4,4582,4.491606714628297

2240431,1,B0007RUSGW,"If wine quality is a metaphor for the lives of these two protagonists, it must be very, very sour wine.  This movie reflected the lives of two less than admirable guys.  One of them starts out by stealing from his mother, and he goes downhill from there.  He is an English teacher, which I would have thought would be an admirable profession, but he seems to hate it.  He has no admirable qualities, none at all.  He goes on and on about wine, and all that meant to me was that wine aficionados are shallow, empty people who specialize in a knowledge which is trivial at best, irrelevant at worst.  The other guy has a little more on the ball, but his last week before his marriage has been less than exemplary.

There is no saving grace in this movie.  It moves, ever so slowly, from one boring situation to another, specializing in the frowns and depression of the would-be author and true-life loser.  If I got one thing from this terrible, terrible movie, it is that I will never have any respect for anyone who talks wine . .

Don't waste your time with this one.  The only people who can appreciate this tripe are probably those who will not admit how bad it is  . . . trying to pretend there is something here . . . like the people raving about modern art that they will not admit they know nothing about . . when in actuality it was painted by an Elephant or a Chimpanzee.  What a disappointing movie, and waste of two hours!",1113609600,17,1433,4.302238805970149
2240432,1,B0007RUSGW,"WOW!  What over rated garbage.  This movie was/is wildly popular because its a mirror image of much of white America. Middle aged, depressed, whining, philandering, self loathing idiots one of which is on Xanax which I think you have to be on to even watch this drivel.  This is something to glorify?  Sad to see so many lost souls out there.

I am so happy that my friend bought and lent me this movie so I didn't have to use my free movie reserve that I have at my local video store because I would have been upset if I did.  My friend paid $14.95 for this!  Better her then me.

You can just picture people after have watching this going to their little coffee houses, pontificating on this crap and comparing their own lives to this.  How sad.  It fills me with a nameless dread how these sheep run to the liquor stores to try all these wines (pinot whatever the &*%$)mentioned in the movie because of course these people can't think for themselves and need someone to dictate the latest trend.

I gave this movie one star only because its an accurate description of these white crackers (i'm white by the way) If anything this movie just assures me more and more of what I do NOT WANT out of life. I was hoping that the ever whiny loser Miles would blow his head off but alas this didn't happen.  Self Indulgent Garbage!",1113523200,8,1325,4.363265306122449
2240433,5,B0007RUSGW,"Alex Payne, an alum from the same Catholic Jesuit high school in Omaha that I attended, I find to be one of the most honest and fresh directors that film has had in a long time. His movies aren't cute or fantasy, they are dead on reality, situations people face and things that they think about. He emphasizes this truth in casting relative unknowns in his movies (besides the occassional star like Nicholson), filming them with the perfect background music, shots of nature, and other great techniques. ""Sideways"" is no exception, as two best friends take a road trip together to California wine country. One is a depressed, divorced man on much medication, while the other is a laid back, B-list actor who is tying the knot after the trip. The movie has much dark comedy to it, much in typical Alex Payne fashion. Great writing, acting, everything. Beautiful movie, go see it today!",1113523200,3,884,4.746753246753247
2240434,2,B0007RUSGW,"May I ask, who in Hollywood thinks it's a great idea to make ""comedies""  about depressed, self-centered, pasty white guys? The best scene in the movie is when Sandra Oh clobbers the philandering and--did I mention--self-centered Haden Church character. I recommend that you don't always fall for the hype.",1113523200,8,305,5.224489795918367
2240435,5,B0007RUSGW,"Fact: Alexander Payne is one of America's most exciting filmmakers. Not because he delivers slick, cobalt-tinged thrillers or CG-fuelled sci-fi swirlers, of course... In fact, his material is placed very deliberately at the other end of the spectacle spectrum. Payne is concerned with the mundane: his is a USA where Jack Nicholson travels the freeways not perched on the back of a Harley, but slumped at the wheel of a Winnebago. He and co-writer Jim Taylor don't need to worry about being cool or spectacular, because, in the likes of Election, About Schmidt and now Sideways, they've mastered the most important element of storytelling: character. They're not concerned with heroes, just people: small people, bruised people, rumpled people - people like Miles (an Oscar-deserving Paul Giamatti), a depressed, divorced wannabe novelist, who has an encyclopedic knowledge of wine but can't even remember how old his mother is. Or people like Miles' crass buddy Jack (Thomas Haden Church), whose rugged good looks are starting to melt, and who uses this as an excuse to cram as much sex as possible into his final week of bachelorhood. Making these people interesting is one thing; making them likeable is another, and Payne and Taylor achieve this not in spite of, but because of, their flaws. It's quite a feat - Miles and Jack don't so much get under your skin as climb inside your heart. One scene in particular strikes you hard: while clumsily, reluctantly attempting to seduce waitress and fellow vinophile Maya (an excellent, back-from-obscurity Virginia Madsen), Miles explains why he rates the Pinot grape above any other. Because it's thin-skinned, he says, temperamental, requiring patient nurturing... He's oblivious to the fact he's really describing himself, but Maya isn't. Payne and Taylor's script sings melodiously in every scene, their acuteness of observation perfectly servicing both the drama and the comedy (you'll giggle at Miles pretentiously holding his finger to his ear as he inhales a wine's aroma), while they're not afraid to occasionally force it broad and farcical, thereby supplying some hearty belly-laughs. It may suffer a slight second-act sag, but as with its characters, Sideways' flaws are no obstacle to loving it.",1113523200,2,2256,5.252077562326869
2240436,3,B0007RUSGW,"I think the previews mis-lead the viewers of this film. I mean no way was this the funniest movie of the year. It's not even that funny. It's well acted though. I don't know why Paul Giamatti (Big Fat Liar, Planet of the Apes) wasn't nominated though. He probably deserved it more than Thomas Haden Church (Wings, 3000 Miles to Graceland ), athough he's great too.

  It's about 2 wine tasters and bestfriends who go on one last trip together before Haden Church's character gets married. Church is a jerk though basically and just cares about getting laid before getting married more than spending time with Giamatti. Once he finds someone he doesn't tell her the truth and just uses her for sex. Well yes he does wanna hang with Giamatti and cheer him up. He'd still rather ditch him for a chinese lady he's cheating on his future wife with though.

  It's Giamatti who you want things to work out for because he's the better guy . Well although he is a self-centered complainer that steals money from his mother. He still has some heart felt moments and has great chemestry  with Virginia Madsen (Candyman). I don't really know why the movie was praised so much. It's good but it reminded me a lot of Alexander Payne's last film About Schmidt. He goes on a road trip too but without the wine tasting or the sex. The pacing and the style are the same though.",1113523200,3,1360,4.504065040650406

Althought the acting was spectacular and the writing was quality, the pace and flow of the film just didn't keep me enthralled. I struggled to relate to any of the characters and couldn't laugh at the gags as they came by. I always ask myself after watching a film when or if I would see it again. With this film I felt no desire to watch it again. For DVD fans though, the commentary track of this film was fantastic--and in my opinion, more entertaining than the film itself.",1113523200,4,548,4.278846153846154
2240438,5,B0007RUSGW,"Miles is your basic middle-age mope, a passive-aggressive depressive with a stalled life: He's got a failed marriage, a manic mother, a 750-page novel that no one will publish and a regrettable tendency to dial while drunk. ""I've stopped caring,"" he intones, ""to hell with it."" Problem is, Miles does care, cares too much, and numbs out all that caring with Prozac and a nightly glass (okay, bottle) of some really fine wine from one of his many trips to Napa Valley. This is the guy you see at cocktail parties, the one who carries on a little too long and a little too loudly about wine husbandry. (""Quaffable. But far from transcendent."") He's the guy who never gets the girl, or if he does he doesn't get her for very long, hence the drunken dialing. ""Sideways"" may sound depressing, but it's far from bleak. Director Alexander Payne (""Election,"" ""About Schmidt"") manhandles well the terrain of the lonely loser. Humor wins over pathos, as in the scene in which Miles, on a heroic mission to retrieve his buddy's wallet from a suburban tract home of a married conquest, is chased out of the house by the woman's husband, a raging naked guy in a skullcap who slams his considerable paunch, naughty bits and all, against the car window. It's a choke-on-your-popcorn moment, and yet it never feels unbelievable. Miles, as played by Paul Giamatti in the wonderfully understated film, is an Everynerd who started out with a semblance of promise and somehow got off track, oh, a decade or so ago. Giamatti's middle school English teacher can't seem to connect with anyone, let alone his students. His idea of a good time is retiring with a glass of pinot noir and the latest issue of Barely Legal. So it's a major stretch beyond his comfort zone when he agrees to go on a road trip with another loser, his college buddy, Jack (Thomas Haden Church), a soap star who was once sorta famous but now is mostly known for his work in spray starch commercials. Jack's getting married in a week, an event he's approaching with the ambivalence unique to an aging pretty boy: He knows his skirt-chasing days are numbered, but he's still chasing. So they drive up and around Napa Valley, squabbling, sucking back wine and wooing women. Jack thinks the answer to all Miles's problems is to be found in the sack: ""You need to get your joint worked on,"" he tells him. Miles can't understand why Jack is obsessed with getting laid when he's getting married in a week. Eventually they take up with two women they encounter in wine country: Stephanie (Sandra Oh), a single mom a little too eager to anoint Jack with instant stepdaddyhood; and Maya (Virginia Madsen), a world-weary waitress/grad student who knows her way around a winery. ""The pinot grape,"" Miles tells Maya, ""needs constant care and attention. . . . It's not a survivor."" Replies Maya: ""A bottle of wine is constantly alive, evolving, until it peaks. Then it begins its decline."" They are, of course, talking about themselves, dancing the awkward two-step of courtship, baring bruised souls. It is a lovely moment until, that is, Miles breaks the spell. He wants this woman, but he's terrified. Nothing much happens in this movie, and then everything happens. There's not a false note here, and the entire supporting cast -- Madsen, Oh, Church and Marylouise Burke as Miles's Mother -- is uniformly excellent. It rambles along at its own good-natured pace, playing both for laughs and for laments, stretching out a tad too long, but who cares, really? The film's a welcome ramble. Giamatti, as demonstrated in his attention-grabbing turn as comic-book writer Harvey Pekar in ""American Splendor,"" is the master of mopes. His is a mug that registers heartbreak with a downward glance, an imperceptible shift in facial musculature. His Miles is a man whose life is defined by regret, a man who the audience keeps hoping will put down the wine glass and get to living.",1113523200,3,3911,4.778434268833087
2240439,5,B0007RUSGW,"'Sideways' was a wonderfully written film. It's funny, offensive, and touching at the same time.  The characters have a reality to them that you rarely see in films nowadays.

What I've noticed in a lot of user reviews, is surprisement in reaction to some of the characters actions.  This movie, is not entirely easy to watch.  It's about two men, who in different ways, are not completely happy with their lives.  Miles is the cynic, completely negative and bitter since his divorce and continual bad luck with attempting to get his book published. He has a slight drinking problem, and a love for wine. His friend is a complete womanizer and such a b*astard that you feel no sympathy for him.

They do and say things that many would find inappropriate, but it really works in this film.  This isn't a super-happy-everybody wins kind of movie, which I think alot of people were expecting.  It has a dark humor to it, along with a wonderful emtional depth to it that seems real.

Is it a movie for everyone?  No, not neccesarily.  But if you can be open-minded and want to experience something a little more deeper then the standard junk that is churned out like 'Meet the Parents', then see 'Sideways' immedietly.",1113523200,2,1214,4.679245283018868
2240440,5,B0007RUSGW,"ALEXANDER Payne, the clear-sighted director of ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt,"" always treats his characters' flaws with compassion, and his latest keenly observed comedy is the most humanistic yet. With ""Sideways,"" he has crafted a sublime variation on the buddy road movie, infusing the midlife crises of the two main protagonists with hope and poetry.

Out in sun-soaked California wine country, this mellow character study features four of the most fully realized personalities seen on-screen this year, each brought to life by a top-notch performance. Payne and his longtime writing partner Jim Taylor have sculpted a near-flawless screenplay, awash with poignant observations and subtle humor, and studded with hilarious moments of high farce. Paul Giamatti, the busy character actor who broke out of the perennial-sidekick ghetto with last year's ""American Splendor,"" gives a career-defining performance as Miles, a middle-school English teacher, failed novelist and often amusingly affected wine connoisseur (""[It has] a flutter of, like, a nutty Edam cheese."") Giamatti's hangdog looks have never been used to such great effect.

Miles, still sulking and pining two years after his divorce (""She had the best palate of any woman I've known""), can look achingly forlorn, but he is also capable of exploding into funny-but-sad fits of passionate rage. He is paired in this odd-couple road movie with his old college buddy Jack (the ruggedly handsome Thomas Haden Church, of the 1990s TV series ""Wings""). Jack is a washed-up TV actor and a certified horndog, about to marry into a wealthy Armenian family. Miles decides to take the groom-to-be to the beautiful Santa Ynez Valley on a weeklong tour of the vineyards, golf courses and taverns as a kind of two-man, last-hurrah bachelor party. The two fortysomethings are operating at cross purposes - Miles, a devotee of pinot noir, is excited about treating his palate to some fine wine, while Jack, a dedicated party boy who talks in California dude-speak, can barely tell a red from a white. His objective is twofold: to have as many flings as possible before his wedding, and to hook Miles up with a woman to lift him out of his funk.

Enter two beautiful, strong, together female characters - a rare treat for grown-up moviegoers. Stephanie (Sandra Oh), a sexy, motorbike-riding wine pourer, immediately catches Jack's eye, and he woos her full-tilt without letting on about his impending wedding. As Jack and Stephanie indulge in a series of enthusiastic romps, Miles shyly tries to make time with Stephanie's friend Maya (a wonderful Virginia Madsen), a waitress at his favorite restaurant who shares his passion for wine. The hesitant courtship dance between Miles and Maya is lovely, and one of the most realistic ever committed to film.

Whether it's Maya delivering a breathtakingly seductive soliloquy about wine as ""a living thing"" or Miles waxing lyrical about the properties of the pinot grape, each line of dialogue has a dual meaning that cleverly reveals something about the speaker. It's a joy to watch comedy unfold so naturally, the laughs gently teased out from our growing knowledge of the characters, their imperfections, doubts and, yes, emotional pain.",1113523200,3,3231,5.2437137330754355
2240441,5,B0007RUSGW,"I love this movie.  I wanted something different, like ""Eternal Sunshine ..."" and ""Motorcycle Diaries,"" and I got it with this film.  I hate all that blockbuster crap.  This was for me.  Miles and Jack are quintessential anti-heroes, and that's just so refreshing.  Their adventures are comic, poignant, absurd, but feel so real for some reason.  I don't think the DVD does justice to the real joy of this movie, which is to see it in a theater.  I also didn't much care for Giamatti's and Church's voice over commentary.  All they talked about was their body image issues -- unenlightening.  But that doesn't take away from the greatness of this movie.  I look forward to an Alexander Payne movie more than just about anyone else out there making movies.  He doesn't patronize or condescend to us like that stupid movie, ""Finding Neverland.""  He's not into easy answers, fuzzy good feelings.  He's not afraid to wound us, infuriate us, or even risk alienating us.  That's what makes him so great.

Giamatti and Church are amazing.  Madsen is lovely.  Oh doesn't do much for me, but then she never has.

2240445,4,B0007RUSGW,"""Sideways"" is an exceptionally fine comedy/drama for adults.

This is the story of Miles and Jack [Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church]. Each has a mid-life crisis in full swing. Miles solution has been to become a wine expert, a pursuit that gives him intellectual satisfaction. Perhaps even better, it also gives him justification to drink a great deal. While Miles is still recovering from a bitter divorce, Jack's answer is to get married. Just before the nuptials, the guys take a road trip together to California's wine country. Miles, a frustrated writer, tries to teach Jack the intricacies of wine, but Jack is more interested in the intricacies of women. For him, the trip is just an excuse to have one last fling before settling down to married life. [We suspect Jack is just kidding himself!]

Giamatti and Church are excellent. They create memorable characters. Equally memorable are Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh as Maya and Stephanie, the women the boys become involved with.

""Sideways"" is about equal parts drama and comedy, but it may be remembered more as a comedy because it contains many truly funny scenes. The movie remains true to itself right up to the ending, which is hopeful rather than happy.",1113436800,2,1224,4.932038834951456

Miles, somehow when you're not looking, steals your heart.  Miles is a complex man whose grief, sorrow, and regret keeps the audience emotionally invested.  I found myself wanting to know more about wine and their histories, too.  Paul Giamatti was definitely robbed of an Oscar nomination, however, it was year of great male performances.

Are we expected to believe that two boring, ugly, aging guys can attract two fabulous, interesting, hot women?  Are we expected to believe that it's OK and fun to steal from your mother and lie to women?  Are we expected to believe that the camera can't get any reasonably attractive shots of vineyards?

If you have a heart, and a palette (for wine), Sideways will do more for you than any other movie in a long while.  It isn't a monster action flick.  Yes it touches on depression and addiction and failed dreams.  Yet it is also about finding hope in the context of middlelife despair, not all that different from finding that special bottle of wine in a sea of mediocrity (my corner wine store).  And speaking for finding good wine, if you love vino and liked the ""indie"" feel of this movie , I also recommend Lynch's Inspiring Thirst and Oldman's Guide to Outsmarting Wine, both recent releases that are high quality excursions through the vintners art.",1113350400,4,867,4.490445859872612

What a lousy flick. It was an inane, pointless movie that portrayed yet another depressed character coming to grips with his life which really isn't at all harder to live than the rest of our lives and oh sad sob me I'm having relationship issues and no one will publish my novel and I hide the fact that I'm a raving alcoholic behind this facade of an overtly cult-like connisuer of wines. And then his friend: the truly modern man? My god, no wonder women think men are pigs. I'm not arguing that men are not like this, but come on.

Whether Payne and others see him as balding, whining middle-aged man, or whether that's all he remembers how to do, he's become very boring.  I hope Virginia Madsen's character has the good sense to let him down gently!

Now, would you like to see a balding, whining middle-aged man really go through hell?  Click on over to ""Red Lights"" where Jean-Pierre Darroussin gives a gripping performance as a man under serious pressure.

Yes, the essence of wine as a metaphor of the lives we lead, our hopes for the future and our struggles, occassionally, to glimpse the light in our lives through the haze.  It's all about making choices, moral or immoral, and its effects on those who surround us.

2240453,2,B0007RUSGW,"Well unlike some reviewers, I have never lost my sense of smell, and to me, this movie was quite the stinker.

  Call me old-fashioned, but in order to enjoy a movie I must ""like"" the (at least one)characters or at least be able to relate to them. In ""Sideways"" we find a man who wallows in his own pity, a man who only wants to ""score"" one more time before he gets married despite the obvious costs... and oh yeah... a woman who is ""responsible"" enough to hide the joint she is smoking when her small son walks into the room.  Talk about a depressing cast of characters!  There is no one who I ""root"" for - they all seem like they are getting the miserable life that they deserve.

  So why do some many people ""LOVE"" this movie? I will be the first to admit, that the acting is top-notch. The scenery was great - I truly felt transported to California wine country. So the movie almost seemed like a mini-vacation. However, those were really the only good points to the entire picture. I found the story either slow or at times even tedious. While I learned something about wine tasting -it isn't knowledge that I really needed (although I am positive some really enjoyed this aspect). In short, this movie reminds of what my friends say about beer (I am not a drinker) it is an acquired taste... and I think that is the perfect description of ""Sideways"" - a taste I defintely have not acquired.",1113264000,5,1397,4.387596899224806
2240454,5,B0007RUSGW,"Living in a society where the public demands popcorn films with no character depth and paper-thin storylines does not allow for many good films to be produced.  So it is remarkable that ""Sideways"" even came about.  It isn't Hollywood-friendly.  The lead is a middle aged, overweight, short balding man.  But what makes ""Sideways"" so brilliant is that it does not play to the audience.  This feels like a film that was made for someone instead of just a mass of people to make money and it is in that compassion that a great film was made.

The writing is top notch.  Laced with humor, depression, akwardness, hopelessness AND hope the characters are driven to each other.  All of them are at crossroads in their life and are looking for some sort of stability.  The wine is used as a metaphor for the characters, Miles in particular, and his explaination of the pinot is an obvious juxedposition.

These characters are wonderfully written and the actors know this.  Paul Giamatti turns in an Oscar-calibre performance, even if he was snubbed by the Academy.  Virginia Madsen's monologue about wine is extremely touching and and some of the best writing seen in a while and by far the best delivered moment in the film.  Thomas Hayden Church and Sandra Oh together drive the akwardness of Miles and Maya's seemingly adolescent courting.

This is a prime example of having all the right elements together at the right time.  The chemistry between the direction, writing, cinematography and acting were completely in tune with each other and the result was something magical.",1113264000,3,1572,4.879245283018868

Additionally, other than brief moments regarding these actresses there was nothing redeeming or important about these characters (any of them) that made you cheer or feel for any of them. You simply do not care about any of these people - oh except for the sadness you feel for the mother that gets ripped off by the son she is so proud of... SO SAD and pathetic!

2240456,1,B0007RUSGW,This movie is one of the most over rated movies of 2004. My wife and I had another couple over this past weekend to watch this movie and by the time we had reached the the 1/2 way point we were no longer paying attention. The story is very weak and characters are shallow and gave you no reason to care for what they did. This movie is so forgettable it will be in the $5 bin at your local department store in less than six months.,1113264000,15,431,3.9655172413793105

2240458,5,B0007RUSGW,"The first thing that struck me about this movie was that it so California. The movie tries to capture that elusive, intangible quality that makes California just a great state to live in, and drive around and enjoy life.

The second thing that struck me was how much I learnt about grapes and wines. The film goes into details about the different kinds of grapes and wine, and how fine wine is made. If you pay close attention you might pick up a couple of tips. For instance, I did not know that Pinot is a thin-skinned and temperamental grape that needs constant attention and care.

This is basically a wine-based roadtrip movie that Miles  (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church)take before Jack gets married. Miles is a wine afficianado and a divorced struggling writer, who teaches to support himself, while Jack is an actor. The pair travel around the wine country area north of Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, and get into some interesting situations that almost ruins Jack's wedding.  In the process of the roadtrip Miles comes to terms with his divorce and moves on.

What I liked about the movie was the easy flow of narration combined with some excellent acting from the actors. There are many times I have made the same trip as the pair, but I missed out on those vineyards, and the next time I make a similar roadtrip I am going to stop and taste the wines.",1113177600,4,1377,4.58130081300813

While all four actors clearly benefit from the work of a skilled airbrush artist, I am in disbelief at how ""pretty"" Giamatti is made to look on it...so alien, so not him.

2240462,1,B0007RUSGW,"I'm completely flummoxed as to how this movie received the rave reviews that it did. And why on earth is it considered a comedy? It didn't elicit as much as a grin let alone a chuckle. The main character, Miles, is a middle school English teacher who has been trying to write a book but has been a failure at that endeavor. Not surprising. He's a man who has no qualms about stealing hundreds of dollars from his mother on the one hand but is disgusted by his buddy's infidelity and lack of morals on the other hand. This empty, pathetic character seems to believe that the taste of wine matters. That being able to taste subtle differences in wine ""varietals"" gives him class. And a man who reads a porn magazine entitled ""Barely Legal"" is hardly someone you'd want teaching middle school kids. Miles' buddy, Jack, is even more pathetic. It's as if he's forever stuck in adolescence and he doesn't even want to move forward. It's humiliating to watch an adult behave in such a childish way. And his girlfriend for the week is just as bad. Already has one kid whom she leaves with her mother most of the time. And brings home a guy she just met in a bar and her claim to fame is she has sex like an animal. None of the characters in the movie (except maybe Mia) would be someone you'd want for a friend and have over for dinner, so why would we want to watch two hours of their stupidity?

2240467,5,B0007RUSGW,"The DVD of ""Sideways"" should be watched twice.  The first time without the commentary on so you can appreciate the terrific jazz score by Rolfe Kent that terrifically underscores the action on the screen.  Criminally, Kent's score was not even nominated for an Oscar.  The commentary track by the film's stars Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church is indispensible and not to be missed.  This pair have infinite clever bon mots about the action on the screen and the making of the film.  As for the film itself it is a humorous account of two college buddies, one depressive the other libidinous, who go on an extended bachelor party through California wine country.  In the process they learn about life, love, themselves, some of it painful, some of it wickedly hilarious.  Director Alexander Payne with this film and his previous comic masterworks, ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"" continues to rise to the upper echelon of American filmmakers.  We can thank him for advancing the careers here of Paul Giamatti, star of last year's brilliant ""American Splendor"", Thomas Haden Church, best known for his work in sitcoms, ""Wings"" and ""Ned and Stacey"".  Particular mention should be made of his utilization of Virginia Madsen as Maya, the waitress that captures the heart of Giamatti's character, Miles.  Madsen had fallen from grace with the powers-that-be in Hollywood even though she delivered solid work in movies as diverse as the horror film ""Candyman"" and Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of John Grisham's ""The Rainmaker"".

2240468,5,B0007RUSGW,"Having read the outside of the DVD box after purchasing this movie, I fully expected it to be funny. It was not. At first I was disappointed, but grew to feel compassion toward the very sad main character Miles.

Miles is a depressed wannabe novelist, school teacher, wine connoisseur. He is divorced but still pining over his ex-wife. Meanwhile, his friend Jack is to be married in one week. Wanting one last fling together, Miles and Jack go on a road trip through the vineyards of California. Jack has an urgent need to sow his wild oats before he's tied down for life. Miles, just looks forward to the getaway and some extended time with his best friend. Their goals are very different. More than once, while Jack is running wild, Miles says, why can't we just relax and go back to the hotel room, maybe play some golf. He has little energy to socialize and is visibly awkward when he tries.

One night, Jack and Miles go to a restaurant that Miles has been to often. Maya, a recently divorced waitress, is happy to see Miles. Maya's friend and Jack get busy sewing the last of Jack's wild oats. Depressed, sad Miles, is too down to enjoy the company of Maya.

The remainder of the story details the events and adventures of the four main characters. There are a few funny moments and more than a few sad ones. This is actually a very serious movie about depression, loneliness, and eventually hope for a new beginning. Definitely very well worth watching!",1113004800,2,1460,4.564885496183206

It's a pathetic, chick-flick story of a guy who should have ""LOSER"" tattooed on his forehead and another guy who can't keep it in his pants. The loser, a divorced school teacher/wanna be author/wine snob, and his buddy (Thomas Haden Church) head for a week of fun in California's wine country before Church's wedding. Giamatti's character is such a loser he can't get a girl while Church's gets several.  Save your money and your time --  skip this one.",1113004800,9,769,4.774436090225564
2240470,4,B0007RUSGW,"""Sideways"" is a ""dramedy"" based on the novel of the same name by Rex Pickett. There is more drama than comedy, though, as middle-aged pals Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) set off on a week-long trip through California wine country just before Jack is to be married. Miles is a wine fanatic -connoisseur would be an understatement- intent on sending his friend off ""in style"" by guiding him through the finest wines California has to offer. Jack has other ideas. He wants to sow his wild oats before plunging into matrimony, and he thinks Miles should do the same. Miles has been morose, self-deafeatist, and uncomfortable around the opposite sex since his divorce 2 years before. Through their adventures, they meet two women: Maya (Virginia Madsen), a soulful old acquaintance of Miles who enjoys wine as much as he does. And Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who pours wine at vineyard and likes adventure as much as Jack.

Every once in a while a ""food movie"" comes along, but I don't recall ever seeing a ""drink movie"" before now. ""Sideways"" is a drink movie, not to be confused with a ""drunk movie"", although there is a bit of that too. It does for wine what ""Big Night"" and ""Babette's Feast"" did for food. Oenophiles will probably enjoy ""Sideways"" for the passion it expresses for wine. I found the film only mildly comic, though, and the humor generally relies on Miles' neuroses or Jack's insensitivity. ""Sideways"" fault is that it makes dysfunction its central gag and plot device. Miles is simply not someone you'd want to be around if he were real. The story revolves around the men, but Maya and Stephanie are more interesting characters. ""Sideways"" is a solid adaptation, but 2 hours of characters who are essentially annoying wears on the audience, even if what they do is amusing.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005 release): Bonus features include 7 deleted scenes, 1 featurette, a theatrical trailer, and an audio commentary. The ""Behind-the-Scenes Featurette"" (6 minutes) features interviews with the 4 principle actors and director Alexander Payne in which they primarily discuss characters. In the audio commentary, actors Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church joke about their experiences filming  ""Sideways"". It sounds like they hit the booze before recording the commentary. There is an occasional piece of information in the commentary, but you'd have a hard time finding it amid all the chortling.

2240471,3,B0007RUSGW,"""Sideways"" has a lot going for it. Great acting, especially on the part of Paul Giamatti, realistic characters, and a very interesting subplot involving California wines and those who immerse themselves in them -- both as consumers and as students.

The film is about a couple of middle-aged guys, one of whom is about to get married, who want to spend a week having a good time before the ceremony. Predictably, this means that the groom-to-be is looking to hook up with as many women as possible before the big day. His travel companion (Giamatti) is a gloomy oenophile who can't get over the fact that his own marriage fell apart. He compensates by crawling inside a bottle -- not as a drinker, but as a wine aficionado. Studying wine makes up for the great hole in his emotional life. The mismatch between the temperament and aspirations of these two men is what many find charming about the film.

Still, I found the film disappointing. The gloom and aimlessness of Giamatti's character was almost palpable. And his sidekick's hedonism was less comical than pathetic. I couldn't find it in me to laugh at a man betraying his spouse-to-be so shamelessly, or another man who lived with so much pain. Still, the film was well done, if not the laff-riot it is thought to be.",1112918400,5,1275,4.6875

Someone in another review stated that only people in the latter 30 to early 40 age group would appreciate this film.  I fall into that category and could not bring myself to relate or appreciate this film at all.  The story was so horribly boring, even Hayden Church seemed to be strolling through the dialoge just to get the filming over with.

Kudos to those who put together the trailer for the film as it gave me something to look forward to.  It is too bad the end result was such a dissapointment.  Though the trailer did pick out some mildly humorous moments, they were not, by a long shot, the most humerous of the film (of which there were 2).  Even the good clips in the trailer were a let down when put into the context of the movie.

2240474,5,B0007RUSGW,"Many say 'Sideways' is a funny comedy, and that is not without truths.  But for anyone who knows something about so-called mid-life crisis, this film means much more than being a well-made comedy.  In short, 'Sideways' is a bitter-sweet tale about the life -- life with regrets and a little bit of hope -- and as that it is fantastic.

Nothing remarkable happens in 'Sideways.'  One English teacher (and recently divorced) Miles (Paul Giamatti) travels with his friend Jack (Thomas Hayden Church) around California tasting good Californian wine, playing golf, and having a double date with two women Maya (Virginia Madsen) and Stephanie (Sandra Oh).  Jack was a popular TV star (and an occasional TV commercian narrator) who is getting married in a week, and for him this is the last chance to be really 'free.'  In the menawhile, Miles has his own concern because he wants to be a writer though none of the publishers he submitted his manuscript wouldn't accept it, not even give a call to him.  And Miles vaguely senses that success is eluding him.

Nothing more attractive than the written story, but these characters and their emotions are so real, so amusing and often so painful that the film becomes a tour to get to know these people, whose virtues and even flaws start to look very adorable.  Jack is a hopeless case of womamizer, but we understand his personality, if not tolerate.  Miles ia haunted by the perpetual self-loathing habit, and we know it when he calls his ex-wife, asking if there could be a second chance.  Of course, there is not, we know it, and he knows it.  But he had to phone, and ask, and hates himself for doing that.

Though wine plays the integral part of the film, it does so not with some knowledge about vintages, but with a slyly concealed allegory about life.  I cannot reveal the part in detail, but at one scene, which virtually brought an Oscar nomination to Virginia Madsen, Miles and Maya talk about something in the candle-lit room.  Apprantly Miles talks about wine.  But we soon know Maya's answer to him means much deeper Miles initially suspected.  Don't miss this part, for this is one of the most touching moments in the movie history.  Surely Ms. Madsen deserves an Oscar nomination.

As every good comedy is ultimately talking about life, 'Sideways' is also about life.  A life that you think could be different, which could be still OK.  This film is such a precious experience to teach us that.",1112918400,2,2451,4.72

A well intentioned tour of California wine country between best friends - on the week before one's nuptials, turns into the classic road trip from hell.

Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church are so believable as best buds Miles and Jack that there seems to be very little acting going on, so instantly identifiable are they in these roles.  Two years into his divorce Miles (Giamatti) has sunk into a depressive funk so deep he is prone towards unintentionally but automatically sabotaging everything around him.  His latest novel is passed over for publication, and nothing is going right for him.  Jack (Haden Church) is a sunny-dispositioned, womanizing, has been soap actor eking out a life doing commercials and out for one last go at bachelor freedom.  Together, they are quite a pair.

During the trip they meet and woo local wine country gals Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen, each of them just about as different as the boys.

One of the highlights of the film - and not a comical one - is Virginia Madsen as Maya describing why she loves wine - describing the ""life"" of a bottle of wine in a manner that wine truly and instantly comes alive:  the words and Madsen's delivery of them is nothing less than astonishing, powerfully moving combining the sensual and spiritual.

Everything about Sideways resonated strongly, beautifully, sadly and hilariously for me.  Like a good wine, the older you get, the better this movie will be.",1112832000,,1624,4.764285714285714

Calling this movie a comedy is like calling Shaun of the Dead a ""romantic comedy with zombies."" Sort of. It's more like ""a mostly depressing movie with funny bits.""

Paul Giamatti and his sidekick conjure up two lifelike characters here, one a schoolteacher aspiring to be a writer, the other a second-string actor (with the attendant dumbness, affording us many great/funny moments). You know the basic story, so I'll skip it.

I wanted to quit it but also wanted to see what happened. It's funny, it's sad, it's interesting, it's hopeful, and ... it flows along at a pace that apparently enthralls certain circles, for reasons I don't understand (well, maybe I do).

The screenplay is the true standout here.  The actors are given so much depth and complexity to work with.  The characters are richly drawn, three dimensional and, at times, laugh-out-loud funny.  Not enough credit has been given to the direction, though.  It appears simple, unobtrusive, but is so smart.  There's a lot going on in the frame if one takes the time to study it.  Alexander Payne loves to load every image with a lot of symbolical detail -- the dark and light motif, e.g., people moving in opposite directions.  I totally agree with the reviewer who wrote about the other reviewers.  This is a film that draws that fine line between those who really care about cinema, those who really want something more out of a film than just a gratuitous experience, those who demand something when they go into a theater, and those who just want to stuff their face with popcorn.  It's almost as if a lot of people saw the film because they felt obligated to do so -- critics, etc. -- when they had no business being in the theater.  The film wasn't meant for them.  They're the ""Meet the Fockers"" crowd.  The people who have dumbed down our country, the people who give this country a bad name because they're so unrepentently uneducated, don't care what they ingest as long as it's highly caloric and doesn't make them think or feel in any way that they haven't recognized before.  ""Sideways"" is a gift of a film, something we don't see from Hollywood anymore.  A rich tapestry of feelings, raw emotions, personal revelations.  I cannot say enough about this movie.  I'm glad that it found a wider release, but it saddens me that it has brought out the shallow moviegoers and their stupid prejudices for more mainstream fare.  We need more ""Sidewys""'s, not more ""Hitch""'s.  But that takes an aesthetically-minded moviegoer, and those, it appears, are getting harder and harder to come by.  If you didn't feel all the pain and regret and melancholy in Paul Giamatti's face when he drops Haden Church off at his in-laws-to-be at the end, then you missed the whole point of the movie.  I guess there's a positve in all this:  ""Sideways"" separates the universe into those who care about film -- and other mediums -- as art, and those who are just too stupid to want anything better in their lives.",1112745600,3,2470,4.653579676674365

joys lie primarily in subtleties and microcosms, and how

""little things"" in ""little lives"" can speak volumes. Ordinary

people, struggling through classic imperfections and embarrasing

blemishes, striving for growth and better things. The acting is

simply remarkable. This movie would have failed with a lesser

cast. Particularly affecting are Paul Giamatti and Virginia

Madsen. They create pageantries of poetic and poignant

exchanges, fleshing every ember from a moment. Lest you get

the wrong idea, healthy restraint is exercised, to keep the

film from wallowing in overwrought emotion. If you're looking

for a lot of ""eye candy"", this movie is not for you. There are

several intense scenes to feed you, both comical and meaningful,

but not by way of special effects. There are moments that are

wild and unlikely, but always believable, always coming off as

real. You get a little bit of almost everything in this film.

2004 was a lean year for movies, but this one is a gem. Think of

Sideways as comparable to Woody Allen at his best. Better yet,

It's so funny:  the five star reviews are, by and large, eloquent, insightful, etc.  The one- and two-star reviews seem to have been written by mostly cretins.  One reviewer wrote that the film was ""boring and contrite."" [sic]  Contrite, of course, means feeling remorse for something, not something banal.  It's that kind of illiteracy and outright stupidity -- that is not a typo -- that makes me realize that ""Sideways"" was probably always a small film meant for a discerning, aesthetically-cultured audience.  Because it won so many awards and went into mass release, it found itself in the red states where the numbskulls live:  the squirrel-eating backwood's hillbillies.  If ""Sideways"" had only made ten million instead of over 100, these self-proclaimed critics would never have weighed in with their dunderheaded nonsense.  Oh, well.

2240510,1,B0007RUSGW,"Well, here goes my review, and you probably won't like it. First of all, this movie is being pitched as a tour through wine country. Amazing how they visit about 4 wineries (the first they visit, Sanford, has produced some of the worst wines I have ever tasted. Ok, so the real story is about an ugly actor (soon to be married) trying to get laid on his vacation. And the other even uglier guy has such self esteem issues he almost cant get laid. So they go to restaurants, a couple wineries, stay at the same hotel the entire time they're there (so they couldn't have had the time to travel to different AVA's). Not a drama, not a comedy, not horror or sci-fi. Not a documentary. Not a romance, not an action movie. I guess to sum things up this movie sucks as much as his book which cant get published because it goes nowhere, just like this movie.

2240513,5,B0007RUSGW,"I really enjoyed this movie, even more the second time I saw it.  The first time, in the theater, I had the impression that it was a good movie, but not a great one.  After thinking about it, and talking with other people about it, I've upgraded my opinion.  It's still not a GREAT film, but it certainly is an excellent story.  There aren't a lot of middle-age coming-of-age movies that pull it off as well as this one.  There also aren't a lot of two person (technically) films that can hold your interest.  These two just hae such a rapport together that you find yourself drawn in to whatever they're talking about.  They really do sound like old friends.  I haven't seen such natural dialog since the older Woody Allen films.

Add the availability of some excellently themed jazz as a soundtrack and that makes this a 5 star movie for me.  I even bought the soundtrack as a ""reading album"" (something for background while reading) and I have to say it's currently my favorite album.  I even listen to it in the car, as it makes a wonderful driving soundtrack.

My favorite aspect of this movie is getting to watch it with people who have never seen it, so I can remember what it was like for me to see some of my favorite scenes for the first time.  It helps that I myself am a lot like Paul's character, and I have a friend very much like Thomas's character (albeit not quite as manipulative).

It's also a very good wine movie.  The wine involved in the movie becomes symbolism for the two characters themselves, and how they live their lives.  It's a shame that merlot sales have been hurt due to this movie (according to a friend of mine) because merlot is an excellent way to introduce a person to wine.  Pinot Noir's good and all, but it's not for everybody.  I must confess that I did pick up more than my share of bottles after watching the movie, because Paul G. does such a great job of describing the details of Pinot.

The commentary track is absolutely wonderful to listen to.  The two main actors, Paul and Thomas, work just as well off camera as on.  Some of the play between the two is just hysterical.  I listened to it last night, and was laughing out loud at many of the things they said and described.  The deleted scenes are also great, with ""stills"" describing the scene, and then a little portion before and after of the original movie, so you can place the scene.  I didn't watch all of them (as I was eager to listen to the commentary track) but I will eventually.

Rent it if you like, but after you've been thinking about it, you'll be wanting to see it again and own a copy to bring out or over to parties to watch with folks who have never seen it.",1112659200,4,2682,4.337349397590361
2240514,5,B0007RUSGW,"well, after many, many weeks of trying to get tons of people to see this gem of a film on the big screen where it should have been seen, it is finally now on home video for your viewing pleasure.  since around early last spring, there had been talk about this little film that had nothing to do with space aliens, gore, dumb teens, dumb adults, and no big name movie stars.  please, do not get me wrong.  i have loved watching movies for a very long time since i was a young shorty, and have seen a lot more than most people would expect.  but after working a 10 screen cineplex from 1996 to mid-2002( i've been working at target since then, thank you) i came to the conclusion that not every damn blockbuster that hollywood crams down my throat is worthy of spending major money on.  since then, and during my time working for cinemark theaters,  i decided to spend good money on small, low budget, independent features that don't succumb to traditional hollywood values.  'sideways' is one of those features that i speak about.  this film is about a lonely book writer teaching eighth grade english while wating to see if his newest creation gets the big break he hopes it deserves.  paul giamatti plays that character, miles, a hopeless man determined to drink his life away in bottles of pinot noir(his wine type of choice) and spending long nights in bars wallowing away.  his best friend (thomas haden church)is getting married in one week, so miles takes him on a week long journey into wine country to have one last blast before the wedding takes place.  thomas church's character has nothing in mind, but to screw every walikng female in sight.  along the way, both guys meet a couple of ladies in their journey.  miles meets up with maya, a waitress played by chicagoan virginia madsen who sees the inner beauty in paul giamatti's character, and reveals a few revelations of her own.  mr. church meets up with a wine pourer, played by sandra oh, who brings more to the table than thomas ever bargained for.  after this set up, it would be unwise for me to tell you anything else about this absolutely amazing film, except for the actors. all 4 major actors shine in their respective portrayals is this film.  paul giamatti was sorely overlooked for an oscar nomination for best actor, as he shows his role as miles as an up and majorly down guy who just can't get over that one last hump.  thomas haden church was wisely given an oscar nod for supporting actor, as was ms. madsen, for best supporting actress.  and though sandra oh did not reap any major awards this past season, she still is a major force to be reckoned with.  the film shines with superb dialouge written by alexander payne and jim taylor, who both won this years oscar for best screenplay.  and even though i shouldn't be warning anybody about this, this is a mature, thought provoking R-rated movie with much adult conversations, including the dreaded(and very much used)f-word.  hey, it's said for a lot of good reasons and this is the type of movie it should be said in.  but don't let that stop you from seeing this gem of a film, for i will be buying this movie tomorrow when i go to work.  oh, and by the way, my honest feeling about this film?  after leaving the theater back in november when i first saw it, i knew that i had just saw the best film of 2004, hands down.  and it still is a masterpiece of new millenuim filmmaking in my opinion.",1112659200,2,3431,4.486312399355878
2240515,2,B0007RUSGW,"A sad movie about some very sad people.  I cannot understand what all of the mainstream critics found so appealing in this movie.  If I wanted to be depressed, I'd hang around clinically depressed people more often and not seek them out at the movies where I go to be entertained.

Thomas Hayden Church's character Jack was a foul-mouthed, libidinous, amoral friend of the somewhat less foul-mouthed, sad sack ""anti-hero"" Miles, played by Paul Giamotti.  I guess that some guys have one of those friends like Jack who continually goof up their friend's lives and maybe Miles hangs around him because he's just so gosh-darn fun to be around when he's ruining his possessions and begging him to join him on his juvenile sexual excursions.  Maybe, but fortunately I don't know anyone like that and I resent the implication that men behave this way when we're hanging around our buddies.

While the plot moved along nicely, I found that I didn't like these characters, nor care what happened to them after 45 minutes.  Also, I could not get over the liberal use of the ""f"" word.  Was it really necessary to include that in every other scene?  I don't speak that way, my friends and coworkers don't speak that way, and it gets old after a few minutes to hear these allegedly educated male and female characters swear and curse as though they were high school boys.

The one bit of praise that I have for ""Sideways"" was the dialogue (minus the ""f"" word).  It sounded as though it was natural conversation and Virginia Madsen was particularly good.  I chuckled a few times during the movie, but for the life of me I cannot remember them now.

As an aside, what was the deal with Stephanie's place?  Do most people live in ramshackle hovels or am I just being picky?

Finally, maybe I'm just too un-hip to get it, but to what did ""Sideways"" refer?  Was it some sort of wine reference?  I really didn't care by the end of the movie.  All in all, this movie was a waste of my time and money, even though I saw it at the $1.00 theater.",1112572800,8,2024,4.513736263736264

2240529,5,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways is truly a gem in an era where moviemakers are obsessed with period pieces, blockbusters, and gimmicky dramas.  It boasts realistic characters with real problems, and touches on the nature and meaning of friendship, romance, betrayal, etc.  The movie relies on the stunning beauty of southern California's wine region and the natural but undeniable appeal of its four leads, not computer generated effects and flavor-of-the-day ""stars"".  The result is a deeply touching but hilarious masterpiece.

The cast is perfect.  Paul Giamatti has mastered the frumpy, angry white male but injects so much pathos and irony that he's always fun to watch.  Virginia Madsen reinvents herself as a quiet, thoughtful siren (although at 42 she can hardly be considered ""mature"", as described by many critics).  Sandra Oh is effective with the few lines she has, but it is wonderful to see an Asian actor portray a character who could be of any ethnicity, white, black, or whatever!  I loved the fact that there was no explanation about why she and her mother and daughter were not the same race!  The true revelation here is Thomas Haden Church.  Not sure if he really is a dumb, has-been TV star or if simply nailed the portrayal - regardless, this was THE star making performance of the year.

Some may think the movie moves along too slowly, but I say enjoy it and its wonderful pace.  It's a quiet film that will stay with you a lot longer than the blockbusters.

One note about the DVD cover: ""The best comedy of the year""... says ACCESS HOLLYWOOD?  Out of the hundreds of Best Picture accolades they prominently feature the endorsement of a vacuous tabloid?  Sigh.",1112486400,6,1663,4.868327402135232
2240530,5,B0007RUSGW,"Despite being hesitant about watching this (the director was behind the overrated About Schmidt) i came out of the theater reasonably happy that i did.

While ""Sideways"" is actually a film that blends many familiar themes in its plot it manages to introduce them achieving an atmosphere that makes it a very warm and ultimately very human film. These themes include a traditional loser type who cant get over his collapsed marriage (Giammati) and who has become self-loathing and bitter about it as well as about his soon NOT to be published book, and his friend who fully exploits him for a few sexual adventures before he himself gets married as they both embark in a weekly trip culminating to the wedding.

  Now, if you feel that the storyline might be one of those pseudo-intellectual comedies rest assured that it isn't.

  Sideways is genuingly funny in a manner that we all know real life can be. It's also equally tragic mostly because the loser of the story is a terrifically convincing character, one of those people that actually proclaim themselves losers even though they possess wonderful qualities that they themselves do not realise. This character is given a great performance by Giammati, one that should easily be considered for Oscar material even if the film doesnt have the otherwise flashy credentials recquired for such a consideration.

The world of ""Sideways"" evolves around this loser and his efforts to somehow fit in despite his defeats. His closest friend isn't too interested in saving him and couldn't even if he intended to. Not only that but he leads him from one hilarious disaster onto another. Hilarious yes, farsical even, but still very believable. The scriptwriter obviously managed to achieve a very fine balance here, without which we'd have another fine idea messed up on celluloid.

I's definetely not a situational comedy as most of the charm of the film is based on some seriously self-sarcastic and poignant dialogue and this counts as an extra asset to it.

One of the bigger surprises in films this year, ""Sideways"" shouldnt be ignored by anyone who looks for a comedy which isn't really a comedy or for a drama which isn't that either, but something in between which will have you laughing and thinking at the same time..",1112313600,5,2273,4.911227154046998
2240531,5,B0007RUSGW,"This flick was a blast, funny, well written, well acted and while certainly a stylized realism (a bit over the top here and there) it showed human emotion and behavior in such a shocking way that it couldn't help but be a good movie.  I'd say this was one step beyond being a chick flick, it was too raw and not fluffy enough to qualify, which in some ways, many ways actually, made it a better piece of art.

As art imitates life and life art, the other day while I was picking up wine on my way to a dinner party I called the host to verify I was getting the right bottle for dinner and she says ""you know not to get merlot, right?""  I'd told her early in the day that I'd seen the movie.

2240535,4,B0007RUSGW,"Sideways is an entertaining but vastly overrated film about the pleasures of life and wine. A first-rate cast deliver good, but not extraordinary performances in this tale about two men reaching middle age with not much to show but disappointment, who embark on a week long road trip through California's wine country, just as one is about to take a trip down the altar.

If anyone in this film deserved an Oscar nomination it was Paul Giamatti, a terrific actor always overlooked by the Academy for his brilliant turns in independent cinema. He is constantly robbed of a nomination, and is once again shut out for this film. Sandra Oh was also robbed, the nomination instead going to Virginia Madsen, an actress I've admired since seeing Candyman, but whose performance I thought was nothing out of the ordinary. She wasn't the problem at all, it was more the fact that her role was very small and she didn't have scenes of pure emotion that Sandra Oh's character had. All the actors were good,if not special, but the wrong actors were nominated.

The screenplay, written by director Alexander Payne (Sandra Oh's husband) and Jim Taylor, from the novel by Rex Pickett, is a twist on the conventional romantic comedy. One of its most wonderful qualities is that all four characters are necessary. The women are not plot conveniences, but elements in a complex romantic and even therapeutic process. It is these characters that make the movie so likeable, and different from other romantic comedies.

I liked this movie, but wasn't impressed by it. Yes, I was entertained, but didn't leave the theatre a changed man that movies like Million Dollar Baby made me feel. Perhaps I have to see it again to truly appreciate it, but I just feel this was a really good film for the romantic comedy genre and nothing more. I recommend it yes, but beware, it is one of the most overrated films of the year, if not ever. Wine lovers might especially enjoy the dialogue, especially a scene between Giamanti and Madsen, who is the one scene I think got her the nomination.

8051083,4,B0007RUSGW,"First of all, I'm not a wine drinker, so a lot of the terminology kinda went over my head. And the film seemed to have a lot of bright light in it. Maybe that's because things tend to shine when you have too much wine. And some of the jokes were like the kind that pop up in Woody Allen movies. You know, the ones that go over the heads of 90 percent of the audience, while the other 10 percent know who Bukowski is and have read Confederacy of Dunces. Plus the music was more than a bit bland.
  Having said that, all of the principles were terrific. Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh give performances that will always rank very high on their resumes. Very smartly written, and very deftly directed by Alexander Payne. This movie is a gem. A flawed gem, but one that still shines brightly. And it really made me laugh.
  Now it's conspiracy theory time! As I watched this movie for the second time, I could not but help notice several stylistic and referential touches that tend to call up my personal favorite movie of all time. And that film is..............The Shining!!! Hear me out: Did you notice that the segments dividing the film into different days -MONDAY- or-THURSDAY- are just like in The Shining? Plus Sideways deals with a schoolteacher who is an unsuccessful writer on the side, along with a drinking problem and issues with women. He's friends with someone named Jack. You see a car winding along a road. The motel room Miles and Jack stay in is number 234, just three numbers away to the left is.......237! There is a reference early on to a Wendy and twins. A guy talks to a bartender. Several scenes have characters looking into or reflected in mirrors. Plus, you could say that Miles and Jack both finally have a chance to accomplish something, and are really into their ""work"". And an ambiguous ending to boot. Maybe this is really reading way too much into this flick, but perhaps Alexander Payne was telling an alternate version of The Shining, one far less Kubrickian. Or maybe he just digs that movie. Or maybe it's all one big massive coincidence. Or maybe.......
  Anyhoo, this movie can still be enjoyed as a funny, smartly made road trip comedy without the aforementioned ""overlooked"" subtext. But perhaps, perhaps, this film is the skeleton key, if you will, to open up all the secrets of Kubrick's 1980 masterpiece of horror. Take a closer look for yourself.
