8252767,3,B0013TFP66,"This DVD is EXACTLY the same as the ""SMS"" you see here in the states showing just the big jacket with Byrnes hands in the pockets on the front cover.

This video was slightly grainy... I suspect it may be a dubbed copy?

Also, the label on the CD didn't look authentic.

The ONLY thing that sets this video apart from the one you see in the states is the photos on the jacket. Photos that were more than likely lifted from various photos on the internet because they were photos showing different eras of the TH's. None had anything to do with SMS.

There are also like six words written in Korean on the jacket.

So, if you seek a grainy TV picture, poor quality photos on the jacket and six Korean words... This is the DVD for you. If that really doesn't sway you, pick up the original.",1266105600,15,788,4.226666666666667
