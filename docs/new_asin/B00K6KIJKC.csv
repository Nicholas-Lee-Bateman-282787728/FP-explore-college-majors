6403818,4,B00K6KIJKC,"So this is the movie that taught me that to stymie a witch you must put her in a barrel. And that's good to know. 1967's More Than A Miracle (released in Italy as ""C'era una volta"") was well-received domestically but failed to find an audience internationally. And while I enjoyed watching it, I could see where viewers may be left scratching their heads. Set in 17th century Italy, More Than A Miracle is a somewhat bizarre, somewhat surreal, absolutely fractured Neapolitan fairy tale. It's strong on whimsy and farce, and for sure a peculiar imagination was in play behind the scenes.

I knew Sophia Loren was, like, va-va-boom. But I wasn't aware that Omar Sharif, back in the day, was actually a good-looking dude. Sharif plays Rodrigo, an arrogant Spanish prince who prefers taming wild horses to settling down to a dull marriage. Except that seven beautiful princesses have come to the castle, and Rodrigo is being pushed to pick one for a wife. In a tiff, Rodrigo storms out on his unruly stallion and, out in the countryside, is thrown off his saddle. He wanders into a monastery and chances upon a flying monk who informs him ""The woman you love will have an impossible character - just like yours."" Rodrigo protests that he doesn't want to marry and that he does what he wants, all the time. In lieu of useful advice on matrimony, the monk gives the prince a sack of flour and instructs him to have someone bake him seven dumplings when he gets hungry. The monk challenges Rodrigo to eat all seven dumplings, a challenge Rodrigo sneers at. Still, you can feel the fairy tale mechanics being set into motion.

Some time later, the prince espies his horse in the care of Isabella (Loren), a spirited peasant girl picking turnips in the fields. And even though instant rancor develops between the two, Rodrigo demands that the girl cook him seven dumplings. Except that, later, the starving Isabella hands him a plate with only six dumplings on it. Somewhere, the flying monk is smugly going ""Aha!""

And some more stuff happens.

It's a cheerful fable, despite the underpinnings concerning class-consciousness. There's a bawdiness threading thru, thanks to the earthy sensuality Sophia Loren brings to the table. Your eyes feast on cinematography that captures the spectacle of this period fantasy. The film was shot in the countryside near Naples, and these rolling landscapes lend a timeless feel and almost convince me to consult my travel agent. But make no mistake, Sophia Loren, dialing up the sultry, is the film's most sensational visual element. She's such a classical beauty and, as always, she's in dire need of more buttons to retain her modesty in those uber-tight blouses. I love her wilfulness and her fire as Isabella, who doesn't hesitate to trade barbs with the roaring prince. Omar Sharif turns in a magnetic performance, although I'm still not sure I actually like his bullying role. But it's fun watching him rage and barnstorm his way thru the film.

There's a whiff of Cinderella, but only a whiff. I guess they could've called it Cinderella, Italian Style, only that smacks vaguely of pornographic connotations. Mostly, More than A Miracle steers its own course. What undermines it is the blithe unconcern that seems to dictate the meandering plot. There's a disjointedness, a lack of focus, that maybe a tighter script could've remedied. If you're in the mood for a leisurely fairy tale romp, then you should absolutely hit this up. For me, it's 3.5 out of 5 stars. There are things to like about the film, not the least being that heat between the two leads. Where else can you take in fanciful sights of flying monks and benevolent (but creepy) old witches and prophecies concerning apple dumplings and a rambunctious dishwashing tournament contended by the seven princesses (and a disguised Isabella)? This contest is to determine who gets to marry the prince. And, yes, Sophia Loren makes washing dishes a very sexy activity indeed. And for those sick puppies out there (raise your hands), there's always that notorious urine as panacea scene at the nunnery.",1409184000,2,4095,4.877873563218391
6403819,5,B00K6KIJKC,wonderful movie - glad to see it again,1407628800,,38,3.875
6403820,3,B00K6KIJKC,"This film tells the pleasant, sort of Cinderella-esque tale of Sophia Loren's character Isabella, a poor peasant girl of Southern Italy who uses charm and wit, plus the aid of witches and saints to soften and eventually win the heart and hand of Omar Sharif's mean Prince Rodrigo.  The story is pretty formulaic, but the glorious Sophia Loren's presence definitely kicks it up a notch.  Unfortunately, the film is painfully marred by the awful dubbing which was so common in Italian made films during that time.  And, the story is somewhat disjointed and confusing - and there is quite a bit of chauvinism on display - perhaps not uncommon for the time, but still difficult to watch.  For instance, toward the beginning, Prince Rodrigo appears to be smitten by Isabella who effects only contempt for him, still, he urges her to prepare dumplings for him, and when she presents him only 6 of the desired 7, he feigns death and even allows her neighbors to bury him alive as though his heart is broken at her refusal.  Next, though she apparently went to bed quite fitfully after leaving him buried alive, she is visited by a witch and suddenly she's in love with Rodrigo.  But, now, strangely Rodrigo who apparently dug himself out, is suddenly contemptuous of her, and though she tells him she loves him, he has her put in a barrel.  I still don't understand the instantaneous shifting of emotions between the characters in those two scenes.  The rest of the film follows a bit more smoothly and has some charm, despite some awkward twists and a further display of contempt and misogyny (when Rodrigo forces her to complete for him with 7 other women by washing dishes - when she loses the dish washing contest Rodrigo smacks Isabella - even though in the prior scene he had expressed deep passion for her), but again, the disastrous dubbing is hard to get around.  Still, Sophia Loren sparkles and Omar Sharif and Dolores del Rio add intensity.",1404864000,8,1945,4.730769230769231
6403821,2,B00K6KIJKC,"Okay -- I'm in advertising, so I dislike false advertising. When I bought this product, I thought that I was buying the film with Omar Sharif and Sophia Loren. The description of the product was so scanty, I didn't know that I was buying a religious film about the miracles of Christ. I felt that the seller was purposely being deceptive. I sent the video back. All my money was returned, but who wants to go through the hassle? Hopefully, the seller is now plainly describing what this video is about. Nothing wrong with a film about the miracles of Christ, but be honest about what you're selling! At the time that I purchased this video, there was no photo of the product either.

6403822,1,B00K6KIJKC,"The full description of this item is not given on Amazon. It is a 1/2 hour video of a guy talking about a few of Jesus' Miracles in brief. The Christian viewer with adequate scriptural scholarship already knows these stuff. For the non-Christian, not having read the accounts of miracles in the Gospels, the presentation makes no sense. The bottom line of this video is that the miracle behind the miracles is that Jesus didn't make a big deal of himself but glorified the Father.

If the video was free I would have kept it, but for almost $10.00 I am sending it back. I rather buy a good book about Jesus or the videos of the Gospel of John, or Luke.",1323475200,,652,4.344262295081967

It still bewilders me  why it took so long, but finally my quest to own this wonderful film has been realized. I don't care if the story is inconsistent, implausible or the dubbing poor. That's not why people love this picture, it was never intended to stand up to academy award level scrutiny. It was and remains a treasured fantasy, complete with delightfully humorous witches, enchanting musical score and Sophia Loren, who never looked more beautiful in  her life, playing the peasant girl and later a princess, wearing the most beautiful costume I've ever seen. Magical is the word I would use to describe this picture, and if this masterpiece doesn't touch your heart or stir your soul then you've lost the key to your imagination.

A lovely fantasy that tells a charming love story of a poor peasant girl and a Prince, all done with stunning photography, beautiful score and beautiful lead actors. Sophia Loren was at the zenith of her beauty in 1967 when she filmed this, and she is simply luminous, and wonderfully charming as the head strong but loving Isabella. Omar Sharif is also wonderful in his role as the persistent and arrogant prince Rodrigo who falls in love with her. The Romantic score, the lush and luminous photography, the engaging and compelling performances by the two leads, and supporting cast make this movie a gem and a must for any fantasy loving enthusiast. If you are a Sophia Loren fan, this is truly a fan favorite, and a must, she is at the top of her game here in talent and beauty.

6403866,3,B00K6KIJKC,"""More than a Miracle"" (1967) is a fairy tale set in the 17th century Italian countryside in which a young Spanish prince (Omar Sharif) has a fortuitous encounter with a beautiful, young peasant woman (Sophia Loren).  The film boasts some very handsome leads, scenic views (filmed near Naples, Italy), and two genuinely touching musical themes (the title song and the love theme) by Piero Piccioni, but these songs are reused a few times too often throughout the film (instead of new music or creative rearrangements of the themes).  To make matters worse, Roger Williams' English language version of the love theme (a Billboard #2 hit in 1967) was inserted in the film's finale (the original Italian film had the instrumental soundtrack music during this scene), and the sound editing from this song back to the original score is all too evident.  Indeed, one of the film's worst qualities is in the editing (by Jolanda Benvenuto):  otherwise beautiful scenes transition from one to another quite clumsily.

The film's Catholic mythology (and witchcraft) is bizarre and unbiblical, and there is no mention of Jesus Christ, only ""God"" and ""Madonna.""  But considering the source and setting, it is not surprising.

Interestingly, Loren's illiterate Isabella character and Georges Wilson's bloated, eccentric palace chef character are direct antecedents to Raquel Welch's Constance and Spike Milligan's M. Bonacieux in ""The Three Musketeers"" (1973).  Both films take place in the 1600s as well.  It would seem that ""Musketeers"" director Richard Lester must have been inspired by certain aspects of this film.

In the end ""More Than a Miracle"" is entertaining nonetheless, but a footnote to the two leading actors' careers, not a touchstone by any stretch.  Dolores del Rio portrays Sharif's mother in one of her final film roles.",1416787200,2,1826,5.219178082191781
