397686,5,6301975979,We have been patiently waiting since 1992 for this movie to be put out on DVD. Its Time NOW MGM!!!,1185840000,2,98,3.95
397687,4,6301975979,"MGM turns out a middling production with Thousands Cheer. This film has the weakest plot I've seen in years. In fact, the plot is so thin that it becomes difficult for me to write anything cogent about it. Gene Kelly plays Eddie Marsh, an army private during WW2 who falls in love with a Colonel's daughter named Kathryn, played very ably by Kathryn Grayson. Mary Astor plays Kathryn's mother; and John Boles plays Colonel Bill Jones, Kathryn's father; but Kathryn's parents have long since separated. Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson get a chance to show off their acting skills but all this still remains mostly wasted on this flimsy plot. Just as Eddie and Kathryn have barriers to their relationship caused by the war, Kathryn's parents also have boundaries and problems in their own relationship because of Bill's devotion to the armed forces. Questions pop out at you: What becomes of Kathryn's parents--will they reunite after years of living separate lives? Will Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson's characters stay in love despite bumpy times on the base? You'll have to watch to find out; I hate putting spoilers in my reviews. SMILE

You may ask: If Matt doesn't say much good about this movie, then why does he give it four stars? The answer is easy: you get a good show out of Thousands Cheer with song and dance numbers that save the film from ruination. For example, the dance scene with Gene Kelly using a rag mop for his partner proves that even when his career was just starting he was a very polished, naturally talented dancer with extraordinary abilities. The circus scene in the first half of the picture offers great acrobatics and the choreography of the circus scenes astounds me. Finally, the last half of the movie offers several remarkably wonderful performances by some of the greatest of the MGM greats. Eleanor Powell still tap dances with the very best of them; Judy Garland sings ""The Joint Is Really Jumpin' Down At Carnegie Hall"" as beautifully as ever with Jos Iturbi at the piano; and Lena Horne's elegant performance of ""Honeysuckle Rose"" will charm even the hardest of hearts.

In addition, look for some fairly enjoyable comedy sketches with Frank Morgan, the actor who played The Wizard Of Oz five years earlier, Ann Southern, Lucille Ball, Margaret O'Brien, Red Skelton and Virginia O'Brien. Kay Kyser also turns in a great performance with his band.

The color is fairly good for VHS but it isn't the same quality you might get on a DVD; however the cinematography reflects forethought that works especially well in the last half of the movie when most of the musical numbers take place.

If you want a movie with a deep and meaningful plot, you will need to keep looking. However, fans of the MGM musical will enjoy this movie; and these fans will enjoy the movie even more if they skip the first hour and simply fast forward to get to the part where ""the show"" begins. Thousands Cheer also deserves ""honorable mention"" as a look at how young people felt when they found themselves in unexpected situations that came about as a result of WW2.",1173398400,17,3080,4.762172284644195

(At the time bigger than Benny Goodman, Glen Miller, Or Tommy Dorsey.)
Filled with great period jive and swing numbers, Thousands Cheer capsules everything dear to a 40's teenager.  On the brink of World War II this movie was a morale-lifter for our boys.

Getting  to the end, however, is tedious.  The wartime romance angle is routine,  spiced up only by some probably unintended Oedipal tension between the girl  (Kathryn Grayson) and her father.

Unfortunately, it is not.

The film is dull and plodding through most of the first hour, despite some nice classical musical numbers by Iturbi and Grayson, and really doesn't pick up the pace until Kelly's mop dance number, at about 1:06 into the picture.  When the all-star show for the troops, hosted by Mickey Rooney, begins, things get a lot better, particularly Eleanor Powell's solo tap number, her first filmed in color.

If the folks at MGM had spent a little more time in the editing room, they could have made a really outstanding film of about 1 1/2 hours or less.

397810,3,6301975979,"Thousands Cheer (1943) starring Gene Kelly is all actor and movie tech quality, but lacking good writing and good songs.

Thousands Cheer (1943) starring Gene Kelly was made using the very best of MGM's actor and movie technician talent in color, and is well done in those areas.

I never saw Kelly do such a good job acting, and the same is true for his co-star, Katherine Grayson. Other major actors part of the movie all do well, including Mary Astor, Mickey Rooney, and Judy Garland.

It's a spectacular movie technically, and quite a showcase for good actor movie star work done well and skillfully, a credit to all who appear in front of the camera and worked on the machines behind the screen.

But there is no script worth the name, and not a single good song appears in this movie, which is supposed to be (and is) a ""musical."" Judy Garland does her best at the end of the movie with a mediocre song, even though she's always worth seeing. One of the true saints of world cinema history.

The movie is an embarrassment of riches except for the bad (non-existent) script and the lack of a single good, memorable song.

And this from the then biggest and richest movie studio in the world, MGM.

It's an oddity worth seeing for its display of talent, unconnected as that turns out to be with good writing and good song composition.

The color especially is dazzling. It's an upbeat ""crowd-pleaser"" movie needed and delivered during the World War II years. But the lack of good writing and good songs makes it mediocre.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

I was fortunate to see this film on the big screen at Lincoln Center and I recommend you do the same if you're able to. Made during World War II, it's a rousing tribute to the armed forces, and it still entertains to this day. The film is really divided into two distinct parts. The first is the romance between Private Eddie Marsh (Gene Kelly) and Kathryn (played by Kathryn Grayson), who is the daughter of Eddie's commanding officer. The second is a musical revue performed in front of the troops, featuring all the big MGM musical and comedy stars of the day.

Marsh comes from a family of aerialists, the Flying Corbinos. One of the many highlights in the film are the great circus shots featuring the 'Corbinos' as they perform death defying flying trapeze stunts. I suspect that the 'Corbinos' were a group created just for the movie since I can't find any reference to them outside of their association with the film itself.

While the overall plot is a bit hokey, it's unusual for its day, in that Grayson's character, 'Kathryn', is a product of divorced parents. When she hooks up with her Dad, Colonel Bill Jones (expertly played by John Boles), she's seeing him for the first time after living with her mother for many years. The film's subplot, involves Kathryn attempting to bring her estranged parents back together and at film's end, it looks like she's succeeded.

As for the romance between Eddie and Kathryn, it's pretty standard stuff. Kathryn is attracted to Eddie because he's the only soldier who doesn't fawn over her. He's too busy wrapped up with a chip on his shoulder, bemoaning the fact that the Army doesn't use his talents as an aerialist and believes he'd be better off in the Air Force. After Kathryn makes it clear that Eddie's the one for her, he sneaks into the Colonel's home so he can be with his beloved and ends up being called to the Colonel's office for a dressing down. Instead of ending up in the brig, the Colonel lets him off with a slap on the wrist (extra chores)--after the two switch roles, with Eddie pretending he's the Colonel and the Colonel adopting the role of the beleaguered private. Eventually Eddie must learn a lesson about being a good team player (after leaving his post) and this time really ends up in the brig (something must have been lost on the cutting room floor, since Eddie's transgression, when he leaves his post, is only depicted in its aftermath--we never see where he goes after he disappears).

If the rather tame plot doesn't hook you in, there's more than enough entertainment provided featuring the fantastic coloratura soprano voice of Kathryn Grayson and Gene Kelly's phenomenal dancing (his bit with the broom is classic Gene Kelly!). There's also the added bonus of the film debut of film conductor/pianist, Jos Iturbi, who does some sensational piano playing and conducting. Watch when he accompanies Judy Garland in the second half, breaking into some boogie woogie after she exhorts him to get into the 'groove'.

The Eddie-Kathryn story is interrupted in the film's second half with the introduction of MGM's cavalcade of stars. I got a real kick out of seeing how young some of the stars looked back then including Mickey Rooney, Red Skelton and Lucille Ball. Rooney is the master of ceremonies introducing all the acts and does some neat impersonations himself of a very amusing interaction between Clark Gable and Lionel Barrymore. Some of the performers, who were extremely big in their day, are now forgotten to a modern audience. We get a fascinating glimpse of two in particular: Kay Kyser and his Orchestra, the 'funnyman' band leader and Virginia O'Brien, known to 1940s audiences for her deadpan expression while singing various big band hits of the day.

Of the stars I was familiar with, of course Judy Garland steals the show with her numbers with Iturbi. And then there's Red Skelton who I used to watch as a kid on TV. He's enjoyably goofy doing one of his slapstick routines. Also of note is Frank Morgan (The Wizard of Oz) who plays a lecherous physician, 'examining' various starlets who come by to see him in his physician's office (one of those starlets is a very young Lucille Ball). Eleanor Powell is also particularly impressive doing a tap routine and the very cute child actress, Margaret O'Brien, shows up, who was almost as popular in the 1940s as Shirley Temple was back in the 30s. Also look for a pre-'It's a Wonderful Life' Donna Reed in a short cameo. Finally, I was heartened to see some black performers featured in the film despite the fact that the armed forces were segregated during World War II. Lena Horne's rendition of 'Honeysuckle Rose' is thrilling along with accompaniment by extremely accomplished black big band performers.

'Thousands Cheer' wraps up with Grayson leading the United Nations Chorus singing a song called 'United Nations', a powerful (but not very tuneful) piece, predating the establishment of the United Nations itself in 1945.

'Thousands Cheer' served its purpose of cheering up the troops and the general public during World War II. While the basic plot can be described as 'fluff', the level of talent here is unprecedented and you will not only find it very highly entertaining but a fascinating glimpse at a bygone era.",1342915200,,5345,4.8

397814,4,6301975979,"The revue As Thousands Cheer was a huge 1933 Broadway success (more than a year playing, by Irving Berlin, sketches by Moss Hart, starring Clifton Webb, Ethel Waters and Marilyn Miller. MGM had acquired the rights. So it could use the title but that movie has nothing to do with Berlin. It has only one musical number with Gene Kelly, miscast here as a brooding private, quite unpleasant.
The love story with a charming Kathryn Grayson begins as a joke by KG but is never convincing.
Written by Paul Gallico the novelist (with Richard Collins), the screenplay has all the bad habits of by the numbers MGM
big pictures. Except for KG, no character is interesting, except for the sergeant Frank Jenks. Ben Blue is irritating as the
picturesque private. If it were only for that, the movie would be boring but it's all about glorious Technicolor by George Folsey
and the director George Sidney a passionate shutterbug who had shown his visual flair in his third movie PILOT N 5.
We don't know if in 1942-43 Sidney could influence the MGM style, but one shot, Folsey or Sidney ,is striking: tha platoon getting back to camp, marching around a column.
Later on, Sidney would prove his mastery of cinematography with SCARAMOUCHE (remember the force of the first close up!), YOUNG BESS,
PAL JOEY, BYE BYE BIRDIE. Making VIVA LAS VEGAS the best Presley movie. He was one of the greatest Hollywood directors.
We still have to endure a trapeze act, to show why Kelly is brooding: as an aerialist ace he wanted to join the Air Corps!
Early on we had prestige music directed nicely by Jose Iturbi and La Traviata in a soulless rendition (prestige policy)
On the 1H15' mark we have at last he big revue in camp and it's worth the price of admission, or DVD:
a great sketch with Frank Morgan, Sothern,Hunt and a GORGEOUS LUCILLE BALL.. A very nice dance by Eleanor Powell, the wonderful Virginia O' Brien and THE sketch with Red Skelton and the genius: Margaret O' Brien.
At last a rousing song by Judy Garland (Iturbi at the piano): ""The Joint is Really Jumpin' at Carnegie Hall"" (Edens, Blane, Martin)
Garland is still an icon but her discography is very poor. If we are talking about pressure groups, I am waiting for an
IRENE fan club. Her costumes are always exciting. A matching dress and coat made my wife jump in her chair.
At the end, we have an awful song with a GIANT all male chorus (war and post war affairs are a male preserve):""United Nations on the March""(under marshal Stalin). Music by comrade Shostakovich (but the Soviet flag put at the very bottom of Allied flags, with a kind of unofficial Free French flag).
Kelly kisses Grayson under the eyes of her father and colonel: sleepy John Boles.
Like in the future Rio Grande, the wife Mary Astor, loking rather old in color, makes up with her colonel husband.
Not really a morale building movie. Less trapeze would have helped.
Again, great Technicolor.",1263859200,3,2907,4.657587548638133

397817,3,6301975979,"I saw THOUSANDS CHEER in Montevideo, Uruguay, back in 1953, when MGM was reprising most of Gene Kelly's musicals after his big success in AN AMERICAN IN PARIS and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. The same year I could see those two films and ANCHORS AWEIGH too, and I was only ten years old. I became a big fan of Gene Kelly and now, when I'm over sixty, I haven't change a bit. So, is very touching to watch THOUSANDS CHEER again (I've seen the others over fifty times each) and place the film in the year it was made, 1943, with all that war climax, the studios trying to entertain the troops (and ALL of them were making the same kind of picture: Warners, Fox, RKO, Universal, Paramount) with a big parade of all their major stars singing and dancing, in musical numbers or comedy sketches (like Frank Morgan, Red Skelton and  Mickey Rooney here) with Jose Iturbi directing the orchestra and making faces all the time. Gene Kelly has only one number (and a good one) and Kathryn Grayson sings a lot, but this Joe Pasternak production is very entertaining, colorful and well directed by George Sidney with his flying cameras. This film has something special that the years can't erase: an enormous and powerful description of an era, not only Hollywood in his golden years but the fabulous forties at their peak, with the charm, the rhythm (just listen the Kay Kyser and Bob Crosby orchestras), the songs and the dances that describes more than words a whole great american pastime. And we must not forget the personalities (not only Judy Garland, but Eleanor Powell, Lena Horne and all the others) that make THOUSANDS CHEER a real document of an era. Of course, the war was not that funny and amusing like it's shown here, but the film was made with the only commitment of cheering-up the spirits of the men overseas, where things weren't that funny.  It must be seen now with that historical background, and that's its principal attraction nowadays.",1255910400,3,1941,4.6395348837209305
