8604034,5,B00ECXJBME,"Very detailed description of the WW2 events with individual accounts of soldiers who were at the forefront of the action. It's a film you would want to watch with full concentration. However, there's a lot of graphic pictures of dead men with extreme details. Some of mutilated bodies, etc - viewer discretion is advised....
But if you are interested in history with good detailed account of how it happened, i recommend this",1432425600,,425,4.916666666666667
