8046308,3,B00079RC0K,"It's too bad, but I rented this film thinking it was narrated by Martin Sheen when it wasn't.  This is not the PBS version.  It is narrated by the film maker.  Not that he did a bad job, it was just not what I expected.  Good, somewhat quiet film.  Students might find it a little too quiet.  I'm curious to know if the PBS version is better in this regard.  I like the fact that it covers three different countries in one film.",1360540800,,428,4.0843373493975905
8046309,5,B00079RC0K,If you want to learn about Vietnam this is one video you need to watch. Bought this for a friend at work and I got to watch it once he was done. Very good information.,1337731200,,167,3.8
8046310,3,B00079RC0K,"I had previously viewed the version of this documentary that has Martin Sheen narrating, and I have to say I prefer that one. Martin Sheen's voice adds a drama to the video that Rick Ray doesn't really communicate. The documentary itself is very interesting, but potential buyers should note that the section on Cambodia is less than 20 minutes long, while the Burma section is around 40 minutes, with the rest being about Vietnam.",1274313600,,431,4.837837837837838
8046311,5,B00079RC0K,I thought this video presented all three countries quite well.  I was watching it for information on Burma so I was a little disappointed that the Burma segment wasn't longer but that's all right.  He did a great job showing us their cultures as well as their tough situations they've delt with or are dealing with today.  The only bad thing was occasionally Rick would make cheesy comments!  All in all..it's a entertaining and informative film.,1003708800,3,446,4.828947368421052
8046312,5,B00079RC0K,"As a retired Vietnam era military officer and current 8th grade social studies teacher, I found Rick Ray's documentary of Southeast Asia an absolute necessity for my classroom.  His evenhanded portrayal of the  former and present situation in Vietnam was remarkable.  His all too short  segment on Cambodia left me and my students wanting to know more.  The odd  situation in Myanmar (Burma) was treated with realism and sensitivity.  What a great introduction to this area of the world for 8th graders.  Honest and beautiful, mysterious but real.  This movie helped me achieve my  goal in the classroom...The students are now asking important questions  about these three countries.  Thank you.",948585600,6,695,5.218181818181818
