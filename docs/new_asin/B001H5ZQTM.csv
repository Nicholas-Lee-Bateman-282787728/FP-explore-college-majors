8308017,5,B001H5ZQTM,"Absolutely stunning film that kept me on the edge of my seat.  The director did a great job of showing the cold hard truth of immigration from both sides.  From heartbreaking interviews with immigrants who survived the brutal coyotes', (immigrant smugglers), starvation, rape and murder on their journey;  to ranchers under attack by heavily drug cartels; this film pulls no punches.  Seriously a must see movie if you want to truly understand all sides of the border issue.",1415750400,,474,5.038461538461538
8308018,5,B001H5ZQTM,We were part of the Minuteman group and it was scary how many came across the border then.  The groups now coming have arms and are alot more dangerous but nothing has been done by our goverenment.,1396051200,,197,4.324324324324325
8308019,5,B001H5ZQTM,"People of America wake up! I know the people who made this film and it was scary and dangerous every day. They risked their lives to show what the reality is for this country. They went into areas they were warned NOT TO GO INTO by OUR Government officials because it was too dangerous! It was appalling to hear that the people of the ""BORDER PATROL"" is a JOKE...they are told by OUR GOVERNMENT to ""LET SOME ILLEGALS IN"" so it will look good that we are doing our job"" so that the records will show that not nearly as many illegals are getting in if they are NOT REPORTED!!!!! REALLY!! Wow...so all those stats and BS you hear about the borders are working and LESS PEOPLE are being arrested or sent back BBBSSSSSS!!! THE GOVT WILL NOT LET THE BORDER OFFICERS DO THEIR JOB BECAUSE IT WILL LOOK BAD!!! Know that OUR own govt is putting us at risk....ARIZONA KNOWS THIS! NO ONE Wants to hear about it....so disgusting. People like Chris Burgard should be praied and acknowledged for the risks he and the other crew members took to help educate us to the reality of our borders!",1284595200,3,1075,4.407035175879397
8308020,5,B001H5ZQTM,"This emotionally charged documentary does a tremendous job of showing all sides of the Border Security issue.

""You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free"".",1241222400,3,172,4.931034482758621
8308021,5,B001H5ZQTM,"This movie is a fantastic look at the border situation.  Interviews are intermixed with documentary footage and statistics.  Both sides of the issue are interviewed but it leans toward the strong border side of the issue.  The details are great and the statistics and footage are stark and disturbing in their simiplicity.  This is a great, thought-provoking movie.  I'll be using it in my college classroom.",1232323200,18,408,5.121212121212121
8308022,5,B001H5ZQTM,"If you think illegal aliens aren't hurting anyone and are just doing the ""jobs Americans won't do"", then ""Border"" is a documentary that you NEED to see.  As the Romans did before us, we are losing our national identity as our government and elected officials continue to see massive legal/illegal immigration as ""no big deal"".  Watch and learn!  Then, for the sake of your children and mine - ACT!",1229472000,17,397,4.72463768115942
8308023,1,B001H5ZQTM,"This film was the most disgusting piece of crap I have ever wasted my time watching.

For the xenophobes, nativists and white supremcists, this DVD will be awesome.

This movie is full of half truths, exaggerations and obvious lies filmed through the myopic vision of it's director.

I am surprised that Amazon would allow this trash to be featured on their website.",1229385600,9,366,4.870967741935484
8308024,5,B001H5ZQTM,"Chris Burgard uncovers the shocking violence of drug and human trafficking from Mexico that is terrorizing our border states.  The mainstream media and the U.S. Government has covered up these truths for too long. Horrifying at times but always entertaining, the viewer is left with a sense that this country is under attack and that we all must get involved to restore our time-honored tradition of LEGAL immigration, before another life is lost in the name of cheap labor from a third world country.",1228608000,16,501,4.964285714285714
