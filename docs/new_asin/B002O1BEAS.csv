8375796,5,B002O1BEAS,"Love Comes Softly is a wonderful set of movies, but ...

... you don't want to buy this 7-DVD set

Instead,

... get the TEN-movie set for less than a buck a movie, 10 DVDs, 10 movies, less than 10 dollars.

Look for:  LOVE COMES SOFTLY: 10TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION (see picture)

You will get all ten movies in this wonderful movie series. Heartbreak, Joy, Love, Fear, all from the point of view of people living in a small town on the prairie in the 19th century. Life is unpredictable yet full of surprises.

My copy of the 10-movie collection was delivered yesterday. I'm already on the seventh movie. Binge-watching these movies is my Easter present to myself.

I highly recommend the 10-movie LOVE COMES SOFTLY - TENTH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION to you. You'll love it.",1428192000,,771,4.701492537313433
8375797,5,B002O1BEAS,"I purchased this series of movies as a gift for my mother. She had indicated that she saw one of them on TV and really liked it. At 86, it's hard to find gifts for her. I ended up watching all of them with her over a period of several months. They were all really good movies and were very well written, had NO offensive language, a very positive message and interesting entertainment. I highly recommend watching them in order the first time. Then you can pick you favorites, as my mom did, and watch whenever you want to see a really good movie that leaves you with that ""warm fuzzy"" feeling. They are appropriate for any age and either boys or girls. This series is something that everyone in the family can enjoy.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Janette-Oke-the-Love-Comes-Softly-Series-Set-of-7-DVDs-Love-Comes-Softly-Love-s-Enduring-Promise-Love-s-Long-Journey-Love-s-Abiding-Joy-Love-s-Unending-Legacy-Love-s-Unfolding-Dream-Love-Takes-Wing/dp/B002O1BEAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Janette Oke the Love Comes Softly Series: (Set of 7 DVDs) Love Comes Softly; Love's Enduring Promise; Love's Long Journey; Love's Abiding Joy; Love's Unending Legacy; Love's Unfolding Dream; Love Takes Wing</a>",1293408000,,1242,6.398809523809524

8375799,5,B002O1BEAS,This is an excellent series. I have watched it on hallmark channel and wanted the dvd's for my home collection. I would recommend this series for the whole family.,1266364800,,163,4.655172413793103
8375800,5,B002O1BEAS,This is a series based on the religious aspect of those times.  I am more interested the the pioneer theme.  This series brings out the need for helping one another and working together to help survive during hard times.  We could use a lot more of working together and helping one another in todays society.,1261180800,,308,4.5636363636363635
