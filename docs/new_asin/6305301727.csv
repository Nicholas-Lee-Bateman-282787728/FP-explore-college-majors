1011609,5,6305301727,"A never ending fight. The story is a hoax. No, the story is right. No, the story is proved a hoax.
Hey, who knows?
Everybody had his reason to say hoax yes or hoax no, but honestly, nobody knows it realy.
Also the ""proved hoax"" screamer got the hoax-Information only from third persons on non-proved ways als non-proved Info.
But also the ""no hoax"" screamer have the same problem. Nobody was sitting in the room in this moment ""a"" person wrote this diary.
Nobody realy knows the truth.
I saw this book in german and in bought it again in english and I think I like to buy the DVD.
The story sounds good enough to be interesting.
It is possible ...... in the same way as many others storys about the possible true identity from Jack the ripper.",1351382400,2,743,4.35251798561151
1011610,3,6305301727,"A couple of years before this film was made, a purported diary of Jack the Ripper surfaced. This is the story of the attempt to prove it a hoax. The forensic science that went into the effort is detailed. What's interesting, however, is that the more they attempted to prove it a fake, the more the results proved it was probably authentic.

So who was Jack the Ripper? You think I'm going to give it away???

Warning: some police photos of the victims are shown, including the last one which was especially disgusting.",1336694400,2,519,4.56989247311828
1011611,5,6305301727,"What is most interesting about this video is the way different journalist sift the evidence.

There are two key items in the presentation:

1.  A British government department did a forensic examination and dated the diary at the time of the murders.

2.  Things described in the diary were kept secret by the police until recently.

The only conclusion that comes from these two facts is that the diary was written by either Jack or one of the few police detectives that knew the facts at that time.",1126915200,8,500,4.625
1011612,5,6305301727,"One of the main reasons I give this video five stars is that this truly unique video doesn't try to exploit the idea of the diary's existance...in fact, it tends to discourage it's viability, and with the semi-plausible/almost laughable excuse for the diary's possesion, and if it weren't for the timeline, i would even suggest that the 'possesor' was also the guilty party...however, with this being impossible, we must accept the possibility that this is indeed the diary of Jack...no one knows for sure, and even by the end of many repeat viewings, i have yet to come to a conclusion myself...but one conclusion i can draw is that this is one of the most fascinating cases of a video featuring 'talking heads' actually talking...you see every point of view, you're given facts, both pro and con, and even if you are an afficienado of the ripper tales, i guarantee you will still get more insights,not to mention that slight chill up your spine....",1010016000,13,950,4.798780487804878
1011613,5,6305301727,"It is a topsy-turvy inside-out back-to-front slippery-sick-and-poisonous catalog of facts that surround the life of Jack the Ripper! Admirably, this DVD documentary keeps to its primary objective: to conclusively identify the Whitechapel murderer!
To do this, the documentary examines The Diary of Jack the Ripper a text that documents the diarist's
(1) public-self and private-self divide; exacerbated by marriage to an attractive, younger, flirtatious, spirited woman
(2) determination to avenge the public insult caused to himself by what he judged to be his wife's public improprieties
(3) deepening rage and increasing loss of private sanity (while, characteristically, maintaining public composure)
(4) increasing belief in an answer to the 'problem'
(5) enactment of the complexly self-deduced answer i.e. the Whitechapel murders
(6) vicious reign of public terror accompanied by private glee, public games with letters to the public press for personal entertainment, narcissistic wonderment, cannibalism, and self-gratification
(7) sudden physical disintegration; the Whitechapel murders stop
(8) knowledge of his own imminent death
(9) signature (at close of text) as Jack the Ripper!
Additionally, the gross injustices to the young American wife (after the diarist's death) create weighty questions! The most likely answers to those questions also indicate that the diarist is the Whitechapel murderer!
Ignoring the conspiratorial and larger social issues that the questions raise, one lighter question persists: What about Doctor Fuller? Was he a hypnotist, drug counselor, a diagnostic incompetent or an early psychologist and genius? Whatever the answer, after the diarist's second consultation with Doctor Fuller, the Whitechapel murders stopped! The diary's madly-mixed shrieks and doggerel are replaced by the type of seductive requests for compassion that one would conventionally expect from an actor leaving the dramatic stage! What did Doctor Fuller say that brought this serial killer to his senses? Learning that answer would benefit medical professionals and police departments throughout the world!
For many fields of study, this refreshingly well-researched investigative documentary is recommended!",984614400,5,2224,5.99685534591195
7887930,5,6305301727,"Jack The Ripper ...There are too many coincidences, in the diary of James M., to not be conclusively related to the prostitute murders at that time.
 Well documented and graphical film. I tend to have an open mind and agree that James M.was the real murderer. He may very well have been lashing out at the evil wife, although, it would have been kinder to focus his rage upon her, not others. His break in the killings could also been attributed to his physical and mental condition. He enjoyed taunting the police; therefore he lavished in his fame, whoever the killer was. The viewer should watch and decide for themselves",1498780800,,624,4.672727272727273

7887934,4,6305301727,"This was sort of homemade but very interesting. It makes a compelling case. The one thing it does not say is why Jack suddenly stopped. Fear of getting caught, perhaps?
