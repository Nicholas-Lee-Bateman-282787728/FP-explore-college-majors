8761981,3,B01G24WJLA,"Asian Ghost Story isn't one of David Decoteau's best. Like a lot of his other recent movies, it has too many scenes of guys wandering around doing nothing really. What saves it is that all of the guys, Nicholas Simmons in particular, are pretty hot and most of them takes their shirts off at some point. There are some actual effective ""ghost"" scenes as well. See it if you're a fan of Decoteau's work!",1501977600,,402,4.445945945945946

8761983,1,B01G24WJLA,"A bunch of guys go ghost hunting in Canada. They take their shirts off, walk around in the woods, and get killed by a vengeful Chinese warrior ghost (looks like a Ninja) who wanted higher wages and better living conditions. First guy walks for 20 minutes without his shirt before getting killed, while the woman has on a coat and gloves. One guy makes it to the house and walks around without his shirt or pants. The acting was bad, the story was bad, soundtrack was bad, and the film wasn't even Asian. Cynthia Rothrock narrates. Cassidy Alexa makes an attempt at career suicide.

I believe Tom Vuu who played the eyes of the ghost is Vietnamese and not actually Chinese so once again they got the shaft.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Great film for beefcake.",1475625600,2,767,4.550724637681159
