6422276,5,B00KDUE3IC,"FANTASTIC! Blows A Certain Scientific Railgun Season 1 (and A Certain Magical Index) OUT OF THE WATER! This is what I wanted from season 1 to begin with. Learn more about the Sisters! *********spoiler if you haven't seen all of the 1st season - this is where we get down to the nitty gritty of the Clones of Railgun, their history, and how Misaka (sp?) is going to take care of business, stubbornly I might add haha - IMHO the most intriguing - and LEFT FEILD part of the first season *******spoiler end - and the dark Underworld of Academy city. Far less annoying panty jokes, and ""Sissy!"" stuff - much more serious action, the subtext is rich and linear throughout - I loved the hell out of it. Really hoping for a season 3 that's just as, if not even more epic! Theres so much more to love in Raligun S - Season 2 (the S stands for many things...). I can tell that if the series goes on - it will only get more epic from here on out! Don't miss it. And I know I said season 1 is scattered - its still a great season, and it was needed to be presented that way - for every thing to unfold as it does in season 2.",1408665600,,1114,4.068181818181818
6422297,5,B00KDUE3IC,"Is this the full second season, or just a part of it? Because whenever I look it up, they have the season split into two parts and not together.",1480723200,,144,4.0
6422298,5,B00KDUE3IC,"I've probably watched anime longer than most of you (I watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Astro-Boy/dp/B000E3LGDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Astro Boy</a>&nbsp;in first run on a B&W TV!), and there are certain things I like more than other things: I like heroines who lay it on the line, who accept the challenge, who stand between Danger and Everyone and Everything else.  (Similar stories can be found in the old TOEI classics of my youth&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-World-of-Puss-N-Boots/dp/B000F48DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful World of Puss 'N Boots</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Treasure-Island/dp/B000BLI5Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Treasure Island</a>.)

Given the fact that scientific railgun episodes are made later but occur sooner than magical index episodes, it was no surprise that this series redid the Multiple Misakas story line from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Certain-Magical-Index-Season-1/dp/B00MP2G3C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Certain Magical Index: Season 1</a>, but what DID astonish me was how they did it better, with more depth, and more heart!  A magnificent achievement!

6422323,5,B00KDUE3IC,"All right, all right! Now that I've leveled up from my reviews of yore, back when I merely commented on the first season, let's see if I can do justice to this, one of my favorite lighthearted anime series! And how peculiar it should be that the spin-off series gets its own 2nd season combo pack before A Certain Magical Index, might I add? Anyways, I suggest you take a looks at my review of the first season beforehand, just so you know what I mean when I make use terms like ""development"" and ""progress."" Fire away!

STORY: If you haven't seen ""A Certain Magical Index,"" you are going to love this story. It's split into three major parts: the Esper Wars, the Clone Wars, and the Mech Wars. Unlike the 1st season, which was mostly shoujo, this is geared towards action. And, by action, I mean characters doing something...and fighting, of course. Regarding arcs, the first and last are the best, giving us thrilling battles in the first arc with new superpowers and Mikoto flying solo, which is pretty cool, and fantastic character and story development picking up from the last season that makes full circle in the last arc. Now, here's where this season falls in comparison to its second season and the ""Index"" side of the franchise. Some of the plot is recycled, as it is a different perception on some of the arcs in the 1st ""Index"" season, and seems much like the endless eight arc of Haruhi Suzumiya. Things get boring if you already watched ""Index"" prior to this (or vice versa), and it gets REALLY boring if you do not enjoy the primary character(s) introduced in this arc. The one plus it had was more of Accelerator's blissful cruelty when he was still worth squat, which is always an odd party to attend.

CHARACTERS: It stands to reason that Mikoto Misaka is one of the great anime heroines. She's tomboyish, a tsundere, girly at times, intelligent, independent but still a great friend...the only thing she does that is annoying is pick on Touma, but then it always leads to enjoyable banter and it's amused to see her beaten by the original One-Punch Man. Kuroko Shirai is cute and has a great dynamic with Mikoto, as do the rest of the friends. This is one of the great comraderies, especially strong since they can all stand adequately in their own character arcs. The villains are memorable: The mad scientist, the superpowered femme fatales, ACCELERATOR...I seem to have forgotten a few of the others. But that's because I'm trying my darnedest not to get confused with the 1st season.

ANIMATION: Look at the art on the cover. The poses are nothing spectacular, but the colors are bright, the backgrounds clean, and the characters crisp, smooth and shiny. It's consistently like this for the entire show. Academic City is as wondrous as ever in all its tech-savvy glory, and the animation is as fluid as lightning. Speaking of lightning, Mikoto's powers steal any frame that they're in, and the battles truly pull out all the stops. This will look dazzling in Blu-ray, sparing no expense, naturally.

MUSIC: I don't remember it. And music can actually save my opinion of a show (such as in the instances of ""Noir"" and ""Heroic Age""), yet I forgot this particular score. Hmmm...it must be because it's the same thing from all of its predecessors, Index and Railgun alike. That poppy, techno-beat mix? Same stuff here. The openings are nice to look at, see the girls having fun, give foreshadowing to characters and events, but the tunes are not going to grab you. Now, I was willing to look into the openings again, but you'll have to watch the rest of the show to hear the music in each episode; forgive me that it's been a while since I've watched this show.

There are some downsides to CSRS. The first is that you must watch the first season, and maybe even the first season of ACMI, beforehand. Chronologically, CSR season 1 starts first, ACMI season 1 is second, then this, then ACMI season 2, and then the movie. If you like this show, turns out that you'll be watching a lot of it. I'm talking 96 episodes and a movie: Now THAT is commitment. Also, CSRS has the odd predicament of putting out dark tones, just like its predecessor, but not creating the atmosphere necessary for such tones to flourish. I wouldn't be lying saying that the mech battle is a disappointing climax considering what we've seen up until then. In fact, the whole ending felt like a joke. BUT DO NOT disregard it for that. Like I've said, CSRS is only a small cog in a much larger mechanism, just like Fate/Stay Night. Except in this series, the timeline is the same, so the world only progresses in a positive way on the development meter. Not necessarily my favorite installment of Academic City, but nonetheless a memorable and important one. It is well worth the ride even if you do not reach the destination in this set. Take my word as you see fit.

UPDATE: I didn't know where to put this into the review, but the OVA is NOT included with this release, and the actual cover art is the same as that of the Season 2 Part 1 release (which, in my opinion, is an improvement).",1447804800,6,5081,4.596471885336274

6422327,5,B00KDUE3IC,"This is one of the finest series I've ever seen and I include regular live action series!  The sisters arc, which was original told in A Certain Magical Index is retold here from Mikoto Misaka's point of view and it is clearly superior.  The characters have more depth to them in this arc and you understand the motives of the individuals.  All three of the main characters were explored in greater detail.  Brittney Karbowski, the English voice of Mikoto Misaka does a fabulous job.  Her voice inflections made you feel the emotions the character was going through.  MIcah Solusod did a wonderful job of playing Toma.  Austin just an excellent job of showing the motives of Accelerator and how not everything is black and white.  It's a movie quality type story!

However the series in general is very high quality even without the sisters arc.  Super show.",1434412800,2,858,4.775510204081633

I consider this revision of the sister's arc to be one of the most compelling and satisfying story arcs in an anime in quite some time, and Mikoto and Touma's interactions just make it SHINE. The filler arc that follows and showcases all four girls doing what they do best is also a nice capper to the latest season in the Academy City series.

8657956,5,B00KDUE3IC,"Defnintly one of my favourite Anime series of all time. The 2nd Season is waaaay better then the first, but that's not to say the 1st season is bad. Now somethings I've noticed is that some people don't know the order of watch the ""A certain"" series. Now one would recommend watching them in the order: A Certain Scientific Railgun, A Certain Scientific Railgun So (Season 2/this product), A Certain Magical Index, A Certain Magical Index S2, A Certain Magical Index Movie, etc. Now the reason you watch the Railgun series first SI not only is it a prequel but with where it lines up with Index, The 1st 15 episodes of Season 2 of Railgun is the same as beginning of the 1st Season of Index (eps  3-7? Of index) although through Mikoto's eyes (which makes it way better/more understanding of what's going on). Where if you watch Index first it butchers the emotions you get from S2 of Railgun. Cause not only does Railguns have the arc at 15 episodes compared to Index's 4 Episodes, but Index is very lacking in info for it until the end. (Whcih honestly makes it feel kind of forced) which is why I recommend starting with the Railgun Series.",1493596800,,1143,4.521739130434782
