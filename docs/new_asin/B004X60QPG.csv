This coming year we will happily revisit many and spend time in Kotor, Montenegro and Dubrovnik.  The series is invaluable for all the good advice given.",1353024000,,270,4.489795918367347
4492093,5,B004X60QPG,"I used to travel all the time, one of lifes greatest pleasures.  No longer able to travel, this collection takes me to places I still want to visit.  And it has proved to be the next best thing.  Although I've seen most of the videos on PBS, I can now view them whenever I want. I can still travel to far off places via the videos.  In my opinion, this Rick Steves production is a must if you love or loved to travel.",1352332800,6,417,3.9879518072289155

4492096,5,B004X60QPG,"I have always enjoyed Rick Steves and have used his books extensively on my trips through Europe.  He never steers you wrong and guides you to some places that you would never think to go to had it not been for him and his team.

Even if you can't travel yourself, these 90 episodes will give you a taste for Europe that is beyond compare.... and it may even help those who are weary of taking trips beyond guided tours, to head out on their own without fear.  The extra features give you some nitty gritty practical guidance that will help even the seasoned traveler.

I look forward to the next series...",1340236800,13,606,4.383928571428571
4492097,5,B004X60QPG,"I bought a Eurail pass from Rick Steves back in 1983, the early days of his travel business. At that point, ""Europe Through the Back Door"" was only a storefront tour company and nascent publishing operation in a suburb of Seattle. The pass came with a free hour of one-on-one consultation from Rick himself. Now that he's built a small empire from the insatiable American appetite for European travel, this service is no longer offered (though if you visit Edmonds, you can consult gratis with a member of his personally trained staff). But his advice still holds good, and his long-running television series gives you a whirlwind tour of the continent's most attractive, intriguing, and culturally educational destinations.

Rick's earnest, avuncular manner and knowledgeable, can-do advice are just the encouragement many folks need to explore the highways and byways of Europe. He doesn't try to cover every last corner, but he hits all the highlights and many out-of-the-way delights that only old travel hands know. Some of these places have changed considerably over the past few years, so don't expect up-to-date or step-by-step details from the DVDs. What you get are gorgeous views to inspire your travels (armchair or real) together with insightful history, art and architecture, food and drink, and other advice from Rick and local guides. However long your visit may be, they want you to discover the real Europe, and real Europeans, at a relaxed pace and a reasonable price.

Following is a list of episodes on the 14 discs in ""Rick Steves' Europe: All 90 Shows,"" which were filmed between 1995 and 2011. The 39 earliest episodes (until 2002) were not filmed in high definition, but the remainder are presented in HD.

4492109,5,B004X60QPG,"I've loved Rick Steves' travel programs on PBS for years and I just couldn't pass up an opportunity to own all 90 of his post-2000 shows.  Watching an episode is like going on a trip yourself.  Amazing sights, fascinating people, and insights into culture and history await you in these episodes.  Rick has perfected the art travel and it comes across in how clear and easy these programs are to digest.  These shows make me feel relaxed and peaceful.  I'm not sure if that's from the show's beautiful vistas, gentle pacing, tranquil music, or Rick Steves' soothing, almost spiritual voice.  It's probably all of the above.  Highly recommended!",1357344000,,644,4.907407407407407
