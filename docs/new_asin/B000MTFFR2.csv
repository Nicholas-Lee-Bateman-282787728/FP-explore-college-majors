2747890,3,B000MTFFR2,"This movie is okay, not the greatest, but not the worst. I can't see why so much was made of Victor Mature, he's not really that great of an actor or that handsome.",1231459200,,164,4.0
2747891,5,B000MTFFR2,"I watched the China Doll movie DVD that I received from Amazon.com and thought it was very entertaining movie.  The movie builds up the relationship between Capt. Brandon (Victor Mature) and Shu Jin (Li Li Hua) which leads to their marriage and having a little baby.  It is sad at the end as both Shu Jin and Capt. Brandon are both killed, but it was nice to see the daughter 14 years later being met at Los Angeles Airport by Capt. Brandon's old crew.  I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes movies that end up being very heartwarming.",1216684800,,547,4.45

2747893,2,B000MTFFR2,"This movie [now a DVD] was made in 1958 and it covers the pilots who flew  over the Himalayan mountains from Burma-Tibet-China...this movie lacks genuine art/direction for the various tableaus look so flimsy throughout the entire film...every GI was spit-shined and plenty of booze for all hands [is there a war going on??]...Victor Mature is almost in every scene as a hard-bitten Commanding Officer but shows hardly any emotion even when annoyed...the cast around him is second string all the way except for Ward Bond...and as for singer Johnny Desmond, he is totally forgettable in the role of a pilot...on the bright side the Chinese actress LiLi Hua is perfect in her virginal/traditional role and very easy on the eyes, too...the story/line is good with a tearful ending for the only survivor to arrive in the USA...I think it is over/priced for the final product...this here movie could have been Vic Mature's sayonara to his long and wonderful film career......SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FMF",1180396800,13,994,5.098159509202454
2747894,4,B000MTFFR2,"CHINA DOLL is a finely-pitched wartime drama.  Victor Mature plays Capt. Cliff Brandon, a  disillusioned airman fighting against the Japanese.  One morning he wakes up to discover he has purchased the services of a beautiful Chinese housekeeper, Shu-Jen (played by the celebrated Asian actress Li Li Hua in one of her rare American film appearances).

This is one of the better films produced by Frank Borzage around this period.  Just like the similarly-themed ""Sayonara"" and ""The World of Suzie Wong"", CHINA DOLL explores the problems and prejudices involved in a cross-cultural relationship.

Victor Mature is fine playing Captain Brandon; but it's Li Li Hua who really owns this picture.  She only made a handful of movies in America, but here she is truly magnificent.  The cast also includes Ward Bond, Bob Mathias, Johnny Desmond and Elaine Devry.

It's great to see CHINA DOLL finally on DVD.  The disc offers no extras but the anamorphic transfer looks a treat.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1180396800,20,1006,5.186335403726708
2747895,4,B000MTFFR2,"I disagree with Mr. Sarno's negative review.  I enjoyed this film very much.  Yes I love Victor Mature, but I really enjoyed the
emotional story and the war story.  I'm not nit picking every aspect of the movie; it is Hollywood.  It kept my interest for sure

2747898,3,B000MTFFR2,"There is an epic movie somewhere in the script of China Doll, but audiences will never see it. The beginning of the film betrays the viewer. The film starts off smartly introducing the characters, their environment, and subsequent interactions. China Doll (1958, Frank Borzage) is similar to Love is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955, Henry King) starring William Holden and Jennifer Jones, but is frankly better than that film as it contains a better opening and middle. The end of the film is its downfall. Rushed, confusing, and clichd Li Hua Li's single-mother character must navigate war-torn country with babe-in-arms (sounds like its been done before). Speaking of Li Hua Li, she is very good even in the most dreadful of scenes towards the film's end, but shines in the early portions of the film and she matches and out-performs seasoned leading-man Victor Mature in almost every scene. When watching Victor Mature the viewer gets the sense that there is a good actor hiding under that crusty exterior, a good actor who doesn't seem challenged, but Li Hua Li brings Mature out of his haze. The two leads work very well together and the audience must thank veteran director Frank Borzage for that accomplishment as he handled this type of material before. Also, it is interesting to note the inter-racial relationship between the white American male pilot and the female Asian domestic in a 1950s film.",1425772800,,1406,4.987234042553191

2747904,1,B000MTFFR2,"For a movie set in the China-Burma Theater of WWII in 1943, this could have been one of the best classic war films of all time.  General Chennault (of ""Flying Tigers"") did in fact marry a Chinese woman after the war, and this theme could have been handled in a classy way.  Instead, I would not even put this film on the list of the top 50 or 100.  The scriptwriting was terrible and many of the lines are either ludicrous or jarringly out of place (nonsequiturs).  Did Mature's character (the Captain) really just say ""I'd marry you in pigeon English""?  During a bombing scene, we are told that a person ""ran to the tower.""  Rather than to the ditches and bomb shelters like everybody else in that war was trained and ordered to do?

Since Li Li Hua's character cannot speak more than 3 words of English, there is no real on-screen chemistry or action between the two leading roles that reveals a budding romance or love.  It seemed pretty impersonal, then, suddenly, the Captain says almost in passing to a local priest that ""something happened.""  In just a few more film minutes, one of the American WAC's blurts out that  Li Li Hua's character ""is pregnant.""  (How did the WAC know and before the Captain who was living with the Chinese girl as housekeeper?)

There is apparently no war on.  There is virtually no flying in the first 90 percent of the film, and the Captain has a remarkably unhurried, relaxed lifestyle of mainly home-priest-bar.  There are no Japanese enemy seen until the very ending of the film.  I don't think they are even mentioned earlier, either.  This is far removed from the reality of the real tempo of constant flight operations (and Japanese bombings) at that time in China.

As a veteran military pilot, I found it particularly distasteful and inappropriate that the scriptwriter had Mature insult and degrade his entire crew in public.  No Pilot In Command would have ever lasted 5 minutes in a leadership role by acting that way, nor developed any loyalty in his crew.

SEMI-SPOILER ALERT:

For audiences leaving the theaters in 1958, this must have been a pretty depressing film, since both lead characters are killed off.  The ending was totally unsatisfactory and leaves the viewer with an empty feeling.  I expected a lot better.",1407024000,3,2270,4.708121827411167

2747906,5,B000MTFFR2,"Lovely, sad wartime love story between an embittered American military officer and a Chinese girl.  The officer, when drunk inadvertently buys a peasant's daughter for three months.  The soldier and the girl eventually fall in love and marry.  The most touching moments occur during the climatic air battle.  The Warner Home Video DVD release is excellent.  Highly recommended.",1390867200,2,377,5.431034482758621

2747908,5,B000MTFFR2,This is an overlooked movie by many. I is a very touching story of love and how it can change one's life. A must see.,1361923200,2,117,3.72
2747909,4,B000MTFFR2,"Whoever wrote the product description for Amazon for this movie apparently never saw the movie. Not to give the ending away but what this describes as what happens at the end is absolutely wrong and needs to be changed as it is misleading.  Victor Mature was never a great actor but there isn't now and never has been a face like that on the movie screen. It is unique. I saw him once many years ago in New Orleans and recognized him instantly. He fits this part perfectly as it is an older rather jaded character boozing his way through his spare time in a war zone. I was not impressed with the beauty of the Chinese girl and she was waaaaaay too made up, hair too Americanized, but she did a very good job in the role. For a while it seemed like they were playing it mostly for humor then the story turned and it became all drama.  For a movie about that time made during that time I thought it was well done. Once I started looking at it I couldn't stop.  The only real jarring note and every time I see it I think the same thing ""Why on earth would he put a baby down in a place that is being bombed where even if it survived it would probably not be found until it had long since died of starvation or exposure then go off and get himself killed deliberately?""",1349222400,5,1266,4.138211382113822
2747910,5,B000MTFFR2,"This is a movie that i've wanted for over 20 yrs. Amazon.com is my hero!!!! This movie made me cry when i watched it after i had seen it with my dad, who died in 1990. This is a movie that makes me feel closer to him.",1306022400,2,217,3.6382978723404253
2747911,4,B000MTFFR2,"This 1958 film directed by Frank Borzage was set in China during World War II.  ""Captain Cliff Brandon"" (Victor Mature), drinking away his tour as a Hump Pilot, takes in ""Shu-Jen"" (played by the Hong Kong film star Lihua Li) as his housekeeper.  A gruff and distant relationship becomes affectionate; love follows; the two marry and have a daughter; and then the Japanese attack.

The film can be appreciated from a number of angles.

-- Intercultural marriage.  American moviegoers were offered ""Sayonara"" in 1957, ""South Pacific"" and ""China Doll"" in 1958, and ""Bridge to the Sun"" in 1961.  The treatments now show their age, but the different plots and characters were addressing interracial marriage, perhaps in response to the small but growing number of GIs returned from Japan and Korea with wives.  These films, even though they were about white-Asian marriages, should be recognized for denting interracial taboos, laying important psychological foundations for the Civil Rights movement a few years later.

-- War film.  ""China Doll"" gave more visibility to the American aviators in the China-Burma-India theatre.  Spliced into the film are great scenes, originally shot by combat cameramen, of troop carrier aircraft dropping supplies to the American and Chinese troops crossing Burma.

--  Aviation movie:  There are some fine scenes of the C-47 and the equipment and uniforms used during the war.  Inexplicably, the film editors who put together the other flying sequences must have had hangovers, and aviation buffs will no doubt wince at the several editing whoppers.

Finally, if you happen to watch the film with Chinese friends, be prepared to hear them laugh out loud at the Hollywood characters' attempts to speak lines in Chinese.  Ward Bond had many virtues, but Mandarin dialog was not one.  On the other hand, they will nod in appreciation when Bond, playing a missionary, ""Father Cairns,"" says, speaking of 1943, ""I know China's somewhat behind the times, but you give her time and she'll catch up.""

On recieving, I cleared my afternoon, took the phone of the hook so not to be disurbed, sat down and enjoyed every minute of it.  It's not Academy Award stuff, just a lovely romantic romp,something to get lost in for an hour and a half.
