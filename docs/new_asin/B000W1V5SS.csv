2961068,5,B000W1V5SS,"Freakin' Awesome!
Finally something that puts God back in the center of this holiday (holy day)! We have to tell this society and the media that we want Christ as the  center of Christmas and this is the prefect way to do just that. A beautiful depiction of the Christmas story that everyone must see!",1194480000,8,301,4.472727272727273
2961069,5,B000W1V5SS,"I recently received copies of ""The Birth of Christ"" on both DVD and CD.  The music from this performance is spectacular, inspiring, and at times transcendent - particularly during soprano soloist Amy Bils' rendition of The Magnificat in ""Mary's Canticle.""  This piece alone is worth the purchase of the entire album!  Add to that stellar performances by tenor Robert McPherson and baritone John B. Cooper, along with the beautiful acoustics and breathtaking lighting of Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin and altogether this recording represents an extraordinary musical masterpiece.

Composer Andrew T. Miller has created a modern classic that is sure to stand the test of time.

This will be at the top of my present list for 2007.",1194393600,39,732,5.169491525423729

The soloists are stellar, the choir is robust and on key, the orchestra soars like a bird - truly music at it's best. I have never seen lighting inside a church become so beautiful.  My hat is off to Mr. Miller who brings a traditional story to life with a different perspective and yet, all from Biblical passages.  This DVD will remain a valuable treasure of mine for years.  I have purchased several for those family members who are hard to please.  Now we have something quality to watch after the big feasts this holiday season.

The characters come alive for us today in a wonderful new way. The stage set at Christ Church Cathedral, lights in a most unique way, and brings a depth of feeling to the Christmas story rivaled only by the light of the Bethlehem star.

Your heart and emotions will flow from the start of ""One Blessed Night"" to its penultimate finish :>) Let your imagination float with the soaring colors, hues, acting, and, best of all, music recorded at Christ Church Cathedral (only 1 block from where Handel debuted ""The Messiah"").  The Protestant and Catholic choirs that were amassed for this production are only outdone by the tantalizing high-tenor tones of Robert McPherson (a regular with The Met), the haunting and beautiful baritone bravado engineered by one John B. Cooper, and the incomparable melodies fully embodied in Mother Mary by none other than...well, to find out, I guess you'll just have to get one, or some, of these for Christmas! :>) :>)",1192752000,25,746,5.114754098360656

2961079,5,B000W1V5SS,"I have listened to a lot of 20th century ""classical"" music written for various events and groups and most of it won't last through the decade.  The exception is to this rule is ""The Birth of Christ"" by Andrew T. Miller.  The music is soaringly beautiful, richly orchestrated, and impeccably performed here.  The narration by Liam Neeson provides the back story to the music and its performance, and enhances it beautifully.

I was so taken by it during a PBS pledge drive (yes, I even watched a pledge drive to see all of this - it was that good!) that I recorded it and watched and listened to it over and over again during the Advent season.  I purchased both the DVD and CD (to see and hear it without the pledge drive). The DVD is more complete with the visuals of the church setting and singers adding to the performance.  The DVD also has additional material by Liam Neeson not found on the CD.

I highly recommend it for anyone who loves great Christmas cantatas.",1200787200,2,970,4.4772727272727275

2961082,5,B000W1V5SS,"I first saw this performed on EWTN and was astounded at the superlative performances and the beauty of the music.  I promptly ordered two CDS from Amazon, and sent one to my kids in Seattle.  They loved it as well, and said they will be listening to it every Christmas as a family celebration.  It is truly  an 'agent of peace' as it brought together the disparate choirs of protestant and Catholic choirs to perform together in Northern Ireland and the lyrics bring the message of peace and love into the hearts of any who hear this incredible music.  Liam Neeson was excellent in performing the narrative...a nice contrast to the soaring music, I thought.",1200009600,,657,4.678260869565217

Basically, just a verse from the narrative put to some notes that went up and down a lot. I was minded of Antoni Salieri when I was hoping for a Mozart.

If you are a music snob like me, pass this one by.",1200009600,4,343,4.119402985074627
2961085,5,B000W1V5SS,"Five stars just does not do justice to this magnificent, majestic choral prayer! I heard of it thru the EWTN interview by R.Arroyo with composer Andrew T Miller. Hearing only clips I was so moved that I ordered a half dozen, then another half dozen, then another to give away. I have not participated in Chrismas gift giving for decades but this piece screemed to be spread around and it was as joyous to give out the nearly 30 DVDs so far as it is to experience this performance. Andrew Miller's talent and faithful witness in rendering this composition makes for a whole different way of spreading the Gospel. This is true objective beauty; the result of humans saying yes to God and collaborating with God in spreading His Joy, His Peace, His Power and Glory!! The experience is ineffable as Andrew T Miller and all the voices and mucisians come together making immanent the pure transcendent.  TEN STARS for this. The Birth of Christ DVD - watch it year round. You won't regret it.
Fast Forward to Christmas 2010 - It is now three years since I purchased The Birth of Christ DVD and since then I have purchased nearly 100 to give as gifts each Christmas.  It is a gift to be able to share such exquisite beauty of our faith with others.  I also bought 20 CDs and have one in my care CD player.  This production need more margeting to get the word out.  It is too spectacular to have this slide into the back row.  I have gotten very positive feedback from those with whom I shared The Birth of Christ but unfortunately people who love it never heard of it until I gave it to them.  I pray that more will discover this magnificent Christmas cantata  and the the talents of Andrew T Miller will find their fruits in showcased for audiences around the world.  I pray for him and his apostalate and continue to await The Passion and Resurrection planned as the natural sequel.",1199577600,,1876,4.478005865102639
2961086,5,B000W1V5SS,"I have watched this over and over again. The music brings tears every time. ""One Blessed Night"" is almost too beautiful. It takes me to a place that I can only think is at the threshold of heaven. ""The Annunciation of Christ"" (-She said, ""Yes""-), has a similar effect.
This became my favorite gift to those who I know will cherish this masterpiece for the rest of their lives. I have no doubt that this will become a classic that today's believers will want to pass on to future generations.
Thank you Andrew T. Miller, for responding to God's grace and writing this inspired work. Thank you, Amy Bils, Richard McPherson, and all the other immensely talented soloists who have used their talents for the glory of God. Finally, thank you to the choirs, both Catholic and Protestant, who came together to make this beautiful offering to God. See what can be done when we are united!",1199145600,,880,4.611464968152866
2961087,5,B000W1V5SS,"I saw ""The Birth of Christ"" Cantata on PBS and was so engulfed by the beauty of the music and the way it told the Christmas story that I had to order the DVD right away. Let me tell you, that even though, it has been five days since Christmas, I still cannot stop watching this. I need to get the CD. But the DVD is definitely the one to get first if you cannot decide and cannot get both. The emotions the singers show, the whole atmosphere of the cathedral, lighting, all of it makes everything even the more grand. And the beautiful blue gown soprano Amy Bils wears is perfect for Mary. But the music.. the music is so spectacular. So beautiful and transcendent. It really pulls you in and gives a great inner peace. Amy Bils and tenor Robert McPherson have such angelic voices. The other singers are truly excellent as well. Everyone, including the choir and orchestra, make this a perfect masterpiece. And I think it is something that not only can be watched for Christmas time, but any time. It is a magnificent piece of sacred music. Thank you Andrew T. Miller for putting this all together! It is certainly a genius piece of work.",1198972800,2,1138,4.423809523809524
2961088,5,B000W1V5SS,The music on this cd is a joy and the setting for the performance is beautiful.  A very talented group.  Andrew T. Miller is a natural as a musical composer and conducter.  This ia a must listen during every Christmas season.,1198800000,,225,4.439024390243903
2961089,5,B000W1V5SS,"A magnificent piece of Christmas music composed and conducted by Andrew T. Miller.  We'll be hearing more from this extraordinary musical genius.  Miller not only has chosen very talented professionals to carry this off, but his intertwining of Jewish musical themes in this dramatic and dynamic scriptural history took my breath away.  There is also a beautiful narration of the birth of Christ by Liam Neeson but no liberties were taken with the text of Luke's gospel.  This is well worth purchasing; and it will take you through the year with its beauty.",1198713600,,557,4.956989247311828
2961090,5,B000W1V5SS,"There are hardly adequate words to describe this work. It is destined to become a classic. I have watched it on EWTN where I first discovered it and saw the interview with Andrew Miller, Composer done by Raymond Arroyo from EWTN News.

Get it folks...you will not be disappointed. If you aren't sure, watch it on EWTN and see what I saw, feel what I felt.

2961091,5,B000W1V5SS,"What a dicovery!  I just saw this piece performed on tv and it was a moving experience.  If you are touched by the story of the gift of Jesus Christ's Birth, you will find this piece a loving tribute.  And as a classical musician myself I compare this to Vaughan-Williams pieces in choral and orchestral writing.  It has Vaughan_Williams very moving and beautiful influence in its style and line.  It's worth getting the DVD performance as it has many more advantages.  These are seeing the facial interplay between singers,  instead of just facing the audience.  They seem very moved and involved in their performance.  As other reviewers have said, the Mary Canticle is very moving.  But so are the choral parts with orchestra.  Liam Neeson is a splendid narrator (his being Irish adds meaning) reading from the Bible.  We see and hear two choirs from both Ireland's that are Catholic and Protestant putting aside differneces to celebrate and reflect on the birth of our Lord.  The setting is Kings College in Ireland, where fittingly Liam Neeson says the Catholic George Handel employed Protestant Choirs to debut his ""Messiah"".  What a wonderful connection!  Lastly, we are fortunate to watch the composer conduct his own work.  Excellent conducting and great composer.  The Lord blessed this composer with moving talent.",1198281600,,1325,5.032258064516129
2961092,5,B000W1V5SS,"Andrew Miller's ""Birth of Christ"" is destined to become a modern classic. This performance is moving and beautiful, with Miller's inspired music enhanced by Liam Neeson's powerful narrative. Perfect for the Christmas season!",1197504000,,224,5.818181818181818
2961093,5,B000W1V5SS,"I am a longtime member of church choirs and have sung many cantatas over the years.  This is, in my opinion, the most exciting and beautiful cantata I have ever heard.  One song is sung in Hebrew (or is it Aramaic?) and is the prayer for the coming of the Messiah -- beautiful.  The most stirring is the ""Birth of Christ"" song in the cantata where the people are shouting ""Is this the one? Is this the one?"". It as much highlights the faith of the Jewish people and their relationship with God as it tells the story of the birth of Jesus as the Christ (Messiah).  I would recommend watching the DVD to enjoy the production and the CD to listen to with eyes closed in meditation.",1195257600,10,678,4.2734375
2961094,5,B000W1V5SS,"I am lucky to know Andy and was fortunate enough to work with him for some years before The Birth of Christ was officially released.  The Federal Way Chorale first performed this cantata in December 2004.  We knew right away this was destined for great things.  I was also privileged to go to Dublin in August 2006 and participate in this performance.  The music is spine tingling beautiful and I never get tired of hearing it.  I still get tears in my eyes when I hear One Blessed Night and Mary's Canticle!

You won't be disappointed in this.  Keep your eye on Andrew T. Miller because you will be hearing more from him.  He has a great gift from God and is an extremely talented artist.

Immediately after hearing that the DVD and CD were being release on Nov. 6, I immediately ordered both. I was fortunate to receive them, Saturday, Nov. 10, and immediately started viewing the DVD.
The title of my review describes my experience in viewing and listening. The sheer magnificence of the music, with all its nuances, raised the goosebumps. Listening to the soaring, lyrical lines, especially as sung by Robert McPherson and Amy Bils, brought the fountain of tears. It was also great to see the interplay of facial expressions, between the soloists.
It was a true delight, to watch Andy in action, directing the entire ensemble. Hearing that the ensemble was truly international and ecumenical in scope, added to the beauty of the experience.",1194739200,19,934,4.917721518987341

I pray that more will discover this magnificent Christmas cantata  and the the talents of Andrew T Miller will find their fruits in showcased for audiences around the world.  I pray for him and his apostalate and continue to await The Passion and Resurrection planned as the natural sequel.",1199577600,,1876,4.478005865102639
3195583,5,B000W1V5SS,"I have watched this over and over again. The music brings tears every time. ""One Blessed Night"" is almost too beautiful. It takes me to a place that I can only think is at the threshold of heaven. ""The Annunciation of Christ"" (-She said, ""Yes""-), has a similar effect.
This became my favorite gift to those who I know will cherish this masterpiece for the rest of their lives. I have no doubt that this will become a classic that today's believers will want to pass on to future generations.
Thank you Andrew T. Miller, for responding to God's grace and writing this inspired work. Thank you, Amy Bils, Richard McPherson, and all the other immensely talented soloists who have used their talents for the glory of God. Finally, thank you to the choirs, both Catholic and Protestant, who came together to make this beautiful offering to God. See what can be done when we are united!",1199145600,,880,4.611464968152866
3195584,5,B000W1V5SS,"I saw ""The Birth of Christ"" Cantata on PBS and was so engulfed by the beauty of the music and the way it told the Christmas story that I had to order the DVD right away. Let me tell you, that even though, it has been five days since Christmas, I still cannot stop watching this. I need to get the CD. But the DVD is definitely the one to get first if you cannot decide and cannot get both. The emotions the singers show, the whole atmosphere of the cathedral, lighting, all of it makes everything even the more grand. And the beautiful blue gown soprano Amy Bils wears is perfect for Mary. But the music.. the music is so spectacular. So beautiful and transcendent. It really pulls you in and gives a great inner peace. Amy Bils and tenor Robert McPherson have such angelic voices. The other singers are truly excellent as well. Everyone, including the choir and orchestra, make this a perfect masterpiece. And I think it is something that not only can be watched for Christmas time, but any time. It is a magnificent piece of sacred music. Thank you Andrew T. Miller for putting this all together! It is certainly a genius piece of work.",1198972800,2,1138,4.423809523809524
3195585,5,B000W1V5SS,The music on this cd is a joy and the setting for the performance is beautiful.  A very talented group.  Andrew T. Miller is a natural as a musical composer and conducter.  This ia a must listen during every Christmas season.,1198800000,,225,4.439024390243903
3195586,5,B000W1V5SS,"A magnificent piece of Christmas music composed and conducted by Andrew T. Miller.  We'll be hearing more from this extraordinary musical genius.  Miller not only has chosen very talented professionals to carry this off, but his intertwining of Jewish musical themes in this dramatic and dynamic scriptural history took my breath away.  There is also a beautiful narration of the birth of Christ by Liam Neeson but no liberties were taken with the text of Luke's gospel.  This is well worth purchasing; and it will take you through the year with its beauty.",1198713600,,557,4.956989247311828
3195587,5,B000W1V5SS,"There are hardly adequate words to describe this work. It is destined to become a classic. I have watched it on EWTN where I first discovered it and saw the interview with Andrew Miller, Composer done by Raymond Arroyo from EWTN News.

Get it folks...you will not be disappointed. If you aren't sure, watch it on EWTN and see what I saw, feel what I felt.

3195588,5,B000W1V5SS,"What a dicovery!  I just saw this piece performed on tv and it was a moving experience.  If you are touched by the story of the gift of Jesus Christ's Birth, you will find this piece a loving tribute.  And as a classical musician myself I compare this to Vaughan-Williams pieces in choral and orchestral writing.  It has Vaughan_Williams very moving and beautiful influence in its style and line.  It's worth getting the DVD performance as it has many more advantages.  These are seeing the facial interplay between singers,  instead of just facing the audience.  They seem very moved and involved in their performance.  As other reviewers have said, the Mary Canticle is very moving.  But so are the choral parts with orchestra.  Liam Neeson is a splendid narrator (his being Irish adds meaning) reading from the Bible.  We see and hear two choirs from both Ireland's that are Catholic and Protestant putting aside differneces to celebrate and reflect on the birth of our Lord.  The setting is Kings College in Ireland, where fittingly Liam Neeson says the Catholic George Handel employed Protestant Choirs to debut his ""Messiah"".  What a wonderful connection!  Lastly, we are fortunate to watch the composer conduct his own work.  Excellent conducting and great composer.  The Lord blessed this composer with moving talent.",1198281600,,1325,5.032258064516129
3195589,5,B000W1V5SS,"Andrew Miller's ""Birth of Christ"" is destined to become a modern classic. This performance is moving and beautiful, with Miller's inspired music enhanced by Liam Neeson's powerful narrative. Perfect for the Christmas season!",1197504000,,224,5.818181818181818
3195590,5,B000W1V5SS,"I am a longtime member of church choirs and have sung many cantatas over the years.  This is, in my opinion, the most exciting and beautiful cantata I have ever heard.  One song is sung in Hebrew (or is it Aramaic?) and is the prayer for the coming of the Messiah -- beautiful.  The most stirring is the ""Birth of Christ"" song in the cantata where the people are shouting ""Is this the one? Is this the one?"". It as much highlights the faith of the Jewish people and their relationship with God as it tells the story of the birth of Jesus as the Christ (Messiah).  I would recommend watching the DVD to enjoy the production and the CD to listen to with eyes closed in meditation.",1195257600,10,678,4.2734375
3195591,5,B000W1V5SS,"I am lucky to know Andy and was fortunate enough to work with him for some years before The Birth of Christ was officially released.  The Federal Way Chorale first performed this cantata in December 2004.  We knew right away this was destined for great things.  I was also privileged to go to Dublin in August 2006 and participate in this performance.  The music is spine tingling beautiful and I never get tired of hearing it.  I still get tears in my eyes when I hear One Blessed Night and Mary's Canticle!

You won't be disappointed in this.  Keep your eye on Andrew T. Miller because you will be hearing more from him.  He has a great gift from God and is an extremely talented artist.

3195592,5,B000W1V5SS,"I'm proud to say that Andy Miller is a friend of mine. I was unfortunately unable to participate in any of the performances of this brand new ""classic"" about the birth of our Lord.
Immediately after hearing that the DVD and CD were being release on Nov. 6, I immediately ordered both. I was fortunate to receive them, Saturday, Nov. 10, and immediately started viewing the DVD.
The title of my review describes my experience in viewing and listening. The sheer magnificence of the music, with all its nuances, raised the goosebumps. Listening to the soaring, lyrical lines, especially as sung by Robert McPherson and Amy Bils, brought the fountain of tears. It was also great to see the interplay of facial expressions, between the soloists.
It was a true delight, to watch Andy in action, directing the entire ensemble. Hearing that the ensemble was truly international and ecumenical in scope, added to the beauty of the experience.",1194739200,19,934,4.917721518987341

The story of how it was made is great too - part of its production was to encourage peace between Protestants and Catholics in Ireland - and it accomplishes this by bringing beautiful choirs of both faiths together to sing with great beauty the story of the Nativity. I highly recommend it.,1352851200,,364,4.447761194029851
