8136089,5,B000H30CFS,"Would buy this if there was a list of the 32 episodes. Quite pleased with the collections I've previously bought,2 Golden Age of TV collections.",1485216000,,144,4.8
8136090,3,B000H30CFS,"Good, but not great, shows.  Not really worth $40.",1460160000,,50,4.555555555555555
8136091,5,B000H30CFS,"These episodes are not the same as Dick Powell's, Zane Grey Theatre, which all have a western setting.  Four Star, is for the three actors and actress, alternating in appearance of the episodes. (Dick Powell, David Niven, Charles Boyer, and Ida Lupino.)  Featured, also, is an host of guest stars. We enjoy them very much, especially, those viewings of Dick's restaurant and nightclub, ""Dante's Inferno""...the dialogue is so humorous.  The quality of the the collection is very good.  I do not remember if any of them are in color.  ""Volume 1"" is printed on the cover of our case.  These thirty twp episodes are a taken from the four seasons, which premiered: Sept. 25, 1952, and last aired on July 16, 1956.  So, it truly is a ""Collection"" If there are any more volumes, we certainly will purchase them.",1426204800,4,804,4.741007194244604
8136092,3,B000H30CFS,"These were great shows, many with the superb Ida Lupino. Very few are available, so I was glad to find this set (I am reviewing a 2 disc 10 episode set from the same manufacturer with similar cover art&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Star-Playhouse/dp/B000H30CFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Star Playhouse</a>&nbsp;).

The problem is the Kineoscopes are horribly washed out; the picture is duller then the Critic's Choice series, which isn't all that great either. I was able  to make it watchable by turning the brightness almost all the way to zero & boosting the contrast (on a 480 I Sony crt, I don't want to know what it would look like on an unforgiving 2014 hi-def set!); but why didn't the manufacturer make the effort?

These fine shows deserve so much better. I'd love to see a similar set like Criterion's Golden Age Of Television.",1399852800,2,888,5.374100719424461
8136093,5,B000H30CFS,I was very young when Four Star Playhouse was on TV and my parents were more likely to watch Milton Berle or a variety show so these are real treasures for me!  The casting is incredible and the stories are memorable and enjoyable.  No worries about the content either if you are watching them with your children.  I keep looking for more of these to be released on DVD!  Start your collection now and you won't be sorry!,1355875200,5,421,4.358974358974359
