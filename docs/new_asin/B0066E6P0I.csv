8494026,5,B0066E6P0I,"Material very rare to Elizabeth Taylor, who did not come out in my country. Too bad there's not even in English subtitles, which would greatly facilitate the understanding of the dialogues, but the rarity of the material compensates, and therefore shows a transition between childhood and adulthood afase this great actress. Thank you very much.",1392681600,2,345,5.290909090909091
8494027,5,B0066E6P0I,"This is an exellent collection of movies. Even though they are in black and white, her younger years of acting was exellent. I really love the movie Rhapsody and it is in color but the rest are in B/W but they are wonderful to watch.",1374278400,4,233,4.2
8494028,5,B0066E6P0I,This set is boxed but with five separate movies in their own case so you don't have to turn anything over to see the next movie. This represents Liz in the early years and each movie is wonderful though her singing (not much) could use some work. Rhapsody is especially charming  for a large part of it is the music-without the music there would be no story.  Ms. Taylor is in love with a violinist who cares more about his craft than  anyone or anything. Each movie shows Ms Taylor's talent and it's easy to see why she became one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. If you are a Liz Taylor fan don't walk - run and buy this set-you won't be sorry. I won't describe each movie as it is written about in the 'product information' but you will soon remember the young and extremely beautiful  star who took our breath away for so many years.,1361318400,5,839,4.291139240506329
