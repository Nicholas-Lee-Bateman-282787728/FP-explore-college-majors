8661174,4,B00KSF7D5M,"I watched this film two times and liked it each time I watched it. It is a dark politico-social film about caste, religion, politics and womens'  issues. The story line centers around a village girl of low caste named Alka, (Kangana Ragut),  who is used by everyone for political and economic gain. Alka  is an Indian Annie Oakley of the hinder-lands aka  a village in India. She is  quick with the pistol, - feared by both men and women  She is complex: hard shell on the outside, but soft on the inside. She is love starved and castigated, because she is believed to be a barren woman (which is still a scandal in India). She is also a local politician and the tool of her Machiavellian uncle. She meets and falls in love with an unscrupulous actor. She gets pregnant by him; this complicates everything for everyone. Watch the film
The film is filled with violence, but is also darkly humorous and ultimately sad. 2014 saw the proliferation of Girl/Woman power movies in India. Kangana Ragut of Queen fame is the lead actress in this film and she does an excellent job of portraying Alka.  I personally liked the movie and will purchase it. I strongly recommend it to any Ragut fan.",1435104000,,1185,4.561320754716981
