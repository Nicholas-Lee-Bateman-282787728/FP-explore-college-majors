Good plot, good actors.
Don't expect a masterpiece, but I think you might be pleasantly surprised.
That's assuming you enjoy hard-boiled crime dramas.",1466035200,2,210,5.393939393939394
8221368,1,B000W6TFR6,"I never would have thought that I could be bored watching a movie about a pair of serial killers. Born Killers changed all that, as it is easily the worst serial killer film I've ever seen. Surprisingly enough, this film starts out pretty good and slowly descends into being unwatchable. John & Michael were left to learn about life from their father, a complete psychopath, so it's no surprise, that they turned out to be killers as well. John (Jake Muxworthy) is the quiet, good looking, methodical one, while his brother Michael (Gabriel Mann), is reckless, leaving John to clean up his mess. After we get the back story on the brothers, and see them in action, they go their separate ways, and the story focuses on John. Jake Muxworthy plays the quiet killer, who eventually meets up with a girl. He falls in love and tries to put his killer urges behind him to live the normal life. Muxworthy was the only reason this film got a rating at all. The film lacked the action I was hoping for and just turned into one conversation after another, but Muxworthy was as advertised, as this good looking, methodical killer, who not only plans things down to the last detail, but who also narrates the story. Born Killers wasn't bad in a way where the movie didn't make sense, the problem was how boring and slow moving it was. After the initial action, nothing really happens except for a lot of people doing a lot of talking, and if that's all I wanted to see, I'd just hang out at the mall.",1417910400,,1488,4.4944649446494465
8221369,4,B000W6TFR6,"I like the movie but I have seen it before under a different title ""Piggy Banks"". Young Lauren German was so pretty. (Even though I am still a great fan of German)",1378684800,,163,4.125
8221370,1,B000W6TFR6,"Born Killers is a fraudulent imitation. It tries to be a conciousless suspense in the vein of Natural Born Killers, but is lacking in a message or a sense of humor which is necessary to pull of this kind of movie. Its completely devoid of character development and plot. Lauren German is the only reason I give it one star. Her character had promiss but was probably left on the cutting room floor. There was just too much to swallow that made no sense. Incest? Why? I love the heartless, cold, break all taboos genre but this one fell short.",1340064000,,542,4.43
8221371,4,B000W6TFR6,"This movie is so often compate to, and accused as a rip off to Natural Born Killers. These are two complete diffeent novies, style of filiming, plot, everything. This one is deeper, and has far nore taboo style plot. Two brothers are raised by their Mom, while Dad, a total psychopath, floats in and out. He stays around after Mom dies, and galavants showing his sons ultimate sociopathic, lessons in life, and disappears again after sine years, Turns out they have a illigitamit sister, who has the same personaliy bu hides it far better. From there the twists come fast with an incetual relationship at the center of realistic seedy behavior.",1217548800,3,644,4.8108108108108105
8221372,4,B000W6TFR6,"Not bad at all - although not necessarily riveting, it does keep your interest.  Father, Brothers, Daughters UNITE in killing whatever your fancy!  A lovely and twisted ending - this will stay in the collection.",1203811200,6,211,5.0
