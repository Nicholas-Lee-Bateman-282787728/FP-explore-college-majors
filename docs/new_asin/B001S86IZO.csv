Joe Penny is great in almost everything he does.  The Fatman adds a little humor to the crime show.",1280275200,8,247,4.040816326530612
3784637,5,B001S86IZO,"If you love a great drama filled with lots of action, mingled with some wonderful light-hearted moments, set against the backdrop that is Hawaiian Paradise then you will love Jake and The Fatman, Series 2. Some haunting music, great guest stars and storylines that are engaging and often poignant, will lead you down a magical path that pays tribute to the skill of the police and law enforcement offices in Honolulu, the breathtaking beauty of the islands and their people and the charismatic performances of the stars. Highly recommended, highly valued and often watched. Love it.",1250726400,9,582,5.072916666666667
3784638,5,B001S86IZO,"This is a refreshing show. This season of the series is set in Hawaii, and shows great scenery. The first two hour premiere is about how both ended up in Hawaii from Los Angeles. I will be waiting for season 3 to come out.",1246147200,9,222,4.068181818181818

3784654,3,B001S86IZO,Liked season 1 and figured season 2 would be good too but it was moved to Hawaii and the characters changed dramatically so IMO it lost what I liked best about season 1  As season 2 progressed I disliked the subject content of some of the episodes,1433030400,,247,4.25531914893617
3784655,3,B001S86IZO,"This 1988-89 Season was when this drama about a tough-as-nails former police officer, now District Attorney Jason ""Fatman"" McCabe(William Conrad)and easy going private investigator Jake Styles(Joe Penny) from L.A. team up to solve some of the toughest cases in Hawaii who often butt heads, due to their difference in lifestyles.

JAKE & THE FATMAN ran on CBS from 1987-92 and takes me back to memory lane to when I was 15 years old and a Freshmen in high school when this show debuted on CBS in the Fall of 1987.",1421712000,,512,4.688888888888889

3784659,4,B001S86IZO,"I love this show. I used to watch it on the small screen as a kid and found myself enjoying it just as much now. It's weird to call it a classic - since I usually reserve that for Cannon, Barnaby Jones and the like, but I'm not sure how else to classify this fun detective series.

This was an abbreviated season, which took place in Hawaii. While it wasn't as good as the first season, it was still fun to watch.",1405209600,,413,4.036585365853658
3784660,4,B001S86IZO,"Entertaining if you are a fan of 80s and 90s action TV shows. Scenery is great plot lines decent, it can be a bit campy/dated if you do not buy into its style.  This is a short season though with only ten episodes, too bad the rest of the series has yet to be released on DVD. This season is filmed on location in Hawaii.",1401321600,2,321,3.9384615384615387

3784662,5,B001S86IZO,I was always a big fan of this series and it escapes me as to why the rest of the seasons are not available.  I know that it ran for more than two seasons! There were a total of 103 episodes made from 1988 to 1993....WHERE'S THE REST OF THEM?,1384214400,,242,3.84

3784674,5,B001S86IZO,"I was pleased with the prompt and courteous way my order was dispatched to me. I really appreciated how they shrink wrapped it so it would not be damaged in the mail. i put the tracking on it so i could view it as it was being shipped. i live in an apartment and all of our packages that won't fit in the mail box are taken to the office. i tracked it and asked for it the 19 th and  was told it was not there. well it was indeed there, she just had a lot of packages to sort through and didn't find it.",1382745600,,503,3.7452830188679247

3784677,5,B001S86IZO,takes you back to a fun time in television...I really enjoyed it It is especially good to see the setting now in Hawaii. Lots has changed since this show was filmed but it is just a great program....,1373068800,,199,4.2631578947368425
3784678,5,B001S86IZO,I love the prices on amazon overall. I wish this Jake and the Fatman had more episodes in it. I felt sort of shorted. But I enjoyed the shows.,1341273600,,142,3.9310344827586206

3784681,5,B001S86IZO,"Season 2 of Jake & the Fatman was great but there were only ten episodes, less than half as many as would normally be made. This was due to the 1988 writers strike, along with a union strike by workers in Hawaii, a sort of double-whammy. For this reason, I would definitely not pay top dollar for Season 2, great though it is.",1321315200,18,326,4.190476190476191

8339446,5,B001S86IZO,"""Jake, I wished you'd have been my son"": JL McCabe to Jake in the closing scenes of Season 2, Episode 5 after Daniel McCabe was being led away by 2 FBI Agents.

To me, Season 2 is what should have been Season 1 for Jake and the Fatman. While Season 1 was good, it was too predictable with Jake knowing who did the crime in the first 5 minutes. With the writers strike in 1988 all the fall episodes got a very late start. Season 2 of Jake and the Fatman had 11 episodes that all aired in the spring of 1989. The season opener was very powerful and in my opinion the kind of opening that should have been on Season 1. I am just glad that the writing got better. Clearly with Magnum's departure there was an opening to film in Hawaii. Both Joe (Jake) and William (JL McCabe) play off each other very well. Season 2 develops the characters better and we begin to see them as real people with real problems.

I am glad that the producers/writers found their footing and look forward to Season 3, and from the looks of it I'll have to buy the box set as it does not appear to be available as a complete season, that or wait for the show to air on one of the Classic TV channels.",1525824000,,1172,4.091304347826087
