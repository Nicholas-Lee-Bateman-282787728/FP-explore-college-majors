7925307,5,B00004WGA4,"Critiquing the plot of this movie is pointless,likewise the acting,writing,cinematography etc. It's just one great fight scene after another. All the extraneous elements,such as the aforementioned few, are boiled away,leaving the distilled, pure essence of martial arts movies. But a little known fact is that Chiba studied directly under MAS OYAMA, creator of kyokushinkai karate. This is one nasty art. It cultivates the spirit but also emphasizes raw destructive power. The teacher character in the movie is an homage to Oyama, a genuine Master in the world of martial arts. So, at least one of the characters is based on a real person. Pretty cool!",1156896000,3,652,5.219047619047619
7925308,4,B00004WGA4,"Arguably one of the best and most violent martial arts films of its time, 'The Street Fighter"" starring Sonny Chiba was the first film to be given a ""X"" rating because of its violent content. In a time when the majority of martial arts films were pretty much the same, ""Street Fighter"" featured some of the most violent images ever showcased in martial arts cinema. The movie stars Chiba as a ruthless assassin who as described by Christian Slater in True Romance, ""pretty much gets paid to f--k guys up"". This double-feature DVD not only includes the original uncut Sonny Chiba classic in its original widescreen format but also includes its first sequel. While it is light on special features, this is one of the best versions of either movie you can find on DVD. Not for the weak of heart.",1120953600,8,792,4.624113475177305
7925309,5,B00004WGA4,"Forget all the countless knock-offs and recycled versions that are out there, this is the version to pick up. Not only are both films presented in their original aspect ratio (Actionscope aka 2.35:1) but these are the uncut versions as well! Watch as Sonny Chiba gleefully gouges, pokes and tears into his enemies.
The plot is a bit hard to follow but who cares? So long as Chiba is on screen, grimacing, giving his best Clint Eastwood stare and beating the poop out of somebody.
STREET FIGHTER is arguably, Chiba's best movie to date and it is great to see it given such a glorious digital treatment. You can throw away your crappy pan and scam VHS copies for this bad boy.",1055894400,3,674,4.532786885245901
7925310,5,B00004WGA4,"This and THE EXECUTIONER are Sonny Chiba's best movies! The DVD from this company is the best version of The Street fighter 1&2 you will find,"" thanks Diamond Entertainment."" The sound is nice and loud and the movie is presented in Widescreen. Sonny is brutal and crazy in this film kicking double crossing mobster... All the classics should be this good and better, if not any extra features, at the least this good! Get this movie now! At this price its way, way better than some of the {bad} quality martial arts DVDs they've release! If you want to see Sonny now, check out THE STORMRIDERS.",1019779200,3,594,4.613207547169812
7925311,5,B00004WGA4,"The Streetfighter starts out with a relatively confusing encounter between what appears to be a prisoner and a priest (played by Chiba).  The action heats up faster than a leaky lighter.  Before we know it, Chiba has the sole of his foot (upside down no less) in the mouth of this outclassed opponent.  The movie ends in one of the great windy, rainy, pre-Lethal Weapon 2, showdowns.  Sonny Chiba fills the screen with intensity, purpose and keeps us at the edge of our seats.  Why didn't they get better looking babes and make it a full platter?",1013126400,,546,4.587628865979381
7925312,4,B00004WGA4,"I first heard of Sonny Chiba while watching the movie, True Romance, w/Christian Slater.  I then saw Streetfighter on some cable channel, but it was a poor version.  I took a chance on this DVD, and I was really suprised to find a very good version for such a low price.  The stories can get confusing, but essentially, it's a tale of revenge.  Sonny Chiba takes down all those who done him wrong, quite brutally.  Great martial arts action.  And besides, who watches martial arts movies for the stories?  And two movies for ten bucks?  Not a bad deal.",1000944000,,552,4.505050505050505
7925313,4,B00004WGA4,"What more could you say Sonny Chiba the original now on DVD, The film it self is poor but needless to say this is a original and belongs in any  martial art fans collection, The action is extremly retro but you will love  it if you are a fan, Movies like this are the original and should be  remembered, So buy it, whatch it and keep in mind this is where all your  Blades,Matrixes and Romeos must die came from.",966729600,,412,4.1125
