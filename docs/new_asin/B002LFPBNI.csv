This DVD will give you terrific knowledge to take to the counters and stores to make better decisions about your beauty products.  I learned that drugstore items are the same as department and salon products and have saved tons of money.  I used to be mesmerized by the fancy dept store products and promises - thinking if you spend more you get more; and the ladies behind the counter will certainly spout all sorts of false promises because that's what they're taught to say.  This taught me to not be concerned what a product states it can do, but to instead review the ingredients list.  Most of the fancy ingredients companies try to dazzle us with, like tourmaline in a face cream, or bamboo in a shampoo, do absolutely NOTHING for your face or hair.  Yet people flock to the stores for products with these latest buzzwords.  Paula's products are fabulous too.  I know it has only the ingredients needed, and none of that nonsense stuff like fragrance or color, etc.  I've given this DVD as a gift to all of my friends and they are still thanking me!  I've had friends tell me they used to shop ONLY at the dept store makeup counters, many because they thought the products were better if they paid more, or because they felt ""catered-to"".  Now they thank me, (well... Paula really), for saving them money and freeing them of the pull of fancy displays and buzzwords.  Thanks Paula!!",1280620800,11,1494,4.6311787072243344
