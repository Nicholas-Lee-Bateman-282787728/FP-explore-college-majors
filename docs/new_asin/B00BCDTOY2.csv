5577758,4,B00BCDTOY2,"I purchased this set of dvds for my daughter when she was three or four and she loved them. They are a bit outdated as far as clothing/hairstyle but they are still great for teaching kids ballet positions and the songs helped my daughter remember the complicated french names for positions, etc. My daughter is now 10 and a great ballerina, she recently passed these dvds on to another family with two little girls in hopes they would enjoy them.",1438387200,2,446,4.5875
5577759,4,B00BCDTOY2,"My 4.5 year old daughter loves this! She has watched it 3 times within a couple days of receiving it and follows the ballet moves on her own, etc. It would be nice if the teacher gave a friendly smile though. That's why I gave it a 4 not a 5.",1417219200,3,242,3.764705882352941
5577760,4,B00BCDTOY2,I have Fantasy Garden 1 and use it all the time for my classes. Bought this one as a backup.,1397001600,3,92,3.65
5577761,5,B00BCDTOY2,My 5 year old lives this DVD! She rented it from the library and did it every day for 2 months. After my maximum renewals I had to buy it! She still loves it and does it all the time.,1392422400,3,183,3.6
5577762,2,B00BCDTOY2,This video has all sorts of potential. But it's outdated and too locked in to be able to apply it to any classroom settings. It also didn't hold my daughters attention for just at home viewing.,1390176000,3,193,4.388888888888889
5577763,1,B00BCDTOY2,"We have a wonderful ballet video called Petit Feet that we love so much I was looking for more, so we tried this one, Ballet class for kids, and another called Baby ballet.  Unbelievably bad.  Horrible, 1980's home recorded quality, fuzzy, dark, hard to hear teacher, boring monotone, really bad singing man. This was downright creepy, my daughter screamed to turn it off.  Sent it right back.  Get Petit Feet instead.",1384214400,11,418,4.845070422535211
5577764,5,B00BCDTOY2,"This is a wonderful DVD for kids who love to dance even if they are not into ballet.  It is especially appealing because of the different use of nature - that is flowers, trees, animals. This makes it appealing and fun.  The instructer speaks clearly and is easy to follow.  My grand daughter started watching Garden 1 before she was 3 and trying to follow it before her arms could even reach over her head. It has been fun watching her improve in the motions and following the directions. It is a fun one to do with your child. Makes for good exercise.",1383609600,4,553,4.349514563106796

8565912,3,B00BCDTOY2,Best for 3-4 year olds.  A little older production.,1518825600,,51,4.666666666666667
8565913,5,B00BCDTOY2,i bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!,1505606400,,52,4.3
8565914,5,B00BCDTOY2,"i had many problems to see this dvd cause it'a region 1 dvd and that means that you can see it only in usa / canada (i live in italy). but the film is very good, my daughter loves it",1489104000,,182,3.575
8565915,5,B00BCDTOY2,"My 6 year old loves this dvd!  She learns all  the ballet steps right at home.  She likes that she can do it every day too, her ballet class was only once a week.  The music in it really helps her remember the names of the steps.  Our 4 year old son doesn't even see it and goes around singing the songs just because they are so cute catchy.  Not to mention mom and dad!  She has a cute nature name for each step that she enjoys as well.  Plie the poppy, chasse the chipmunk, it's adorable.

And to the person who rated this 1 star and suggested baby ballet...it's the same instructor.  Which is why we like them both :)",1480636800,,620,4.049586776859504
8565916,4,B00BCDTOY2,"The video quality is not great, but I like the DVD. I had this same video on VHS as a child and loved it, so I bought it for my own daughter. Nostalgia may play into my positive review, but I think this does a nice job of teaching basic ballet concepts. (Disclaimer: I'm not a dancer.)",1473811200,,285,4.017543859649122
8565917,5,B00BCDTOY2,"I had the first one on VHS when my daughters were little. My daughters went on to take ""real"" ballet when they were school-aged and A Fantasy Garden really had prepped them for their first day! Finding it all these years later, plus a second included class, on DVD was great. My preschool granddaughter and  toddler grandsons love it- and think it is so great that their mommies know the songs and moves, too!",1470700800,2,409,4.527027027027027
8565918,4,B00BCDTOY2,"my children enjoyed it (ages 5,4, and 3) . It is outdated, but it was like you were in the class room setting. we rented it from the library first to see if we liked it.",1441238400,,169,3.7222222222222223
8565919,5,B00BCDTOY2,My Grand-daughter who is 4 loves this dvd it is very easy to follow!,1439856000,,68,3.9285714285714284
