8089665,3,B000BNU2YA,"Fever Pitch is an okay Romantic Comedy. It suffers from being as formulaic and predictable as a batting lineup. It has some charm but no feverish chemistry. Ben and Lindsey have their ups and downs and ambivalence for each other. Ben is truly obsessed with his team, the Red Sox, and not only does he expect Lindsey to tolerate his obsession but also to participate in it. Lindsey is willing to accommodate for the sake of love, but rather unromantically, we never see Ben accommodate Lindsey. As Romantic Comedies go, this one isn't so romantic or so funny. I'm not even sure a Red Sox fan would like it.",1130284800,2,605,4.559633027522936
