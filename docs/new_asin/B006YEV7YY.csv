He even messes things up at times to show you how to fix it.  That, my friend, is one of the things that makes these videos so valuable.  I have dreamt of building a fun rod like he teaches about since I was a kid and I finally found the source that explains it in a way that has tipped me over the edge to actually doing it.  Thanks again, Fritz!",1519603200,,515,3.9038461538461537

8506427,5,B006YEV7YY,"Excellent video. Fritz might be called a disciple of Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth, and if you appreciate Roth's cars as I do or ever wished you could own a car with a bubble top you will really enjoy this DVD set. Fritz uses the same methods Roth did and he shows you everything you could possibly want to know. He isn't exaggerating when he says you could do this. He has a two car garage and tools and materials you could probably get for cheap any any good hardware store. The one thing he has you probably couldn't get is an understanding wife (not shown in the video).

The chassis he put together is probably not something you could make yourself unless you're a serious car guy. If I was doing this I'd get an old VW Beetle, take the body off, and that would be my chassis. He does describe how he put together his chassis, but the focus here is on the body.

The process of making the body is a LOT of work but Fritz looks like he's enjoying himself.

I saw Fritz's Roswell Rod at a car show in Rosemont, IL. It outclassed everything in the show.

Like the other reviewers I'll probably never try this. That in no way affected my enjoyment of this video. If you're thinking about whether you should buy this stop thinking and just buy it.",1408320000,,1237,4.251063829787234
8506428,5,B006YEV7YY,"One of the more enjoyable automotive DVDs Ive seen in a while.  Fritz makes things simple  indeed using everyday and familiar stuff, even rubbish, to make extraordinary and unique machinery seems to be a fascination with him I may never attempt to make a car-body, but this video has pretty much convinced me that I probably could  Once in a while I come away from a DVD and say that I got more than my moneys worth of information this is it.",1406246400,,442,4.365853658536586
8506429,5,B006YEV7YY,"I bought this dvd a while back and since then I've watched it a number of times. While not currently in a position to start building a custom car, this dvd is well worth watching even if you only have a passing interest. As someone who is experienced in the use of composite materials it was really great to see a more ""home shop"" approach to this subject, I think it makes the idea of building a car body more realistic and  more accessible to those thinking that they don't have the tools or experience to tackle something like this. This isn't what I would call a high dollar production, and you know I think that's perfect, had it been it wouldn't have had the same feel to it. The way it's put together you can see just what Fritz would do on any given day rather than what he would do if he was trying to impress you with production. I really enjoyed the dvd and I think if you have an interest in the subject I think you would to.",1395532800,,937,4.148351648351649
