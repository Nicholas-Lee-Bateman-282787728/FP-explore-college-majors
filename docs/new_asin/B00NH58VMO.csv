6656673,5,B00NH58VMO,I enjoyed this opera very much. It is a great addition to my growing collection of Pavarotti books and music,1426204800,,108,4.45
6656674,5,B00NH58VMO,"This Metropolitan live performance of Verdi's Rigoletto on 15 December 1981 by Luciano Pavarotti in his prime really has been buried for too long! It has been in bootleg sales for ages, and finally late last year Decca decides its time to formally release this live recording, after 33 long years!
In the Ponnelle film, the Rigoletto was Wixell and Gilda was Gruberova.  In this live performance, caught in Pav's absolute prime, we have similar fabulous period setting and costumes as in the Ponnelle film, with a young James Levine at the pit.
Pavarotti in his signature role is always such a joy to watch and hear.  He acts well, too, reminding the opera audiences that 'static stage presence' was only a trait in his final years on stage. Here he is charming and flamboyant as the Duke of Mantua, singing in a flexible and rich timbre with unyielding dramatic thrust and musical elan. No other Mantua ever came close to Pav., really.
In the title role, Louis Quilico gave a more than strong performance - he is both visually, vocally and dramatically 'the' Rigoletto.  Cynical in Act 1 and the last Act, Quilico is highly convincing as an insecure yet loving father.  His performance brings out the pathos and irony of the plot and strikes at the very heart of the work - the futility of revenge.
As his daughter, Christiane Eda-Pierre is a trifle too stentorian both physically and vocally, and one misses in many a while Edita Gruberova, the vulnerable Gilda in the Ponnelle film.  Eda-Pierre is very good in the final Act in male attire, and gives a marvelous quartet performance, one of the best ever.
The supporting cast is also excellent.  The production on the whole gives the audience a very good chance to see the MET at its finest. Just to recap, for the less internationally well known major performers, Sparafucile was sung by American bass Ara Berberian (1930-2005), who sang over 100 roles and for 1.5 decades at the Metropolitan, while Isola Jones, mezzo-soprano, who sang Maddalena, is also a MET regular.  Both singers gave outstanding and highly characterful portrayals.
Unreservedly recommended.",1420502400,31,2117,4.880222841225627

6656676,3,B00NH58VMO,"The performance is all I could have wanted it to be; Pavarotti at the height of his career.  Even the price from DEEP DISCOUNT DVD was wonderful.  When it arrived I gave it 5 star feedback.  Then I played it.
IT IS NOT ""BRAND NEW""!.  It stopped many times with caption "" Skipping Damaged Area""; always at a crucial musical point.  It is a shoddy bootleg copy or it is used.  Definitely not as described.
I contacted seller and they offered a refund but no replacement.  I want a BRAND NEW copy of this DVD.",1445731200,3,506,4.2631578947368425

6656680,1,B00NH58VMO,"not good, again takes liberties with Verdi's music",1435276800,,50,5.375
6656681,5,B00NH58VMO,This was a new opera for me so did not know any thing of the plot. I really enjoyed it the singing was terrific Rigoletto himself owned the stage and was great. Never heard of this singer before so will look for more of him.  Pavarotti was as always superb and his voice .... I have yet to see the other production and will try not to compare.  I purchased this one after reading reviews of it on Amazon so thank you to the opera buffs out there.,1432944000,2,446,4.056818181818182
6656682,5,B00NH58VMO,"Excellent cast; excellent performance. Although I always consider Rigoletto the baritone's opera despite the wonderful arias for the Tenor and Soprano, both of the latter were inspired and delightful...and Quilico did not disappoint. All three, as well as the shorter roles, were outstanding. And it was good to see Quilico get the final curtail and huge audience appreciation.",1432512000,5,377,5.517241379310345
6656683,4,B00NH58VMO,"How can you lose when L.P. is the Duke of Mantua or the King of France. The soprano needs top voice help. Maddelena was superb. All the rest quite good.
JV Reel",1427328000,,160,4.03125
6656684,5,B00NH58VMO,"What is there not to love? It is simply a gem that has remained ""hidden"" for far too long. Pavarotti couldn't be better and both his voice and his charm are at their most wonderful.
I greatly prefer Louis Quilico's jester to that of Ingwar Wixell's in the other Pavarotti ""Rigoletto"".
Yes, I also do have problems with Edna-Pierre. Not only does she seem remote but, maybe it is the videographer's fault, she looks as if she had her eyes permanently closed. However, she is a handsome woman.
In my humble opinion, simply a must for every Pavarotti fan.",1426204800,9,552,4.585858585858586

8678187,4,B00NH58VMO,"This is a traditional production, albeit, with the audio and video quality typical of the early 1980s. Despite that, its well done, for the most part.
 Im a big fan of Pavarotti but, in this part, at his then age, he did not provide a convincing, 20-something Duke of Mantua. The same can be said for Christiane Eda-Pierre, who, at the time of this performance, was 49~50 but looked substantially older and had a declining voice. She was way too old, to be playing the part of late-teens girl and Pavarotti too old, for the early twenties duke.
 Louis Quilico, on the other hand, not only made a perfect and convincing Rigoletteo but sang the role perfectly. The other players fit the bill acceptably.
 There aren't a lot of quality productions of Rigoletto out there. The best Ive seen, so far, is the Placido Domingo (Duke of Mantua), Cornel MacNeil (Rigoletto), Ileana Cotrubas (Gilda) production, from 1977. The worst, so far, is the Mets 2014/15 production, which moved the venue to Las Vegas and the time period to the early 1960s.
 This production is one I would keep, since it is better than average and is a traditional performance.",1511740800,,1141,4.71859296482412
