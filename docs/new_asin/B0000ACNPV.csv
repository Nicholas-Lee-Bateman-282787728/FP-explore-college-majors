""A Fan"" for example has written on 5 of Dr. Hovinds products saying the same thing and rating it two stars.

7996918,3,B0000ACNPV,"There are some small serious errors I

could pick on in here, since the all

wet 'Prophesy club was picking the

end of the world back in the '90's

and since I am a Preterist (though I

prefer the term 'Fulfilled Prophesy'

Christian), this tape is still not

100% acccurate in that realm. However,

the rest is basically as good as any

other Kent Hovind video done on the

subject and I certainly support Mr.

Hovind in his findings there!",1150848000,3,442,4.4
