3796396,5,B001U3YN90,"This was a great TV show. I never thought they would show something like this. A reality tv show base on gay men who love to play baseketball and are great is something. It was impressive. The only problem I had with it was how short it was, but other than that great. I saw it is worth its money and you'll be happy that you have brought it. It has action, the guys look hot, and it has the drama. It has its funny moments. So buy it!",1300579200,,435,3.898876404494382
3796397,3,B001U3YN90,"I, really enjoyed wahtcing this dvd tv series, i, just wish there was a season 2 and it made me wonder what the previous teams were like and who were some of the players. But, i also think that logo could have done a better job of showing more of what went on in the house, suchas personel interaction with each other and if they had friends that came over to visit them, how did that sit with the other players in the house, was there any jouslsy among the players any romance between them,it should have been not exzactly the same but, something like mtv real world or bet college hill, it proably should have been a hour long show which would have been 40 minutes without commurcials and more than 6 shows. The part that really disappointed me the most was that there no extras, deleted scense, no photo shoot and players introductions or commintaries, at the end, that for me is why you buy the dvd sets, is to see what was not included or didn't make it on tv, what was to hot or spicy to show on tv and there wasn't any nudity at all, just a tad in a shower scene. The show was jood and i enjoyed it and still watches it, but without the extras trimming on the dvd set that was extreamly dissapointing, i whould rate that part a big fat 0!!! I, would give the show a 5 star, but logo for me didn't show or expand it out enough for my taste.",1284768000,2,1346,4.1216730038022815

3796400,4,B001U3YN90,"Ok guys, It was a very interesting series, these guys went through so much, from coming back together after disbanding for 2 years, then reuniting to going to play for the championship in Chicago, one of the main characters I fell in love with from the begining because of his innocences was Mike, he was very attractive in body, soul and mind. One of the biggest issues was when Jamel (a flamboiant member) of the team but an excellent basketball player was reading his Bible and saying to the rest of them that being gay is a choice, of course as in any other gay group discussion on the topic the rest of the team was outrage, not angry at him for speaking his mind but they found it difficult to understand where he was coming from. This drama went on a bit through out the dvd but it was interesting because different gay guys confronted him about it even an Ex-Nba player that came out. I don't wanna spoil that for you just in case you are thinking about buying the dvd, the other big issue was that Mike wasn't out to his mother and he wanted to tell her but didn't know how to, BUT he did came out to her though and you have to see the end result on that road and what she said mind you he came out to her on his cell, he didn't want to but he did you should hear what she said. I was a bit thrown off with 2 things there are no bonus features which I felt would have helped you to get to know the team better because the interviews with them or whatever would have been great, and I was thrown off that there was no sexual tention on the team now I knew it was about the basketball, but guys living under one roof for all that time??? LoL I am playing but there was none but all in all it was a good buy for me because I loved seeing their challenges, from a modelling fund raiser to help them get enough money to go Chicago the bill was about $8300.00 to just getting along with each other it was a very emotional ride. I don't do spoilers I preffer you to see it for yourself but just so you know in the end Jamel got his head right after he spoke to one more guy, so if you love a good dramatic ride this is a good buy. The 1 star missing was for the bonus features I would have loved to see extra's. I also notice they have Season One ??? but it ended not on a question mark for a Season Two it seamed completed to me guess Logo is going to have to tell us what's up....Much Love Peeps Blessings.",1253232000,10,2410,4.022916666666666
