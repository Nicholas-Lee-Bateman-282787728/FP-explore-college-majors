6874459,3,B00QKS2DP6,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Focus""

1. For a movie that's supposed to be about focus, it sure doesn't have much.

2. The movie starts out promising - Will Smith plays Nicky, who leads a small group of con artists. Nicky meets a small-time wannabe named Jess, and he shows her how their world works.

3. What begins as a fun caper movie loses steam - and becomes predictable - as soon as Nicky and Jess start falling in love. Shortly after that (the football scene, to be specific), it comes completely off the rails. The movie gets increasingly ridiculous and unbelievable; by the end, I was laughing at all the wrong parts.

4. The movie itself doesn't suck. There are some nice scenes, good performances, and the camera work is great. The story sucks, though.

5. It's strange to see Will Smith play a dramatic and romantic leading man, but he pulls it off. His charisma carries the whole movie.

6. Jess is the only female character in the movie. She flip-flops between being a strong female and a sexist stereotype.

7. This movie has one of the longest and most pointless ""I'm tied to a chair while the bad guy makes speeches"" scenes I've watched in awhile.

8. This movie wants to keep you guessing who is on what side. But the story is so full of nonsense and holes that I stopped caring.

9. I know the movie's message is supposed to be how you can lose your focus and then find a new and better one. But the movie loses track of itself so completely that the message doesn't just get blurry, it disappears.",1425168000,62,1516,4.424460431654676
6874460,4,B00QKS2DP6,"Will Smith plays clever con men extremely well, so this is a perfect fit. Add his easy on-screen chemistry with Margot Robbie and we are treated to a colorful, action-filled R-rated (language and sexual situations) romance that keeps us scratching our heads even as we giggle with delight. We can see there is no safe place for a ""mark"" in a crowd and that conning is BIG business!

Co-writers and co-directors Glenn Ficara and John Requa (""I Love You Phillip Morris"") bring their goofy skills, clever cons and unexpected plot twists to keep us surprised and entertained.

We see:
  * Will Smith (""After Earth"") Nicky teaches the science of trust. We believe him even while KNOWING he's a con man, that's how good he is! He may have one weakness...
  * Margot Robbie (""The Wolf of Wall Street"") Gorgeous Jess is eager to copy the best. She learns how to pull her mark's focus from his watch or his wallet so she can lift it undetected.
  * Rodrigo Santoro (""I Love You Phillip Morris"") This wealthy (and handsome!) South American industrialist specializes in Formula 1 race cars. He has a lot riding on a newly developed fuel.
  * Robert Taylor (""Longmire"") Aussie McEwen wants to get his hands on that new fuel and will pay any price for it. This Australian actor has successfully portrayed an American lawman, Longmire, on TV for years; I've watched it and never suspected he wasn't American.
  * Gerald McRaney (""Longmire"") Ownes is a partner in that Formula 1 race car venture, but he has a suspicious nature....
  * BD Wong (""The Normal Heart"" and ""Law & Order, SVU"") Liyuan is a gleeful gambler. He will take a chance on ANYTHING!
  * Adrian Martinez (""American Hustle"") Farhad is our hero's unlikely but indispensable right-hand man.

As you see, all the pieces are in place for a romp through glamorous international surroundings, high-fashion clothes and witty repartee. There will be some physical violence and an unexpected gunshot; that's what makes it unpredictable and I LIKE unpredictable.",1425168000,,2004,4.847058823529411
6874461,3,B00QKS2DP6,"When an experienced con-artist, Nicky, is aided by a woman by his side, they go off to make huge profits. A few years later, the scenario is turned as Jess has gone on to go about her own plans while Nicky isn't sure how the whole thing is going to pull off. The film is directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who were the guys behind Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011). The film stars Will Smith and Margot Robbie.

Seeing the trailer over the past couple of months I wasn't sure what to expect by Focus because of how vague the plot was. Not a lot of information was given away from the trailer to make any conclusions. So after watching the film I have to say it was very entertaining to say the least. We follow Will Smith as a con man who enlists the help of a young woman to make off with huge amounts of cash. Nicky, practically has his own business in stealing peoples cash and belongings so that anywhere he goes theres a plan in place to hit it big. Will Smith was great in the role as Nicky cause of how slick and charming he can come off and also his chemistry with his co-star Margot Robbie as Jess. Robbie was just as good to watch because you liked her personality as someone who wants to understand the business and falls for Nicky in the process.

You never knew what to expect as the movie progresses; especially a scene where bets go wild at a football event. This was honestly my favorite scene out of the whole movie because you didn't realize what was going on until a certain moment that gives it away. The scene was shot brilliantly and got a reaction out of the audience. As great as the first half of the film was theres a mid-way point where revelations come out and the film slows down a bit. It wasn't necessarily a bad thing because your still entertained by both Smith and Robbie but the surprises from the first half sort of hinder the remainder of the movie because you knew what to expect from these characters. Once the tricks are revealed you aren't as surprised or amazed the next time around.

Another issue I had that comes straight off the trailer was when a guy runs his car into the vehicle with Jess and Nicky. In the movie theres a sequence where hes cruising around town doing his own thing. Then as the sun falls hes in the city and prepares to ram his car into the other one. I had to ask myself how did he manage to do it even if he was given information on their whereabouts. The whole scene doesnt make sense and wouldve been better if theyd made it a set up or a car chase. This along with other events in the movie are so far-fetched that you have to suspend disbelief on occasion. But overall your entertained by the performances by Smith and Robbie that you can overlook it and still have a good time.

The movie may have its pitfalls with conveniences and overly done antics but your taken away by the performances to get you through it. Theres a good time to be had here and will keep you hooked all the way till the end. If it weren't for Will Smith and Margot Robbies chemistry the movie wouldve fallen flat. Definite surprises to be had and works towards the films benefit.",1425081600,13,3126,4.275337837837838

6874506,5,B00QKS2DP6,"If you like Will Smith and Margot Robbie you'll like this movie. It's very quirky and fairly fast paced but does go back and reference things in strange ways at times if you aren't paying attention. Hence the name of the movie, Focus... It's become one of my go-to movies to put on when I'm tired or just need a distraction due to the amount of times I've watched it. The movie follows the pair in their love/hate relationship with each other while taking you through their world of con-artists. If you aren't going to sit down and really watch the movie the first (or first couple of) times you watch it you'll most likely end up feeling frustrated and confused. The movie alternates showing you the events taking place through one of their views then goes back and shows you how the other one was seeing the situation unfold and their part in it. It isn't an overly complicated plot but it does require your attention, or your focus. If you're someone who tends to figure out where movies are going before they get there, you'll have no problem with the movie. Will Smith is funny and charming in a strange ""what is he actually up to?"" way. If you aren't familiar with Margot Robbie this is a good movie to start with. She is an Australian former soap-star actress. She has proven in the last few years to be an extremely talented woman starring in movies like The Wolf of Wolf Street and the live-action Tarzan movie. She's beautiful, charming, athletic, funny, and doesn't take herself to serious. This is the 1st of 2 movies the pair have done together. The other movie is Suicide Squad which came out in the summer of 2016. They have great chemistry and do manage to be relatable to a wide range of audiences. I would suggest this movie 100%",1500336000,,1747,4.49685534591195

The Super Bowl betting scene alone will have you screaming at the screen. Total insanity. Plenty of twists throughout as well.

6874700,3,B00QKS2DP6,"If there is one thing that this dark comedy thriller Focus delivered to its viewers,it is the presence of its charming lead stars in Will Smith and Margot Robbie. Without these stars,the film would have fallen flat especially on the latter part wherein the story was unbearable especially when the Will Smith character Nicky ""Mellow"" Spurgeon simply into a bad guy who use anyone for his con acts.

The first act at New Orleans was good enough. But the it fall somewhat flat in the second act in Buenos Aires. Too bad that the film basically had to mainly rely on the charms of Smith and Robbie to become bearable. Sad but true.

Back in the day, '72, wrote a review for a college class.  Score a D-, never knew where this instructor was comming from.  He, having connections to Hitchcock, in his words.  Over time i found the grade was 180/-180 off.
This flick has twists and turns, similar to the grade. Suspense and intrigue.  Each of the prime charachters play their part, to make their role believable.  I'm a guy and hate chick flicks, 'cuase I'm tough and show no emotion.  Loved this, only watch when I'm alone.  I can identify with the girl.
BTW, the instructor failed one paper saying, unequivocally theater is not reality and viewers can not identify with characters. He was right, this is not a flick for childeren, but where you are in life, you may identify with one of these charachters.  This is entertainment, emotions and feelings, will make you think and realize life is more.

6874814,5,B00QKS2DP6,"Bottom Line: A love letter to love stories thinly disguised as a heist movie. Four and a half stars.

It is criminal the way this movie was poorly sold and then maligned. Focus is a beautifully directed love story about a couple (of criminals) with acute trust issues and incredibly engaging chemistry. It is not a typical heist movie in any way. It is almost a slice of life story -if life was much more interesting. It is understandable that people expecting Ocean's Fourteen were disappointed. It is not understandable that some critics describe a movie that doesn't exist.

There are twists in Focus but they are not hard to follow. If you are paying close attention you will realize you were told everything important from the beginning. Will Smith's hard earned gravitas and natural charm and Margot Robbie's enthusiasm and honesty make them a heady screen combination. Their characters remain likable even when they are not being nice to each other because it is obvious that they are in love and in the end...well, you'll see. B.D. Wong may be the best con in the movie since the actor steals the part of the film he is in as the thrill seeking gambling addict Liyuan and Adrian Martinez is hilarious as Nicky's best friend and resident walking talking id Farhad.

Focus will make you feel good about your relationship because at your worst you and your significant other are not as bad as Nicky and Jess and at your best, you kind of are. Recommended.",1444780800,,1460,4.6953125

I was incredibly disappointed! I will admit however that I did get to see Will Smith topless which was a thrill and why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2. Lol. The acting was okay.. Will Smith is a far better actor then what he gave in this movie, but honestly I don't think it was his fault, I think that it was the directors. The main actress, sorry I can't think of her name right now, is fabulous! I was thrilled to pieces with her work in this movie.

Unfortunately, when I saw the trailer on my way to the United State, it doesnt have a lot of information and details that explain what is going on in the film. I decide to watch it completely. The movie is comedy and romance, talking about deception and steeling. Will Smith who as the guy want to help a young women Margot Robbie by huge money. Robbie was a good learner who watch to understand what is going around, I mean that surprises that was happening by smith in the football event. In my opinion,the movie shows many ideas that excite me. Also, the movies time was not very long to get boring, or try to change it, less than two hours. Smith had the big role in the film, and he had completely the ability to steal the audience attention. In addition, Robbie did well, and tried to assist Smith to prevent more money losing. I give this one 5 stars, it really nice. I hope Will keep going in this level of histrionics and show us the wonderful results.",1441065600,,1071,4.333333333333333

6875135,3,B00QKS2DP6,"Lots of movies keep you guessing and confused until the Big Reveal that explains everything you've been scratching your head over. Focus does that three times. I imagine the writers thought they were being triply clever, but I found it frustrating and off-putting to be kept in the dark through so much of it. It starts off with a very good first act that has you guessing until the slam-bang Reveal. Then it switches gears, time frames and locations, and it's like you're watching an entirely different movie, only with some of the same characters. They explain it all in the end -- kind of ridiculously, with gigantically implausible coincidences, and all depending on a love story that's never really developed or emotionally believable. By then it was too late for me, they had lost me somewhere back in the confusing midsection. The acting and all that are fine. Really liked that first act, and would have much preferred a movie that kept that story going, rather than trying to tell two others and have them all twist around one another in a failed post-Tarantino way.",1439683200,2,1075,4.78494623655914

The whole premise of the movie is pretty stupid and very coincidental that all of things that Will Smith (Nicky) is able to do the things he does.  Basically he runs a huge underground theft operation that somehow no law enforcement agency pays any attention to.  Nicky teaches Margot Robbie (Jess) the ropes and how to become a good con artist.  Some of the techniques that are used are believable but there is one part of the movie where they constantly show a certain number to a guy in order to make him later guess that number for Nicky to win a bet.  The whole idea of it was really stupid and unbelievable.  Overall the movie was very boring, a lot of meaningless dialogue with no real reason to care about any of the characters.

On a story level, it's really, really bad, a structural mess, and a con movie without any cons in it. You stay engaged because you are expecting twists or escalation, but it never comes. The only ""twists"" are so telegraphed that you'll feel insulted that the makers thought the audience was this dense. Will Smith is pretty good, as usual, always on the cusp of great, but modulating to broadly from Smooth Criminal to Emotionally Distraught Good Guy. Margot Robbie is very good, but the script has absolutely nothing for her to do. Indeed, she had more character development in the TRAILER than she does in the actual movie. You won't have the worst time ever watching these two play off each other, but when it's done you'll probably go ""....wait, WHAT?

He's abandoned all regard for good cinema in pursuit of his need to be cool.

If it was to fool the girl then that makes sense up to the point where she went outside onto the balcony at which point Will Smith's character could have shifted the conversation.

6875540,3,B00QKS2DP6,"Theres no question this movie looks the business.  Will Smith is in cool-mode and Margot Robbie oozes sex appeal while her acting chops ensure her character has credibility.  She plays a would be con lady who ends up being the protg of Smith.  There is believable spark between the two, however this being a movie about cons, the plot starts to take various turns as you are left guessing who might be conning who and what the big picture actually is.
The movie really gets the chemistry, the style, the locations just right.  There is a heightened reality to the cinematography which puts an appropriate amount of gloss considering the topic.  Given that the con / caper movie has been a well trodden cinematic path, there are also some interesting ideas here and characters with enough back story to be not entirely one dimensional.  In fact some moments do indeed do a great job of building tension as you wonder how a scene will play out, such as the football game betting scene.  However, a lot of fuss is made in the movie about trust.  And this is where the movie lets the viewer down.. at some point the plot becomes so tricksy that you ultimately stop really investing in the characters.. you lose trust that the movie will have an ending with any integrity.  Ultimately, the ending does deliver its own surprises and ends ambiguously enough for some interpretation, but the movie lacks the real chutzpah to deliver that knock down moment that will put the required grin on your face.
Great stars acting their socks off in plush cinematography makes this fun enough, but tricksiness isn't cleverness, and there is a rather hollow feeling by the end of the movie that despite some clever tension filled moments, you may leave unsatisfied.  If anything what the movie lacked is what the title led you to expect.",1436572800,4,1818,4.7066246056782335

It was a bit of a stretch-I feel as if it could of been done as an after school special and been done in 45 min or less. There were to many dry parts and the writer could of clued in the audience a bit more, like before the final scam. It would of been more interesting and believable not to mention more fun to watch as it played out. Instead it left us in the dark and leaving the theater going really that's it; what???? So I am disappointed with this one for shure--without Will Smith this movie would of fallen apart at the beginning.

6875632,3,B00QKS2DP6,"Focus is a thriller/plot-twisty movie that attempts to tell the story of some high profile criminals starring Will Smith.  Despite the high powered cast, excellent cinematography, and interesting characters the movie itself seems to be a love story that is more forced and awkward than anything else.

Will Smith plays Nicky Spurgeon and he gets involved with the beautiful Jess Barrett (Margot Robbie) after she attempts to play the old-time ""my husband"" is here game on him.  It turns out that Nicky is a leader of a full time, super famous ring of pick-pockets and thieves.  Jess joins his crew in New Orleans to work the tourists coming in for the Super Bowl.  The crew of thieves is not the loveable bunch of eccentrics from a Dickens novel, instead they appeared to this viewer as the demographic make-up of a group of US Department of Defense Civil Servants who can efficiently arrange a mid-air refueling, a targeting worksheet, and an intel upload for a Drone Strike in Yemen within the confines of a civil service day with coffee breaks included.  In real life, one suspects such an operation would be run by gypsies or some tribe of related people with a long cultural history of rip-offs.  The WASP/African-American crew can't do that unless they are in a massive army seizing an oilfield before the cameras of Fox, CNN and other 24 Hour News Folks.

Additionally, the love story is extremely forced.  A woman as attractive as Jess Barrett would very likely not be involved in high risk crime, but instead would already have a sugar daddy.  The goo-goo eyes and piney emotions of the woman towards Nicky is very forced.  Additionally, it is more likely such a woman would be a femme fatale and would eventually cheat Nicky and crew.  Hollywood's obsession with paring white women with black men over-rides how the world really works.  Finally, the twists and turns are too much. The story has plot twists for the sake of plot twists, there is no over-arching exploration of the condition of man in this film.

It is an OK movie, but not worth going to the theater for.",1436313600,3,2080,4.741666666666666

6875639,4,B00QKS2DP6,"When this one was released in the cinema it received a real mixed-bag of reviews from the critics, however watching a
trailer encouraged me to give it a go.
'Nicky' (Will Smith) a smooth-operator in the misleading business first meets 'Jess' (Margot Robbie) at a restaurant, she'd
singled him out as a 'mark' however there is no-fooling a professional con-man of his calibre.
'Nicky' offers to show her the ropes within his team, all goes well she learns quickly.......
After spending some considerable time together professionally and indeed socially 'Nicky' realizes 'Jess' wants a deeper
relationship than he's prepared to offer which leads to a parting of the ways.
Three years have past, 'Nicky' has a high-profile operation in progress on the race-car circuit in 'Buenos Aires' plans are
afoot, when, he clocks 'Jess' coming down the stairway, it throws him off his stride, he'll have to have a re-think to get
the op' back on track, but her very presence appears to be a distraction, he has to re-focus to complete the scam he's
planned.......but the people he's trying to play are dangerous.....
'Will Smith' is on-form in this one as a slick con-man......with a hint of romance always on the cards the film though maybe
not the fastest moving plot does have it's moments and should give you a smile or two along the way.....certainly worthy
of a viewing.
Frequent use of strong language along with scenes of an adult nature (nothing too strong)

6875670,3,B00QKS2DP6,"I was hoping for something strong from Will Smith after his lackluster After Earth.  This movie has some elements of an Ocean 11, art of the con type movie but really lacks originally in its storyline.  It has some promise in the beginning but really quickly gets predictable and lacking in its plotline.  The story quickly devolves into movie that you keep waiting for something unexpected to happen but it never really does.  Or it was something you saw coming from the beginning of the movie. Smith is ok in his role but it isn't his best performance and I had hoped for something more, but in reality it wasn't his acting that suffered in this movie, the lackluster storyline and plotholes that made this movie what it was.  It is not a terrible movie and is watchable and I am happy it is not After Earth 2.

I think this movie captured our attention the entire time and had us at the edge of our seats many times. Love this dynamic and subtle plot twists especially. Great movie.

He's got the focus to pull off the job, and he runs his organization like any good corporate executive might.  But despite concentrating on their work, there's a spark between the principals.  Can two con artists fall in love?  A relationship requires the mutual trust that con artists don't have.  So, it's tough slogging for the ever-cool Will Smith and his apprentice in crime Margot Robbie, especially since attention to each other could make them lose their focus on their work.  The key is patience, time, and, oh yes, getting to know the extended family.  It turns out that con artists face the same struggles juggling work and relationship as the rest of us.",1435622400,,761,4.712121212121212

6875855,2,B00QKS2DP6,"I have been trying to figure out what, exactly, makes this movie so bad.  It's a great premise, and it could have been compelling.  This movie doesn't know if it's  comedy or a drama and doesn't do either of them well.  Will Smith and Gerald McRaney do their best to rise above the dialogue and action.  Beautiful ingenue Margot Robbie starts off believable enough and then completely falls apart in the ""dramatic"" scenes sounding like a wooden valley doll in what should be the highest tension in the film.

The script is exacerbating - there seems to be no through-line intention or connective tissue, and, as another reviewer noted, speeches seem to come at the oddest of times (like the middle of what feels like it should be an action scene.).  And despite all the wrongly placed speeches, the story is still confusing and forced - particularly the characters' motivations.

I am a huge fan of Will Smith - but this movie feels like a series of collectively bad decisions.",1435190400,,977,4.705882352941177

Fine performances, a light subtle, and believable script, and my oh my the lusciousness of the sets and the elan' made me feel as if I were in the jet set....Have to say they will have to search harder to come up with a female ingenue up to snuff to dance with Will Smith....she's good but let's face it not good enough....But this may be a problem for him for now on...unless Scarlett Johannsen comes available...

Robbie is portrayed in a Pollyanna type of way, smart but not too smart. Her makeup and lighting sow her beauty and she is always smiling

DISCLAIMER: I love Will Smith in ways that are forbidden in many cultures and I missed him on the big screen. Bought this movie without even looking at the trailer and didn't care about the reviews.

I really should have cared about the reviews.

I did not love this movie and only got through half of it as it was too stupid to continue. The only good news is that Will/Margot acted well with the material they had but the writing, the story - its implausibility, the pacing, ugh - it was like scratching a chalkboard.

I still love Will, Margot is pretty awesome too, but no. No. And No.",1434412800,,631,4.367521367521367

What most distinguishes this movie from all the other movies about con men is that the script for this one is so much worse. Will Smith sleeps through lines that were poorly written to begin with.

The first star is because Amazon won't let you give 0, and the second star is because the film is beautiful at times, including whenever Margot Robbie (who is actually pretty good in this) is on the screen.",1434412800,,511,4.494623655913978

6876118,5,B00QKS2DP6,"Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (I Love You Phillip Morris and Bad Santa) team again for a smartly written, ell realized plot of the game of con and pull this star-studded cast into their party to provide a fast paced and satisfying movie.

Nicky Spurgeon (Will Smith) is an extremely accomplished con man who takes an amateur con artist, Jess (Margot Robbie), under his wing. Nicky and Jess become romantically involved, and with Nicky's profession of being a liar and a cheater for a living, he realizes that deception and love are things that don't go together. They split, only to see each other three years later... And things get messy. In the midst of his latest scheme, a woman from his past - now an accomplished femme fatale - shows up and throws his plans for a loop. Adding to the con-like shenanigans are Adrian Martinez as the hilarious and very talented Farhad, Nickys accomplice, Gerald McRaney as the nemesis with a surprise at the end, BD Wong as a gambler how seems to beat Nicky at his game, Brennan Brown, Robert Taylor, and Rodrigo Santoro as the Argentine Garriga who carries the key to millions.

The dialogue is snappy, surprising with twists and turns at every corner, keeps the audience guessing as though we are the ones being conned, and is but one aspect of a very well acted well directed and played film. One of the best Con Game films made! Grady Harp, June 15",1433894400,,1390,4.600806451612903

Just my rating and opinion about the movie and performances.  I having been waiting for Will Smith to truly come back.  And i believe he is back.  He puts on his swagger, and does a fantastic job showing a wide range of conflict and emotions.  As did Margot Robbie.  In which they had fantastic chemistry.

Will Smith puts real effort into this character, its not a lame or stereotypical acting job.  This is a first rate performance, the kind that made Smith a household name.  Roll with it or resist, this film takes you in and lets you experience the art of con.

First, I need to see this again to try and catch the various thefts of this movie. The storyline was much better than expected and the acting was up to par to carry it out. There is an excitement in this movie from start to finish that will keep your attention. It is sort of magical like ""Now You See Me"" which I feel was one of the best movies made in 2013. There is an attraction to both leading characters that makes you interested in their life stories. I don't give spoiler alerts, but the ending was different than I expected and it left me wanting more. The film provides a little something for most audiences, suspense, action, romance, and comedy. This is not a family movie, unless you are teaching your adolescent children how to steal but it  is an educational movie for all adults.

I'm also a huge Margot Robbie fan, I think she does a great job with her characters, and I look forward to seeing her as Harley Quinn in the Suicide Squad movie.

6876285,1,B00QKS2DP6,"In this film we have Will Smith (one of the most unbearable actors working today, he's impossibly smug in this) as a kind of criminal mastermind, a sort of CEO of an underworld company, always ahead of what others are thinking. He takes as an intern the blonde bombshell Jess (Margot Robbie, from the Wolf of Wall Street, playing again a groupie of a criminal). The movie's running joke is that the Smith character always ends up fooling her.

In general, I don't like very much movies about criminals, since I don't find criminality to be very amusing. This movie, however, is too silly, too stupid, the absurd plot twists too ridiculous to offend. But it is really a waste of time to spend two hours of your life seeing this. And the movie is infused in a lot of what I find about US young urban contemporary culture to be abhorrent.

The last part of the movie was filmed in my hometown, Buenos Aires (gratuitously so, since it involves a con operation involving a Formula 1 race, which hasn't been set here for many years), but even that part I didn't find to be terribly interesting, as it's all shown with a tourist lens.

The only good scene in the movie here has Smith playing a game of escalating bets with a Chinese businessman (BD Wong).",1433289600,2,1248,4.488986784140969

I kept thinking that perhaps Margot Robbie's character was trying to scam Will Smith's character ( I watched it only yesterday, but have forgotten the names) out of his business. There wasn't that much chemistry and the age difference between both actors was apparent, especially when Margot spoke in a high pitched voice. I kept hoping that after they met up the whole thing was would be a ruse to trick Will Smith's character and get payback after being abandoned in Phoenix. This wasn't so and I just wasn't really satisfied with the ending,  either. Ultimately, this is a pretty forgettable movie.

Into movies with a poor production",1431561600,,75,4.428571428571429
6876365,2,B00QKS2DP6,"The writing and directing team responsible for the cult hit Bad Santa (which they wrote but didn't direct), the underrated I Love You Phillip Morris (Jim Carry's funniest movie in ages but it was considered too gay for a wide theatrical release) and the critically adored flop Crazy, Stupid, Love (which they directed but didn't write) try their hand at the con artist genre with disappointingly uneven results.

Will Smith plays Nicky, a veteran con-man who takes the beautiful Jess (Margot Robbie) who is enthusiastic but inexperienced under his wing, teaching her the essential tricks of the trade.  The sequence where Jess and some of Nicky's associates wander through a Mardis Gras crowd stealing watches and wallets and passing them from person to person without ever pausing or breaking step is beautifully staged and reminded me of the pick-pocket contest in Johnnie To's Sparrow, although a more well-rounded cinephile than me might cite Ernst Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise instead.

Nicky and his team bring in a huge haul from working the Mardis Gras crowds but after the holiday is over they all go their separate ways, which is a shock for Jess who was falling in love with Nicky and thought he felt the same.  Nicky gives Jess her generous cut of the proceedings and tells her to get lost.

Then the movie jumps forward several years.  Nicky is pulling a huge con involving professional race cars and Jess turns up next to a wealthy racer who is either Nicky's new boss or his latest mark--Focus likes to pull the rug out from under the viewer, or at least try, so there are numerous twists most of which aren't very believable even for the con-artist genre.  Nicky and Jess rekindle their romance but it's not clear if either is sincere or if they are playing each other.  Unfortunately it also doesn't matter since Will Smith and Margot Robbie have zero romantic chemistry.

The casting of Will Smith, which likely seemed like a coup to the makers of this mid-budget (50 million dollars) production turns out to be a handicap.  Will Smith's bread and butter is playing variations on the same cocky persona over and over.  After the high profile flop After Earth Will Smith is clearly attempting a re-brand with Focus but it doesn't work.  Smith is fine in the early scenes where he gets to strut like a peacock and be the smartest person on the screen.  In the second half, however, Smith is required to do acting that is quiet and introspective but that seems to be outside of his abilities.  Will Smith isn't an actor he's a movie star and he needs dialogue or action to function onscreen--trying to express unspoken emotions just shows how limited Will Smith's range is.

Margot Robbie at least ends up making a strong impression.  Focus has an abundance of twists but the tone of fizzy fun during the New Orleans scenes is lost in the second half when Focus turns into a gorgeous looking drag--the clothes and the settings are like watching an expensive perfume commercial or fashion magazine layout brought to life but the tone becomes mired in a weary melancholia that really makes you miss the film's breezy early scenes.

Focus saves its most ludicrous twists for last but by that time I was just glad for it to be over.  Focus made me long for the more consistent, audience pleasing pleasures of The Sting or even David Mamet's more cynical House of Games.  Focus is a disappointing addition to the con artist genre that will be quickly forgotten.",1431475200,8,3473,4.758333333333334

UPDATE: Re-watched this film in the background while working, and was soo distracted by the sound that I had to update this review! The main problem with this flick is the audio.

The overall sound isn't robust, and the soundtrack sucks from the opening scene. It's not like poor sound quality, it just sounds cheap ... and the music selection is totally disjointed and doesn't match what would otherwise be a smart grifter flick.

As long as you adjust your expectations for the audio and try to ignore the soundtrack you should be able to enjoy. LOL",1431388800,,904,4.745222929936306

Will Smith is every bit as slick at James Coburn.  I mean really?  Ryan Gosling? He is the polar opposite of slick--he is creepy, and you can never be a creepy conman and expect to eat.

while this wasn't a great movie, it is worth more than one viewing, so I feel that the fee for the digital download was more than fair.  A few bucks more than the rental?  Buy it if you like heist flicks.  It isn't the best one, but this should hold its place in the top thirty or so of the all time heist flicks.",1431388800,,696,3.964028776978417

This movie is incredible! I saw it at the Cinerama Dome in Downtown Hollywood and it was a surreal experience.

First off, the cinematography in this movie is gorgeous, everything just pops out at you. The colors, the sharpness, the locations are absolutely dead drop gorgeous.

The sound is also really amazing as well. There is a scene where Will Smith's character has a dialogue near a Formula 1 race track and hearing the F1 cars swoop by and interrupt is a sound design class all by itself.

This movie is very ""European"" in it's story telling approach, in that it doesn't follow a conventional three act structure and while that might bother some people, I think it is very bold for a mainstream American movie.

The soundtrack is also very eclectic, chill-out and straight up sexy. ""I'm a Manchild"" for example kind of sums off the whole feel of this movie.

I know there will be naysayers who won't get it and maybe some of you think I'm exaggerating, but trust me you will do yourself a disservice to not watch this movie because of what other people say about it.

Make up your own mind by watching yourself.

Jess quickly learns the tricks of the trade, but when Nicky gets attracted to her romantically, things start to get complicated.

Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (I Love You Phillip Morris Crazy, Stupid, Love), Focus features two contrasting con artists whose relationship starts as a master and protg. There are interesting pickpocket scenes (designed by Apollo Robbins), one of the highlights of the film.

Unfortunately Focus slowly loses its momentum, as the film fails to offer something that would make us invest in the characters. Will Smith and Margot Robbie are appealing, but despite their fine performances and the slick direction, Focus remains emotionally remote, with a romantic story that is a bit shallow, and a heist story that is just unbelievable.",1430524800,,929,5.145695364238411

Overall, if you like movies like the Oceans series or Now You See Me check this one out as well. I really liked this a lot. I give this an A-.",1429833600,2,1103,4.2075471698113205
6876372,3,B00QKS2DP6,"Will Smith has a modestly successful return to a character he's best playing. A smart, wise-cracking charmer. Here he plays Nicky, a high-rolling con artist. As a potential victim of a con himself, he meets Jess (Margot Robbie, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") who has set him up as a mark at his hotel. Nicky calls her bluff when the time comes and eventually gives her a job working for him.

This initial ""trust"" issue comes into play for the next 100 minutes or so, taking the audience on a roller coaster ride trying to guess what's real and what isn't. So, depending on what you're looking for in a movie, you can either just run with the various scams or try to calculate what the next play is. The biggest problem with the film is that the various scams border on absurd. I take that back, they are absurd. I can't give out much in detail without providing spoilers but in one case, Nicky, known to bet high amounts of cash on the horses or cards, gets into a betting game with a high roller at the Super Bowl. It's never called the Super Bowl of course, but the big game is in New Orleans. They make several crazy bets like, will the next play be a run or a pass. It gets to the point of picking out a jersey number. But instead of just providing a number, the better goes to the window with binoculars and scans the sidelines. Why would he do that?

Smith and Robbie get it on of course, and yes the chemistry is good. Robbie, is a gorgeous woman but this girl can also act as she proved a couple years ago in ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" The film, directed and written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") has some great locals (Buenos Aires, Las Vegas, New York City) to shoot in and they look great on the big screen. The final act involving big time Formula 1 racing is a head scratcher that makes no sense but creates a big reveal (yawn). The film does have its moments and Ms. Robbie can't be ignored.

6876374,4,B00QKS2DP6,"Will Smith plays clever con men extremely well, so this is a perfect fit.

We can see there is no safe place for a ""mark"" in a crowd and that conning is BIG business!

Co-writers and co-directors Glenn Ficara and John Requa (""I Love You Phillip Morris"") bring their goofy skills, clever cons and unexpected plot twists to keep us surprised and entertained.

We see:
  * Will Smith (""After Earth"") Nicky teaches the science of trust. We believe him even while KNOWING he's a con man, that's how good he is! He may have one weakness...
  * Margot Robbie (""The Wolf of Wall Street"") Gorgeous Jess is eager to copy the best. She learns how to pull her mark's focus from his watch or his wallet so she can lift it undetected.
  * Rodrigo Santoro (""I Love You Phillip Morris"") This wealthy (and handsome!) South American industrialist specializes in Formula 1 race cars. He has a lot riding on a newly developed fuel.
  * Robert Taylor (""Longmire"") Aussie McEwen wants to get his hands on that new fuel and will pay any price for it. This Australian actor has successfully portrayed an American lawman, Longmire, on TV for years; I've watched it and never suspected he wasn't American.
  * Gerald McRaney (""Longmire"") Ownes is a partner in that Formula 1 race car venture, but he has a suspicious nature....
  * BD Wong (""The Normal Heart"" and ""Law & Order, SVU"") Liyuan is a gleeful gambler. He will take a chance on ANYTHING!
  * Adrian Martinez (""American Hustle"") Farhad is our hero's unlikely but indispensable right-hand man.

As you see, all the pieces are in place for a romp through glamorous international surroundings, high-fashion clothes and witty repartee. There will be some physical violence and an unexpected gunshot; that's what makes it unpredictable and I LIKE unpredictable.",1427587200,,2004,4.847058823529411

On the phony side, nothing could top the football scene which is miles beyond belief. The tricky ending is another far fetched one also.

Excepting a good performance by both Smith and Robbie, the film is totally boring. The script is not interesting and mostly unbelievable because of its mindless twists and turns. At this point, one may think twists and turns make the film exciting. Well, too bad: no, the film remains as dry and uninteresting as ever. If you are a fan of good movies, pass this up.

6876378,4,B00QKS2DP6,"The best heist movies are very rarely about the score itself. The worst ones spend too much time on it; coming up with a clever crime, making it complicated enough to cause friction amongst the cons, and delivering enough twists to keep the audience in the dark. It's a chore, and most movies simply can't pull off it off. Writers/directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who last directed the rom-com Crazy Stupid Love, have figured where the strengths in Focus lie. The aces up Focus' sleeve are gorgeous stars Will Smith and Margot Robbie, who are so distractingly good they could pick our pockets blind.

Smith, who has been in idling in a junk heap the last couple of years, finally opens up and lets himself be cool again. To say it's a relief to see him have fun in something not titled Men in Black is an understatement. He plays Nicky Spurgeon, a Yoda of the con man game so slick he could sell ice to an Eskimo. He could steal the shoes right off your feet, and convince you barefoot is in style. He's the best, and isn't afraid to let himself be the mark for a novice grifter named Jess (Robbie), a stunner looking for an easy score. But Nicky's too smart for that, and in a serious of slickly-edited encounters he schools her on the basics of the con. She's beautiful and Nicky knows it; but Jess seems unaware how to use that to her advantage. Of course sparks begin to fly between the two, but when people live their lives hiding their emotions, trust is always going to be a problem.

The action soon leads to New Orleans on ""Super Bowl"" weekend, where Nicky teaches Jess how things REALLY work in this racket. One of the best things Focus does is shoot down the myth of the ""long con"" that unfortunately rules every heist movie. ""It doesn't exist"" he tells her; and Nicky's business is really just that; a business. It's an extremely illegal, precisely-managed business full of weird gadgets, get rich quick schemes, and literally dozens of pickpockets on the payroll. The point is despite the expensive trinkets, famous people, and glamorous locales, being a con man is work; ugly and dirty. Of course, so is the game of love, and people who lie as a way of life are notoriously bad at playing it. Sparks fly between Jess and Nicky, but after a risky (meaning ludicrous), big money scheme pays off, he kicks her to the curb and they go separate ways.

Focus both embraces and sidesteps the clichs of the genre, and perhaps the best example of the latter is how the second half plot isn't much of a con at all. It's a fairly straight-forward romance in which Nicky attempts to win back Jess' love. Of course, his way of doing that is through a fairly uninteresting con in Buenos Aires, one involving a race car mogul (Rodrigo Santoro) who happens to be Nicky's boyfriend. While this part of the film simply can't carry the same level of energy, the payoff is pretty great and the ride we're taken on is worth it. Requa and Ficarra use a number of sweet visual tricks, including one that is suggested in the film's title. One of their best-looking scenes is a subtle one involving a department store mirror. But the smartest thing the directors due is simply focus on the stars. It may be superficial as Hell to talk about how stunning Margot Robbie is, but it's simply the truth and the filmmakers use everything at their disposal to highlight her. Her chemistry with Will Smith is off the charts, and he seems motivated like he hasn't been in years. Gerald McRaney is a hoot as a crusty old bodyguard with a dislike of anything modern, and Adrian Martinez (the ""Discount Double Check"" guy from the commercials) steals the show as Farhad, the team's sex-obsessed oddball.

""You die with the lie"", Nicky tells Jess early on, and Focus follows a similar mandate. Ultimately, the film presents itself as more complicated than it actually turns out to be. Some may be disappointed that so many twists and turns are easily figured out (although one was a legitimate surprise), but others will be having so much fun they won't mind playing along.",1426809600,61,4055,4.573590096286107

Having seen it, though, I might see it again. It wasn't a great movie, but it wasn't bad, either. Some of it seems a little slow, but in the end, more of it made sense.

It might not be a good date movie. Why? Hmm, maybe because there's always the tension of what's a con and what's real. If your date, spouse, or significant other isn't secure, might make him/her antsy. Not real bad, but not necessarily a positive romance movie.

This probably won't rocket the careers of the lead actors, but it's surprising how convincing their acting is. And isn't that what good acting is about?",1426723200,,706,4.374045801526718

While the narrative is involving and well-written, it isn't surprising. There are only so many ways Focus can go. Either they are trying to outdo one another or they aren't. You have a fifty-fifty chance of guessing or figuring it out. Once that happens, you then have to look at other things to keep you interested.

But he seems to recognize something in her and gives her a few pointers. A few months later, Jess shows up in New Orleans as Nicky and his crew are running a massive pickpocketing operation. They give her a few tests and then let her join the team. As Nicky takes her under his wing, they become more intimate and this leads Nicky to take some chances he knows he shouldn't. A couple of years later, Nicky is in Buenos Aires, working a new mark, Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro, ""300"", ""Love, Actually""), a race car owner who creates a formula that may give his cars an advantage. He wants Nicky to convince his rival, McEwen (Robert Taylor, TV's ""Longmire""), an Australian, that a fake version of the formula is real, giving him an even larger edge. But Garriga's security man, Owens (Gerald McRaney) doesn't trust Nicky. And Nicky is shocked to learn that Jess is Garriga's new girlfriend.

Written and directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the writing  directing team behind ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" and ""I Love You, Phillip Morris"" and the writers of ""Bad Santa"", ""Focus"" is a very well-made if unsurprising film. What ""Focus"" does have going for it is great filmmaking technique, actors who are giving it their all to try to misdirect us and a screenplay filled with a lot of nice, interesting moments. All of this makes the film immensely more watchable than many other recent attempts at this genre.

There are basically three stages to the story, which fits in nicely with the conventionality of a three-act structure. And each stage is set in a new city. Stage One, the introduction, happens in a snow-blanketed New York City. This introduction allows the two to get to know one another, a little, and allows us to learn a bit about them as well. Given this is a film about con-people, anything they say or do is to be regarded with a great deal of skepticism. And we see and learn these things while watching them test each other, pushing a little to see how far they can go. This is also the shortest act, giving just a flirtatious taste of what is to come.

Stage Two moves to New Orleans as the city prepares for a massive football championship. It isn't the Superbowl; I suspect they couldn't get approval to use the major sporting event given the activities depicted in the film, but it is a really, big Super Bowl-like event. When Jess arrives in town, she is surprised to find Nicky and he gives her a quick low down of his operations, introducing her to Horst (Brennan Brown, lots of TV work), Nicky's second-in-command, and Farhad (Adrian Martinez), his lascivious hacker. Jess quickly becomes a member of the team, proving she is a quick study and very eager to learn. They also seem impressed by her ability to adapt and everything starts to run very smoothly.

Stage Three? Buenos Aires. This is the longest part of the story, but provides the most complicated con and leads to the most drama in their lives. The length also provides an opportunity to slow everything down - and it does, but not in a terrible way. There are also a number of twists and turns which help hold our attention.

It is slightly strange that ""Focus"" has such a well-delineated three act structure, the well-established convention of most screenplays. But most of the less creative types in Hollywood would expect the acts to adhere to the 20-50-20 (give or take 10 for each stage) rule. Many in Hollywood actually go to page 20 or 30 and look to see if Act One ends there, Act Two at page 70 - 90 and so forth. If it doesn't, they won't even consider it. In ""Focus"", each act gets longer, providing more details about the relationship between Nicky and Jess, and more complicated, and more interesting.

With each new city, the filmmakers seem to delight in giving us a picture postcard love letter of the area. I've never been to Buenos Aires, but each new location seems to be presented in the best possible light, no pun intended. In fact, many of these images have the dreamy yet clear, slightly over saturated look of a Michael Mann film. Cinematographer Xavier Gorbet (""Monster House"", ""I Love You, Phillip Morris"") makes each of these places drool worthy. If I were the Director of Tourism in each, I would do whatever I possibly could to sign him for my next batch of commercials.

Smith does some really good work here, giving us his most fully realized character in some time. Nicky has a lot swirling around in his brain, causing him to concentrate on everything going on around him, running all of the permutations in his head. This makes Smith seem pensive and less jokey than he sometimes comes across. When Jess enters his life, he is intrigued by her. And you can often see him trying to fight the growing attraction her feels for her. Or is this part of the con? It's difficult to figure out because he is very guarded.

And, of course, he will find himself attracted to Jess. As Nicky's attraction grows, he finds himself conflicted. Is he making some decisions based on his feelings? This is new territory for him and he isn't sure how to react.

As they reunite in Buenos Aires, they find they have gone a few steps back and have to deal with all that entails before they can move forward. This allows them to recreate the suspicions they may have had previously and wonder again about them.

Let's face it, Margot Robbie was cast as Jess because she is beautiful. She does bring a certain amount of naivet&eacute; to the part and helps to convince us that she really is a green con-person. Or is this part of the act? The fact that she manages to keep us guessing is proof that she does have some acting chops.

The supporting cast is all good and helps to convincingly keep us guessing everyone's motives throughout. B.D. Wong and Rodrigo Santoro, as the respective marks - or are they leading this game of cat and mouse? - each seems to have a lot of fun. Wong's character is much more lighthearted, but no less convincing than Santoro's race car owner who seems to feel his entire world rests on one decision.

Gerald McRaney is also convincingly distrustful as Owens, Garriga's security officer. Owens distrust could derail Nickys plans for a huge payday..

Ficcara and Requa, the writers and directors, have done a pretty admirable job. They give it the old college try and do their best to try to keep us guessing with every twist and turn. That they manage to do this at all is testament to their skills. To compensate for the diminished lack of surprise, they include nice, interesting moments which help to take the story to some unique places. In Buenos Aires, the film cuts to a gruff looking white guy as het gets into his car, visits a pharmacy and buys some things causing the clerk's eyes to raise in question. Then we watch as he gets some food, annoyed by the crowd's cheers as they watch a soccer game. Finally, he gets into his car again. As the scene continues, it surprises us, casting some doubt on what is going on, causing us to question the surety of our convictions that this story can't and won't surprise us. Thankfully, there are more scenes like that. Ficcara and Requa seem best when they are working with scenes like this, allowing us to visit smaller, more intimate details that don't seem to have a place in the overall picture.

They also seem to take a similar approach with the dialogue. It doesn't always, refreshingly, seem 'on the nose'. The writers show some skill at orchestrating conversations between Nicky and Jess that seem more natural, and reveal things about their characters, while retaining a natural feel to the speech and cadence. This is a difficult thing to accomplish, to make such calculated exchanges seem so natural. Trust me, I know.

A lot of the fun of ""Focus"" comes in following every twist and turn, even when it seems like you know what will happen. The directors have worked very hard to try to make the various, well-trod elements fresh and new. Okay, fresher and newer. And they have had a lot of success, which means that even when the story seems a bit predictable, you still enjoy the ride.",1426464000,5,8725,4.615087040618955
6876382,3,B00QKS2DP6,"Nicky (Will Smith) is a big time scam artist who scams people by second nature. He recruits Jess (Margot Robbie) a pick pocket to help him fleece the crowd in New Orleans during a football event. Afterwards the part after being intimate and end up running a scam involving an algorithm for race cars.

The beginning of the film was fun and light. It involved slight of hand and scams and I felt like I was watching ""Now You See It."" However once we get into the race car scam, the film becomes boring as we wait for final scam to happen and perhaps the film to return to its lighter self. Unfortunately the film doesn't recover.

Adrian Martinez stole every scene he was in. Kudos.

6876383,4,B00QKS2DP6,"Will Smith is a favorite actor of mine and has been for many years. It has been quite awhile since the audience has last seen Will Smith on screen as a lead, but he shows us why there's a science to getting people to trust you in the movie Focus.

While at a restaurant, Nicky takes notice of Jess who is at the moment in the company of a very drunk individual. She comes over to Nicky's table and suddenly asks Nicky to pretend to be her boyfriend. They strike up a conversation and immediately Jess invites Nicky upstairs to hotel room. Just as things are about to get steamy, Jess's ""husband"" bursts in and claims he will shoot Nicky; too which Nicky replies that he has cancer. After Jess figures out that Nicky realizes what is really going on here, she later meets up with Nicky wanting him to teach her his skill. But there is so much more to being a con man.

Will Smith does a fantastic job in his role as Nicky. He is cunningly clever and easily maneuvers his way in and out of schemes like there's nothing to it. His performance in this movie is a reminder of the Will Smith I enjoy watching in his movies. Great job. The Gorgeous and talented Margot Robbie does a nice job portraying Jess throughout the course of the movie. Jess is a fast learner, and she and Nicky begin to develop an attraction towards each other. And in terms of chemistry, Will Smith and Margot Robbie are ELECTRIC together on-screen. Rodrigo Santoro plays Garriga and does a good job, while Adrian Martinez stars in a supporting role as Farhad and does a really nice job.

In terms of story there were a FEW times where the script felt uneven, but that did not stop me from enjoying the movie. The music that this movie has is also really likable. Each scene that has music playing in the background fits in really well with the scene it was being played during. Focus is not a slow movie by any means, but it is a good movie due to the lead actors (and chemistry between Will Smith and Margot Robbie), the humor, the surprises, and the quick change of scenery . And  with all this being said, I consider the movie Focus to be

A Good Experience

6876384,3,B00QKS2DP6,"Will Smith has a modestly successful return to a character he's best playing.  A smart, wise-cracking charmer.  Here he plays Nicky, a high-rolling con artist.  As a potential victim of a con himself, he meets Jess (Margot Robbie, ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") who has set him up as a mark at his hotel.  Nicky calls her bluff when the time comes and eventually gives her a job working for him.

This initial ""trust"" issue comes into play for the next 100 minutes or so, taking the audience on a roller coaster ride trying to guess what's real and what isn't.  So, depending on what you're looking for in a movie, you can either just run with the various scams or try to calculate what the next play is.  The biggest problem with the film is that the various scams border on absurd.  I take that back, they are absurd.  I can't give out much in detail without providing spoilers but in one case, Nicky, known to bet high amounts of cash on the horses or cards, gets into a betting game with a high roller at the Super Bowl.  It's never called the Super Bowl of course, but the big game is in New Orleans.  They make several crazy bets like, will the next play be a run or a pass.  It gets to the point of picking out a jersey number.  But instead of just providing a number, the better goes to the window with binoculars and scans the sidelines.  Why would he do that?

Smith and Robbie get it on of course, and yes the chemistry is good.  Robbie, is a gorgeous woman but this girl can also act as she proved a couple years ago in ""The Wolf of Wall Street.""  The film, directed and written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") has some great locals (Buenos Aires, Las Vegas, New York City) to shoot in and they look great on the big screen.  The final act involving big time Formula 1 racing is a head scratcher that makes no sense but creates a big reveal (yawn).  The film does have its moments and Ms. Robbie can't be ignored.  In the end, ""Focus"" is a decent, entertaining film that you'll forget about quickly.",1425859200,,2031,4.294736842105263

6876386,4,B00QKS2DP6,"Focus is a movie in the genre of caper movies such as Ocean's 11. If you like this kind of movie, you'll like Focus.

The story has enough twists and turns to keep you entertained. While the story does require you to suspend disbelief, it maintains its pace through the entire movie, in a way which holds your interest to find out what is going to happen next. And there are enough surprise plot twists and double crosses to keep you guessing.

Will Smith and Margot Robbie are appealing in their respective roles, as professional con artists.

The locations and production design are excellent.

The soundtrack adds to the movie, with well chosen tracks, and an interesting homage to another caper movie: The Thomas Crown Affair- its theme song ""Windmills of your Mind"" plays in the background in one scene, and during the closing credits.

I could not relate to any of these characters, as they are all theives, pick-pockets, hackers etc. These are not good people, so why do I care about their romance/lives.
