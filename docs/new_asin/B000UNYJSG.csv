Unfortunately, their is currently no Region 1 release of this film, so the best way to view this film is to get the No Mercy For The Rude 3-Disc Special Limited Edition 2006 Korean release by EnterOne (Region 3).",1414972800,,321,4.649122807017544
8214007,5,B000UNYJSG,"Just wanted to agree with Jolim. This was an excellent movie. I added it to my wish list since it's not available here on Amazon. If you ever get a chance to watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.",1327536000,,205,4.15
8214008,5,B000UNYJSG,"This is my first review, and I'm writing it because I couldn't stand the fact that there was only one review for this movie and it totally trashed a perfectly good film.  In fact, this is film is better than good, it's one of the best Korean films I've seen in a long time.  Yes, like most Korean films it does borrow from the canons of film-making in terms of style and story, but what the film does so great is to put together those elements in a refreshing and original manner.  If you're sick and tired of watching your run-of-the-mill romantic comedies or romances in Korean film/drama, then this movie is definitely for you.  The filmmaker really made this movie with great style and if you've watched a fair amount of movies you'll already know how it's going to end, but you'll still like it anyways.

There's a scene at the end of the movie with a red blanket and shoe that sums up entirely just how much work the director put into making this film one of style and quality story-telling.  Also I know a bit of Korean (I'm Korean American but I still had to watch it with subtitles because it was too difficult for me), and I can say that the script was written very well--it'll come through in translation just how well this film was written.  Whatever limits the director may have as a filmmaker/writer(s) (and we all have our limits), they do what they can with absolute grace and style.  I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an atypical, quality Asian film.  No, scratch that.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film watching experience.",1252454400,4,1585,4.510489510489511
8214009,2,B000UNYJSG,"Superb production values aside--and really, what Korean movies AREN'T well made these days?--NO MERCY FOR THE RUDE has a lot of the elements that, when viewed in too many consecutive movies (which can happen in this country's films), tend to shift people away from Korean cinema for short periods of time, and help to explain the terrible financial slump that is plaguing the K-film industry right now. You'd think they could avoid it by mixing genres, but there's often a streak of emotional violence in many (but obviously not all) Korean movies --including comedies--that takes a toll after awhile, and this film has some of that, in addition to some rather cringe-inducing physical violence at odds with it's self-consciously quirky characters.

It's the story of a mute, loner assassin (Shin Ha-kyun, essaying yet another oddball like he did in SAVE THE GREEN PLANET) who lives by his own code of ""cool"" and dreams of becoming a bullfighter despite being a bit of a bumbler in his profession. His best friend is also an assassin and former ballet dancer who is saving up to buy a warehouse to make into his own studio. Isn't that just quirky and cool? He picks up and beds a sexy bar girl (Yoon Ji-hye) from a favourite post-kill gin joint, and she comes and goes from his life as she pleases, at least until a little street-urchin attaches himself to Shin, at which point a weirdly dysfunctional family is created. Oh, how inventive!

The killer's motto is summed up in the title, as he only kills those who deserve it (of course, the victims are so one-dimensionally sketched that we have to take the filmmakers' word for it that they're really deserving of the grisly deaths they receive). When a hit results in the death of the intended victim's twin brother, the usual volleyballs of revenge start getting served, leading this wannabe black comedy to a typically melodramatic and tragic ending that is almost a foregone conclusion in these kinds of films. Especially the ones from Korea.

Watching this as a double bill with CITY OF VIOLENCE (another Dragon Dynasty release, although the credit for it's quality falls squarely at the heels of the producers of the original Korean DVD) makes for an interesting contrast in styles of on screen physical carnage. Where CITY is rather cartoonish and winkingly overblown, MERCY marks each kill with the juicy pop of an exit wound or the nauseating (and repeated) ""chukks"" of knives thrusting into chests and stomachs--all lovingly and realistically recreated in crispy DTS and effected as realistically as possible. A flashback scene involving a paid hit on an unsuspecting fisherman is a queasy highlight only because the filmmakers cleverly place the audience in the shoes of the first-time assassin, who (initially) has difficulty with the job because he knows nothing about his scared, misunderstanding victim, and neither do we, which makes it all the more difficult to watch. After that, blood flows with an abject realism but in the end there's no point to anything these self-consciously eccentric characters do, and their fates are made predictable by the very genre!

Some films in the ""oddball assassins"" genre will take at least modest pains to show the pointless and unrewarding nature of killing and its inevitable consequences, and I guess this one MIGHT be trying to get that across, but I find some of the more effective ones have at least a believable hero worth rooting for: MERCY'S hero is practically a byproduct of his own imagination, but he's not even a remotely likable character once you see how viciously he can dispatch targets that usually don't get much opportunity to fight back. Nor is anyone he comes into contact with particularly likable beyond their wardrobes. By the time the festivities climaxed with the by-now de-rigeur Korean blend of melodrama and spitting blood, I found I couldn't have cared less.",1188086400,2,3896,4.961715160796325
