Inanimate objects that lift themselves up and float freely like anti-gravity devices, the wizard villan that whips out a load of $10 bills out of thin air, hands that protrude from the ground at night in a cemetary, a tall skinny gweilo dude playing dracula with a big smile....well, I think the point is clear.

Here is a genre within a genre that fortunately did not take a life of its own.

In recent weeks I had been reading reviews on Billy Chong movies and so I set out to get a few and am now convinced beyond a doubt that this man has the speed, agility, and execution to handle most anything thrown at him!  It was a joy seeing Lo Lieh in a characteristically villainous role and Alan Tsu who uses shaolin long fist in a number of scenes.

Getting back to Billy Chong, I have to agree that this man is Jackie Chan and Jet Li rolled into an awesome kung fu package that inspires the viewer! This film is no exception. I personally think he's far better than the likes of Wang Tao, Tino Wong, Kao Fei, among other well known stars of the genre, but definitely NOT at the same overall level of fighting prowess as Whang Ing Sik, Hwang Jang Lee, Kwan Young Moon, Chan Shan, and the late Eagle Han Ying.",1384560000,,1375,4.317829457364341
