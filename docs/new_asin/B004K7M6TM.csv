4395890,5,B004K7M6TM,"Simply the best concert I've seen from Ruben Blades... Definitely worth it!

Simplemente el mejor concierto que he visto de Ruben Blades... Definitivamente vale la pena!",1306627200,,169,5.5
4395891,4,B004K7M6TM,"This was one masterful performance by Ruben Blades and Seis del Solar.

The concert had the feel of a bunch of master musicians not working, but genuinely enjoying performing the music that we have come to love over the decades. In fact in this video, and inspired by a cameo appearance by Cheo Feliciano, Ruben shows us that he can dance, not to mention that he is an able guitarist. I did not know that about Ruben.

Technically, the video was professionally shot with various cameras and angles and the graphic overlays really add a nice touch to the nostalgic mood of the concert.

I too wish the video had been done in Blu-ray and assume that the reason for not doing so was probably economic. However, visually and sound-wise this dvd has the best picture and audio quality of the Ruben Blades dvd's out there.

Until Ruben gives us something in Blu-ray of this quality some time in the future, this one is worth buying!",1305158400,,926,4.5602409638554215
4395892,4,B004K7M6TM,"I  am going differ with the other reviewers and give this an excellent review. Blades performance in this concert was spectacular. Albeit the video quality was not HD, it was not as TERRIBLY HORRIBLE as they depict it. I do think they should have recorded in HD, they have the resources to be able to do this. On to the performance.

Ruben returned after serving his country as minister of tourism. He came to Puerto Rico with Seis del Solar in a flawless performance with most of his biggest hits in a 2 disc album/DVD. I think you can appreciate Ruben's songs and performance regardless if it's in high definition or not.

The following is my review of the CD: http://www.amazon.com/Todos-Vuelven-Live-Vol-1/product-reviews/B004H1UO36/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1

Not only do I have this album but, I had the chance to be at the actual concert. This is a masterful performance from arguably the best singer/songwriter to grace the genre of salsa. The album is a collection that spans his entire musical career from Tite Curet's ""Plantacion Adentro"" all the way to his post Fania career in ""Buscando America"". The concert was three hours and fifteen minutes of pure energy and Ruben hasn't lost a step in his performance. I highly recommend this album because it is the perfect blend of meaningful lyrics, an awesome musical performance and is just overall enjoyable.",1302134400,9,1390,5.164444444444444
4395893,1,B004K7M6TM,"Me parece inaceptable que esta produccin sali al mercado con audio en estreo en pleno ao 2011. Recuerdo que el lbum Siembra en acetato y aos despus en CD, fue producido en el ao 1978 y tiene hoy da una de las mejores calidades de audio producidas hace ms 33 aos. Cmo es posible que saquen al mercado un DVD con esta calidad de audio? La calidad del video tampoco es de lo mejor pero se puede tolerar, pero el audio en formato estreo me parece una enorme error por parte de los productores. Qu ocurri con la tecnologa disponible actualmente como Blu-Ray?

En mi humilde opinin, si eres exigente con la calidad no pierdas el tiempo con estos 2 DVD. Mi decepcin ha sido a tal grado que el Volumen 2 de esta produccin, ni lo he visto, ni creo que lo haga.

Cundo podremos contar con un concierto de Rubn grabado en Blu-Ray con audio en 5.1 Surround o DTS Surround?",1301184000,3,860,4.269938650306749
4395894,2,B004K7M6TM,"Ladies and Gentlemen- I am giving a fair review of the Ruben Blades ""Todos Vuelven-Part 1 and 2"" DVDs. He's certainly our legend on Salsa music. I really waited to receive those DVDs on my door from UPS. To my surprise and although the quality of the music on the DVD is okay, I am really disapointed that Ruben Blades and his production team put out such a poor quality DVDs on what I categorize as ""the best concert of his lifetime."" The video quality of the concert is poor. I attribute this to the poor production of the video recording. It should had been on HD as a minimum. I will still treasure both of those DVDs and add to my collection of music concerts, but wished this was done at a better quality and also done on one disk instead of 2 separate ones.",1301184000,8,764,4.239726027397261

8432555,5,B004K7M6TM,"As a long-time fan of Blades who owns just about everything he's recorded, this video is a winner!  Just buy it -- both volumes!  Ruben's voice is amazing and the band swings.  The addition of Jimmy Bosch is a nice treat, as well.  (The cameo by Cheo Feliciano during Juan Pachanga was very touching!)",1364083200,,301,4.518518518518518

8432557,5,B004K7M6TM,"I love Latin Music, and had heard of Rueben Blades over the past few years, but never got any of his music.  Recently I purchased from Amazon.com Two of Ruben's CD's which I am crazy about.  So I thought I'd order this DVD.  LOVE IT!  I not only get to hear his Beautiful voice I get to watch him perform.  He is so passionate about his music and it comes through in this DVD.  I only wish his song Tiempos was in this performance.  My favorite song of all!  I would recommend this to any Ruben Blades Fans and get his Tiempos CD, I'm wearing it out I listen to it so much!  ENJOY!",1319241600,4,581,4.026315789473684
8432558,4,B004K7M6TM,Very good music. My understanding is this was recorded in Puerto Rico recently. Wish the quality was a little better. Not sure why they decided to make it two separate DVDs for purchase. I'd prefer to have purchased the two DVDs in one package...,1314921600,,246,4.613636363636363
8432559,4,B004K7M6TM,"I must strongly disagree with some of the folks who gave a thumbs down to this concert based soley on the the video and sound quality.
Although not Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS sound and not HD video, the concert production was really good if not great!

Now to what counts...the band was back together with a couple of add ons and invited guests and they were impecable. Ruben @ 60+ years of age sounds better than ever. If you enjoy Salsa concerts, this is a MUST HAVE, BOTH volumes.

The concert ""estuvo de madre"". Ruben is in a class of his own and as a Puerto Rican, I am honored that he chose our island as his venue for this concert recording.

Que DIos les Bendiga.",1311292800,2,669,4.251968503937008
