8570632,5,B00BLWCQMQ,"Over the years, I have taken several speed reading courses. None of them have had much of a change in my reading abilities. Mr. Vohra's technique has begun to make me a more efficient reader. It isn't happening overnight as I have previously expected, but I can see definite changes in my speed and comprehension.

8570634,5,B00BLWCQMQ,"The approach in this video is a much more rigorous and less fluffy approach than photoreading, etc. It starts with a quick overview of historical approaches (Including Evelyn Woods), and then goes into an intensive study of using grammar structure to read much more quickly. Although the video is only 90 minutes, the actual learning time, according to the video is closer to 6 months.",1376265600,3,385,4.938461538461539

8570636,5,B00BLWCQMQ,"By far the best tool I've tried to improve my reading speed. Arvin's method does not cut corners. There's no simple ""trick,"" but if you follow the methodology, you will get results unlike anything else out there. Results that will last!",1367366400,18,236,4.780487804878049
