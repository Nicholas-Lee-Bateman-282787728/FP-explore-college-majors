1707865,5,B000065U3K,I really enjoyed this film. Full of great sets and oddball characters with splashes of nudity throughout. The print is exceptional and the music and photography first rate.,1199664000,9,172,5.178571428571429
1707866,1,B000065U3K,"The cover of the disc reads ""Everything you ever wanted in a woman and more....a lot more"", no it's not a transexual X rated disc, it's Superchick. I bought this cause it was so cheap and I was hopeing for some eye candy and I got this.....Superchick. It's not funny, not even in a its so bad its good way. There is one or two very (VERY) small eye candy shots of someone other than the leading Superchick gal. My recommendation is 1 out of 5, it's really bad and has no redeeming factors that I can think of, not even if you were totally trashed, it just sucks. Maybe if you saw this on 42nd street in the 70's and you got some that night to remember that time, but all the times I would watch movies on 42nd street they were Kung Fu flicks with guys throwing baskets with swords inside that these old Kung Fu Masters would throw on peoples heads and then snap back a chain attached to the basket and cut the guys heads off, that's all I remember of my 42nd street movie days, that and my friend Marcus shouting out wisecracks every 5 minutes in movies cause he was a big dude and could get away with that stuff. We never snuck into Superchick, too bad to, Marcus might have made it a lot more enjoyable.",1132617600,7,1205,4.175965665236052
1707867,2,B000065U3K,"After watching this flick, I am left wondering: What script did these people reject??  Some films are so bad they're good.  Other films are just bad.  In it's favor, Julia Roberts is not in it.",1123891200,3,193,4.457142857142857
1707868,2,B000065U3K,"I had a dilly of a time trying to figure out if this movie was some kind of feminist statement on the empowerment of women or a soft-core porn movie with very little porn.  I soon realized my point was moot as cheese is cheese, no matter what hat it wears.
Superchick stars Joyce Jillson as Tara B. True (Yeah, I know, I thought the same thing).  Anyway, Tara is a flight attendant with Crown International Airlines (Hey, Crown International is the company behind this movie...what a coincidence!) and we find that in each of the cities that she makes frequent stops in, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, she has a boyfriend.  In New York, there's Earnest, the witty, mature, sophisticated, wealthy brain surgeon.  In Miami there's Johnny, the young, athletic type, and in Los Angeles there's Davey, the young rock superstar.  He's supposed to be the creative type.  They all share one thing in common besides Tara in that they all want to marry her.  Also, none of them knows about the others.  Being the free spirit she is, she declines all their offers, preferring to keep things they way they are.  A really big deal was made how all three of these men fell so hard for Tara, even Johnny, the playboy.  And a playboy he is, as we see him getting it on with a rather large busted woman about five minutes before he's supposed to pick up Tara at the airport.  Seems sleazy, but we do find out that part of how he makes a living is as a tennis instructor, with a fringe benefit of private lessons with some of his older, rich, female students at his houseboat.  Yowsa!
Anyway, the movie sloshes along, providing not so much a story but a string of rather lame vignettes.  We get to see Tara at karate school, along with some really horrific fighting choreography.  Seems the school has a prestigious visitor from the Far East, a supposedly accomplished martial artist.  After some misogynist comments by her instructor and the guest, Tara spars with the martial arts champion, defeating him soundly, and living up the name of the movie.  You see, it's funny because she's a girl, and yet she beat them up.  Get it?
In another scene we see Tara at a party.  Being the 70's, you better believe there was groovy music, free love, and plenty of wacky tobaccy.  In a fairly funny bit, the cops are called to investigate noise complaints and arrive at the door of the apartment where the party is taking place.  After knocking on the door and identifying themselves, a hipster answers with a doobie in his mouth!  Needless to say, The Man proceeds to bust the partygoers.  Tara manages to escape.  As she's walking through the park, a motorcycle gang tries to accost her...well, there were only three chopper thugs, so I am unsure if that constitutes a gang per say...as Wheelie and the Chopper gang discuss what they're going to do with her, watch for pre-Grizzly Adams Dan Haggerty as a gang member utter a charming line about skipping all the 'motorcycle movie talk' (one of the few subtle jokes in the movie) and just having gang sex with her.  They get off their motorcycles, chase her into some bushes, where we are treated to a few minutes of dubbed crashing, bushes shaking, and various other sounds of people getting beat up.  We never actual see any of this, and based of the scenes in the karate school I can understand why.  No sense in continually pointing out the fact that the actress is incapable of performing in a fight scene, even though her character is supposedly such an accomplished fighter she can beat karate masters and gangs of thugs.  The whole fight off screen in the bushes scene is played for comedy, but the routine is as tired now as it was back then.  Tara emerges from the bushes, wearing a leather motorcycle jacket and one of the guys' hats, and takes one of their motorcycles.
Eventually we do learn that there is a plot, and it is one involving Johnny, Tara's Miami boyfriend.  Johnny owes money for some bad bets made at the dog track, but the gangsters will forgo the money if Johnny gets Tara to carry a package on the plane.  The package contains guns, but since she's part of the crew, she wouldn't get stopped.  Their plan revolves around a mob courier carrying a large sum of cash from a casino in the Bahamas to Las Vegas.  They plan to hijack the plane, steal the cash, and retire to Mexico.  The plan seems a little flawed to me, as I think the Mob would have very little difficulty in finding someone who stole a lot of their money in Mexico...whatever.  Now these guys are played like bad guys out of a Disney movie, all stupid and bungling like.  I especially liked how the head thug in this little group of gangsters talked.  At one point, he referred to a gun as a 'heater'.  Geez, I thought that term went out bootleg whisky and calling cops 'bulls'.  I always enjoy when a lame writer tries to add street cred to his work by using lingo that was popular about 40 years ago.  There was some fight scene where Tara was lamely kicking and hitting these guys, but again, probably best not to focus on such scenes when the actress can't perform the stunts and you can't afford a stunt performer to fill in for her.
Oh man, I almost forgot, John Caradine was in this movie...for like five minutes, in a scene was embarrassing for me to watch.  I know he had a number of lousy roles, especially at the end of his career, but this one, where he's playing a creepy old S&M freak, has to be the bottom of the barrel.",1064966400,27,5453,4.479757085020243

A blank stare is true acting! Gratuitous breasts never hurt, either.
She travels the country only giving half of her attention to her flight attendant job, changing in various rest rooms into a free-love karate choppin' dope smokin' vixen, and keeping a different stud in 3 cities. The story doesn't go much further than that besides a criminal pursuer who wants her for both romantic and mischievous reasons.
I wondered about her ""super power"" flight bag which seems to hold an array of outfits and wigs without ever appearing to contain anything more substantial than a coke baggie or VD ointment.  It wasn't until halfway into the movie that she acknowledges the purse's ability, and I felt validated.

Also it might offend the old time feminists who apparently think of this as a great movie about female empowerment.

1707989,2,B000065U3K,"The cause of feminism was a big one in the 70's and Hollywood is always one who'll gladly try to cash-in on any cause-du-jour. It's too bad that ""Superchick"" does such a lackluster job in doing that.

Perennial t.v. guest star, Joyce Jillson, plays ""superchick"" Tara B. True. She's the ultimate swinging 70's icon of the modern woman. A stewardess by trade, she has men in every port of call and never passes up the fun of a good time. But when one of her beaus gets her involved with a plot to hijack her flight, she busts out some heavy-duty karate action to stop them!

With a plot that preposterous, you'd think there's a lot of funny hijinks to be had. You'd be wrong. This exploitation sex comedy never really gets out of first gear. Most of the attempts at humor just don't work. What is passed off as clever and hip, is actually just boring and tedious. A scene where Tara almost gets busted at a pot party, is a prime example. She tries to play an innocent act, but it's so over the top ridiculous that you think she'd get arrested for bad overacting. A lot of the humor in the film ends up the same way. One of the rare moments it doesn't, is the scene with the flasher (played by Gus Peters). It's one of the very few moments that will actually bring a chuckle or two. Sadly, moments like that are very few and far in-between. Pretty much a kiss of death for a film of this kind. But the problems here don't just rest with an unfunny script.

Most of the actors just don't get to develop any connection with the audience. To call them ciphers to ""Superchick"" would be to insult non-entities everywhere. Even such well-known quantities, like Uschi Digard playing a lesbian porn star and John Carradine as a perverted has-been horror actor, look to be just phoning it in. There's no spark or interest in any of the performances at all. And for a film that is rooted in the ""sexploitation"" genre, there is very little in the way of nudity presented (with most of that given by Uschi Digard in one single scene). It's a sexploitation film with very little of a sexual component to it. Many PG-13 films today have more raunchiness to them. And as for the plane hijacking plot, by the time we reach the climax of that, your interest is likely to have wandered into thinking about anything else. Even the karate fight lacks any punch.

""Superchick"" not only fails to be a funny satire spoof of the modern 70's feminist, but it fails at being a fun and sleazy exploitation film. Basically, it fails to do what it was likely intended to do. There's too little depravity and bawdiness for it to work as a sexploitation film, and too much contrived hokeyness for it to be truly funny. There's little here to recommend anyone check this out, even genre fans. There's lots of other films of this type that do a much better job with this kind of material. You should seek those out over this decidedly ""un-super"" flop!",1393113600,,2915,4.442990654205608
1707990,3,B000065U3K,"SUPERCHICK is yet another ""classic"" sex-farce from CROWN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES.

There's John Carradine as a washed-up movie star! What's Terra doing at his ... Oh. Carradine plays a sadistic pervert on the make! No problem! Terra unleashes the karate on him!

She continued and expanded on Righter's claim to be astrologer to the stars.
The question is how a very sophisticated clientele could faithfully follow advice from someone who was a sex-appeal extra in their very recent memory...  The idea of influence from any number of psychic or spiritual quarters- and thereby the empowerment of individuals- took on a reality in the sixties. That's just one of a number of ways the sixties have become incomprehensible to the younger majority of us.

Ok, this film is just silly even for a comedy - although in all fairness, I doubt it was meant to be anything else.  Joyce Jillson, who would later find fame as the astrologer for 20th Century Fox and the Los Angeles Dodgers, has wardrobe malfunction after wardrobe malfunction as she jets her way across the States as a stewardess for Crown International Airways (clever - Crown Int. is the name of the studio that produced the film).  Jillson is Tara B. True, a plain-jane, prudish young woman straight out of the '50's - but as soon as the plane lands, Tara sneaks off to the nearest telephone booth, and out comes 'Superchick', a sexed-up wonder woman with a lover in every port.  In New York, Florida and California, she puts the 'lay' back into 'layover' like nobody's business, living a life of freedom as she turns the male dominated sexual power structure on its head. I don't know if we've ever recovered.

It's unknown how many feminists would sanctify Ms. Jillson's struggle for independence (then OR now), but as one who tries to stay neutral in that particular fight, the sexual behavior of the people in this film - jumping out of one bed and immediately into another - has a certain 'yuck' factor to me nowadays.  I suppose that means I'm old.  Regardless, this film wants to be all about breaking down old standards with the then-shocking idea of a woman in control of her own sexual needs.  Or at least, I have the distinct feeling that this is what Ms. Jillson thought of the film.  I think the studio saw a great opportunity for a lot of T&A. There's no telling that for sure, of course - just my overall impression.

There is a plot here (so to speak), one besides Ms. Jillson just visiting her various lovers - one of her steadies is in hock to a dog track owner.  Once that owner finds out the blond bombshell is a stewardess, he hatches out a silly plot involving smuggling guns aboard the airplane, robbing a mule from the local syndicate, and then hi-jacking the plane.  Obviously he didn't count on Tara B. True turning on the Superchick mojo mid-flight (apparently he was distracted by her other assets), and the filmmakers bring the entire vehicle in for, if not a three point landing, at least one that everyone could walk away from.

I don't necessarily mind these low-budget cheesefests from the '70's (and anyone reading my recent reviews would call me a liar if I said any different), but there has to be something in it to warrant recommending them.  Even for mid-grade '70's exploitation, this one's pretty shabby - the main draw here is Ms. Jillson, of course, and she's plainly overmatched for this role, relying instead on her figure to suggest character rather than any method.  For those who think I'm being too demanding, I'll just say that it is possible to have both, as evidenced by Sondra Currie in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Policewomen/dp/B00008DDI9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Policewomen</a>.  While that film is only marginally better than this one, Ms. Currie is simply more believable as a superpolicwoman than Ms. Jillson is as a superchick.  As a former Leatherneck, however, I do give Ms. Jillson credit for spreading the love around even to the Marines - and to the film for respectfully treating the service during a time when it may have been easier to discredit it.

Look for cameos by Crown Pictures' reliable bad guy Phil Hoover; an uncredited Dan Haggerty as a bad biker; and a ridiculous spot with John Carradine, who is creepier here than in his horror roles, as he plays a sado-masochist who places an ad in a singles paper which Superchick blithely answers between other lovers (!)

It's my assumption that there are two types of people in the world; those who see the title 'Superchick' and are immediately turned off, and those who are instantly intriqued.  My non-recommendation is a bit superflous for the first group.  For the second, I think you should definitely make the effort to see it, but I would encourage you to either rent first or find an inexpensive copy - while it's a great example of '70's cheese, I find the current prices for the out of print versions of this DVD unsupportable.  The 'Bombshell' version, while at 1.33:1 aspect ratio, is otherwise sufficient for viewing - and it should be enough to inform the viewer of whether they wanted to expend any more effort tracking down other copies.",1291766400,3,5255,5.264670658682634
1707996,3,B000065U3K,"Joyce Jillson, the titular ""Superchick"", has perfect diction and reacts to all of her predicaments with wide-eyed wonder, as if she were a cast member of ""Sesame Street"" or ""The Electric Company"". With her precise enunciation, cadaver-pale skin and rather mousy look, she seems more a choice for the ""naughty librarian"" role (I'm sure this was explored in all its possibilities in Seventies sexploitation...) than a swinging stewardess with a gaggle of man-toys.  Nevertheless, ""Tara B. True"" (that's her name) maintains a bunch of male sex partners on each coast who all want to marry her (""You do indeed fulfill a need in my life"", she chirps to one of them, in that weird ""After School Special"" voice of hers), along with the odd man on the side, including a Marine and ol' John Carradine (in one of his most embarrassing roles), gets high with a groovy black man at a swinging seventies ""pot party"", and beats up some bikers.  Maybe Candice Rialson could've pulled this role off better.  Anyhow, the film was competently put together, even if the dialogue was predictable and the jokes not so funny, and there's lots of cool old airline footage and neat seventies cars (a Javelin, no less).

There is a subplot about a group of criminals who want to hijack her flight in order to steal some money. It comes off as clumsy and stupid and seemed out of place with the rest of the film, which is basically a lame and unfunny comedy. Joyce Jillson is not a horrible actress, but she comes off as kind of dull here, even with the carefree attitude. She had the least chemistry with Timothy Wayne-Brown, who played the rock star, Davey. The scenes with Tony Young (as Johnny) worked best.
