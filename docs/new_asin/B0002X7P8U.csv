8502813,5,B0002X7P8U,"This tape features four uncut steel cage matches from 1987-1988. The first is the Saturday night main event match between Hulk Hogan and Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff in one of the best matches ever on that great, departed show. The next match is the 6 man (all men in the cage at the same time) between the Hart Foundation and the Honky Tonk Man versus Strike Force and the Macho Man Randy Savage. The third match features the awesome superplex from the top of the cage by Hulk Hogan to the Big Bossman on Saturday Night's Main Event. The final match has newly crowned WWF Champion Macho Man Randy Savage take on Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase in the cage at Madison Square Garden---watch when one of Macho's fans trys to put a stop to Virgil interfering in the match by climbing to the top of the cage to intervene!!! Tape runs about an hour and is a classic!",1110326400,4,859,4.408805031446541
