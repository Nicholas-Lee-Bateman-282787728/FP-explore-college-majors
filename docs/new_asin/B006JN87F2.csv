4993939,5,B006JN87F2,"This is a very good, honest movie. You sometimes wonder why do so many children go the wrong way. A lot of times, but not always we see why. In this movie a young man Matthew vandalizes a church. As soon as you see the parents you know why he did what he did. The parents are constantly fighting and complaining. To the boy things seem impossible. He has no one to turn to.
  The good thing of this movie is Matthew has to help fix up the mess he made. He soon comes to understand and learn many things. When Matthew starts working with the woodcarver he sees the beauty of the wood, sees how he should do things through the saying WWJD {What would Jesus Do}.  Things start to make sense to him and he figures out that he's not alone in life.
 The DVD is very uplifting and heartwarming, but also sad at the same time.
 This DVD is a very worthy DVD to watch and keep. I highly recommend it.

4993940,5,B006JN87F2,"This was a great movie with a great message. Too often you see movies that try to convey a message of hope and forgiveness, but this movie does it with style and grace. What I liked about this movie was that it intertwines the teachings of God into every aspect of the movie and shows that even those that have lost their faith can find it again. The movie, I think, is a great one to share with the whole family, as it can show that even though their may be trouble in one's life, if you place your faith in God, you can get it back moving in the right direction.",1330732800,,564,4.044642857142857
4993941,4,B006JN87F2,"""You can either lend a hand or get out of the way, I'm pretty sure I know what choice Jesus would make."" When high school dropout Matthew, upset with his parents, vandalizes a church his punishment is to help fix it up. When he is sent to help woodcarver Ernest Otto (Ratzenberger) Matthew begins to learn a valuable lesson. As I have stated many times before my biggest problem with the faith based movies are that everything is too perfect and there is no tension. This movie is one of the few exceptions that I have found. This is also the only movie like this I have seen that actually threw me for a loop at the end. This is a very good movie and very much worth watching even if you don't normally like the faith based movies. Overall, along with ""What if"" this is one of the best faith based movies I have ever seen. I give it a B+.",1330646400,,839,4.185185185185185

4994048,5,B006JN87F2,"The acting in this movie is superb. And the dialogue seems quite natural - at least most all the time. Very well scripted and directed. And John Ratzenberger is amazing. (I kept finding myself amazed this was the same guy who played know-it-all windbag Cliff Claven in ""Cheers."" The range of emotion he displays in this movie really shows the depth of his acting. Kind of like comedian/comedy actor Robin Williams did in ""The Dead Poets Society."")

Possible SPOILER ALERT here, but what I think really sets this movie apart from other faith-based movies is that in the end not quite EVERYthing ends up hunky dory. I'll leave it at that, but it added a sense of real world realism to the movie.

But, I'd have to give it an A+ overall. Very well done film and very uplifting story to watch. Full of good instructional points for youth OR adults.",1467244800,,844,4.582781456953643

He must work with the woodcarver -- a man who recently lost his wife to illness -- to restore the church to its original condition.  The teen comes from a broken marriage.

4994085,5,B006JN87F2,"I just finished watching this movie.  Here is my suggestion to you husbands and wives- fathers and mothers.  Watch this movies BEFORE you sit down with your older children.  I am suggesting 12+ in age.  You will understand why after watching the film.  It is first rate and a must for you all.

We have been living in a McDonald's attitude society for 3+ now generations.  What do I mean?  Remember that wonderful slogan that they came up with- ""You Can Have It Now and Your Way""?  That is exactly our biggest problem in our society.  Everything revolves around ME!  Are not the  Christ  then families  be our priority?  This film really does reveal what we need most in our lives and that is willing to working together in keeping the faith and family.

So  prepare yourselves by getting the coffee made, sitting down and watching the movie without interruption OR conversation.  Absorb what is happening and when it ends quietly turn out the lights, go to bed and pray about it.  Does what has happened in the film reflect any aspect of the life you are living now?  What WOULD Jesus Do?  It is never too late.  Blessings.",1453593600,,1124,4.542713567839196

4994158,1,B006JN87F2,"I had my mother and family over for dinner and a movie last evening and picked this movie to watch because of the white dove symbol.  At the start of the movie, i noticed it was rated PG, which kind of threw a red flag up: ""why would a family friendly movie be rated PG?""  As we got into the movie, I discovered why.  The father of the son in the movie was extremely arrogant and had a violent and hostile personality.  Extremely hostile.  One half hour into the movie, my mother stated that she did not like the movie, and his personality was bothering her to the point where we had to stop the movie.  If you as a family, with kids, want to sit down and watch a ""family movie"", I would think twice before playing this movie.  Summing up the first half hour; the son goes overboard in destroying a small church - it wasn't just simple vandalism but with a baseball bat, he wrecked everything - smashed windows, destroyed wood carvings, and spray painted ""LIAR"" on the side of the church.  The violence was way overboard.  Then we have the parents, who are filing for a divorce, bickering.  Then we have the father's extremely hostile disposition.  This movie is NOT RECOMENDED as a family friendly movie, and i am extremely disappointed.",1430092800,7,1238,4.457777777777777

the people and want to see everyone make the right decision.  It makes you think about the choices made in life
and start to think WWJD in your own life.  I have always enjoyed John Ratzenberger and he does not disappoint
in this dvd as The Woodcarver.  It is a good story and keeps the audience wondering what is going to happen.
I would highly recommend this dvd to a church youth group, a family with preteens who really enjoy it.  This has a

4994216,3,B006JN87F2,"The right question is: what has Jesus Christ done and what has he told while God ""Father of us, Lord Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit"" gave us all to make decissions. And what he do now? And you: what do you do? Concerning to live life: never breaking truth and love. Commandments are not to break while not to live. To live love is never break truth: what God told us. And the truth about us is always what we have in our ""diary"": where we was, what we like, how we find this e.g. movie (these points were: what belongs to ones life) what have we have done with e.g. friends (point before belongs to the (individual) friendship: friends can know how they think about e.g. this movie), where we have said e.g. ""sorry"", etc.

1) And a situation has evertime what has later happend moments, what we can recall: e.g. friends ever can solve a problem: diary is topic everytime: what for problems what were not before? What is to do: to speak: to make decissions by ""surching the truth"". An explaining brings the adventage to came back to the explaining. This is ever to show. Friends will be friends if they are serious to each other while to understand the problem (e.g. waiting again and again for more than on hour than the appointments were needs not to be) while to take at words means e.g. an honestly ""sorry"" in the past or if problem stays: decission after an answer/statement.

2) Prolblems what cannot be solved, while to take at the words is not possible, is often the way, in this case: wwjd. Not to have success by searching the truth, is to stand in the rain what can make poeple sad because they have not hold that problems can be solved, because it is not possible to say in that case ""you told... and why?"" (those who let problem stay seems to have the value then ""who was first: the chicken or the egg?""). If that became a spiral: No love sahll do one to himself who is sad while problem makes (to have) a small wound at the soul, what can be while the problem is staying more and more deeper because the other one is too ""important"": let him go and gave him the chance to come back (this is old-school in that case to know what the ohter one think, too (this is again a problem if ""who was first: the chicken or the egg?"") if problem will let be the friendship like before and it's understandable, that the problem is not nice while if sadness because of ""never ending"" problem means sadness is staying.

""Never ending problems"" makes sozial working in that case a booming job:
""never ending problems"" is e.g. why people can got depressive: since times has changed because not take at the words means in that case not to can solve the problem instead of what was told in 1,  while ""Searching the truth"" is because of 2. ""no topic"" (""magnet-problem"" is if someone is mainly the one who do the way like in 1, while vici versa the other one do mainly/sometimes like in 2): depressive or so means since yougest time, that sozial working is a booming job because it was learned in that case (where problems stay and sadness within the sprial of continued staying of problem) to help: that was in times where ""That's what"" different: families in the past (without social working jobs) had given hold to each other like the own big brother. And depressive is in the youngest time In THAT case the teaching of reports what are jumping because of 2. (with other words: not the settings of 1) to ""Thereabout (depressive) it goes"" e.g. a report of a doctor, while another of settings of 2. has read an article again, why depressive is not really successful to medicate and why, while in this case the explaining can be in that case (must not) ""the body values are this why: the investigation of e.g. of the brain gives following facts... while blood datas can be now and because of this indicator do show us how we can make depressive ones feel more better while medicaments to that method can give a better life and maybe the breakthrough will be one day, to make depressive vanish...."", and than is automatically that fact the example of settings in 2, is not the topic ""if problems stay and your sadnees because of that, too, than: GO (...)"", but this e.g. at the doctor: ""he is not ready yet"", ""the medications must be set over the times more better"", ""you have to..."", ""be more tollerant...""... and this setting-problem and the values those doctors (not all doctors must be the same in that case of topic) do have in mind, the e.g. lot off dialogues makes (get) bogged down dialouges like ""you think too much"", ""to deep thoughts"". Who don't know the setting problem and who got depressive has had the ""challange"" to say what was to say , what the other one (with the setting of 2) has said, why this was e.g. not...., etc.. And this was called e.g. from x philosophical, while if the poor (yes!!) depressive can be tired or so, if he explain then e.g. ""from the beginning of the challange about what the other one said, to why it is not ok to say that this is philosophical, because...."": really this is scary to know that these situations can have made ""depressive"" people their life because of that life hard, too and was the spiral since a problem began e.g. ""why have you done this, friend?"" then in that case since his ""depression"" at antother place (and e.g. tears from ""the depressive"" one were seen then with ohter eyes): ""I don't want to discuss"", ""make no progress"", etc (out of what saves settings 2) was the problem on the sidetrack. That is like a ""Game over""!! But not ""Game over"" is the way out: Do press the Reset Button and go on without to sink in any spiral. And scary and important: ""no topic"" can be much topics of those in mind (no must) who have the settings of 2), becaue who have settings of 2) thought that no topic will be a topic, if a problem will be solved: that can be but the real problem is in that case a bit different and, to say this again, really, really scary: it is not a must to know each other this way concerning ""no topic"" while have the settings of 2)... and both look ""lie to me"" in TV while in the worst case of people who don't are good hearted ((((and those who are good hearted and have the settings of 2 can this way talk to each other: no one who is good hearted would stop talking. And lie to me is that way interesting like the son Mikey B. who have extreme setting of 1, where was seen that he has lied, because he couldn't hide, as mom with setting of 2) has caught him (heartpounding moment when he was caught as he was asked if he has smoked a cigarette: and on one day he was frightended as suddenly in ""that"" moment a ""loud Bang"" was)))). ""My friend, it was a nice evening. Do you want to come to me and my frieds at my home? You can say what you want. Tollerance for everyone is our motto? We understand!! And if you want I explain you the world like yesterday, where you, and I bet, wanted to know more and deeper why your neighbor shall really take consequently every day his medicine because of his depression: it is good for him. He must open himself, soon, that he not goes the wrong way. We know that depressions can be a problem if those who have depressions begin to think they are useless. Stay to him further on and tell him what you know now. Be always tollerant to him and his illness and don't go away: this is love to him, isn't it? ;). See you, bussie and bye bye!!!"" But to such not good hearted poeple and in that case with the settings of 2) is to say by the good Mikey B. and those who good hearted with the setting of 2): ""This can't be, can it?"". Beeing together? Together forever?

Last statement: to talk/speak to each other is the same: the settings not everytime. ""The same"" is not ever the same!! But in setting 1) and 2) can all be: from kid to grandparents. Simple logic!! But scary why grandparents haven't seen what makes families week and gave this way not to keep watch to the kids after them: new tollerance brought with it e.g. to have so much broken families, where much has because of that, e.g. no hold in families what is provable. ""Back to the roots: and no more what can hide in the new tollerance: job making method where clients come on and on: that has grandparents never wanted and was never known in town. Me, too!! And you, too!! I bet!! What has Jesus Christ said? ""Surch the truth"" and so on. And when?

4994277,5,B006JN87F2,This was a great story with great actors.  I enjoyed the way an elderly man was able to change people lives simply by living out his beliefs.  It was a good story-line for today's family.  It helps show that people get too busy living their lives and forgetting about God so they grow apart.  Divorce is so simple in today's world and it is so easy to grow apart without Christ being the glue that holds you together.  I really enjoyed this movie.,1399939200,,447,4.337349397590361

Ernest is a man who is still reeling from his own loss.  Matthew destroyed much of what Ernest built for the church and has started working with Ernest to fix the damages on the outside of the building and the inside of his heart.

The story is done quite well with really excellent acting on all sides.  From the beginning opening music to the flow of the story, I was drawn in. Sometimes a faith based film can seem rather cheaply done, poorly written or badly acted.  That was entirely not the case for this film.  Ernest and Matthew develop a bond immediately, and the older man helps the teen deal with the pain from his broken home and the teen and his family show the elder wood carver that God indeed has a purpose even now for his life even without his bride by his side.

I would strongly recommend this film for any family member.  There is a great message.  It is appropriate for all ages, but in my opinion I would probably look at the age to start at around 8 or 9.  This is a good time for them to get a message of deciding what Jesus would do in their own circumstances.  It is a very clean film.",1364601600,,1276,4.2272727272727275

I loved all the the characters and the acting was extremely good (which is always harder to achieve when you have several tense/tearful scenes) as was the production value.

The story line is about a troubled teenager whose parents are in the midst of a divorce and a lonely man who has lost his wife of 40+ years to cancer.

4994339,5,B006JN87F2,"A couple on the brink of a bitter divorce...

A teenage boy seeking attention, and in the process committing crimes to get that attention...

A lonely widower wondering if he still has a purpose in life after the loss of his beloved wife...

Four people are brought together in this touching and well done film that has been said to resemble the movie The Last Bricklayer. Matthew feels tossed between his parents as they continue with their plans for a divorce. His dad is a workaholic who seems to have little time for his family. His mom, in her anger and frustration, isn't emotionally available to her son. The only time Matthew sees his parents together is when they're fighting - many times about him. As an act of seeking attention, Matthew vandalizes the church. After all, isn't it God's fault that his parents are seeking a divorce? Isn't it God's fault that Matthew feels unloved?

Woodcarver Ernest Otto's wife recently died of cancer. He struggles with overcoming her death and the life they once shared. Deep in his grief, he finds it difficult to continue without the woman with whom he shared so many years of his life. It doesn't help that the ornate woodcarving he did for the church many years ago has been destroyed by vandalism.

Before long, Matthew's and Ernest's lives intersect. Together, they set out to repair the damage done by Matthew, and Ernest provides the fatherly role model for Matthew that he has long yearned for. In the process, Ernest teaches Matthew something very important. What if, in every dealing that we have with others, we ask ourselves the question, ""What would Jesus do?"" This simple, yet profound question changes Matthew's outlook and perspective.

What happens when Matthew's dad discovers Matthew has been spending time with the elderly woodcarver? What happens when a fire destroys the hard work Matthew and Ernest have accomplished? Is it possible that God has plans for us even when we think our lives are lacking purpose? Is forgiveness possible, even in difficult situations?

This is a great family film that approaches the topic of treating others as Jesus would treat them and becoming more and more Christlike in our everyday dealings with others.  It also focuses on forgiveness, grace, and the importance of marriage. I have seen The Last Bricklayer, and I enjoyed that movie very much - and yes, this movie is similar. However, The Woodcarver adds elements of faith-based answers to life's problems.

This movie had no objectionable material, with the exception of an utterance of the Lord's name in vain. In my opinion, this never adds to a movie, only detracts from it. Little ones may be frightened by the brief vandalism scene and a brief fire scene (these are both tastefully done). Aside from that, this is a heartwarming film with an excellent message that I would recommend for families with children over the age of 5.

I have added this movie to my listing of Mom-Approved Movies on my Wordpress Blog.",1349049600,,2978,4.8560157790927025
4994340,5,B006JN87F2,"This is a terrific Christian movie!  ""What Would Jesus Do?"" was a good movie, but this one (""WWJD: The Woodcarver"") is so much better!",1348617600,,134,4.583333333333333
4994341,5,B006JN87F2,"This is a great family movie for 2012 filmed on various locations in British Columbia. I watched this movie on television recently and was quite moved by it. While the story line is different, it's as if ""The Last Brickmaker in America"" is a cookie cutter and they fit the woodcarver into the same mold.  Having seen that fine film at least a dozen times, I could anticipate what was going to happen in this one in a couple of places.  No matter, it is so touching that I didn't care.

The story is about a troubled teen Matthew Stevenson (played by Dakota Daulby) who acts out his frustration in a destructive manner by destroying some church property and damages some intricate woodwork formed by a master craftsman Ernest Otto (played by John Ratzenberger).  John plays the part of Mr. Otto so well.  He is soft spoken but his words resonate with those he talks to.  The boy ends up working with Mr. Otto to help repair the damage he did.  They quickly become friends and the boys attitude begins to change in a positive way.  His father (played by Woody Jeffreys) really objects to his son helping Mr. Otto despite it being a punishment, as Mr. Otto is his competition so to speak in the construction business.  Woody turns in a masterful performance as the boy's father.

I wonder what would happen if this was done to any other religion? Watering it down so as not to ""offend"".

I didn't know about it being a WWJD movie until I looked it up. You wouldn't know it by the TV version, but still a nice little film.",1337126400,11,442,4.011363636363637

4994350,5,B006JN87F2,"This is a good solid family film with expressed Christian values: WWJD = What Would Jesus Do?

This story is not a sequel to the original WWJD with John Schneider, a decent enough, low-budget effort - we do enjoy it.  But WWJD-II is without question a better film in almost every way.

It certainly helps to have a strong story & this one is excellent!  An adaption of 2001's ""The Last Brickmaker in America,"" with Sidney Poitier, which is an outstanding family film - check it out.  It's actually a bit surprising that they did such a good job of adapting this story of a troubled family at the breaking point because of misplaced personal priorities - a story which had been so well told previously in the ""Last Brickmaker.""

We enjoy ""Last Brickmaker,"" ""WWJD-II Woodcarver,"" & WWJD-I (John Schneider) too.  We will ultimatly see them all many times over, making their purchase a sound entertainment investment for us.  While none of them is ""Lillies of the Field,"" ie: an outstanding major motion picture of ""Oscar"" quality - they are good films in their own right as made for TV movies.

""WWJD II - The Woodcarver"" - is especially recommended for those who enjoy John Ratzenberger (we do) & who appreciate a good story with unashamed Christian values.

We bought our copy of WWJD-II & would gladly do so again.",1333152000,53,1314,4.673913043478261
4994351,4,B006JN87F2,"The 411 by Maria:
As someone who is more spiritual than religious I look for movies that are about people and life rather than preachy. A story where the message comes through without overdoing the religious bible thumping, brow beating, believe in God and all will be saved. That may get some negativity from those preach the bible and live their lives for the Lord. Mostly, I like to know that the story could stand on its own without bible references and this story can!

Matthew,  like most kids is a very good boy, he has issues like everyone else and is living between two parents who are going through a volatile separation.  After taking out his aggression on a church, smashing windows and writing liar on the side, he is caught a forced to repair the damage he has done.

As a parent or a caring adult, this would have been a big wake up call that things have to change but no, they yell at him and eventually he runs away. He eventually meets Ernest played by John Ratzenberger from Cheers fame who does in incredible job of playing a God fearing widow who recently lost his wife. His moments of remembrance brought tears to my eyes.

Ernest and Matthew are exactly what the other needs. Matthew needs attention and someone to steer him on the path of his greatest potential and Ernest needs something to focus his attention on.

This is a wonderful movie that may slip off the radars of those who may think it is a ""religious"" movie. It is that, but it is mostly a movie about people, friends, family and that what we give is what we get.",1332633600,,1550,4.421052631578948
4994352,3,B006JN87F2,"The Woodcarver, subtitled WWJD2, is not really a sequel to WWJD, but a continuation of the theme. When their lives get too busy for each other and God, Jack and Rita only argue whenever they are together. His parents marriage fell apart, so teenaged son Matthew prays. When God doesn't appear to answer, Matthew reacts with rebellion and vandalizes the church. The pastor and deacons choose not to press charges, if Matthew is made to help repair the damages. An unlikely friendship develops between Matthew and Ernest Otto the man who did the original wood carvings. After Mattie quits school and threatens to run away from home, his parents reluctantly allow him to stay with Mr. Otto to defuse the growing resentment the boy has toward everyone. Mr. Otto challenges Matthew to think about each decision he makes by first asking himself, ""What would Jesus do?""

This is a good film for family viewing or for youth groups. Many kids have to deal with disappointments, divorce, changes, and obstacles that cause them to want to lash out in anger. Learning that Jesus and the Bible are not outmoded, but relevant for today is a lesson well worth repeating. Romans 12:2 tells us, ""Don't become like the people of this world. Instead, change the way you think. Then you will always be able to determine what God really wants--what is good, pleasing, and perfect."" (God's Word translation). To put it even more simply, the Christian mindset asks, ""What Would Jesus Do?""

Review: The Woodcarver DVD Faith & Family Films c2012

The Woodcarver DVD is family approved. It is rated PG for vandalism at the opening, and arson near the middle. This is a story of restoration of a family and return to faith in belief in each other and in God. It is very well written and demonstrates reaching out to others to draw them in to find themselves within the perils of their lives.

We liked this movie because it is fast moving bringing you alongside the action of every day life choices that either bring us closer or divide us.

The Woodcarver Official Movie Trailer DVD [...]

Matthew Stevenson is a troubled kid from a broken home. When he vandalizes the local church to get back at his parents, Matthew has to repair the damage to the church to avoid criminal charges. While working at the church, he meets Ernest (John Ratzenberger), an accomplished wood carver who created the intricate woodwork decoration that Matthew destroyed. Ernest has become something of a hermit, but reluctantly comes out of reclusion to help repair the church. Now Ernest and Matthew must work together to preserve the church's beautiful antiquity, and along the way, they also manage to restore their faith in God and in life. Run Time: 91 minutes.

4994354,4,B006JN87F2,"The Woodcarver began with a teen boy--Matthew--vandalizing a church. His home life is falling apart because of his parents separation and obvious distain for each other. It was hard to watch how his parents treated each other in that scene at the church, the morning after the vandalism.

But as the story progresses, through the influence of one man who uses a simple question--What Would Jesus Do--to look at life and all of its problems, Matthew begins to change. And not only him...but his parents as well.

The acting, in parts, seemed a bit unnatural (especially the father, in my opinion). But, overall, it was well done. Matthew played the part as trouble teenager well! The story plot, also, kept moving at a good pace and, towards the end, I wasn't sure what was going to happen--and was surprised at the small twist it took. The Woodcarver is a good movie to sit down with your family and watch together!

4994355,5,B006JN87F2,"This is one movie I would like to recommend to anyone and in particular, I would like to suggest every Pastor/Youth Group Leader shows it at their very next meeting! Make that an open house and be sure parents sees it as well!

A heartwarming story of people just like you and I, of hurting youth and bewildered parents who try very hard to do the right thing. It is sure to open discussion betwixt generations and communication is so important!

I do no think much has to be said about John Ratzenberger's acting skills. His presence alone with its quiet demeanor and simple and honest faith guarantees any movie to be a winner. Dakota Daulby plays your average angry teenager in need of someone who cares and understand the anger factor behind the vandalism.

The story in itself is nothing new. We see it around us everyday, perhaps even in our own family. But in 'The Woodcarver' the message is clear and sure to reach out no matter how estranged we feel from the ones we love: WWJD? With this simple question, 'Ernest' reaches out to the teenager who destroyed his beautiful carvings and even Matthew's parents. Amazing, the reactions to such thought!

I found the part of the grieving widower to be played with exquisite taste! Love such as 'Ernest' describes is not found everyday. I shall credit the director for knowing when to apply just the right emotion  to the right scene!
As to the beautiful house used as set for this movie, be sure to check out the special features! I am ready to move in!

For my part, I have started to believe angels comes in many shapes (see What if?) and John Ratzenberger might well counsel youths in lieu of acting one day!

A must see for any family and worth 5 stars!!

4994356,4,B006JN87F2,"Frustrated and hurt by his parents' decision to separate, fifteen-year-old Matthew takes his anger out on the church where he learned to pray. Along with breaking stained glass windows and spraying graffiti, he wrecks the exterior handcrafted woodwork.

With the forty-year-old woodwork on the building destroyed and additional needs for the new Sunday School, the pastor calls on the original woodcarver, Ernest, to make all the new woodwork. Ernest's reluctance is dispelled when Matthew's dad, partner in the construction company building the new Sunday School, tries to negotiate a buyout of Ernest's contract.
Matthew is assigned to help repair his damage, and in the process, is drawn to Ernest and his craft that's thousands of years old.

>>>

I liked the movie. Nothing stellar or completely unexpected, just a clean, family movie that wasn't ashamed to demonstrate the teachings of Jesus Christ. WWJD? is the driving force behind the message and ultimate ending. I didn't totally agree with the resolution of Matthew ""needing space"" but they made it work for the most part in the story.

A slight word of caution to parents with younger children: there's realistic arguing (yelling) shown between the parents that might be disturbing, but sadly, that's what many kids deal with on a regular basis. Also, there's a quick action near the end that might frighten them because it's unexpected (trying to avoid spoilers, but just want to give a heads up to parents)

All and all The Woodcarver is a good choice for family movie nights.

4994357,5,B006JN87F2,"When a young troubled boy named Matthew Stevenson decides to destroy the church because of an unanswered prayer, he is caught on video tape and has to be punished. He is ordered by the church deacons to spend his time repairing all the damage he did to avoid persecution. However a lot of the wood work that is destroyed was created by Ernest Otto (John Ratzenberger).

Since losing his wife of forty years to cancer, Ernest has lived a reclusive life and his woodcarving tools have sat unused since his creations at the church many years ago. Now called by the church once more to restore some of the unique carvings to the church, Ernest enlists the aid of Matthew to help him finish on time, otherwise the work will be bid out to competitor wood mill whom his father is forming a partnership with.

Feeling that God doesn't answer prayers, Matthew confesses to Ernest that he prayed for his parents to avoid getting divorced and now fighting and living separate lives, he believes that God has failed him. Yet because God answers prayers in unique and different ways from what we expect, this family will find that anything is possible if one is willing to work hard at it and offer their prayers to God.

I received the DVD, The Woodcarver, compliments of Propeller and Nasser Group North for my honest review and thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful family film. It shows that we need to enjoy what we have in the present more so than ever before because even the prayers we ask, may often times be answered by God in far different ways than we ever imagined. Our family really enjoyed the message of this movie and found it a great way to talk about prayer and how God will often times answer them. While the answers may be different than we expected, it does not mean God doesn't listen or doesn't care. My family rates this movie at 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommends it to anyone looking for great family entertainment.",1331424000,,1929,4.553314121037464
4994358,4,B006JN87F2,"Obviously, the family problems are important to the movie's theme, but I think the point could easily have been made with less stress to the viewer. I thought too much time was spent on the Stevensons' arguing (that kind of stuff drives me crazy and made me anxious while watching). However, Ernest helped tone the overall tension down with his quiet, matter-of-fact manner. I enjoyed the woodworking scenes and Ratzenberger is a natural in his part.

Ernest takes young Matthew under his wing and begins by teaching him 'WWJD' to think about his actions before doing them. WWJD has been overused and abused in the last several years, but I still think it's a wonderfully legitimate question to ask yourself in any situation. What would Jesus do?

Ending somewhat predictably, Ernest's faith helps each troubled family member look at his own selfishness and come back together as a unit where faith and family are more important than money and things.
