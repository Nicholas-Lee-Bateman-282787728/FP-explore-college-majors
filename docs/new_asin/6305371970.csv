7888574,5,6305371970,"This is definately one of the best documentaries I've seen on the Loch Ness Monster. Very convincing that there IS something in Loch Ness, be it a plesiosaur, sturgeon, unknown species, etc...

The recreation of the Surgeon's photo is also interesting, especially the mixed results that make one ponder whether the hoax claim was a hoax itsself.

Anyhow, it's enjoyable, interesting, and proves a point that Loch Ness is still worth researching.",1104105600,3,445,5.166666666666667
7888575,5,6305371970,"This Nova presentation on the mystery of Loch Ness is more riveting than the average television documentary.  It focuses on a modern expedition to discover whether or not there is a creature in Loch Ness.
Unlike most others of this kind, this documentary is well produced both in information and enjoyability.  It is worth watching for the beautiful images of Loch Ness if nothing else.
After visiting Loch Ness myself and speaking with many ""monster hunters,"" I am impressed by the evenhandedness of the program.  One of the best Nova episodes.
I just wish the VHS was a little less expensive.",991785600,6,594,4.861386138613861
