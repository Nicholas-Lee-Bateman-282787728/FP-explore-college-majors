8407481,3,B003WQ3RX6,"The Undertaker (1988) is an Eighties crap fest with atrocious direction and no gore effects.

Absolutely nothing was humorous, gory, scary, or in any way entertaining or interesting. The real problem is that it is not engaging as a slasher.

The Undertaker manages to take the plot of a disturbed undertaker to murder people and the ensuing murder of the people, and make it into a bad, mind-numbing joke.

The film itself is not much to get excited about, but low budget trash doofus Joe Spinell is the disturbed undertaker who really doesn't live up to his master of exploitation hype.",1360108800,,587,4.792079207920792
8407482,2,B003WQ3RX6,"I'm surprised CODE RED wasn't able to obtain a more complete print before releasing this to the public. Hardcore fans hoping to upgrade should just stick with their old bootleg tapes. Pretty much all the GORE from this print has been REMOVED! In the original version we get more graphic bloodshed ala disembowelment, decapitation, a face burnt off in a frying pan, throat slitting, impalement, machete to the face, and more scenes of Spinell talking to and fondling his collection of dead bodies (in a particularly touching scene our Undertaker even spits in the face of one unlucky corpse) -- NONE OF THAT IS ON THIS DVD! Completists as well as casual viewers will be heavily let down by this release. At least the old boot plays out like a real movie. This print is just a mismash of thrown together scenes (mostly out of sequence) and interminable filler. Don't waste your money unless you can find this cheap. Real cheap. CODE RED gets a thumbs down for this one. Thanks, guys!

BUYERS don't be fooled by a slick glossy cover. Seek out real underground trash instead...it's much more rewarding.

THIS HAS BEEN A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. I NOW RETURN CONTROL OF AMAZON TO YOU!",1306022400,16,1183,4.765853658536585
