7902534,5,B000003K5W,"This is what Star Trek's SUPPOSED to be all about -- real people courageously risking their lives because they want to know what's out there, and because they BELIEVE in what they do.  What's great about this episode is that, for one of the few times in Star Trek, we actually get more than a short peak at the lives of people besides the main characters who make up a starship.  FINALLY!  This is a great idea in and of itself, and a lot better than just having the non-main character in a red shirt get killed in the first 5-10 minutes of the show! :)  Besides that, what focusing on some OTHER, lower-ranking characters for a change does for us is give us a very different perspective (in this case, a bunch of ensigns) on the the series' giants (Picard, Riker, Worf, etc.).  Very interesting, and very rewarding!  And, to top it all off, this is an exciting story, and an emotionally moving one as well.  Great stuff...I just wish Star Trek would do more of these types of episodes!",998524800,7,986,4.414364640883978

Alexander Enberg (as Ensign Taurik) reminded  was we adore Vulcans so much - a very effective performance.",940118400,7,283,5.2444444444444445
