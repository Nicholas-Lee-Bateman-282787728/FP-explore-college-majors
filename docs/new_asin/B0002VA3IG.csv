8032694,5,B0002VA3IG,"The Columbo series shows Peter Falk at his best....Dissheveled, bumbling, pretending to be a poor excuse for a Detective. However, underneath all this ""cover"" is television's greatest Cop!! While mistaking evidence for a stale doughnut (his breakfast), he gradually zero's in on the killer. Almost, as if by accident, he finally nails the culprit (usually someone who thinks of him/herself, as being about 100 IQ points higher than the sloppy, apologetic Detective).....Columbo is totally enjoyable. Many episodes are worth watching 8 - 10 times. Had Falk not become ill I believe he could have played this role until he was 90, or older!!",1381795200,,639,5.213592233009709

One scene stays in the memory after having seen this episode, it's the scene that happens right after the murder of Mrs. Lenore Kennicut. Brimmer, the murderer, imagines all he will have to do to get rid of the corpse and to make disappear the evidences. The director uses then the split screen technique, in vogue since the end of the sixties, to show us Brimmer's actions on his own spectacles, using the glasses as two TV sets with two different programmes. This scene alone is worth five stars.

8032697,5,B0002VA3IG,"Robert Culp, forever known as Bill Cosby's co-star on ""I Spy,"" made the first of four guest-starring romp's on Peter Falk's classic show with the superbly crafted ""Death Lends a Hand.""  Culp must protect his security business by doing away with a client's wife that can be Culp's undoing.  Patricia Crowley is the doomed wife of hubby Ray Milland and both performers make great work in their small but essential parts.

As is the case with each ""Columbo"" installment, the bulk of the drama deals with the detective playing against the culprit, revealed in the first act of the show...and both Falk and Culp relish their screen time together.

There is also some genuine great camera work as Culp disposes of the body and cleans up after his crime.

This first-season entry is one of the best of series.",1107388800,4,802,4.741007194244604
8032698,5,B0002VA3IG,"This is the second episode of the first season. The original airdate is October 6, 1971. This is the second episode aired but is actually the first one filmed after the two pilots which came before. As is the case for most Columbo episodes this one is a quality production far above most TV series. This episode deals with a private investigator who goes bad and kills the wife of one of his clients. Excellent drama.",1106611200,,417,4.5
