8097404,5,B000CCD24W,"Buzzati's short stories are very unique, and 'The Tartar Steppe' (the original translation of the title of the book) is a masterpiece.

The movie is set in an unbelievable location, an old fortress in Iran that has since been destroyed by an earthquake (note: the movie was shot before the revolution). The movie delivers the essence and the message of the story very powerfully, in a way that - I dare say - only Italians can do.

A must-see that may change your life, but seems to have been largely unnoticed...

And if you liked the movie, find the 2-page passage in the book that describes the flow of life... you will never forget it",1365552000,,638,4.530434782608696
8097405,4,B000CCD24W,"The Desert Of The Tartars (Il Deserto Dei Tartari) is a film that has been described as a cross between Beau Geste and Waiting For Godot, and into that mix I would toss some of the films of Hiroshi Teshigahara, especially Woman In The Dunes, as well as the troop interactions seen in the 1960s American television sitcom F Troop, even though The Desert Of The Tartars is not a comedy. This is because the slow moving and contemplative first half of the film follows the setting up of the main military officer characters between each other, and with their men, while the second half of the film speeds up the pace of the diegetic time, and focuses more on the reactions of the officers to the world outside their fortress, rather than within it. The reason for these comparisons are that, unlike three of those four mentioned influences, this 140 minute long, color, 1976 film, by Italian director, Valerio Zurlini, with a screenplay by Andr G. Brunelin, based on a novel by Dino Buzzati, called The Tartar Steppe, is a film almost hermetically sealed from laughter. Having stated that, it's not a film that is overly somber. It is the sort of film, like those in the canons of Bela Tarr, Theo Angelopolous, and John Cassavetes, that is simply nonpareil, in the sense that there really is no other film like it, for good or ill. Overwhelmingly, I'd claim that the film's difference is overwhelmingly for the positive, but there are a few negatives that keep the film in the near-great category, rather than that of the unequivocally great.",1340236800,,1539,4.703703703703703
8097406,5,B000CCD24W,"Valerio Zurlini's The Desert of the Tartars (1976) is a relatively unknown Italian classic.  Zurlini's other works, most notably Estate Violenta (1959) and Indian Summer (1972), haven't fared much better.  However, as a result of his lack of popularity, the personal joy of ""discovering"" such a interesting and haunting film becomes all the sweeter.

At first blush, the lack of popularity kind of makes sense -- The Desert of the Tartars is ostensibly a war movie but there's not a single scene of action.  Nor do we really ever ""see"" the ""enemy"", if they even exist.  Likewise, at a prohibitive length of 140 minutes, few can muster the courage (and attention span) to sit down and watch it (an activity that took multiple sittings/days for me).  The complete and utter lack of female characters also is somewhat off putting.

At second blush, these (at least mine) preconceptions change (d).  That cast is truly astounding.  Zurlini gathered some of the best European (mostly French) actors of the day, including Philippe Noiret, Jacques Perrin, Jean - Louis Trintignant, Vittorio Gassman, and even, Max von Sydow.  Secondly, film is partially filmed in Iran at the stunningly beautiful locale of Bam fortress (now destroyed by a recent earthquake in Iran).  Although most of the actual filming was done in a citadel set constructed near by, the cinematography fully utilizes the haunting vistas of endless desert and crumbling (deserted) buildings seen from the fortress.

Adapted from Dino Buzzati's famous novel, The Tartar Steppe, the plot follows the first assignment of a naive young glory seeking lieutenant Drogo (Jacques Perrin) to an isolated fortress on the edges of Empire (Empire in the most universal/archetypal/timeless sense).  Here, he meets various other members of the army who have retreated into the daily military regiment and facade (dinners, ceremonies, drills, etc) and developed unusual foibles waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  And waiting -- for the enemy, whoever they might be, to come.  Waiting for an enemy which they have never seen but fear.  Fear so intense that the slightest disregard for military procedure results in death.  The Colonel, impeccable acted by Philippe Vittorio Gassman, a melancholy cloistered man, exudes power from the distances.  The doctor (Jean - Louis Trintignant) treats an officer with a mysterious illness perhaps caused by this waiting.  Drogo seeks every excuse to leave this citadel of perpetual waiting.

And we wait with them.  We watch the endless repetition of life.  We see their characters develop and age and retreat from the world.  Various occurrences take place, a white tartar horse is seen in the distance.  A officer discovers lights seen only by a very powerful set of binoculars -- months pass, they move no closer, the powerful binoculars are confiscated for fear of unsubstantiated rumors.  Our characters grow old.  The fortress is slowly abandoned.

Zurlini has creating a haunting gem.  The Desert of the Tartars, is a meditation on suppressed emotion, the futility of war, the physiological effects of continuous fear and tension....  However, perhaps intentionally, the audience suffers along on this slow, laborious, endless, repetitive journey.  The acting is impeccable, the scenery is stunning, the direction is competent.  If a beautiful, meditative, slow movie is right up your ally then this is completely worth a viewing.  Zurlini has been ignored for far too long.  By far one of the best Italian dramas I've seen.",1279411200,2,3510,5.229390681003585
8097407,5,B000CCD24W,"Like Tarkovsky, Antonioni, Beckett, etc?  A great big balloon of images with nothing inside, just like life itself.  A masterpiece of muteness.  Plus, if you wish, there's political significance, too, like Joseph Roth's novel _Radetzky March_ (or the excellent film version made in Austria in the early 60s).",1272844800,,308,5.375
8097408,4,B000CCD24W,"Very little happens in Valerio Zurlini's The Desert of the Tartars two-and-a-half hours, which is exactly the point, as Jacques Perrin's initially ambitious young officer is posted to a magnificent desert fort overlooking the spectacular ruins of an ancient city on a non-existent border where soldiers wait endlessly for a possibly imagined enemy to give a sense of focus and purpose to their lives. Yet the Tartars remain the stuff of rumours and legends, the visually striking fort (Arge-E-Bam in Iran) a quietly malignant place, its very walls infested with an unidentifiable disease that slowly destroys its inhabitants. Yes, we're in allegory territory here, with the human condition distilled down to waiting and planning for a moment that may never happen, with all the malaise that entails, and it's a film you're either going to be drawn into or find two-and-a-half hours of pure tedium. One of the few films to show how cold and inhospitable the desert can be, there are vague similarities to the considerably less successful Fort Saganne in the way it undermines the expectations of a Beau Geste-like adventure in favour of the malaise and unrealised expectation that was really the stuff of a career-killing desert posting. With an impressively varied international cast - Max Von Sydow, Phillipe Noiret, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Helmut Griem and Fernando Rey among them - and boasting fine cinematography by Luciano Tovoli, it's not for all tastes but it certainly casts a spell on those it ensnares.

NoShame's DVD offers a fine 1.85:1 transfer, though there is some slight droppoff and wobble in the soundtrack (more music than dialogue). Extras include a 35 minute interview with Tovoli, trailer, stills gallery and a bonus CD of Ennio Morricone's brooding, oppressive score.",1181260800,4,1791,5.21875
8097409,5,B000CCD24W,"This film is based on a novel by Dino Buzzati called The Tartar Steppe (1945). And its a great novel. Much of what Dino Buzzati writes would be classified as fantasy but this novel has a pellucid realism to it that anchors it in a kind of unspecified present. The novel begs comparison with Franz Kafka's more gothic parables, Albert Camus' The Plague, and Julien Gracq's very similarly focused The Opposing Shore. The novel is existential and it examines man's capacity to cope with the meaningless of his existence but it does so in such a unique way. Never in Buzzati's novel do we feel manipulated by any heavy-handed philosophy, rather the appeal of the novel is its unobtrusively plain, though beautiful, style and structure that nonetheless capture your imagination.

Valerio Zurlini is not a name you are likely to have heard before. His adaptation of Buzzati's book --The Desert of the Tartar (1976)-- was his last film and he executes the project so perfectly that I am very curious to investigate his earlier work.

A quick glance at the cast list (Max Von Sydow, Philipe Noiret) will show that the film is full of top-notch actors, but the real star of this film is the desert and the fort itself that seems to have grown out of the desert.  The desert and the fort have immense mythic allure and though there is nothing fantastic about the desert or the fort the effect this location and structure have on the soldiers stationed there is profound and disturbing. The fort is like a mirage on the precipice of a vast desert but the fort and desert are real and men must live in this location for years at a stretch. Most men would find that being assigned to such a location would be a death sentence and this is what Lt. Drogo thinks when he first sets eyes upon the desert fortress that looks like a forgotten ruin. But soon the fortress (and its mysterious history), its eccentric occupants and the way they deal with the various rumours of foreign troops maneuvering in the distance, and the desert itself seduce the young Lt. into staying for longer and longer stretches until we realize that Lt. Drogo, like so many soldiers before him, will never leave. The film can be viewed as a parable about military duty, but it can also be viewed as a parable about commitments of any kind. Like any good parable there is no one penultimate reading. The movie works on the viewer like the desert and fort work on the soldiers; at times you find you are bored and you desperately want those Tartar invaders to finally make an appearance but despite the fact that next to nothing happens you cannot take your eyes away.

What drama there is takes place within the fort, mostly but not exclusively (I don't want to spoil the film so I won't reveal too much). Most of the drama is between the soldiers themselves. Each soldier seems to suffer from some kind of debility; some soldiers seem to suffer from some kind of virus that the fort doctor is convinced is caused or aggravated by the damp conditions of the fort itself.  Other soldiers seem to suffer from various forms of hallucinations or visions of grandeur which seem hopelessly misplaced in the vast emptiness of the desert.

It is fascinating to watch Lt. Drogo slowly age before our very eyes. When he first arrives he is an enthusiastic and ambitious young officer who wants to prove himself in battle but with the passing years he seems to become more and more resigned to his fate. Thus you can also read this film as simply a parable of man's life tenure.

However you view the film its a spellbinding experience. I think the film cannot be reduced to any one reading; it seems to elude any literal meaning we might attempt to assign to it.

Highly recommend both book and film.",1153267200,25,3749,4.593423019431988
8097410,5,B000CCD24W,"I must confess this formidable film was the final product of a fortunate accident. I watched it by TV cable and due the presence of such legendary cast, it was a true must-see.

Valerio Zurlini was practically an unknown Italian director who, nevertheless, made his last Opus and at the meantime his supreme masterpiece.

The powerful significance of this metaphorical film exceeds the most encomiast epithets. In the middle of the desert there is an inexpugnable garrison, in which will coexist a group of distinguished although well different militaries; each one of them maintains crucial and particular vision about what will the next step to follow. And thanks to this admirable and solid script we will explore one by one, the gradual process of madness and isolation when the pretended combat never comes.

I don' t have any doubt to equal this glorious film at the same level of Apocalypse Now or Paths of Glory or All quiet in the Western Front.

It's time for you and the great audiences all over the world, to know about its existence. This is Giant film absolutely ignored and minimized in which its stature concerns. And I consider it among my top Fifty Great Films of any Age.

Go for this jewel and you will certainly agree with me.",1140566400,13,1247,4.75462962962963
