My subjective response was positive in that Leinsdorf did a fine job with a fine orchestra and soloists in handling Beethoven, the reason for buying the disc. The picture is finely delineated and the sound excellent within the limits of the technology.
That said, in comparison with the brilliant Strauss - Ariadne auf Naxos, with Beverly Sills, there was none of the interplay among singers possible even within the concert format. Here what one gets is the music, the instrumentalists sitting and playing, the singers in place singing and silent and a conductor being only as lively as directing the  proceedings required.
To me, that means closing my eyes or watching provided equal experiences.
That raises the question as to whether you might not be better served by a first rate CD offering the best of modern technology or a contemporary DVD with better sound and color (and, I suppose, in some cases, an opening up to pictures beyond the concert stage).
