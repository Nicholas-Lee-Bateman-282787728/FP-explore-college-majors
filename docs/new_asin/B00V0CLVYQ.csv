8708914,5,B00V0CLVYQ,"I got this double one disc dvd set (The Laugh Out Loud Double Feature)of the Mr. Deeds movie and Click film from my job due to the cheap price and my previous familiarity with the Mr. Deeds movie. The dvd option allows you to choose whichever movie you would like to see first.  Click is a science fiction type of film that stars Adam Sandler as a successful architect named Michael Newman. Michael Newman loves his wife Donna Newman (Kate Beckinsale) and wants to also provide the best life for his kids Ben (Jospeh Castannon) and Samantha (Danielle Tatum). Newmans life changes dramatically during a trip to Bed Bath and Beyond, when a mysterious person named Morty  (Christopher Walken) gives him a remote control that allows him to skip through certain parts of his life.  Donna Newmans best friend Janine (Jennifer Coolidge) seemingly thinks that her friends has a charmed life and husband while unintentionally overlooking what he has to go through in order to provide for his family. There are countless celebrity appearances in the film as well (David Hasselhoff, Sean Astin, Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, James Earl Jones, Rachel Dratch, Robert Schneider etc). Music featured in this movie are songs such as Show Me The Way by Peter Frampton,  Hold The Line by Toto, and Linger by The Cranberries. The lead singer of the Cranberries (Dolores ORiordan) also makes an appearance in the film. What pleasantly surprised me the most about Click was the spiritual slant to the film Click when Morty eventually reveals to Michael Newman who he really is.  The film Good Deeds stars Adam Sandler as Longfellow deeds whose world transforms dramatically once he finds out that he is set to inherit billions from a late uncle named Preston Blake (Harve Presnell)who he never met.  Longfellow Deeds finds out that news from Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher) and Cecil Anderson (Erick Avari) both high-level employees of Blake Media.  Longfellow actually enjoys working at a pizzeria, delivering to various customers such as Crazy Eyes (Steve Buscemi) and residing in Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire.  One of Longfellows employees Jan (Conchatta Ferrell)even mentions how Deeds is actually an owner of the pizzeria. He ends up considering a permanent stay in New York after he meets and falls in love with Babe Bennett (Wynona Ryder) a tv reporter.  He also enjoys his new residence in New York and gets along with one of the employees linked with Blake Media Emilio Lopez (John Tutturo). Babe Bennett ends up encountering an ethical dilemma of covering up her true job from Longfellow Deeds in order to gather essential information and in hopes that her boss Mac McGrath will give her a promotion and pay rise. Of course, there are more actors/actresses affiliated with this movie and some of the following music is featured in Mr. Deeds; The Sweetest Thing by U2, Where Are You Going by the Dave Matthews Band, You Dont Know How It Feels by Tom Petty, Sing by Travis etc.",1442361600,,2962,4.908
