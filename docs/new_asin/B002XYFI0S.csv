8602950,5,B002XYFI0S,I loved this drama.  I normally don't go for Taiwanese dramas but this show held my attention for two days with very little sleep I was so busy watching the drama.  If your basketball enthusiast and love romance this show is a great combination of both and worth the money.,1374624000,,273,4.44
