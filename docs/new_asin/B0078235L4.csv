5063351,5,B0078235L4,Excellent documentary presented by a first rate narrator. Highly recommend,1466553600,2,74,6.5
5063352,3,B0078235L4,"This show is great for entertainment and ideas on Medieval life.
Mr. Loades makes it fun to watch.
Editing makes the show appear 'choppy' when watched without commercials.
Main complaint is the ""Closed Captioning"", checked it on three different systems and displayed words are 'jumbled' for much of the show.",1462147200,2,308,5.18
5063353,5,B0078235L4,My husband thoroughly enjoyed it and will rewatch,1453420800,,49,5.25
5063354,5,B0078235L4,"Possibly one of the finest things I've ever seen on television. I had to own it! There is so much ""new information"" contained in this presentation of Medieval history, that it is far more interesting than Hollywoods rendition of the subject! WOW",1444089600,3,245,4.857142857142857
5063355,5,B0078235L4,"Excellent documentary, I saw it first on History Channel. Now I shall enjoy it every time I wish to. Nice British accents, too.",1438646400,2,127,4.565217391304348
5063356,5,B0078235L4,"I always love Mike Loades' passion for history and recreating it. He's so passionate about his subject that he makes even mundane things like brushing teeth interesting. I've seen many programs on knights and castles, and some of that is covered here, but the real focus is the every day life of medieval people, both nobility and peasants. Technology, pastimes, customs, and more are covered. While no documentary can perfectly cover everything, this is a great overview of Medieval life with a variety of topics covered.",1436659200,7,522,5.0813953488372094
5063357,5,B0078235L4,"You can always tell when someone has a real passion for a subject and Mr. Loades clearly shows his passion for medieval history in this program.  I saw it on cable on a Sunday morning and by the 20 minute mark knew I would have to have a copy of it on the shelf.  You get the sense that hours of interesting facts were left on the editing room floor, because Mr. Loades has one factoid after another to share.  I highly recommend this for anyone with even a basic interest in history.",1432080000,7,484,4.182795698924731

8512248,5,B0078235L4,This was a favorite of the students this year! The narrator reenacts what it was really like in Medieval times - no romanticizing!,1528588800,,130,4.695652173913044
8512249,5,B0078235L4,"a very fascinating dvd and worth every penny, that is if you are interested in history and weapons.",1525564800,,99,4.555555555555555
8512250,1,B0078235L4,I have no idea about this DVD. It will not play. (And no it's NOT my player. It plays all region and I watched a show before and after trying this DVD.) It did arrive on time and in good condition.,1520985600,,197,3.8292682926829267
8512251,5,B0078235L4,"Very interesting.  The section on castle construction is very good and demonstrates how sophisticated medieval engineering was.  Mike Loades delivers with a lot of energy and knowledge.  Mr Loades has done other excellent documentaries of this period, this one is my favorite.  Mr. Loades has also written several books on medieval archery and weapons, all very good",1516924800,,366,5.368421052631579

8512253,5,B0078235L4,I really found this dvd fascinating. It covers so much of the average medieval life. If you are fascinated by medieval life and times then please buy this DVD. Mike Loades is an excellent presenter.,1486684800,,198,4.685714285714286
