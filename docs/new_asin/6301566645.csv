7812745,3,6301566645,The scene with the fille de joie was deftly handled as the young protagonist found himself in a strange new world ready & willing  to be led down the lane of love.  The director should have been much more sensitive in his entire treatment of the youth' s experiences!,1433721600,,267,4.428571428571429

7812747,3,6301566645,"OK i'll give it three stars because I was mildly entertained and intrigued with the concept of an Awkward skinny dweeb trying to get it on with his hot estranged mom with he whom he was reunited with during a vacation getaway in some rich snobby french resort..Now as for the noticeable flaws to this movie, What stood out was how physically awkward and uncoordinated the son was with just about everything including his dancing and his overall approach to women. Even his diolouge with people was blunt, rude, and unrealistic. Then his constant perverted curiouslity toward his Mom made me come to the overall conclusion  that this kid was seriously disturbed or perhaps borderline retarded. And finally toward the end, I just found it absurd that his mom found the concept of incest acceptable for a one time situation. Then the last scene portrays the whole family together having a big laugh as if the incident between the Mom and the Son will never emotionally scar either at any point of their lives. Common is this normal, may be for the french it is I guess.",1215043200,2,1066,4.7005347593582885
7812748,5,6301566645,"Louis Malle's sensitive and delicate look at sexual initiation. Set in 1954, Benoit Ferreux plays a 14-year-old boy from Dijon; his father is a cold, uncaring gynecologist; his mother (played brilliantly by Lea Massari) is a free spirit. He contracts scarlet fever, which cause a heart murmur, and goes with his mother for a cure to a hotel/spa. He meets some girls there, and Massari openly sees a lover; she doesn't hide anything about this from him - in fact, she openly solicits his sympathies when she leaves her lover rather than go off with him. Massari's and Ferreux's closeness is gradually developed until they go to bed together. This act of incest is a special moment for both, and Malle must be praised for not exploiting it or making it sordid. Massari, as I said, is excellent, and it's not an easy role to play. The movie is both a commentary on the vapidness of the French bourgeoisie and an affirmation of life on a personal level. There is also a great Charlie Parker musical score. A wonderful movie all around.",1135555200,12,1031,4.670329670329671

Louis Malle directed this affectionate story of a young man's coming of age.(Coming of age filmes usually make me ill, what a welcome exception!)
 When a 14-year-old boy from a bourgeois (but wild , anarchistic and delightfully mischief) home is sent to a sanitarium  health reasons, he learns that ""mamma knows best"".

(To tell you what she knows, well..,if  I reveal the ""secret"" of the movie that almost got it censored...)

Pappa is a gyneocologist, mamma a bedda  Italiana , daughter of a political exile who married into the rich gentry in  Dijon France, a world strange to her as she is for them.

 Laurent ( or ""Renzinno"", his Italian appellation of mamma's affections) is the central character,
a 15 year old, Charlie Parker (and bebop jazz in general) loving, Albert Camus reading ""hipster-atheist-existentialist"".  he and his crazy brothers take it to the stuffy adults, and  upper class French society in general ~ madcap, but not slapstick!
THis movie has some great dialogue! (Helps to know French , as the dialogue is much better than subtitles reveal.)

A comic and, at the time, quite scandalous motion picture.

With Benoit Ferreux as the our young stalwart  Renzino
 and Lea Massari as his sensuous mom.(imagine , Claudia Cardinale, Sofia Loren, and Vera Bloom wrapped into one!

She is unbeleivable, a real delight!)
  Watch  especially for the dinner  ""spinach  tennis"" match, but  so many scenes worth the price of the movie alone! .

1000 stars under a French sky!",1074643200,15,1521,5.016064257028113
7812750,5,6301566645,"Unbridled youth is very powerful in this somewhat tongue-in-cheek coming of age romp from the French master. The boys are your Menendez brothers en petit. They are arrogant, mean to the servants, sell the family jewels, paintings and carpets, drink to excess, attend whore houses with their stolen money and put up with lecherous priests in the day time. Mom has a lover and is bored with Dad, but she loves her little boy, 14-year-old Laurent, played with a ""youth will be served"" confidence by Benoit Ferreux, whose ""coming of age"" is perhaps a Louis Malle fantasy from his own youth.

There is the usual deft and warm Malle touch as he explores some verboten sexual ground and manages to have it all come out as charmingly sweet as a French musical farce. En route he parodies the post-war decadence of the French during the fifties as he satirizes Albert Camus, the war in Vietnam (pre-US involvement) and the Catholic church. One scene moves to another as though there was a fire to get to. Malle gives us what is necessary and runs into the next scene relying heavily on the camera to carry the story with minimal dialogue.
This film should be seen and contrasted with Malle's homage to a pre-adolescent Brooke Shields in his American film, Pretty Baby (1978) where the camera tends to linger. Here he celebrates the randy adolescent charm of Ferreux perhaps to excess. But then, I'm sure to some, 12-year-old Brooke Shields must have been a yawn. The amazing thing about Malle is his ability to openly address taboo subject matter and do it in a way that disarms would-be critics. His secret I think is his deep affection for his characters and his emphasis on our ability to overcome and to heal. Malle, more than almost any film maker I can think of, keeps sex in perspective and does not over react to sexual differences.
Incidentally I was intrigued to discover that Malle's first film was the ground-breaking under water documentary The Silent World (1956) made in collaboration with the legendary Jacque-Yves Cousteau.",1009670400,32,2031,4.8028571428571425
