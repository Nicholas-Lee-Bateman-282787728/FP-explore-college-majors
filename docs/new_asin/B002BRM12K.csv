John Sturges directed these westerns and Dimitri Tiompkin scored both. His booming music track dominates ""Gun Hill"" while it's properly in the background on ""OK Corral."" The latter picture has a superb theme, sung by Frankie Laine. Tiompkin, who composed it, deftly quotes phrases from this tune throughout the movie.

LAST TRAIN FROM GUN HILL bears a slight resemblance to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-10-TO-YUMA/dp/B000TGJ82Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3:10 TO YUMA</a>&nbsp;(1957). Both stories have a lawman under siege; he and a prisoner are in a hotel room awaiting a train out of town while several armed men who seek to free the shackled fellow lay in wait on the street. That's where the similarity ends, however.

Here, Kirk Douglas is the sheriff that travels to Gun Hill in search of two men who sexually assaulted and killed his Native American wife. One of them is the only son of Kirk's old friend, a man who once saved his life. During the intervening years, Anthony Quinn has so prospered, he's now the power in little Gun Hill. Douglas captures Quinn's  son (Earl Holliman) in a saloon; the father resolves that his boy will never be brought to trial, even if it means Kirk's death.

GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL (1956) is a highly entertaining if historically inaccurate telling of the famous showdown between the Earp brothers and Doc Holliday vs. the Clanton and McLowery clans. Burt Lancaster and Douglas have play well off each other and the fight itself is most enervating. ""O.K."" has a stronger cast and is the better of this pairing, but only by a little.
