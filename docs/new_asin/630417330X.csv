802590,4,630417330X,"""Betty Boop:  The Definitive Collection"" documents the highs and lows of this classic cartoon character.  The eight-volume set includes virtually every Boop short from 1930 to 1939, even her cameo appearances in  Max and Dave Fleischer's ""Screen Song"" cartoons.  The first four  volumes  focus on the Depression-era, pre-Code period, with plenty of freewheeling surrealism and risque humor from Betty, Bimbo and Koko the Clown. ""Minnie the Moocher,"" ""Snow  White"" and ""I Heard"" remain animation classics, featuring  terrific music by Cab Calloway and Don Redman. Of course, you're also stuck  with the remaining four volumes, which focus largely on the toned-down,  more domesticated version of Betty Boop during 1935-39.  There are a few  gems in these later volumes, such as the cartoons with Grampy the inventor,  but many miss the mark - particularly those featuring Betty's cute dog,  Pudgy.  If you're a Boop completist, the ""Definitive Collection""  is a must. Otherwise, you may want to buy a more selective Fleischer  compilation, such as the excellent ""Betty Boop Confidential"" or  ""Betty Boop: Special Collector's Edition.""",945043200,36,1133,5.4508670520231215

802674,5,630417330X,"I don't know why it took me ten years to buy this collection. I don't remember enjoying these shorts as much when Amc was showing them in the late 1980's on the weekends. They're almost as funny as the cartoons  produced at the whitehouse, the creativity and intellect was certainly superior. I highly recommend this set, even being that the format is vhs. I decided not to wait for the more user friendly dvd version to be released, as there is nothing to guarantee that it will be as complete, or as well made, or even if they will be offered at all. One thing is certain about this collection ; a lot of time and research went into this project, it shows in the the presentation and packaging. As mentioned in other reveiws, I too would have prefered them to be in chronological order instead of arranged by theme, and a companion booklet would have been nice also. Don't wait, if you're anything like me, and see what's on the television, you probably need good hard laughs as soon as possible.",1145750400,4,998,4.483516483516484
802675,4,630417330X,"This VHS collection, is the only ""official"" release of Betty Boop cartoons from Republic. It has all the cartoons, except one with Popeye and three or four others, considered lost back in 1998, when this collection first released (those cartoons already ""re-discovered"" on various private collections worldwide, maybe a future DVD collection gonna have them).

The picture and the sound quality is great, compared the usual public domain DVDs you may have seen the last years.

There is a problem through: It is called ""Digital Noise Reduction"" and it is the nightmare of the animation fans! This set here, is the obvious example of how bad DNR can be, when we use it on Cartoons. Beyond that, it is an excellent choice for Betty Boop fans, now!",1112227200,7,745,4.858267716535433
802676,4,630417330X,"It might be worth buying the first few volumes separately and just leaving out the last ones - unless you have a young kid in your family, who will probably enjoy them.  It's very sad to see Betty end her wild career as a middle-class sweater-wearing schoolteacher catering to a cute puppy (just as it was depressing to see how they domesticated Popeye in his later years) - but the early ""surrealist"" cartoons more than make up for the duds.  They're worth seeing for the Cab Calloway numbers alone, and for their visual originality and imagination.  There was integration of live action and animation in some episodes, I believe well before Disney ever thought of it, and the ""out of the inkwell"" idea was also original in its time.

This is a well-made collection, with very good visual and sound quality, and it's a great look into the early history of American animation.  And Betty herself is a character who will live forever!  It's just a shame the series isn't avaiable on DVD.",1106352000,3,986,4.670520231213873
802677,5,630417330X,"If you love Betty Boop, this collection will not disappoint.  My only complaint is that it is not available on DVD.  The transfers are excellent, many are better than those on DVD collections I've come across.",1101513600,5,209,4.777777777777778
802678,5,630417330X,"""Definitive"" is an excellent word to describe this most complete collection of cartoons from one of the most enduring stars of 1930's Hollywood.
It is missing only a handful of Boop cartoons, but those are believed lost forever and have never surfaced on any video collection that I'm aware of.  In addition, the prints are generally struck from the best, uncut copies available.  The collection also includes several ""politically incorrect"" cartoons that are never shown on any of the cable networks, and the set also includes a brief video history of Betty narrated by Max Fleischer's son, director Richard Fleischer.  Despite an earlier reviewer's assertion, only one Betty cartoon was ever filmed in color - ""Poor Cinderella"" - and it appears here in all it's two-color glory.
Without a doubt, the early cartoons that feature Betty teamed with boyfriend Bimbo and Koko the Klown are head and shoulders above the rest, especially when teamed with a Cab Calloway song.  ""Bimbo's Initiation"" and ""Snow White"" are perhaps the finest examples of the surrealistic style of cartoon the Fleischer Brothers excelled at.  ""Is My Palm Red"" is Betty at her risque best, before the Hays Office censors toned down her act.  Of the latter shorts, only those with Grampy rise above the pedestrian.  Alas, Betty went to cartoon heaven not with a bang, but with a whimper.
For any fan of animation in general and Betty in particular, this collection is THE ""must-have!""",1040860800,23,1455,5.012448132780083
802679,5,630417330X,"Betty Boop is so adorable whether on calandars, posters, or starring in movies.  Because Betty Boop's movie career ended in 1939 I know she existed well before I was born.  There should be more movies sold to us younger people who wanna Boop-Oop-A-Doop all the time.  I say this video collection deservs a 10.",1040774400,5,309,4.685185185185185
802680,4,630417330X,"This Betty Boop collection is very good and a must for a true Betty collector but the videos are available separately and certain volumes may be of more interest to individuals and thus a better buy.  The buyer can purchase the volumes with content of interest to him/her.  An example is the volumes with Pudgy the Pooch, NOT of interest to most Betty fans.  There are problems with this collection, the first is it is incomplete though this is probabaly due to the fact that some films are lost (maybe forever).  There is no color, even on the cartoons that were made in color.  Finally I feel the films should have been in chronological order rather than the ""catagory"" volumes used (""pre-code"", musical, etc.)  This would have allowed viewing the changes in the characters as they occured and would also have allowed fans of a certain era to by the period they wanted.  Other than these it is a good collection and the picture quality is very good and the sound, in most cases, is very good and un-tampered-with (cleaned up but without adding new sounds).  For Betty fans it is a good buy.",970099200,30,1092,4.592783505154639
802681,5,630417330X,"Though I don't own this collection (though I would definitely buy the whole thing!), I did see many of those wonderful old-time cartoons featuring our longest-living and most beloved flapper ever invented on a  cel sheet with her kewpie doll-like baby face so coyly wreathed by those  cunning little black ringlets and completed with big, round fluffy-lashed  eyes and that tiny beestung lips right underneath her little button nose!
 Believe it or not, our animated sweetheart had once been a singing  anthropomorphic dog with a famous voice by the real, live nightclub singer.  Then she became human and continued to trot flirtatously through a whole  parade of dreamy cartoon shorties, accompanied by her very comical buddies  like Koko the Klown, Bimbo the talking dog, and Gramps the eldery inventor  who lives upstairs and sometimes helps her out in her time of need. Some of  Betty Boop's wacky adventures are quite innocent and very imaginative with  a fantastical 3-D background; others are quite naughty and even racy at  times.
 Now at the very dawn of the new millennium, our very plucky  young heroine continues to win many a heart and would appear in a  motorcycle garb, a hippie costume, a very slinky nightgown complete with a  long feathery boa, whatever you could imagine her in! But her classic  outfit is of course a seductive little tiny black dress with a very curly  hemline as well as a perky little garter at her nubile young thigh and  tappity-tapping high heels!

7863977,5,630417330X,"This set of 8 VHS tapes is the absolutely best restoration of these priceless Betty Boop cartoons available. This fine set of VHS tapes traces the history of one of cartoons only starring females, and is relatively complete. This boxed set of VHS tapes is beautiful and forms a neat picture of Betty when assembled in the correct order. In volume one, you'll see Betty as she was still a puppy dog with long ears co starring with Bimbo. Her floppy poodle ears eventually became hoop earrings, and her black poodle nose became a girl's button-like nose. The mad wild cartoons with jazz musicians like Cab Calloway and Louis Armstrong are worth the price of admission alone.
My only question is why oh why have these versions of these cartoon films not been transferred to a set of DVDs yet?",1359158400,,789,4.642857142857143
7863978,4,630417330X,"After suffering through years of trying to find as much Betty Boop as I could through public domain collections of varying quality, I finally decided to break down and buy a used copy of this set here on Amazon, and despite the cons I'll mention in just a bit, I'm glad I did. I've not yet finished watching all eight volumes, but what I have watched has been a very fun treat, full of plenty of risque humor, surrealistic imagery, and just overall good times.

This set, curated by animation historian and fanboy Jerry Beck, pulls together eight VHS tapes, each of which contains two themed programs for a total of 90-110 minutes in length, with the exception of the first volume, which only contains one themed program and is little more than an hour in length. Some might bemoan the fact that the cartoons are presented this way as opposed to chronologically, and I would be perfectly happy with such a presentation, but I have no issue with this presentation either. There are 115 shorts here and little over 13 hours of viewing pleasure. Pretty much every short is in this collection, with the exception of a few that, to my knowledge, are still lost or in private collections and Betty's cameo in the very first Popeye cartoon. Most seem to be struck from the best available prints, with a very few even retaining their Paramount opening logos. (Most feature no opening studio logo, a UM&M TV card, and a few use an NTA card.) ""Poor Cinderella"" is presented in its original two-color-process glory, all others in their original B&W - except for one, which I'll get to.

The packaging of this box set is to die for. The box is made to be displayed with the spines lining up to form Betty's face. Inside the box is a booklet titled ""Boopliography."" One does wish there was a chronological listing of the cartoons within the booklet, but what IS in the booklet is a fun read.

So this set sounds completely perfect, right? Not really. There's two cons that have caused me to remove one star from what would otherwise be a perfect five-star rating.

The first con is that the 1932 cartoon ""Romantic Melodies"" on volume 4 is actually not the original version. In the original version, Bimbo and his band serenade Betty, then it cuts to singer Arthur Tracy and a bouncing ball sequence, and goes back to an animated sequence. Here, we only have the first half. And it's not even the original version of THAT - it's a B&W transfer of a re-colored version. In the 1960's and 1970's, several Betty Boop shorts were colorized by re-tracing the original animation onto new cells, that were then colored. This was done cheaply by not doing every single frame, causing the fluidity of motion to be severely compromised. Other mistakes occur, including changing the word ""delicatessen"" on a storefront to the word ""delafates."" The complete original short IS out there and can be found on YouTube, so no idea why Republic Pictures allowed this shoddy version to be released.

The other con is fairly big - digital video noise reduction, or DVNR. This set is riddled with it. This process, often used to clean up scratches and dirt, can also remove lines and objects in animation, especially during fast motion. At its least distracting, lines become thin and fine ones disappear. At its worst, entire objects seem to disappear. The intensity was set far too high and the animation really suffers at times as a result. It may be cheaper and faster to push a button and do this than restore the cartoons frame-by-frame to make sure only dirt, scratches, and dust get removed as opposed to ears, tails, hands, etc. but in the end, it would have showed that Republic cared way more about this product than any PD company would.

For me, the DVNR, even at its most distracting, is a split-second glitch and it doesn't keep me from enjoying all of this classic animation. If you can handle these two drawbacks, this collection contains the best versions of these cartoons you're going to find, unless you have some of the American Movie Classics recordings from the 90's left on VHS. It's an invaluable collection of classic 30's animation, and should not be passed up.",1350172800,,4154,4.683561643835616
