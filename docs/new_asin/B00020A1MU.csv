2050594,5,B00020A1MU,"Hi, I'm from Chile and really want to buy this dvd pack... it was my favorite tv serie ever. But, I need to know if it has spanish subtitles. Anyone would tell me?

Thank you!",1139356800,2,175,4.0
2050595,4,B00020A1MU,"The movies are all pretty good, but the third movie is a dramatic plot departure from the book series, where it is Anne's children who serve in WWI.  If you can overlook that, the movie is well made and worth watching.  If you have not read the books, then view the movies FIRST and you won't be disappointed.",1137715200,9,309,4.310344827586207
2050596,5,B00020A1MU,"I could not disagree more with the last review.  Unlike many movies whose sequels are disappointing to the original production, Anne of Green Gables keeps you engrossed all the way through.  I have not read the books, but I was able to appreciate the movie series as its own work of art.  The last movie, ""Anne of Green Gables the Continuing Story"" is catered more toward adults than the first two (though adults will appreciate the first two as well).  But the third movie is set in a real historical setting of World War I.  This viewer was captured from the first scene until the last moment as I shared in the true-to-life pain and fear and sacrifice of the people of that time and as my heart was uplifted in seeing true love in action, self-sacrificial love for a committed husband and wife, as well as friends and neighbors (and even enemies).  The story not only pulls the heart strings, it also teaches much-needed lessons of true love and sacrifice for this generation.  This series is one of a kind, and the final movie caps them all.",1133395200,11,1045,4.526595744680851
2050597,5,B00020A1MU,"I adore these films. The location shoot on Prince Edward Island and it's surrounding areas bring real life to the land of Lucy Maud Montgommery and her Anne Shirley. Anne, an orphan, is accidentally rescued from her horrid life in a foster home by Marilla and Matthew Cuthburt. Looking for a boy, Anne with her outspoken flair for the dramatic is a shocking suprise for the senior farm siblings. But her outspokeness and imagination eventually makes Anne a beloved member of the family. I love her drive to succeed in her educational persuits. Anne is a role model to children and as Anne grows up she is a model of how to be exactly who you are to young women. I can't possibly say enough about these beautiful stories. Although the third installment is completely not true to the books it is still a great way for the ""Anne series"" on film to come to an end.

I will continue to watch it again and again.",1121040000,13,906,4.457831325301205
2050598,5,B00020A1MU,I am a Senior and have loved this movie since it first came out. I find the first episode so relaxing and if  you love country  life the scenery is so beautiful. It is a delight to watch in comparison with the world as it is to day. The actors are all perfect for their parts and Collen Dewhurst had to be one of my favorite actresses. All I can say is I love these movies and watch them when I want to go back to a peaceful life.,1120348800,22,430,3.8202247191011236

2050610,4,B00020A1MU,LOVE these movies.  There's no sound to the beginning part of each movie which is just a little highlights reel but the actual movies play just fine and like I remember seeing them originally on PBS.  Didn't care about the third movie because it completely deviated from the books but worth the price to get the other two!,1434240000,,322,4.5344827586206895
2050611,5,B00020A1MU,Love this series!  I can't say anything bad about Anne. Would recommend for great family entertainment.,1432771200,,103,5.4375

2050613,5,B00020A1MU,"TV has become largely a wasteland with gratuitous sex & violence.  This has none of them.  I remember my mom watching it when it was prime-time, but I was in and out, and didn't pay much attention.  Love the primaries, Anne and Gilbert and the supporting characters are eccentrics and always amusing, but everyone treated with dignity and respect.  Would the world would be more like this series!",1428710400,,396,4.779411764705882
2050614,5,B00020A1MU,We purchased this CD set to replace an existing VHS set.  The CD's appeared to be sharper with better colors but this could have also been a difference between tape and disc.  In any event we were very satisfied with the collection.,1428192000,,232,4.5

2050618,2,B00020A1MU,"I was happy to find these beautifully done movies on DVD, but I was very disappointed with the transfer quality.  And when I went to Walmart the next week and saw them there for about $20.00 less than I paid (less shipping) online, I was really unhappy.

If you're going to bother selling something on DVD wait until you can do it in the quality that the public has come to expect when purchasing something on this medium.  Its with great effort that I am even able to conjure up two whole stars.",1171670400,5,496,4.311827956989247

8019371,3,B00020A1MU,"I love the first movie. They stick to the book very well and in my opinion it is a great family movie. They portray the characters very well. I really have no complaints about the first.

The second one, is okay. I don't like how they mesh all of the books into one and by doing so don't follow the books very well, and they drop out some of Anne's friends she meets, that are interesting and dear in the book. They do not include Mr. Harrison and Ginger, Miss Lavender or Paul Irving, The twins Davy and Dora (Which is very disappointing. Davy puts so much funny comments in the book), Roy, and many others.  It's a good movie, and Anne is still Anne, but it's not the books.

The Third one is awful, Anne is not Anne, and it is not the book whatsoever. They don't base it on any book, and Anne is no longer the same character. Yes she is grown up and should  not be as ""silly"" as in childhood, but in the books she still has her personality, but in the third movie, she doesn't really have much of it at all. I really don't like the third one at all.",1493596800,,1052,4.067632850241546

8019375,5,B00020A1MU,"If you had a childhood like mine, Anne was a staple in your household and was watched over and over. This a great set and even has some extras. Best purchase in a while!",1482019200,,169,4.0
8019376,5,B00020A1MU,"Read this series a long, long time ago as a child in about 4th grade.. It was my salvation from a difficult home life and turned me on to reading during my entire lifetime.. I think the movies were very well done and an excellent representation of Anne Of Green Gables, as I remember her story..",1479513600,,295,4.285714285714286

8019378,5,B00020A1MU,"Ahhh...Anne of Green Gables, a must see for every young lady.  Good clean movies.  Anne exhibits characteristics every young lady should strive for...sweet loving spirit, feistiness, independence, while constantly improving on patience, self esteem, and confidence.  Anne seems to always defy her odds...overcoming her circumstances instead of letting her circumstances overcome her.  The 3 series unfolds a good clean love story and the setting is in many beautiful locations of Canada.  A childhood movie series I will never forget.  I purchased these for my 9 year old daughter who has enjoyed them as much as I did as a young girl.",1477785600,,635,5.237623762376238
