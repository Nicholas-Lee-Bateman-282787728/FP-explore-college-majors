5837966,5,B00DNVIWQM,"I had a lucky enough chance to see them live in Seattle earlier this month and might get to see them again in Paris! It was absolutely amazing getting to meet them and they were very kind! As a fan for a long time, the release of their live DVD was extremely exciting to hear about. Their music has done so much for me in my life and helped me through very rough times, so I will always recommend it, to anyone. They also have such a wide variety of covers that it's honestly open to all kinds of music lovers. 10/10, will always remain a dedicated fan!",1385424000,8,553,4.12962962962963
5837967,5,B00DNVIWQM,"The first time I heard 2CELLOS, their rendition of ""Welcome to the Jungle"" by GnR was blaring through my stereo... My only thought was... ""HOW DO THEY DO THAT""??? That sound coming from 2 cellists?? Impossible!! But it was true!! Luka and Stjepan have an energy that grabs ahold of your musical soul and never lets go. It's hard to describe how they play, not only with each other, but to the audience. You feel like you're the only one they're playing to!! Their drummer Dusan is so entertaining you cant help but smile when you see him play. He clearly enjoys what he does and trust me, he does it very well. Listening to their CD is great... But seeing them live... That's epic!!! My suggestion is to buy this DVD... Live Arena Zagreb, and see for yourself. I promise you won't be disappointed!! Once you see it, you'll be hooked forever too!!",1385424000,13,846,4.5
5837968,5,B00DNVIWQM,"Sometimes something so wonderful appears that it strikes a chord and resonates in us all. This happened when Luka uli and Stjepan Hauser came together and formed 2CELLOS. Both classically trained and with individual musical careers, their meteoric rise to fame came just days after their cover of ""Smooth Criminal"" became a hit on YouTube. Within two weeks, the video received over three million views and has been watched over ten million times to date. The brilliant video showed music played in a way we have never seen or heard before, filled with electricity and passion, intensity and energy by two very attractive young men. It's believable (until you see it for yourself) that such powerful rock concert sounds come from 2 cellos complimenting one another in such a way.

The impression and impact of their brilliant unveiling came immediately after the popularity of the video. Through the Royal Academy of Music, where Sir Elton John himself was once a student, contact was made and within days the 2CELLOS were booked on tour with him. They had no idea what was to follow and they received more attention than they ever expected. Calls and offers came flooding in and soon they were signed to Sony MASTERWORKS. Since then the duo has barely had time to stand still.

For the critics in the readership, do not be fooled by their youth or their good looks. uli studied at the Academy of Music in Zagreb and later entered London's Royal Academy of Music. Hauser completed his studies at Trinity College in London and then attended attended the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Both have performed all over the globe at venues such as Royal Albert Hall, Vienna's Musikverein  and Konzerthaus, London's Wigmore Hall, South Bank Centre and Amsterdam's Concertgebouw. They have been heard in Japan, the United States, South America, most European countries, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. There are over 25 international prizes between them including the prestigious Adam Cello Competition, VII Lutoslawski International Cello Competition and VTB Capital Prize for Young Cellists. They know how to bring it and like other historic musicians and composers, they test the limits of their instruments with each performance.

This DVD is evidence of both their talent and masterful technique. They are fueled by immense passion for music and display a rare virtuosity when commanding their instruments.  The way they play stretches the limits of possibility for what these instruments can accomplish and they dominate their cellos with absolute precision like confidence and a fierce elegance as can be seen in Resistance. Stjepan Hauser himself says that Luka uli's arm is like a machine gun. What we witness during this concert is the cello being resurrected before us. Watching them get lost in their music, we too get carried away to places of disbelief where we'll say to ourselves ""I cannot believe what I just saw and heard."" Their performance style is truly marvelous and 2CELLOS are sure to leave a legacy we'll long remember. I am convinced that they will be celebrated as the virtuostic duo that built bridges between musical genres by showing the world the limitless and artistic possibilities of this beautiful instrument.

We were fortunate enough to see 2CELLOS perform live in Orlando, Florida where they filled the house with audience members with ages ranging from 3 to 93. An interesting surprise was that they invited to the stage Emil and Dariel (13 and 16) known on YouTube as The Liakhovetski Bros and announced to the world that they are ""2CELLOS Junior"". Paying back the incredible opportunity that Elton John bestowed upon them, they allowed the boys to play and then joined them in Smells Like Teen Spirit, a rendition we will remember for ever. Emil & Dariel showed that they too have the makings of concert level performers and I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more from them in the future. So, BRAVO to 2CELLOS for paying it forward in this way. After the show they stayed for hours, personally meeting with fans, signing CD's and taking photographs. Something that is not common these days! A quick visit to their twitter page @2CELLOS and you can see the interaction with their fans, where the numbers of followers grows each day.

During the musical display we were privileged to witness, I noticed that older grandmothers were tapping their feet to Highway to Hell while little ones dreamily connected with Elegie in C Minor, Op. 24, holding their parents' hands as if they were being led down a pathway of curiosity and magic. In their portrayal of modern hits such as Welcome to the Jungle, Purple Haze, Back in Black and With or Without You, we heard music, sound and technique in a completely different way. Who every would have guessed that these instruments had such a power to rock? And more so, that such extremely talented players could bring it together in this way, unleashing the very essence of the music onto the attentive crowd through only two instruments backed up with the powerful beats of Duan Kranjc on drums.

The global attention they have received thus far only proves that the world is hungry for a new kind of sound, one where the music can be used to unite young and old and move us all together under one rhythm; a potent force with the power to make you feel invincible, alive and recharged. This beautifully filmed DVD shows them in all of their glory. You get a front stage peek at musical history being made. Stjepan and Luka do not play cello, they ARE cello and they merge with their instruments much like currents mix with the seas with both the turbulence of a hurricane and the calm after the storm. In short, they are a force and their power and passion is both contagious and inspirational.

Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD now. Watch it with your whole family and come together through the music that these two ber talented virtuosos create. Young and old, classical, alternative or rock genres, 2CELLOS have something for everyone to enjoy and be moved by.",1385424000,23,6060,4.870029097963142

5838004,5,B00DNVIWQM,Fabulous show but two highly talented orchestral cellists that proceed to rip off the stuffy fascade and have some fun! My only beef is I wish they had included a bit more of the classical pieces and maybe drop a few of the rock 'n roll tracks. All the tracks are marvelous but the rock got a tad repetitive. I've watched it several times and had friends over to watch and everyone loves these guys! Really hope they come out with the Arena Pula DVD soon!,1400630400,,455,4.3023255813953485

5838012,5,B00DNVIWQM,This concert represents the versatility of the performers as well as the instruments they play.  The cello is a beautiful instrument and these men play with gusto and beauty.  It is  a visual delight to watch them play a variety of music and to adapt modern tunes to classical instrumentation.  You won't find better entertainment.,1396310400,,331,4.963636363636364
5838013,5,B00DNVIWQM,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching 2CELLOS performing Live at Arena Zagreb.  I had previously watched all of their videos on Youtube, but it was so much better being able to watch them perform a whole show without the interruptions between videos.  Experiencing their emotional attachment to their music - and the music itself - made parts of this concert akin to a spiritual experience.  What these two young men can do with their cellos is truly awe inspiring.  I hope they plan to release another DVD, maybe one done in Arena Pula.

I must mention that I was also impressed with the quick delivery/service I received with this order.  Because it came from Switzerland there was no tracking available.  But this got to me in good shape in only a week, which was quite faster than estimated.",1395964800,,787,4.742647058823529
5838014,5,B00DNVIWQM,"Everyone will find something to love about this performance -- several things most likely -- but few will like all the song choices.  This is a description not a criticism; their music choices are that eclectic.  They range from ""Eligie in C Minor"" by Faure to ""Viva la Vida""  by Cold Play, from ""Benedictus"" to ""Highway to Hell"" and many others in between.  My personal favorites are Sulic soloing with the orchestra in the ""Eligie"" and the two of them rocking their hearts out in Jimi Heldrix' ""Purple Haze.""

No matter which ones you prefer, the performances are done with both passion and precision.  Hauser's sometimes over-the-top body language makes you wonder how he can play so well but he does.  Sulic does a percussive bowing on some of the rock numbers that is just amazing.  Set back and enjoy but be prepared to rise and applaud because it's hard to resist.

The only reasonable priced source for this when I ordered was in Australia and it took almost 2 weeks to arrive but it was worth it!",1395792000,,1005,4.601123595505618
5838015,5,B00DNVIWQM,They are the best cellos I ever heard. I love the soft and rock music they play! I also think at their age they are going to be a big hit everywhere,1395532800,,148,3.65625
5838016,5,B00DNVIWQM,"I have followed 2Cellos since 2011.  Their fusin of classical music with rock is overwhelming.  They make an original, full of emotion interpretation of rock's classic.  They are an example of what  discipline plus creativity can produce.  For those, who don't know, they compose their own music as Orient Express, from their lbum In2ituion.

We pretty much echo everything that has already been said as words alone cannot describe the greatness of their music.  We watched this concert on PBS and it was absolutely unbelievable!  We are getting this DVD as a New Year's Gift to ourselves :).  These are world class cellists and their work is remarkable.  The sound that they produce on 2 cellos beats any band you have ever heard.  This DVD is a must and everyone should own one.  We were very fortunate to meet Stjepan, Luka, and Dusan in person and watch them live, and we cannot wait to go to their show again.  This DVD will make the wait go by faster.  Highly recommend it!!

5838020,5,B00DNVIWQM,"I owe a lot to 2CELLOS for bringing the love of music back into my life.
 Cello has been a huge passion of mine and I started playing cello when I was 14 through my grade nine music string class. At 16 I joined Eastview Secondary School Senior Orchestra  which was a highly regarded youth orchestra within Ontario, Canada. Eastview's Senior Orchestra competed across Canada and the United States, and I was very proud to have been part of that experience. However, when I graduated from Eastview, I felt that I would never be able to play my cello at the same level that I had during my teenage years. Like most young adults, I decided to pursue post-secondary education and as a result I had to put my cello away and did not play it for another two years.
Unfortunately, two years later I had to transfer to an University closer to home as a result of physical illness. Feeling alone and horribly upset I thought of the last time that I truly felt happy and good at something, and that was when I was playing my cello. I turned to youtube, to look up famous cellists performing my favorite pieces. In the search I came upon ""2CELLOS on Ellen"" I immediately turned to it and instantly fell in love. Before seeing 2CELLOS perform I had never thought a cello could be capable of going out of the genre of classical music or movie themes. In that moment Stjepan and Luka completely made me fall in love with cello again. And as a result, in 2012 I took up cello lessons.
In May, I saw 2CELLOS perform in Toronto. And even though the recordings of their music is incredible, nothing compares to seeing them live.  Seeing them live in May, made me even more determined and inspired to improve my own cello playing.
But recently seeing them perform in Boston was a truly ""life changing"" experience. After a year of starting up  playing the cello again, in February I was considering going back to school for music. However, my family were not as thrilled about the idea as I was (not surprised after my previous failed attempt of schooling away from home). I told my parents to come with me to Boston, to see 2CELLOS live and they would understand why I love cello so much. They agreed. At the performance, we sat in the front row, and both my parents were absolutely astonished at what incredible cellists and performers Luka Sulic and Stjepan Hauser were. My father was also highly impressed with Dusan, the drummer for 2CELLOS, as it brought back fond memories of my dad playing drums as a teen. After seeing 2CELLOS live, my parents literally did a 180 in their views of me going back to school for music. They are highly supportive and believe if I put the dedication into my music as Stjepan, Luka and Dusan do, I can achieve my dreams of being a professional cellist.
The opportunity of being able to see Luka, Stjepan and Dusan perform within their home country of Croatia is a very special experience. I know that playing with my orchestra as a teen for special concerts in my hometown in Ontario, nothing can compare to performing in front of people that have supported you most throughout your life. I am honoured to have seen two live 2CELLOS performances within the past year and cannot wait to see several more in the future. I highly recommend that whoever reads this, buys this DVD and purchases their CDs, because they will be instantly in love with these incredible men. I also want to give a huge thank you to Stjepan, Luka and Dusan for bringing the love of cello back into my life. For ever a huge fan.
Lots of Love,
Your Canadian Fan, Ally
PS. I am expecting a tour in Canada soon - Aj and I have plans to come see every single Canadian concert. So at least you know two front rows in every city will filled ;) Lots of love:)",1385769600,8,3741,4.448979591836735
5838021,5,B00DNVIWQM,"There is no such thing as a 'casual 2CELLOS fan.' Either you're crazy about them, or you don't yet know they exist.

Like most of the best things that have happened to me in my life, I stumbled across this dynamic Croatian duo quite by accident. I started playing cello as an adult about a year ago after an epiphany, followed by a catharsis, on the side of the interstate. I heard the Elgar cello concerto on the radio, and it opened my heart WIDE. The siren song of the cello called to me, and the next day, when someone out of the blue asked me if I wanted to buy a cello, I ran into the arms of this, the most beautiful of all the instruments.

As part of my journey with my new love, cello, I naturally began seeking out cello music, listening to a variety of cellists; du Pre, Maisky, Ma, and of course the greatest of the great, Rostropovich. While educating myself on the legends via YouTube, I noticed another sweet face that I had never seen before, one wickedly handsome and expressively talented Stjepan Hauser.

Thirty seconds into the first time of ever hearing Stjepan play, I was a churning tornado of emotion and physical sensation. Tears were running down my face, I was laughing, I was restless to the point of needing to pace, and I had this incredible warm and fluttering sensation in my heart, like the wings of tiny birds beating against my rib cage...like being in love! With thirty seconds of Dvorak, Stjepan had deposed Slava as my favorite cellist, not an easy accomplishment, I assure you.

I watched all the classical performances of Stjepan I could find in my daily YouTube searches. It was probably two weeks before I realized that all of these '2CELLOS' videos popping up when I searched for 'Stjepan Hauser' might actually be related. (Sometimes I can be so focused and literal to the point of stupidity.) As luck would have it, the first video I watched of 2CELLOS was the one that launched them into the spotlight, their powerful arrangement of Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal.

It was like someone kicked open all the doors in my mind that I had established about cello music, letting in the sunlight of new and exciting possibilities! A true paradigm shift of musical discovery! And who was this angelic creature playing opposite my impish Stjepan?! The simple perfection of elegance that is Luka Sulic's playing style soon took it's rightful place in my heart next to the layered dance of complex emotion of Stjepan Hauser. The two styles, though very different to my ears, complimented one another so perfectly...Luka is the sweet cream to Stjepan's rich cocoa. If there has ever been such a thing as 'cello soul mates' in this World, Sulic and Hauser are the embodiment of the concept.

Though their two CDs, 2CELLOS and In2ition (also available through Amazon), are among my most precious music, nothing compares to actually SEEING them perform. They are absolutely mesmerizing! During live performance, they can be more mercurial than the changes in the weather! One moment they are so beautiful in prayerful peace as they play Karl Jenkins' Benedictus from The Armed Man, the next they are like gorgeous skulking tigers taking prey in the humid night as they play Welcome to the Jungle by Guns and Roses, but always they are perfectly matched, driving one another to even greater heights of expertise, emotion, and energy!

With the addition of respected jazz drummer, Dusan Kranjc, the whole 2CELLOS experience expands exponentially! Not only does fellow Croatian, and cutie, Dusan, posses the rhythmic precision required to please two classically trained cellists, but his nuclear performances sometimes destroy even his own drum kit with their exuberance! The end product of this new mixture of cellists and percussion is as breathtaking as it is addicting!

In October, I drove for more than three hours to see them live in Hershey, Pennsylvania. In November, I drove for more than six hours to see their US debut with orchestra with the Kentucky Symphony Orchestra in Florence, Kentucky. If they add 2CELLOS tour dates in between their scheduled performances for Canada with Elton John in February, I will happily be driving a lot further to see them live again.

If you can't make a live show, then this DVD of them playing their hearts out at home, in Zagreb, Croatia, is the next best thing. The audio artistry of Miro Vidovic of Morris Studios, who intuitively understands the complex translation of cello to recorded sound like none other, will have you feeling like your ears are savoring the musical equivalent of the finest tiramisu to ever touch your auditory palette. Not to mention the incredible expertise of MedVid Productions and the rest of the army of folks responsible for production and post production, including Luka and Stjepan themselves, who stay involved in all aspects of bringing their music to the people.

Warning: You will never be the same after watching this DVD. You will be entertained by the explosive performances. Your heart will be touched to the point of tears by the poignancy of the music. You will be inspired by the chemistry, friendship, and love between these two World Class cellists. And your mind will be opened to all the new and exciting possibilities that exist within four vibrating strings and a resonating wooden box. No, you will never be the same, but trust me, you won't miss the old you.",1385683200,53,5394,4.815334773218143

Paganini speed and accuracy. This kind of talent happens once in a lifetime.  Perhaps once every 300 years.  They are not only phenomenal players, they are great entertainers.  I immediately ordered the CD and will order more to give to friends and relatives.  As Cramer would say. Buy! Buy! Buy!",1524268800,,439,4.506329113924051
