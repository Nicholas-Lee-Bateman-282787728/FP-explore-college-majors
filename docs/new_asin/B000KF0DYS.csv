To be sure, almost all the women who appear are gorgeous and they have perfect / athletic bodies (I only found 1 of the women to be unattractive).  So, insofar as the beauty department goes, they have that down-pat.

Here's the problem:  contrary to what it looks like on the cover shot, the women do not fight each other topless.  They also wear total-protection head-gear so they can't really hurt each other (spoiler alert:  there are no knockouts....well, boxing wise that is).  The format of the DVD is odd as there is no nudity whatsoever in the main flick.  For nudity you have to go to the special features & photo gallery.  I took a sneak-peek @ the photo gallery B4 watching the boxing matches and I thought I was going to LOVE this DVD.  Well, not so much.

So, if seeing clothed women fight each other in headgear is your gig then I'm sure you'll appreciate this DVD.  If, like me, you're expecting something more  / different, then you're sure to be disappointed.  Buyer beware on this 1.",1514851200,,1065,4.507853403141361
