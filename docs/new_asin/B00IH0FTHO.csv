8642081,5,B00IH0FTHO,"Good instructions.  Easy to follow.  Bought some of the others by this couple after viewing the first ones.  They go through things step by step, showing you what to do slowly enough that you can follow it, and then give you some helpful tips too.  Really don't like the music choice, but then the point is to learn the steps so you can use them with your own music selections.  It would be nice to have a couple of different songs in the practice section but overall, the instructions were really clear.",1518825600,,504,4.434782608695652
