4375550,5,B004H9ZQ72,"Canadian horseman John Scott hosts this very entertaining and informative TV series. Each season (1 and 2) has 13 episodes, averaging 23 mins per episode, so each dvd runs 5 hours (!) utilizing both sides of each disc.
I've never owned a horse (but oh, how I would love to) so for me this is a privileged look, up close and personal, into the lives of these horses, horse owners, trainers and the worlds they inhabit. I am particularly impressed by the love and kindness shown to these magical creatures, especially the ""gentling"" technique of training. Impressive cinematography and insightful commentary contribute to a lovingly produced series, filmed in Canada.
I'm also impressed by how much they manage to pack into each episode: modern day-to-day running of farms, stables and training facilities; historical perspective; documentary footage, all at such a smooth pace with none of the typical in-your-face, loud, screaming presentation that pervades many TV shows these days.
The price I paid for this dvd on Amazon was an absolute bargain for such enjoyable entertainment, and if you decide to own it for yourself I do hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.
Sorry if I sound a bit too upbeat about this gem, but it really is super! And the Season 2 dvd is equally as good.",1374451200,3,1282,4.8054298642533935
4375551,5,B004H9ZQ72,"Very well done. Lots of time with so many shows broken out in it, Recoomend highly for real horse people",1374019200,,104,4.25

4375555,5,B004H9ZQ72,"This item was purchase as a Christmas Gift for someone else. So, I do not know the exact status of the item. Thank you.",1357776000,,119,4.0
4375556,1,B004H9ZQ72,"Was not at all what I thought this was. By the cover you would think this was a movie season that was about horses. This is not a movie\drama type season! It is a dvd that talks about horses and rodeos and such. The reason I thought it was a movie and not a 'talking about rodeos and what horses are best for this' type of thing was because it said: ""Go behind the scenes to see just what it takes to make a barrel racing horse, a performing horse, a trail riding horse and even a police horse! Interviews with trainers, handlers, riders, and owners provide an up close and personal look at the various roles of this beautiful and majestic animal."" So I thought that those would just be behind the scenes things but it is in fact what this dvd is. So if you are looking for a movie story about horses and are being fooled by the cover as I was please know this is not a movie.

Note: I rated this 1 star because my experience. The dvd was fine and came in perfect condition and shipped fast so that is not a reflection on those things.",1357689600,,1035,4.123762376237623

4375559,3,B004H9ZQ72,"Informative but a bit dated.  It shows how different horses have different lives. Also, the 2-sided DVD we received was defective and only one side had shows on it.  So, we never got to see the other half of the shows.  It is being returned.",1354924800,3,241,4.311111111111111
4375560,5,B004H9ZQ72,The selection of the topics and the horses that are subjects of each discipline are well thought out.  It is a very relaxing and enjoyable video to watch.  It is educational and you really get to experience the versatility and the heart and soul of the horses through these videos.  I would highly recommend the video.,1353974400,4,318,4.642857142857143
4375561,1,B004H9ZQ72,I couldn't. The quality of this DVD is horrible! It was like watching an old old old VHS tape. I'm not surprised it was so cheap but I'm shocked that it was rated 4 and a half stars when I bought it. I was taken for a ride and it wasn't on the back of a horse.,1350518400,6,260,3.5789473684210527

4375565,4,B004H9ZQ72,"Very good introduction for anyone interested in various breeds and what they do best. Terrific episode by Mr. Scott on movie horses - learned lots I did not know. The episodes are filmed in Canada so many of the horses and handlers were not known to me which hindered my appreciation somewhat. Two examples would be the ranch/cow horse - in the US we have the Quarter horse - in Canada, not so much - the other is Dressage. Really good episode, but have no clue as to the breeder/trainer/handler - but that could very well be my ignorance of international competitors.

The one problem I had was the episode on rodeos and this is the basis for the four stars. Mr. Scott and those he interviewed failed to mention that bucking horses are enduced to buck by a strap - a very important point when discussing bucking stock and what makes them buck.

Notwithstanding the rodeo episode, as you listen, you develop an interest to know more which is a great way to begin the search for knowledge. Mr. Scott does drone on a bit and patronizes somewhat, however, there is knowledge to be gained even if it means a little suffering in the process. The good news is that no one paints a idealized picture of horses. Most episodes are matter-of-fact and clearly present the breed characteristics.",1325548800,25,1283,4.598253275109171
8429400,5,B004H9ZQ72,"Loved World of Horses Season 2, so when this one became available, I knew I would not be disappointed. I wasn't. :)  Both Seasons 1 & 2 are very educational, yet entertaining, as well. Great for any horse lover, rodeo fan, or someone who would like to be better informed. Also, great for children of all ages to watch. No cussing, suggestive remarks, etc. Clean and wholesome.",1526774400,,376,4.611940298507463
