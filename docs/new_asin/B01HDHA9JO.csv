7785726,1,B01HDHA9JO,"I'll keep this short and sweet.

This is an anthology of 9 short low budget horror films, and 8 of them are terrible.

The only one that was any good was the one about the kid and his ""sister"" running outside to play hopscotch only to find everyone is suddenly gone.  That one at least had some decent acting and had something interesting going on in it.

If you are watching this in the hopes of finding the next great indie horror movie, you can keep looking, there is nothing really worth your time here.",1484611200,,507,4.3052631578947365

7785728,3,B01HDHA9JO,"""Invoking 3"" is an anthology of nine stories done in 81 minutes. It is directed and written by Lee Matthews who gave us a similar anthology in ""The Horror Network Volume 1."" Why this isn't volume 2 is a mystery to me. The first feature is a found footage and may turn off viewers. The next two are not found footage, but are rather short and pointless as was too of the features. I did enjoy two features: One was about a child kidnapped by a creature in Kansas. The second was ""The Lady in White"" with English subtitles. The Jack-in-the-box  was already done. The hop-scotch sequence would make for a good feature film. Some of the features have twists and irony, but not all.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.  2 1/2 stars",1476144000,,724,4.388059701492537
7785729,3,B01HDHA9JO,"Review- The Invoking started off as a low budget horror film. Who would have thought, we would get two sequels, that have nothing to do with the original? In fact, I am not really sure if we should call the 2 sequels, films at all. In fact, they are nothing more than a bunch of short films that have existed for some time to be stitched together to try and fit into a collective theme. This collections has 9 short films that the film goes for around 71 minutes or so.  The Dark Comes Quick is our first short, and it is a found footage short. We have a bunch of guys who go into a cave in search for something that they never find. Instead they run into some trouble and some monster. The acting is horrible, the scary element does work though. The cave setting with the use of the light in the cave, creates a good little atmosphere to completely be manipulated with. This overall felt like a movie that was edited and chopped. They gave you just enough story to follow, and enough horror to enjoy. So, on that theory, the short was a decent enough opening.  The Dweller is a waste of time and energy to even think about. You have a woman who thinks her house is being taken over by bugs. You have a cat that has a better acting range than the main actress. Nothing to see here, keep moving people. The third one is  Selfies. This one takes place in yet another state. (Each of these shorts, takes place in a different state or country supposedly, except NJ is actually on here twice) A woman takes pictures of herself and she discovers something is behind her. This is creative to a point and could make a good feature film. Maybe this concept could be the  One Missed Call we needed. Good fun short that was effective and very clever. The next short is from director Patrick Rea. Thank god, he found an outlet for his short films.  Prisoner at Brannons is a fun little Rea gem that showcases, a talent and passion that Patrick has. As we move forward to the last short, ( I am skipping a few on here) 3 A.M. Talk about annoying and just absurd. I found the noises in this short to be so distracting and at times very insulting. I get that  Sinister and its trailer opened the door for this use of sound effects like this, but this is not that film. The premise is promising but the style and sound effects ruined it for me.  She is not my Sister is the dark humor short, this film series needed. The ending line in this short is just brilliant.  Bedroom Window is the case of a short that should have had more time to work itself out. The premise of parents looking for their missing son is promising, the room where you see on computer what happened, was very promising. Then, you get an ending shot and on to the next short.  La Dama De Blanco is a short that had too much time and not enough imagination.  Heartbreak and the Dead had a ton of potential, but it just felt so out of place on here. That is the problem with this film, as a film it is no cohesive or place together to work. It feels someone just stitched pieces on a puzzle,and hope they fit. This is clearly the case of the sum being lesser the parts. As a whole, this just feels like a lazy effort. As pieces, there are some shorts that are very well done. I get that Steve Barton (Uncle Creepy at Dread Central) wants to make money getting these peoples past work on a disc to cash in on a popular trend. I feel since he is failing with his Dread Central presents series, that he should take the hint to stop trying to be the next V/H/S and maybe concentrate with being honest with film fans. I get that everyone wants to make a buck these days, but you have to be honest about it. I get that everyone has an ego these days. I bet if you asked Barton if he donates to charity, he would say putting money in his paypal is charity enough for him. That is the difference between a non horror fan and a die hard horror fan. A die hard fan will not put his name in a film unless he believes 100 percent in the film. A non horror fan, can put his name on anything and be content when the check rolls in. As a whole, there are some shorts that are good, but this film is just like throwing a puzzle to the ground and being blindfolded trying to find the pieces.",1475884800,,4228,4.170343137254902

If it wasn't free I wouldn't have clicked on it- I'm a paranormal investigator and am always curious to see if these movies have anything that's believable.

7785738,4,B01HDHA9JO,"Naw, I'd leave this off the list of the online dating profile (looking for that special someone, maybe, but not THAT kinda special ;)).

As others have pointed out, this is not so much a horror film as a pastiche of urban legends. At some points, I swear I'd blink, opening my eyes to a totally different film.  Think of it as kind of like the anti-Monty Python (due respect to the latter).  If you don't like the first two vignettes, it's just not for you.  I nearly cashed out at a couple of points.  Point is, the film forms a gestalt, if you'll allow for that.  Certain motifs pop up (check out the time  stamps, note the presence of cats).  Sure, this is common fodder for many movies of the same ilk, even cliches.  But two things set this film apart.  First, the international/multicultural aspect to the film, which, though not particularly insightful, on the whole paints a picture of a subconscious reservoir of fear common to all (again, relying on the motifs that reappear, not the plots of the individual sequences).  Second, the unrelenting realism that bucks the typical sensationalism of the genre.  No horse whisperers here, not by a far cry. ;)

I could be making too much of it.  I'd give it about a 7 out of 10.  I had the same WTF reaction about 7 minutes into the movie as remarked by others.  And some sequences served as rejoinders more than short films -- wouldn't stand on their own.  I saw an artistry here I found admirable, if not exceptional.  It's worth the watch if you're a film buff, also, if you've ever thought of screenwriting or making a short film (the latter genre really coming into its own the past few years -- to the last, this may answer the question, yea or nea, if a very fundamental experience of everyone's childhood, the urban legend (and before that, Grimm's tales, etc) , curt in style and often ambivalent in meaning, can be translated faithfully and effectively into contemporary form.",1502496000,,1939,4.571014492753624
