8631360,5,B00HAM6X4I,"The PBS Secrets of the Dead series is one of the better series for examining controversial or previously unknown elements of historic interest. First, the series avoids the sensationalism that is often associated with shows surrounding these kinds of topics. If there are unsolved mysteries, the show lets the viewer draw their own conclusions without jamming a particular viewpoint down the viewer's throat.

This particular episode examines the Shroud of Christ relic also known as the shroud of Turin. Rather than provide any spoilers, I'll pass and hope that those interested can find a copy for their personal library. It would be nice if PBS made all of the shows in the series available through pbs.org, regardless of when they were first broadcast.",1453161600,,756,5.146341463414634
8631361,5,B00HAM6X4I,"This was an exceptional program, re-opening the question of the age of the shroud of Turin. In 1988, using radio-carbon dating, the shroud was determined to have been made somewhere between 1260 and 1390 AD. However, some recent developments have thrown that date range into question. Among them:

The area of the shroud that was used for analysis has been shown to be somewhat corrupted, and not consistent with the material of most of the shroud. Did this sample skew the dating results? Another interesting fact was the blood type found on the shroud. It is type AB, and happens to match the blood type found on another legendary burial cloth, held in Spain, also said to be used for Jesus. The legends of this cloth reach all the way back to the 6th century, easily outdistancing the 13th-century radio-carbon date for the shroud. But perhaps most interesting was the stitch work discovered in the shroud. According to the program, the type of stitching matches only some clothes found near Masada, a 1st century Jewish fortress that fell to the Romans. The stitch work does not match anything found in Medieval times.

Do these new facts change anything? Yes and no. At the very least, they call into question the validity of the original dates given for the shroud. But they don't offer proof of a different or earlier date. That can only be determined with another, more careful radio-carbon analysis. The world is still waiting!",1099872000,6,1436,4.833333333333333
