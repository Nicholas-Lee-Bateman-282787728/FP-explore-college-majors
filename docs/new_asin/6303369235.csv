8324569,1,6303369235,I chose this movie for my mom. She watched it as a kid and she wanted it on vhs. The cover and vhs looked very good but when I put it in the vcr the tracking was very off. The screen constantly blacked out and the quality was sadly disappointing.,1388361600,,246,3.94

Even though I only knew 2 of he actors(Brian Keith and Ricardo Montalban) I loved this film as it gives a good message of having the courage to go after your dreams. Also, I love the musical score by England Dan and John Ford Coley. They have a song in the film call ""The Time has Come"" and the lyrics are perfect for  the film.",1366416000,,357,4.028169014084507
8324571,4,6303369235,"JOE PANTHER- Although this film is packaged as if it were a low-budget (which it is)international co-production mishmash {which it is assuredly not) this Florida made tale of the struggle of a native american who  battles the requisite obstacles of many inferior coming-of-age films  succeeds because it has the simple audacity to respect its audience with a  literate screenplay, a beautifully evocative score by Fred (Sterile Cuckoo)  Karlin and a knowing performance by Ricardo ""corinthian leather""  Montalban to balance each other joyously.  The ""G"" rating should  not set off alarms  deterring an otherwise interested viewer from  experiencing this wise sleeper. Only the usual overripe performance by  co-producer Cliff Osmond (who disserviced one too many Billy Wilder films)  momentarily sidetracks this crisp and winning adventure.  Beware the NEON  VIDEO tape which runs 104 minutes and runs out of tape 8 minutes before the  film does! Joe Panther has myriad rewards.  Discover it!",914025600,10,992,5.47682119205298
