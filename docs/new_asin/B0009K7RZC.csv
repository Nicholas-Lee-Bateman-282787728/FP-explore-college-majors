8062424,5,B0009K7RZC,"This is an outstanding documentary on the life and times of Jimmy Hoffa done in true A&E fashion: short, direct, staying on topic, flowing evenly from one segment to the next, and interjected with informative and very interesting interviews from those closest to the subject. This dvd was designed to explore all facets of Hoffa's life and not just his disappearance. If this interests you, then this biography is highly recommended. If you're only seeking theories and opinions concerning his disappearance, there are other documentaries that focus solely on that aspect.",1521590400,,572,5.2967032967032965
8062425,3,B0009K7RZC,"I purchased this dvd after watching the movie ""Hoffa"" and reading a biography of the infamous labor leader.  I was looking for a good quality dvd biography with footage of the man himself, newsreel footage, interviews, etc...  I felt that the A&E Biography series would be the best, most reputable version.

While the quality of the dvd, and the production itself, was up to A&E's high standards, the program itself is relatively short (approximately 50 minutes).  I realized then that this was simply a dvd of the television program, sans commercials.  This could have easily been a two hour program, covering the many facets of Hoffa's fascinating life.

If you purchase this dvd, you will get a high quality production, but a brief one.",1296518400,7,739,4.919354838709677
