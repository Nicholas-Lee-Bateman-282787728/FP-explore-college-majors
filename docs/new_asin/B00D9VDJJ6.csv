8591050,4,B00D9VDJJ6,"Always fascinating and entertaining, but - for me - a not quite deep enough look into Bergmans process by Bergman himself.  Full of witty title cards, and poking fun at himself as much as anyone, seeing him working with his great cast and Sven Nyquist was never dull.  But I felt like there was something being held back.  I felt like I saw how Bergman works, but not how he thinks, feels or creates.

This is available as part of the Criterion collection release of the film.",1454284800,,476,4.436781609195402
