8471410,5,B005G87Z22,"It is evidenced by the testimony of Blessed Alexandrina, first the Power of the Cross of Jesus Christ for the redemption of souls, and also how He desires the cooperation of other ""victim souls,"" to console Him, thus assisting in the purification of the Mystical Body of Christ, mysteriously helping other souls to accept their salvation in Him. Because of her confinement in paralysis, and her going mentally to unite her prayers with Our Lord in all the Tabernacles of the world,  so just as in the Miracle of the Sun, during the apparition of Our lady of Fatima, we are given a vision of the eternal dimension, in which we always live and a greater orientation for our own spiritual journey. This is a beautiful biography.",1389225600,4,725,4.708661417322834
