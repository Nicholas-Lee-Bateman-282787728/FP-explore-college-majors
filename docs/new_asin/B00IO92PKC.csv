6283844,4,B00IO92PKC,"I love all of Tim Burton's films, and this is an awesome value for three of my favorites. I'm not sure how well PeeWee's Adventures ties in with the other three, though.",1446422400,2,169,4.3125
6283845,5,B00IO92PKC,"Tim Burton might be one of the most popular movie directors over the past three decades.  So any multi-movie pack featuring his works would be of interest to many movie fans.  Burton's two Batman films are already included in other combo packs, so this one leaves them out.  The choice of films is great for the family, with Sleepy Hollow really being the only film not appropriate for children.  The other three films are fine for any age, even Corpse Bride has some funny moments for adult viewers.  The movie quality, both visual and audio, is spot on.  All four films come with the standard subtitles.  All are theatrical releases, as Tim Burton rarely does extended versions or director's cuts of his movies.  For the selling price here on Amazon, this is a great deal.",1445126400,2,774,4.681481481481481

6283847,3,B00IO92PKC,"Being a fan of Tim Burton's movies & artwork my friend gave this to me as a present.
I love Corpse Bride, love Pee Wee and of course Beetlejuice, why Willy Wonka?
Willy Wonka is one of Tim Burton's failures in my book; which is probably why they put it in because no one would buy it be itself.

What would have made this sssssooooo much better was Edward Scissorhands!",1442188800,2,369,4.271428571428571

8643947,5,B00IO92PKC,"I have been enjoying Tim Burton's movies ever since The Nightmare Before Christmas, although not all of them have struck the right chord with me. That being said, this boxed set is perfect for my collection as it contains some of Burton's movies that I Ilike the most. Beetlejuice (Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice! Sorry, couldn't resist) and Charlie And The Chocolate Factory are my favorites in here (Burton got everything right in his movie version of Chocolate Factory all the way down to the title) and I also like Sleepy Hollow although I was quite surprised to see it here since it is an R rated horror movie, not exactly family fare. A better fit would have been Pee -wee's  Big Adventure as it is a PG rated family movie like the other three in here. As for Corpse Bride, I'm not one of it's biggest fans but it is a good movie and worth having in this set. Also, the picture and sound transition to HD is flawless. The only problem I have had with this is that my copy of Beetlejuice seems to have a glitch where the movie freezes during a scene of Adam and Barbara in the Nether World and jumps twice then goes back to normal again. This is a small glitch that wouldn't be so annoying if it didn't cause me to miss part of the scene. I am going to try picking up another solo copy of Beetlejuice and see if it fixes the problem, assuming that the glitch is only on certain discs (or, better yet, just that one disc). If so I will update my review and bump the item up to five stars. That is all for now.

Update-8/3/17: Since writing the above review I have purchased a second copy of Beetlejuice and I didn't notice the glitch this time which means that something was wrong withe disc that originally came in the set. I have therefore swapped them out and boosted my ranking to five stars. Just be warned if you should decide to purchase a copy of this set, it's awesome but may contain one or more glitched discs.",1499212800,,1919,4.342618384401114
