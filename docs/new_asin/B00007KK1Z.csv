7977423,4,B00007KK1Z,"I originally purchased MURDER AT DEVIL'S GLEN in a collection, as an old Jane SEYMOUR film, the HAUNTING PASSION, was also included, (please refer to my Amazon review of that set). Initially, I balked at the inclusion of MDG as it is a film that I was unfamiliar with. I thought that this was the manufacturers way of disposing of a picture that nobody wants, (but they make you pay for it anyway). I also prefer Horror and rarely venture into other genres as it would cost me a small fortune! In retrospect, I am glad that I made this purchase as MDG is by far the better of these two films. I won't provide a plot synopsis as that has already been done by other reviewers. MDG is a thoughtful, well crafted low budget psychological thriller that successfully draws the viewer in. The film is so good, that film study classes should include it in their curriculum for must viewing. In contrast to its b-picture origins, MDG has a modest Hollywood-like budget feel about it. The acting, cinematography, and script all deserve kudos, and it is a shame that more people are not aware of this film. I am a huge fan of Horror and have reserved my Amazon DVD reviews for that genre-until now. My only complaint is that the film has such an awesome ending that it may diminish repeat viewings. Action and Horror flicks at least have the advantage of offering a lot of eye candy to keep ones interest alive, (even though the finale is no longer a secret). For that reason I won't provide any ""reveals"" because you should discover them for yourself! Of interest is that I did re-watch MDG and although the effect was diminished, (as to be expected), I spent more time pondering the technical side of things; acting, dialogue, camera work, etc. It still proved to be a pleasant ride. Four out of five stars for MDG. Recommended!",1236124800,,1819,4.548780487804878
7977424,3,B00007KK1Z,"I purchased this collection as I had been looking for the HAUNTING PASSION, with Jane SEYMOUR. I love old fashioned ghost stories and I am a huge fan of SOMEWHERE IN TIME, (in which she also starred), so naturally this film was of interest to me. Initially, I balked at the inclusion of MURDER AT DEVIL'S GLEN, as it is a film that I was unfamiliar with. I thought that this was the manufacturers way of disposing of a film that nobody wants, (but they make you pay for it anyway). I also prefer Horror and rarely venture into other genres as it would cost me a small fortune! In retrospect, I am glad that I made this purchase as MDG is by far the better of these two films. I won't review the plots as they can be found elsewhere on Amazon if you search these titles individually. The HP is basically an ""80's TV quality"" ghost story with sub standard scares and effects. An interesting curiosity, strictly for fans of this genre as well as for devotees of SEYMOUR. MDG on the other hand is a thoughtful, well crafted low budget psychological thriller that successfully draws the viewer in. The film is so good, that film study classes should include it in their curriculum of must viewing. In contrast to its b-picture origins, MDG had a modest Hollywood budget-like feel about it. The acting, cinematography, and script all deserve kudos, and it is a shame that more people are not aware of this film. I am a huge fan of Horror and have reserved my Amazon DVD reviews for that genre-until now. My only complaint is that the film has such an awesome ending that it may diminish its repeat viewings factor.

Two stars for the HP and 4 stars for MDG, (hence my posted 3 star average). Recommended!",1236124800,,2184,4.503778337531486
