2958939,5,6301149599,"I've been recently watching this movie again and I was so glad that I went through the expense and bought this out of print DVD.  This is the movie that is bigger that its genre, it is a poem indeed.  This is the case with other films that are art and not just entertainment.  I actually find Arabian Nights more exotic and romantic that Canterbury Tales, but I would not judge which is my favorite among the three of them (i.e. plus Decameron).  Each has its own character and I believe Pasolini excelled in conveying that special air and mood that each book represents.  I find Arabian Nights also the most melancholic and mysterious, and I think that it was Pasolini's goal, also.  I wouldn't say that the people in this film are necessarily beautiful - Pasolini aesthetics are quite controversial and might not be universally accepted.  This is the case with all his films.  The incredible result, though, is that with non-professional actors and himself not having any cinematography education, he achieved the pinnacle of cinema art.  For me, films like this is the same to cinema as Michelangelo's creations are to sculpture, and it is only incomprehensible how come that it's almost impossible to buy Pasolini's DVDs at a reasonable price, especially when looking at the mass production garbage that occupies shelves of video stores.  The irony is that Pasolini was tormented by the same question about the role of crude and mindless entertainment being served from TV.  I hope that despite everything, his art will live and win over people minds...Last advice for viewers - steer clear if you don't like ""boring foreign movies with subtitles and without action"".

8220759,5,6301149599,"This 2-disc package is produced by the British Film Institute; it contains a Region 2 Blu-ray version with the sound track in Italian and the option to display high-res English subtitles, as well as a Region 2 DVD with similar options. On the DVD there is a very slight jerkiness to the visuals and the resolution on the subtitles is not as crisp as on the Blu-ray. (I played both on an LG multi-region player, with HDMI output to a Sony KDL 42V4100.) Both discs also contain a ""deleted scenes"" clip which offers two extended sequences that have no dialog audio track. The first introduces Nurrudin paralleling the opening of the story of Nur al-Din and Miriam the sash-maker (nights 863-94 in the Lyons translation); it has a music track. The second, silent, presents a continuation of the Taj al-Muluk and Princess Dunya (nights 107-37 in the Lyons translation) sequence from the film that may have been an alternative ending Pasolini considered. In it, Dunya ends up disguising herself as a warrior and then reveals herself--following the basic motif that--in the form of Zumurrud revealing her gender disguise to Nurredin--concludes the final cut of the film. (This motif is also used repeatedly throughout the Macnaghten ms.-Lyons translation of the written Arabian Nights.)",1343779200,,1279,5.037735849056604
8220760,4,6301149599,"Pasolini ended his Trilogy of Life with 1974's Arabian Nights (Il fiore delle mille e una notte) in which he examined love in all its aspects. The film was inspired  by the ancient erotic and mysterious tales of the Middle East .

The main story concerns an innocent young man who comes to fall in love with a slave who selected him as her master. After his foolish error causes their separation, he travels in search of her. Various other travelers who recount their own tragic and romantic experiences include stories of a young man who becomes enraptured by a mysterious woman on his wedding day, and a man who is determined to free a woman from a demon.

While I don't profess to have understood the entire film I can say that I was constantly amazed by the images that Pasolini created. Using ancient locations there is always something new to see on multiple viewings. The viewer has the feeling of seeing places that no longer exist. Somehow the classic stories feel right in this setting in a way that they don't in many of the American versions, The film takes on a dreamlike quality that is hard to explain.

The standard definition disc that I viewed was by Image Entertainment and presented the director's cut of the film in widescreen. The Italian soundtrack was easy to hear but the white subtitles were sometimes hard to read. There were no special features presented on the disc and considering the cost of the edition was somewhat disappointing.

The entire trilogy could use a serious restoration and a reasonably priced Region 1 edition would be quite welcome. Well worth seeing for the scenery alone it should not be missed by any serious film fan.",1298851200,3,1668,4.679180887372014

NO STARS  As far as the film is concerned-- It's great and that is why I was hoping to own a copy.  So I'll try a different source.,1296950400,,313,4.098360655737705
8220762,4,6301149599,"This is Pasolini's third film in his ""Trilogy Of Life"" (the first two being ""The Decameron"" and ""Canterbury Nights."" This film was shot on location in Yemen, Persia, Nepal, Etiopia, and India. Pasolini's practice of using non-actors and real people really shines in this, the people are as real, and often as ugly and as desert-beaten as the buildings.

This film does present several tales of the ""One Thousand Nights And A Night"", but only someone who has read the unexpurgated 10-volume set would be familiar with The Tale of Ali Shar and Zumurud, the main story in this film, in which a Slave Girl gives a young man, Ali Shar, the funds to buy her, only to later lose her, and who spends the rest of the story searching for her.  Don't look for Sinbad and Aladdin here, the several other stories are equally obscure to an American audience.

Be aware that this film is generally released in it's original Italian, without overdubbing. Such subtitles as exist on Region 2 and Region 1 & 4 combined editions may not contain English subtitles. Criterion has been proposing to release all three of Pasolini's ""Trilogy Of Life"" films, so the potential buyer might wish to wait for that edition to be released.

There is violence in this film. Animals were obviously killed. There is full frontal nudity of both sexes and of varying ages. The actor who plays Ali Shar doesn't appear to be more than 16, he delightedly has sex on-film with a woman 10 years older than he. Several times. This film wouldn't be allowed to be released in America in 2010, for the same reasons that Traci Lords early sex films are similarly banned. This film is not for Family Viewing. But if you are an open-minded consenting adult, this is a very accessible film from one of the geniuses of 60's & 70's Italian Cinema that truly classifies as ""Art.""",1269907200,3,1827,4.647058823529412
8220763,3,6301149599,"This film version keeps much of the eroticism in Sir Richard Burton's original translation, which previous movie treatments saw fit to water down... Great care was taken in the details: it was shot on location (Africa and the Middle East) and a dark skinned girl was cast as the princess... The acting is extremely good, and the stories connect in and out in intriguing fashion...

The film selects some of the more popular of the Arabian Nights stories, but intertwines them in strange ways... Like the original, many stories lead into other stories and again into others...

One of the most erotic sequences is when two supernatural beings decide to play a trick on a virginal girl and boy... The beings make each young person seduce the other while he or she is asleep... In another scene, one of the heroes finds himself in a pool with a group of very pretty, very nude Arabian women, who tease and tickle him into an intense joy...",1232236800,3,936,4.666666666666667

8220765,2,6301149599,"I perfectly understand that the cinema of, let's say, Werner Herzog, King Vidor or Andrei Tarkovski, can be described as poetic but I don't think that this adjective is relevant regarding Pasolini's ARABIAN NIGHTS. I didn't find in this movie an ounce of poetry. To present Arab tales in a very realistic manner, with the exception of one or two scenes, is maybe original, perfectly boring but not at all poetic.
Furthermore, I'm not specially excited by the presentation of nude teenagers, masculine and feminine, making love in a rather mechanic manner and by the erotic toys shown by Pasolini in his movie. So I strongly advise you to reread or buy a copy of  ""A Thousand and One Nights"", a book that has the merit to plounge his reader in an imaginary poetic world and leave ARABIAN NIGHTS to Pasolini's aficionados.",1074902400,13,820,4.774647887323944
