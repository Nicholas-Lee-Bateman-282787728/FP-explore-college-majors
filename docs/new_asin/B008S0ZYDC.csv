8530145,5,B008S0ZYDC,love Leerburg videos - not terribly exciting but got some good ideas for nosework activities,1435622400,,92,5.2
8530146,3,B008S0ZYDC,"Video editing anyone?! Video drags on and on with a lot of promoting leerburg. The trainer has some good information but its lost in his poor delivery.

The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because it does show how to teach a dog to find a scent but its not at all worth the pricetag and YouTube has some training videos that are better and free.",1347667200,21,348,4.117647058823529
