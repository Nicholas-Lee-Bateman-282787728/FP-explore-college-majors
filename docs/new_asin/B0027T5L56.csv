8355063,5,B0027T5L56,"I feel compelled to write this review because one of the other reviewers seems to be writing about some other production.  I am writing about the Glyndebourne, Laurent Pelly production.  In this one, there is no world war I setting, there is no family room setting with a Christmas tree in Act Three.  The Act Three on this dvd is nothing like what the reviewer, David Reynolds, described.  There is a man who plays the witch, but he is not the same as the man who plays the father.  You can go to the glyndebourne website and see clips from this video.

My daughter and I enjoyed this production.  She is 8 years old.  Although my husband gave her an out telling her he thought opera was boring, she insisted that she was glad she had seen it.  If she had been any younger, it would have been hard for her sit still through any opera, particularly one sung in a foreign language.  However, at her age, its possible a traditional setting would have bored her.  She already knows the story of Hansel and Gretel quite well, so the new setting was intriguing.  In this production, the family lives in an enormous cardboard box.  The forest seems to be a junk yard or lumber yard full of large poles, empty 2-liter bottles, and plastic bags.  The witch's house is a candy store turned inside out - we spotted large packages of gobstoppers, boxes of candy canes, commercially available boxes of cookies, candies, and soda pop.

The cast is very good.  The children seem like a young boy and girl.  The parents are good, the witch is very intimidating.  The music is lovely.

It is sung in German.  The English subtitles are a translation in rhyming verse.  I should mention the translation includes a few curse words, like h**l, and b****h, which are there to rhyme with other words.  The first word is sung by the children, the second by the witch.  This didn`t particularly bother me, as I try not make a big deal about curse words, but it may bother others who are showing this to children.  I still think that this production is suitable for older children (age 8 and up).",1392854400,2,2071,4.490616621983914

8355065,5,B0027T5L56,"This is a modernized staging of one of the most familiar operas in the repertoire for young and old alike. I really enjoyed this production and perhaps a better bellwether, even my 9 year old sat in rapt attention throughout the entire opera. In this retelling, Laurent Pelly, stage director, has provided a dramatic staging where the gingerbread house has been remade into a convenience store turned inside out. While clearly the staging and theatrical aspects of the opera are on display, it is well sung and the London Philharmonic shines in its orchestral support. The transfer to DVD succeeds as well. The introduction takes us through the beautiful grounds of Glyndebourne into the theater while the overture is played and used to segue from video to the live theater. While one is aware of the audience it is never a focus. I wouldn't compare this production to other more traditional renderings, but as a modern retelling this production is tops.",1268006400,7,954,4.931677018633541
