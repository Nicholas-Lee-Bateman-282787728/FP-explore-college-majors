5793646,5,B00DEKKFBW,"02-11-14 UPDATE!! My original review of this DVD-set is below this update. I just discovered that Amazon will be selling Season 5, Volume 2 (to be released 03-04-14) on 3-DVD or 3-BluRay Discs. Volume 2 DVD set will apparently contain 8-episodes that were originally reported to be the first 8-episodes of Season '6'. Even though History seems to have punk'd us again, I'm just happy to see these episodes available for purchase so soon after their Air-Date - I've already pre-ordered.

Check it out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancient-Aliens-Season-5-Vol-2/dp/B00HF98SSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancient Aliens: Season 5 Vol 2</a>!

Season 5, Volume 2  -  Original Air Date

""The Power of Three"" - September 30, 2013
""The Crystal Skulls."" - October 7, 2013
""The Anunnaki Connection"" - October 14, 2013
""The Magic of the Gods"" - October 21, 2013
""The Satan Conspiracy"" - October 28, 2013
""Alien Operations"" - November 1, 2013
""Emperors, Kings and Pharaohs"" - November 8, 2013
""Mysterious Relics"" - November 15, 2013

I think it would be prudent to wait until the DVD's are in our hands before updating Wikipedia ! You think?

My Original Review:

Even though it says 'Volume 1' on the case, all twelve episodes from season five are contained on 3 DVD's. Now by ""Lionsgate"" - expect a slightly different start-up configuration than previous seasons (due to Lionsgate Logo & titles when the discs first 'boot' up). Also, discs are now black with silver text and do not have the traditional 'Ancient Aliens' photo on them.

Disc 1 automatically proceeds to Trailers instead of Main Menu. You can override at that point by selecting the Top Menu button on your DVD Player remote. The disc will then skip to the more familiar 'Selections' screen of recent previous seasons - whereas you can select 'Play All', 'Episodes' & 'Subtitles'.

If you elect to view an individual episode instead of 'Play All', it will begin to play immediately, without giving you the 'Chapter' options available on previous seasons. Each Episode has the normal AA intro and is approximately :44 minutes (the Trailers add additional total disc time). All played perfectly on my inexpensive (Dynex) DVD/Blue Ray Player.

Disc 1:
""Secrets of the Pyramids""
""Aliens and Cover-ups""
""Alien Power Plants""
""Destination Orion""
+ the following Trailers: ""Mountain Men""; ""The Darkest Hour""; ""Swamp People""

Disc 2:
""The Einstein Factor""
""Secrets of the Tombs""
""Prophets and Prophecies""
""Beyond Nasca""

Disc 3""
""Strange Abductions""
""The Von Danikin Legacy""
""The Viking Gods""
""The Monoliths""

I recommend this DVD set. Lionsgate did a good job getting it out to us intact.",1378166400,66,2679,5.302600472813239
5793647,5,B00DEKKFBW,I watched all of these programs as they came out and now I own them for my very own. They are full of interesting information about the prospects of ancient aliens. Wonderful program!!,1378166400,12,184,4.606060606060606
5793648,3,B00DEKKFBW,seems like they talk about the same thing over and  over same footage from season 1 2 3 and 4 just turned around . I wanna seemore evidence :( season 6 is it possible well see somthingnew?,1377302400,8,188,4.081081081081081
5793649,5,B00DEKKFBW,"I would like to know why it says ""Volume 1"".

That normally implies this would be only a partial selection of episodes. An incomplete season. If that is the case... a lot of people are going to be upset. If that is NOT the case... then the idiot who created this page needs to correct the title with accurate information. The ONLY time you use Volumes for DVD TV series episodes is when the season is incomplete. You need to CLARIFY this if you want customers to do advance purchases. Is this the full season five episode set or not???

The SAD part is this ""Volume"" listed on the main title will cause people not to order... which will then be misinterpreted as a lack of interest in the show or the DVD's... when it is your use of the word ""Volume"" creating the concerns of missing episodes and causing people to hesitate to order the item.

As for blu-ray... to heck with Blu-ray and its overpriced scam to control the market. DVD is less expensive and is not feeding a single corporate fat hog like Blu-Ray.

Keep the DVD format because there are a lot of us who will NEVER buy Blu-ray or Ultraviolet or HD... all the scam formats to control content and to feed a single fat hog corporation at triple the price of DVD.",1376352000,64,1222,4.3464912280701755

5793673,4,B00DEKKFBW,"Just finished watching ""Ancient Aliens - Season 5: Volume 1"" released by The History Channel.
With the first half of Ancient Aliens - Season 5"" released on DVD, this series now ventures into the type of visual presentation packaging that ""In Search Of"" pioneered in - and by that I mean choosing what episode you wish to watch by picking one of four screen shots on the television screen.
Mom, Dad, Selma, and I always enjoyed ""In Search Of;"" but ""Ancient Aliens"" always falls way short of reaching the effortless style and grace Leonard Nimoy had in presenting unusual topics and theories for your consideration.
This series is enjoyable to watch, but it has yet to make me want to suspend my disbelief like ""In Search Of"" did.  Of course, I was much, much younger when ""In Search Of"" first aired on broadcast television. [Boy, have I ever dated myself with that statement!]
Amongst the best of the 12-episodes in the collection are;  ""The Von Daniken Legacy,"" ""The Monoliths,"" ""Destination Orion,"" and ""Prophet and Prophecies.""
Recommended.

A shame really. Also a bit of googling can show that moving very large rocks or cutting them does not take more than one person.

Seems petty & a cheap way to make more money by dividing a single season up into 2 volumes.

5793739,4,B00DEKKFBW,"It's always risky to write a negative review so please, you avid fans, go easy a bit.  I watched Seasons 1 and 2 (and 3?) of Ancient Aliens on DVD and didn't realize there were more; then noted Seasons 4 and 5 had been released.  I started watching Season 5 disc one without even noticing I had skipped over season 4, but it hardly mattered.  The episodes on disc 1 kinda circled around some of the same stories I had heard in seasons 1-3, with mostly the same commentators as well (always referred to as ""ancient alien theorists"").  There are a couple of problems with this series coming from the History Channel.  First and obviously, it portrays versions of history which are, let's say, wildly controversial without ever (that I've seen so far) putting on a genuine critic of these theories.  Second, an annoying habit (still present in Season 5) of throwing out what most professionals in the field would probably say are wild ideas, posed as a question, then saying, ""Perhaps the answer lies HALF A WORLD AWAY...over HERE...and switching to another story.  As in: Did ancient pyramids serve as power stations for extraterrestrial space stations, etc?  Perhaps the answer lies half a world away...

Probably most of the people that would faithfully watch all 5 seasons are already avid believers, and I fear my efforts to persuade anyone who thinks all of this is bunk, are unlikely to convince them to watch.  Let me give 2 examples of stories from disc 1 season 5 which are particularly interesting, portray some counter-arguments, and then try to portray why I think this series is worth watching even if you do not believe 90% of the theories put forward:

Season five includes a discussion of what are purported to be the largest and maybe the oldest pyramids in the world, at Visoko which in northwest of Sarajevo.  A native who relocated to Texas, USA named Sam Osmanogich, was excavating them several years ago, and proclaimed the largest one, the ""Pyramid of the Sun"", to be almost twice as tall as the great pyramid at Giza.  Furthermore, he claimed that analysis of the mortar between stone blocks gave it an age of possibly around 12,500 years, which would make it the oldest extant pyramid.  Almost no mainstream archaeologist agrees with him and the show presents a straightforward reason why: because the question would naturally arise: who BUILT pyramids that old?
Well if you do a little online ""digging"" into these claims, I have to conclude that Mr. Osmanogich's claims don't hold up well.  I agree, certainly in the film these look like large pyramids, which have been covered over by vegetation.  Other archaeologists claim they are actually hills of natural formation, and that there are hundreds of similar hills, including in the US.  Osmanogich claims the entire surface of the pyramids was covered over with man-made  (or artificially made) concrete which is about 3 times the quality of concrete made today.  Some archaeologists claim it is not concrete at all but a type of ""brecchia"": stones which by water action ended up resting in a bed of clay or sand, which eventually hardened into solid stones.  By ""three times the quality of modern cement"", he appears to mean its much lower absorption of water as well as durability.
He claims to have found an extensive network of ""tunnels"" which connect at least 3 of the pyramids which he is excavating (because, he says, subsequent water action flooded much of the original tunnels).  A different view of what he is doing is taking some very small gaps between rocks, and excavating them until they look like real tunnels.  Given enough time and money I'm sure he would have an extensive network of tunnels between the hills.  I read elsewhere that first he claimed these were around 12,000 years old, then retracted that statement and indicated they could be from anywhere to around 12,000 to 4 or 5,000 years old, and actually younger than the pyramids at Giza.
Others have observed his ""excavations"" appear to be remodeling the hills, so that they look more like south American ""step pyramids"".  In short, that these excavations are In order to make them appear more man-made.  The closest I found to any independent agreement with his ideas, was a statement by another researcher that humans, centuries ago, did in fact do some shaping of the natural hills, to make them appear more pyramidal than they originally were shaped.  As far as the names: Pyramid of the Sun, the Moon, the Serpent: they all were given those names by Osmanogich himself.  As I suspect is true of many of the other speakers, the series leaves out their more frankly bizarre statements, which would tend to make them lose credibility, such as a statement by Osmanohich that Hitler and his commanders were not killed, but escaped to Antarctica where they live in a secret complex...In summary, Osmanogich himself does not have any credibility.

How about the assertion that the aliens who gave us technology to build great pyramids came ""from Orion's belt"" because temples and structures around the world have a pattern matichg Orion's belt.  Well this too does not hold up to scrutiny.  Three main stars make up the ""belt"": Alnitak, actually a triple star system about 736 light-years from earth.  The largest of the 3 stars is said to be the largest, brightest ""type O"" star in the northern sky and is estimated at about 28 times the volume of our sun.  The second star, a smaller blue star, rotates around it in a slow orbit taking about 1500 years.  The third star is further from the first two and less bright.  The middle star in the belt is Anilam, about 1300 light years from earth.  The one on the left side is Mintaka and is about 916 light years from eath and is actually a 4-star complex.  The two closest stars rotate around each other about every 5.7 days.  In short, ""Orion's belt"" is not a location at all; the 3 stars happen to look adjacent from our position.  The ""Orion nebula"" briefly mentioned, is lower down and actually the middle ""star"" of the 3 representing the dagger slung from his belt.  It's quite a cluster--the closest to earth, and has a high density of around 2,000 stars in an area roughly 20 light-years in diameter.  Almost all the stars there must be younger than ours and had less time to develop an advanced civilization.  The colors of the nebula are interesting: blue from the light of hot blue stars reflected through the gas, red from H-alpha recombinations, and green from a reaction impossible on earth: a highly unlikely electron transition in doubly-ionized gas.

The incident at the RAF base near Rendlesham Forest, though it has somewhat more credibility to it, is difficult to interpret and I found it perhaps the most interesting so far in season 5.

What I'd like to say about Season 5 and all of them together, is that you do not have to believe everything in the show for it to be worth watching.  You may learn a lot more history and geography, even if you don't believe any of the explanations put forward--and you'll probably realize there's a lot that we simply do now know yet, and cannot begin to explain.",1405209600,,7124,4.752233956133225

I have studied these topics for 30 years, and still found things I was unaware of presented on this series. Of note to me, was the fact that Hopi Villages were laid out on the earth exactly as the constellation of Orion is laid out in the sky; and that the Hopis followed a star until it stopped, showing them where to build the structures. Also amazing, was the footage of the underground tombs near the King Teti I pyramid at Saqqara in Egypt. The Saqqara complex of ""temples"" is the size of a small US city, and these tombs, amazing as they are, would fit in one small block of that city.

  Stop waiting for the press to disclose the existence of Aliens on Earth! This series is that disclosure. Even though the show asks ""what if"", the many images of immense constructions beyond our understanding, executed with amazing precision and knowledge, tell the story.

However, seventeen episodes of season five were filmed and the final five aired on History Channel in November of 2013, as per fan request to show it on regular History Channel for a while.  During these five episodes (not included on this disc, but a future release I am sure should be released soon) fans had a chance to Tweet live with the show's ""mane"" attraction (see what I did there?) Giorgio A. Tsoukalos.  A fan asked him, via Twitter, if this was season 6, and he replied, ""no, this is the final five episodes of season 5.""

So, while it is not a complete season, and I am curious as to why they could not just put the whole season on one set, perhaps aliens are responsible for this.  (Actually since this set is distributed by a different company than the previous four seasons, that may actually be the true reason.)

Regardless of this, fans who miss Filip Coppens, who succumbed to a rare form of cancer early in 2013 will be able to see him in this season.  (He completed the whole season).

The Power of Three

Reverence for the number three dates back thousands of years, and can still be found today in art, architecture, science, literature, and religion. What is it about this number that continues to fascinate mankind?

The Crystal Skulls

Luminous relics in the shape of human skulls. Otherworldly artifacts believed to harness the secrets of the universe. Are the Crystal Skulls part of an elaborate hoax? Or do they possess a great, perhaps even otherworldly power?

The Anunnaki Connection

The Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia achieved over one hundred ""firsts"" for human civilization. Advances in writing, agriculture, science, mathematics, medicine, astronomy, transportation, building, military, schools and city planning.

 Magic of the Gods

Wondrous wizards... Mysterious sorcerers... And heavenly beings... possessed of unimaginable power. Throughout the ancient world, magic was used for everything from healing to communicating with the gods.

The Satan Conspiracy

He is the evil one, the Prince of Darkness, the ruler of Hell. Satan conjures up horrifying images of a horned beast whose sole purpose is to destroy humanity. Yet there is evidence that the fallen angel we know as Satan may be misunderstood.

Alien Operations

Mysterious surgeries performed by early humans... Strange beings with miraculous powers... And a cover up--destroying centuries of scientific knowledge. Are recent breakthroughs in medicine the result of years of research?

 Emperors, Kings and Pharaohs

Powerful monarchs ruling by divine right. Centuries-old dynasties amassing enormous wealth. And legendary leaders wielding powerful weapons of mass destruction. Is it possible that ancient rulers were, in fact, connected with divine?

Mysterious Relics

Sacred bones... Golden hats... And fragments of sacred objects thought to possess healing properties. All around the world, archaeologists have uncovered mysterious relics revered by ancient cultures for thousands of years.",1387065600,,2145,5.7555555555555555

We had fire, then swords and agriculture and horses etc. Our past should be easy to figure out but instead there are things we have absolutely no idea how the ancients knew what they did or accomplished (not just the pyramids) some of the things they did or any idea on why the ancients even wanted to accomplish some of the things they did. Instead, mainstream whatever you want to call them says, ""Well the explanation is uhh...well umm... err... Those Ancient Alien Theorist are crazy... Why would they think that? Let's discuss this pot shard.""
The evidence in these series is incredible and surely supports something incredible happened in our past that we just do not have the answers to. That's a given.
Some of the guests on the series may be reaching in a few areas but when there are things the ancients made that we cannot reproduce with our vast technologies, somethings not right and I want to know. Also I want to know how the ancients knew things before we knew them. There are some things we think we discovered just to find out, the ancients already knew.

I don't watch the program in its original television run. I wait for the whole season to become available on Amazon's streaming video service. Generally it's cheaper to buy once the whole season is complete. But not this time around.

People here have been complaining about the DVD version being labeled ""Season 5: Volume 1."" They say that there were only 12 episodes in season five and all are included in volume one. Amazon's streaming service disagrees; it lists 15 episodes in season five and has already begun compiling season six. Despite this, it's impossible to buy the full season five for one lump price; you have to purchase each episode individually.

So are there 12 episodes in season five, or are there 15? Why do the DVDs contain 12 episodes but call them volume one? Surely they're not going to release three episodes on a separate disk and call that volume two. Who is it that can't count? The History Channel or Amazon?

5793802,4,B00DEKKFBW,"Sometimes this series says some crazy stuff that seems like bs and there are a few episodes like that in this season but for the most part they focus on more unexplained impossible architecture in our distant past.  Some of the stuff is so crazy I gave this season four stars.  The crazies things they show are the blocks of stone.  The one piece stone towers, the gapless cut stone structures and the huge stone empty boxes in pyramids that all look the strangely similar all over the earth.  It does not prove that there were alien construction workers making things that do nothing today as far as we can tell.  The research does prove that ancient man was able to cut and lift stone far better than we are today.  This season is totally worth a look.",1383696000,,754,4.427536231884058
5793803,1,B00DEKKFBW,"""Ancient Aliens"" is getting more and more embarrassing. Apparently, the Vikings learned how to build ships and practice democracy from aliens. (I didn't know aliens had people's assemblies!) The Viking attack on Lindisfarne was literally led by aliens, and Odin's ravens were mechanical devices, a kind of spy drones. Odin himself was an alien sitting in a satellite circling our planet. Seriously, this is euhemerism on acid!

The Muslim prophet Muhammad was also on a first name basis with aliens, including one Gabriel. A UFO took him from Mecca to Jerusalem during his famous ""night's journey"". Maybe we can get rid of ""Ancient Aliens"" by tipping off some local Taliban sleeper cell? OK, that was a joke, but this stuff really rubs my alien, er, onion.

When will Erich von D&auml;niken & Co realize that there aren't just two alternative options when interpreting ancient myths: literalist fundamentalism and equally literalist ""materialism"", with the literal gods being literal aliens in nuts-and-bolts crafts. How about shamanic journeys, out-of-body experiences, astral worlds, etc? In a sense, ""Ancient Aliens"" mimic the literalness of the fundamentalism they are trying to expose, a literalness which in some cases might have been purely ""exoteric"". Talk about misplaced concreteness...

In a weird kind of way, this series actually makes the world less mysterious, less exciting, less enchanted... ""Ancient Aliens"" isn't just junk science. It's also bad spirituality.",1383436800,4,1478,5.445414847161572

The reason I am pleased along with the fact they offer an alternative way for the to arrive at the point we are in today. I do not think that the government knows anything that they would call secret in this area. I also like the way they explain how these large projects could have been constructed. Until the Ancient Alien series started there were only 2 groups and both functioned on conjecture and ratings that only a trained professional could honestly follow. I watched this on from front to back and there is a consistent theme, primitive people probably did not construct these large stones, so some sort of other worldly help would have been needed. I enjoyed this one and all the others.",1379894400,,709,4.590551181102362

5793833,3,B00DEKKFBW,"I need to give two different reviews one for the product and another for the season.  I do think Season 5 was an improvement from Season 4 which stretched into preposterous theories as alien involvement with ""Big-foot"" and ""Da Vinci.""  However, there is still plenty of rehash material here as Nazca and Easter Island(Monolith episode).  After the release of Ancient Aliens debunked you would think that they would be more aggressive in combating some of the scientific explanations offered for the phenomenon. For example, if you saw the original pilot of AA they do have scientific experts weighing-in on explanations to give a more scientific and impartial presentation.

Even if you don't believe in most of the AA theories the material and history offered on Tesla, Einstein, and some of the biblical prophets do make it worth watching. I thought the Von Daniken episode was mainly filler and self-patronage. They could have easily done an episode on another topic as Mothman, Men In Black, Chupacabra, or the Allagash Abductions which happened near an old native american mountain area.  I did like the episodes on Strange Abductions, Aliens and Cover-ups, and the Viking Gods.

My biggest problem is with how Lionsgate released the product itself.  I have the other season releases and this is the first one without the chapters for each episode.  This is inconvenient if you just want to watch individual segments of an episode instead of the entire 45 minutes.  The early sets all had this convenient option. Even the menu episodes are not full motion and just stay still like burned DVR.  They did add English subtitles for the first time which may help understand some of the commentators with heavy accents.  No lost footage added or special interviews. If you had burned the DVD's yourself it wouldn't be much worse than this minus the artwork and subtitles.

I give Season 5 four stars, and i give the DVD product 2 stars for the lack of chapters, overall this is why i give it a three out of five.  Hopefully, Season 6 which starts on September 30 and the following release is better than this.",1379808000,,2109,4.85754189944134
