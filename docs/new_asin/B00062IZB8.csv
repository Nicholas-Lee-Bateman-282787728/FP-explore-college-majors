8037146,4,B00062IZB8,"Excellent plot that is enhanced by the a-chronological presentation of an inspired editing team. The story is often funny, sometimes farcical, and possesses moments of truly heartfelt emotion. What begins as a story of ""awkward loser meets hot chick"" ultimately reveals itself as the story of an Every Man and his deepest yearning... the quest for the Female Divine exemplifying nurturing, kindness and beauty at an ethereal level. Kim Jung-hwa's performance is spot-on with a subtlety and nuance that is all too rare in films of any genre. Baek Il-seop portyal of spy-cum-surrogate father is masterful. As is the rule in cinema, this film, due to its genre, has been largely overlooked and under-credited.",1438905600,,706,5.201754385964913

8037148,2,B00062IZB8,"This was so forgettable, that I re-watched & didn't even remember it.  That's kinda sad since I wanted it to enjoy Gong Yoo's performance.  But it just wasn't written a way that had me rooting for their relationship.  That's hard to admit since I ALWAYS want Gong Yoo's relationships to work out in his Kdramas and movies.  So while I didn't hate it, I can't say it was so good that it lingers...",1389139200,,396,4.383561643835616
8037149,3,B00062IZB8,"Given its proximity to one of the world's most secretive states, it's perhaps no surprise that the South Korean box office is dominated by films about spies - whatever the genre. In that vein, this perfectly serviceable (if unoriginal) rom-com sees a hapless young dropout fall for a beautiful North Korean spy, who is working undercover at a Seoul 'Burger King' while hunting down a defector on the run from Pyongyang. Although the concept would later be redone - and far better - in 2009's My Girlfriend Is An Agent, those looking for a charming and inoffensive romp could do a lot worse than this...

Spy Girl begins from the perspective of Ko-bong, a perpetual loser whose bachelor status is a constant source of ridicule. Hoping to inspire the lovelorn chap, Ko-bong's friends direct him to a website they've set up that allows young men from across Seoul to share pictures of attractive girls working in local fast food restaurants. Ko-bong - along with half the population of Seoul, it seems - soon falls head over heels for newcomer Hyo-jin, who is described on the site as being ""so beautiful, anyone who doesn't know her is a North Korean spy"".

You can probably guess where this is going.

After switching to Hyo-jin's perspective, we learn that she actually is a spy for the North and is in Seoul to track down a defector wanted for embezzlement. The fast food job is a useful cover for this, but when Hyo-jin stumbles across the 'hotties' website - and misinterprets the ""North Korean spy"" reference as blowing her cover - she quickly tracks down the owners of the site to demand they delete her photos. They agree, but on one condition: Hyo-jin has to go on a 'blind' date with their friend, Ko-bang. And so it begins.

In one sense, it is difficult to criticise Spy Girl because it delivers much of what it promises at the outset: some proper laughs, a sprinkle of genuine charm and lots of screen time for the strikingly attractive Kim Jung-hwa. But even judged by this lower standard, it isn't a perfect film by any means. I think what ultimately lets it down is its lack of clear focus and direction. Perhaps due to the dual-perspective opening, the whole film feels like it's just setting the scene for something bigger; it never really gets out of that 'first act' mentality into something approaching a conventional narrative.

By the time we approach the final act, then, we're still not really sure if the two protagonists are even in a relationship, let alone if it's a strong one. This obviously makes it difficult to empathise with the characters when they face inevitable tough decisions towards the end. So although there's plenty of genuine laughs and some very funny scenes along the way, the overall structure for those scenes seems sadly lacking.

But perhaps I'm being too harsh. This isn't meant to be taken seriously: it's a fun, leave-your-brain-at-the-door romantic comedy that hopes to raise a smile or two en route to a warm and fuzzy ending. Judged by that standard, Spy Girl succeeds - although if you haven't yet seen the similarly themed (and quite brilliant) My Girlfriend Is An Agent, you might want to check that out first.

6/10 - more than watchable.",1369958400,,3198,4.751351351351351
8037150,2,B00062IZB8,I purchased this dvd to brush up on my Korean.  I guess it did help me with that.  Unfortunately it was childish and lacked any substance.,1286150400,,138,4.269230769230769

8037152,4,B00062IZB8,"This movie is great if you either understand Korean or don't mind R-language subtitles. The plot was really good and they couldn't have picked a more attractive girl to play the leading role. I don't understand why the people that do the subtitles for these things though, don't use a little more mild language. This was a movie obviously targeted towards a more family audience with no innapropriate scenes while still managing to have a great love story. Why do they have to put f words into the English subtitles in every other sentence?

But like I said, if you don't mind that kind of language or understand Korean, this was an awesome movie. Great story, great characters and really funny, even though it was in another language.",1155340800,6,735,4.7421875
