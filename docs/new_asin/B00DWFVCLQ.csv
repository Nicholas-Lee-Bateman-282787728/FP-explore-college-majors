5861552,5,B00DWFVCLQ,"My boys, like most out there today, are crazy about super heroes! This new VeggieTales DVD, The League of Incredible Vegetables takes the fun super hero ideas, and integrates them into a deeper message. Psalms 56:3 ""When I am afraid, I put my trust in you"" is the theme of this newest DVD. We were blessed with an early copy of this DVD to enjoy, and let me say, if the fact that we've already watched it over, and over, and over is any proof, we are not disappointed!

True to the VeggieTales form, you'll find hilarious one liners mixed in with a bit of sarcastic humor that keeps all ages laughing. We already know two members of ""The League"" LarryBoy and his assistant Alfred, but now you get the opportunity to meet Thingamabob, Vogue, S-cape, and Ricochet.  I don't want to include any spoilers here, but I'll just say that one of my favorite parts was finding out what each of the heroes biggest fears are. Monkeys anyone?

Kids will realize that with God's help, they don't have to be afraid, and with Him even little children can make a big difference. The life lesson and overall moral of the story was simple enough that my four year old was able to grasp it, but also one that is a great reminder for the older kids (and well, grown-ups too). I've got my fingers crossed that this won't be the last time we see The League in action.",1350604800,,1344,4.389558232931727

5861554,5,B00DWFVCLQ,"You cannot even imagine the excitement around our house when the trailer for The League of Incredible Vegetables came on before another Veggie Tales movie.

And then I showed it to the boys :)

The DVD arrived in our mailbox the other day and it did not disappoint! My super heroes needed to get into character right away!

The message of The League of Incredible Vegetables is one of overcoming fear - a message my boys picked up on very clearly in the first watching.

In fact, my 6yo told me his favorite part was when Junior realized he no longer had anything to fear because he trusted in God! And then my heart melted...

Obviously, my 4yo liked ""the part where the little guy bounces all over the place!"" {said with wild, crazy hand movements to illustrate}

And my favorite part? The AWESOME theme song from the Newsboys!

I LOVE having a super hero movie for the boys that focuses on the true source of all our strength and power! Thank you, Big Idea!",1350259200,,960,4.451428571428571
5861555,4,B00DWFVCLQ,"When the Video arrived my 4 crazy kids were jumping around the house they were so excited it had arrived.  They then preceded to get into costume.  We popped popcorn and set down to watch the movie.

The kids were engulfed in the movie.  The Songs were great.

When we got done watching the show we worked on the CRAFT and printed off the coloring pages!

The League of Incredible Vegetables provides a lesson of how to conquer your fears while reminding them that we don't have to be afraid, because God is always looking out for us! It also offers parents the opportunity to talk with their kids about the true meaning of heroism... no mask or cape required.
Verse: ""When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You."" Psalm 56:3

The reason for one less star is because they talked about bladders and pull-ups.  We watch veggie-tales because they usually don't have this type of crude humor.",1350259200,13,889,4.478260869565218
5861556,5,B00DWFVCLQ,"My family really enjoyed this new VeggieTales video. It's available in Christian stores and comes out here at Amazon, Walmart, etc next Tuesday. We have always loved LarryBoy - but it was fun to see new Veggie super heroes. Loved the theme that when I am afraid, I can trust in God. Lot's of funny lines for parents too! Great job Big Idea!!

5861557,5,B00DWFVCLQ,Thanks for offering this product. We bought it for our Children to watch instead of partaking in Halloween this year. It is more along the lines of our beliefs and teaches good values while being entertaining.,1349827200,2,209,4.833333333333333
5861558,5,B00DWFVCLQ,"I was able to watch and review a pre-lease copy of this DVD and I really enjoyed it. All your favorite characters get to be super heroes in this adventure as they team up to help Larry Boy, and in the process, learn how to handle fear. Using David against Goliath as an example, Junior learns that God is with him and that there is no need to fear.

The bad guys do a good job of being bad but not scary, so my 3 year old was never scared.

The silly song wasn't the funniest one they have done, but it was still funny. It is called Supper Hero, and it is about a supper hero who will come finish your plate when you have food you don't want to eat.

This movie has a very goof, clear message about trusting in God when we are scared.",1349395200,13,734,3.945945945945946
5861559,5,B00DWFVCLQ,"I was able to buy a pre-release of the League of Incredible Vegetables, and I was thoroughly impressed.  From the music video (Newsboys), to how well it relates to kids (both boys and girls), to the clear presentation of the biblical values regarding trust, faith, and fear.  Both my 7 year old and 4 year old love it.  Heck, who am I kidding?  I love it.

It's also great to finally see Bob realize his dream of being a super-hero.",1347926400,15,432,4.35

We truly enjoyed the movie and ensure you too will have a smile in store for the ones you watch it with as well.  Another good job Bob!",1347840000,15,367,3.8666666666666667

5861570,5,B00DWFVCLQ,"VeggieTales has their over version of The Avengers.

There was another group of heroes back in the day called The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen which this title is based off of but most of the kids will think of The Avengers when watching this movie.

A new villain wants to freeze the city in fear. LarryBoy can't tackle him on his own so he needs the help of more heroes.

Junior is the character that learns the lesson about fear and turning to God.

The animation is solid. The acting and message are top notch like they typically are from a VeggieTale flick.

The most important thing for parents to know is that my two boys were glued to the screen when this was playing. In fact, they request it now for every movie night. It isn't too scary for young eyes and they learn a well-known but valuable lesson in turning to God when afraid.

The theme song is performed by The Newsboys so you know it will get your kids up and dancing.'

The bonus features were surprisingly substantial.

The only thing of critique is, from an adult point of view, I thought the Silly Song was a bit weak this time. Hairbrush song, it was not.

5861582,5,B00DWFVCLQ,Our favorite VeggieTales show.,1434067200,,30,6.75
5861583,5,B00DWFVCLQ,"After the last couple of years, I was expecting the October VeggieTales release to be another Christmas video.  But they must not have had any ideas because instead they released The League of Incredible Vegetables.  Yes, it does feel a bit like a bid to cash in on the success of The Avengers, but it is fun all the same.

In answer to a letter from a child who is very fearful, we return to Bumblyburg to reunite with LarryBoy (Larry the Cucumber).  Actually, the show starts with Larry, Junior Asparagus, and Laura Carrot touring the Science Museum.  Junior is too afraid to try any of the exhibits.  And then we see the Fear Dar.  It uses a ray to detect what you are afraid of, produces it, and then uses the power of your fear to freeze you.

The problem is, the mad scientist who invented it wants to use it to take over the world, so he sends in his penguin minions to steal it.  The situation is so dire that not only does LarryBoy answer, but the rest of the League of Incredible Veggietales.  Will their combined powers be enough to stop the menace?  And will Junior make a good addition to the team?

While LarryBoy has always reminded me a bit of Batman, the rest of the league doesnt feel like any superhero in particular.  Theres S-Cape (Mr. Lunt) who can escape from anything.  Vogue (Petunia Rhubarb) can turn her suit into anything useful, as long as it is in style.  And Thingamabob (Bob the Tomato) has a belt he can pull any useful tool or device from.

Ive got to admit, from the title I was expecting a lesson about teamwork or getting along with others or something like that.  And they could have easily gone that route.  I actually like the fact that they didnt.  The League is nothing but supportive and cooperative with each other.  And considering this is the first time weve seen everyone but LarryBoy, its nice they didn't go the easy route.

Of course, you could complain that theyve already done a lesson on fear  way back in their first video.  But since that was 20 years ago, I have no problem with them tackling the subject again.  It helps that they work the lesson into the story naturally.  After all, Junior must learn to put his faith in God to overcome his fears and save the day.

Plus the video is fun.  Boys who haven't connected with the last couple entries that were aimed at girls will certainly get a kick out of all the action here.  There are some great laughs at the superhero genre as well.  And the story moves forward quickly, not wasting any of the 50 minute running time.  (Be sure to check out Bob for the ending counter wrap around for another couple good laughs.)

The computer animation in this video looks good.  You'll never confuse it with the big budget stuff that Pixar or Dreamworks puts out, but it definitely gets the job done well.  The voices, mostly done by series founders Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki, are great as well.

And we get a Silly Song with LarryBoy.  As the League is sitting down to eat, LarryBoy isn't excited about eating his Brussels sprouts and sauerkraut.  Fortunately, thats when Supper Hero shows up.  They use Jerry Gourd in the part, who is always hungry, so you can imagine how things get out of hand.

All told, this is a great addition to not only the VeggieTales series but also LarryBoy in particular.  Fans of both will want to get The League of Incredible Vegetables.",1433635200,,3372,4.447712418300654

What bugged me the most?  What they (the writers) did to Petunia.
The token-female.  Her primary concern is that her super-hero outfit is stylish.  Her car looks like a big pink shoe, one of her few lines is about shopping for shoes, and her worst fear is ""Bad Hair Day.""

Come on, really? That's all you got, ""Big Idea""?  (I'm thinkin' a name change might be appropriate...)

And since superheros are kinda big right now i felt like it was a really great move to make a dvd with them. it gives kids a better way to go about things when they watch this instead of a secular superhero show.

It is much more action-packed that even Larry Boy movies with lots of louder music and car chases, action, but my girls LOVED it until they broke it on a car trip!

Great message about trusting God.

Only real disappointment was SweetPea/Petunia's super hero identity of ""Vogue"".  Why? The message of Sweetpea Beauty was all about how beauty on the inside is what matters.  Now her character is all about looking fashionable and shopping.  So many other directions they could have gone with her.  Girls as super heroes are rare.  The Veggie Tales gang really blew it in this regard.

Unlike some other reviewers, my favorite part of this is the Newsboys theme song. I find myself singing it from time to time for no reason. Not going to be a ""classic"" veggie tales one day like Dave and the Giant Pickle  or Madam Blueberry, but for Bob and Larry lovers like our house, it's good family fun.",1360368000,,503,4.28421052631579

 It is wonderful to be able to share with children the values of Godly conduct without the hero (as seems to always be the case with the big Hollywood movies) to be as immoral and use the same dishonorable tactics as their alleged foe. Jesus said ""love your enemies"", and that may mean holding them accountable for their behaviors and responsible for their bad conduct, but it does not mean becoming like them in order to stop them from being how they are!

We've been fans of veggie tales for quite some time and have seen, I believe, all of the videos/DVDs that have come on the market in the last few years. My kids particularly like Larry boy, and in this DVD Larry Boy along with all of his friends get to be superheroes, which for my girls was even better.

As a parent, I truly appreciate and enjoy the message that the veggie tale videos are sharing with kids today. The message of faith and trust in God is one that I want to install my own kids and this DVD, as well as all of the DVDs in the series, do a wonderful job at presenting spirituality without it being too intrusive, instead making it fun.

While learning about God and what God does for them, viewers also get to experience some very catchy music that will stay not only in your mind letting your kids' minds too. My kids are still singing some of the songs even though we don't have the DVD playing.

All-in-all, I have to say that this was another great addition to the whole veggie tales line of movies. Whether you are already a fan, or this is your first video, I know that you will be impressed!",1355788800,,1290,4.131474103585657

This DVD is great because it features the VeggieTales as superheroes!  My boys (4 and 5) are obsessed with superheroes right now and there are not many shows featuring superheroes that are appropriate for their ages.

""The League of the Incredibles"" features silly songs, wholesome lessons, and bad guys.  Don't worry though the bad guys are not overtly bad or scary.  The lessons are all about freindship, working together, being brave and trusting in God.  Yes this DVD does have a religious aspect to it (as do all the VeggieTales movies) but its not overpowering.  The story flows, the songs are catchy, the characters are fun, and overall this is my boy's favorite VeggieTales so far.

I must say that the music was not appropriate for their ages, 2 and 4 years old. Never have I had to be concerned with anything the Veggie Tale producers provide for entertainment until now. This is one of two new movies that have music for adults or teens intertwined with the movie. It seems they are promoting these groups, but please not on Veggie Tales!

If you're a super hero fan (or even if you're not), you're sure to enjoy and laugh at this latest VeggieTales/LarryBoy dvd. Many kids (and adults) struggle with fear, and this story tackles the topic of fear head-on. Junior Asparagus is offered the opportunity to join The League after he helps some of The League members when they were in need. Junior believes that wearing a super suit will help take away all of his fears. He soon learns that even as Richocet he is plagued with many fears. It's not until he learns the only way to conquer his fears is to trust the Lord that he is finally able to become a true super hero.

We enjoyed this fun VeggieTales play on super heroes. The witty, funny banter in the story had us laughing to the very end. Fear is such a big part of many kids lives that I really appreciate the fact that VeggieTales decided to tackle the topic in a fun way. It was good to have kids see that even super heroes have fears. Even the smallest/youngest among us can do great things with the Lord's help.

5861688,5,B00DWFVCLQ,"I have to say this is the best Veggie video they have made. I have been doing reviews for Veggie Tales for some time now. For a while, Big Idea has been struggling after Phil Vischer lost control of the company but they have been coming back strong in the last few years. ( I HIGHLY recommned his book, ""Me, Myself & Bob that tells the story.)

The characters were great!  I am also glad to see them finally use Bob again in a video.  In my opinion, they just don't use him enough in the stories.  (Yeah, he is my favorite Veggie. Not that I don't like like Larry; but Bob is da man....er Veggie!)  They did a great job in developing each hero's powers & personalities.  The music was really, really good.  The Newsboys did the theme song for the League and it was so catchy.  I hope they release it on mp3 soon.

As far as the message goes, when I heard that they just got bought out by Dreamworks (the makers of Shrek, etc) I have some fears that the ""Christian"" message present in so many Veggie Tales is going to fade away to just being a ""be a good kid just because"" message. I will keep my fingers crossed. If this video is any indication though , we Veggie fans have nothing to worry about. It was right on. The moral? God is bigger than all our fears.  If we know Him, we have nothing to fear from anything.  It is a message a lot of adults as well as children need to hear.

The story line flows along great.  As a matter of fact I couldn't believe it was 45 min long; it felt like 20 min.  The usual silliness is there (and some real funny one-liners)  I didn't think the silly song was all that great but it wasn't the worst either.

We have every Veggie Tale ever released (some old ones on vhs) and everyone in the house agrees; this is the best one they have made.  You will not be disappointed in this one.",1351296000,8,1821,4.113314447592068
