1811100,3,B00007H005,"The terrible reviews of the ""movie"" Darkest Knight didn't jibe with what my husband and I saw when we watched it, so I thought I'd do a bit of research.

The opening scenes and credits struck us both as more like a TV series than a movie -- and it turns out that it's exactly what this is.  ""Dark Knight"" ran for two seasons in New Zealand and England.  ""Darkest Knight"" is the series premiere, turned into a DVD for North American release.

Looked at as a TV show, it's really not THAT bad, certainly no worse than Xena, Hercules or any of the similar semi-historic fantasy shows that were so popular a few years ago.  The special effects are impressive for a television show.

Even as a movie, it's not the worst I've ever seen.  The production is beautiful (who cares if there aren't palm trees in England, they look nice), the music is good, etc.  I've certainly seen worse acting.  Want to see something truly unwatchable, check out ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" or ""Incredibly Strange Creatures who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies"", or any of Coleman Francis' films (e.g., ""Red Zone Cuba"").  Now THOSE are some TERRIBLE movies.",1079136000,8,1141,4.603960396039604
1811101,2,B00007H005,"If this movie is taking itself seriously, then it's one of the funniest things I've seen for a long time. If it is a spoof, then it failed miserably.
The first option seems to be the case, though, so I will say ""Never have I laughed harder...at the bad guys."" They used digital effects in some scenes, so what I can't figure out is, why was the first minion/bad guy/demon made of a helium balloon and a black towel? And, as such, why didn't the peasants who were trapped and going to be attacked by said demon...why didn't they just pop it? Forget their safety pins, did they?
While watching this lemon, I thought it was something from the 70's, but the CGI's should have clued me in to the recent release date. Sadly, its 2002 copyright date makes it even more ludicrous that the chief bad guy is named...Mordor. I could understand using such a name, maybe 10 years ago when most people familiar with that word would have been Tolkien geeks. But to use it now, after most of the population of the U.S., Great Britain, and New Zealand, has watched a blockbuster action adventure mega-flick, with Mordor featuring huge as a LAND of great EVIL. I just don't understand. Pretty much anyone watching Darkest Knight, because it's a fantasy movie, is going to have HEARD of Mordor, already...doh. And it's NOT a man versed in the black arts. It's a PLACE. A FAMOUS place.
Another thing, which makes me think...""They're spoofing. Right?""
There's a monk. And his name is Friar Bacon. And they pronounce his name ""Fry Bacon "" Must be a spoof. Except, Odo the dwarf provides comic relief, and a movie that is overall funny, doesn't NEED comic relief. Not a spoof.
The overall look of the the movie is okay. Costuming is colorful and detailed, and when Ivanhoe (the hero), Rebecca, the heroine/witch/wonder woman (only, her steel wrist bands are hidden under her flowing Renaissance garb), and Odo the dwarf on his pony are together, the scenes are reminiscent of a favorite book in our household, based on Spenser's Faerie Queen: a knight of the Crusades w/chain mail under white tunic, with a red cross on the breast; a slender, red-haired woman in flowing, shapely clothing; and a bearded dwarf in yellow, with curly dark hair on a spotted pony.
Many scenes in this movie reminded me of other works, not only the lovely artwork in book already mentioned, but also famous musicals: the Screaming Marshes looks JUST LIKE the ""Mazeltov"" scene in Fiddler on the Roof...no, the scene in Time Machine, where the hunters jump up from their camouflage under piles of dirt and leaves!
We rented this video because we wanted to see dragons, and there are dragons on the cover, and dragons are mentioned in the blurb on the back...but there are no dragons. Only helium balloon demons and snapping slime water teeth monsters...oh! and a wild boar. There's a pretty ugly dead person made into a bloody mess that chases after our hero. The boar disappears into a pink sparkly mist. The ugly dead guy thanks our hero, before collapsing and then dissolving into a fine BLUE mist.
At any rate, this was a huge laugh for the family and friends who shared the experience. If it WAS a spoof...I'm sorry. Not funny.",1076976000,,3186,4.660746003552398
1811102,1,B00007H005,"Sub-par even by the standards of throw-down direct-to-video B-movies, _Darkest Knight_ will disappoint all but the most ardent fan of truly unwatchable badfilm. A cavalcade of cliched heroes and villains apparently drawn at random from 3000 years of history and myth throw trade-school CG effects at one another, while displaying costumes (and acting) that would get them run out of any drunken SCA weekend outing at spearpoint.
Awful by any standard, _Darkest Knight_ fails to make good on even the modest promises made by the cover graphic and trailer. (I'll admit I was drawn in by the images on the box of flying dragons spouting flame. They appear nowhere in the actual movie. Think I have a case to sue for my four bucks back?)
Sound in plain stereo and a 4:3 aspect ratio make, in this age of DTS and 16:9, for a presentation nearly as lacking as the content. Possibly amusing - albeit unchallenging - fare for MST3K-style mockery, but unrewarding else. Oh, and naturally they're planning a sequel. Imagine my delight.",1074556800,17,1025,4.896551724137931
1811103,5,B00007H005,"If you like movies such as First Knight, Excalibur, Labyrinth, Legend, Willow, and others in the Medieval Fantasy genere you will love this. The story is based on Ivanhoe and its pure fun! My family enjoyed it. Its true that its not as flashy as some of the other fantasy movies, but unless your extremely nit picky you should enjoy this.",1072396800,,338,4.557377049180328
1811104,3,B00007H005,"It seems like this was an attempt at bringing the famous story of Ivanhoe to the ""Hercules and Xena"" and ""Dragonheart"" audience. As this program begins, King Richard is a prisoner in Austria, and Ivanhoe escapes to get back to England where Prince John is trying to seize control, and Ivanhoe's father, Cedric of Rotherwood, has disowned him for going on crusade, despite the pleas of his ward, Rowena. In the end there is a reconcilliation between Ivanhoe and his father. Any other simillarities between this story and the one written by Sir Walter Scott are completely non-existent.
In this version, there is an evil wizard named ""Mordour,"" played by Christopher Neame (the hired killer from ""Steel Dawn"") who is attempting to call forth the demon of Set (or something like that) to take over the world, while he ostensibly helps Prince John take over England. Ivanhoe meets up with ""Rebecca,"" a healer-warrior (no mention is made of her religeon, Jewish or otherwise), and ""Odo,"" a card shark, low-level magician, and pickpocket, who both join him on his journey. They have sufficient adventures for two TV episodes, in which a friar tells them to seek ""The Last Druid"" who gives them the ""Runestaff"" with which they can gain the ""Serpent's Egg"" which only one ""Pure of Heart"" can achieve, and then use it to defeat the computer-animated terror called forth by Mordour.
There is plenty of sword-swinging action, which is actually done rather capably. There are also a lot of computer-generated effects, which are pretty obvious and not too convincing. While the motion of the animated terrors is nice and smooth (which was always a problem in the days of stop-motion), they just don't look quite real. The computer-art shots of castles and countryside, etc., likewise cannot escape an air of artificiality. Ben Pullen as Ivanhoe reminds me of Brent Huff (""The Perils of Gwendolyn..."") without the sense of humor. The cover of the video implies that dragons are flying over castles spitting flame. It lies. There are no flying dragons.
This isn't as bad as some fantasy sword-swinging adventures, but it is not one of the greatest. The swordfights are good to watch and there are plenty of them. There are a few seconds of good drama and the comic relief character (Odo) actually proves himself useful to the adventure. These plusses, however, don't quite bring it above the level of it's general air of lameness. The acting in general, the reliance upon computer-animated monsters to give shock and thrill, and certain moments of the writing decsending into absurdity bring this down.",1058659200,,2587,4.976905311778291
1811170,1,B00007H005,"This is my most prized DVD, for the simple reason that I know it will not be possible for me to find any form of entertainment that is any worse.

I've started to enjoy inflicting it on my friends, saying ""no wait- it's getting to the good part"" just to keep them watching and then laughing when it gets to the end that it still was bad.

Basically, it's just like Hercules, but Ivanhoe instead, British, and has worse special effects.

I think everyone should own a copy, just so that they can watch something bad, then say ""at least it wasn't as bad as Darkest Knight.""",1123286400,3,571,4.317757009345795
1811171,3,B00007H005,"I had no idea what to expect when I picked up a copy of ""Darkest Knight,"" but I'm a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy movies, so I thought I'd give it a look-see.  It was apparent to me from the beginning that it was a TV series, and that this must be a couple of episodes cobbled together to form a feature-length DVD release.  I wasn't surprised to find out that it was a New Zealand production...it definitely had the look and feel of a ""Xena"" or ""Hercules"" clone, right down to the occasional tropical plant in what was supposed to be an English forest.

All in all, it's really not that bad...well, okay, it's that bad. The acting can be WAY over the top, and the special effects are pretty cheesy by most anybody's standards.  But that doesn't stop it from being a completely enjoyable romp.  It reminds me of Saturday morning TV shows I used to watch when I was a kid.  Sometimes it's fun to just kick back and watch the hero save the day, even if Sir Walter Scott is spinning in his grave right now.

So...skip ""Darkest Knight"" if you're a purist, but if you want to spend a rainy afternoon with a good ""bad"" movie, you might actually enjoy this one.",1099699200,2,1154,4.26605504587156
1811172,5,B00007H005,"Having read my husband's review of ""Darkest Knight"", I see it as necessary that I give a truer and more metaphysical review of this spectacular movie both to avoid divorce preceedings and to speak to the refined and spiritual movie audiance. Ben Pullen gives a remarkable performance as Ivanhoe! He is the idealistic knight that the movie world needs more of. His portrayal is realistic and down to earth - a very believable knight and a man of integrity and honor. Charlotte Comer is both beautiful and realistic as a healer. I would have liked a bit of history on her warrior skills, but they are in harmony with the time period and very well done. Her portrayal of Rebecca is compelling in its sensitivity and a worthy example of all women today who need to know that sensitive is not meant to mean ""victimized!"" It is Rebecca who holds Ivanhoe back from unnecessary killing and it is also Rebecca who discerned the monster before the cave as an illusion to be walked through. The way that the masculine and feminine work together here is very well done.  This is an excellent historical fantasy and a very serious story. Peter O""Farrell as Odo brings what humor there is to this movie but it is neither campy nor tongue-in-cheek. Odo is a gambler and a thief which Ivanhoe overlooks, to his credit. The characters are what they are in this movie and there is no overt criticism even regarding the greedy Prince John or the sorcerer, Mordour. This is a good movie for children, pre-teens and teens. The worst monster is a Frankenstein-like creature that wouldn't raise an eyebrow from TV viewers of BUFFY, The Vampire Slayer and Angel.

The demon from hell resembles our old Velasor-raptor dinosaur friends from Jurassic Park movies. I give this movie 5 stars because of its writer's clearness of characters, realism, lack of vulgar language,and honest dialogue. The writer portrays goodness as an ideal to be lived, not as something for cowards to find refuge in. Here, holy does not mean helpless, overly pious or abusively dogmatic--it just means the plain everyday goodness that is the joy and right and privelege of every human being to live and reflect.",1099699200,7,2162,4.778074866310161

They've just released all 12 episodes over here; I don't know why they only released the first episode here and made it look like a movie. This isn't what Dark Knight was designed to be. The joy of this show was the character development and interactions over the two series (which was far too few).

As the series Dark Knight it is a wonderful mixture of sword, sourcery and romance. I hate the comparisons with Hercules, Xena etc. because Dark Knight was so much more real and complete than such shows. The characters were intriguing and the stories were different and interesting, and far from predictable as I have read elsewhere.

The comments on the acting of the main characters I take offence at. Ivanhoe's character was wonderful, and different from other shows. He was strong, loyal and courageous, but quiet, serious in his mission to return King Richard to the throne, and not a ladies' man. Is this what people are complaining about? Was he not your usual hero? If so, then why should all main characters be the same? What more are you looking for? I loved this character. The way his heart softened over time was extremely endearing. It was a joy to see the moments of comedy or tenderness between the charatcers.

It is the fault of whoever released just the first episode, not the actors or writers.

One final thing, both Charlotte Comer (Rebecca) and Ben Pullen (Ivanhoe) are gorgeous, one beautiful and one ruggedly handsome. I'm happy to return to Dark Knight if only to watch them!!",1146873600,8,1569,4.653429602888087
