8077563,5,B000AC7OLG,"This anime is cute. VERY CUTE! I just love how the little fairies imaginations sometimes goes arwy, it just makes the show more cuter! I also love how each fairy has her own neat personality. And the songs are so adorable!",1181347200,5,222,4.439024390243903
8077564,3,B000AC7OLG,This anime is adorable but the story is a bit of a snoozer and did not hold my attention for long though my 5 yr old loved it. So I gave it to her. I believe this is meant for a younger audience but it never stopped me from loving other animes like it before. Reading others reviews I see they enjoyed it. It just was not my cup of tea though.,1155945600,,343,3.7777777777777777
8077565,5,B000AC7OLG,"As the DVD box states, with Bottle Fairy, the cute little anime series about 4 charming and cute little fairies named Chiriri, Hororo, Kururu, and Sarara, we discover and learn about the culture of the Japanese through the eyes of four little fairies.  Each episode covers a different month of the year and is loaded with comical scenes, magical moments and these adorable girls along with their mentor Sensei-San who takes care of them as well as their friends Tama-Chan the first grader that has a very big imagination and Oboro-Chan the little flying catlike toy they brought to life with magic which is just a small taste of things to come in the series.  Despite being a 24 year old boy I must say that I seriously enjoyed the show as I've watched all 13 episodes (including the other 7 from Volume 2) and I do recommend this series to all my friends.  Some of my particularly favorite episodes included episode 1 which covers some of the spring events like the Sakura Festival and June when they learn about love which ends up taking them on a big fantasy world adventure.

As for other thigns like the bonuses at the end of this DVD, I loved so very much how they include every single episodes unique ending without credits as I am a big fan of not leaving anything out.  So overall I give this one a 5 out of 5.  Its cute, its funny and you learn a lot.  Dont miss your chance to add this set to your collection as I personally felt it was well worth the money for them.",1141171200,9,1478,4.372262773722627
8077566,4,B000AC7OLG,"Four cute little fairies wish to become human and think that by studying and roleplaying elements of Japanese culture, they can attain their goal. The problem is that most of their information either comes from print sources or the entirely too smart but really too dumb for her own good neighbor, Tama-chan. The four fairies already don't have a clue, but when this over energetic grade-schooler interferes, misunderstandings become compounded. The four fairies have to look after their master's house, a college student who is hardly ever home to teach the girls. So they end up playing out their new cultural skills in their imaginations which make for some hilarious fun. For example when they read an ad in a magazine touting summer as a time for adventure, they imagine that one of them has been kidnapped, and they have to go through jungles, climb mountains, and explore pyramids in an effort to find her.

I really enjoyed this first dvd of Bottle Fairy. Yes, it's cute but beyond that, it's just plain funny! Seeing them play out the roles of pirates, soldiers, or the heroines of shojo romances just adds to the humor. There are no bad taste jokes here or dark melancholy humor. This is a feel-good show that makes you smile. Seek it out if you want to experience a good mood.",1135123200,8,1287,4.72
8077567,4,B000AC7OLG,"Whimsical. Innocent. Curious. Adventurous. Bottle Fairy is all these things, but above all, it's about cuteness. It's not just ""Hello Kitty"" cute. It's not ""that thing your lady friend does with her nose when she's mad"" cute. This is a wiltingly, terrifyingly, opressively cute show.

It sells itself as a way to get to know certain aspects of Japanese culture, as told through the eyes of four tiny, overwhelmingly cute fairies, who are learning themselves. In reality, it's just an excuse; an excuse to cram as many mortifyingly cute things into as short a timeframe as possible.

 The ""super-deformed"" or Chibi style is instantly comfortable, the main characters are instantly likeable, and the themes and concepts are instantly accessible. If you manage to hack your way through to stupifying jungle of cuteness, you may just find yourself nintey minutes older and a little bit wiser.",1134691200,5,888,5.110344827586207
8077568,4,B000AC7OLG,"This series is ridiculously cute. I'm glad it's being released on DVD, however I will be holding out until all the eps. are released together and at a more reasonable price!  This series is full of imagination and adventure.  Anyone remember Muppet Babies? If you loved it, and you love anime cuteness, you'll love Bottle Fairy.",1129075200,3,328,4.839285714285714
8077569,4,B000AC7OLG,"I have seen the whole Bottle Fairy series, and they are SO cute.  However, this dvd is over-priced in my opinion.  It's a cute series, but this is the price I would be willing to pay for the WHOLE thing, not just half of it!

Bottle Faries is about 4 little fairies trying to become human. They live with a 20-something male whom you never learn much about.  The fairies want to do everything humans do, but they get comically mixed up, and there-in lies the cuteness.  There is one episode for each month of the year, and the activities of the bottle faries in each episode has something to do with that particular month, (fireworks in July, Thanksgiving in November, etc.)  The series doesn't have a great plot, it's all just random cuteness.",1128729600,6,744,4.514925373134329
8077570,4,B000AC7OLG,"Now I haven't seen the DVD their selling (since it's not out yet) but I have seen the entire series (13)eps.

I'm assuming that this is the first 6 eps. And I's so happy there subbing them! I loved the whole bunch! What's better than 4 cute fairy's that are 2 inches tall looking to learn more about earth? This is in an interesting format, each eps is a different month...IE: March, April...you get the point. Over all I loved the show that I saw...so I'm excited to see the legal version and how well they translate some of the funnier parts, which ushually have to do with the fairy's missunderstanding words, or thinking they mean somthing else...which is easy to do since lots of japanese words mean more than one thing in different context. On a side note, do not be looking for a huge plot here, it's funny and very bubbly, but there really isn't much of a plot...if you enjoy Digi Charat then you will like this!",1127692800,3,920,4.411764705882353
