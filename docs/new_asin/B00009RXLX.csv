7993289,5,B00009RXLX,"Perfectly danced you can see the Russian dancers of ballet. There are also some guest stars, but not
so many as in the vol. 2 which is my absolute favourite. On the other hand you can look to 14 different
pieces during 140 minutes. And directly at the beginning you can see ""Le spectre de la rose"" which
was created by Nijinsky, called the god of dance.",1422748800,,353,4.2835820895522385

After seeing this copy you might be hard pressed to believe that the second in the series could possibly be better, but in fact it is.

Mixed bill ballet programs such as this are a lot of fun. Why? Well, the main reason is because they are always the best and most beloved dances of the ballets they are taken from. Also, you can pause and come back to the program w/o losing the storyline, etc.  Some of the Pas are not excerpts of longer ballets, but are complete mini ballets, such as the first Pas on each disc. The first Pas on disc number one is the beautiful LA SPECTRE DE LA ROSE w/Nina Ananiashvili and Faruhk Ruzimatov. Nina performs in four other dances guaranteed to entertain you, the GRAND PAS DE DEUX from SLEEPING BEAUTY, partnered by Aleksei Fadeechev (sometimes spelled Fadeyetchev and Fadeyechev you choose, same guy), THE DYING SWAN, made famous by Maya Plisetskaya, MOODS w/music by the husband of Maya Plisetskaya, Rodion Shchedrin, and the Grand pas from DON QUIXOTE, the final dance on both volumes, the second being more grand than the first.

Volume one is filmed in a letterbox format, has good stereo sound excellent lighting w/plain or draped backgrounds at Japans Bunkamura Orchard Hall on December 3,1991, w/ Aleksandr Sotnikov conducting the Japanese Orchestra.

One of the very best reviewers of ballet, Ivy Lin comments on the ""boneless"" arms of Maya Plisetskaya as Maya dances the famous ""Dying Swan"" ballet, and I must agree that Maya has beautiful seemingly boneless arms, but there is a ballerina featured on this DVD whose armes a just as ""boneless"". She is Nina Ananiashvili. When she does her quick little wing flutter, you would swear she is beginning to soar. I've only seen one other ballerina dance the Dying Swan and that would be Natalia Makarova who is also very good. The ballerina I WANT to see dance it is Gillian Murphy, but I may never get to. Gillian Murphy shows an example of her fabulous arms in her transformation scene from Odette to Swan at the close of Act 2 in the ABT version of Swan Lake.....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-Swan-Lake-American-Ballet-Theatre-Murphy-Corella/dp/B000AYEI9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake / American Ballet Theatre, Murphy, Corella</a>.",1257206400,8,2696,5.552311435523114
7993292,5,B00009RXLX,"Nina Ananiashvilli took with her ,to Tokyo, some of the greatest dancers ,in 1991 and 1993. I cannot think of anything more enjoyable than these 2 volume DVD!The famous Pas de quatre(music by Cesare Pugni),choreographed by Perrot for his wife,Carlotta Grisi,Maria Taglioni,Fanny Cerrito and Lucille Grahn (it would have been a Pas de Cinq ,should Fanny Essler not be engaged in a tourne),Auber's Grand pas classique danced by a young but already amazing Nicholas Le Riche (and toile Platel),Le spectre de la rose,created by Fokine for Nijinsky and Karsavina,music by Auber,danced here by great Ruzimatov and Nina,along with The Talisman(Drigo/Petipa),danced by the still beautiful Terekhova and Posokhov and Satanella(Pugni/Petipa)danced by a virtuoso Pisarev and enchanting Dorofeeva are some of the great Pas de Deux displayed in these 2 DVD but there is plenty of dazzling dancing as in Giselle,or in Lake or in Bournonvilles's Flower Festival of Genzano!!!A must in a good ballet collection to watch over and over again.",1234569600,7,1024,5.40625
7993293,5,B00009RXLX,"This two volume set is a real treat for ballet lovers.  I myself am not at usual times terribly enthusiastic about Russian bravura dancing.  To my surprise and delight, I found here two real gems within these two gala programs.  Apart from all the bravura feats, which show the strong technical accomplishments of the dancers, there are two ballets, in their entire lengths, danced to perfection, one at the beginning of each volume.
These are 'Le Spectre de la Rose"" and 'Pas de Quatre'.  Any of these two numbers alone, (esp. the former) is worth the cost of the set.  In Spectre, both Ananiashvili & Ruzimatov show great depth in their interpretation of the roles.
It's interesting to note that the two galas were two years apart chronologically - 1991 & 1993, both filmed in Japan.  The second one is superior in photography, lighting & costume design.  One exception in the costume aspect, was that in 1993 Terekhova was still wearing the old big, floppy tutus, and Posokhov's outfit in Talisman was positively ugly.  But that can be overlooked without problem, in light of the brilliant dancing.
That the roster of stars in the 2nd vol. included the French etoiles Platel & Le Riche was a bonus!
The closing number of the 2nd vol. was unique.  All the stars of the event (14, I think) took part in the Don Q. number, as opposed to the usual PDD.  That made for a real climax for the gala experience for any ballet fan!",1079308800,42,1424,4.615079365079365
