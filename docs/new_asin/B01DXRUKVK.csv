As for packaging and shipping everything came in time and not scratches or broken bit.",1500336000,,357,5.490909090909091

8757221,4,B01DXRUKVK,"This small movie based on an actual incident is difficult to watch. The inhumanity of Aligarh Muslim University administration is so plain it is difficult to imagine that in this day and age they were not punished. So blatantly their homophobic conduct goes public and their lawyers try to defend it that it is pathetic. The gay professor (who does not like that label) portrayed by Manoj Bajpayee is a gentle soul, not hurting anyone. He continues to cal his partner his 'friend'. That is quaint description of a rickshaw -puller. Perhaps the class distinction in modern India are so entrenched that it is difficult for the university's woman lawyer to accept it! Manoj Bajpayee, a fine actor who is capable of dominate the screen underplays his role t a remarkable degree. He is subdued and trying to disappear in the scenery. The place he lives at is depressing. The city and campus is depressing. The proceedings of the court are depressing. The court itself is funny in a perverse way. The fact that Indian Supreme Court overturned the Allahabad High Court verdict an recriminalized homosexuality tells you how far India has to go before joining the developed world.",1469232000,2,1171,4.889447236180905
