1211757,5,B00000F7RU,"This is a great movie which is based on a very interesting concept.

The main character is a very angry and aggressive person.

So they tell him to start working with this mad scientist who uses regression hypnosis combined with some type of drug.

The doctor regresses him back to the time when he was a wild animal in the distant past on earth like thousands or even millions of years ago.

Does this sound like something that isn't possible ?

Perhaps it is true.

And once a person has been hypnotically regressed to that other time, that other experience, could the power of the mind cause such a physical transformation to occur ?

Yes I think it can.

Mythology is full of stories of people who were part human combined with part animal, part plant, part bird, part fish, etc..

That ""mystery of mysteries"", the sphinx in Egypt, is such a creature.  What does this mean ?

Besides that there's a lot of great acting in this movies with the teenagers.

There's a great scene at their Halloween party where the one guy starts singing and then dances with this other gal.

Somehow this reminds me of a simpler time in America.

They tie this in with the guy turning into the werewolf while he's still wearing his high school jacket, etc..

1211758,5,B00000F7RU,"Believe it or not, this film has perhaps the most terrifying werewolf ""kill""  ever recorded on film.

  The first victim, walking alone at night through the woods, is stalked and stalked and well, you can guess the rest. Sounds like a million other werewolf movie scenes- well, its' not. There is no blood, nor any gore,- just incredibly intense, realistic, and frightening movie-making. The palpable fear that most viewers experience viewing this particular scene is due to the fact that it ingeniously connects to the universal experience most of us have had, of walking home alone in the dark, and ""hearing something"" in front or behind us. The first victim is a guy, unusual for 1950s fare, - but like ""Jaws"", shot almost 20 years later, this first ""killing"" would create a feeling of dread the viewer would feel throughout the rest of the film.

There are so many great moments contained within this film for any horror movie fan to enjoy, that despite a rather annoying ""musical number"", (something all teenage films at the time seemed to contain), missing it would be a shame.

  The ending is a doozy. Its' all very well done- great acting, great transformation scenes, all told, its' a cleverly crafted piece of film-making indeed.

  From Michael Landon's moving performance as a troubled teenage boy, doomed, thanks to the madness of a trusted doctor, to the horrifying original werewolf make-up, you will not sleep through this film, believe me. It will both touch and frighten even the most tested of horror film fans. If you have not seen it, I'm surprised. Its' a classic and one of the best werewolf films ever made.

  It also set into motion the ""teenage monster film cycle"" of the 1950s. Incredibly, in less than a year from it's release, ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"" grossed more than ten times it's cost!

You'll see why. I dare you to watch it alone some moon-lit night. I DARE YOU!",1096070400,17,1902,4.7560975609756095
1211759,4,B00000F7RU,"I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF is one of the finest terrible movies ever made.  At the time of its release (1957), it was exactly right for the drive in circuit, where teenagers could see on the big screen the angst of teenage turmoil that was afflicting them.  Even today, for the newest generation of hardened gangsta teens, this film still elicits creepy undertows of fear and self-loathing normally found today in rap videos.
IWTW was a first for director Gene Fowler and Michael Landon.  Landon, who later shot to fame in BONANZA and LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, here shows the star power that even then made him stand out in a crowd of overacting teens. This film is no satire, nor is tongue in cheek.  And surprisingly neither is it drenched in gore or special effects that today passes for directorial talent.  It is instead, a hearkening back to a previous generation of filmmakers who believed that real terror must come slowly and the payoff of the terror scene should include a masterful blending of chilling music, decent acting, and creative camera work, all of which harmoniously lead up to the screen violence.  In IWTW, the screen violence is limited to only two scenes, but the screen spookiness stands out from the first reel to the last.
In most werewolf films, the victim must be first bitten by one, as Lon Chaney was.  Here, Landon is rebellious teenager, Tony, who is constantly fighting his peers, his authority figures, and anyone else in his path.  His screen agida brings to mind Brando in THE WILD ONE when Brando is asked, ""Why are you so angry?'  Brando's reply: ""What do you got?""  Tony is an uncycled Brando who is forced to attend counseling with a psychiatrist Dr. Brandon (Whit Bissell).  Tony becomes a werewolf, not by being bitten by one, but by a strange mixing of drugs and regressive hypnotherapy.  It is this very novel manner of Tony's de-evolution that adds to the film's eerieness.  His ability to shed his civilized self so easily brings in a subtext that all of the panting teens in the drive-in could relate to: that the brutishness of the werewolf is a lot closer to the skin than we would like to think.
The scene in which Tony stalks his first victim is a classic in how to stretch a tight budget to produce fear without spending a dime on special effects.  Tony's victim is walking through a park that was thoroughly familar by day, but hauntingly shadowed by night.  He first hears soft footfalls and calls out.  He continues walking, then running, then seeing his killer.  We in the audience do not, but the face of fear on the victim tells us all we need to know of the menace standing right in front of him.  Later in the school gym, is one of the most effectively underplayed mixtures of sexuality and anger I have ever seen in any film.  Tony is still Tony and has just left the principal's office and passes by the gym where he sees an attractive female practicing on the parallel bars. He stares at her with his obvious horniness morphing into lupine rage.  He approaches her and we first see him as she does, an upside down figure of horrific intent.
It is scenes like this, plus a literate script and competent acting that sets IWTW apart from others of its genre.  The bestiality that set Tony off as a murdering creature of the night must have resonated with its contemporary audience of teens that heard their parents continuously warn them of the dangers of smoking, hot rods, and rock and roll music.  Substitute rap for rock and roll, and it is clear enough why IWTW still scares today's teens who laugh at the never-ending slaughter in the Jason and Freddy movies.",1060041600,25,3628,4.600931677018633
1211760,4,B00000F7RU,"This campy B-grade teen-exploitation horror flick stars Michael Landon as a tortured teen whose overly-aggressive behavior can either be explained by lycanthropy (yeah!!) or hypnotism performed under the guise of psychotherapy (bo-o-r-ring!!)  The manipulation of a troubled youth by an unscrupulous adult authority figure is fairly subversive, although the ""scientific"" explanation doesn't quite explain all that hair popping out of Landon's scalp.  A classic midnight movie.",1039996800,3,476,6.196969696969697
1211761,5,B00000F7RU,"Unfairly dismissed by many as ""camp"" or ""50s nostalgia,"" I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF has a lot more going for it than its critics might want to admit.  Though admittedly produced as a low-budget teenage exploitation film of its day, the movie actually displays remarkable pschological insight and artistic sensitivity.  The fact that that is almost certainly an accident doesn't matter.  The producers may not have wanted to make a fairly realistic portrayal of a young man struggling to become a man, or paint an eternally relevant morality tale in fairy-tale colors, or even preserve in capsule the morals of an age both more innocent and more mature than our own--but they did.  Landon's performance is the definitive lycanthropic victim, and overall this is a better werewolf opus than either THE WOLF MAN or CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF, the two giants usually rated as the best howler movies ever.  Surprisingly insightful, well written, and restrained, I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF is a sci-fi/horror gem that will, like the curse of the wolf itself, live forever.  The scene where Landon struggles to keep from wolfing out on a shapely female gymnast is worth the price of the tape alone.",1020816000,6,1182,4.944444444444445
1211762,4,B00000F7RU,"This is the legendary cult classic that sounds worse than it really is.  A very young Michael Landon plays tormented teenager, Tony Rivers.  Little Joe, er, Tony displays violent rages at school.  At home, he does strange things as wolfing down raw hamburger.  After a fistfight at school, a police officer refers Tony to Dr. Brandon (the ever present Whit Bissell) for hypnotherapy.  Because of Tony's violent behavior, Brandon decides to use him as a subject in his research of human evolution.  Brandon puts Tony in touch with savage roots.  After drug injections and hypnosis, Pa Ingalls, er, Tony grows fangs and fur.  The '50s look of this movie makes it a beguiling antique.  Notice the clothes, the music, the dancing, and the refreshments at the kids' Halloween party.  In addition, the preaching and the posturing of the parents and the high school principal is strictly square.  One almost expects Ward and June to appear.  Despite its low-budget origins, this is an entertaining horror flick that avoids excessive camp humor.  It is a solid variation of the good vs. evil dilemma.  There isn't any of the full moon and silver bullet cliches.  This werewolf appears when anger rages in the dark realms of the soul.  Guy Williams has a small role as a cop...

A very young (and oh so handsome) Michael Landon does a better than average job of portraying a troubled teen, on his way to being a JD (juvenile delinquent) and who ends up getting ""help"" from a mad scientist/doctor who is only interested in using Landon as a research subject. Things go terribly wrong from that point but the results for the viewer are hilarious overall.

1211814,4,B00000F7RU,"This film is another classic that I haven't seen in awhile,but reviewing it again has not soiled it's reputation.
I Was A Teenage Werewolf(1957) has something of a campy title,but under that title is one of the most well made Monster movies of the 1950s.

A trend is started with this film,the first to properly focus on youth as protagonists in a Horror picture and rely on there problems and frustrations,which this film does better than alot of there contemporaries did.

Taking the legend of the Werewolf,this film changes the concept from legend to science and has the werewolf spring forth as the result of repressed anger and sexual frustration.
Michael Landon is a compelling lead who is alternately sympathetic and frightening as the angry Tony,who seeks psychiatric help from a ego-maniacal doctor in the form of Sci-Fi regular,Whit Bissel,who lets the teenager revert to his animal self through hypnosis!

There are many surprisingly tense moments within the film including a creepy walk through the forest as Tony acquires his first victim and one of the most subtle examples of brooding sexuality in the Horror film,that being the scene where Toby eyes the babe doing gymnastics in the gym and turns into a wolf(literally).
The film's power lies in the theme of adults trying to shape teenagers into what they want them to be,by control and abuse,without aiding a real hand to help and having to suffer the consequences.

The make-up for the werewolf is quite good,and the film despite being firmly set in the 1950s,still resonates with kids today,and still stands today as a great Horror film and one of the best Werewolf films ever made.

Led to follow-ups in the form of I was a Teenage Frankenstein(1958) and Blood of Dracula(1958),which could not begin to approach this original.

It's a real shame there is still no DVD release for this classic.",1234051200,8,1864,4.939297124600639

1211817,3,B00000F7RU,"Despite its apt but risible title, ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf,"" surprises in both the sincerity of its playing, as well as by its accomplished technical credentials. Campy confessional title notwithstanding, there is nothing about the screenplay that is deliberately parodic.

Effectively photographed by distinguished cinematographer Joseph La Shelle, and bolstered by an excellent musical score, the film thus provides a solid showcase for both its scenario and the performances of its young principals.

More importantly, (and this is what gives the picture a leg up on others of its ilk) the film is moodily under-lit, giving much of it a film noir ambiance. This is most evident in the hypnosis sequences, (the best in the film) which are staged and photographed in a way very reminiscent of Lewton's ""Cat People.""

Anyone doubting the value of the change purse aesthetics at work here need only consult the negligible results attained in such schlock as ""Blood of Dracula"" or the pre-Poe Corman films, which make ""Teenage Werewolf"" look like David Lean by comparison. Here the sincere effort of the technical crew shows: an unsettled, fatalistic brooding mood is generated, taking equal measure from the sense of doom hanging over the protagonist and expressed in shadows everywhere, even in mid-day living rooms and psychiatrist's offices.

Mr. Landon brings a sensitive intensity to the role that is wholly convincing, and he is ably abetted by all in support. Mr. Sokoloff is fine in his masculine reprise of the Maria Ouspenkaya role from Lon Chaney's ""The Wolfman,"" and a pre Zorro Guy Williams shows up effectively as a policeman.

While admittedly done on a modest budget, this limitation is actually an asset, inasmuch as it prevents the art direction from going over the top in its very effective depiction of proletariat domestic interiors, (Miss Lime's character even has Archie and Edith Bunker type parents.) Thus, the homes, teen club, principal's office etc. are ""right on the money.""

Even so, sharp eyed viewers will note that a leather sofa does double duty in both the police detective's and Miss Fergusan's office. Similarly, Dr. Brandon's and Miss Fergusan's respective office's are the same set, re-arranged, and re-dressed.

For his part, Mr. Landon, flush with his TV western success, and (equipped with accompanying footage), lampooned his role in the film in a 1969 guest appearance on the Jerry Lewis TV show.",1189555200,5,2441,5.180203045685279

1211819,2,B00000F7RU,"Michael Landon, who went on to bigger and better things, stars as Tony, a mixed up teenager who gets into fights and flies into angry rages for no reason. He gets sent to a doctor, played with arrogant assurance by Whit Bissel, for treatment. Bissel treats him with hypnotherapy and by injecting him with something the doctor whipped up in his spare time. The doctor believes he can revert someone back to their evolutionary beginnings. Why you would want to do this is beyond me, but it works. Tony becomes a werewolf and begins attacking his fellow high school students. Eventually, as the police are hunting him, Tony returns to the doctor for help. Instead of helping, he injects Tony yet again. Predictably, Tony becomes the werewolf, kills the doctor's assistant and the doctor and is then shot by the police.

The acting in this film is better than some other 1950s horror movies, but the writing is pretty dull. The whole plot is thin and has to be stretched to make a full length film. There is no real point to the doctor's experiments. There is no suspense or frights when Tony attacks. You know well beforehand who is going to get it.
