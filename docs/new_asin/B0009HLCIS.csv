8060778,1,B0009HLCIS,"The film might be great if it weren't for the fact that it's overdubbed. Had I known that A. it was dubbed in the first place and B. actually had overdubbing, which is even worse because you're hearing the original and the dubbing voice AT THE SAME TIME (and on top of that, the overdubbing is done in one voice for all the characters), I definitely would not have rented this film. It's a pity, because it's a classic, and I'm sure it would be great to watch, but in its original version with English subtitles. And if it's gonna be dubbed, then at least give me different voices without the original being played simultaneously. Seriously, I can't believe Amazon would allow this to be rented and without clarifying the audio details. There's no option to turn the dubbing off. Furious.",1509926400,,788,4.595744680851064
8060779,1,B0009HLCIS,"This film is impossible to watch due to the awful English voice-over that can't be turned off. We gave up rather quickly and turned it off due to the annoyance factor. If you really want to see this film, which is ok as an example of Soviet humor, look for MIMINO from other free sources that offer subtitles in English without the distracting voice-over. But you would have to understand Russian culture of that era in order to get much out of it.",1508371200,,448,4.409638554216867
8060780,3,B0009HLCIS,This movie is weirdly dubbed with a monotone English voice over the original (still audible) voicetrack. There seems to be no way to turn this off - it is quite unwatchable. Try to find a non-dubbed version.,1502496000,,207,4.621621621621622
8060781,2,B0009HLCIS,"Some of our English students (Russian speakers) love this movie....but as with most humor, much is lost in translation. If you know Russian, I guess this is really funny...because of the characters use of Russian is poor.",1389830400,2,221,5.0
8060782,5,B0009HLCIS,"The movie is classic. Beware that you cannot remove English subtitles if you want to. Other than that, it is perfect. Highly recommend.",1343520000,,135,4.913043478260869
8060783,5,B0009HLCIS,"""Mimino"" - a classic movie by Daneliya. With talented actors - Vakhtang Kikabidze, Frunzik Mkrtchyan, Evgeny Leonov... you can watch it and watch it, and it'll never get boring. I watched it probably 100 times in my life, but every time I watch - it's like new, you don't lose interest.

The story of the movie is about a georgian bush pilot Mimino (Vakhtang Kikabidze)who works at small local airlines, flying helicopters between small villages. But he dreams of piloting large international airlines aircraft, so he decides to go to Moscow to follow his dream. There in a hotel he meets Armenian truck driver Roobik Khachikyan (Frunzik Mkrtchyan) who is given a place in that hotel by mistake instead of another Khachikyan (Professor), and they have a lot of adventures in Moscow.

Mimino's real name in the film is Valentin Mizandari - his nickname 'Mimino' is the Georgian word for Sparrowhawk (russian ""sokol"").

I'd definitely recommend to watch this movie!!",1255392000,,964,5.0125
8060784,5,B0009HLCIS,"No this isn't necessarly a movie about Soviet propaganda, far from it!  It's about this Georgian pilot named Valiko Mizandari, AKA Mimino.  He dreams of being a pilot for Russia.  So he goes to Moscow and there he meets an Armanian and they become friends.  And then he gets himself into a lot of situations.  And in this movie they really stereotized Georgians and Armanians.

But it's a good film!  For lovers of Russian/Soviet films!",1196553600,,436,4.733333333333333
8060785,5,B0009HLCIS,"Friends call Valiko Mizandari ""Mimino"", which means ""falcon"" in Georgian. Working as a helicopter pilot in his own village Telavi, Mimino (Vachtang Kikabidze, famous Georgian singer and actor) delivers mail, fruit, sheep, and sometimes, cows. His greatest dream is to fly real, big aircraft. He leaves for Moscow to pursue his dream and to fly with the big international air company ""Aeroflot"". In Moscow, Mimino finds himself in many different situations, funny, sad, and even dramatic. Upon his arrival to Moscow, he stays first in the posh hotel that overlooks the Red Square where he checked in as a participant in the international Medical conference - thanks to the phone call of an influential relative of his relative. (Don't ask - this is one of the realities of life in the Soviet Union). In the hotel he meets an Armenian, Rubik Khachikyan, a truck driver, who becomes his friend (uniquely talented Frunzik Mktrchyan, one of the leading comedy actors in the Soviet Union who also put the real emotional deepness in every part he played). Rubik was given the room by mistake. When thrown out of hotel, and run out of money, two men would spend the night in Rubik's truck. Then Mimino accidentally bumps into a man who had offended his sister several years back...Georgia is the country where the words ""honor"", ""pride"", and ""decency"" mean a lot for a real man and as the result of the unexpected meeting, Mimino would spend several days in jail and go on trial for teaching a scoundrel a few lessons.... Finally, Mimino becomes a pilot of a supersonic jet liner and flies all over the world but wherever he goes, he feels homesick, and Georgia is always on his mind - its skies, its mountains and its valleys and the faces of his family and friends...

Made twenty-nine years ago, this dramedy has been one of the most beloved among the viewers of all republics and many nationalities of the former USSR. It has achieved a cult status, and its one-liners and quotes have become the elements of every day conversations. Its creators are very talented artists - the writer/director Georgi Danelia, (""Walking the Streets of Moscow"", ""Don't Grieve"", ""Autumn Marathon""), and his co/writer, my favorite Russian prosaic, Victoria Tokareva (Fellini said about her, ""What a kind and wild imagination she has"" and he seriously considered making a movie with her - unfortunately, it did not happen) had created a kind, warm, lyrical but in the same time funny, insightful, at times, sad story with the heroes real, earthy, decent, and very human. Both, Kikabidze and especially Mktrchyan gave their best performances in this timeless (and I am not afraid of this definition) masterpiece. Comes with the highest recommendation.",1165881600,5,2725,4.949781659388647
8060786,5,B0009HLCIS,"If you ever thought that Soviet movies were all about communist propaganda, this is a movie you MUST watch.

Mimino is the great story of a Georgian helicopter pilot who dreams about moving to Moscow to become an airliner pilot, and about his adventures in the big city. Unforgettable the scene in which Mimino tries to call his friends in Georgia and by mistake is connected to a Georgian immigrant to Israel, who, like Mimino, is just homesick for his homeland.

All the actors deliver superb performances, which results in a great movie filled with humour and nostalgia.

If you like old Russian movies, you'll love this one. If you don't, you will after watching this.",1132963200,,672,4.775862068965517
