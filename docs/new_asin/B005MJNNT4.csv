Maybe if I wanted to get high and kill myself, it'd be my thing. But I hated it. Absolutely hated it.",1349913600,,170,3.75
4834759,5,B005MJNNT4,Archie's Final project was all that I had expected and more. It was a great film that captures the average teenagers thoughts and emotions. A very emotional film that shows that you are not alone when it comes to depression and suicide.,1346630400,,236,4.642857142857143
4834760,3,B005MJNNT4,"I can not say I would recommend this film, I can honestly say I regret buying, even watching it. I will most likely never watch it again, Someone discribed this as a Comedy....I have no idea what they were thinking. If they think Suicide is funny then they might have some deep issues going on. The movie is about just what the title suggests a sucidal teen, hell bent, and obsessed with death. I do not recommend this to anyone espically younger veiwers. Althouh it does give Parents some ideas on what they need to be talking to their kids about. When they need to get help for a Child.",1346284800,,588,4.3545454545454545
4834761,2,B005MJNNT4,CAUTION:This is NC-17 Equivalent. Uses the F-word continuously and has hard core porn in it. And all this was in the first 7 minutes - I stopped watching after that long.,1338163200,,170,4.516129032258065
4834762,1,B005MJNNT4,"Had hoped to use this with students to stimulate discussion about suicide. However, the language used in the film makes it impossible to use in a school setting. It is too bad that the suicide prevention group didn't consider a teen audience and how necessary a resource like this could be.",1326240000,,290,4.705882352941177
4834763,5,B005MJNNT4,Archies final project was an amazing story. I would totaly recomend it to others. The plot was based on many teen's feelings or view of life.,1325462400,,141,4.461538461538462
4834764,5,B005MJNNT4,"The long wait is over! Since I saw the film at the Berlinale 2009 (then under the title MY SUICIDE, where it deservedly won the Amber Bear for Best Youth Film), it has stayed on my mind. Seldomly have the troubles of teenagers been portrayed this poignantly, wittily, raw, and innovatively. Visually, the film is a thunderstorm of different styles - from classic movie staging to 21st century low-fi video montages, and even rotoscoped animation. Emotionally this film will shake you with laughter, punch you in the stomach with unfiltered rage and sadness, tickle your geekness with countless popcultural references (e.g. a wonderful take on Christopher Walken's Russian roulette scene from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deer-Hunter/dp/0783225997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deer Hunter</a>), and soothe your soul with a crooked yet heartfelt love story. And for the movie buffs: if all the above didn't convince you to watch this film, do it alone for the final performance of the late David Carradine as a zoned out beat poet guru.
Actor/co-author/co-editor/co-everything Gabriel Sunday truly gives all in this film - an impressive performance playing on so many levels. However, this is not the work of teens and twens alone, but of a very thoughtful grown-up director, David Lee Miller. In a true real independent way he manages to tell a truthful yet highly entertaining youth yarn that keeps resonating in the hearts and minds of the audience.
In a nutshell: ARCHIE'S FINAL PROJECT is a high-strung&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Fidelity/dp/1573225517/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Fidelity</a>&nbsp;for the teenage purgatory that is highschool.",1323216000,,1756,6.084677419354839
4834765,5,B005MJNNT4,"Hi, I had the pleasure of seeing Archie's Final Project a few years back at a film festival when it was titled ""My Suicide"".  The first thing I thought while walking out of the theater was wow, that is nothing I have ever seen before.  You will be amazed at the details, design, fast editing that this film has thoroughly examined.  For the film, it deals with a heavy subject, teenage suicide.  Now out of all the films I have seen, ""The Virgin Suicides"", ""Thirteen"" (that was a pretty good one), for this generation Archie's Final Projects hits directly home.  Every thing said, done, is exactly what teenagers are going through, without being too overly dramatic or lacking of.  There are even hits of comedy which makes moments of laughter, but overall the seriousness of the film and the message is real, you are submerged with the characters and the emotions that you can't help but feel.  Archie is a kid that genuinely yearns for connection, the feeling of being in touch with others.  He is a media geek, but who isn't nowadays in this 21st century?  With all this technology, I can see why someone would break.  With that being said, please do yourself a favor, and watch this film.  At least once, and educate your children..  Teachers, parents, mental health professionals this is a must.

Directed by:  David Lee Miller

Starring:  Gabriel Sunday, Brooke Nevin, Mariel Hemingway, David Carradine, Joe Mantegna, Nora Dunn, and Michael Welch.",1321747200,5,1453,4.798387096774194
4834766,5,B005MJNNT4,"I saw 'Archie's Final Project,' under the title 'My Suicide,' at the Florida Film Festival a couple years ago. The movie has stuck with me ever since. Though the description might turn people away, I urge everyone to see it, especially if you are an adolescent or young teenager feeling overwhelmed by the pressures of growing up.

The movie is a dark comedy about a boy who, for his final project at school, is going to kill himself on camera. Before you say, ""how distasteful,"" and move on to another film, I think you should know that the film was made with the close partnership of a suicide prevention group, and has an underlying message of understanding, compassion, and support for pre-teens and teens struggling with keeping a happy face.

The movie has also spurred a online community of ""Archies,"" likeminded people who have dealt with suicide and depression in varying degrees.

My favourite thing about 'Archie's Final Project' is how quickly, and seamlessly, it can shift from tear-jerking, to funny, to serious within minutes. Full of pop-culture references a heart-felt emotion, paired with top-notch acting (not to mention amazing editing), 'Archie's Final Project' is not to be missed.",1317513600,17,1203,5.035175879396985

ARCHIE'S FINAL PROJECT is a truly one-of-a-kind film, one that deserves much wider attention but is bound to retain its cult status--There's just no other place for it. Low budget but not cheap, darkly funny but not cynical, it includes a impressive cast roster: Mariel Hemingway, Joe Mantegna, with an especially fine performance by David Carradine as Charles Bukowski-ish street poet ""Vargas.""

AFP gives one of the more convincing portraits of high school that I've seen on film, particularly in how it confronts the special info-overload nihilism that so many of today's youth face. The relationship of Archie (Gabriel Sunday) and Sierra Silver (Brooke Nevin) defies all stereotypes and is very real. Zachary Ray Sherman is also memorable as Archie's taken-for-granted pal, Corey. Though this film is all about a depressed high school misfit who plans to film his own suicide for a Social Media class project, there are all sorts of other big themes here--the meaning and value of human relations, love, life-in-general, you name it--that are addressed without degenerating into clichs. Without becoming gaudy, AFP also does an impressive job of meshing animated fantasy sequences with its reality. The middle portions become a little tiresome and repetitive in places, but this film meanders its way to a powerful ending that, like the entire point it makes about life, is worth sticking around for.

I've noticed a lot of complaints about how gritty and nasty AFP is. There's a lot of profanity, non-gratuitous, realistic violence, and some brief and unrevealing sex between 17-year-olds. Yet, while the film's subject matter is conveyed with such brutal honesty that it's shocking in places, there's nothing truly tasteless here.",1401408000,4,1750,5.287769784172662

4834776,3,B005MJNNT4,"There are so many 5 Star attributes to this movie... I wholeheartedly support micro-budget filmmakers, but to realize David Carradine and Mariel Hemingway are members of the cast (even if they worked for free) then there were some SAG rules involved in making this movie and that causes the production to look opportunistic: Low cost ""no-name talent"" plus star-power cameos equals a ""laughing all the way to the bank"" production that I felt uneasy about recommending.

Knowing David Carradine had an asphyxiation accident in 2009 didn't help me sit through this movie about suicide either.",1391472000,,589,5.2

8479413,4,B005MJNNT4,"I'm so happy I finally found and purchased Archie's Final Project. My rating is in big part to the nostalgia and how important of a film this was to me. Once upon a time I was lead to believe that all indie movies were Sony handicam abominations with terrible audio, but Archie's Final project was the first one I ever saw and realized how the phrase ""indie"" has nothing to do with quality. I really have dove in the deep end over the last few years and I have this film to thank for the many others I've discovered. At the time this video was probably a legitimate 4/5 but it has aged a little and some of the techy stuff is already gathering dust (every 16 year old kid has a green screen and better recording equipment than Archie just a few short years later)

So realistically it's probably a 3-3.5/5  nowadays but boy do I cherish owning a physical copy.",1481068800,,860,4.302469135802469

Since almost all of us know at least one person that has committed suicide, this movie helps heal old wounds. I'm sure it has also stopped some people from committing the act.
