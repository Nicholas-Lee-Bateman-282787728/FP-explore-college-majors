8126785,2,B000FUF79Y,"Complete mess of a film opens up with a pretty good if over the top scene where a crime boss is killed by a rival in front of his two young daughters.  The villain actually laughs maniacally while this is going on--it's that kind of a movie.  The camera focuses in on the face of one of the daughters then jumps forward 20 years or so and we see the girl from the opening scene grown up and getting into a fight with men who follow the crime boss that killed her father.  Given the movie's title and the nature of the opening scene, you might logically think that she grew up vowing revenge for what happened to her dad--but no, she's actually looking for her sister who she for some reason suspects has been sold into prostitution.

If this simply stuck to being an action film it probably would have been entertaining enough but like a lot of lower quality Hong Kong B-movies, this thing is all over the place tonally.  In addition to the occasional energetic action scenes, there is also unfunny broad comedy and multiple rape scenes depicting women being forced into prostitution.  The martial arts style action, violent sex, nudity and broad comedy never even come close to meshing in a way western viewers would be accustomed to, although if you've seen enough Hong Kong films you likely know that this kind of mish mash of seemingly incompatible elements isn't nearly as uncommon there.

Angel of Vengeance doesn't even have a functional storyline, it's just an excuse for 90 minutes of barely connected sex, violence and comedy.  The characters are flimsy at best, what's going on in the film frequently seems to make little to no sense and it's all such an incoherent, sloppy mess that it's pretty much impossible to find any of this particularly exciting or to care at all about what's going on.  Angel of Vengeance could easily be composed entirely of unused outtakes from a handful of different Hong Kong films--that's how much care and thought went into making it.",1500940800,,1977,4.658045977011494

8126787,2,B000FUF79Y,"Try and find a movie that comes packaged with its own T-shirt - you won't find too many. Try finding one that's actually good and you'll find even fewer, because ""Angel of Vengeance"" is definitely not a good movie. Marketing avenues aside, what you have here is a resoundingly average low-budget Hong Kong film that's only notable for starring karate queen Yukari Oshima and indulging in some segments of remarkably poor taste to get its point across.

The story: a young female student writing a thesis on love and passion attempts to sneak into the underworld of sex trafficking with the aid of her aspiring boyfriend, unaware that her mother's brothel houses the kidnapped sister of a freelance assassin (Oshima,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riki-Oh-The-Story-of-Ricky/dp/B00004TJM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riki-Oh - The Story of Ricky</a>) who will stop at nothing to rescue her...

The former aspect of the story is an exercise in ridiculousness: this student, Betty (I have no idea who plays her) is so hung up on writing this thesis that she dresses up as a man to sneak into the brothel repeatedly, even after inevitably getting caught a couple times and escaping near-rape the same amount. It's a completely absurd thing to see played out and the filmmakers dress it up as comedy, which would've been fine were it not for the film's starkly contrasting agenda of pointing out the harsh realities of human trafficking in scenes immediately following these segments of sexual humor. It's almost admirable how the movie pulls no punches when it comes to detailing the entire breaking-in process of white slavery...but then it loses credibility entirely by indulging in its rape scenes. There are three of these, and while needing to watch one of these in its entirety may have been forgivable on grounds of realism (like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Accused/dp/B00005Y1UT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Accused</a>), the movie makes you sit through no less than three, each lasting about five minutes and barring only the male genitals from view. ""Unnecessary"" doesn't begin to cover it, and unless you're already a frequenter of the softcore rape market, I can't imagine why anybody would want to watch this while knowing that stuff like this is happening throughout the real world.

Yukari Oshima is the lone bright spot on this pile of junk...at least when the fight scenes kick in. There are about six of these, and while they're not the most creative brawls you've ever seen (save for the one involving a blind female enforcer who fights with a cane), they're serviceable in demonstrating why Oshima is a former karate champion, showcase a couple cool moves, and feature the underrated Alex Fong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Nite-in-Mongkok/dp/B000DN5VGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Nite in Mongkok</a>)...but they're only momentary distractions from the painfully bad comedy spots and gaping pitfalls of logic. Production on this film was obviously cheap, but production of the DVD was even cheaper: there are plenty of other characters populating this story, but I can't even find the names of the actors who play them due to the lack of proper credits. The audio/video quality is questionable at best. Personally, I felt that the ending was incredibly unfulfilling...and I could go on and on with a hundred other nitpicks about this movie, but I think you've gotten the picture by now. The only audience I see for this movie are Oshima completists, who should snatch up any film of hers that makes it to DVD, but I can't imagine even them finding much replay value in it.",1270425600,,3736,5.471403812824956
