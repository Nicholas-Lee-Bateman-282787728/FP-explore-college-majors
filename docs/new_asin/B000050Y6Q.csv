7929257,5,B000050Y6Q,"This is the story of Air Florida flight 90, a Boeing 737 that crashed in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. on January 13, 1982, immediately after takeoff in a severe snowstorm from Washington National Airport in Arlington County, Virginia. The crash occurred less than two miles from the White House.

There were 79 souls on board. The accident killed 78 people, including four motorists on the 14th Street Bridge. There were only 5 survivors. Though a sixth passenger had survived the crash, he died rescuing his fellow passengers by repeatedly giving the helicopter's rescue line to other survivors. This is shown in this documentary, having been filmed by media crew around the crash site. One must applaud such heroism, and realize the goodness that resides in all of us. Moments like this make me wonder why we ever go to war against each other.

Flight 90 was de-iced by ground equipment, but the aircraft had trouble leaving the gate when the tow car could not get traction on the ice. The crew attempted to back away from the gate using the reverse thrusts, but this proved futile and resulted in the engines ingesting ice and snow. Eventually a tow car equipped with snow chains was used to push the aircraft back from the gate. After finally leaving the departure gate the aircraft waited on a taxiway for 49 minutes in line with other aircraft for its turn for takeoff. The pilot decided not to return to the gate for more de-icing, fearing the flight's departure would be further delayed.

While taxiing the captain made a major mistake. He decided to taxi close behind a DC-9 that was just ahead of them, believing that the warmth from the DC-9's engines would melt the snow and ice accumulated on the wings. However, this action contributed to additional icing on the 737.

With snow and ice on the wings and in the engines, and the pilots fully aware of this, the aircraft attempted to take off. Amazingly, the crew did not switch on the onboard engine anti-ice system. Analysis of the cockpit voice recorder determined that during the departure checklist, the copilot announced, and the pilot confirmed, that the plane's anti-icing system was turned off (this segment is heard in this documentary, and it is quite chilling for such a mistake to have been made). This system uses heat from the engines to prevent engine sensors from freezing and providing inaccurate readings. The failure to operate the engine anti-ice system caused the engine pressure ratio (EPR) thrust indicators to provide false high readings. When the pilots thought they had throttled up to the correct take-off EPR of 2.04, the actual EPR was only 1.70. The aircraft was therefore underpowered during the takeoff roll. The first officer noted several times to the captain that the readings he was seeing on the instrument panel did not seem correct. He was referring to the fact that the plane did not seem to have developed as much power as it needed for takeoff.  The captain dismissed the first officer's concerns and let the takeoff proceed. Although the aircraft did manage to become airborne, it attained a maximum altitude of just 352 feet before it began losing altitude. The aircraft was airborne for just 30 seconds. The aircraft crashed 0.75 nautical miles (1400 m) from the end of the runway.

Many Federal Government offices in downtown Washington had closed early in response to quickly developing blizzard conditions. Thus, there was a massive backup of traffic on almost all of the city's roads, making it almost impossible for ambulances and rescue vehicles to reach the crash site. The traffic jams are clearly seen in this documentary.

Rescuers who reached the site were unable to assist survivors in the water because they did not have adequate equipment to reach them. Below-freezing waters made swimming out to them impossible. You see them in this documentary just starring at the survivors floating in the freezing water, unable to assist.

Multiple attempts to throw a makeshift lifeline (made out of belts and any other things available that could be tied together) out to the survivors proved ineffective. One person who had enough of the inaction at rescuing the survivors heroically jumped into the water and tried to reach the survivors. Though he remained 20 minutes in the water swimming towards them, he was unable to reach them. The makeshift lifeline was not long enough. His bravery, though, gave hope to the survivors. Unfortunately, he was later not commended enough for his efforts and did not reach the fame of the other rescuers. But viewers of this documentary will certainly applaud his heroism. Seeing one man swim in freezing waters to the rescue of the survivors while hundreds of others, including professional rescuers onshore, remain spectators, will give you a chill down your spine. I said it before but I'll say it again: there's lots of goodness inside us. But how many of us know it? And how many of us make the effort of bringing it forth?

Sometime later, a United States Park Police Bell 206L-1 Long Ranger helicopter arrived and began attempting to pull the survivors to shore. This was the greatest scene in this documentary. At great risk to themselves, the crew worked close to the river surface, at one time coming so close to the ice-clogged river that the helicopter's skids went beneath the surface of the water. Watching this rescue attempt on tape was exhilarating. This was skillful flying at its best!

The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the cause of the accident was pilot error. Three errors were attributed to the accident. The correction of only one of these errors could have saved flight 90. The pilots failed to switch on the engines' anti-ice equipment; visually identified ice and snow on the wings but did nothing about it; and failed to abort the takeoff after detecting a power problem.

This is a very touching documentary and I highly recommend it for all aviation enthusiasts. In a way, it is also an uplifting documentary at seeing the heroism in ordinary people like us!",1203724800,,6073,4.909356725146199
