8401130,5,B003NHOJGS,"STOP-MOTION MARVELS is a treasure-filled delight of rare, seldom-seen handcrafted shorts.  As an animator, I appreciate watching the creative solutions pioneers devised to overcome production problems - for instance, replacement/series faces years before George Pal made the technique ""his"" with his marvelous Puppetoons.  It is a treat to see these lost films from many sources and I give the producers a Big Tip of the Hat for their stellar efforts to make these wonderful shorts accessible.  I was especially pleased they persuaded Jim Danforth, one of the greatest practitioners of the art, to contribute insightful commentary.  Order your copy now!",1359676800,4,653,5.5
8401131,5,B003NHOJGS,"With the exception of perhaps a few of these (mostly the early experiments), you won't find any of this animation anywhere. It's a great collection for any film history buff, particularly those who are keen on animation. The Kinex collection itself is worth it, but I think all of the material is great, even the commercials. There's a lot of fun and creativity in these early shorts and after nearly a century , they still make people smile and feel warm inside.

I really hope they are able to make a second volume in the future. I love obscure animation, particularly from other countries. Considering how old and fragile this era of film stock is, the few shorts that are still out there must be preserved while they still can be. Do it for the children! (And the geeks!)",1339113600,5,775,4.575539568345324
8401132,5,B003NHOJGS,"I agree with the previous two reviews. Thunderbean has done another wonderful job compiling a terrific collection of rare and unavailable
animated films. If you are into the history of animation, or just love animation you shouldn't pass up this amazing assortment of stop-motion gems.",1338768000,4,285,5.355555555555555
8401133,5,B003NHOJGS,"If you are even thinking of buying this DVD, just do it, it's amazing. You will not be sorry. Stuff you will not see anywhere else... What are you waiting for? Christmas?",1312156800,4,170,4.34375
8401134,5,B003NHOJGS,"This high-quality Thunderbean release is interesting historically, and also a lot of fun. There are extensive notes in the 12 page booklet included, and most importantly these films are a treat to watch. In addition to the highlighted Kinex films are some stop-motion commercials, as well as a Georg Pal Puppetoon (The Sky Princess) with an optional commentary by Bob Baker, an animator who worked on that film. Especially if you are interested in the history of animation, you shouldn't hesitate to get this wonderful collection!

I continue to be amazed by the care and quality that goes into all the Thundrbean productions.",1294790400,7,626,5.077669902912621
