8519345,3,B007LA1WXG,This was pretty wild. I guess that sequels do not exist. I cannot resolve events in the book with LDS church doctrine as I understand it.,1500336000,,137,4.3076923076923075
8519346,5,B007LA1WXG,Interesting story line and format.,1471046400,,34,6.0
8519347,1,B007LA1WXG,"I can't believe I actually paid to watch this!  It had the worst acting, terrible dialogue, no suspense, and half the time I was wondering what the characters thought they were doing.  The main character barely says anything.  This series is played up because of the Mormon aspect, which is not a weakness, but everything else about it was painful.  Nothing was resolved and at the end, you still have no idea what the ""mysterious object"" is, who is chasing after it, or why it needs protecting. Oh, then to cap it off, you're left with a big, fat, ""to be continued""!  Don't waste your time.",1357948800,,591,4.537735849056604
8519348,5,B007LA1WXG,"Finally! A series that is engaging, interesting, and suspenseful that I can watch with my kids! My 14, 12. , and 7 year old boys loved it. Not only did it keep their attention, but they act it out like Indiana Jones or star wars. It's so hard to find something that all my boys at different ages can watch and enjoy.  I really hope they make another season!!!",1342051200,2,359,4.202898550724638
8519349,5,B007LA1WXG,This series was well written and kept me coming back for more.  The first episode was difficult to watch with the erratic movements constantly.  But it was only a small part of the show.  I've been waiting for a new episode forever!  I got my friends addicted to this too.  It needs to be continued!!!!!!,1341878400,2,304,4.454545454545454
8519350,4,B007LA1WXG,"""The Book of Jer3miah"" is nothing if not unique. It's a web series made by a group of college students with a very successful transmedia component. It's a conspiracy thriller where advanced technology and promptings from the Holy Spirit both work to advance the story. The show is not without comic relief, but it takes some of the strange aspects of Mormon doctrine, history, and folklore that ground the story refreshingly, sincerely seriously--it's a rare thing in Mormon fiction, a story that would lose all of its power if transposed into any other religious tradition. It goes to scary, troubling places, asking hard questions about religion and morality, and it tells a fast-paced, twisty story.

The show isn't perfect--it takes a couple episodes to get going and there are certainly many traces of the unbelievably low budget. But, in many ways, these aspects don't really feel like drawbacks--there is a handmade quality to the series that is not only charming, it's inspiring. There's something invigorating about seeing such an ambitious project tackled with such limited resources--there's an energy that runs through ""The Book of Jer3miah"" that elevates it above
most of its bigger-budgeted competition both in the web series world and the world of Mormon film. It's an excellent, exciting, occasionally unsettling and frequently unusual piece of work. I just hope there's a second season on the way.",1341878400,3,1414,5.201754385964913
8519351,5,B007LA1WXG,"This series is very well done.  The story quality is great and on par with thrillers along the lines of Orson Scott Card and the TV shows (as has been said above) Lost and 24.  I recommend this as a clean, entertaining option to watch.",1341878400,2,235,4.2
8519352,5,B007LA1WXG,"This is a conspiracy thriller along the lines of Lost and 24. With one very unique factor. The main character is a Mormon. Freshman college student Jeremiah Whitney has a gift. And a box. He finds himself caught in a global conspiracy as evil forces try to recapture the box and kill the people connected to it. Each episode is 8-10 minutes long. There are a total of 20 episodes which you can watch one at a time. But you won't want to stop. You can watch the whole thing all at once like a movie in about two hours.  There's an awesome twist at the end. It has strong appeal for teens and young adults, and includes an online ARG (alternate reality game), for those interested in helping solve the mystery. This would be a great way for your kids to spend their down-time this summer. It's thematically rich, yet none of it feels preachy or heavy-handed. Just good, solid suspense in a gripping story where spiritual factors make the risks and the conflicts all the more exciting.

This series has rave reviews from the New York Times and won a prestigious Webby award. I'm so excited it's finally available on DVD. The bonus features are outstanding. Well worth the investment.",1338595200,5,1180,4.561320754716981
8519353,5,B007LA1WXG,"I'm a fan of the webseries and when I heard it was coming to DVD I was way excited. And I wasn't disappointed.

The encoding quality is great and the picture looks about as clear as a DVD can look. The sound is clean too.  The DVD is loaded with bonus features, including behind the scenes interviews, making of, a look at the trans-media storyline, and a few other things. Everything a fan could hope for.

Highly recommend if you're a fan of the show.",1332979200,5,453,4.305882352941176
