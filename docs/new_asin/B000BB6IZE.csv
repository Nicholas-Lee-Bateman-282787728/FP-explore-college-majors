8084415,5,B000BB6IZE,"Heavy Metal Me - by boris - Six tracks, (seven if you consider the English and the Japanese versions of the short film ""Heavy Metal Me"" separately) from boris (lower case, meaning it's their arty incarnation). Opening track ia ""a bao a qu - long version"" which is nearly 10 minutes long. It's a lot nicer than the one on ""Mabuta no Ura"", and it shows long shots of the three members of Boris wandering around a small town that may be in Holland, may be the UK. ""The Evil One Which Sobs"" is next, that is 16 minutes of abstract video, shorter than the 21 minute version that is on Dronevil. I can't even tell what it is picturing, but it might be dissolving fibres in a gigantic water tank... or something... Hard to tell what it really is, but it's hypnotic. ""Heavy Metal Me"" is 11 minutes of blurry black and white footage of Wata hanging around, the sound is staticky, video grainy like filmed with an old Super 8 film camera (maybe it was). Nonsense phrases appear from time to time like ""I think of `me' and `my world', Water reflect the sky, for the sake of the sky. The sky is there to be reflected on the water. How-too-entertain doesn't entertain me."" Arty and surreal. The very odd thing that I discovered is that if you click on ""Heavy Metal Me"" again after you've seen it, you'll see another version of it, and again, and again, and again. They somehow take the same scenes and reshuffle them, and you'll get different things every time. I've only sat through three of them, but I did hear a snatch of guitar playing once on one of the versions. It's boring to watch, but every scene is very beautiful in its own lost way, sometimes sinister in the sense of Sadako's video in ""Ringu."" Most of the scenes star Wata. ""Feedbacker"" is a 27 minute live video (this one's short - other versions that I have are 35 minutes long and 44 minutes long - it's basically a full boris album), it starts off black for the first two minutes of feedback before the curtains part, and there are Boris in all their spooky glory. The camera is quite jerky, but there are nice close-ups of Wata doing her thing, as well as those glorious Orange stacks. Great long shots of her soloing like David Gilmour. Amazing - where does she get her mojo? Stunning. Hypnotic. Atsuo comes in with singing at the halfway mark, the song starts to ramp up, and then builds into a feedback freakout with drummer Atsuo attacking the monster gong that hangs behind his drum kit. Bassist Takeshi holds the same note on his bass for nearly five minutes, putting it through the effects wringer. Then the song finally fades out. The final song is ""Flood,"" from the band's second release, and the 23 minute live set features 8 minutes of slow intro before busting out into full stoner drone freakout. The song is almost melodic, and a wee bit boring initially, but as the freakout continues the band truly shakes and rattles and rolls, and Atsuo lets loose on that big old gong several times, Takeshi thrashes his bass, and Wata wrings the life out of her Les Paul. Much of the video is taken from backstage so you see the members' backs, but you also see the 20-something Japanese slackers, all guys, in the front row blank-faced about the band they paid to see. The end of the set drowns out - the drummer leaves the stage four minutes before the end, and the bassist leaves two minutes before the end. Wata gives it a few more minutes of feedback, then some acoustic, and it's all over.",1216512000,2,3455,4.44251968503937
