Frankly it's a must see. More, it's a must show your family friends and anyone who will sit still long enough and I promise you, if they sit for the first 10 minutes they will stay for the rest.
The sources are unimpeachable and they speak from academic expertise or personal experience such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali who is featured prominently in this movie as well as many other Muslims and those of Muslim origins.
Get this film the moment you are able and get ready for a disurbing and eye opening experience.",1226102400,58,661,4.426229508196721
3611127,5,B001GH90J8,"As the years pass and 9-11 becomes more of a shaded memory for some and book history for our next generation we move closer toward forgetting the significance of that date and how it profoundly changed all of us forever. In this world of instantaneous information, only a click away from just about anything , the lingering problem with radical Islam continues to hang on, even though most of us would just hope it goes away.

The enemy is bound and determined to end Western civilization any way he can.

That is the focus of the documentary The Third Jihad the second DVD by the Shore/Kopping team on extremist Islam and the danger it poses to all of us. The first was Obsession: Radical Islams war against the west.

The Third Jihad covers a different aspect of Islams attempts at taking us over. Whereas Obsession concentrated on the violence against Western Civilization with America being central to that attack, this film concentrates almost entirely on the strategy to turn America into an Islamic country bound by Sharia law, without violence. This film takes a look at the more sinister underlying and acceptable part of Islam that wants to conquer through the peaceful transition from democracy to Sharia law.

What is so diabolical is that these Muslims are not al Queda, Hizbollah or Islamic Jihad. They are homegrown, work within the system, using democratic principles to spread their ideology.

This is the non-violent component of The Third Jihad, the constant pressure upon Western governments to accommodate Muslims along with the active proselytizing of Christians and Jews in Western countries, the end result is to establish a worldwide caliphate. That is a world which is totally Islamic and run by Sharia law, with all the oppression that system applies to women, gays, Jews, Christians, and the life threatening aspects to all those who do not bend to the Islamic will.

The film begins by introducing Zhudi Jasser an American Medical doctor, immigrated from the Muslim world and acts as the narrator of the film. Dr. Jasser like so many other honorable Muslim people tries to convince the more impressionable coming out of the Madrassas and the universities that the west is not their enemy and it is wrong to distort certain sections of the Koran and kill in Mohammads name.

There are handful of brave Muslim people speaking out against the insanity and trying to warn a lethargic west  that the Jihadi threat is real. Noni Darwish, Walid Phares, Sari Nusseibeh, Walid Shoebat, along with Jasser , act like the prophets of the old testament, warning us about something,  but are we listening?

One of the trademarks of the Shore/Kopping enterprise is the commentators that appear in their films. Experts in their fields, they make a strong case for the films thesis. One of those is Bernard Lewis, Professor Emeritus from Princeton University. Dr. Lewis is one of the foremost authorities on Islamic history in the west. He is also one of the few Islamic historians in western universities that does not apologize for Islamic transgressions against democratic institutions. Dr. Lewis gives a different but very cogent academic view of this part of world history. He calls the problem a cosmic struggle between two religiously defined civilizations, Christianity and Islam.

He explains the rapid spread of Islam during the 7th and 8th centuries when the Arabs came out of Arabia and moved into the Fertile Crescent, the spread east through Iraq and into modern day Iran, central Asia and India, west through Syria, Palestine, into Egypt and across North Africa, and then into Europe where they conquered Spain and Portugal and ruled Italy for quite awhile. Dr. Lewis analysis for this rapid spread of the religion, it was obviously not done by peaceful persuasion. That was the first Jihad.

The second Jihad was the rise of the Ottomans when Islam spread to the outskirts of Vienna before they were turned back. And, again you are left thinking that without a war stance put up by the Europeans, Islam would not have been stopped at Vienna in 1683.

Zhudi Jasser then comes on the screen and tells the audience that we in our time are living through  the Third Jihad, because we are in the third and final phase of their mission to bring about the domination of their version of Islam. All the while little red crescents are being super imposed on a map of first Asia and Africa and then a larger section with Constantinople at the center and finally when talking about the Third Jihad the whole world is covered with them.

Its a chilling reminder that Islam was born to conquer and continues to do that in the 21st century.

One of primary tactics of American Muslim organizations is deception. These organizations and the people that run them use our democracy to further their aims. Meanwhile, people in America and in the west are not noticing what is going on in their democratic systems.

One of the deceivers showcased in this film Abdul Rahman Alamoudi. For those old enough to remember the prayer service that President Bush held about a week after 9-11 and he had some interfaith leaders behind him on the dais. The Muslim representative was Alamoudi. He spoke in honor of the victims of the attack all the while probably feeling victorious inside that America was paying for its crimes against Islam.

He was implicated in the assassination attempt of the Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah , has openly campaigned for some of the worst terror organizations in the world, at the same time snuggling up to heavy weight politicians in Washington in both parties,  serving President Clinton as Islamic adviser and worked with Grover Norquist and had a close relationship with President Bush.

Alamoudi does not advocate violence against Americans although against Jews and others he calls enemies in the Middle East are a different story. He has openly campaigned in public for Hamas and Hezbollah and the killing of Jews in Israel.

Alamoudi was  convicted on a number of charges in 2004, relating to the crimes listed above and is now in jail. Alamoudi got caught. Here are the questions we should be asking and demanding answers to. How many more Alamoudis are out there, scheming, working under the radar, constantly undermining the democracy of the United States, feeding Americas enemies, and spreading The Third Jihad? What is so wrong with our immigration system that allows an enemy like Alamoudi to enter this country in the first place?

Allowing these figures to operate freely in America is slowly turning our country from a bastion of freedom to an oppressed Muslim entity. Not today or tomorrow but someday it will happen. If Americans want to know what their country will be like even fifteen or twenty years from now, Europe is a good example.  Melanie Phillips, the author of Londonistan, insists that we are not paying attention to what is happening in the Muslim world. She says we ought to be listening to them and understanding what their intentions are. Little by little Muslim efforts work tirelessly to change one aspect at a time.

The films message, look for it, recognize it, speak out against it before it is too late.

Americans and other westerners are vastly nave about the enemy we face. If we stop maybe they will stop. No, they won't stop, they will never stop. They, the enemy must be defeated thoroughly on all fronts devastatingly, and completely. That is the only thing that will defeat them. It requires a determination that is much bigger than the enemy can ever muster. The Third Jihad shows that if we are going to be victorious we are going to have to work much harder than we are now.

The choice is ours ultimately. How much do you value liberty? If it is anything to the right of Sharia law then Americans are going to have to get moving, because right now the enemy is winning. If we continue on our present course, our grandchildren will be praying to Allah five times a day and will consider the drawing of cartoons as a crime punishable by death.

are permitted to lie to anyone to
promote their evil doctrine. Women are
under severe oppression & are permitted
to be murdered if they do not follow
all their doctrine. The Shari'a Law is
so very evil & all Muslims must live

3611156,5,B001GH90J8,"I just watched ""The Third Jihad"" DVD that the liberal/PC media was all up in arms about. The short story is that an NYPD sargeant in a single precinct put it on a continuous loop in an administrative office. What follows is a review of the DVD w/o ANY media filtering or ""activist"" censorship. At the very beginning the film states that a small percentage of the world's Muslims are radical. Featured speakers include former New York City Mayor Rudolph Guiliani, NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Tom Ridge, former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. The film seeks to educate Americans about the threat posed by Islamic extremists. This is not a ""chicken-little-the-sky-is-falling"" type documentary. The simple message is that radical Islam presents a very real danger to American society. Media critiques of this DVD cited its inclusion of an image of the Muslim flag flying over the White House. This image is part of a propaganda film from a jihadist group. We learn that Sharia law has no regard for human rights. For example, women's and gay rights are non-existent in Sharia law. Sharia law is shown for the barbaric sytem it is. The danger of underestimating the problem of homegrown Islamic terrorists is shown very clearly. The cultural aspect of American Jihad includes the duplicitous use of our laws and rights to work towards the overthrow of American society. It further reports that Wahhabism, radical Saudi Arabian Islam, is dominant in many American mosques. Recall that most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudis. The group that protested most vehemently against the NYPD showing this DVD, The Council on American-Islamic Relations (""CAIR""), is exposed in this DVD for the jihadist front it is. While CAIR masquerades as a moderate Muslim group they are in reality practicing jihadist deception. Cair officially denounces only the terrorist group Al Qaeda but refuses to denounce Hamas or Hezbollah. We learn Cair was established by a Hamas front group. We also learn that the Muslim Brotherhood in North America has published a manifesto which describes its work in America as a ""Grand Jihad"". The basic premise of this documentary is that Americans needs to understand that the jihadist machinery is already present within American society. The bottom-line is that our very freedom and liberty are at stake due to the infiltration of Islamic extremists in America. There is nothing wrong with showing this DVD to all Americans as an educational documentary.  It does not condemn all Muslims as terrorists. It is clear that the only folks who would not want this DVD shown are the very people the DVD warns us about, the Islamic Jihadists are already on our soil. This film MUST be part of all American law-enforcement Academy recruit training. Further the film MUST be part of all law-enforcement agency annual in-service training. ISSUES: Did the NYPD even bother to watch ""The Third Jihad"" it before distancing itself from this educational documentary to appease CAIR?",1329696000,7,3003,5.078947368421052
3611157,5,B001GH90J8,"Far from being an attack on Islam, the opening lines of the film state clearly: ""This is not a film about Islam. It is about the threat of radical Islam.

Jasser, a devout Muslim of Syrian descent and a former US Navy lieutenant commander, is the founder of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy.

The fact that hate speech proliferates North American Islamic centers and that Western countries have stopped (and not stopped) numerous small and large-scale terrorist attacks since 9/11 not all of which were perpetrated by al-Qaida but home-grown independent extremists is something I think should certainly not be brushed off as phobic fear-mongering...",1309046400,9,620,5.336734693877551
3611163,5,B001GH90J8,"This is an outstanding DVD, made by a Muslim, and packed with hard evidence:  videos of Islamic leaders proclaiming their goal of destroying Western culture, not through imminent terrorism, but rather through deception and infiltration--a long-term goal to conquer the entire world and make all countries Islamic theocratic states subject to the law of Sharia.  The DVD exposes how purportedly ""moderate"" Islamic leaders in the United States and elsewhere are anything but.  Many are caught on tape advocating terrorism and the ultimate goal of global Islamic rule.  Many of the main purportedly ""moderate"" Islamic leaders in the United States have been convicted on terrorism charges.  The extreme repressiveness of Saudi Arabia, America's purported ally, is exposed, as is their massive exportation of extremist Wahhabist teachings through establishment of so-called ""madrassahs"" throughout the mideast, Asia and yes, the United States and Europe.  The Wahhabist sect is one of the most extreme and violent of Islamic sects.  The madrassahs established by the Saudis teach intolerance, hatred of the west and violent terrorist tactics to children throughout the world, starting from very early ages.  They have created the Islamic extremists, terrorists, and suicide bombers of today, and tomorrow.
  Despite all phony denials--as expressly admitted in this DVD by many of the major Islamic leaders in the U.S.--the ultimate goal of Islam is total global conquest.  The current violent terrorist acts and wars are merely feints designed--quite successfully--to keep attention away from the real jihadist movement, which is to infiltrate and destroy western democracies from within.
  For various reasons--extending from oil profits for corporations to ""political correctness""--the United States and most of Europe (the Netherlands being an exception)--have propagated the myth that Islamic extremists are simply a tiny fringe group representing no more than 1-2% of Muslims worldwide. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
  On the morning of 9/11, news programs showed film of massive crowds pouring into the streets of Palestine, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and elsewhere in joyous, ecstatic celebration of the horrible attacks on America and the deaths of so many thousand innocent citizens.
  Since that time, these videos have been surppressed, because they don't fit with the government's false assurances that the ""real"" Islam is a peaceful religion and that the terrorists represent only a tiny minority who have allegedly ""hijacked"" Islam.
  Polls in many Islamic countries have established that more than half of all Muslims either ""supported,"" ""sympathized with"" or ""admired"" Osama Bin Laden.
  The majority of Islamic sects are not peaceful, or tolerant, or respectful of basic human rights.  Among the worst are the Wahhabists who dominate Saudi Arabia and whose goals of terrorism and global conquest have been exported by Saudi Arabia around the world.
  American authorities stand idly by while these enemies of America send imams into U.S. prisons to brainwash and recruit many African-Americans and others to adopt their teachings of hate.  This must stop.
  Wahhabist principles--including the goal of Islamic global conquest and the morality of killing all non-Muslims--are also taught throughout the United Stated in mosques, Islamic centers and through Islamic groups and websites, many of whom purport to be ""moderate"" and on the surface lie and disavow such things.
  I am a far-left Democrat.  I voted for Obama, walked precincts for George McGovern, and have never voted for a Republican in my life.  This is NOT a partisan issue.  This is the most serious threat we have faced since Adolf Hitler and the Japanese in World War II.
  There is no possibility of avoiding a Third World War of the West versus Islam.  The Muslims have made that inevitable.
  America and Europe need to wake up and stop pretending that Islam is just a peaceful religion with no goal of global conquest.  If we keep our heads in the sand much longer, it will be too late.
  Watch this Muslim-produced DVD.  You will be absolutely shocked at what your government has NOT been telling you, and the absolute lies that it has been telling you.",1306281600,25,4250,5.340361445783133

The narrator of the film, Dr. Zahdi Jasser, tells us that his parents left Syria for the US, where he was born, to escape religious persecution.  I assume they were Muslims like him so I wonder what sect of Muslims are persecuted in Syria.  I think that Dr. Jasser's views may come from his denomination being out of the Islamic mainstream.

Also in the extras, was the only attempt in the film to refute the common ""left wing"" view that foreign occupation is the main cause that Muslims attack the west.  A very detailed presentation of evidence for that opinion, in particular for suicide terrorism, is found in the recent book by Pape and Feldman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cutting-the-Fuse-The-Explosion-of-Global-Suicide-Terrorism-and-How-to-Stop-It/dp/0226645606/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cutting the Fuse: The Explosion of Global Suicide Terrorism and How to Stop It</a>&nbsp;which is an extended version of the earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dying-to-Win-The-Strategic-Logic-of-Suicide-Terrorism/dp/0812973380/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism</a>.  In the movie, the dismissal of the point of view that we bring most of the problem of Islamic terror on ourselves is handled in no more than a minute or so by Melanie Phillips and Rudy Giuliani.  I think it requires a more thorough analysis.

In the main film, we hear about instances of groups of Muslims that are arrested for terror plots in the US, for example, the plot to blow up the Sear's Tower.  What is not mentioned is that most of the arrests were a result of sting operations and the plots may have never got going in the first place, without FBI help.

The basic thrust of The Third Jihad is a hand wringing, ""Oh, they are out to get us, and Europe is a lost cause."" message with very few reasonable solutions suggested.  One thing Dr. Jasser wants is more support for moderate Muslims like him.  I wonder if he supports the ""Ground Zero Mosque"", which is claimed to be a showcase for moderate Islam.",1295136000,8,2211,5.567164179104478
3611168,4,B001GH90J8,"This is an excellent video for someone who wants to learn some of the basic facts about Islam and its violent, global goals and threat to our country.  I have only two disappointments with the video.  First, the author/producer describes himself as a ""moderate Muslim"" leaving the impression that there are many others like him who are devout Muslims who disapprove of Jihad, which is a fundamental part of Islam itself and is clearly taught in the Koran. Second, the copy I received did not have the 30 minute version which I had seen with another copy of the video.  This 30 minute edition is much more palatable than the full-length version which is 2 hours long.",1294704000,4,666,4.6752136752136755

The downside is once you learn the truth and start looking into how we fight Islamic fundamentalism you will find out the FBI, CIA, and other groups our tax dollars fund don't have enough common sense to stay away from Muslim translators, how stupid is that. When I see that others such as Jewish arabic speaking individuals are turned away I just want to throw up. I think another good step after learning from this video is for people to go online and research where gas/oil companies buy their oil and refuse to buy gas from companies that buy Arab oil.",1265328000,16,792,4.584507042253521

FBI is have been constantly alerting American government on islamic threat, however, American government has been doing nothing to protect this country.

Although, when I viewed it, it seemed to be well made and to present an excellent treatment of the subject, I'm still wrestling with my main question/objection: how can a person who describes themselves as a devout Muslim - meaning someone who has read the Koran, understands everything it says and practices everything it teaches, which would, of course, include engaging in violent jihad, be against radical Islam and the stealth jihad in America? That question stands out like a neon pink 800 lb. gorilla.",1258070400,7,758,4.9763779527559056

A key element is to have good material.  And this DVD is that.  It exposes the growing danger of Radical Islam to our country and society.  The material is meticulous and well-presented.

And, as some ways in my book, you can use this DVD in several ways:

1.  Watch it yourself. Become conversant with its material to explain in 'Conversational Chess' with those individuals who don't understand the danger.

2.  Show Friends.  Get a few friends around the TV.  Tell them you've seen an interesting video and want their opinion.  Listen to them.  See what they don't understand. Explain.  Or find out more.

3. Find 'The Persuadables' - People that have yet to learn about Radical Islam.  Don't just show people who are already convinced.  Find uninformed people.

Thank you for helping our Great Country.

3611175,5,B001GH90J8,"""The Third Jihad"" is a crucial documentary for for future of democracy and western civilation. Narrated by Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, a Muslim who reveres both his faith and the United States (his adopted homeland), this cannot be construed as an anti-Muslim work; rather, it is anti-RADICAL Muslim. Drawing upon interviews with those fighting on both sides of the war on terrorism gives this inspiring work passion and credibility.

This is not just a problem in Islamic countries, it is a huge problem right here in the good old USA. Islamic apoligists will dis this DVD because they don't want you or your loved ones to see it. The best part is the narrator is a moderate Muslim who sounds the alarm for all freedom loving people to take immediate action. We must roll back the progress Islamofascists are making at sabotaging America by using our own liberal laws and political processes. Like the Nazis, the communists and the Ku Klux Clan, Islamic Supremacists believe it is their destiny to conquer and rule the world. And they are working hard to fulfill this anti-democratic goal.
