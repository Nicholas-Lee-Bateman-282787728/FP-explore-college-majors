509550,5,6302760119,"One of the most unusual westerns ever filmed, Duel at Diablo deals with a number of clicheish situations in a refreshing, fascinating manner.  More engrossing than entertaining, the intense emotion and delicately  intertwined subplots are almost hypnotically effective in holding the  viewer's attention.  James Garner, Sidney Poitier and Dennis Weaver  headline an excellent cast.  Beautiful locations and an eerie soundtrack  add to the overall power of the production.  This film is probably too  violent for many young viewers, but will prove a most satisfying experience  for western buffs who prefer gritty realism to the more common shlocky  horse operas.  Duel at Diablo will never be found in a listing of top  westerns, but it belongs there.  In fact, it holds its own in any movie  library, regardless of genre.",944006400,53,822,5.263565891472868

Always like Dennis Weaver, too, although he was one of the antagonists is this one. The down side is that like most westerns of that era, the Native Americans are portrayed as two dimensional characters and there is no attempt to understand their side of the story.  Of course, this is an entertainment piece, not a documentary and the sensibilities back then were not what they are today. With that in mind, it was an entertaining if rather predictable movie.",1481155200,,579,4.621359223300971

509572,3,6302760119,"Average western about a small group of green calvary soldiers tasked with transferring men and ammunition to a much larger area fort who are ambushed by Comanches and forced to hold up in a canyon, hoping they can stay alive long enough for scout Jess Remsberg (James Garner) to ride ahead to that fort and bring back reinforcements.

This being a film by middling social conscious director Ralph Nelson there are attempts at creating some moral complexity than don't quite come off.  Remsberg was married to a Comanche woman and is presented with her scalp early in the film, so he is looking for revenge.  There's also a white woman (Bibi Andersson) who was taken by the Comanche and rescued but runs away from her white husband (Dennis Weaver, very young and quite good) because her half Comanche baby son is still with the tribe.  But when she returns to the Comanches the chief blames her for his son's death and plans to bury her alive in his grave.

None of the above is really developed in any meaningful way and basically just feels like plot points added in to give the film a complexity that it never really earns.  Duel At Diablo is unusually even-handed in its treatment of Indians and cowboys.  Ralph Nelson also handles the first major action sequence surprisingly well, as the Comanche ambush the cavalry officers, capturing the confusion and violence of the sudden attack pretty effectively.  However, the next major action sequence where the cavalry tries to trick the Comanche and double back is pretty poorly staged and lacks the larger sweep and sense of detail that a more talented director might have brought to the pivotal sequence.  It just looks like the cavalry is riding around in a circle and it's rarely possible to get any sense whatsoever of where the Comanche are in relation to the cavalry or what it is the Comanche actually thinks is happening.  The sequence is ultimately slapdash and unexciting.

It's hard to watch Duel At Diablo without wondering what a more skilled and nuanced director would have done with the same material.  For director Ralph Nelson the message he is trying to convey frequently seems to be more important than the quality of the film itself.  He lucked into the perfect project for his sensibilities with his second theatrical film, Lillies of the Field, but things went pretty rapidly downhill from there with his social consciousness resulting in two of the worst films of his career in the same year--the horribly dated Tick...Tick...Tick... (about what happens when a black man is elected sheriff in a deeply racist, deep south town) and Soldier Blue (a heavy-handed attempt to do a Viet Nam allegory as a western), both in 1970.  As a director, Ralph Nelson never showed much technical skill or imagination and Duel At Diablo suffers as a result.  It's not really an entertainment like a John Wayne film or the countless other westerns from the 1960's, but the socially conscious elements are barely given any room to breathe because they are not sufficiently developed, so Duel At Diablo isn't really a serious message picture, either.  It occupies a space where its obvious ambition simply doesn't match the execution, resulting in a western that isn't terrible but isn't particularly good either.

James Garner made a fair number of westerns after his television show Maverick went off the air in 1962, but the more effective ones (Support Your Local Gunfighter; Support Your Local Sheriff; Skin Game) tended to take advantage of his facility for comedy.  Meat and potatoes dramatic acting isn't really his strength and he doesn't bring much gravity here to a role that could have used it.  Sidney Portier's effortless charisma is used more effectively, but this doesn't ultimately represent one of his better films either.  Dennis Weaver gives a strong supporting performance as the husband (and prominent local merchant) who loves his wife but is repulsed by the fact that she has lain with an Indian--and that's before he finds out about her half-breed baby.  He gives possibly the only emotionally complex performance in the film.  Bibi Andersson was perhaps hired because of the suffering she endured in Ingmar Bergman films.  She gives something of a one-note performance here and, like many foreign language actors and actresses working in Hollywood was always much more effective in her native language.  (She made the classic Persona the same year as Duel At Diablo).

Many people obviously hold this one in much higher regard than I do, but most movies over 20 years old seem to get a preponderance of highly positive reviews, regardless of the individual quality of the films.  This is probably because only people who really like the older films care enough to actually write reviews for them.  Or you can believe the user reviews which suggest that pretty much any movie that is more than 20 years old is a classic.  This is one of those middling films that seems to have way too many enthusiastic reviews.  Duel At Diablo isn't awful but unless you truly love the western genre there are much better ways to spend your time and far better movies to watch.",1477008000,,5140,4.875862068965517

509581,5,6302760119,"A good old fashion Western starring 'James Garner' as 'Jess Remsberg' (of course there are those of us that remember him in
the role of 'Bret Maverick' a T.V Western-Series that ran between 1957 - 1962)
'Jess Remsberg' an army/scout is asked to meet up with 'Lt Scotty McAllister' (Bill Travers) at an outpost/town, on-route he
comes across 'Ellen Grange' (Bibi Andersson) who seems to have a strange desire to return to an Apache Camp where she had
been held as a squaw.
'Jess' returns her to her husband 'Willard' (Denis Weaver) who seems less than happy to have her back.
'Lt McAllister' wants 'Jess' to scout for him on a journey through Apache Territory where he has to take wagons filled with
weapons and ammunition to 'Fort Concho' accompanied by an escort of raw-troops and newly acquired un-broken stallions.
The Lieutenant has a pouch to give to 'Jess' - horrifically it contains the scalp of his Comanche-Wife, whist this horror is being given
to'Jess' a horse trader 'Toller' (Sidney Poitier) not knowing it belonged to 'Jess's' wife makes light of the package, of course 'Jess'
wants to kill 'Toller' for the remarks, the Lieutenant steps in to prevent a flashpoint.
It seems that the answers to the killing of his wife may be found in Fort Concho, so he agrees to scout for the journey.
'Toller' who has sold horses to the army will only get his money for them all when he has broken them all in, so he also is along for
the dangerous journey.
'Willard' has a wagon of goods he needs to get to Fort Concho and has persuaded the outpost commander to allow him to be escorted
by the travelling troop, 'Willard's' wife has again run off, he doesn't care.
Well with many things going on the stage is set, the Apache's will attack the column for the weapons carried in the wagons, do the
green-recruits have any chance at all ? why is it so important to 'Ellen' to keep returning to the Indian Camp ? will 'Toller' get his
money for the horses supplied ? and will 'Jess' get his revenge for the killing of his Comanche wife ?
This is a pretty good western recently released onto the Blu-ray format.....the upgrade is good.....no problems to be had getting the
film to play in it's original language form...................can recommend giving this one a go.",1468281600,,2266,4.6393034825870645
509582,4,6302760119,"I'm giving this movie 3.5 stars but if I were just judging it on realism and plausibility, I would have to drop it a notch or two.  On the plus side, there's lots of beautiful scenery, lots of action (not always the way I think it would have gone down), and a pretty good cast.  Basically it's about a green cavalry troop on a mission that has run in with a band of Apaches (what looks like the entire Apache nation at one point!).  Despite its flaws, I generally enjoyed the movie.  Could have been as good as Ulzana's Raid with Burt Lancaster but falls short.",1467849600,,561,4.264150943396227

509604,5,6302760119,"In this western, that stars James Garner, and Sidney Poitier, a small U.S army column has to travel through Appache territory to get to a distant fort, and is attacked by a force nearly twice there size, for the weapons supplies it is carrying. And matches wits of those of the smaller inexperienced U.S. force, led by it's highly intelligent lieutenant (played by Bill Travers) against those of the larger Apache force, led by their chief,(played by John Hoyt). The ensuing battle makes for an exciting climax. Garner, a scout, seeks the person responsible for his wife's (an Apache) death, and Poitier, in his first western, plays a former seargent, breaks in wild horses for the army, as they travel together with the army. Bibi Andersson, and Dennis Weaver, also star, in this lesser known, but really good 1966 film.",1443398400,,821,4.871428571428571
509605,4,6302760119,"This movie takes a western cliche, the ambushed and besieged soldiers, and attempts to breathe new life into it. It is partially successful. The emphasis is on violence and racism. The film does a  very good job of showing that the issue of racism was far from clear cut and both sides had much to be ashamed of. The violence is overdone, in part, because of the common failure to understand the Indians, who were not professional soldiers and extremely casualty averse. In addition, the movie  adheres to the myth that scouts seldom got through; they usually did get through, because of poor Indian security and  the scouts had the good sense, unlike those in this film, to travel through dangerous territory at night.",1443225600,,719,4.782258064516129

You have perfect drama, sexuality, racial bias, the whole gammet is there from start to finish.  I don't think the late James Garner received the due credit he deserved as an actor while alive.  And casting Sidney Poitier was a stroke of genius.  I am not an expert on the old west, but I have read where initially, the Native Americans did nothing to African-Americans like they did to the white men crowding in, they viewed them as a captive brother.  Didn't take them long once they started to enlist in the military stationed in the mid-West to learn their initial views were wrong.  This is one of those westerns that once you sit down to watch, you suddenly realize the end theme is playing again, and it's over.  A fantastic movie from start to finish.  Over the years I had purchased three DVD copies of this movie, and when I saw it was coming out on Blu-ray, I was like a kid at Christmas morning.  I couldn't wait until I got my copy.

509661,2,6302760119,"I sold my DVD copy of Duel at Diablo in anticipation of the Blu release. That was a mistake.

The picture quality is almost the worst I've seen on Blu, and certainly the most inconsistent. At times, it is sharp, colorful, detailed--typical of a Blu of a neglected print from the 60s. At other times, it is muddied, drained, blurry. The quality varies greatly, even transitioning from shot-to-shot within a single scene--which is very jarring for the viewer, pulling one completely out of the movie experience.

The audio is flat and unremarkable. It all seems a very slapdash affair, prepared with no respect or affection for the film. Perhaps it is the best that could be done given the state of the original print; dirt, scratches, even what appears to be a burn-flash mar the master.

I own some 90 Westerns on Blu-Ray, and every one of them, even the worst, has to some degree been a marked improvement over the DVD version. I'm sorry to report that this is the first one I regret buying.",1406678400,14,992,4.625

509687,5,6302760119,"When you pop this movie into your player you had better have your popcorn, pop, or other snacks handy, and forget about using the bathroom. Within seconds of playing this movie we are introduced to the opening scene with a bloody hunting knife slashing the screen to shreds, then hang on! James Garner plays an Army scout trying to find out who murdered and  scalped his Indian wife. Sidney Poitier plays an ex-Army Sergeant now a gambler and bronc buster selling his horses to the Army, Bibi Andersson is a white woman from Fort Creel, kidnapped by the Apaches, her Apache husband is killed and she is recaptured by the Cavalry, but she escapes trying to get back to her tribe, for a reason nobody suspects, and not knowing the Apaches want her dead, her husband was the Chief's son, Dennis Weaver is the husband whose hatred for the Indians is so intense he cannot forgive the woman he loves, no matter how he tries, and Bill Travers is the Army Captain loaded down with weapons and ammo heading out from Fort Creel to Fort Concho with a troop of green recruits, meanwhile, Chata, Bibi Andersson's father-in-law is out to capture the ammo and make a name for himself with a party twice the size of the Army escort.

This is not your standard Cavalry vs Indians movie, it's a murder mystery, a comment on race, a story about loyalty, courage, love, forgiveness, and mercy told against a landscape of brutal beauty where only the strong survive, and James Garner is at his best as are the others. The suspense and action build until the final conflict in a box canyon called Diablo, the only water for miles, inside. Even the theme score by Neal Hefti is tough, and in my opinion one of the best Western themes in history.

If you're looking for a western that pulls no punches and is as tough and gritty as the actors, story, and landscape, you can't go wrong if you check out DUEL AT DIABLO. You won't see that I purchased this, as I got it from my son for Christmas. Even he liked it and he doesn't like many westerns.

As an aside, you might be interested to know that James Garner did his own stunts in the movie, and like so many of the older actors they are believable in their parts, you can actually imagine Garner as the tough Army scout, as well as the others: Poitier, Travers, Weaver they all do an outstanding job. And I say to them ""Thanks"" for this movie.

509732,5,6302760119,"DUEL AT DIABLO is an exceptional and innovative Western full of gritty action, unsentimental characters and austere and foreboding landscapes. Many of this film's elements are a bit more reality based considering the harshness and brutality of the chiseled faces of its characters, locations and violence all breaking from the traditional Western genre. Neal Hefti's innovative modern sounding score is a giant departure from that which Dimitri Tiomkin had established for the genre. Here Hefti breaks down that myth with a cool and easy sounding reoccurring theme which actually reflects the indifference of the characters' aspirations to appreciate the grandeur of the traditional Western setting or lifestyle. Director Ralph Nelson chooses to represent the degradation of the American Indian as a society driven to hostile acts commensurate to the injustices of their plight. Under Nelson's direction the Indians are not an inherently violent society but are survivors of a hostile environment and are a natural force to be reckoned with. However, this point is often overlooked by the somewhat engaging and rousing visual crescendo of the violence. Along with HOUR OF THE GUN this is one of James Garner's more brutal and cynical roles and is again motivated by revenge. Sidney Poitier also is not along for the ride for any ambitions of nobility. As a horse breaker ex-cavalryman Poitier must accompany the raw troupe, under the command of Bill Travers, into hostile territory breaking horses along the way for the army or he stands to not get paid a cent. Every character has reasons for being embroiled in this tale but it seems to be for reasons of revenge, greed or just plain survival.",1379462400,,1695,5.167272727272727

His depiction of an officer doggedly carrying on his task with dwindling odds of success is a key element of the movie and deserves a little attention.

James Garner, Sidney Poitier, Bibi Andersson, Bill Travers and Dennis Weaver each performed exceptionally.  I even like the detail of how ""someone"" trained James Garner's horse to ""hang his head"" as he plods faithfully through the desert.  That touch adds another layer of realism to the story line.

Watching western movies over the years on television.  I find that I never see the whole movie when presented.  I have been picking up videos that I enjoyed and reviewing them again.

509770,5,6302760119,"This is the most unusual western ever made, and one of the best. The many reviewers of this movie have done a good job analyzing it, I am just going to add a few more.  First, the direction of Ralph Nelson is superb. We have here a most engrosing atmosphere of the old west as it was, cruel and unforgiven, and the unusual musical score is daunting and a major element here.  Think about 'High Noon' or the 'Third Man' without their magnificent sound tracks. This is one of the few movies which shows the unusual cruely and sadism of the Indians, such as agonazing slow death by burning, and a promise to bury alive our blond heroin. For those who cannot believe how sadistic the plain Indians were, I refer them to a few recent books by Michno. I know that there are many multiculturalists who have never had to fight for their freedom and many young Americans who's cruel western history have been denied to them in school who would refuse to believe that the 'proud native Americans' could rival the inquisition.  Wake up dudes, the settleing of America was saturated with blood and gore of European pioneers, who were tortured and enslaved by the Indians.  Of course, as it is pointed out in this movie, the Indians were lied to, deceived, and deprived of their hunting grounds. And, as some historians maintain, there was no better way of settling a wild country by a Victorian culture confronted with stone age savages
Two errors in this movie require comments. In one scene, our heroin wears tight pants
revealing a sexy anatomy that would drive the entire seventh cavalry to madness. No woman in west wore tight pants, or any pants for that matter.  Second, Sidney Poitier has a major part as a ex-soldier-horse dealer-gunfighter. There were no such blacks in the west. There is no record of even one black gunfighter in the west.  The west was largely racist and didn't welcome non Europeans.  Well, the movie was made in 1966, hence the above.",1289001600,3,1953,4.627167630057803
509771,5,6302760119,"Favorite of mine for a long time. James Gardner rescues a white woman from Apaches yet, she goes back for her child. He of course was fathered by an Indian and the town and her own husband are outraged. Thinking she should have killed herself when captured. Sidney Poitier is also good in this movie about the war in the west between the white man and indians.",1279238400,,360,4.388059701492537
509772,4,6302760119,"Overall, this film is very entertaining. The interaction of the main characters are well defined especially Sidney Portier, James Garner,Dennis Weaver and Bibi Anderson. Lots of good action and worth viewing.",1278979200,,208,5.741935483870968
509773,3,6302760119,"This picture is a little overrated in some quarters, but does offer some good action as well as nice character touches from the two strong leads.  The picture's kind of a bridge between the classic mainstream Western of the day and the more anti-heroic later 60s fare.  Also, there's a more enlightened take on the Apaches, even if they are the villains for the most part.

Portier's a little underused, but his caustic yet grudgingly respectful byplay with Bill Travers is one of the film's highlights.  The real acting honors go to Dennis Weaver who's unsympathetic turn as Bibi Andersen's weak husband is perfectly acted.

Very catchy but subtly employed Neil Hefti score.",1271548800,2,675,4.938053097345133
509774,4,6302760119,"This is not the best western I have seen in my youth, but it's very good. I have shown recently and it's excellent. The plot isn't original, but the actors are very appropriate, specially James Garner. It's rare to see Bibi Anderssen, a Swedish artist from Ingmar Bergman movies, in a western. Perhaps Sidney Poitier seems some ridiculous with his rare, extravagant suit until the fight begins.
And there are another factor some westerns have, some not, and is the soundtrack. This is very, very good, not as popular as ""High Noon"" or some else, but excellent, reflecting very well the climate of solitude and danger of the desert.",1269993600,,631,4.798165137614679
509775,5,6302760119,Duel At Diablo is a good old fashion cowboy & Indian flick. It has an excellent cast. James Garner is always excellent in westerns. He plays a gritty Indian scout out to find who killed his Indian wife. Sidney Poitier is great as a retired Cavalry Sargent ready to go into business getting horses for the Army. He winds up getting caught up in the battle between the soldiers and the Apaches. Dennis Weaver is excellent at playing a real bastard. the film shows how reslient the Apache Indian was and how savage they could be. There is plenty of action in this movie.  It is filled with Good performances. I highly recommend this movie. If you are a western fan I think you will enjoy this film.,1256515200,,695,4.4296875
509776,5,6302760119,"I'll be honest I recently bought this DVD due to the fact that James Garner and Dennis Weaver were in it. Being 21 years old I watched ""Maverick"" with James Garner as a kid and really got to like him a lot. Since the releases of Gunsmoke seasons to DVD, I've really gotten to like Dennis Weaver. The other actors in the movie I have never even heard of before but they did their parts really well in the movie.

I thought this movie was really good. It kept you interested in what was going to happen next. I didn't like the fact however that in the begining Dennis Weaver's character seemed so caught up in himself and didn't seem to care that his wife kept running back to the Apache's. However during the movie you could start to see it was an act and that it did bother him and he was deep down a caring husband after all. I was however shocked at the end when James Garner found out who it was that had killed his wife. (that happened before the movie starts.)

I also, even though I never heard of him before, liked the character of Sidney Poitier. I think that he really did that character really well and very beleivable.

Despite the fact that I bought it for James Garner and Dennis Weaver being in it, I really liked this movie and not just because of them  but for the whole cast and the plot. I have started a western movie collection of my own and this is a great new addition to it and it would be for any western movie collection.",1242086400,,1446,4.190647482014389
509825,4,6302760119,"The 1960's featured some of most underappreciated, un-talked-about, forgotten, yet, finest Westerns ever. These include HOMBRE [1967], THE APPALOOSA [1966], NEVADA SMITH [1966] and this film. With the box-office flop of THE ALAMO [1960] it appeared fans were growing weary of the Western genre until they began riding the crest of the ""Spaghetti Western"" craze heralded by FISTFUL OF DOLLARS [1964] and culminating in the classic THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY [1966]. However lost in this transition were these four excellent films. DUEL AT DIABLO's biggest handicap was its title which evoked thoughts of a rough-and-tumble, violent, bloody TOMBSTONE [1993] or WILD BUNCH [1969]-type story. None of that here as this was more a provocative film dealing with social egoism, social tolerance, courage and survival. It's powerful assests are its storyline [American prejudgement and mistreatment of Native Americans], it's variegated group of actors, all giving fine performances, and possibly the most evocative, if not the greatest, music score of any Western ever [ok, ok, THE ALAMO's ""Green Leaves of Summer"" is right there, and Max Steiner's rousing score for THE CHARGE AT FEATHER RIVER, 1953, is right at its tail]. Here, we have James Garner seeking vengence for the murder of his Indian wife by a white man, and Dennis Weaver embarrassed and distancing himself from his rescued white spouse who had been kidnapped by the Indians and had conceived a child by one of them. In the middle of this mess, the US army is trying to do the right thing---protect American lives. Garner, surly, vulnerable but determined, underplays his role well and is his usual excellent self. Weaver, always one of our most underappreciated actors, is marvelous as the bigoted then ambivalent husband of 'white squaw' Bibi Anderson. Sidney Poitier portrays a rare figure for those days, a Black man in  a white mans business---breaking and selling horses---and doing it with confidence, effrontery and cojones. Bill Travers is the leutenant who has to lead this motley group from one Fort to another through Indian territory---a stereotypic Western sojourn made interesting by the small size of the group and their conflicting self-interests. Travers is a complex characterization as he is self-serving but often sympathetic yet always dutiful to his Country and the Army in the usual automaton fashion. The score is awesome evoking a sense of both duty and destiny from our heroes as they arrive hobbled and fragmented for 'the last stand' at the boxed-in Diablo Canyon. How this score is not on any of the numerous Western CD compilations out on the market is incomprehensible to me and just confirms how these record companies just don't know what they are doing. Director Ralph Nelson went on to present the theme of US injustice against the Indians in a less subtle fashion in SOLDIER BLUE [1970]---a similarly offbeat yet more violent Western. Although HOMBRE was probably the best Western tackling this theme, Duel at Diablo had more drama, more action, was more fun and had the great soundtrack. I had the rare pleasure of seeing this film in a theater when it was first released in 1966 and it had an even greater dramatic impact on the big screen including the opening & closing knife-cutting-an-""X"" on the screen image.

509827,4,6302760119,"James Garner's easy-going charm made him a bankable star for most of his career. But, every so often, he didn't mind stepping out of his comfort zone to try different, more hard-bitten roles. Case in point: DUEL AT DIABLO, a near classic western drama which not only showcased a more intense James Garner but also the great Sidney Poitier. DUEL AT DIABLO was made in 1966 and it's not your typical western. This one eschews the black and white good guy/bad guy sensibilities often reflected in this film genre. Instead, DUEL AT DIABLO unfurls themes colored more in shades of grey and not so easily resolved. This is far removed from the lighthearted likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Support-Your-Local-Sheriff/dp/B000056H2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Support Your Local Sheriff</a>&nbsp;or MAVERICK.

Always gritty and, at times, bleak and brooding, DUEL AT DIABLO is peopled with complex, no-nonsense types. As the film rolls along, don't be too surprised if you find your opinions shifting with regards to these characters. Almost from the get-go it dawns on us that this picture doesn't intend to run by the numbers. The opening sequence tells of frontier scout Jess Remsberg (Garner) rescuing a white woman abducted by Apaches and returning her to her home, only to have the townspeople and the woman's husband treat her with indifference and scorn. So, right away, there's an undercurrent of unease felt on the screen.

Meanwhile, Remsberg learns of the brutal murder of his Comanche wife and means to find the killer and then not kill him easy. He agrees to scout for a cavalry troop heading thru perilous Apache country with a cache of ammo and bolstered in part by green recruits, as the troop's destination of a distant Army fort coincides with Remsberg's. Along for the ride and not ecstatic about it is a tough but well-dressed horse breaker and ex-soldier named Toller (Poitier). A civilian with his own shipment also manages to attach himself to the cavalry. The last member of this military jaunt happens to be the same woman Remsberg had rescued, as it turns out she has further personal business with the Apaches.

The action sequences are moderately intense. There are passages replete with rollicking fistfights, gunfights, ambushes, chases, and fleeting moments of torture (or, rather, the aftermath of torture). DUEL AT DIABLO addresses certain social issues (the American Indian's plight, the persona non grata status of Mrs. Grange, who involuntarily had spent time with the ""savages""), yet the film is clever enough to cloak its messages under an action-packed plot. DUEL AT DIABLO doesn't champion the proud Apaches' cause as much as attempt to have a representation of their side of things. They do come off a bit sympathetic (it seems that the tribe treated Mrs. Grange better than the townspeople), but, well, naturally, I was rooting more for Garner and Poitier's posse to come out on top. The action culminates in a harrowing last stand at a place called Diablo Canyon. It's intense stuff as the cavalry unit has its members rapidly whittled down. And yet when the good guys do win out and the bad guys led away at gunpoint, it doesn't quite feel like your normal western flick ending. Not everything is tied up in a nice, neat bow. It's very much up in the air whether the hero gets the girl. Remsberg does get his revenge, but whether it's a satisfactory comeuppance, that's another thing. And the Apaches, proud and straight standing to the end, they get sent back to their reservation. Definitely not a happy ending for them...

The cast is uniformly very good, with several actors playing against type (notably, Dennis Weaver, in a hiss-worthy role). I'm even fond of that poor Lieutenant with the Irish accent who kept accumulating wounds (poor fella). Sidney Poitier brings his vaunted presence and is cool, commanding and even dapper. It's always a bit of a twist seeing the affable James Garner switch up and play a role this dark and driven. The only other similarly grim western which comes to mind is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Man-Called-Sledge/dp/B0001AVZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Man Called Sledge</a>, and that one's not as good as DUEL AT DIABLO. And Luther Sledge isn't as likable as Jess Remsberg. Garner also imbues Remsberg with this engaging quality of weary savviness. And, as always, Garner is so natural on screen and keeps it so low key that he comes off as wholly believable, making Remsberg's moments of quiet despair and bursts of violence even more palpable things.

DUEL AT DIABLO gives you pause, gives you a glimpse of how brutal and unforgiving the American frontier really was. This is a movie in which James Garner doesn't charm or trick the bad guys into submission. Rather, he intimidates and beats the living bejeesus out of them. Garner isn't flashy and mannered in his acting; in fact, you never see him acting, and this is what makes him so good.

After the pablum served up in the 40's and 50's, this is one of the first movies to portray the relationship between the American Indian and the white man in a realistic light.  There were no clear cut ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", all had faults, all had prejudices toward the other that led to hatred.  The punishment netted out to Dennis Weaver (another excellent performance)seems cruel, but, when balanced against what he did in retaliation against his wife's kidnapping by the Apaches, may seem to be expected, if not deserved.

509832,5,6302760119,"I grew up watching westerns on VHS, but I felt I had out grown them when I reached High School. The few I still liked were either more modern or ones that I had seen at just the right age for me to accept them as part of the natural order of things and that was that (Same reason Errol Flynn is the only Robin Hood and Tyrone Power is Zorro, anybody else is just an actor). Other westerns I watched seemed silly and cheesy, simplistic stories of good and bad with no depth. It was around this time when I saw the Big Country and Duel at Diablo for the first time. In these films, I saw for the first time westerns that were more than cowboys and Indians.

Duel at Diablo has many plot lines, from the common Calvary vs. Indians to James Garner seeking vengeance for his Indian wife. But the film is really about how people survived in the west. Nobody in the film is a ""bad guy,"" although some are more morally reprehensible than others. Everyone just wants to get by with their life, to live with the freedom that was the dream of the American West. Unfortunately, as history taught us, everybody's dream conflicted. The film does not pull punches when it comes to showing how both sides felt they had a legitimate claim to the land but also that members of each side understood the other's claim.

Finally, to address another reviewer who pointed out what he considered major and blatant flaws in the movie. The first is the soundtrack, which I enjoyed and I wish I could find a recording. It is a bit bouncy at times, but not in happy-go-lucky way. It seemed to me to more exemplify that through all the sorrow and hardship, people did find joy in their lives, that they believed all the work was worth it to live as free men. The second flaw referred to Sidney Poitier's character, commenting on the fact that people seemed remarkably tolerant for a time that the reviewer felt was not. In fact, this is one of the movies strengths. The film demonstrates that capability was valued far more highly than skin color. They cannot afford the ""luxury"" of being racist; they have more important things to worry about. It was at a later point, historically, as settlements grew and became stable, that racism would have set in. But on the frontier, as isolated as these people are, they cannot afford to drive away a man as obviously talent or capable as Sidney Poitier's character.

All-in-all, a very well done movie and my favorite western to date.",1155254400,30,2448,4.472035794183445
509833,5,6302760119,"Lt. McAllister repeats that line from Robert Burns' poem, ""Scots Wha Hae"", as he faces battle with Chata in this thought provoking Western.  This movie displays alot of different racial facets.  There's the black Sergeant turned Army horse breaker, Toller (Sidney Poitier).  The Scout who married an Indian and seeks revenge from her killer, Remsberg (James Garner).  The Freighter's wife captured by Indians who after rescue returns to the Indians, Ellen Grange (Bibi Anderson).  The Lieutenant who's looking for promotion via an Indian military campaign, McAllister (Bill Travers).  The Indian hating Freighter who has his own agenda, Grange (Dennis Weaver). An Apache Chief who is trying to keep his people together against increasing encroachments from the white man, Chata (John Hoyt).  All this comes together at a box canyon, with a waterhole, known as Diablo.

This is a well organized movie that brings to head all these different elements.  It could be argued that this was more of a  career vehicle for Sidney Poitier than it was for James Garner.  Well worth adding to any western collection.  There are many standout moments in this film.  I really liked the thoughtful imagery at the ending as Toller says goodbye to Lt. McAllister.",1146096000,2,1246,5.1393034825870645
509834,5,6302760119,"""Duel at Diablo"" is a gritty, realistic, top-notch Western directed by Ralph Nelson and released in 1966. James Garner stars as the independent scout. Garner is, of course, the quintessential Westerner, and this is his best Western role, in my opinion, more serious than Maverick. Sidney Poitier plays a man contracted by the US Army to break-in horses. Although a black man, he's not at all out-of-place in this yarn (it was apparently a new concept at the time to prominently feature black people in Westerns).

Dennis Weaver is also on hand as the made-out-to-be-unlikable merchant who ultimately gets his comeuppance (but who can blame him for how he felt?); Bibi Andersson plays his adulterous wife; and Bill Travers is excellent as the Army commander.

Aside from the excellent cast ""Duel"" is highlighted by magnificent Southern Utah locations and a phenomenal score by Neal Hefti. Some describe this score as offbeat; I suppose it is, but it somehow fits the Western genre. From what other reviewers say it's obviously a love-it-or-hate-it piece. I happen to love it; in fact, I feel it ranks up there with the best cinematic scores. Interestingly, Jerry Goldsmith ripped-off the basic melody of Hefti's composistion for his equally-excellent score for ""Bandelero!"" two years later.

The opening and ending sequences with Hefti's great score are memorable and moving. This is great filmmaking.

You'll note that Poitier's character and the Army commander are quite at odds with eachother, but note how one clearly shows his respect and honor toward the other at the very end.

""Duel"" was one of the first Westerns I was ever exposed to and is therefore the standard by which I judge other Westerns. Because of this I naturally expect gritty realism and objectivity in any Western I view. This explains why I turned ""Hondo"" off at the 20 minute mark because of its artificial depiction of the Native American. It also explains why I scoff at the goofiness of so many spaghetti Westerns and am bored by their unrealistic, uncaptivating storylines. (Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the entrancing score to ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly;"" it's just that the story itself puts you to sleep).

""Duel"" also stands the test of TIME. Seeing it today, it's hardly aged at all. Compare this to, say, ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" and ""The Searchers,"" classics that haven't aged very well.

My overall grade for ""Duel at Diablo"" is A-. Although the first and last acts are strong and compelling, the second act is weak and uninteresting despite the fact that it has lots of calvery v.s. Indians action. Regardless, ""Duel"" ranks up there with the all-time best Westerns like ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" ""Wyatt Earp,"" ""Nevada Smith,"" True Grit,"" ""Jubal,"" ""Dances With Wolves,"" ""Purgatory,"" ""Shane/Pale Rider"" (essentially the same story), ""Bandelero!,"" ""Unforgiven,"" ""MacKenna's Gold"" and ""3:10 to Yuma.""",1144713600,5,2915,5.060416666666667
509881,5,6302760119,"Back in Sixth Grade this was my promotion present. My promotion present? Yes, I got promoted from Sixth Grade! For my efforts and this meager accomplishment my parents took me to see DUEL AT DIABLO. This was a pretty neat film and a pretty violent one at that. I loved it. At that age back in those days this was a neat stuff. No doubt it is one of my cherished memories.

DUEL AT DIABLO is an exceptional Western full of gritty action, unsentimental characters and austere and foreboding landscapes. Many of this film's elements are a bit more reality based considering the harshness and brutality of the chiseled faces of its characters, locations and violence all breaking from the traditional Western genre. Neal Hefti's innovative modern sounding score is a giant departure from that which Dimitri Tiomkin had established for the genre. Here Hefti breaks down that myth with a cool and easy sounding reoccurring theme which actually reflects the indifference of the characters' aspirations to appreciate the grandeur of the traditional Western setting or lifestyle.  Director Ralph Nelson chooses to represent the degradation of the American Indian as a society driven to hostile acts commensurate to the injustices of their plight. Under Nelson's direction the Indians are not an inherently violent society but are survivors of a hostile environment and are a natural force to be reckoned with. However, this point is often overlooked by the somewhat engaging and rousing visual crescendo of the violence. Along with HOUR OF THE GUN this is one of James Garner's more brutal and cynical roles and is again motivated by revenge. Sidney Poitier also is not along for the ride for any ambitions of nobility. As a horse breaker ex-cavalryman Poitier must accompany the raw troupe, under the command of Bill Travers, into hostile territory breaking horses along the way for the army or he stands to not get paid a cent. Every character has reasons for being embroiled in this tale but it seems to be for reasons of revenge, greed or just plain survival.",1143590400,,2054,4.95072463768116

Jess Remsberg (James Garner) is after the man who murdered h9s Indian wife and scalped her.  During his search, he rescues a woman who has been taken by the Apaches, Ellen Grange (Bibi Anderson), who has had a baby son by the son of Chata, the Apache chief (John Hoyt).  She leaves her husband, Willard Grange (Dennis Weaver), and returns to the Indian camp to retrieve her baby, Chata's grandson.  Again she is rescued by Remsberg.

An army patrol is escorting  Grange and his wife, along with Remsberg and Toller, a Contract Horse Dealer and ex-soldier (Sidney Poitier) when they are attacked by Chata and his band of renegades, and trapped in a box canyon.  The situation looks hopeless.

This is the story: Remsberg is seeking revenge, Toller wants payment for the horses he has sold to the army, Ellen Grange is trying to save her baby, her husband is trying to avoid Remsberg's revenge and the patrol is trying to stay alive.  This is a good drama, well acted and directed.

509883,3,6302760119,"I love a good western, and Duel at Diablo certainly contained enough elements of the classic western movie to keep me interested throughout it's 103 minute running time, but some flaws seemed a bit obvious.
The movie centers on a plot to deliver a cache of ammunition from one fort to another through a harsh and foreboding desert land.  The troops are green and inexperienced, and the desert terrain is the least of their worries as a local Apache tribe has decided to mount a last stand against the injustices heaped upon them and attack the convey and steal the munitions in an effort to free themselves and their spirits from the poor treatment and paltry reservation land given to them by the uncaring government.
James Garner plays Jess Remsburg, an experienced scout who has a personal interest in following the convey to their destination as he believes the murderer of his Native American wife is there.  Sidney Poitier is also along for the ride, as Toller, an ex-army man turned horse dealer that supplies the cavalry with raw mustangs.  Turns out he won't get paid for his recent delivery of horses as they are not saddle broken and he must ride with the convey and tame the horses along the way.  The other recognizable actor is Dennis Weaver, who plays Willard Grange, a merchant who must get a load of supplies to the fort, and wheedles his way to tag along with the cavalry, despite protests from the lieutenant in charge, as the lieutenant thinks speed will be of the utmost importance, with the Apache tribe on the warpath and the lack of experience in his troops.  Also, there is yet another interesting subplot involving Grange and his wife, Ellen, played by Bibi Andersson.  Seems at some point prior to the events in the movie, she was kidnapped by the Apaches and escaped only to return to a disappointed husband and unfriendly townspeople as she has now been 'spoiled' with her extended contact with the Apache tribe.  She has a special interest in returning to the tribe, which is revealed later in the movie.
The director does a wonderful job maintaining continuity between the various plot threads, and conveying the sense of danger between the harsh environments and the disgruntled Native Americans on the Warpath.  The fighting is done with a sense of realism and seems quite brutal at times, but never really goes over the top and there is very little glorification of the old west, as seen in many other westerns.  The various subplots do provide a nice sense of depth for the main characters, helping the audience develop a feeling of familiarity towards the characters, even the Native Americans.  I never got a sense that the movie was portraying the Native Americans as bad guys, and the cavalry as good guys, but just people doing what they had to do based on either orders from superior officers, in the case of the cavalry, or the need for survival and a tired sense of being pushed around a regulated to less than hospitable lands by an uncaring government, in the case of the Native Americans.
The flaws of the movie, in my opinion, are few, but somewhat noticeable.  The biggest one was the music.  The western score was tinged with a sort of bouncy beat that detracted seriously from what was being shown on the screen.  It would, almost in a humorous fashion, counteract the urgency and danger in specific scenes.  Another issue I had, a subtler one, was the character Toller, played by Sidney Portier.  He's an excellent actor, and I have no problems with his performance, but since this movie was probably set in the early to mid 19th century, I found it really odd how accepting all the Caucasian characters were of having an African American so closely in the midst as I believe the was a lot more racial intolerance at this time than the movie would have you believe.  Sure, there was some towards the Native Americans in the movie, but no one seemed to notice Toller was an African American, and the cavalry troops certainly didn't seem to mind taking orders from him after their lieutenant was injured.  On the flipside, it was refreshing to think that things could have been this way back then, but realistically, I doubt it.  The total absence of any racial tensions between Toller and the Caucasian characters seemed to really stand out.
All in all good, solid western movie, with some pretty violent scenes that portrays both sides of the conflict in a seemingly real sense, allowing for empathy to develop for both sides, showing us the world is not black and white, figuratively speaking.  The picture is in wide screen format, and is crisp and clear showing many beautiful desert landscapes between all the killing.  The audio was quite good, also, sounding clear und unmuddled.  There are subtitles available, but I didn't need to use them as I could hear all the dialog clearly.  Throw in a trailer and that's it for the special features, but, as always, I'd prefer an excellent print and good audio to gobs of useless features I'll probably never watch.",1073433600,32,5014,4.732491389207807
509884,5,6302760119,"When this film originally came out in 1966 it held the distinction of being the most violent western made to date. Viewed today, it still packs a fair wallop - which is hardly surprising considering that director Ralph Nelson went on to make the ultra-bloody Soldier Blue a few years later. The movie closely follows Marvin H Albert's novel (he's had a few of his western novels adapted for the screen, including The Law and Jake Wade) in its story of a cavalry patrol that inadvertently ends up in a life and death struggle with an Apache war party that has skipped the reservation. The action sequences are among the most exciting on film, particularly the initial ambush and the race to reach Diablo Canyon (the only source of water for miles). James Gardner is suitably tough as the army scout and Dennis Weaver comes across well as the rascist trader with a nasty secret. Neal Hefti's pulsating music score adds to the tension. I'd put this up there among the top ten westerns, because it succeeds in doing what it sets out to do - to give you a roller coaster of a ride while being relatively intelligent to boot. Shame about the 1.77.1 screen ration tho. Was this really the original theatrical screen ratio?",1070323200,3,1215,4.62962962962963
509885,4,6302760119,"Duel at Diablo is an excellent western that deals with more than just the battles between the cavalry and Indians, but also the tensions among the groups.  The movie follows a supply train through the desert as they are harassed by an Apache chief, Chata, and his band of renegades.  Trapped in the desert without any water, the supply train must fight their way out.  There is plenty of good action here as well as very good characters.  The movie deals with racism throughout since one of the main characters was kidnapped by Apaches and forced to live with them.  When she escapes from the village, the people at Fort Creel look down upon her with disgust.
 James Garner stars as Jess Remsberg, the army scout who is also trying to track down the killer of his Indian wife.  His role is very good and also different from what his fans might be expecting of him.  Sidney Poitier plays Toller, the ex-sergeant who now accompanies the wagon train to break in their new horses for him.  I hadn't seen Poitier in a western, but he is very good in this role alongside Garner.  Dennis Weaver and Bibi Anderson star as the Granges.  Anderson's character was abducted by Apaches and escapes but now wants to go back and live among them.  Weaver's Will Grange is a rascist and very dislikable.  Bill Travers plays Lt. Scotty McCallister, the leader of the wagon train who is desperately trying to get a promotion.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation that looks very good and also a theatrical trailer.

I was on the edge of my seat through out most of the movie  and I can't say I've experienced that with many recent movies. The filmmakers pulled no punches, especially when depicting scenes of torture at the hands of the Apaches, none of which is exploitative or gratuitous, and the Apaches' viewpoint is poignantly expressed, which lends credence to some of the atrocities.

7830886,4,6302760119,James Garner stars as Cavalry Scout in this fanciful movie about a green Cavalry unit trying to move horses and ammo 2 a Southwestern fort. Sidney Poitier is also in the movie as a former sergeant who is just a long to bring horses more or less. Dennis Weaver is a businessman whose wife had been captured by Indians then rescued and then she ran away to the Indians again. I'm not sure what the point is some of the movie was but there was a lot of good shooting and some nice scenery. Not the greatest Cavalry movie but worth watching.,1503705600,,537,4.2745098039215685
