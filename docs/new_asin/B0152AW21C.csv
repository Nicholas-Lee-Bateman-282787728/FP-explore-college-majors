8732454,4,B0152AW21C,"Wild City is Hong Kong based action film. The plot is based around a young woman who has been shunned by her lawyer boyfriend who is in cahoots with a crime boss. Via various means she ends up teaming up with two step brothers one of whom is a small time occasional criminal and the other a one time policeman. The action centres around the trio trying to extricate themselves from the attentions of a couple of gangs of thugs being run by the lawyer effectively on behalf of the crime boss chap (whose character is hardly featured in the film, the main bad guy protagonist in terms of screen time is the lawyer). One of these groups in particular is quite nasty, heavies from Taiwan who are pretty committed to whatever cause they choose to give their allegiance to.

The film is well paced with some nice set piece action sequences. The acting isn't bad for the most part and the cinematography is fine, a few nice panorama shots of Hong Kong are in the mix and for the rest of it you feel there has been intelligent use of the urban setting. Some scenes are reasonably violent, the menace factor going up due to the committed and pre-meditated nature of much of it.

Adequate screen time is given to backstory  especially of the step brothers  and the bit part actors slot into their roles nicely enough. There are some intelligent set ups herein and it is definitely a cut above the sort of Asiatic movie that is really just a vehicle for endless and interminable martial arts demonstrations. The characters are relatively believable and again the actors and indeed the director deserves credit for this.

The films resolution is well done. It doesnt shy away from people getting their just desserts and the movie rather admirably shies away from any sort of forced romantic angles or too many overblown explosions and other wow factor gambits. Its nice a nicely realised action movie.

My copy rather strangely came with a menu screen that had headings for a couple of items such as previews that didn't actually function. But the play, scene selection and set-up buttons functioned fine. I found the subtitles easy to read/follow and the English therein is far better than the horrific quality of the English found in the blurb on the back of the DVD packaging.",1458777600,,2267,4.655
