4991192,1,B006IRQUF8,"This film won awards at film festivals and I can only see one reason for it to have won. The cinematography and acting job by the lead character. The film other than that was a bore for me. There was nothing that shocking or shocking at all in the film. But I will give credit to the filmmaker for his directing and the supberb acting, and thats about it. For fans of horror and bizarre cinema skip it.",1339027200,4,402,4.166666666666667
4991193,5,B006IRQUF8,"That is what comes out right off the bat after watching this movie, this is the first time I ever had to write a review right after seeing a movie cause it moved me so. First the other reviewer was right there is some hardcore scenes in this movie but it is unlike any other movie that I can think of, if want to see something that is uniquely bizarre that will truly blow your mind CHECK THIS OUT.

4991194,5,B006IRQUF8,"After reading many comments and reviews of this film from its festival run, I had to purchase my very own copy. Let me start off by saying.......WOW! I was NOT disappointed. Visually it is simply stunning. Some of the best cinematography ever! There's plenty here for everyone - terror, gore, sex and nudity. It also manages to capture the essence of many films from the 70's or 80's. It's simply brilliant. But I will tell you that after watching this film, you will want to take a long hot shower. But to a true fan of these films, that could be the highest compliment possible. Don't wait. Just pick up a copy and prepare to be impressed. Hats off to Domiziano Cristopharo. He could be our next Argento or dare I say it.... Fulci. Now I want to see more of his work like MUSEUM OF WONDERS which is being released next. Keep 'em coming.",1329868800,12,838,4.412903225806452

8498807,5,B006IRQUF8,"House of Flesh Mannequins was so close to being rated XXX.  As much as I may say I wasn't interested, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It was fresh, provocative, and disturbing. The sex scenes, all artfully done, take you into the labyrinth of sin, a place very few would admit they had some curiousity about. Acting was phenomenal and creepy at the same time.",1394755200,2,362,4.402985074626866
8498808,4,B006IRQUF8,"Well this film has stages of horror that start as strange to just horror,it has a few parts in the end you don't see coming,so for me i thought it was good,the main female character is really hot. This film is not for everyone do its content but if you like extreme cinema this will work for you,overall a really cool newer style horror,its worth the money i am kinda surprised this movie is not more well known.",1377043200,3,412,4.294871794871795

8498810,4,B006IRQUF8,"Sebastian; loner, photographer, filmmaker who is also the landlord for a very strange building; combination dark carnival of flesh & lust along with nice, normal apartments.  Sarah Roeg; beautiful and innocent who quickly finds out she has a ""taste"" for the strange and bizarre after making friends with Sebastian, and is slowly lured into his sordid, sleazy world.

This film is best described as a raw, voyeuristic roller-coaster ride of extremely dark disturbing true horror. Definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. It is like a despicable immoral nightmare from which one cannot wake up. I have to admit, I could not watch this movie at night for fear of the images ""leaking"" into my subconscious and dreams.

What I absolutely LOVE however, are the extreme stark contrasts and imagery; the scenes are either deeply dark, or starkly white. Sebastian's apartment is almost glaringly white, antiseptic-like, which is a wonderful distinction of the two sides of him. One is innocence, while the other is far from it. In flashbacks, we see that Sebastian has been severely abused as a child, and he knows full well about pain, both physical and emotional.

This is a complete disconnect from everyday reality; exploring the most extreme seedy side of life complete with performance artists relishing in self-mutilation, extreme depraved sexual acts and even a bit of cannibalism. Not your typical gore/slasher-type movie by a long-shot, this is pure exploitation of the most twisted, deviant kind. Filmed with extraordinary finesse, the cinematography is haunting and beautiful! The music juxtaposes itself against the shocking visuals with combinations of an almost carnivalesque quality ending in an aria from the opera ""Pagliacci"", perfect for a tragic ending.

I have to say I LIKE it a lot. The only reason I don't love it, is that the content was so very disturbing. Although, as I write this, I believe one can be objective enough to separate the two; beautiful art-form from disturbing acts. And absolutely no censorship here; isn't that what true art is all about?
BRAVO Domiziano!!",1366070400,7,2103,5.137426900584796
8498811,2,B006IRQUF8,"The acting was an abomination (except for the female lead, to which I gave the two stars), the story was inane, and the vulgarity that it tried to convey came off as hilarious instead of shocking. This movie was a perfect example of what NOT to do in a film, and I swear that I have lost more than a few thousand brain cells from having watched it. Please, for all that is great in cinema, do yourself the favor and avoid this at all costs. It has no redeemable value, and you will be angry with yourself for having wasted close to two hours of your life to watching it. You have been warned.",1360108800,,592,4.156521739130435
8498812,2,B006IRQUF8,"I was looking for something a little different yet sexy.  There is hardcore sex in this movie, for less than a minute.  There is full frontal male & female bodies.  There are also amputees behind glass waiting for you to use them.  There are people actually suspended by hooks aka body suspension.  There is murder, plenty of blood & cannibalism.  Could've been zombies, but everyone was very much alive.  Seedy, underground clubs & mutilation.  This is not for the faint of heart, nor me.",1358208000,3,489,4.738095238095238
8498813,3,B006IRQUF8,"""House of Flesh Mannequins' is a joint Italo-American production combining an Italian director and leading man with a U.S. based setting and actors in, one would imagine, an attempt to gain better distribution access to the N. American market.  The result is intriquing, but a little clunky in its' execution. Intense fetishistic elements are displayed on screen within the context of a (purportedly 'based on a true story') plot that follows the 'romantic' connection that is made between an attractive young woman and a strange guy who lives in her apartment block. The story is, sort of, told from the perspective of the woman - as she gets sucked into the bizarre world of voyeuristic photography that her mysterious 'landlord'/neighbor is engrossed in.

There is a somewhat amateurish quality to parts of this film that detract from the 'suspension of disbelief' factor that cinema relies upon and the motivations and connections between characters is not handled all that smoothly - so that, on first viewing, it becomes a bit confusing as to: who is who and why they are doing what they're doing.  This may be a result of the cross-cultural challenges faced by the Italian director, or his naivete in the industry.  Regardless - the aspect of this film that has apparently attracted attention is the weirdness (and purported 'reality') of some of the bent fetish elements & the 'explicit' sex that are depicted.  The film is divided into 'chapters' and the one entitled 'House of Flesh Mannequins' introduces us (via the photographer character) to a strange place where individuals are, rather inexplicably, housed in small viewing rooms where their peculiarities and sexual practices may be 'observed' by 'outsiders'.  The sexual explicitness includes a lot of full nudity by both sexes, but most of the actual 'action' seems to focus on male erections & self satisfaction - shown in fleeting glimpses of quick cuts and 'artfully' dim lighting.  Though it is not overly clear in the film... there are ostensibly some 'snuff' scenes enacted within the 'House', and also shown in the 'movies' that the male protagonist has been filming  which are 'projected' within the larger film.  The principle characters are presented as if they are all 'working through' some intense personal past traumas - but the director doesn't manage to build much empathy or cohesion within the plot to hold it all together or make the viewer care much about the participants.

The 'extras' section on the disk actually provides the hardest hitting imagery - there is a 'bonus' segment devoted to the 'snuff' scenes where the 5 vignettes that depict such are presented in much greater detail and longevity than they appear within the film - providing the viewer with a lengthy look at penile mutilations and some pretty harrowing piercing scenarios - 'some' of which appear to be for real.  This film does present some very intense fetish images, in keeping with the tone of our modern times where such fare is apparently ever more acceptable to the mainstream - but its' success as an integrated piece of cinema is questionable.  Taken in the spirit of a sorta post-modern Grand Guignol it's a pretty entertaining watch - if you like this sort of twisted stuff... but I feel that the director needs a little more 'practice' before anyone starts equating him to another 'Argento' or the like.",1356998400,,3377,5.0
