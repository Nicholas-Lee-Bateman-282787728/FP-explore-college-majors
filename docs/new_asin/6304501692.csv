895893,5,6304501692,"What a fun last hurrah by most of the Monty Python guys, along with a young Steve Coogan, Nigel Planer, etc. Makeup and costumes and songs give it a solid feel and a really interesting and heartfelt retelling of Wind in the Willows. (Name changed for the DVD release due to some legal Disney stuff, but it's the same movie.)
Just be advised it might be too intense in a few spots for little ones.",1433116800,,396,4.293333333333333

895896,4,6304501692,My family loved watching this movie.,1405296000,,36,5.166666666666667
895897,5,6304501692,How did I live so long without knowing this existed?  Seriously? You've got Monty Python!  Disney!  Mr. Toad!  Visual jokes by having hoards of rabbits making out all over the place for no apparent reason except because it's funny!  Bizarre costumes! (apparently whiskers and ears on humans = animals)  So weird. So awesome. If you like any of those things- just get it.,1399507200,,370,4.7936507936507935
895898,3,6304501692,"silliest movie I've ever seen. I was expecting something a bit more . . . I dunno, had good actors and Monty Python alumni involved but was silly, only for 5 year olds.",1397433600,,168,4.121212121212121
895899,5,6304501692,I have enjoyed many of the Monty Python skits and movies over the years.  I was thrilled to learn that several of Monty Python actors had produced and starred in Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.  I purchased the VHS version in 1998 and a DVD version years later.  The acting is wonderful and the recurring themes (rabbits always in the process of reproducing - off camera) work very well.  Great fun for kids and adults who still enjoy well-made children's fare - Rocky & Bull Winkle and Pinky & the Brain come to mind.,1386633600,,508,4.43010752688172
895900,4,6304501692,"The Wind in the Willows rides again with Mr. Toad and his passion for autos. Great viewing for everyone, and provides a great reason to read or re-read the book.",1384819200,,161,4.4
895901,2,6304501692,"Based on previous reviews, I gave this movie a chance. Don't waste your time or money. Use your time to read the original story, The Wind in The Willows. This movie mutilated the fun adventures of the book. I can accept plot changes that retain the spirit of characters and their story. This movie does not. From the very beginning, the book's beautiful story is unrecognizable. Kenneth Grahame wrote Mr. Toad with no money concerns. This movie is all about Mr. Toad needing money. It goes downhill from there. This is the best the movie writers could come up with after reading The Wind in the Willows? Beyond awful plot changes from the book. No one in my house enjoyed this movie.",1383782400,,683,4.60655737704918
895902,5,6304501692,everything was perfect!!! My son and i loved watching the movie. It's an unforgettable classic. Will purchase others. Thank you.,1379289600,,128,5.45
895953,5,6304501692,This is a cute movie. I didn't know if I would like it but i do. It's different but cute.,1376092800,,89,3.5
895954,3,6304501692,"Although it was great seeing some of the cast of Monty Python's Flying Circus this movie stunk. Now, this is NOT the fault of the seller, they shipped this to me promptly and very good condition. It's just that the movie stunk-very dry humor and not worth the time.",1371427200,,265,4.428571428571429
895955,5,6304501692,"This movie is very cute and funny!  I know that we all went around the house saying ""the marvelous Mr. Toad"" for weeks afterward.",1359331200,,129,4.375
895956,5,6304501692,"Absolute perfection. They did not ham it up. They treated it with tenderness and respect, making it a joy for ages four to ninety four. I will watch it many times.",1357862400,,163,4.290322580645161
895957,5,6304501692,"If you love the book ""Wind in the Willows"", you will love this movie adaptation.  It's a fun movie for the whole family if your family likes a  bit of silly and absurd.  Eric Idle, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Steve Coogan of Monty Python fame are excellent.  My 46 yr old niece did not like the movie, but she does not care for English humor or Monty Python...so sad!",1357516800,,365,4.246376811594203
895958,4,6304501692,We enjoyed the movie and love the ride at the Disney park in Florida. This prompted us to get the movie.,1353283200,,104,4.0
895959,3,6304501692,"Disney knows talking animals, and ""Mr. Toad"" gives us memorable characters, a good story, neat special effects, pleasing music (with dance), expert execution, and an entertaining demonstration of the value of friendship.

Why only three stars?  Because my wife and I found it too heavily loaded with threats and violence (comic violence, to be sure).  But children of the age which loves to crash toy trucks into walls of blocks, may love it.

No, I haven't read the book.",1319155200,,472,4.936708860759493
895960,5,6304501692,"Wonderfully written by Terry Jones. Songs and dances are just as great! This really is the very best video of Mr. Toad's part of ""Wind in the Willows"".",1313107200,,151,4.428571428571429
895961,5,6304501692,A delight for all ages!  The Python people help too!  The weasels get their just desserts and toad flies off into the new era.,1299196800,,126,4.208333333333333
895962,2,6304501692,"The only good part in the movie is the villian song other then that,it stinks. I give this movie a 2 out of 10.",1271289600,,111,3.6666666666666665
895983,5,6304501692,I picked this up on a whim at the library and both our 5 year old and three year old loved it! We've now bought what can easily be considered a classic. Well done!,1190851200,,163,3.823529411764706
895984,5,6304501692,I enjoyed this movie and felt good after watching it.  Good for adults and children!,1142467200,,84,4.6
895985,5,6304501692,My grandson and I first watched this 5 yrs. ago then happened upon its being shown on BBC while in London this year and remembered how much we had enjoyed it.  I have just ordered it as Christmas presents for my other grandchildren.  The 2nd viewing was just as funny!  We were glued to the TV before we went out to sightsee!  It's wonderful!,1090540800,,342,4.296875
895986,5,6304501692,"This Terry Jones version of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride is a superbly well made film.  Enjoyable by both children and adults, my only regret is that it is not available on DVD.  This film is witty, charming and very imaginative.  Terry Jones excels as Toad with Eric Idle supporting him as Ratty.  Every child should see this version.",1019520000,,327,4.586206896551724
895987,4,6304501692,"I am not afraid to admit that I am an avid python fan. Been watching the stuff since... well, for more than just a few years, let's put it that way. Several years might be closer to the truth, though my parents would call that an understatement. I happened upon this film at a Monty Python fan site. As one of my goals happens to be to watch every Python-related film I can get my hands on, I went to the local hastings and rented it. I liked it. A lot. It was somewhat childish, but was not without its python influences (There is this one scene in which Mr. Toad is being led to jail and there are 2 guards punching each other in the background. If that's not Pythonesque, then I don't know what is). The songs were delightful, most of them anyway. I thought that altogether the whole thing was really creative. There are a few ""violent"" parts, such as fighting, and something having to do with a dog food factory that reminds me very much of Wallace & Gromit, but nothing that will lead your child to, say, becoming a Gang banger, or anything outrageous like that.",1005955200,,1067,4.313432835820896
895988,3,6304501692,"As I watched the movie, I had this feeling that I was watching Zooblie Zoo and Monty Python at the same time. The costumes were pretty bad, for example, Terry Jones was just painted green basically in his portrayal of Toad, and I kept thinking of his Python sketch, ""croonchy frogs"" whenever he appeared to do something really goofy, (like dance.)  The acting and special effects in it were great, however, and the movie kept pretty much to the original story line. When it was changed, it was done in such a way that it didn't hamper the plot. With it's semi-distracting over use of Monty Python characters, so-so songs, and poor costuming, I'd strongly suggest renting before buying.",988070400,,685,4.756302521008403
7873694,3,6304501692,"As both a Monty Python and a Disney fan, I enjoyed the movie.  It is fun and family friendly.  It is a shame that there is no bonus content.  What I did not like is the letterbox 4:3 aspect ratio (meaning there are black bars on all 4 sides).  The description on Amazon.com specifically listed the aspect ratio as 1.85:1.  Also as a product of Disney I expect better.",1524441600,,367,4.260869565217392

7873698,5,6304501692,"Such a cute, sweet movie. I don't know why I hadn't heard of this years ago. Not side-splitting hilarious, but fun and funny and gently sweet. Love to see the Monty Python lads in this.
