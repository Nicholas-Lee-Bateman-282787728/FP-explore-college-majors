484180,5,630245316X,"I also love THRILL OF A ROMANCE - my favourite Esther movie and hope the film will be part of the upcoming Box-Set (due out later this year from late information) - a long overdue second Collection.

And the great Lauritz MELCHIOR is certainly a bonus attraction with his beautiful singing voice a special treat.

A delightful and very romantic film - with lovely photography and location work and charming performances from Miss Williams as well as Van Johnson, who you know, or at least hope, will end up with her by the end of the film, despite doubtful odds.

THRILL OF A ROMANCE deserves renewed exposure.

And it certainly is a Special film if you like good old-fashioned down-to-earth entertainment.

Thanks Warners  - in anticipation.

484182,4,630245316X,"Just watched on TMC while ill. Expected romantic soap opera and to turn it off.  Instead was rewarded with great music: Tommy Dorsey AND opera and more, as well as fabulous Technicolor 40's fashion, cars, interiors, and kitsch, not to mention the stupendous Esther Williams' diving and pool scenes.  Also, great scenic outdoor shots of hiking in the high Rockies. Actually, came on web to find out where it was shot, and left this review. Better than expected. Actually this is a good intro to the opera-phobic to see how great and fun it can be in an updated, non-formal staging context.",1172966400,11,588,4.754901960784314
484183,5,630245316X,"Esther Williams and Van Johnson make a perfect romantic couple in this film, and realy shine in this film.  ""A Thrill of a Romance,"" has a great plot, and interesting people.  The songs and swim scenes with Esther are lovely as well.
It's a bout a young swimming teacher, named Cynthia who marries a buisness men after he shortly couts her and weds her, only to find that before the honeymoon, he leaves her for a buisness trip.  Trerribly lonely and sad, Cynthia cries on her balcony, and a young man who is in the military hears her cry, they meet, and have a romance, by the time her husband is ready to come back, they have fallen in love. It's a film well worth seeing.",1031011200,13,674,4.333333333333333

7827847,5,630245316X,"A FANTASTIC MOVIE... which I first seen as a young man in Hollywoods Golden Years the 1940 s.... so for I have managed to source  160 of these musicals, my wife & me, LOVE THEM....  were  in our 80th years... but films like this make you feel young again...

All these Musical STARS were dynamic personalities in real life: I am speaking from my experiences, I spent Forty years CHASING MOVIE STARS... as a living & hobby,
I visited very... very many of them out in California... and it was beyond my wildest dreams meeting them....

I eventually wrote a book about my experiences, entitled HIGHWAY TO HOLLYWOOD,
it contained 1200 photographs and 500 pages... all factual stories.

This was my tribute to them STARS who treated me as a STAR..",1328572800,,742,4.625954198473282
7827848,4,630245316X,"Wow, how do you get a flirtatious extramarital affair past the censors in 1945?  A big no-no, especially with their leading ladies and boy nextdoor leading men.  But they found a way to double-cancel the problem and love conquers all.

Esther Williams winds up abandoned on her honeymoon and keeps bumping into Van Johnson, who can't swim.  She's lovely, lonesome and feeling neglected.  Van is handsome, smitten and just back from being lost in action during the war.  With nothing else to do, she winds up teaching him how to swim.

The music from Tommy Dorsey's orchestra still sounds wonderful and vibrant, just what you'd want to hear in a beautiful hotel.  Opera singer Lauritz Melchior is perhaps a little off the wall in this piece, and a bit of a ham, but he has a Gerber Baby look about him as he tries to endure a strict diet.  Who goes to a first class hotel to go on a diet?  A hotel worker watches him like a hawk and even sits down and eats his food when he tries to cheat.  That part is a little silly, but you'll enjoy the stars, the swimming, the swing music and the sets.",1320537600,,1090,4.373134328358209
7827849,5,630245316X,"Beautiful swimming teacher Cynthia (Esther Williams) catches the eye of a wealthy businessman (Carleton G. Young) and it's all over. Soon they're wed and off on their honeymoon at an expensive hotel. But before things can really get started, he's called away on business and Cynthia is all alone.

It isn't long before she starts spending time with a decorated war hero (Van Johnson), teaching him to swim, eating meals with him, and taking long walks through the gorgeous landscape. And it isn't long before he confesses his love for her, and now Cynthia is stuck, a kiss-less bride in love with another man.

The chemistry between Williams and Johnson is perfect, and his heartfelt confession to her on the balcony will send chills up anyone's spine. They make a decent script into something really special.

There are several musical numbers performed by operatic star Lauritz Melchior to add a little something extra to the film.",1296172800,2,933,4.967948717948718
