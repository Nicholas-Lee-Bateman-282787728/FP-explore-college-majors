I am sure he does too but when 'teaching' he gets confused and misnames pieces. I understant that he just got mixed up but if he is teaching, that is distracting to say the least and confusing to the  newbe. In my opinion, he does not take teaching chess seriously. It seems to be an 'aside' to him...in my opinion.",1188259200,5,436,4.011494252873563
