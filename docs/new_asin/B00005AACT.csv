7935194,4,B00005AACT,"My 14 month old daughter LOVES this section of the tape and this has been her favorite thing to watch since she started watching videos.  All she has to do is hear ""funny lady's"" voice and she stops what she is doing to watch.  The rest of the video is entertaining as well (although I find the segment on finding rabbits boring).",1027296000,,330,4.306451612903226
7935195,3,B00005AACT,"My toddler liked the Teletubbies scenes in this video (a scene at the beginning involving each of the Teletubbies going through a big door was a total hit with him -- and I imagine that it would be with most toddlers who are obsessed with doors).  But the ""real people"" videos on this tape are not so great.  The first one involves kids looking for rabbits and is just kind of boring.  The second one involves an adult woman dressed up like a queen and putting on a show for some kids.  It's painful to watch and to listen to.",985564800,10,526,4.23
