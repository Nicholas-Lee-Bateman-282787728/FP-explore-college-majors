2885005,3,B000SIWH0U,"I know that's an odd title for a review of ""MacBeth"", but it's true -- this particular production really brought home to me that long, long after I am dead and gone, new generations of actors and directors will be ""doing their thing"" with the Bard.  That is strangely comforting - a sort of brush with eternity.  I like, for example, that modern adaptations such as this one allow the actors to use their own native speech patterns - in this case, Aussie accents.  I appreciate that not everyone is trying to sound as if they're from the British Midlands, whether they're Australians or Americans, or even Irish.

This productions is a very different vision of the play, set in a drug-infested Australian gangland.  MacBeth is a sort of evil, impish fellow with greasy hair, and his wife is a twisted cheerleader.  Both are quite young.  Some of the ""updates"" are interesting, as when MacBeth returns to consult with the witches (here played as a trio of vandal high school ""bad girls"") and finds himself hooking up for a pretty steamy threesome.  Hoo-yah!  You won't be seeing that action on American network TV - on cable, maybe.

I think it's interesting that so many ""modern"" adaptations of Shakespeare have armed their characters to the teeth with firearms (Luhrman's ""Romeo + Juliet"", the abominable Ethan Hawke ""Hamlet"", and this version of ""MacBeth"").  It sort of make me wonder if acting schools will even be teaching swordplay in the 21st century, or if classical actors will only learn how to jump out from behind a wall, blasting and grimacing. Or maybe the new generation of young directors has just had their heads so filled up with gunplay that they can't imagine any other kind of fight to the death.  I dunno.

Some of the supporting actors in this were quite good, including MacDuff, Lady MacDuff, and Malcolm.  The violence can get pretty intense -- no punches are pulled with Duncan's assassination, or with the deaths of Lady MacDuff and her son.

Good for a rent, I would say, but not something I'd buy.",1194998400,,2025,4.72934472934473
2885006,4,B000SIWH0U,"It is refreshing to rest assured that Shakespeare remains a viable writer and no matter how his plays are manipulated or 'updated' or altered or interpreted, his majesty of the English language remains intact and the impact of his ideas and words sustain even the most bizarre reconsiderations.  Such, for this viewer, is the case of MACBETH as condensed for the screen by writer/actress Victoria Hill and directed with intensity and sensitivity of communication by Geoffrey Wright.  The result may seem to be a bloody mad feud suggesting a majority of the teen driven films of today, but consider the source: imagining Shakespeare's MACBETH without the gore would mean the meat had been removed.

Transferred from Scotland to Melbourne, Australia, the well-known fight for kingship among the Scots is transposed to be the turf struggle for supremacy in the underworld gangland of Melbourne.  The script and the direction make this transposition work, using the original dialog from the play, placing it in the voices and bodies of an all-Australian cast, to the point that the allegiance of the actors as to place is far less important than the telling of a powerful tale of ambition.  Sam Worthington makes an enigmatic yet strong Macbeth, well paired by Victoria Hill as his conniving and ultimately mad wife Lady Macbeth: the two form a chemistry that serves the original intent of the author well.  The many characters who rise and fall in the wake of the ambition of Macbeth tend to blend a bit because of the condensation of the script, but Gary Sweet as the doomed Duncan, Steve Batoni as Banquo, and Lachy Hulme as Macduff are particularly fine. The three witches whose predictions drive the play here become nude seductresses and are well interpreted by Miranda Nation, Chloe Armstrong, and Kate Bell.

The battle scenes are appropriately gruesome and the musical score that accompanies this film is an odd mixture of rock and piano transcriptions of Beethoven symphony movements.  With the bracing cinematography by Will Gibson it all works well.  Unfortunately the Shakespearean language can become lost with the heavy Aussie accents and subtitles would have been helpful.  But if your television set has that subtitle option available, this small defect can be overcome.  Yes, it helps to know the original play well in order to fully appreciate the transposition, but the script and cast and director make a fine case for involving even the uninitiated  into the power of MACBETH.  Worth your time, this.  Grady Harp, October 07",1193529600,31,2542,5.05023923444976
2885007,5,B000SIWH0U,"I have taught this play 3xs a day for 15 years. It is no exaggeration to say that I consider it perfect. It contains Shakespeare's concisest expression of his insight into ambition, greed, remorse, emasculation, inevitability,and self-deception. The title character really does know better but he cannot help himself. Unlike many of the Bard's other great plays, this one achieves much of its tremendous power through its focus and economy, which brings me to Worthington's version. Naturally I went to see it in the theater, not knowing what to expect. I was blown away. For years I had pondered writing a contemporary version of the Scottish play but this movie beat me to it. I think everything about it works really well. My only criticism is that the famous ""Tomorrow"" speech is relegated to the end of the movie and it is shortened. This is the only choice I did not appreciate. Otherwise, this version may attract converts to what I think is the greatest play ever written. Finally, I am clear about one thing: this is a movie of a play. I don't expect the same things on the screen that I do in the theater.",1191283200,118,1115,4.66497461928934
2885008,2,B000SIWH0U,"Robbed of all it's innate majesty and poetic vision,set in contemporary times among  the Melbourne underworld and boiled down by writer Victoria Hill (who also plays Lady Macbeth) into a series of ""Kill Bill"" like bloody scenes, Sam Wright's ""Macbeth"" manages to turn Shakespeare's play into an Iambic Pentameter spoken episode of the ""Night Stalker.""
Sam Worthington gives us 100 ways to glower as Macbeth and the scene with the three witches (in this case not old, wizened hags but three bodacious young women) is laughable and audacious in its sheer lunacy.
""Macbeth"" is shot like a BMW commercial: all bright and shiny with glistening surfaces and most of the players are saddled with dyed black hair and tight leather clothing.
All of this would not matter one whit if director Wright had infused the mise en scene with some humor or more importantly some insight into what Shakespeare was after in his play.
By all means check this version out if only to compare it to the gorgeous Welles version or even the straightforward though poetic Polanski one. Just be forewarned: a huge amount of Scotch is required to get you through this particularly difficult experience.",1185494400,31,1173,4.9543147208121825
2885009,4,B000SIWH0U,"I prefer this as the modern interpretation. I have watched Patrick Stewart's version and find it actually more morbid and more bloody than necessary (that's going to sound weird compared to this movie, but it's true). This is a nice rendition with a gang war. Even if there is some gratuitous nudity (that means unnecessary, and it was).",1402704000,,337,4.827586206896552
2885010,5,B000SIWH0U,"This is a thrilling cinematic visualization of Shakespeare's bloodiest bag of tricks, starring a young Sam Worthington as one of the most compelling (and smoldering) Macbeths you'll ever see. The kick@ss director of ROMPER STOMPER (the awesome skinhead flick that made Russell Crow a star) romps through a goth-baroque criminal underworld in modern Melbourne and stomps Shakespeare's dialogue into spicy hot soundbites of toil and trouble. The witches are recast as naughty schoolgirls/ravers who use sex, nudity, blasphemy, and dreams of power to seduce young Macbeth into murder. Add one red hot housewife, several lines of coke, and our hero doesn't stand a chance. We've seen sexy Macbeths before (in Roman Polansky's brilliant 1971 version) and we've seen stylized adaptations as well (Orson Welles' Universal-style horror show and the PBS Eastern-bloc bunker/nightmare with Patrick Stewart) but it's never been done this cinematically, with so much pure visual energy (not to mention sound and fury). There are so many clever bits in this, like the disco smoke-machine seduction, the naked ""double, double"" cook-off, the invasion of Birnam Wood on wheels, etc.  My only complaint: The screenplay may be a bit too ruthless in transforming the play into a visual experience. The actors are so good, I wish I could have heard them say more of Shakespeare's transcendent language, especially the ""Tomorrow"" speech.  Even so, I'd say Geoffrey Wright's version is every bit as exciting and important as Welles' and Polansky's.

2885015,3,B000SIWH0U,"Excellent copy of Macbeth right down to the Chinese women with automatic weapons. In this version we are dealing with drug lords, kingpins, and rival gangs. What this movie tells me is that not everyone with a British accent can do Shakespeare. The film maintains the darkness and blood imagery associated with Macbeth.

About half way through the film I felt I was watching something on the order of ""What's Up Tiger Lily?"" The Macbeth dialouge stopped hitting on all cylinders with the production. I would have enjoyed the film better if I had English subtitles. The DVD didn't have that option.

2885016,4,B000SIWH0U,"I love Shakespeare and I really appreciate anyone who tries something innovative with his work.  Like Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, Wright sets MacBeth in modern day Australia among Mafia-type gangsters.  I was surprised how well that worked.  This time, however, the rivalry is internal.  Lady MacBeth's usual dominant role in all the slaughter is made more understandable, if not exactly sympathetic, by the fact that we see first thing that she has been driven a little nuts by the loss of her son. Then she goes completely over the edge, dragging MacBeth with her, after seeing the actual blood-soaked horror of the murder she's pushed him to do.
  Other highlights for me: Burnham Wood becomes a logging truck; the three witches, whether real or part of MacBeth's fevered brain, starting as school girls, becoming more and more seductive until they're succubi at the end; the 'Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow' speech given posthumously.
  Whenever Shakespeare is filmed there's always a lot left out and this film is no exception, being more highlights of MacBeth than the whole play.  But it worked perfectly well for me with a cast that was uniformly excellent.",1337990400,3,1172,5.0310880829015545
2885017,2,B000SIWH0U,"As a high school English teacher who uses this play with seniors, I was excited about the possiblities when it was released. I hoped it would do for Macbeth what Baz Luhrman did for Romeo & Juliet. The film is not without artifice. Showing Lady Macbeth mourning the death of a child in the opening scene, for instance, was clever. The production is imperiled right from start, however, by making Macbeth a key figure in a hipster drug cartel. He shows himself to be clever and ruthless in the initial blood bath. But how can he have a moral fall from grace when he is a violent, ruthless drug dealer? He cannot. It's not long before Macbeth is in a drug den of iniquity and depravity. It hardly seems suprising or abnormal that he would kill Duncan in this setting. In the actual play, regicide is despicable, even blasphemous. Thematically, there simply isn't enough preserved in this film.

Additionally, educators would be hard pressed to use this film in their classrooms. Everyone knows Macbeth is a violent play. But the drug use is extensive. What's more, the sex is WAY over the top. I initially thought that making the witches into high school vixens was clever. However, there are scenes in the film that digress into nothing less than soft porn, and border-line child pornography at that. It's gratuitous. It's needless.

Sam Worthington, the titular star, has managed to gravitate towards B list status since making this film. He's nothing special.

In the end, I cannot recommend Macbeth Australia.",1319155200,4,1511,4.826254826254826
2885018,1,B000SIWH0U,"THE GOOD NEWS: If you have been wanting to see a modern-dress Macbeth or you're a rabid fan of Sam Worthington, then this is the version for you!

THE BAD NEWS: Those are the ONLY reasons for buying this particular version of one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies. Here's why I think so:

1) Shakespeare's plays are one of the glories of the English language. While it's logical that, having taken a ""modernizing"" approach, this production has the actor's deliver their lines naturalistically -- that is, as prose -- most of them (in my view, Worthington included) do so badly. They rush through the speeches. (If you want to see how effective this can be when done well, check out the Broadway Theatre Archive version of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.) Making matters worse, this production's Duncan (Gary Sweet) delivers his lines as verse, destroying the illusion the production is attempting to create.

2)What helped Shakespeare's work survive during those first decades when they were no longer being performed is that he created great characters; thus his plays stayed alive in the study, if not on the stage. If your only knowledge of Lord and Lady Macbeth were from this production, you would be left with the impression that they were empty of much in the way of character and sank into their bloody ways because they were stoned all the time. Furthermore, if either actor here had any idea of creating an arc for their character, I can't detect it. Worthington seemed to be playing Macbeth as a simple-minded lunkhead and Victoria Hill seemed to view his Lady as a hysteric on coke. Their downward course came across as not only meaningless but utterly random.

3)On top of these problems, the whole production seems (to me) inconsistent and poorly worked out. Okay, having the three wierd sisters playes by girls in school uniforms is a nice touch; but then Macbeth addressing three nude and nubile women as ""hags"" seems just silly -- on the level of an SNL skit. And bringing Duncan's murder on-screen and turning it into a prolonged (literally) bloodbath puts the whole scene on the level of a grade Z slasher flick. Yes, I know Macbeth is steeped in horrors. But if you want to see this approach done well, try the supremely better DVD put out by the Folger Shakespeare Library. (And -- previous reviewers take note! -- you can even show it to your English classes.)",1307664000,5,2376,4.787804878048781
2885019,5,B000SIWH0U,"I have to admit that I came upon this particular version of Macbeth quite by accident.  I had a dear friend bring it over one night to watch since we both have a love of quirky interpretations of classical works.  I was half expecting a lame attempt to jump on the bandwagon, but I was most pleasantly surprised once the video started.  Sam Worthington (before Avatar) was dark and brooding, the whole cast was aptly cast and very believable.  I loved the Macbeth twist to almost a Mafia type ""King"", and this truly made the movie.  I think my friend described it best as The Godfather meets Shakespeare, because that is exactly what you get.  It's dark, it's violent and it's gripping.  The director captures the dark theme of the original play so wonderfully that you hardly realize they are speaking old English.  By 15 minutes you'll be so engrossed you won't want the story to end.  A wonderful adaptation, and you certainly won't waste your money.",1307232000,2,953,4.658682634730539
2885020,2,B000SIWH0U,"Anyone with the chutzpah to transform Scottish kinship wars to the Melbourne underground deserves a pat on the back.  To do this, however, the scriptwriters had to chop and move important parts of the text.  To make it modern, rock music plays behind the machine-gun scenes.  To make it sexy, the witches are transformed into nubile schoolgirls with unlimited libidos.  To give it gravitas, nearly all the male parts are played with sullen indifference, off-looks, and head nods.

Besides all this, there's the problem of understanding Australian English, with its flat A's; and keeping track of which actor is playing which character, or who just gunned down whom.

I found it amusing that Cawdor was transformed into a big rock club for druggies, of which Macbeth becomes thane.  There's no possibility of nobility in the Cawdor club......hmmm......it's hard to play Shakespearean tragedy with an anti-hero motif.",1280361600,,915,5.226027397260274

2885023,5,B000SIWH0U,"As someone who has read the play of Macbeth several times over the years, I appreciated it for it's work of art, but I must admit I always found it a little difficult to follow. Even though Macbeth is by far the easiest of the bard's plays to understand. But, after stumbling across this Geoffrey Wright gem, I finally get it! Now, I always knew the premise of the story, but I always found myself confused by the dialect, a 21st century girl lost in 17th century linguistics. Even with this film using Shakespeare's words (Aussie accents included), I completely understood everything being said and what Shakespeare meant by saying it.

Set in the underbelly of gangland Melbourne, you are introduced to Macbeth, played superbly by Sam Worthington, a cold-hearted sociopath on a quest for power and leadership among the cartel led by Duncan (Gary Sweet). By the enticing hallucinations of the three witches (no longer hags, but schoolgirls) and the encouragement of his drug addled Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill), Macbeth's quest for control within the family is a violent path of destruction that ultimately spirals into madness, revenge and death.

By far, this is the best modernization of a Shakesperian play. I was not a fan of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo & Juliet, nor Hamlet. The Hollywood, big budget spectacle never really did it for me. This film, however, left me thunderstruck. The acting was stellar, the cinematography was gritty, and the score was first rate. My only wish, was that it was longer. But I will stress that this is definitely not something to be viewed in a high school setting because of the drug use, explicit sexuality and extreme violence.

2885026,2,B000SIWH0U,"WARNING

******************* THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS  ****************

I like ""Macbeth"" the best of Shakespeare's plays, partially because at least I can understand it. I'm college educated but not an academic, and unfortunately, with Shakespeare I usually only get about half of what's being said. (I'm sorry; I'm not so up on my 17th Century allusions.) But the play ""Macbeth"" is swift, clear, comparatively short, and the piece's themes are within grasp. Also, if properly done, its scary...which is involving.

I like when Shakespeare's plays are transported into non-traditional settings...THAT WORK. Moving this particular play to a modern-day, drug cartel environment -- as this version does -- doesn't quite snap into place, however.

The main problem with this adaptation is its actors, all of who, I am sure, have been or will be effective in other roles. But if this play is about Macbeth, then it seems to me you should have a very strong personality playing that role. Sam Worthington is handsome-ish, which is always nice, but seems too placid and withdrawn. Even if this king needs prodding from his wife to seize the day, he's still supposed to be a hungry and driven type. Worthington is neither of those things. The characterization of Lady M laid out here doesn't serve Victoria Hill any better. First she's shown weeping at her dead son's grave, which is an interesting touch...but then how does that merge with her later (famous) claim that she's sooner dash that baby's brains out than break a promise to her husband? There is simply no dynamic between this couple that conveys a deep partnership or shared destiny. Or even a mutual, morbid greed.

Just about the only addition to this version I liked was that King Duncan is put up in a separate guest house on the Macbeth's property when he visits, which allows for some sneaking around in the dark, and explains why the other guests don't hear anything. But in an example of how this setting doesn't serve the text, since everyone else is killed with guns, why would Macbeth and his wife choose to stab their guest to death??? It just seems awkward. (And why does everyone think it's natural for Banquo's sons to turn into a long line of drug ""kings""; aren't most cartels wiped out before they become multi-generational?) Similarly, how can Macbeth repeatedly call the three witches ""hags"" when they're nubile centerfolds rolling around in bed with him? And how did all the gross ingredients get into Macbeth's kitchen for the ""Double double / Toil and trouble"" scene? It makes more sense if Macbeth travels to meet them on their own turf for that, as originally written. (There's also something more sinister and isolated about his having to travel into an otherworldly wasteland to see them.)

The final problem (which also crops up in Roman Polanski's FAR FAR superior version) is that many of the monologues are superimposed in voice-over while we watch closeups of the actors. There's something transporting and glorious about watching really well-trained actors dive into these speeches...but to watch a solemn face as the lines are recited on a separate track? Why bother?",1257120000,14,3161,4.998098859315589

Think of this as the Macbeth equivalent of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet, but without Luhrmann's visual sense of humor.

Yes, this Macbeth has its drawbacks, namely gratuitous nudity and an inexplicable orgy with Macbeth and the witches (I skip over these parts with my students).  Overall, though, this film captures the violence of the play in a more contemporary context and, through visual cues, actually provides plausible motivations for the characters (e.g. Lady Macbeth is a suicidal drug user after the death of a son).

2885032,3,B000SIWH0U,"And definately NOT worth $14.99 - more like $4.99...or maybe $7.99...

The concept was good, though not exactly fresh - other writers/directors/studios have attempted to modernize Shakespeare, with varying degrees of success, but most of the really great productions that I've watched (read: RSC or Judi Dench or Kenneth Branagh or Ian McKellan or Laurence Olivier or Orson Welles or Akira Kurosawa) tend to maintain a pre-technology feel to their story: 10th century Scotland, 15th century England, 16th Century Japan, 18th century Scandinavia - back when people actually tended to talk like that (except of course Scotland, and Japan - and probably Scandinavia, too)...basically before the advent of modern, Industrial English with it's truncated speech patterns and change in syntax...

If we're gonna ""modernize"" the story, especially post-World War II, then we might as well modernize the text and syntax to match - there's just too much of a disconnect between Queen E's Society (which lasted well into the 20th Century) and our own post-modern world of Industrially-Polluted Cynicism. Modern speech patterns in a modern world would create a much more interesting - and believable - film to watch...

Some of the re-interpretation actually did work - at the creative level...although the quality of acting and the style of editing tended to lessen the impact of creativity. I'll definately watch this version again, to see what can be translated into other contemporary versions - but only because I already bought it - and there's no sense letting 14.99 go to waste...

I found the physical action in this Macbeth too distracting to enjoy the artistry of the dialogue. In that respect, Romeo+Juliet did a much better job.
Also, be forewarned: there are no English subtitles for the hearing impaired available on this disc.",1207958400,,579,5.304347826086956

I have several versions of Mabeth; this is the most recent one. It's a modern retelling of Shakespeare's play using dialog from the original. Macbeth is trying to climb the drug lord ladder to the top.  I found it interesting, dramatic, imaginative, true to the ""message"" of the original. I enjoyed watching it and recommended it to some of my friends. However, it is not for anyone under 18 because of nudity, sex, and extreme violence. This is not for classroom use but a bit of fun for adults.",1200268800,2,627,5.741935483870968
2885037,5,B000SIWH0U,"I have seen some REALLY BAD contemporary adaptations of the Bard's works (the worst has to be the vomitous travesty ""Romeo & Julliet"" starring DiCaprio), but I must say that I was captivated from the very beginning of this great film.

The opening scene occurs in a graveyard, where the Three Witches are depicted as demented schoolgirls vandalizing the angels and crosses, and it is a powerful scene (as are the several other scenes in which they appear).  Miranda Nation, Chloe Armstrong, and Kate Bell really make this film outstanding.  Their acting is top notch, the photography is flawless, and kudos to the special fx team who created the sumptious layout for their potion's ingredients -- that was a very difficult set to create, and it looks magnificent.

All the actors did well, and this adaptation was really great.  One of the best films I've seen in recent years.  Highly recommended.",1200182400,,898,4.913907284768212

I did like the way the director made the three weird sisters prophecies figment of Macbeth s imagination. For that bit well done. Tuning the scene where Macbeth sets out to demand more information from the weird sisters in to a dream would have been a great scene to show my tenth gamers,  but it was a fantasy more in line with Calista so I couldn't.",1428796800,,438,4.329268292682927
