8012153,3,B0001FYPZA,"I was a little bit disappointed by this old British war film, especially considering that the topic was so interesting and full of possibilities. Below, more of my impressions with some SPOILERS.

""They who dare"" was made in 1954 and it was inspired by real war time actions of Special Boat Service (SBS) and Special Air Service (SAS) against German and Italian airfields in Greek islands and in Africa - the title is a variation of the SAS motto ""Who Dares Wins"". The scenario bases in large part on the real events, namely the operation ""Anglo"" (31 August - 18 September 1942), in which SBS attacked two airfields on Italian occupied island of Rhodes.

The purpose of this operation was to infiltrate into the airfields by night and destroy a maximum of airplanes, especially bombers, in order to ""thin the herd"" of Axis airforce, at a time when Rommel was making another effort to break allied lines in Egypt (Operation ""Brandung""). In the real history the attack, carried by eight British commandos and four Greek soldiers serving as guides and interpreters, was a success - but it was dearly paid. For the needs of the scenario the real events were however modified, so this film, although respecting some details, is NOT an exact re-telling of this operation.

The director clearly made some effort to give his film an air of realism. The film was partly shot in Cyprus, an island which mountains looks pretty much like those on Rhodes. Lebanese Air Force, which in 1954 still operated World War II vintage Italian bombers Savoia-Marchetti SM79 ""Sparviero"" (as transport planes) co-operated in this film and as a result we can see some fo those authenthic Axis bombers taking off, landing and also standing on the airfield the night of the attack. On another hand, the ""Italian"" armored vehicles we can see in this film are just old Bren Gun Carriers (retired from British Army soon after World War II) with some rather extravagant ""armor"" (wooden) added.

Actors did well in this film. Sir Dirk Bogarde was a great actor and simply couldn't deliver a bad performance, even if he wanted too, but others did fine too - I especially liked the performance of Denholm Elliott, an actor who would much later appear in two of the ""Indiana Jones"" movies as Dr. Marcus Brody.

The scenario however is of very unequal quality. Most of the film is too slow and finally devoided of great interest - dialogs are weak, not much happens and the supposedly well trained commandos act occasionally like clumsy morons. There are some attempts at crude humour, with the character of the commander of Greek submarine which will carry the commandos to Rhodes (in real history there were two submarines involved, British HMS ""Traveller"" and Greek ""Papanikolis""). He is portrayed as an obese, slovenly, aged wino, more the skipper of a coastal fishing boat than an officer... Frankly, even if I am not Greek (I am Polish) it didn't amuse me much - and if you want to have an idea how REAL Greek naval officers looked in this time, look up on the internet the real commander of ""Papanikolis"", Lieutenant Nikolas Roussen.

In fact, this film becomes REALLY good only in the last 25 minutes, AFTER the attack itself. I will not say here much about what happens during this time, but this is VERY GOOD cinema!

So bottom line, this is a rather average film, watchable, but no more - with the exception of the final part, which is a recommended viewing. But no matter its weaknesses, this film should appeal to all Dirk Bogarde's fans and also to most war films amateurs.",1372723200,,3550,4.753246753246753
8012154,1,B0001FYPZA,I can't review this product. The wrapper on the dvd stated that it was good for all dvd players. Unfortunately it wouldn't play on ours and the seller will not accept the return because the wrapper was off. I wouldn't buy from this seller.,1332374400,,239,4.454545454545454
8012155,4,B0001FYPZA,"""They Who Dare"" (1954, British, directed by Lewis Milestone) is a solid, intelligent, fact-based COMMANDO movie based on real events that took on the Grecian Dodecanese Islands. This methodical war drama clearly depicts with realism and honesty the assault by a handful of operatives on a heavily-armed German Luftwafe airbase located in Rhodes, Greece. Once the mission is under way, we are introduced to all four Special Boat Service commandos, two Royal Marines commandos, two Greek navy officers and two local guides. Dirk Bogarde portrays self-doubting Lieutenant Graham; Denholm Elliott, pessimistic Sergeant Corcoran; and Akim Tamiroff, a resolute Greek guide. Bogarde himself was a combat INTEL officer, serving with the British and Canadians during WWII. We have seasoned character actors hitting all pistons in this one, including the Greek women (one of whom goes beserk and starts ringing a church bell).

In this WWII film, you are on a submarine with a team of operatives; then you are delivered to an ocean or sea cove; you disembark and get into rafts; you row ashore, get on dry ground, and begin the climb up the mountain to caves and streams. You have a sense of mission direction right away. You are loaded up with guns, knives, back packs, binoculars, and explosive devices. It has all the makings of a gut-level ""seek out & destroy"" mission, and you know every step of the way - there is going to be hardship, risk, and danger. In the 'old school' sense, you are prepared for battle and welcome being shot at without being hit. You could watch this clean-cut movie with your grandson.

There was a tough side to this movie, as if most of the crew were combat veterans and knew how to project realism into the battle scenes. The commandoes assault the German airfield with precision and speed, and one soon learns that these men are trained hard to set explosives, high-tail it back under the barbed wire, and withstand the harsh treatment of their captors. The dialogue is crisp. Their emotions run ragged after Lt. Graham insists they dump out the water from their canteens to liften the load (thinking there would be stream over the mountain); there is no stream. They run out of water. Thus begins an uneven mission with mistakes aplenty - that somehow sets itself aright when the Luftwaffe presents itself in open temptation.

Strongly recommend this tense, unpredictable war film. It shows respect for the British, the Greeks, and the Germans. All classical unities are upheld. The crescendo runs true and straight through Acts I, II, and II.",1331424000,6,2569,4.94212962962963
