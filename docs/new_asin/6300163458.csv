7803336,3,6300163458,"Dreadful but strangely watchable slasher movie about a seemingly unstoppable killer who is the reincarnation of an Egyptian nature god.  He uses his powers to murder his wife while lying in a coma in a mental hospital and is determined to also sacrifice his baby son so he can continue to be the king of nature for another year.  Unfortunately a couple of teenage girls find the baby (next to the dying mother no less) but, instead of calling the cops, decide to ""keep him safe"" (the mom's last words) by pretending they are babysitting him and bringing him to a pre-graduation party being held by a handful of friends in a fancy house with glass walls.

Much of the baby subplot is eerily similar to Halloween 6, which Appointment With Fear producer Moustapha Akkad was involved with ten years later.  I guess he figured it might work better the second time.  Appointment With Fear ends up standing out, ultimately, for its strangeness.  The female heroine Carol (Michele Little from My Demon Lover) is likely the quirkiest lead of any 1980's slasher pic--her hobby is recording people from a distance with a parabolic microphone; she communicates with a boy she likes mostly in non-sequiturs and is surprisingly handy with semi-automatic weapons.  A philosophical homeless man named Charlie lives in the back of her pick-up truck.  There's also a completely without warning full-length new wave dance number involving characters who come out of nowhere and disappear just as quickly--because they're supernatural, apparently.

Appointment With Fear manages a couple of reasonably suspenseful scenes but is mostly just weird.  It's hard to tell how seriously a lot of this was intended or what the filmmakers thought they were doing during the stretches that feel more like they belong in a frothy teen comedy than a horror flick--one sequence involving the cutesy foreplay between Carol and her guy is sweet, but a suspense kill considering that it feels like a lost sequence from Valley Girl or The Last American Virgin.  The nudity and gore are, unfortunately, surprisingly tame for a 1980's horror movie, but the synth score is pretty much perfect.

There's no way I could honestly recommend this one, but you might end up having fun anyway--just go with the flow and enjoy the strange ride.",1447545600,,2296,4.966057441253263
