8621690,3,B00GB0OSV0,"Di Gi Charat has taken a sudden change to both realistic and older characters and made the show into a romance/drama story, rather than the usual gag-show it used to be. While the story holds up pretty well, the very limited running time (there's only a total of two episodes!?!?) makes some parts in the show seem rushed. The character's you used to know and love is gone, and they're acting a lot more like normal teenager girls would. It's hard to even think of these as Dejiko and Puchiko. Still, while cliche, the ending is fulfilling and the romantic scenes are extremely cute.

It's a fine set for fans of romance, but not really the direction we expected Di Gi Charat to go into. As with the original tv series dvd, there's none extras at all, which makes 50 minutes of running time pretty much unforgiving. It's still worth a shot if you enjoyed series like Clannad, Kanon or Air, just... even more compressed and with less breath taking animation.",1397692800,4,957,4.5964912280701755
