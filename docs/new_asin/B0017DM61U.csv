My copy was this 2006 Kung Fu Theater DVD version. Region Free. Basic Scene Selection. The quality is pretty low. The video looked like it was copied from a VHS with some tracking issues at the very top. The audio is painfully dubbed in English (A Good Thing?).

Don't expect a Bruce Lee film. It says it's starring Bruce LE, though I've read some sites claiming the clone isn't even in it. It tells the tale of the standard drug lords vs cops cliche & the plot is really easy to follow. The key to enjoying it is the action scenes. It's filled with plenty of them. There is a great 70's-style car chase at the beginning with exploding cars & ramping motorcycles. If you're watching with your mom it might get a little uncomfortable during the single sex scene (Full Boob). Then there is the shower fight scene where a guy is killed with a cloth towel dispenser, hands down the main reason to watch this movie.

If you are comfortable bundling the crappy video quality & no-name actors in with the 'experience' of an old kung fu film, grab a copy on the cheap. It's a fun 93 minutes.",1368921600,,1230,4.385964912280702
