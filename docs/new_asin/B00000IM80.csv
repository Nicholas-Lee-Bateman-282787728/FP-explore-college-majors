1223385,2,B00000IM80,"Well, the review before mine said it best. This is as old as i have ever felt. I am 25 and i am watching Crue on VH1. This whole show was horrible. It covered everything that we already knew. No new questions. No tough ones either. To sum it up. HIghlights: Finding out how Vince coped with the death of his daughter.(still very saddening to this day) Lowlights: The whole interview, and looking at Vince pushing about 250 lbs.",997056000,2,427,4.417721518987341
1223386,5,B00000IM80,This DVD is a must for any Cruehead out there.  This DVD has 10 extra minutes of the VH1 Behind The Music featuring Motley Crue.  Get it soon before it goes out of print.,978048000,2,170,3.9705882352941178
1223387,4,B00000IM80,"An excellent documentary on the history of Motley Crue.  The quality of the picture and sound is great.  The only thing I wish they had done was to remove the editing on this DVD.  In the U.S. apparently VH1 is a television  show or something, but I've never heard of it in Canada.  The editing  should have been fine for television, but on DVD, they could have removed  the beeps over the foul language and distortion over the nudity.
Other  than that this is the DVD to get if you are a Crue fan, or interested in  the history of 80/90's metal/rock bands.
This is not a hype DVD like  Uncensored or anything like that.  This seriously follows the life of the  members of Motley Crue.  Each member had a great story to tell.  Vince  Neil's daughter & car accident, the celebrity marriages, drug  overdoses, arrests, it's all here, and told honestly.",956707200,12,850,4.493421052631579
1223388,5,B00000IM80,"Anyone whose seen the VH1 Crue special and liked it, especially Crue fans will gallop over this.  The DVD version comes with about 10 minutes extra footage and the video from their Hits CD, the song Enslaved.  The only  disappointment is no footage or interview with John Corabi.  DVD's usually  add a mess of unreleased material that is not included for VHS, and it  would have been great to seen anything on John Corabi.  But this will do,  this is the best VH1 BTM available right now for metal, in fact I believe  it's the only one.",948240000,8,536,4.443298969072165
1223389,5,B00000IM80,"This is a Motley fan's dream come true. You get to see everything from when it was on TV with no commercials, plus extra footage. And as an added bonus, we get a video for ""Enslaved"". The only downfall to this  DVD is that it is censored. You hear none of the swearing. You would think  they would keep that in there. But hey, it's Motley and who cares. They do  need to release that video collection DVD!  But anyway, I highly recommend  this DVD.",948240000,6,448,4.223529411764706
1223390,5,B00000IM80,"It appears that Amazon.com has linked the description of the highly anticipated Video Hits Collection with this Behind the Music Edition. This is the DVD version of the Motley Crue: VH1 Behind The Music (with  additional footage). It includes one music video - Motley Crue's single  ""Enslaved"". As mentioned above this DVD title has additional  footage, scene access, a music video, discography, and interactive menu.  The running time of this DVD is 65 Minutes.  The video transcription to DVD  is very good.  Remember however, that you're dealing with some older video  footage of varying quality here. The video quality of the music video is  comperable to that of a hand held camcorder. It looks like bootleg concert  footage, but hey it's art! It's supposed to look that way! The interview  segments with Nikki, Tommy, Vince, Mick and other music industry people, on  the other hand are very sharp, crisp and focused - especially the Sixx  interview footage. This is my favorite ""Behind the Music"" episode  - and it's even better without the commercials and narative redundancy (if  you've seen the show you know what I mean). If you love the Crue, I highly  recommend it. If you are just learning about the Crue, this should be  ""required reading material""!",945820800,23,1263,4.966507177033493
1223391,4,B00000IM80,"This Video documentary is in very typical VH1 form. The only difference is that this is not your typical VH1 band. (Does it make anyone else feel old seeing the Crue on VH1?) This Documentary covers everything from a  backstage perspective, and really dives into the guts and backbone of our  favorite Bad Boys. From Drugs and Booze, To Sex and Strippers, Car chases  and Car wrecks, this documentary leaves no doors unopened...Oh yeah and  then there's the Music. A must see for all Crue Fans!! Crue Fans are the  best, Flock the rest! Also watch for the Motley's Ampitheatre world tour  this summer and their autobiography book, and live album this fall.",935539200,35,656,4.761061946902655
1223422,5,B00000IM80,I love this VHS! It's so wonderful. It's everything I imagined and more! Any Cruehead would love to add this to their motley collection. It goes through motley's career up until the 2000s.,1341014400,,188,4.7272727272727275
1223423,5,B00000IM80,I think this was an excellent video. You learn so much about them individually & as a band. Motley Crue is my favorite band and anything I can watch on them I love.,1173744000,,164,4.0
1223424,1,B00000IM80,"Really revolting.  The show goes on and on about their excesses, casually sidestepping the fact that their actual songs are awful.

They try to pass off their obnoxious behavior as rebellious, when in actuallity its pathetic.  Doing stupid stunts against the ""establishment"" is as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.  Ask Madonna.

My favorite is Nikki Sixx, who is quite fond of referring to himself in the third person. If he ever drops dead again, I hope he gets it right this time. ;)",1169164800,,487,4.682352941176471
1223425,5,B00000IM80,The only band i respect as much as Motley is Pantera. For different reasons. These guys pretty much are everything id never want to be and i love them for it. Total chaos! They reinvented american excess. Everyone else just followed. MOTLEY is ROCK n ROLL.,1148860800,3,256,4.586956521739131
1223426,4,B00000IM80,"Over the years,with Motley Crue being one of America's most succesful and influential rock bands,as well as being so infamous,it has been great to learn more about The Crue--and VH1's ""Behind The Music"" special on Motley Crue proves just that.

The documentary that is on this DVD is not perfect,and it is a little slow at times,but other than that,it is really good. You get to learn a little bit about Nikki Sixx,Tommy Lee,Mick Mars,and Vince Neil as individuals and see really good pictures of Sixx,Lee,Mars,and Neil from when they were young and before they were in Motley Crue(there is also really good video footage of both Nikki and Tommy from when both Nikki and Tommy were young)and all of Motley Crue's career from when Motley started out up until the late 90's (which is when this documentary was made)is covered here. You get to learn about pretty much everything that Motley Crue band members did that proved to be controversial here,and while I shouldn't give away everything and let you see this DVD for yourself,all of the footage of Motley Crue from most of Motley's career that is here,as well as the really good,entertaining,and in-depth interviews with Nikki Sixx,Tommy Lee,Mick Mars,and Vince Neil--make this one of the best Motley Crue DVDS you will find anywhere.

Don't forget to purchase this DVD,and let me add that ""The Dirt"",the autobiography of Motley Crue,is worth purchasing with this DVD right at the same time(yes,you can find ""The Dirt"" right here off of Amazon as well).",1140220800,2,1505,4.944664031620554

1223428,5,B00000IM80,"I've watched this DVD about 5x and this is one of the greatest Behind The Music episodes I have ever seen. Motley Crue takes for a ride on the wild side and tells you everything from the beginning of their lives through the early days of the band all the way up to 1999. They tell you secrets that no fan would ever think was possible. This band did it all, went through it all and lived it all. In addition to buying the DVD, the Crue's tellall book, ""The Dirt"" should be the next thing to buy from the Crue. The DVD and movie prove why Motley Crue was the most notorious rock and roll band to ever walk the earth. This DVD made me a Motley Crue fanatic. These guys are the greatest.

Long live, MOTLEY CRUE!",1092960000,10,709,4.100719424460432
1223429,5,B00000IM80,This dvd from Vh1 is killer! it tackles every angle of the crue and touches on things with them that most bands would never admit to. a very good watch!,1060128000,3,152,4.1
1223430,5,B00000IM80,"This has got to be the most entertaining and emotional of all the VH1 Behind the Music Specials.  I must have seen this thing half a dozen times already on VH1, but any real Mutly fan has to actually own it.  It just makes the whole vibe complete.
If you haven't seen it yet, you are really missing out.  There was good reason why they had album titles like ""Theatre of Pain"" and ""Decade of Decadence"". There music was always about the fast lifestyle, but they didn't write about the half of it! The video is intense, showing the guys looking back on all the craziness over the years - half reminiscing, half regretting it all.  But thats how it happended, and it really shines new light on the music itself. Everytime I re-watch the dvd, I find some new angle of the Crue that I never saw before - especially when i'm reading their lyrics and matching it up with the stuff going on in their lives at the time.  But seeing Vince Neil during his ""rubenesque"" stage is just plain sad.",1052438400,3,982,4.344262295081967
1223431,5,B00000IM80,"Have you every wondered what went on behind the scenes with America's favorite ""Bad Boys"" band Motley Crue?  Well wonder no more Hip-O Records has taken care of that question with ""Behind The Music"" a VH1 Music First.  Nikki Sixx, Tommy Lee, Mick Mars and Vince Neil tell all when this raw holds not barred DVD unfolds from start to finish.  They've been called rock 'n' rolls most dangerous band and in some cases the baddest plus raunchiest ~ well maybe so, but don't judge them too harshly ~ just sit back open your favorite beverage and soak up this once-in-a-lifetime look at the hottest musicians from the '80s ever to step up before the footlights.  A rare glimpse into the past with Crue fans enjoying this media that was called a ""circus"" ~ plus the inclusive music video for ""ENSLAVED"", this is a keeper to be viewed over and over again.

7910856,5,B00000IM80,"I remember watching this on VH1 around 1999 when it came out.  I bought the VHS tape a short time later.  This is a VH1 Behind The Music documentary on the infamous hard rock band Motley Crue.  The four members of the Crue talk openly and honestly about everything from the band's humble beginnings to their ups and downs through the years.  These guys don't hold anything back.  They just tell it like it is.  Lots of bleeped out words.  This DVD contains additional footage not shown on the version that aired on VH1.  This band has always gone full throttle in everything they do, and the result is lots of crazy stories to tell.  The members share comical stories, tragic stories, and of course lots of stories of their legendary partying days.

For those of you who are Crueheads, this is a must-see documentary.",1364601600,3,817,4.572413793103448
