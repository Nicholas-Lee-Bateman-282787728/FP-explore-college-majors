7842956,5,6303283810,"I own the Video Cycle Switzerland tape and just loved it.  My husband and I sat down and actually watched it the first time we played it.  The scenery is immediately in your face and you really feel as though you are there. If they could get the scent of the flowers and mountain air included it would be bliss.  I kind of wish they would just use nature sounds instead of music, but the music is probably more universally appreciated.  I like the hills and the 'group ride' you get half way thru the tape.  I ride my own bike on a trainer when it is too nasty or too late to go riding. After a while you feel as though you can actually 'feel ' the hills and change gears on your own.  No one tells you to change your gears.  If Spinervals and Video Cycle ever got together ..they could make one heck of a work out training video. !!",976838400,21,833,4.07361963190184
