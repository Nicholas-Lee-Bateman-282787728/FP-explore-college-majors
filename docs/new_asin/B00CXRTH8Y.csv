5751631,5,B00CXRTH8Y,This is my all time favorite anime!  It has it all!  It will make you laugh out loud and cry like a baby!  It is very hard to find so get your copy before they are all gone!!,1376611200,,174,3.526315789473684
5751632,5,B00CXRTH8Y,"I first saw this anime on a fan subs site, and fell in love with it immediately.  It's funny, well drawn, the characters are very interesting, it has it all.  If I was to knock it about anything....it's a little to short with episodes. The manga has 17 books, so there was enough material to make more episodes, but I guess they wanted you to buy the books instead.

And, I wish it was in English...Don't get me wrong!!!  The Japanese actors did a wonderful (REPEAT WONDERFUL!!)  job with the voices. It just at times, I leave my TV on while I'm in another room doing things so I can still here the shows....but, because I don't know any Japanese I can't do it with this DVD.

Other than that, This anime is so worth the buy, and I guarantee ""YOU WILL LAUGH YOUR HEAD OFF!!!!""",1376524800,12,776,4.280821917808219
5751633,5,B00CXRTH8Y,"I saw this dvd on Youtube. I enjoy the story. It is  about 2 high school kids in there last high school year.  It has twist and turn in the story.
It also funny to watch.",1376265600,,170,3.6944444444444446
5751634,5,B00CXRTH8Y,"This is laugh out loud anime at its best.  The characters are funny and can make you want to be around them in real life.  I never write reviews, but I couldn't help but want to suggest this excellent series to anyone looking for anime that has a great script and wonderful characters.",1373760000,,285,4.3584905660377355
5751635,5,B00CXRTH8Y,"Lovely Complex is a romantic comedy that is mainly focused on two people: Risa Koizumi, a teenage girl who's taller than most girls and swears that she will never fall in love with a guy who's shorter than her, and Atsushi Otani, a teenage boy who's shorter than most boys and doesn't want a tall girlfriend who reminds him just how short he is. The two are thrown together by their teacher to be the class reps since their teacher thought it would be funny to put a tall girl and a short boy together. They become a comedy duo who constantly bicker and get laughed at by their classmates. Even though they have their differences, the two find that they share some interests and start to become good friends. The comedy duo will later encounter many problems together. The start of their problems will be mixed feelings and misunderstandings.

Lovely Complex is the first shojo anime that I ever finished watching and it is also one of my favorite shojo animes. What I like about Lovely Complex is that it's funny, dramatic, and heartwarming. The faces that the characters make and the things they do are really hilarious! All the characters in Lovely Complex are likable, even the ones that are supposed to be enemies. Like many shojo animes, Lovely Complex has it's serious moments. One thing I really like about Lovely Complex is that there is a nice balance of comedy and drama. Since Lovely Complex follows the characters throughout their high school years, you get to see the characters go through changes. You also get to watch the bond between Risa and Otani strengthen and turn into something wonderful. Besides the main couple's relationship, you also get to see two other couples in the series: the spunky Nobu and sporty Nakao as well as the studious Chiharu and shy Suzuki. What I find heartwarming about this anime are those little moments between the couples that project just how much they like each other. I especially like at the start of the series when you could see the warmth that Risa and Otani have for each other during those little moments even before they realize their special feelings.

I would recommend Lovely Complex to anyone who wants to watch a sweet romantic comedy with themes of accepting yourself, friendship, and growing up. I'd also like to mention that Lovely Complex is a 24 episode anime and it is also a manga with 17 volumes and a 1 volume spin-off manga. Also, Lovely Complex has a live action spin-off movie. The movie sometimes strays from the actual plot, but it's just as funny and sweet as the original anime and manga.",1372464000,22,2571,4.685840707964601

5751639,4,B00CXRTH8Y,"A wonderful series, I highly recommend it for anyone who likes good slice of life romantic comedies. in a scale of 1 to 10 this series is 9.7

The only downside of this collection is the font of the subtitles - it's bad - Bad. and there is no good reason why except for laziness, - that's the only reason I didn't give this collection 5 stars.

+ in the subtitles they decided not to include the -kun/chan suffixes, which I didn't like and they made some creative choices in the translation itself, which for the most part I didn't mind",1457049600,2,536,4.297029702970297

5751641,4,B00CXRTH8Y,This is a very old Japanese anime about a short oblivious boy and a tall girl who loves him...  They are alike everyone in school call them the comedy duo.  The animation is cruder than current releases and is presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio.  The story is pretty funny as the everyone tries to tell the boy that the girl loves him but he is totally lost in that fact.,1444780800,,368,4.154929577464789

5751649,5,B00CXRTH8Y,"What a great show.  My husband and I both loved it, which tells you something about the quality, since my husband is not normally into shojo anime!  We've rewatched several episodes as well.

The main characters are both really likable.  Of all the anime shows I've watched, this is the only one where I could see the couple actually being happy together long-term.  The story is hilarious, but you still really feel for the characters and identify with them.",1418947200,,459,4.7594936708860756

5751652,5,B00CXRTH8Y,"I absolutely adore this series. It is so charming. I do find on re-watching it that Otani is bit of a black box for me. Why exactly is he so reluctant to go out with her? But then again, there you go, he is a boy! Of course he acts nuts, don't try to figure it out Risa Koizumi (, lit. meaning ""little spring)  just keep going and true love will maybe be even enough to overcome the great disparities in your height.

Ah, I love the heroine, I love it when she just picks him up and says ""but he fits perfectly into my arms"" carries him to the gym and declares ""I have feelings for Otani!"" Yeah! The course of true love never did run smooth and what with all he puts you through you should get a Care Bear Medal for great perseverance through the power your love.

And of course you two doing your stereo in unison angry tirades at each other had me confident despite the baffling nature of Otani's behaviour that you had each found the other two whom the red string of fate was connected. (Can't believe they didn't draw that in) You know I am actually going to watch this a third time I love this series that much.",1408579200,2,1116,4.1336405529953915
5751653,5,B00CXRTH8Y,super fun love story about tall girl and short boy. super anime.,1407110400,,64,4.416666666666667
5751654,4,B00CXRTH8Y,"My expectations were high for this boxset when I saw it up for sale, and largely, I was not disappointed. The picture and sound quality are amazing. The anime, itself, of course, is beyond funny and adorable. The anime, is all around, five stars in my mind and absolutely perfect.

I do have a couple cons, however, which led me to give this product only four stars, reluctantly (the picture and sound quality really are amazing). First of all, the boxset arrived with three of the four discs loose within the box, which meant they got scratched repeatedly by the DVD holder, unfortunately. Thankfully, after wiping the discs off a couple of times (even though the scratches remained), the discs played through just fine.

The translation for this boxset was confusing. For example, if a certain statement was said a couple of times, it was sometimes translated different, especially with insults. At other times, if the characters clearly said something completely different, the delivered translation repeated the phrase used directly before. This only happened a few times, but became more glaring once I noticed it.

More importantly, for parents, the translation was more vulgar than necessary as well, utilizing curse words that aren't actually being used by the characters. I'm no Japanese Major, but I was able to notice it when the translation for stupid/moron (kansai dialect), was translated in a few parts as stupid/moron, and then translated into the ""A-word"" in one of the episodes. Their arbitrary/incorrect translating was a bit irritating, and I would never want my kids to watch this innocent anime, with these kinds of translations.",1406851200,13,1651,5.107407407407408

5751665,5,B00CXRTH8Y,"Product Review:
The product arrived safely, no scratch on the discs. The casing was undamaged and sealed and the artwork on the casing was very nice and coloured beautifully, though I preferred the plastic casing to be a clear white plastic casing rather than a black plastic casing. Overall, it was great and careful delivery; no scratches on the discs, wonderful artwork on the casing, great for fans to buy!

Anime Review:
Graphics and visual arts;
The graphics were great, nothing special, as this Anime is not the action-type Anime so there are no explosion and etc. Lovely Complex is a `slice of life', `Romantic-comedy', `coming of age' Anime. But the art works were great and it was brightly coloured

Story;
The story was amazing! It was new and unique! There is no Anime that has the same story concept as this one, people could really relate to the story. For those who haven't seen Lovely Complex, it would be a fresh breeze of newness. It's humorous but gives us the right amount of drama to make us sympathise with the characters. It has a great flow of development throughout the Anime. A novel story which will remain amazing for a long time.

Character and Personalities;
The characters were finely made. Their personalities were solid and understandable. People can actually relate to them, especially Koizumi and Otani. It captures the essence of our emotions when we are in the same situation.  The characters had humorous personalities too but give us enough scenes to understand their intense and sensitive side. Their emotions and feelings progress through the Anime which makes viewers hooked to continue watching. Finely made characters with great personalities!

Overall Review;
Lovely Complex is an undiscovered gem, an unpolished diamond that not many people have seen. It is one of those few Anime that'll make you cry, but for all the good reasons. Lovely Complex deserves more appreciation than it already has. It may not have the outstanding drawings and artworks, but it have something more in it than meets the eye. It's not about the glam of the graphics of the Anime, but it's about the sheer beauty of what it brings to the audience, emotionally and intellectually. Not many Anime can do that, but Lovely Complex has done just that. We might have predicted what happened in the Anime, but it's not about what happens in it but about how it happened. I'll absolutely recommend Lovely Complex. I'm proud to give it a total of 4.88 stars; estimate 5 stars.
Support my reviews!!!",1377043200,5,2512,4.887323943661972
5751666,5,B00CXRTH8Y,"Besides the fact that the series itself is phenomenal, the discs were all in great condition and the translation could be easily understood. It's noticeable, but forgivable, that the translations use Ms. Mrs. and Mr. to replace words like sensei, sempai and other Japanese honorifics. They use this part of translating rather loosely in order to try and convey to an English speaking person what it means in Japanese, and for their part, they do a fine job of it. All of the episodes were there and both the picture and sound quality were exceptional. Although there are no special features, it is still a great DVD set for anyone looking for the entire Lovely Complex series.",1376784000,,676,4.786324786324786

8587342,5,B00CXRTH8Y,"One of the funniest and touching anime series made.  Tall girl Risa and short boy Otani do make a wonderful comedy team as they do hilariously bicker and argue in front of their classmates and close friends and find common ground and mutual interests, particularly the music of the hip hop ""Umibozu"".  When Risa tries to express her true feelings towards Otani when she is moved by the feelings Otani shows to her, it would take some effort for Risa to make Otani take jokey Risa's feelings seriously.  On the other hand, while Otani finds himself being attracted to Risa, it would take some convincing on Otani's end to get over the sensitive issue of Risa's height difference and personailty conflicts (Otani is cool and serious while Risa is a class clown) with him and accept her as a serious girlfriend.  On the sidelines are best friends Nobu and Nakao who try to motivate Risa and Otani to accept each other with mixed results.

One season of 24 episodes probably is not enough to add more romance or conflict to the relationship...but it is enough to tell the story well in funny and touching terms.",1471824000,,1107,4.656410256410257
8587343,4,B00CXRTH8Y,"The DVDs were in excellent condition and has all the episodes! It's sold at a great price too. This is a cute anime about the challenges friends face when they fall for each other despite their height differences and the stereotype of boys should be taller than girls. It has a lot of humor and the right amount of romance. Some of the plot can be a bit ridiculous and not recommended actions in real life, but just let yourself sink into the anime world and you can enjoy it :)",1471219200,,478,4.263736263736264
