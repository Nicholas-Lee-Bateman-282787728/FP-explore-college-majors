8613800,1,B00FAJZX8A,"It's not that I hated it, it's just that I REALLY didn't like it. The first 5 minutes are a clear indication of what boundaries this film is willing to push when it comes to the values most Bollywood seems to hold dear. Apart from a few touching moments and the sweet story of best friends supporting each other, this movie revolved heavily around lust in its different forms, all about the bodies of both men and women. While some of the music was catchy and it was funny at times (like seeing the actor, himself, Abhishek Bachchan, trying to act gay), it was far from what I expected. When I hoped for a fun rom-com of Bollywood for the night, with sweet relationships and comedic scenes, I ended up with an okay idea, filmed for the shock-factor, making me uncomfortable for a good portion of the movie. Especially with the heavy stress of lusting after someone's body in swimsuits and tiny clothes (it's set in Miami, if that gives you any kind of indication)? Far from the Bollywood norm, it just really wasn't for me.

Would I watch it again? Absolutely not. But hey. Maybe you're looking for a raunch-ier Bollywood all about the bodies, this time. I just want others to know what they are getting themselves into.",1485302400,,1220,4.545454545454546

8613806,5,B00FAJZX8A,Im a huge fan of bollywood movies. Dhoom 3 actually led me to this movie. I enjoyed every bit of it. It was very humorous the songs are enjoyable and you can dance to them. The script is not something you come across constantly especially in bollywood films. Plus the actors were gorgeous in their own way. I love it.,1474070400,,317,4.3

8613808,2,B00FAJZX8A,"Beyond the glitz and glamour aspect, this movie is a somewhat inane comedy drama. However, what's more disturbing is that in many places, the script appears to poke fun at, ridicule or demean homosexuality as eccentric or abnormal. Avoidable unless you are really desperate to watch an Abhishek movie....",1468022400,2,304,5.224489795918367
