817486,4,6304197950,"Knopfler plays and sings a few ""Dire Straits"" favorites such as ""Sultans of Swing"" and ""Money for Nothing"" but most of the video consists of songs from his solo album ""Golden Heart.""

""Golden Heart"" has a lot of Celtic influenced songs, a couple of tunes with Cajun beats, a bit of country, and even one song, ""Rudiger,"" that has almost a cocktail-lounge quality to it.  I especially enjoyed the two Cajun numbers, ""Cannibals"" and ""Je Suis Desole"" which feature visiting slide guitarist Sonny Landreth.  Knopfler and Landreth's duel with their guitars is pure enjoyment.  All in all, a fine demonstration of fine musicians making good music.

My reservations on the Video are two.  Knopfler has mostly abandoned his favorite Fender Stratocaster in favor of a different guitar and consequently the clear sharp sound that make his rock tunes a joy to listen to is not much in evidence.  Secondly, I like videos in which the crowd is part of the show and in this one the crowd is only background scenery.  Rock needs more of a sense of excitement than this video brings too it.",1091750400,,1074,4.767567567567568
817487,5,6304197950,"Well, I like the third act: that's part of Knopfler's appeal is his interest in folk music and instrumentation, but with a modern bent. My only complaint is he sometimes forgets where the mic is (during intros and the like) and the person responsible for mixing the audio for this VHS saw fit to keep the level of Mark's vocals too low. Maybe MK doesn't like his vocal efforts, but we do and it's a shame that the sound engineer didn't attempt to find a better balance. BUT, we love his music and this is an excellent video nonetheless. Just wish I could have purchased it in DVD format....",1074038400,4,590,4.422018348623853
817488,5,6304197950,"He's the soul of 'Dire Straits', and he's the best guitarist of the world.
If you only like 'exaggerated' and 'exciting' performance--don't bother to be one of Mark's fans--he's too good to be your cup of tea; but if you like real musicianship, there's no reason why you don't like him!
I've been waiting for this show to be released on DVD, but I just couldn't resist buying this, even it is only on VHS.
The songs Mark played mainly come from the ""Golden Heart' CD, and still almost every song from this CD worth listening; other songs played, which include Mark's Dire Straits' era and his soundtrack works are excellent too.
Still, I look forward to seeing that all Mark as well as Dire Straits' materials to be released on DVDs!",1031702400,2,733,4.5606060606060606
817489,5,6304197950,"The backbone of Dire Straits is fully exposed in this very intimate and well edited video of Mark Knopfler live in London. It's not the MTV rapid fire editing style, instead the pace follows the colorful and amazing complex artistry of Mark Knopfler and the volumes of musical originality he somehow stores in his head and brilliantly funnels through his guitar and voice.
This cat can play that guitar. His precision and delivery is razor sharp, his vocals are husky and full of mood, and the wide range of musicians he has surrounded himself with are the cream of the crop. The third act slows a bit, the bouzouki, pipes and whistle and can lull one into a light comfortable nod, but before you start to snore Mark rips open a classic Straits tune to fire things back up.
I'd put this in the classics vault, a must have.",1005609600,52,822,4.523489932885906

I am very pleased with this purchase. I bought this VHS simply because DVD version is much shorter and didn't include some of the best Dire Straits songs, like Sultans Of Swing, and I am more than satisfied.
The item was exactly as it was described. BRAND NEW AND UNPACKAGED.
Dispatch was very quick and item arrived very much on time.
VHS cassette is brand new and sound and picture quality is just great. If You have a working NTSC Hi-Fi VHS recorder/player at home, I certainly recommend You to buy this VHS release, because it just magic. I also have DVD version of this concert and DVD version has Dolby Digital 192kbps 48kHz stereo audio track. This Hi-Fi VHS cassette has Hi-Fi ANALOGUE stereo audio track, which has the same audio quality as DIGITAL 1536kbps 48kHz LPCM stereo audio track, so, the sound on this cassette is actually better than the one on the DVD version. If You love Mkonpfler and DStraits music, You simply must buy this VHS.
I hope this review helps You.

Leaving 30 minutes of material out of the DVD edition is a shame. Why they did this? I have a japanese edition of this title in LD (yes, remember Laserdisc?) which has image and sound better than the VHS. It also includes all the lyrics printed along with photos and an interview (the interview is written in japanese). Well, I suggest you wait until a complete version is released.",1303689600,,496,4.584269662921348

Mark does mostly all old favorites (but not Sultans of Swing)and is accompanied in many songs by the Electra Strings, pipes and accordion like instruments and jams with guitar legend Sunny Landreth on a couple of songs.  This was a real treat to watch.  The venue was small and intimate and the band is small compared to Dire Straits on their 91-93 world tour. I highly recommend this DVD as well as ""On the Night"".  It's an excellent contrast between Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler after Dire Straits dis-banded. You can't beat the price either!",1296345600,,635,4.745454545454545

Unfortunately, I did not look at anything other than the title (such as reviewers comments) and ordered it. This foolishly thinking that the VHS and DVD versions would be the same.
Upon receipt I noticed that my favorite performance from the VHS edition ""Sultans of Swing"" had been deleted from the DVD version. This is a song that is timeless and the performance is phenomenal! So, why in a format that allows for even more content (DVD) would they choose to omit songs? Poor decision in my opinion.
For editing reasons I give this DVD 4 stars. Musically it is 5+ stars.

Just be forewarned, not all original content is there.",1269043200,2,744,4.593984962406015

The band plays well and the sound quality is good. Not quite as big a production as the On the Night DVD and it feels like a more intimate concert which has its benefits.

817766,3,6304197950,"While the performance is wonderful and oozes with mood that few live shows do, anyone buying this should know that the audio and video are subpar at best.

The audio, which I believe for concerts is the critical piece, is compressed and almost lifeless, even compared to most other shows coming from VHS. 5.1 might help but, it would be masking a mediocre recording that is presented, not in Stereo PCM but, in lossy DD 2.0.  There is little low end and an apparent bump in the mid bass which makes it sound quite muddy much of the time.

The video is 1.33 and very soft. Only close-ups even seem to be in focus. I am sure that a 92"" 16x9 screen does not help so YMMV.

The concert is great and worth owning. I did not send mine back because of these technical issues. I am just disappointed by them

If this show is ever re-mastered for blu-ray with PCM or HD audio, I will buy it again in a second.",1244332800,,900,4.209302325581396
817767,3,6304197950,"This is one of Mark Knopfler's best performance ever, however, the DVD does not come with his performance of Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing, whereas these songs are included in the VHS version. I am a big Dire Straits fan and there are several of there songs that I prefer to Sultans of Swing, however, Mark Knopfler's performance of the sited song is just amazing. I haven't seen anything like it. So the big question is, why didn't they include Sultans of Swing and Money for Nothing in the DVD? The DVD as a whole would get my 5 stars, I have taken 2 away for the frustration of knowing that one of the best guitar performance ever was not included!

With that being said, I still think it is worth buying.",1228176000,8,717,4.350746268656716
817768,4,6304197950,"This is a very laid-back, gentle and intimate performace by Knopfler and fellow musicians. In this performance you can tell that he has been heavily influenced by J.J.Cale. Just watch ""To Tulsa and back on tour with J.J.Cale"" DVD. If you like Knopfler you'll like J.J.Cale. Also, the guest performances by Sonny Landreth on Guitar is excellent electric guitar work including slide guitar play. This DVD is a lot different from the Dire Straits ""on the night"" DVD, because it is more gentle, more intimate and in a smaller venue. However, both are great DVD's.  Knopfler is an excellent guitarist himself, this DVD proves it. I did not have
any problem with the 2.0 sound. It sounded just like 5.1 surround sound to me.",1213574400,3,718,4.790322580645161
817769,5,6304197950,"Mark Knopfler is our favorite musician, bar none!  This is a wonderful concert, but with an exception. For some reason the DVD (unlike the video)does not include Sultans of Swing which is one of the best of all. Otherwise it is a fantastic must-see!  He just gets better and better!",1211846400,,282,4.62
817770,4,6304197950,"On the upside, this concert DVD features Mark Knopfler and some outstanding backup musicians, including the amazing Sonny Landreth; it covers many of the lovliest songs from Knopfler's Golden Heart CD, plus some of the movie music and a couple of the Dire Straits hits.  This is enough to make it a thoroughly enjoyable evening of music.  The downside is that the sound isn't all that good--a duet between Knopfler and Landreth to intro Cannibals is almost inaudible--and the director doesn't seem to have a very good grasp of who is playing what during the final number--a three-way jam on Gravy Train that will knock your socks off.  Unfortunately, the camera is often focused on the wrong musician, zooming in on an idle Paul Franklin when Landreth is burning down the house, then switching to Landreth when Franklin cuts in for a solo ride.  Overall, however, these frustrations don't diminish the fact that this is marvelous Knopfler music, with plenty of his clean, distinctive guitar work, fine, literate lyrics, and outstanding work from the whole band and guest artists.  I really enjoy this DVD and play it often, but I wish the film and sound team had been a bit sharper.",1195171200,3,1182,4.8606965174129355

Besides the people who complain about the sound quality. This is an excellent addition to knopfler fans. I play this dvd through a 2 speaker stereo system and it sounds great. I cannot count the times I have played this. I am also a guitar player,(no where near professional)and the songs on this dvd blow me away. Golden Heart,Je Suis Desole and especially Going Home, I have continued to try to learn with some success. All I can say is that whenever I sit and practice playing,I always finish with this one. Even if I started the night with this one. Mark is a unique musician. Smooth effortless playing,intriguing lyrics and a voice that carries each song with incredible emotion. A MUST HAVE for sure.",1189382400,,830,4.691780821917808

This DVD of him and others in London I thought was just great.
Some of his best tunes with some terrific support. The setting was spot on, up close and personal with a cracking rapport between the various musicians. The whole thing was superbly crafted and I loved it from start to finish.",1184284800,,353,4.130434782608695
817822,5,6304197950,"I have to admit being almost completely unobjective where Mark Knopfler is concerned, and it's comforting to know that I'm not alone - I'm sure he could raise his own army if he was so inclined - so it will come as no surprise that I was glued to the set watching this performance. It so happened that the first edition with which I came into contact was the VHS copy of this concert; unwittingly, I picked the item with superior content (upon reading reviews of the DVD edition with the idea of upgrading, it became apparent that the DVD is, instead, a step backward; it does not contain essential pieces, like Sultans of Swing - perhaps this omission will be remedied if there is another pressing of the DVD). I am pleased to note that Mark Knopfler never fails to impress, any time I have seen him in any capacity; he works well with the musicians he convenes for his concerts, and over nearly thirty years has quietly amassed appearances with such a diverse assortment of performers and projects, nothing he could do would seem off. This concert - how great would it have been to be in that cosy little hall and witness it - seems to have been a promotion for ""Golden Heart"" (which came out that year) and I may have to go back and revise my review of that album - I was slightly harsh on it, although I still consider it a true first effort - as the biggest part of the concert on the VHS is from that album, and is VERY good. There are a LOT of musicians on stage - three keyboardists, four guitarists (besides Mark), a string quartet, four Irish musicians - it's amazing to me, with all those musicians in that small space, that nobody got in anybody else's way, but that's just how well this group worked together. Mark Knopfler possesses the magic to get the best out of everybody he collects to assist him, and make it look effortless. There were a lot of smiles all around as well - both on stage and in the audience. A relaxed, cohesive performance,  well-balanced between new and old material (even though this was primarily about Mark's re-entry into the musical bullpen with ""Golden Heart"", there are about an equal amount of pieces from older works, going all the way back to the beginning and touching on mid- and late-Dire Straits and some of his movie scores as well). I had a great time watching this and can tell it will be played a lot. I'm planning to introduce my nephew to it before long - there's a whole new generation out there to enchant.",1154131200,3,2467,4.421978021978022

Don't buy the DVD version, since it doesn't have Sultans of Swing on it.  If you have ever heard Mark live, you know what I mean.  Growing up with classic rock, I got to the point that I couldn't even listen to Sultans of Swing on the radio.  But his live versions of the song are absolutely genius.  Only drawback is the VHS format in an era of DVD's, but fight through it to enjoy a great concert in an intimate setting in London.  Camera shots and the rest of his band couldn't be better.

Must buy for Mark Knopfler fans.",1140048000,4,658,4.25
817824,4,6304197950,"As a long time Mark Knopfler fan, I anxiously awaited the release of this DVD. I bought the VHS version when it came out, and always loved it, but like others have noted, I was disappointed that the DVD edition had been substantially truncated, with the most irritating deletion being the removal of ""Sultans of Swing."" I honestly can't imagine why this would be done given the excess of space on the DVD and the relative brevity of the show, which was done for English TV in 1996. I would have easily given this DVD five stars were it not for the editing of the set list.

The performance itself is, of course, wonderful; the performers obviously have excellent rapport and are having fun, and despite the fact that the DVD only has two channel stereo sound, the recording quality is still very good. I particularly like to see Mark when he performs with Chad Cromwell, the drummer featured here, as the two of them obviously click so well as a team. The Electra Strings and the Irish musicians are welcome additions here as are guests Sonny Landreth and Jools Holland. I am frankly not a big fan of the pedal steel guitar, so I could have done without Paul Franklin's appearance, but that's just a personal preference.

There are many standout tracks on this DVD, but my favorites here are ""Golden Heart,"" ""Je Suis Desole,"" the beautiful ""A Night in Summer Long Ago"" (which took a while to grow on me, but now I consider a favorite), and perhaps the most uplifting version of ""Going Home"" I have ever seen or heard.

I do recommend this DVD without reservation; I just wish the set had not been pruned from the VHS edition.",1121212800,85,1625,4.539249146757679
817825,3,6304197950,"Why in God's name would anyone release an edited version of an otherwise fabulous show?  Especially when the two edited songs (read ""missing completely"") are arguably among Dire Straits'  most celebrated works?  Cut ""sultans of Swing"" and ""Money for Nothing""?  Are they nuts?  Jesus, what a disappointment...I wish I hadn't sold my VHS copy a couple of years ago.  The makers of this disc should be ashamed.",1116460800,47,407,5.0
817826,4,6304197950,"First, the bad:

I don't know the history behind this show, but it almost looks like it was done for TV and not for a video/DVD.

For starters, it's in 2.0 stereo.  Is this all they had in 1996?  I'm not being a wise guy, I really don't know.

Second,  the title ""A night in London""  reveals nothing about the fact that it coincides with his first solo album, Golden Heart.  Buying this 8 years after it came out,  I wasn't familiar with most of the songs.

Also, the cover has a pic of him circa 1980's, with the tennis head- band ala Dire Straits.  In the concert, he is minus the headband, and a little less hair.  Not a big deal, but just shows they skimped on the details of this package.  They did include the lyrics, however.

Lastly,  if the sub-par sound format wasn't a downer enough, there are NO extras in this DVD. Perhaps a time constraint on the disc, I'm not sure.  It's also missing some songs from the VHS release.

Now to the good:

As a MK fan, it's fantastic!  The quality of the recording is good, despite the limited format they used.  Mark's Les Paul has such a warm tone to it.  I never realized he never uses a pick, either.  Richard Bennett sounds real good on the 12 string.

The first song, Darling Pretty,  is so beautiful and upbeat.  If it doesn't move you, you're not alive.  The other songs are really good, mostly mellow.  I really like the fact that he used a string section, too.  Female fiddle players are always hot! Later on, he does Romeo & Juliet and it sounds great.

One thing that makes the concert sound so good is the subtlety of the different array of instruments.  The steel pedal at times, adds that unique sustain;  the B-3 organ and piano complement, but don't overshadow the songs.

All in all, I'm really glad I bought this, mainly because it introduced me to some of MK's music I wasn't familiar with.

If you're an MK fan, you'll like it, but at the same time, you'll be disappointed at the economny the company used to put it out.  Mark deserves better; he deserves 6-channel surround!",1116460800,20,2042,4.357333333333333
817827,1,6304197950,"I was amazed! I found out to late! My original copy of this show on VHS broke up, since I kept watching it again and again. Now I just bought the DVD, and the surprise wat that the show IS NOT complete!! there are important songs left out of the DVD (sultans of swing, Money for nothing)that are included in the VHS, that was so dissapointing to me.

Better get the VHS version.

One other bad point is the audio, 2.0 for a DVD? come on!",1113782400,29,437,4.069767441860465
817828,3,6304197950,"Just wanted to post a warning review to you Knopfler fans out there......I previously owned the VHS version of this show, and I have never been so impressed by the sound of basic VHS Hi Fi as I was with that tape. So, of course, when I found out a few months after buying the VHS that it was available on DVD, I promptly mailed my VHS copy as a gift to a close friend and ordered the DVD. After all, superior video and audio, potential for surround (when I upgrade to that some day - right now my 2-channel setup puts all my friends' 5.1 setups to shame), random access of tracks, etc. etc. I just received the DVD in the mail today, and am returning it tomorrow without even opening it, and ordering another VHS copy for myself. Why?? Because the DVD slices over a half hour of program material off the VHS version, and it's in 2.0 format. Shame on them for doing this to a release that should be superior to and more desirable in every way than the VHS.

If you want the most complete version of this show and you own a good Hi Fi VHS machine, buy the tape. It's a few more bucks, but includes tracks (e.g. an awesome version of ""Sultans"") that I  for one do not want to go without. Your purchase will also constitute an indirect boycott of DVD companies who dare to pull nonsense like this on us loyal, money-paying fans.

Just wanted you to be forewarned.",1108512000,299,1359,4.239382239382239
817829,4,6304197950,"I waited a long time for this DVD.  I ordered it in mid November, prior to its release date of the 23rd of that month.  The estimated delivery date from November was for the 23rd of January, two full months.  In answer to my e-mail about why the DVD was not available in November, Amazon told me that the distributor under-estimated the demand for it, and they would be slow to fill the orders. I just got it today in mid January, and I can say it was worth the wait.

First thing, this would be a 5 out of 5 disc in every way, but for the fact that it doesn't fully utilize the potential of the technology.  It is simply a basic two-channel, left / right stereo rendering of a concert shot in 1996.  It could, no should be presented in Dolby 5.1 to get the most out of the format.  There are too many things happening and too many sounds being generated by the terrific musicians on the stage to be compressed into two speakers.  Something has to take a back seat, and too often it is Knopfler's vocals, which are already right at the edge of being considered to be mumbling.  If a 1976 concert like the ""Last Waltz"" can be re-mastered and released on DVD in very credible 5.1 sound, then why not this 1996 show?

The production quality of the filming is pretty good.  Many multiple camera angles, and seamless transitions from camera to camera show that someone initially took the recording of this show serious.  The venue is very intimate, not like a giant stadium shows where the crowds swallow the stage.  The rapport between the players is clear and the mood is relaxed.  There are several guests that add to the pool of players, such as piano player Jools Holland and slide guitar ace Sonny Landreth, and Knopfler lets them have some lead time, especially Landreth.  The songs are mostly from the ""Golden Heart"" album, but there are a few Dire Straits songs in the mix, including ""Brothers in Arms"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"", both of which are very well done.  The disc comes in at just over 90 minutes, and ends on a nice rocking Jam where everyone takes a bit of lead-time to show off.  Overall, this is a satisfying show, except for the realization that the sound could be better.  Any Knopfler fan will enjoy this disc.

So after getting this disc, the bench mark for me to watch and listen to Mark Knopfler will still have to be his performance in Royal Albert Hall for the ""Music for Montserrat"" show filmed in 1997.  It is shows like that that let you know why you traded up from VHS to DVD, and ran speakers all over the living room.",1105401600,37,2546,4.376595744680851
817830,5,6304197950,"A great smal venue with an eclectic group of backup musicians from Irish pipes to strings to Sonny Landreth's haunting slide makes this one of Knopfler's strong ""personal"" albums.  I saw one critique the lack of his trademark red Fender in place of a lesser unknown guitar.  Happens to be a Paul Suhr, one of the best customs made and one of Mark's favorites although he uses a Gibson mostly on these tracks.  Voice a little weak and slighly flat on ""Imelda"" which is a shame as this is one of his best tongue in cheek social commentaries.  Use of string accompaniement is great. ""Cal"" as usual is a tear jearker.  I'd buy and cherish any DVD, CD or VHS that has ""Sultans"" on it.  The up close camera work on his left hand on this tape makes you just stare at your own hand in wonderment and awe.  Truly worth the bucks expecially to see Mark's new expensive stage ""rags""!",1094083200,4,872,4.37888198757764
7865880,5,6304197950,"This DVD, recorded in 1996, is from the same time period as my favorite Mark Knopfler CD - Golden Heart.  The performances are super solid.  Importantly, the two channel stereo recording is top notch.  As is his style, the performance is understated but always a pleasure to watch a master do their thing.  The song selection for the set is varied and strong.  The backup musicians and singers are superb.  Highly recommended.",1500508800,,426,4.847222222222222
