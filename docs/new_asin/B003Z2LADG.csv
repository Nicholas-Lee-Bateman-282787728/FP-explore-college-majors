8502935,5,B003Z2LADG,This was okay but rather amateur. Not as much about horses as I was hoping. I think the title is misleading.,1391644800,,108,4.190476190476191
8502936,4,B003Z2LADG,"I enjoyed the video because it is thought provoking and honest.  It is not meant to be a tutorial on how to farm with horses.  It would be interesting to see a follow-up that would tell us where Tom, Matt and Aubrey are now  and whether they have been able to continue as farmers with or without horses.",1384646400,,303,4.189655172413793
8502937,1,B003Z2LADG,"Not really about farming with horses, more like a video resume for three inexperienced wanna be farmers.  The film uses horses and pretty pictures and child like musings to draw you in and then states the obvious about farming in NJ.  Land is expensive in New Jersey DUH, and working farms are not as plentiful as they once were, DUH. It suggests that wanna be farmers with no money need to be creative in how they access land and finance their business.  Wow, its just like trying to start any other business in a competitive environment. There, that is the whole film in a nut shell, save your money.  Don't pay for someone else s'resume!",1330819200,,640,4.539130434782609
8502938,5,B003Z2LADG,"When the oil gets too expensive we'll switch to.... well what exactly? A growing number of people have seen the writing on the barn wall and it says that horses will be making a come back on farms. This beautifully shot film tracks various wanna be farmers in their attempts to use the horse instead of the tractor for farming. Their are pros and cons to horses and this film explores quite a few of the issues making it useful both as an exploration of the issues and a starting point for anyone wanting to follow in their hoof prints. While not shying away from the challenges, the film manages to remain upbeat and inspiring.",1314489600,,628,4.469565217391304
