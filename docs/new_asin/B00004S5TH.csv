8167161,3,B00004S5TH,"Der Zauberberg is a mixed bag, as it features many scenes with magnificently written dialogue and beautiful cinematography. Some scenes work well in their weirdness and deliver a decent insight into the world of troubled spirits. What mars the experience is, that the staginess and the melodramatic feeling often work against the movie. Also, it lacks cohesion and structural pacing, which is why the direction struggles to convey the importance of the basic premise. It is simply not as well-delivered as it could have been, and considering the status of the novel, also not as fleshed-out as it should have been.
Overall 5/10

8167163,5,B00004S5TH,excellent production. acting was especially good. Read book twice but last time was over 30 years ago so I don't remember everything clearly. Forgot how disturbingly funny it can be.,1388707200,,182,5.1
8167164,3,B00004S5TH,"My stars are based on the story, not the roduction, or the seller's service.  I only got it to see the hotel where I was manager during some of the shooting, and to see if I could spot me and my family in our extras roles, and to remember conversations with Rod Steiger and Charles Aznavour - lovely people!",1385164800,,307,4.203389830508475
8167165,3,B00004S5TH,"The thought of making a film out of this enormous novel, long on talk, short on much action, seems daunting, but Hans  Geissendrfer's film does a creditable job, with some allowances for the excesses of late 70's film making (this film dates to 1982, but it really harks back to the 70's in artsy style, much theatrical staging of scenes, an interpretation that is faithful to the book in meaning but not in style, I think.)

The novel, which deals with the seven year sabbatical of a young engineer at a tuberculosis sanatorium right on the cusp of World War 1, is one more in the long line of novels that discuss the huge change in Europe that occurred after this war. Old Europe, and its descent into decadent lifestyle is depicted in the hermetic environment of an indulgent health resort in the Swiss Alps.

The film does a good job of depicting the social decadence, and the conversations between Castorp, his humanist mentor Settembrini, the Jesuit Naphta and the dionysian Peeperkorn are fairly well handled and Rod Steiger (dubbed into German) is superb as the off-the-rails alcoholic Peeperkorn. The casting of many of the main characters is uncannily correct--Marusja, Joachim, Frau Englehardt and even the dwarf Emerentia. The casting of Castorp and Clawdia Chauchat, however, are not as pleasing; Chauchat is too French and seductive, Castorp too young and callow. Settembrini is too much ""Groucho Marx"" and not enough the urbane Italian humanist. Charles Aznavour is amazing as Naptha.

Many scenes have been deleted from this DVD, so I actually recommend you purchase the set of three Mann films,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thomas-Mann-Collection/dp/B000MR9C3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thomas Mann Collection</a>&nbsp;which has the whole series of this film plus a very long miniseries of Buddenbrooks, the novel Mann wrote in his 20's, which is an incredibly good production of his debut novel.",1361577600,6,1968,5.400651465798045
8167166,2,B00004S5TH,"This two disk / 2 part version is lousy. It misses some key scenes including the important scene in the snow and also the Settermbrini & Naphta's discussions, both key to plot of the novel. These scenes were shown in the 2 disk 3 part earlier film version. Also, Joachim seems to randomly die at the start of disk 2 for no reason. And the casting of Clavdia is questionable, as she does not appear to the gorgeous siren she's depicted as in the novel or in the earlier 3 part film version. And the casting of Hans is also questionable, as he looks like he is 17 instead of 24. Book > this movie version. 2 out of 5 stars. Disappointing.",1289433600,7,636,4.221311475409836
8167167,3,B00004S5TH,"Meanwhile, a technically excellent commercial re-issue of the original TV serial has been published in Germany on the label Fernsehjuwelen, including, as an extra, the widescreen (shortened) theatrical release! So forget about this dreadful and amateurish transfer.",1264636800,14,265,6.1891891891891895
