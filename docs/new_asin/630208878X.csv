425117,5,630208878X,"I am a romantic at heart, and this movie has all the elements:comedy, romance, action. This movie is like taking Better Off Dead,The Saint, Troop from Beverly Hills and rolling it all into a movie that makes you laugh, cry, and smile.",954028800,,234,4.595238095238095
425118,4,630208878X,My wife and I rented this video years ago and loved the movie.  She has been after me to buy it lately and I am sad to see it is not available.  Need to find one soon!  Anyone have an extra?,952128000,,190,3.5853658536585367

425120,5,630208878X,"What a wonderful love story, can't believe it got taken out of print.....Please bring it back...",944524800,,96,5.0625
425121,5,630208878X,"This movie is one of my favorites.  It is silly, sweet, and romatic.  It has everything a good movie needs - comedy, romance, and a cute kid. I have tried to find it for purchase for three years. PLEASE, PLEASE bring it  back!!",935884800,,227,4.232558139534884
425122,5,630208878X,"I saw this movie a few years ago now, but it's become one of my favourites of all time.  Steve Guttenberg is very good as are all the cast but I have to say the person that steals the film is the little girl shes adorable.  I  imagine she's a teenager by now!",935020800,,259,3.849056603773585
425163,4,630208878X,"I love the movie and although I was sent the VHS instead of the DVD it is still great. It is romantic and very fun and very much a chick flick, the cast is well  done. Steve Guttenburg is always fun to watch.",1320364800,,208,3.8372093023255816
425164,3,630208878X,the service was great with this seller shipment came quick and the price was right,1282521600,,82,4.533333333333333
425165,5,630208878X,"Very sweet, romantic movie with just the right amount of comedy to make you smile.  Steve Guetenburg is one hunky guy, but puts it all out there, starting out in this movie as a cartoonist who is overcoming illness.  His sister, played by shelly long is a romance writer, a real character.  She is key in his makeover to get the girl he's fallen in love with.  A must see movie for all.",1272844800,,386,4.2465753424657535
425166,5,630208878X,"I used to own this movie on Laser Disc. Anyone remember those? It's fun and sweet and has great performances by Steve Guttenberg, Shelley Long, Jamie Gertz and the little girl who plays piglet.",1261353600,,193,4.705882352941177
425167,5,630208878X,"I have never forgotten this movie.  It was a little known and problably little money making movie, but one that has always stuck in my mind.  My mother and I saw this movie many years ago and loved it.  I watched it a few times after that and then forgot about it.  It would pop up frequently in my mind and I thought I would look for it and add it to my library as well as share with my daughter and other friends and family.  I'm glad to find it and it's new name ?Boyfriend Club? which is not any where near as good as the original title, ""Don't tell her it's me"".  Under the new name ""Boyfriend Club"" is where you can find it in DVD format.  You can find it on VHS under the original title ""Don't tell her it's me"", which fits the movie so much better.  I highly recommend this movie and look forward to adding it to my favorite movie collection.  Give it a try and enjoy!",1198108800,2,876,4.017341040462428
425168,5,630208878X,"I have always loved this movie.  They changed the name to ""Boyfriend School"" so it took me a while to find it in DVD, but it's the exact same movie.  It's a story with a lot of heart and exposes some of our silly notions about what really matters in the character of a person.  I highly recommend it.",1174262400,5,300,4.0508474576271185
425169,5,630208878X,"Good news! This movie's coming out on January 24, 2005 on DVD, and it'll be called ""Boyfriend School""! It's such a great, hilarious movie!",1104796800,3,138,4.791666666666667
425170,5,630208878X,"I've been looking and asking for this movie at any and all movie stores since I first rented it in the 90's.  I watched it twice and laughed until I cried.  It was an uplifting, and overall enthralling romance/comedy.  Very well done.  I rarely watch a movie twice but I wanted to purchase this one.  A catchy plot and memorable.  It reminded me somehow of ""Heaven Can Wait.""",1099094400,,375,4.4411764705882355
425171,5,630208878X,"This was an excellent modern day romance. It satisfies the female fantasy with creativity and humour. I've recommended it to many friends who have enjoyed it as much as I have. I just wish it were available to buy and would particularly love to have it on DVD. It's a movie that will be enjoyed over and over. It leaves a ""feel good"" impression.",1090540800,,345,4.40625
425172,4,630208878X,"For everyone who loves romance novels, this is your movie. This hilarious, hearfelt movie pairs a recovering cancer patient with a beautiful, unattainable journalist.  With the help of Shelly Long, who is a romance novelist in this movie, Steve Guttenburg wins the girl of his dreams and makes you believe that love is not just skin deep....",1086134400,,341,4.982456140350878
425193,5,630208878X,years ago I saw this movie and now I do hope that the producers will realize what a wonderful movie this was and still is and decide to put it on DVD ... PLEASE !,1081814400,,162,3.657142857142857
425194,5,630208878X,I fell in love w/this movie several years ago.  And I have been trying to get a copy of the movie for years.  I hope that they will realize how many people love this movie and do a release of it for buyers like myself and others I have seen on this site.  It truly is a wonderful romantic/comedy that will touch you heart and funny bone.,1048809600,,337,4.0
425195,5,630208878X,"This movie was shown on basic cable for years under the title ""Don't Tell Her It's Me"" and later the exact same movie was shown under the title ""The Boyfriend School.""  It is such a unique and funny movie, that makes fun of women who say they don't mind what a man looks like as long as he is a good person.
It is based on a novel ""The Boyfriend School,"" by Sarah Bird, out-of-print, but available used at Amazon.com.",1047254400,,417,4.2125
425196,5,630208878X,"Truly, this is one of the funniest and most enjoyable movies I have ever seen.  It's just delightful!",1020816000,,101,4.611111111111111
425197,5,630208878X,"Don't Tell Her...is a funny romance about a young man who loves a
young lady he meets (a scheme of his sister's) at dinner.  He loves her so much that he is willing to sacrifice to make himself
over to be appealing to her--and boy does he do a great job!  His
sister, who is also hilarious, coaxed him into attracting his love interest for other reasons, like enhancing her next romance novel and, it seems, to also prove a point.  His little niece is
so beautiful and also funny in this film.
This is a delightful movie, comical yet sensitive.  You will want
to see it over and over.  I have seen it at least 3 times and
would love to own it.  One of the best!!",1017187200,,662,4.1328125
425198,3,630208878X,"I have read mixed reviews for this movie but I can tell you that the book it is based on is 100 times better. It's called ""The Boyfriend School"" and is written by Sarah Bird. When I read the book, I pictured Julia Roberts and Mel Gibson as the leads and Carol Kane as the sister. Whether you liked the movie or hated it, please read the book!
P.S. I keep hoping a stronger remake of this movie will be made. It's a great story that deserves a better cast and script.",994809600,,466,4.076086956521739
425199,5,630208878X,"The first time I saw this movie I loved it.  Repeated viewings since then  haven't changed my feelings toward it.  It's one of those movies that you  love to watch again and again.  Yes, I know Leonard Maltin gave it a bad  review, but I think you can tell by the other reviews here that he was  wrong this time around.  If you can find a copy of it, get it!",965952000,2,358,3.943661971830986
425200,5,630208878X,This is a wonderful movie and I am very disappointed that it is not in print. I hope that they will realize how many people would purchase it if they would. It has been several years since I have seen it and would love  to be able to see it again. I always enjoy a good comedy without a lot of  foul language and without alot of nudity which seems to be so rampant in  movies these days. It's a feel good movie that You must see.,964656000,10,429,3.9080459770114944
425201,5,630208878X,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  It has got to be one of the most underrated comedies ever.  Shelly Long plays a romance novel writer who decides to give her brother a makeover, to help him win the girl  of his dreams.  What results is Steve Guttenberg as an Austrian biker  called ""Lobo"".  The dialogue in this movie is hilarious, and the  casting couldn't have been better.  I hope this movie is re-printed.  The  video store I used to rent it from, lost the movie in a flood, and now I  can't find it anywhere.  For anyone who has the chance to see this movie,  do, you will not be disappointed.",956880000,20,619,4.232758620689655
7821278,4,630208878X,"Light entertainment featuring a young man whose image is less than breath-taking after a serious health event. The girl he falls for is sweet,  but he needs help to catch her eye. Wow! A major transformation is fun to see.  This is fun to see on bad hair days and any time you just want to escape.",1511308800,,297,4.192982456140351
7821279,5,630208878X,Loved the story! High priced for a VHS but it IS a Collectable now. Worth it.,1487808000,,77,3.875
