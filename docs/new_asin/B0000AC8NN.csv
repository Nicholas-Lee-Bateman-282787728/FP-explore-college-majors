7996699,5,B0000AC8NN,"Great quality reproduction does this series it's justice! In the genre of ""Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"", One Step Beyond dealt with premonitions and the super natural. Of course, the great, eerie soundtrack topped it all off!",1377129600,,234,5.184210526315789
7996700,5,B0000AC8NN,"When this series was first on television, I was a big fan and now I get to relive it again. Up until now I could only find a few programs here and there, but now with the addition of this set of 12 I believe I have the entire run of the program that has been made available. The quality is very acceptable.",1368921600,,306,3.873015873015873
7996701,5,B0000AC8NN,"I really want this one.  My sisters and I were 10, 9, 8, 7, & 4 when my parents were next door playing cards with the neighbors.  About halfway through this one, we all ran screaming bloody murder over to the neighbor's house.  I could not sleep next to a wall for 6 years for fear a face would appear out of nowhere.  I would love to see this one again, just to see why it frightened us so.  If I wanted to scare my sister at night, I would just say ""Alcoa Presents is on the wall"" and you can bet she went running and screaming.  I am sure we would all get a good laugh if we saw today what terrorized us for so long as children.",1126742400,13,631,3.852713178294574
7996702,5,B0000AC8NN,"VCI Entertainment has put out most definitely the best prints available of OSB anywhere.  I was nearly knocked out at the video quality when I watched this DVD, having always loved the series but like everyone else, having to endure the characteristic horrible prints of TV reruns over the years.  I don't know where VCI got these prints but I hope they continue releasing the series, as their prints are by far better than the crap used by the other companies selling OSB DVD's on Amazon.  Beware all others regarding quality, but I will admit that if VCI does not step up to the plate, I may be forced to settle for the same old poor quality prints of the other compilations.  The quality of the video, along with the ability to buy all 12 of these episodes on one DVD, has made this OSB release the best value by far.",1095638400,21,820,4.410596026490066
7996703,5,B0000AC8NN,"Okay, so some of the prints aren't the best in world, but so what? It's ""One Step Beyond"" and we are finally getting to see more than a scattered episode here and there on DVD.
VCI Entertainment did an excellent job of putting this DVD package together and I love the spooky DVD ""landscape"" created by VCI between the episodes. It's not just your average cheapie compliation of ""here's the episodes with no money spent to set the mood.""
""Ordeal on Locust Street"" is worth the price of admission alone, and John Newlands deadpan intos and outros run a close second to Rod Serling's.
Sure, ""One Step Beyond"" has always been considered to be the poor man's ""Twilight Zone,"" but that's part of it's charm. It's like a night of cheap thrills at a 1950's drive-in.
I just hope VCI Entertainment is true to it's word and makes available future collections.
So buy this set, sit back, and enjoy Collection #1 of ""One Step Beyond.""",1073779200,30,922,4.593939393939394
7996704,5,B0000AC8NN,"The CLOWN!?  THE CLOWN is on this set!?!?!?!  I am SO buying this right now.
I saw that on tv when I was five or six.  I couldn't look into a mirror for YEARS afterward... which the crueler among us would say was beneficial.
I saw it on a couple of years ago as a patchy, chopped up rerun.  From an adult (reasonably) perspective, the episode moves somewhat slower than a drunk snail in a tub of molasses -- and it still scared the bejeezus out of me.",1065571200,19,451,4.090909090909091
7996705,1,B0000AC8NN,"Terrible picture Quality and bad sound.
Stories are not nearly as good as twilight zone.",1060128000,3,88,4.933333333333334
