8336168,3,B001QQ52CS,"As I was looking for something new in the world of Christian comedy to tickle my funny bone like I have experienced with other such comedians as Mark Lowry, Steve Geyer, Chonda Pierce, Ken Davis and others, I came across this DVD from Aaron Wilburn.  I'd seen him briefly on some old Gaither videos and thought this would fit the bill.  Looking at the topics he covered including diet, living in the South, Christian humor, and other such life stuff, I thought it was gonna be perfect.  Sad to say, though, I was disappointed.

Unlike Lowry, Pierce, Davis and other Christian comedians, Wilburn looked a little dazed and out of place.  I'm all for somebody performing on the cuff as he apparently is used to doing, but make it funny.  The ""uhhh"" and ""ummms"" as well as the deafening silence in parts made it difficult to remember this was supposed to be a comedy DVD.  Then add on top of that some of the jokes that were so old and tired that I already knew the punch line before he gave it (i.e. the preacher describing a squirrel in a sermon illustration and the little kid answering that the answer has to be Jesus but it sounds like a squirrel).  Not very original.

Then there were the awkward camera shots of the audience laughing incessantly even when Wilburn wasn't saying anything funny.  Sure, there were some mildly humorous jokes told that would warrant obligatory laughter, but none that would make you pull out a handkerchief to wipe away tears from your eyes and snot from your nose as one man did on camera (couldn't they edit that out?).  Plus, the camera guys must have been pretty bored too because we got several shots of the ceiling in the church this was filmed in during the performance.  Was Aaron Wilburn THAT uninteresting that they couldn't keep the camera on him during his show?

All in all, it's not a completely bad DVD, but it could have benefited from better preparation by Wilburn, a more professional camera crew, and a sincere audience who laughed in appropriate amounts at the right time.  It was disappointing because I long for quality Christian comedy to break through to a lost and dying world that desperately needs to learn about a Saviour who can deliver them from their one-way destination towards Hell.  For his attempt to do that, I salute Aaron Wilburn and wish him well as he continues ministering to those people like that pastor and wife who lost their 27-year old son in a car accident.  It was a touching moment at the end of what was otherwise a pretty ho-hum and forgettable comedy routine.",1243641600,,2545,4.609756097560975
