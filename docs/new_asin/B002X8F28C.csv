We hear about bombs going off every now and then, but what this film reveals is just scary beyond imagination. To live in constant fear, not from bombs but from the gangs that seems to have taken over the life over there. Wow! Eye opening for sure. The film does contain violent images so beware, still the film is a must see!",1276128000,,515,4.375
