6934311,5,B00RQZB78Q,"Just watched this movie for the first time. It starts off slow, and kind of weird, but the more it gets into it it's actually a great movie. The ending is always the best part of a film. I loved it! Nick Jonas did a fantastic job on this film. But, Isabel should have been cast differently, either age-wise or acting skill wise because there was something just a bit off about her acting, and age for that matter. It's actually a shame this movie never properly came out here in the US.",1433462400,,486,4.236559139784946
6934312,3,B00RQZB78Q," a spoiler-free review 
We've seen this story before, although I can't tell you exactly where since I rarely watch this type of thriller. I was in it for Isabel Lucas, the quirky, adorable, and talented Aussie actress who played the slippery foil to protagonist ""Doug"" (Nick Jonas). Is it a coincidence that ""Doug"" and ""cougar"" both contain ""oug""? Critics have stated that Isabel Lucas wasn't old enough to play a cougar (the actress is only 8 years older than Jonas), but such complaints are petty: A woman doesn't need to be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mrs-Robinson/dp/B0184DLI28/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mrs. Robinson</a>&nbsp;to be a cougar. The onscreen relationship was still scandalous, and there was a more realistic chemistry between Jonas and Lucas than probably would have occurred between Jonas and a Mrs. Robinson.

""Careful"" is a classic but fairly unremarkable femme fatale scenario. As far as the intended audience: what were they thinking? I didn't know anything about Jonas, but apparently he has a fanbase outside of film. In one sense this movie is for Jonas followers, but in another it's the antithesis of a ""chick flick,"" as I can see Careful being a wet dream for straight teenage boys who would be more than happy to get cougared by Isabel Lucas. Another ploy for that demographic is the inclusion of Kandyse McClure (Battlestar Galactica). I'm not a teenage boy, but as a former one I surely would have been foolish enough to fall into the predicament faced by this kid. Maybe I still am a teenage boy?

Apparently the MPAA gave the theatrical version a Restricted rating due to a wet shirt not hiding nipples (gasp!), whereas the German Blu-ray release I purchased is ""Freigegeben ab 12 Jahren (FSK 12),"" meaning ages 12 and up are welcome, and children who are at least age 6 may be admitted with parental accompaniment (i.e., it's not censored, it's just that Germans aren't as uptight about nipples as Americans).

As with most of my 3-star film reviews: I'm not sorry to have watched this, but I would be very selective as to which friends I would recommend see Careful.",1431648000,7,2150,5.131428571428572

Do you want to reach out and shake the Nick character and yell ""snap out of it"" but you get a teenager with rampaging hormones and a possibly attractive older woman, we know what the rest is. the ending is so predictable and again nothing I haven't seen before.

6934355,2,B00RQZB78Q,"Writer Chris Frisina needs a breath of fresh air. This tired old story has few saving graces and Elizabeth Allens direction make the story plod even more slowly. Nick Jonas needs to discuss his movie choices more closely with his agent: films this sad won't make a dent in his career if he intends to be taken seriously as an actor.

Briefly (the is so little story line hat a few words will suffice), Doug Martin (Nick Jonas  best when he take his shirt off) is living at the lake, bored, virginal, girl shy, when an out of town couple decides to rent the house next door. The wife Lena is an anorexic appearing seductress (Isabel Lucas) married to an older wealthy investment banker Elliot (Dermot Mulroney) who abuses Lena under Dougs watchful eye. Lena seduces Doug, Doug is controlled by his hormones on this first sexual adventure and under cover the two carry on a sordid affair. Elliot is away most of the time but on one visit home he ends up dead and the manner in which the incident happened and is covered and investigated by sheriff Jack (Lee Sorvino) and insurance investigator Angie (Kandyse McClure) results in a very predictable worn out ending.

This is one of those films that did poorly at the box office  understandably  and is something to wait to watch until it is free on late night television re-runs to act as a somnolent. Grady Harp, October 16",1476057600,3,1371,4.579591836734694

6934362,3,B00RQZB78Q,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

This movie offers a chance for teen heartthrob Nick Jonas to show what he can do as an actor. In addition to that it allows him the chance to take off his shirt, a sight sure to please his fans. But as for bringing something new to the table in the way of movies it offers a tried and true formula rather than an inspired thriller. Weve seen it before in one form or another and done better, so we know what to expect with each passing moment.

Jonas plays Doug Martin, the teen son of a well to do couple who are once more spending their summer vacation at their cabin on the lake. Along with his best friend Carson (Graham Rogers) he intends to work at the local seafood restaurant owned by Sheriff Big Jack (Paul Sorvino), study and perhaps find someone to hook up with. All of that changes when the new neighbors move in.

Watching from his bedroom window he is the first to see them, starting with the fetching Lena Harper (Isabel Lucas). Her husband Elliot (Dermot Mulroney) is a well to do self-made millionaire type, a cut throat at business and a natural competitor. The couple meet Doug and his family and soon become friendly enough.

One day in a rainstorm Doug sees Lena stuck outside of the house signaling him to come over. She has locked herself out of the house and needs to get inside. Doug helps by breaking in a window and opening the door for her. She rewards him by seducing him and the two predictably become frequent lovers. Doug hides the fact from everyone, including Carson. It doesnt take long before Lena shows h bruises that she says were inflicted by Elliot. Doug tells her she needs to leave and she promises to talk to Elliot.

Things change one night when Lena calls Doug over to find Elliot sprawled on the floor, his head smashed in. Lena tells him that he attacked her when she asked for a divorce and began beating her, that she was simply defending herself. She then tells him that no one will believe her and asks him to help her get rid of the body. Ruled by hormones of course he helps.

Things take a turn for the worse (as if dead body disposal isn't bad enough) when an insurance investigator arrives who insists on looking into all possibilities before handing over a payment in the millions to Lena. Clues begin to surface and soon Doug is looking at the possibility of being convicted of the murder of Elliot. Is it misfortune or was he set up? If youve seen half a dozen of these thrillers you saw this coming early on.

The film is well made, a quality production rather than a slapped together low budget flick. But the story feels more Lifetime channel movie than feature film. Jonas does a decent job in a role that has him portraying someone too blind to reality letting his late stage puberty do his thinking for him. His acting chops are stretched in no way to play this part. Lucas is an attractive lead who will go nowhere if she limits herself to roles where her exposed body parts are the only reason for getting a role. Mulroney seems to just walk through his part here and deserves better parts than this. Get a new agent Dermot!

If those Lifetime movies entertain you then you're certain to enjoy this one. If you're a fan of Nick Jonas then you might be too young to watch certain aspects of this movie. Like most ex-Disney channel actors he seems to think a more adult role is the way to go. I tend to think taking acting lessons is a better route and accepting roles that require more than what is on display here would be a better method. But then Im not a teen heartthrob with bopper fans clamoring for any and everything I am in. Not bad but nothing exciting either.",1473811200,,3692,4.37956204379562

6934383,2,B00RQZB78Q,"If you were flipping through the channels one night and ran across Careful What You Wish For, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was one of those awful Wild Things or Poison Ivy sequels. The erotic thriller for teeny-boppers cribs from all of those films in just about every way; devious and sexy neighbors, easily manipulated dudes, murder, a-hole rich guys, town sheriffs, and even dogged insurance investigators. It also has 100% more Nick Jonas than all of those other movies did, and seeing the former pop star ply his acting trade may be a draw to some of his fa. They're likely to come away wishing he would just put out another album, though.

Jonas blends into the scenery as Doug, a bookish boat enthusiast spending summer in North Carolina with his family before heading off to college. While his annoying pal (Graham Moore) is obsessed with scoring chicks and getting laid, Doug is a virgin and timid around women. He's hoping this summer will be his chance to finally find some excitement, but BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR!! Dunh dunh dunh!!!!

He gets all the excitement he could ever want when rich investment banker Elliot (Dermot Mulroney) moves in next door with his sexy young wife, Lena (Isabel Lucas). The film teases her getting out of cars, walking with her sun dress billowing in the wind, and catching eyes with Doug at every opportunity. It isn't long before the two are sneaking off to the docks for make-out sessions, or doing it right in the middle of Elliot's house when he's away. Occasionally they even do it in the supermarket with Elliot skulking around like a possessive caveman, which is what Lena claims he is. And a dangerous caveman, at that. When violence erupts and someone ends up dead, Elliot is forced to choose between doing what he knows is right, and doing what his hot girlfriend wants. What do you think he chooses? Of course he chooses the latter. Wouldn't be much of a film if he didn't.

It's still not much of a film, anyway. Director Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum is best known for helming episodes of The Vampire Diaries and Gossip Girl, and she's not called upon to do much beyond what she does on those shows, which is to keep the camera focused on Jonas and Lucas' best assets. She's working from a screenplay that takes a trivial CW-style approach to love, lust, and adultery, through characters that are drawn as broadly as possible. Lucas is absolutely stunning and it's easy to see why any guy that age (or any age, frankly) would do anything she asked, but the performance is so bland that you don't care if she has a hidden agenda. Despite being well into his 20s, Jonas more than fits into the younger role. He's not bad, just fails to make much of an impression, and his sex scenes with Lucas are pretty awkward. This being his first major acting role (unless you count the CampRock films, which you shouldn't) it's not a shock he'd be a little uncomfortable, but the director should have picked up on it rather than letting it slide.

A few meager twists and turns are thrown out there, but if you've seen any of the aforementioned thrillers then they'll be telegraphed a mile away. That said, at least the film is never dull, and there's some pleasure in all of the recycled clichs. It really is like venturing back to a time when it seemed like one of these movies came out every week, but it also serves as a pretty good reminder why they don't anymore.",1470182400,5,3418,4.589198036006547

6934389,4,B00RQZB78Q,"CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR For is a reworking of films like DOUBLE INDEMNITY and BODY HEAT, but, nevertheless, is still fairly entertaining.  It has a couple of surprising twists at the end, one of which comes as a total surprise and another rather unbelievable one that seems like its pandering to a happy ending.

College-bound, naive Nick Jonas joins his parents in a wealthy mountain community to spend the summer.  Moving in next door to the family summer cottage is ultra-rich Dermot Mulroney and his young, beautiful wife, Isabel Lucas.

Mulroney hires Nick to do some repairs on his newly purchased sailboat, then after he goes out of town on a business trip, Isabel seduces the young man and the two begin a torrid affair that climaxes in murder and a subsequent cover-up that slowly goes awry.

Paul Sorvino co-stars as the local sheriff in this thriller; written by Chris Frisina and directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum.

Released onto DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

6934402,4,B00RQZB78Q,"I have seen a lot of less then stellar reviews... but sorry I really enjoyed watching this movie. I hate the Jonas brother's or anything that has to do with Disney because all it is-is trying to get up hype.. Its all about ratings... Nothing more... No the acting isn't that great, but it isn't horrible. I have seen a lot worse acting before. Nick Jonas really is the star of the show which I am surprised because the female lead has been known to do a lot better then what she has in this movie.

It reminds me a lot of the Jennifer Lopez movie Boy Next Door, but to me this is better because you don't ever really see where the boy is the one that is being duped. It is almost always the girl. It is nice to see how easily a women can suck a man into really doing whatever she wants. It is the Gods honest truth as to what can happen in real life and probably has happened many many times before in unsolved crimes that we have out there now. Please watch this movie with an opened mind and don't think it is going to be an A+ movie in acting.... But the plot and storyline are great!!

I do want to add they try to make the female lead look a lot older then she is, but it doesn't work. These two honestly look about the same age. In real life I have no idea how old they really are, but I would have done something like they did in Boy Next Door... Jennifer Lopez is a HOTT woman, haha no I am not into women or anything like that, but I can tell when someone is attractive. Diane Lane in her movie where she has an affair with a younger man was SO much more believable because she was in fact an older looking women with a much younger looking man. All in all I did think it was a really good movie and I will watch it more than once.",1468022400,5,1740,3.9685714285714284

6934407,1,B00RQZB78Q,"More like careful what you pay for (this movie)
This was clearly a vehicle for Nick Jonas to further his career and brand unfortunately or fortunately depending on who you ask it was a flop. A movie you have seen before with a better script.
Mean husband who for all points of interest was not as mean and bad as they tried to make him, jerk yes mean not so much. So mean husband is reportedly abusive to blonde wife who captures the interest of neighborhood youth (Jonas) and they fall in love and after much plotting do away with the mean husband and attempt to live happily ever after covering their tracks.
There was a twist to the end not one you would see coming if you were heavily invested but not one you would yell ""oh my god"" at the tv set either.
And if your watching this to see the Nick Jonas who was singing ""Jealous"" while it is still the same guy here he looks to be younger as if he was breaking out the JOBRO stage.  Eye appealing yea but nothing like he is now.",1467417600,3,981,4.163157894736842

6934414,2,B00RQZB78Q,"Don't bother unless you're under 21 and a guy. CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR is *NOT* a thriller. Not the version I just rented in one of the worst mistakes of Amazon viewing ever.  And really bad acting by everyone except male lead Nick Jonas, and male antagonist, who was ok, given the circumstances, Dermot Mulroney. And another thing: here was way too much ambient mouthbreathing here.

The good bit:  gorgeously filmed. OK, and the sidekick actor, his part was well written, you never knew when he was going to flip from nosey obnoxious buddy to nosey obnoxious threat...but the pacing and acting were so very, very bad, I realized 20 minutes in, I didn't care anymore.

The rest? Horribly acted and apparently, badly directed, teen fantasy film for nobody but guys under 21...masquerading as an adult thriller. A real yawner, any way you look at it.

Hey, I only watched it because I heard everybody's other favorite godfather, GOODFELLAS' Paulie,  Paul Sorvino, had a supporting role. Unfortunately, the otherwise great Sorvino had the least believable country-sheriff-in-a-tourist-town accent ever. Where was that dialog coach?

Also have to disagree with another reviewer who claimed the female lead, who did a truly fascinating turn in a couple of seasons of DEXTER, was memorable here. You could tell she was a great beauty  in the DEXTER series, as well as a fine actress, but here, the acting was zombie-ish, and the look was 180 degrees different than her DEXTER triumph; she was extremely, extremely unhealthy looking, like she'd lost 40 pounds and gotten a boob job that didn't fat, sadly turning a once-beautiful, fine actress into that  skeletal junky skank look. I know the fine actress from DEXTER is still in there somewhere. Hope she rallies and returns in good health and a way better movie.

I did wait for the twist in the end, and it wasn't the one I guessed, but the pacing and acting were so hammy, the twisty twist wasn't any more convincing than the rest of this yawner.",1466899200,,1996,4.844117647058823

8695790,3,B00RQZB78Q,"The title of this film could have several meanings. Aside from the title itself, the movie actually reflects the title in its exploitative promise of a bare all Nick Jonas (didn't happen) and unfolding scenario (highly predictable except for the ending) involving the seduction of a hormonally driven and sexually hungry teenager (Jonas) by a dyed blonde wench (Isabel Lucas) doing her best imitation of a dyed blonde seductress. Married to a multi-millionaire older man (Dermot Mulroney) who is apparently an abusive husband, Lucas traps the willing Jonas in her web and then convinces him to help her cover up the death of hubby which was an ""accident"". A ten million dollar insurance policy and its implications along with the arrival of a female insurance investigator throws a curve ball into their plans. What happens next I leave to the viewer (NO Spoilers here).  Paul Sorvino plays the role of a sheriff with an appropriate humorous edge and Graham Rogers (1 Mile to You, Quantico) is Jonas's equally horny friend. Even though this film has ""a seen it all before feeling"", it does have sufficient eye candy, revealed flesh, intimacy, and a nifty twisted finale to make it a worthwhile viewing.

A couple of sidebar facts: This film was purportedly shelved for three years before it was finally released which is why NJ looks younger than usual.
The DVD version I purchased lists Justin Chatwin as one of the stars. That individual is nowhere to be found in this film or the credits.",1531180800,,1491,4.8893280632411065
