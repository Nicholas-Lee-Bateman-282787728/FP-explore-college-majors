3847283,4,B0024NSFZS,I got these movies for my 2 year old grandson and he loves them.  But to my surprise so does my 7 1/2 year old granddaughter.  They watch them over and over again.

8350771,5,B0024NSFZS,My son can not get enought of the Buddies.  They are his favorite.  He is 7 (about to turn 8) and I feel good about him watching these movies instead of the trash that is on the Disney Channel.,1358380800,,193,3.923076923076923
8350772,5,B0024NSFZS,"I usually know what I want before I look at Amazon but I can't always find what I want in a store.  But so far I have been able to find everything I want on Amazon and at a good price. My grandkids love cetain dvds and a lot of them are just not in the stores anymore. They loved all the Buddies dvds. They liked the Wiggles and I was able to get all the ones they wanted, which was all of them.
I love Amazon.  They are very helpful showing other products I might be interested in.

Thank you Amazon

8350773,5,B0024NSFZS,My 4 year old loves all of the Buddies movies. This set is a great addition to his DVD collection.,1325980800,,98,3.95
8350774,4,B0024NSFZS,"This set of four ""Buddies"" movies has been pretty cute.  The package incldues Air Buddies, Snow Buddies, Space Buddies, and Santa Buddies.  I purchased this during the Christmas season because it contained two winter/Christmas videos in the packaging.  I had not seen any of these DVDs before, and the reviews on them were not all favorable.  After watching them with my 4 and 6 year old children, I have found: a.) the movies are cute and light-hearted and end on a happy note, b.) the movies are obviously not realistic and should be watched as a fun event and not a major drama, c.) my children really loved the videos - especially Space Buddies and Air Buddies.  I will say that sometimes the puppies portrayed are stereotyped with certain attributes- like a rapper - which are not always the best, but my children (who are fairly sheltered) were not bothered by those references.  We did talk about what attitudes were good or bad...as we would after watching any show.  I say relax and watch some cute puppies get into some mischief and then work it all out in the end.",1304899200,,1075,4.626315789473685
8350775,5,B0024NSFZS,"We were in Walmart and my daughter saw a Buddies movie for $20. She wanted it, of course. I told her to wait until we could check Amazon. We found an entire set (4 movies) AND a stuffed puppy for $45. She is VERY happy with our purchase!",1298073600,,237,3.9583333333333335
