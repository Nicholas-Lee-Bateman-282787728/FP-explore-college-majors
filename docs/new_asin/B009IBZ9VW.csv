8541805,5,B009IBZ9VW,I saw the first episode of this heart warming family show in Japan and knew I then that I had to get the series.  This J-Drama is in Japanese with English subtitles(with some rather unwieldy translations).  I found that easy to overlook with the charm and likability of the characters in each of the nine episodes in this two disc set.  It's a wonderful mix of comedy & sadness about dealing with your regrets and growing into a stronger person.  It also brought a whole new perspective about ghosts that we don't normally see in the states.,1378339200,,541,4.546391752577319
