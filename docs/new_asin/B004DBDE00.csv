8558517,5,B004DBDE00,"I have three grandchildren and they all LOVE the Really Wooly DVD series and books! I had the other four DVDs, but had not even seen this one, until I spotted it on Amazon. They were so excited when they saw it! I just wish DaySpring would make more of these because they are great for kids and you don't feel guilty letting them watch them over and over again because it's good Biblical teachings which they don't even realize they're ""learning"" while watching. :) Great video; great price!",1401235200,,491,4.52808988764045
