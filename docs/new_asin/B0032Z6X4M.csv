8387711,1,B0032Z6X4M,i DID NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL. The plot was weak. I am a fan of Luke Mably and he is good in any role he plays.,1367625600,2,108,3.037037037037037
8387712,5,B0032Z6X4M,"This is a fast paced comic thriller that has you loving the main characters and cheering for them to succeed with their scam. I don't know why this wasn't shown in American theaters, it's a terrific movie!",1295740800,3,205,4.5675675675675675
8387713,5,B0032Z6X4M,"This movie was a 'must see' because it featured the very talented Mr. Billy Boyd.  I thought the comedy was refreshing and entertaining.  The 'bad guys' were endearingly 'good' after all, and their journey through crime was a fun ride for me as well.  The tongue-in-cheek account of the world of charitable organizations I found particularly funny.  A special surprise for me was the rendition of Amazing Grace included in the film.  I thought it was absolutely beautiful and very well done.  The end of the film left me wanting to hear more of the soundtrack.",1266969600,3,560,4.78125
8387714,5,B0032Z6X4M,"I had a great time watching SAVE ANGEL HOPE.  There are lots of laughs in this film and also lots of action.  I enjoyed the fast pace of the film.  Just when you think you've figured out how this is going to end, the plot turns again and you are headed in a new direction.  This is a great little film with some fine acting talent.  Billy Boyd is wonderful as Vince, and Bernard Hill turns in an fine performance as a political figure in a tight situation.  Both of these actors have a knack for comedy.  They really should do more of this kind of thing. It's an excellent caper film complete with car chases, set-ups, romance, and nuns. I won't say anything more because I don't want to spoil it for you, but did I mention the nuns?",1266883200,2,733,4.192857142857143
8387715,5,B0032Z6X4M,"I watched this film a few times and it is a fun and well acted film! Billy Boyd is always great fun to watch in any film he is in.  Bernard Hill, Luke Mably and Birthistle were all brilliant in this classic updated cops and robbers movie.  Its a great film for the family to watch together!",1266796800,3,290,4.0701754385964914
