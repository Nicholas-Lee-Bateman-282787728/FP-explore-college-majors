5320785,5,B009DS31ZG,"I'm almost through the second season of NEW TRICKS.
Unless the writers have had brain embolysms, I plan to go the full distance.
The casting is as good as it gets: you will be in love with the four characters within ten minutes into the pilot,
and will enjoy the working out of each character's charm and eccentricity, even more than the narratives themselves.
 Character-driven is a useless term - ""Hamlet, one of Shakespeare's most clearly character-driven plays"" - but when the author is musified by his or her creations, the plot is the least of it. Character is all.

 Applause to the writers, directors, and the exceptional cast. Every night, before my cats and dogs, I dance to NEW TRICKS' theme.

Being seventy-two, of course, helps!",1352851200,44,741,4.811023622047244
5320786,5,B009DS31ZG,"As had been quite clearly flagged up at the end of the previous series, Series 9 included the first change of personnel amongst the four main characters since the show was launched in 2003, as Jack Halford retired from UCOS.  However, he did appear in the first episode just to tidy up the circumstances of his departure.

We had to wait until Episode 4  to meet Jack's replacement,  DI Steven McAndrew played by Denis Lawson.  He is a hard headed Glaswegian who has been drafted in to help the team.  McAndrew is completely different from Jack Halford, and I think the script writers made absolutely the right decision here and it would have been a mistake to try to clone Jack which would have resulted in the inevitable and constant comparisons.

Apparently James Bolam, who played Jack Halford, wanted to leave as he felt the show had become stale.  I would beg to differ as the script writers have continued to come up with some very interesting and varied stories.  For example one involves a murder which took place some 160 years ago - a real cold case!  The team are as interested in the motives for wanting to solve it in after all this time, as the circumstances of the crime itself.  Another is a contemporary case which is not a cold case at all and involves a body turning up in a morgue under a false name. To be fair though, the episodes were a bit more mixed than usual as far as quality went this time round and a couple were quite obscure.

There is a reasonable sprinkling of the private lives of Brian Lane and Gerry Standing, including a particularly hilarious session where Brian has aspirations for his dog to be a star of stage and screen!  However, we learn little of the background of the new recruit until the last episode.  Certainly seeing the main characters away from the job was one of the charms of New Tricks when it was first released and I have felt that this aspect was rather lacking in some of the other series.

As with Series 7 and 8, this series consisted of ten episodes rather than the eight of earlier series.  It is good news that a tenth series of ten episodes has already been commissioned.  However, both Amanda Redman and Alun Armstong who play DS Sandra Pulman, and Brian Lane respectively have said that they will be leaving after the 10th series.  Thus if the show continues it will be quite different with only Gerry Standing played by Dennis Waterman, remaining from the original team. There seem to be strong hints towards the end of this series that any continuation may be with a new UCOS team in Glasgow, Scotland.

When it was launched, New Tricks managed to break new ground which was quite an achievement as police series have been just about done to death from every angle over the years.  I have mixed feelings about whether the show should continue after Series 10.  On the one hand it was very much the main characters who made the show what it was, but on the other hand it would be a shame to see the back of a programme which shines out in a TV schedule which is sadly lacking much of the same calibre.",1350086400,181,3072,4.459749552772808

5320824,5,B009DS31ZG,"The game is afoot in Season Nine of 'New Tricks.'
And so is change.
The long-running English crime series featuring three retired detectives and their boss - played by Amanda Redman - went eight seasons with virtually the same cast but in Season Nine that's no longer the case. One of the detectives announces his retirement with virtually no warning just as the team is - under orders from a much-higher authority - about to tackle the ultimate cold case crime; a murder that took place in the 1850s. The reason for his sudden retirement leads to some very poignant scenes to go along with the normal give-and-take between the detectives and Redman.
Down a man, the team takes on new cases and is soon joined temporarily by a fast-talking Scotman, another retired detective who - despite the fact he is no longer on active duty - is searching for a lost girl. She was presumed dead but he - and the girl's father - never gave up hope that one day she would be found.
Denis Lawson plays the ""new guy"" and he doesn't at first fit in well with the team, especially with former detective Brian 'Memory' Lane, played expertly by veteran actor Alun Armstrong, or Sandra Pullman, Redman's character.
Lawson's character does get on well with Dennis Waterman's roguish portrayal of Gerry Standing, however. Standing was a proper thief taker in his days as a copper, though he was known to break the odd rule or two. Lawson's character is, if anything, even more likely to break the rules in his pursuit of lawbreakers. Together they drive Pullman and Lane to distraction.
I was worried that with a major cast change the quality of this excellent whodunnit would suffer but, thankfully, it did not. To be sure, the Unsolved Crimes and Open Case Squad will never be the same with the addition of Lawson's character but that doesn't mean it will be worse. In fact, it is just as good - and fresher - than it was in the past.",1417564800,,1913,4.580174927113703

5320838,5,B009DS31ZG,This series is the start of the transition of players as Jack retires again.  It is an especially interesting and moving episode where Jack bids farewell but not without humor.  The remainder of the set deals with the new player on the team integrating into the group.  Suffice to say that having a Scottish cop joining the team is an interesting plot concept and seems to work well.  The new boy`s interactions with Brian are very interesting to behold.

5320853,5,B009DS31ZG,"The big news with Season Nine of the perennial favourite NEW TRICKS is that the show is in transition. Beyond the well-publicized and immediate departure of James Bolam in the first episode of this series, it becomes clear as Season Nine progresses that the stage is being set for a virtually new show with Dennis Waterman and Denis Lawson (Bolams replacement) at the centre. This is because Season Ten will see the departure of Alun Armstrong (after episode four) and Amanda Redman (after episode eight). Thats a 75% overhaul but because it is being done gradually, and because the plots are perhaps stronger than theyve been in a while, NEW TRICKS just might pull it off.

There is a very different, more serious tone to some of the episodes here, with the Dennis Waterman-sung, upbeat theme song not used at the end of a handful of the shows. Some very contemporary storylines are thrown into the mix, including such elements as computer hacking. At the heart of the show, however, remains the emphasis on relationships and even though NEW TRICKS is in a state of flux, the viewer doesnt feel let down. Were in the hands of people who understand and respect the long-cultivated relationships fans have with the characters. If the introduction of Denis Lawsons character into the mix is any indication, there may just be new life in NEW TRICKS.

The chemistry between Lawson and Waterman is wonderful and a good part of that is the fact Lawsons Steve McAndrew is light years away from James Bolams irascible Jack Halford. McAndrew is thoughtful, generous, kind and fun. Instantly likeable, he fits into the show with ease and is entirely believable winning over his colleagues.

One episode features Waterman and Lawson on special assignment in Scotland, with neither Alun Armstrong nor Amanda Redman in sight. The episode deals with the abuse of children in care homes and really touched a nerve in the UK when its production coincided with a very public sex scandal involving a childrens entertainer. Recently deceased at the time, Jimmy Savile was known for his charity work and flamboyant public persona. He was a much-loved, high-profile celebrity and the general public in the U.K. felt terribly betrayed when his decades-long abuse of children was revealed. Small wonder the episode was shown at a later date.

The changes of Season Nine are major but not life-threatening. Heres hoping they pave the way for the further, more intense transformation of NEW TRICKS that is to come. I have to say, I cant imagine the show without Amanda Redman front and centre. Season Ten had better be good",1397433600,,2598,4.8977272727272725
5320854,5,B009DS31ZG,I have watched every episode of this series and consider it one of the best of its kind. British tv seems to be better written and acted than American. Too bad the current DVD is limited as to where it can be played or I would order it.,1397260800,,236,3.9375

Changes in both personnel and the show's production left me concerned after the first episode, but as the season progressed I did warm up to Steve McAndrew as he developed into an integral member of the team without attempting to be a direct replacement for Jack Halford or diminish his memory. The series has lost a bit of its charm as the personal lives (and personalities) of the other principal players has received less attention than in past seasons. One can only hope that their development will return to the fore in season ten. Still the show is quite enjoyable and deserving of the high regard in which it is held.",1389052800,,716,4.736

The premise is three retired police officers are asked back to a special program that requires their expertise, intelligence and experience to assist in solving unsolved cases. They return getting paid a minimal, minimal wage, no benefits and are required to drop everything and work sixty hours or more per week. Incredible!

This is what's being sold in the `real world' isn't it? Retiree's are being wooed out of retirement to work for the above mentioned lousey compensation, because they're `appreciated' for their expertise, wisdom, and experience. Balucks! And said retirees returning for that does not equal a `wise' person in my book.

I like the actors and some of the stories are good. The actress that plays Brian's wife, nauseatingly plays a doormat, long suffering wife perfectly. Those episodes are awful and boring.

Their skill in solving these crimes prove intellect, ingeniousness, and grit, heightened by experience are treasures which need not diminish with years. Given that the cast represents mature people, it should have been expected that there would be changes-just as there would be in real life among older individuals. The cases are just as absorbing and the new characters/cast members, just as intriguing as those who came before.
Special mention must be made of the fact that now that the cast is changing, the writers are making more of the previously underestimated Anthony Calf as DAC Strickland, and a truly terrific actor named Tim McInnerny as Stephen Fisher, villainous high level intelligence operative. He is such a talented villain that I was amazed to find he had starred in the comedy, Blackadder. I hope these two actors are being given increasingly large parts as the series progresses. They are greatly helping to sustain interest as the production goes through its current permutations.
Its natural that viewers would be attached to the players and the group dynamics to which they have become accustomed.

Heck in real life people often are neurotic in at least some way.  I don't mind a focus on the crimes, but I'd like a balance with the personal lives of the investigators just like in the early episodes.  What is Amanda's brother up to?  What is her mother doing nowadays?  Her love life was just the usual so I could do without that.  Where is the comedy?  Life is often not just serious but plenty plenty to laugh about, especially later when the drama is over.

5320909,5,B009DS31ZG,"As had been quite clearly flagged up at the end of the previous series, Series 9 included the first change of personnel amongst the four main characters since the show was launched in 2003, as Jack Halford retired from UCOS. However, he did appear in the first episode just to tidy up the circumstances of his departure.

We had to wait until Episode 4 to meet Jack's replacement, DI Steven McAndrew played by Denis Lawson. He is a hard headed Glaswegian who has been drafted in to help the team. McAndrew is completely different from Jack Halford, and I think the script writers made absolutely the right decision here and it would have been a mistake to try to clone Jack which would have resulted in the inevitable and constant comparisons.

Apparently James Bolam, who played Jack Halford, wanted to leave as he felt the show had become stale. I would beg to differ as the script writers have continued to come up with some very interesting and varied stories. For example one involves a murder which took place some 160 years ago - a real cold case! The team are as interested in the motives for wanting to solve it in after all this time, as the circumstances of the crime itself. Another is a contemporary case which is not a cold case at all and involves a body turning up in a morgue under a false name. To be fair though, the episodes were a bit more mixed than usual as far as quality went this time round and a couple were quite obscure.

There is a reasonable sprinkling of the private lives of Brian Lane and Gerry Standing, including a particularly hilarious session where Brian has aspirations for his dog to be a star of stage and screen!

5320917,1,B009DS31ZG,"Scripts with each successive season get less and less plausible; less complex; more soap opera formula like. There is less intelligent investigative work by the team with the shows' script writers just picking what's currently newsworthy as the focal plots or even worse a plot that is too bizarre to be real (e.g. the first episode of a 150 year old case). Getting poorer still are the usual quick endings with abrupt confessions by the guilty from just a few, less than incisive, questions (this season there seems to always be a lawyer, who is always unnaturally silent, sitting next to the confessor). Even a grade schooler could handle this level of questioning when caught cheating by a teacher. The coup de grce is the acting that is bland, non-committal, and without the early season's wit. A tiredness which shows up in the actors' expressions and demeanor. Even the guest actors lack a depth-of-character - like a cheap mass produced plastic toy. I can see why the actors are leaving and the show is dying a too late unnatural death.

There were years when I looked forward to each new season now I look forward to a nice burial. I can only imagine the die-hard fanatics as just junk-food, soap opera junkies.",1374364800,,1219,4.75

5320920,3,B009DS31ZG,"I fell in love with this show during the pilot episode.  The character interactions really had me hooked from the very beginning.  I loved watching how Jack, Gerry and Brian would educate the Guv'nor on how to investigate the ""old school"" way.  And I loved seeing the boys learn the new modern tricks of investigation.  For me, the character stories were what made this show a joy to watch.

After streaming Series 8, I was so impatient I purchased Series 9 to see what happened next.  Naturally, I was devastated to see Jack leave for good but I found his exit to be well written.  The interaction between the remaining team seemed diminished so I was looking forward to a new arrival to stir things up.  The new guy is OK but I could already see they were going away from the original premise of the show.  Dennis Lawson is running and jumping around with ease.  I see no reason why he retired from the force.

And suddenly the team is taking on more recent cases.  Gone is the idea of working on long-dead cold files.  Yes, New Tricks is gradually turning itself into one of the many version of the Law & Order.  As such, my interest has waned as each new episode progressed.  When I reached the last two episodes and saw how they focused only on Waterman and Lawson I couldn't even watch them.  It was then I realized the show I loved was gone for good.  It's sad but it was fun while it lasted.

5320931,5,B009DS31ZG,"If you've come to this review of Season Nine of ""New Tricks"" you obviously know the series, so I don't need to repeat what I've said in my reviews of the previous eight seasons. (Now, if by chance, you haven't seen the earlier ones, go back to  Season One and start there - do not pass Go <g>- as it's best that way.  Now on to Season 9 ......

I don't like ""spoilers"" especially with mysteries and so, when I get each new season I just put the discs in and watch, with reading the package. Of course, there was something odd when I looked at front of this one - there was a new face and ""Jack was missing"". So that was a ""spoiler"" already but I didn't know how he'd leave. (Let me say up front that I didn't search the web for answers. I wanted surprise.) I won't tell you how he leaves but I do like the new guy (Denis Lawson - who works well with Dennis Waterman from the original team). In fact - it's not really a spoiler - but one episode centers on the two Dennis's and - oddly - they don't even list Amanda and Alun in the opening titles!

The other thing I noticed right off is that Amanda Redman - as Sandra - seems to be wearing looser clothes and her face is fuller and the camera angles such that you often see her from the back.  I wondered if she was pregnant during the filming this season. I haven't researched this either - I just went with the flow. Just an observation.

There are already other reviews here which are much more detailed - especially the one by Harold ""Doc"" Wolf - that details each episode. I don't read those until after I've seen the Season as - again - the real fun is in discovering things - not reading spoilers.  I will say that the stories have a variety to them this time, missing in last few seasons. Lots of police corruption and international intrigue plus ""local"" murders. (These are not ""spoilers"".)

The Special Features are two short (5 and 6 minute) featurettes. One about the new character and the other about shooting scene in Episode 10. Both feature interviews with  the two Dennis/Denis actors and comments from the actor who plays the UCOS boss Strickland. Nice addition but not essential.

I know there is a Season 10 now - and I read in one review that there are more cast changes (but I don't want to know who is leaving). I'll  just wait till it comes out from RLJ (the new owner of Acorn Video)

5320932,5,B009DS31ZG,"I just received season 9 in the mail. I was a little worried as I found season 8 less enjoyable than previous seasons and wondered if the show would still work with James Bolam gone. However actor Denis Lawson is a breath of fresh air. The stories in this season were very good and I am looking forward to season 10 despite the fact that 2 more cast members are leaving. I look forward to seeing what Nicholas Lyndhurst will bring to the mix. If you have enjoyed previous seasons of New Tricks go ahead and buy season 9, you won't be disappointed.",1369699200,2,547,4.320388349514563
5320933,5,B009DS31ZG,"As strong a cop/humor show as ever. Since 2003, this fast-pace old-guy investigation team is led by buxom blonde DS Pullman (Amanda Redman- `Little Dorrit'). They are handed cases from the past, unsolvable, but now new evidence suggests this Unsolved Crimes & Open Case team can get the job done right. Not without few mess-ups along the way, plus plenty of humor mingled with suspense. The episodes are now filled with many guest stars; a few are noted in the episode synopsis below. No end in sight for this great BBC small screen hit. Season 9 saw one regular team member leave, but is soon replaced. You may like the replacement even better.

Regular cast supporting Redman:
Alun Armstrong ... Brian Lane
James Bolam ... Jack Halford who leaves after the first episode
Steve McAndrew ... Denis Lawson
Dennis Waterman ... Gerry Standing
Susan Jameson ... Esther Lane, Brian's wife
Anthony Calf ... D.A.C. Robert Strickland

SDH SUBTITLES  for all 10 episodes, each about an hour.

Episode 1--A Death in the Family ---Jack decides to quit as they investigate an 1851 murder. Even Strickland asks why agent Fisher's (Tim McInnerny- `Notting Hill') pushing this ancient case.  McInnerny guest stars in the final episode as well.

2--Old School Ties ---A teacher disappeared but now there's a body. Plenty of staff strife and school finances to cause suspicion. Archie the Latin teacher (Brian Pettifer- `Doc Martin) & Eliz Clayton (Susannah Harker- `Young James Herriot').
A dialogue quote for this episode: ""Whether you like it or not, Jack has gone.""

3--Queen and Country ---Suicide or murder? Cover-up? A multi-crime solving involving a set of twins (Sharon Small) and Hammond by James Wilby (Island at War).

4--The Girl Who Lived ---Teenage Scot missing girl's DNA found at a London robbery. Retired Glasgow detective Steve McAndrew assists the now shorted handed UCOS team. Ken Wright played by Sean McGinley (bleak House; Braveheart).

5--Body of Evidence ---Computer geek ex-cop Longthorn uncovered at a teaching hospital. A cadaver surprise. UCOS computer man, Brian, has issues with the new team player, McAndrew, a Scot with brogue. See Prof. Blake get played by Alex Jennings (Cranford).

6--Love Means Nothing in Tennis ---Did tennis champion jump to her death? Plenty of suspects suggest she was pushed. Sports mom Victoria (Tamzin Outhwaite) and dad David (Brendon Doyle- `Downton Abbey') are just 2 of the guest stars..

7--Dead Poets ---Charred poet Doherty case reopened. Brian takes a poetical lead in this investigation. Sarah (Simone Lahbib- `Downton Abbey'; `Monarch of the Glen'), a tutor and lover, is suspect. Mara is played by Bronagh Gallagher (Sherlock Holmes).

8--Blue Flower ---While bleeding to his death, an East German (Edward Baker-Duly- `Downton Abbey') stated 'Blue Flower'. Grace (Elizabeth Berrington- `Crimson Petals and the White') seems involved somehow. DCI Rosser played by Nicholas Burns. A history with secret police may hold the clues needed. Arguably, it is the best episode of 9th season.

9--Glasgow UCOS ---A new UCOS established I Glasgow causes Gerry & Steve being sent up north to strengthen the start-up. A haggis nightmare for Gerry. 1st case forces Steve to face an old Scot adversary. Guests: DCI MacDougal (Kate Dickie), Helen Wray (Sandy McDade- `Larkrise to Candleford'); Mr. Ogilvy (Ralph Riach- `Young James Herriot'; `Monarch of the Glen').

10--Part of a Whole ---A bomb attempt on Fisher. Is Strickland next? What's the connection? It's a very old cse and extremely personal. Jane Ross played by Kerry Fox (Cloudstreet).",1368576000,2,3587,5.2264808362369335
5320934,5,B009DS31ZG,"I swear this is no better show than this!1 I love the New Tricks group and even though some changes occurred this season, it was well done and just fantastic!!",1368489600,,159,4.333333333333333
5320935,4,B009DS31ZG,"i did not really mind losing jack halford to a new character.  jack was always the weakest of the three men for me as a character.  what i have missed though is all the warm and human touches regarding Brian's and Gerry's personal lives.  they are very rich characters and their home lives mirrored this.  their families were a vital part to their characters and this has been pared down.  amanda's personal life, by contrast, i don't mind paring down.

this has always been a deft blend of comedy and crime.  it is three seniors and the woman cop demoted to handling them.  the three seniors are retired cops who now work cold cases.  the two funniest characters are Gerry and Brian.  Gerry is a lightening rod for women, despite now being a senior, and he has numerous ex wives, children and grandchildren, all still on the scene to bedevil his life.  Brian is obsessive in every facet of life.  this can lead to psychiatric and alcoholic problems but they mainly remain under control.  This obsessive quality is very handy for solving their cases. his long suffering wife Hester is a treasure.

the show is at its very best when these two characters are fully utilized in all their facets as developed in previous seasons.  this was the only weakness in season nine.  they were under utilized, particularly in episodes involving British Intelligence getting in on their act.

5320936,5,B009DS31ZG,This one of our favorites!!!  We gather up our dinner and head for our evening of English mystery. great entertainment!!!,1364428800,2,121,5.05
5320937,3,B009DS31ZG,"Several people including the actors have stated that the show has become stale.  That is the reason James Bolam (Jack) stated for why he left this season. It is also the reason, posted throughout the internet, that Redman and others will be leaving after season 10.

The problem is not staleness (doing the same thing) but rather they got rid of any and everything that made this show fun.  Gone are Jerry's wifes and kids, gone is Brian's dog and Esther barely makes an appearance every couple of shows.  The show has the feel of a job (we've all been there) that has had a change of management and ever body now has to tow the company line.... no more fun, nor more excitement...let's get rid of all and any employee morale. Lawson's McAndrew replaced Jack in episode 4 (and except for a brief dinner with Esther) had little or no fanfare.  Here was an opportunity for several episodes of him interacting with the team in various funny situations.  Can you imagine McAndrew with Gerry's wifes...it would have been hilarious. But nothing happened.

Even the office has changed for the worse.  At some point the open area surrounded by the three desks with Pullman's office to the side has been replaced with a cramped area filled with Hawaii 5.0 styled glass-illuminated tables and fancy side walls with data.  The old-style stand-alone boards are gone.  Remember the pilot with photographs falling from the board.  Isn't this the premise of the show, ex-cops solving cold cases with their experience, using left-over equipment and nothing fancy.

The shows kept getting worse and worse.  Don't get me wrong, if you like British procedural crime show, then keep watching, but if you want to watch a fun, charming show with quirky characters...this season is not it.  The episode, Dead Poet, was the perfect example.  The team gets the case, they interview several super-snooty British characters and solve the case.  The scene with Brian reading poetry to Esther lasted less than a minute and was not funny, charming, or illuminating.  In fact, the next day when Brian told his peers about his romantic evening with Esther it seemed to fall on deaf ears...no jokes, no fun.

The episode, A Part of a Whole, is basically Strickland and his boss, the obnoxious Fisher (from A Death in the Family) and their little MI-5 undercover group. Super boring!!!!  Strickland's role is solely to give the UCOS team their assignments and keep them in line.  Unless the UCOS team is making fun of Strickland, he is not funny or interesting enough to carry an entire episode.

New Tricks fans are fanatic and will continue to give the show 5 stars regardless. I am a super fan as well, but I can't honestly give this show 5 stars.  I remember watching Magnum P.I....never missed an episode.  However, the last season was all about his past as a Navy Seal in Vietnam.  The show became serious and dramatic. I didn't care how cute Magnum was, I completely lost interest.  That's how I feel about New Tricks, season 9.",1363478400,51,3001,4.758220502901354
5320938,5,B009DS31ZG,""" New Tricks"" is One of the best British mysteries on the market.  I have enjoyed all nine seasons and hope there will be
more to come.  The stories center around a police unit that deals with cold cases and unsolved crimes.  It is staffed by three
retired , but very experienced detectives and headed by a younger, but mature woman who keeps everyone on their toes.
It is a very clever, witty and zany series and there is very often a surprise conclusion, adding extra suspense.  The characters all have strong personalities and all have their particular brand of problems which adds to the various scenarios.  The cast are seasoned actors and bring their many talents to the series.  I can highly recommend ""New Tricks"" to anyone who like mystery and drama.  The series also comes with closed captioning which is helpful as some of the British accents are hard to understand and thus catch the many subtleties presented in the dialogue.",1358553600,12,938,4.717791411042945
5320939,5,B009DS31ZG,"Already brilliant writing took a step up in quality. Plots make more sense and are more realistic and characters a little more rounded with sometimes surprising twists to their familiar natures. The crimes are closer to today, so we care more because the families and friends have a bigger stake in getting the crimes solved. Even the very first case, about a crime in the late 1800s, has a surprising modern importance.",1356652800,10,420,4.847222222222222

8540424,1,B009DS31ZG,I can't finish the series without Jack. I near died after the first episode. It was beautifully scripted and acted but it felt like a REAL death and I can't get beyond it. I gave it one star because this is one of my fav British dramas and I prefer happy endings. The Scot that replaces Jack - they shouldn't have bothered.
