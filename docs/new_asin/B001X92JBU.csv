8347584,3,B001X92JBU,"This movie was filmed in Hollywood in 2000, released in the Netherlands on DVD in 2001 under the title ""Beyond the city limits"", then finally released in the USA under the title ""Rip it Off"" in 2003. This is a very underrated film, it may have its flaws but I found the performances of the 3 female leads good enough to make it a reasonably good film, and viewers should take in to consideration the fact that this is only Gigi Gaston's second attempt at directing. The main flaw is in the poor editing, in watching this film I get the feeling that alot of good scenes were left on the cutting room floor. I would love to see a ""Directors Cut"" version of this film released with all these scenes restored.",1247616000,,705,4.348484848484849
