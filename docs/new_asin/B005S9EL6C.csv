4868455,5,B005S9EL6C,"I loved the dancing and the story was really not bad at all. Also, the acting was better than the previous 2 movies. It was almost on par with the first movie. I have watched it a few times already!",1353715200,,198,3.975
4868456,5,B005S9EL6C,Best movie and dancing is great too that goes good with the other 3 step up movies!  This has my  best actress in it.,1352505600,2,117,3.8333333333333335
4868457,4,B005S9EL6C,"The movie is a must see! I loved all the dance scenes, definitly not what I expected. Seen all other step up movies and thought nothing can beat the first one or Channing. Male dancer did a great job acting and dancing. Male dancing did not need a step in for tuff moves, he did it all!! I'd like to see him battle Channing in a future movie. The only downfall I had was the love connection wasn't there. Definitly attraction but not love. I still give it a four, being this is a dance movie. I'm just a sucker for a love story! Overall great job! Hope there is a part 5",1349222400,,570,4.053097345132743
4868458,5,B005S9EL6C,"If you take this movie story line for what it is, I can safely say I enjoyed this movie more than any I've seen recently.  Others say it's wierd that the ""Mob"" starts dancing in odd times and places, but isn't that what this movie is about?  I didn't see anything wrong with the acting; the story was fine. I just absolutely loved the dancing scenes. It was fun that the movie started with the 'kids' doing a performance art dance in the middle of the street. And I loved the costumes they wore when they danced in the office scene.",1346630400,31,532,4.257425742574258
4868459,5,B005S9EL6C,"I went into the movie theater without seeing any of the Step Up movies, I know crazy how have i not seen a movie with Channing Tatum in it, but as I was saying I saw this movie without seeing any of the predecessors and I actually loved it so much. At first I didn't really like the female lead but she grew on me as the movie carried on and the lesson behind the story was really great. The dances were really great and i would seriously be so excited whenever a new dance was about to start and my adrenaline would start racing and i couldn't like stop watching I just wanted them to keep doing dances. The movie was really great and I loved it and it made me watch the other movies as well. Seriously go see this movie whether or not you have or have not seen the past movies. I also did see it with two of my friends who have seen the other movies and they said it was there favorite out of all the movies.",1344470400,13,910,3.978142076502732
4868460,3,B005S9EL6C,"This is the latest Step Up movie and it has taken a whole new showcase for dancing talent. There are no more school performances. No more battles. No more dance competition?!?! What do we have now? We have flash mobs!!! (A group of people dancing at random places and times.)

The main story is the same as the last 3 movies - boy meets girl and falls in love. And that's fine, that's what Step Up is with dancing. I felt that they needed to build up the characters even more for people to really care about them. The love interest wasn't that interesting to me. At the end, I didn't care if the guy and girl got back together either way. They needed to show the people why they really needed to be together. All we saw was that they like to flirt around with each other. They like dancing with each other. They both are into The Mob. But...does that really mean they needed to be together? I said, not really. I see attraction. I see lust. And, even affection. But, I don't see love.  So, they needed to develop the characters even more and replace it with less dancing.

I thought the dancing was great at first, but after watching it about 3/4 of the movie, I realized there are way too much dancing! It's so repetitive! Since there's no dance competition in the movie, I just saw the same dancers over and over again. Sure, they are dancing different songs, doing different moves, and have different themes, but it still fails to keep my interest. Too much can be a bad thing too and this is an example of too much dancing! Even during the movie, they said it themselves, ""the only way they know how to expressed ourselves is withhhhhh...dancing! All I thought was ""OMG, NOT AGAIN!"" ""Oh HELL NO!"" ""Here we go again.""

Again, they should really develop the characters more. Why should I give a damn, if I don't really know much about them? Oh, just because the movie said show me a bit of something, doesn't mean I'm going to really go along with that idea. I don't think so!!!

The music. They really could had used better music. I only liked the first and last few songs. The rest of the songs, I didn't care for.

You don't need to watch this movie in 3D. This movie is fine in 2D because it's just not that good. The 3D effects just is an extra additional part, but won't make it any better than previous Step Ups.

In this Step Up movie, they do like they always do by trying to connect the last Step Up movie somehow. This was done by having Twiitch in the movie and a few other dancers did a cameo from the last movies. I believe they should not have done it this way and actually used one or two more previous dancers and make a movie with them in it. Maybe the previous dancers all could had build up a story where they wanted to now do Flash mobs and that's how come we are now seeing this new direction, but nooo it's not like that. We just got introduced to a few new faces that I just didn't connect with and hated them.

But don't get me wrong. I love Step Up movies! The first three movies were amazing great! And still, my favorite Step Up movie is the 3rd movie! That one was so well done with all the characters, story line, music, and dancing. Maybe it was so well done that every Step Up movie that will follow it will always do bad because they can never match up to greatest. Yet, another reason why, this 4th movie wasn't as good.

Final thoughts, I think people should save their money. This movie is only worth renting. It's a must see for sure for any Step Up movie fan, but it's NOT a must buy.",1343779200,5,3524,4.239940387481371
4868461,5,B005S9EL6C,"'Step-Up-Revolution' reminded me very much of the Amazing Performance I admired in 'West Side Story.' Both showings have a Good theme. Also, I felt that the dancing was as Professional and Addicting as much as it was in 'Dirty Dancing.' The Music in this movie was Breathtaking and the Acting Performance Excellent. The theme here is the Dancer's life. Emily arrives in Miami to fulfill her dream of becoming a professional dancer as she falls in love with Sean. Her soul-mate leads a dance crew called 'The Mob.' After The Mob's neighborhood is threatened, Emily, Sean, and The Mob join together to turn Performance Art into Protest Art as they risk losing their dreams to fight for a Greater cause. I had flashbacks about the Protest I viewed in 'West Side Story.' Even the Last Dance in 'Dirty Dancing' wasn't just symbolic of love, it was also a Protest dance to show the world how strong they believed as they united to send a message. Regardless of the reason for Protest in all 3 films, the Dancing and Acting was Sensational, Enjoyable, and Entertaining from start to finish. Highly Recommended!",1343347200,21,1103,4.810526315789474

4868566,4,B005S9EL6C,"As  good as any Step Up movie ever is.  They are clearly not meant for serious and dramatic viewing but they are fun nonetheless.  I think the dancing in this one is great, and that what really counts.",1506902400,,201,4.2368421052631575

4868570,5,B005S9EL6C,"A fun & thoughtfully unique twist to the Step Up series. I liked how along with the familiar characters, peer/friend conflict, dance story line, and live story there was more. A creative, yet thoughtful twist. Dance was used to convey an important message...
That no matter how small your voice may be there are different ways to make yourself heard. In this case, The Mob. I won't ruin the story, but needless to say, if you like Steep Up this is a MUST see! Great characters, great dancing, and a great creative story! You will not be disappointed. So get the movie and...
ENJOY!!!
I know I did!",1499904000,,597,4.537037037037037

4869122,5,B005S9EL6C,"First of all, if you're expecting oscar-worthy performances, then look elsewhere.  This movie doesn't promise to be anything more than a dance-inspired, entertaining movie, and it delivers.  In my opinion, this one is the best of the franchise, to include the latest one.  The soundtrack is awesome, and will have you, if not dancing, at least moving along with the cast.  The only down side to the ""official"" soundtrack is that it does not include every song that appears in the movie (I had to search on the internet for an entire listing of the soundtrack and purchase elsewhere, or here on amazon).  The story is repectable and believable.  The actors are very attractive and talented.  Plus, if you are watching this movie on an HD screen, some of the scenes are visually stunning (shot mainly in Miami).  I love this movie and every time I watch it, I enjoy it even more.",1428278400,,877,4.686274509803922

Corniest dialogue and a worthless story.  Everybody gawks and sighs and watches in a state of awe as these gangs of weirdos flash mob and dance off and invade real life.  Come on, now.  Nobody cares to see dancers interrupting life.  It's just annoying.  GET A JOB!

This movie is terribly unrealistic.  It's a look-at-us-everybody production in desperation.

In real life, we have to get to work or home to our kids or to REAL lives that include dates, games, sports, etc.  These whacko dance machines would be chased off by police.

Also, how do these guys not get arrested for impersonating police in the end?  Furthermore, for doing the robot!  Shouldn't you be arrested for dancing the robot?  It's the 2000's!",1416182400,,933,4.725

I have to say my favorite part (besides the ending dance) was the dance routine in the Fine Art's Museum. It was seriously cool, 'specially the jellyfish room ^_^. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes dance movies.",1397520000,,373,5.032258064516129

4869489,5,B005S9EL6C,This is an awesome movie. It shows creativity in dancing and in how they leave there signs. It shows how to make a statement about what they care about.,1396310400,,152,4.275862068965517

I see no place to ask for this to be corrected but hopefully someone from amazon sees this review and if not now others are informed of the risk...some don't need digital copies but we use them frequently when traveling.,1395964800,,483,4.438202247191011

At first as an adult I was skeptical, but as the time elapses I got caught by the excitement and the music and chorography. I will certainly repeat it and I am 62 years old with sophisticate  tastes. I mean my tendency is towards more serious dramas. But this movie made have a good time. 3D is awesome.",1395360000,,405,4.1265822784810124

4869553,5,B005S9EL6C,This is the best Step Up movie of the series. The dance sequences will blow your mind. I don't know how they will top this movie with #6.,1393545600,,137,3.9285714285714284
4869554,4,B005S9EL6C,"You do not watch the Step Up movies for story, you would gag over the sappy, people from different worlds coming together in the name of love (and dancing), and some other third thing. Sure there are plot threads that you can drive a 16-wheeler through (maybe even the Titanic), but they have awesome dance sequences, in which the choreography is stellar. If they can make a Step Up movie without a story, or make it where the dancing IS the story, that would be fine.",1391904000,,468,4.453488372093023
4869555,3,B005S9EL6C,"I borrowed this movie for my wife who loves all the dancing/stomp movies.

The story is extremely predictable, to the point where it almost seems like they used the standard formula. Guy works at dead end job with little ambition, contest to raise money motivates him and his dance crew, he meets a girl (boss' daughter), they dance together and work towards and end goal. That sums up about 99% of the movie, which is like almost every other dance move.

The dance sequences are by far the best part. They are well choreographed and the camera work is spectacular. Some of the dance moves are a bit questionable--lacking--but this is to be expected when some of the scenes are 5 to 10 minutes long.

Would I watch it again? Probably not, but it kept me entertained enough to at least watch it all the way through once.",1391731200,,819,4.52027027027027

4869601,5,B005S9EL6C,Much like Fast and the Furious the franchise refuses to retire. After the first Step Up movie this one is my favorite. The budget is much bigger so the sets and dance sequences are much more entertaining and captivating.

4869638,3,B005S9EL6C,"trying too hard to create a drama, that it interfered with the only point of a dance movie, the dancing. the political commentary was too much, I don't mind a story of an underdog who can dance, but don't take on more than can be believed. yea it's a story, and we can imagine a lot, but not that a dance troupe can take on a banker.",1386892800,,333,3.985074626865672

The reason why I gave it three stars is because of the DVD packaging. When I first received it, I was a bit concerned that i had purchased a bootleg version accidentally.

It is usually obvious within 15 minutes of these shows that you have reached the pinnacle (and how low it is!) of every theatrical aspect EXCEPT dancing. These kids my not be the best actors on the planet but brother they can move! Of the four I have seen, this by far had the consistently best presentation. The second had a great close (that water scene was bad @$$!) but this show had it plugged in and turned up for every dance scene. The styling for the scene in the restaurant where they dance to Skylar Grey was crazy good and EVERYTHING about the art show scene was superb! That jellyfish ballerina bit was mesmerizing, truly. The final dance scene was some of the most 'fun' I've seen through the whole series. Where can I get one of those sparking sticks?",1372896000,,843,4.410256410256411

4869882,4,B005S9EL6C,"When I'm busting a sick move in the club and wowwing the honies with m- aw, hell, who am I kidding? I can't dance for crap. I tried to do the Cabbage Patch one time and got a nose bleed. But I do love me the Step Up movies; they're some of my guilty pleasures. STEP UP REVOLUTION places fourth in the franchise, and while I wasn't sure I'd be into it, maybe because it forgoes the dance contest theme, it turns out, there's a different but equally absorbing competition taking place.

The city of Miami is being rocked by a series of flash mobs performed by a mysterious dance crew styling itself ""The Mob."" The news and social medias are quick to latch on to this phenomenon, and soon The Mob has gone viral and become the talk of the town.

21-year-old Emily (Kathryn McCormick) arrives in Miami, determined to pursue her dream of becoming a professional dancer. Informed by a prestigious dance academy that her technique lacks passion, she's drawn to Sean (Ryan Guzman), a waiter and street dancer and co-founder of - yes, you guessed it - The Mob. Out comes The Mob's motivation: YouTube has launched a contest in which the first YouTube channel to receive ten million hits is awarded the prize of $100,000. At present, The Mob is in second place, behind some singing cat.

But then the narrative introduces a bigger picture as a real estate magnate (Peter Gallagher) threatens to tear down Sean's historic waterfront neighborhood. Can The Mob's protest dances rally the beleaguered community and influence the land developer? Can they win the YouTube contest? Will the Winwood Dance Academy think better of Emily's technique and select her as a student? And where the hell can I get a clip of that singing cat?

If you accept that this film stands by its STEP UP formula, that it limits itself to by-the-numbers storytelling, then you'll have massive fun watching this. Don't anticipate the two leads to be acting prodigies. Kathryn McCormick comes from a professional dancing background and had never acted before, and I think she's swell. Ryan Guzman was a model and had dabbled in acting, but had never danced before. The important thing to me is that what they do here seems to come from the heart. It's enough for me that they look good and have chemistry together and that their dancing is top notch. Ryan is phenomenal, given that he'd never danced before. But it wasn't until the scene when he was teaching his cute little niece the ""Ocean, Motion"" move that I decided I liked his character. It's a really sweet scene. Later, I tried doing the ""Ocean, Motion,"" and, yep, nose bleed.

The choreographers try their dang best to impress you. The flash mob sequences are amazing, striking stuff, particularly the sequences at the art gallery, at the restaurant, and at the council meeting (my favorite). Keeping up with tradition, Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss provides the thru line, returning as ""Jason."" And, of course, when the big finale requires extra dancers, Jason doesn't hesitate to reach out to his old crew from STEP UP 3D. So expect cameo appearances from a few STEP UP favorites. The flash mob finale at the shipyard throws everything at you. It incorporates several props and culminates in a moving duet between McCormick and Guzman. ""With the power of dance I realize the value of this community,"" confesses Peter Gallagher in an interview. Oops, was that just a spoiler?

Tried multiple times. Haven't tried on a regular DVD player though.,1368921600,,314,4.163934426229508

4870021,4,B005S9EL6C,"I have enjoyed the earlier Step-Up movies for the simple reasons that the dancing is incredible.  They perform things with fluidity that I've never seen anywhere else and it is quite impressive.  While they follow a basic boy meets girl type storyline (hard to do anything else for this genre), it is fast paced, the dancing is actually pushed up a notch and visually it has stunning moments.",1365638400,,392,4.75

I hope they keep making them.

4870077,5,B005S9EL6C,"The story line is ok, but the dancing is amazing.  Just like the other step ups, the dancing is the best part of the movie.  I'm in awe of these very talented people.  Don't expect any meaningful or enlightening dialogue, but who cares, I'm mesmerized by the movement.  I could watch that type of dancing all day long.  It's so creative.  I recommend it!",1365120000,,354,4.453125

4870081,4,B005S9EL6C,"This is a good dance movie. It goes along the same lines as the earlier step up movies. Not much of a story line, but worth watching if you like to see some serious hip hop dancing.",1364860800,,181,3.918918918918919

I Love all the Step Up movies. However this one in choreography, vision, creativity, design, etc, will blow your mind away.

The dance movie sequence, scenes, and creativity were Excellent. My best three best dance segments are: the museum, the business, and the end.

If you love dancing and particularly if you enjoy Latin American rhythms you are truly going to love this movie.  I have also purchased, in he past, the other previous movies in this genre and loved them as well, but this one I found is exceptional.

I love the concept in the art museum!!  Yes the dancing is done in ""weird"" places but that is the point to their sensationalism in trying to win the contest.  Would their videos have that many hits if they'd danced in dance room setting?

The acting is decent.

The ending is the weakest part of the plot (not the dancing part but the actual plot).  It's kind of sappy.  I did have to laugh though when the mayor starting getting into it when the girls started dancing.  Again, sappy but funny.

I should of given it four stars for the ending but I just like the dancing too much :)",1361664000,,636,4.322033898305085

There are many curvy, beautiful girls (just like the real Miami) and some hypersexualized dancing scenes.  But there isn't any sex.  If the kids are young and you don't want to expose them to a lot of skin and ""booty gyrations"" then don't watch it, but if you aren't bothered by that, it's a cute little show.

4870526,3,B005S9EL6C,"Warning: spoilers for the romantic side plot.

I've watched the other Step Up movies at least twice. While the acting and plot wasn't perfect, the first three did a decent job at getting you attached to at least one of the lead dancers. And I watched them all in one sitting.

This one however, was different. I didn't feel attached to the main dancers and I didn't feel attached to the plot. I didn't really care if the main characters won or not or stopped Anderson from building his hotel. I kept going: ok, get to the next mob so that I can see the dancing. And the story was moving so slowly that I didn't feel bad about stopping in the middle of the movie to go do something else. I did eventually finish it. I wanted to see Moose come in and dance.

The more I think about it, the more the reason why came to light. Because it pulled the same plot device Step Up 3D did. Female lead dancer is related to the bad guy in the film and fails to keep it a secret and the revealing of the secret will be what kicks off the climax of the movie. And the secret coming out leads to the band of dancers breaking up and until the lead male gets over it, the band of dancers just can't seem to move on.

If the creators of this movie read this: find a new plot device! In three of the four Step Ups a fight between the lead dancers is the start of the climax of the movie. Step Up 2 the Streets is my favorite of the Step Up movies. Because it doesn't use the romantic sub plot as the problem that kicks off the climax of the movie.

Step Up 3D is my second favorite and close to the top because you did something different. The story wasn't just focused on the male and female lead dancers. It also focused on Moose and his relationship with his best friend.

We know going in that the plot is secondary to the dancing, it's a dance movie. But give us an interesting plot with some new twists. Don't be afraid to shake things up.",1359244800,,1925,4.092838196286472

4870529,5,B005S9EL6C,"My wife and I like dancing movies and shows (i.e. So You Think You Can Dance) and after being dissapointed with Step Up 3d I didn't know what to expect of this movie until I watched it. The main girl in the movie started her career first on the Fox TV show SYTYCD and she is hot. The dancing throughout the movie was great, it had the kind of music I like and the plot was much better than step up 3. My previous favorite was Step Up 2 but I think after watching this one, Step Up Revolution is now my favorite. The last 10-15 minutes of the movie are by far the best of the series.

A side note, I have a 3d projector with a 125"" electric screen and the 3d in this movie was actually really good, nothing cheesy like in some 3d movies and the 3d effects were worthwhile. Obviously not the best 3d effects I seen, but much better than some of the movies I seen lately.",1358985600,,868,4.017341040462428

4870694,3,B005S9EL6C,"I'm coming into the whole STEP UP scene further down the line than I'd like to admit. This is the first movie in the series that I've actually watched. From what I've been able to look up this is either the fourth film in the series. If they have all been like this then they're entertaining enough but nothing spectacular.

This time around we have a group of young people who love to dance and are seeking to win a competition for flash mob dancing being sponsored on the internet. For those who don't know a flash mob involves a group of people who prepare for a dance performance but don't have a stage to perform on. Instead they show up unannounced with no warning and suddenly you have a group of people burst into dance in everyday settings. When the film opens the group stop traffic on a coastal Miami street, pop up their sound equipment in seconds and begin dancing on top of, around and over cars in the street. Timed to make sure they can get away without being caught, the break down and take off.

The leader of the crew is Eddy. Not professionally trained, Eddy works at a local hotel along with several other members of the crew. Their current goal is to get more hits for their street performance than any other crew and to win a large cash award and contract via the competition sponsored online.

While on break at the hotel Eddy meets a young girl named Penelope who has some dance moves of her own. What he doesn't know is that her father is the owner of the hotel. Not only do we have a boy from the wrong side of the tracks meets girl who lives in posh surroundings here, we have another problem when Penelope's father releases the news that he intends to buy out the neighborhood where Eddy and his friends live to turn it into a resort area.

Love will conquer all though. Even the problems that pop up when Eddy's best friend nearly ruins the potential for the crew to win the competition when he becomes jealous of Penelope. What he doesn't realize is that she's on their side and that the time she's been spending with Eddy was to help her realize her dream of performing with a high profile dance troupe there in Miami. Sure it lead to romance but there was no plan to harm the crew.

While this set up may sound simple that's because in effect it is simple. The story is small and the dialogue weak but that's not what people going to see the STEP UP films are there for. They're there to watch the young dancers spin, jump, pop up and krunk in various settings Its all about dancing and watching some talented people do it to the best of their ability. The plotlines here are no more in depth than the old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland ""hey kids let's put on a show!"" plots. Its all about the dancing.

That's not to say it's a bad movie. It's actually quite entertaining. The dancing is well done and the music will have you toe tapping in seconds. No, this is not a movie that I would mark my calendar to go see, but as a rental for a night that will entertain, especially those who are dance fans, you can't go wrong with this one.",1357776000,,3064,4.310763888888889

4870831,5,B005S9EL6C,"This flick is echelons beyond You Got Served: Beat the World (2011), eclipses the original You Got Served (2004) and matches all of the Step Up franchise.  This along with the other Step Up movies always leave me feeling satisfied, happy, pumped up and itching to pull a hamstring learning how to slam dance.

Miami crew The Mob is trying to drum up 10 million YouTube hits with their filmed flash mob hip hop routines done in public.  Of course they all have crappy jobs, douche-y bosses, and could really use a break.  The movie  is predictably formulaic, but that's okay.  The rebellious crew captain meets a rebellious young lady who, of course, also dances quite well and in a different style.  Finances grow tighter.  Douche bags become douchier.  The love interest becomes complicated by the pressure of a powerful father's (Peter Gallagher) ultimatum.  The girl is challenged to risk everything.  The Mob puts ""it all"" on the line.

Together Sean (Ryan Guzman in his first movie) and Emily (SYTYCD's Kathryn, who looks a lot like Eliza Dushku) mix his hip hop street savvy with her contemporary style.  Born two worlds apart, but they're one of a kind..yeah, it's that kind of ""rule-breaking"" hip flick.  He says things like ""trust me"" and ""meet me here at this time...and wear something nice.""  How mysterious and romantic, right?  He wins her romantic passion by introducing her to his life's passion: hip hop flash mobbing.

The movie is shot well with vibrant colors bringing Miami to life.  The music is fun.  The dancing is exciting.  The flash mob set ups are cool, too.  I especially enjoyed the art gallery scene, during which many dance and lighting styles were showcased.  Even parkour (freerunning) finds its way into this movie.

There's trampoline dancing, devil stick dancing, martial arts dancing, parkour, contemporary, girl crew booty shaking, hip hop, stop-motion robotics, a dash of krump, un poco de salsa...pretty much everything.  Oh, and the best twitchy robot dancer EVER (Vlad from Step Up 3D) makes an appearance in the finale.  Good stuff!  I seriously can't tell if they're modifying the film speed or if he can really move like that.  Jenny Kido and Moose (both from Step Up 2 and Step Up 3D) make appearances, too.  Surprises abound left and right.  And, no.  I didn't ruin anything for you.

These actors are nothing amazing, but they don't drown in the sea of clichs and destitute writing.  They hold their own just strong enough to keep my attention and earn a few grins as I patiently wait for the next dance scene.  The movie also features So You Think You Can Dance's Twitch (who is wisely given very few lines as Jason) (Step Up 3D, Stomp the Yard 2) and Mia Michaels basically playing herself.

This movie is 90 minutes of feel good, stickin'-it-to-the-man fun that reminds me of how exciting life was in my early 20s and late teens.",1357084800,,2880,4.786585365853658
4870862,3,B005S9EL6C,"I've seen all the Step Up movies. I'm a fan of dance, and I have watched a lot the So You Think You Can Dance seasons, so I've seen many of the dancers in this movie before. I don't go into these expecting Oscar performances. The acting was pretty bad in this one, worse than the previous 3. The script might have been the real problem, I'm not sure acting could have overcome it. That said the dancing was good, but not great. It's been better in previous Step Up movies. This is just another one. Straight to DVD wouldn't have been an insult for this movie.

Also, the lead male character couldn't dance well enough to keep up with the dancers in the cast. They hid his dancing throughout the moving, just as they did in the previous 2 step up movies.",1357084800,2,753,4.265734265734266

The reason this movie did not get a one star was because the last half of the movie was actually really good.

4871045,2,B005S9EL6C,"I saw previews of this movie from other DVDs that I rented and what I saw in the preview looked great. However when I rented the movie there was something off with the visual component to all the dance sequences. I have very sharp and good vision and my eyes started to hurt a bit while watching these dance moves. At times I felt like something was a bit out of focus or ""jagged."" At times I often said to myself, ""Hym, the camera angle used to capture these dancers while doing their moves was suboptimal at best. They're really not being captured in the best angle to really show them off."" However, I learned later that this movie was originally meant for a 3D viewing experience at the cinema. So my guess is that this is why my eyes were picking up on something odd and maybe this movie would be more impressive visually while watching as a 3D experience.

The acting was decent but the story line was the same regurgitated theme we've all seen so many times before. Young talented people living a hard life now have their turf threatened in some way and eventually collaborate together to fight for what's theirs through dance. It's such a cliche story line we've seen so many times already. After the first Footloose in 1984, the remake of Footloose in 2011 and finally the first ""Step UP"" in 2006 with Channing Tatum, I don't how or why directors and producers find any value in repeating the same old story.",1355011200,2,1417,4.471042471042471

I know a movie is good when I have no control over how I respond to its amazingness.  Furthermore, the storyline wasn't terrible either.  There are some dance movies with horrible plots, and it's obvious they're hoping the dance sequences will compensate for the lack of storyline.  ""Step Up: Revoluation,"" didn't fall into that category for me.  The dancers are ultimately fighting for something important and I found myself cheering them and their cause on.

I had certain expectations about this movie based on those movies and the trailer for this one, but I have to say ""Step Up: Revolution"" greatly exceeded those expectations.

The sands towards the beginning was really good and had me excited, but after that the pop outs didn't seem to work, the opportunities were there, they just didn't seem to come out of the screen. Maybe watching despicable me 3D before this spoiled me with the pop outs, but overall it is worth checking out and I am looking forward to getting step up 3 in 3D, because on bluray.com it got a higher 3D rating than this one, so I have high expectations for it.

Story wise, for a dance flick, I thought it was pretty good. Keep in mind I have never seen the other 3, this was a impulse buy, but the dancing was what really blew me  away especially the opening sequence and the art museum. And for the guys, there are plenty of smokin' hot chicks in bikinis in this movie, which is always worth watching, and ladies don't get disappointed cause there were quite a few topless men with very toned abs!

This movie is worth checking out, even if you just rent it. The dancing really makes this a fun movie with quite a few holy sh*t, how do they do that moments, and worth watching in 3D atleast once.",1354406400,,1167,4.271493212669683

4871165,4,B005S9EL6C,"Lots of dancing, music and romance in this dvd.  I would recommend watching it; an enjoyable evening of entertainment to watch.",1354406400,,127,5.0476190476190474
4871166,3,B005S9EL6C,"I enjoyed the movie, the storyline was interesting (but no real surprises) and the dancing was great to watch, but at times it looked totally computer generated, which was disappointing.  I think most people are going to watch this movie to see the great dancing, but to often than not it looked fake, so I give this movie only a 3.",1354406400,,332,4.442622950819672
4871167,5,B005S9EL6C,"Love this installment of the Step Up movies! Even my teenaged sons & husband watched it & liked it. Great dancing - and non-stop action. Very good! I own the previous 3 and couldn't wait to add this one to my home collection after watching it at the theater. Definitely worth every penny spent! The plot was a bit cheesy and predictable, but along the same lines as the other ones. If you're a fan I believe you'll definitely like this one!",1354406400,,440,4.378048780487805
4871168,1,B005S9EL6C,"Not much thought was put into this movie.  It was thrown together with a lame plot, people dancing and towards the end with the happy music playing as the ""The Mob"" gets what they wanted towards the end.. their neighborhood back. So the idea of once you live in an area,that is rented, it belongs to you?  No it doesn't.  It's being rented.  Whomever owns it can sell it any time they wish to do so.  They own it. So the day is saved because of booty popping and a lot of other dance moves?!!? Why?",1354406400,3,498,4.145833333333333
4871169,5,B005S9EL6C,"Watch the preview.  If you like it, you'll like the movie.  The movie is basically a series of dance numbers strung together by a loose corporate greed and teen love storyline.  The narrative is throw-away, but the dancing is excellent.  My teen kids really liked the dancing and music - so much so that they watched it again the following morning.

Amazon instant video worked perfectly through my PS3.  Excellent high-def picture and 5.1 sound.  No lagging, no hiccups or hesitations.  Perfect.",1354406400,,496,4.963414634146342
4871170,4,B005S9EL6C,Isn't that what you expect from the Step Up series? Kathryn was hot as usual. The scrap metal statue art was pretty cool too.,1354406400,,125,4.25
4871191,2,B005S9EL6C,"I am a very big fan of the Step Up movies, as is my teen daughter.  If you are too, you will be sorely disappointed by this one.  It has a lot of hype and a boring story line to drag it out, and not enough of anything of much interest in the first half of the movie.  The dance scenes are great (too bad we're not into booty popping, or we might have found it to be more interesting!), but the movie is boring until the dance scenes pick up in the middle of the movie.  Then it picks up and there's more dance to it, and less crappy plot, which gets very predictable, very fast!  The best is the end of the movie and that is where the misleading hype comes in...  If you're a fan of Adam G. Sevani, who plays Moose (we happen to love his character!), don't bother looking for him until the very end of the movie, which is where the best scene of the entire movie is - the dance sequences at the end of this movie are beyond awesome.  However you can probably find them for free to watch on Youtube, so save your money!  Now why did we have to wait til the end of the movie to be really entertained and see all that great dance numbers going on?  Why did all the commercials and hype we saw about this movie lead us to believe Moose was in this movie?  This was the worst of all 4 Step Up movies.  We will not be watching this one again, nor will we be buying it on DVD.  It sucked the big one!  I can't get my daughter to shut up and stop complaining - that's how bad this movie sucked!  The only saving grace was that for some reason we didn't end up seeing this in the theater as we planned to do, so I saved some money... but I still wasted money renting this online.  If this is a sign of what's happened to the Step Up movies, I hope they don't make a fifth one - but if they do, you can bet that I won't be wasting my money on it, whether it's at the theater, or online!  No mas!  Fini!",1354320000,,1892,3.898172323759791
4871192,5,B005S9EL6C,Good movie my son loves it. So i'm going to give it 5 stars if you love movies where people are dancing all over the place then its a good movie for you.,1354320000,,153,3.6666666666666665
4871193,5,B005S9EL6C,"If you're going to pay extra for any 3D movie, this should be the one!  This has the best 3D + clarity that I have ever seen in a movie.  This movie looks like it was shot in 3D.  Unlike Thor and Captain America which were shot in 2D and then edited to 3D, this movie looks like it was shot in 3D.  There's a difference, when I watched Captain America, the 3D wasn't all that great, and reviews pointed out flaws like the 3D wasn't constant throughout, it was added to select parts in each seen.  This movie kept up with the technology and took it further.  As for the clarity, well a lot of 3D movies will pixelate the background in order to make their 2D seem more 3D after editing.  The movie showed great clarity and 3D at the same time and when I paused it at intermissions the 3D and clarity were very noticeable and amazing to see.  This is a test that many published articles and reviewers are saying you should do to test the true quality of the 3D, and the same can be done for clarity.  As for the audio, well you can image that it would be great for a movie like this, after all the music is a vital aspect of their movies.  Using a 300 watt Polk subwoofer for the low bass and a secondary 100 watt Sony subwoofer for the higher frequency bass (the ""punchy"" bass) coupled with 3 - 100 watt bass shakers on the bottom of the couch and wall mounted surround sound, the music and special effects sounded amazing.  For anyone who wants to take it further, the next step after 3D would be bass shakers on the bottom of your seat so you can feel the bass like you would in the movies, this really brought the movie to life! These movies really keep up with the times, new innovative dance moves, now more realistic with the best 3D technology currently on the market (for 2012), new/current music and the best audio and video (clarity) quality above and beyond the standard of current movies.  One of few movies that you want to watch again, right away!",1354233600,,1959,4.250673854447439
4871194,5,B005S9EL6C,"I have seen the other Step Up movies and wasn't sure what i would think about this one, but I loved it so much it might be my favorite one! The dance and emotion in this is inspiring, it makes me want to Step Up!",1354147200,,212,3.7333333333333334

All I know is that the story is generic, but the actors/actresses are well liked.  The acting is some of the best in the franchise.  Of course that curly haired kid is in this movie again, at the very end.  We all love him.  I'd recommend this version.  The cinematography is great.",1353974400,,440,4.023255813953488

4871198,1,B005S9EL6C,"This movie sucks! It was poorly written and made to attract idiot by getting quote on quote ""hot"" people who could not act if there life depended on it. There is no art to this movie unlike the first and second ones. This was a waste of time and money. And what the jack is up with the cover photo. And there was too many celebrities and bad music. The first and second movie was about art, dancing, love and life this movie is about making profit from mindless drones.",1353888000,3,469,4.222222222222222

8484691,5,B005S9EL6C,"I'm a bit biased because I simply LOVE all dance battle movies. And this one has it all. It has a blistering pace from start to finish, with hot, strong, amazing dancers from start to finish. The only time it slows down is when the star-crossed, supposedly doomed lovers discover that they cannot live without each other. And the part where all the dancers are down on their luck because the MAN has ruined their crew and is about to bulldoze everyone's dreams. In summary, everything that a tremendously awesome dance battle movie should be. You should buy/rent it for the opening scene alone.",1516406400,,594,4.721153846153846
