2939152,5,B000VECAEO,"I didn't grow up watching Seinfeld, however my friends all told me to watch this great show. I bought the first six volumes from Amazon.com for an amazing deal. As I watch the seasons, it got better every year. It's just a classic, and I can't comment on this season just yet. I'm sure when I do it'll be another great seasoned show, however for those who are collecting this great show, it's a great add to finish off the entire collection. I do admit when I first saw this on Amazon, the price was not looking good. They do now have a great price and I just can't wait for this to be shipped.",1190419200,,594,4.173913043478261
2939153,5,B000VECAEO,"For years, nothing could beat Seinfeld in funny.  Then we get shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm or BBC's The Office.  Seinfeld, however, stands apart as one of the greatest sitcom's ever created.  It broke the mold and refused to follow the comedic forumula previously established by other lesser shows.  Season 9 is one of my favorite seasons, the majority of it's episodes are on my favorite episode list.  Far from declining after David's departure, it surpassed itself and my expectations in continually leaving me rolling on my living room floor each Thursday night.",1190160000,7,569,5.075268817204301
2939154,5,B000VECAEO,"I would never give Seinfeld anything less than five stars, but I have to agree with the other reviewer.  The price has been seemingly unnecessarily inflated.  Deflate it to the price of the other seasons, I wouldn't hesitate to make the purchase.  But even as a Seinfeld afficionado, I would never be dumb enough to purchase it at that ridiculously inflated price.  A horrible move indeed.",1189641600,3,389,4.848484848484849
2939155,5,B000VECAEO,"Many Seinfeld fans were disappointed to see the show end, but it's very understandable that Jerry wanted to end while the show was on top rather than wait until they ran out of ideas.

This season is filled with episodes that contain that classic Seinfeld style of humor.  Many people who don't like Seinfeld don't appreciate how complex and well written the story lines can be.  The Betrayal (or Backwards episode) seems to be dreaded by many but is a favorite for me.  I see it as a well written and thought out episode that ventures into a much more daring style of writing.  Show me a movie or TV show that comes even close to this format (flashbacks DON'T count) and still maintains a funny and engaging plot.

The final episode was a disappointment for me, and I will also admit that it fell short of the standards set by the previous episodes.  But I also applaud their ability to bring the show to a close and still incorporate so many of the extras that made appearances over the years.

Though maybe not the best, this season is still one of the best of the Seinfeld show.  Even if you consider this a hit or miss season, those that hit, are absolutely hilarious.  The goofy, unrealistic, off the wall style is what the show was all about.  Pick up a copy of this as soon as it comes out.",1189382400,36,1298,4.366666666666666
2939156,5,B000VECAEO,Cant you people wait for the item to come out before you post negative reviews. Amazon always lowers the prices in the weeks after it is announced when its coming out. No you people go ahead start your crying about the prices. I mean its still 2 months away from release. And nobody is making you buy the set anyways. Anyways this by far one of Seinfelds best seasons because of its goofyness. The Dealership is one of my favorite episodes because of the truthfulness that it brings. I mean who hasn't bought a candy bar in a vending machine and have it get hung up and we start slamming and banging the machine. Of course George takes it to the limit with his candy lineup and then Kramer stretching the gas mileage. Then of course dealing with a car dealership. So anybody reading the comments for this set ignore all negative remarks. I'm sure by October the set will be 40 dollars.,1189123200,11,885,4.435582822085889
2939157,1,B000VECAEO,"The show that started off about nothing really did become the show that was nothing to rave about in the last season. Season 8 was when the show really starting to decline for me but it wasn't until the awful, terrible, horrible, despicable season 9 was when Seinfeld unfortunately totally lost the plot from it's original format. Any true Seinfeld fan knows since Larry David's departure after season 7 the show had changed its formula slightly but the change from season 8 to 9 was a completely different style of comedy which made absolute fools of all 4 characters. The story lines were becoming depressingly desperate, the characters were becoming more and more stupid and the dynamic between the four of them was out the window never to be seen again. I'm sure Jerry and the rest of the gang noticed the show had lost its steam by now so it was a great thing this was the last season. Put it this way it's a shame they didn't finish one season earlier, but it's even better they didn't go one more season further.",1188691200,30,1019,4.543478260869565
2939158,5,B000VECAEO,"Season nine starts where we left off the previous season, with George recovering from injuries he took down a flight of stairs, thus interrupting the ""Summer of George"" he was planning to enjoy with  his generous severance check from the New York Yankees. George quickly finds another job, but his potential new boss has misunderstood his cane, and before George can explain the boss tells George about all of the benefits he will enjoy as a handicapped employee. George decides to go along with the ruse when he discovers he will have his own specially outfitted bathroom to suit his handicap - a perk George cannot resist.  When George is found out by his employer and even offered another generous severance package to leave, he decides to dig in and the whole situation turns into a humorous seige. George never fails to offend and infuriate people, so later in the season when an acquaintance is working on step nine of the AA program by going around and apologizing for past transgressions George is unhappy that he is never apologized to. He agitates the acquaintance about this so badly that he does eventually get the apology. However, unfortunately now the poor fellow has an anger management problem on top of his alcoholism due to George and must enroll in still another support group.

Elaine is in a longer relationship than usual, continuing her romance with ace auto mechanic David Puddy. The mismatched couple have as tortured a relationship as you would expect and in the opening episode are bickering during a plane ride all the way back from Europe where they have been vacationing. They break up but end up sleeping together every time they see each other. This works out for Jerry and for Puddy since Jerry keeps betting Elaine that she can't stay away from Puddy - and winning - and it turns out that Puddy likes not having to stick around to cuddle with Elaine afterwards.

Although I have no idea how Kramer manages to live in Manhattan without any visible means of support, at least we finally discover why he has been unemployed. He's been waiting for the strike to end at H&H Bagels for 12 years. The strike ends when the minimum wage finally reaches what the union demanded in the first place. Of course, Kramer is the only one of the strikers who has actually been faithfully striking all these years. When he decides to celebrate George's father's version of Christmas - Festivus - he wants the day off. When H&H refuses Kramer goes back on strike because his religious beliefs are not being honored, thus ending Kramer's brief venture into the world of work.

Jerry has numerous romantic misadventures this season including a girlfriend that looks either beautiful or hideous depending on what the lighting is, another girlfriend who likes to wander around sans clothing yet still manages to annoy Jerry when he discovers there is such a thing as ""bad naked"", and yet another girlfriend whom Jerry throws over for the sound of his own voice imitating the noises that the girl's stomach makes.

This year has Newman making quite a few appearances, most notably in ""The Butter Shave"" where he discovers that he is strangely attracted to Kramer in a culinary way after Kramer uses butter as a tanning lotion and then falls asleep in the sun. That all-over butter smell is just too much for Newman to resist ending in a hilarious chase scene through the middle of Jerry's stand-up routine. Newman and Kramer are also featured in a satire of the X-Files when Kramer starts to complain about his junk mail to the post office and goes there to declare he no longer wants his mail delivered.

The last four episodes - Puerto Rican Day, the two clip shows, and the finale were a bit of a let-down to me. Puerto Rican Day didn't seem to have the same level of ensemble humor I was accustomed to seeing, the clip shows are just bits and pieces taken from prior shows that were shown on the night the finale was broadcast, and the finale just didn't live up to my expectations. But then it would be hard to wrap up in one hour a show that spent nine years focused on the minutia of life as experienced by four self-involved people and somehow managed to never disappoint. It's hard to have a satisfying conclusion to something that had no real beginning or middle to it. The following is the list of special features:

Some peeps my age don't be into classics but such are imbeciles. Even as we see the show jump the shark even more here, Seinfeld never loses (IMO) it's appeal. Unlike some people, I like the finale with the return of so many characters, and I love the clip show, it's HI-larious. Some characters, like Kramer, may never have been funnier. Maybe it was just the right time to end the most perfect show ever.",1446768000,,548,4.382352941176471

But this season became even wilder, more slapstick, more totally insane and ridiculous situations and I found myself loving it. Although, I hate to admit, I still don't really care for the final episode. But it's still enjoyable.
Seinfeld is, to me, the very best comedic show I've ever seen. We all have those days when we just need a good laugh and popping in a Seinfeld dvd always works for me. And this final season of Seinfeld delivers  plenty of great laughs.

The previous season was still funny but you did notice a dropoff from the previous 5 seasons. However, Season 9 regained a lot of their mojo and a few episodes that you could call among their best such as ""The Voice"", ""The Merv Griffin Show"", ""The Strike (also known as the Festivus episode)"", and ""The Frogger"". The last feature among the episodes on Disc 1 called ""The Last Lap"" in which the cast and staff address the end of the show is very insightful. George's neurotic behavior hits new lows on ""The Apology"" and ""The Dealership"" while Kramer is at his most hysterical on the aforementioned ""The Merv Griffin Show"". Other strong episodes include ""The Wizard"", ""The Cartoon"", and ""The Slicer"". The series finale appropriately titled ""The Finale"" received a lot of criticism but in hindsight was actually decent even if it didn't live up to its mammoth expectations. The special features are top notch as usual and the roundtable with the cast and Larry David on Disc 4 is very good.

  Even the not so great episodes (similar to the Beatles' reference to their 'slog' songs) are better comedy than many of the sitcoms alive today.

2939316,1,B000VECAEO,"The ranking of one star is for the DVD Edition of the 9th season. The show itself is one of my favorite comedies ever. So keep that in mind if you feel tempted to leave hateful comments for this review.

The reason for my low rating is this: In the discs of this season and without allowing the choice of over-riding it, a long anti-piracy commercial (in Spanish, not in English) plays before the show episodes.

Worst, the anti-piracy commercial only plays after selecting non-English subtitles. Like if it was targeted to Hispanics.

Given the hard time that NBC got with the airing of the 'Puerto Rican Day' episode, one can hardly be blamed for suspecting that the ''ethnicity-selective'' anti-piracy commercial is just a ''shove it down your throat'' feature for customers who's vernacular language is not English.

And for the record I am a Puerto Rican who happens to love the 'Puerto Rican Day' episode. Despite the burning of the Puerto Rican flag. And that is because throughout ''his'' series Mr. Seinfeld took the greatest comedic liberties with his own Jewish ethnicity, even in extremely sensible topics as the holocaust.

But I can't help to deeply resent the ""pay back"" BS that either NBC or Jerry Seinfeld or both wants to shove down our Puerto Rican (nay, Hispanics) throats. And all because of the political turmoil that this episode stirred in most members of my ethnic community.

Respectful show-business should be above racial and-or bigotry payback. Too bad that this DVD set of the 9th season of my favorite comedic show of the 90s was not crafted to reflect that. Future generations of all races will judge it for this.",1316044800,2,1645,4.8362989323843415

Particularly hilarious episodes include ""The Butter Shave,"" where George, who attended a job interview with a cane after his accident the previous season, gives his new boss the impression that he's handicapped. Unwilling to give up all the amenities the company is eager to provide him, George continues the charade. ""The Serenity Now,"" where George's parents adopt a phrase in attempts to calm themselves during stressful situations -- which, of course, knowing the Costanzas, is not exactly stressless.

""The Merv Griffin Show,"" where Kramer discovers the talk show's old set in a Dumpster and decides to resume it in his own apartment; ""The Strike,"" where Kramer is finally called back to his job at the bagel shop after a decade-long strike;

2939323,5,B000VECAEO,"Seinfeld is one of the best tv shows, period! Writing a review is really hard. Words cannot capture a 10 year sitcom. Every aspect of this sitcom is stunning. I got addicted  after watching few season 1 episodes.. This show was present in my life each week for the past 10 years. It relates to my past.. There are small little disappointments, not because of the show per-say, but the dvds.. Sound is only in stereo, and Sony did not make an effort to remaster original soundtrack into believable surround format. Sony has the tech  and experience to make it more believable, oh well maybe down the road they will reissue.
Cons
When you watch the show consecutively week after week you see characters to develop, and it gets better and better. I watched all seasons, and when you go back and watch first season you realize how much better rest of the seasons were.  In season 1 characters are all over the place, trying to build their  characters which evolved. Jerrys parents were different actors, and lame. The other beef I have is in season 6 original writers were replaced with new ones, and lost that spark. You can really see it in the rest of the episodes.

2939346,4,B000VECAEO,"I had been really harsh on Seinfeld after Larry David left the series in series 7. Gone was the authenticity of the early episodes like The Chinese Restaurant and the mixture of dark themes with the trivial like The Trip and in its place was a complete farce.

So why have I given this DVD release four stars? Because the extra features completely put this season into context. The direction of season 9 into complete zaniness was absolutely intentional by Jerry Seinfeld who was leading the creative process in the last two seasons. When you hear the creative crew give their explanations about the escape from realism throughout this season you understand as a fan that a lot of experimentation was going on at the production side of the series.

The intention was to deconstruct and play around with a world that we had all grown to love over the course of the series - by which the end of the series we discover that the four people that we had loved, admired and even some us aspired to be were complete jerks and it is probably a dark criticism on humanity that we could relate to these people in the first place. Ho-hum!

Watching the series and all the detailed, well constructed episodes of season 9 in this context really made me appreciate all the hard work that went into these final moments and it still pretty powerful watching those last episodes. (And for those that might find the ending too mean spirited to constitute an ending, there's always that Greenday song to relive sentimental nostalgic memories.)

2939369,4,B000VECAEO,"If you're only going to buy one season on DVD you obviously are more likely to find more of your favourite classic episode moments on previous season collections.  Season 9 however wraps up arguably the greatest show which has ever been on TV and although not quite as good, still has enough classic lines that you're going to want to finish off your Seinfeld collection with. You're also going to also want to do it while this season is still at normal prices and not at collectors ones.

Season 9 for the most part maintained the high quality of the previous seasons with classic moments such as George's girlfriend saying no when he tries to break up with her, a bookstore making him buy and refusing to let him return a book he took into the toilet, he dates a woman who looks like Jerry and the George scenes which brought back flashbacks for anyone who was a kid in the 80s when he has to own the Frogger machine from a closing down pizza shop with his high score.  Elaine dates a homeless man, a boyfriend she wonders if is black before she reunites with Puddy who she discovers is religious and thinks she is going to hell but doesn't care, she also is tormented by a fax machine, plagiarises a newspaper cartoon and eats an historic piece of cake among a few adventures.  Kramer among other things turns his apartment into a movie set, moves to Seinfeld's parents retirement village in Florida, hides a safebox key inside a neighbours bird, takes up an acting gig in a hospital and steals police caution tape.  Jerry continues to find faults with the various women he dates including a sentence finisher and one with a secret tractor story as well as realising dating and paying his maid is not much different to using a prostitute.  The quality of the final couple of episodes is not quite up there with the rest of the series, it is almost as if too much effort was put into giving all the writers a go and trying to make these epidodes the best which only resulted in them being not exactly Seinfeldly in feel.

Like with the other series the special features aren't as numerous in number or as good as they could have been. The deleted scene with the actor playing someone who had a sponge left inside of him is hilarious and should have been in the show.  As should have a lot of the deleted court scenes from the finale which could have maybe been there at the expense of the slow start to that episode.  Like most I thought the finale was a bit of a disappointment compared to my expectations but seriously I don't think it's possible to reach the expectations of the huge number of fans, interestingly in the scenes from the roundtable feature Larry David says he would do it with less hype if he could do it again. Just on that roundtable feature, I don't understand why they didn't include the whole show instead of a very edited version, especially since some of the stuff they kept was also told in the commentaries.  On the topic of commentaries I thought they finally got the balance right with the commentary on the Burning in relation to allowing you to hear the lines and at the same moment learn some facts (this one included Jason, Julia and the actor who played Puddy).  However the commentaries on The Maid and Puerto Rican Day by the writers was pretty average and mostly related to them telling you how good they were to come up with this or that idea and criticising Jerry for not including their ideas such as George finding out his name is really Georg when he brings his birth certificate to work.  I did like how one had the courage to criticise NBC and the politically correct nuts for not showing the Puerto Rican Day Parade episode on TV after it first aired just because a few people protested before it was even aired and they even knew what it was about.

2939383,2,B000VECAEO,"I realize that ""Seinfeld"" is loved, adored, indeed *worshipped* by millions of people.  But phuleeeeze, you've got to be kidding -- ""Seinfeld"" is so lightweight it's embarrassing.  All four of the major performers are one-trick ponies: extremely one-dimensional.

It's not that the show isn't somewhat amusing, it is.  But that's all it is, mildly amusing at best.

One thing ""Seinfeld"" *does* have going for it is that most sitcoms nowadays are far WORSE -- incredibly mean-spirited which ""Seinfeld,"" thankfully, isn't.  ""Seinfeld"" is, if nothing else, a sweet, civilized, humane show, and that's rare nowadays.

But that aside, the show is weaker than Johnny Fontaine's vocal chords.

The funniest thing about ""Seinfeld"" is the laugh track.  Notice when the laugh track kicks in.  The laugh track is activated for lines that are either barely funny or else not funny at all.  Then, when there is a legitimate laugh, the laugh track gives the impression that an enormously funny thing has happened; which is rarely the case.

Listen to how out of sync the laugh track is as compared with what a live audience would, in reality, laugh at.

In many markets, ""Seinfeld"" reruns are followed by reruns of ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" and the difference between the two shows is remarkable.  ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is light-years better than ""Seinfeld.""  It's better written, better acted, better directed.  The characters are fully conceived, and the stories are human, empathetic -- as opposed to ""Seinfeld's"" typically smug, condescending, smart-alecky point of view.

So why is ""Seinfeld"" such a highly regarded sitcom?  Here are a few theories.

Theory #1: People like ""Seinfeld"" because they're attracted to the idea of a friendly, likeable guy living in a big impersonal city who, nevertheless, opens his door to all kinds of goofy people.  This is also my theory as to why ""Friends"" and ""Cheers,"" two other lightweights, are also so popular -- friendliness amidst the anomie of the big city.

All three shows are also heavy on ""relationships"" and ""lifestyles,"" especially relationships and lifestyles among singles.  And, God knows, people *do* need the maturity and intelligence of commercial teevee to clue them in on how to relate to people.  I imagine people see Elaine's ""relationships"" and say: ""Yeah, I guess that's how it's done.  Better check with Oprah though.  Get a second opinion.""

Theory #2: Jerry Seinfeld is, in and out of character, an extremely likeable person, and on teevee that counts for a great deal.  As previously noted, one thing ""Seinfeld"" is *not* is mean-spirited; so the show scores points when compared to the harshly cynical junk that dominates teevee nowadays.  I don't watch ""Seinfeld"" reruns very much but when I do at least I know the show won't be cynical and mean-spirited, and that's an oasis in a desert of mean-spiritedness.

Theory #3: Jerry Seinfeld is evil incarnate.  Diabolical fiend that he is, he's hypnotized America into liking not just him but his facockta show.  (Oh, and they thought we'd never find out!  J'ACCUSE, JERRY SEINFELD!)

OK, let's consider each character, starting with Kramer/Michael Richards. ...

I mean, come on, fellow bipeds, how many times is it funny that Kramer enters a room skidding across the floor?  Without a rigged laugh track and a bigoted stand-up routine, Michael Richards would be working for the post office, and *Josh Mostel* would be sliding across the floor.  At least THAT would be funny!

Also, Mike baby, dig it -- Jerry Lewis did the spastic bit 50 years ago, and even then Jerry didn't drive it into the ground like you do.

Elaine/Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. ...

Pshaw and alas, very *very* limited.  Compare her to, say, Deborah/Patricia Heaton on ""Everybody Loves Raymond.""  Patricia Heaton can *act* comedically.  She *moves* comedically.  In fact, her physical humor is as good as that of any female comedian whose appeared on television.  Moreover, she can deliver long, plot-enabling monologues as good as anybody in either comedy or drama.  In short, Patricia Heaton along with the rest of the cast of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" can do all the things that nobody and I mean NOBODY on ""Seinfeld"" can do, least of all Julia Louis-Dreyfus-Head-Case.

Which brings us to Jason Alexander ...

His one-trick is that he whines.  Oy, can this boy whine!  This is some feency-schmancy whiner.  I want a million dollar whiner, this is who I go to.  I pray to God for a whiner: Jason Alexander falls from the sky into my lap.

Virtually every one George Costanza's laugh lines is Jason Alexander whining.  Whine, whine, whine.  Enough already!  Enough already, I'm getting naaaauseous!

There should be a character on ""Seinfeld"" whose sole job it is to *demand* that George Costanza stop whining.  In fact, if one of the characters in ""Seinfeld"" yelled at George Costanza, at the top of his lungs, ""STOP WHINING!"" -- there'd be a regular standing ovation three blocks long.

The writers on ""Seinfeld"" are intelligent in that they know how to write for their characters -- one-dimensionally.  Unlike, the writers on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" Seinfeld's writers don't give their performers anything very difficult to do comedically.  And the reason is simple: the performers on ""Seinfeld"" are limited, as both actors as well as sketch comedians.

The show had a very strict, very limited formula, which caught on with the public and, evidently, those associated with the show were content to work and prosper within those limitations.

One senses that the ""Seinfeld"" writers understood quite well the actors' limitations and, as such, ""wrote-to-character"" with their limitations firmly in mind.

Which, speaking of limitations, brings us to Jerry Seinfeld. ...

The people who conceived the show (one of whom no doubt was Jerry Seinfeld himself) were very smart not to make Jerry Seinfeld play a character.  Jerry Seinfeld plays Jerry Seinfeld and for a very good reason -- Jerry Seinfeld can *only* play Jerry Seinfeld.  In fact, even when Jerry Seinfeld plays Jerry Seinfeld, he isn't very good.  (Now THAT'S a limited actor!)

Jerry's whining is, more of less, one octave lower than Jason Alexander's whining.  And, ok, so one's fat and the other's skinny, but so's my Aunt Shirley and Uncle Bernie, and where's their sitcom?

The other thing that distinguishes ""Seinfeld"" as lightweight -- besides the rigged laugh track, the limited writing, and the low-grade talent -- is that a given show has a number of side-stories that invariably ""slam-cut"" across one another, the hoped-for-laugh being implicit in the juxtaposition of two story-threads suddenly coming together. ... Big deal.  Martin Scorcese watch out! ... This is as predictable as Kramer sliding into a room or George Costanza whining and kvetching, whining and kvetching.

The use of several story-threads in each episode means that scenes are often short, quick and non-sustaining.  Jerry is, for example, standing outside his door saying goodnight to his date, there's a few back-and-forth lines, and then BAM! the camera cuts to, say, Kramer running down the street tripping over himself, and then BAM! over to Elaine and George trying to unlock her, I don't know, her chastity belt.

All this suggests performers who can't otherwise sustain a ""comedy spine"" to a scene for more than a couple of minutes.  Notice, by contrast, how on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" a given scene is quite long, with often four or more actors in the scene.  ""Seinfeld"" a.) wouldn't dare film in front of a truly live audience, i.e., a live audience without a post production laugh track; and b.) keeps everything short and quick because short and quick creates a feeling of movement when the movement, the energy, should occur *within* the scene not against what comes before and after.

It's not that there wasn't an audience present when Seinfeld was filmed.  Perhaps there was.  And, no doubt, some of the bits got legitimate laughs from the audience on hand.  But it's quite obvious that in post-production a laugh track was inserted to ""sweeten"" the laughs.  Meaning: a live audience with a laugh track inserted later on is, in reality, *not* a live audience, given the final product, given what's presented as ""the show.""

As the great Sid Caesar said about his ""Show of Shows,"" a laugh track was out the question because ""that would be cheating.""

Jerry Seinfeld, a self-professed admirer of the classic comedians, must, in his heart of hearts, be profoundly baffled as to why his show is so successful.  I doubt very much if he would disagree with the above-offered analysis.

You've heard the expression ""dumbed-down""? -- I think what ""Seinfeld"" has done is to ""laugh-down"" the comedy of the show, that is to say, they've purposely made the comedy so bland and so predictable, so obvious and so formulaic that the show is, in effect, ""safely funny"" -- cute, predictable, and (financially) guaranteed.

Kramer sliding.  ... George whining.  ... Jerry standing up straight.  ... Elaine trying to do God-knows-what, acting I suppose.  All this evidently pleases the people laughing on the laugh track, if not America's millions.

But what's lacking?

As much as Jerry Seinfeld, an admirer of great comedy, would like his show to be part of ""The Great Comedy Tradition,"" the truth is, the show falls way, way short of that lofty goal.

All great comedy speaks to the human condition.  The audience, at some level, must be moved; must be made to look at the world and their place in the world ""with fresh eyes.""  The players have to be not just good comedians but also good actors.  They have to deliver not just cute, clever lines, they have to in some way move the audience ""to look at themselves.""

For example, Alice Kramden gets mad at Ralph.  Her anger sets up the next joke, but her exasperation with Ralph also speaks to the human condition.  Ralph, alas, is a dreamer, a dreamer who always winds up losing; but although a loser, his wife  stand by him, loves him despite everything: the crummy apartment, the cockeyed dreams, the predictable failures.  We are moved by their love.  Secretly, we long for such unfailing love.  This requires a display of emotions on the part of the performers.  This requires acting!  (To quote that famous American philosopher Jon Lovitt.)

Lou Costello makes us laugh, but he's also simpatico.  He is a fool in a world full of people far more clever than he is.  A fool in a world full of forces far too powerful, far too mysterious for one person to figure out, alone.  So he needs a partner, Abbott, to help him out.  The thing is, though, Abbott takes advantage of poor Lou as often as he helps him.  And so Costello is Everyman.  He is, perhaps, us, no?  This requires a display of emotions on Costello's part.  This requires damn good acting.

Laurel and Hardy keep pushing that piano up the hill.  It keeps falling back. yet they still keep pushing.  They still keep truckin'.  They still keep keepin' on.  Why?  Why do they remain faithful to the life-force?  Why do they endure?  Why don't they just give up?  It's funny, yes, what they're doing, the audience laughs, but while they're making us laugh, we're also thinking to ourselves, perhaps not in so many words: ""This is The Myth of Sisyphus!  This is funny not just because these guys are doing funny things but because they're putting what they're doing within the context of the human condition, in this case the absurdity of life.  My God, the impossibility of it all! ... I dig it.""

There is longing in Stan Laurel's face and exasperation in Oliver Hardy's sighs, both of which transcend comedy.  In short, we're not just laughing; we are, on some level, enlightened.

Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Charlie Chaplin, W.C. Fields -- all the great comedians are much more than merely clever: their futility, the utter hopelessness of their situation, moves the audience to think about something beyond the humor, beyond what's apparent.

""Seinfeld,"" on the other hand, is completely devoid of emotions.  The material that's written for the performers doesn't require actors because it doesn't require emotions.  The ""stuff"" that's goes on in the show never rises above the merely clever; it's instead smart-alecky, ""look-at-how-smug-I-am"" ... nothingness.  Indeed, the creators of the show *brag* that the show is about nothing!  And, yes, that's exactly right, that's it in a nutshell: ""Seinfeld"" is empty humor.  And, with empty humor, we get empty humanity.

Indeed, ""empty humor"" is an oxymoron.  If so-called humor is empty of human emotions, empty of humanity, then it's not really humor.  A while ago I saw a PBS special on Jewish humor and towards the end of the program a scholarly fellow came on and made a point that I've never forgotten; that, for me, explains a great deal about life and human nature.  He said: ""I don't know this for sure, but I have the feeling that the words 'humor' and 'humanity' have the same root because you can't have a sense of humor unless you have a sense of humanity; and vice-versa."" ... And that's what ""Seinfeld,"" along with a great many other modern-day attempts at humor, lacks: humanity.

Notice how in ""The Honeymooners"" or in ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" or in a Charlie Chaplin movie or in any classic comedy, notice how at a certain point a *seriousness* presents itself.  Often this seriousness takes the form of someone being hurt; for example, Deborah in ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is offended by a remark her mother-in-law has made; The Little Tramp has been rejected by his love-interest because of his downtrodden condition -- so that amidst the humor of the piece, a misunderstanding of sorts has taken place, and, as a result, someone in the story, someone we can identify with, feels abandoned, alone, unappreciated.  The performers at that point have to act their way out of the predicament, dealing with a problem comedically that can just as easily become tragic.  (Imagine, for example, if Deborah really *had* a mother-in-law like the one on the show!  Violence might easily replace comedy as a resolution.)

""Seinfeld,"" needless to say, is light-years away from that kind of enlightened comedy -- the kind of humor that speaks not simply to the clever or the glib but, more inportantly, speaks to ""the human comedy,"" the human condition.  But how many people in the arts today *are* concerned about the human condition?  Chaplin was, Sturges was, Capra was, Orson Welles was, Mark Twain was; with lesser talents taking their cues from these giants.  That, ironically, may be why ""Seinfeld"" is  so successful: it's either what the American public wants or else what it's been forced to endure -- as Ernest Hemingway put it: ""nada y nada y pues nada.""

There is no emotion on ""Seinfeld"" -- no simpatico, no humanity -- because the creators of the show decided that that's how they wanted to pitch their show to the American public.  And, bingo! they succeeded.  Cleverness and nothingness are, after all, what television nowadays is all about, no?  ""Seinfeld,"" in that respect
-- smug, shallow, smart-alecky -- was a forerunner for the shows that came after that have even less quality and more shallowness; less talent and more smugness.

I can't believe that any of the ""Seinfeld"" performers look at the show in reruns and say to themselves: ""Yeah, man, that was my best work!""  Or, ""Damn, that's the best writing I've ever performed!""

Finally, and sadly, we must say something about Seinfeld after ""Seinfeld.""  Poor Jerry.  Poor, poor, poor-poor-poor Jerry Seinfeld. The Wandering Comedian. ...

-- He produced and starred in a documentary, ""Comedian,"" in which he tells us how he created from-scratch, from Joke 1, a stand-up monologue.  (Yaaaaaaaaawn.)

-- He did a voiceover for a character in an animated bee movie.  *And* we're told by Jerry, his-own-self, in interview after interview after interview, that he did ""exhaustive research"" for the part.  (Jerry, leave the bees, take the cannoli.)

-- He went on David Letterman and stood up for his racist, anti-Semitic colleague Michael Richards.  (NOTE: a few months before he did his racist rant onstage, Michael Richards did an anti-Semitic number, too.)

And so one must ask: whither doth thou goeth now, Jerry Seinfeldeth?  What's your next move, boychick?  Let's face it, what can you do now, limited that your talent is?  What can you do now that people won't finally catch on that ""Seinfeld"" was a fluke?

When, oh when will you finally crack, Jerry Seinfeld?  When, no longer able to contain your guilt, will you go running naked through the streets of Beverly Hills screaming: ""I AM UNCLEAN! I AM UNCLEAN!  TAKE BACK THE MONEY, I AM UNCLEAN!""

Such thoughts, no doubt, haunt Jerry Seinfeld.  I imagine he wakes up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, muttering: ""You mean, they actually paid me for all that cockin' around?  They actually PAID me?!""

His wife turns to him: ""Jerry, please, not again.  Go back to sleep.  And stop whining one octave lower than Jason Alexander.  (Sheeesh!)  It was only a nightmare.  Not to worry, the money's still in the bank.""

Jerry (to his wife): ""There's one born every minute, isn't there?""

""Yep, every minute.  And two to take 'im.""",1205712000,9,17269,4.953658536585366
2939384,2,B000VECAEO,"I'm a Seinfeld fan so let me explain the reasoning for giving the 9th season 2 stars.  The entire series started and ended weak.  First, I'm not a big fan of the final episode.  I remember it was a bit of a let-down when I first viewed it.  Subsequent viewings haven't really changed my opinion.  Second, after I had about the first 5 seasons or so I saw Jason Alexander on a poker show on tv.  He was such an arrogant jerk it's not even funny. (he was genuinely bragging about ""being a millionaire"" and how some young lady who was dealing cards was obligated to treat him differently as a result) We all know about Michael Richard's patently racist crap. Seinfeld and Louis-Dreyfus are both elitist snobs, of course.  So the second star was taken off for personal petty reasons:  it bugs me a little bit to provide money to talented, but elitist jerks.  (It seems a lot of their snob humor was genuine whereas I always thought it was sarcastic in nature).  The reason for the third star being removed was based on their marketing.  The release of a collector's compilation pack kinda bugged me.  I could have saved money by waiting.  They know there are some small-minded people out there who will purchase it all over again just to have it (as one reviewer proudly proclaimed he did).  I'm not so petty, I'll live without the stupid little book and what not.  Besides, money seems to be the root of their elitism.

2939437,5,B000VECAEO,"Firstly, for anyone who missed Jerry's appearance on The Daily Show last month he told Jon Stewart that he has one last scene (not a full episode) that he wants to do soon. He couldn't get it on this set because of all The Bee Movie work, but we will get once last taste.

Anyway... on to my review;

Without Larry David around, the most die-hard fan would have to say that the show suffered a little in the last 2 seasons. BUT some decent Seinfeld is still better than anything else out there. There will be lines that will forever live in our brains probably long after we forget where they were came from.

On the whole, we were disappointed with the finale, even with Larry David back, it didn't quite live up to the end of a masterpiece. But then I thought about it. This was really the only way to end everything. Even Larry David said it was pretty pretty pretty clear what had to happen here. They had to go out on the exact same line that started the pilot. It's been 9 years, they've been through everything together and they have learned ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Jerry will never find a girlfriend that he can't find a fault, if it's the toothbrush, the man hands, the same clothes everyday, some Newman dumped, someone exactly like him or even someone who his parents approve of.

I can't wait to see what scene Jerry felt would complete the series. It should have been on this set, but the extras are as fantastic as they have been for the last 7 sets. Most shows dump their episodes onto discs, photoshot a menu and ship it. I mainly buy them for the extras since I can practicly recite the lines to most episodes and they have gone above and beyond with these extras.",1197936000,,1677,4.365384615384615

It is a long wish come true. I remember the days, when I was searching
for the ENTIRE series in VCD later DVD form. I found some vendor in UK,
but it was outrageously expensive.

I resorted to taping the entire series in VHS tapes. I had 12 of them!
Once the series started to come on DVD's - it was just unbelievable and
even letting go those almost dead tapes were hard :)

Have bought the entire series ( thro' Amazon ), this is surely my
precious collection.

The final DVD has one segment in the extras which I like the most -
Jerry, Larry David, Elane, George and Kramer talk about the series.

The words from Jerry that 'one of the reason I think as why this was so
successful was it was so close to reality that every body could relate
to'. He is absolutely correct on that point.

This was/still is so close and relatable to our daily life that we can
see and feel the humour in it, as we go thro' those moments - roaming in
a parking lot, waiting during a dr. appointment, being hungry and waiting
in a chinese restaurant, getting marketing calls etc. etc. etc.

After 8 wonderful seasons, this is the cherry on top of the cake. Without Larry David, it has explored different proposals for scripts, which has culminated in the, like it or not, epic final episode, this time with David back to writing.
'The Serenity Now' episode is unforgettable. Even though it is somewhat predictable, it is the kind of episode you can watch 1.000 times and it will still be funny.

2939511,4,B000VECAEO,"Ok. It's a known fact that the tone of the series changed dramatically when Larry David left. The eight and ninth seasons of Seinfeld are really different from the others. In the first seven seasons, there was at least a little bit (very little bit) of genuine comradeship and affection between the maisn characters. After that, they become the real selfish and greed guys they became known for...

Season Nine is good, but by any standards is far from great. (mainly when you compare it with the show's own very high standards!).There are uneven episodes, but none of them is bad by itself, and the show was far from jumping the shark. Maybe to avoid this at all costs was the reason why Jerry Seinfeld decided to call it a day (this, plus the fact that he was extremely tired from working on the show non-stop all that years - and the last two without support from David).

As for the final episode, I tought it was very good and absurd like the show itself. As lawyer Jack Chiles says in his opening statement to the jury, the absurd of the trial is that the criminal itself (the guy who robbed the fat guy) is free and people's taxes are being thrown away trying to convict the four guys who did not help, based on some silly Good Samaritan law! This concept itself was very funny. OFfcourse, it's very rare to see a sitcom end with the four main characters being in jail!!

2939538,4,B000VECAEO,"""The Merv Griffin Show"" is my single all-time favorite episode of the show. I was one of the people who felt let down by the series finale...it definitely wasn't ""MASH: Goodbye, Farewell & Amen."" I'm in agreement, for the most part, with the Amazon review...it was time for the show to say goodbye, and while they didn't sign off with their best season, the 24 episodes, taken as a whole, were still worthwhile. Some of the better-known and noteworthy episodes included: ""The Butter Shave"" (high point: Newman's struggle in dealing with his cannibalistic tendencies), ""The Voice"" (high point: Kramer's ""intern""), ""The Blood"" (high point: the return of Lloyd Bridges as Izzy Mandelbaum), ""The Junk Mail"" (high point: Wilford Brimley as the Postmaster General, played with the same menacing overtones as his role in ""The Firm""), ""The Merv Griffin Show"" (too many high points to list here), ""The Apology"" (also known as the ""naked girlfriend"" episode), ""The Strike"" (high point: ""Festivus""), ""The Dealership"" (high point: George's battle with the auto mechanic over his Twix bar).",1194652800,2,1077,5.195402298850575
2939539,5,B000VECAEO,"Instead of pushing the show beyond its natural life-span (think about the last years of The Andy Griffith Show or M*A*S*H), Seinfeld concluded at the peak of its popularity-- good move. This is why Season 9 stands up. Very funny stuff.

2939542,5,B000VECAEO,"I cannot believe that the government is allowing this collection of Seinfeld episodes to be sold.

When ""The Puerto Rican Day"" was first shown on television, it was appropriately met with outrage. Thereafter, it was pulled from syndication in deference to the tender sensitivities of Puerto Ricans, of which I consider myself one in communal spirit. The air- and cable-waves were cleansed, and years unfolded, allowing us all to forget the dark, dark day in America when such an offense aired to our collective shame. Sure, like most Americans I would have preferred a public apology from the President of the United States, reparations from Mr. Seinfeld et al, and the bestowal of statehood upon that poor, abused Commonwealth. None of that was to be, though, and the enlightened and politically correct among us would have to be content with the knowledge that never again would a human being be allowed to look upon this terrible, terrible sitcom episode.

Until now. What could possibly explain the episode's inclusion in this collection? Who knows what result awaits this country, what conflagrations will threaten the nation's peace as Puerto Ricans rise up and assert their birthright - a life free from ridicule from sitcom writers? I suggest we all pray for men's souls as the darkness descends.",1194307200,6,1304,5.06046511627907
2939543,5,B000VECAEO,"After nine hilarious seasons, Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis Dreyfus, Jason Alexander and Michael Richards say goodbye in ""Seinfeld: The Complete Ninth Season"". ""Seinfeld"" follows the funny misadventures of stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld and his close group of eccentric friends going through everyday life in New York City. In the final season, Jerry becomes annoyed when his rival Kenny Bania receives much success as a ""time slot hit"". George tries to preserve his decades-old high score on a Frogger machine. Elaine gets a big surprise when she is invited to a 13-year-old boy's bar mitzvah. Kramer finds the old studio set from ""The Merv Griffin Show"" and turns his entire life into a talk show. ""Seinfeld"" is the award-winning comedy series that became one of the most watched sitcoms on television. The ninth and final season has some very funny moments and clever subplots. The season includes such notable episodes like ""The Slicer"", ""The Betrayal"", ""The Merv Griffin Show"" and ""The Dealership"". The final episode features numerous cameo appearances, scored sky-high ratings but was heavily criticized by audiences and critics as being mediocre and unfulfilling.

Come celebrate the holidays around the Festivus pole and check out ""Seinfeld: The Complete Ninth Season"". All 24 hilarious episodes of the ninth and final season are presented in their original full screen format. The 4-disc DVD box set contains a clean and nicely detailed picture quality. Its 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is clear and well balanced. One of the most appealing features in the box set is the 20-minute ""The Last Lap"" featurette that focuses on the final days of the series. Other DVD extras include never-before-seen outtakes, deleted scenes, behind-the scenes interviews with the cast members and creators in the development of the series, production notes and audio commentaries with the cast members and production crew. Overall, ""Seinfeld: The Complete Ninth Season"" receives an ""A-"".",1193788800,21,1972,5.340836012861736
2939544,4,B000VECAEO,"The first time I ever really sat down and watched an entire ""Seinfeld"" episode was when they originally aired the final 2 episodes of the last season. I became interested, based off what I saw in the series finale, after all those years of ignoring the show. I've been watching re-runs and buying the DVDs ever since like clockwork (every November and May for the past 3 years). I sat here thinking to myself, ""Isn't it almost November? I wonder if the new 'Seinfeld' DVD is being advertised yet?"" So I checked Amazon.com and there it was, coming out next week! This show, like ""Married with Children"" was so innovative that it spawned many copy-cat shows that ended up looking inferior and unwatchable (Friends) to their predecessors. The ending starts at the beginning, basically stating that as shallow and misguided the characters were, the one thing they were looking for in other people was amongst themselves the whole time. They were meant to be together, and ended up that way, in jail. Hope I didn't ruin the ending. Jerry even mentioned it to Elaine in the episode where he released all his emotions: ""Maybe everything we've been looking for has been between us the whole time"". And Elaine reitterated that statement. Kramer may have said the exact same thing in an earlier episode, in ""The Fix Up"". The one thing I'm going to need closure on is to see the origin of that clip where Elaine has a dream that the 4 of them are all in the same bed. I've watched every episode and every deleted scene and I can't find it, except in that one clip show where it originated. What show is that from? If they don't reveal that in this last DVD set, I'll go ballistic!",1193616000,5,1669,4.566666666666666
2939545,4,B000VECAEO,"Because my family does ""Festivus"" (ours is in March during the MN High School Hockey Tournaments!) I've be waiting for ""The Strike"" episode (the 9th/final season of Seinfeld) to appear. Now I see that it's too high for me to budget in the $$ to pre-order. I thought Amazon.com was a ""discount"" site? I've always been very happy with Amazon up until now....now I think Amazon is going a bit far. I'll wait and see if it goes down once it's released. If it's still too high on Amazon,then I think I'll go ""on strike"" and go elsewhere to purchase it.",1192320000,,547,4.425742574257426
