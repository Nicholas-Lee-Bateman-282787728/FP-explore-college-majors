8368176,4,B002EQA0US,"Be warned that the movie is subtitled. I wish that I had known that beforehand. My wife and I sat down to watch it together but with subtitles that didn't work out very well.

The documentary itself was very good. I suspect that the film makers ran into a lot of difficulties, mostly from a bureaucracy that wasn't to keen to see this information in broad circulation, creating a factual account of Rabin's demise. The crux of the film was that the assassination had been an inside job. Most of us watching from the outside suspected this all along. These killings all follow a tried and true method of utilizing the ""lone nut"". I've come to the conclusion that all western ""democracies"" should be obliged to build monuments to their lone nuts' within a stones throw of their capital building. They are, after all, the cathartic that ensures that sane people never commandeer the pinnacles of power.

I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in the truth of Yitzhak Rabin's extrajudicial execution. He wanted peace, ""they"" wanted real estate. Were it not for the failure to warn of the subtitles I'd have given this a 5.",1360540800,,1130,4.730964467005077
