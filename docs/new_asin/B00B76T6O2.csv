5561049,5,B00B76T6O2,"I bought the whole collection, somehow knowing I'd like it.  I bought a Region 2 disc player just for this collection, that's how serious I was about purchasing the whole series.

I wouldn't hesitate buying this quality DVD.",1368835200,9,224,4.868421052631579
5561050,5,B00B76T6O2,"My mother's family comes from the British Isles. I started watching English mysteries from the time I was three years old. I have a deep love of a good mystery. This Danish Series is one of the best TV series that I have ever watched!!!!!!! It has you on the edge of your chair from beginning to end. This fast-paced story unfolds in twenty days. The script has so many twists and turns that you don't know who killed Nanna Birk Larsen until the very end.  It has multiple intertwining story lines that continuously impact each other. Each story is interesting on its own merit. The characters are believable and draw you into their lives. Sofie Grabel does a convincing job as the lead DCI Sarah Lund. She is smart, dedicated, and never gives up. She is a person you really want on your side if you're in trouble with the law. She is a fusion of Dirty Harry and Inspector Morse. In the course of 20 days they interview suspect after suspect, each one of whom could have committed the crime. The series depicts the underbelly of Copenhagen in dark edgy scenes and haunting music that only add to the intrigue and suspense.",1363824000,8,1122,4.5
5561061,4,B00B76T6O2,Very close to the American version which was made from it.  Interesting to see the story set in a foreign setting which ends up looking so similar to its American counterpart.,1419811200,,175,4.645161290322581

5561064,5,B00B76T6O2,"Wow, I saw the American version first and thought it was good. Although this danish original version is the real deal. Well played, suspenseful, the plot... just see it!",1409443200,,169,4.862068965517241
5561065,5,B00B76T6O2,"Brilliant, tense,well directed. Acting is superb. Suspense is intense. Combing political subplots and personal histories gives balance without distracting from the maim plot.",1407801600,,174,6.608695652173913
5561066,5,B00B76T6O2,Outstanding TV drama--probably the best I have ever seen. Excellent service from Amazon.,1404864000,2,88,5.846153846153846
5561067,5,B00B76T6O2,"This is a brilliant series and best watched in it's original language with subtitles - rather than other international remakes.  It is highly addictive viewing - I only wish they made more than 3 series.  My only complaint is the quality of the DVD's - a number of mine were corrupt and froze frequently or did not play at all.  The seller sent me replacement discs which were almost as bad as the first lot.  In the end I gave up and bought another set, brand new, from the local shopping mall - and thankfully these all played close to perfectly.  Well worth the money and the time to watch it.  If I could give it ten stars I would.",1403654400,2,635,4.25
5561068,5,B00B76T6O2,"The 1st season was absolutely addictive. Couldn't stop watching it. The plot was full of twists and turns, and never predictable.  Great drama. 2nd season was good. Currently watching 3rd season. Buy it, watch it.",1399507200,2,213,5.085714285714285
5561069,3,B00B76T6O2,"I didn't understand this: if you're an American viewer who's already seen the USA version, this is that series' story line, as it was originally put forth in the first two seasons. So if you love this show to freakin' death you'll luv watching this. Otherwise, seeing settings, personalities, shots, plotlines et al 'recapitulated' by the original series won't do much for you. I can't guarantee a perfect match: we stopped watching after two episodes because it just wasn't that compelling the second time around.

Just saying this because I didn't pick up on this vital point before shelling out for these other-region DVD's and a player that would play them.",1376006400,2,661,4.954954954954955
5561070,5,B00B76T6O2,this series is excellent and a star above the american version which i also enjoy.  I thought it was worth the chance of seeing if my computer could play region 2 and i am thrilled it can,1372464000,4,187,4.054054054054054

8563523,5,B00B76T6O2,"On par with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bron-Broen-The-Bridge/dp/B00GTKYHSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bron/Broen (The Bridge)</a>, here's a similarly top notch production released on the Nordic Noir label. In contrast to The Bridge, The Killing excels at casting doubt on nearly every character introduced, to the point where the only person you are sure didn't commit the murder is Sarah Lund, the central protagonist.
Bemusement reigns over not only the murder, but also other plotlines like the source of leaks in a political party (season 1). Starring Sofie Grbl, the acting is to be commended for nearly everyone involved. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic; less gritty than Bron/Broen, but capturing more color, vitality, and emotion. I urge you to consider the Blu-ray (if you have a player that can handle region B/2) release for this reason.

I had no idea there was an American remake of this series until just now when I read another review posted here. I can't imagine it being better than the original, but since ""for some reason [Americans] cannot read subtitles, or they don't want to"" (not my words, but Sofie Grbl's), it exists if you really can't abide subtitles.

My only complaint about Forbrydelsen, and it is extremely minor: episodes begin with a recap lasting ~2.5 minutes. Do Danes have poor memories?
As for price, it's easy to complain about it based on Amazon's US site. However, you can get this compilation of all 3 seasons for much cheaper (DVD or Blu-ray) if you go to Amazon's UK site (I'm assuming you already have a player that can handle foreign regions if you are considering this listing).

Final thoughts: A set of prototypical Danish programming that's as good a place to start as any if you are new to Nordic Noir serials, and reasonably priced if you buy from overseas.",1439769600,,1868,5.261744966442953
8563524,2,B00B76T6O2,"Thought I would like this series.  I like crime drama and I love foreign films, but this series just goes on and on and on for seemingly forever.  I just have to laugh every time they haul Troels Hartmann back into custody as a suspect again and again.  The subtitles were well done though.  As a 20 hour show it just doesn't hold up.  Maybe has enough material for a 2 hour movie.

If they got Bela Tarr to direct the show it could have been in real time and lasted 480 hours.  That would be some real viewing.
I don't know when I can stand to move on to the second series in this set.",1435622400,,586,4.0
8563525,4,B00B76T6O2,"An entertaining show worth a binge-watch.  But be advised that the television police of these Northern European countries seem to have a very conflicted relationship with their firearms, to the point of being inept.  SPOILER: this show also had a somewhat contrived-feeling formula of police cases becoming complicated by their national political campaigns.",1434326400,,357,5.716981132075472

8563528,5,B00B76T6O2,"The American version was good but this, the original series, IMO, is better. I breezed through the 20 episodes of the first season in 3 days. There are similarities with the American version but not enough to say it's a complete re-make. The second and final 3d season are all quite different from the American version.",1427155200,,319,4.714285714285714
