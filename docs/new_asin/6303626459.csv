728292,4,6303626459,"Hunchback is such a great film, Phantom too. What a unique individual Chaney was in Hollywood. Not at all your typical ""leading man"" or heartthrob, but he would be the #1 box office draw of his era. The man of 1000 faces, great stuff.",1446163200,,234,4.340909090909091
728293,5,6303626459,This is an excellent documentary on one of the great innovators and artists in early cinema. Lon Chaney was a giant who should not be forgotten!,1441065600,,144,4.576923076923077
728294,5,6303626459,"I would have liked to learn more about his deaf parents and what kind of a upbringing he had had.  Being deaf in those days were not easy, although Abe Lincoln signed off funds for every state to have an institution for the deaf.  They were trained for various jobs and did well in the outside world.  However, they stick together in a sub-culture, mostly deaf from the same institution.  They are phenomenal,in their body language and facial expressions.  That is how Lon Chaney was so successful.",1430006400,,498,4.67816091954023
728295,5,6303626459,I really enjoyed this one. It was very well done and had a lot of good outtakes of his films.,1429488000,,93,3.7
728296,4,6303626459,"This is not a bad documentary. It is pretty informative, the reason I give 4 stars is because of the narrator and the overall feel to it. Due to the length if the segments and the monotone of the narrators, you have to be very interested in Lon Chaney to stay awake.",1405382400,,266,4.134615384615385
728297,4,6303626459,Great history. Was hoping for some info on how he did his makeup. Overall I would recommend it to fans of old monster movies.,1401148800,,125,4.25
728298,2,6303626459,"Some folks that read my review may already be aware of the fact that Lon Chaney's parents were deaf. I believe this probably contributed significantly to Mr. Chaney's overall persona of ""mystery"" and ability to portray disabilities better than any actor in the history of film. Unfortunately, Lon Chaney: Behind the Mask is narrated by a gentleman with a nearly monotone voice that almost put me to sleep. This is more of a catalog of his films with ""the voice"" giving some historical background on the various films Lon Chaney appeared in and ultimately starred in throughout his career. I did enjoy seeing some of the home movies that were discovered from Chaney's private collection. We see him enjoying an evening sitting with friends and family in his living room, and he appears very comfortable and at ease, which I'm told did not come naturally to him when he was off the set.
I purchased the VHS tape since my mother does not care to own updated electronics.  I was disappointed the sound quality was not good at certain points for her to enjoy. I picked up some information from watching this production I was not formerly aware of, but I do hope the DVD offered better sound quality to anyone who opted to own this documentary.",1367280000,2,1238,4.7050691244239635
728299,3,6303626459,"I had been waiting for Kevin Brownlow and David Gill to get to Chaney. After all they have done the best work on the other geniuses of the silent era, it seemed only natural that they would tackle the premier actor of the  time. Unfortunately it doesn't look like it's going to happen. Instead we  are left with this mish-mosh which is little more than excerpts from the  Kino catalogue slapped together with no rhyme or reason and annoying  narrative full of fatuous pseudo-psychological insights with no apparent  research to back them up. The lone bright spot is the appearance of very  rare footage of Chaney off-camera. Too bad it couldn't have found a better  home.",964915200,5,671,4.732758620689655

7855355,4,6303626459,Fascinating history of one of my favorite horror stars.  Was unaware of all the movies in which he has appeared.,1484784000,,112,4.6
7855356,3,6303626459,"I am a (very) late-coming fan of Mr. Chaney. Its a tragedy he died with only one talky under his belt. This video was less a documentary than a clip collection. As such it was fascinating and tantalizing. As an informative bio of Chaney it lacked. You learn next to nothing of the fellow that you couldn't have picked up from a Wikipedia entry. The narration was mostly speculative and had a habit of coming to rather specious conclusions about the growth of his acting and quality of the movies he was in. It would have been nice to know more about his relationship with poor Creighton, his first marriage, his various struggles with producers and directors - all of which were either not mentioned or glossed over. Again, however, the clips really made this a worthwhile rental. The home movies were endearing (the man was a ham, point a camera at him and he was off!) and if the scenes from his movies doesn't make you try to seek them out immediately, well, you probably shouldn't be watching this doc.  Enjoyable but slight.",1482451200,,1029,4.592391304347826
7855357,4,6303626459,"Decent production, but nice insights into a star of days gone by.",1477785600,,65,4.5
7855358,5,6303626459,one of the greats,1476230400,,17,3.5
7855359,5,6303626459,Great bit of movie history.,1466553600,,27,4.6
7855360,3,6303626459,This movie is okay - but just skims the surface.,1464825600,,48,3.9
7855361,4,6303626459,I have been a long-time fan of Lon Chaney Sr.. I have always been impressed of his awesome artistic originality of creating facial prosthetics and utilizing makeup to bring the creatures he portrayed into a very realistic realm in the early years of motion pictures. This informative film gave a lot more very interesting information on the man's acting career and ingenuity than I was aware of previously. The only reason that I didn't give this a five star rating is because I wish this special presentation have given more personal information about the man's life off the screen.,1464739200,,583,4.898989898989899
7855362,2,6303626459,Good production-hard to critique a silent screen star though. Very informative.,1455667200,,79,6.2727272727272725
7855363,5,6303626459,Lon Chaney is truly a master at his craft. I was very excited about learning more about him. I would recomend this movie.,1449187200,,121,4.304347826086956
