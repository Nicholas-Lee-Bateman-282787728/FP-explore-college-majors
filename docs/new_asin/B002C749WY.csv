8432418,5,B002C749WY,I can absolutely recommend this film. Very interesting concept on how the mind can be manipulated. I also thought the acting to be very real in the sense of its low key vs. over the top Hollywood acting. The script is very well written and sure the Writer/Director does have quite some insight in to the inner workings of the brain.,1276905600,3,332,4.459016393442623
8432419,4,B002C749WY,"I bought the movie Freudian Eyebrow because I heard the experiment process was similar to what happens to psychology students in college psychology experiments and I am studying Psychology. I had rented the experimental movie Last Year at Marienbad and read that it was an example of hypnotism and hypnotic induction similar to the movie Freudian Eyebrow. Last Year at Marienbad was really weird because I didn't understand what was happening. Freudian Eyebrow is also an experimental film, but it is clear about what is happening at the very end. There are lots of hypnosis flashbacks and weird stuff with the date rape drug ""rohypnol"" that could have been hypnotism or the date rape drug. The whole eyebrow thing was really weird. The part about them getting paid $10,000, $100,000 and $1,000 was really cool because they weren't expecting to get paid anything and than they all start getting jealous of each other because they each get paid different amounts for the same thing (are so it seemed) I totally liked the movie and I bought a t-shirt with that Phyno Zeit guy on it to wear to school ""Remove Zee Dome Covers now!"" That dude was a freak. Definitely not your typical movie and it reminded me a lot of ""Napolean Dynamite"" with its weirdo characters and less like serious like the movie ""The Secretary.""",1269993600,4,1313,4.814159292035399

Daniel Fanaberia plays the dumb jock boyfriend trying to impress Crystal Young's character with his Personal Trainer experience while George Hawkins (Jojo) won't go anywhere with out his gris gris bag (great New Orleans vood doo sequence.) Makes you think twice about participating in psychology experiments in college!

The whole movie is ""camp"" a' la Napolean Dynamite. It just can't be taken seriously. Sit back and enjoy the fun, especially the surprise ending. Lots of symbolism and hypnotism throughout the movie.",1246492800,3,1026,6.706766917293233
