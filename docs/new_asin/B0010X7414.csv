8238874,4,B0010X7414,This seems to have been 'Season 3'.  (In the 'special features' the THIRD year is mentioned several times)  It should be called out that way.  'Series Finale' would presume ONE episode.  There were three.,1396828800,,204,4.911764705882353

8238876,5,B0010X7414,"I love this show! My siblings started watching it on youtube and I didn't have the patience to watch the episodes piecemeal and occasionally missing sound so I bought the entire series. This show is fantastic -- teaches alot about personal growth and understanding as well as team work and having patience with people. While watching the journey of the characters you tend to see yourself in their shoes and having their responses in your everyday battles. Not just good for kids but enjoyable for all ages beyond. It definitely has some more intense moments - wouldn't recommend for small children easily frightened (lightning strike, illness, shouting, injuries, etc). Essentially the kid version of the first season of Lost -- without the confusion. I have definitely enjoyed watching it and will be doing so again!",1294444800,,818,5.066666666666666

8238878,5,B0010X7414,"I can't say enough good things about the series Flight 29 Down. My kids and I watched the first season on broadcast television and loved it. The cast is outstanding. Discovery Kids decided to drop their affiliation with CBS, we anxiously awaited the release of season 2 on DVD.  When it finally came out, we noted the addition of a series finale movie. At first we were disappointed that the show had been cancelled, but the 2 seasons along with the finale movie really leave viewers quite satisfied. In Season 2, D.J. McHale slowly turns up the fire on the castaways until it reaches a fever pitch. The relationships that were built during the first season slowly disintegrate the group once again splits apart. It appears as though everything is lost. However, Hotel Tango provides a very satisfying resolution to the chaos. Lots of action, suspense and peril. Series themes include the development of survival skills, leadership, team building, and the concept of democratic rule.

(Parental Note: one of the characters wanders around in a bikini in a couple episodes of seasons 1 and 2)",1212192000,5,1090,4.886486486486486
