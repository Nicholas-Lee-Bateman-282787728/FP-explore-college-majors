7474504,5,B016KAMQTG,"Watched it live and it was everything I expected and more! The costumes, makeup, choreography, scene changes...I was practically in tears! All so perfect! I love The Wiz movie from 1978 (I wasn't born to see the play in 1975) and this is such a great, contemporary rendition. I love the little touches of Hip Hop and urban flair in the costumes and choreography. The Cowardly Lion has dreadlocks, Dorothy is wearing a plaid skirt with a cute blazer with leather accents and she had red glitter wedge sneakers on before getting the mirrored Mary Jane heels. Yup, no ruby slippers here. I love that Queen Latifah played the Wizard, a male character. Mary J Blige played a great Evilene. David Alan Grier as the Lion...he was made for that role. Ne-Yo and Elijah Kelly really got into their characters, their mannerisms were on point! Amber Riley was hilarious! Uzo Aduba as Glinda The Good Witch, what a contrast from her Orange Is The New Black Crazy Eyes character! How could I forget the return of Stephanie Mills in The Wiz, but as Aunt Em! So great seeing her! And Shanice Williams...wow, for a newbie this young lady NAILED IT!! We'll be seeing more of her in Hollywood for sure. You just need to order this. We all do. They need to bring this to Broadway. Stat.",1449187200,33,1266,4.581497797356828

7474508,5,B016KAMQTG,"I recorded this when it first aired, but for some reason my DVR deleted it.( I guess there is a time limit for storing). I really enjoyed this live version of the Wiz. I am a fan of the Wizard of Oz, The Wiz (movie), Wicked (the play) and even Oz the Great and powerful (movie). I was not fortunate enough to see The Wiz on Broadway in 1975 (my next door neighbor saw it, and bragged about it, we were kids). Shanice is from 2 towns away from me, and was wonderful portraying Dorothy, Stephanie Mills as Aunt Em was perfect and sounded great! Ne-yo singing ""What would I do if I could feel"", wow!
Nice to see Queen Latifah and Elijah Kelly (Hairspray) together again, he is very talented! Mary J. Blige's dance during ""No bad news"" one of her famous steps she used here.  I paid $5 for this DVD and got so much for it! Behind the scenes and all.",1518998400,,845,4.152439024390244

7474531,2,B016KAMQTG,"I started watching the TV live musicals backwards, Hairspray first and then Grease. I thought both were excellent. I read a number of reviews that were unkind about the early ones - Sound of Music and Peter Pan - but raved about The Wiz. I don't see why.

I'm not familiar with either the movie or Broadway version of this show so this was my first intro to the music and the show. I thought the music was weak, lacking any really compelling or high energy songs. By contrast, the songs and dancing in both Hairspray and Grease are uplifting and highly engaging. Many of the songs are big ensemble numbers which adds to my enjoyment. Most of the songs in The Wiz were individual or small group.

Not sure what all the hype was about having Cirque du Soleil performers in the show. Their contributions were underwhelming. I've seen a number of Cirque shows - it's some of the best entertainment you can see.  Any dancer with some gymnastics training could do what was done for this show.

Colorful costumes is about all I can come up with as a positive recommendation. I thought the staging and backdrops were boring.  The open lot, multistage approach of Hairspray and Grease were far more interesting. The Wiz didn't even seem live. The music sounded very canned.

My tween kids, both of whom love musicals, perform in musical theatre, and enjoy the Wizard of Oz movie, wandered off early in the show - not interested in it at all. It was a cheap DVD but I spent too much.",1486771200,,1473,4.49812734082397

I just watched THE WIZ LIVE with a very skeptical eye going in.  THE WIZ LIVE was certainly one of the most pleasant surprises I have enjoyed in a long time!  Dare I say, the writing and story of THE WIZ LIVE far surpasses that of the movie.  No need to compare the two, but the overall enjoyment and heart of this production is absolutely wonderful!  The one and only thing I would have changed is to film it in front of a live audience to get the amazing response that would have absolutely been present.  I am often looking for movies to send my sister and her family, who are pretty conservative and protective of what their family watches, and THE WIZ LIVE is enjoyable family entertainment at its absolute best!",1454544000,,839,4.380645161290323

7474673,5,B016KAMQTG,"I LOVED LOVED LOVED The Wiz as a child so I was excited and scared to see this when it originally aired. They were messing with a very good childhood memory and I wasn't sure if I wanted them to do that. So the night it aired the kids took early baths and I told them they could stay up later than their normal bedtime to watch it with us. I was so completely THRILLED with this rendition that I purchased it right away. It was beautiful (colors and scenery) and the actors did a great job. My children were also won over because they were completely mesmerized during the show and that's a tall feat for a 9, 7 and 5 year old.",1452038400,,627,4.064516129032258
7474674,5,B016KAMQTG,"If you saw NBC's live productions of The Sound Of Music and Peter Pan, forget them - even if Peter Pan was a slight improvement over The Sound Of Music. The Wiz Live forgoes cheap stunt casting that inspires snark more than admiration and, instead, casts plenty of big names that have both acting AND singing talent to carry this production. While some of the supporting cast may falter a bit in acting, (I'm looking at you, Ne-Yo.) there's plenty of talent here, especially with newcomer Shanice Williams as Dorothy. She's adorable, sings beautifully, and displays plenty of confidence in her acting abilities. For someone who's pretty green, she does well here and can only get better if she continues to work in the business. She's surrounded by some great supporting players, including the legendary Stephanie Mills as Aunt Em. Stephanie Mills is best-known for creating Dorothy in the original Broadway production of The Wiz, and to have her grace this production, even if only briefly, is a nice touch, and she even gets to sing! Other great supporting players include Glee's Amber Riley as Addaperle, Queen Latifah in an incredible gender-bending performance as The Wiz, Mary J. Blige beautifully chewing the scenery as Evillene, David Allan Grier as the Lion, Ne-Yo as the Tin Man, Elijah Kelley as the Scarecrow, and Uzo Aduba as Glinda. All performing classics from the original score, plus a new song titled ""We Got It,"" all with a new book by Tony-winner  Harvey Fierstein and choreography from the acclaimed Fatima Robinson.

Dancers from Cirque Du Soliel also step in, providing some of the production's best moments, such as the tornado, the flying monkeys, and the Poppy Girls, which leads me to another one of the production's strengths. The past two productions tried to make everything feel less stage-bound with bigger, fuller sets. The Wiz Live actually pays homage to the musical's stage roots and basically creates the best Broadway theater stage of all time, with video screens behind the actors creating background sets that can change at a moment's notice if need be with amazing backdrops, great effects, and even a floor that can change appearances when necessary. It still feels like you're attending a Broadway theater - just the biggest, best Broadway theater you can build.

The video and audio quality of the DVD are decent. My only complaint is that NBC always airs these in early December, then rush-releases the DVD's before Christmas. The problem with that is they don't have time to create subtitles, nor a good quality encode for a simultaneous Blu-Ray release. In my humble opinion, it'd be better to wait to release these until Easter so that they can release a good Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack with subtitles. Maybe release a quickie $10 barebones DVD close to Christmas for those who can't wait or don't care about subtitles, bonus material, and HD, and also announce a Blu-Ray/DVD combo with bonus materials to come out in March for those who would rather wait for such a release. NBC has yet to release their previous two productions on Blu-Ray, which is baffling considering they were broadcast in HD and one can download the HD rips if they only know where to look. There's no excuse for DVD-only releases of HD broadcasts anymore, except maybe to get product on the market ASAP while working on a Blu-Ray version to come out in a few months. Regardless, if you enjoyed the production, you should absolutely pick up this DVD to show your support and let NBC know that they did right by this production - hopefully, the sales will convince them to release a Blu-Ray in the future. At least the DVD does feature logical chapter stops, generally where the commercial breaks were, but doesn't have a chapter menu. I can't say if the previous two productions have those as well, as I don't own those DVD's. As with the previous two specials, this DVD also features the making-of documentary that aired on NBC.

The Wiz Live hasn't exactly restored my faith in NBC's new annual tradition of live televised musicals - after all, a broken clock is still right twice a day. Hopefully their choice for 2016's musical will be a good one and they will have learned their lesson from this production that stunt-casting a big name for ratings doesn't do any good if the people watching are spending the entire time snarking on the wooden, stiff, amateur acting (Carrie Underwood, you have a beautiful singing voice and you're a beautiful girl, but don't act anymore, please.) or the fact that one of the main actors isn't even trying and just appears not to give a hoot. (Christopher Walken, you're a legend and a great talent, but why didn't you make ANY effort?) Hopefully for their next musical, they'll continue casting big names with acting AND singing talent, especially for the more important roles that require the most screen time, and continue making bold decisions with costumes, sets, staging, lighting, etc. so that their annual musicals can be something the audience actually enjoys and not something you watch for the snark to post on Twitter.",1452038400,6,5086,4.883101851851852

I was not disappointed in any way everyone from the actors, singers, dancers, the talent of Cirque du Soleil being invited to be apart of the performance, all the work of the stage crew to make sure everything was where it was supposed to be, when was it supposed to be and all the star and glitter just finished everything off.

Die hard fans may notice that this DVD edits out some of the bloopers that occurred on the original NBC broadcast. We now see Dorothy's heels clicked three times, all the pyrotechnics firing properly and no accidental shots of the TV cameras. Also, the performances have been subtly pitch corrected, but it is done tastefully and you wouldn't suspect a thing unless you saw the original live broadcast. All of these edits, to me, benefit this DVD release and embellish what was already a spectacular production. If you're on the fence about this DVD, get it!",1451433600,14,694,4.88135593220339

7474692,5,B016KAMQTG,"I must confess, I had never seen The Wiz until NBCs production of The Wiz Live! last week.  (Actually, when you consider the number of classic musicals Ive never seen or just seen for the first time in the last couple of years, thats not so surprising).  So when I sat down to watch the new version, I had no expectations or preconceived notions.  What I discovered was that I was transported into the story within minutes and was having a marvelous time.

Even if youve never seen this musical, you are familiar with the story.  Originally created for Broadway and turned into a film in the 1970s, this is the story of The Wizard of Oz.  The twist is that it has an all African American cast (there was one exception in the chorus here).  Its been updated with some 70s urban jokes and references, and the songs all have a 70s Motown flavor.

Just in case you aren't familiar with the story at all, we follow Dorothy (Shanice Williams), a teen who is living on her aunts farm in Kansas but desperately wants to return to her friends in Omaha.  When she gets caught up in a storm, she finds herself in Oz.  Her only hope of getting home lies in meeting The Wiz (Queen Latifah), who rules over The Emerald City.  Along the way, she meets Scarecrow (Elijah Kelley), Tin Man (Ne-Yo), and Cowardly Lion (David Alan Grier), and they join her, searching for rewards of their own.  Will The Wiz be able to help them?

This is the third in NBCs annual productions where they take a classic stage musical and film a live production of it.  Its met with mixed results since live theater without an audience and filmed doesnt always translate well to the screen.  In my mind, this production was the best one yet.

As is always the case, the sets, makeup, and costumes were fantastic.  No expense was spared and they looked great.  Yes, they are still obviously soundstages, but thats part of the charm of these productions.  They are meant to be soundstages and not sets for another film version.  Put yourself in that mindset, and youll get swept up into the story before you know it.

The actors were all top notch this year as well.  Of course, thats not surprising when you consider all the greats in the cast.  Still, no one was nervous or just going through the motions like Ive felt over the last two years.  They were engaging and fun to watch, bringing their characters to life perfectly.  The new comers, like lead Shanice Williams, were all perfect as well.  In fact, I predict a long, bright career for Shanice; she was fabulous!  And in a fun note, Aunt Em was played by Stephanie Mills, who originally played Dorothy when the show moved to Broadway in 1975.

In fact, that would be my only real complaint about the film.  It is obvious that the musical was created 40 years ago, and if you don't like Motown, you won't like the music.  Additionally, a few of the jokes were dates.  However, I found myself laughing through much of the production since most of the jokes still work, and smiling at the music.  Again, know the roots of the film going in and youll be fine.

There are plenty of dance numbers; this is a musical after all.  They were all fantastic, and the cast was a lot of fun to watch as they danced across the various stages.

Since this is essentially a filmed play and not a true movie in the traditional sense, you won't find that many special effects.  Smoke and lights help cover some entrances and exits, and you can see the wires when the cast members are flying.  The giant puppet used for the Wiz early on is absolutely fantastic and the best effect in the piece.  Again, thats how it is supposed to be.  About the only thing that seemed a bit odd to me was the storm that transported Dorothy to Oz, but its a minor issue.

In fact, any quibble I had with this production is a minor issue.  It was fun from start to finish.  If, like me, you aren't familiar with The Wiz, this live production is the perfect way to view this retelling of an American classic.",1449705600,3,3988,4.406849315068493
7474693,5,B016KAMQTG,"I liked it. It looks like a real stage show and the music is right from the movie with Diana Ross. The costumes and song productions were really great, and I found myself singing along like an old pro after watching the Diana Ross version countless of times. I thought it was very thoughtful they asked Miss Stephanie Mills to star in it, and she looks GREAT. She sang great too. Nice reboot.",1449532800,3,392,4.383561643835616
7474694,5,B016KAMQTG,My 7 year old grand daughter loves this we got it recorded on prime time and she watches it 3 times a day...the cast is brilliant..the costumes the props..all amazing.. I plan on getting this for her for many of popcorn nights to come,1449446400,,234,4.340909090909091
7474695,5,B016KAMQTG,Loved the live performance! Definitely want to add to my collection.  BLU-RAY PLEASE!!!!,1449360000,3,88,5.769230769230769
7474696,5,B016KAMQTG,Well everyone has their own opinion but trust me this is the best live performance that will get you up on your feet! This live musical is phenomenal and it brought tears of joys to my eyes. Everyone in this musical is talented and it will blow you away! I would have to disagree with a few of the comments on here. There's a reason why Kenny Leon chose Shanice Williams! Shanice is truly a star and I hope to see her in even more future projects!,1449360000,6,447,4.149425287356322
7474697,2,B016KAMQTG,"If this is the best Dorothy the producers could come up with, they were not looking hard enough.  No charm, poor singer, worse dancer.  There are hundreds of talented young black actresses out there.  If the main star isn't star material then great sets, creative staging and good production will NEVER make up for it.  A film with the original Broadway star Stephanie Mills in the key role of Dorothy should have been made 40 years ago - she carried the day.",1449360000,3,459,4.560975609756097
7474698,5,B016KAMQTG,Brought tears to my eyes and made me get up dance just like the original did. A fantastic production. Shanice Williams has a bright future ahead of her!,1449360000,3,152,4.464285714285714
7474699,3,B016KAMQTG,"At least the dvd won't have all the annoying commercials that made it seem more like a taped show than a live broadcast.  The only performer I enjoyed was Stephanie Mills.  It was obvious that she is truly a veteran and still has it over the rest of the cast.  She was, IS, awesome.  The original!!",1449360000,5,298,4.267857142857143
7474700,5,B016KAMQTG,"The WIZ was way better than I expected. I'm also not a fan of Broadway musicals but the WIZ changed my mind. I loved the singing, acting, costumes, actors and choreography! I loved the song Neyo's sung ""What would I do if I could feel"" I can't wait for the soundtrack!!!! AA+++",1449273600,5,277,4.346153846153846

7474703,5,B016KAMQTG,This was fun. I enjoyed it. I am not a musical person. I don't like alot of singing.  But this was a change of pace. Very Entertaining.,1449273600,11,135,4.0
7474704,2,B016KAMQTG,"Shanice Williams seemed miscast, did not come across like a young girl, was taller than her Aunty and just about everyone else, but gave a decent performance.  They are getting better at production with these live shows, but the show itself did little for me, as was the original flop.  I got bored and turned it off even sooner than Pan which was pretty boring itself.  Despite some of the production flaws (background hiss most notably), Sound of Music still their best so far.",1449273600,4,479,4.678571428571429
