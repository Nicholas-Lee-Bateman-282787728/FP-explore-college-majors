2355217,4,B000A3455I,"The military is experimenting, with just enough knowledge to be dangerous.  They are using a mass of electronic impulses  called ""Haarp""  to enter the upper atmosphere, which in turn can modify the weather, causing earthquakes, floods, droughts, tornadoes, and hurricanes.  No one really knows what destruction these experiments are doing to the upper ionosphere,  and without such knowledge it could basically be disastrous for all mankind.
These impulses can also be used for mind control.  The downside to all this, is they have no idea what the long term results of these experiments will be. They essentially have a weapon of destruction, that could otherwise be used as a potential benefit to civilization, by controlling weather in a positive way.  Research is a necessary step toward improving life for all of civilization, but it should not be made functional until proven safe.  I recommend this for anyone who is interested in knowing why our weather has changed so dramatically over much of the country.",1401926400,5,1015,5.146341463414634
2355218,3,B000A3455I,"By far and away the scariest part of this film was at the end - literally, the very end.  It read like this:  ""Copyright 1998.""  Fourteen years ago!  That means either scientists and activists have lost interest in HAARP; or else there's been a major campaign to suppress information about HAARP; or else this whole HAARP scare really was nothing but a crock of crap concocted by the Tin-Foil Hat Brigade.  Or, as a more sinister alternative to explain the lack of investigation into HAARP, perhaps those who, at the outset, began focusing on the technology were ""plants,"" sent out to so discredit any critique that no serious researcher would touch it with a ten-foot pole.  At this point in time, absent any further attempts to document the science behind HAARP or the uses that have been made of it or the dangers associated with its use, one has to conclude that the whole thing was nothing more than a ""tempest in a teacup.""  (Note: there is a DVD out there, an update by Dr. Nick Begich produced in 2007.  I plan to get that and review it to see if anything new has developed.)

Dr. Nick Begich and Jeane Manning, who co-wrote ""Angels Don't Play This HAARP,"" are featured presenters, along with Dr. Bernard Eastlund, whose patents in the 1980's led to the HAARP technology, Dr. Beverly Rubik, a biophysicist, and Dr. Patrick Flanigan, an electromagnetic researcher.  Each one explains what the HAARP technology could be capable of.  However, it's of little value in and of itself to simply say what HAARP - or any - technology is capable of doing under certain conditions.  That HAARP could affect living systems in a number of negative ways is interesting.  But without data showing how these specific effects might happen or showing that they have, in fact, happened, whether directly traceable to HAARP or not, this becomes not only speculation but speculation of the most foolhardy manner because it can so easily be dismissed as mere ""Conspiracy Theory.""

Common sense tells you it can't be good for the environment to go skeet shooting with a billion watts of energy.  But, as we know, common sense holds little currency within the scientific community.  And, unfortunately, as we should also know by now, common sense is sometimes highly over-rated.",1343347200,4,2262,4.821243523316062
2355219,3,B000A3455I,"I purchased this item based on the raving Amazon reviews, but wasn't that impressed with it.
The quality of the production/video made it look like it was made in the 1980s... and, quite frankly, it was boring.

It provides a general background on what HAARP is, but doesn't go into the conspiracy theory stuff that has given HAARP the profile it now has. It basically says: Okay so there's this technology and the US government is doing such type of tests with it (innocent blue sky research) - and we don't know what the implications are/will be, all we know is that they are messing with nature and so that must be bad. The End.

What about the potential for weather-warfare? The video doesn't mention zapping seismic faults which could cause earthquakes - as demonstrated in lab-scale experiments.

I was hoping to show this to some friends to raise awareness... but this is not the doco to do that with. It didn't teach me anything apart from what I had already learnt from YouTube.",1296086400,4,986,4.655172413793103

2355224,5,B000A3455I,"As the author of two books dealing with HAARP (""WEATHER WARFARE: The Military's Plan To Draft Mother Nature,"" and ""HAARP: The Ultimate Weapon of the Conspiracy"") I can assure you that HOLES IN HEAVEN is no tin foil hat lunacy but the real deal. HAARP is very real and very dangerous, as this film makes abundantly clear.

HAARP is the largest and most powerful United States Department of Defense (DoD) facility of its kind in the world -- just what kind of facility it is, however, has been the subject of heated debate for many years.

Located in southeastern Alaska, HAARP is a field of antennas so constituted that it works as one giant antenna. Moreover, it is the world's largest radio broadcasting station, now with an effective radiated power of 3.6 million watts -- more than 72,000 times more powerful than the largest legal commercial radio station (50,000 watts) in the United States! But, HAARP's broadcasts are not intended for human ears. Its purpose is to inject all that radio frequency energy into a ""spot"" at the very top of the atmosphere, in a region called the ionosphere.

Why do they want to inject all that energy into the ionosphere? Doing so mimics the way the sun injects energy into the same region of the atmosphere. By artificially recreating natural phenomena they hope to better understand the processes and problems caused by solar flares and such and, more importantly, to control and create various ionospheric conditions, thus giving the DoD the ability to modify the atmosphere in furtherance of military objectives.

Some researchers think HAARP may be an over-the-horizon type radar ... or it may exist to destroy incoming ICBMs ... or perhaps to fry out the electronics of enemy spy satellites ... or it might be used to disrupt enemy radio communications. Researchers think it might be intended to do these things because those abilities are all described in the original 12 patents that the HAARP antenna array is based on. HOLES IN HEAVEN includes a lengthy interview with Dr. Bernard Eastlund, the leader of the team that wrote those patents and the holder of three of them (including the first that all the others are spin-offs from). The folks running HAARP deny any connection between HAARP and those patents, however. This, naturally, has opened them up to charges of cover-up and conspiracy.

Construction was announced to have been completed at HAARP in the spring of 2006, but it had been in use, at varying output strengths, since 1995. Even before HAARP began running its first tests researchers were looking into what this technology might be capable of. Several of the principal HAARP researchers, like Dr. Nick Begich, Jeane Manning and Patrick Flanagan are interviewed in this film.

I wrote ""HAARP: The Ultimate Weapon of the Conspiracy"" in 1998 with the intent to sort out truth from fiction in the many claims about what HAARP could or could not do. I first viewed HOLES IN HEAVEN after that book was released. I wish I had seen it sooner! Great stuff! With excellent visuals and important interviews, this film is a ""must see"" for anyone wanting to know more about HAARP or the military's interest in using the earth's natural systems as weapons or as ""force multipliers.""",1163289600,45,3234,4.892335766423358
