8594097,3,B000AHK02G,"Good introduction to Cambodia's Angkor Wat. Leonard Nimoy, ""Mr. Spock's"" voice offers a  nice touch too.  I would recommmend this for those interested in traveling to this region in order to get a perspective on the culture and teasures awaiting visitors.  I am anticipating a trip to Angkor Wat in the near future and think this presentation was a good start. I think the price was right for this VHS tape!!",1279411200,,408,4.71830985915493
