First be forewarned, this is an ""R"" rated movie. I missed that when ordering. The first time I watched it, I was convinced it was the most moronic movie ever made. But it grows on you. I am a fan of bad movies. And this is a bad movie. But just weird enough and off beat enough to become a classic right along ""Plan 9 for Outer Space"". Bad dialogue, crappy special effects, poor screen play, this movie has it all. Yet I immeadiately wanted to show it to all my friends, so they could see just how bad it is. If ""50"" is the new ""30"", then ""bad"" is the new good. Just put the kids to bed first before watching!",1202774400,4,786,5.10077519379845
8029083,2,B0002M5U4C,The whole movie needs to be edited. Jokes start off funny but lose it because they go on and on. I think it would have worked if it was a 20 minute short.,1135728000,3,154,3.696969696969697
8029084,4,B0002M5U4C,"This movie cracked me up!  Every scene in this movie made me laugh - sometimes it was a slapstick laugh and sometimes it was an ""oh my god, I can't believe they did that"" laugh.  Patrick Voss (Robot Monkey Lab, special effects guru) wrote - with Adam Hackbarth - and directed this hilarious parody of two X-file-esque agents caught up in the alien abduction of a family of inbred rednecks.  The special effects range from finely detailed to deliberately funny, but are all very well done and are the backbone of the entire movie showing the great talent of Patrick Voss and his crew.  I guarantee you will have a great time watching this movie.  I will warn you though that this movie has some really raunchy humor in it.  Recommend highly!!!",1121644800,4,742,4.583333333333333
8029085,4,B0002M5U4C,"This is a must see sci-fi comedy.  The one and only independent comedy I can watch again and again, and still laugh my ass off.  Crazy rednecks chasing aliens through the hills of Arkansas and crazy aliens abducted rednecks for sexual entertainment.  Hilarious non-stop action with tons of awesome special effects including flying saucers, giant alien costumes, and laser guns that vaporize anything they hit.  The flying saucer interiors are dressed like a MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000 set which adds to the humorous overtones.  From Adam Hackbarth, Patrick Voss and Eric Stanze comes INBRED REDNECK ALIEN ABDUCTION.",1121299200,3,617,5.319587628865979
8029086,5,B0002M5U4C,"For fans of MST3K who want to relive that experience, this movie is for you. All you need is this DVD, beer and few friends. With Special Effects(that aren't so special), great jokes and a better story than most studio blockbusters, this movie is way better than it has any right to be. Buy this movie, and I guarantee you won't regret it. It sure beats going to the megaplex.",1120435200,4,376,4.385714285714286
