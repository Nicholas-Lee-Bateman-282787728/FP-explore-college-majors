I first saw it on television and now I have ordered it so that I can see it again and again.  I love the travel between the cities of New York and San Francisco.  It is just plain WONDERFUL.

2247477,2,B0007WQHDK,"I received the product before time,  However, it's a pal copy and my system does not have it on it.  I didn't notice it on the write up and now I don't see how to return this movie.  I am stuck with a movie I cann't watch.  I have been searching for this movie a very long time and now I have found it and cann't watch it.  I am glad it was not movie review club night because it would have been a mess.  Not recommending this carrier to anyone.
This has tought me to make sure all my movies are compatable for my system.  Becareful make sure if it says PAL your system can play it.",1374710400,4,582,3.8813559322033897

Thank you

2247480,5,B0007WQHDK,"I've been looking for this movie for several years and was really pleased when I found somewhere where it was able to be ordered, but very disappointed that I couldn't get it in the United States.  I only paid $10+, which included shipping, but when it came, I couldn't play it (and still can't) on any of my DVD players (and we have three).  I finally discovered that it would ony play on ""Region 2"".  My blue-ray machine actually gave me that message. The message gave me a ""Region code"" to use, but it didn't work either, because TV remotes don't have astericks on them.  I was furious!  At some later, I discovered by accident that I can play it on my computer, which I found to be strange.  I did contact the company I purchased it from and they did respond with a nice email, telling me that Region 2 movies only play on SOME American DVD players.  WELL, why don't YOU post that on your website?  I don't even recall it saying ""Region 2 only"" either.  Not only that, until this happened, I didn't even know there were regions!  So, I did learn something here and that was to always check the playable region.",1369440000,8,1114,4.364077669902913
2247481,1,B0007WQHDK,This was in a europe format and I couldn't watch it I need to know how to return it and get this in the USA format,1368230400,,114,3.423076923076923

2247496,5,B0007WQHDK,"This is one of the most romantic movies ever. It has a magic to it. You know Raphaella loves her husband, but she's not IN LOVE with him. Enter Robert Urich. This is a wonderful, romantic movie.",1342742400,,194,4.27027027027027

2247498,5,B0007WQHDK,"My uncle of all people was the one that recommended this movie to me.  At first I was skeptical but I rented it and loved it!  Usually this type of movie is considered a ""chick flick"" but I think this particular movie caters to both men and women.  It is a very romantic and tastefully done movie.  I recently purchased the movie and sent it to my uncle as a ""thank you"" gift and he couldn't be happier.",1176249600,4,403,4.128205128205129

2247500,5,B0007WQHDK,"I love Robert Urich, so anything with him starrring in it is great! He really was a great actor, and I was extremely sad when he lost his battle with cancer a few years back.

A Perfect Stranger is a beautiful love story written in typical Danielle Steele fashion. You cry and hurt for those involved, but you know you're going to get a happy ending, so it's all worth it!",1140825600,16,372,4.23943661971831
2247501,3,B0007WQHDK,"But I personally think, there are three things that makes the essence of a good romance: good story (it is one), beautiful and talented leading actress (she is one), but also a dashing leading actor (sorry, he is not one). I certainly don't mean the acting, they are all very good, especially the pleasant voice of Mr. Urich and Mr. McGaven.",1139011200,2,341,4.60655737704918
