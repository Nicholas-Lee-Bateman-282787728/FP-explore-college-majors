8439978,3,B000A5N4FS,"First let me say I am a fan of both rotary and the Hardy one plane swing.  In this DVD chuck Quinton, creator of rotary swing, is advocating more of the traditional hardy one plane swing.  But my ok rating is that this is only a thirty minute video and if you are looking for an indepth analysis of one plane swinging this is not for you.  It gives a ""cliffs note"" if you will take one plane swing and three drills to help the beginner well, begin.  My advice would be to take the money for this DVD and put it towards Chuck Quinton's website or Hardy's website it will serve you better.  I think Chuck Quinton is an awesome teacher and his website is great but this DVD is not for rotary swing.  This is the RS1 swing not the RST, this was Quinton first swing theory.",1311033600,3,768,4.120805369127517
