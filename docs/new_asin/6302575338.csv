This is another great laserdisc collection that has yet to be re-released on DVD/Bluray (but sadly it won't likely happen anytime soon). This set contains all of Tex Avery's MGM cartoons, which are his best works. Some of the best cartoons on the set include ""What's Buzzin' Buzzard"", ""Northwest Hounded Police"", ""Red Hot Riding Hood"", ""Rock A Bye Bear"", ""House Of Tomorrow"" and many others. Also on this set you will find shorts that can't be currently found anywhere else. Chief among these are 2 politically incorrect shorts ""Uncle Tom's Cabana"" and ""Half Pint Pygmy"". (there are also a few that aren't currently available on DVD or Bluray at the moment) Unfortunately 2 shorts are edited. ""Droopy's Good Deed"" and ""Garden Gopher"" have Un-PC gags removed, although I'm not sure if that was intentional or not. Droopy's Good Deed has since been released uncensored on the more recent Droopy DVD collection, while Garden Gopher cannot be found uncensored on any video format (but I've seen it in circulation on places like youtube). As I stated in other reviews, while the format is obsolete (and even obscure to most people), if you're a classic animation fan, this laserdisc collection is a must have.",1375747200,8,1243,4.980769230769231
