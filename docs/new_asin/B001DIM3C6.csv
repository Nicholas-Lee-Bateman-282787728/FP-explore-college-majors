8293568,5,B001DIM3C6,I enjoy watching older movies.  These two were especially entertaining.  A very young Tyrone Power.  Girl's Dormitory has a surprise ending.  I wasn't expeciting it.  Cafe Metropole was fun with Tyrone Power being pressed to pretend he is someone he isn't at Adolphe Menjou's request.  Both movies worth the watching.,1418256000,,317,5.24

8293570,5,B001DIM3C6,"Cafe Metropole is a delight. With Tyrone Power in a comedy, after not being able to pay a debt, he is asked to pretend to be a Russian Prince to be with the daughter of rich American,by Cafe owner Adolphe Menjou aiming to get some of his money. Loretta Young is the daughter who is won over but the things that goes on from here is not worth saying without spoiling it for you.
Girls Dormitory has an unknown in the one of  the leads, a French Actress. and Herbert Marshall plays a teacher. Tyrone Power makes his film debut in a small part. It's a tale of forbidden love of student and teacher. Well Acted. If you find these titles, give them a try.",1392681600,,650,4.2
8293571,5,B001DIM3C6,"Girls' Dormitory -- I expected a comedy and instead got a ""romance"" film about an academy professor and a girl student.  Performances were good, but I was disappointed that Tyrone had only a minor supporting role with little screen time, and was not the headline star.  Good movie, all  the same.
Caf Metropole -- Good ole classic screw-ball comedy from the 1930s, with excellent performances by Tyrone Power, Loretta Young, and Adolphe Mejou.  The entertainment is well worth the price.",1378598400,,487,5.05

8293573,5,B001DIM3C6,"CAFE METROPOLE is a classic romantic comedy starring two of the decades leading stars... Tyrone Power and Loretta Young.  Ty's acting is a little strained at times due to his youth and inexperience but Loretta more than makes up for it and together they make quite a couple.  The supporting players are heavyweights in their own right, but it is Adolphe Menjou who stands apart from all the others.  It's almost as if this play was written for him.  For pure entertainment this tops the chart.",1369612800,2,493,4.6976744186046515
8293574,4,B001DIM3C6,"This double feature presents two light dramas from the '30's. The technical aspects of the disc are fine, no problems here. The problem lies with the misleading marketing: It is presented as a Tyrone Power double feature and I bought it hoping to see a lot of Power in his young and gorgeous days. Well, caveat emptor: the  picture ""Girls' Dormitory"" provides Power with ...about all of three minutes' screen time. And ! it's all at the end of the picture, obliging one to sit through a rather turgid and sappy story.
  The second picture, ""Cafe Metropole"" features Power in a starring role - and he is beautiful.
So, my advice is: if you are a Power fan and want to see him, be aware that you will really only be getting, in effect, one picture.
  If you simply enjoy classic pictures from the '30's, you will probably appreciate this double feature.",1310342400,3,851,4.572368421052632
8293575,5,B001DIM3C6,"These 2 old classics on 1 DVD of the 1930s with the heartthrob Tyrone Power are great fun to watch!  A new generation must see them!  Amazon's
companies are wonderful to offer them at great prices.  I'm starting
a collection.",1244764800,7,225,4.575
