I've tried Power90, Beach body, Tae-Bo....but there is something about this workout that beats the other programs hands down...It's  so addictive in positive way. I love what it has done to for my body.  I was in good shape before...But now, in great shape!  What I like most is that you get a total body workout...every muscle in your body in the shortest amount of time.  A plus for busy lives!  This is a must buy...You will absolutely love the program!!!  Any workout programs that Commander Tom produces, you should definitely purchase...you will be so glad you did!

Commander Tom is the BEST!!!",1208304000,12,635,4.761467889908257
3147091,5,B0015RCUAU,"This program has helped me get a lot to get fitter, leaner and more defined. It's great as it's fun and well thought through.",1208304000,4,125,4.25
3147092,4,B0015RCUAU,"This is a decent workout. I am used to HIIT training so this was not very challenging for me, however I can pick up the pace and go faster to work harder.",1363305600,,154,3.84375
3147093,5,B0015RCUAU,"This workout is really great. It only takes 30 minutes including warm-up and cool-down, but you know you've accomplished something when you're done. There are four different routines, starting with week one. I have to admit, it took me several days or doing week one before I could go on to week two. I haven't gotten any further yet, but know I will. I Enjoy it and it keeps you so busy the time flies. Definitely recommend it!",1360972800,,428,4.5
3147094,5,B0015RCUAU,"This workout DVD is great!! Im 19 yrs old, 6 ft tall and I used to weight 220 pounds. I got this DVD to lose weight and Ive been doing it 7 days a week Ive lost 3 pounds per week and in two weeks ive lost 5 or 6 pounds of fat and ive noticed a major difference in my physical appearence. So this workout is great if you are obese or overweight i would strongly recommend getting this DVD. It has 4 sections which are warm-up, fat burning workout, abs workout and cool down the actual weight loss workout is 30 minutes long and if u really do every exercise that they do and don't cheat yourself you will be sweating bullets and out of breath by the time the 30 minutes are up believe me on that. But if you truly want to lose weight of course you would have to eat right and have the proper diet and do this workout to lose weight. Obviously if you do this workout and then you go to the kitchen and pig out right after its gonna do you no good but like i said I give this DVD 5 stars and I would strongly recommend it for weight loss.",1360368000,,1035,3.909952606635071
3147095,5,B0015RCUAU,This workout kicks my butt lol i definately feel the burn. I feel the burn up until the next day,1356480000,,96,3.85
3147096,5,B0015RCUAU,ok guys me and my wife love this work out we have both lost 20lbs doing this workout and eating right.,1345507200,,102,3.9047619047619047
3147097,5,B0015RCUAU,"I just bought all three swat workouts. I love them. They are motivating and not annoying. I like the countdown on the screen and he tells what is coming next.
I wish there were more of these workouts.",1338249600,,200,4.2894736842105265
3147098,5,B0015RCUAU,"This has been a pretty good workout for me as I am out of shape, if you are in great shape maybe not so much. Commander Tom is nice enough. I am a 51 year old guy recovering from cancer so my energy levels are not great. It is not too hard not too soft, I don't need to prove anything so this works for me. Having read some of the reviews before I bought it, there seems that there was some grumbling about the women in cheesy work out gear? WTF nothing you won't see in a regular gym. I break a sweat every time and have had weight lose, thanks.",1333843200,,546,3.8839285714285716
3147099,3,B0015RCUAU,"This DVD is a good start, the first time I did this workout, I wasn't really out of breath but I did sweat. I didn't like it because I wasn't used to the different workouts, so I stopped using it. Then after I did/attempted different programs, insanity-completed, turbofire-didn't complete, chalean extremem-didn't complete, I lost my motivation after not losing a single pound, like I did with insanity, 23lbs! So I wanted to try this again, well, it wasn't the same because I wanted the lungs expanding experience I felt with insanity. I did it with more power and I wasn't out of breath, and when it was over, I was thinking, that's it? So I'm still looking for dvd's that compare to insanity so I can mix it up and lose fat and tone up, with not using weights for now, I seem to build muscle under the fat, I want to go down in sizes in cloths, not up. But this would be a great moderate workout when you don't feel like going too intense.",1319328000,2,943,4.363636363636363
3147100,3,B0015RCUAU,"This product gets delivered fast, I have only done it about three times. I think it's a good workout, it makes you break a good sweat. But it's the same classic workouts you would do in your P.E. Class in elementary. Don't get me wrong this is a good workout, but it does get a little boring after a while. I don't love the music, and he introduces you to all the girls one by one. lol Its good motivation, because they have great bodies, but I think it's funny when he says these are real woman just like you lol. I had to mute it and use my headphones and I-pod. The six min abs are great, they made me sore. It's a long workout if you do the entire thing, you can always break it up though.",1312761600,,693,3.9928057553956835
3147101,5,B0015RCUAU,This video is a great cardio workout.  You will definitely sweat when doing this workout.  I definitely recommed it.,1278892800,,116,5.052631578947368
3147102,3,B0015RCUAU,"Dvd is Ok. The workout is effective and you really do sweat, but the half-naked chicks standing behind the fully dressed male instructor screams sexism. So what else can you say, if you can tolerate that crap....it will work.",1273536000,3,225,4.794871794871795
3147103,5,B0015RCUAU,This video is exactly the kind of workout video I was looking for. Its definitely a must if you want to tone up.,1272931200,,112,3.9130434782608696
3147104,5,B0015RCUAU,"The video starts off low intensity but quickly gets your heart rate moving...especially if you're just starting to get into shape.  Like anything you need to keep with it.  I also got the other compliment to this video and they are nice to switch up.  The ab section is intense..but with great results. ""Mountain Climbers"" seem basic but are incredible.  They're low impact and unassuming but kick your butt. Overall, I think the video is a great workout.",1272240000,,455,4.794871794871795
3147105,4,B0015RCUAU,"They don't waste any time during the warmup to start burning calories.  Its a 5 minute strengthing warmup, followed by a 35 minute circuit/cardio session, with 6 minute ab option after, and finally a 5 minute cool-down.  The warmup goes through most of the moves that will be used in the cardio session.  The cardio session is 3 sets of various moves that get the heart-rate doing intervals.  In between the cardio sets, there is a 90 second weight training bring down the heart rate( these consist of bicep, tricep,and shoulder moves).  The 6 minute abs session after is very effective (My abs look really good- I am actaully looking forward to bikini season).  Overall, very effective.",1266624000,4,687,4.829059829059829
3147106,2,B0015RCUAU,"If you're used to Cathe, Amy, Kelly and the like, you will find this incredibly boring. The same cycle is repeated four times with the same old exercises. The music is lame and the workout not challenging enough. Then there is a strange and cheesy interlude with football/soccer feet where all the girls circle around the male instructor cheering, eww! Too much marching and talking during which I had to jog and jump to get something out of it. It's missing creativity and fun, but it reminded me a little of Jillian Michaels' workouts, so if you like those, you will probably like this too, just not for me. However, I do like the other two SWAT workouts which are pretty good.",1266537600,2,679,4.573770491803279
3147107,5,B0015RCUAU,"This is one of my very favorite cardio workout DVDs.  I'm not a fan of aerobics because I'm not very coordinated.
This DVD is straight forward and simple: He says what to do and you do it. It's sort of calesthenic type stuff and toning exercises.
If you do the warmup part in the beginning, you get a preview of what's coming up so you can practice a bit.
It is an excellent DVD that will make you sweat.
The first time I played it and saw that one of the exercises they were doing was called the ""SWAT THRUST""--(always known by me as the ""burpee"") I was like, ""No way! I'm not doing any burpees! I hated them in grade school!""), but I did them and they really increase your endurance and bring your heart rate up.  There are a couple of different variations of this exercise they do on the DVD.
One other thing I appreciated about this DVD was that the screen lists what exercise you're doing and what will be up next.  It takes the surprises out of the workout.
I highly recommend this DVD.  It might not be good for someone with back problems-but for most others, it's fun and challenging!",1263859200,2,1092,4.286407766990291
3147108,5,B0015RCUAU,"After eating too much food over the holidays, I convinced my family to do this workout together in our living room. Everyone had a great time! Our little group covered the entire spectrum of ages and fitness levels (ages 30-70 and those who exercise regularly and those who don't). You don't need any equipment, with the exception of one set of medium weights (though the workout would be fine without them). While it is a ""bootcamp"" style workout, it was certainly friendly, upbeat, and fun.

Each exercise was very simple, but effective (we're talking jumping jacks, push-ups, mountain-climbers, lunges, etc.) and everyone could go at their own pace. I work out a lot and I still got really out of breath!

The 6-minute ab workout was FANTASTIC! ANYONE would be challenged (and for those who can't do the crazy variations at the end, just keep doing regular crunches).

Just a note that while the lunches, squats, and push-ups are definitely strength exercises, most of the workout is cardio-focused. They don't do a ton of weight lifting or serious strength training.",1261872000,2,1070,4.933333333333334
3147109,5,B0015RCUAU,"I get bored easily using the same DVD's over and over, so I try to collect as many as I can for more variety and better rotations to my routines. I just received this one a few days ago and tried it tonight as my second DVD after an InSaNiTy plyometric DVD. It was definitely challenging - especially as the second workout in today's rotation. The moves were some classics - but there were a few moves I have not really done with other DVD's - and my collection is pretty wide. The marching in place is fine if you march quickly, but you can also jog, jump rope or do jumping jacks to kick up that intensity. I also did the workout with weighted gloves...so there's always a way to make this more intense. You can use heavier weights during the weighted sections, weighted gloves or a weighted vest. I have a 50lb weighted vest, so plan on using it for this next time.

I like the instructor. He is not annoying at all and gives good instructions. No dancey steps at all and the girls were also fine. Yes, they look awesome - but that motivates me to want to workout harder. I want to look like that too!

I was very pleased with the workout and will be rotating this one in, as it is a keeper for me.",1259452800,3,1201,4.172413793103448
3147110,5,B0015RCUAU,"This is one killer of a workout!! I never new you could sweat so much from a work out video. (Even the instructor and lovely assistance were furiously sweating!) They really aren't messing around! I loved the work out but it was really intense. I thought I had decent upper body strength, but this proved me wrong. I realized I am terrible at push-ups and really need to get back into shape; this video will do it! It is very high impact so if you have soar/weak joints, I would not recommend it. I felt great after the work out but could barely walk 2-3 days later from all the squats, haha.

My favorite part of the video is the ""six-pack abs in six minutes"" bonus feature. I have been doing the abs section religiously and have seen great results!! Best part, it is literally 6 minutes or less once you do the routine on your own (and who really doesn't have 6 minutes).",1255910400,3,873,4.323170731707317
3147111,5,B0015RCUAU,A great advanced workout.  I love the 6 pack Abs in 6 minutes it really does work!  It's not an easy workout but easy doesn't get the job done.  Another must have to your workout collection!  In my opinion The Biggest Loser Boot Camp and SWAT Workout are two great vids to get you into your best shape ever!  Plus who doesn't like Commander Tom he's amazing!,1239062400,,358,4.2835820895522385
3147112,4,B0015RCUAU,"I really enjoy working out with this video. But, I wish there was more muscle strengthening exercises.",1237507200,,102,5.0588235294117645
3147113,5,B0015RCUAU,"If you are looking for an intense full-body workout then I can recommend this to you. There are tons of squats and lunges as well as push ups. Tom Stroup gets your heart rate up and then brings it back down by doing a SWAT march. This is simply walking in place.

A lot of the exercises begin while standing and then take you down to the floor so you are burning a lot of calories from moving up and down constantly for minutes at a time. There is one move called mountain climbing where you are in a plank position and then you ""climb"" or run for a few minutes. Some of the exercises are high impact but Tom Stroup shows you modifications, which I found to be very helpful the first time I tried this workout.

I'd recommend this workout if you are intermediate to advanced. There are plenty of challenges, you will definitely sweat and feel this workout all over your body. This is probably the most difficult workout I've ever tried, yet I was still able to do the extra abdominal workout. There is a short section at the end to help you cool down and believe me you will love stretching after all the intensity.

3147114,2,B0015RCUAU,"With a name like SWAT Workout and Extreme Weight Loss, I was expecting something harder.  Don't get me wrong, it was a decent workout and the instructor is great. I was just expecting something much harder - espcially with all the good reviews.  I'm thankful that I rented this from Netflix before I bought it.  I found that the workout wasn't very intense and there was too much recovery time for me to feel like I did much good. This one is OK but I'll be searching for more high intensity workouts.  I want one that whips my behind and this one wasn't it.",1233878400,3,558,4.336538461538462
3147115,4,B0015RCUAU,"This workout is about 50 minutes long if you do the entire workout. It is a hard workout in parts, but has a lot of marching in between exercises while he is introducing the ladies who are working out with him. That gives you a chance to catch your breath as well. I would recommend this to anyone who is ready for a challenge. The exercises are old school, but really work you hard! I would say this is close to an advanced workout.",1233705600,,433,4.166666666666667
3147116,5,B0015RCUAU,"AWESOME, This video works as good as you want it to, if its to easy go faster, if its to hard go slower, Its easy to say something don't work if your not working, go faster and do more reps you don't have to do 10 just because there doing 10 do 15,20 or whatever it takes to lose weight don't just do 10 and after a week say i give up it don't work and stop, you all can do it give it time its so easy to give up i know thats me Also change your eating habits you CANT just stop eating that don't work Eat 5 or 6 small meals a day Slim Fast shake in the morning apple,cheese stick at 9:00 half sammy no mayo mustard and 1 fruit at 12;00 slim fast bar at 3:00 and a 400 Calorie Dinner and the video 5 days a week get your spouse or a friend it makes you do it and makes it fun. DONT give up its easy to do for me the first month no weight loss almost quit the second month BAM 15Lbs DONT GIVE UP HOW MANY OF US KEEP SAYING MONDAY I'LL START start now we all no how good we feel when someone says have you lost weight. DONT QUIT GOOD LUCK",1229212800,4,1036,3.671171171171171
3147117,5,B0015RCUAU,"First off, I must say Commander Tom is great.  He's very encouraging- nicer than Jillian Michaels.  i agree about the background girls- they look like fitness models more than SWAT people.  But i still enjoy the workout.  I like it a lot because Commander Tom does a lot of drill type moves that are very effective.  I think this is considered circuit training.  It gets my heart rate up and some of the moves are cardio, but others you use weights.  The SWAT pushup is killer but in a good way.  I think this video will get you in great shape quickly.  And Commander Tom makes it fun, so the time goes by quick.",1226793600,,612,4.298245614035087
3147118,2,B0015RCUAU,"Well this DVD isn't horrible, but I probably won't be using it.

My first gripe is the instructor and the background girls. It's a bit cheesy and distracting to see a room full of women in matching short shorts bouncing around. I've never felt this way about any other workout DVD. The girls seemed like they were hired directly from Hooters or something.

My second gripe are the moves. I was in the military for four years, so I guess I am just used to these moves and find them quite boring. Pushups, I mean I've done hundreds upon hundreds of them. This seems like a quick routine I would do in the morning with my unit. I guess that's what some people are looking for, but it's not for me.

Good luck! Oh, and I recommend Self Bikini Ready Fast.",1226534400,5,750,4.304964539007092
3147119,3,B0015RCUAU,"I wish this workout had more to it. You can't choose from different types like most other workout DVDs. But this is a cheaper one. The routines are not bad, and it does give you a good workout for the body and the heart. I just wish he had at least 2 different routines you can choose from (maybe differnt intensity levels or speed) instead of playing the entire DVD. And it's only about 45-50 minutes from warm-up to complete cool-down.",1225065600,,437,4.407407407407407

The only thing I didn't like was the back up people. They were all females in great shape with big fake boobs. Real people I doubt it, fitness models most likely.",1224374400,3,319,4.0
3147121,4,B0015RCUAU,My favorite kind of workout is a bootcamp workout so this was right up my alley!  It's definitely different than any of my other workout DVD's.  Tom is very motivating and the workout flies by.  I do wish it was a longer workout and I also wish that he did some of the moves longer to the point of muscle fatigue.,1224288000,,313,4.098360655737705
3147122,5,B0015RCUAU,I just had a baby and I am confident that following the SWAT Workout will help me get back my pre-baby body.  It is a challenging and energizing workout and Commander Tom knows how to make sweating fun!  The best part about the SWAT Workout DVD is that you can do it anywhere.  I just came back from a trip to Italy and did the SWAT Workout in my hotel room from my computer. No more excuses.......exercising is easy when you have the SWAT Workout on DVD.,1222560000,,455,4.206896551724138
3147123,5,B0015RCUAU,"I'd do this on Sundays when I have more than 1/2 hr to exercise. I do the whole thing which is about 50 minutes long. Commander Tom is likeable. He cues well and he put together a routine that's easy to follow. As other reviewers have said, the moves here are the typical push-ups, mountain climbers, squat thrusts, squat thrusts/plank jack/push-up combo, lunges, football sprints, jumping jacks, boxers, lateral leaps, etc. I was drinking water in between [few seconds taken away from the marching in place part]. For the short weights section, I personally prefer 3-5 lbs. 'coz I don't want to bulk up. The abs section is short but very challenging. I was breathing hard and sweating a lot when I finished and that felt great [meaning, I truly accomplished something...] This is my circuit training DVD to alternate with Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred. On alternate cardio days, I do Abs Diet 2 Speed Intervals, Turbo Jam Fat Blaster and Urban Rebounding....Aside from Urban Rebounding rountines, I do all the hi-impact moves on my rebounder/mini-trampoline. I'd like my knees to last.....This is my current workout rotation and will change in 4-6 weeks. I have been exercising consistently for about 7 years now [6 days /week-Sunday to Friday] so I consider myself high-intermediate level.

Buy this DVD, use it regularly and you'll be surprised how fit you're going to be....",1221696000,7,1379,4.96969696969697

For an intense training day, I combine both workouts for a serious cardio and toning regiment, and I can honestly say that (even though it's challenging) I WANT to do it! There are few workouts out there that I look forward to doing! Commander Tom is so great! His direction is clear and motivating, and he knows exactly how to train you so that you stay focused and strong, and really utilize all areas for a whole-body experience. My endurance, body tone, and stamina have increased tremendously since I've done the workouts. I use lighter weights (5-8 lbs) since there are lots of repetitions, but the idea is to keep the body moving, steadily raising and lowering the heart-rate, keeping the blood pumping so your heart and lungs are working at the optimal levels. Commander Tom says that in doing these workouts he wants us to feel that we're in the best shape of our lives, and I can truly say I'm getting there!

I bought this DVD because I had heard it was a little harder, and it is. I really feel the burn throughout the whole DVD. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge. You can modify the moves if they are too hard or when you first start and work your way up. I burn about 650 calories in 45 minutes on this DVD (according to my heart rate monitor). It's definately one of my favorites!",1220140800,,569,3.9565217391304346
3147128,5,B0015RCUAU,"Looking at some of the other reviews, I can understand their disappointment, because Commander Tom' workout isn't for the advanced exerciser. I've been working out since the early 1980's, but had to stop because of a serious illness that has left me fat and fatigued. I started out with a walking workout to rebuild my strength and stamina so I could weight train again.

I have Amy Dixon, Cathe, and Rob Glick's HIIT dvds but they were a little too advanced for me to use right now.

Commander Tom's dvd fits my needs at this time because of the simplicity of the movements for my strength level. I still have to pace myself (I also have asthma) and wind up breathing pretty hard sometimes. But I like him and this helps when working out hard. I also have worked in corrections, so I'm a patsy for law enforcement/criminal justice type  exercise dvds.

My only beefs are his counting is stinky (so I do the counting, coach) and there are no additional men in the dvd (hmmmm?).

I will be trying out his weightloss video soon since I am starting to outperform the walking dvd (I own some early Sansone dvds). Hope this helps in choosing an exercise dvd.",1219276800,3,1153,4.524038461538462

Easy to follow but a great burn and perfect for any level...if you are advanced, your heart rate will be up the whole time burning mega calories, if you are not, he still walks you through how to lower your heart rate and adjust the workout so you are comfortable until you are able to do it at the pace you desire.

I search for videos that encompass the best of the latest scientific studies within losing weight: combining strength training (building muscle so that you burn calories while at rest) with great cardio (burning fat during the workout and afterwards as your heart rate remains strong and increasing heart health)

This video has it all...and it's great for men and women..the very hot gals are an inspiration that a girl can do it (and fun for guys to watch I'm sure!) and this real SWAT team trainer is in great shape and they don't have cut-in shots where you know they stopped the camera and took a break. This team sweats hard and appears to have filmed the whole workout pefectly ALL the way through. ANd they are ALWAYS perfectly in sync. They clearly worked hard to make this a video of perfection...impressive.

just one of my top workouts...and I have lots...I even have my own home gym so we're picky!",1215561600,2,1586,4.557894736842106

3147135,5,B0015RCUAU,"I take Commander Tom's live S.W.A.T. class in Orlando and the video is just as intense!  It provides a great mix of interval training which I find the most effective way to burn calories and melt fat.  Just when you think you can't take one more push up or mountain climber, the countdown begins 3-2-1 and you know you can hang in there for a few more.  The video pushes your body and works every major muscle group.  Although the first segment is a little easy for people who workout all the time, you can always amp it up by jogging in place rather than marching or do the exercises at double speed.  The bonus 6-minute ab workout is a killer as well, and I definitely felt it afterwards.  I workout 5-6 times a week and will no doubt incorporate this video into my weekly routine.

As a side note, if you enjoy workouts by Jillian Michaels or the Biggest Loser series, this video is very similar in its circuit training style.",1213747200,3,929,4.366279069767442

The workout will get your heart and lungs pumping, get your resting heart-rate down and do the best things for you to be in the best shape of your life.  It is a secret to staying young...",1212364800,2,394,4.24
3147137,5,B0015RCUAU,"A good lower impact cardio workout for the home exerciser.  It is a relatively short workout (the actual cardio portion is about 30 minutes long) that combines straightforward ""boot camp"" moves such as ""SWAT Thrusts"" which involve moving from a standing position to a plank, scissoring the legs, performing a pushup and then standing up straight; military or SWAT marches, and lunges.  I have serious nerve damage in my feet after punishing my body with long distance running, so I need a workout that is effective, but does not involve lots of bouncing or repetitive lateral moves.  I would caution, however, that for those with knee problems that the SWAT thrusts will place pressure on your knees, especially when you jump up from a plank position.  Modify the move by stepping forward one leg at a time or slowing the move down.

The workout has a fun element to it in the digital display at the bottom of the screen.  It features a count for how many repetitions remain, what you are doing now and what is coming up and a reminder to check your heart rate.

The set is interesting and looks a bit like the scene of a SWAT raid or something complete with Hummer vehicles and barriers.  The SWAT team consists entirely of young, fit, attractive women in short bike shorts and halter tops and the team leader, Commander Tom, engages in fun banter with them during the workout.

Commander Tom is a fun and engaging leader.  If you like the playful intensity of Billy Blanks or the friendliness of Rod Stryker's yoga videos, his style will be a good match for you.

Minimal equipment is required.  Light dumbbells (5 lbs to start - increase with fitness level) are used in the recovery section.  You can increase the intensity of the workout if you like by speeding up the marches or increasing your weights, but to be honest, if you are maintaining strict form the straight workout should be plenty.

Some criticisms - the workout cueing is problematic.  The instructor cues to his orientation, not the viewers, so when he says go to your left if you want to mirror him you will have to go to your right.  However, the coreography is so simple that this should not pose a serious problem.  Also, Commander Tom does tend to lose count, so if you are a stickler for repititions, you should keep your own count.  Since none of these issues pose a serious threat to the workout's effectiveness, I did not cut stars but you should watch for them.

This is a light HIIT.  If you want a very intense HIIT and you have a step, try Intense Moves by Gin Miller and Step Reebok or Get Ripped 1000 (featured in the 4 pack)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jari-Love-Get-Ripped-4-Pack-Includes-Get-Ripped-Ripped-to-the-Core-Ripped-1000-Slim-Lean/dp/B000ZDQIA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jari Love: Get Ripped 4-Pack, Includes Get Ripped, Ripped to the Core, Ripped 1000, Slim & Lean</a>&nbsp;which has intense cardio on a step with weights in the recovery section.

Lastly - I am a mom and my daughter loves this workout.  She loves to do the SWAT thrusts and the SWAT marches with me.  Did I mention that she is 2 1/2?  Fun for the whole family!",1212019200,,3176,4.882462686567164
3147138,3,B0015RCUAU,"I purchased this workout since the description made it sound like it would be a high-intensity, interval training (HIIT) workout, and I've been looking for more HIIT DVD workouts to add to my collection since they are hard to find. (I have the Abs Diet and the Women's Body Type workouts, which are very good HIIT workouts.)

Most of this workout does qualify as an interval workout, where you alternate intense sections of cardio for a minute or so, before recovering by marching in place.  However, some of the intervals have you using light weights (to do biceps curls, triceps presses, etc.) and doing things like push-ups, which also makes it fall into the category of a circuit workout. I mention this only because it will make it hard to fit into a training program; the weight lifting wasn't hard enough to qualify as a true weight-lifting session, and yet I don't want to lift weights without 48 hours of rest in between my weight sessions.

The workout is fun and moves at a good pace, but the first part of it didn't get my heart rate up very high. To increase the intensity, I ended up modifying the marching in place to light jogging in place.  The workout also includes a tough, six-minute ab section, which I really enjoyed.  However, what I didn't like was that the cardio section just concluded, without any stretching or proper cool down, before moving into the abs.  After doing abs, there is some stretching, but it would have been much better to have included some brief stretching and a cool down *before* doing the abs to give the heart some time to recover.

The last thing I wanted to mention is that the background exercisers are all thin women who are clad in short shorts and tank tops.  Several times, Commander Tom mentions that they are all ""real people,"" and yet I would have liked to have seen some men and more people who look like they are just getting started with the workout program.

All in all, it's a good workout, but I don't think I'll be reaching for it  that often.  Although he had good positive energy, the instructor just doesn't motivate me like other instructors do.  Overall, I'd actually give this 3 1/2 stars.",1211587200,67,2162,4.6015625

These workouts will get you in, get you out and done! These workouts look ""easy"" if you just view them, but once you try them you will feel it.

I first learned about the S.W.A.T. workouts on a fitness board and was intrigued by the description. When I received my S.W.A.T. workouts I put them in the DVD and fell in love! Let Commander Tom come into your home and you won't regret it.

My favorite workout is the Weight Loss one. I didn't like burpees (aka squat thrusts) and avoided them for years, but after doing them in the Weight Loss workout, I began liking them! I also love the Abs and Core workout! Another to the point workout. All the workouts are great!

Commander Tom cares about you and your success! You do not need a lot of equipment, just your dumbbells, toning bands, DVD Player, water, towel and S.W.A.T.!

3147145,5,B0015RCUAU,"The SWAT Workout is led by Tom Stroup, an actual SWAT commander.  He has a great personality and a good rapport with the background exercisers.  This is an interval workout.  It consists of running in place, jumping jacks, ""SWAT"" thrusts, mountain climbers, boxers and other drils with the SWAT march between each drill to allow your heart rate to come down. It's a good workout for burning fat, increasing endurance and agility.  I love drill type workouts, but even if it's not your thing, Tom's personality makes it fun.  The SWAT workout isn't such a killer workout that it has a huge dread factor, but it isn't a walk in the park either.  It can be modified for a beginner, but an experienced exerciser can get a good workout too.

  EXTREME WEIGHT LOSS AND FAT BURNING  (body weight  only)
Chapter one- warm up- 9:30 MINUTES
Chapter two- SWAT fat burning workout - 30 MINUTES
Chapter three- BONUS-6 pack ABS in 6 minutes

Eat the proper diet and SWAT and you can lose weight at a rapid clip.

This DVD is straight forward and simple: He says what to do and you do it. It's sort of calesthenic type stuff and toning exercises.
If you do the warmup part in the beginning, you get a preview of what's coming up so you can practice a bit.
It is an excellent DVD that will make you sweat.
The first time I played it and saw that one of the exercises they were doing was called the ""SWAT THRUST""--(always known by me as the ""burpee"") I was like, ""No way! I'm not doing any burpees! I hated them in grade school!""), but I did them and they really increase your endurance and bring your heart rate up.  There are a couple of different variations of this exercise they do on the DVD.
One other thing I appreciated about this DVD was that the screen lists what exercise you're doing and what will be up next.  It takes the surprises out of the workout.

You don't need any equipment, with the exception of one set of medium weights (though the workout would be fine without them).

Each exercise was very simple, but effective (we're talking jumping jacks, push-ups, mountain-climbers, lunges, etc.) and everyone could go at their own pace. I work out a lot and I still got really out of breath!

The 6-minute ab workout was FANTASTIC! ANYONE would be challenged (and for those who can't do the crazy variations at the end, just keep doing regular crunches).

Just a note that while the lunches, squats, and push-ups are definitely strength exercises, most of the workout is cardio-focused. They don't do a ton of weight lifting or serious strength training.",1261872000,2,1070,4.933333333333334
3381606,5,B0015RCUAU,"I get bored easily using the same DVD's over and over, so I try to collect as many as I can for more variety and better rotations to my routines. I just received this one a few days ago and tried it tonight as my second DVD after an InSaNiTy plyometric DVD. It was definitely challenging - especially as the second workout in today's rotation. The moves were some classics - but there were a few moves I have not really done with other DVD's - and my collection is pretty wide. The marching in place is fine if you march quickly, but you can also jog, jump rope or do jumping jacks to kick up that intensity. I also did the workout with weighted gloves...so there's always a way to make this more intense. You can use heavier weights during the weighted sections, weighted gloves or a weighted vest. I have a 50lb weighted vest, so plan on using it for this next time.

I like the instructor. He is not annoying at all and gives good instructions. No dancey steps at all and the girls were also fine. Yes, they look awesome - but that motivates me to want to workout harder. I want to look like that too!

I was very pleased with the workout and will be rotating this one in, as it is a keeper for me.",1259452800,3,1201,4.172413793103448

They really aren't messing around! I loved the work out but it was really intense. I thought I had decent upper body strength, but this proved me wrong. I realized I am terrible at push-ups and really need to get back into shape; this video will do it! It is very high impact so if you have soar/weak joints, I would not recommend it. I felt great after the work out but could barely walk 2-3 days later from all the squats, haha.

My favorite part of the video is the ""six-pack abs in six minutes"" bonus feature. I have been doing the abs section religiously and have seen great results!! Best part, it is literally 6 minutes or less once you do the routine on your own (and who really doesn't have 6 minutes).",1255910400,3,873,4.323170731707317

3381610,5,B0015RCUAU,"If you are looking for an intense full-body workout then I can recommend this to you. There are tons of squats and lunges as well as push ups. Tom Stroup gets your heart rate up and then brings it back down by doing a SWAT march. This is simply walking in place.

A lot of the exercises begin while standing and then take you down to the floor so you are burning a lot of calories from moving up and down constantly for minutes at a time. There is one move called mountain climbing where you are in a plank position and then you ""climb"" or run for a few minutes. Some of the exercises are high impact but Tom Stroup shows you modifications, which I found to be very helpful the first time I tried this workout.

I'd recommend this workout if you are intermediate to advanced. There are plenty of challenges, you will definitely sweat and feel this workout all over your body. This is probably the most difficult workout I've ever tried, yet I was still able to do the extra abdominal workout. There is a short section at the end to help you cool down and believe me you will love stretching after all the intensity.

He's very encouraging- nicer than Jillian Michaels.  i agree about the background girls- they look like fitness models more than SWAT people.  But i still enjoy the workout.  I like it a lot because Commander Tom does a lot of drill type moves that are very effective.  I think this is considered circuit training.  It gets my heart rate up and some of the moves are cardio, but others you use weights.  The SWAT pushup is killer but in a good way.  I think this video will get you in great shape quickly.

My first gripe is the instructor and the background girls. It's a bit cheesy and distracting to see a room full of women in matching short shorts bouncing around. I've never felt this way about any other workout DVD. The girls seemed like they were hired directly from Hooters or something.

My second gripe are the moves. I was in the military for four years, so I guess I am just used to these moves and find them quite boring. Pushups, I mean I've done hundreds upon hundreds of them. This seems like a quick routine I would do in the morning with my unit. I guess that's what some people are looking for, but it's not for me.

He cues well and he put together a routine that's easy to follow. As other reviewers have said, the moves here are the typical push-ups, mountain climbers, squat thrusts, squat thrusts/plank jack/push-up combo, lunges, football sprints, jumping jacks, boxers, lateral leaps, etc. I was drinking water in between [few seconds taken away from the marching in place part]. For the short weights section, I personally prefer 3-5 lbs. 'coz I don't want to bulk up. The abs section is short but very challenging. I was breathing hard and sweating a lot when I finished and that felt great [meaning, I truly accomplished something...] This is my circuit training DVD to alternate with Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred. On alternate cardio days, I do Abs Diet 2 Speed Intervals, Turbo Jam Fat Blaster and Urban Rebounding....Aside from Urban Rebounding rountines, I do all the hi-impact moves on my rebounder/mini-trampoline. I'd like my knees to last.....This is my current workout rotation and will change in 4-6 weeks.

His direction is clear and motivating, and he knows exactly how to train you so that you stay focused and strong, and really utilize all areas for a whole-body experience. My endurance, body tone, and stamina have increased tremendously since I've done the workouts. I use lighter weights (5-8 lbs) since there are lots of repetitions, but the idea is to keep the body moving, steadily raising and lowering the heart-rate, keeping the blood pumping so your heart and lungs are working at the optimal levels.

3381625,5,B0015RCUAU,"Looking at some of the other reviews, I can understand their disappointment, because Commander Tom' workout isn't for the advanced exerciser. I've been working out since the early 1980's, but had to stop because of a serious illness that has left me fat and fatigued. I started out with a walking workout to rebuild my strength and stamina so I could weight train again.

I have Amy Dixon, Cathe, and Rob Glick's HIIT dvds but they were a little too advanced for me to use right now.

Commander Tom's dvd fits my needs at this time because of the simplicity of the movements for my strength level. I still have to pace myself (I also have asthma) and wind up breathing pretty hard sometimes. But I like him and this helps when working out hard. I also have worked in corrections, so I'm a patsy for law enforcement/criminal justice type  exercise dvds.

My only beefs are his counting is stinky (so I do the counting, coach) and there are no additional men in the dvd (hmmmm?).

I will be trying out his weightloss video soon since I am starting to outperform the walking dvd (I own some early Sansone dvds). Hope this helps in choosing an exercise dvd.",1219276800,3,1153,4.524038461538462

The trainer is very uplifting and inspiring, the set is a work of art on its own...but, the main part...GREAT workout!! Easy to follow but a great burn and perfect for any level...if you are advanced, your heart rate will be up the whole time burning mega calories, if you are not, he still walks you through how to lower your heart rate and adjust the workout so you are comfortable until you are able to do it at the pace you desire.

I search for videos that encompass the best of the latest scientific studies within losing weight: combining strength training (building muscle so that you burn calories while at rest) with great cardio (burning fat during the workout and afterwards as your heart rate remains strong and increasing heart health)

This video has it all...and it's great for men and women..the very hot gals are an inspiration that a girl can do it (and fun for guys to watch I'm sure!) and this real SWAT team trainer is in great shape and they don't have cut-in shots where you know they stopped the camera and took a break.

The video pushes your body and works every major muscle group.  Although the first segment is a little easy for people who workout all the time, you can always amp it up by jogging in place rather than marching or do the exercises at double speed.  The bonus 6-minute ab workout is a killer as well, and I definitely felt it afterwards.  I workout 5-6 times a week and will no doubt incorporate this video into my weekly routine.

3381634,5,B0015RCUAU,"A good lower impact cardio workout for the home exerciser.  It is a relatively short workout (the actual cardio portion is about 30 minutes long) that combines straightforward ""boot camp"" moves such as ""SWAT Thrusts"" which involve moving from a standing position to a plank, scissoring the legs, performing a pushup and then standing up straight; military or SWAT marches, and lunges.  I have serious nerve damage in my feet after punishing my body with long distance running, so I need a workout that is effective, but does not involve lots of bouncing or repetitive lateral moves.  I would caution, however, that for those with knee problems that the SWAT thrusts will place pressure on your knees, especially when you jump up from a plank position.  Modify the move by stepping forward one leg at a time or slowing the move down.

The workout has a fun element to it in the digital display at the bottom of the screen.  It features a count for how many repetitions remain, what you are doing now and what is coming up and a reminder to check your heart rate.

The set is interesting and looks a bit like the scene of a SWAT raid or something complete with Hummer vehicles and barriers.  The SWAT team consists entirely of young, fit, attractive women in short bike shorts and halter tops and the team leader, Commander Tom, engages in fun banter with them during the workout.

Commander Tom is a fun and engaging leader.  If you like the playful intensity of Billy Blanks or the friendliness of Rod Stryker's yoga videos, his style will be a good match for you.

Minimal equipment is required.  Light dumbbells (5 lbs to start - increase with fitness level) are used in the recovery section.  You can increase the intensity of the workout if you like by speeding up the marches or increasing your weights, but to be honest, if you are maintaining strict form the straight workout should be plenty.

Some criticisms - the workout cueing is problematic.  The instructor cues to his orientation, not the viewers, so when he says go to your left if you want to mirror him you will have to go to your right.  However, the coreography is so simple that this should not pose a serious problem.  Also, Commander Tom does tend to lose count, so if you are a stickler for repititions, you should keep your own count.  Since none of these issues pose a serious threat to the workout's effectiveness, I did not cut stars but you should watch for them.

This is a light HIIT.  If you want a very intense HIIT and you have a step, try Intense Moves by Gin Miller and Step Reebok or Get Ripped 1000 (featured in the 4 pack)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jari-Love-Get-Ripped-4-Pack-Includes-Get-Ripped-Ripped-to-the-Core-Ripped-1000-Slim-Lean/dp/B000ZDQIA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jari Love: Get Ripped 4-Pack, Includes Get Ripped, Ripped to the Core, Ripped 1000, Slim & Lean</a>&nbsp;which has intense cardio on a step with weights in the recovery section.

Lastly - I am a mom and my daughter loves this workout.  She loves to do the SWAT thrusts and the SWAT marches with me.  Did I mention that she is 2 1/2?  Fun for the whole family!",1212019200,,3176,4.882462686567164
3381635,3,B0015RCUAU,"I purchased this workout since the description made it sound like it would be a high-intensity, interval training (HIIT) workout, and I've been looking for more HIIT DVD workouts to add to my collection since they are hard to find. (I have the Abs Diet and the Women's Body Type workouts, which are very good HIIT workouts.)

Most of this workout does qualify as an interval workout, where you alternate intense sections of cardio for a minute or so, before recovering by marching in place.  However, some of the intervals have you using light weights (to do biceps curls, triceps presses, etc.) and doing things like push-ups, which also makes it fall into the category of a circuit workout. I mention this only because it will make it hard to fit into a training program; the weight lifting wasn't hard enough to qualify as a true weight-lifting session, and yet I don't want to lift weights without 48 hours of rest in between my weight sessions.

The workout is fun and moves at a good pace, but the first part of it didn't get my heart rate up very high. To increase the intensity, I ended up modifying the marching in place to light jogging in place.  The workout also includes a tough, six-minute ab section, which I really enjoyed.  However, what I didn't like was that the cardio section just concluded, without any stretching or proper cool down, before moving into the abs.  After doing abs, there is some stretching, but it would have been much better to have included some brief stretching and a cool down *before* doing the abs to give the heart some time to recover.

The last thing I wanted to mention is that the background exercisers are all thin women who are clad in short shorts and tank tops.  Several times, Commander Tom mentions that they are all ""real people,"" and yet I would have liked to have seen some men and more people who look like they are just getting started with the workout program.

All in all, it's a good workout, but I don't think I'll be reaching for it  that often.  Although he had good positive energy, the instructor just doesn't motivate me like other instructors do.  Overall, I'd actually give this 3 1/2 stars.",1211587200,67,2162,4.6015625

His corny jokes and encouragement really help you get away from just working out and help you focus on why you are doing the exercises you are doing. You do SWAT workout to have a better all around life outside the gym and that is what happens. In just a few weeks, you will begin to feel results and have a workout plan for a long time. Thanks to Commander Tom!",1208390400,6,515,4.108910891089109
3381641,5,B0015RCUAU,"I've taken Tom's classes in Orlando, FL and I can say that it's been one of the best workout experiences in my life. Tom is very professional, nice, enthusiastic, and effective ""commander"" at the gym. His classes are animated, fun, and full of energy. I now live out of FL and still do the SWAT Workout three times per week by myself thanks to what I learned from Tom. I highly recommend this workout to anybody who is serious about getting in physical and mental shape.",1208390400,5,470,4.476744186046512
3381642,5,B0015RCUAU,"The SWAT Workout is led by Tom Stroup, an actual SWAT commander.  He has a great personality and a good rapport with the background exercisers.  This is an interval workout.  It consists of running in place, jumping jacks, ""SWAT"" thrusts, mountain climbers, boxers and other drils with the SWAT march between each drill to allow your heart rate to come down. It's a good workout for burning fat, increasing endurance and agility.  I love drill type workouts, but even if it's not your thing, Tom's personality makes it fun.  The SWAT workout isn't such a killer workout that it has a huge dread factor, but it isn't a walk in the park either.  It can be modified for a beginner, but an experienced exerciser can get a good workout too.

Here is breakdown of the chapters:

  EXTREME WEIGHT LOSS AND FAT BURNING  (body weight  only)
Chapter one- warm up- 9:30 MINUTES
Chapter two- SWAT fat burning workout - 30 MINUTES
Chapter three- BONUS-6 pack ABS in 6 minutes
Chapter four- cool down - 8:49 MINUTES

If you're short on time, the 30 minute fat burning makes a great stand alone workout.  All  you really need to add is a quick stretch at the end.",1208390400,63,1148,4.5588235294117645
3381643,5,B0015RCUAU,"The older you get the harder it is to stay in shape. I am 64 now and have worked out in some way most of my life. I tried SWAT and do have to modify my workout somewhat, but Tom is an inspiration to all who see him. He not a teenager but he sure looks great. His workouts have increased my flexability and my energy and strength. I'd like to live to be 140 if I can feel this good. I definately recommend SWAT to anyone, and remember even if you are my age you can do a modified workout.

3381644,5,B0015RCUAU,"I've attended Tom's class at the local YMCA for about three years. Always look forward to it. Tom has distilled his fantastic program into simple routines that can be as easy or difficult as you desire. No expensive equipment or memberships to buy. Just commit your body to an hour of exhilaration!  The SWAT routines augment performance in all other activities. Eating too much? SWAT will melt the fat away. Eat the proper diet and SWAT and you can lose weight at a rapid clip.
I'm 53 years old. Closing in on my college weight--less than 10 lbs. to go. Stronger & healthier than ever. SWAT has been key to that success.
With the DVD you can take Tom & the class anywhere, anytime.

And best of all people who travel a lot can take SWAT and do it in hotel rooms or anywhere you go when you travel.  Its a great workout for people on the go.  SWAT works every muscle in your body.  Its just awesome!!! And Commander Tom is the absolute best instructor ever!!!!!! Thanks Commander Tom you're such an inspiration!!",1208390400,7,495,4.279569892473118

Commander Tom is the best instructor.  He makes it fun.  Buy this DVD to TODAY!!!!!  C.Kelly,1208390400,5,244,4.266666666666667
3381647,5,B0015RCUAU,I have taken Tom's fitness class and he is the REAL DEAL!  What you see and do in the DVD is exactly how Tom conducts his class and life!  I love the DVD's and cannot wait for the next in the series.,1208390400,5,199,3.7142857142857144

I don't want to grow old gracefully and having a SWAT Commander as my trainer will definitely keep me motivated!  Thanks, Tom!",1208304000,3,301,4.339285714285714

8259574,5,B0015RCUAU,"Love this.  I use it everyday for my workout and when I accidentally lost this DVD I had to rush out
and get another one because I couldn't find any that were as good as this.  Highly recommend!!!",1480464000,,196,4.131578947368421

8259576,4,B0015RCUAU,"Love it , it's a great workout. Makes me sweat big time , definitely would recommend.  But it is hard and has a lot of moving exercises so just be aware of that.",1410307200,,161,3.878787878787879
8259577,5,B0015RCUAU,"I really enjoy this DVD. The first time I played it, I got through the whole workout (well, not every single ab rep in the 6 min. ab burner - but close!). The full workout is approx. 53 minutes in total. There is a 9 min. warm up, where you are doing most of the exercises you will do during the real workout, just about 30 minutes of the SWAT workout (a 3 set series), a 6 min. Ab-burner (and it is challenging) and then the cool down which is about 7-8 mins.
You chose the workout you want or you can do each piece separately. It is entertaining and a good workout. I am definitely sweating through it. It is slightly different from other ""normal"" workouts due to the background and the SWAT Team. I feel very motivated while sweating my fat away...I will continue to use DVD and hopefully persuade my husband to do the same! Glad I bought it!",1409702400,,845,4.222222222222222

8259579,3,B0015RCUAU,Cute girls in cute outfits.  Training was decent and a little different than the regular fatloss workouts.  The trainer is at least less obnoxious than a lot of these dvds.,1388620800,,172,4.7
8259580,5,B0015RCUAU,"a good entry level video. you can go all out or take it a little easier. and the ab work at the end is great. not as intense as p90x, but it isn't intended to be. and you can do the whole thing in 45 at home. noone cares about the lights or multiple girls.....buy the video for the workout and follow what he does. its a good workout",1383782400,,333,3.8405797101449277
8259581,3,B0015RCUAU,This video is OK to do for the first 2 weeks or so. After that your body will get used to it and you will plateau with weight loss. It also gets boring and repetitive if you do it everyday.,1383004800,,189,3.75
8259582,4,B0015RCUAU,"Well, I was a little skeptical when I ordered this video because I have yet to find a workout video I like except for the one that I have been using for years (The Firm, Maximum Calorie Burn), but I thought, ""Hey, the price is right, let's give it a shot."" So, for those of you who are sick of the hard to grasp dancy moves, this is the video for you. Though it is a cardio workout, he basically using drills (kind of like what you would find in sports workouts) to get your heart-rate up. Also, he is very nice and personable. I loved how he was encouraging throughout the entire workout, and he was actually always on cue! So, you really don't need to review this workout before trying it, because the moves are easy to pick up and he tells you what you're going to do. Someone said that they didn't think the girls in this video were real, regular people because they were all in shape, but not to be mean, I don't want to workout to a bunch of flabby out of shape people...I don't trust workouts were out of shape people can easily do them, which is why I won't buy The Biggest Loser workouts. And for those of us who love workingout at home but are in shape, why would I want to workout to out of shape people? Again, I am not trying to be mean, this is just my preferance.",1375056000,,1278,4.116
