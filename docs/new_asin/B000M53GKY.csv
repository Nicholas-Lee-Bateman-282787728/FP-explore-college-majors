8166306,5,B000M53GKY,I'm a big fan of Pete Spratt from his UFC days. Didn't know he made a movie. Lol! I loved it. I like how they used the Asian people against blacks. It was entertaining. Took hood movies to another level. Bravo Pete!,1513123200,,215,4.142857142857143

8166308,1,B000M53GKY,"""Romeo Must Die"" shows Blacks and Asians killing each other, but the touching dynamic between Aaliyah and Jet Li tempered that.  ""Dead Presidents"" showed many whites and Blacks killing Asians, but all were soldiers who played no role in starting or continuing that war.  Here, Blacks and Asians kill each other, but you are not watching equals.  The film is set up to see the Blacks' view and not really the Asians.  This film comes off as very anti-Asian and I found it creepy.  Don't get me wrong: SOME Asians have plenty of anti-Black racist stuff out there (see the book ""Global Divas,"" for example).  But I'm Black and this still came off as quite shameful to me.

I guess some people like seeing characters who have no idea they will die one second later.  However, I didn't sympathize with the assassin shown here.  Every Black man was hyperaggressive and spoke lines that suggest they would explode if someone so much as wished them good morning.  The martial arts scenes were substandard and pitiable.  This film celebrates disunity among peoples of color and I found it nasty.  Why someone needed to make a poor-quality imitation of ""Rush Hour"" that refutes all the positive goals of that film series is beyond me.

Let's make love, not war!  Where are the lovers, not the fighters?  Go see the blaxploitation film ""The Dynamite Brothers.""  Brandy played a Black Cinderella and her prince was Pinoy.  There's the series ""Afro InvASIAN"" and ""Oriental Chicks on Chocolate Bleeps.""  In ""Affirmative Blacktion,"" Branden Lee gets busy with Matthew Rush.  Let's celebrate black-and-yellow bumblebee love over the divisive fighting, y'all!",1304035200,,1642,4.970588235294118
