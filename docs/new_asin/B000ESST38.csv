3919489,4,B000ESST38,"I was surprised how crisp and colorful some of this movie looked. But as people have mentioned, no extras, no Japanese with english subtitles, and no Japanese version. But I new all this going in, so no surprises here. Just mentioning it so nobody expects anything really great. This is the version I saw as a kid, so I don't mind it. The Japanese version is much better, just like most of these movies. But I do realize some people don't like reading subtitles. To me, it was well worth it till something better comes along. To answer the title question, I think the Blu-ray is much better.",1396656000,7,591,4.481481481481482
3919490,2,B000ESST38,"with HD streaming and digital purchases nowadays,  most people come to expect more when they go out of their way to buy blu-rays. the film was clear and sound was decent, but there are no special features. More disappointing, there is no option to watch in the original Japanese audio track.",1396569600,4,291,4.705882352941177
3919491,3,B000ESST38,"The image quality on this blu ray disc is amazing. Like, wow, really!
The problem is that this disc includes only the American disaster of an edit. The incredible soundtrack had been replaced with Creature from the Black Lagoon music which, though it works well, is totally distracting. And like i said, the original soundtrack was great to begin with.
The American edit is choppy, and gets worse near the middle to end.
However, if you grew up with this version of the movie, and don't mind missing out on the far superior original edit and language tracks, then you should love it.",1396483200,4,583,4.669902912621359
3919492,3,B000ESST38,"I'll skip the movie review because one can only assume if you're buying this you know what you're getting.  The important thing here is the quality of the blu-ray.  That quality can be best described as ""meh.""  The picture and colors are vibrant and beautiful. Having owned several copies of this film throughout the years I can say for sure that this is the best release I have ever seen.  There is however the matter of how crappy the blu-ray itself is.  No inserts (expected), no special features (expected), English dub only, (expected), NO FREAKING TITLE MENU (WHAT THE HELL). The movie just starts and if you want to navigate or need to turn on the subtitles etc. your only option is to use the pop-up menu.  Is it that big of a deal to not have a real menu? No, probably not to most, but it does make the already lackluster release feel even cheaper. So I'm giving this 3 out of 5 stars and all those stars are on the film itself and how great it looks and sounds. The inclusion of at least a trailer would have made the whole thing a lot better.  Even if you had to use the pop-up menu to get to it.",1396483200,4,1107,4.242857142857143

3919494,5,B000ESST38,Saw this as a kid in the 1960's and thought it was terrible since I loved the original which is a classic.  However as I got older and watched it again it became one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  It's so bad that it's good.,1396137600,5,233,3.9361702127659575
3919495,3,B000ESST38,"While King Kong vs Godzilla is a classic movie it's disappointing that Universal doesn't include the Japanese version of this film which is totally different.  The American version is filled, like the original Godzilla movie, with newscaster inserts that fill the gaps for the removed Japanese scenes.  The price is right, you won't be disappointed but why we're not treated to the full original movie along with the American hatchet job just seems disappointing in todays movie market especially since blu ray is more then able to accommodate both and more!!",1393200000,5,559,5.131868131868132
3919496,1,B000ESST38,"Well, the real missed oportunity is not to have the Japanese version, I do agree on that with some other comments. I will not bother to buy a blu-ray with nothing but the English version. Not only because of the language, but also because the movies are very different from each other. Not to mention that the original Japanese version was released in sterophonic sound, which, according to the info provided by Amazon, has not been recovered.",1391990400,7,443,4.766233766233766

3919500,2,B000ESST38,"This review is for the BluRay and not the movie itself which I love, having been a Godzilla fan my entire life.
The Bluray itself has ok video quality (the video is in some ways better than the DVD version, but also worse because they turned the brightness waaaaay down.) but it is only in dubbed english, now usually I wouldn't mind so much since the dubs of most of the movies don't change the actual movie. But THIS dub is the kind that reorders certain scenes, removes others, adds in extra scenes that weren't in the Japanese version (Mostly boring sequences with some guys talking about King Kong and Godzilla, insulting Godzilla and saying he has a brain the size of a berry compared to Kong and isn't a ""thinking animal"" despite the fact that Godzilla shows quite a bit of intelligence, in particular laughing his behind off at Kong when he first fights him.) and the dub removes Akira Ifukube's incredible score (besides the native's singing and drumming.) and adds in ill fitting music from Creature from the Black Lagoon.
I cannot recommend this release unless you really REALLY want to see the movie, hopefully they will someday release the movie properly with a proper dub, and the original Japanese version included.",1502582400,,1230,4.752336448598131

Probably if not the best, the second best Godzilla movie ever made. This movie has a slight mix of humor, but not where it is so often it gets annoying. If I knew how great of of a movie it was before buying it, I would buy it for $30 if I had to.

3919520,4,B000ESST38,"BOTTOM LINE: While KING KONG vs. GODZILLA isn't exactly Shakespeare, Shakespeare certainly isn't KING KONG vs. GODZILLA. This film, (the third entry in the long-running series), still holds the record for most tickets ever sold for a Godzilla film. It's silly, it's kitschy, but most of all... it's FUN! Though a tad talky in the first half, the climactic showdown between monsterdom's two biggest stars during the last few reels remains a spectacle worth watching.

THE STORY (contains spoilers): Godzilla breaks out of the icy prison he was entombed in when we last saw him in GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN (aka GIGANTIS, THE FIRE MONSTER). Meanwhile, the producers of a Japanese reality TV show manage to track down the south seas island that's home to a mountainous monkey god: the one and only King Kong. After some human drama we get to the greatest wrestling match since the heydays of the WWF. Who will win in this battle of the century?

THOUGHTS: A bonafide classic of the genre and one of Godzilla's most well-known films. Godzilla gets a major makeover and his appearance more or less remained the same for the rest of the 60's-70's ""Showa"" series of films with little alteration besides thinning down a tad over the years, (in order to make it easier for G-suit actor Haruo Nakajima to move around inside the thing). Poor old Kong looks mighty tattery here. Even Mister Magoo wouldn't be fooled by the shoddy suit the Toho F/X boys sewed together, but honestly that's beside the point. Shove your thinker into neutral and just watch the fur fly! While not as action-packed as it should be, KK vs. G is nonetheless great fun to watch. The English language adaption by producer John Beck differs greatly from the original Japanese version but, sadly, the US cut is the only one offered on our shores. Universal has never bothered to include the Japanese cut of the film (simply because they're too damn cheap), which is a shame. Still, the version we get is quite a trip. Lots of pasty white guy footage helps pad out the running time, the newly-shot segments designed to make the film more appealing to American audiences. The additional scenes are silly but amusing. Worst aspect of the American cut is the awful decision to strip most of Japanese composer Akira Ifukube's terrific original film score, replacing it with stock music cues from several Universal monster flicks, most notably The Creature From The Black Lagoon! Ugh. And despite stories that persist to this day, there is NO difference in the ending of the Japanese version and the American version. Godzilla was still a 'bad guy' when this movie was originally made back in 1962, so the final fade out is exactly the same regardless of which side of the Pacific you viewed it on.

THE BLU-RAY: Like so much of the product in Universal's vast library, KK vs. G also gets a by-the-numbers barebones release onto hi-def. It does sport an improved picture & audio, which is nice, but there are absolutely ZERO extras. No liner notes, no featurettes, no interviews, no commentary track, no nothin'!!! BOO! Universal apparently doesn't give a crap about doing proper restorations or fan-pleasing presentations for a vast amount of the movies in their vaults - with the exception of a handful of proven money-making titles (like JAWS). Everything else gets the short end of the stick. It seems only when a Universal title is licensed by a third party label does it get the proper attention & respect it deserves. (The Universal Blu-ray versus the one from Shout! Factory for John Carpenter's THE THING is an excellent recent example.) This is a shame, but Universal Studios is a business... and their business is making money. The rule is minimal amount of capital invested, in the hopes of maximizing profit. Unfortunately, this often leaves us fans stuck with whatever skimpy pap they crank out. Still, the audio & video are better here than on their previous standard-def DVD release, and the price is cheap enough. Worth the double dip for hardcore G-fans and marginally recommended to casual viewers, though I advise buying it used to save a few bucks.",1477353600,5,4119,4.848011363636363

These extremely cheesy grade B monster movies are treasures to me... I can't rationalize it, I know they are silly, but I love them! As I grew old my fondness has not diminished. I look at them now as stage wrestling matches with guys in monster suits destroying complex models and scenery... in other words JOY!!!",1464134400,3,436,4.395061728395062
3919524,3,B000ESST38,"This movie came about when John Beck went behind Willis OBriens back and sold OBriens idea of a battle between King Kong and Prometheus.  Beck got Toho Studio to use the idea, supplanting Godzilla for Prometheus (Frankenstein), cutting out Willis OBrien in the bargain.  OBrien tried to sue but couldn't because he didn't own the rights to Kong.  Then Beck made this American version of the film, editing in a phony newscaster/narrator and other clunky sequences that proved more of a hindrance than a help.  And thus we have this strange comedy of sorts.

3919526,4,B000ESST38,"King Kong is hanging around an island with these natives. This island is special because it is the only place where these little red berries that have special powers grow. A pharmaceutical company head wants Kong to use for publicity, so it sends these guys to get him. Meanwhile, Kong gets into a big fight with an octopus while protecting the natives, then drinks the juice and falls asleep. While this is happening, the natives do some traditional dance around him complete with wooden drums. The one lady in the front has the biggest coconuts, so this part is kind of exciting, if you know what I mean. They take Kong back to Japan, and this part is also funny because the guy in charge is such a geek. So to make a long story short, him and Godzilla wind up in Japan for the final showdown. It is funny because they use little toy trucks and tanks for special effects.",1456790400,,873,4.428571428571429

""King Kong vs Godzilla"" seems perhaps the unlikeliest of monster mashups; but believe it or not, this movie, which at times seems like a documentary hosted - G_D, help me, I'm not kidding, by an actor who was a dead ringer for now FOX News Anchor Shephard Smith - the actor was playing a newsman on an international television network, actually succeeds by poking fun at marketing experts who set out to capture the monster of Farrow Island in an attempt to boost a  pharmaceutical company's sagging fortunes.
Two intrepid marketing agents succeed beyond their wildest dreams by capturing an intoxicated King Kong, but cold brutal reality sets in when the Japanese government forbids any attempt to bring King Kong to the mainland.
Meanwhile, a Untied Nations command nuclear submarine that is investigiating the source of weird artic melting gets destroyed by...you guessed it Godzilla...who is on a course to the Japanese mainland.
Meanwhile King Kong escapes, no real surprise there, and the great plan by the Untied Nations is to have these two monsters fight it out to the death.  Who wins?  Now that would be telling.

The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because you're only getting the American version. Just like the original Godzilla King of the Monsters (Japanese version: Gojira) and Godzilla 1985 (Japanese version: The Return of Godzilla), King Kong vs. Godzilla has a lot of extra scenes filmed and added into the American version. So many that they usually delete some of the original Japanses scenes to make room for the American scenes.

3919609,3,B000ESST38,"King Kong vs. Godzilla is one of the most problematic in the Godzilla series right out of the gate, thanks to a dragging story and long objectionable sequences featuring Japanese actors performing as ""natives"" in blackface. The Blu Ray transfer here is uneven at best, with a lot of noise and film grain in several places. More importantly, it does no favors for a movie with effects that are low-rent even by the standards of the Showa series. The Godzilla and Kong suits are lackluster, as are the effects overall and rendering them in high-definition only accentuates their flaws. The audio mix is mono and no better than the DVD version, despite the packaging's promise of ""theatrical quality sound.""

As other reviewers have noted, this is the American version of the film, and the Japanese version is not offered on the disk. Having seen both, this is a rare occasion when one can make a case for the American version being better, despite atrocious dubbing, thanks its cutting a couple minutes of fat.

The problem is that Godzilla vs. King Kong's appeal is limited, due to the issues outlined above. It is a terrible introduction to Godzilla for people who haven't seen other films in the series, and it is most attractive to hardcore Godzilla fans, who will want the Japanese version as well.

I note that other reviewers mention rights issues regarding the Japanese version; I don't know anything about that, but I did purchase the Japanese version on an imported DVD with subtitles some years back. This disk is available via Amazon.com here:

The reviewer describes it as a bootleg. I am not sure that's the case, the packaging is in Japanese and prominently features the Toho logo on the spine. It was purchased in a store and several other kaiju titles were available with the same packaging.

Because I have a complete collection of Godzilla on film, I'm reasonably satisfied with this purchase, but I would recommend that newcomers to Godzilla start elsewhere.",1398902400,4,2113,5.255192878338279

Then I found out a few weeks ago it was coming out on blu ray and I ordered it right away. I was hoping there would be a little something extra after the regular DVD was as basic as you can get. We'll let me tell you, I was very disappointed in the blu ray release.  With the exception of a few extra piracy warnings, a more animated 'Universal Studios' swooshing across the screen, and the chapter drop down menu on the side of the screen, it wasn't worth buying this at all. I did not notice anything special visually. It was a straight out transfer with blu ray slapped on the package.

I am addressing a complaint that I've seen in many other reviews, and one that I have myself: the lack of the Japanese (and, arguably, superior) version of this film.  We've gotten spoiled by Sony and other distributors who've put both versions of the Godzilla films on their BluRay releases.  The problem with doing that with this film, simply put, is a rights issue.  Universal has the exclusive rights to the American version, Toho has exclusive rights to the Japanese version.  As far as I understand it, this agreement is perpetual.  The agreement also provides that neither studio can sell their version in the other studio's territory/market.

Therefore, fellow fans, the unfortunate truth is you will never see the Japanese version of ""King Kong vs Godzilla"" for sale in the USA (at least legitimately).  You'll have to purchase the Japanese version directly from Japan, and then play it in an all region/region free BluRay player.  That's a familiar situation for the longtime Godzilla fan, myself included, who haunted science fiction or comic conventions in order to purchase Japanese VHS tapes, and eventually DVDs, of Godzilla films long before they were ever made available through American companies.

3919616,3,B000ESST38,"I have mixed feelings about this film.  Having seen it when it was first released theatrically in America (I was ten years old) it was a stunning sight to see.  I had seen the original Godzilla on TV but this was my first experience seeing the Big G in a movie house in color and wide-screen.
However, entertaining as it undoubtedly is, this American version cheapens the Japanese version with its languidly portentous American-inserted scenes in a movie which was, by the way, intended as a comedy from the get-to, and as a result remains to this day the most-attended Godzilla film of them all.
Having said that, this version is in beautiful color (Hajime Koizumi was the Japanese cinematographer) and the effects are a something of a hit-and-miss affair.  Simply put, Godzilla fans tend to love it but Kong fans, well...
Certainly director Ishiro Honda had mixed feelings about making the film and it shows in his direction, uncomfortably balancing between silly comedy and tragic drama.
Some special features would have been nice (documentary, commentary, etc.), but it's hard to pass up the first movie teaming the most famous fearsome monsters of all time (both making their cinematic debuts in color) and is a must-have for the collector.

8368333,5,B000ESST38,"They really knew how to throw out a grand adventure back in the day.  This historied film has a lot of stories behind it and as many Godzilla fans know as they grew up arguing who really won this titanic tussle the big (and untrue) rumor was that Kong won in the Americanized version while in the Japanese version Godzilla arose in the sea and swam away.  I remember arguing with friends over this silliness!  But thats also the mark of a good/ fun movie.  King Kong has never (and I mean never) looked worse than he does in this movie.  From his un-convincing elongated arms to his rumpled face, his drunk puppet eyes, and his shoddy fur that makes him look at times like hes just slid through some huge turd tunnel Kong looks truly terrible.  But hes still recognizable as the King Kong and he is a fierce fighter, if not a little buffoonish.  Hes an inhabitant of Faro (sp?) island and worshipped by the natives.  When some enterprising Japanese come to collect him they enlist the natives help to get him drunk on some goofy berry juice.  But before that happens we are treated to an uneven but exciting giant octopus attackon land, yes, but still.and this devilfish was one of the scariest things to this young boys mind when this movie first appeared.

At any rate when Kong is transported on a giant raft back to Japan they have to explode it before he inadvertently capsizes the ship.  Kong then swims to Japan and tramples around the countryside before meeting up with an angry engine of destruction, Godzilla, awoken from a long nap that he was taking apparently while frozen in an iceberg.  Godzillas emergence from said berg is just one of many memorable Godzilla entrances but one of my favorite moments of the green (yeah, hes green in this film) gargantua is his slow menacing stroll along a river in the mountains as a train speeds toward him.  His inexorable approach threatens the passengers who disembark and run screaming and scattering across and through the river.  Its not long before the two titular beasties meet up and decide that its disdain on first sight.  They get to battling right away and Godzilla gets the better of Kong by far both with and without his atomic breath.  Godzilla shows off some moves in this movie.  But Kong is no slouch in the open air ring and in a wonderful moment he crouches down underneath a rock outcropping and waits for Godzilla to pass by him into a pit; when Godzilla does, his tail swaying back and forth like a prehistoric redwood log, Kong grabs it and proceeds to terrorize Godzilla by surprise for a moment before a literal flip of Godzis tail sends Kong to la la land.

But don't count Kong out as out of nowhere (and without any explanation) a storm brews and zaps Kong with lightening.  His face glows after being electrically irradiated and this gives him the energy of the Energizer Bunny, enough for him to go and beat back Godzilla into the sea (but not before they battle over Otami (sp?) castleanother standout moment in the film with many such moments), and as the sea roils from where they fall in after gasping moments only one monster rises to swim off into the sunset (theres no sunset)King Kong.

King Kong was definitely the good guy in this film and Godzilla the big bad guy.  Their larger-than-life fights are terribly fun and fantastical, full of anthropomorphized moves and apparent adversarial motives; rarely do these monsters act like actual monsters, excepting toward the human ants that they attempt to stamp out or tear down their towers.  The film, for all of its evidential flaws and sometimes laughably poor special effects, is a brisk and exciting adventure.  It boasts a new and one of the most revered Godzilla suits of the series making him look more reptilian than ever.  The Japanese cast is more secondary in this film than usual but in the first half, especially as they approach Kongs island, they carry the film as likable characters.  For all of todays big special effects blockbusters where heaps of millions of dollars are spent they still cant usually stand up to the good-natured and fun feeling of big adventure that a film like King Kong Versus Godzilla achieves.  Yes its dated, but oh what a date it is!!!",1524873600,,4220,4.638440860215054

8368335,4,B000ESST38,"I used to watch this movie at least once a month when i was a kid on a VCR tape that was obviously either recorded from another tape or ripped from a TV broadcast.

This was my first time watching the movie since then and boy was it a hoot.  In terms of overall production it's a mix bag, but good for the time period.  Kong's suit isn't very well made but Godzilla's looks decent, albeit probably originally designed to look more menacing in Black and white.

The end of the movie is a knock down drag out monster brawl that will leave you satisfied.  From Godzilla's stop motion drop kick to Kong shoving a tree down G's mouth; it's def. worth the wait.

As far as the DVD goes it's ""ok"".  The video presentation is solid, but it only has the american version of it.  I would have liked to finally see the Japanese cut of the movie.

Also there is only 1 language option which is the American dubbing.  Thankfully the voice acting is decent.  It also has some options for subtitles but that's it.  There isn't anything else on the disk which is a shame cause i would have liked some extras, but for the price i can't complain.

If you are a G fan and just looking to fill out your collection this disc will do the job.  If you are looking for the definitive version of the movie then you need to keep looking.",1518998400,,1311,4.21285140562249
