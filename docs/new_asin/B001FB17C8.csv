3566619,4,B001FB17C8,"The video was much fun to watch and included most of Billy Joel's songs that I was interested in hearing. The individual songs were done very much like the same songs heard on the radio, which I believe important in a live concert tape. Billy's backup group was excellent and Billy was at his best.",1289088000,,298,4.4363636363636365
3566620,1,B001FB17C8,"Why is this an import when it was live in Long Island.....????

if it an inport,  it means it has been illegally copied from VHS  to DVD  and is against the law in the USA..

Amazon????  you cant be that stupid or could you???

if you are,  then I will start selling my boot leg dvd's in here also.",1285372800,,298,3.9322033898305087
3566621,5,B001FB17C8,Billy Joel Live From Long Island is fantastic; the best concert video I have seen.  Joel maintains high energy throughout the concert and his band is fun to watch.  Every song is performed beautifully.  I recommend this concert video to everyone who enjoys music.,1277337600,4,263,4.931818181818182

3566653,5,B001FB17C8,"Billy Joel, of course, has had a long and successful career with many hit songs we all recognize, but back in the 80s he was writing his very best material. This high-energy performance is an exciting chronicle of a great moment in his career. And it's got Scenes From An Italian Restaurant in it, so how can you go wrong? ;-)",1370995200,,326,4.360655737704918
3566654,3,B001FB17C8,"Time to release an authentic DVD or Blu-Ray of this show (Recorded in 1983. Ignore 2009). Its his best concert that's been captured on video, but these dvds are taken directly from a VHS source, and its picture quality is poor.

So, if you have to have it, buy from a secondary seller that sells it for cheap.",1362096000,8,309,4.327586206896552
3566655,1,B001FB17C8,"This DVD looks like someone just took the VHS video and put it on DVD.
Not worth the time or money to spend on it.
It was a total disappointment so save your money.",1358899200,5,164,3.8529411764705883
3566656,4,B001FB17C8,"This is obviously a digital copy from a VHS tape so the picture is a little flat but the audio is nice and a little tweaking on the equalizer will make it very listenable. Not sure if this is a legitimate release or not but think very high end bootleg. Also comes as a CD. And both cheaper than any bootlegs you'll find.

The best part is the play list. Every artist should have concert CD like this. Billy is right at his peak. His voice is at it's best. The band is great. My only complaint about this is they cut out ALL talking between songs. Billy likes to bullshit a lot and I would have liked to have that on here. Billy Joel has had a TON of live releases both on CD and DVD and I'd rank this his best show.",1343952000,,715,3.9652777777777777
3566657,3,B001FB17C8,"Very sad, but as other reviewers have said, they should have remastered this from the original recording.  C'mon Billy!  Excellent performance, poor quality video.  I can't complain too much, because bang for the buck, I got it ""for a song.""  I knew what I was getting into.  So don't pay much for this (less than $10)!  Make sure to get the Stranger 30th anniversary collection, since it is a steal!  It includes 2 DVD's, one made during ""The Stranger"" tour and the other for ""The Old Grey Whistle Test (BBC's ""MTV""), both of excellent film quality.  Also, of course, included is The Stranger, remaster and a copy of BJ's actual songwriting notebook!",1341360000,2,651,4.75
3566658,5,B001FB17C8,"I have been a huge fan of Billy Joel for almost 40 years. The Live from Long Island concert is by far his BEST LIVE PERFORMANCE. This may have been recorded 30 years ago, but it is still his BEST live show available. This was recorded on December 30, 1982, at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on Long Island. As everyone else has commented, yes, the video quality is not great, but it is adequate until a version with better resolution comes along. The sound quality is great though. If you don't own this concert already, do yourself a huge favor and buy this DVD. It may not be perfect, but what in this life is? This is just BJ and 6 other musicians. No huge production numbers, no lavish orchestrations, just Billy Joel and his timeless music.",1338076800,,748,4.467153284671533
3566659,1,B001FB17C8,"I've had this tape for many years. Unfortunately, I no longer have a VHS player in my system. My question is: who in hell owns the rights to this great performance? I'm convinced a release in either SD DVD or Blu Ray would sell like crazy. Incredible! Some of the garbage being released on Blu Ray is....well......garbage, while this landmark show sits idle on VHS tape only. ?????????",1329004800,2,385,4.676470588235294
3566660,5,B001FB17C8,"I bought this DVD knowing that it's from Argentina and from an old HBO concert special long before the days of HD video and audio.  While the picture quality is what one would expect coming from standard resolution, it is quite acceptable.  The sound is better than I expected, giving you not only a stereo option, but surround in both DTS and Dolby as well.  I have HD TV and surround audio with a Blu-ray player that upscales DVD, just so you know the basis of my opinion.

This concert video has always been the best Billy Joel show I've ever seen.  I had it originally when it was released back in the early 80s and have since seen Billy live and on other concert videos (including Shea Stadium in Blu-ray).  This is Billy at his prime both visually and sonically.  If you want to see Billy at his best, this blows away the Shea Stadium concert.

Considering that this was available on Amazon for $8.40 (including shipping) and arrived in 3 days, this DVD is an excellent value,",1316736000,12,982,4.446927374301676
3566661,1,B001FB17C8,"I own the original Sony beta hifi video of this concert and it truly is the best recorded show of its kind, period! The audio is great, the video is as good as beta could be (which was better than VHS). So with DVD being out forever, it would seem that the issuing studio would release this amazing concert on DVD for all of us fans. Not so. Originally released by Fox Home Video, no one seems to be taking responsibility for putting the DVD version out. I personally contacted the director and the producer of this video and each of them told me the people to talk to were Fox. I did try to contact Fox Home Video but no one returned my calls. I did buy the DVD on this page and it's a piece of junk. The picture quality is whack and it's off aspect--4:3 spread to 16:9. The audio is about the same as my beta hifi version. I'm surprised Fox haven't taken notice and jumped on the opportunity to release this jewel in an improved form. Surely, the master tapes are in their vault.",1307318400,11,981,4.195767195767195
3566662,2,B001FB17C8,"As others have mentioned, this DVD appears to be mastered from an old VHS tape, complete with the little silver lines in the picture that VHS tapes get when they have dropouts.  Picture detail is about as sharp as a VHS tape, too.  This concert was also released on LaserDisc way back when, but nooooo, for this DVD they used an inferior VHS tape instead.

One thing I've NOT seen mentioned is, this concert was recorded on standard definition video with a 4:3 aspect ratio.  This DVD plays at a 16:9 aspect ratio, presumably stretched horizontally to fill new widescreen TV's.  So Joel and the band all look a bit short and fat throughout the concert unless you can play with the output settings of your player.

Sound quality fares much better, especially on the DTS track.

But since I still have my LaserDisc player, I think I'm going to go hunting for the old LaserDisc version of this concert instead of keeping this P.O.S.",1300492800,6,929,4.593939393939394
8301540,4,B001FB17C8,"I know this may not be a very crisp or clear video. I also see the contrast is flat, but it's an amazing show from Billy Joel's fantastic Nylon Curtain tour.
I also happened to be at this very show, and it brought back such wonderful memories.
However I wish they would produce an enhanced version, that would be spectacular!",1460851200,,325,4.433333333333334

8301543,1,B001FB17C8,"I love Billy Joel music.  I am from Long Island.
I had this Long Island concert on a VHS tape years ago.
This appears to be a boot-leg DVD.  Please stop letting the seller sell this Amazon!
There is no menu, the video and audio quality is terrible.
This is not legally sold on the Billy Joel web store site, so this must be an illegal DVD.
I do  hope they make a legal, good DVD of Billy Joel's Live Long Island concert from years ago.
Don't buy this - buy Billy Joel's Live concert at Shea Stadium.  That is legal and a great concert.",1411776000,2,535,4.066666666666666
8301544,1,B001FB17C8,"I ordered this DVD just for grins but grimaces is what I got. I won't address the audio since most of these cuts can be had on CD. The video, though, is trash! This is, as suspected, a straight recording from a VHS tape! Viewed on my 70"" lcd it's unwatchable! The packaging is home made and obviously this thing was bootlegged in somebodies basement (probably next to their meth lab.)

Fortunately I caught this show on the MSG network, out of NY and, while it isn't HD as the stated, it very watchable.

I'll keep the MSG performance on my DVR until it's released in at least SD.

Don't waste your money on this trash!

8301546,5,B001FB17C8,"Even though I saw Billy Joel live in 1990 when he was very good it doesn't come close to this concert in 1980 when he was in his prime as both a singer, piano player and overall rock and roll superstar who  with his boundless energy really electrified his audience.
