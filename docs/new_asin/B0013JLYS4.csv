This is so simple and broken down, it would only entertain a child with a severe disorder.  It shows the child going into the restaurant and says ""He is going into the restaurant.  He is going to cross the street now to go into the restaurant.  He is going to hold his grandfather's hand to go into the restaurant.  He is going to cross the street now.  He is going into the restaurant now.""  Drove me crazy!!",1304899200,,552,4.1415094339622645
8251302,4,B0013JLYS4,"I purchased this DVD for my 4 year old daughter with ASD.  Since my husband ahd I eat out frequently, I was thrilled to see that someone offered a social stories DVD on this topic.  Overall, Little Pilgrims did a good job identifying the key points of the restaurant experiencing from how to order from the menu to how to pay the bill.  Little Pilgrims also did an excellent job covering restaurant manners.

While I personally found the DVD to be a bit bland, my daughter loves it.  Since she is the target audience, I would say that Little Pilgrims hit its mark.  The DVD really seems to help her to make sense of the restaurant experience.  Since my daughter is hyperlexic, she really seems to appreciate how the producers used labels in this DVD.",1216080000,5,750,4.511111111111111
8251303,5,B0013JLYS4,The creators of this video series really understands what autistic kids need. They are paced much better than videos for 'typical' kids. The therapist who talks at the end is spot on. This video series is extremely valuable for parents of children with autism. I would highly recommend all of them and their companion picture books which help because autistic kids are visual learners.,1205539200,2,385,5.03125
