4231142,5,B003YLQZLK,"I was in Jordan when Arabic Nursery Rhymes for Children was launched at a bookstore there (by Al Salwa Publishing House) some months ago.  It was amazing to see the response of the parents and children who attended.  I brought up my own children in the US many years ago and would have loved to have had something like this available, as they loved the English nursery rhymes we kept borrowing from the public library.  I bought several packets of books and DVDs of the Ahazeej in Amman, which I gave as presents to friends with young children.  I honestly believe this is the best present you can give your child or a friend's child.  The familiar rhymes are set to music adapted from the original folk chants and sung beautifully.  The artwork is original and very imaginative, often incorporating Arabic words that tumble, swirl or swing.
I can't say enough about the DVD or the books.  They are sure to be imitated now, but they have set a high standard and will surely become classics in the field of Arabic children literature.",1296777600,2,1033,4.612021857923497
4231143,5,B003YLQZLK,"""I bought the complete set of Arabic Nursery Rhymes with the DVD for my son's birthday and from then on the DVD is the only thing that keep my 3 kids quiet and the audio CD is what ensures that our car rides are peaceful and free from fights! We've used the audio CD so much that we need to get more copies to ensure that our house is never free of music! Thank you from bringing these old classics back to life!""

""Khaled is refusing to move. He is sitting on the floor, wearing a Tarboosh, clapping, singing, and dancing to Ahazeej. Tanah & Leen just joined him. We all raise our hats to you.""

""I want to commend you on this fabulous body of work which was much in demand, especially by people like us, expats who live in a multicultural society where Arabic is forgotten.""

""Faris loves Hijallah and laughs out loud, he now anticipates the last part and starts laughing well before...""

""My daughter is too young to sing along to Ahazeej but her face lights up whenever I put it on tv and she dances to it when it's on in the car.
Finally there's an Arabic option for great nursery rhymes our kids can grow up to. Thank you!""

""Lulwa has been reciting the turtle song, Fares has learnt it by heart too and so had their cousin... and they are craving for more!""

8409652,1,B003YLQZLK,"initially thought I didn't like it, and thought it was hard esp for my 3 year old who I am trying to get her to love Arabic. but afterwards I started loving the songs and my kids enjoys it so much.",1489017600,,197,3.8292682926829267

8409654,5,B003YLQZLK,"My parents were both born & raised in Jordan. I purchased this DVD because I want my child to experience the Arabic language from an early age. I actually brought this for my parents, so that each time they babysit or we are visiting, they can play the DVD for my baby or the other grand kids. My parents absolutely love the DVD and were even able to sing along to a few they remembered from their own childhoods! Very rewarding...",1404345600,,431,4.333333333333333
8409655,5,B003YLQZLK,I bought this for an baby from the middle east that was on my unit at the hospital.  He seemed to enjoy it.,1372204800,,107,3.652173913043478
8409656,5,B003YLQZLK,I highly recommend this DVD to anyone that is looking for Arabic nursery rhymes to teach their little ones. This was the first DVD that actually caught my son's attention at a vey young age (a few months old).  It's animated with short nursery rhymes that are very catchy.,1352678400,,272,4.551020408163265
8409657,3,B003YLQZLK,Cute rhymes and catchy songs.  My child got bored of it and never watched it more then twice.  He loves the Sesame Street DVDs more.,1347408000,,132,4.24
8409658,5,B003YLQZLK,"I am so happy with this DVD-- it is exactly what I have been searching for! This is a great collection of traditional rhymes and short songs in Arabic that is really nicely done. Good music and singing, cute images to go along with it, and subtitles in Arabic. My son loves it, and I've learned a lot of rhymes I didn't know that I can now sing to him. I'm also really happy that there isn't any English on the screen. That's just confusing when trying to teach a child Arabic. My mom recognized at least half of the rhymes that she had forgotten but knew as a child. Thank you for helping us to continue passing on traditional rhymes to our children! Hooray!",1345766400,,659,4.28
8409659,2,B003YLQZLK,"Although my family and I are not Arabic speakers, we live in the middle east, and wanted to get something cute to help my toddler work on her Arabic skills and expand her vocabulary. But the animations are too abstract and do not engage her enough so she loses attention quickly. Such a shame. If your child has more developed Arabic skills or is a native speaker, this might work for you. Since I teach in a bilingual (Arabic/English ) classroom, my counterpart can use it so hopefully it wasn't a complete waste of money.",1340236800,4,523,4.515789473684211
8409660,5,B003YLQZLK,"This is a must have attention grabber for your little one who you intend for him/her to learn Arabi. It is great. Mine scratched after about 2 weeks. I've bought toast to try and fix it, otherwise that is the only advice I can give. Get a home copier so you won't have to buy new dvds, if you have kids who love this as much as my child does. That way it will not get worn out.",1310601600,,377,3.8461538461538463
