4834583,5,B005MAHY0M,The essence of Sicily and the Italian language captured in the Montalbano series.  The English captions enhance the understanding of the circuitous plots.  The characters are wonderful and well developed.  I can hardly wait for more.  I have the entire translated series of books and captioned DVDS.,1328659200,5,299,5.297872340425532
4834584,5,B005MAHY0M,"I love the Montalbano DVD's. I have purchased them all and they are witty, amusing, well acted and well produced.",1325289600,4,113,4.7
4834585,5,B005MAHY0M,"I'm pleased to say I too have read all of Camilleri's Detective Montalbano novels and have been talking them up with everyone I know who likes 'good reads.' They are well written, highly entertaining, and they bring style, class, humor and a conscience to the Detective genre.
  Likewise with the freakin' brilliant DVD adaptations because the cast, the directing, locations, storylines not only make the words come alive but make damn near make them sing! If you don't find yourself liking the cast and the stories then call your doctor and find out out if you can get an better entertainment transplant.
  Number 19 is Camilleri's latest novel, The Potter's Field while number 20 is yet to be in book form, well, at least on the English edition bookshelves. Both are good stand alone stories, both are complex, entertaining, and will keep you guessing all the way to the well tied up ends!
  Buy them for yourself or for those family and friends that like good movies. Hey, you'll learn some working Italian in the process!",1323043200,,1025,4.795454545454546
4834586,5,B005MAHY0M,"I have all of the Montalbano DVD's.  I have also read all of the Camilleri books in this series. "" Potter's Field"" has everything the book has and more.  Perfect timing and perfect blend of comedy and pathos.  The second DVD ""The Seagull's Dance"" is not a script from a book (yet?) and it is less comic and more serious than most of the others.  The new twist here is that Fazio goes missing and Montalbano's task is to find him (and hope he finds him alive).  It's worth watching and I enjoyed it (and would buy it again), but I missed the comic elements that I've come to look forward to.

Camilleri's sense of the world and the fairness that he treat us to with Montalbano's obvious respect for all of his characters no matter how unconventional/outlandish/poor etc., is just one of the elements that makes me enjoy this series more than I can say.

Oh and one last thing....glad to see Montalbano swimming again.  The ladies will understand.",1321833600,12,945,4.517647058823529
4834587,5,B005MAHY0M,"Here are plot summaries(copied from the box); judge for yourself:

THE POTTER'S FIELD

""When a body is found cut into pieces and wrapped in a plastic bag, all signs point to an old-fashioned Mafia-style execution.  The case becomes especially complicated for Montalbano when his friend Mimi starts behaving erratically and insists on handling the investigation himself.  His first reaction is irritation until he realizes that his colleague may be indirectly involved in the killing.  An old friendship gets tested as Montalbano tries to help his friend get out of the most dangerous predicament of his life.""

THE DANCE OF THE SEAGULL

""Montalbano's worst nightmare begins when the father of trusted deputy Fazio reports his son missing.  Convinced that he is off on an investigation of his own, which may have gone bad, Montalbano comes across ominous signs of a shootout.  A witness reports having seen him (Fazio) captured by two criminals who were talking about throwing him into a dried-up well and the search becomes frantic.  Fazio remains missing in action but Montalbano is determined to find his old friend and colleague alive at all costs.""

Both episodes are good entertainment; but I think I preferred the shorter episodes.",1321315200,,1237,5.165829145728643

4834601,5,B005MAHY0M,"DETECTIVE MONTALBANO is the cannoli of television. You take one bite out of sheer curiosity, and the next thing you know, you're belly-up to the table, halfway through an entire plate of the damned things, and never mind your diet.

For those unfamiliar with this superb mystery-comedy-drama series produced over many years by Rai Television, DETECTIVE MONTALBANO follows the life of Salvo Montalbano (Luca Zingaretti) a wily, quirky, quarrelsome, food-addicted Sicilian cop who is police chief in the small but far from sleepy seaside Sicilian village of Vigata, where the next crime is never more than one plate of pasta away. Backing up Salvo, and quite frequently fighting with him (this is Sicily, after all) are his long-suffering, long-distance girlfriend Livia, hot-tempered and perpetually amorous second-in-command/best friend Mimi Augello, bumbling but loveable aide Catarella, gentlemanly sleuth Fazio, trigger-happy Galuzzo, lazy CSI tech Jacomuzzi, and of course the irritable pathologist Dr. Pasquale. Together they are half-family, half-colleague, and all entertaining. This DVD set includes two episodes, ""The Potter's Field"" and ""The Dance of the Seagull.""

The Potter's Field: A dismembered corpse is found in a plastic bag, so naturally everyone assumes it's another Mafia-related murder, but Montalbano isn't convinced...and he becomes even more suspicious when Mimi Augello not only demands control of the investigation but begins acting even more ill-tempered than usual (""He made Catarella cry!"" Fazio shouts). Throw in a gorgeous Columbian woman and an aging Mafiosi laboring under an old obligation, and you have a recipe for a (literally) delicious mystery.

The Dance of the Seagull: When Detective Fazio goes missing in the middle of a case, Montalbano calls out all the troops -- as well as his considerable detective ability -- to find out what happened and to track down those responsible. But before he can locate Fazio, he has to find out just what the young cop was investigating when he disappeared. The search puts Montalbano head to head with his old ""friends"" in the Sinagra Crime Family, one of whom is hiding a bizarre secret that is well worth killing for.

Both of these stories are first-rate mysteries, but best thing about MONTALBANO is not the plotting -- which can at times be convoluted and sluggish -- but the superb writing (adapted for TV from the novels of Andrea Camilleri), the wonderful chemistry between the actors, and the exploration of Sicilian life and culture -- a life of food, family, argument, corruption, humor, violence and intrigue. That, and Luca Zingaretti, who is just a joy to watch, and brings to the screen the same mix of genius and idiosyncratic irascibility that Jeremy Brett did to the amazing Granada TV SHERLOCK HOLMES series of the 1980s/90s. You can lie to him, shoot at him, even try to burn down his house, but damn it, don't you dare interrupt his dinner!

""The Potter's Field"" and ""The Dance of the Seagull"" (in Italian with English subtitles) are presented in 16:9 anamorphic, and time in at about two and a half hours per episode. So sit back, open a bottle of wine, and get ready to feast your brain on some of the finest TV around...from Sicily, with love.

4834603,5,B005MAHY0M,"I am a big fan of Montlbano. He is so laid back yet has the Italian temper at times.
if you are looking for lots of gun play or car chases skip him.

4834605,5,B005MAHY0M,"We love this series.  The plot moves with an Italianate slowness and has a delicious cadence to it.  The characters are vivid, unforgettable and the acting excellent.
The supporting cast is a feature of the success of this series.  One looks forward to their participation and the essence of each character stays true from episode to episode.
The Sicilian landscape is harsh and bright and they do not try to glamorize it.  Thus, you feel as though you are among friends, going along with their adventures and
witness to a more intense version of real life.  Just enough crime and violence to make it interesting; not too much gore to be a big turn off and a feature unto itself.",1350000000,,679,4.625
4834606,4,B005MAHY0M,"In our insatiable thirst for detective thrillers, foreign language productions have the benefit of introducing us to a different way of life in a setting which might well suggest the location of our next holiday.

In this case, the drama is set in the fictional Vigata, a quaint old stone-built town spreading over a hilly Sicilian coastline bathed in perpetual sunshine. Detective Montalbano occupies an elegant flat overlooking the Mediterranean where he can relax swimming at the end of each stressful episode.

We are introduced to a slow-paced (apart from the crimes, that is) way of life revolving round food - a man will put the enjoyment of a good meal before rushing to greet his lover - and the extended family, where relatives and workers gather on a sunny terrace to consume plentiful meals together.

Smartly turned out and astute, Montalbano somehow commands the respect of his staff despite the kind of volcanic outbursts which would have him sent on an anger management course in Britain. Like most detectives, he is on shaky terms with more senior officials, perhaps in part owing to his tendency to break the rules, but survives in his post, probably because he always seems to solve the crime in hand, usually through his ability to make deductions from very slim evidence.

The denouement is often unpredictable, partly because the very complicated plot tends to have a few twists which are hard to follow - and to be honest at times implausible. It's quite fast-moving, so with the sub-titles as an added constraint you have to concentrate.

Overall, it's worth watching as the characters are well-developed, the dialogue is amusing, the cases have intriguing aspects, and all does not end happily in every respect - there is a gritty undercurrent, say in the suffering of Tunisian immigrants in ""The Snack Thief"" or the continual hints at bribery and corruption amongst higher ranking officials, making the ""honest"" Montalbano a rarity.",1335225600,2,1958,5.030864197530864
4834607,5,B005MAHY0M,"Our Inspector Salvo Montalbano, who works in the fictional town of ""Vigta"", in the equally fictional district of ""Montelusa"" in Sicily. Where the Sun is bright and life treads at a different pace, amongst classic bleached white villages and towns that would look out of place in a tourist guide book. In this almost Mediterranean idle there is darkness, decay and at times murder.

He and the members of Vigata's small police force, namely Mim Augello, Montalbano's second-in-charge, Fazio, Gallo, Galluzzo and the incredibly stupid yet very likeable Catarella, who mans the station's phones, among other minor tasks. While his whole team have suffered from his out bursts, and sometime strange management style he cares for them and in turn they are all very loyal to him, none more so than his girlfriend of 8 plus years. Salvo is a foodie, with a passion, and he rarely permits anything to get between him and good meal, including other social commitments. He is also an avid swimmer; so much so, his apartment is set on the beach front. While his girlfriend, Livia, has to compete with his detective work, we find in the latter series that he will take Livia on a short romantic holiday, although he is using this pretext to further his investigations. He also brings the new love of his life, in the form of a big black shaggy. As it turns out, this dog is the key to his latest case.
Luca Zingaretti who plays the major role really brings the detective to life; his characterisation for me is spot on. His case work always varied, and never what you would expect to happen happens - there are red herrings and misdirection!
In Salvo's work nothing is black and white; mainly his cases are in the grey zone. As one reviewer put it his cases do not have happy endings, while his investigations sometimes leads to organized crime, his stories rarely get totally focused on the Mafia rather they are part of the landscape and environment of where he works in and around.

The last few years have seen a plethora of foreign detective series from around Europe each series of any real credit brings fresh cultural nuances, behaviour and identity of their own. After years of British and American detective series these shows, are like a new revelation. While some may hate subtitles I can assure you that to see and hear these shows as they were originally broadcast is always best and I find them all the more enjoyable.

If you like detective stories then this instalment is not to be missed",1333065600,5,2493,4.700228832951945
