8136037,5,B000BI5MFO,"I bought this mainly for the footage of Ohtsuka Sensei performing his art, but as it turned out, the rest of the DVD was probably more valuable to me.

Ohtsuka Sensei Footage: Colour, well shot and generally well lit (out doors so toward the end of the day, the light isn't as good but still perfectly OK).  Each segment of film is played at normal speed and then at a slower speed to a soundtrack of Japanese Koto music (which can be a little irritating after a while!).  Ohtsuka Sensei's technique is endearingly amusing at times- some stances (that shouldn't) show heels in line, both knees bent which appears at odds with teaching from his students (Suzuki Sensei for example), unless he personally used tate Seishan for EVERYTHING which is possible! Kicks are often at gedan rather than chudan height, off target by not being in the midline (check out Chinto), his elbow comes out first when punching and parts of his body where his attention isn't focused sometimes waver and droop- things that I'd get pulled up on as a student!  However we don't expect our swimming or football coaches to play anywhere near the level of those they are teaching, and I believe Ohtsuka was a great teacher, so I have no problem with this 'sloppy technique'.

This DVD comes into its own when it begins to show the essence of Wado Ryu Karate, Inasu, Nagsu and Noru.  It explains them really well with plenty of examples shot very professionally and full and slow speed.  This section alone makes the DVD really brilliant and worth the money.  What is interesting though is observing the Dan graded students sparring in slow motion during the introduction talk over: they never once use Inasu, Nagasu or Noru!  Just goes to show that in the heat of combat, these subtle but powerful concepts often fly out of the window!

Anyway, as a DVD this is a very good but indeed and I highly recommend it.",1233446400,3,1884,4.63063063063063
