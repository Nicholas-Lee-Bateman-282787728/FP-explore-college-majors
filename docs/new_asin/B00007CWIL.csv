1805964,5,B00007CWIL,"I've been looking for a Tai Vhi DVD in the Yang Form for ages, this is it. Everything about it is really nicely done... I even took TV outside one day and practiced in the Garden... That was the best. LOL",1068336000,13,204,4.0
1805965,5,B00007CWIL,"Up until the summer I was feeling very depressed, sluggish, I was working out, but I was only really going through the motions.
I bought this DVD on a whim and just tried it once a week to begin with... to my surprise I started really looking forward to my weekly Tai Chi session... I think that Energy Training is the important factor, this isn't about working out, it's about harnessing Energy and because I'm so scattered, because of everything I'm doing this was really what I needed... I have now even started doing a bit of Yoga as a result of being more centered.... Thankyou Jayne Storey, this is a great DVD.",1067299200,26,617,4.469026548672566
1805966,5,B00007CWIL,At last a really well done Tai Chi DVD. Navigating through the various stances was simple and The Instructor has a great energy. I much prefer her to all the Male instructors... AAA+ I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Tai Chi.,1067299200,8,236,4.511627906976744
1805967,5,B00007CWIL,"Well, after purchasing volume 1, I wanted to go farther with my instruction.
I have just received Volume 2, and have tried it out.  It is terrific.  I was a bit apprehensive about advanced instruction, but the calming and careful approach of Ms. Storey is just the type of training I need.
I never imagined that I would enjoy Tai Chi.  However, with these two excellent volumes, 1 and 2, I would recommend these DVDs to anyone who is interested in a gentle form of exercise.  This is truly a great way to relieve stress and to get the physical energy that is needed to function at your best.
A final note:  Buy Volumes I and II.",1065398400,19,628,4.333333333333333
1805968,5,B00007CWIL,"Jayne Storey gives a practical and thorough job of teaching the art of Tai Chi.  I found this instructional video to be one of true quality.  I really liked the funky music and beautiful scenery.  As a beginner, I really needed excellent instruction, and believe I found it here!
I first thought I would NEVER be able to learn Tai Chi, but now I am confident in my style.  I owe this confidence to the careful and professional manner of Ms. Storey's technique.  This true master of Tai Chi is a superb teacher.  I am going to order Volume II as soon as possible.
Bravo!",1065398400,7,569,4.371428571428571
1805969,5,B00007CWIL,"This is without a doubt my favorite Tai Chi instructional DVD.
Jayne Storey is really on the money. Must be that british no nonsense thing. The whole thing is filmed on a beach in the Seychelles or some other exotic place. Also of note is the navigation system. Very well laid out.
There is also a trailer for an online sci-fi game on this DVD.
I downbloaded it off the internet for free, it's cool. but not related to the Tai Chi.. Some kind of Sponsorship i think.. Anyway first rate!... I'm buying Vol 2 now.",1054684800,19,511,4.333333333333333
1805970,5,B00007CWIL,"I have never done any kind of martial art what-so-ever. I have been wanting to learn T'ai Chi for a long time, and it has finally happened! The instructor (Jane Storey) does very well when instructing on how to do the T'ai Chi long form. She explains each individual move and gives several demonstrations to make sure you know how to do it. Being a DVD makes it easier too. For those moments when you're not sure about a movement, just hit the back button on your DVD player and you can just keep reviewing until you are sure. I have the first DVD finished and can't wait to start on the second one! I would definitely recommend this to people who want to learn T'ai Chi.",1047945600,63,671,4.291338582677166

7975127,4,B00007CWIL,"The moves are gentle enough for a beginner, but repetitive enough to make a good work out! It is appropriate for me and for my mother, age-wise.",1377475200,,144,4.37037037037037
7975128,4,B00007CWIL,"I've bought both Storey's DVDs and what I like about them is her energy and obvious enthusiasm for teaching. She looks great (and you'll love the British accent!!) and she is very clear to explain the moves. I've been to different classes over the years and can't remember any teacher really taking the time Storey does to explain how the movements are performed. There's no history, philosophy or endless lists of credentials like you see on other DVDs...just the moves, which was a welcome change.",1138492800,,499,4.882352941176471
7975129,5,B00007CWIL,"I spend a lot of money on t'ai chi videos and dvds. Most of them are performed by middle-aged men who don't relate to me - the viewer - at all. I liked Jayne Storey's video because she seems to talk to and be interested in the people she's teaching. All the other so called 'masters' may be doing better tai chi according to some reviewers, but hey, I'd rather watch someone I can relate to as a human being. Storey's a great teacher. She's warm and seems genuinely ""into"" her art. If you want ""pretentious"", sure there are other dvds...but this is a real woman teaching real tai chi to real people. Go ahead and buy it.",1138492800,,620,4.262711864406779
7975130,1,B00007CWIL,"This tape is the worst if you are planning to watch it more than once. She sadly goes REALLY slowly through the introductory workout explaining every move and repeating things to the point where I hated her after the first viewing. You just stand there for 80% of the time. Then when she finally moves to the part where she does the whole workout she just goes through it ten times faster and with no instruction at all. And it is a very wide shot where you can't even really see what is going on. Furthermore, the filmmakers seemed to have been trying more to make an artistic video than an instructional video. Whenever she is about to show you something crucial the camera angle is terrible or it dissolves or wipes to another shot during the important moments.

The music is terrible; every post-production aspect is poor the DVD isn't set up into meaningful chapters. There are no redeeming qualities to this tape. I keep coming back to it thinking that I wasn't in the proper mindset when I first attempted it but I just become angrier with the filmmakers and with the instruction. When I first got the tape I did it every day for a week and I didn't really improve at all because it is terrible instruction. I apologize for this rant, I just want to make sure that you don't fall into the same trap I did! Buy a better tape!",1119225600,16,1331,4.4105691056910565
7975131,2,B00007CWIL,"Unfortunately I did not enjoy this dvd at all. The instuctor's style was very bland. The instructor does not describe what she is doing very well. It's more like 'now do this, now move your arm up, turn your right toe in...' I could follow the instruction, but wasn't 'learning' anything. I kept thinking 'What am I doing? Is this the same move or a new one?' I couldn't remember anything as the dvd progressed. I was bored and disappointed. Granted, I am a beginner and hadn't seen (or purchased) Volume 1. Maybe that ruined my chances for success, I don't know. I really wish I had something more positive to say, but this dvd is on it's way back to Amazon. :(",1090800000,3,662,4.390243902439025
7975132,3,B00007CWIL,"Yang Style Taichi has been modified several times even within the first three generations of Yang family itself. While Taichi is first and foremost a martial art form, over the years, Yang style has gained more focus on health and spiritual cultivation over combat due to its vast popularity among people who need a morning exercise routine. This DVD will help you sweat and feel good about yourself but the form as taught will not help you correctly align your body, or develop your Chi (Qi,) much less defend yourself. If you treat Taichi as any other body exercise that improves your spirit, endurance, mood, fitness, etc., then this DVD will serve just fine. If you are looking to learn Taichi as a martial art, then you will need to look for a teacher or VHS tapes if you really do not have the resources. Due to low demand, most true masters do not have their teachings on DVDs yet. Masters William CC Chen and Yu Cheng Hsiang both offer their true variations of Yang style on VHS (I don't think Amazon carries them yet. Google for them.) Of course, these 'real' variations are much more difficult to learn (Just in terms of time, Yu Cheng Hsiang's 108-form will require at least 45 minutes to perform from beginning to end.) Though these tapes aren't cheap, they are the next best things to learn from a real life Taichi master.",1090454400,33,1335,4.589958158995816
7975133,5,B00007CWIL,"I wish the reviewer from China (think what you want, June 9, 2004 Reviewer: A viewer (Shanghai, China)) would have offered an alternative DVD in the review. For us beginners this is a great DVD that makes us feel good - if you know of something that is more accurate, then please avoid the condescention and recommend an alternative item.",1090368000,15,338,4.65
