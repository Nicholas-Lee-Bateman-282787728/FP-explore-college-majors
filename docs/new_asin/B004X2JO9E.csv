4491752,4,B004X2JO9E,Enjoyed the history and insight on the 1 year wonders...  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys baseball history and isn't old enough to remember the Pilots story.,1391990400,,162,5.0
4491753,5,B004X2JO9E,"I started reading Jim Bouton's Ball Four after my gf's father arley bought it for me for christmas.  I had 1.09 in my checking account today and this film cost 1.99 to rent.  I get paid tomorrow.  I work for a fortune 500 company but am still living paycheck to paycheck.  So was Bouton, but I needed to see this film and it did not disappoint.  I am as emotionally touched by this franchise more so than any other.  A one-year wonder.  and oh what a wonder indeed.  Prescription for life... get 149 pages into ball four, watch this amazing documentary and then finish the book.  I am enamored.",1389139200,,594,4.376146788990826
4491754,5,B004X2JO9E,The end of an era in so many respects.  I was a young kid but I remember.  And I will NEVER forget.,1371772800,,99,3.4545454545454546
4491755,5,B004X2JO9E,"This film is a great curricular edition to a college class I teach on Sports & Society. The students read Jim Bouton's BALL FOUR, and they love this film because it provides faces, voices, & images which all help their reading of that book. Great stuff -- balanced,  insightful, humorous.",1364860800,3,288,4.76
4491756,5,B004X2JO9E,"highly recommended to baseball nostalgiaists, or anyone who read and enjoyed Jim Bouton's Ball Four! Sad at times but over all very enjoyable.",1362441600,,142,5.217391304347826
4491757,5,B004X2JO9E,"A great little documentary about those one year wonders - the Seattle Pilots.  If you are fan of the book Ball Four, you should check it out.  Great soundtrack!",1312243200,5,160,4.482758620689655
4491758,5,B004X2JO9E,"Baseball is a metaphor for life.  Things just go different from plan.  Who would think you would have a major league team move to a major city for just one year?  Well folks, it happened and the Commissioner let it happen.  The story is a baseball classic.  Cheers, tears, and wait until next year.  But then, next year never came.  This movie is about real ballplayers, real emotion, real baseball.  The story is very well told.",1306454400,4,429,4.552631578947368

8445968,5,B004X2JO9E,"So pleasantly surprised by this DVD!  I am a life-long resident of Milwaukee, the place the Pilots ran off to, to become the Brewers, in 1970.  As thrilled as everyone here was to get a major league team at that time, not much was said here about why the Pilots were 'available'.  This video proves that there was indeed a back story to the whole situation.  At the time, Milwaukee was still smarting from having lost the Braves to Atlanta, so in that sense, no one here really cared.  But to here and see what another city was going through was enlightening.  Well-produced, and full of the passion that those who lost out were feeling.  Highly recommended to fans in either Seattle OR Milwaukee.",1483228800,,697,4.57258064516129

8445970,4,B004X2JO9E,"Worthwhile viewing for baseball historians, or fans of the Seattle clubs. Since my first MLB game was seen in Seattle, I have long felt an affinity for the Pilots, who existed before my time.

Anyhow, I also recommend reading Kenneth Hogan's book on the Pilots, as a companion piece, to appreciate this work even more:-)",1438819200,,320,4.818181818181818
8445971,3,B004X2JO9E,The Pilots are the most forgotten-about team in MLB history.  I rented this just to see clips.  I don't think I've ever seen but one clip of the Pilots and I've been watching baseball for 35 years.  The music has got to go.  Horrible.,1423008000,,234,4.25
8445972,5,B004X2JO9E,Great to see a documentary on a team that I personally got to see play.,1416700800,,71,3.8
8445973,5,B004X2JO9E,Interesting story about a team that lasted only one season.,1406851200,,59,5.0
8445974,4,B004X2JO9E,"Solid documentary on an important team and era in baseball history. Could have used some more game action/highlights, but I can appreciate that type of footage is probably hard to come by for a one-year team, and expensive even if you can find it. But it was good to see so many former Pilots participating in this presentation. Clearly they still feel a sense of kinship due to the circumstances of the ballclub  leaving after one year, but the 1969 Seattle Pilots live on in the hearts and minds of baseball fans, especially in the city of Seattle. I'm glad I bought this one, highly recommended for baseball history buffs and especially fans of Seattle baseball.",1397260800,3,665,4.732758620689655
8445975,4,B004X2JO9E,"For any baseball purist, the story of Seattle's first MLB team was very enjoyable, and it's easy to see that the idea of a Seattle team was too far ahead of its time.",1394668800,,166,4.0606060606060606
8445976,4,B004X2JO9E,"As a former Seattle  sportscaster (Sonics, 1981-82), I truly enjoyed the video and the interviews. It is unbelievable to me that the American League would go ahead with such an under-financed group. It is also unbelievable how the city did not live up to its  promises to get the ballpark renovated.  I spent some time with Jim Bouton that summer of 1969, after he had been traded to the Astros, and I got the idea that he was working on something special (he certainly was, with Ball Four), and this story of the Pilots needs to be seen by baseball fans everywhere.",1393286400,,566,4.529411764705882
