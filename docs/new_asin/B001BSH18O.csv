3498603,5,B001BSH18O,"Thanks for the history lesson, Tom, but Holy Cow!  If the only acknowledgment of the music you heard today is ""While the score is certainly engaging and momentous at times.."" and your best recommendation is to forget the opera and read a book chronicling the Manhattan Project, why did you spend the money to go to the opera?  Like any theater piece, opera is at its best dealing with human passions and the conflicts which arise between people in relationship to each other.  Words, music and visuals combine to create a vivid metaphor for the human condition, and perfect historical accuracy need not be part of the equation.  The hopes and fears of the scientists as they struggle with creating a device they hope will save lives but may indeed pose the threat of annihilation; the personality conflicts between two scientists working toward the same goal while harboring different personal agendas; the costs that single-minded dedication to an urgent goal may exact on a precious personal relationship; the contrast between hard concrete left-mind science and mysterious, numinous native spirituality; and above all, the struggle of a sensitive and artistic temperament to reconcile his sense of beauity and love with the monstrosity he has created--these are the business of opera, and Doctor Atomic is a riveting exploration of those issues.

Adams' music reflects these struggles magnificently, flowing through them all, from love and passion to lurking menace and fear, like a river.  I, too, was in the theater today for Doctor Atomic, and I was knocked flat by the electrifying scene at the end of Act I, as Oppenheimer, alone with his creation as it looms over him, writhes in an agony of conscience over what he has done.  The historical record supports this idea, and you can see it there on his face in any portrait of the man even if he didn't really stand there alone in the moonlight. But even if it wasn't real fact, it is a perfect way for the artist to illustrate one of the major cosmic themes of the opera and of our day.  Any viewer/listener with the equipment to allow the music, poetry, and images to work their triple magic on one's conscious and unconscious being would have to be struck dumb by the power of that scene.  This is great theater--cosmic questions made real in the passions of human beings--so, who cares about history at a moment like that?  On that level, Doctor Atomic is a work of genius which takes one's breath away.

I've read my World War II history as well, and it has enriched my experience of this opera; for example, I am inspired to revisit the historical record to see if my memory of the characters of Oppenheimer and Teller should be adjusted because of the surprisingly different angle on their personalities and conflicts which the opera presents.  But that's only an interesting sidelight compared with the overwhelming emotional experience of surrendering to the sights, sounds and words of great human passions, illustrated as only a great opera can do.

If these live transmissions by the Met can help people learn to park their preconceived ideas at the door for a couple of hours and open themselves to such powerful experiences, they have done their job. Leave the history books next to your easy chair for some other cold day in front of the fire.",1226188800,18,3315,4.825396825396825
3498604,4,B001BSH18O,"The plot is based on the last days of the Manhattan project, but in fact the greatness of this opera is the portraying of the human struggles of the people involved in the project. The plot itself is the reason to get into those very human emotions and struggle, so the full accuracy of the plot doesn't seem to me of crucial importance. The best music is for those internal looking moments, with the necessary ""actions"" to put everything in perspective (sounds familiar?). Some of the tense moments in the plot are for music only, masterly composed by John Adams.
I have the feeling the production is over played which sometimes disturbs and distracts. In addition, some of the close-ups (for the DVD) are over-dramatic veering the attention from the poetry and the music. The music and the lyrics are beautiful and strong enough. It doesn't need over-acting and distractions like people moving fast on the scene.
The last scene of first act is impressive, in particular when Oppenheimer silhouette raises his hand and finger to the ""Gadget"" (God?)... but there is no finger responding this time.
Remembering that all music (and opera) was once new, this DVD is recommended for all Opera lovers and enthusiasts.",1226102400,20,1212,4.888349514563107
3498605,1,B001BSH18O,"My wife and I had the opportunity to see this through the Met HD Live program in November 2008.  Having studied the history of the atomic bomb development extensively as part of a graduate history degree including a week long trip to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to the annual anniversary of their destruction, we were both looking forward to seeing this show.  It is always intereting and enlightening to see a gripping historical story told via a different medium.

We were both deeply disappointed.  While the score is certainly engaging and momentous at times, the story that Mr. Adams has opted to tell is extremely one-sided and almost wholesale adopts the new revisionist history that many scholars are pushing that paints the United States as aggressor.  For those of you who may have less familiarity with the events in the Spring and Summer of 1945 in advance of the Japan bombings, some background is necessary.  While initial development of the bomb was started to parry what was believed to be an active and fast-moving German atomic bomb development effort.  However, it became fairly clear even before the Allies had Germany on the run that any such bomb effort was small at best and was likely cancelled due to cost and a belief that such a weapon was simply not feasible.  For a far more engaging artwork that explores the German bomb program, pick up a copy of Michael Frayn's Copenhagen.

With an investment quickly climbing into the billions, the US decided to continue with the Manhattan project with hopes that the weapon could be completed fast enough to bring an end to the War in the Pacific without an invasion of Japan.  It is here where modern historians bifurcate into two main camps.  What is clear is that the war was largely won by the Spring of 45 with the Japanese on the run, out of resources, and making at least some overtures for peace through back channels.  What is less clear is how serious such peace pursuits were as the public face of the Japanese war machine continued to call for every Japanese to give their life if necessary to continue the prosecution of the war.  Some historians (e.g., Gar Alperovitz and Peter Kuznick) have argued that the US pushed ahead with the bomb development while essentially ignoring the Japanese entreaties for peace.  The reasons given for such an aggressive position range from the need to demonstrate the bomb as a warning to Russia to simple blatant racism on the part of Truman and others in his administration toward the Japanese.  If one adopts this view, then it is a short and slippery slope to considering the US decision as an act of genocide.  Proponents of this view downplay the possibility of a Japanese invasion with the subsequent loss of Allied troups as little more than US propaganda.

While I personally believe there is reason to question the US actions, their timing, and the public vs private justifications recorded at the time, there is also extensive evidence to show that Japan was willing to go on fighting indefinitely if they were unable to reach acceptable terms of surrender possibly creating a clear need for some form of invasion.  It is this second view that is absent in John Adam's work.  Aside from having various storytelling elements that seem to make almost no sense to the main theme of the work, Oppenheimer, the US military, and the US overall are made to look as though they were hell bent to drop atomic bombs on Japan no matter what.

Art of any form is always subjective, representative of the artist viewpoint, and open to a variety of interpretations by the audience viewing the art.  In this case, the artwork purports to tell the story of Robert Oppenheimer stating clearly and boldly that his is a modern Faust.  The analogy simply does not hold.  The history presented is highly skewed.  Much of the imagery and allusion is off base and the texts used to create the libretto simply do not work.  Save your money on this one.  If the topic really interests you, spend the almost four hours of your life that watching this takes to instead read Richard Rhodes' Pulitzer Prize-winning book, The Making of the Atomic Bomb.

Epilogue: A number of individuals have taken issue with my focus on history and not the artistry, i.e., it's an opera not a history textbook.  I have added this epilogue to simply note that John Adams goes out of his way to talk about how he spent significant time determining which historical documents to include as part of the libretto.  My point was/is that his selections are highly skewed in my opinion.  I did not see the open and purposeful ambiguity to foster thought on the part of the audience that others claim to have seen.",1226102400,20,4683,4.731527093596059
3498606,5,B001BSH18O,"As one who has seen both the San Francisco and the new MET staged version of this important 21st century opera, I highly recommend the DVD as a ""close up"" experience of the memorable dramatic moments in the Peter Sellars production.

Sellars directed the DVD and has orchestrated this production to bring out the interplay among the characters and to capture intimate moments that could not be seen this way on stage.

At the same time, it captures the fleeting movements of the Lucinda Childs dancers among the scientists and workers and their last minute preparations for the Trinity test.",1225238400,16,591,4.9

My favorite extra, on disc 1, is the visual synopsis of opera allowing you to easily get to know all the characters.

3498608,5,B001BSH18O,"I've held off writing about Dr. Atomic. I've now watched it for the third time and haven't changed my mind. It's a masterpiece. There's no denying some of the power of the score, but it is in the many more introspective moments that I find its most arresting beauty and power.

Gerald Finley - a singer I went nuts for as Papageno nearly 20 years ago, still has a marvelously appealing boyish handsomeness that suits this role to a tee. This could be the role of his career so far. The voice is in absolutely peak condition, one of the most beautiful baritones singing today (in my opinion) with a winning combination of brightness, mellowness, one of the most even-sounding vibratos of any singer today and a light rich quality that simply gleams. His body was made for the stage, moving with a relaxed athleticism, and knows how to strike a pose that hits you like a spotlight. In many regards, his intensity reminds me of another favorite singer of mine, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson in that his gestures - while highly theatrical, seem germane, perfectly suited to the character - as though they could not be performed any other way. This is star quality that elevates a performance to greatness.

The most powerful moment for me remains the ending of the first act, Oppenheimer's brilliant prayer/aria ""Batter my heart, three person'd God."" I cannot watch this without tears pouring from first to last. The music itself is remarkable, but combined with Finley's voice, and passionate interpretation, the heightened sense of movement by Peter Sellars and the staging itself, it becomes nearly unbearable in its intensity and beauty. With the bomb behind a curtain, like some templed sacred object behind a veil, Oppenheimer slowly approaches the veil, then turns and falls, and repeats the a series of gestures, each time with increasing intensity rising, falling, beating his heart with fist, hands to his head, then again approaches the veil. Following the final verse, he enters the veiled room, left in silhouhette, his hand raised towards the object itself. It is one of the most beautifully powerful stagings of an aria I've experienced.

Richard Paul Fink is another of my favorite singers and his beautiful bass sound, remarkable diction and fine dramatic instincts make his portrayal of Teller as important as the central role of Oppenheimer, particularly in the first half. Jessica Rivera is simply amazing as Kitty Oppenheimer, her first aria ""Am I in your light,"" as the couple is in bed, her husband trying to study, offers a stunning contrast to all of the music before it. Oppenheim gives up his reading, and responds to her, climbing over and gently caressing her with stanza from Baudelaire. It is a quiet, intimate and beautiful moment.

Eric Ownes offers a richly detailed, entirely believable performance as General Groves, expressing his frustrations, concerns, detailing his weight issues (complete with calorie counts!) in that gorgeous, sonorous baritone of his.

The remainder of the cast, James Maddalena, Thomas Glenn, Jay Hunter Morris, and particularly the oddly moving performance of Ellen Rabiner as Pasqualita, are all up to the same level as the central roles.

I have some issues with the staging, and could have easily been happier if Lucinda Childs' incessant choreography had but cut - by at least half. Some of it is highly effective, such as the angular, ritualistic movement out in the desert, but much of it appeared as though a rehearsal for the Jets and Sharks were taking place at the rear of the stage while an opera was going on.

The chorus of De Nederlandse Opera sings English about as well as any English speaking chorus, and the musical direction of Lawrence Renes with the Netherlands Philharmonic rises to the level of Adams' remarkable score.

If I've any gripe (outside of the unnecessary choreography) it would be one I've made of many live performance videos: no curtain calls or opportunity to see - and share in - the audience's reaction. This is a bad move in my opinion. I understand by the end of viewing this how emotionally drained a viewer can be - I was exhausted - but there were several thousand people cheering this and, apparently, an enormous ovation for the performers. I find it a bit rude as well not to allow these people who'd offered these intense, blazing performances for three hours of a difficult score, the opportunity to take a bow in our respective living rooms.

There are a bunch of extra features, mini documentaries, and interviews that make this an exceptional DVD purchase for anyone interested in the future of opera. A truly overwhelming operatic experience.",1223510400,84,4649,4.934782608695652
3498609,5,B001BSH18O,"John Adams' ""Doctor Atomic"" is a classic in the making.  Anthony Tommasini of the New York Times calls it ""grimly humane and musically intricate.""  These DVDs were recorded at the Netherlands Opera in June 2007, in a co-production with the San Francisco Opera (which premiered the work in October 2005) and the Lyric Opera of Chicago. The Met staged and recorded ""Doctor Atomic"" in October 2008. New Yorker critic Alex Ross has written a highly informative article about ""Doctor Atomic,"" which can be found on his website, therestisnoise.com.

The cast of this video largely duplicates that of the premiere--
J. Robert Oppenheimer: Gerald Finley
Kitty Oppenheimer: Jessica Rivera
General Leslie Groves: Eric Owens
Edward Teller: Richard Paul Fink
Jack Hubbard: James Maddalena
Robert Wilson: Thomas Glenn
Captain James Nolan: Jay Hunter Morris
Pasqualita: Ellen Rabiner
Musical Director: Lawrence Renes
Stage Director: Peter Sellars
Finley, Owens, and Fink will also appear in the Met production. The DVD includes a detailed, helpful synopsis of the plot and an interview with director Peter Sellars.

The opera focuses on the personal and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters preceding the first atomic bomb test in New Mexico in 1945.  Sellars prepared the libretto for the opera, which is compiled from various sources, including writings of atomic scientists and government officials; poetry by Baudelaire, John Donne,and Muriel Rukeyser; and the Bhagavad Gita. The result is profoundly thought-provoking and moving.  Adams' music always fits the texts, whether scientific, political, romantic, or philosophical.  The choreography features the gestures that we have come to expect from Sellars (although less distracting than in, say, his production of Handel's Theodora).  The video ""refines yet further the director's vision,"" writes Ross, ""with close-ups giving emotional focus to those whirling tableaux""  The singing and acting are first-rate.  Overall, the production and its recording are musically and dramatically riveting.

The Met's production, directed by Penny Woolcock, is new and different but lacks the urgency of Sellars' original.  My recommendation is to buy this recording right away.",1219968000,43,2212,5.60960960960961

3498611,5,B001BSH18O,"DOCTOR ATOMIC is a timely work of art that is at once crucial on both an artistic and a societal level. Adams's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a contemporary Faust character is perhaps more felicitous today than had the opera been written in 1946. While the connate drama associated with the idea of an atomic bomb is certainly obvious and embedded in the production, Adams and Peter Sellars (the librettist and director) ingeniously focus their dramatic attentions to the human drama of the characters at hand that is only natural given their participation in such a morally-rooted dilemma. As the opera progresses, the audience becomes witness to the emotional and intellectual struggles Oppenheimer endures as he tries to rationalize his scientific agenda with his moral obligations.

Act I ends with Oppenheimer's heart-wrenching aria (""Batter my heart three-personed God..."") that is a setting of one of John Donne's Holy Sonnets. It is with this aria that Adams most definitely makes an allusion to the historic Faust legend of a man who sells his soul to the devil in order to gain knowledge (""...but I am betrothed unto your enemy...""). Not only is Adams's setting of the text impeccable, but Gerald Finley's delivery and performance are among the greatest operatic achievements in  perhaps all of music history. Adams mirrors this aria in Act I with a less-powerful but arguably more haunting aria for Oppenheimer (""To what benevolent demon do I owe the joy of being thus surrounded?"")

Other highlights include the Act I, Scene II bedroom scene in which Oppenheimer and his wife, Kitty, make love to one another by reciting the poetry of Charles Boudelaire, and the transcendental arias for Kitty's maid, Pasqualita, which are sung very convincingly by the powerful contralto of Ellen Rabiner. And, of course, one cannot forget to mention the nebulous finale, which, with its clock-like pulses and inconclusive culmination, leaves observers both stunned and deep in thought as the voice of an ambiguous Japanese woman (feebly asking for a glass of water) fades into the silence of reality.

With DOCTOR ATOMIC, John Adams has created what is arguably the first important opera in the twenty-first century. In reading the other reviews that have been posted, I am somewhat discouraged to find that people are still categorizing Adams's music as minimalist and lacking of melodic or harmonic fluency. While it would certainly be foolish to argue that Adams has never written ""minimal"" scores, it is just as foolish to place that label on any of his works reaching as far back as NIXON IN CHINA. While motor-rhythms and repetition still permeate the music, Adams has also unearthed a new harmonic palette, that (in spite of not being ""traditional"") is both imaginatively novel and intrinsically functional. Even more conspicuous is Adams's obvious gift for melody. He has discovered a lyricism that is at once haunting and challenging, yet (to refute one previous reviewer) completely memorable and indelible enough that I often find myself humming the melodies from this opera quite frequently.",1247443200,4,3109,5.162698412698413
3498612,4,B001BSH18O,"The reviews already posted for ""Doctor Atomic"" are some of the most thoughtful, fascinating and, in some cases, hilarious I have ever read on Amazon.  Can I add anything of value to what they've said?  I shall attempt to do so.

First of all, even in the standard DVD format, this is a demonstration-quality disc.  Sitting in front of my eight-and-a-half inch portable DVD player with speakers that leave much to be desired, I felt as though I was in the opera house.  The music was reproduced loudly, clearly and with amazing directionality.  I can only imagine what an overwhelming experience this disc must be played on a high-quality home theater system.

As for the opera itself, Adams is my favorite currently active opera composer, and while ""Doctor Atomic"" is in some ways the least satisfying of his three grand operas, it is still a work of the highest artistic caliber, worthy of serious consideration and multiple viewings and hearings.  Like some other reviewers, I was left unsatisfied by the balance of views presented in the work.  Despite being a liberal Democrat, Adams presented us with a profoundly sympathetic, almost loveable ""Nixon in China"", and the alleged pro-Palestinian bias of ""The Death of Klinghoffer"" is largely redressed by Marilyn Klinghoffer's anguished final aria.  In ""Doctor Atomic"", however, the only halfway convincing statement of a pro-bombing viewpoint is the poetic concept of ""fierce peace"" to which both Oppenheimers refer several times.  I find this forgiveable, however, since in this case Adams and Sellers clearly felt so strongly about the issue that any attempt on their part to present ""the other side"" would probably have been highly unconvincing, and only weakened the opera.  Similarly, while the opera's ending is depressing and somewhat underwhelming musically, it's hard to see how else the work could have appropriately ended, since the unimaginable tragedy of Hiroshima did need to be acknowledged.

Concerning the Oppenheimers singing Christian poetry such as ""Batter my heart, three-person'd God"", I think criticism of this on the grounds that Oppenheimer was Jewish reflects a troubling modern mindset that people should not be open to the beauty and significance of the artistic and cultural expressions of faiths other than their own.  After all, the majority of ""Doctor Atomic""'s audience is not Hindu, and yet Adams and Sellers expect the audience to be affected by the poetic power and relevance of the passage from the ""Bhagavad-Gita"" (the vision of Vishnu the Destroyer) sung by the chorus in the opera's second act.  Why, then, could J. Robert Oppenheimer not have found beauty and meaning in the John Donne sonnet?  As a non-observant Jewish man, what the opera's Oppenheimer means by ""three-person'd God"" is, surely, ""the God whom I am not sure exists, and whom Donne thought of as a Trinity"".

The staging of Oppenheimer's aria is interesting in that, when I first saw it, I thought it was rather over-the-top, and might have seemed so even in the opera house, and yet it is the moment that most strongly sticks with me as I look back upon the opera.  Perhaps Peter Sellers knew what he was doing after all.  Certainly he clearly put a great deal of thought into his often bizarre-seeming video direction of this DVD, and I think that even his most unexpected choices will reward analysis and reflection on why precisely he chose to shoot something a certain way (for example, the rack focus from the sleeping Kitty to the Indian throw beside her face on her couch).

This DVD is definitely recommended to anyone interested in modern opera.  Even if one is ultimately unconvinced by some aspects of Sellers' production, it is an indispensable historic document.",1247097600,3,3736,5.042276422764227
3498613,3,B001BSH18O,"Adams is generally considered the third in the trivium of successful 'minimalist' composers in America, as he has failed to attract a significant cult following on the scale of either Philip Glass or Steve Reich.  This is probably due to the lack of a signature musical style that is immediatley identifiable, which is simultaneously an artistic virtue and a commercial liability.  In DOCTOR ATOMIC, Adams has abandoned his usual eliptical sound patterns in favor of a more direct approach that echoes the emphatic percussive idioms of Glass and Reich.  This makes for a listening experience that is less complicated that Adams' previous works, but far more compelling.  The aria 'Batter my Heart' sung by Oppenheim is the highlight of the work, and clearly owes a debt to the calculated dynamo of Glass pieces like ITAIPU and AKENATEN.  This opera represents a departure from dogmatic minimalism, and in that sense reflects the progression of other minimalists who owe their commercial success to their gradual drift towards recycled nineteenth century romanticism.  It's what people want to hear.",1241827200,2,1098,5.2457142857142856
3498614,4,B001BSH18O,"It was recommended that I spend a night with this modern opera, after which I would have developed a new language.  I did.  Hours well spent.  A side bonus is finer understanding of people I know that are the children of the scientists.",1234483200,2,236,4.441860465116279
3498615,3,B001BSH18O,"Here are the positives:  a very nice dvd, fine sets, a lovely libretto, very enjoyable orchestration, and very good singing for the most part.  The tenor was slightly weak, but all the other singers were extremely good and enjoyable.  What ruins it all for me, is the generally ugly, repetitive and dull vocal line.  Don't get me wrong - there were some magical moments where it appeared Adams really took care with the vocal melody and it was very lovely but these moments were way too few and far between - it seemed for the most part he just quickly jotted down tons and tons of recitative as fast as he could.  I found it very annoying, and I was longing for more great material for these terrific singers all through the show.  If the vocal line were more polished, I would definitely have said Adams achieved a masterpiece, but the lack of it, when everything else was so lovely, left me very disappointed.",1231286400,6,912,4.530487804878049
3498616,1,B001BSH18O,"All right, I'm not a fan of Adams' music: it's hard to make minimalist music reach very far, which comes down to saying that harmonic stretch is the essence of what makes western classical music work.  There might be some disagreement there, which is fine with me.

What bothers me is what bothers me about Adams' other political (""political"") operas: he deals with controversial subject matter and then pretends that it's not controversial because he's ""seeing all sides.""  This allows him the intellectually dishonest freedom to both ""do"" the story and not do the story: he tells the story and then refuses to deal with the simple fact that these stories deal with moral rights and wrongs.  If Tom Ferrell is right and we've got still another ""America does someone dirty"" piece of left-wing claptrap, then that makes my point about Adams right there.  On the other hand, Nixon in China, eg. and also the opera that ""gave a chance"" to muslim terrorists to tell us all about their version of why they kill people from ""their own authentic viewpoint"": both of these both [...]-foot around in pursuit of the most squishy of squishy leftist peacemongering while at the same time pretending to taking the high road and turning ""serious"" human situations into ""great art"" (Adams?  Great art? Please.), thereby giving their treatments the factitious appearance of profound, sensitive, perceptive (etc. etc.) insight into ""the human struggle.""

3498617,4,B001BSH18O,"Is the music larger than the production? This is a very powerful work. Almost a horror story but unfortunately the horrible bomb is all too real. The production by librettist and collaborator Peter Sellars is powerful. The story is the creation of the first atomic bomb, and its creator Dr Oppenheimer is the protagonist. Doctor Atomic is must seeing for Gerald Finley alone. This is an awesome performance. He nails the character perfectly. And of course his singing is exemplary as usual. The other singers compliment him very well.
  But the question boils down to the music. Is it more than the production? It will be interesting to see how it fares with a new production such as the MET just put on. There are a few arioso sections but not built on melody. Everything is recitative - perhsps influenced by Monteverdi. The music serves the text admirably in its frightening noises - especially when evoking the terror of the bomb. But you certainly won't be humming anything on the way out. Unlike serialism it is not hard to take. But it is quite dry and I wonder if the recitative might be better replaced by talking over the orchestra. It certainly must have been tiring to sing.",1230249600,3,1186,4.697115384615385

This opera could have been filmed in an 8 x 12 foot room.  No sense of space exists.  DAS BOOT had more wide shots. Even the dance sequences, by famed choreographer Lucinda Childs, are shown in half body, never in full ensamble.  There were close-ups that showed only an EYE, full screen.  The average cut away was about every two seconds.  The camera never lingered on a singer for more than a second or two.  The fine chorus  was shown, guess what, as only full face individuals. Gerald Finley was excellent, but did we have to see him in extreme close-up ALL THE TIME.  Paul Newman he's not.  We have scene after scene of Kitty Openheimer SLEEPING in close-up. There is even a close-up of a plastic baby doll.

3498619,3,B001BSH18O,"When a local theater subscribed to the Metropolitan Opera's HD LIVE series and broadcast DR. ATOMIC on November 8th, 2008 I decided I shouldn't miss it.  I'm not a fan of Adams, but the subject matter is so important, and it had been brought to my doorstep...

DR. ATOMIC has its moments.  The first act builds up to a tremendous aria, Gerald Finley singing ""Batter My Heart,"" one of the Holy Sonnets of John Donne, as the character of Robert Oppenheimer.  The first scene is the assembled throng of Manhattan Project workers.  I was decidedly underwhelmed.  The second scene is a love scene with Oppenheimer and his wife Kitty -- much better, with Finley in fine form.  Then back to the bomb, with the test blast impending and a rainstorm, building tension.  Finally, the Faustian scene with Oppenheimer singing to God.  The problem with this is that Oppenheimer was Jewish, and not observant.  Yes, he did in fact use Donne's sonnet for the name of the Trinity Test Site in southern New Mexico, but this discrepancy undercut the power of the most powerful scene in DR. ATOMIC for me.

The second act I found to be poorly conceived.  The weather and the delay in the test, which took place July 16th, 1945, drives the action, which strikes me as a small and mundane aspect of such a literally earth-shattering series of events.  The best part of Act II is Kitty, who in real life was a committed leftist and opponent of the Project, and who in the opera symbolizes the human conscience as well as the archetypal Woman standing against the deadly plans of the men, generals and scientists alike.  I was not at all convinced by the addition of a Noble Savage role for the Indian maid Pasqualita and a gallery of impassive male Indians in full regalia.  The ending is weak, with a pointed message about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, yes, (148,000 people were killed immediately by the only two atomic bombs ever to have been used in war, and 340,000 including those killed later by radiation poisoning and other effects), but not nearly as effective musically and dramatically as the ending of Act I.

Of course the Met's production is not the same original Peter Sellars staging as in this DVD of the Netherlands Opera.  I haven't stressed those details, only the basic plot elements.  Finley continues in his role as Oppenheimer -- he has sung the part in every production so far, in San Francisco, Amsterdam, Chicago and New York.

As far as Adams's position as a leading American composer, I remain underwhelmed.  Minimalism has become merely one element in his eclectic but tonal style, now a sort of audience-friendly PoMo Lite, an acceptable badge of hipness, and Adams continually strives to be a contemporary composer for those who don't like New Music.",1226793600,10,2754,4.745798319327731

""Klinghoffer"" seemed more of an oratorio, musically dense and opaque to me.  ""Dr Atomic"" I would place somewhere between the two.  No doubt I'm a philistine, but the music is not as memorable as that of ""Nixon in China,"" which I often go back to.  On the other hand, I enjoyed it more than ""Klinghoffer.""",1375056000,2,423,4.5131578947368425
8284600,2,B001BSH18O,"I watched the DVD special edition and have to say that I was overall very disappointed.  The subject idea was great, the execution excellently performed, but the overall text and music was pretty terrible. It drags on far too long, and then almost completely flubs the ending.  It mixes decades worth of events all together like a soup and incorrectly implies many things that weren't know till decades later were known and planned by the creators.  As someone that has studied the historical events and read the actual documents, this opera dangerously misrepresents the events and struggles of the first bomb test.  My fear is people will see this and then think they believe they 'understand' what happened.

The scores were *entirely* too wordy.  As someone who knows the science, I felt it had been sprinkled full of technological words that I don't think the authors understood. How? There was too much overly dramatic scoring on parts of conversations that didn't matter and none on the ones that should have.  Singing about icosahedral arrangement of detonators was nearly comical in an opera that's supposed to explore the emotional space of these events. People laughed in the showing I saw.

The disjointed telling doesn't help most of the time.  It felt like someone found a pile of letters and anecdotes from the events, mixed them around and just read them out loud.  Some are given too much emphasis, while others not enough.  Deeply scientific topics nearly in the same sentence as moral and personal ones when the actual events and people involved were years apart.  Huge scenes are spent on what was relatively minor historial points, while not enough was spent on some of the truly groundbreaking.  The huge scene about the weather was a great example of what should not have gone on so long.  Ending in an aria about a diet and not eating chocolate cake?

Instead, it would have been great to tell the *themes* together with more clear direction between them.  There was a whole line of scientific work being done (can we do it) and a very separate, and parallel line of the morality (should we do it) and political/military attempts to make those choices.  A much better telling would be to show the problems as they were encountered and overcome interspersed with the moral questions those discoveries brought up in concert so one could understand why the different protests and interal struggles came up.  Instead, we have mixes of all themes together, topics that didn't come up till DECADES after the events, and makes it nearly impossible to empathize with the struggles of the characters. Honestly, it feels like Adams and Sellars didn't even TALK to anyone that knew what was going on and just sort of arrogantly tried to write this without trying to understand.

The choreography was excellently performed, but too distracting most of the time.  There were far too many people moving around in the background that did more to distract from the story than add to it.  Again, long stretch are spent on scenes that should be cut to just a few moments, and vice-versa.  It's just another sign to me that Adams and Sellars didn't really understand their subject matter.

Regardless of which side of this you stand on, I do not recommend opera if they wish to understand the scientific, moral, or emotional impact of these events in the least.  Honestly, if you think this opera even remotely conveys the truth of the topic - I've become very scared for our dialog on the subject.  Picking up a good historical book on the subject with the real documents quoted would do you eternally better.",1332028800,,3615,4.839024390243902
8284601,5,B001BSH18O,"It's a scary time for the scientists in Los Alamos, New Mexico.  They are close to finishing a project that no one really knows whether it will end well or not.  John Adams, admittedly not one of my favorite composers, has captured the anxiety, tension and confusion of this time and place with remarkable accuracy. (He had access to some of the, until now, classified material from that time.)  The music drives the scenes with a relentlessness that matches what is being worked on.  Time flows like a current that cannot be opposed and the characters each respond in their ideosyncratic ways.  This is a piece of American history that needs more exposure.  A recently-made documentary ""Gate"" (pronounced 'gah-tay') shows an ending for the situation of the opera that is well worth considering as a companion piece for this work.  Both are well worth adding to the collection of anyone interested in finding out what led up to the flight of the 'Enola Gay.""",1301184000,2,958,4.804878048780488

8284603,5,B001BSH18O,"We are dealing her with a highly political subject and opera. We are dealing here with the scientists who invented, tested and then supervised the use of the first atom bomb ever produced, tested and used in the world. The main character is thus Oppenheimer himself with a couple of his colleagues and the military personnel that is following the project. We are after the victory over Germany and before the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that will bring the surrender of Japan, or should I say precede Japan's surrender that was expected any time before the bombs were dropped. The opera only considers the stakes and ethical questions of the scientists themselves. The fact that the use of these atom bombs will bring the Cold War is not even considered, it is even hinted at as being a common project with the Soviet Union, which is totally false. It was a unilateral action of the US that could have been avoided politically and militarily because it was purely useless: the victory and the surrender of Japan was only a question of days.

Even so this opera is strongly anti-military and anti-atomic from the purely scientific point of view. Ethics are here and there alluded to, especially by second zone scientists, not the top ones, but it is only anecdotes more than real facts and actions. The opera's libretto is supposed to have been written from authentic documents, and it contains a lot of literary quotations. This implies the positions defended by the two top scientists and the top general in this case are supposed to be authentic, in spite of the numerous and long literary quotations that are set in Oppenheimer's mouth. The anti-war and anti-atomic meaning of the opera is not really expressed as such, but can be derived from what is being said, because it may freeze our blood in our own veins.

First of all the chorus opening the opera is scientifically fundamental.

""Matter can be neither created nor destroyed but only altered in form."" . . . ""Energy can be neither created nor destroyed but only altered in form. But now we know that matter may become energy and thus be altered in form.""

It was known before since Einstein had proposed it as a theory. But the atomic research, today known as nuclear research, proved it. All is energy and energy is material by essence. It is the volatile and flexible form of matter and matter is nothing but an assemblage of energy. This is frightening because it states there was no creation, hence no possible god or other event that would have brought the world into existence from nothing. This is frightening because everything in the world being matter and energy and the former being only a particular form of the latter we are nothing but an assemblage of energy particles. That brings up the fundamental principle of Buddhism: we are part of cosmic energy and our material existence is nothing but a transient condensation of this energy in our evanescent body and being. No divine soul, nothing stable and long-lasting in us, nothing but unstable energy that can be released or can release itself eventually. Life is not our essence, death is and life is nothing but a short suspension of that death thanks to the condensation of a certain amount of energy into our likeness we call our body or our mind, and death is only the point when and where the enrgy that composes our body is restructured, naturally altered in form. Religion is totally side-tracked and even science is marginalized. The scientist is a sorcerer's apprentice playing with some natural criteria and parameters that we cannot control. At best, maybe, we can manage them so that we do not get burnt up or destroyed by our tinkering about.

We are not then surprised by what Oppenheimer says about the soul:

""The soul is a thing so impalpable, so often useless, and sometimes so embarrassing that at this loss [the loss of human conscience due to the work on this humanity-negating nuclear energy] I felt only a little more emotion than if, during a walk, I had lost my visiting card.""

We are beyond the negation of God. We have reached here the reduction of the divine soul to some kind of ethical essence that is anyway nothing at all and practically rejected by Oppenheimer. To do what he or they is or are doing he or they must have no soul whatsoever. When the scientist who is second in command says that they should speak up and try to influence the politicians who are making the decisions how to use this atomic power he is rebutted by Oppenheimer in the most condescending way possible:

""The nation's fate should be left in the hands of the best men in Washington.""

Who says they are the best men? And the principles of the use of this atomic power in Japan are simple:

"". . . Psychological factors in selecting the targets are of great importance. . . We cannot give the Japanese any warning. . . Doctor Conant suggests a vital war plant is the most desirable target, employing a large number of workers and closely surrounded by worker's houses. . . Several strikes would be feasible. . . The more decisive a weapon is the more surely it will be used, and no agreement will help. Would we have started the atomic age with clean hands?""

Then everything has been said and the only words that can be used here are cynicism, hypocrisy, unconsciousness, vanity and of course thirst and hunger for power and prestige, even if criminal. The attitude of the General is typical: he wants to command the weather, order nature to do what he wants and abide by his law, or diktat. And this libretto is nearly nice on the subject because it does not speak of the time when the bomb must be dropped, which is early enough in the morning to catch the workers going to work and the children going to school to make sure the casualties are essentially innocent and totally non military by definition, even if they work in some military factories, though children do not. Civilian victims are not even collateral. They are the target. We are dealing here with a crime against humanity and it necessarily feeds the thirst and hunger for authority in many men.

Then the wrapping it up in Oppenheimer's wife's pangs of conscience is useless since she has no say in what is happening. Her husband neither by the way. The attitude of some disagreeing scientists like Wilson in the opera is just vain and useless, if not hypocritical, since they know security would stop their petition before it even entered the oval office or penetrate the White House. And we have nothing to say about Oppenheimer himself and his near nervous breakdown during the count down for the test. Do not even mention the cynical Teller, second in command in the scientific team, who is just up-handedly brandishing some negative arguments as his taste for black humor allows him to make fun of everything. Cynicism and foolishness are the main two characters of these people. Note the fact that humanity will always do what it can do, no matter how criminal or dangerous it may be, is not really questioned and anyway if Americans did not do it, Germans would do it, or the Japanese, or Russians. There is in this opera a fatality in history: always will human beings invent new weapons that will always have to be more and more destructive.

The conclusion comes from Oppenheimer who does not speak in his own words but quote a sonnet by John Donne. He addresses a plea to ""three-person'd God"" to take him and imprison him because by becoming the prisoner of God he could be freed from God's enemy who he is ""betroth'd to."" This is a vision of absolute dependence, total and final subservience, immense and yet divided obedience.

The only challenge then comes from Oppenheimer's Navajo nurse and maid, Pasqualita, who brings in that bleak picture a more ""natural"" approach. First a lullaby from her culture to put the baby to sleep: the Cloud-Flower Lullaby, one of the Songs of the Tewa translated by Herbert Joseph Spinden and published in 1933. The Tewa are Pueblo Indians, who live on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.

""In the north the cloud-flower blossoms,
And now the lightning flashes,
And now the thunder clashes,
And now the rain comes down!
A-a-aha, a-a-aha, my little one.""

It will be repeated four times. The full stanza for the west, next the south, and finally the east, but in this last case Pasqualita will be interrupted after two lines.

Then Pasqualita will quote part of the eighth elegy, from the 1949 volume ""Eligies"" by Muriel Rukeyser, which is an evocation of the dead during the WWII, and their possible return that will never happen (being sung by Pasqualita we could think it means the Indians who were killed during the Indian wars and the Indian genocide):

""Then word came from a runner, a stranger:
""They are dancing to bring the dead back, in the mountains.""
We danced at an autumn fire, we danced the old hate and change,
The coming again of our leaders. But they did not come.

The winter dawned, but the dead did not come back.
News came on the frost, ""The dead are on the march!""
We danced in prison to a winter music,
Many we loved began to dream of the dead.
They made no promises, we never dreamed a threat.
And the dreams spread.

In the summer dreaming was common to all of us,
The drumbeat hope, the bursting heart of wish,
Music to bind us as the visions streamed
And midnight brightened to belief.
In the morning we told our dreams.
They all were the same dream.""

This is of course the evocation of World War II and the fifty million casualties, and in particular, since Muriel Rukeyser is Jewish, the fate of the Jews in the Shoah. They were gone and they did not come back. They were taken beyond the gate of light that casts no shade and they never came back.

The only solace or support Oppenheimer can find in his situation is an evocation of Vishnu, the Preserver in the Hindu trinity, who is brought forward by the chorus in a translation that seems personal. We have to keep in mind Oppenheimer studied Sanskrit in 1933, and the ""Baghavad Gt"" in particular. He declared to Christian Century Magazine in 1963:

""The general notions about human understanding... which are illustrated by discoveries in atomic physics are not in the nature of things wholly unfamiliar, wholly unheard of or new. Even in our own culture they have a history, and in Buddhist and Hindu thought a more considerable and central place. What we shall find [in modern physics] is an exemplification, an encouragement, and a refinement of old wisdom.""

But the quotation the ""Baghavad Gt"" sounds like a very poor solace and a deep anguish if not fear in front of the imminent first explosion of this bomb:

""At the sight of this, your Shape stupendous,
Full of mouths and eyes, feet, thighs and bellies,
Terrible with fangs, O master,
All the worlds are fear-struck, even just as I am.
When I see you, Vishnu, omnipresent,
Shouldering the sky, in hues of rainbow,
With your mouths agape and flame-eyes staring--
All my peace is gone; my heart is troubled.""
(""Baghavad Gt"" Chapter 11, verses 23 & 24)

The end of the opera is situated in the text two minutes before the test. But the opera in this stage production is slightly different.

We can know shift to the music and the stage production.

The opera divides the stage in three spaces: in the foreground Oppenheimer's home with one night scene with his wife in bed first: a scene that was supposed to be sentimental if not erotic and that turns into some very distantly metaphorical evocation of sensuous pleasures centered on perfumes, the perfumes he finds in his wife's hair and that evoke fruit, foliage and human skin. But he was working on some document at the beginning, he stopped for a short while and he interrupted this sentimental drift to go back to his bomb. Then that private space will be occupied by Kitty Oppenheimer, her infant daughter in a cradle, the Navajo nurse and later three helpers for that nurse. Two short incursions of Peter Oppenheimer, their son can be noted. This private space is centered on the baby and the five women are only there to take care of her.

In a middle stripe on the stage we have the labs and the bomb with two types of personnel, the scientists on one side and then the military people who are managing the first test of this bomb with the scientists, and also trying to manage the weather and the scientists.

Further back, hence in the background of the stage we have an open space where dancers intervene very often, most of the time six dancing on a circle, and once four dancing on parallel lines running from left to right. Personally I do not see what these dancers are bringing to the opera, except that they are dancing in circles like the scientists and the soldiers who are activating themselves, running in circles mostly after their own tails like Chopin's Little Dog Waltz.

Then the back of the stage is most of the time cut in two layers, a top layer that is black and a layer between that top layer and the back line of the stage that is used for light. It is often white, but can be blue or red according to the scenes.

Thus the stage is visually putting one on top of the other five layers from the foreground to the top of the backdrop. This is very interesting for the DVD because cameras can shift from one layer to the next and concentrate or zoom in onto one section of these layers, on one face, one character. We practically never have a full vision of the stage, which is kind of frustrating.

The music is essentially some accompanying music behind the singing. The singing itself having to be clearly understood because of the pregnancy of the text is more chanted than sung. There are very few instances when the singing has any kind of musical complication. At times it is even slightly humdrum. But then the music behind and in-between two sentences can be rich and impressive but always of the accompanying type used to amplify the meaning of the words.

The singing emphasizes some words or phrases by repeating them and such repetitions are never gratuitous and are most of the time triple repetition or a triple simple repetition with a fourth one that is one word longer, or one word shorter. This pattern of four being clearly three plus one is an echo to John Donne's ""three-personed God"" and this Christian reference is important because then the extension to four is necessarily the extension to the crucifixion. This is a direct allusion to these scientists who are probably very religious in their common life (saying graces at every meal, going to church every Sunday, etc) and yet their very activity is making them the agent of the devil, ""your enemy"" in Donne's words. Donne's richness is not entirely used. For example the last five lines of the sonnet are very rich in this symbolical way:

""But am betroth'd to your enemy (A),
Divorce me (1), untie (2), or break that knot again (3),
Take me to you (4), imprison me (5), for I
Except (B) you enthrall me (6), never shall be free (C),
Nor ever chaste (D), except (E) you ravish me (7).""

The enemy is A-B-C-D-E, hence a pentacle, the devil of course. God is asked to do seven things hence the holy week that ends we must keep in mind on the crucifixion and the resurrection. The crucifixion is carried by the four negatives B-C-D-E- within the pentacle of the devil. And the seven requests to God plus the five attachments to the devil make twelve and there we are whole again since it is the number of the Last Supper's participants, once Judas, the supposed traitor is gone.

In fact in the first scene of the second act Kitty in a long poem by Muriel Rukeyser introduces Jesus:

"". . . This earth-long day
Between blood and resurrection where we wait
Remembering sun, seed, fire; remembering
That fierce Judaean Innocent who risked
Every immortal meaning on one life.""

Jesus, the Judaean Innocent is captured in our memories between blood and resurrection, the crucifixion on the Friday afternoon (death at the ninth hour) and the resurrection on the Sunday morning.

The music thus puts up this drama. We could say a lot more.

A last remark. The opera starts with black and white images of war scenes, desolation, dead people, bombings, and it ends with the color vision of all the actors and singers lying on their stomach on the ground while the sound tracks gives us some Japanese remarks from people after a bombing looking for help of for relatives, and these Japanese sentences are duly translated in English for us to see the meaning, at least on the DVD. Before we had simple bombings and after the test shown on the stage it will be the next generation of bombings, the atomic generation and the desolation of survivors. War is a cycle from one battle to the next and it never stops.

This opera is not a call for peace. It is a pessimistic call for the end of that ever going war process that is human by essence and we know it will never end.

And it may live for generations in our modern universe because of the Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome it may build in the survivors and the descendants of the survivors, be it only in the morbid celebrations of the ""victories"" that were never that glorious, due to the horror committed by the victors during the war, and these horrors were often just as horrible as those committed by the defeated ones. Is Coventry in any way worse than Dresden, Pearl Harbor than Hiroshima?

8284604,5,B001BSH18O,"As far as I am concerned John Adams and Peter Sellers are  THE most important creators of total theater in this young century.  Adams' music is breathtaking, and Seller's libretto and direction are beyond compare.  Why is it a flawed masterpiece?  The dancing, which helped at first and then became distracting. And, after the Vishnu episode, which should have introduced the explosion, one had to wait forty five minutes of wasted time (and wasted, gorgeous music) for it to take place . . . and it fizzled. But Findlay's rendition of Donne's poem must be the most dramatic moment of my operatic life.  So what if, as one reviewer said,Oppenheimer was Jewish? Jews feel the burden of submission to their Sadistic God just as Christians do. I played it twice and howled in pain throughout.  One last thing.  Those wide eyes, making the singers look like lemurs. On the other hand, I was could share their visions!  What absolutely magnificent singing of a most difficult score!

8284606,4,B001BSH18O,"Mesmerized by the fascinating very recent documentary on the making of this opera, called ""Wonders Are Many"" and aired recently on PBS, I was more than happy to sit down and watch the entire opera, from the Met, on TV -- starring Gerald Finley.

In case you don't know, ""Doctor Atomic"" is the story of physicist Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project -- that is, the building of the first atomic bomb, in seclusion in New Mexico in the 1940s. The opera follows Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists and aides and their families, holed up in close and distressing quarters, working under great pressure and often filled with moral misgivings about what they were doing yet at the same time rushed by high-level U.S. government officials to complete, test, and roll out the finished product, no matter what.

As you might imagine, the opera is fascinating. Adams' music is, well, certainly up to one's expectations of him, and certainly if you like his other stuff, including the fascinating and groundbreaking Nixon in China, you'll like this.

The libretto, written by Peter Sellars, is also a tour-de-force. It's based on a multitude of sources, including documents and literature. The result is a collage of poetry (Oppenheimer himself was inordinately fond of poetry, and as a young man considered that as a career option), history, biography, and philosophy. In addition to the historical documents and letters, Sellars uses abundant quotations from the Bhagavad Gita, and from the poetry of John Donne, Charles Baudelaire, and Muriel Rukeyser. The result is a mixture of fact and imagery that dazzles, but can occasionally be befuddling.

Excellent notes on the Libretto are found on the Metropolitan Opera's official site. Click: Watch & Listen > Saturday Matin&eacute;e Broadcasts > All Operas. [EDIT, 2012: Well, wouldn't you know it; the Met has decimated their website and removed all the helpful info pages. So see if you can find info on the libretto elsewhere.]

Things I liked: The singing was first rate (and that's saying a lot, as the music is quite difficult).

The sets and staging/direction (and even the costuming and makeup) were spectacular -- some of the best and most evocative I've ever seen. And extremely creative, yet always in the service of the story, never detracting from it.

The music was, as mentioned, fascinating, especially during certain sequences like the very end.

Things I didn't like (don't be put off by my grousing -- I like to analyze things): I think the thing should have been edited a bit, either libretto-wise or music-wise.

Namely:

(1) There's a bedroom sequence in which Oppenheimer muses for a full 7 minutes solely about his wife Kitty's hair. That's when I turned the recording off the first time, and started up again at a later date.

(2) Kitty Oppenheimer has one or two scenes with Oppenheimer, which are fine, but the rest of her scenes are solos, and usually very long ones. That would possibly be fine if what she was singing was germane to the story. However, she sings only abstract images and rootless musings which make little or no sense, at least the way the music has them sung. Bits of Rukheyser's or Baudelaire's poetry are very hard to follow and make any sense at all of, unless the music helps the phrases cohere and relate, and unless the music conveys her state of mind and the point of it all. I was left with the impression that Kitty was losing her grip on reality, which was not the actual case. So, in the end, I don't know if this was a libretto problem or a music problem. I think would have been GREAT if Kitty had sung at least a few sane human sentences, to ground her into reality like Oppenheimer's lines were grounded so effectively. Conclusion: If you see the opera, get acquainted a bit with the sources of the libretto, especially the Rukheyser. See the extensive notes on the Met site, and/or check Wikipedia.

(3) It seemed long to me at three hours, largely because of items (1) and (2) above. I think a little editing could have been in order, as it got slightly repetitive and long. To me, that is.

Upshot: Do see it, or watch the DVD, if you have a chance.

I personally would recommend seeing the fabulous 90-minute ""Making of"" DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonders-Are-Many-The-Making-of-Doctor-Atomic/dp/B001IXXYB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonders Are Many: The Making of ""Doctor Atomic""</a>,  even more than the opera itself!
