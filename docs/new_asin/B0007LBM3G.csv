2216735,4,B0007LBM3G,The content is a fantastic exercise routine. The only flaw is that every time I want to start the exercises I have to wait for all the titles and there is no way of skipping them.,1126569600,6,179,4.0
2216736,5,B0007LBM3G,jane fonda has still got it even better now on dvd great workouts i just wish she had her original workout on dvd her very first workout was brilliant and i would love to get it somehow,1123545600,3,185,4.027027027027027
2216737,5,B0007LBM3G,"The best I ever looked was when I was using this video everyday.  I wouldn't recommend that knowing what I know now.  It is important to know that I've never been past the intermediate level.  I've been using The Complete Workout video for 15 years (since 1990)!

This is a 70 minute workout with an option to break it into 2 segments of 55 minutes, doing a warm-up, upper body, aerobics (30 minutes), and stretches on one day, and aerobics (the same 30 minute segment), lower body, and stretches on the next day.  Abs are included in the lower body workout.

The aerobics section is broken down into High Impact and Low Impact with an instructor demonstrating each at all times during the aerobics section.  This allows you to grow with the video.

The upper body is excellent and all you need are some hand weights preferrably two sets one lighter, 5 lbs. maybe, and one heavier, 8 lbs., for an average person.  Some of the upper body exercises will be more beneficial with heavier weights.

The lower body is also an excellent workout.  You may want a mat for the lower body work if you do not have carpet.

All exercises can be done with or without weights, and you can add weight to all for increased resistance and a more strenuous workout.

The ab work is challenging enough to take you through the intermediate level.

The Complete Workout uses traditional exercises including: arm raises, bicep curls, shoulder shrugs, push ups (choose on knees or not), leg raises (inner and out thigh), buttock compressors, lunges, sit ups including obliques, and much more.

Jane is the best instructor I've ever seen.  The movements are never rushed, the counts are the same for both sides of the body, and she is great about reminding you of proper form!  The video quality is not amateurish and is of the highest quality.

I can't tell you about the Stress Reduction Program just yet as I have just ordered it with The Complete Workout on DVD - to replace my aging VHS.  I can tell you that you will not be disappointed with The Complete Workout especially if you prefer traditional moves.  You will ""Feel It""!  Speaking of which, I feel $11.68 is good price for 2 workouts that you may never get tired of!  Also, check out The Firm which are highly rated.",1122249600,29,2254,4.5825
2216738,2,B0007LBM3G,"I LOVED Jane's original workout (now out of print) and used it for years.  I might still, if it were available on DVD.  But I didn't like any of her subsequent workouts, and about 12 years ago I graduated to The Firm tapes, which are better in a lot of ways and certainly more effective, especially for the upper body.  Still, I wanted to give Jane's workouts a fresh look and thought they might be worth owning for ""lighter"" workout days.  But sorry, this one is too easy -- especially the very low-intensity aerobics -- plus the 1980s perms and tacky outfits are the WORST, and there is too much silly whooping and sound effects from the cast members. On the plus side, Jane does give excellent form pointers, and this is a good intro to weight training if you've never done it before.  So, if you're a beginner and not bothered by whoops and ""Yow, baby""s and jungle-print leotards with matching headbands, you might like this.",1118016000,9,929,4.538922155688622
2216739,5,B0007LBM3G,"When I worked out for lunch in the breakroom today, a new coworker came in to heat up her meal and started doing grapevines with me. ""Can I join you tomorrow?"" she asked. ""This is so fun!"" Yep, I was doing _Complete Workout_.

I have relied on VHS and DVD workouts to keep me in shape for over ten years, but long before I got my first VCR, I had read Jane Fonda's workout book and was doing her workout from a cassette with my friends. Jane was pretty revolutionary back then, telling us that it was OK to be strong and healthy and that not everyone was going to fit into some cookie-cutter mold. Good advice today, too, if you ask me.

These two workout programs are two of my favourites! _The Complete Workout_ gives you an arm workout with weights, then about half an hour of lively and varied aerobics. There are different instructors to show different levels of impact/effort. The last section gives you a good leg workout. There is nothing weird or hard here, just simple fun with a certain amount of effort involved. Jame shows lots of variations and she gives useful tips for effectiveness and safety in the arm and leg toning sections. I have been doing this program off and on for years.

The _Stress Reduction Program_ gives you about 20 minutes of super-simple aerobics. This is the one I go for when I say, ""I'm too tired. I don't feel like working out today."" I tell myself I'll just do the first song. But I have never not finished the 20 minutes. After the aerobics, there's a stretching section that lasts 15 to 20 minutes. It is very relaxing and Jane gives very detailed instruction about what the stretch is supposed to do and how it is supposed to feel. She provides modifications, too. I personally never use the last session, in which Jane does a guided relaxation exercise, although the techniques presented therein I have found useful.

Back when I first began working out, I didn't particularly care about Jane's past or her personal opinions, except as they were related to health and fitness, nor do I now. I am glad the videos are being turned into DVD's. It makes it a lot more convenient and easy to work out with Jane!",1115424000,143,2151,4.493606138107417
2216740,5,B0007LBM3G,"What a fun throw back to the 80s!  You'll get everything in this workout, big hair, belts with leotards (why did you need a belt with a leotard?...who cares it was the 80s!), leg warmers, it's got it all.

This is a very fun, anything but boring workout.  The workout is broken up into two parts.  The first half of the DVD is a weight lifting routine.  Light weights are used and Jane gives great instruction on lifting properly.  The second half of the DVD is the low impact aerobic routine.  There are eight to ten people working out on the DVD with Jane and everyone is enthusiastic and has great energy.  Jane takes turns leading the video with two other women.  This breaks things up nicely and keeps things moving.  One half of the room is doing the workout for beginners and the other side is for more advanced exercisers to follow. This is a fantastic workout for those just beginning to exercise and those who are intermediate and advanced that want to experience a lighter workout.",1114214400,66,992,4.522471910112359
2216741,5,B0007LBM3G,"Really enjoyed this workout DVD.  Jane is wonderful to work out with.  Nothing so strenuous that you can't do (Im 55) but just a fun workout. Now if you only had the money to buy one of these workouts, I'd get the other DVD Complete Personal Trainer , there is a little more to it, and with that other DVD there is a 2 workout with hand weights that is invaluable! as well as the aerobics.  (these DVD's are pretty pricey, but worth it )",1382486400,,437,4.117647058823529
2216742,5,B0007LBM3G,Finally two of my favorite classic Jane Fonda workouts on DVD. Yeah!!! Both are fun and safe. One has a toning /stenghtening section with a great hi/low workout. The othe a shorter 20 minute workout to great music wit a 20 minute yoga style stretch nd 10 min relaxation. these are great for alternating.,1361750400,,303,4.62962962962963
2216743,5,B0007LBM3G,I liked the work out. All of the moves are easily done & they are very effective. Can be done in a small space.,1355011200,,111,3.6666666666666665
2216744,1,B0007LBM3G,"So, I purchased this DVD back in 2008 for the low price of $6.97 as a gift for my mom. My review is not for the quality of this product --which my mom loved so much that the DVD now skips -- my complaint is the ridiculous price of $112.00. I really want to buy my mother this workout DVD because it seems to really help with her back, but there is no way in hell that I'm going to pay this much for a single item.",1338076800,11,413,3.7586206896551726
2216745,5,B0007LBM3G,"I used to work out to all of Jane's workout tapes 20 years ago. Unfortunately all of my workouts are on VHS. I was so happy to see 2 of her old workouts converted to DVD.

They should all be converted to DVD. I would be among the first customers.

While the workouts are more challenging now with age and weight gain. I feel a burst of energy and motivation just being able to do these tapes again. I actually look forward to working out now. The crazy-eighties music and leotards make me crazy in a good way.",1314662400,,509,4.183673469387755

2216747,5,B0007LBM3G,I've had the VHS tape of this workout since the 80's.  I decided I'd best replace it and found this DVD.  It has all the qualities I liked about the VHS tape and much more.  I'm totally satisfied with this product.,1298505600,,214,4.170731707317073
2216748,5,B0007LBM3G,"Years ago, I bought the Stress Reduction Program and loved it. But it was on VHS tape. I was so glad to find it on DVD and as a bonus it has the Complete Workout on it also. I haven't tried that one yet but need to start lifting weights so will try it soon. As for the Stress Reduction part...it has a easy 20 minutes of aerobics which actually is a lot of fun. Then it has a great stretching part which makes you feel so good. The last part is a relaxation part where she walks you through tightening each part of your body then letting it go. A lot of times I didn't do that part because afterwards, my body felt like jello and it was hard to get up off the floor because I was so relaxed. It is fabulous for relaxation!!",1291939200,,723,3.958904109589041

I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS DVD.",1276473600,,84,4.125
2216751,5,B0007LBM3G,"I bought this DVD years ago and have ""done it to death"". It's always great to have Jane in the living room and work out with her and her friends. I have learned to modify some parts as my body is not perfect and I have had surgery on my spine in the last few years. I have tried the gym and walking but still come back to Jane as my favourite. I have recently bought her latest DVD for abs, buns and thighs and appreciate having a new DVD again. I am now 64 years old and Jane still makes my life more enjoyable with her fitness regime.",1271203200,,536,3.926605504587156

2216753,5,B0007LBM3G,"I just started working out again after being lazy and sedentary for TOO many years. I was excited to find that you could still purchase the Jane Fonda workout collection. It does the job in a fun and enjoyable manner. Some things never change...and what works to get one in shape hasn't changed that much. Even though the gals' hair and such look a tad bit out of date (haha), the girls still look FANTASTIC!! Excellent price for the collection. MG in Oklahoma",1266019200,,460,4.554216867469879
2216754,3,B0007LBM3G,I like Jane Fonda workouts but the aerobic routines require a large area. So (if like me) you only have a small living room to work out in you may one to skip this one.,1265760000,4,168,3.8285714285714287
2216755,5,B0007LBM3G,"When I first decided to start working out I was about 13 years old trying to lose that baby fat...my mother bought me Jane Fonda.  I looked at the package and said ""yea right"" but The Complete Workout turned out to be one of the best/most fun workout videos I got!  I recently got the dvd version and again it's wonderful!!

Breakdown:

Upper body:  I found that it is definitely doable using two different sets of weights (light and heavy).  I use 3 & 5 lbs.  Mostly arm raises, curls etc.  She finishes with two sets of pushups.  All of the sets are 10-12 reps so even when it starts to burn you know it will be done soon.  She does about two sets of each move.

Cardio:  THE BEST part of the video.  I honestly find the time flying by!  She offers low-impact and high-impact versions...it's mostly dance-type cardio (60's moves etc) but the steps are fairly easy (you should be able to pick them up by the 3rd time).  They run through about 6 different dances, some that really get you going, some slower ones thrown in to give you a rest.  The girls (and one guy) in the video all appear to have a good time without being over the top which I love...although the outfits are hilariously outdated.

Lower body:  I like that she separates the 3 sections because you do the legs as your heart rate comes down.  Lots of lunges then hitting the floor for leg raises and kicks and finally abs.  The floor moves she does I have seen in almost every gym I have ever belonged to...so 12 years later trainers are still using them!

For the price of this video (and even if it was more expensive) it is definitely worth it.  It's an effective & fun workout.  Not as intense as Jillian or Jari Love but great for a day when you want to get in a feel good workout and have a great time!",1265068800,,1777,4.2388059701492535
2216756,5,B0007LBM3G,"After only a few weeks with this video, and with calorie counting, i have already lost a significant amount of weight and i see more definition in my arms and thighs. The video is encouraging, and jane is so cute! i really always loved jane fonda workouts because they are SAFE and effective, i know i sound like a commercial, but i mean all of it. i just ordered more weights to heighten the intensity. after a while the video steps become easy and it begins to fly bye.",1265068800,2,471,4.303370786516854
2216757,4,B0007LBM3G,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD, first, they make aerobics look really fun, but it's hard to keep up with them. Second, Jane gives good instructions about how to exercise, but it's hard to stay low impact, when most of the people in the DVD are bouncing all over the place (even though they say watch the low impact side of the room). Plus, I have a hard time doing this DVD, because of the carpet in my living room, and limited space (not her fault really). Maybe after a couple of times, it will be easier for me. I give Jane an A+ for enthusiasm and fun presentation, but a low B for making it doable in someone's living room - and I really don't like having to watch high impact and low impact versions of exercise done at the same time. But, try it, if you like aerobics that uses scottish jigs, silly cowboy steps and a lot of hu hawing!",1259539200,3,848,4.176829268292683
2216758,5,B0007LBM3G,"I bought this produdct when it first came out as a vhs.  I liked it SOOOOOOOOOOOO Much, that I bought it again on DVD this time.  It is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fun, and it's easy to learn the steps.  It's a great way to get a fantastic cardiac workout.  It covers upper and lower body and warmups and cool downs.  It just rocks!  You have a choice of both high impact and low impact versions.  I use the aerobics part of the class as a warmup for days when I do the treadmill and lift weights.  It's a must have if you want a FUN workout that won't practically kill you, especially if you have joint problems or are older.  Try it!  You'll like it!",1255219200,,641,4.138211382113822
2216759,5,B0007LBM3G,"I rememeber doing this video in elemetary school with my mom... which was the late 80's early 90's. I used to get mad to know she didn't wake me up in the morning to excersise with her... i was too young to know what dieting was but all I knew is that is was fun!!!! And now in my 20's it still is. Its been 3 weeks and i am getting compliments on my legs, face, stomach, arms... you name. I haven't stepped on a scale yet because in my mind I'm not where i want to be. But when people around you notice you know you are doing something right.

All i do is eat healthier foods and do this workout 5 times a week. thats all you need! GOOD LUCK!!!!",1253836800,,646,3.893939393939394

2216763,3,B0007LBM3G,"I was looking for a different Jane Fonda workout...but this one is kind of fun, actually it has two separate workouts on it and the price wasn't that bad.  To be perfectly honest it is worth its price just to see the outfits and hair from the 80s!!

Because I'm ""a little older now,"" I particularly enjoy the Light Aerobic and Stress Reduction routines on  this DVD: low-impact aerobics and stretches.  Easy on the joints, etc., but not boring.

2216767,5,B0007LBM3G,"I have exercised to practically every workout tape and DVD there is.  However, no one tops Jane Fonda.  She gives a complete workout that will leave you energized and fully worked-out!  She is the top expert on how to really exercise your body while keeping it fun.  I exercised to the original of this VHS tape from 1996 to 2002 and it finally broke.  I just repurchased the workout on DVD and can't believe the results I have had after only one week of working out to it.  My mother is also a HUGE fan and has been exercising to Jane Fonda since 1985!  I highly suggest this video if you want an easy to follow workout that will tone your muscles, foster your cardiovascular health, and be fun all at the same time!!!",1212537600,9,719,4.32089552238806

2216769,5,B0007LBM3G,"If you're looking for Jane's ""Light Aerobics and Stress Reduction Program"" released in 1990 this is the DVD you want. After having tried several other programs on the market I still think this is the best. It's enough to get your heart rate up and break a sweat but not hard on your knees and the steps are easy to learn. I also like the music which is up-tempo but relaxing at the same time. The first set is light aerobics which includes a warm up, two sets of light aerobics and a cool down. This lasts about 20 minutes. The second set is stretching exercises which are great and, I think, important. (Too many programs don't do this and just tell you to 'do some stretching' on your own.) Most of the stretching is done while sitting on the floor so you'll want to do this on a mat or carpet. This lasts about 15 minutes. The last set is a stress reduction exercise which is nice if you can find a quiet room without distractions (such as your dog walking over you or wanting to play fetch!). This lasts about 10 minutes. The DVD makes it easy to skip to any of the sets if you don't have time to do all of them. (I used the term grapevine in the title of this review because it's the name of one of the movements and I think about this every time I hear the word.) Now I bought the DVD for this particular program but there is another one on the DVD which I have watched but haven't tried yet--but want to. It uses weights (dumbbells) and movement and looks like fun and a great way to work in some weight training. I would say the price of the DVD is worth it even if you only use one of the two programs on here.",1204416000,15,1619,4.110410094637224

After doing the DVD, I still absolutely love these workouts. They're a little corny, but they're fun, effective, and you really get a good workout. At the same time you're not so exhausted that you can't stand up by the end. I felt energized and strong after. Of course, it's funny to see how styles have changes, i.e. the HUGE hair and some of the outfits and accessories. So, I got a good chuckle along with a good work out. :)",1182297600,5,704,4.0647482014388485

I've tried countless other videos by such outfits such as Crunch, Self, The Firm, Samba Party, and Billy Blanks and find that Jane is still the queen.  She provides a variety of routines and fitness levels from which to work and she's clear and concise.  However, I think it's just her constant nudging to get better, instead of the yelling or cheering in your face, that really sets her apart.  She challenges you and yet lets you know that it's all right if you're not quite there yet--don't worry, you'll get there.

I love the warm up, and cool down parts, which are so important, and the COMPLETE stretching out section so there are minimal sore muscles next day.  AND, it is a GREAT trip back to the 80s hair-dos and outfits - so fun!  I wish they'd do a reunion video - wouldn't that be fun?

What makes it even worse it that it is obvious these sound effects were DUBBED IN afterward!  You never see anyone actually making those sounds -- in fact, everyone seems to be to busy concentrating on what they are doing to stop and give a ""yee-hah!"" about it.  I also found the big blonde who led the high-impact aerobics to be somewhat fake.  Ride 'em cowboy?!?  It seemed to me that the brunette who led the low-impact aerobics was also mildly irritated at her ""partner's"" over-enthusiasm for aerobics.  Oh well, at least the DVD didn't cost me very much!",1179964800,2,700,4.650406504065041
2216780,5,B0007LBM3G,"I am so thankful that I decided to get this.  I remember doing this TAPE w/my mom when I was younger (she still has them, I just found out today).  The hair styles & clothes made me crack up...not just that it was ridiculous style choices, but that I also remember dressing the part.  The video itself is a great workout.  Work up a good sweat w/the high impact, the weights section is still good (although I don't have ankle weights...do they even sell them anymore?).  More dance like.  Yelps & Ha yelled in the background to keep you going.  How much more fun do you need a video to be?  Gotta get this.",1177632000,2,606,4.254385964912281
2216781,5,B0007LBM3G,"I used some year ago all the Jane Fonda's workout in VHS. Now I am starting with DVD...  as I am not going to any Gym Club for the past 3 years, I decided to come back to Jane...  and I think she is great! You really workout with her!",1173052800,,234,3.66
2216782,5,B0007LBM3G,"No dwarf tossing or sinister trainers in the background like ""Radu"", controlling the Females. No fancy graphics.

Just good old 1980s hair and 1980s music. Cassette players and leg warmers.

I use light hand weights and wrist weights while doing either workout, because I find them too easy otherwise. However, if you use hand weights, don't put them directly above your head in any move.

The dance moves are fairly easy. Just remember that the foot goes back TWICE in Salsa in the first real set.

For me, a great alternative when it's too cold and rainy to run.",1169078400,4,564,4.666666666666667
2216783,5,B0007LBM3G,"This is the best workout 4 me since i was a teenager till now. Coupled with a proper diet,weight loss plus tone body is a cinch. The show's clarity is superb! Must buy!",1168905600,2,168,4.121212121212121
2216784,4,B0007LBM3G,"This is a great low to moderate workout.  It  keeps the waistline in check.  I love the 20 min. stretching segment, really makes you feel good afterwards.  This disc may be old school, but it works.",1155945600,14,198,4.416666666666667
2216785,5,B0007LBM3G,I like the choices available on this DVD. In the beginning when you are not sure of what to do  you can do the light aerobics and then get more of a workout if that works for you. It is easier than going to a gym class which tends to be different every time. Once you learn the routines you can get a good workout every time. Jane is so sweet and encouraging. Nice going.,1151539200,13,371,3.9466666666666668
2216786,5,B0007LBM3G,"This is the best upper body weight training program I have used.  It is focused, thorough and effective.  The upper body is short with  seven exercises the lower body is also short but uses more isometric moves that I modify. This program is great for posture/appearence.  The weight training is so short that there is time for to add your own favorite yoga/pilates moves for shaping.  The aerobics are fun and slightly dancy.  This is my 'go to' tape for ease and effectiveness.",1150070400,10,479,4.710843373493976
2216787,4,B0007LBM3G,"Now I used to be known as a ""choco-holic""; that is, someone who just can't get enough of the brown stuff! I'd tried diets, pills, just about everything until a friend of mine turned me on to this CD.  50 pounds lighter I feel marvelous and each day is a celebration of life.  Jane Fondo takes you through each step and helps you realize that ACTIVITY is the key to physical health and mental clarity.  Now, I don't care what Jane did back in the 1960's.  People say stupid things when their young. I would give it 5 stars, but hey, nothing is perfect!  My advice to you is to buy this excellent set and wonder where the pounds went!",1148428800,10,632,4.233333333333333

Though i stopped 3 years ago and gained some weight afterwards, i m really looking forward to working out with Jane Fonda's fitness videos again now it's on DVD! Don't go wasting money on silly videos that you'll finally end up throwing away! The Jane Fonda Collection is the IN thing!!! I'de give 10 stars if possible!",1148083200,10,480,4.726190476190476

2216790,3,B0007LBM3G,"Right back into the 80s here.  I used to do Jane fonda when I was little with my mom.  I was excited to see it on DVD to try.  Unlike a lot of the newer videos I have.. I really like Jane because she tells you why you're doing what you're doing (ie. she points to the muscle groups.. tells you what they're for... how to know which weights to use).

Compared to videos today-- this ones a bit cheesy ;-) I laughed a lot.  But the workout is still there-- and so is the info.",1131408000,10,474,3.8958333333333335
2216791,3,B0007LBM3G,"I just did this workout for the first time and I spent a lot of time laughing! The first sight of it was the best. The 80's look! Once I got past that it wasn't too bad. Not an intense, strenuous workout by any means, but it was kind of fun to do all these ""old school"" exercises. Just the plain old aerobics, the grapevine & the ponies, I haven't done those in a while. The instructions are a little hard to hear with the ""rockin' music"". There is a separate section for arms, lower body & abs that is again, not the hardest, but better than doing nothing at all I guess! The DVD is not something I would base my whole exercise plan on, but to throw it in maybe once a month for something different won't be so bad. It was just a fun change of pace.",1128988800,10,750,4.006666666666667

I'm having quite the time learning the steps in the aerobics section of the complete workout. Not something I do in front of my husband, although he would find it extremely entertaining to watch my attempts.
