2312371,2,B0009Q0F28,"I can't really give this a review, as I just didn't find it interesting enough to keep watching after the second murder.  Just seemed to be a lot of pretty faces [in a very 80ish way of being pretty], with so little definition given to the 'calendar girls' I couldn't keep them straight.",1420329600,,287,4.415094339622642
2312372,2,B0009Q0F28,"The made for TV movie Calendar Girl Murders features a solid cast, and an attractive assortment of young starlets, as a number of fashion models fall prey to an unknown killer.  Police detective Dan Stoner (Tom Skerritt,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B004RE29T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>) and his team of detectives investigate publisher Richard Trainer (Robert Culp,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Spy/dp/B00IU6HQ4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Spy</a>) and his stable of models, looking for a lead.  Stoner becomes involved with Cassie Bascomb (Sharon Stone,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basic-Instinct/dp/B000O5B4C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basic Instinct</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino/dp/B001EIOOV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino</a>), a former model, who may also be at risk.

Unfortunately, beside a couple of early kills, and a number of gratuitous shots of the models posing for photos, working out, and hanging out in a pool, this murder mystery doesn't have much going for it.  Detective Stoner and his staff don't seem especially competent, and despite being pursued by Sharon Stone's character, the usually low key Skerritt, doesn't bring a lot of energy to his role.  What little action there is, seems forced and routinely executed, even for a TV movie.

The cast features some familiar names for 1984, including Barbara Bosson (asin:B00GSTHCHQ Hill Street Blues), Alan Thicke (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Growing-Pains/dp/B000C6NPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Growing Pains</a>), Rip Taylor, Barbara Parkins, and Meredith MacRae (Petticoat Junction).  Besides soon to be megastar Stone, a youthful Claudia Christian (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babylon-5/dp/B002DUJ9Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babylon 5</a>), and Wendy Kilbourne (Midnight Caller) are among those featured as models.

This is a rather routine effort, but if you are a Prime member who can watch this for free, it might be of interest to see Stone, Christian, and Kilbourne, early on in their careers.",1414886400,,2281,7.679389312977099

2312374,4,B0009Q0F28,"Calendar Girl Murders adds a new twist to serial killing - chronologically by month. Interesting concept and although not a great movie, I found it very intertaining.",1402531200,,166,5.185185185185185
2312375,2,B0009Q0F28,"While watching THE CALENDAR GIRL MURDERS, I noticed two things. Thing #1- Sharon Stone is hotter than the sunny side of Mercury. Thing #2- This movie is almost as exciting as watching blisters heal. It starts out ok, w/ a couple of murders in the first 20 minutes, but soon grinds to a tedious pace. Tom Skerritt (ALIEN, THE DEAD ZONE) isn't bad as the cop on the case. It's just that once Ms. Stone's character appears, the story dives into soap-opera / romance land. It's all about Sharon Stone's character lusting after a married Skerritt. Now, I wouldn't mind so much if this didn't take up about two thirds of the film! Once it got back to the ""action"" I didn't care anymore. Blecch!...  P.S.- It was funny to read the DVD box for this movie (The TRINITY video release) and see that it is rated EM (EXTREMELY MATURE). This is amazing since TCGM contains no blood, nudity, or even a hint of adult language!...",1380412800,3,913,4.5
2312376,3,B0009Q0F28,The quality of this movie is not what I would expect from a movie made this recent.  Sharon Stone is very good.  It's nice to see her in a role where she does not take her clothes off.,1327881600,,184,3.8157894736842106
2312377,1,B0009Q0F28,"This movie is so bad but that's why I stayed with it.  I didn't know Alan Thicke, Tom Skerritt, Robert Culp, and Sharon Stone could make such a colossal bomb of a movie.  From the lousy acting to the terrible soundtrack to the 80's wardrobe this movie won't disappoint those who want to see a bad movie shimmer in its own crappiness.

Would buy it if it was on DVD.",1287360000,,365,4.185714285714286
2312378,1,B0009Q0F28,"I too purchased this from the bargain bin (2 DVD for around $5). I would compare the quality to that of an old worn out VHS tape thats been recorded over far too many times. The acting was ok, but the storyline and the video quality make it hard to watch.",1134777600,9,255,4.019607843137255
2312379,1,B0009Q0F28,"1980s movie and it shows. Sharon Stone and co-stars do a fair job. The dvd video is extremely poor on my copy. It looks like a bootleg but it is not. Story line has been done before and since and is very predictable. I sat through it only because I bought it out of a bargain bin and figured since I paid for it, I might as well watch it all.

Save your money and your time. Pass on this one at any price.",1133913600,6,405,3.8214285714285716

I went back the next day to find out the ending but it did not get any better!  For the second, and last time, I stopped watching!",1441843200,,297,4.175438596491228

2312412,3,B0009Q0F28,"Calendar girls are being murdered, but why and by whom? The why is never satisfactorily explained, but we follow the reluctant homicide detective, Stoner, as he slowly determines the killer's identity. Most viewers will beat him to the solution. There is some suspense, a few twists and a lot of overacting along the way. The plot line is enlivened with action and glitz. This movie provides decent entertainment, but if you want to see first rate police procedurals, try the Inspector Lewis series.",1440288000,,499,5.024096385542169

2312432,3,B0009Q0F28,"Looks like the pilot for a series. All the cliche's are there, the cop who wants to transfer/retire, the over weight Captain who reels him in with one more case. There is the eager young detective, the still trying to get some respect, female detective. But wait there is more,the beautiful, vulnerable girl who needs protection or is she a suspect? The obvious suspect, the rich guy who is hiding something and of course the mysterious suspect that they can't find. All this combines for a  somewhat predictable outcome. There are some stars from T.V. and movies who hit it bigger after this one. It was watchable and in 20 years I may watch it again.",1431993600,,652,4.620689655172414
