4985903,5,B006G7HGRG,I have several of Patti's books in my library so when I saw this video I just knew I had to have it. I actually purchased both of her video sets. This is an excellent companion to her books. She provides a lot of information on the basic construction of cloth dolls and face design.  Patti takes the viewer through a step by step process with each face she creates using several different mediums. Patti includes many amazing dolls from a variety of dollmakers as inspiration for the viewer.  Watching this was like having my best dollmaker friend right in the studio with me! This would be a great resource for any dollmaker from beginner to advanced.  There was one disappointment - the camera shots could have been better when Patti would point out a small detail on a finished doll.,1364860800,2,786,4.560283687943262
4985904,5,B006G7HGRG,"How wonderful to have this DVD to show me the needed design details, not just the pictures & illustrations in Patti Medaris Culea's books.",1364601600,,138,4.791666666666667
4985905,5,B006G7HGRG,I have been a doll maker for over 35 years and have seldom been able to find a class that either worked with my schedule or my pocketbook. I first watched this video in my sewing room while creating a giraffe for my granddaughter.  I found myself still watching it after I was done sewing for the day. It was as if Patti Medaris Culea was in the room with me.  I learned some great techniques I'd have never figured out on my own and I've even turned parts of the video on so I could practice what she was teaching. I really like the way it is broken up into segments that are highly instructional and easy to follow along.  The only thing I didn't like is I couldn't ask questions in real time.  This is something I know I will turn to often as I create more wonderful creations.,1358726400,8,780,4.145695364238411
4985906,5,B006G7HGRG,I purchased the book but sometimes visual instructions are needed.  That was why I ordered the DVD.  I needed more details on creating hands and fingers and I was very pleased with the details and visuals in constructing hands and also applying hair.  Patti Medaris Culea's DVD hits every point and detail and I feel confident in creating my own dolls now.  I am ready to purchase her newest DVD.,1356220800,4,396,4.614285714285714

4985912,5,B006G7HGRG,"I would very much reccommend this.  If you are a doll maker, Patti Culea is a pioneer for the art dolls.  I do not know that I would ever have the opportunity to take a class from her so I believe this is the next best thing.  I do have all her books and reccommend them as well - I believe that beginner or advanced dollmakers should all learn alot from this video.",1327363200,17,366,3.9863013698630136

4985917,5,B006G7HGRG,"Cloth Doll making brought right into my home.  I loved the format and how Patti takes her time to show you many options for creating a soft doll.  I own several of Patti's books with the patterns included.  The only negative that I found with this purchase was I felt you needed a book with the pattern to help you along.  There is a pattern that you can print from a computer, but many individuals don't own computers.  However, overall this DVD must get a 5 star rating!!!!  Absolutely love how I can stop the dvd and actually work along with Patti.  Thank you Amazon for a fast delivery.",1383696000,,590,4.3577981651376145
4985918,5,B006G7HGRG,"All of the previous, glowing reviews were *right* -- this DVD is dynamite!  I have all of Patti Medaris Culea's books, and while they're wonderful and very informative, with excellent illustrations and instructions, there are things lacking; that's where this incredible DVD comes in!

It was just delivered today, and though I've only yet watched about an hour of it, I've already realized some of my mistakes - and best of all, how to correct them - and picked up some great tips which are sure to make my continuing doll-making endeavors even more successful!  I caught myself sitting there watching, with a big, dumb, goofy smile on my face and thinking ""Of course!  THAT'S what I should have been doing!""

Patti, while incredibly successful and obviously a master of doll making and beautiful, creative works of art, is not intimidating!  In fact, I'm not even ashamed to admit that I got a touch emotional as I watched her take me, the viewer, through a very simple, yet very effective, demonstration of how to graph the face, how to do the shading - all of it, and I was overjoyed because I felt like I, too, could do this!  I didn't feel like there was any special magic I needed but didn't have (which I had thought before now...), because Patti was so clear and concise in her explanation of the steps to drawing a lovely face.  I feel confident, and like even if I make a mistake, it will be fixable, and that is a gift a wonderful teacher can impart to his or her students; Patti Medaris Culea has done just that.

I could continue gushing about how much I appreciate that this DVD was made and even more so that I finally broke down and invested the money to buy it.  I held back, because, I reasoned, ""I already have all the books; let me see if I can figure this out myself.  I'm sure it will be fine...""  Well, it was *okay,* but now that I've purchased and started watching this DVD, I can attest that it truly is one of the best investments I could have made - if only because it gives me hope, and shows me that practically anyone can make a beautiful doll using the techniques in this DVD.

Thank you, Patti Medaris Culea, for your beautiful dolls, and for your generosity.  I am so grateful that I was able to purchase this DVD (and your books), and I look forward to improving my own art by incorporating what I've learned from you.  I highly recommend this DVD - a superb companion to the books, and a truly lovely way to instill confidence in oneself and one's abilities.",1374537600,5,2495,4.440789473684211
4985919,5,B006G7HGRG,I feel I now have a new hobby that will keep me inspired for years to come with so many aspects of craft that can all me used to make your cloth doll creation,1374105600,,158,3.676470588235294
4985920,5,B006G7HGRG,"This DVD set is worth purchasing even if you already make dolls.  it leads you through sculpting the face, coloring the face, making the body.  The examples shown are wonderful.  Patti is enthusiastic about making dolls and it shows through.  She's also encouraging if you are just starting out.  You may even pick up ideas that help you to make your own doll making better even if you make a different type of doll than she does.",1369872000,,430,4.532467532467533
4985921,5,B006G7HGRG,Finally I get to see how Patti Culea creates her dolls step-by-step. I have all her books and have made a few of her dolls but I still have difficulty needle sculpting the faces so I bought this video. I am a visual learner and needed someone to show me how to do this because with books it is so 2-D and I needed something more 3-D that is why I bought this video and I am so glad I did. THANKS Patti AND Amazon.,1369440000,,413,3.8705882352941177
