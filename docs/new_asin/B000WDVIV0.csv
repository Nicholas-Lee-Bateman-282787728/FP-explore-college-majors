2967075,5,B000WDVIV0,"Judy Belcher is a fantastic teacher.  I had the opportunity to take her  class in person and I knew the second I heard this DVD was comming out it was a must buy!

Millefori Story exceded my highest expectations.  It packed full of her best work and techniques. She has done all the math shows the proportions and explains the why's and hows clearly and step-by-step just like she did live.

Beginners and Pro's alike will take something away from this DVD.",1192233600,3,457,4.524390243902439
2967076,5,B000WDVIV0,"This is a fantastic DVD tutorial on how to make polymer clay canes.....as a beginner to canes, I found the instructions and being able to see the work visually as it was being created to be a perfect.  I was in awe of the finished products, as sometimes I'd be thinking ""where is she going with this creation""?.  This is certainly a must have DVD for anyone even remotely interested in learning how to make canes!!",1191456000,7,414,4.434210526315789

Millefiori Story continues Judy's tradition of excellence.

I have to preface my review with the fact that I am associated with PageSage and this title--I am proud to say that I helped out on some of the production work on this DVD.  However, as an avid polymer clay artist and VP of the South Bay Polymer Clay Guild, I have to say that I am just thrilled with this DVD.

First of all, Millefiori Story is geared towards artists at all levels.  Beginning crafters and clayers will love the basics and simple canes; Judy breaks down the steps of working with clay and creating basic (but very widely used) canes that enables everyone to achieve excellent results.  As you go through the various ""chapters"" of this story, you will build your skills and confidence--and even tackle things that seem so complex--tessellations and a face cane.  Experienced clayers will love to experiment with Judy's techniques and will pick up numerous tips and tricks throughout the over two hours of instruction and inspiration.  Can you imagine making that beautiful bracelet on the cover of the DVD?  With Judy's step-by-step instruction, accessible at any time, you will master the technique and come out with something you will be thrilled to wear (and show off!).

26 canes with 19 additional variations and over 100 gallery samples will keep anyone elbow-deep in clay for many months to come!  It doesn't get any better than this!",1190937600,10,1875,5.684587813620071

8222808,5,B000WDVIV0,"Really good video. It gives a lot of details. Also, you can see the hands on clearly, which makes it easier to see all of the steps in each project.",1468108800,,148,3.966666666666667
8222809,5,B000WDVIV0,Great tutorial for those that like or would like to learn about polymer clay techniques.  This was recommended by my polymer clay group.,1403222400,,136,4.913043478260869
8222810,5,B000WDVIV0,I have learned a lot from this DVD and still have much more to learn.  The DVD was in great condition.,1367366400,,102,3.857142857142857
8222811,5,B000WDVIV0,"Thought this was great !!!, you gain so much in actually watching a process performed then just reading about it.. Fun projects, and skills you will use over and over in your own projects. no regrets!!!",1234483200,,202,4.638888888888889
8222812,5,B000WDVIV0,"I love this DVD!  Judy starts off with very simple canes, and then she gradually shows more complex canes.  The little tips, like easier ways to slice canes, help a lot.  Also, the camera angles are good, and you can easily see small pieces of clay.

8222813,5,B000WDVIV0,"I admit it; I'm enthralled with geometric patterns in clay.  But I've had very limited success with my attempts to create such intricate patterns.  Not now.  Judy turned on the light bulb for me with the tesselations section of this DVD.  I have been a tesselating fool ever since.  Judy's directions were very clear and detailed in every step of this video.  I like that I can go to any specific technique from the menu, too, and not have to watch the whole thing again to see what I want.  My only regret is not purchasing this video sooner.  When I get over my obsession with tesselations, I'm going to start on the many other techniques Judy presented, beginning with quilt patterns.  I am quite confident I can master them all with Judy's excellent instructions.",1207353600,,767,4.622222222222222
8222814,5,B000WDVIV0,"If you always wanted to know the ""mystery"" of poly clay canes -- you HAVE to see this. Jusy Belcher does it one step at a time - explaining things in Simple language as she goes. She even shows you her mistakes and tells you what she did wrong. I was GLUED to this video .... I leaned more from watching this than I did from reading tons of books. What looked so hard - is actually easy. This is the best video you can ever buy for polyclay .I HIGHLY recommend it !",1206662400,2,465,3.9574468085106385
8222815,5,B000WDVIV0,"Thank you Judy!!!! This is a must have in your polymer clay library. I love the content AND the easy to operate DVD. They have a menu that you can jump from one segment to another, so easy!! Judy explains and demonstrates her techniques as if she's in the room with you. This is my favorite DVD in my polymer clay library. Judy's books are just as fantastic and mine are well used. Thanks again Judy for putting this together for us!",1199145600,4,433,4.2926829268292686
8222816,5,B000WDVIV0,This is a excellent video for all polymer clay lovers! A must have for all. Truly learned new techniques from one of the best polymer clay artists.,1194912000,2,147,4.481481481481482
