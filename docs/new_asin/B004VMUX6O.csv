4483532,1,B004VMUX6O,"This claims to be a dramatization of DH Lawrence's novel, Women in Love. It is not. The story is not the story that Lawrence told; it does not even resemble that story. The characters have nothing in common with the characters in the novel, though they have the same names. William Ivory, who wrote the script, has written a play that is entirely his own. Well, DH Lawrence is a great writer, and Women in Love is often said to be the best thing he ever wrote. There are very few great writers. William Ivory is not a great writer.  His play is silly and sentimental. He is entitled to write a silly and sentimental play if he chooses; however, he should not claim to be adapting DH Lawrence when he does so. I certainly would not have bought the DVD if he had not made that claim.",1306022400,6,781,4.277027027027027

4483534,1,B004VMUX6O,"Have you ever noticed how Whigs always describe good things as ""iconic"", and Republicans always describe them as ""robust""?  I would describe this as ""robust"" republican soft pornography, even thought the ""erotic"" encounters are decidedly monotonous.  The whole point of Lawrence's novel
was to take a couple of ""bonded"" males ""who were radically different in the first place and have the ""Women in Love"" rip their relationship to shreds.,
demonstrating that it is not about women loving, but about the potentially destructive power of love itself, over both men and women and the devil take the hindmost..  If you like bedrooms with mirrors in the ceiling, you'll probably like ""Women in Love"", but I""m afraid Lawrence wouldn't have the slightest idea of what you thought you  were observing.  .  The masturbation scenes were appalling.",1424995200,,836,5.201492537313433
4483535,1,B004VMUX6O,"This is easily the worst literary adaptation I have ever watched in my entire life. The idiots who made this thing sure have balls, considering it was produced while Ken Russell was still alive. They basically took major scenes from the novels The Rainbow and Women in Love, tossed them in a blender, then rehashed everything in a completely different order. And that is only the beginning.

What was wrong with the BBC ""Women in Love"" specifically? I don't know where to begin. I was mentally keeping tally of everything they changed from the book and lost count! Every single scene is in a different place than it is in the actual story. Every single one. It also had a sex scene every five minutes, which is not an exaggeration on my part; I kept my eye on the clock. Granted, sex scenes are especially important to an adaptation of Women in Love, but one thing Ken Russell understood so well that the BBC did not is the importance of the nude scene between the two men, Birkin and Gerald. In Russell's movie, there is not that much nudity up to the wrestling scene... then BAM! We really understand what is going on precisely because of the delicate way Russell handled the nudity. Here, not only is there plenty of nakedness every moment, but there is no attraction between the two men; in fact, Gerald has no attraction to men at all. Instead, what was supposed to be a wrestling scene turns out to be two guys who went swimming and then got into an argument for no reason. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

I wasn't exactly expecting a great or even moderately decent movie, but the abominable ""quality"" of this production exceeded my expectations in ways I never imagined. Anyway, I suppose I'll highlight the most egregious errors:

1. Birkin in the miniseries is a bumbling, balding, fat preacher who is still denying his sexuality. He can barely speak to people and has this wimpy demeanor that drove me NUTS. Compare this to the Birkin the book--who is basically a D.H. Lawrence stand-in--and Alan Bates's performance, and you'll get my irritation. Birkin in the novel is a virile, confident smartass extraordinaire, has the most biting quips, tolerates no stupidity, and is perfectly comfortable with his sexuality--which is much more complex than this idiotic miniseries makes it out to be. Need further evidence? Just search for ""Rory Kinnear in Women Love""; then, search ""Alan Bates and Figs."" You'll see what I mean. Especially about figs.

2. Gerald in the miniseries has no attraction to men. This is so stupid I don't even know where to begin.

3. The series kept some of the same dialogue from the Russell film, but it's in different places and the cast consists of mediocre actors. I know Rosamund Pike was nominated for an Oscar for Gone Girl, but here she is almost unwatchable and completely miscast. Having some of the original lines served as a litmus test, though, and she and the rest of the cast failed tremendously. My respect for Glenda Jackson--and Alan Bates, Oliver Reed, Jennie Linden, and Eleanor Bron--has exploded after watching this awful, awful, awful production.

4. The miniseries ends with them going to the desert instead of a trip to the Swiss Alps, which is another senseless change. Not to mention, the evasion of anything homoerotic makes Gerald's death incomprehensibly stupid and void of any sense. Having to watch Rosamund Pike weeping about how much she loved him only adds insult to injury. Moreover, we're denied that brilliant final scene from the book and original film.

5. The miniseries mashed up the two novels ""The Rainbow"" and ""Women in Love"" and tried to put them within the same time frame. Ridiculous! Events from later in ""Women in Love,"" such as the drowning, took place during the ""Rainbow"" portion of the production. Oh, and they just HAD to add in story lines about WWI, like Gerald getting caught in a bomb. Never mind Lawrence deliberately excluded any reference to WWI to keep the novels' themes universal. In a preface to the American edition of ""Women in Love,""which was published in the US in 1920, he wrote, ""[Women in Love] is a novel which took its final shape in the midst of the period of war, though it does not concern the war itself. I should wish the time to remain UNFIXED, so that the bitterness of the war may be taken for granted in the characters"" (Penguin edition, p. 485, my all caps). Yes, UNFIXED. But why should any modern screenwriter tire him or herself with adapting a novel faithfully? I mean, reading and stuff, oh, it takes, like, so long....

6. The drowning scene that was so harrowing and disturbing in the Ken Russell movie--and the BOOK!--is totally played down here. It is set...wait for it...during the action in...The Rainbow. Birkin's and Gerald's stories are sandwiched into The Rainbow, with many of the events that are so important in shaping their relationships with Gudrun and Ursula, respectively, stripped of any meaning here. The actor who played Gerald was awful, too, acting more like he'd lost one of his mittens than watched his sister die. Compare that with Oliver Reed's heartbreaking reaction and you'll want to break something.

7. It's worth noting the BBC produced this junk. Ken Russell began his career directing documentaries on composers and artists for the BBC in the 1960s, but he was fired after trying to be more experimental. His version of ""Women in Love,"" which is nothing short of a masterpiece, was released in 1969. The British film industry completely abandoned Russell after the 1970s, forcing him to make his later movies on the cheap. It's only appropriate (and I mean that in a very grating, sarcastic way) that the BBC made this movie while Russell was still alive. Personally, I'd love to hear Glenda Jackson's thoughts, considering she was in Russell's productions of both ""The Rainbow"" and ""Women in Love."" She seems like she'd tell the truth in a very scary way, which I love. :)

There are so many other problems; I actually found several deviations from the novel in EVERY SINGLE SCENE. That would be quite a feat if it weren't so insulting and didn't produce such a vile, idiotic, and just plain terrible movie. I could write a whole book about why this film is so lousy, but I'll just say don't watch this crapfest; watch the Ken Russell film, which is a masterpiece and one of the best movies of the past 70 years, and you won't be disappointed. And don't forget to Google ""Alan Bates and figs."" Trust me.",1424736000,5,6463,4.75222816399287

4483540,2,B004VMUX6O,"The production is well-made, I'll give it that, but it's terribly muddled. I'd read Women in Love and I was confused- newcomers will be at a complete loss.

The trouble is that this is a mash-up with The Rainbow. Originally DH Lawrence intended Women in Love to be part of The Rainbow; The Rainbow is the sexual saga of three generations of the Brangwen family, all looking for fulfilment. We get two generations here- the central characters Ursula (Rachel Stirling) and Gudrun (Rosamond Pike), and their parents Anna (Saskia Reeves) and Will (Ben Daniels). The whole thing starts off on a bit of a downer- Ursula is still getting over the events of The Rainbow, which are shown in flashback. Basically, she was used and abused by a charmless soldier, Anton Skrebensky (Joseph Kennedy)- who looks like he's from the 1970s rather than the 1900s. In The Rainbow, Anton is initially very charming, dazzling even in his cool self-assurance, but because this production doesn't have time for Anton, all characterisation is dispensed with. It is inconceivable to believe that Ursula would be attracted to such an overtly seedy man. Even though Kennedy has nowhere to go with the character, he could at least portray some superficial charisma, but no. From the doom and gloom of it all, you'd think you were watching a Thomas Hardy novel!

In addition to that, we flit occasionally to Anna and Will- who are minor in Women in Love. He wants Anna, Anna's too tired, he finds a girl but conscience strikes him! Readers of The Rainbow will remember that conscience only really strikes Will once he's contemplated rape. Reeves and Daniels are acceptable enough in the roles; Daniels is a lot closer to the character of Will than Christopher Gable was in the 1989 film.

Having muddled his way through The Rainbow and Women in Love, screenwriter William Ivory tries to finish off Women in Love. Rather constrained by having to shoot in South Africa, the whole thing looks ridiculous. The snowy climax of the novel because a sunny climax in this production! The greatest part of Women in Love is the nude wrestling scene between Gerald (Joseph Mawle) and Birkin (Rory Kinnear)- Gudrun and Ursula's lovers. Lawrence intends it as a sort of spiritual culmination of male friendship, the ultimate male bonding- perhaps betraying his own desires here. Though I can see why the makers of this production might have wanted to cut it, in case the viewers didn't understand its significance, they replace it with a sort of nude squabble on a beach. It completely undermines Lawrence's message and is just the kind of simple-minded perspective people have of Lawrence.

Though there are good performances and the characterisation of sisters and Gerald and Birkin is relatively close to the novel, the whole thing is just messy. Women in Love is a stand-alone novel; you don't need to have read The Rainbow, so I have no idea why it was shoed-in. Actually, I do. DH Lawrence has a certain reputation as a smut-peddlar who constantly has sex on the brain. This is a wonderful advantage for the BBC, when they're looking to do a costume drama with a bit of an edge. It's cheap titilation but we can write it off as being faithful to Lawrence. His characters has sex; our characters have sex! Viewers who are not a fan of sex or nudity on screen might want to give this a miss, as it's an attempt at pseudo-sexual liberation. We all know that the makers of this production aren't really trying to portray sexual awakening and the complexities of sexuality. Lawrence's perspective on sex (as a writer at least) was that there is a spectrum of sexuality and that through sex people could escape the deadening mechanical world of the industrial society and be reborn as independent men and women. Whether you agree with the philosophy or not, you can surely agree that it's much better than the superficial exploration here.

There's also the cliche of throwing in some swearing. Yes, there were quite a few swearwords in Lady Chatterley's Lover but not in any of his other novels. Again, this is an attempt to try and be 'sexually candid' whereas actually it's a pathetic attempt to shock the conservative fans of costume dramas. This is not one for Aunt Edna.

Personally, I don't think Women in Love is that great a novel, though the makers have picked up on the word 'Women' in the title and tried to re-fashion it as some kind of feminist text. Ursula and Gudrun are definitely modern women in their attitudes to sex and female independence but it isn't a feminist novel. Ken Russell did a much better job of taking a feminist perspective when he adapted The Rainbow in 1989. Rachel Stirling is much better as Ursula than Sammi Davis was, but who could forget Paul McGann's dashing portrayal of Anton Skrebensky?

In short, if you fancy dabbling with Lawrence, rent The Rainbow (1989) and Women in Love (1969). I gave this production two stars purely because it's relatively well-acted. However, as a drama it just doesn't work.",1391040000,15,5004,4.791425260718424

4483559,2,B004VMUX6O,"This BBC lead balloon based on two D.H. Lawrence novels has almost nothing to recommend it.  The acting is high school amateurish, the directing is consistent in its one-note dullness, the dialog is often hard to understand (at least there are subtitles), the music score is incredibly insipid, the script muddled and none of the leads are in any way likeable.  There is no feeling that any of the four main characters knows anything whatsoever about one another - or cares a whit about each other.  In this yawner, there is naught of love or romance or sexual charge or desire - despite a lot of full-frontal nudity from both genders. It is a miniseries shot by the numbers and with little care - watch Gerald's dead dad's eyes blink a couple of times as one example of the general carelessness of the production.  The World War One trench warfare scene was so unrealistic that I thought it was a dream/nightmare sequence instead.  The nude seashore battle twixt Gerald and Rupert is filled with incomprehensible dialog that merely serves to irritate one.  There are many, many garbled scenes actually. Gerald's final trek to oblivion is an exercise in pure pretentiousness.  Ursula wears but one expression through the entire film, looking like she is in dire need of an enema.  Rupert is stripped of all his philosophic complexity and charm, thus rendering him a eunuch more than a fully-sexed man or the intended mouthpiece of Lawrence himself.  Gerald looks like Danny Bonaduce smashed into Vincent van Gogh and is boring beyond belief.  And Gudrun seems like malice aforethought throughout the entire unidimensional undertaking - an undertaking that seriously needs an undertaker!  The best part of the entire thing was the relationship betwixt Mr. and Mrs. Brangwen which is developed in part one - and then completely dropped in part two - which was just another example of the general carelessness at work herein.

4483561,5,B004VMUX6O,"Adapted from D.H. Lawrence's legendary controversial novel, WOMEN IN LOVE is a powerful 2-part miniseries that follows the romantic and erotic adventures of two sisters from Britain's industrial Midlands, Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen, during the years before, during and following World War I.  This three-hour production also incorporates aspects of Lawrence's earlier banned novel, THE RAINBOW, which deals with the same characters.

This production, adapted by William Ivory and directed by Miranda Bowen, is remarkably different to the two films of Lawrence's novels that were directed by Ken Russell in 1969 (WOMEN IN LOVE) and 1989 (THE RAINBOW), both of which co-starred Glenda Jackson.

It's been several years since I've seen either movie, but as I recall, unlike in this new version, there were no World War I battle scenes, nor did the 1969 picture delve into the confused sexual identity of Rupert Birkin, played in the original version by Alan Bates and in this one by Rory Kinnear.  Also, the final scenes in the movie took place on the mountains of Switzerland, whereas the ending of the miniseries is set in South Africa where the production was shot.

This new WOMEN IN LOVE is a magnificent, bold production, filled with exquisite performances by a superb cast.  Rosamund Pike (Gundrun) and Rachael Stirling (Ursula) are two of the finest actresses working today, and each brings a unique vulnerability and sensuality to their individual roles.  Indeed, Ms. Pike may give us a softer Gundrun than did Glenda Jackson, who won an Oscar for her portrayal, yet her Gundrun can be just as unfeeling and dangerous to the men she ensnares.

Kinnear, Joseph Mawle (as Gerald Crich, the role played by Oliver Reed in the 1969 film) and Saskia Reeves (as the sexually-frustrated mother of the sisters) are all excellent.

Be advised that this production has some very graphic sexual scenes that include both male and female full frontal nudity.
