308489,5,6301065573,"I was a bit surprised to hear this was Alfred Hitchcock's favorite film.  I enjoy Psycho, Rear Window, North by Northwest, Rebecca, The Birds and even To Catch a Thief more than this film.  I gave this 5 stars (because it's Hitchcock) but as far as Hitchcock films go....I would call it slightly above average.  I did enjoy the film.",1509235200,,333,4.516666666666667
308490,5,6301065573,"Being directed by Hitchcock, people tend to overlook that the story was writing credits Thornton Niven Wilder who wrote ""Our Town"" three years earlier.
Teresa Wright one year earlier was in ""Mrs. Miniver""

This film is creepy from the beginning as Charlie (Joseph Cotton) goes to his hometown to avoid two mysterious men following him. Who are they and what do they want of him?

Mean while back home things are just down right monotonous. Little Charlie (Teresa Wright) plans to send a telegram to Uncle Charlie to come and brighten up the place. She realizes she possesses telepathy when Uncle Charlie's telegram reaches her first. When Uncle Charlie arrives he brings secrets and the two mysterious men show up as magazine men doing a survey. Little Charlie must find the secrets and why the men are there. Each scene and secret reveals a more sinister environment. It just gets creepier.

The film and the camera angles are exceptional. The dialog helps build up the tension. Yet on this VHS copy I can not help but thing that some scenes were cut or something to that affect. One minute Little Charlie is walking happily with her quasi date. The next moment she is being apologized to for being deceived as he reveals his purpose. I wonder how many more scenes were cut or condensed.

However you will want to keep a copy of this classic.",1508544000,,1343,4.702127659574468
308491,5,6301065573,One of the best Hitchcock films ever.  A real feel for small town naive life invaded by a soulless killer. The more I watch this film the more I like it. A truly different film for Joseph Cotton who usually plays the conscience of the film here he plays his normal charming character who is totally evil. Such a great surprise if you've watched his other films. A really strong female character who has to deal with the danger pretty much on her own. A young girl who becomes a tough adult over the course of this film.,1508457600,,519,4.295918367346939

308560,4,6301065573,"I viewed this in a revival film theater many years before. This time around it was a HD ""stream"".
I would consider this second tier Hitchcock, a notch below ""Vertigo"" and ""Strangers on a Train"".
Very competently done as always with Hitchcock. I especially enjoy his work with the character actors who add such humor and texture to their roles.
It is always interesting as well to see traditional leading men cast as either ambiguous moral characters or in the ""heavy"" role.",1502236800,,473,4.780487804878049

308596,5,6301065573,"The 1943 film Shadow of a Doubt was written by the great writer Thornton Wilder and was directed by the great director Alfred Hitchcock. Hickok stated that it was his favorite film. Many viewers will agree that it is very good and worth seeing.
A man who we see is guilty of killing widows and taking their money is being pursued by the police. He flees, hoping to evade the police, to his sister's house, where her husband and three children live. One of her daughters is a mature young woman who is very perceptive. She is infatuated with her uncle, but soon realizes because of several mistakes he makes, that he is the villain that the police are trying to catch. She sees this in the ring he gives her as a gift that has the initials of a woman who was killed, in his refusal to have his picture taken, in hiding a page in a newspaper about the Merry Widow killer, in the enormous amount of money he has, and in the way he speaks to people. Two police officers come to the sister's house to find out what they can about the uncle. The niece soon develops a close relationship with one of the officers. The uncle realizes that his niece knows that he is the killer and reacts.
The film movie along in a suspenseful manner, and the acting is great.",1494201600,,1251,4.305084745762712

308601,5,6301065573,"Another enduring masterpiece by Alfred Hitchcock, shot in glorious black & white.  The story is based on Earle Leonard Nelson, a mass murderer in the 1920s known as the Merry Widow Murderer.  As Hitchcock would have it, dear Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) is trying to evade two pesky detectives who suspect him of multiple murders.  He picks the perfect hideout, his sisters home in California.  At the same time, his niece Charlie (Teresa Wright) is bored silly and wants some excitement.  She immediately thinks of dear Uncle Charlie, wouldnt it be fun if he came for a visit?  Careful what you wish for!  Uncle Charlie shows up trailed by the two pesky detectives who see fit to warn Charlie that her uncle may not be all he claims.  Slowly, after a couple of murder attempts on her life, Charlie begins to think..............maybe my uncle doesnt have my best interest at heart.

Beautifully filmed with an incredible use of shadows and smoke.  The tension and suspense is perfectly balanced by the strange comic relief of Henry Travers (as Charlies father) and Hume Cronyn (as their neighbor Herb); they amuse themselves by plotting to murder each other.",1489449600,,1159,4.897435897435898

308711,4,6301065573,You really can't go wrong with Hitchcock.  he was a master at both choosing the stories he told and how he told them and this one is no exception.  Theresa Wright was at the top of her game and held up well against veteran Joseph Cotton.  All the supporting cast were excellent and you get a treat with the performance of a young Hugh Cronin.  Well-paced with a nice build up as it dawns on Theresa Wright that her beloved uncle may have something to hide.,1473552000,,456,4.267441860465116

308717,4,6301065573,"The interplay with Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright and their respective performances deliver an enjoyable, lighter Hitchcock film.  The somewhat ghoulish sub-topic between Henry Travers and a young Hume Cronyn provides just the right level of levity.

It is said that this is the only film where Joseph Cotton plays a menacing character. The film is perfectly case. Cotton and Wright are at the top of their games. McDonald Carey for those of old enough to know, who plays a young detective investigating Merry Widow murders, played a doctor forever on the daytime soap Days of Our Lives. He is in fine form too.

309015,4,6301065573,"By now, this is the fourth Hitchcock film that I've seen and it certainly is a better representation of what I understood his work to be than SABOTEUR was. SHADOW OF A DOUBT, which Hitchcock said was his favorite, is a rather simple tale that explores one of his favorite themes: mistaken identity. Joseph Cotten (THE THIRD MAN) plays ""Uncle Charlie"" who visits his family for a visit in Santa Rosa, California. However, he's not quite what his young niece Charlie remembers. One thing I've noticed about Hitchcock's films is the various ways he's able to create tension and suspense in a way that keeps the viewer hooked. Some of the elements he uses includes light and shadow, camera angles, the score, etc. All of them came together in a rather cohesive way that kept me interested in seeing where the story would go. This film also captures an America in transition. The world created here isn't the paranoia-filled one of SABOTEUR, but still one where suspicion is very palpable and there's a sense that trust is becoming less of an innate quality in Everytown, USA. Like in SABOTEUR, there are two characters who serve as thematic counterpoint to each other. Here, they are the two Charlies. Joseph Cotten's character is somewhat of an idealized figure for his young niece (Teresa Wright), but the reality of how cynical and pessimistic he really is gets revealed over the course of the film. I thought it was a brilliant way of showing how expectations measure up when faced with reality. There's also the ""is he/isn't he?"" sense of if he's really even the person he purports to be, which plays into the themes of suspicion and trust. One thing I wasn't entirely expecting was the awkward sexual tension (in a few scenes) between the two Charlies, which added an incest layer that helped to flesh out the tense relationship between them. If there's anything weak about the film, the ending was a bit abrupt and a romance that develops between young Charlie and a detective seemed to be shoehorned in (and provided for an unnecessary coda. Still, I liked this film very much and it bodes well for the successive Hitchcock films I'll be viewing later this month.",1439683200,,2167,4.76595744680851

309049,4,6301065573,"Shadow of a Doubt, 1943 film

The film opens on a long-gone city scene: boys are playing baseball in the street with no automobile traffic. A landlady tells a roomer that two gentlemen were looking for him; they said they were friends. He leaves and they follow him. Uncle Charlie decides to visit his relatives in Santa Rosa California. Little Ann gets the message. The steam-powered locomotive pulls into the station to meet the waiting family. All are happy. Uncle Charlie presents a wrist-watch to his banker brother-in-law, a novelty for him. We learn about the family. Charlie gives an emerald ring to his niece, named Charlene after him. His niece now thinks of a tune - ""The Merry Widow Waltz"". This banker has in interest in true crime stories. There is a funny incident with the daily newspaper. Niece Charlie is a sharp observer and figures out the trick. But we see a hidden side of Uncle Charlie.

We learn that two men want to interview the family and take their photographs. Uncle Charlie doesn't like that! (He must have left a back trail.) When he visits the bank he makes jokes in poor taste (displaying a contempt for his relatives). Uncle Charlie demands the film after he is accidentally photographed. Niece Charlie figures out the ""reporter"" is a detective, and he tells her about the search for an unknown subject who is a murderer of rich widows! At the dinner table Uncle Charlie shows his contempt for old rich widows. There is an odd discussion about poisoning by a neighbor Herb. Charlie runs off, and Uncle Charlie takes her to a cocktail lounge for a chat. He twists a napkin to symbolize his nervousness and troubled mind. Later niece Charlie is warned by a detective that the photograph was sent east and they could arrest her uncle in two hours. But fresh news points to a solved case, by default. It seems to be over. But new events bring danger from accidents. Uncle Charlie presents a speech, then announces he is being called away on personal business. At the railroad station there is a final chapter to this story. [I found the ending improbable.]

Alfred Hitchcock's films often show the horrors that can pop up in everyday life in a small town, or a large city. Crime and violence are mostly suggested, except at the ending. Imagine having a distant relative who was a serial killer? This film presents small town life around 1943. The war is hinted at by the men in uniform. No mention of rationing. It is a forerunner to those TV dramas that portray parents as bumbling fools oblivious to the realities of teen-age life. The discussion about crime (or sports) suggest the censorship that forbids that forbids any mention of politics, the economy, or the unmentionable war. They didn't want to upset their customers.",1437696000,,2758,4.72972972972973

Young Charlie's disillusionment as she slowly comes to the realization her uncle is The Merry Widow Murderer is the core of the movie and her determination to shield her family from the truth enables Ms. Wright to do some fine acting.

309104,5,6301065573,"Critics and fans agree that Shadow of a Doubt is director Alfred Hitchcocks finest film. It was nominated for an academy award for Best Story in 1943 and was selected  in 1991 by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States national film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Perhaps best of all, it has a 100% rating on the movie website Rotten Tomatoes from critics and fans alike.
Shadow of a Doubt is the story of a seemingly charming man, Uncle Charlie, who has a dark and sinister side which is slowly unraveled by his niece. Uncle Charlies true character is skillfully revealed through stylized cinematography, intriguing lighting, and an uneasy plot.
 In the opening scene, cinematography sets the stage for the movie and its focus: Uncle Charlie. As the intro credits fade, we see a sweeping vista of a large bridge and a citys skyline. The shots fade into a neighborhood, then a street with kids playing ball in the street of that same neighborhood. After the street we see a building, then a window, then Charlie laying on a bed in a formal suit, with a slow movement to his face, and then the camera lingers there. This series of shots sets the stage of the films focus on Uncle Charlie. At first, the audience does not know who this man is or what he is doing, but we know that the movie is all about him. The cinematography in the rest of this first scene gives insight and foreshadowing into Uncle Charlies true character. After we see him on the bed, we learn that two men are looking for him. This seems to spook Charlie as he makes immediate plans to leave, walking out the door and right past the two men. The scene ends with a birds-eye view of the two men running around confused, with Charlie looking down at them from the top of a building.  This shows us that Uncle Charlie is elusive, tries to confuse people and may have a few dark secrets that will be explored in this film. Much can be learned about Uncle Charlie from paying attention to the cinematography of the first seven minutes of the movie.

 From that very first scene in the movie, lighting also plays a key role in establishing Uncle Charlies character. As Charlie lies on the bed in the small, darkened room, the camera lingers on his motionless face.  The only thing that is illuminated is the bottom-half of his face; his eyes remain in the shadows.  This creates a mysterious and eery feeling about Charlie, and the viewer wants to know more.  Shortly, as a blind is closed on a window, shadows overtake Charlie from head to toe.  When the blind is reopened by Charlie, it creates shadows reminiscent of a jail cell, metaphorically reflecting the nature of Uncle Charlies lifestyle because, although he is never incarcerated, his options are so limited, he may as well be in jail.  In that first seven minutes of Shadow of a Doubt,  the lighting implies an awfully lot about Charlie and his life:  hes not a nice man and his life is full of dark secrets.

 Shadow of a Doubts plot contributes to Uncle Charlies story. His essence is a sharp contrast to the world in which his family lives; they are small town people and innocent, while he is a murderer. Despite this difference, Uncle Charlies family remains oblivious until his niece discovers the truth about his life, and she chooses to keep his secret hidden.  Her reality is altered by the fall of her hero.  Uncle Charlies attitude contrasts greatly with his family; their world is filled with a soft glow of light which shows a dreamy and happy world. This reality is a stark contrast compared to Uncle Charlies reality of his life in the shadows. This ignorance is a source of irony, especially with a sub-plot involving Charlies brother-in-law, Mr. Newton, and his friend Herbie, who are both obsessed with the so-called ""perfect crime. This subplot occurs regularly; Mr. Newton and Herbie being completely oblivious to the fact that a real life serial killer, the affable Uncle Charlie, lives among them.  This sub-plot juxtaposes the innocence of family members as they entertain themselves with impossible tales of crime and highlights the inherent evil that exists among them, within Uncle Charlie.
  All in all, the cinematography, lighting and plot, combined with other movie-making dimensions, contribute to the characterization of Uncle Charlie. From the very first scene, viewers understand that Uncle Charlie is a man with a story, and they are drawn into that story by every dimension of artistic movie-making.  These elements combine to make Shadow of a Doubt a masterpiece forever. Way to go Alfred; you really outdid yourself. This is what the cinema is for.",1428278400,,4681,4.762669962917181

309276,5,6301065573,"1943's SHADOW OF A DOUBT is an allegorical study of Americana seen through the naivete of a typical family in a quiet and slumberous community. When evil comes to town in the embodiment of the beloved Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) it is the perceptive niece Young Charlie (Teresa Wright) that slowly uncovers his true identity as the Merry Widow murderer. Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn spend their evenings concocting ways to commit the perfect murder unknowingly under the watchful eyes of the genuine article. Evil takes many shapes and hides behind many facades in broad daylight. Would the wholesome average American community recognize such evil and be willing to deal with it? These are questions that the transplanted Hitchcock would ask about his new home. Another transplant, Dimitri Tiomkin, composed a brilliant score utilizing American idioms laced with the darkness of the tainted soul. This remains one of Hitchcock's best films since it works, as a thriller yet remains a true reflection of a good-natured but generally complacent lifestyle. What is interesting is that Hitchcock shows his usual disdain for police by having the niece foil the Merry Widow murderer and not agent Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey). The vigilant individual is still the screen's most valuable asset.",1415059200,,1291,5.241545893719807

Also, the cops give up too unrealistically easy after supposedly devoting a significant portion of their job on the case. Not believable. Still, one of Hitchcock's better films, thanks to Cotton and Thornton Wilder's script. The parallels between Cotton and young Charlie add another layer to the character development.

309418,5,6301065573,"Ive been watching a lot of early Hitchcock as of late.  In fact, this year alone Ive gotten my hands on quite a few of his 40s films, including Foreign Correspondent, Lifeboat, Spellbound and Suspicion.  While I have always been a real fan of Hitchcock, from what little I knew of his work (for the longest time it was just me and his considered classics), digging into his lesser known, or lesser congratulated films, has deepened my appreciation for the talent he possessed.  He had so much more range than many who are not familiar with his entire body of work would give him credit for.

But like most, I prefer my Hitch when he delves into the darker side of man.

Yes, Hitchcock has long been considered as the Master of Suspense, and that is what I prefer to see out of his films.  When I find one that I had yet to be spellbound by, and one that doesnt seem to have been altered drastically by those awful censors (which happened far too often), I kind of jump for joy a little.

I was jumping Saturday night.

About ten minutes into Shadow of a Doubt I was reminded of a recent film, from last year even, that carried with it obvious inspiration from this film, right down to the Uncles name.  Yes, Im talking about Stoker, and honestly I think these two films would make a really impressive double feature.  Both films center on an impressionable young woman who has a unique connection to her Uncle and who uncovers a dark secret that causes her to question his morality.  It also forces her to make a decision that will affect her life forever.

Shadow of a Doubt (which ironically was only a temporary title and was never intended for actual use) tells the story of two Charlies.  One is a young woman living in a home she feels is fractured.  She isn't happy and cant understand why the rest of her family doesnt do something about it.  The second is her uncle, a man we are introduced to in the first scene as someone with something to hide.  What it is, we are not quite sureyet.  Young Charlie feels the need to contact her uncle and persuade him to come visit.  She feels that his presence would help the dissention in the family.  Uncle Charlie, attempting to escape whatever harm may be coming his way, had the idea to go and visit his family, so obviously both sets of ears were burning.

Telepathy, or at least a sense of subconscious communication, is a strong theme in this film, and it really helps establish a strong sense of character development between the films two leads.

When Uncle Charlie arrives at the Newton household, things start to alter rather quickly.  Young Charlie can sense something hidden beneath her uncles expressionless face and she starts to wonder why hes constantly on edge.  When she does a little digging she uncovers something horrific that she could never imagine her uncle would actually be involved in, but the evidence is quite convincing, and when two detectives show up asking questions and prodding young Charlie for help, it becomes obvious to her that her uncle is NOT the man she thought he was.

For me, Shadow of a Doubt is pretty much the perfect culmination of all of Hitchcocks talents, bringing to fruition one of the most intoxicating thrillers that Ive seen in a very long time.  The fact that it was made in 1943 and still stands up today is quite an impressive feat.  The score looms over every scene (bravo Mr. Tiomkin) and the cinematography is a stunning use of shadows and lighting (and smoke) to create an ominous feeling without ever feeling manipulative.  But, when all is said and done, this film is anchored by the brilliant performances of the two leads; Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright.

A lot can be said for what Cotten has done here.  His tortured exterior plays to something lurking beneath the surface that he initially is truly concerned will ruin himself and those around him, and the glimmers of actual human feeling help establish him as a character we are in fear of, but don't want to hate.  But, as the film progresses and his motives become clearer and clearer, he is shockingly good at stripping away all doubt as to his moral disintegration and basically becoming a living, breathing human monster.

But for me, as great as Cotten was, this film belongs to Teresa Wright.

For me, this was a star turn if I ever saw one.  Playing a young teenager, Wright infuses such honest human dilemma into her performance, capturing the lingering aspect of doubt that permeates her entire life, but she never fails to illuminate the innocence (slowly being stripped away) that brims at the surface.  She plays young Charlies happy moments with such warmth, and she layers her concern with something richer; such confliction.  The way that she toys, internally, with her uncles actions and debates her next move is utterly convincing, and she composes a complete character who remains the sole focal point of the film, even in the midst of a very devious presence.  Yes, despite sharing the screen with a very impressionable villain, the audience never wavers from their interest on Wright.  She is compelling from start to finish.

For me, Shadow of a Doubt is top tier Hitchcock, and I mean the very top tier.  The evil that swells in Uncle Charlie never feels tampered with, and the suspense that Hitch creates is never derailed by obvious mishandling by censors (as was seen in films like Suspicion, which carried some similar themes but failed to follow through with them).  It also marks a perfect marriage of script, actors and director, where each element falls into place beautifully to create a unified and impenetrable film.

71 years later, and Shadow of a Doubt is still a stunning contribution to the thriller genre.",1398038400,,5719,4.6563745019920315
309419,5,6301065573,"...Shadow of a Doubt is without a doubt one of the most slyly subversive of all Hitchcock's films. Taking off from the trope of the idyllic American small town, Shadow hints at all manner of perversions. Not simply those of mania and mass homicide, but of the subtler and more insidious forms of evil: the subversion of innocence, the taint of incest, the seductive qualities of madness and malice, the suggestion that behind the closed doors of 'normal' homes are forms of horror that might actually make Uncle Charlie's doings pale by comparison.

I don't find it surprising that Hitch selected the debonair and genial Joseph Cotten to play Charles...much like James Stewart later on, Cotten must have suggested to Hitchcock the perfect combination of to-all-appearances All-American charm and normality; but lurking just below that pleasing surface is an ability to evoke a disturbed and disturbing psyche whose immanent expression sometimes lies just a little too close to the top for comfort.

Psychotic Uncle Charlie adores his niece just as much as she adores him, but in a way that is clearly colored by both a warped desire to strip her of her innocent illusions about life and an equally perverse desire that's tinged with a sort of eroticism that supposedly has no place in familial relations. Charles' famous speech to Young Charlie, where he refers to the idea that if one could rip the fronts from average homes, one would find swine, is oddly suggestive. Where did Charles originally come by this view? Was there, perhaps, something within the makeup of his own early years that led him to realize the supposedly pristine outer demeanor of 'nice' families might harbor goings-on that were anything but sweetness and light? What sort of relationship is being hinted at between Charles and his sister, which, in some ways, seems redolent of something a bit other than simply loving siblings? And is Charles, sickened as he obviously is by his murderous contacts with bovine and unappetizing older females, in turn transferring both his hopelessly corrupted worldview and a need to fasten onto a lovely and uncorrupted young woman to the most terrifying object possible--the trusting and adoring Charlie, who feels a special bond with him? A bond that might incorporate hints of a dark side within young Charlie herself, if I'm reading what seem to be Hitchcock's subtexts correctly.

The reverberations of the relationship between the two Charlies is fascinating, and goes deep--there is a lot there for the viewer who goes looking between the lines, and more than enough to satisfy the viewer who simply sees their relations as the workings out of an utterly enjoyable cat-and-mouse suspenser.  There are levels and levels within the framework of a seemingly simple story going on, and the shadings of Wright's and Cotten's wonderfully delicate, while at the same time eyebrow-raisingly suggestive, performances bring out every nuance of Thornton Wilder's script in a way that must have been rather unsettling to the supposedly more naive audiences of its time.

The America of Alfred Hitchcock harbored for him the possibility of a sort of sunlit horror made all the more frightening by the lovingly applied veneer of peace and normality the film ultimately celebrates. And nowhere within his American output did Hitchcock ever work out this dichotomy so well and to such unnerving effect as he did in this film. Small wonder it was named by him as his favorite--many of the the more baroque preoccupations Hitchcock harbored regarding Eros and Thanatos were never again to be as subtly, and as oddly beautifully realized as they were here.",1397779200,,3655,5.0647840531561465

309737,5,6301065573,"It's one of Hitchcock's classics, so if you're familiar with the Master of Suspense, you've probably seen it or are familiar with it. If you haven't seen it or aren't familiar with Hitchcock, you should see it. I'm not sure what I can say to sell Hitchcock to those who aren't familiar with his work, but if you're the kind of casual movie lover who may have seen Psycho, or North by Northwest, or The Birds, this isn't like those at all, except for the suspense part, and Shadow of a Doubt has that in spades!

If you already own this on DVD and are considering adding this Blu-ray edition to your collection to replace it, I'm not sure that's necessary. I have this on DVD as part of the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection, a 14-disc set available here at Amazon. I compared the picture quality between the two and there was negligible difference, leading me to believe that the transfer used for this Blu-ray release was the same one used for the Masterpiece Collection, which, at the time, was a new remaster. So, unlike the Blu-ray reissue of Psycho that came out a couple of years ago, which WAS a complete remaster (and spectacularly done, too!), this one looks great, but no better really than a recent DVD version that uses a transfer of the remaster done in the last ten years or so. I also believe the extras on the Blu-ray are the same as the ones on the Masterpiece Collection DVD, so that might be another reason to hold off for a bit on purchasing it, unless you don't already have it, of course...

Having said all that, I bought it anyway and will have the DVD as a back up. You might consider purchasing it for similar reasons",1375228800,,1649,4.456953642384106

The screenplay was written by Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson and Alma Reville based on a short story by Gordon Macdonell.

310042,5,6301065573,"""Shadow of a Doubt"" is absolutely one of Hitchcock's best films and as a Hitchcock film fanatic, this praise indeed!!  It is not only a ""Must see"" classic, it is also one of the most perfect films I have ever seen.  Even upon repeated viewing, one is transferred into the story again and again.  And what a story it is!!
There are plenty of reviews that go into specifics about the plot, therefore there is no need for me to do that.  This review is intended to encourage persons who either stay away from black and white movies or who may like Hitchcock but have never seen this film.
""Shadow of a Doubt"" is one of those perfect movies that actually improves upon repeated viewing.  Ms. Wright and Mr. Corey are wonderful together, Joseph Cotton is uncomfortably sinister only when most effective, the entire cast seem perfect for each individual role and even the child actors are totally believable and perform their part so well, the fact that they are acting rarely if ever enters one's mind.
This is also one of those rare movies that adults can watch with their children or around them.  The subject matter is certainly serious, but the full force and understanding of it is subtle; though effective, nothing remotely offensive is ever on screen or heard.  Therefore, there is no reason to suspend viewing until even very young children are absent
My mother introduced this movie to me when I was quite young, I loved it from the first moment and that feeling has only increased!!",1349481600,,1487,4.652671755725191
310106,5,6301065573,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

Said by director Sir Alfred Hitchcock himself & co-star Teresa Wright to be their favourite movie, Shadow Of A Doubt is an engrossing suspense thriller that has an air of ambiguity to it concerning one of the main characters, and like Rope, it's a matter of finding out WHEN the perpetrator will be caught as well as finding out WHY the suspect is on the run. And the answers are revealed as only the Master Of Suspense can: slowly building towards it and then cleverly revealing it in a shocking manner. The film begins cautiously, drawing you in and then never letting go until the final image fades from the screen. Very well acted, superbly written and expertly directed suspense drama.

I recommend this movie.

310107,5,6301065573,"I am a long-time fan of Hitchcock, but somehow had overlooked this gem until recently. I count it as one of his best. As the name implies, the interplay of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) is prominent. Little action, but the tension builds and builds, keeping you guessing. A must see for any Hitchcock follower!",1345593600,,311,4.777777777777778
310108,3,6301065573,"I rate this movie 3 stars because it's a Hitchcock film and any Hitchcock film bears the hallmark of the master's obsession with detail and cinematography.  But frankly, this film needs tremendous sript editing and re-write (not to mention better acting, but the actors don't have a lot to work with).

 The characters just stand there and give little stock speechs.  ""I am X character revealing y about myself.  I will now give a speech to demonstrate that.""  Uncle Charlie is supposed to be a charming psychopath whom no one would suspect is actually a serial murderer.  Then he sits at the dinner table  -- not even laughing or saying it in a way that suggests a joke -- with a dark murderous look on his face saying ""widows are fat pigs who spend all their dead husband's money and you know what we do with fat pigs.""  WTF??  Why not just say ""I'm the merry widow murderer""??  How does this fit with a ""growing and menacing"" suspicion that he's not who he appears to be?  There's supposed to be a ""shadow of a doubt"" that something is wrong with this guy-- not a sledgehammer hit on the head.  Same with all the other characters.

Furthermore, you couldn't just drive a truck through the plot holes of this movie -- you could fly a fleet of 747s.  Why does Uncle Charlie, who is so afraid he'll be recognized as the ""merry widow"" murderer that he destroys a newspaper so the family won't see a story about the murders -- hand out as presents expensive objects that belonged to the women he killed -- including a fabulous emerald ring with the dead woman's initials engraved on it!!! (which he has to explain away).  Then the niece goes out on a date with the detective who is stalking her uncle and  he never seems to notice that this ordinary middle-class girl (they make the point that the family is ""average"" and middle-class continually,  the detective himself says it) is wearing what looks like a $50,000 emerald ring!  If he had asked to look at the ring the whole case would have been solved instantly.  And we know that it's immediately identifiable as real because a waitress in a different scene notices the ring at first sight (clearly a whole lot sharper than the detective!) and comments that she can ialways tell that something like that is real.

It goes and on and on.  They're just about to catch Uncle Charlie via the identification of a photograph, then they hear that another possible suspect has been killed while fleeing the police so clearly the other guy must be the murderer (why???) and they just drop the whole identification thing.

And of course, at the very end, the detective, who has introduced himself to the family as someone taking a survey in order to weasel out information about Uncle Charlie, is obviously going to marry the niece.  Since the whole point of the story is that the the girls mother (the murderer's sister) must be protected from any knowledge of her brother's crimes (""it would kill her"") how is that they're going to explain that this guy who has been hanging around the house for weeks posing as a survey taker is actually a detective?

None of this horrible script or pile of plot holes is necessary to the movie.  About an hour's good re-write could have cleaned up everything.  Have no idea why it wasn't done but it detracts so badly from the movie that at some point you are just laughing.",1340496000,,3355,4.557595993322204
310109,5,6301065573,"Hitchcock delivers suspense in the meticulous style that would become his trademark.  Brilliant casting and writing make this thriller one of Hitchcock's most memorable. The  plot and characters have been well-decscribed  in other reviews, and I would only add some things about the film that stand out for me:

I especially liked how Hitchcock  uses mundane details of middle-class American life and manners to create ambiance and tone. The location shooting in Shadow of a Doubt was still not yet common at this time in Hollywood film: from the gritty opening street scenes in Newark( representing Philadelphia) to the idyllic small town of Santa Rosa, Hitchcock uses the locations as well as any studio set. Look at the extras and scenery and how people dress and walk, all captured seamlessly by Hitchcock as part of the story.

Small touches of humor abound like the early scene at home with the bookworm younger sister lying on the floor, and reading a book while eating an apple; and then putting her half-eaten apple on the carpeted floor while she goes to answer the phone. Or Mrs Newton earnestly explaining about mixing ingredients for a cake to an exasperated detective masquerading as a pollster.
Also, listen  carefully to the dialoque, particularly at the Newton household with people talking over each other. And, trailing conversations that often come from out of camera shot which adds to the genuine feeling of family life with its informality and bustle of children.

I could go on and on as there are so many different aspects about this film to enjoy. Simply said, Hitchcock at the top of his form.",1335916800,,1620,4.930147058823529

This is one of those slow going movies that demands you watch it. You won't see things blowing up . . . . You won't see dramatic fight scenes. You see people acting with bare minimum props. It is almost theatre like.

But it was that era where we were leaving the Greta-Garbo-like movies where people were putting their wrists to their foreheads as if they were going to faint and the men were well painted in the face with makeup to more realistic acting and movie sets. This movie was kinda stuck in the middle of the two opposites. It showed real people and a real setting but the overly dramatic music was over the top. It was annoying.

The ending was annoying. I couldn't tell if they were trying to make this unpredictable or if they just didn't know when to stop. I saw about two endings that would have made this a fine movie. But the actual ending was too contrived and I ended up feeling manipulated.

Just as she decides to send him a telegram asking him to visit he sends one saying is on his way to vist. The coincidence strengthens young Charlie's firm belief that her bond with her Uncle is very special.
Uncle Charlie arrives with some extra baggage. Two mysterious men have been trailing him and are trying to get information on Uncle Charlie. Charlie's mother is overcome with joy seeing her beloved brother again. The family is complete and there is talk of Uncle Charlie staying in town permanently. Young Charlie is a pretty smart young lady and as she talks to one of the young men trailing Uncle Charlie, she realizes he is one of the suspects who could be the MERRY WIDOW MURDERER. Things begin to add up as she sees dear sweet Uncle Charlie and his mood swings. Soon she realizes she is in danger.

Hitchock has taken a loving family and added suspense and drama that may shatter their world. Only young Charlie suspects anything is amiss with Uncle Charlie and it becomes her goal to keep his secret, or what she thinks might be his secret. SHADOW A DOUBT was Hitchocks' first film shot on location and not mainly on a sound stage. A real house was the setting and Santa Rosa, CA, a small town at the time, could double for any small town anywhere in America. Hitchock could tell the story of a typical Middle Class American family that most Americans could relate to. Throw in a mysterious relative who could be guilty of the ultimate crime. We know young Charlie's innocence will be destroyed forever but what will the family know about Uncle Charlie.

This is a fun and different Hitchock film. The version I saw had interviews with a delightful Teresa Wright who talks about how wonderful working with Hitchock was and what a great cast there was. Hitchock's daughter also gave a lot of insight into the filming of a SHADOW OF A DOUBT. It's an overlooked HITCHOCK film that all fans should see.",1318204800,,2378,4.566744730679157
310115,4,6301065573,"One of my favorite Hitchcock efforts. What can I say in a review about a suspense flick? As little as possible. Having said that, there's more than one psychopath in that family! Maybe between 3 and 4 stars, because it's a little wooden, owing to the circumstances of the era: pleasing the 1940 American audience, making box office, and framed within the popular attitude of the period. (One fingernails-on-the-chalkboard aspect is the earnest but mechanical performances of the supporting child actors); but the story quickly steamrolls over that with a trainload of plotline ingenuity, even after some ""big reveals."" For film buffs: This is a nice ""museum exhibit"" of perceived American attitudes of the era. Director Hitchcock, an Englishman and family man, lived in Santa Rosa, CA, and has done, IMO, a credible job of preserving small town American attitudes of that time. Special mention to actress Patricia Collinge for her role as the mother. That's a tough part to pull off.",1317168000,,983,5.074074074074074
310196,5,6301065573,"This is one of Hitchcock's more dazzling if often overlooked films.  Its setting, like those in ""Dial M for Murder"" and ""Rear Window,"" is domestic and thus deceptively pedestrian.  Hitchcock draws us into the scenario by introducing us to a ""typical"" 1940's family in a picturesque California town.  Here we meet the sensible, level-headed 20-year-old centerpiece daughter, the heartwarming if credulous middle-aged mother, the wisecracking brainy-brat prepubescent sibling, the father-and-neighbor True Detective fanatics.  Enter visiting Uncle Charlie, a charming sociopath with a passion for marrying and murdering rich grande dames--and voila!--you have a masterpiece.  Tiny inconsistencies in Uncle Charlie's behavior cause a gradually-dawning suspicion to enter the 20-year-old's unwilling head.  Gradually this girl morphs into an amateur detective before the action escalates--and all of a sudden, she's fighting for her life.  Wonderful film, now part of my collection thanks to Amazon.  P.S. Re-watch the film and see how many ""doubles"" you can spot and list throughout (hint: start with the fact that the villain and heroine are both named ""Charlie"").  Then read Donald Spoto's ""The Dark Side of Genius; the Life of Alfred Hitchcock,"" look up this film in the book and see how many Spoto uncovered.

310199,5,6301065573,"I just want to give my thoughts on this movie, as so much has already been said about it...

Shadow Of A Doubt (1943) was Alfred Hitchcock's personal favorite of all the movies he ever made, with Vertigo (1958) coming in second place.  This black and white classic has suspense, psychological depth, a good script, and good acting.  The story was written by Thornton Wilder.  The script is the strong point of this movie.  It's very simple and easy to understand.  Joseph Cotten plays the role of Charles Oakley very well.  He is the uncle of Charlotte ""Charlie"" Newton, played brilliantly by Teresa Wright.  This uncle-niece relationship seems somewhat creepy at times, as if these two relatives are too close but not quite ""crossing the line"", if you will.  When Charlie discovers her uncle's dark secrets, it sort of saddens and disappoints me because on the one hand it's nice to see an uncle and niece so close, but on the other hand I realize that this relationship needs to go sour due to his dark secrets and their somewhat creepy and close relationship.

Teresa Wright dominates this movie with her good looks and outstanding acting.  The ending of the movie is very good.  The musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin is pretty decent.

I can see why this was Hitchcock's personal favorite movie he made.  It deserves the praise it has gotten over the years, even though it's still somewhat underrated because it seldom ranks among movies that are considered his VERY best, such as Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North By Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), and The Birds (1963).

This DVD comes with good extras, including the documentary Beyond Doubt: The Making Of Hitchcock's Favorite Film, production photographs, production drawings, the theatrical trailer, and more.  The DVD is in full screen.

All in all, this is a good Hitchcock movie.  I highly recommend it.",1303171200,,1874,4.895238095238096
310200,5,6301065573,"I had just finished reading a book on Alfred Hitchcock which lists all his movies. This is a great movie, the actors are excellent. I highly recommend it especially if you like black and white movies, and old fashioned suspense",1302566400,,227,4.7
310201,5,6301065573,This is undoubtably one of the best movies most people have never seen.  Hitchcock says it was the best movie he made - I have to agree.,1293667200,,136,4.037037037037037

310203,2,6301065573,"Alfred Hitchcock said that this was his favorite among his films but, after having seen it for the third or fourth time, I still cannot see why. Hitchcock often stated in interviews that his greatest enjoyment in making films was the working out of the details beforehand and that he often wished he didn't have to actually make the picture.  This film and some of his others, particularly in the writing and acting departments, clearly demonstrate that.

Joseph Cotten's performance as ""Uncle Charlie"" is wooden and even the dinner conversation about the fat widows ""eating the money and drinking the money"" of their dead husbands  lacks conviction.  Patricia Collinge, superb in ""The Little Foxes"" of 1941, is merely annoying here given the inane lines she is burdened with.  Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn ""humorously"" and endlessly discussing different types of murder is silly.  Worst of all are the fatal performances of the two child actors portraying Teresa Wright's younger sister and  brother who manage to drag down every scene they appear in.  All these are things Mr. Hitchcock should not have allowed to get away from him, especially when one considers the excellence of earlier pictures such as ""Rebecca"" and ""Foreign Correspondent"".

The scenes involving the missing newspaper page, Teresa Wright's race to get to the library before it closes and her close call with asphyxiation, all intended to generate great suspense, tend to fall flat.  This picture betrays the same weaknesses as ""Saboteur"", made the year before for the same studio.  The same weaknesses in acting and writing also show up, but to a lesser extent, in ""Spellbound"", ""Rope"", ""I Confess""  and ""Stage Fright"" the last of which is saved only by the droll performance of Alastair Sim.

Alfred Hitchcock really comes into his own in the early 1950's beginning with ""Strangers on a Train"" (1951) and ending with ""The Birds"" (1961) -- films which comprise a body of work that has deservedly won praise from movie-lovers throughout the world.",1270944000,,2020,5.066465256797583
310204,5,6301065573,"Hitchcock's favorite Hitchcock according to Hitchcock.  Over-the-top performances by Teresa Wright (on a loss-of-innocence journey) and Joseph Cotton (on the run as a serial killer who is also a close family relative).  There is a play-off between melodrama and suspense that just keeps building.  Up to the last few reels, doubt lingers as to who really is the serial killer (the script could go in at least two directions).  Film score by Dimitri Tiomkin is a knockout underlining and amplifying the unrelenting tension.  Hitchcock experimented with overlapping and simultaneous dialog to good (often amusing) effect.  There are a few plot discrepancies (such as an apparently free telegram service and detectives who prefer to do just about anything except make an arrest); Hitchcock's continuing fixation on trains (coming and going); and an exaggerated, station-platform shadow ""cast"" by an arriving train (carrying Cotton's character into the small town where Wright's character and her family live).  Film restoration is outstanding.  So are the extras.

 A white-knuckle ride from beginning to end!

310205,4,6301065573,"Charles Oakley (Joseph Cotten) is being followed by a couple of mysterious men so he decides to visit his sister's family out west in Santa Rosa, California.  His niece Charlotte Newton (Teresa Wright), who was named after ""Uncle Charlie,"" is especially happy about his visit.  But a couple of journalists who've picked the Newton family for a survey of the ""average American family"" seem to make Uncle Charlie nervous.  One of them reveals to ""young Charlie"" that they're actually detectives who suspect her uncle of being a notorious serial killer called the ""Merry Widow Murderer.""  Uncle Charlie's strange behavior makes young Charlie suspicious as well.

Nominated for an Academy Award in 1943, ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is considered to be one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest films (he often said it was his favorite among his American films).  According to Patrick McGilligan's biography&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfred-Hitchcock-A-Life-in-Darkness-and-Light/dp/0060988274/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light</a>&nbsp;this is what Hitchcock called a ""run for cover"" film, similar to his later ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-by-Northwest/dp/0790749815/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North by Northwest</a>,"" one of my favorites.

I've been trying to gradually watch all of Hitchcock's movies and I'm always impressed by how skillfully he creates and heightens suspense through the story, sometimes while providing subtle humor at the same time; young Charlie's father (Henry Travers, who later played Clarence in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-a-Wonderful-Life/dp/B000HEWEJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's a Wonderful Life</a>"") share's a keen interest in crime stories with a neighbor, Herbie (Hume Cronyn in his debut), and the two constantly discuss ways to commit the perfect crime, often in front of Uncle Charlie.",1268697600,,2381,6.809210526315789

Although the dialog many times seems dated, the suspense is still there and Cotten puts in a wonderful performance as Uncle Charlie, the lovable uncle who may be a very sinister character.  My understanding is that this was Hitchcocks personal favorite movie.

For this DVD, the picture quality is excellent, possibly because it is black and white.  There is an informative but short featurette that details the filming of the movie and not much else.",1268611200,,607,4.788461538461538

310319,5,6301065573,"A fascinating peek into pre-war small-town Middle America, Hitchock creates a scathing commentary on the white gingerbread houses and the little games people make to keep themselves amused.

One such girl is Charlie, who is bored to tears with her life, same-old, same-old, as we would say.  Her mother is a gossip and meticulous about the house and kitchen.  Her father and is brother in law love to make up murderous plots about to kill each other, all in fun and ""to relax.""  ""See this mushroom?  Add a toadstool or two and you'd be dead!""

She gets the idea to contact her uncle Charlie by telegram to come out to Santa Rosa, California.  At the same time, Uncle Charlie (her mother's brother) decides to get out of the East as he is being followed by two detectives.

As with the audience, we are just as puzzled as Charlie.  Is Uncle Charlie actually a serial killer?  As we follow his adventures we come to believe he just may be!

Particularly chilling is his speech at the dinner table about rich widows who take all the money their husbands had worked all their lives to accumulate, and just like the fat animals they are, should be taken out and slaughtered.  Whoa!

Charlie is convinced and her uncle creates various ""accidents"" to put her out of the way permanently as he realizes she knows he may be the Merry Widow murderer.

Based on an actual killer of the times, Hitchcock expertly weaves a tale of suspicion and leads his audience to the final conclusion with purpose and darkness.

Some trivia:

It's fun seeing Santa Rosa here, as I don't live much further than 100 miles from the place, currently a major town in Northern California.  Hitchcock found just the right house for his film, but he loved the run-down look.  The occupants cleaned the place up and gave it a new paint job to Hitchcock's chagrin (which he then had his men return it to its rundown condition!).

Shadow of a Doubt was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Story, Gordon McDonell.

And Joseph Cotten is amazing as the evil uncle Charlie, who you can see that he sincerely loves his family, he has no intention of getting caught and will go to any means to prevent that.  He can't help but say things that lead one to suspicion.

When Charlie starts avoiding him as she finds out more and more about her uncle, the tension builds and the accusations fly.

It is also said to be one of Alfred Hitchcock's most favorite films.  You got to see this!

The DVD collection I borrowed from also has some cool behind the scenes from the original actors, including Teresa Wright (Charlie), who unfortunately died soon after this, in 2005.

Shadow of a Doubt was remade in 1958 as Step Down to Terror and again as a TV movie in 1991 also called Shadow of a Doubt, both of which I have not see.  Regardless, love the original!

A great cast is worth repeating:

I know there's nothing wrong with my DVD player and upon closer inspection of the DVD, it doesn't have the familiar silvery reflective surface, characteristic of a commercially produced DVD, but a purple coloration, characteristic of a home burned DVD.

It lacks the glamour quotient of, say, north by Northwest or It Takes a Thief, which may have something to do with it. But Hitchcock's at his best when he's layering trait upon trait in a character and slipping little ""tells"" into the story, and he's superb at that here.

The story's simple: A black sheep uncle settles down with his sister's family in a small California town, much to the joy of his teenage niece. Soon, though, she begins to notice something odd about her beloved Uncle Charlie. Hitchcock never makes the mistake of too much information, and tosses cliffhanger after cliffhanger into the final 30 minutes.

In fact the theme of the killer masquerading as a suave, likeable gent was a first for cinema---and Hitchcock was the innovator of this theme which would be repeated many times later in other films. Although one reviewer complained that the identity of the ""Merry Widow"" killer is revealed earlier in the film--I believe was Hitchcock was wise in letting us in on it because what was suspenseful about the film was how far the killer would go to conceal his identity--and to what extent he would do to kill his niece.  Joseph Cotton would never have a role like this with so much psychological depth and Teresa Wright, who recently passed on, was perfectly suited as the heroine who knows the ugly truth. Also the literate screenplay by Thorton Wilder also added to make this a screen classic--no wonder Hitchcock listed this as his favorite American film.",1258156800,,1074,4.836956521739131

Bon Voyage & Adventure Malgache are two of the rarest Alfred Hithcock productions ever made.  It's funny becuase as most people know, Hitchcock was British born and alot of his earlier films were made there.  However, these two rare gems were made for the French Resistance as moral boosters when they were fighting the Nazi's during their occupation of France.

Adventure Malgache is a flash back story about a now actor who ran a underground radio station and dodged the Nazi's during the occupation.  Bon Voyage is about a Scottish RAF gunner who has escaped his Nazi captors.  He learns about the people that helped him and who they may have been working for.

310378,2,6301065573,"Shadow of a Doubt has the benefit of being written by Thornton Wilder, based on a real story, and starring Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright, so why is it so dull? Just one year earlier Wright shined in ""Pride of the Yankees"" and shortly after this film she would win everyone's heart for her role in ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" Cotten was a mainstay in Orson Welles' players, had just finished ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons,"" and was at the top of his game. So what went wrong? Difficult to know. For one thing, the masculine hero, Macdonald Carey, is relatively weak. So we're left with Wright, who was a great actress, but as the heroine and prime mover, she's not awe inspiring (Hitchcock would find his tough female stars years later in Tippi Hedron, Grace Kelly, and Doris Day).

(BTW - Wright got her big break in the Broadway production of Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town"". Wilder was the writer for this film and convinced Hitch to use Wright. The film itself was, according to Hitch, a negative image of Wilder's ""Our Town"" so the placement of Wright in both was ironic)

Hitchcock is an acquired taste, and many of his signature techniques that worked so well in other movies are missing here (e.g., the unusual photographic angles, the average day things that take on a menacing purpose). Indeed, Hitchcock only begins to show his great form in 1944's ""Lifeboat"" and then in the 1950s (""Rear Window"", ""Dial M for Murder"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"") when, IMHO, his best films were made.

In summary this is an interesting film from the point of view of Hitchcock's development as a director, but as a stand alone film, it really doesn't have much to recommend it. When it opened it received mixed reviews and did poorly at the box office.

BTW - Hitch appears 18 minutes into the film as a card player on a train.",1248566400,,1840,4.583586626139818
310379,5,6301065573,"I watched this film in astonishment:  not only does it have psychological depth that is in no other Hitchcock film,  but the sense of dread in it builds slowly and inexorably to a frightening climax.  The best part of this by far is Teresa Wright's performance, as the intelligent child who enters adulthood as she sees a terrible truth she cannot deny.  I was utterly riveted by her introspective performance and natural beauty.

The story is that a serial killer, Cotton, decides to hide at his sister's house, far away from his hunting ground in the northeast. It is clear that he is the killer from the very beginning, so there is no suspense about that. Once in CA, he meets his sister and his niece, Charlie, both of whom adore him.  However, it becomes clear that neither of them recognizes him for what he is:  a sociopath and con man on his last desperate run.

The emotional center is Teresa Wright, who cannot ignore her suspicions at his strange yet simple behavior.  Not only does she observe him, but he makes cryptic and frightening utterances to her that seem to reveal what he really is underneath.

The most amazing thing is that nothing much really happens.  And yet a sense of menace and terror grows until it is undeniable.  This makes it the best kind of psychological thriller:  most of the development is internal, as revealed by the body language of Wright, in her perfect acting.  Cotton too is great, a creepy presence who emerges from the shadows now and then, whose actions occur almost entirely offstage.  Of course, young Charlie's parents and siblings form the perfect backdrop, normal people unaware of the drama going on inside of her, yet curiously reflecting the mind of the older Charlie, who is charming the entire town.  Wright wants to protect all of them from the truth as it dawns on her, a grief that will mark her and her alone for the rest of her life.

Highest recommendation.  No wonder this is Hitchcock's favorite of all his films.",1246579200,,1980,4.6570605187319885

His niece, Charlie the Younger if you will, is also excellent as the girl who almost falls in love with her long lost Uncle only to grow increasingly suspicious of this handsome but truly odd man.

Cotton, as it turns out, is a serial killer, having killed at least three wealthy widows for their money.  But, to my way of thinking, the most fascinating part of his portrayal is not that he is an oily con man but, in many ways, he's exactly the opposite.  He's idiosyncratic to the extreme with an extraordinarily crabbed view of life in general and especially, from his point of view, parasitic heiresses who deserve no more than extermination.

His niece becomes increasingly alarmed at her Uncle's philosophy although she doesn't want to believe the worst.  The film is largely about her coming to grips with a painful reality and what both she and her Uncle do about it.  Fascinating.  Did I say I liked it?

Some people avoid Hitchcock because some of his movies are slow. This film however, does not have that problem.

The film-noir element is wonderfully orchestrated. An older Charlie transforms his niece's (also named Charlie) world into a dark and sinister place. The uncle doesn't do this through violence, which is what makes the movie so captivating. Instead, his niece is horrified as she gradually realizes who her uncle is.

The directing of course, is amazing. Check out the light and shadow shots. Classic film-noir.

310463,5,6301065573,"Hitchcock is hatching in the US while the war is dragging along. He is building a tight little plot around a small criminal who gets into some serial killing of rich widows in New York or somewhere back East just because he likes money, because he does not like working at all, and because he hates these women who are wasting the money they inherited instead of giving it to someone like him who would make a better use of it since that would prevent him from working ever and forever and might even enable him to open some small business to cover up the bag of green backs. He is on the run. He escapes from the East and moves to California where his sister lives with her family. But the cops are on his tracks and they get quite close. One manages to capture the attention and care of the oldest girl of the family who is over eighteen in order to arrange with her the leaving of the uncle so that he is arrested out of the city. The uncle, the murderer as you have guessed, understands his niece has gotten through the cloud of mystery and has put two and two together and that it does make four in her head. So he has to get rid of her but he fails probably more out of lack of luck than anything else. But the luck of one is the lack of luck of the ether and vice versa. And during that time our uncle is courting the city and becoming some kind of glorious visitor on the music of some Merry Widow. The end is not going to be what he wanted it to be since he will not be able to leave the town but he will not remain at the surface of it either because he will nicely take residence is some kind of wooden underground chamber six feet under. You really feel the growing pains of Hitchcock under this little film that is probably already definitely too small for the big man who is inhabiting it. But he still has a few years to go before getting in the big shoes he deserves.

Charlie (Teresa Wright) plays a young woman who ""hero worships"" her namesake: Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten).

Young Charlie feels her life in idyllic Santa Rosa, Ca. is boring/humdrum...she commiserates with her father - stating nothing ever happens to their family. She decides to send a telegram to her favorite Uncle asking him to visit. Coincidentally, Uncle Charlie has already sent a telegram stating he is coming for an extended stay. Young Charlie thinks this is another sign that her and her Uncle are on the same wave length as far as their thinking and attitudes. She even states at one pt. that they are like twins. Unbeknownst to  the young woman, her Uncle is not what he seems...he has come to Santa Rosa to escape the police who are searching for him - he is a suspect in the killing of several wealthy widows.

The tension mounts as young Charlie comes to realize her Uncle is not as he appears. She fears for her familys' safety. More importantly, you see her struggle as she comes to grips with the knowledge that Uncle Charley is not the fine, upstanding man she thinks he is. You feel for young Charlie as she realizes her Uncle has severe flaws in character and thinking...and if they are alike - than does that mean she is flawed? Is her judgement in people flawed, since she thought so much of her Uncle?

Several great character actors make appearances in this film. Hume Cronyn, Henry Travers (famous for his portrayal of Clarence the Angel in ""Its a Wonderful Life), Macdonald Carey and Patricia Collinge  give fine performances. Charlie's father played by Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn (next door neighbor) savor their hobby of reading and solving/planning each other's murders - not realizing there is a real murderer in the house. This juxtaposition of a harmless hobby: plotting ea. other's deaths and psychopath Uncle Charlie's attempts to kill his niece make for an interesting study.",1224979200,,2062,4.910919540229885
310469,5,6301065573,"One of the greatest movies of all time!

Featured are two excellent, albeit, greatly underrated actors -- Joseph Cotton and Theresa Wright.

The casting of the movie is spot-on, with every single role, even the very small parts, *perfectly* cast.

Hitchcock is famous for having once said that actors are just so much cattle.  I find that hard to believe -- not hard to beleive that he said but, rather, hard to believe he meant it.  There are any number of actors who have done their best work in Hitchcock films: Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Martin Balsam, Anthony Perkins; and of course Joseph Cotton and Theresa Wright.

From what I gather, quality actors longed to be in a Hitchcok movie because they had great confidence in him.  He knew what he wanted and knew how to get it.  Such confidence in a director must give the entire acting ensemble a tremendous amount of confidence as well; actors, famous or otherwise, being notoriously insecure.

Notice in ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" as is true in all of Hitchcock's movies,
how Hitchcok shocks and frightens and intrigues and mesmerized, but with a minimum of so-called ""action.""  Meaning: no car chases, no shoot 'em ups, no bombastic violence.

Even the famous shower scene in ""Psycho"" is shot-for-shot all referential.  We see the knife, we see Janet Leigh's face, we see the blood, the shower curtain falling -- but we don't see these things in a graphic, haphazard, unstylized way.  Violence in a movie, if it's stylized as well as ""visually indirect,"" becomes something other than violence.  Put another way: everything flows form the director and the actors, the FX crew is marginalized.

Here's the bottom line for ""Shadow of a Doubt."" ... If you don't like this movie, pilgrim, then turn in your popcorn coupon.  This is a good as it gets.",1196899200,,1796,4.782467532467533

When evil comes to town in the embodiment of the beloved Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) it is the perceptive niece Young Charlie (Teresa Wright) that slowly uncovers his true identity as the Merry Widow murderer. Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn spend their evenings concocting ways to commit the perfect murder unknowingly under the watchful eyes of the genuine article. Evil takes many shapes and hides behind many facades in broad daylight. Would the wholesome average American community recognize such evil and be willing to deal with it? These are questions that the transplanted Hitchcock would ask about his new home. Another transplant, Dimitri Tiomkin, composed a brilliant score utilizing American idioms laced with the darkness of the tainted soul. This remains one of Hitchcock's best films since it works, as a thriller yet remains a true reflection of a good-natured but generally complacent lifestyle.

As the film opens, we meet the debonair Charles Oakley (Cotten). Oakley is seen lying atop his bed, smoking and pensively staring up at the ceiling, trying to come to some sort of decision. The atmosphere in the room is suffused with unease. The skyline outside the window is Newark, New Jersey.

We then cut to Charlotte ""Charlie"" Newton (Wright), who likewise is lying atop her bed and staring thoughtfully up at the ceiling. The atmosphere is suffused with dissatisfaction. The town outside the window is Santa Rosa, California.

Young Charlie and Old Charlie are niece and uncle, and share an almost psychic bond. Young Charlie is chafing at the ordinariness of life in her small town. Old Charlie is chafing at a troubling and unusual situation in his life. Young Charlie decides to spice things up by inviting her uncle, a world traveler, to Santa Rosa, and sends him a telegram. Old Charlie decides to take up a more bland and mundane lifestyle and sends his niece a telegram telling her he will be arriving in Santa Rosa very shortly. Thus do innocence and worldliness collide.

When Old Charlie arrives, the family, especially Young Charlie, is ecstatic, but as the story slowly, deliberately, unfolds, it becomes clear that Old Charlie is hiding a dark secret. The mystery deepens when MacDonald Carey comes to town, showing an exaggerated interest in the Newton family. As it turns out, Charles Oakley certainly is hiding something, a something his adoring niece quickly discovers. Although she swears to keep his secret, Old Charlie prefers not to take any chances, and his niece and namesake soon begins to suffer a series of potentially deadly accidents. One of these accidents finally has results.

Cotten and Wright play off each other well as the close-bonded Charlies. Cotten is utterly contemptuous of Wright's innocence. She at first wishes she could shed her small-town ingenuousness, but then begins to realize how central it is to her conception of the good life. Cotten was known for his ""bad guys,"" while the Academy Award-winning Wright is remembered as a serious actress devoted to playing only meaningful female roles in the sexist 1940s (her studio contract had a rider refusing 'cheesecake').
The Twenty-Something Wright is at the peak of her powers and reaches her highest standards in SHADOW OF A DOUBT.

Hitch himself appears as a card-playing passenger on a train, and the film is also notable as Hume Cronyn's film debut as a lighthearted neighbor who enjoys trading ideas on how to commit murder with Young Charlie's otherwise button-down Dad.

The pacing is a bit slow for a 200___ audience, but this moderately noir film is certainly worth enjoying.",1190592000,,2930,5.016460905349795
310525,4,6301065573,"This 1943 thriller from the master of suspense features Joseph Cotton as 'Uncle Charlie' and Teresa Wright as 'Young Charlie'. Cotten having made 'The Magnicent Ambersons' and 'Citizen Kane' with Orsen Welles in the previous two years was early in his career (Shadow of a Doubt was only his 5th film) proving to be a versatile and subtle actor.

Arriving to visit his family in California, Uncle Charlie is very popular with all the family, especially 'Young Charlie'. Hitchcock of course is very clever and allows Joseph Cotten to drop a few hints of his posible sinister side. But maybe its a double bluff from the master of suspense. There are many trademark Hitchcock moments, a few lovely set pieces. In fact early in the film he uses a shot that would be recreated in Psycho 18 years later.

The script is very good and the cast matches it most of the time with classy acting. Just occasionally I felt that the acting was a little wooden. I couldn't tell you where it happened, which is good because this means I'll have to watch the film again.

""Shadow of a Doubt"" (1943), the story of a serial murderer as a loving uncle is the movie which Hitchcock himself had declared as his favorite. This movie is quite a departure from Hitchcock's previous Hollywood productions. For the first half, it is an intimate family dramedy that describes a typical American family in a typical small town, USA which in this film is called Santa Rosa, CA. Hitch said about the movie, ""I am extremely anxious to avoid the conventional small-town American scene and the stock figures that have been seen in so many films."" Much of the film was shot on location in a real California small town far away from the studio. The director worked closely with the famous writer Thornton Wilder on the screen (Oscar nomination) about a charming attractive young man (Joseph Cotten) who after many years comes to Santa Rosa to visit with the family of his older sister whom he truly loved. He brings into the lives of his relatives, especially his older niece and namesake Charlie (Teresa Wright) excitement and joy. Soon things begin look puzzling and even grim when two undercover detectives from a big city on the East Coast show up in Santa Rosa and reveal to Charlie who by the words of her father, ""has brains"" and the power of observation that her beloved uncle Charlie may be an infamous ""Merry Widows murderer"" on the run. The girl does not want to believe the detectives but she can't help noticing her uncle's strange behavior, his sudden and scary mood changes. The inscription on a gorgeous emerald ring he gave her as a gift makes her think of a previous owner of the pricey jewelry. She grows increasingly suspicious of the uncle who loves his niece but he loves his freedom much, much more...Unbearable tension builds up, leading to the series of accidents and to hair-raising climax in the best traditions of Hitchcock's movies.",1175644800,,1913,4.779456193353474

310530,5,6301065573,"A film of subtleties and evil in plain sight, Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt is a slow moving character study of young ""Charlie,"" the namesake niece of elegant but sinister uncle Charles.  Formerly of Philadelphia, his visit to a younger sister in California is the kind of long visit by a relative everyone dreads in hindsight. Situated and contrasted by the light and seeming perfect American middle class small town of Petaluma, suave Charles Oakley (Joseph Cotten) is all fine suits and manners of a bachelor gentleman.

Wholesome Theresa Wright is ""Young Charlie,"" an average, and purposeless young woman whose guileless world has bored her by its failure to have meaning, although she is the cause. As a member of a family where everyone talks over one another without heeding, the kids prattle, the wife babbles, and the family's men persist in mindless discussions over how to plot a murder effectively as family dinner conversation, somehow this oddness is translated as the norm in Hitchcock's interpretation of small town America. It is a film of many dialogues, however, only one voice is audible without interruption: Uncle Charles. His dinner table monologue is most menacing as he describes the ""useless, fat, women"" who he sees as less than human and deserving of death. Until this moment, young Charlie had idolized her uncle until doubt is created by a detective played by MacDonald Cary.  One of two detectives on a national hunt for the ""Merry Widow"" serial murderer, they have tracked the suspicious Uncle Charles across country to his unsuspecting sister's home and family. Once the seeds of doubt are sown, Charlie's dreamlike idealization of her perfect uncle and his world becomes shattered by her suspicion. Charlie no longer can fantasize about her dreamy uncle who she has erotic longings that can never be consummated. Once he realizes his charade is over, Uncle Charles rips away the curtain of sleepwalking in Charlie's perfect world with terrible  consequence.  The perfect world is not a nice place as Charlie's revelation is made all the more grusome through her uncle's warped eyes. As the evil grows more apparent, Charlie attempts to shield her storybook family by keeping them ignorant of his murderous past, but is it at a cost to her own happiness and life?

Hitchcock acknowledged the film was his personal favorite and it defines the notions of suspense, noir, and thriller without blood or visual carnage. A literate script by Thorton Wilder (Our Town) alludes to violence that is only suggested never seen.  Through the physical presence of the brilliant character actor, Joseph Cotton (Citizen Kane, Portrait of Jennie), the menace and diabolic threat to the snow white, virginal Theresa Wright is alluded in eye, body language, and especially his hands. Sophisticated and cerebral, Hitch was playing with audiences creating a masterpiece of normalcy and idealized family values under a looming presence that cast a shadow of a doubt.

Then there's Dad's creepy pal, Hume Cronvn, with various recipes for poison.  A young bespectacled sister and goofy little brother complete the family circle.  Indeed, Wright is just off the set from her Mrs. Miniver performance.  The virginal attitudes, the very real naivet of 1940's small town, middle class girlhood never to be seen again, contrasts with the, ah, insertion of evil.

Uncle Charlie shows up, the beloved, world traveling, younger brother of weepy mom.  Actually, he's on the lam because his apparent wealth is accumulated after affairs with wealthy widows.  Since these women had ended up in the morgue, the young detective, Macdonald Carey is on Joseph Cotton's trail.  To get information, Carey romances Wright to get the goods on the Uncle.  Hence, a confusing romance ensues, but can she give the detective information on her mother's favorite.  It gets easier as Wright starts to get the picture.

This is Hitch's first American production and he certainly seems to enjoy the more expensive production values.  The town of Santa Rosa literally pulls all the stops for the fat man. In those days, folks lived a block from the town business center.  This is the same area where today there are crumbling buildings and high crime rates.

310608,5,6301065573,"Teresa Wright truly shines in Hitchcock's tale of darkness and evil coming to stay in Santa Rosa, California. A story by Gordon McDonnell was adapted for the screen by Thorton Wilder, Alma Reville, and Sally Benson and this slice of Americana is played out perfectly by a wonderful cast.

Teresa Wright is the bored young daughter of Emma (Patricia Collinge) and Joseph (Henry Travers) Newton. Life for her in the small town of Santa Rosa has become boring for the wholesome American girl. Wright's ""Charlie"" is the picture of lovely innocence that matches her small town.

The change she desires to shake things up comes to town in the form of her namesake, Uncle Charle (Joseph Cotten). Hitchcock has shown the audience that something is not quite right for the charming Uncle Charlie, however. But the special bond between he and Charlie will not be broken easily. Their unusual connection is explored in the happy and charming moments after Cotten's arrival.

Charlie's adoration of her uncle borders on a crush and leaves her open and vulnerable to anything Charlie wants. Hitchcock creates some almost uncomfortable scenes as you get the feeling any moment Cotton might just take the smiling and adoring Charlie in his arms and kiss her. And Charlie might remain passive if he were to do so, unsure of her feelings.

But strange behavior in her uncle and the attentions of a government agent after him who falls in love with her will change everything and break Uncle Charlie's spell, revealing a warped and twisted view of the world. The tune he whistles is the key to what Charlie has become in the years he has been absent.

Hume Cronyn steals every scene he is in as Joseph's good pal and mystery lover, Herbie. Their long talks on the porch as the two attempt to devise the perfect murder plays in humorous contrast to the real evil right under their noses. Even once Charlie knows about her uncle she can not tell and destroy her weak mother. But she has Agent Jack Graham's (Macdonald Carey) number and may have to use it when Uncle Charlie realizes the only thing standing between he and the gallows is young Charlie.

This is both a beautiful portrait of small-town America and a suspenseful thriller. Cotten underplays his role to marvelous effect and Teresa Wright is simply wonderful in this Hitchcock masterpiece. A film that must be seen by all.",1147737600,,2365,4.784313725490196
310609,5,6301065573,"Many thanks to the reviews here by S. Whear, Arlan Ebel, and Mickey Moose 15. This is amazon reviewing at its best. Read those three in their entireties.

What stands out for me after watching this movie is the seductive and wholesome portrayal of Santa Rosa. Time has also given this film nostalgic value, deepening the American romance with small-town life. The details all work to make us feel comfortable in this town, down to the traffic cop who knows the names and whereabouts of everyone who lives in his town, the severe but helpful librarian, the lovely white house with its big porch and lawns, and the dinner scenes where all the (girl) children help their mother serve the mashed potatoes. The further we move in time from this movie, the more powerful its image of innocence becomes. The contribution of co-writer Thornton Wilder (Our Town) is very evident here.

The perfection of the location makes the arrival of Uncle Charley (played brilliantly by Joseph Cotten) all the more ominous. Ominous is what this movie is really good at. Outside of Santa Rosa all is confusion, as shown when a panicky Young Charlie is unable to locate her rescuer (the detective Jack Graham) at any of the addresses he's left with her. The ties between Santa Rosa and the rest of America remain tenuous. In the end, the battle between good and evil does seem to get resolved, but an allusion to the ""crazy world"" outside of Santa Rosa in the last scene, reminds us that this resolution is not meant to be felt as final. There is a ""ghost world"" outside the comfort of Santa Rosa that is its physical double, just as Uncle Charley shadows Young Charlie. It's in that world where the film significantly begins even if it's not where it ends.

In sum, that beautiful white house has both a front stairs and a back one. It's hard to forget seeing the shadowy figure of Uncle Charley through the window to those back stairs, which also become Young Charlie's preferred way in; it's because he knows that she will use them that her uncle is almost able to kill her on those stairs.",1147392000,,2070,4.619565217391305
310610,4,6301065573,"Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, a film celebrated as one of his best motion picture projects made in America, had its origins in the killing spree of the true `Merry Widow' murderer Earle Leonard Nelson. Nelson murdered twenty people, including an eight-month old child, in just a year and a half before he was captured in Canada and hanged for his crimes.

Having made himself a household name with his career defining performance in Orson Welles's celebrated motion picture drama Citizen Kane, Joseph Cotton was just the marquee lead actor Alfred Hitchcock needed to fill the role of Uncle Charlie, a man who hides a dark secret. He is a cunning and manipulative individual, whose near-fatal bicycle accident as a child left with a permanent mental scar, viewing the world with hostility and fear. One can even go so far as to suggest that Uncle Charlie is the American equivalent of Satan, Prince of Darkness. After attending Church, the young Charlie is confronted outside by her uncle, ""How was church, Charlie? Count the house? Turn anybody away?"" ""No,"" she exclaims, ""room enough for everyone"". ""I'm glad hear that,"" he retorts, ""Show's been running such a long time, I thought maybe attendance might be falling off"". Regardless of the `twin-ship' they share together, the opposing sides of the two Charlies can be seen clearly in this regard.

The balance between good and evil is a prime subject of Shadow of a Doubt, exemplified through the director's perpetual use of pairs - the two Charlies, the two detectives, the two 'questionnaire' men, the two church scenes, the two garage scenes, the two train sequences (as Uncle Charlie arrives in Santa Rosa and then departs), the two attempts on young Charlie's life, the two murder suspects, and, most cleverly of all, the 'Til Two Bar.

Hume Cronyn made his motion picture debut as the collective mother's boy Herbie Hawkins in Shadow of a Doubt. Additionally the film sparked a lasting friendship and partnership with director Alfred Hitchcock who brought him aboard future projects including Lifeboat, Suspense (a 1950s television program Hitchcock was requested to help put together), and Alfred Hitchcock Presents as well as requesting his assistance in contributing to the scripts of Rope and Under Capricorn. Henry Travers is best remembered today as Jimmy Stewart's guardian angel Clarence in Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life. Neither one contributes much in the way of advancing the storyline but they do provide some dark yet still light-hearted humor to the script. Bored with the melancholy of small town American life, they banter about how one might be able to commit the perfect murder, each coming up with more diabolical ways to one-up the other. Herbie is preoccupied with setting a detective novel (leaving clues and the like so as to write a book about his exploits) while Joseph is more obsessed with getting away with murder then producing a book about it. This of course is all the more perfectly ironic given that there is an actual murderer in their midst and they are too absorbed with their `game' that they are too `blind' to see Uncle Charlie for who he really is - the Merry Widow Murderer.

Although it is a shame, a near travesty really, that Shadow of a Doubt should be nominated for an Academy Award in one solitary category, it was at least selected for the category it deserved the most recognition in, Best Original Screenplay. By the time principle photography began on Shadow of a Doubt in 1942 nearly six or seven individual writers had contributed to its screenplay (only four were credited onscreen). Among them were Alma Reville (Hitchcock's wife), Sally Benson (whose later contributions would include Meet Me in St. Louis and Anna and the King of Siam), Gordon McDonell (who came originally came up with the story), and, most famously, Thorton Wilder, playwright of Our Town. Wilder's contributions to the script were arguably the most significant, solidifying the basic superstructure of the storyline which exposed the almost seedy underbelly of this small New England town, a dark side to Grover's Corners if you will.

Surprisingly Alfred Hithcock's Shadow of a Doubt delves into a few unconventional issues. Among them, one often overlooked by modern audiences (a perplexity given that it would have been more noticeable to audiences today then it was back when it was first released), is the incestuous relationship between Uncle Charlie and his young teenage niece who is named after him. Sadly the overwhelming presence of the Hays Office during this time eliminated any prospect other then merely suggesting such a sexually fueled kinship but it is enough to make anyone a bit unnerved, more so when Uncle Charlie's dark `secret' is finally exposed. The scene in which Uncle Charlie gives young Charlie a gift, an emerald ring, despite his niece's objections to being given anything other then his presence at their home, in the privacy of the kitchen is the most evident example of this. This of course means to suggest that two have been betrothed (a suggestion reaffirmed by young Charlie's kid sister who in response to hearing young Charlie hum the `Merry Widow Waltz' to herself, ""Sing at the table and you'll marry a crazy husband""), something which makes the scene in which Uncle Charlie attempts to kill his young niece (the broken stairs, the running car in the garage, and attempting to throw her off a fast-moving train) all the more poignant. In addition, Shadow of a Doubt confronts issues of superstition, among them mental telepathy (young Charlie knowing exactly when Uncle Charlie was coming to visit them in Santa Rosa, California) and bad luck (Joseph's warning to Uncle Charlie not to toss his hat on young Charlie's bed and the green emerald - a sign of bad luck - Uncle Charlie gives to his niece).

Shadow of a Doubt is one of the select few Hitchcock productions in the time leading up to and after the United States' entry into World War II that he chose not comment, allusively or directly, to the political goings on of the world, although one scene can suggestively be interpreted as making a pointed commentary. Specifically in one scene Uncle Charlie teases Joseph, the young Charlie's father, about working in the bank saying, ""Can you stop embezzling a minute and give me your attention? What's a little shortage in the books at the end of the month? Any good bank clerk can cover up a little shortage, isn't that right, Charlie? We all know what banks are. They look all right to an outsider, but no one knows what goes on when the doors are lock"". This is exactly the sort of material that would have been ripe for censorship during the Hollywood Blacklisting. While director Alfred Hitchcock was concentrated during the 1940s on picking out the evils of Nazism and fascism in Europe, it would be much later in the 1950s when he tackled the political implications of Communism. This could very well be the first instance of this.

Shadow of a Doubt not only stands as one of Alfred Hitchcock's definitive best, but in general in represents solid filmmaking, plain and simple. Carefully orchestrated, leaving no detail untouched, it has intrigue, mystery, dark humor, brilliant performances, and a good ol' slice of hometown Americana which makes it simply irresistible.",1143072000,,7325,4.9504065040650405

310612,5,6301065573,"Shadow of a Doubt proved beyond any doubt what a great filmmaker Hitchcock was. This was released in 1943 after Rebecca and Suspicion, and he confirmed his status as a top U.S. and U.K. filmmaker.

The opening Merry Widow Waltz sequence and music is a recurring theme in the movie, and the acting is superb all the way around.

Teresa Wright established herself as a major star in the 40s in a short time with her great performances in Little Foxes, Pride of the Yankees, and her Oscar winning role in Mrs. Miniver. She excels here as Charley (named for her uncle Charlie), as she grows from excitement over her uncle's visit to gradual suspicion of him. And will not divulge the ending, but it is exciting and a bit unconventional for its time.

Joseph Cotten is equally good as Uncle Charlie, who the family loves. There are scenes where he is warm and also chilling, and the nuances in the performance are very good.

The supporting cast is also very good. This is a great movie and one of Hitchcock's favorites. Highly recommended and well worth seeing.",1142294400,,1057,4.6063829787234045

But what she just thinks is a playful little thing is actually a very dark and criminal thing; Uncle Charlie's on the run from the law, and her knowledge of his actions can turn to disasterous effects... like him willing to kill even her to keep his secret safe.

DUH DUH DUH!

No, but seriously, it was a very good look into the whole ""tearing the veil off of Suburbia"", a la Blue Velvet (I know, it came later) and Hitchcock's own repeated motif of ""looking behind the curtain.""  Within an average, normal (and very stressed as such) household, complete and diabolical evil exists.

It's some good stuff.  I can never really fault Hitchcock his skill or his technique because he was great at it.  I just regret to say I get kind of tired of having him basically show variants of the same story over and over again.  But considering that this was, apparently, his favorite film of his, and being that it's a lot more personal and psychological than the common ""mistaken-identity-man-on-the-run"" with the ""blond-woman-exploring-her-place-in-society-and-coming-of-age"" that he tends to do much more often, it is quite definitely one of his better works.

310614,5,6301065573,"""Shadow of a Doubt"", directed by the masterful Alfred Hitchcock ranks extremely high among the vast array of his most well received films.  Featuring an excellent screenplay by Thornton Wilder, a well conceived musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin, some typically outstanding camera work and convincing acting performances the film has few rivals to its lofty stature in this genre.

An eerie Joseph Cotten, impressive in this signature role, playing debonair bachelor Charles Oakley is being pursued, presumably by the authorities.  To escape the heat he decides to visit his older sister and her family in the idyllic small California town of Santa Rosa and telegraphs them of his arrival.  This is just the tonic for his adroit and virginal niece and namesake Charlie played by Teresa Wright.  She'd been feeling morose and a visit from her beloved Uncle Charlie instantly elevated her spirits.

Uncle Charlie's arrival is a highly anticipated event. He comes bearing presents to the family but with a sketchy and sometimes volatile demeanor.  Wright is given an emerald ring which has an inscription in it with the letters T.S..  Tying this in with an article in the local papers, she suspects that Uncle Charlie might actually be the celebrated and notorious ""Merry Widow"" murderer.

The family is put under surveillance by a team of detectives including Macdonald Carey playing Det. Jack Graham, who are part of a nationwide manhunt.  Cotten's behavior keeps getting more and more suspicious and he finally reveals the truth to Wright that he is the strangler of three rich widows.  He makes her promise not to tell but she implores him to leave Santa Rosa.

After a series of accidents befall Wright, orchestrated by Cotten, she becomes determined to expose the cunning and dangerous Uncle Charlie to Carey who has become her love interest.

Hitchcock's climax is both gripping and unexpected and a perfect compliment to this somewhat under appreciated classic film.  Both Cotten and Wright are terrific in their respective roles.  A strong supporting cast led by Hume Cronyn playing omnipresent neighbor Herbie Hawkins and Henry Travers and Patrica Collinge playing Mr. and Mrs. Newton, Wright's parents add a nice touch.",1135036800,,2225,5.158774373259053

310616,5,6301065573,"It has been oft reported that Hitchcock considered SHADOW OF A DOUBT to be his favorite of his own films. While that may not,in fact, be true, he did say once that the film offered less to those who were disposed to attack plausibility in his films. At any rate, it is a film that is certainly worthy of more notice than it seems to get. With a superb screenplay by Thornton Wilder, winning performances by all involved, and direction from The Master himself, SHADOW OF A DOUBT is a first-rate suspense thriller.

Teresa Wright plays ""Young Charlie,"" a bored young woman of a quiet middle-class town. She was named after her favorite uncle. She dreams of excitement, and she longs for her worldly uncle and namesake to pay her a visit and brighten her world. When Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten) does show up for an extended stay, Young Charlie is instantly uplifted from her season of brooding; she feels a deep connection with her uncle. It is through this almost telepathic connection, however, that Young Charlie begins to put together clues that lead her to suspect her beloved uncle of being the heinous serial killer, dubbed the ""Merry Widow Murderer.""

From the opening sequence of the film, we know of course that he is, so the suspense in this film builds around Young Charlie--will she in fact convince herself of the guilt of the uncle she loves so much and might she even share his dark side? Eventually, she chooses to distance herself from her dangerous uncle and increasingly, her well-being is threatened once he knows for certain that she has correctly determined his true identity.

Both Cotten and Wright put in strong performances as the two Charlies, while the supporting players are solid in their roles. In particular, a very young-looking Hume Cronyn plays a nerdy murder-buff neighbor and offers some humor in this, his first movie role, and young actress Edna May Wonacott is brilliant and equally funny as the precocious Ann Newton, Young Charlie's little sister.

SHADOW OF A DOUBT is a perfectly-crafted little film and is one of Hitchcock's most enjoyable creations. The thrilling end sequence and its tight wrap-up are signature Hitchcock at his finest. Joseph Cotten is one of Hitchcock's strongest villains and, as a result, SHADOW OF A DOUBT is one of his strongest films.

310695,5,6301065573,"Shadow of A Doubt is one of the better Hitchcock movies I have enjoyed, mainly because it kept me very interested in the plot from start to finish...and what a finish.

Joseph Cotton and Teresa Wright were excellent stars, I wonder why Mr. Cotton was never nominated for an academy award, the more I see of him the better I enjoy his performances. This was his thirteenth movie and in my opinion he had more talent than Cary Grant or James Stewart, other stars frequently seen in Hitchcock thrillers.

The plot starts in a seedy ""flat"", quickly lets the viewer realize someone is tailing Cotton's character, Charlie (but who?), then finds ""Uncle Charlie"" in quiet, subdue Santa Rosa, California with a sister and her family.

Charlie has a somewhat sinister nature; he seems to enjoy embarrassing relatives publicly and has an ax to grind with the world. On the other hand, Good Ol' Charlie is suave, sometimes good-natured and alluring to single women because of his ability to charm. The viewer begins to wonder if Charlie is sinister or likes playing mind games.

Teresa White, also called Charlie, is the fond niece and originally was very impressed with Uncle Charlie, she wanted him to visit and now proves one should be careful what they wish for. As the plot moves forward the younger Charlie becomes conflicted between the good of her family, her Uncle Charlie, a Detective who wants information but becomes emotionally involved with the younger Charlie. She is not sure who or what to believe and her honest nature works to keep her somewhat conflicted in her desire for the truth.

Without providing too much information and giving away the storyline, this thriller uses conflict in emotions to subtly involve all the characters and the viewer in a seamless journey finally weaving it's way to a white-knuckle ending. Shadow of a doubt is like a book you can't put down, keeps your mind working and more than satisfies the Hitchcock thrill seeker.",1131235200,,1958,4.850299401197605
310696,5,6301065573,"More thsn once did Alfred Hitchcock say that his 1943 film ""Shadow Of A Doubt"" was his personal favorite out of all his films. And watching it, it's hard to argue. ""Shadow Of A Doubt"" defines Hitcock perfectly: drak, creepy, filled with black humor and more than twists and turns that a state intersection. It's not the masterpiece that ""Vertigo, ""North By Northwest"" and ""Psycho"" are, but ""Shadow Of A Doubt"" is in the upper echelon of Hitchcock movies.

The film's plot goes something like this. Uncle Charlie (Jospeh Cotton) is the notorious Merry Widow Murderer, elduing the law by travelling from Phildelphia to California. He visits the town of Santa Rosa to pay a visit to his family. They are thrilled to see him, especially his niece and namesake, ""Young Charlie"" (Teresa Wright). Once there, Charlie turns on the charm, never hinting once at his sadistic, homicidal alter ego. However, when cops begin to suspect charlie of being the MWM, so does his neice. What she uncovers is a deadly secret that could prove deadly for her. It leads up to a startling locomotive climac that is one of the best sequences in a Hitchcock movie.

""Shadow Of A Doubt"" is an excellent movie. As I said earlier, it is easy to see why this Hitchcock's favorite movie. It defines what he is all about. The acting is superb as well. Joseph Cotton is perfectly creepy and charming as the elusive Uncle Charlie, and Teresa Wright plays Young Charlie with a finesse missing from ost of today's young atresses.

This clever statement of Luigi Pirandello fits perfectly in this movie.

The mysterious but charming and refined Charlie Oakley arrives in Santa Rosa, accompanied by an ominous cloud of black smoke giving the impression that ""the devil was coming to town.""

But in despite of the fact he is a killer with a dark past and some murders of wealthy widows and eluding two investigators, his crazed eye fixed on a vision of the lost time tells his beloved niece these clue words. ""Everybody was sweet and pretty, the whole world-not like today.""

Like many of Hitchcock's films , this one focuses on the character of a psychopath. Guilt and redemption face one each other when he feels the lovable affect of his lovely niece; as you know the innocence can beat you stronger than the best of the punishments. He makes them know than the first thing he'll do is to open an account current with forty thousand $ which it sounds almost a slap in the dignity of this humble middle class family, moreover keep in mind we are in the middle of the WW2 and that penury accents still more the ethic abyss.

His niece works out for him as the other side of his troubled and evil human side and that must hurt. She tells him: We're sort of  like twins"";  and she tells her: ""The same blood runs in our veins.""  Right and wrong; Ying and Yang ; systole and diastole ; light and shadows.

But she gradually suspects and begins to doubt about his unmeasured goodness and spontaneous blitheness. She will convince by herself something is rotten and not precisely in Denmark.

Finally, the crude and ugly reality will give her the last and unforgettable proof about he wont' t build for her a stairway to heaven and she will understand the bitter Oscar Wilde `s statement : many times we tend to kill the beings whom love.""

The casual film fan will know him for titles like ""Psycho,"" ""The Birds,"" ""North By Northwest,"" and ""Vertigo,"" which actually were four of his last films.  His most prolific period was in the 1930s and 1940s, when he directed about half of his films.  ""Shadow Of a Doubt"" is not the most famous even of this period, but there is no better example of his work.  For those familiar with this film and interested in an excellent, detailed analysis of same, see [...]  (I am not connected with that site in any way.)

Hitchcock excelled at injecting menace into commonplace objects and settings, and his use of shadows, camera angles, and music was often inventive and later imitated.  It's a joy to the sophisticated viewer to see his work in ""Shadow Of a Doubt"" in this regard, but without a ripping good tale to tell it's just academics.  The screenplay here was provided mainly by celebrated playwright Thornton Wilder, and the central character of Young Charlie is played by Teresa Wright, an actress who is these days as sadly overlooked as this film itself.  She appears in almost every scene, so obviously Hitchcock trusted her talents immensely, and it paid off in a terrific performance that runs the gamut of emotions and situations.  Wright is the only actress or actor to have ever been Oscar nominated for each of her first three films, including Best Supporting winner for ""Mrs. Miniver.""

Joseph Cotten plays the bad guy, Uncle Charlie, and boy is he a bad guy.  If you've not seen this film, I hope you can ignore the details of the story and let the master of suspense slowly clue you in as the film rolls on.

310704,5,6301065573,"I first became acquainted with this movie through seeing it on Turner Classic Movies not to long ago. As I have come to find out, it is one of Alfred Hitchcock's favorites which he directed. It is verry easy to see why! This movie deals with the initial innocence and growing maturity of a young girl who comes to realize that her beloved uncle is not what he seems to be. The movie symbolically relates this girl's awakening while examining the deep psychological bond between herself and a charming yet repellent evil.

Charlott, (Chharlie,) played by the exceptional Teresa Wright, is a young teenager who is brooding over the fact that nothing of interest and sustenance occurs within the small town in which she lives. She decides to send a telegram to her dearly beloved Uncle Charlie, ( wonderfully portrayed by Joseph Cotten,) who, unknowingly to her, has already sent a telegram saying that he will come and visit her and her family. Charlie learns this, and the audience becomes aware of a deeply loving and almost telepathic bond between Charlotte and her uncle. After Uncle Charlie's arrival, Charlotte becomes aware of suspicious behaviors on her uncle's part, besides his inherent charm. The movie climactically builds as Charlie discovers her uncle's true nature as a coldblooded serial killer with a cynical view of the workings of the world, but who has a likable nature that can tempt others. Charlie must struggle with the dilemma of deciding what to do with these revelations as she wrestles with conflicting feelings of love and repulsion about her uncle. This movie explores with frank clarity the shattering of innocence through experience, and the realization that evil can exist within anyone whom we feel closest too.

""Shadow of a Doubt"" is filled with many unforgettable supporting characters who are represented as innocent and idyllic individuals in a small town. The use of gentle humor on the parts of these other characters makes the plot move along and also provides commic relief. The script for this movie, written by Thorton Wilder, provides a good balance of the lighthearted and sinister. I can hardly believe that Thorton Wilder, who wrote ""Our Town,"" could write something so vastly different, but his play shows the sinister side of life in a small community.

This movie is truly superb, and one which I thoroughly recommend to anyone who loves stories about childhood development through experience, and true psychological examinations of the human heart. Happy viewing!",1113264000,,2514,5.053012048192771
310755,5,6301065573,"With great sadness we find out today that Teresa Wright has died, in Connecticut, at the age of 86.  She wasn't necessarily a legend like some of her peers, but her acting embodied a warmth and a skill much like her somewhat later counterpart Patricia Neal, who oddly enough also (like Wright) made her name on the Broadway stage in Lillian Hellman parts.  When Teresa Wright first came to Hollywood, the studio system was alive and kicking and it gave her initially the best roles of her career.  She arrived in Hollywood with the rest of THE LITTLE FOXES company, and stayed around to make little pictures like PRIDE OF THE YANKEES and Mrs. MINIVER.

One of her husbands was Niven (""Duel in the Sun"") Busch, who wrote wonderful parts for you in PURSUED and TRACK OF THE CAT, two films which parlayed your ingenue perfection against Robert Mitchum's sexual bravado.  It is said that he wrote DUEL IN THE SUN for Teresa Wright to play, though I can't imagine her writhing across the desert with the elan of Jennifer Jones.  Another husband, Robert Anderson, made memorable use of her screen image in I NEVER SANG FOR MY FATHER.  For some reason she was a writer's actress, and many of Hollywood's top screenwriters vied for her services.  No one did better for Teresa Wright than Thornton Wilder, the Pulitzer Prize winning playwright who wrote SHADOW OF A DOUBT with the teen specialist Sally Benson.  Wilder's memorable portrait of a small town, filled with ordinary people, that becomes the churning pool of a serial killer, was instantly acclaimed upon its release in 1943, and in the years since has come to be seen as one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest and most revealing pictures.  And Teresa Wright gleams at the center of the whirlpool as ""Charlie,"" on the surface an innocent enough teenager in a small Northern California town, but with secret depths that link her filmically to ""Uncle Charlie,"" the part Joseph Cotten played so beautifully.  It's not only that their names are the same, but they seem like two halves of the same person; and the audience senses this without being hit over the head with it due to careful writing and brilliant staging by Hitchcock.  In its own way SHADOW OF A DOUBT is as disturbing and transgressive as any of the contemporary film noir pictures, and will haunt you forever once you see it.

Goodbye, Teresa Wright, your powers of shadow and light will live forever.  You are an actress for the ages.",1110326400,,2444,4.72
310756,5,6301065573,"Shadow of a Doubt was Alfred Hitchcock's favorite among all his films. It's easy to see why. Shadow of a Doubt shows how we can have monsters living among us -- monsters who may be the people we love and care for the most. The great Joseph Cotten -- one of the most underrated actors of all time -- plays Uncle Charlie with great, seething menace and yet shows such charm and likability on the surface that we can see why his family loves him. It was rare to see such a portrait of such unrepentant evil on film during that time. But in ""Shadow,"" Hitchcock unhesitatingly shows that even in the most genial, friendly atmosphere, pure evil can survive and even flourish. Cotten's Uncle Charlie is a serial killer, but is able to win the entire town of Santa Rosa over with his charm and shows just how frighteningly easy it is for the devil to live among us. The story resonates even more now since the world has been exposed to people like Ed Gein, Charles Whitman, John Wayne Gacy, David Berkowitz and Jeffrey Dahmer -- people whose seeming normality masked unimaginable evil. It's a Hitchcock masterpiece that only gets better and more timley with age.",1097712000,,1154,4.552884615384615

Considering this film was always hailed as being Hitchcock's favorite, I'm really surprised that Universal didn't roll out the red carpet when it came to the disc's bonus features.
I completely expected to see the same TLC that made the 'Rear Window', 'Vertigo', and 'Psycho' DVDs such an education to watch.  Instead Universal didn't even seem to think 'Shadow of a Doubt' warranted a simple wide-screen format.
I loved the film and will always think of it as one of my favorites among Hitch's works.  I can't help but to be disappointed that it seemed to fall to the way-side when it came to the attention I felt it should have commanded in its reproduction and formatting though.",1088726400,,794,4.781021897810219
310758,5,6301065573,"Having just watched Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (1943) last night for the first time, I was surprised at how good it was, and why I've never seen it before.  I mean, I am a fan of Hitchcock, and I've seen many of his movies, but to have heard so little of this particular film seems puzzling to me, as it's an excellent film, and worthy of a lot more recognition than it seems to have gotten.  Either that or I just need to get out of my cookie jar more often...
Anyway, the film, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and written by Thornton Wilder, stars a wonderful cast including Teresa Wright, who appeared with Gary Cooper the previous year in The Pride of the Yankees (1942), Joseph Cotten (Citizen Kane, The Third Man), and Henry Travers (High Sierra, Mrs. Miniver, It's a Wonderful Life).  Also making an appearance is Hume Cronyn making his film debut in a supporting role as a mousy neighbor.
The story involves a family in a small California town, and the impending arrival of a relative, Charlie (Cotten), from back east.  Most anticipatory is younger Charlie (Wright), named after her uncle, as she feels a deep, almost telepathic connection to this man she hasn't seen in quite awhile.  Now, before Charlie's departure for California, we get a general sense of unease, as it seems Charlie is involved in something of a sinister nature.  Upon arriving in California, the visit seems to be going well, as the family welcomes him with open arms, but soon we learn that trouble has followed Charlie in the form of two rather shady individuals who present themselves with a certain amount of deception, which is elaborated on later.  The older Charlie's behavior begins to change subtly, perceptible only to the younger Charlie and us, the audience.  As various bits of information are disseminated, the younger Charlie's begins to realize that her uncle may harbor a terrible secret that could tear apart the very fabric of her family.  As her uncle's slick veneer is slowly peeled away, she eventually learns the truth, with the older Charlie realizing that the relative safety he sought in coming to stay with his sister and her family is in jeopardy.  What lengths will he go to to protect himself from his past?
The film starts out very slowly, but it's obviously deliberate, as the sense of dread within the viewer is cultivated in meticulous fashion.  This seems a common tactic with Hitchcock, but I did get the feeling it was more drawn out here than in most of his other films.  The pacing felt very similar to Rebecca, another Hitchcock film, which was released in 1940, but while that film had a much more grandiose feel to it, this film keeps things fairly simple, which really works well.  There is a good amount of leaving the viewer in the dark within the first hour or so of the film, but when the secrets of the character is revealed, the plot points prior to this fall into place nicely, making sense of these once less meaningful elements.  Teresa Wright's character is wonderful as the perceptive and intelligent niece forced to make a very difficult decision between her family and her uncle, trying to deal with the consequences of whatever path she chooses.  Cotten is the real standout performance in the film, presenting a very likeable character, with a highly polished exterior, but an exterior you learn is barely hiding a very ugly and, ultimately, dangerous core.  He figuratively becomes the fox in the hen house, as his sinister nature encroaches upon this quiet, unassuming community.  As I said before, the pacing is pretty slow, picking up moderately within the last 30 minutes (it has a running time of 108 minutes) to a very suitable and satisfying ending, one that provides a nice jolt during an already tense scene.
The print provided by Universal for this release looks very good, despite a few hardly noticeable signs of age and wear.  Special features include a featurette on the making of the film, detailing why Hitchcock considered this to be one of his favorite movies he made, production notes, drawings and photographs, recommendations (to other Hitchcock films), and a theatrical trailer for the film.  All in all, and excellent, if underrated, Hitchcock classic.

310759,5,6301065573,"No question about it: this one of Hitchcock's best, and it ought to be a lot better known.
  There's some truth in the contention that much of Hitchcock's work is based on flimsy plotting, gimmickry, and attractive stick figures racing from one scene to the next just a step ahead of sense or logic. This is easily seen even in much-admired films like ""North by Northwest"".

  But ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (along with ""Vertigo"" and the first half of ""Psycho"") gives the lie to the claim that this was all there was to Hitchcock. This is a film in which every turn of the narrative is governed by the development of character, as a girl matures from giddy teenager to strong (and even deadly) young woman while grappling with the knowledge that her beloved uncle is a serial killer.
  The acting is uniformly outstanding. Cotten is in full lounge-lizard mode here--nobody ever enunciated a perfectly-balanced sentence with more venom. Hume Cronyn plays a neighborhood geek almost--but not quite--to the point of parody. But it's Teresa Wright who takes the prize here. Wright was a pleasant but unremarkable presence in a number of films, but in ""Doubt"" she really shows what she was capable of. Consider the expression on her face as she descends the stairs in the climactic scene, and how easy it would have been to overplay it.
  Perhaps it was the influence of Wilder (though his biographers state that he actually didn't really do much work on the picture), but ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is one film in which the master outdid himself, stepping beyond the limits of entertainment into something approaching art.",1085097600,,1604,4.803636363636364
310760,5,6301065573,"Consider two classic Hitchcock motif's - the staircase at night (cf Suspicion, Notorious) and the brattish little girl.  In SHADOW OF A DOUBT there is one five second scene of the former in which Charlie (played by Ms Teresa Wright) niece to a serial killer, her Uncle Charlie,  ascends the staircase at night in the dark with a jug of water and glasses for that Uncle, played by Mr Joseph Cotton.  The bannister bars and the shadows of the staircase fill the scene as she, dressed in a white dress that was a gift from that Uncle, a dress moreover that fits snugly over her hips and thighs and is momentarily transparent as she reaches the top of the stairs, moves towards his door.  It is a moment of erotic tension and dread.  Dramatic irony, filmic composition, film movement, lighting, design, sound all at their most masterful.
In the latter case - the ""stock"" brattish little girl - we have Ann, Charlie'
s sister and niece to the killer (cf Strangers on a Train) played marvellously throughout by Edna May Wonacott.  Ann wears glasses, (naturally) reads incessantly, has a sharp eye, biting tongue and is nosey little busy body - a miniature intellectual with an IQ of 150 and rising.  When asked by her Uncle Charlie at the close of a meal whether she would like to read the newspaper funnies she responds ""  I'm too old for the funnies.  I read two books a week.  I took a sacred oath I would.  Besides, in this family no one in the family is allowed to read at the table.  It isn't polite.""  No patronizing me!!  But it is Ann, the intellectual child whose INTUITION tells her, this Uncle is NOT GOOD.
There are many delights in this film shot in stunning and gloriously defined BLACK AND WHITE. A major one is the LOCATION shooting in Santa Rosa.  The scene of the arrival of the train in town is stunning. Another one is the dialogue - Uncle Charlie declaiming at dinner his freelings towards widows as ""faded, fat, greedy, wheezy animals"" is electrifying.  Less ""theatrical"" than most of his films, quieter perhaps, more subtle but no less powerful.  The extras include a lengthy interview with Ms Wright.",1076112000,,2119,4.593085106382978
310761,5,6301065573,"Hitchcock loved to subvert what others took for granted. Set in the Northern California town of Santa Rosa, Shadow of a Doubt is most subversive about the very normal, tranquil qualities of small town life. Like all of Hitchcock's most convincing and powerful thrillers, the mystery is revealed right away. Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton)is on the run from the police. He's endearing, charming and a serial killer nicknamed The Merry Widow Murderer. With the police hot on his trail he turns to the only place he can--home.
Uncle Charlie visits with his sister and her family in a sleepy small town. Uncle Charlie gets the chance to visit with his namesake and favorite niece nicknamed Young Charlie (Teresa Wright). They have a grand old name visiting until the past comes haunting. Young Charlie begins to suspect that Uncle Charlie is the Merry Window Murderer. What's worse, he realizes that she knows. Suddenly, he must find a way to murder his favorite niece and escape without suspicion.
Shadow is one of Hitchcock's earliest films where his favorite themes finally come together in a great collabortive effort with Thornton Wilder (Our Town). Wilder's early drafts (Hitchcock's wife and frequent collaborator Alma Reville did extensive rewrites along with Sally Benson and, of course, Hitchcock himself, as always, uncredited). Like many of the releases from Universal in the Alfred Hitchcock Collection, Shadow comes back with some interesting extras.
The documentary  which includes interviews with Teresa Wright, Hume Cronyn, Robert Boyle, Pat Hitchcock O'Connell and director Peter Bogdanovich, isn't the usual slapdash affair. There's some interesting insights and observations about the film (if you'd like real insight into the film, I'd suggest the recent Hitchcock biography).
Joseph Cotton, Teresa Wright and the rest of this stunning cast capture the atmosphere (or least Hollywood's version of it with a bit more realism courtesy of Wilder and Hitchcock)of life in a small town during the 40's. It's one of Hitchcock's early American masterpieces (along with the wonderful Notorious).
The transfer looks pretty good overall. There are some minor issues with edge enhancement but the overall look of the film is very clean considering the age of the negative. It's a pity that so many Hitchcock films are spread over so many studios. Shadow would work well in a boxed set with Strangers on a Train and even Rear Window.",1073865600,,2436,5.214285714285714

310763,5,6301065573,"This is more than just a nailbitingly effective exercise in suspense, but is, more fundamentally, a supremely compelling parable about the insidious forms that evil can take, the inevitable loss of innocence that must occur when this evil is recognized, and the courage and integrity it takes to combat such evil. Moreover, Hitchcock displays an intuitive and sophisticated psychological perception about the mentality of the psychopath-sociopath, for what he suggests in this film is that Uncle Charley's murderous behavior is not the product of conscious, considered moral choice, but rather of a sickness of the soul that results in a basic alienation from the warp and woof of the social fabric. This perception is brilliantly conveyed by Joseph Cotten as Uncle Charley, in addition to his clever and effective manipulation of his suave persona to render his characterization all the more diabolical.
One of the great films of all time, and arguably, Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece.",1059091200,,988,5.380645161290323
310833,5,6301065573,"This is simply fabulous; a completely unique story, set in a quiet, gentle small town, innocent in all its doings, until Uncle Charlie comes to call. Really the finest of Joseph Cotten's performances, this role is perfect, and he is truly frightening in his contrast of personalities, one for his sister and family, the surface one, and his hidden personality, that of the malevolent murderer. He despises rich women, particularly rich widows, and goes after them with a vengenace. Attractive and charismatic, he has no problem attracting them, to their eventual doom. He makes a slip and gives Charlie, his niece, a ring he stole from one of his victims, with the initials engraved on the inside of the band, and Charlie, her admiration and love for her uncle rapidly dwindling, does some late night research at the local library and discovers the identity of the intials on her ring. Theresa Wright is brilliant and believable, as are her entire family, her mother, whom I greatly admire, and father, perfect in his small town role, and her little brother and sister, the bookworm sister my favorite of all. Hume Cronyn, a friend and neighbor of the father's, engages in an ongoing game of how to create the perfect murder...always arriving during dinnertime and when asked how his mother is (he lives with her) he says ""Middling, just middling."" As the movie progresses and Charlie becomes more and more convinced that her uncle is the serial killer being sought by the two detectives who followed him to Santa Rosa, the tension increases and Charlie's life is threatened as well. My favorite scene is at the dinner table when Uncle Charlie tips his mitt a bit by expounding on rich widows: ""Fat, greedy women, eating the money, drinking the money, proud of their jewelry but nothing else...and what do we do with animals when they grow too old and too fat?""
And the scene in the bar, foreign land for Charlie, and a great scene, with Joseph Cotten twisting a napkin in his hands, and Charlie watching him do it, and thinking about all the women done away with by these same hands...there is a bit part of a barmaid, a school acquaintance of Charlie's with a jaded, resigned air of her lot in life as that of a waitress with no hope for the future. Uncle Charlie tells his niece that she knows nothing of him or life in general, and she ""lives her perfect, ordinary life in her ordinary little town, dreaming stupid, silly dreams...and ""I brought you nightmares..."" Indeed.
Hitchcock filmed this in the town of Santa Rosa, in a real house, and the attention to the small town aura is evident throughout; also the decade of the 1940s, lends an air of real innocence, a world complacent and happy and unaware of the Uncle Charlies of the outside world. Well worth adding to your Hitchcock collection...a true classic of the Master Director's skills.",1046131200,,2850,4.759595959595959
310834,5,6301065573,"Santa Rosa is a typical American town and the Newtons are a typical 1940s American family.  The father loves plotting elaborate imaginary murders with the quirky next door neighbor.  The mother is a housewife obsessed with egg whites and slipcovers.  The children are off-beat cherubs.  At the beginning of the film, the oldest, a young woman named Charlie played by Theresa Wright, looks forward to a visit from her favorite relative, her mother's brother - Uncle Charlie.

When he arrives, the happy reunion chills when Charlie suspects that her Uncle Charlie might be a serial killer known as ""The Merry Widow Strangler"".  Uncle Charlie is all the more menacing given his physical beauty and his trusted position in the family.  We prefer our monsters to be ugly, recognizable and locked outside our homes.
As Charlie becomes more convinced of his guilt, her uncle plays on her love of her mother and fear of scandal to convince her to keep his secret.  The audience realizes that Uncle Charlie must kill his niece long before she does.  Hitchcock's picture of goofy familial normalcy and the audience's growing awareness of danger from within builds the tension to the very last scene.
This movie is one of Hitchcock's best psychological dramas.  The story is tight and fast paced.  The black and white cinematography enhances both the sense of post World War II ordinariness with bright, sunny scenes of family life and suspense heightened with bright lights and dark shadows.  Point of view is crucial to the telling of this piece.  For example, Hitchcock allows us inside Charlie's head the moment she realizes the truth.  The camera pulls back and up abruptly like a swift intake of breath.  The casting is superb with Theresa Wright, Joseph Cotton and Hume Cronyn.",1040601600,,1773,4.96271186440678

310836,5,6301065573,"In Francois Truffaut's book length interview with Hitchcock, Hitch said that while 1943's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" probably wasn't his best picture, it was his favorite because a thousand little things came together to make it near-effortless and near-perfect.
As an example, he refers to one of the first scenes shot: the scene where Uncle Charley's train arrives.  On a bright clear day, the camera gets set up for a simple shot of a steam train pulling into the station.  As soon as the train arrives, though, a gust of wind comes up from behind the train.  All the black smoke that was seeming to float into the sky sweeps down and envelops the platform: Uncle Charley is here!
What else adds up to a great picture?  A screenplay written by one of America's greatest playwrights, Thornton Wilder (""Our Town""), a wonderful cast (Theresa Wright, Joseph Cotten, Henry Travers--Clarence from ""It's a Wonderful Life"", Hume Cronyn are all fantastic) a tight plot, and a good score.
Others have touched on the plot and the theme of innocence lost.  All I can add is that this film really stands up and that I enjoy it every time I watch it.
Considering the movie is almost 60 years old, the DVD transfer is great and from a good print.  The extras are neat.

310837,5,6301065573,"1943's SHADOW OF A DOUBT is an allegorical study of Americana seen through the naivete of a typical family in a quiet and slumberous community. When evil comes to town in the embodiment of the beloved Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) it is the perceptive niece Young Charlie (Teresa Wright) that slowly uncovers his true identity as the Merry Widow murderer. Henry Travers and Hume Cronyn spend their evenings concocting ways to commit the perfect murder unknowingly under the watchful eyes of the genuine article. Evil takes many shapes and hides behind many facades in broad daylight. Would the wholesome average American community recognize such evil and be willing to deal with it? These are questions that the transplanted Hitchcock would ask about his new home. Another transplant, Dimitri Tiomkin, composed a brilliant score utilizing American idioms laced with the darkness of the tainted soul. This remains one of Hitchcock's best films since it works, as a thriller yet remains a true reflection of a good-natured but generally complacent lifestyle. What is interesting is that Hitchcock shows his usual disdain for police by having the niece foil the Merry Widow murderer and not agent Jack Graham (Macdonald Carey). The vigilant individual is still the screen's most valuable asset.",1026864000,,1291,5.241545893719807
310838,4,6301065573,"Hitchcock's films often feature good people who somehow get themselves involved in something not quite kosher which escalates to something they feel they can't report to the police, or else it will be bad for them. ""Strangers on a Train"" is like that; so is ""Rear Window"". Here in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", the same plot device rears its head again, but with a difference. Usually the ""bad thing"" is rooted in some kind of external event, but in this movie, the young niece uncovers a monstrous secret about her favorite uncle, who is visiting in the family home.
This is about the only movie in which I like Teresa Wright (Young Charlie), whom I usually find grating. But here, she does a creditable job as an ordinary girl who must grow up awful quick if she is to defend herself against this wolf in sheep's clothing, Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten). I'm amazed by how convincing Joseph Cotten is as Uncle Charlie, the shady murderer whom these naive people take to be a sophisticate. Hard to believe that he didn't go on to make a career of creeps in the movies, but he went right back to his ""good guy"" roles. For instance, he was capable of a lot more than the artist in the later ""Portrait of Jennie"", a good movie to be sure, but not a challenging role by any means.  The actress playing the mother is very good; I've known many women as ""on the edge"" emotionally as she is, with an almost morbid sentimentality. The only oddity in the whole cast is MacDonald Carey as the detective-love interest. Mother calls him a nice young man, but he didn't strike me as all that young, and golly, he certainly is no dream boat. Is he supposed to be the ""everyman"" that most women will wind up marrying, a safe choice after the thrill of knowing an ""Uncle Charlie"" wears off?

And that brings me to my next observation, that there is something unsavory about the relationship between Uncle Charlie and Young Charlie. Even before Young Charlie finds out his secret, Uncle Charlie seems inordinately interested in the young girl. In today's climate, it doesn't take much imagination to wonder whether there's an incest subtext going on here. First the girl is very fond of her uncle, then can't bear his touching her, while he enjoins her to keep their secret because it would kill her mother to learn the truth. Also, the age difference between Wright and Cotten is not all that much, Hollywood-wise. It is highly conceivable they could've played love interests in a different movie, as she is also about the same amount of years younger than Gary Cooper in ""Pride of the Yankees"".
So, ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is a somewhat disturbing movie because of its focus in the home and among the family. It is nonetheless very well executed. My only complaint is that it is a little too long; hence the 4 stars rather than 5.",1024617600,,2802,4.557539682539683
310839,5,6301065573,"The middle-class Newtons of Santa Rosa, California in Hitchcock's film might seem to be very much akin to the idealized smalltown families in M-G-M films during the Thirties and Forties, if not for the fact that they each seem to have initially retreated into their own fantasy, worlds and seem so out of touch with one another. The father lives to discuss the crime magazines he collects with his next-door neighbor. Anne, the fearfully precocious eight year-old daughter, is trying to read all the novels in the town library. Emma, the sentimental mother, often drops into reveries of her idealized childhood with her adored baby brother Charlie. Charlie's namesake niece (Teresa Wright) is convinced her family needs to be shaken out of their doldrums, and is grateful when her beloved uncle (Joseph Cotton) surprises the family with a welcome surprise visit. But Uncle Charlie is not quite what he seems: the police want to question him about a matter back East, and then there are the expensive gifts he showers his relatives with which don't seem to belong to him...
Hitchock once called this variant of the wolf-among-the-lambs parable his best American film; though he later recanted, it's hard not to think his original assessment was right. Although this film has all the cleverness and adroitness we associate with his other great films (in his repeated use of twinning motifs, and in such virtuoso sequences as young Charlie's rush to the library to discover the truth about her uncle--and the famous crane shot when she finds it), it's rare in that it has a truly superb script (credited to Thornton Wilder) that allows Hitchock's excellent cast to play real and multilayered human beings. Although there are many memorable performances in Hitchcock films, he never had another film in which every single member of the cast seems to be living up to his or her highest potential: even the two local Santa Rosa children he cast as the two youngest Newtons, Edna May Wonacott (as the surprisingly complex Anne) and Charles Bates (as little Roger), linger long in the memory. Cotton has the performance of his career as the evil and manipulative Uncle Charlie: he's so effective that initially Teresa Wright, as the younger Charlie (the only one of the Newtons to fully understand the truth about Cotton), seems greatly outmatched. But as the film continues Wright brings such steely determination to her role that you understand how this sweet young woman can successfully be an obstacle to Uncle Charlie's schemes. She's impossible to forget (especially in the way she walks down the street--shoulders hunched, hands clenched--when she runs away from the dinner table).
The film's standout performance, however, is the stage actress Patricia Collinge in the great linchpin role of the mother. Collinge's Emma Newton initially seems a fluttering, silly, ordinary woman, but Collinge invests the role with so much depth of feeling that when Uncle Charlie cruelly warns young Charlie what the revelation of his identity will do to his sister, you know why the niece will not dare break her mother's heart (even at the risk of her own life). Collinge's Emma is what the film's deep and abiding humanism (so rare for a Hitchcock film!) is staked upon--she represents both what Uncle Charlie wants to destroy and what young Charlie is so desperate to save. And when Collinge makes her great, sad ""forgetting you're you"" speech near the film's end--where, for in the only time in her life, this sweet, self-martyring woman gives voice to what she may have given up to raise her family--, you fully understand why the stakes are so high. It's a classic performance--perhaps the single finest and richest in Hitchcock's entire corpus.",1018656000,,3736,5.02741935483871

Here we see the early workings of ideas and themes Hitchcock expressed better in his later work. ""Shadow of a Doubt"" explores the merging of good and evil to the point where it is hard to tell which is which. Like the criminals in modern times, they seduce their victims with charm and lead them to believe that they are a perfectly good human bening but behind their mask lies their true evil nature. ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is about an uncle who comes to visit his family in the town of Santa Rosa(Filmed in my hometown!) He seems to be a very good man but Hitchcock slowly gives us hints that he is in some kind of trouble or has done something he doesn't want his family to find out. Both of the main characters are named Charlie, Uncle Charlie who repersents evil and his niece, who repersents good. ""Shadow of a Doubt"" shows this struggle and how the line between both is very slim. One of Hitchcock's best and a personal favorite of his.",1016150400,,1056,4.338383838383838

310946,5,6301065573,"Alfred Hitchcock was at the top of his game with ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" one of his all-time personal favorites.  Joseph Cotten, generally accustomed to playing suave, likeable figures portrays a sociopath who hates society, and has no compunctions about killing.  His targets for death are rich widows.  He rationalizes that there is nothing wrong about killing them since they are spending money left to them by their deceased husbands that they do not deserve.  The world is a sick, warped place to Cotten, and he sees nothing wrong in grabbing every advantage he can with no remorse.
As is often the case with sociopaths such as Cotten, they can also be thoroughly charming.  How else do they trap their victims?  We see Cotten weave his spell over one widow, whose life was probably only ultimately spared by the end of Cotten's activities.
Initially Cotten's niece, like him, also called Charlie, and played by Teresa Wright in one of her most enduring roles, sees only the charming, debonair, joyously witty side of the man she calls her ""favorite uncle.""  When he comes west to stay for awhile with his sister and family, however, Wright little by little begins piecing together the real Uncle Charlie.  He lets down his guard and tells him his warped view of human existence, which he considers hopelessly depraved.
Uncle Charlie is suspected of being the ""Merry Widow Killer"" of wealthy widows and the manhunt results in FBI agent McDonald Carey being assigned to investigate Cotten.  He is quickly taken by the charms of Ms. Wright.  At first when he seeks her cooperation in learning more about her uncle, she becomes incensed, but as she learns more about him, her opposition ends and she helps Carey in his pursuit.
The film ends with a brilliantly filmed train sequence which, from the standpoint of stark visual imagery, is reminiscent of the closing sequence with the merry-go-round in ""Strangers on a Train.""  Wright finds herself confronted by a desperate Cotten, who realizes that she is the one person he must silence if he is to continue his existence of preying upon vulnerable widows and ultimately killing them.",1011398400,,2133,4.913649025069638
310947,3,6301065573,"I find it hard to believe that Shadow of a Doubt is even considered as Alfred Hitchcock's best film.  Although he was a brilliant director, the suspense of this film is minimal while the plot can leave you uninterested.  Joseph Cotton plays the beloved ""Uncle Charlie"", who pays a visit to his older sister and her family.  Meanwhile his adoring niece is tipped off by a detective that her uncle is a serial killer.  Some undeveloped references to telepathy and an unintended, yet apparent sexual chemistry between Uncle and Niece just added to the things I did not like about this film.  Shadow of a Doubt may be a masterpiece to film majors, but for an average moviegoer like myself, this film is no greater than any other - and definitely nothing special.",1006905600,,758,4.669172932330827
310948,5,6301065573,"Many people are surprised that this little gem is actually regarded by many critics as Alfred Hitchcock's best American film!  In the sleepy setting of 1943 Santa Rosa, California, Charley Oakley pays a visit to his sister Emmy and her family.  While in Santa Rosa, Charley at first seems to be a personable and successful individual, but he seems unreasonably upset when he thinks people are trying to find out about him...........The film portrays throughout the theme of affinity between Uncle Charley and his namesake neice played by Teresa Wright. Great is the scene where the neice races to the public library in order to find a missing clue in the newspaper.  Joseph Cotton and Teresa Wright contribute excellent performances which give vitality to the conception of their like yet opposite personalities. Emmy is excellently portrayed by the wonderful Irish stage actress Patricia Collinge ( you just know it would kill her soul if she knew the truth about her little brother! ) Macdonald Carey was never much of an actor, but here he seems real and genuine as the  man who looking for Oakley while falling in love with his neice in the process.  A local girl was chosen by Hitch to play the younger sister and if she was told to be irritating, boy, did she succeed!  Cotton is able to convey the surface charm which almost cover the menace within, and  Wright convincingly shows us a naive young woman who finds herself in a situation she could not imagine - much less suspect.  SHADOW OF A DOUBT is vintage Hitchcock from the overall conception to the smallest detail, the imprint of this master filmmaker is evident.",997315200,,1627,4.806451612903226
310949,3,6301065573,"Wilder was one of the scriptwriters for this, and I can't help but think he was the man responsible for Uncle Charlie's excellent barroom rant against the pestilence of life and the world.  But this isn't Our Town: Teresa Wright as a strangely self-absorbed daughter of a curious Santa Rosa family came off as strained and bizarre, nearly as bizarre as her uncle.  Maybe I'm cursed by modern sensibilities, but I couldn't help catching a sexual overtone to her fascination with her uncle, a fascination only compensated by the detective's--the very man hunting her uncle--seduction of her.  Joseph Cotten made a lukewarm villain; I love his voice, but he needs the kind of role The Third Man gave him.  All in all, a well-written melodrama, but not much to signify Hitchcock's immense talent.",985910400,,792,4.932330827067669
310950,5,6301065573,"Somewhat reminiscent of Orson Welles' The Stranger (1946), Shadow of a Doubt is a superior film about evil in the most unexpected places and the bottomless human capacity for denial.  This seems somehow fitting since Welles directed Joseph Cotten to such acclaim in The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), also a box office disappointment, and both give such excellent performances in Carole Reed's masterful The Third Man (1949).
In Shadow of a Doubt, Cotten plays Charlie Oakley, a widow murderer hiding from the authorities in his sister's pleasant suburban home. (In The Stranger, Welles plays a Nazi hiding from the authorities in another pleasant American suburb.)  Just about everyone--but especially Charlie's adoring namesake niece Charlie (Teresa Wright)--is seduced by his charm and good looks and thinks he's an upstanding citizen.
But looks can be deceiving.  The dinner table speech Cotten gives towards the end of the film is the essence of pure evil.  It rivals the speech Welles gives to Cotten on the merry-go-round in The Third Man (and James Mason's ""God was wrong"" speech in Larger Than Life) as one of the most chilling in cinematic history.  It's more subtle, but just as insidious.  And you'll never hear ""The Merry Widow Waltz"" the same way again!
The script was co-written by Aldred Hitchcock and Thornton Wilder (Our Town, The Skin of Our Teeth).  Although it's long been long assumed that Shadow of a Doubt was Hitchcock's personal favorite, this is not correct.  He disputes the claim in Francois Truffaut's ""Hitchcock"" (the definitive text for Hitchcock enthusiasts).  He does say, however, that the impression may be ""due to my very pleasant memories of working on it with Thornton Wilder...it was so gratifying for me to find out that one of America's most eminent playwrights was willing to work with me, and indeed, that he took the whole thing quite seriously.""
Hume Cronyn and Henry Travers (Clarence in It's a Wonderful Life) provide excellent support.  Cronyn would appear in Hitchcock's next film, Lifeboat, also released in 1943.  Shadow of a Doubt was a stellar effort from all involved.  If it failed to find its audience the first time around, time has elevated the film--much like Welles' Touch of Evil (1958)--to the deserved status of classic.",981849600,,2283,5.10752688172043
310951,5,6301065573,"This classis, somewhat obscure Hitchcock film proves once again what a  masterful storyteller he was.  Teresa Wright is her usual endearing,  charming, adorable self who begin to suspect her beloved ""Uncle  Charly"" may be a ruthless serial killer.  One may start out watching  thinking this movie is ""corny"" but as the story unfolds, you are  pulled into the magistery of what great film making is, or should be, all  about.  As an antique lover, I found that the the sets and  Joseph Cotton's wardrobe are truly magnificant.  The acting, especially  Hume Cronyn in his film debut, is second to none.  Joseph Cotton alternates  between charming and sininster in one of the greatest performances on  film.  Clarence the angel, from ""It's A Wonderful Life"" plays the  dad and everyone else is cast with absolute perfection.  Do yourself a  favor and rent this film, sans commercial interuption, and prepare to watch  one of the classic films from the 1940's.  I love this movie!!!!",969235200,,979,4.956521739130435
310952,5,6301065573,"Will not leave a shadow of a doubt in your mind that it is one of  Hitchcock's greatest, though it may not readily come to mind when his  classic are discussed. This gem is both a knowing commentary on post-World  War America, an innocent time slowly coming to terms with the evil in its  midst, and a chilling (though probably unwitting) foreshadowing of things  to come. The wholesome family life of the Newtons in one of the last sleepy  towns in California, the final American frontier, hums along while Uncle  Charlie's insidiousness slowly takes root, aided by the initial adoration  of Charlie, his niece and psychic twin. The two eventually play out the  enduring, mortal struggle between good and evil, but the ending is neither  as clean and tidy as we'd like it to be in life nor as it was beginning to  be in movies.",969235200,,828,4.602739726027397
310953,5,6301065573,"The presence of evil where you least suspect it was Alfred Hitchcock's  greatest theme. Shadow of a Doubt gave him the opportunity of his career:  to join with Thornton Wilder, author of Our Town and the great celebrant of  the poetry in everyday life, to create a story about the horror in everyday  life. Joseph Cotten plays Uncle Charlie--an elegant, genial, seemingly  upstanding citizen, adored by his family in sleepy Santa Rosa, Calif.--who  is actually a deranged serial killer. Teresa Wright is his niece and  namesake, who slowly awakens to the truth about her uncle and finds herself  in peril. The film is impeccably paced and the dialogue brilliant, but much  of the impact of the film must be credited to Cotten, who had a natural  ability to play sinister roles and never again had such a great opportunity  to do so. His great speech to his niece gives us goosebumps just to think  about: ""Do you know that the world is a foul sty? And if you ripped  the facades off houses, you'd find swine?"" (Considering that this film  was made in the middle of World War II, that line must have had  sledgehammer impact on the film's first audiences.) Teresa Wright and all  the other performers are excellent, but special mention must be made of  Patricia Collinge, who as the mother of the family plays a character as  close to the pure spirit of love as has ever been portrayed on the screen.  She is deeply moving, all the more so because of her contrast to Uncle  Charlie, the baby brother she adores. This film is simultaneously poignant  and spine-tingling; it was Hitchcock's favorite among his films, and--tied  with Vertigo--his greatest.",968630400,,1652,4.763250883392226
310954,5,6301065573,"This is one my favorite films of all time, as well as Alfred Hitchcock's personal favorite of all his films. The story is compelling and suspenseful and the acting is among the best you'll see in American cinema. When Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) visits his sister's family in Santa Rosa, California, from the east (Philadelphia), a series of events that may identify him as ""The Merry Widow Murderer,"" crushes young Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright), his niece, who idolizes him. Wright's journey from a young, innocent girl into a woman who struggles to do the right thing, while protecting her family, is a wonderful study in character development. Wright's performance ranks among the best in American film.  It's her genuine goodness and believability that helps make this film so successful. Cotton manages to be absolutely chilling and charming at the same time. It's hard to believe that his performance was overlooked at Oscar time in 1943. Hitchcock couldn't have assembled a better cast of supporting players: Hume Cronyn (his film debut), MacDonald Carey, Henry Travers (made immortal as Clarence the angel in It's a Wonderful Life), Patricia Collinge, and Wallace Ford. The character roles are wonderfully drawn, each actor giving memorable performances. Collinge is particularly effective as Wright's mother and Cotton's older sister. The camera work, always excellent in Hitchcock films, is exemplary here, from the opening sequences, that sets the scene without any dialogue, to the wonderful climax aboard a train. Thornton Wilder (the author of Our Town) and Sally Benson (Meet Me in St. Louis) cowrote the screenplay, peppering it with small town touches, and contrasting it against the evil of Uncle Charlie. And take note of all the doubling and twos. Young Charlie, Old Charlie, Till Two Tavern, where the waitress has been working there for two weeks, two train sequences, two important dinners at the Newton home, two celebratory toast, and on and on. This film gets better with each viewing. If you get the opportunity to see it on the big screen, by all means do so. I did at a recent Hitchcock film festival in Philly and it was like seeing it for the first time.  The DVD extras are great.  The documentary on the making of the film is very interesting, with probably, one of the last interviews about the film that Teresa Wright gave before her death.  The commentary along with the film is also interesting to film buffs and Hitchcock fans.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-of-a-Doubt/dp/B000055Y14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow of a Doubt</a>",966211200,,2618,5.301204819277109
311010,5,6301065573,"As an avid Hitchcock fan since my first viewing of ""Rear  Window"", I thought I'd seen all his best ones - until last night.  I  watched ""Shadow of a Doubt"" for the first time and realized why I  love Hitchcock's stuff so much!  His every story seems to give you one  genuinely innocent person to cheer for who continually gets into one bad  situation after another.  This movie is no different!  It grabs you from  the beginning and takes off in a hurry!  The tension builds slowly from the  first few minutes of the family's first dinner together and then goes into  overtime at the end.  By the time Charley starts falling victim to several  ""accidents"" from her Uncle's hand, you know you aren't going  anywhere until it's all over.  There are far too many plot twists and  grabbers here to mention.  Suffice it to say that this is vintage  Hitchcock, and it easily goes into his top 5 movies.",965952000,,896,4.48125
311011,5,6301065573,"To say Hitch's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" is a great film would be fair; but in all honesty, looking back on the films (hundreds by now, maybe thousands) I've seen, there are few that have left such an indelible  impression on me.
By now, everyone knows the story of Uncle Charlie and  his adoring niece and how she slowly uncovers the truth behind her  mysterious uncle's past.
What's brilliant about this movie is the way it  foreshadowed and still influences movies today. Think of ""Blue  Velvet"" and its portrayal of the naive small town boy uncovering a  secret to his sleepy little town. Or even ""The Third Man"" just a  few years later where, ironically, Joseph Cotton finds the truth about his  best friend, Orson Welles.
What makes this film endure is its theme: The  loss of innocence. the innocence of Teresa Wright's adoring neice (watch  the brilliant scene in the bar where she sits down with Joseph Cotton), the  innocence of Charlie's family and of course, the innocence of Santa Rosa  itself.
Perhaps Hitchcock and Thornton Wilder were prophetic in the way  they mapped out the loss of America's innocence especially after the war.  (the film was released around then). Look at our society now and how  everything has changed. The 50's were looked upon as the decade we lost our  innocence (Some even point far later to the Vietnam war as the period that  ended it) but Hitchcock back in the 40's was saying that everything was not  all right, and that bad things just didn't happen in dark alleys and dark  houses, that it could happen on the sunniest of days and in most Apple Pie,  White picket fence homes.
And then, of course, is the equally superb and  brilliantly understated ending where Joseph Cotton's Uncle Charlie is being  mourned in his death as a hero is equal parts chilling and darkly amusing.  Hitch's point? That we still live in denial, that we may need people like  Teresa Wright's Charlie to keep the lie hidden, because we aren't able to  look at ourselves in the mirror and see that dark side and embrace it.
No wonder this film was Hitch's fave. Hitch loved to explore the dark  side of the everyman (or every woman) and along with Strangers on a Train,  Vertigo, Rear Window and Psycho, they form a collection of films that  perfectly dissects the human condition and this theme.
A truly great film  worth watching over and over.",958089600,,2364,4.656174334140436
311012,5,6301065573,"Nowadays, most people have not heard much about this film compared to some of Hitchcock's other more famous works.  The fact that this was one of his favourites alone makes it worth a look.  But the film itself is outstanding  and should be seen by more people.  Teresa Wright, one of the best  actresses of the Forties, delivers another terrific performance as the  adoring niece of Joseph Cotten who discovers that her Uncle may have a  secret that would destroy her whole family.  Her developing suspicion is  credibly presented as clues are dropped like only Hitchcock can, and the  viewer is able to completely sympathize with her as she must shoulder the  burden of her knowledge alone.  Cotten quietly makes a menacing villain in  one of his best performances.  The two stars are well supported by Patricia  Collinge as Cotten's loving sister and Wright's mother, and by a very  quirky Hume Cronyn as the next door neighbour whose hobby is  (appropriately) murder.  The screenplay builds the suspense slowly but  steadily, and there are a number of trademark Hitchcock shots.  I may be  biased because Wright, Cotten, and Hitchcock are among my favourites from  the Forties, but I think everyone will agree that Shadow of a Doubt is an  excellent suspense film.",955756800,,1268,4.9052132701421804

As in most of Hitchcock's best works (REAR WINDOW, my personal favorite,  PSYCHO, VERTIGO, ect.) this film starts out telling one story then takes an  abrupt turn and leads the viewer down a totally different path.  You are in  the master's hand as a piece of putty from then on.  A great cast really  makes you believe they are part of that little town that looks as though it  could have been a blue print for the one in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  Outside  of his work with Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten has his finest hour in this  film, particularly in the climax on the train.

But, on  repeated viewings, the beauty of Teresa Wright's performance as  ""young"" Charlie emerges as the film's most winning quality.  At  the start, she's a dewy-eyed, highly emotional young lady awaiting Uncle  Charlie as a white knight who'll dispel the mundane boredom of Santa Rosa.  As the real Uncle Charlie emerges, Wright darkens and deepens her character  until, in the final confrontation with Joseph Cotten, there's a righteous  ferocity that's almost chilling.  One of the best performances in the  Hitchcock canon--which is high praise indeed!",933724800,,906,5.614814814814815
311015,4,6301065573,"Alfred Hitchcock was in the grave long before the DVD era, so there is no director's commentary on ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" but ""Beyond Doubt,"" a documentary about the making of the film included in this edition, offers enlightenment.

Patricia Hitchcock, the director's daughter, confirms that ""Shadow of a Doubt"" was her father's favorite film. He got a kick out of introducing evil into a peaceful small town. Did Hitchcock agree with the villain, Uncle Charlie, when he characterizes his adoring niece as someone who dreams her ""peaceful stupid dreams"" and knows nothing of the real world which he calls a ""hell""?

Uncle Charlie regards those who live in small towns with borderline contempt, thinking they are naive and stupid, unaware of the horrors beyond the white picket fences that surround their homes. But Hitchcock and Thornton Wilder may be suggesting that big city sophisticates like Uncle Charlie secretly resent those who are content to devote their lives to their homes and communities, and are not burdened by the ambition that drives others to seek gratification for their lusts and egos in the more hectic and probably life-shortening environment of the cities. Before television and other forms of mass media invaded rural areas and helped stamp out independent thought and conscience, those who dwelled in remote, slow-paced areas were less susceptible to ideas that challenged their values.

It is the contrasts between cynical Uncle Charlie and his pure at heart niece, Young Charlie, that makes ""Shadow of a Doubt"" so fascinating and worthy of repeated viewings. Uncle Charlie mocks religion in a scene in which his niece returns from Sunday church services, asking his niece if the congregation has gotten smaller. After all, the ""show"" has been running so long at that point, he wonders if it can still attract much of an audience. There was a full house, she replies, a look of satisfaction on her face at having proved her once beloved uncle wrong.

""Shadow of a Doubt"" is ultimately about the battle of good and evil as it is played out in our own backyards and living rooms. The two Charlies may be, as Uncle Charlie says, ""twins,"" but they're still opposites.

But though ""Shadow of a Doubt"" was Hitchcock's favorite of his films (and it's one of my favorites, too), it's still better in parts than as a whole, and misses the mark as an example of absolutely top-flight Hitchcock. Part of the problem is in the casting.

Teresa Wright is wonderful as Young Charlie, and Joseph Cotton is delightfully cynical as her murderous Uncle. Henry Travers, the angel of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as Young Charlie's banker father who relaxes by swapping murder plots with a shy neighbor played by Hume Cronyn, is fun, as Cronyn is himself in his film debut.

The rest of the supporting cast leaves something to be desired, though. MacDonald Carey is a smug bore as the detective on Uncle Charlie's trail, and Wallace Ford isn't any more appealing as his partner. Patricia Collidge as Young Charlie's mother and, of course, Uncle Charlie's sister, has a wide-eyed stare that suggests foolishness even if she's only attempting to appear gullible, and Edna May Wonacott as the bespectacled book reading younger sister, is too much the wind-up doll, a little too smart and condescending, a template for the unconvincingly wise children in Steven Spielberg's later films.

Then there's the waitress in the nightclub that Uncle Charlie forces his niece into visiting after he follows her when she storms out of the house in a rage. Played by Janet Shaw, she has a sleepy indifference that seems meant to suggest that she's defeated by life. That's fine, but the film suggests that working as a waitress in a bar is an example of having been thorougly corrupted. It's the last stop on the train to Hell. It's a fairly laughable portrayal, not unlike the way other films of the era depicted librarians as sexless spinsters whose emotions were as tightly controlled as the buns in their hair. There is a librarian in ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" but she strays from that mold just a bit because of her age which I would guess to around 60.

""Shadow of a Doubt"" is very worthwhile regardless. The writing, credited to Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson, and Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville, but with input from the director, is generally outstanding, and, when it comes to Cotton's speech (what Peter Bogdanovich calls the villain's ""position papers""), quite shocking.
