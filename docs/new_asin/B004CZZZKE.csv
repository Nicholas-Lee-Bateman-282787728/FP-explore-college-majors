4331151,3,B004CZZZKE,"The DVD-R I was sent was blank, so we asked for replacement...the replacement still had no content on the disc! Gave up and now asking for refund. I saw this movie many years ago, it's good, looked forward to seeing again... but I guess it's just not meant to be.",1435104000,,263,4.28
4331152,1,B004CZZZKE,"I didn't get around to trying to play the DVD until yesterday.  It is completely defective and both of my DVD players display a message ""will not play"" when I try to play it.  Amazon ABSOLUTELY rips off its customers by only having a 30-day return window.  It needs to be 60 days.",1432512000,,280,4.245283018867925

4331156,1,B004CZZZKE,"I really wanted to watch this movie. I know someone that is related to the real person that owned the ranch. I tried 3 times, bt none would play in any of my 3 DVD machines or in any of my two computers. You issued a credit so thanks, but I had asked for one to be tested before it was sent. This apparently did not happen.",1401494400,,323,3.8358208955223883
4331157,2,B004CZZZKE,"This is one of my favorite Ed Abbey stories. It illustrates everything that is wrong with the unitary state, whether you find yourself on the left or the right end of the political spectrum. The casting is ghastly..NOTHING about John Vogelin is represented by the guy who plays him. Haven't watched it for awhile, but as I recall, they sanitized the hell out of the anti-war sentiment that the book contains. Bowdlerized by the modern state, I say.",1400544000,2,448,4.756410256410256
4331158,5,B004CZZZKE,"This documentary on the 1994 Storm King Fire was well done for its time, although it does seem somewhat dated today, due to new technology in documentary production. However, it is still very informative and gives you pause as to what happened that day and the lives lost. A well done program on what really happened that day and the lessons learned. Recommended to anyone interested in wildfires or to those who fight wildfires.",1356912000,4,429,4.8108108108108105

8424594,1,B004CZZZKE,"This is NOT a review of the film.  I've seen the film on TV and it is fairly good though not as powerful as Abbey's novel (and it changes some details).  My review is about the product.  Despite the fact that many people said they ordered the movie only to receive a blank DVD, I went ahead and ordered it.  I received a DVD case with a fairly professional-looking insert.  But the DVD was blank.  I returned it and asked for a replacement.  The replacement came--and it was blank.  I returned the second DVD and asked for a refund.  In order to actually receive the refund, I had to call Amazon.  They then credited my credit card.  In other words, it was a waste of time and effort.  If you Google the company that actually sells the DVD, dvdbargainbuy out of Owings Mills, Maryland, you'll find a fair number of negative reviews and a low BBB rating.  If you decide to go ahead and purchase this, good luck.  I wish there were a legitimate copy available to purchase.",1490918400,,970,4.376404494382022

8424598,3,B004CZZZKE,I liked it because I remember when it was actually happening in NM. What they did to that poor man was way worse than what they showed. Like actually pointing tanks at his home. It's actually a good movie to remind us of what could happen to anyone of us.,1476403200,,255,4.12
