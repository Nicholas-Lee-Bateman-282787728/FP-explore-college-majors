7954882,4,B00005UM2C,"I got this DVD as a surprise for my fiance. I did a lot of research before hand on different videos. I wanted one that was sexy, but tasteful and informative. This video definitely fits the bill. All the subjects are fully nude but it is still informative and instructional. My only criticism would be that it moves a little fast. And it seems to detract from the overall experience a little when you or your lover have to keep hitting pause to keep up with them. You will, however, learn a lot of great massage techniques and the lucky recipient will receive a relaxing full-body massage. You are first walked thru a complete back and leg massage. Then you are taught a very thorough frontal massage that literally ranges from head to toe. This was a lot of fun for both me, as the giver, and him as the receiver. I can't wait until it's my turn to be the receiver!",1050364800,12,866,4.351851851851852
7954883,5,B00005UM2C,"I am always saddened to remember that in our culture today, men are mimimalists when it often comes to affection, to the openly receptive acceptance of intimacy and loving that usually accompanies sex preferring instead the canned and conditioned variety they've learned to expect instead from the plethora of superficial media programming that will not address their hearts and minds as well as their sexual organs. The ones that define the size, characteristics and shape of the women in whom they will be interested without giving them the benefit of making their own choices, suitable for the needs they are taught to recognize in themselves, and for themselves. If women are encouraged to have a choice, certainly men should also exercise, with appreciation, the choice they are deemed to have, without channeling them into the narrow confines of conditioned responses through which they lose their individuality, an individual's most prized asset, and the one that permits the great diversity of our unique ability to express ourselves to others. Removing those finer qualities no doubt robs us of the opportunity for loving, as well as our individual style that makes loving worthwhile. No women prefer ""dummy men,"" any more than men prefer ""dummy women,"" as if none of us had the interesting capacity to define our own sensitivities and style, by instinct and by exploration. There must be clones in Hollywood to produce the exact replicas of programmed robots who each express themselves in the same manner, so predictable, and so flawlessly configured. How boring!",1049328000,6,1574,5.200787401574803
7954884,5,B00005UM2C,"This is a great DVD for couples wanting to move beyond the the 5-minute back rub.  It's a sexy DVD, but also tasteful. Lots of nudity, but that's helpful in copying the techniques.  It teaches leg and foot massage and also full frontal massage techniques.  It's great foreplay, and my girlfriend had no complaints when I tried it out on her!",1033084800,4,341,4.557377049180328
