They tried to make it a fairy tale.  A narrator in voice-over tells most of the story; there is almost nothing remaining of Shakespeare's script.  It runs about a half-hour, and the effort to abridge and tidy it up for the eyes of children resulted in the nunnery scene (for example) vanishing as mysteriously as does Ophelia.  The lines it includes are mangled beyond recognition.

While Hamlet isn't a story for children (so why make the adaptation?), this is just insulting.  If you find anything worthwhile in Shakespeare's story, don't inflict this on your kids:  they'll get scared when you start shouting at the screen.",1132876800,,767,4.9375
