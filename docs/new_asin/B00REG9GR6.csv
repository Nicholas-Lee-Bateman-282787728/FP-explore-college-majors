6929295,5,B00REG9GR6,"My kids were so excited about this Sid release! With over 25 mini-episodes, they got to learn and laugh with Sid and his friends about various topics all on the same disc. It is the perfect DVD for short car trips because of the brevity of each clip, yet my kids were introduced to important concepts that spurred their interest for further investigation. The DVD covers a little of everything including math, time, science and astronomy. With a run time of over 100 minutes and a bonus episode called ""Get Up and Move!"", this release is a great value and a must-have for the curious kid!",1430006400,,588,4.556603773584905
6929296,5,B00REG9GR6,"This is a great DVD for kids.  Especially if they love Sid, like our two-year old daughter does.  The only thing is with some of the clips the voices don't seem to match the movement of their mouths.",1429747200,,199,4.2105263157894735
6929297,1,B00REG9GR6,very short clips.  each clip over in seconds.  not happy with this one.,1429660800,,71,4.384615384615385
6929298,4,B00REG9GR6,"Typically I would give any Sid the Science Kid 5 stars, my almost 4 year old is obsessed with Sid and loves to re-create his experiments at home. I really like how everything is explained so that kids can understand how science is everywhere in their lives-personally I'd never think to elaborate on the science aspect of a lot of my son's questions, the answer I'd usually be inclined to give would be a basic 'because, that's why' Now, as to why I only gave this DVD 4 stars, it has a lot of episodes, but instead of starting at Sid's house in the morning where he discovers something he'd like to investigate further at school, learning about it with his friends, then returning home and reiterating the lesson to his family these are 'mini' episodes, only a couple of minutes apiece. While there is still a lot of good information presented, I think it's really fast paced within each episode and a lot of the explanations Sid receives on this DVD fall a lot more in line with the 'because, that's why' that I can manage to give myself. I know that my boy isn't bothered by the fact that the sound doesn't always match with the animation (some has been reused from previous shows but new words dubbed in) but it's kind of annoying for me. Finally, we have quite a few Sid DVD's since we don't have TV and can't watch on PBS, so most of the shows on here are repeats of full length episodes we already have. All in all, considering how much my son enjoys Sid I would buy this one again, but out of all those we've purchased this one is my least favorite, in my opinion it gets 3 stars, but my son's 5 star rating boosts it to a 4.",1427414400,4,1633,4.288025889967638

This was her first Sid the Science Kid movie and I am sure we will be seeing more of him!",1430438400,,247,4.166666666666667
