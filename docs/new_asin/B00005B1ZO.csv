1420067,5,B00005B1ZO,"Well, I have to admit there is a bit of a rocky start to this series...But it doesn't take away from the fact that this is the BEST ANIME EVER!!!  Although, I do like the ending to the actual series better than the ending to the OVA's. I hope that you will watch the 1st & 2nd season to the series before watching this or you will have NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON!  The first OVA series (1st 3 episodes in this set) are very confusing and aren't in the manga.  They are just an intro to the second OVA series (last 6 episodes in this set).  These are well done, but aren't necessarily needed for the story to end.  For you people who liked the way the series ended, I wouldn't recommend these unless you want it to end in a totally different way.  But it will always be my favorite Anime.
Series order: Suzaku Box-1st season
Seiryu Box-2nd season
Oni Box-OVA's",1026432000,4,857,4.195121951219512
1420068,5,B00005B1ZO,"Well what can i say about this show only that it has much improved. For instance Miaka is no longer a crybaby and Tasuki still needs to mature a.... lot! Chichiri ungoes a lot of changes
for one  he is finally letting go of his past. All the fallen warriors are back and still the same. I really wish that the series will contiue so you will see Tasuki grow up.
  All in all the warriors have not changed at all.",1024876800,,412,4.061728395061729
1420069,5,B00005B1ZO,"I'm a huge fan of Fushigi Yuugi. If you are too, you should get this OVA boxed set!
The Fushigi Yuugi OVAs take place a bit after where the original series takes off. The first three episodes on this DVD are from OVA I, which is simply an anime-only filler to explain how Taka (Tamahome) made his way into Miaka's world. The next six episodes are from OVA II, which in my opinion, is great. It contains many new enemies and many new surprises.
My personal favorite episode on this DVD is the 8th episode (which is OVA II episode 5). It focuses on my favorite character, Chichiri. In it, you learn all about his past, and he winds up fighting someone very familiar to him...I won't spoil it, so if you want to know, buy the DVD!
This DVD is packed with action, adventure, fighting, and romance (No, I'm never going to get over that super cute Tasuki/Chichiri scene in OVA II eppy 5...heh heh heh...). If you're a fan of the series, you should get this DVD! You won't be disappointed!",1007337600,6,982,4.371584699453552
1420070,5,B00005B1ZO,"The TV series of Fushigi Yuugi was one of my favorite anime series ever. Filled with love and adventure. Best of all, keeping you on your toes after the first death of a main character, making you wonder who will actually survive since being a main character in this series didn't guarentee life like most animes.
I did find that the series wasn't a need to be made. They just prolong the ending of the TV series in this OAV series. I mostly watched this for the ""Mysterious Play-ing around scenes."" If you love the Fushigi Yuugi a lot though, it's worth picking up. Just keep in mind that the first Video Series is not even close to as good as the second video series on the OAV.",994636800,4,680,4.3203125
1420071,4,B00005B1ZO,"Of all the anime series I have seen, Fushigi Yuugi is simply the best.  The plot is great, and the series ended well, but the OAVs are definitely a good ending to the ... well... ending.  For those who haven't seen the 52 episode series, you will be very confused, so you should probably see those first. (^.~)
I admit that the first three OAV episodes are REALLY confusing, and a lot of people may not like them at all (Sad to say, I was one of those people).  The villain just came out of NOWHERE.  I didn't get that.  But don't be dispirited!  The other six episodes make up for the first three, I assure you!
Also, a very wonderful part of the OAVs are the ""in-betweeners.""  This are ""mini-episodes"" about the characters that give you a good laugh between episodes that don't give you much of one.  So, basically, you still get comedy, even when the plot doesn't provide it!  A very good thing it is, trust me.
As some of you may have guessed from earlier episodes, Tasuki develops a love for Miaka.  ( ...interesting...)  The seishi falls for the priestess, despite Miaka's love for Tamahome, who is now Taka.  While Taka struggles with his two sides (Taka & Tamahome), Tasuki tries to win over Miaka ... but sorry, can't tell you what happens!
Also, Chichiri's old friend (you know, the one that stole his girlfriend ...;.;), Hikou, returns.  The ninth episode leaves it open for another sequel (hopefully there will be one!), that's the reason for ""End(?).""
Saying anything else would probably spoil the story, so I won't.  My last statement to all you faithful Fushigi Yuugi fans is this:  Don't be disappointed by the first three OAV episodes; ultimately, the OAVs are worth every cent.",992736000,30,1695,4.6033333333333335
1420072,4,B00005B1ZO,"This final DVD set for Watase Yu's famous anime series, Fushigi Yuugi, contains the 2 OAVs that were released.  The first OAV has 3 episodes which concerns itself about how Tamahome couldn't stay in the real world as his current form while a new evil comes out of NOWHERE.  The second OAV has 6 episodes which are about the new evil returning and just tying up loose ends.  This brings the series to a finish.  Personally, the OAVs did not give me the same effect that I got from the TV series.  The stories in the OAVs seemed random and so out of place.  Because they were so random, when they got to the real story at hand, it felt way too rushed.
The animation is updated from the TV series.  Because Miaka and the others are older, they retain a new, mature look.  I think the OAVs in general are for a more older audience.  There is some nudity that is actually more detailed than in the TV series.
The music gives the same feel but obviously with a more darker mood.  Most of the songs are sung by Akemi Sato (who sang the opening to the TV series).  Songs are nice, different ones for each OAV.
Accompanied with the OAV series are these fun little sigments.  For the first OAV, there's a trip to a hot spring that only girls are allowed to enter.  So you can see all the *cough* fun they have there.  The second OAVs have these outtakes of the episodes that are extremely weird and random.
Final Note:  While the FY TV series ended well in my opinion, this basically just concludes it even more I guess.  Price might seem a little steep for just 9 episodes.  But then again, it's good quality, it's Pioneer, it's Fushigi Yuugi!  Even though the OAV series wasn't too good, it is definately worth watching.  And if you bought the DVD box sets (Suzaku and Seiryu for the TV series), you'll probably want this to finish off the collection.",989712000,32,1843,4.351906158357771
1420073,4,B00005B1ZO,"The Fushigi Yugi OVAs are the conclusion to the series.  The first half was not written by the original author.  The first half (3 episodes) was more confusing than enjoyable.  Infact I know many who refuse to acknowledge it's existance.  However the second half (6 episodes) is much better.  Throughout we meet a variety of old and new characters.  The art and the music is wonderful as always.  Plust there are hysterical Super Deformed scenes in between each episode filled with inside jokes for Fushigi Yugi fans.  I think it is a worth while investment ""no da?"" (You know)",985651200,5,577,4.757575757575758
1420074,5,B00005B1ZO,"First things first: the editorial review is incorrect.  The discrepancy pointed out there is not a discrepancy.  When Tamahome gets sent back to the book, he is being tricked into thinking that it's 50 years after the battle, when it really was not nearly so long.

I think, not only was the storyline great, and convoluted, but it was just a wonderful next step for an amazing anime.  They really put love to the test, and we get the chance to go deeper into some of the characters.

There is some racy stuff, which I personally felt was not completely necessary, but it's there.

In all, it was very, very good!",1134432000,2,613,4.4774774774774775
1420075,4,B00005B1ZO,"Some Spoilers indicated.

The first 3 episodes will confuse anybody who did not see the series, and make sure you pay close attention to details so you won't get lost because it is possible. If you read Charles Solomon's review, there are some major errors in the plot. Yet the whole thing about 50 years passing when Tama arrives then only 2 years when Taka and Miaka go together is not one of them. For those of you who don't understand the whole ""Tama being Nakago thing"" *SPOILER* it's because Tomo created an illusion which make him think that 50 years had passed, etc. Tech none of that really happened. This was all to convince him that his body and soul were switched with Nakago in order to poison him.

If you are wondering how Tamahome was able to be reborn, it will be explained in those first 3 episodes, but otherwise I thought they were poorly written. *SPOILERS* Yui's hair is longer which is impossible because it couldn't have grown overnight. Also it signifies that the girls are in hs with their new uniforms, etc, when really they had just finished entrance exams at the end of the real series. The stupidest change is that it shows that Miaka met Taka at a restaurant and he was her waiter instead of her brother telling her that he found someone that claimed he was looking for his true love.

The rest of the ova is quite good tho. There's a 5th priestess and you'll prob be a lil suprised to who it is. You get to learn more about Chichiri who is awesome. Taski is also so cute, and you'll see how the bonds between him, Miaka, and Taka changed. The plot is a little confusing though for most people, but if you pay attention everything should be okay. *SPOILER* Hint for those people who get lost when they see Taka and Tamahome. Taka is the real one.

Best part of the ova. The hot springs scenes inbetween! Amiboshi and Chiriko are just so cute. Anywayz those inbetween scenes make the ova worth while. So it gets 4 out of 5 stars for those mistakes. Def. a good buy.",1122508800,3,1995,4.3983739837398375
1420076,5,B00005B1ZO,"DO NOT LISTEN TO MICHELLE FROM ANAHEIM! I'm sorry to say this but maybe you didn't understand this series much because you don't have a mind. It's actually quite easy to understand if you just keep on watching. And sure, it did puzzle me when I saw Taka and Tamahome as two separate beings, but that's what builds up the story line. And what helps build up the story line is what makes it better. I actually liked this OVA. It was creative and kept me wondering what the hell was going to happen next. The only part I hated about it was the incest thing... and that's nasty. But other than that, I love the rest. Tamahome couldn't be more hotter haha. But I liked him better in the beginning of the SUZAKU SERIES. He was more funny and entertaining, he still is, but he seems too stuck to Miaka. But other than their love, there is more to this anime. I couldn't explain how good this anime is because you'll just have to see it for yourself. It's excellent I'M TELLING YA! It's a must-get.",1120780800,2,990,4.2994652406417115
1420077,4,B00005B1ZO,"This OVA was all about tying up loose ends.

We all wanted to know how Miaka was able to see Tamahome again.  We wanted to know what happened to the rest of the Suzaku warriors (the living ones, anyway; because at the time, the dead didn't have anything going on, except for appearing to give guidance to the living and an ending to their story).  We wanted to know what happened to Miaka, Keisuke, Yui, and Tetsuya.  We wanted to know what happened to the surviving Seiryu warrior.  We definitely wanted to know what happened to the Universe of the Four Gods.

Well, my questions were answered...somewhat. Tamahome (aka Taka Sukunami) doubted who he was so much that he didn't believe who he was anymore, and then almost drank himself to death in the first attempt at disillusionment.  I ended up liking him a lot less in the OVA than I did in the cartoon series.  That was the only dislike I had in the whole OVA.  That was the big disappointment to me, though his personality did a 360 during the cartoon series.

Other than that, because of Yui's vindictive jealousy (that was inevitably exploited by Nakago), she remains caught in a state of utter self-doubt and was stripped of all of her warriors.  It also shows how their friendship changed, as well as themselves.  Miaka isn't so immature; Yui isn't so proud--or jealous.  Or vindictive.  Or in other words, a bitch.  Tetsuya loves Yui as is, and I'm happy for her, though Keisuke should've had a girlfriend too!

If you like the cartoon series (and watched them all), this just shows them who they are a year later.  If you had some questions, and the ending didn't do you any justice (even if you did cry at the very end), this will answer them--only in the Mysterious Play way.  I can't give everything away (though I pretty much did at this point)!  You can take it or leave it; your choice.",1119744000,,1854,4.513513513513513
1420078,4,B00005B1ZO,"Having come from the Sailor Moon line, I loved Fushigi Yugi because it pushed the envelope more. It's a mature version, and full of soap opera story lines that addict viewers like me. This OVA pushed the envelope a little more, which made it even better. The story is a little hard to grasp at first since it just jumps into the anime with no opening or anything. But once you get into it, you're hooked (and thankfully not up another 26 hours).

And the small comedies at the end are so hysterical. They make the OVA worth every penny.

I found the ending to be absolutely perfect, and a wonderful way to ease out of FY addiction. I have not seen Eikoden, but don't wish to. After the series and the OVA, I'm not going to ruin a good thing.

DO NOT WATCH THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE FULL SERIES!!! There are many spoilers, it's meant to be a pure sequel as it picks up right where the series ends.

4 stars only because of no intro or ending.",1116806400,3,945,4.204419889502763
1420079,5,B00005B1ZO,"I started to watch Fushigi Yugi when I first ordered Vol. 1 and then I knew that I have to watch it all, so I couldn't wait till all the volumes are released and ordered the two box sets with the OVA and I don't regret it. It is true that the box sets are expensive somehow but it is worth it. Now I can say that I watched the 52 TV series episodes, 9 OVA series and the Eikoden and they are all excellent. I thought that Ayashi No Ceres is the best, but I was wrong and I found out that Fushigi Yugi is far more better than ceres. Yu Watase is one of the best anime creators and I can't wait till they make Alice 19th a TV series. Anyway, this OVA Boxed Set is a masterpiece. I especially love the Ending Theme of the first two episodes. To tell you the truth, I missed Nakago and Hotohori. It is true that they appeared in the episodes, but they were no more than phantoms or ghosts, so it wasn't that effective. I agree with Ms. Watase that Nakago is one of the best characters and he is one of my favourites too along with Hotohori. I was hoping that Miaka will end up with Hotohori somehow but it didn't happen. It is not that I don't like Taka aka Tamahome, but I think that he is better off with Yui. I liked Yui far more than Miaka and she became a beautiful lady too. I think she and Tetsia can make a good couple. Tasake is a good character and an attractive one too. What can I say more? All I can say is that I will miss this anime and I will always remember it. I'm trying to read the manga now, so I placed an order for the first volume. It is my first time that I ever read a manga. I usually watch the series directly, so I don't find it necessary to read the manga, but I will read Fushigi Yugi. I want to thank Yu Watase for such a great project and the Director for such a good work. I also extended my thanks to Amazon.com for always providing us with such excellent animes for if it weren't for Amazon.com, I don't know what I was going to do. To all of animes freak, watch this one and never miss it. Be sure that you won't regret it.

1420080,2,B00005B1ZO,"while the previous two boxed sets followed the manga faithfully, this ova series did not.  i bought it in hopes of it helping me understand the ending (i read the manga in chinese. in the last few scences, the chinese got too complicated for me) the ova series does a really job of making confusing the parts that were perfectly clear in the manga.  unless you're really faithful fan or really desparate to find out what happens after (now that u know there is an after), i wouldn't suggest buying it.",1052697600,3,501,4.4945054945054945
1420081,5,B00005B1ZO,"The second installment to this series,well I don't believe it could have been written any better.  The animation was flawless, the character voices are still the same (which with any fan knows, is very vitale.), all the characters are once more apart of our lives, and the story line carries you even deeper into the universe of the four gods then you were before.  What was important and so wonderful about this OAV was that you could still feel for these characters.  Cry and laugh and fight along with them.  The villian was supreme, because it was a denom and yet it was something the watcher could see inside themselves.  The worry about the worth of oneself. I reccomend this to any shojo fan.  Any anime fan at all.  It has everything you could want.",1051056000,3,757,4.562962962962963
1420082,5,B00005B1ZO,"I can't help but write reviews on the Fushigi Yugi series, it is my favorite, as you can tell if you read my previous two reviews.  The Fushigi Yugi OAV continues with excellence in this nine episode continuation.  And as a reminder, the OAV's are far more dramatic then the series, a reason why there are omake theatre sequences at the end, so hopefully you won't be too depressed at the end...didn't work for me though.  For other fans of the series, we all know it's a tear jerker, but I'll get into that later.
For fans of the series, you will probably most definitely agree that the OAV is very heavy on the heart, and the one reason that I am so passionate about this show.  The OAV is broken up into two ""parts.""  The first three episodes of the series will definitely make you confused as all hell, but thankfully it's explained by the third episode.  If you are a fan of Tamahome and Miaka, be ready to tear up, if you are truly into the series, you won't help but tear up.
Thankfully, all of the Suzaku Seven return, in one form or the other.  And again, they have to be reassembled, and finding the spirits is a little more tuff.  And there's a new cast of villains in the OAV.  Tomo, who isn't as great as Nakago, is the psychotic leader of the ""evil"" side, and his group of evil comrads don't come close to the original Seryiu Seven.  You'll miss Nakago for sure.
As I stated before, the first three episodes are tear jerkers, but wait until you see episode four.  It is for lack of a better word, gut-renching.  I even know guys who were torn up over that episode.  Don't get me wrong, there are some other light moments, but it is pretty emotional.  The other episodes that follow continue with the same route.  You grow to love the characters more and more, for they have all grown so much as individuals.
Miaka for one thing, will not annoy you as much, promise.  She has evolved into a smart, less gluttoness, and stronger person.  She does depend on Tamahome, but can you blame her, they spent all that time trying to protect the world, and protect eachother, and just because the first part of the series is over, don't be stupid to think the dependency is over with.  There's also an interesting twist about Tamahome, which you will either love, or absolutely hate, I haven't seen too much of a middle ground.
Nuriko is back, and wiser and still the best friend of Miaka, but he grows even closer with Tamahome's character, and is one of most positive characters in the OAV.  Tasuki is still the comedic relief, while Chichiri has an episode that actually revolves around him and his past, which you did not see during the regular series.  It is quite refreshing.  Hotohori is still a bit whiney, but I still love him...and it's obvious that he's over Miaka, thankfully.
Like I've said, this series is something I can talk hours about, which is why I can rarely say anything ""bad"" about it.  You'll love the OAV if you loved the series, it is thoughtfully made and devised.  Yu Watase us a goddess when it comes to certain aspects of manga/anime, she has a talent for drama, and great characters.  Too much to say, but I highly reccomend this to any FY fan, and/ or anime fan.",1050451200,15,3197,4.416382252559727
1420083,4,B00005B1ZO,"It's nice to see FY nicely animated (in consistency) for once. The 1st OVA was strange, the manga hadn't gotten to the OVA story yet so they just made the first part up resulting in weird stuff (Tamahome is Nakago?). The 2nd part was pretty good, but it got too sappy in some places. Also, why did monsters keep appearing out of NOWHERE and attacking everyone (the teddy bear) so our happy heroes can go ""Ugh oooh, energy.....ugh, going out.... of me...."". So then Miaka can be saved by Hotohori or one of the Suzaku shichiseishi and say in her mind ""Taka......"" or ""Hotohori........"" or ""Tasuki........"" or ""Chichiri......."". That's very annoying and incredibly predictable which is why Fushigi Yugi can never be as good as it could be, because of little things like these, and they just pepper the whole series and OVA. Anyway the ending was good and the whole thing was well-animated with good music. I'm still trying to find the CD with some of the FY 2nd OVA music.",1029888000,3,970,4.645348837209302

I was pleasantly surprised! It is different and it can seem a bit convoluted, but if you pay close attention you will be able to find out what's going on quickly and realize where the plot is going. The ending is a bit weak, and Taka is a bit emo, but these little slights can be overlooked. Tasuki undergoes a change but that is because he realizes he has feelings for Miaka and becomes possessed by an evil spirit (he manages to exorcise it with Taka and Miaka's help). And also, alot of people will notice this part of the series is mainly about Taka recovering his memories even though Miaka is still a major part of the plot.

7936360,2,B00005B1ZO,"I liked the first half of the Fushigi Yuugi series, Suzaku, very much. The second half, Seiryu, not so much.
The OVAs, however, are worse than the second set. Although I didn't much care for the ending of Seiryu, it did end, and I didn't much see the point of having more.

The first OVA is about some evil in the book world that they have to deal with. Beware, definitely a mature rating here, and even if the bad guy is cool, I didn't think much about the rest of the story.
The second OVA takes place when Miaka is pregnant, and much older. It goes back into the book to fight against a stupid girl from Miaka's world who tries to mess things up. She's really annoying.

Both OVAs you get to learn a little more about some of the characters, but really some things are better not knowing and going through. Although it was inevitable Tasuki falls for Miaka at one point, the way this happened here completely ruined his image, and my opinion of him has been hard to repair.

Really, the best part of the OVAs was the in between stuff. It's this nonsense story about the two sects (Suzaku and Seiryu people) going to a hot springs. The funniest stuff happens when they're in the buses, and it's just hilarious; using the twins to write insults to the other sect, the accurate portrayal of Miaka and Tamahome ('Tamahome...' 'Miaka...' 'Tamahome...' 'Miaka...' with little flowers and sparklies...), and more. Cute.

There were also some good outtakes, but also some very lame and/or embarrassing ones.

The music was good, once again, and the art stayed pretty and aged the characters very well.

So if you really, really loved the entire series, and are OK with a mature rating, go ahead and get these OVAs, if not only for the Hot Springs nonsense story.

Otherwise, you might try D.N. Angel, Peacemaker, Knight Hunters, Fruits Basket, or a number of the other great anime titles out there.
Also, if you liked the Fushigi Yuugi music, you should definitely look at getting Fushigi Yuugi Super Best Collection, and because there are so many great voice actors in the series, Memories: Character's Vocal and Fushigi Yuugi Best Vocal Collection are a must.",1163548800,,2156,4.628272251308901
7936361,5,B00005B1ZO,"I will try to write a review of the entire Fushigi Yugi series so that you can have a complete (and overall) picture of this wonderful anime. Therefore, if you don't want to know what happens next then please stop reading the specific section because spoilers will be included all over in the review that is to follow.

Apart from it, I will try to maintain an overall review so that to inform the reader as much as possible without giving too much away.

Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play - (Boxed Set 1, Suzaku)

Two fiends, Miaka and Yui - the typical Japanese high school girls- will come across a book called the `Universe of the four Gods' and will be drawn into it (SPOILER! The book basically presents itself to be something like a gate to a parallel universe with the difference that the gods of this parallel universe are the ones who `choose' whom to allow to enter and why, something that will be implied latter on, in the second box set).

There, the two girls will be confronted with a world that is divided into four kingdoms and resembles Ancient China, but each of the girls will end up in a different kingdom as a priestess of the kingdom's god; and their goal will be to gather the seven `holy' warriors in order to summon the god. The catch: the girls will be enemies. On top of that, Miaka will deeply fall in love with one of her warriors, Tamahome, who will love her deeply as well but: Yui will want him two; the emperor will love Miaka etc.

The first arc, deals more with the story and character development, the viewer learns a lot about the world/kingdoms, the citizens agony etc. Of course all this will be accompanied with a lot of action as well.

Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play - (Boxed Set 2, Seiryu)

This is the continuation of the first arc. Now that the viewer has gotten into the anime, the story takes off. After failing to summon Suzaku, the warriors will have to find two holy ornaments in order to achieve it. The story starts to get darker and darker, very emotional and the actual conflict between the two parties of holy warriors takes place, and the true feelings of the love triangle (Tamahome-Miaka-Emperor) will be tested; is their love destined to fail? Additionally, characters that you will learn to love, from the first arc already, will die (be it children, men, women, warriors, emperors or whatsoever)... Last but not least, the final battles will also occur not only in the Four Gods Kingdoms but also in our world as well, because the universes will start to collide (may sound confusing but once you watch the anime it is easy to understand, it is just if I will start to explain it I will give the story and twists away, sorry guys). What will be the end?

Fushigi Yugi :The Mysterious Play OVA Boxed Set

Tamahome is now Taka (well, re-incarnated) and lives together with Miaka in our world. However, trouble occurs once a very powerful and dark force tries to escape from the world of the four kingdoms and wants to come and to destroy our world. Now again, the couple will be drawn back into the book, travel forth and back into the universes, the Suzaku Seven are gathered again and hell brakes loose; because the love of Miaka and Tamahome is in serious danger (not to mention the worlds as well).

Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play - Eikoden

This is, for the time being, the last of Fushigi Yugi that is out there. In these OVAs, Tamahome and Miaka are married and she is pregnant. However, a girl named Mayo will enter the book of the four gods as a new priestess of Suzaku and will try to: steal Tamahome from Miaka, who will fall into a coma, kill the Suzaku Seven, take the child of Tamahome and Miaka as her own etc. Tamahome will enter the book but the world he once knew is starting to fall apart...

Overall opinion about the series:

Personaly, I believe that this anime alongside with Escaflowne, tops every other anime in the Fantasy genre. It is very emotional, has strong character development, solid and very interesting story with way too many twists and will keep you hooked up till the end (that is something that will happen for sure hehehe)

As for the animation:

The first arc has a fair animation but still a good one (in order to get a picture, the animation is something like crave of the fireflies). The second one is updated (something like Trigun). In the first OVAs the animation is definitely updated (something like FMP). Last but not least, in the last OVAs the animation remains in the same level as the previous OVAs but the creatures' animation is something like the ones you see in Digimon (well, personally I preferred the way they used to be in the previous OVAs).

Music:

The music, no matter arcs or OVAs, opening or ending, is very - very good and emotional. You will love the music in it.

Worth buying or not?

I will be honest. Personally I love these series and bought all of them. However, the price may present itself to be an obstacle (took me two years to buy the complete show). Therefore, if you can afford it than buy it for sure and you will not regret it; if not, than try to rent it if possible because these shows are definitely worth watching. Not to mention the fact that the series all together are very long (something that I liked).
