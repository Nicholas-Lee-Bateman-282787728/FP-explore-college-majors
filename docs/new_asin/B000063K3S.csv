7959521,4,B000063K3S,"Peter Coyote plays an ex-pat photographer, roaming the streets of Brazil. The opening scenes show not only his fascination with street life, but also some flashes of unclad prostitutes as his models, one of whom ends up dead. He becomes a suspect while he tracks the real killer through a Fellini-esque landscape, and still finds time to interact with his European girl friend.
This was mildly titillating - memorable mostly for the street scenes and attractive hookers who keep getting bumped off, and some interesting knife fights. Shot on location with some Portuguese dialect (!), this well-made film, with a thin but interesting plot and somewhat predictable storyline, is pleasing to the eye. I'd rather watch this than TV on a bored night at home.",1064275200,,754,5.04
