2472927,3,B000CSTK4C,"Not too long ago I was browsing a DVD bargain rack and found a collection of the original ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons. Remembering how much I enjoyed them in theaters as a kid, I picked up the DVD thinking my little boy (3 1/2) might like them. Well, he did. But in viewing them, I thought these were really made for an audience of mostly adults and my little boy probably couldn't understand most of the humor. Well, he liked to watch them anyhow and every once in a while I'd hear a big chortle. Well, the next time I was at the store, I found a collection of ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons made especially for a children's TV program. They looked much the same but the stories and language were angled toward smaller children. My boy enjoyed them too. Then next I found this collection of ""Baby Looney Tunes (Volume 1)"" with baby versions of the Looney Tunes cartoon characters such as Bugs Bunny, Sylvester Pussycat, Tweety Bird and others. So I bought this set of cartoons especially for my little boy.

He enjoys the cartoons, there's no question about that. But the stories and characters and even the animations are really dumbed down to a very low level. The word sappy comes to mind. It's hard for me to watch along with him. It's just too corny. Even the music is corny. Especially, the music. I can't help but feel that if you want him to appreciate music, why play this really dumbed-down corny stuff for him. And again, he likes the cartoons, but he likes the more adult ones better. Finally, the other night, I asked if he wanted to watch the cartoon again and he said no. I asked what he wanted to watch. He wanted to watch the Green Man (Shrek 2). Well, I think that is saying something. I suppose every child is different and you ought to gear the viewing to a level that is appropriate. Clearly, my boy prefers the more adult things, and I think he's right. However, the ""Baby Looney Tunes"" cartoons are nicely made and most kids are just going to love them, I'd guess.
