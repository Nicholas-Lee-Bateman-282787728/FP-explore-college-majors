8638730,4,B00I3NKWN6,"Echo Bridge Home Entertainment manages to package movies that most of us never heard of, but more often than not, drop in a few diamonds in their groupings, and at a great price. This collection is no different. Along with a couple of stinkers (Road of No Return, Burning Daylight), there a few hidden treasures here. In order of my preference: 1) Nobody 2) Gunshy 3) Braille 4) Crosshairs 5) Tunnel Vision 6) Formosa Betrayed
7) Burning Daylight 8) Road of No Return. Will be watching Nobody, Gunshy and Braille again.",1434758400,,519,4.714285714285714
8638731,3,B00I3NKWN6,These are older movies. The quality is not bad but some of the movies were old fashioned. It's okay for someone who likes action movies.,1407110400,2,136,4.48
8638732,5,B00I3NKWN6,"Just got this in the mail yesterday, and after flipping through the discs I'm very pleased with the quality.  Even though they squeeze 4 movies onto each disc, the video bit rate manages to stay in the teens and offers a very pleasing picture.  I noticed one of the films (can't recall the name...it was shot in 2.35:1) has an annoying, oversaturated and soft quality but I'm betting it's the original film/video provided and not the Blu-Ray mastering job.  Each movie has a DTS-MA 2.0 track, seemingly at a constant 2 Mbps bit rate.

It's also nice having a no-frills menu without forced trailers, letting you jump right into each movie.  If you can find a copy as cheaply as I did, hard to go wrong even if you watch them all and only like one of them.

Obviously the videophiles won't be interested in this given the compression, but honestly I think it still blows away any HD stream online.  When you compare it to the same types of multipacks on standard DVD that shrink the files down to a video bit rate of about 2 Mbps, these BD50 discs are leaps and bounds beyond in terms of technical quality, and for a low price.",1398816000,4,1125,4.432038834951456
