8148596,3,B000J10HVC,"The original quality of the movie is often washed out in details in faces...and uneven exposure. The music was exsessivly upbeat for no reason in the first part of the movie but settled down somewhat afterwards.
It took a bit to figure out if this was a comedy or a serious movie. the Captions were humorous and the pratfalls and such soon suggested a farcical movie. A boxing movie... not my favorite type. And Boris Karloff had little more than a bit part... and not typical Boris fare at that. Still any silent movie I'm glad to have, though this one was only fair. Entertaining enough but not brilliant on any level. pretty much average fair and any new person to the silent movie genre would probably not want to see too many more after seeing this one first. Though 1924, the quality of the original movie appears to vastly inferior to the date.",1354233600,,851,4.532467532467533
8148597,2,B000J10HVC,"DYNAMITE DAN is notable to modern audiences primarily for a relatively youthful Boris Karloff, who has a few scenes here as a construction site foreman. This is a supposed comedy with few laughs and an overabundance of visual joke repetition. The career of the film's star, Kenneth MacDonald ended with the silent movie era (1928).

SYNOPSIS--
An angry Dan McLeod (MacDonald) punches his boss (Karloff) unconscious, and is then accused of stealing company funds. When Dan later visits his girlfriend they're attacked, so he knocks the assailant out with a single blow. This feat is winessed by a fight manager who convinces Dan to become a pro boxer.

ALPHA VIDEO's transfer of ""Dynamite Dan"" is of questionable quality; at times the picture is too blurry.
