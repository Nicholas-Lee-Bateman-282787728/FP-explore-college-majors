8269841,4,B0018JKLRY,"This series may go down as one of the more underrated titles of the year. While it took forever to get to this point, anyone who has stuck with the series this far no longer have any reason to turn back. The seeds have been planted for Shizuma/Nagisa and Amane/Hikari. With as many twists at this these five episodes take, audience members are in a place where it's impossible to predict what will happen next. This is more than a yuri series, this is a prime piece of drama. Reccomended.",1222646400,,488,4.433333333333334
8269842,5,B0018JKLRY,"Strawberry Panic is great.  I was really surprised at how interesting it turned out to be.  Plus there is lots of really good relationship drama, and for a show that aired on tv there is a surprising amount of (non-graphic) sex.  This may be a turn-off for some, and the show is NOT appropriate for small children, but if you are looking for a good romance and are not averse to the fact that all the romances are girl-girl, then Strawberry Panic is the title I recommend to you.",1220227200,,479,4.359550561797753
