8090503,4,B000BP50VI,"I've purchased two DVD editions and one VHS copy of ""Under the Red Robe"" from Amazon. The DVDs are the Alpha Video version and the Synergy Entertainment one. Along with this VHS copy, all leave something to be desired.

The film transfer on all three is dark, and far softer than even a 1937 film should be, but the VHS copy is superior to the DVDs. The soundtrack is scratchy and noisy, making the dialogue often difficult, though not impossible, to hear on all three versions.

Oddly, the Alpha Video version replaces the soundtrack for the opening titles with a rather cheesy score. The proper soundtrack commences after the titles. The Synergy Archive Series edition has the full soundtrack, but their DVD lacks any chapter indexes, or even a menu!

I actually got the best video quality, and no-worse audio, by purchasing this $5 used 1987 VHS copy by United American Video Corp (through Amazon) and transferring it to DVD.

All that said, this is a wonderful film and is well-worth viewing, even with only these unfortunate choices to choose among. Hopefully, a good clean DVD copy will some day be available.",1301270400,4,1115,4.791666666666667
8090504,2,B000BP50VI,"Under the Red Robe, 1937 film

The film tells about the Huguenots in 17th century France who were disliked by Cardinal Richelieu (the red robe). A man is called ""the Black Death"" because he is a deadly duelist. Richelieu has banned duels, four thousand noblemen perished last year. [No course on anger management?] He is ruthless and cruel, but it is for the good of the state. Drink and gambling lead to passions. Can one man succeed where an army has failed? The baron gets a new servant for his mission, then arrives at the Castle of Foix. Can Raymond steal the diamonds that are intended to pay for the rebellion? There is a secret passage to escape from the castle when the King's Troops arrive. The drama continues, Raymond returns the lost diamonds. [No questions asked?]

The King's Troops search the castle and find Raymond. He is arrested for aiding the enemy, but escapes. The story continues. The Duke of Foix returns from Spain. The King's Troops make a surprise entrance. The Duke is captured and on the way to the Bastille. Will Gilles free the Duke and his sister and return to Paris alone? The King won't see the Cardinal, he is in disgrace. But the flight of the Duke means the rebellion is over without the cost of bloodshed. A clever solution by the Cardinal. The Cardinal punishes Gilles by banishing him to the Castle of Foix with Marguerite.

This is an average drama set in 17th century France that is careful to avoid any controversy. ""The Three Musketeers"" was a better story set in the same era.",1268179200,,1522,4.608856088560886
8090505,4,B000BP50VI,"This was the last movie to be directed by the great  director Victor Sjostrum whose best work was in the silent movie -such as his masterpiece The Wind-and while not the movie he is likely to be remembered for it is a decent swan song .Shot for British based producer Alexander Korda it is a stylish and unusually dark example of the mainstream costume dramas -dark in look and mood.

Conrad Veidt is Gil De Berrault ,a man so adept with the sword and so inclined to duelling that he is known by the unflattering nickname ""The Black Death"" (after his dark clothing)in 18th century France.he goes too far and is sentenced to hang until reprieved by Cardinal Richlieu,the power behind the throne .Richlieu (a commanding performance by the fine Canadian actor Raymond Massey) offers him a deal -his life in exchange for infiltrating a group of Protestant rebels and bringing their leader back in captivity to face trial and possible death. De Berrault accepts and is able to win the confidence of the rebels but complications ensue when he falls in love with the leader's daughter (Anabella).The busy plot also involves purloined diamonds anmd mistaken identity before he returns to Paris to await his fate at the hands of Richlieu.
Veidt is ideal as the sinister but ultimately principled De Berrault possessing  a feline grace in his movements allied to great screen presence and he gets good support from Romney Brent as his accomplice

The sets are impressive -sparse and grey ,dominated by stone and looking rather more spartan than in more opulent costume movies of the era. The use of light and shade anticipates the shadowy style of the film noir from the next decade

This a solid period piece and should take its place on the shelves of all who love the costume picture",1195948800,,1776,4.771986970684039
8090506,4,B000BP50VI,"Victor Sjostrom's final directorial effort is made in England by the resourceful silent film taskmaster, and he is aided by a competent cast, magnificent score (Arthur Benjamin) and a clever scenario (Arthur Wimperis) in this engrossing historic drama which deals with the efforts of Cardinal Richelieu (Raymond Massey) to quell rebellious Huguenots in 17th century southeastern France. To achieve his purposes, Richelieu employs the services of Gil de Berault (Conrad Veidt), a dashing swordsman, to serve as a spy for Catholic King Louis XIII, assigning the duellist to travel to Foix in order to infiltrate the castle of the Huguenot leader, the Duke of Foix, wherein Berault falls in love with Lady Marguerite (Annabella), the Duke's sister, and where many adventures take place during the course of this romantic, witty and exciting film.",1141344000,3,843,5.345864661654136
