2790068,4,B000O5B4BU,"In spite of the horrible language, Deadwood is very well acted.  I have no doubt that the misfits that inhabited the original Deadwook were a tough bunch.  Rough though it is, I recommend Deadwood, but it is not for the faint of heart or those under age 18.",1196985600,2,257,4.333333333333333
2790069,5,B000O5B4BU,"Just the thing to watch when the winter storm blows outside!

2790071,5,B000O5B4BU,"Any fan of Gene Autry, Lone Ranger, John Wayne, Tom Mix, Jimmy Stewart, Hopalong Cassidy and the like will probably want to steer clear of this one; unless they want to see what they've been missing.  There are no perfectly swept thoroughfares, perfectly pressed, colorful, and unstained riding clothes, no singing cowboys, and endless shots from a six-shooter.  This is what the west really was; gritty, dangerous, and dirty (dust or mud; depending on the weather).
  One of the greatest series I have ever seen.  I cannot say enough about it, but due to limited space, let me just say that it ranks up there with Rome and Band of Brothers for setting, story quality, and acting.  I'd say of the three, this series was my favorite for characters and setting.  See it!",1195948800,5,768,4.7293233082706765

2790081,4,B000O5B4BU,Excellent Western for the gold miner in all of us.  Shocking language is artful and yet realistic for the times.  This is beyond your John Wayne Western as it reflects the hard edged reality of life before 1900 in American West.  SHOCKING.,1484179200,,239,4.642857142857143

2790111,5,B000O5B4BU,"Great HBO series if you like old west action stories with plenty of foul language and GREAT ACTING.  All characters are fully described and presented perfectly for the story lines.  This is a complex series with more plots, subplots and action than any other series I've seen in a long time.  Great entertainment.  One caveat,  when I say foul language, I am not kidding but it does put the stories in perspective.  Loved the series and I continue to watch it over and over again.",1449446400,3,480,4.588235294117647

2790118,2,B000O5B4BU,"Unsatisfying, by and large, for me. I watched it because there wasn't anything else I was interested in, at the time, and because I'm an Olyphant fan from ""Justified.""  The murders were absurd. No justice for hardly anyone killed. At least, the gold baron should have been mercilessly slaughtered and his Pinkerton gang destroyed. The dialogue was crazy. Since when did those in the Old West speak like they were all Shakespearean actors?  Most of the episodes were the same: It was all about maintaining a bit of power by keeping up on what your opponents were doing. Not great stuff.",1443139200,,585,4.782178217821782
2790119,5,B000O5B4BU,"A story about an illegal town on Indian land in the old West. It is earthy, gritty, with enough swearing to offend the crustiest of people, and fights and murders to keep you up at night.

And they waaay overdid the Shakesperean language thing - it was just silly and mostly incomprehensible.  Other than that I liked it a lot, but would not watch it again due to the aforementioned go**amned f**king silliness of verbosity, Horatio!",1440806400,,386,5.295081967213115

2790125,5,B000O5B4BU,I never buy DVD's of shows or movies because they just sit on the shelf never to be watched.  But this one is different.  The best show on TV. I hope the producers re-visit this gem.  There needs to be a movie made because it was that good.,1439510400,,240,3.9583333333333335

The whole selling point of the show wind up to be nothing more than tedious profanities, nudeties and distasteful sexualities. I was really enjoying it until the final episode of the final season.

It's intriguing, addicting, brash, stunning accounts of the many characters that keep your interests on HIGH mode throughout the series.

The twists and turns that take place in this developing ""Gold Rush"" town of Deadwood, display the many instances of just how the meek were downtrodden and most times perished, while the strong bullied their way through as they took matters into their own hands. You get to see glimmers into the characters past's and how they plowed through the challenges in their lives.

Deadwood was not a place for the weak, but a place to prove your resilience and stamina. It's an amazing story of what people can do (or would do) to achieve their goals whatever the cost.",1431302400,,797,4.685714285714286

You know... low-light, 1800's, oil lamp lit scenes; they just fall apart into extreme graininess. Some of the darker-lit scenes are almost unwatchable, like a worn out VHS tape.

2790199,5,B000O5B4BU,"The first thing that strikes on first viewing is the seemingly gratuitous bad language but it very quickly becomes part of the experience and recreation of the hard living early gold-rush. Thereafter you are drawn into the lives of the various characters and as series one and two progress the dialogue becomes almost Dickensian with the occasional Shakespearian soliloquy thrown in; yes, it really is that witty, clever and beautifully creative. The cast are universally superb; irrepressible, improbably honourable and compassionate saloon owner Al Swearengen (played with great aplomb by Ian McShane); irredeemably drunken Jane Canary (Robin Weigert - forget any images of Doris Day you may be harbouring); greedy and obsequious hotel owner E.B. Farnum (William Sanderson); upright but short tempered Seth Bullock (Timothy Oliphant)... the list goes on.

In season three, however, things fall apart a little. The episode synopses disappear, it doesn't follow smoothly on from the end of season two (in fact I had to check that we were watching the first disk of the series), new characters are introduced with no apparent plot to support their presence (witness the brief appearance of the Earp brothers and the utterly pointless theatre troupe) and the script seems to lose its earlier virtuosity, perhaps through the absence of Ed Bianchi as producer. Throughout the season, animosity builds between the odious mining magnate Hearst and Al Swearengen, but the skilfully managed tension just fizzles out in a most unsatisfying (though plausibly realistic) ending.

As with every other HBO series we've watched, the production values, casting, script and attention to detail are unrivalled and a few minutes in Wikipedia give testament to the attempt at historical veracity (with an acceptable level of poetic licence).",1420934400,,1822,5.411971830985915

2790210,5,B000O5B4BU,"Deadwood is HBO at its best... Though one of HBOs first television series, in my opinion, it is one of the best. The sharp writing, the spot on acting, flawless direction and perfect cinematography give us one of the most beautifully creative tales of historical fiction.

The violence can be brutal at times, the place of women in this mans world sheerly harrowing and hopeless, and the language runs foul from minute one until series close. Yet all of these graphic portrayals are accentuated to give the viewer an authentic feel of what it was actually like to live in Deadwood at the time. A place technically not part of the united states. With no laws or real regulations!

One of the most fascinating topics I think this show captures ( which I've never seen another show attempt) is how a settlement transforms from camp to town. If only we could have been blessed with a few more seasons. This show was surely cut earlier than it deserved to be.

On top of the great quality series, Amazon was great as they always have been. Order came on time and in the condition I requested.

Deadwood is simply sublime. The story, the writing, the acting, the sets...I could go on and on but these have all been mentioned many, many times on these reviews. I just wanted to advise any new fans, and maybe old re-watchers that Alan Sepinwall over at Hitfix spent three recent summers reviewing the series again and to his faithful readers great delight, we were treated to running commentary from several of the series stars. Jim Beaver - Ellsworth, Keone Young - Wu, and W. Earl Brown- Dan especially contributed wonderful stories about production.

2790273,2,B000O5B4BU,"Everyone should watch the first season. It is wonderful. Keith Carradine was never better. But after that, the writing goes all over the place, and a fine group of character actors are just wasted, and given nothing to do. When the acting is better than the writing, all the actors can do is a lot of sassy dookey-polishing. The writers can't write female characters at all. It's embarrasing to watch. For all of seasons 2 and 3, the women just stand around wondering if they're gay or not. The only gal who is given a fair share of dialogue is Robin Weigert, who galumphs around like a foul-mouthed oompa loompa in male drag. The writers/producers bring in some black characters too, just to prove that they're Hollywood liberals, I guess. While it's fun to watch Franklyn Ajaye drink with Calamity Jane, he's never given anything interesting to do. The Asian character Wu has just one joke which is milked to death. Powers Boothe does an increasingly one note impression of Snidely Whiplash, snarling, hissing, and mean-mugging the whole time. Brad Dourif gives a committed and dynamic performance in the corny old role of the town doctor. The language is fun to listen to. But all the folks who say it's Shakespearian are blowing pretensious smoke up their own bung holes. When the writers can't figure out what else to do( a recurring problem), they stick Ian McShane with a kidney stone. This gross out lasts half a season or so. Ian McShane's Swearengen has a fresh shot of whiskey in his hand in every new frame. Swearengen's drinking pace seems to be about 2 or 3 fifths a day. When the writers can't figure out a new spin on an over-used cuss word, they have Swearengen pour more shots. At that rate, any middle-aged guy would be dead in a month. Things liven up a bit when Gerald McRaney arrives with his Pinkerton goons. The ending is realistic enough, but mighty depressing. The only thing that holds this whole mess together is the charisma of Ian McShane, who is one of those charming, mercurial actors who could perform the phone book, and keep it compelling. I waited years to watch this, and then spent good money to buy the whole set. I doubt I'll watch it again.",1402963200,3,2181,4.638242894056847

2790277,5,B000O5B4BU,"I have been to Deadwood in the early 1970's. And yes the brothels were still there.
I had seen this series when it was aired on HBO. Since purchasing, i have watched twice and still am amazed at the writing and the dialog.
This is such a artistic piece of work. I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn the history of Deadwood. AMAZING!",1401667200,,341,4.2615384615384615
2790278,5,B000O5B4BU,"Deadwood's reputation, like many of HBO's series, precedes it, although in this case it's a mixed one. Critics cite Deadwood's unrelenting and extremely profane language (the compound word c-s-er is used so much, it becomes a source of comic relief), as well as considerable sex and violence. Given that some premium tv shows delve into gratuitous excess simply because they can, their real value can only be accurately measured by the writing and acting. In this case, Deadwood more than measures up favorably to its more famous peers. In my opinion, this is a prime example of television at its finest.

To be honest, this unfortunately short-lived series took a while to set its hook. The first eight or so episodes had yet to convince me of anything special. Then, almost magically, things started to coalesce and I found myself deeply immersed in the drama, violence, and comedy of this program. To borrow upon the copious consumption of alcohol in the series, the impact crept up on me like the dizzy sensation you get after drinking one too many shots of whiskey. Before you realize it, you're knocked out.

The biggest factor in the transformation, and the show's brightest star goes to Ian McShane who plays the irascible, acerbic, and intimidating Al Swearengen, the proprietor of the camp's main saloon/brothel The Gem. It was about the time that this character became fully fleshed out that the spell was finally cast. His character is without doubt the driving force in the series, but as in any quality program, one superb performance cannot alone sustain success. The mix of historical and fictional characters such as Sheriff Seth Bullock, Charlie Utter, E.B. Farnum, Sol Star, Dan Dohirty, Trixie, Doc Cochran, Alma Ellsworth, and Cy Tolliver are among some of the most engaging and well-crafted roles, each brilliantly portrayed. But it's the brilliant lines they are given that make this show so memorable and pleasurable. The writing is superb; flashing theatrical soliloquies with period-era, savage, and purposefully ludicrous ignorance, each perfectly counter-balancing each other. Simply put, if you're a fan of the English language, you'll relish the dialogue, and might even find it more rewarding to watch with the closed captioning on just so you don't miss a word.

Over a mere thirty-six episodes, it won't take long to indulge in the entirety of this glorious reinvention of the Old West (I found the brief Earp brothers appearance to be particularly gratifying, given the near-deification of them in American cultural mythology). The worst part is that you'll doubtlessly end up longing for more. It's escapist joy with every tug on a whiskey bottle, every slosh through the muddy thoroughfare, every sexual escapade, every drop of blood, every weapon fired or knife wielded, and every palpable stench in this fetid frontier wonderland. Like Rome, another HBO historical drama that ended far too early, Deadwood walks the thin line between history and poetic license like an acrobat. Thankfully, despite the unintentional end, the final episode has a feeling of closure that is satisfactory enough to suppress the greed for more. It was enough that I was able to savor this rare entertainment treat, and I highly recommend you do the same.",1401580800,,3271,5.110280373831776

It is extremely graphic and true to the historical period.  My only complaint is not with the quality of the series (which is incredible) but with HBO for making the idiotic decision to cancel it.  Just following the remaining goldrush period the the town of Deadwood they could have easily written two or three more seasons.  HBO upset a huge number of subscribers myself included when their ""bean counters"" made the executive decision to cut short the best product they put out in years.",1398384000,,645,4.672566371681416

2790299,5,B000O5B4BU,"David Milch's ""Deadwood"" found a strong cult audience and kudos unfortunately it wasn't enough to save the series from being axed by HBO due to cost (HBO wanted to use the money to develop further series) along with the historical drama ""Rome"" (after two seasons).

SPOILERS:

The high quality writing of the series and the fact the fact that the series was based on real historical characters and situations in Deadwood, South Dakota after prospecting exploded there. Merchant and former U.S. Marshall Seth Bollock (Timothy Olyphant) and Sol Star (John Hawkes) head to the prospecting town to open a hardware store for the miners. The married Bollock becomes involved with Alma Garrett (Molly Parker) after her husband is suckered into buying a gold mine that was believed to be tapped out. Garrett's husband is killed to cover up the scam by Al Swearengen's (Ian McShane) employee Dan Dority (W. Earl Brown).

Wild Bill Hickock (Keith Carradine) asks Bollock to become Garrett's representative as Swearengen and others try and buy the claim from her. When Bollock's wife (Anna Gunn) arrives with her son, things become complicated for Bollock and things become further complicated as George Hearst arrives to try and buyby hook or by crook all the claims.

END OF SPOILERS:

A rich, marvelously written and imagined series (full of profanity, nudity, gore and sex--so be aware!), ""Deadwood"" may have been shot in the back by HBO of the head much like Hickock but that doesn't stop this from being essential viewing. Although Milch was offered funds (in a half hearted attempt to quell upset fans and Milch) to wrap things up in a pair of two hour movies, the series still stands very well on its own without having all the loose ends tied up. For those who haven't viewed all three seasons--rest assured that the story arc of season three is largely concluded.

The blu-ray looks exceptionally good with a nice transfer with deep, rich blacks and colors that positively pop. You can almost taste the grit and smell the manure of the camp.

The audio is top notch with a strong sounding  DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio mix that is immersive--you are put into the action of the series.

The special features are exceptional for this set. We get a 17  commentary tracks for the entire series ( some episodes feature multiple commentary tracks and usually featuring the actors and/or writer-producer-creator David Milch) . We get four strong featurettes on the making of the first season including one on the real Deadwood.

The second season includes a sequel short documentary on the historical Deadwood specific to the events of the season two along with a 70 minute documentary on the making of the last episode of season two giving valuable insights into the creative process of the show.

The third season likewise features a short documentary on the events that occurred in real life in Deadwood and how they are reflected in the fictional series. We also get a featurette on the evolving relationship between Swearengen and Bollock. The second and third season also has photo galleries comparing the real characters to their fictional counterparts.

The big plus with this three season set is the 13th disc that features exclusive where Milch discusses his reaction to the cancelation notice and the lack of follow through on the a possible fourth season or the pair of feature length films that HBO had offerred to bankroll to close out the series.  Milch is surprisingly honest about his feelings regarding all of this given that this was produced by HBO. We also get another historical featurette and a 60 minute question and answer discussion  with the cast of the show. Closing out the special features is ""Deadwood 360"" where Milch and his production designer give us a tour of the sets and an amusing ""Deadwood Audition Reel"" where comedian Titus Welliver impersonates famous actors as if they were auditioning for the Swearengen.

The discs are housed in a hardcover ""book"" and slide out. For the DVD edition this was a bit more problematic as DVDs tend to scratch more easily than Blu-rays. If you're concerned about the discs becoming scratched you could put them in stand alone Blu-ray containers.

Prematurely cancelled, ""Deadwood"" was (and remains) a terrific series with strong performances and writing. While it won't be everyone's cup of tea, the terrific direction and production values make this a keeper.",1397433600,,4422,4.962110960757781

The performances are some of the best starting with the always amazing and so talented Ian McShane as legendary AL Swearengen. He rules the whole cast with his dangerous and sometimes humorous wit. The next is Timothy Olymphant as Sheriff Seth Bullock who matches wits with Al while keeping order in this growing town with so much going on. The rest of the cast makes for the best drama,humor and moments of heart wrenching in a western town atmosphere. Some big names of the old west visit the town as well like Wild Bill Hickok,Calamity Jane,Wyatt and Morgan Earp. Some stay longer then others. I have to note that I also enjoyed William Sanderson for contributing to the comedic element of the show.

2790348,5,B000O5B4BU,"I remember the original roll-out of the movie and for some reason I could not watch it long enough to enjoy it. In my search for a western with semblance, I came across Deadwood just recently. After watching the first episode, I was completely intrigued and taken in. The true nature of the time was captured in a realistic manner---leaving a trail of blood and guts to linger. From human eating pigs to a runaway horse, the story was never complete and always moving. The villain is likely to win the hearts and minds as the owner of the Gem Saloon. The monologues in some ways were overdrawn and somewhat painful to get through but the dialogue throughout the series was like being in a theater. Could it be possible that people actually had the knowledge to talk the way they did back in that time-period. For an uneducated lot of cutthroats and con-men, they sure had a way with words. I also wonder where the old-money came from---the people who had it, really had a lot, and those who had nothing really did have no way to gain an upper hand.

I would have liked to see more of Wyatt Earp but his character was short lived. Also, why a great gunfighter like Wild Bill would not have his back against the wall in a saloon did not make any sense. Calamity Jane had a weird character--sometimes tough and at other times a wimp. She had too much dialogue in the series but was a formidable character.

The Doc did not have the same makings of a doctor of a town in the old west. He was hard to like and even hard to attach too. He had some good traits but sometimes talked about things that really did not matter. Was a driving force of sensibility but for some reason it was not drawn out in his character. Toward the end, when he was talking about the little girl experiencing the loss of her parents---he really did not make sense of it all.

The fight scenes were challenging to watch due to the graphic violence---but were probably as realistic at the time as possible. Beating a young girl in the middle of the street and feeding her to the pigs left much to be desired. Tollerver's, the second big Saloon owner, old friend disappeared in a weird way and I guess he took some money and ran---this could have been established better.

The end of the series 3 was a real drawback to the whole entire three. For sure, there were supposed to be a few more, or at least one more series. Ian McShane carried the movie--especially when he talked to the chopped off Indian head in a box---his character was certainly tarnished from what was a terrible childhood. How they all arrived at this place would have been an interesting piece to identify.

How could a series end with a Saloon owner wiping the counter tops of his bar?

The foul language for such a show in its time setting should have been a clue this was 90% plus HBO / Hollywood...truth took a back seat to this series. It is almost like the worst of today punk street thugs were in charge of the script? Language so offensive that ""over the top"" is a serious understatement. It is like Hollywood and the DNC got together to corrupt the history of this story just as they have today's generation thus has helped create a culture of corruption, within government . This story is such a load of BS it is almost hard to watch, that no doubt led to it never going on to another season. I am ashamed I  bought such a foul mouth peace of garbage, and I am no prude, I work in the real world and the writing of the script is just pure garbage. By the ratings you would almost think every HBO employee was forced to write a 5 star rating...lol. I have to give credit where credit is due, 3 stars for acting, but the script gives it an unbiased -5 stars. So predictable of HBO / Hollywood...lol. They even tried to tie BS about racism within the culture toward American Indians, I have no doubt some of this was present during that time, but what Hollywood and current day history teachers say differs from the truth. Many American Indians partnered with with new American immigrants to fight savage Indian tribes..thus the calling of certain Indians as savages, some were, plain and simple others were reasonable and looked for allies to fight such savage tribes. That part so reminded me of brain dead family members that I have to hear about how bad American Indians were and are treated, I don't blame them, today many teachers are teaching from rewritten American history rather then the truth of what was written before the 20th century.",1394323200,6,1937,4.456338028169014

I thought it was just a TV series, with over the top language, nudity and killing. I did not look further into it's background, I was unaware until the end that it was based on real people, in a real town called Deadwood. As to it's historical accurateness, I'd have to say most all of that, with exception to their names, was ad libbed.

2790373,5,B000O5B4BU,"HBO's ""Deadwood"" is as much about the western movie genre as it is about Deadwood, South Dakota, during the 1870's gold rush.  In an interview, Milch explained that the familiar conventions of movie westerns were first created by the Eastern European Jews who filmed movies in the early 20th-century.  And what did Eastern Jews know about the authentic Old West?  Almost nothing.  Thus, Milch sets out to film a western that reverses many of the stereotypes, from a muddy, chaotic mining camp to a deeply conflicted and flawed lawman who skirts legalities and disregards crimes when convenient, to a foul-mouthed saloon/gambling parlor owner who runs whores instead of employing ""dance hall girls"" and who feeds the bodies of his victims to the hogs, to legions of slovenly miners and townspeople, most driven by greed rather than a desire to build a community (but a community emerges nonetheless).  Milch's one concession to the stereotypes is that he preserves the nifty gun belts with the quick-draw holsters (at the O.K. Corral, like many of his contemporaries, Wyatt Earp carried his pistol in his coat pocket).  And Milch's characters are not our contemporaries in period clothing.  Most are emotionally blocked individuals unable to articulate their softer feelings and who express their solitude through anger, resentment, and explosions of violence.  Along the way Milch knocks the halos off of icons like Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.  But one of Milch's most retroactively foresightful gestures is to present the character of George Hearst, the mining tycoon and forerunner of modern capitalists who moves in on the mining camp and soon finagles almost every worthwhile claim.  In a camp full of thieves and cut throats, Hearst is clearly the most evil, a crude forerunner of today's billionaires--just as unscrupulous and just as unmindful of the public welfare and the impact on his wealth accumulation.  He is a taker masquerading as a maker, his gold horde being extorted from the hardworking miners who first discovered and worked the claims.  And future belongs to him and his ilk.  Milch expresses his regret that he did not get to film a fourth season but the third season brings all the closure necessary.",1392422400,3,2232,5.0989010989010985

Too much of a certain kind of violence that I can't just dismiss or stuff down, and I get squinchy.  But, the characters and acting are all extraordinary, and I was so sucked in by the end of the show that I lamented greatly its demise.  The characters that you think are so evil end up having a lot of good in them, and the ones you think are good end up having some bad -- so you end up rooting for all of them.  And hard times, such as in a town like Deadwood, end up producing hard decisions for all the characters; decisions that can't possibly be black and white.

A lot of research went into this and I could kill the audience for not letting us have the fourth season! However, the characterization, the illustration of the subculture, the outright lawlessness that took place in deadwood at that time is right in front of you!",1387584000,,606,4.672897196261682

The DVD's were good but the Blu Ray delivers as promised. Sharp, clear picture. I have not yet finished the entire series on Blu Ray but what I have seen is great. I also like the packaging. The DVD's I have are in three separate boxes, one for each season, the Blu Ray has all three seasons in a single box. While I really liked the artwork on the DVD sets, I like even better the way the Blu Ray's are packaged. There is great artwork and each disc fits into a very nice pocket on each ""page"".

2790418,3,B000O5B4BU,"Well, there are issues with this series.  If you are in any way bothered by a constant litany of foul, profane language I suggest you avoid Deadwood. I mean, it's really bad. I couldn't believe what I was hearing at first - or seeing!  Some scenes are quite sexually explicit and graphically violent. Lots of racial epithets and references which is indicative of the time and setting of Deadwood, a gold mining town in the  Dakotas in the 1800's.  The town is run gangland style by the saloon owners until statehood is on the horizon at which point the town fathers appoint themselves to various offices including Timothy Olyphant as the tough but conflicted sheriff.  The characters, despite their flaws, have depth, and the acting is first rate.  If you  can make it through season 1, you will be desensitized to the foulness and find yourself immersed in the story as the town and its inhabitants evolve. I'm guessing the series was cancelled after 3 seasons as it ends rather abruptly.",1386028800,,989,4.748538011695906

2790423,2,B000O5B4BU,"I was really hoping for a better crafted show, especially in light of the reviews Deadwood has received. However, the entire premise just doesn't seem ""believable"" to me. These characters continuously use very ""modern"" foul language. Practically every other word, in fact. They fly into an angry rage at the slightest exchange, that often seems overkill to me. The violence seems very extreme to me. For instance, pigs that eat dead people, that are owned by a Chinese man that only grunts and stares. How much human flesh can pigs eat, really? Apparently intelligent women presented as whores who are savagely beaten and then go sleep with the one who beat them to then be kicked out like trash in the morning? A very tough sounding female who breaks down quickly crying as a ""softy"" when the guy walks past her? I am sorry, this whole thing just seemed to be too formulaic and not believable at all. As opposed to, say, the characters of ""Lonesome Dove"", who are deep and have a historicity to their dialog that lends credibility.

2790425,5,B000O5B4BU,"This show was a great addition to the HBO lineup. Not only did people actually show up in realistic clothing, but they actually looked dirty. (How often in the rifleman/Bonanza did they ever get dirt on themselves even when fighting) The way the characters were portrayed, there was no good person in the entire camp. Everyone had flaws and they were brought out pretty much ever single episode. Yes there was swearing, and a lot of it, but who is to say thats not how it was , and in fact gave it more color than most shows who shy away from anyone uttering a single curse.
This show has everything, from murder, adultery, child prostitution, betrayal, whorehouses, whiskey galore, opium addicts, Chinese workers, hostile takeovers, sexual deviants, epilepsy, political intrigue, disease. Pretty much every single thing that is illegal today happened in this camp. It was after the civil war, but before equal rights/child labor etc. Dont expect a tame show, expect something to view and just be intrigued with, sometimes hating a character, only to respect them, then hate them again soon after.",1385164800,2,1097,4.935135135135135

2790464,5,B000O5B4BU,"Deadwood is another brilliant and enthralling series that HBO knocked out of the park. The kind of programming that pretty much only it and AMC have on right now. This show is crude, offensive, shocking, sensitive, endearing, hurtful, and amazing all at once. With the power struggle that happens between the three main powers of the show, and after watching Game of Thrones, it will show like comparison to the underlying story. Different factions, all trying for power positions in the world. The world in this case, being Deadwood, SD during the Panhandling Gold Rush. The casting in this show is bar none, and the performances given by many characters, high and low on the totem pole, are absolutely stunning. Ian Mcshane makes one of the most stern, honest, brutal, yet somehow likeable characters in any show I have watched, film or TV. Timothy Olyphant, wooden walk and all, makes a great bid in his role and performs it well, but a lot of the background characters reall push this to excellence. There are so many actors in here, odds are you will not know all the names without looking, but it is fun watching this with friends and seeing them say, ""Hey there's Lassie from Monk, Bobby from Supernatural, Wormtongue from Lord of the Rings, JF Sebastian from Blade Runner!"" Whomever was in charge of and actually secured all this talent onto one show should be given a raise.

While not a show for kids at all, and completely unrepentant, it will hit every nerve and facet of Old West living. From the huge amounts of swearing, alcohol, drugs, prostitution, murder, robbery... it is all there and in your face non stop. Some I have discussed with found it even TOO much for them to handle and distracted them from enjoying the show. I think you have to put past our modern day thinking and realise the time set we are watching and how they spoke, and you will get much more out of it. They did a lot of fact checking and include many historical figures, places, events, and information that also begs the watcher to invest themselves more into the world and look into them. I grew up in South Dakota not far from Deadwood so it was not new to me, but knowing the material and information only increased my enjoyment of the series as I watched, as I could relate to what was being presented on screen.

The complete series set was purchased for just over $65 during the Gold Box Sale and is worth every penny. The packaging it comes in is simple and elegant, with a nice framing, thick cover box. Inside, the whole series is bound into a facsimile book with a disc in every turn of the pages, each of those featuring a character, picture, and quote. Some are quite humorous. It takes up less space than one season of Game of Thrones, looks sleek, and makes getting the discs in and out a breeze. All in all, if you can get used to the lingo anf lifestyle of Deadwood, you will have a heck of a ride through this series, now saddle up!",1378857600,2,2941,4.5159474671669795
2790465,4,B000O5B4BU,Deadwood was recommended to me - I liked it but in some parts it was just really graphically brutal and some of it could have been left out........guess that is how it was back then but brutality really seemed too much - especially re women.

2790466,4,B000O5B4BU,"Lets just get this out of the way right up front for those who can't tolerate salty language: HEY, THIS SERIES IS FULL OF SALTY LANGUAGE. IF IT BOTHERS YOU, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

Ok, now that I have attempted to warn everyone lets talk about the series...

Casting: It's about as good as it gets really. How good? In my mind, everyone on the cast is now type-cast as ""Bullock, Star... etc..."". They are all great and all chosen wisely.

Story: Pretty sold week-to-week / episode to episode. Overall a lot better than most westerns, but there are some weak parts.

Setting: Again like the casting, about perfect... tough to fault any of it.

Probably one of the best things HBO has been a part of, minus Band Of Brothers which IMO is thee best. If you like westerns, if you like great characters, if your meek, little ears can tolerate a little adult language, this is a must buy at $65 for the BluRay set.",1378166400,2,903,4.383233532934132
2790467,5,B000O5B4BU,"What a great show! Truly. I really became ensconced in this series, such that when it ended, I felt as though I were moving away from home and leaving a bunch of old friends behind. It's that good!

I missed this when it went around the first time, though in the long run, I'm sure I enjoyed it more now than I would have then - especially the Blue-ray on my Plasma TV - it is like being there; except for the smell, which I suspect would have been horrendous in real life. Honestly, this may be one of the best series I have ever seen. It is so fresh and real, except for some of the ""Shakespearean like"" dialogue which goes over the top at times. As many others have noted: the stratospheric level of swearing can be a bit offensive, even to someone like me, who swears a lot. In fact, at times I felt it interfered somewhat with the reality and enjoyment of the show. That aside, I can't say enough good things about this program - the writing, the acting (truly a top-notch cast), the production, the historical context. After every episode I found myself googling all sorts of characters and facts. Indeed, if things grew too intense, I could clear some of the tension by looking up the real history of what happened, for example, I knew Seth Bullock wasn't going to be killed, unless Davis Milch chose to take extreme artistic license.

I was shocked when the show ended, as I mistakenly thought there were still 4 episodes remaining - my mistake. The ending was acceptable, given HBO's truncation of the series, though I was disappointed to see it end. My research reveals no clear cause for the cancellation, though multiple parties appear to be ""at fault"".

As a huge fan of the series ""Justified"", I expected to see Timothy Olyphant playing a version of his Raylan Givens character; however, Seth Bullock - wonderfully played - was extremely high-strung and even a bit crazy at times. It's amazing how Al Swearingen, whom we all hate in the beginning, actually becomes the guy we root for in the end as against George Hearst. It reminded me a bit of the development of Tony Soprano. I believe the sociopathic nature of George Hearst was overplayed a bit, but his history seems somewhat ambiguous - perhaps biographers were afraid to take the Hearst family on. All of the actors were great, and I was extremely pleased to see some of them back in the saddle again after long absences.

In all ways, this is a five star program for me - highly recommended - and I wish there were more!

In Deadwood each and every episode has a story and pulls you in, your not saying ""Man this one is boring I'll skip to the next episode."" Every single one keeps you in.

While I initially bought this series primarily out of respect for Timothy Olyphants' acting skills (Justified), his role is much less prominent than I had expected. Nonetheless, the main character (Al Swearengen, played by Ian McShane) is certainly no disappointment. It should be noted, this is no series for delicate ears, nor for those who are offended by frequent and graphic references to various human bodily functions. This cast of characters is probably the dirtiest and filthiest of any I have ever seen or heard. Literally and figuratively. If this is truly how life was in this time and place, well, I am quite thankful for not having been alive then. On the other hand, that period of history certainly gave rise to some larger than life characters, and this series presents some of those in a very entertaining way, much as Rome did for the historical period it portrayed.

You are either going to enjoy Deadwood or you are not, certainly try and catch a little of it on YouTube or something before buying it if you are uncertain.

I bought it because i like Timothy Olyphant, but he plays (in my mind) quite a weak character and is not really the Lead i thought he would be, in-fact often he is not in episodes.

The level of swearing and cursing is really over the top, making it completely unsuitable for watching in a house with children, even my wife gets a little put off by it, simply because it is constant.",1367366400,,569,4.299065420560748

I didn't watch this show when it came out because I found the language too shocking and I'm not that big a fan of Westerns.  Having recently watched more of TImothy Olyphant's work on Damages and Justified, I thought I'd give Deadwood another try.
After 3 or 4 episodes you get over the language (but it does give you the urge to speak that way in you own life!) I fell in love with the characters, the edge of civilization feel and this snap shot of a brief period in time.  Beautifully filmed and written with the highest of production values.

A great series showing what Id like to think people would do if left to their own devices.  The only gripe I have about this is that the commentary on some of shows didn't tell me the little tid-bits about what was going on behind the scenes as I might like, but you don't have to watch them, they are extras and do nothing to take away from the show they put on for us.

2790544,3,B000O5B4BU,"I didn't watch this series when it aired on HBO, but thought I'd like it based on all the hype surrounding it.  I took a chance and bought it when Amazon made it their deal of the day.  Warning: there are spoilers ahead.

I was surprised to learn early on in the first season that Timothy Olyphant was not the star of the show despite getting top billing in the opening credits.  That honor belonged to Ian McShane, as his character, Al Swearegen, basically ran the town from the Gem Saloon.  He pulled the strings of the town's doctor, newspaperman, sheriff--even the mayor--just to name a few.  He had plenty of minions to carry out his orders, but he wasn't above committing murder himself.  Though the show opened with Olyphant's character, Seth Bullock, moving to Deadwood and setting up a hardware store with his friend, Sol Star, the focus quickly moved to Swearegen and his machinations.  I often wondered if that was always the plan or if the producers took a different course once they saw how limited Olyphant's acting skills were.  Within a few episodes, I began to suspect he was hired more for his looks than his talent so the producers could have at least one handsome actor onboard.  His acting wasn't horrible, just limited and underwhelming.  I had the same thoughts about the actress chosen to play Joanie Stubbs: she was the prettiest female in the cast, but she often appeared emotionless and wooden.

We're introduced to many colorful characters, but I found a lot of them to be incredibly irritating because they were angry almost every time they appeared on screen.  Cy Tolliver (Powers Boothe) comes to mind first.  When he wasn't barking at those around him, he was usually whining like a baby over the fact that Joanie, his favorite whore, left him.  It got old long before the end of Season 1, and unfortunately, it lasted through the series' entire run.  Next, there was Trixie, Al's favorite prostitute.  She yelled at everyone--even friends--like Alma Garrett and Sol.  I frequently wondered what her motivation was for being mad when the person she was screaming at was treating her with respect and kindness, such as when Sol taught her accounting.  George Hearst was another angry soul, who was portrayed as an enormous jerk the whole time he was in town.  And Calamity Jane wasn't just a drunk, she was an angry drunk... constantly.

I know this show was critically acclaimed for its language, but most of the time I found it annoying.  I'm not referring to the abundant swearing; I'm referring to the lack of normal, plain talk.  Watching this series was kind of like reading Shakespeare: you knew the dialog was spoken in English, but when a character finished speaking you sometimes had no idea what was said.  Many of the characters in this show spoke this way, but E.B. Farnum (William Sanders) was easily the worst culprit.  He could never give a simple answer, and his manner of speaking quickly got on my nerves.  I cringed every time he was in a scene.  Charlie Utter had a similar long-winded way of speaking that also tested my patience.

I don't know how closely the show followed the history of real events, but some of the storylines didn't seem to have a point or were hard to believe.  After Joanie left Cy, she established her own brothel.  It quickly crumbled after a serial killer murdered some of her hookers.  From that point on, her character floundered, serving no real purpose except to be the show's token lesbian.  (It was an HBO series, after all, so there had to be a lesbian.) Same with Calamity Jane.  I know she was a resident in the real Deadwood, but in this show she didn't do much except serve as mild comic relief (and the object of Joanie's flirtations).  Then there was the theater troop.  Aside from amateur night at the theater, where the townspeople provided a few laughs by showing off their so-called talents, this storyline bored me to death.  Perhaps the writers were trying to reflect real life by including it, but I think they could have made it more interesting by making it pivotal to the main plot.  Instead, it seemed more like an afterthought that was tacked on.

I don't know how much of a bully the real George Hearst was, but that's how he was portrayed in this series.  When he cut off Swearegen's finger, I expected Al to retaliate in some way but he let it go.  When Hearst had Mr. Ellsworth killed in order to scare Alma into selling her share to him, she sought Swearegen's protection.  Rather than discouraging Alma from giving into Hearst, he let her sell to him.  Then when Trixie shot Hearst, Swearegen killed a whore who looked like her in order to save Trixie and placate Hearst.  Of course the show didn't want to re-write history by having Hearst murdered while he was in Deadwood, but the events the writers scripted led this viewer to expect a showdown between Hearst and Swearegen (or at least a scene where Swearegen finally stood up to Hearst).  Instead, Hearst was allowed to safely leave town, and the tension that had been building all season simply fizzled out.

Aside from the aforementioned lackluster performances, most of the actors did well, and the production values were really high.  The costumes and town itself looked very believable.  The Blu-ray packaging is quite nice: it looks like a hardback book.  One minor quibble about the packaging is that there are no printed episode descriptions.  There are episode titles in the packaging, but I usually find episode descriptions more helpful than titles.  You'll find episode descriptions in the disc menus, but if you've lost track of where you left off you won't know if you've put the wrong disc in your player until after the fact.

Overall, the show was interesting enough to watch all 36 episodes, but that may have had more to do with the fact that I had already paid for all 3 seasons.  Had I bought Season 1 by itself, I probably wouldn't have purchased the remaining two seasons.  I kept hoping the show would grow on me and would have a satisfying conclusion, but unfortunately, HBO canceled it before that happened.  I gave it 3 stars because in Amazon's rating system it means ""it's ok."" I'll be selling or trading in my ""Deadwood"" set.",1358294400,3,6221,4.695290858725762

If you have a problem with obscene language this is not the show for you unless you understand the language is brilliantly written and acted by the cast of characters. Best western show I have ever seen. Praises to Ian McShane and Tim Olyphant. The Special features make this set a must own.

2790578,5,B000O5B4BU,"I don't consider myself to be a  big fan of westerns, but ""Deadwood"" is a show that I've never tired of after several viewings - I can watch the entire series (3 seasons) every year or so - great story, great cast, great acting.

Be forewarned that this is not a ""family"" show, nor is it for the faint of heart - almost every episode is laced with profanity, violence and all manner of illicit activity. It would be easy to write this show off as gratuitous, but at its core, ""Deadwood"" has compelling, extremely well written storylines (at least for the first two seasons).  On the one hand, it's too bad they didn't tone down some of the ""raw"" aspects of this show because it may have garnered a bigger audience (most of the negative reviews you'll see here are for series' abrasive content), but then on the other hand it wouldn't be ""Deadwood"" without it. In the extra features, Milch and company do explain why the show is presented the way it is - also telling is Milch's lament as to why the series was terminated after just three seaons (credit to HBO for including Milch's ""rant"" in the extras).

If you can look past the ""grit,"" the first two seasons of ""Deadwood"" rank amongst the finest shows HBO has ever offered. Less so the third season, but it is still watchable.

Anyway, I'm glad I held out until the complete series came to Blu Ray - it just looks and sounds stellar. All of the bonus features from the various DVD collections have been ported over, and it looks like they are all in hi-def too. Not critical, but a nice perk.  If you keep an eye out, this series can be purchased on Blu for around $60, which is an absolute steal for the entertainment it provides.",1352505600,4,1684,4.398713826366559
2790579,5,B000O5B4BU,"DEADWOOD was the HBO television series viewers loved to hate, and hated to love, mostly because of the graphic scenes between wasting whores and weak men, and the language of them all.  But the secret to its success was the sticktoitiveness of the writing of the series and the dramatic presentation of it by able actors pressed to stick to the actual history, in so much as we can know it, of the early Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, and Indian Uprising period of American history and the story of white incursions into the West.

This viewer, not an HBO subscriber, learned of the series from a friend, and about the time I was considering whether I would sign up for HBO cable service, the series died out.  Yet, soon enough, DEADWOOD; THE COMPLETE SERIES on DVD appeared and the price was right for me; and it is a far better buy now!

I now have seen the series completely -- almost twice through -- and am convinced that it was a superior achievement by the writer/director and the actors involved.  In short, good television, and a great tale well told.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadwood-The-Complete-Series-ASIN-B001FA1OTU-Deadwood-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001FA1OTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadwood: The Complete Series][[ASIN:B001FA1OTU Deadwood: The Complete Series</a>",1351468800,,1328,5.587064676616915

2790583,5,B000O5B4BU,"I'm a french customer who discovered the serie recently and had a enormous crush on it - characters, realism, dialogues, the period (I'am a great passionnate of USA History), the costumes, the complexity of the story.

So, I looked for a DVD Boxet and I found the french version of it (Zone 2). It was very expensive for the poor quality. Just DVDs in plastic ""pages"" and NO ANY BONUS FEATURED, nothing except episodes ; all that for 30$ more than the Zone 1 Boxet. What I liked was the appearence on the top ; the colors were brown-red-black imitation of something like leather. But the inside was too simple for the price.

So, I checked the Zone 1 edition, that I can read with a special player on my PC. It was the exact contrary of the french version. I found the top of the boxet quite ugly, with a white color which does not fit really well with the atmosphere of the show. But, all the rest, the inside, is just great! The ""book"" imitation, the pictures on the pages that we turn (and which contain the DVDs). I particularly appreciated the last pages where we can see a map of the Deadwood camp!

I watched all the episodes in english (with english subtitles, because my english is not good enough to understand everything without reading it - in fact, I can get by with other series but Deadwood is a very complex story with sophisticated dialogues). But, I'm glad to see, though, that the French Version of the show is avaible on this boxet! It's really great for french customers like me who don't like the French Edition, prefer the Zone 1 edition but prefer watching episode in french. There is spanish version too.

I'm very glad, too, to have found many bonus featured. I did not watch everything yet because there is a lot of bonus materials, if we include adio commentaries. It's passionnating! Above all the History docmentaries about the real Deadwood and, as well, the explanations of David Milch about the end of the show, or, rather, the absence of end and a reflexion about the need of an end or not, in a story. Quite interesting, and we can feel true sadness and bitterness in him, frustrated to no have finished his creation. And we totally share his feelings. Bloody producers who just think about money and despide the audience and the artists!

Well, that's all, folks. Very good purchase, don't regret it. The boxet that this great show deserves, far better that the european edition. So, if there are french by here, or spanish : go ahead! Forget the Zone 2 Edition and buy this one, less expensive and more complete and beautiful!",1350086400,2,2563,4.550976138828633
2790584,5,B000O5B4BU,"1876, the Black Hills of Dakota Territory. The discovery of gold has inspired thousands of people to break a treaty with the natives and flock to the area to prospect. The camp of Deadwood has been established to cater for their needs and is rapidly expanding into a large town. In such circumstances there lies opportunity, and the criminally-minded Al Swearengen, wanted for murder in Chicago, has set up his own saloon to cash in on such opportunities.

Swearengen's operations are complicated by the arrival of the noted Wild West figures Calamity Jane, Wild Bill Hickok and Charlie Utter, as well as the establishment of a rival hotel and casino across the road from his own joint and the arrival of a former Montana marshal, Seth Bullock, who is looking to open a hardware store. With native attacks still a threat and a cholera outbreak striking the town, Deadwood needs to negotiate some perilous waters if it is to survive.

Deadwood is widely considered to be one of the jewels in HBO's crown. Running for three seasons from 2004 to 2006, the series has attracted critical acclaim matched by perhaps only two other shows in TV history: The Sopranos and The Wire. Unlike those shows, Deadwood was not able to complete its planned storylines and ended prematurely in 2006 for reasons that are still disputed between the show's creator and the studio.

The first season establishes the basic premise of Deadwood: the depiction of the slow metamorphosis of the settlement from a mining camp to a proper Western town. In the first episode, the town is shown to be lawless and almost anarchic. Over the course of the season the institutions of law, order and governance come into being, with in some cases the corrupt figures of the early episodes becoming 'respectable' figures in the new order. This shift is marked by one particular murder, which has significant ramifications for the town and its future. This gives the first season its thematic structure, the arising of order out of chaos.

The writing is exemplary, with David Milch and his writers (although Milch effectively rewrote every script in the season himself) creating a cadence rooted in both historical accuracy and also in getting across the feel of the period. The high levels of modern swearing, for example, are not particularly accurate but Milch felt this was necessary as the contemporary curse words would not resonate with a modern audience. This also extends to the general accuracy of events. Many of the show's characters are real historical figures, with their activities being a mixture of historically real events, real events that have been condensed or moved around in time for dramatic effect, and totally new scenes that better illuminate the characters and themes of the series. If there is a problem in the writing it's the lack of consistency in the use of some devices: E.B. Farnum's tendency to slip into monologue is rather intermittent, for example. Otherwise it's rich, textured and often amusing.

Performance-wise, the show features excellent turns from the likes of Timothy Olyphant (as Seth Bullock), Keith Carradine (Hickok), Paula Malcomson (Trixie), Doc Cochran (Brad Dourif) and Molly Parker (Alma Garret), but it revolves around Ian McShane in the role of Swearengen. Swearengen sits at the heart of the series, affecting events around him, like a particularly profane spider in his web. McShane, previously best known as the title role in the easy-goin' British detective series Lovejoy, is a revelation in this role, bringing phenomenal presence and menace to the screen. The characterisation of all of the characters is particularly accomplished, with a real focus on making them real, conflicted people. For example, a bald surface reading of the show would cast Olyphant's Seth Bullock as the hero, standing up to the villainous Swearengen, but in fact the two characters are also shown in the opposing role as well, such as when Bullock loses his temper and almost beats someone to death in a disproportionate response to a threat, whilst Swearengen shows mercy - albeit of a rough kind - and kindness to a desperately ill member of the community. This layering extends to all of the characters, making them much more compelling.

Production values are impressive, with huge sets depicting the town and its interiors. It isn't an action-packed series, with considerably more talking than shooting, but when things do go off, they go off in style.

Flaws are almost non-existent. Some events feel somewhat random, but this may be down to the show being as interested in depicting moments showing day-to-day life in Deadwood as it is in ongoing story arcs. In fact, arguably the most successful episode of the first season is the tenth, which shows a typical 'day in the life' of the town aside from all of the other ongoing shenanigans.

The first season of Deadwood (*****) lives up to the show's reputation and billing as a gripping, entertaining and highly compelling drama series showing the realities of life in the West rather than the myth.",1347753600,,5062,5.003562945368171
2790585,1,B000O5B4BU,"I can only give this a one. But let me break it down.

Scenery: awesome
Setting: interesting
Characters: mixed, sometimes cliche
Storyline: entertaining
Acting: very well-cast - the actors and actresses are superb
Nudity: not in every episode, but still over-emphasizing boobs flying all over the place
Scripting: mixed
Hollywood Cliches: the Hollywood message is beat into your head with a sledge-hammer, over and over and over....

Primarily, I take issue with the scripting and cliches.

In SCRIPTING, there are two Hollywood-cliche assumptions the viewer is forced to take:

1) The use of the ""N-word"" as a pejorative. The origin of the now-dreaded ""N-word"" not only meant black slaves, but white slaves as well. We are assumed to make the leap of rationale that the ""N-word"" was always bad and they knew it in the late 1800s - even though it didn't pick up nasty, only-black  connotations until the early 1970s.

2) The usage of profanity of the most irreligious sort being commonplace. I have read many diaries and notes from the time period. Almost none contain the profusion of profanity spewed by almost every single character in the show, with a preference for the use of ""JESUS F-ING CHRIST."" The fact that some of the characters use the newly popular J-F-C several times in a single sentence insults the intelligence of those with an eye to history and thus ruins the show by inserting modern profanity. Also, having only black people use the term ""MOTHER F-ER"" is not just bigoted but skates dangerously along racist lines. We're supposed to swallow all this.

As to CHARACTERS, the Hollywood racist cliches abound:

1) Stupid, fat white men.
2) Wise white prostitutes.
3) the fat black ""mammy.""
4) the noble black man ""victim.""
5) the sick white ""man of power.""

Throw in a strong dose of lesbianism mixed with incest and the Hollywood producer thinks his stew is fit to eat!

Makes me want to vomit.

Other little Hollywood cookie-cutters are in this: the sudden switch from a likable protagonist into dis-likable and vice-verse; the constant hammering that whites get along with blacks if they are ""progressive"" (follow the dialogs between Jane and N-General); the first-season Christian preacher being constantly drowned out by the Newspaper Editor's constant coughing which never occurs around anyone else; the condescending looks given by all of the major cast whenever the christian God is mentioned; the looks of reverence and respect whenever the Jewish faith is mentioned.

Of note, the Hollywood cliche goes overboard with the character Trixie. In the first season, she's a vulnerable unfortunate stuck in a world of prostitution. In the second and third, suddenly she turns into ""Trixie the trailer-park smoking skank."" Well-played, but out of era, her head-wagging, trash talk and smoking could be pulled from any Hollywood film about some sleazy, cheap smoking waitress who uses her smoking as a focus. Head wag, obsessive puff, head thrust up to blow impetuous smoke with attitude...

Of note, I like the character development disparity. For example, Swearengen and EB Farnum both exhibit a poetic prose in their speech. However, the two are completely opposed as to assertiveness. Swearengen is dominant, Farnum submissive. While differently handicapped, Richardson is goofy and comical with his silly antler and Jewel the gimp is oddly compelling and refreshing to see.

The play between Swearengen and Mister Wu are always funny and exciting, but touched with some bigotries that at least are historical.

Is DEADWOOD entertaining? Sure.
Is DEADWOOD representative of reality? Heck no.

As far as Hollywood goes, if you can get past the ridiculous and non-historical JESUS F-ING CHRISTs, and past Trixie's trailer-park part-time waitress role, and past the historical rewrite of racism and the accompanying modern racism in its place, then you should like the series.",1346630400,24,3898,5.163492063492064
2790586,1,B000O5B4BU,"I tried very hard to like and enjoy this series. The story line and plot had a lot of potential; however, the writers were so inept in their writing they had to resort to using vulgar, nasty, and offensive language, which seemed to be every other word.  The language and nudity that was used was too unbelievable and made it difficult to follow the story line. I find it unbelievable that these well known people used that language and in that era. Maybe if it was set today in the intercity of most large cities or prison. It was a disgrace to portray these beloved characters from our past as nasty, vulgar scum.  It was just for shock.  I am disappointed in the wonderful actors who had to lower themselves to this type of film.

2790607,5,B000O5B4BU,"To me Deadwood, Rome and Six Feet Under were the very best of the HBO series. My only regret especially with Deadwood was that in ended. The dialogue and characters were brilliantly created. Each episode was sheer enjoyment. The violence and language was often extreme but that was how people lived and interacted with each other in those days. Ian McShane stole every scene he was in, but once again, all the characters were wonderful. If you haven't seen this series, get it. I can't recommend it any higher than that.",1330128000,2,520,4.725274725274725
2790608,5,B000O5B4BU,"An excellent program that draws you in from the first episode, and leaves you wanting for more after the third season finishes. I am glad I waited to see this show in it's entirety in the wide screen format in 2012, rather than catching some of the programs 6-8 years ago on HBO in analog, as this series was shot for HD.

Deadwood is very different from the TV westerns I watched in the 20th century. Characters that continue from episode to episode don't have tenure as in other westerns, and can be killed quickly. A person who expires in Deadwood may be thrown to ravenous swine, who leave nothing behind. Gunplay, the major score settler in other westerns, takes a back seat in Deadwood to the knife, beatings, burnings, and being thrown off balconies. The western concept of the fair fight rarely occurs here, where accidents and disease up mortality rates. Many have said the character of Al Swerengen is the personification of evil, but in Deadwood, he is well balanced by Sy Tolliver, only the latter murders in a rage, whereas Al seems to enjoy it so much.

Deadwood 1876-77 is clearly not as pleasant a place to live as television's version of Dodge or Virginia City, but like Gunsmoke and Bonanaza, the challenges faced by the fantastic cast of characters is not to be missed, and worth repeated viewings. Some have hoped for a wrap up, which is unlikely a half dozen years after production ended. Most westerns don't conclude, they just keep going in the imagination.",1329264000,2,1480,4.688461538461539

2790615,4,B000O5B4BU,"HBO's Deadwood is one of the best westerns I have ever seen.  It is very revisionist, in the sense that it does not really meet ones expectations of a western.  First, it takes place in the Black Hills in the Dakota territory, not in Arizona, New Mexico or Kansas.  I used to live in Rapid City, not far from the town of Deadwood and I got a tickle out of hearing about places and events that were local to the area.  That said, the revisionist aspect of this story is what is so great about it, because this is probably what the real old west was really like.  Some observations from the show, good and bad.

1.)  The most talked about criticismof the show is the swearing.  I have to agree that there is WAY too much.  Not that I am a prude and that my ears started bleeding or anything, it's just that the swearing is very modern in its using, using terms that did not enter into the common vernacular until the 20th century.  This may seem like a really prudish nitpick, but it is really glaring.  The rest of the show gets everything else right from the sights, attitudes, costumes and locales, that this is very off-putting.  It is almost as odd as seeing Wild Bill Hickock draw an M-16 and shoot somebody.  It takes away from an otherwise great show.  This is the ONLY reason I gave this a 4-star review rather than 5-stars.

2.) Ian McShane's protrayal of Al Swearingen is one of the most morally complex characters in modern story telling.  He starts off as a murdering killer, a runner of prostitues and drugs and unofficial boss of the town.  This is a man that would and does kill anyone at the drop of a hat.  But, like most people in real life, the more you get to understand his point of view and what caused him to act the way he does, you realize he may be the most honest and upright citizen in the whole town, especially as foreign influences start creeping in.  You would never think that such a cruel, evil man could be the bulwark defender of a new city, but he is.  And it doesn't seem contrived, but fits perfectly into his motivations and world view.

3.) The same goes for the rest of the cast.  Everyone has secrets and odd motivators to their actions that don't always turn out the way you think they will.  The show is always unpredictable, and that is what made it great.

4.)  The show ended too abruptly.  I am not exactly sure what possessed HBO to cancel the show since it was one of the top-rated shows on television.  But because of the abrupt cancelation, it ends very abruptly and strangely with the way the story was going.  However, maybe that is the way real life works.  In any case, it was perfectly in tune with the way the show worked.

The show is, like most HBO shows, definitely in hard R territory and should not be watched by people with children or who have delicate sensibilities.  The characters are often hard, cruel and merciless, but that was the world they inhabited and the situations of the times.  One should not kid themselves that the old west was like a John Wayne or Bonanza scenario where fights, while common, are faily bloodless and killing is sterile.  The old west was dirty, violent and brutish.  But it is where a lot of our culture today came evolved from, and to understand where we are, we have to understand where we have been.  While I am not saying this is an accurate historical document, because it is fictional, it is a good lens into the past and what life was really like.",1326240000,3,3454,4.360501567398119

2790618,5,B000O5B4BU,"This is one of my all-time favorite series.  The first time I watched it (on TV) it took me a little while to get past the endless use of foul language.  But, as my hubby explained, this is the way it was back then.  The people were hard, the streets dusty or muddy, and life offered the barest necessities.  The story is violent, sometimes heart rending, exhilarating, and never dull or boring.  Every second of every episode is filled with intrigue, suspense, love, and yes, sometimes gory murders. Anyone who has an interest in what the ""wild west"" was really like back in those days, especially during the years of the ""gold rush"", will NOT be disappointed in Deadwood!  I've already watched it 4 times and am looking forward to watching it again and again.  Wish I was better at giving details and could give you a synopsis of each episode, but I couldn't do justice to this series.  I HIGHLY recommend it!",1325980800,,911,4.54601226993865
2790619,5,B000O5B4BU,"The series cover states ""In an age of plunder and greed, the richest gold strike in American history draws a throng of restless misfits to an outlaw settlement where everything-and everyone-has a price"".  I absolutely love this series!  The colorful and entertaining characters are what make this series one of my favorites and the story is an interesting one as well.  I didn't see Deadwood on HBO when it originally aired but I am a long time fan of Timothy Olyphant so when it came out on DVD, I rented it.  Not only is Olyphant excellent as Seth Bullock, the whole cast is wonderful!  There are several talented actors involved in this series such as- Ian McShane (Al Swearengen), Brad Dourif (Doc Cochran), Leon Rippy (Tom Nuttall), William Sanderson (E.B. Farnum), Jim Beaver (Whitney Ellsworth), Jeffrey Jones (A.W. Merrick), Powers Boothe (Cy Tolliver), Paula Malcomson (Trixie), Robin Weigert (Calamity Jane), Molly Parker (Alma Garret), Keith Carradine (Wild Bill Hickock) and many others.  The writing is superb, it keeps your interest and you find yourself excited to find out what happens next!  I wanted to have the complete series not only so I can watch it any time I want but also so I can have the extras which include some of the real history of Deadwood, why the dialogue is written as it is and what parts of the story are based on actual events.  One of the biggest complaints regarding this series is the language used which is very obscene and used frequently.  David Milch explains in the extras that according to historical research, the foul language used in the series is accurate for the period and area.  I don't find the frequent use of profanity to be distracting, nor do I feel that it takes away from the story.  I find that the dialogue adds to the series and that the manner in which it's worded and delivered adds a mellifluousness to the dialog.  This series is one that people tend to love or hate but I haven't seen anyone have a neutral reaction to it yet. My only complaint about ""Deadwood; The Complete Series"" involves the packaging.  The DVDs are kept in cardboard slots without any protection.  The packaging is attractive and I love it but I wish the DVDs were in a sleeve that you then slide into the cardboard slot.  People will have to buy something separately to protect the DVDs from being scratched by the cardboard.",1325808000,5,2369,4.716019417475728

There is something I would like to address though, the packaging of this box. It looks nice and it's quite small for 19 discs sure, but this comes at a cost. My mother is a huge fan of the show, so we bought her this very set for Christmas (via a local competitor). We are fanatically careful with DVD and bluray discs around my house, If they get scratched I get angry, and I'm not the only one. We've taken the 1st disc out of the case roughly twice, it's already got 2 scratches. Not because of misuse, not because of poor handling, just from sliding it in and out of the box.

I was initially shocked by the language even tho I was forewarned. I got used to the cursing pretty quick. I loved the ""Shakespeare"" dialog and found myself wrapped up in all of the characters. My favorites were Al Swearengen, Seth Bullock and Calamity Jane but E.B. Farnum was the highlight of the series. I found myself hungry for as much information on the characters as I could find. I was burning up Google. The Bonus disc's after each season were very informative and if not for them I wouldn't have had a chance to see the real life actors behind the Deadwood characters. I enjoyed the Q & A interview on the last Bonus disc featuring Timothy Olyphant, Ian McShane, Powers Boothe, Robin Weigert, Molly Parker and Paula Malcomson to name a few. Since I didn't watch the original HBO series I did not know that the series ended abruptly after only three seasons. David Milch, creator and executive producer of Deadwood, was visibly distraught on his interview (last bonus disc) on the conclusion of Deadwood. I don't think he knew at the end of season three that Deadwood would not be coming back for season four. What a loss!!!! Cudo's to David Milch.

Quality of the set - I don't know who designed the box but it is not well suited for storing DVDs.  The DVDs themselves slide into sleeves of cardboard that have no protection on them.

As a person who almost never curses and who gets annoyed at all the unnecessary cursing I hear on T.V., (because kid's hear it too much) somehow the cursing here seemed to fit the characters.  After all, these are mainly extremely hardened people who don't care what society thinks of them.  All they want is to make it in their life full of obstacles and pain, and most don't care how they do it.  A place like Deadwood offers them opportunities to take they probably never could find back East or in any civilized place and get away with what they do, too.  I gave this a five because of the great acting and believable characters.  The stories fit the town, but I almost did give it only four stars because I wanted it to go on telling us more before it ended so abruptly.  I hated the end, but this is not the first HBO series where I loved the show but hated the ending.  I liked Deadwood too much to just give it four stars, though.",1315440000,,984,4.196808510638298

I was hooked and was very upset when it ended after only 3 seasons. Calamity Jane is just an awesome character played incredibly well by Robin Weigart.

2790659,5,B000O5B4BU,"Deadwood is set in the 1870s and is based on the mining town of the same name in South Dakota before the annexation into the Dakota Territory. The real life town saw the likes of Wild Bill Hickok (Keith Carradine), Wyatt Earp (Gale Harold), Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant), Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), Sol Star (John Hawkes), and George Hearst (Gerald McRaney), father of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst whom the movie ""Citizen Kane"" was based on. These and many other historical figures litter the various episodes intermingling fact with fiction.

The town is a microcosm of how civilization develops as various peoples come together. Initially lawless, parameters become established that allow the town to survive and prosper with the various individuals and factions competing for their share of the wealth in this gold mining town. Perhaps what is most interesting are the various dynamics and power shifts that develop, initially between the two main town employers, the Gem and The Bella Union saloons, and then between them and the newcomer, the successful California businessman and prospector, George Hearst, and how these dynamics shift given the various circumstances that unfold. Being a small town these dynamics are very volatile, and felt by each and every one of the town's inhabitants. For a rich and moving characterization of an emerging town and its various people, Deadwood offers a vivid and visceral recreation of the how civilization develops.

This blu-ray set is elegantly packaged, though some may not like the fact that the discs are fit into cardboard sleeves instead of the typical plastic holders.",1306108800,7,1642,5.263358778625954
2790660,5,B000O5B4BU,"I thought this MIGHT be a histoy of a town in the dekota territory. ok, so there wasn't THAT much about it to begin with, so a lot had to be made up. This show has some relistic value to it and that is what the complaints are about, the nudity and swearing. IT HAPPENED THEN TOO, sheeesh, get over it. that is what made the old west, getting ritch and not giving a damn that mommy and daddy aren't around to spank the naughty people.

Anyways

I started watching it because a friend of mine is all aglow about Timothy Olyphant. (actually in started with Justified) and decided he was a not so bad actor. Deadwood follows him and a couple other main charactors as the ""camp"" becomes a town in a territory on the verge of statehood.

There are pieces that reminded me of a western style ROME (also from HBO) and some even from Paint Your Wagon (though not with all that singing)

you get to see modern technology come to a town that really shouldn't have been. Most goldrush towns faded after the gold faded. the fact this town drew so much attention is a wonder

if you are an adult and love the old west style movies, THIS is a good show. if you are squimish about an irish barkeep calling everyone by the things between eachother's legs...stay away",1304640000,2,1249,4.32051282051282

I was left with my jaw hanging open in many episodes...I loved how you never knew what was going to happen.  The language of Deadwood seems a bit tacky at first but once you get into the show it just goes with the time and place in history.  And there really is not very much nudity AT ALL.  This TV series is loosely based on the real story of the town of Deadwood.  The last disc is filled with interesting tidbits on the real town and is not to be missed.

After Season One though Deadwood really loses its step.  You'll still want to watch just because its more Deadwood but Season Two is pretty depressing, the last episode being the only redemption, and even still thats kind of a false mood lifter.  Season Three again just isn't what Season One was.  They have their moments, and I watched them all intently, but things threw me off.

In Seasons Two and Three they actually changed some of the characters behavior almost making them different people which, hate to say it, made me glad they cancelled the show.

Spoilers below:
Al Swearengen becomes a b**ch with a rod up his d**k afraid to retaliate.  Cy becomes a tool.  Johnny becomes oddly sharp.  Not really sure how much I should censor myself there but really, thats what happens.

Life for women in a frontier town was especially harsh, that the female characters were able to maintain any dignity and independence at all is astonishing. Even wealth without an able bodied man at your side was not sufficient protection.

But the quality of the boxset itself is very high with wonderful pictures on each sleeve.  The extras - which I was really interested in - give an insight into David Milch's extroardinary talent for understanding characters and society in general.  He seems to concisely voice the issues of the human condition in a way that is elegant and lyrical even if the reality is violent and gritty.

Deadwood has got to be easliy the best TV series of the past 10 years and concidering that it has gone up agianst shows like Californication, Entourage, House etc that is saying a lot.

Set against the backdrop of the mining town ""Deadwood"". The story pulls no punches and in no way seeks to glorify the west instead paints a rather bleak though acurate picture of what life must have been for settlers in frontier towns. The cast do a great job of getting into their characters minds but none as good as Ian Mcshane who puts in one stelar performance after another.

But it is probably more realistic in the portrayal of sin, violence and sex that surrounded the real Deadwood. I am not a huge fan of westerns, movies or tv shows, but I grew up a few miles from the real Deadwood and this series appealed to me because of it. The stories and situations are definitely geared towards what the view wants, meaning not super realistic, but it is a different view of the west and I enjoyed it because of that. The episodes are all well paced and the series as a whole does well at maintaining interest.

Unfortunately it is coded REGION A and will not work on our New Zealand Pioneer BDP51FD which is Region B. Very disappointed that at no stage during the buying process was there any indication this was the case. Now have to return the product in the vague hope that a Region B (or Multi-region) version can be shipped. Will attempt in first instance however to see whether the BDP can be upgraded to a Multi-region player. Please be warned that this product appears to only be Region A at this time (although there is no given notification or advice this is the case during purchase process).

sure there's some good acting & usually 1 LOL per episode yet the writing went downhill after S1 -- the thing that killed the series for me was the whole Hearst drama -- why not simply shoot the guy when he's on the roof?! -- HELLO -- would've made sense after all the previous killings but then what would they have done for the rest of the epsodes -- plus, in the last episode you have all of these players lined up for a grand battle & what happens...NOTHING?! -- so was a MAJOR disappointment after S1 & esp. once Cody ""left""

it should be noted there is rampant swearing, nudity, & gore so this is not a family friendly series -- I do not lower my rating because of this but it should be mentioned

other irritants...they limited the sheriff to only pouting in anger for most of S2&3 & Tolliver didn't do much in S3 either -- the kowtowing to Hearst was too much for this viewer to bear & the lack of ending was ridiculous -- I would not recommend buying",1293926400,3,1024,4.350785340314136

2790708,3,B000O5B4BU,"I read some of the cautionary tales of other customers about the quality of the dvds of Deadwood series.  One customer recommended inserting all dvds to make sure they played.  I did just that.  Two dvds at first couldn't be read.  I reseated them and they played.  I noticed overall that the dvds are a bit smaller than the player's space for dvds.  So far, I have not had a problem with seating dvds with this particular player.  Now I am sweating that all the dvds will play fully.

I do wish that the warranty was extended just in case there is a problem later on past the 30 days because I know it will take me much longer to view the series.

I do look forward to watching the series which, from customer reviews and other sources, is said to be excellent.

1/8/11

I completed the series a couple of days ago.  I would like to comment on the condition of the dvds.  On disk 4, episode 10 I had problems loading.  I had to load twice before the dvd would be read and played.  On disk 5 I noticed a crack towards the outside rim, but it played okay.  What I did to make sure that the dvds did not get scratched in the cardboard holder was put all the disks in jewel cases for safe keeping.

As for the content of the series, I compliment the set designer.  It really looked like the real Deadwood.  I especially like the bonus parts which covered the historical aspects of Deadwood.  I was in Deadwood in 1998 and the commentaries made me realize that I missed some of the sights.

I have mixed feelings about the dialogue.  Though Milch and McShane said that the coarse language gave a sense of the roughness of Deadwood during that period, I believe that less is better.  I have seen many movies over the years that gave a sense of what a place was without the blue language and this is from someone who is an army veteran.

As for the script, the series started to appear to me as a soap opera.

Milch's comments on the value of being true to the characters (artistic license) seems to fall flat to me.  Milch seemed to compromise the historical aspects of the characters unnecessarily.  Hickok had a high nasal voice as well as dressing like a dandy which may have brought on some challenges.  That Hickok was going blind was only hinted at in one scene.  I liked the acting by McShane of Swearengen.  The character had depth.  Ditto Callie as Utter, Hawkens as Star, Weigert as Jane, and Dourif as Doc Cochran.

How did I like it overall, I was entertained but somewhat frustrated because I study history.  I am not an actor, a writer, a producer, so I cannot claim to be knowledgeable about those skills.

Thank you,

2790711,4,B000O5B4BU,"The time is 1876 and the setting is Deadwood, South Dakota.  The re-imagining of a legendary place that has become mythic makes for raw and entertaining TV.  Now that all 36 episodes have finally become available on a Blu-ray 13 disc collection (36 plus hours!), this is satisfying like a long novel -- even if there are themes, threads and stories left unresolved and many diversions with minor characters.

From the beginning, HBO's publicity has positioned this western around lawlessness and greed.  It's also gritty and profane.  Deadwood is a place of misfits as well as real historical figures like Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane.  It may indeed be a ""hell of a place to seek your fortune where everyone and everything has its price.""  But what makes it interesting and ironic is that no one seems to know the true value of anything.

Fans of the show will appreciate the more than 4 hours of bonus content including: ""The Meaning of Endings,"" ""The Real Deadwood,"" ""Q & A with Cast and Creative Team,"" ""Deadwood 360' Tour"" and more.  Starring Ian McShane and Timothy Olyphant.

2790716,3,B000O5B4BU,"The title, concept, language, and characters were ripped from the pages of Pete Dexter's book of the same name (and everything else). With that in mind, the first 3 shows of the first season were terrific; much better than Walter Hill's awful 1995 movie ""Wild Bill"" that was supposedly based on Dexter's book. After ""screenwriter"" Milch finished with Dexter's ideas, the show degenerated into repetitive character exposes with limited plot and some pretty unbelieveable scenes. The fact that Milch hasn't managed a coherent thought since the first couple of hours of Deadwood says it all. Whatever he did for NYPD Blue, non-withstanding.

Casting Keith Carradine as Hickock was brilliant. Casting Dayton Callie as Charlie Utter was almost dumber than John Hurt in the same part in ""Wild Bill."" Making Hickock's best friend and partner into a frilly Brit is idiotic. The other characters lifted from Dexter's book were all over the place in appropriate-ness, believeablity, and consistency.

As a native cowboy stater and dedicated fan of all things gritty and western, I desperately wanted to love Deadwood, especially after hearing comparisons to Lonesome Dove and other western classics. The reality was that this series is mostly a soap opera for men who particularly like hearing the same three explitives repeated ad nauseum.

2790720,5,B000O5B4BU,"I should probably begin my review of Deadwood by saying that I have never been a fan of the Western as a genera. For some reason, it normally fails to ignite my cinematic senses. For this reason, the series was already long off the air before I garnered an interest but am I ever glad I dispelled my earlier reservations. I am not a big fan of TV shows just in general, but after watching a few episodes over at my GF's parents house, I quickly came to amazon to scoop this series up.

If you are the type of person who cares about the opinions of professional film critics, a quick look around the major sites and you will be able to see that Deadwood received almost unanimous critical acclaim. For me, I either like it or I don't, but this series had me captivated after the first 20 min of the initial episode.

Perhaps there is some sort of primordial urge in me that enjoys the fantasy and vivid storytelling of the old west, but this ensemble cast hammers the plot lines home in striking fashion.

I am not the type of person who enjoys giving out spoilers as I do not want to tarnish anyone else's experience, but I can say that Deadwood has become my most favorite series in history.

I had heard there was originally plans to make 2 additional films to add closure to the various character arcs, but it appears as thought that possibility remains remote.

I highly recommend this to all except to those with small children as the episodes are riddled with profanity and violence, but I would argue rightfully so as to demonstrate the lawlessness and cavalier nature of the inhabitants of Deadwood.

Oddly enough, when I was visiting relatives in South Dakota last Summer, I was able to pay a visit to the actual town of Deadwood. A great deal of the old historic district consists of recreations since much of the town succumbed to fire prior to the beginning of the 20th century, but it was still fun for a history nerd such as myself.

If you are a newbie to the world of Deadwood, you really should give it a try. It certainly surpassed my expectations.",1280016000,,2066,4.435356200527704

That having been said, for Deadwood I couldn't resist.  This series is a classic, one-of-a-kind, and probably the best depiction of Western life I've ever seen.  Not only is this a show I would gladly re-watch, but it's also one I plan on pushing on my friends and making THEM watch.

As far as the packaging is concerned, it's compact which is nice.  It reads like a book with each page a different DVD in the set.  And the extras - particularly the documentary - are practically essential for enhancing your enjoyment of this show.

HBO had a really good run of shows there, with The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and The Wire.  I'd say none of those shows were as fun to watch as Deadwood, though.  The visuals, the diverse types of characters, and the challenging, beautiful, and verbose language all make Deadwood a pleasure to behold.

I have seen every episode multiple times, and I still see things that I missed each time I watch.  Of course, the series is great entertainment on a surface level, but there is so much more available to those who take the time to carefully listen to the dialogue, and to think about the human condition and driving historic dynamic of the time.  For those reasons, ""Deadwood"" is, hands down, the best TV series I have ever seen.  You will likely appreciate ""Deadwood"" if you liked ""The Sopranos,"" ""Hill Street Blues,"" and ""John from Cincinnatti.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadwood-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001FA1OTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadwood: The Complete Series</a>",1265414400,2,972,6.125

The historical accuracy is quite remarkable, after I did research on the real life Wild Bill Hickock, Calamity Jane, and Bullock. Interesting to know is that this box set features photos of the real people and places featured in Deadwood, along with the actors portraying them in the series. Beautifully, beautifully done! As far as the language, yes there is lots of swearing, and some of the dialect may be hard to follow at first- because they did their research and that IS how people talked back in the day. These are rough and tumble people, who were living in the real wild west- what do you expect? There is violence and plunder-remember there was no real laws in West back then. You get to watch the beginnings of Deadwood, and the inevitable power struggles and stories that occurred for these pioneers. Ian McShane's portrayal of Al Swearengen simply cannot be missed!

2790754,3,B000O5B4BU,"This is simply one of the best shows I've ever seen on a screen, that includes movies as well !!! Ian McShane is one of the best actors on the planet. The rest of the cast had to be strong as well, as so he wouldn't steel every scene out right that he was in. As far as I'm concerned HBO bigwigs are super idiots for not extending the series. That's the reason I gave it three stars. That and I did not want my review getting lost in the mix with the other 5 star reviews. I guess it's probably not as lucrative as it could have been if they toned it down some and being set as a western on top of it as well, although the drama far and above out weighs the western feel of it all.
  I'm a huge Sopranos fan, Dexter fan, LOST fan but none of these tremendously great shows can hold a candle to Deadwood. The acting, characters, writing and set is just too strong. It's defiantly a hardcore show with loads of sex, violence, and general vulgarity, but none of which is gratuitous. It all helps to weave the complex story line.

2790758,5,B000O5B4BU,"First, I'd like to say that I don't spend my time writing reviews about anything... unless I feel pretty dad-burned strongly about it. Also- I try to be fair, even if I don't particularly like something. I mean, I can see that there's surely others who wouldn't agree... or may just have different 'tastes', than I.

About ""Deadwood""....  If you have ANY interests in history... or 'the Old West', or 'the Wild West'... like it REALLY was, then you should keep reading. As a kid, all the way up to now (in my 50's), I never particularly liked Westerns. But in the last few years, I've developed a strong liking for the ones that were 'well done'. Like- the only John Wayne film I really kinda liked, was ""The Shootist"". Of course, the newer 'classics' like ""Dances with Wolves"", ""Tombstone"", and even ""Silverado"", I've enjoyed... and I consider worthy of my v-library.

I had heard about ""Deadwood"" running on HBO, some time back... but wasn't an HBO subscriber, and never got a chance to watch it, until- DirecTv's exclusice ""101"" channel began running it... and in HI-DEF, too! (And yes... it WAS filmed in Hi-Def... not just a conversion). So, I was fortunate enough to be able to start with the first episode of season one.

Ya know... at first, I suppose like a lot of people, I found it a little hard to follow the language (as in syntax)... as if, most of the verbiage seemed like it came out of a 'Victorian-era' book. However- there's a reason for that... and it's a good one. That's the way most people actually spoke back then... those who could read... that's what was available. And let's face it... entertainment 'HAS' evolved quite a bit in the last 125 years, or so. Also, in the 'bonus DVDs', there's an entire chapter about the speech... as well as the cussing (which is in great abundance!!!!!!)(I don't see how ""Deadwood"" could ever be edited or overdubbed for television, and still make sense, as well as be longer than three minutes per episode). But- that's a GOOD thing. Remember- we're talking about 'realism'... the way it really was... NOT the way the history books and Hollywood would have us all think.

The next thing you need to know is- 'most' of the characters, were REAL-LIFE people. Seth Bullock, Wild Bill Hickock, Calamity Jane, Charlie Utter, Al Swearengen... these were all real people. Actors, some of whom you'll recognize, and some you may not... but they just can't be any better! Ian McShane; Brad Dourif; Powers Booth; Keith Carradine; W. Earl Brown... and so many others... Damn! They're perfect! And David Milch tries to follow the major (known) historical events, as much as possible. Also... this show was not written in advance, then the script run past countless studio executives, for them to P__ in, 'til they like the flavor... then rewritten several more times... no! David Milch and the writting staff wrote everything, usually the same day they shot it... and they improvise a great deal, often writing additional material because of something one of the actors may have done or said, yet still staying pretty dad-burned close to historical fact.

The set-  wOw! Several blocks built just for this show... and researched incredibly well, so that you see exactly what you would see in old photographs of the period and location. It was a filthy era to live in, with little if any sanitation... and the show reflects that, as well. P**-pots, and everything else, back then, was routinely just thrown out into the street... so, there'd be a near constant mud, made from animal and human waste, trash, you name it... it was probably in there. Even the building materials are authentic... the same type, color, contruction styles (like wooden pegs)... just the way it really was (not some cleaned-up Hollywood executive's idea of how it should have been).

The casting... absolutely top-notch... as is the acting... the effects... the blood, gore, and guts... animals slaughtered...  hell, people slaughtered, and fed to the pigs. You have authenticity in the hotel, brothels and saloons... the alcohol and drug use... and you very quickly find yourself relating to the characters... even, the 'bad guys', you kinda find yourself becoming attached to... and as the story evolves, you may even find yourself beginning to relate to them as well... seeing everyone as humans, with their good, and bad points. As one actor put it ""There are no black or white hats... everyone where's a different shade of gray"".

I quickly found myself not only looking forward to the next episode, but since 'Lost' is likely in it's last season... or at least, spacing nearly a year between seasons has made me loose interest (being tired of waiting, and being at the whim of those in charge)... anyway- ""Deadwood"" is my new 'favorite show'. So much so, that I simply could not wait for my weekly 'Deadwood-fixes'... I bought 'The Complete Series' for myself, for Xmas... so I don't have to wait, and so I can review any parts I wish.

Yep! All three seasons, plus four bonus-feature DVDs are included in the set. One has the creater/producer/director/writer David Milch taking us on a tour of 'Deadwood', and describing the 'conclusion' of the series... as if HBO (in it's infinite wisdom) hadn't cancelled the show (sure wasn't for lack of ratings).... anyway- how Milch sees how the fourth season, had there been one, would have likely gone.

This is one of those few shows/films that you can watch over and over and over... and over again... some mo... and still continue to find new things that you missed before... either in the words/script... or acting/actors' performances... scenery/set... or even the extras. I can't say enough good s**** about 'Deadwood' (Ha! you though I was gonna say S***, when I was really gonna say 'Stuff').

This has got to be the very best Western, ever! 'Authentic' should be in the title, somewhere!!! I suppose the only warning I'd give.... don;t let your kids watch or listen to it... 'cause the veriage 'taint what I'd call 'polite'... albeit very good, funny, and accurate for the time. You may find yourself asking why every-other word seems to be MF, and CS, and everything else in and out of the book... again- this is not your Hollywood version... this is the way it really was (check the bonus DVDs for more info on that.

The characters were well developed and easy to become interested in as the  old West town of Deadwood metamorphisizes over the course of the series. This is definitely an adult show based on the language and situations. Really enjoyed this product!",1257724800,,540,4.625
2790765,5,B000O5B4BU,"This is simply the best television show ever created, as far as I'm concerned. I have watched Season One 7 or 8 times by now, and Seasons Two and Three close to that many times, and I am still in awe, every time. I still feel the same thrill when the theme music kicks in, and I gain new insights every time I watch it.

The dialogue is not easy to follow, but it is well worth the effort. This is a show full of grimness, violence, and oppression, but also some amazing humor, most of it hidden in a tangle of words (EB Farnum's monologues are some of the funniest ever written). As others have pointed out, the profanity is extreme. The first time I watched an episode, I was shocked by it (though not particularly offended -- to me they're only words). Beyond that, it's complex, varied and rich in vocabulary. I've seen reviews on here by people who say that the dialogue in Deadwood shows the ""dumbing down"" of America. It's obvious they only watched the first 15 minutes -- the language is so incredibly elaborate and well constructed that a lot of people compare it to Shakespeare.

The characters are almost as rich and complex as the dialogue. Al Swearengen has got to be one of the greatest anti-heroes ever created and he is played brilliantly by Ian McShane. (In the first episode, watch poor Tim Driscoll talk himself down from a swindler's share of $6000 to a mere $20, withering under Al Swearengen's pitiless gaze.) Swearengen goes to great lengths to supress any hint of compassion in his soul (and usually succeeds), but it leaks out around the edges sometimes, in a way that is occasionally very nearly heart-breaking (his moments with Reverend Smith, for example). On the other side of the coin, Seth Bullock, the former marshall from Montana, is a man who struggles to supress his dark side but cannot entirely manage it. There's the shell-shocked Civil War doctor, Doc Cochran, who is so tragically frustrated by his limited abilities; Al's oily rival Cy Tolliver, whose charming smile hides a nature far crueler than Al's; the peacemaker partner of Seth Bullock, Sol Star, one of the quiet wonders of the show; and of course that mega-celebrity of the Old West, Wild Bill Hickock, portrayed so beautifully by Keith Carradine that it's a pity Milch had to stick to historical fact in his case.

And then there are the women: the whore, Trixie, and her love/hate relationship with Swearengen, her cranky and suspicious nature endangering her chance at a different life; the rich widow, Alma, whose struggle to break free of societal expectations and conventions is hampered by her addiction to laudanum and her cultural indoctrination; the madame Joanie, whose brutal life has somehow not pummeled the compassion completely out of her; and the pitiful drunk Calamity Jane, who wants so much to be a bad-a$$ but just can't quite manage to get herself out of a bottle long enough -- even she, though, can rise unexpectedly to meet a crisis.

On top of all this the sets and the costuming are simply incredible. I've since watched Westerns, even modern ones, that have just made me groan with impatience -- it's so obvious that they're filming inside a sterile set -- and yell at the screen, ""Haven't you watched Deadwood?"" Where's the filth? Do you really think those cowboys and miners took baths more than a few times a year? And don't you know that horses poop all over the place? (And as for the costuming, I would pay a LOT for some hats like the ones that Joanie Stubbs wears. Such a shame that those clothes were so impractical and uncomfortable, because day-yum! they look good!)

This is the true history of the west -- fictionalized of course, but not romanticized and prettified, here explored in all its ruthless grime and blood and pathos and sex, severed Indian heads and random murder, bloody fistfights to the death, unabashed and ugly racism, serial killers, opium addicts and degenerate titlickers, beaten-up whores and children trampled to death by horses -- and amidst all this, moments of transcending beauty, compassion, and kindness. You can practically smell the horses**t, the booze, and the vomit -- and Alma Garret's rosewater.

All my life I have loved ""The Little House on the Prairie"" books (not the TV show, mind you) and I reread them regularly and still love them. This show made me seriously re-examine those books, among many other things. It boggles the mind to think that Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote them in the same place and era that this show occurred, and it makes you wonder what she left out of her books (admittedly they were written for children, so you wouldn't expect her to include everything, but still). This is definitely an NC-17 series, but it is one that every adult should watch who has an interest in the history of how our country was settled and what it was really built on (witness George Hearst in Season Three).

I introduce this series to people every chance I get and an am always happy to make a new fan. It still breaks my heart that HBO killed the series so abruptly. There was so much gold still left to mine. I cancelled my subscription to HBO when I knew it was final and will never subscribe to HBO again (so take that you c***s***ers).

I understand that in early western camps like Deadwood this vile abusive language was commonly used.  I get the point ... and point is well taken.  However after several hours of listening to the endless barrage of 4-letter words it becomes a detraction from the story line, a burden on the ears, and takes on a life of its own.  Adult viewers should be able to maintain a proper perspective about this bad language but I fear younger viewers are apt to adopt a different attitude and perhaps mimic it.

2790779,5,B000O5B4BU,"I have yet to watch the second and third seasons of Deadwood, but thank God I was able to watch the first. This is an extremely well-written show about the real Wild West. There's a chock full of heavy profanity, sex, obscenities, and very little gunplay. This isn't John Wayne's universe, and this CERTAINLY ISN'T Will Smith's universe, either. David Milch has done a fantastic job with this series.

What I like most about ""Deadwood"" are the countless characters that make the show. It's very hard to pick a favorite, really. Ian Mcshane and Timothy Olyphany give superb performances as Al Searengen and Seth Bullock (Swearengen being the cold-blooded owner of a saloon, and Bullock being the owner of a hardware store). William Sanderson is brilliant as E.B. Farnum, a hotel owner with a social problem. Brad Dourif's performance is oscar-worthy as Doc Cochran, a man who has seen it all in the Civil War. Cy Tolliver (played by Powers Boothe) is one character that you'll love to hate. Alma Garrett (Molly Parker) is a bit annoying in the first few episodes, but she develops and you'll grow to admire her because of her complexities. A more complex female character is Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert), whose alcoholism and vulgarity makes a stark contrast for her caring for little children and for those who are sick. Other characters are attention-grabbing: Trixie, Sol Star, Charlie Utter, Eddie Sawyer, Ellesworth, Jewel, Mr. Wu, Reverend Smith, Richardson, Tom Nuttall, A.W. Merrick, Dan Doherty, Joanie Stubbs, Con Stapleton, Jimmy Irons, Leon, Jack McCall, etc. And special props go to Keith Carradine for his portrayal of ""Wild Bill"" Hickok, the legendary lawman who has come not only for prospecting for gold, but for playing Poker (which leads to bad luck in his own case).

2790781,5,B000O5B4BU,"Having read only a few of the glowing critiques of this great series, I can only add my endorsement to what has already been said.
I don't think it is possible to add anything more of substance to the unbounded praise which has already been heaped on this series. You don't even have to be a fan of westerns to appreciate the extraordinary depth of this drama, which in fact has more to do with human relations than the wild west. You hardly get to see a man on horseback, let alone Indians on the warpath. What you do see is a recreation of what apparently constituted the wildcat ""camp"" called ""Deadwood"" c. 1874.
Upon this historical reality has been grafted a magnificent drama, which never lets up until its unfortunate demise at the end of season 3.
""Leave 'em laughing"" has always been a sound principle in the entertainment world, but it is so often ignored nowadays when it comes to TV shows that continue well beyond their sell by date just to earn another buck.  Deadwood is clearly an exception to this widespread abuse, since it leaves you craving for more.
There is no need to go into the endless felicities which this series generates in the mind of the viewer, since this has been well covered in previous comments.
All I can say is, forget the bad language, (which actually adds a certain relevance for today's audiences) and go see it. You certainly won't have seen a western like it - and probably won't again!",1243382400,2,1429,4.538759689922481

2790785,5,B000O5B4BU,"Deadwood is not your typical good guy vs. bad guy show.  It is about the growth of the newly formed Deadwood, a mining town growing up on land reserved for Indians. It is the power struggle of self interests, based on true stories of real people.  It is about love, war, violence, intrigue and everything else thrown in.  If you would like the gritty, profane, and realistic view of the ""Old West"", Deadwood is the series for you.  It is well acted, beautifully filmed, and contains bonus features that give you an intimate look at its creation.

My only caution is that it is NOT for general family viewing.  The nudity, profanity, sex, and violence are raw and nasty, just the way real Old West mining towns were.  It is a series that you will need to watch over and over again to fully understand the dialog, which makes each viewing an almost new expeirence.

The only negative about the series is that it ended after the third season, and there is no real conclusion.  There was a hint of a fourth season to give finality to it, but it never happened.  No movie was ever made to conclude the series.  But three seasons are better than none.",1241308800,2,1145,4.456730769230769

Ian McShane's performance as the generally ruthless Saloon owner is masterly, a totally convincing complexity of repulsive and attractive traits blended seamlessly to create a character which is both monstrous and endearing. The viewer has to be relaxed with the abundance of violence and rawness (including some graphic depictions of sexual depravity) and swearing (almost every second utterance), some of which seems a little more modern than one might associate with the era, but even for those who aren't it is difficult not to be inebriated by this shockingly violent, chaotic, bawdy, misogynistic, and occasionally humorous world. Parts of the dialogue can be missed at times (as its a little muffled and masked by the gruffness of some of the characters) and it is articulated through an odd grammatical mixture of 'olde English'/modern American which nonetheless gives the work an authentic period feel. However mature audiences cannot help but to become immersed in the intrigues and complexities of the overlapping plots and the rich cornucopia of grotesque but multi-layered characterisations Deadwood is an intoxicating, challenging and powerful piece of art.",1239580800,,1321,5.4487804878048784

2790792,5,B000O5B4BU,"David Milch is one of the most brilliant and gifted writers in history. One only needs to see the discussion/interview with Keith Carradine to realize this man's true talent. This is the way it was, folks. This is history and entertainment at its best. However, the script of Deadwood is masterfully written as if William Shakespeare wrote it himself. The inhabitants were not this educated and certainly couldn't embellish English as well as David Milch. The classic Westerns many of us grew up with in the fifties were white-washed milk toast. They were not authentic, but the carnage and the constant barrage of profanity and savage brutality of Deadwood can be a shock to tender eyes, ears and hearts at first, especially those attuned to the eternal spirituality of Judaism or Christianity.  I certainly was jolted.  However, having been in Vietnam and places even worse - and knowing the history of Deadwood - this is the kind of society that emerges when there is no law. Keep in mind that in June, 1876, most of the 10,000 inhabitants of Deadwood were running from U.S. authorities. For the most part, with some exceptions, it was a cramped society of hardened criminals more resembling a Federal prison population void of guards than a lavish Hollywood production set of Wyatt Earp. Deadwood reveals the epitome of both good and evil in mankind. It illuminates the heart of the fallen man and boldly shouts that evil is - and will be - king in a lawless land.",1238803200,13,1468,4.798418972332016

Yes, George Hearst did fix the election and steal the office of Sheriff away from Seth Bullock. Bullock had been a U.S. congressman from Montana before coming to Deadwood, though, and had friends in Washington. When they found out that Hearst had fixed the sheriff's race, they appointed Seth Bullock U.S. Marshall for the Dakota Territory. That gave him authority over all law enforcement in the area, canceling out Hearst's move. Bullock would meet a young Teddy Roosevelt in the Dakotas and they became lifelong friends.

While suspicions arise that 'road agents' may have been the true perpetrators of the killing of an entire family on the Spearfish road, competition arrives for Swearengen in the form of the Bella Union, a new joint from Chicago operated by Cy Tolliver...

Deadwood--a town without any laws or courts--is the center of a gold rush and is presided over by Al Swearengen, a saloon owner, and a brothel operator... His showing makes two different things between the coward and the lapse of momentary fear... Let him doubt those he's trusted, this camp will run red with blood...

The show centers on Seth Bullock, a young man with a powerful temper who got a lot of Hickok's qualities... But being a man with an active conscience Bullock declines to accept the horrors around him...

We are rapidly introduced to most of the other important characters:

Wild Bill Hickok--an asset to any saloon, and any joint he frequents--comes to look for business opportunity and sits there, losing at poker... He is the fastest gun around... While his respect for Bullock grows, he commissions 'Montana' to do a review of the Garret claim...

Cochran--the town doctor who takes heat from Al Swearengen every time one of the whores is poorly sick--was full of opinion and took the most comprehensive view when he treated the bright widow... Now he doesn't feel at such perfect liberty to opine on her husband's case as he did on hers...

E.B. Farnum--Judas Goat looking fellow, coyote-moving type--is Swearengen's water boy, the innkeeper of a thousand faces staring straight at extinction...

Brom Garret--the nave city investor who had to go all his $20,000 to turn Farnum away and purchase a gold claim--pursues his remedies in some other fashion...

Sophia--the little survivor--could settle who killed her people, road agents or Sioux...

Jewel--born with difficulties and hardships that got no cure--wants the doctor to brace her leg so her dragging it doesn't drive Swearengen crazy...

Charlie Utter--who considers himself an important hand at the freight business-- plays a man too loyal and honest for his own good...

Whitney Ellsworth--who saw something he shouldn't have, a man pushed off from a ridge--seemed very competent and trustworthy...

Mr. Wu--the only source of opium in the camp--finds a common language with Searengen when an opium theft occurs...

Smith--the Reverend who has a distinct, clear set of morals--knows from past experience that it's a solace having friends...

Ian McShane is a joy to watch... He gives a first-class performance as Al Swearengen, the oppressive boss who can order the execution of any man in the settlement with just a word... McShane who runs his Gem with the help of his cronies, emits power in every order he gives...

While McShane is a marvelous villain who generates a palpable menace, Boothe is maniacally evil as Cy exuding despicable charm ... Well dressed Cy is the gentleman on the outside while more cruel as Swearengen in beating, kicking, and killing...

Such a performer was found with Timothy Olyphant, very effective as a formal marshal who understands the danger of his own temperament... Seth Bullock stood before Alma Garret as a married man to his brother's widow after he was killed... He took their five-year-old boy as his own son...

The 4 show women that are trapped in a man's world are: Molly Parker as Mrs. Garret, the beautiful addict wife who suspects foul play... She inevitably feels she's had some part in what befalls her husband; Kim Dickens as Joanie Stubbs, the very attractive solitary woman who uses to make Cy warm; Paula Malcomson as Trixie, the prostitute who must've done some fancy to keep Al from Killing her... She tries to help Alma with the orphaned child while keeping her master in the dark; Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, the sewer mouth that follows Hickok around... When she confronts the greasy-haired dangerous man who pulls all the strings, she fell apart, broken and weak...

There's something powerful and moving about 'Deadwood'... It's truly a drama of memorable characters, dark and ultra-violent... If you love Westerns, don't miss it!",1233360000,5,4372,5.013812154696133

It had a compelling storyline based on actual events, fascinating true-to-life characters, gritty, realistic production values and the most X-rated dialogue ever heard on the tube.

When the show was suddenly cancelled after the 3rd season without giving the story or characters a proper conclusion, viewers were not just upset.  They were angry.

Now, HBO Video is trying to make partial amends by releasing DEADWOOD, THE COMPLETE SERIES, a 19-disc box set that not only contains all 36 episodes of the series, but also a Bonus Disc that has series creator David Milch strolling through the DEADWOOD set and talking about how he would have ended the series had there been a 4th season.

Like the rest of the series, most of that final season would have been based on actual historical events and would have included a huge fire that destroyed the town.

Also on the extra disc is a documentary about the real Deadwood after the fire, plus a hilarious audition reel featuring series regular Titus Welliver.

2790819,5,B000O5B4BU,"I won't go into an details of the series as most people have most likely already seen it or at least know what its about. Ill simply say that its hands down the greatest western ever created and that is saying something as there are some amazing westerns out there. While some get close, Deadwood easily takes the prize. I think this is honestly the most realistic series I have ever seen. Now its obvious that I didn't live during those times so my idea of realistic may in fact not be realistic however Deadwood portrays that time exactly how I imagine it would be, thus for me, it reaches a level of realism that is a cut above all of the other shows out there.

I have now watched this series 4 times from start to finish and it hasn't even started to get old. I always borrowed my sisters copies when I wanted to watch it as I refused to pay 80+ dollars for 12 episode seasons. HBO pricing has always been something I have had strong feelings against and I just refused to cave in regardless of how much I liked the series. Imagine my surprise when I logged onto Amazon a few days back and came across the complete series on sale for 64.99. Thats less than 25 bucks a season and I am happy to say that I ordered it without hesitation. Good things come to those who wait and this set is without a single doubt a good thing. This is the price it should have been all along and its nice to see HBO finally getting some sense in regards to thier pricing as I have noticed a lot of other HBO sets coming down in price as well.

As much as I love this series I simply have to mention its one weakness and that is the way the series ended. HBO really screwed the pooch ending this series the way they did, then again HBO has done this many times now (Deadwood, Rome, & Carnivale). What really upset me is how they came out and told everyone how they were going to produce a couple 2 hour movies to end the series properly and never ended up making those films. IMO they never had any intention of making those films and the only reason they came out and said that they were going to make them was to calm everyone down. People were so pissed that HBO cancelled the show that thier was a massive amount of cancellations taking place. There were even websites put up trying to convince people to drop HBO unless they made the 4th season that they originally intended to make. So they announced a couple movies to calm everyone down and to stop the mass defection. I was actually one of the people that dropped HBO and I still haven't picked them back up. I just don't have any faith that they will follow through with thier series.

Regardless of Deadwood's weak ending, its still hands down the best Western ever created and if you haven't seen it yet, this box set and its new low price is a perfect reason for you to finally jump on board. You will never look at westerns the same way again. In a way I am jealous of those who have yet to see it. There is just nothing like seeing it for the first time. My set is on its way and ill soon be watching it for my 5th time.

2790833,4,B000O5B4BU,"""Deadwood: The Complete Series""  is a 19-disc box set containing all 36 episodes from the four-season run of the cable drama set in 1876, just two weeks after the defeat of Custer at Little Big Horn.  The Black Hills town of Deadwood is populated by illegal settlers, outlaws, prostitutes, gamblers, Chinese laborers, former soldiers, and the occasional family trying to survive.  The show is notable for its excessive portrayal of violence and dialogue laced with colorful vulgarity, but it features some remarkable acting as well.  Ian McShane as saloon owner Al Swearengen, Timothy Olyphant as former law enforcer Seth Bullock, and Keith Carradine as Wild Bill Hickok are standouts.  Using the dramatic device of combining fictional characters with actual historical figures (Calamity Jane, Hickok) successfully and setting the stories in a specific time period makes the series far more intriguing than earlier TV westerns like ""Bonanza"" and ""Gunsmoke,"" which seemed to exist exclusively on studio sets.  Bonus extras include featurettes on the real Deadwood, a Q & A with the show's cast and creative team, a tour of the show's detailed sets, and an ""Al Swearengen Audition Reel.""",1229817600,15,1185,5.276595744680851

2790836,5,B000O5B4BU,"Of all the TV series I have watched beginning to end, Deadwood is the one I keep coming back to.  Even though I've seen every episode countless times, I still pick up something new with each viewing.  It still makes me laugh.  It still makes me think.  It still gives me chills, and it still makes me cry.  It is a brilliant man, executive producer and head writer David Milch, at the peak of his powers as a storyteller.  Watching Deadwood is like reading a 1200 page novel from 150 years ago.  Broad themes in a small setting, complex and conflicted characters, and detailed scenery make for a completely immersive experience.

The plot of the series revolves around where order and community come from.  Deadwood was settled outside of U.S. territory in the 1870's after a gold rush, thus leaving it in complete anarchy.  Each of the three seasons is well-structured in terms of conflict.  The first season deals with how the inhabitants of the town arrange themselves in this lawless town.  The second season has the varying factions band together to thwart an invasive government.  The third season pits the town against the hyper-capitalism of mining magnate George Hearst.  Within that structure is several smaller stories that both manage to stand alone and meld with the larger themes.

The real strength of Deadwood is the characters.  Milch has created perfectly fleshed-out portrayals of historical figures and some made-up ones, too.  Saloon owner Al Swearengen is a ruthless operator who cannot help but long for an easier, more peaceful way.  Seth Bullock demands justice from those around him, but constantly surrenders to his temper and his libido.  Calamity Jane is a many layered character, tough and kind, offensive and caring, vulnerable and impenetrable all at the same time.  These are only a sampling of the many deep and conflicted characters in the show.  By the third season, there were nearly 30 cast regulars, all of which were people you genuinely cared about.

The only thing that could keep people away from Deadwood is the language.  Milch is a lover of dialogue, and he writes in complicated verse.  More than one viewing is required to even catch the most basic plots and motivations.  What can be equally off-putting is the vulgarity.  Those with sensitve ears can expect to be bombarded with f-bombs on a semi-sentence basis.  If you're having a hard time getting through the first couple episodes, check out the extras on the first season.  Milch explains why he wrote the way he did in a way that made perfect sense to me, both from a creative and an historical sense.  In those extras, he will divulge a lot of spoilers, but it's far better to experience the series than be turned off by its profanity.

The Complete DVD set, in addition to the many commentaries and extras included in the original single season releases, contains new material that makes the upgrade worth it.  Milch explains where he would've taken Deadwood had he been allowed to continue it in the most valuable addition.  A lengthy roundtable discussion with the actors is very entertaining.  Also included is actor Titus Welliver giving a handful of convincing impressions of actors auditioning for the part of Swearengen.  The size of this set also equals one single season release, so if your shelf space is limited, the complete series set gets another plus.

In closing, Deadwood affected me more than any TV show I've ever watched.  I jumped out of my chair to cheer on Dan while he fought Hearst's man Captain Turner in a brutal fight to the death.  I quote Calamity Jane's beautiful description of a revealing dream.  I cried when Jewel asks Doc to ""give her a whirl.""  I could feel the joy in the town after Tom Nuttal's big ride.  For anyone who wants the most out of their TV shows, Deadwood is truly perfect.",1228867200,475,3832,4.799694189602446
2790837,2,B000O5B4BU,"I have to admit I was absolutely in love with the show for the first season.  It had all of the dynamics that made it intriguing: an intelligent yet manner challenged villain with a voice you enjoy listening to, heroes that were challenged themselves yet you believe in, beautiful women, rugged scenery, history, consistent conflict, you name it.  The problem is in the middle of season 2 and beyond where it tried to be more than it was.  Somewhere all of the characters developed a PHD in Liberal Arts.  Why?  Sure, there were plenty of cowboys and tavern owners who spoke the King's English.  Yeah, right.  The obscenities which added character now become confusing mixed with old English.  The writing style alienated the listeners from the characters as significantly as it did in John From Cincinnati (a much more seriously flawed show).  Stop hiding behind the structure of the dialect and allow your audience in.  I would encourage anyone to watch the first season and yes, yes you will develop an expectation and anticipation for the next episode; until the writers change and the show goes to another planet. Unfortunately HBO is hiring writers that are more interested in structure rather than production and content.  It is not that I do not understand the dialect and composition.  I have a graduate degree and appreciate writing styles that mesh with the content of the setting and character development.  It works for Jane Austin, not Al Swearengen.  The story line is there.  It is just crippled in its production.
Comparing Deadwood to OZ and The Sopranos where you hear all of the ""foul"" language, Deadwood does what its title implies.  It does have an interesting storyline but falls short in delivery after season 1.  It fails to allow the escapism the Wire, OZ and Sopranos delivers.  Just like John From Cincinnati, Deadwood had the potential to be a blockbuster but instead becomes driftwood on the beach.  Deadwood is a reminder of something truly awesome in its infancy only to become more incoherent and out of place in its seniority.  4 stars for season 1. 2 stars for the rest.",1228694400,25,2105,4.8431372549019605

The writing and acting in this show is absolutely the best you will ever see in a Western series.

If you are offended by hearing repeated use of the word 'fu*k' and its variations, then you might as well skip this show completely, but those that appreciate actors at the top of their craft and expert writing skills will be literally spellbound by this HBO-produced Western series.

great, had almost as many lowlights as highlights, but Deadwood has near perfection in every single chapter.  A superb cast of mostly unknown or quality bit players, with two or three notable exceptions, make this exciting period of  American frontier history burst to life in vivid, colorful (to say the least) action and language.  Times were hard, tough, and your friends were good friends and your enemies were deadly.
Some parts are better than others, depending on personal taste and interest, but in my personal opinion, there is not one single episode that hasn't got a touch of superior acting, great humor, or gut-wrenching action attached to it, most have an abundance of all three.
  For some of these actors, this series may be the crowning achievement of their professional lives.  There are far worse fates !!!

2790845,5,B000O5B4BU,"I have yet to watch the second and third seasons of Deadwood, but thank God I was able to watch the first. This is an extremely well-written show about the real Wild West. There's a chock full of heavy profanity, sex, obscenities, and very little gunplay. This isn't John Wayne's universe, and this CERTAINLY ISN'T Will Smith's universe, either. David Milch has done a fantastic job with this series.

What I like most about ""Deadwood"" are the countless characters that make the show. It's very hard to pick a favorite, really. Ian Mcshane and Timothy Olyphany give superb performances as Al Searengen and Seth Bullock (Swearengen being the cold-blooded owner of a saloon, and Bullock being the owner of a hardware store). William Sanderson is brilliant as E.B. Farnum, a hotel owner with a social problem. Brad Dourif's performance is oscar-worthy as Doc Cochran, a man who has seen it all in the Civil War. Cy Tolliver (played by Powers Boothe) is one character that you'll love to hate. Alma Garrett (Molly Parker) is a bit annoying in the first few episodes, but she develops and you'll grow to admire her because of her complexities. A more complex female character is Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert), whose alcoholism and vulgarity makes a stark contrast for her caring for little children and for those who are sick. Other characters are attention-grabbing: Trixie, Sol Star, Charlie Utter, Eddie Sawyer, Ellesworth, Jewel, Mr. Wu, Reverend Smith, Richardson, Tom Nuttall, A.W. Merrick, Dan Doherty, Joanie Stubbs, Con Stapleton, Jimmy Irons, Leon, Jack McCall, etc. And special props go to Keith Carradine for his portrayal of ""Wild Bill"" Hickok, the legendary lawman who has come not only for prospecting for gold, but for playing Poker (which leads to bad luck in his own case).

So now, all I need is enough money to purchase the next two seasons of ""Deadwood"". And it's a shame that this show got cancelled, but the reason behind it was understandable: not enough money from the ratings.

This series is so good and so well-written.  The dialogue between the players, while often coarse and not for the faint of heart, is brilliantly put together and makes the viewer think.  There are so many good quotes throughout this series that I had to start recording them in a journal.

The characters are wonderfully acted, most notably the town's ringleader, Al Swearengen, played by Ian McShane.  As horrible as this man is, I dare you to try to not love this guy.  Many an episode ends with one of his venting diatribes, that bring together the complexity of his character, all at once villainous yet heroic, menacing yet humanistic.

Everyone else brings the story together wonderfully, and shows us a glimpse into the rough lives our pioneering ancestors led in paving the way for us to live so comfortably.

2790852,5,B000O5B4BU,"First, ""Deadwood"" has the most constantly profane and racist language, and graphic sex and violence I have ever seen on mainstream film. So, those who are offended by material of this nature should not watch. But if you can get past that, ""Deadwood"" is brilliant.

  Let me begin by giving an example of the writing. In the following scene, Al Swearengen, Deadwood's  ruthless leader, deplores the fact that the self righteous Sheriff, Bullock, is too involved in his adulterous affair with Alma (who controls a rich gold mine) to focus on the political struggles the community is facing in its attempt to be annexed into the United States. Swearengen watches Bullock leave the hotel after being with Alma. One of Swearengen's men remarks that Bullock means no disrespect. Swearengen replies:

  ""Horror is, you are f**kin' right. He don't know if he's breathin' or takin' it through f**kin' gills. He is that f**king c**t-struck. They're afloat. In some fairy f**kin' bubble, lighter than air, him, her snatch, and his stupid f**kin' badge...Self-deceiving c**k-sucker I am, I thought, when America took us in, Bullock would prove a f**kin' resource. Look at him, stridin' out like some randy, maniac Bishop.""

  ""Deadwood"" is a true western because it is the story of the creation of a community on the frontier. The town of Deadwood was born when gold was discovered in the Black Hills, lands ceded to the Sioux by treaty. All kinds of non-Native Americans, Europeans, and Chinese invaded the area. This action was illegal under the laws of the United States and, of course, considered grounds for war by the Sioux. So, the people who founded Deadwood, of every class, were all true outlaws. And Deadwood had no law but custom and the knife and gun. In three seasons, ""Deadwood"" tells the story of how the town was founded and ultimately annexed to Dakota Territory.

  Many of the characters portrayed are based on historical personages. Formost  among them is Al Swearengen the ""Bloody King of Deadwood,"" who operated the town's first saloon and bordello. Swearengen is played by Ian McShane. It is the role of McShane's career and he is astounding. As the episodes progress, Swearengen's charachter  evolves to amazing complexity, far beyond the simple villain he at first appears. We come to root with guilty pleasure for Swearengen, the murderer and whoremonger, and to admire his cunning as he allies with Bullock and others who attempt to hold their own against even worse and more powerful and morally corrupt forces; Cy Tolliver, the despicable overlord of a competing gambling house, Wolcott, mining engineer, serial killer of prostitutes and agent of the ruthless, implacable mining magnate, George Hearst, and against corrupt and idiotic politicians from Yankton who would deprive Deadwood's founders of political rights of self determination.

  The thing I enjoyed most about ""Deadwood"" is the fact that it is brilliantly and blatantly Shakespearian. Scenes of high drama are artfully alternated with comic vignettes. A number of characters actually engage in soliloquies with strange yet understandable sentence structure. It is surprising and pleasing to see how well such scenes work in a western. For example, Swearengen keeps the head of a dead Indian in a box. When he is beset by fools, his lackeys, Swearengen, like Hamlet to Yoric, confides his feelings, questions and stratagems to ""The Chief."" In one such scene, Swearengen complains to The Chief about one of his men. Swearengen says:

  ""Dead, and without a body, you still outstrip him for intelligence.""

  There are a few pure and good souls represented in this savage work. Calamity Jane, played by Robin Weigert is a true Shakespearian ""wise fool."" In one of my favorite scenes (it made me laugh and cry) Calamity visits the grave of the murdered Wild Bill Hickock, who she adored. It is her custom each night to tell Wild Bill the news of Deadwood. On this night, she is joined by Charlie Udder, Wild Bill's other closest friend. She allows Charlie to tell Wild Bill the news. But he breaks down. He asks Calamity:

  ""Can I...can I tell `im some more tomorra?""
  Calamity replies with kindness:
  ""Sure. What the f**k you askin' me for? I don't make the rules.""

  The scene is at once melancholy, hilarious, and profound. And there are many such scenes in this brilliant masterpiece.

The combination of the last desparate gasps of the 'wild' west with it's coarseness and sense of potential with the victorianesque sensibilities of the newbies coming from the east is fascinating and funny.  These are characters whose flaws you can connect with and motivations, even the bad ones, that are completely human and reachable.  Add that there are a mix of real people, composites of real people and people there should have been and it's a deep look into the probable reality of the time.
The featurettes add a lot to the background knowledge and increase the depth.
The one part I don't care for much (and therefore don't watch) is the voice overs by the actors.  It really doesn't seem to add much.

It is ambitious in scope, with dialogue that could have come from Hamlet, had every line in Hamlet been peppered with one or more variations on the coarsest of obscenities.

Producer David Milch has accomplished something extraordinary for any mediium. ""Deadwood"" is populated with outrageous, over-the-top characters who are nevertheless believable and who continue to evolve throughout the narrative. The storyline builds with the power of Epic drama, a Medieval morality tale played out by pimps, prostitutes, Comstock Tycoons, saloon keepers, and hardware merchants.

Milch also has a wonderful instinct for revealing the complexity of his players. Sometimes a cocked eye, a single word, or fleeting physical gesture can hint at previously unsuspected dimensions in a character, whether central or peripheral to the story.

With a Wild West setting in the Dakota Badlands of the 1870s, every step taken by the characters in this series holds the possibility that they will sink into mud up to their ankles, as they try to pick their way through the maze of hastily cobbled together buildings, relationships, and moral dilemmas that make up ""Deadwood.""",1205539200,12,1326,5.186915887850467

2790859,5,B000O5B4BU,"Rented seasons 1 & 2 a while back. To be able to watch both again, including the third season, with the background info at our own pace made us appreciate every aspect of this brillant HBO series even more.
I highly recommend getting all three seasons - you'll understand all the characters better and won't be able to stop watching Deadwood until you complete the series! Please, HBO, finsih this story !!!",1200182400,3,407,4.666666666666667
2790860,4,B000O5B4BU,"As someone who works in Deadwood, SD and lives in Lead, SD (3 miles from Deadwood) and is a lifelong South Dakotan this is a very well acted, very well scripted, long overdue series that tells the beginning story of Deadwood.  A word though, this series is about 50% real events and 50% fiction and certain events that took place over long periods of time are dramatized and shortened.  But, hey, it's not meant to be a documentary.  And the historical aspects of this series were extremely well researched with the help of Deadwood's Historical Adams House And Museum's Mary Kopco among other Deadwood local historians.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  And, yes, the language and some of the events may be highly offensive but Deadwood wasn't for the weak at heart in those days and that is how they spoke and what they did.  The reason I didn't give this set Five stars is due to the price tag and the ending.  And there will be no movie to wrap up the series, unfortunately.",1198972800,4,981,4.5397727272727275
2790861,5,B000O5B4BU,"The only downside to this series is the lame ending of season 3.  I don't think we're ever going to get the movie(s) promised to really wrap up the series.  The acting and casting in this is the best I've ever seen. To change Ian McShane from charming and adorable ""Lovejoy"" into the scheming hardass Al Swearingen (could there BE a better name for this guy?) is a testament to his ability as an actor. The entire cast is simply phenomenal, and this show depicts the Old West a lot more realistically than Gunsmoke ever did... An excellent, excellent series, and one that is sorely missed.",1197936000,7,589,4.547169811320755

If you have concerns about certain words, particularly those that refer to actions of reproduction, or the body parts involved, this movie probably isn't for you.

8182938,5,B000O5B4BU,"There's this little camp in Dakota Territory filled with miners, lawmen, rustlers, whores, drunks, businessmen, ruffians and a few China men. Custer was just massacred. Wild Bill Hickock & Calamity Jane are in town. Mud & muck, cramped quarters, as the little mining camp is slowly turning into a town. It's a place called Deadwood.
You follow these characters - a very quirky bunch - through seemingly mundane conversations and other interactions - the likes of which I have not had the pleasure of hearing since Lonesome Dove - and very slowly, almost without the viewer being aware, the jumbled becomes a beautifully woven story right before your eyes.
A bit [yeah, just a wee bit ;-) ] of foul language, but as each episode wrapped up innocuously and the screen turns to simple white on black credits, accompanied by a different period tune each time, I was left with a wry & satisfied smile on my face every time.
What a differently unique show it is. One Season down, two to go!

Add-On: Just watched the extras on the Blu-Ray edition of Season 1 and got to ""meet"" the creator/lead writer of the show, David Milch, in a couple of extensive interviews by Keith Carradine [Wild Bill]. What a cerebral guy. He has a broad knowledge of history and the creative genius to allow us to imagine the reality. It is no wonder how & why this show became so exceptional. I had this little gem sitting on my shelf - unwatched -for a couple of years now ... had no idea! So many epic characters ... hard to pick a favorite, but Calamity Jane [Robin Weigert] is right there at the top. I would highly recommend any ""fan"" of the Old West to take some time to enjoy this show!",1511308800,,1665,4.513245033112582
