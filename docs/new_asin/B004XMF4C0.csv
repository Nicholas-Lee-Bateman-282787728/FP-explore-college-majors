8447167,4,B004XMF4C0,"This is the one Fitstix workout that I kept because I thought it was a lot of fun. It is a workout comprised of different combinations based on 10 different combinations with different themes like boot camp, salsa, kickboxing, and separate hip-hop and pilates segments. In each segment, she builds the combination and then you repeat it several times. Then, you move on to the next segment.

 The menu lets you play the entire workout with ""refreshers"", more teaching time, or without the ""refreshers"". And there are some premixes that you can choose. I thought that the entire workout with refreshers was kind of tedious because it seems looooonnnnnnnngggggggg. But, I really enjoy the version without the refreshers. Something about using the Fitstix is just fun and there are some really fun combinations. My favorite is the drumming themed combination.",1424476800,2,856,5.107142857142857
8447168,3,B004XMF4C0,"Let me start by telling you that I am very picky about my workouts. I have 20 workout videos at any given time, and I rotate them based on my mood, energy level, etc. I get up just after 5 a.m. to workout. Like everyone I am busy. So the videos I keep have to be fun and effective. It also helps if I like the music. (I am a Zumba instructor, and I have taught Zumba toning. They have similar toning sticks, but the music is better.)

Pros: instructor's energy level, effectiveness of workout
Cons: Production quality, fun factor, elevator music style

I know I'm picky, and the average consumer might really like this tape. It just didn't make the cut for me.",1377820800,2,660,4.314516129032258
