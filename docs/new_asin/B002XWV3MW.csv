4699069,3,B002XWV3MW,"""Bunny and the Bull"" is a road movie set entirely in an apartment.  Shy and reclusive Stephen ""The Bull"" Turnbull (Edward Hogg) hasn't been outside in months and refuses to interact with the world.  When a sudden infestation of mice forces him to change his ways and leave his comfortable nest, his mind hurtles back to the disastrous trek around Europe he undertook with his friend Bunny (Simon Farnaby).

Bunny, a womanizing, gambling-addicted guy who drinks too much, had dragged Stephen on the trip in order to get him to meet some women but wound up sleeping with all the women himself.  Stephen can't shake the flood of memories, and his apartment becomes the springboard for an amazing odyssey through the vivid landscapes made up of snapshots and souvenirs, from the industrial wastelands of Poland to the bullrings of Spain.

A tale of love and disillusionment, ""Bunny and the Bull"" is a quirky film which manages to involve the viewer in Stephen's offbeat, inventive journey.  Bonus extras include interviews and a behind-the-scenes featurette.",1303948800,,1054,5.063583815028902
4699070,5,B002XWV3MW,"You cannot possibly begin to grasp this film by simply reading a review, though I will try- this film, while being criminally unavailable in the states, is one of the best films of its type.

But what type is that exactly? It isn't a comedy, although it is hilarious. It isn't a drama, though it is tragic in parts. It isn't for children, although it uses an almost children's adventure archetype. It is all and none of these things.
First off, it appears that all of this was shot on a soundstage. Backgrounds are often animated, miniatures, or a combination thereof. Its as if Pee Wee Herman were taking acid with the Brothers Quay and invited The Mighty Boosh to the party.
There are actually Americans who do not know of the Mighty Boosh. The comedy duo of Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt (both of whom appear in this film) is, while not essential viewing for understanding the story, very much a part of the world that this film inhabits, even to the point of having several of the same actors apart from those mentioned. The same surreal, quirky, goofy innocence is all over this film. It can almost be compared to ""Alice in Wonderland""....but for adults.
Really, words fail me. Instantly arresting and completely captivating it has become essential in my library. It is the sort of film you will want to put on like the radio. It is genuinely sad, genuinely romantic, genuinely hilarious, and genuinely bizarre. Do whatever you can to see this- at least once.",1288656000,5,1467,4.664092664092664

I'm a big fan of British humor and would love to watch this at home on my DVD player.
Unfortunately, I'm in the U.S. and can't view PAL format recordings.

Sure hope to see this on a DVD that plays on USA format.

The worlds getting smaller everyday, why can't we just get a universal format DVD ?
I thought the digital age would have fixed all this.

Would it me worth it for me to buy a PAL DVD player ? would it even work with my TV ?",1281225600,2,731,5.37719298245614
8472691,5,B002XWV3MW,This movie is so cool! I love it when movies have some interesting mixed media moments and this one really does. Excellent story line reminds me of a Wes Anderson flick but the story would double-feature well with something like Wrist Cutters: A Love Story or Six String Samurai. This one is one for the collection.,1493683200,,315,4.642857142857143

8472693,5,B002XWV3MW,"This is one of my favorite films. It's SO creative, unique, funny & tender. There are moments that literally  made me laugh till I cried! I don't want to give ANYthing away about this little masterpiece, except to say you will be delighted, and the ending makes the sometimes wacky story pieces fall perfectly into place in the most satisfying way. Ahhhhh.",1485648000,,356,4.741935483870968

8472696,2,B002XWV3MW,"The only reason I gave a low review is when I received the DVD the case was pulverized to the point where I actually had to replace it with another one. Other than that disc worked great! Amazing movie for anyone looking for a unique story! And if you like this check out ""wristcutters: a love story"".",1429315200,,301,4.298245614035087

8472698,5,B002XWV3MW,"Unique!  A great look!  Very stylized and stylish.  Very quirky and offbeat.
If you know the guys behind it, you are more prepared for what to expect (but its something really new).
Its a zany character piece.  A surreal setting.  Beautifully envisioned and executed.  Its a really good movie.",1369785600,,293,4.877551020408164
8472699,4,B002XWV3MW,"This a pretty funny and quirky little film. There are a couple of other films that incorporate the use of collages and sculptural props to give the story a dream like, fantasy quality, but I just can't remember them right away.",1360454400,,227,4.560975609756097
