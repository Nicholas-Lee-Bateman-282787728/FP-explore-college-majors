6662675,5,B00NJ4VMDS,"This is one of the most engaging series that was ever on network TV.  I rank it up there with West Wing, Downton Abbey and Blue Bloods.  The ensemble of actors and their resulting characters are so real it is scary.  Some of the best acting you will ever see from every player.  If you cannot identify with at least one of the characters, if not more, you are not human.  We could not stop watching to see how each story would unfold.  Lots of surprises and twists to the overall family dynamic that addresses every major issue facing American families in the modern world.  Bravo!",1493769600,,581,4.4245283018867925

But on the menu for each disk it says ""great-tvshows.com"" at the bottom, which does not look like a legitimate website.

6662769,2,B00NJ4VMDS,"Intriguing and quirky characters face tough situations, but this series disappoints. Dropped threads abound. [Spoiler alert.] Just a few examples: the patriarch has money trouble because of a bad investment. What happens? We don't know. Plotline dropped. The patriarch makes money by doing commercials. What happens? We don't know. Plotline dropped. The patriarch buys a mobile home so he and his wife can travel and she can paint, something she's dreamed of doing. What happens? We don't know. Plotline dropped. I can't care about characters whose lives don't feel real. The makers of this series listened so closely to viewer feedback that they lost artistic integrity: it looks like it was designed by a committee. Is a coherent storyline too much to ask for in a television series? Not anymore. The Wire showed us what is possible. The bar has been set higher.",1463011200,3,864,5.048951048951049

6662775,5,B00NJ4VMDS,"About a year ago, I watched the first 5 seasons of Parenthood on Amazon Prime Watch for free, then had to pay for several episodes of season 6, to complete the series.  Although my husband calls this ""the yelling show"" because of the family dynamics, I found it excellent in portraying the complexity of relationships and resolutions. Each character was revealed to be human, with sometimes rational behaviors and sometimes emotional. Some of the challenges became tedious to watch, but no different than watching a family member make poor choices and learn from them. I wanted to be able to enjoy it whenever I felt liked, so I bought the series a couple of months ago. I have not begun to re-watch the series yet, but am looking forward to it. The price was so much better to buy the series than to pay per episode. How could I resist?  I do recommend at least testing the DVDs upon opening, for defects, if you aren't planning on viewing them within 30 days.",1457308800,,961,4.5813953488372094

6662846,5,B00NJ4VMDS,"An incredible show, my personal all-time favorite. The cast is amazing, the writing is superb and everything about it is just wonderful! Parenthood should not have ended, but the way it did was just beautiful - extremely satisfying and bittersweet. Jason Katims and the writing team really do the stories justice. Its portrayals of family life and all the struggles people go through together are done with such truth and honesty that it would be impossible to watch it and not find something or someone to relate to; you will see yourself, or your family, in these characters.

The topics Parenthood has touched on are incredibly diverse and extensive - e.g. financial struggles, adoption, job loss, pregnancy, cancer, Asperger's syndrome, abortion, starting a business - but it is never preachy or 'this is what you should do' when it is dealing with these issues, it just shows you how these people deal with it and lets you have your own opinion.

The great thing about the Bravermans is that none of them are close to perfect, they have their issues and flaws - they can be pretty frustrating sometimes but life and people are like that - it doesn't hide their faults, it works with them. The cast of this show is perfect - Craig .T. Nelson, Bonnie Bedelia, Lauren Graham, Peter Krause, Monica Potter, Sam Jaeger, Mae Whitman, Erika Christensen, plus all the others, do a fantastic job  the warmth and joy they have really comes through on-screen, the relationships between their characters seem so natural and comfortable - you definitely end up feeling a lot of love for these characters!

Parenthood has never gotten the proper recognition it deserves, it was definitely a hidden treasure of the NBC lineup, but the people who did watch it, loved it and were extremely loyal to the show. Hopefully its final season will gain some much deserved awards, but even if not, the fans and TV critics won't love it any less.

I have never loved a show this much and already miss it; I can't believe it's over. Long live Team Braverman!!!",1424217600,25,2037,4.775568181818182

I tried to watch it because of the good reviews but They make me suspect that they are fake reviews. Why is listening to an hour of constant whining and obsessive behavior even remotely entertaining? Craig Nelson is only realistic character but better to watch reruns of Coach and have yourselves a good laugh.",1423699200,3,630,4.833333333333333
6662849,5,B00NJ4VMDS,"Absolutely the best show to ever be presented on TV.  The writers were incredible as were the actors, and the direction was the most effective job of direction ever.  This show was reality at all levels and it was, in fact, a love story.  What TV calls ""reality shows"" doesn't even begin to capture true reality, and it is obvious that was never their intent, but Parenthood sets the standard for reality in the way they handled the struggles and victories of life.  We didn't start watching it until 3 years ago, and I can't wait to get the full set so we can see what came before.

I hated to hear that this was going to be the last season when they announced it, and I wrote the network  asking if there was any way it could be continued (I didn't hear back).  At any rate, I firmly believe this show could be used  to show how to resolve conflicts, the value of loyalty, the results of commitment and determination, the importance of honesty and, yes, the value of love.
