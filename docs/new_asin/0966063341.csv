172522,4,0966063341,"I have this film it's really good

Deborah Gibson really stand's out

in this film also staring her Boyfriend

at the time Chris Bruno. The movie would

have been better if Deborah was the bride

But she sure is the best part of the film

so this is a true Fan item if you do not

have it get it fast!!!!!! And Check out

her other film on DVD

(My X-Girlfriends Wedding Reception) was

going to be called (Wedding Band)old title.",1107993600,,430,4.197530864197531
172523,3,0966063341,"Right from the beginning credits with the cute animation & Deborah Gibson singing the title tune, I felt like this was a comedy Doris Day (another pop singer who acted in films) would have starred in. It was like one of Miss Day's 60's screwball comedies with a gay 90's twist. A fun, fluffy film.",985651200,,297,4.418181818181818
172524,4,0966063341,"I recommend this film to all romantic comedy fanatics. It's a charming date movie in the likes of My Bestfriends Wedding. Great performances and memorable characters make this movie an enjoyable ride! Headed by Sean Runnette, Chris Bruno and Pop Superstar Deborah Gibson lights up the screen in this whacky, tons of fun comedy. Deborah really does SHINE on her film debut, it's a must for FANS!",981158400,,394,4.895522388059701
172525,4,0966063341,"This is a sweet, very charming and funny bit of fluff that's great for when you want to just watch something entertaining and not too serious.  Think along the lines of ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" with a smaller budget and less well known stars, but that same kind of script.  Lots of witty lines and slapstick humor.  Speaking of the actors, the  entire cast is appealing.  You've just got to love the poor straight guy,  who is SO nice to all these lunatics who keep taking advantage of him.  I  will say, while this movie is fun, by no means is it worth the money.  Rent it  from Blockbuster instead.",963532800,,602,4.390909090909091
172526,4,0966063341,"Having favored screwball comedies from the 30s and 40s in my teens, I found the same environment in this movie. I laughed quite often and enjoyed the craziness of the circumstances the characters found themselves in very  much!",951609600,,227,4.973684210526316

172537,1,0966063341,"So bad on so many levels. A lot of reviews complain about the acting, but the fact that these people could keep a straight face while speaking this completely dreadful script is probably the best thing about the movie.",1451001600,,218,4.615384615384615
172538,4,0966063341,"It's a silly movie, but totally enjoyable to watch. It could also be titled My Boyfriend's Girlfriend!

172541,4,0966063341,It is now a dated movie. I do like it though. It is a perfect representation of a gay film from the 90s.,1433721600,,104,3.5652173913043477
172542,3,0966063341,An okay movie.  More like a Disney movie.  But Deborah Gibson and Valerie Perrine are the standouts.,1433721600,,100,4.823529411764706

172545,3,0966063341,"I've watched it twice - second time by accident.  It is a cute movie - better than a couple on Prime - but not as good as some of the better made gay themed films.  There is some good ""eye candy"" but the plot is kind of hard to believe as is some of the acting.  Debbie Gibson is so nice and so naive I can't believe it is for real.  As for her mother - cougar on the hunt!  Should you watch it?  If you do not have great expectations.",1426032000,,435,3.7252747252747254
172546,5,0966063341,It was a funny movie  and fun to watch  had a great plot  acting could been a little better but over all it was a enjoy to watch,1424390400,,128,3.5
172547,3,0966063341,"Well... it's cute... it is trying real hard to be a screwball comedy and sometimes the effort is too obvious- but that said and acknowledging that the budget was apparently limited, It is sort of likable for what it is. If your expectations are not too high it can be a fun bit of escapism.",1422835200,,290,4.290909090909091
172548,3,0966063341,"Just ok, glad was free with prime.  Look for it in the sale bin for .99.  Re-hash of similar movies, a bit too silly but a good have a cold/flu day movie.",1421280000,,154,3.78125

172554,3,0966063341,"I found it hard to get into this movie, though I did enjoy it.

For me to really give a movie five stars it has to reach out and grab my attention. If I'm writing an e-mail while watching the movie, it has to force me to look up more than it doesn't.

The premise was fun, but bouncing back and forth between the two boyfriends made me lose track of parts of the story. Who was that boy waving through the window, anyway?

In five years, I might try watching this again. Maybe I'll like it better then, in which case, I'll edit my review at that time.",1408665600,,551,4.036697247706422
172555,2,0966063341,"I persevered! The movie is inane. I know it was made in 2006 and this is 2014, but it's just so silly. Is it supposed to be a comedy!?",1406937600,,134,3.6551724137931036

172557,5,0966063341,"I laughed myself silly.  Great comedy, with predictable parts, and touching moments.  This may be ""gay themed"" in the strict sense, but the emphasis is on the personalities of the characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1400025600,,225,5.194444444444445

172559,1,0966063341,I love this movie. It is great. I want more like it. It is almost perfection. Great for family fun.,1388966400,,99,4.0
172560,2,0966063341,"I really only watched it because it was available for free on Prime.

Mediocre at best.  The premise had some promise, but the movie didn't meet my already-low expectations based on the reviews here.  It has a sitcom quality to it.  The physical comedy is overdone.",1387497600,,265,4.695652173913044
172561,1,0966063341,"This is one of the stupidest movies put on film. Badly acted, photographed, and written. And the cast should try another profession.",1386720000,,132,5.045454545454546
172562,3,0966063341,"This is an older (1980's?) corn-ball movie. The tall straight (acting) actor really over-did the pratt fall schick!! A corn-ball gay ""comedy"". Was the 1980s the decade of ""cheesy"" movies? Okay. Not fare. Cheesy movies come out every month of every decade. If that was Debbie Gibson, the singer, wow. What balls to play a lead in a gay topic movie back then...I have a whole new admiration for her (that I never had before). I hope that's not what made her career go south. Makes me want to check-out Debbie (or Deborah Gibson) music. Please note that I don't even know if its the same person. She did , in the movie , have a nice voice.",1386460800,,636,4.398305084745763

The maid of honor and her fiancee arrive.  The groom and his best man are there.  And in comes a bumbling photographer who specializes in photographing children.  Through a series of hilarious events that include the photographer catching the groom as best man kissing, and the fiancee catching the photographer hanging off the roof, the story unfolds and we learn the groom is marrying for the money and the social status, the fiancee is actually falling for the photographer, and the entire groom/best man gay thing explodes out of the closet.",1386374400,,705,4.982905982905983

172565,2,0966063341,"It was average.  It was another low budget, gay movie that had potential but did not deliver.  And the actress who played the girlfriend played the bitch very well.",1378771200,,164,4.620689655172414
172566,3,0966063341,"Acting was so so, the humor worked.  Did not really capture me well, I went to sleep half way through the movie.  So backed up and watched the rest.  Can't say that I gained much by having the movie.  Oh well.",1378339200,,209,4.024390243902439
172567,4,0966063341,"A bit formulaic, but still funny the first time through. Good looking cast helps carry the movie through the few awkward bits in the script.",1375833600,,140,4.64
172568,3,0966063341,"The movie was funny and though not impossible, it was more entertaining than it was believable.  It was pretty predictable early on but all in all entertaining.",1373328000,,160,4.925925925925926
172569,3,0966063341,"This was a fun little film.  All of it is right on the surface, no deep messages.  The humor is anything but subtle, and some of the jokes/following each other through doors just go on too long.  Take out 15 minutes and it would be significantly better.  Mixed quality of acting, good visuals and sound.  Low expectations will lead to increased enjoyment.",1370476800,,355,4.661290322580645
172570,5,0966063341,"It wasn't done on the biggest of budgets, and wasn't the end-all of movies. But it definitely had heart, and the acting rang true. It also had really funny moments, and left me with a goofy grin when it was over.",1367712000,4,212,4.195121951219512
172571,3,0966063341,"This movie was fairly entertaining, with a very young and pretty talented Deborah Gibson. Good storyline, pretty good acting. Obviously low budget, but its more of an indie film.",1366243200,3,178,5.172413793103448

172573,2,0966063341,"The best,and only good thing about this film is Valerie Perinne as a couger. The rest of it, forget it.  The script writers didn't even bring the writing level up to LAME. That bad.  Then the actors, except Valerie Perinne of coarse, well they could not act their way out of a wet paper bag if their life depended on it.",1359072000,,320,4.229508196721311
172574,3,0966063341,"It's about this really tall guy (supposedly 6'4"") who is dragged to his girlfriend's bestfriend's weddding to a closeted tv star. A photographer (played by Debbie Gibson) shows up and inadvertently gets some very compromising photos and hijinks ensue. I don't know - I kind of liked it in the end. The characters for the most part weren't entirely one trick ponies. The groom's boyfriend somehow ends up with the most depth. For a stupid movie I liked how they treated the sexuality. Almost looks like it was filmed on a somewhat high end home video camera - probably as a made for TV movie. Quality is rather made for TV.",1356566400,10,622,4.612612612612613
172575,1,0966063341,"I'm not sure if my one star rating should go to myself or this movie ""first"" but it's certain both are deserving.  This is probably the worst ""gay movie"" I've ever seen: Bad plot, bad acting, bad dialogue, BAD price considering the aforementioned, and bad choice on Valerie Perrine's (Lex Luthor's hottie girlfriend from Christopher Reeve's ""Superman"") part for accepting this role!  I'll take the single star for being lame enough to fall for the ""sounds good, looks good in the picture!"" thing.

This should have been a campy, and even acceptably cheesy movie -- tho worth it! -- instead, the film delivers nothing but the gruelling task of almost finishing it.

There were endless scenes of one idiot chasing another around every single imaginable house corner and tree, bush etc... honestly I've never seen such a stupid movie.  And for me, a person who even managed to enjoy, ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" to not find at least SOME entertainment value is rare.... not to mention the fact I'm writing this review (motivated by my self-disgust at having purchased an expensive piece of crap rather than knowing better! - thus the one star that goes to me!)

If you want a bad movie, watch ""Troll 2"".  If you want a stupid movie, watch ""Dude, Where's My Car"".... if you want to ponder whether or not the next minute is worth living, watch this.",1297900800,4,1340,4.725321888412017
172576,4,0966063341,"A recommended movie for fans of pop icon, Deborah Gibson. An indie film that was first released on VHS is now on DVD. A better representation from it's first format since it's now on Dolby Digital; in terms of picture and sound quality. Take note of the title track sang by Deborah as well. All in all, it's a light, fun movie about relationships. The actors did a great job; Although, because of it's gay-themed undertones; it's suitable for mature audiences only. Great DVD quality but no added features.",1192320000,,506,4.696629213483146
7793836,1,0966063341,"This is not really a gay movie at all. The slapstick gags became tedious, as plot contrivances. I liked the actor who played Wes somewhat, but even he was dragged into the slapstick routines.
