8064955,4,B0009PVZX2,"A set of a Latin telenovela serves as a container for the absudity of the lives and dramas of the actors.  It has a film-school satire visual feel that is refreshing and there several precious lines and hilarious situations.  Tatiana Astengo plays a cute as a button naive maid and steals the show in my opinion.

8064956,2,B0009PVZX2,"Initially, I bought this movie because the plot looks interesting: A bored woman finds some excitement in her life by becoming the leading lady of a ""soap opera"", filmed next door. But, at the end, the movie goes slow and annoying. And, you get lost at the end, and ask yourself: What???",1265414400,,287,4.538461538461538
8064957,4,B0009PVZX2,"you have to understand the Latin soap opera culture and not being part
of the typical soap opera viewers to be able to fully enjoy this movie.
Alvaro's sarcasm and sense of humor makes this film to be the first of
its class in Peru. A soap opera being filmed in a family house, the
maids (already involved in the show) get involved as part of the
cast, and eventually the home owner will get involved with the filming
and with the director as well. Very good acting and direction, i'm sure
the next one will be as fun as the first of Alvaro's work...",1123545600,5,550,4.247619047619048
8064958,5,B0009PVZX2,"Unlike many foreign films this movie actually has a story, with a beginning, middle and end. Despite the cover this is a film the whole family can view comfortably. Does not rely on special effects, sex, or chase sceens. It's fun witty dialogue gives us hope that maybe people still know how to write. I love this movie!",1122940800,5,320,4.5344827586206895
