316191,1,6301170113,"This performance is hideous!  I wanted a dvd for my daughter who was getting confused between the ""real"" nutcracker story we had seen at the ballet, and the ""Barbie"" version.  Any version that has Clara dancing as the Sugar Plum Fairy as well is counterfeit!  Barbie scores a point!  The sets are dull - where is the land of sweets?  We have to look at the tree the whole time!  The costumes are dull, tattered, and often aren't remotely resembling the various delicacies (coffee, tea etc.)which leads to confusion.  The Mouse King seems to survive too long, and finally decends down a trap door with the Nutcracker, who awkwardly returns with his sword.  Bottom Line:  this is the worst version I could have gotton.  Go elsewhere for a more accurate story, less bizarre production.  And finally, the worst of it is the stuffed, yes stuffed, nutcracker about 3 feet tall, instead of a real wood one. If they want it to show up on stage, couldn't they think of a better idea?  It is ridiculous to the point of being comical!  Beware all Bolshoi versions as I gather from the other cover they are still dancing with the same stuffed nutcracker - possible handed down through the years for posterity?",1136073600,10,1197,4.642857142857143

The orchestra is very good and also shown on the recording. The conductor comes on the stage at the end to accept congratulations. Most of the scenes are masterpieces. Compared to other Nutcracker versions, all dancers here are superb, not only the main characters. Every detail is worked out in the best possible way.

The storyline, the performing dancers, and the elegance still transfers to the human heart through this DVD format. Although, the cameras can't really capture the true energy and radiance of a live performance, the price of the DVD is a better value then today's theater prices. Especially if you just need something to unwind after a hard days work. Cozy up, dream through viewing into dreaming of REM download. God Bless!

The music is exquisite, however the recording is not as sharp and clear as we have become accustomed to in our time.  The stage and set design is superb with the wire acts and the lights and costumes.  The marriage near the end is a great addition, and the characters at times appearing out of the floor is neat addition.

316195,1,6301170113,"This very traditional version of the Nutcracker is stiffer than the tutus in it!  It has some redemption as a document of the vast size of the stage in the Bolshoi Theatre; but lacks imagination in sets, choreography, and costumes.  One wonders how many decades the costumes have been reused, and what a more current production might be like. It was a chore to get through it.",1051920000,5,376,4.597014925373134
316196,5,6301170113,"I've always thought Russian ballet superior to American ballet. That's just my feeling, but it means I'll always prefer a Bolshoi performance to the New York, or the ABT.
If your tastes are different, though, you can get that awful saccharide thing by Peter Martins with Darci Kistler; just remember your insulin.
There's also an ABT version with Russian-no-more, Baryshnikov, Mr. Codpiece himself, and the ever-enebriated Gelsey Kirkland.
I'd stick with The Russians. I concur with the previous reviewer that the dancing is equivocal in the two versions offered by Amazon; me, I like to hear the whole score.
So if you like The Nutcracker, and want to watch it over and over, you need this tape. There is enough detail to absorb in slight tilts of heads, curves of arches, roundings of elbows, to keep you busy for a long time.
As to the question of whether Nadia Pavlova is related to Anna Pavlova: doubtful...Pavlova is a fairly common name in Russia; about on par with, say, Richardson, in the US...",1032739200,12,1003,4.837209302325581

316556,4,6301170113,"This 2012 performance conducted by Valery Gergiev, general director and artistic director of the Mariinsky Theatre, presents that ballet company's traditional Russian version of The Nutcracker, as does the one conducted by Viktor Fedotov from 1994. The Blu-ray marks a visual improvement over the older video, and on the whole -- with reservations -- the remake is a satisfying version to recommend.

Considering only a single sheet listing the tracks is provided with the disc instead of a booklet, ""that ballet company's traditional Russian version"" needs a bit of explaining. A brief note on-screen at the beginning credits the choreography to Vasily Vainonen, who added Drosselmeyer's puppet show at the Christmas Eve party. Vainonen's staging, in turn, rests on substantial changes to the original 1892 Nutcracker libretto that were made in 1919 by Alexander Gorsky (the same choreographer who inserted the jester into Swan Lake). Gorsky took it on himself to turn Act II's fantasy scenes into a dream from which Masha (the Russian equivalent of Marie) awakens at the end. In the original ballet, she remains in the Land of Sweets instead of returning home. Gorsky also eliminated the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier and assigned their dances to Masha and the Nutcracker Prince.

This, then, is what has become the Mariinsky's standard version of The Nutcracker.

The 2012 Blu-ray transfer is of much higher video quality than the 1994 Kirov DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-The-Nutcracker-Kirov-Ballet/dp/B000051VS3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky - The Nutcracker / Kirov Ballet</a>, and the audio is bright and clear. With more emphasis than Fedotov, Gergiev draws forth the unsettling, surprisingly 20th century sounds from the orchestra after Drosselmeyer has entered the Stahlbaum's house. Significantly, the camera focuses on Gergiev at this point, instead of on a stage where no action is taking place.

In Act I, Alexandra Korshunova steals the show as the young Masha. It might have been better to keep her throughout the show because Alina Somova doesn't fare so well in Act II in comparison to Larissa Lezhnina in the Kirov's Nutcracker, although this might not be entirely Somova's fault.

At two key spots, the Gergiev/Mariisnky video falls just short of the older Fedotov/Kirov Nutcracker. In the Waltz of the Flowers, the lighting in the newer production is too bright, and the glare destroys the soft, gentle hues that so appropriately glow in the 1994 staging. In addition, Gergiev's slightly quicker tempo gives a less graceful lilt than Fedotov's. The major failing of the Mariinsky's remake comes in the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. Somova seems as awkward as a newborn calf where Lezhnina is elegant, which could be a result of Gergiev's faint slowing of the pace. For whatever reason, and because this dance is many fans' favorite segment, Somova's tottering Sugar Plum Fairy must be counted as a disappointment.

The other big flaw in this 2012 production is the journey to the Land of Sweets. The Kirov's older video suffered here from less-than-adequate computer effects to depict the transition from Masha's house into a fantasy world. What we get here instead is no journey at all. The curtain remains down while Gergiev conducts the music that supposedly accompanies the trip to open Act II, and then voil -- the curtain rises to show Masha and her Prince in the new locale. But because there's no visualization of a journey, there's no sense of arrival, and the effect falls flat.

Aside from these drawbacks, the video is terrific. I don't understand other reviewers' obsession with showing feet in every single frame. Yes, feet are important in ballet, of course. But dancers dance with their whole bodies, not just with their feet. One of the advantages of ballet on video is being able to see closeups of the dancers that you wouldn't be able to see in the theater. If the only element of a ballet production you want to see is feet, I would suggest you have a narrow range of vision that misses quite a bit of value.

Somova mostly performs well, as does Vladimir Shklyarov as the Prince. The Mariinsky's corps de ballet maintains its standard of excellence throughout, and with the exceptions noted, the Mariinsky's 2012 Nutcracker is a better Blu-ray than the old, tired production from the Royal Ballet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tchaikovsky-The-Nutcracker-The-Nutcracker-Royal-Ballet-2009-Blu-ray/dp/B00F6ZCRFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker (The Nutcracker: Royal Ballet 2009) [Blu-ray</a>] recorded in 2009.

316562,3,6301170113,"Got this from the local public library for a preview before buying yet another Nut video. Eh, so-so. The Bolshoi's looking a bit careworn in the tattered decadence of Soviet Russia (see the creepy Hammer and Sickle gold-embroidered into the stage curtain).

For those used to more nuanced interpretations, the capering of Victor Levashov's Drosselmeyer seems hammy and spastic. Compare Sir Anthony Dowell's sublime Dross in the Royal Ballet's 2001 release. The entrance and exit of the partygoers are just bizarre. The ""boys"" in March and Polka are obviously played by very female women--maybe all the real boys were in boot camp for action in Afganistan. Some of those Snow dancers with the silly pom-pom wands wear grimaces of agony en pointe--or maybe they'd been told to hold that expression; either way, fun killer.

And then there's the Mouse King That Would Not Die, reappearing a few times in Act II--huh? Then Mouse and Prince sink into a smoking hole in the stage like the Melting Wicked Witch of the West? The bobble-headed male in Chinese Tea moves like an amateur tumbler with ballroom experience, not like a ballet-trained dancer. See Little Bo Beep and her wheelie sheep hunt for the Missing Mirlitons! And Dross, dude, I can see those shiny fly-wires! The list goes on and on in this weird Nut.

That said, the Divertissements are generally well done, and rather fun, as they are meant to be, despite the Grigorovich/Ivanov tendency to lapse into choreographic mass-unison, turn-taking, static live-backdrop framing, and mirror-symmetry. Pity the Land of Sweets is missing or just unrecognizable in this staging--no escape from 1970's Socialist Workers' Paradise I guess, not even in dance theater.

For those actually familiar with prolific genius E.T.A. Hoffmann's Nuknacker und Mauseknig story and the more-popular Alexandre Dumas' retelling thereof, it's understood to be primarily about Drosselmeyer and Maria/Marie/Clara. The Maximova-Vasiliev team deserved to be admired for their power and grace, I suppose, but this Nutcracker performance should not be taken as fundamentally about them (despite the 1:54 applause they milk from the audience post grand pas de deux), either as dancers or as the characters they play.

The dancing is utter perfection and the doll mimicking is brought to a level of `grand theatre.' But then again this is the Bolshoi Ballet.  The `Waltz of the Flowers' takes on a different tack than usual, featuring both male and female dancers.

The moving 'skycam' camera work - constantly roving above and around dancers - and the odd edits to show too much of Maestro Gergiev's (unkempt) face or isolated feet and hands warrant the lifetime firing of whoever directed this film. Even worse: the miscasting of the brittle and sweaty-faced Alina Somova as Sugarplum. No wonder that the capable Vladimir Schklyarov seemed to be going through the motions when partnering Somova! The 1990s Philips-label filming of this version of Nutcracker, starring the gorgeous and classically-pure Larisa Lezhnina, is 10-times more satisfying, despite the older filming technology 20+ years ago.

However, I must say the overall production isn't that entertaining as one would expect from a ballet like 'The Nutcracker' where the intended audience is expected to be children, compare to various other productions from other ballet companies in the world.  Perhaps with the Marinsky version the aim is to show-off the ballerina (the role which Somova plays) which is very challenging for the ballerina, and not so much as a production aiming for children.

I am used to American ballets where the sets are gorgeous, the dancing is breath taking and the show is awesome. I felt very disappointed but I guess that is how an impoverished country was. anyway, I did not care for this cd at all.",1355356800,,349,4.384615384615385
316630,5,6301170113,"The word ""traditional"" may put some people off, by on this production of The Nutcracker, it's a welcoming sign, when Tchaikovsky is in the hands of the corps of the Mariinsky Theatre, with Valery Gergiev conducting.  All the parts you know and love are here, with sweeping camera work particularly on the scenes at the Stahlbaums party, the battle, the Waltz of the Snowflakes, and the final waltz.  As far as any close-ups are concerned, I welcomed them to see the facial expressions on the dancers.  The crowd favorite, besides Masha and the Prince, seemed to be the young trio perfoming the Pas de trois in the Divertissement section.  Looks like they could have a good future in ballet.  Maestro Gergiev and the orchestra are wonderful, and the sound was excellent.  It's a production to treasure.",1355184000,8,801,4.852941176470588

Some of the scenes could have been framed better bit it is a film of a live performance. It was nice to see an older choreography if the Nutcracker as well.

316682,2,6301170113,"Viewed this production of The Nutcracker as a Fathom Event at the local movie theater. I was very excited to watch the production until the camera work started getting weird.

Why would a director shoot a dancer from the waist up? Why would he do close ups on people not even dancing? It started with the dolls at the Christmas Eve celebration and just got worse. My absolutely favorite variation is The Snowflakes, but it was an out of focus mess. The two featured dancers may have been really nice dancers.  Who knows? All I saw were blurry corps de ballet running too close to the camera.

316685,3,6301170113,"The dancing is nothing short of incredible and from that perspective it is probably one of the best production ons dvd. Maximova is angelic, Vasilev is superb and Levashov is my favorite Drusselmeyer of all the many performances I have.

I simply admire the artistic yet definite movement lines that distinguish this performance from the sharper harsher movements that I find in the more recent performances.

My daughter just discovered this piece so we watch it and other recordings a lot (few times a week).

The reason why I start to cringe when she asks to watch this performance is that after watching this ballet a few times (and the other recordings), the sloppy Orchestra playing really starts to get to me.

It is not a good orchestra period. Almost none of the entrances are on time which probably gave the soloists hell because they couldn't really trust the orchestra to be there when they ""land"" after a big jump, or a small one...

After a point you can notice that Vasilev just didn't care and left it to the the conductor to ""heard the band"" in his foot steps.
Maximova on the other hand was not that indifferent and there are spots where the orchestra (foul) playing really interferes, especially in the ""dance of the sugar plum fairy""...

All over the place there are miss entrances, sloppy passages  etc. What can I say, the Bolshoi Orchestra of that time was simply sub-par. In later recordings (like sleeping beauty from 1989) the orchestra is much better, not first class, but pretty good.

Bottom line: the dancing is as good as it gets but the music playing is mediocre. Get it as a second performance just to get a taste of classical Russian ballet dancing in its finest.",1300752000,12,1697,4.69023569023569
316686,4,6301170113,"The Bolshoi Ballet's Nutcracker is wonderful for two reasons. The first, the beautiful dancing of the principal artists Yekaterina Maximova and Vladimir Vasiliev. There is a kind of oneness about their dancing, her point work and extensions are superb and his leaps are astounding. This recording was made in 1978 and lacks some of the freshness of later recordings such as the Cojocaru, Dowell, Royal Ballet made in 2001 which is fresh and a very strong performance from the leading dancers. The second reason why I give is DVD preference over Royal Ballet is that there are no children used in the Bolshoi version and that may not always be a plus for some people but it is for me. Also in the Bolshoi the doll dancers are as they should be, mechanical and rigid as dolls are, these dancers are wonderful in themselves and help make this a truely beautiful ballet recording. At times the orchestra is a little harsh and brassy and the camera work a little out of focus eg. the Snowflake Dance for instance but I still give it 4 1/2 stars.",1290038400,4,1040,4.596774193548387
316687,5,6301170113,"First of all I can't understand why they say it is not for kids. Why should we give them pink lemonade entertainment(like San Francisco version)

This performance is superb. The way dance blended with music is amazing. There is subtle humor and brilliant acting. It perfectly convey Hofmann's spirit. Stage set is simple and it doesn't distract your attention. They say it is dated. This music wasn't composed yesterday either. Anyway I prefer this sets to tasteless opulence of San Francisco version. Well, picture is not crisp and you can see it was filmed decades ago.

316689,4,6301170113,"This Nutcracker is by and for Adults.  Other reviewers have ably noted the facts about what choices were made by the choreographer.  Whether you like or dislike those choices is an individual preference.  I liked the choices and enjoyed the opportunity to focus on the superb dancing without distractions.  Maximova and Vasiliev dance wonderfully.  Some of the other dancers are out-of-sync at times but it didn't bother me much.  What I look for is an overall spontaneity which I did find in this performance.

As for the flaws, there are two areas which detract.  One, the visual. Two, the aural.

As for the visual, the stage and sets look very dark. I can't help but think that in person it did not look so gloomy.  I suspect that the video production was poorly chosen and executed.  Wrong cameras? Wrong settings?  Poor equipment?  Poorly handled?  Just guesses.  The First Act, especially, is dreary looking visually.  I actually turned the brightness up about 30 degrees on my TV to compensate.  That helped and I recommend anyone buying this DVD to do the same.  At least some color popped out after doing that.  The Second Act was a very pleasant surprise as the curtain lifted.  The set was so much more theatrical (befitting the storyline of course) and fun.  Much more visually engaging than the First Act.

As for the aural, the sound quality is poor.  Or maybe ""distant"" would be more accurate?  Or over-processed?  I'm guessing that the sound team wanted to make sure that there was no audience noise audible, being a ""live"" performance.  So they applied sound processing with a heavy hand and squashed out not only any/all audience noise (like coughs) but also a lot of the top end of the threater orchestra.  The result?  A drab, flat, distant sound quality which was certainly not the reality of how that pit orchestra sounded that day.  Even through that heavy blanket one can hear a very vibrant (some would say too vibrant) Russian orchestra of considerable quality.  The conductor sets a brisk pace and does a nice job of keeping the music flowing along.  The trumpets are too loud and coarse for my taste, but that's the Russian way (of trumpet performance).

A last note.  This DVD performance, though seriously flawed in some ways, is still a great deal.  At the time of this writing they are going (in fine condition) for about $5 each here on Amazon.  What a bargain!  But not for kids.  This is a DVD by and for adults.  For ballet-loving, Tchaikovsky-loving, tradition-loving, adults.

Put the kids to bed, turn up the brightness on your tv (and by necessity the sound too), settle into a comfy chair, and enjoy this diamond in the rough.",1221868800,13,2668,4.74235807860262
316690,1,6301170113,"If you don't mind listening to music on a transistor radio (circa 1960s) then you'll enjoy this DVD.  The sound quality is the absolute worst I have ever heard in the past 20 or so years.  I played this through a high-end home theater system and it sounded no different than listening to it through a conventional TV with all the bass and treble completely turned off.  This DVD is worthless.  I guess the old adage, ""you get what you pay for"" is true.  At just under $10 bucks I should have know something wasn't right.  If you buy this for the ballet, go for it.  But if you buy it primarily for the music,  don't.",1196640000,9,616,4.25
316691,5,6301170113,"This version of the Nutcracker satisfied every bit of my need to see superb, Russian, ballet technique in all its glory! True, it may lack in color and zest (ofcourse Americans can't imagine anything unless it's dripping in blinking lights and such), but the rather drab colors may have been an attempt to demonstrate contrast between what ought to be focused on and what NOT to focus on. Remember, this is the Bolshoi, not Las Vegas....this is world class Ballet at it's finest and Maximova and Vasiliev deliver 10-fold.  I prefer the renditions where Masha is both child AND adult dancing in both acts as opposed to one version of her in Act I and then another version of her in Act II.  I also loved how Masha and the Nutcracker danced the Grande Pas de Deux, instead of the Sugar Plum Fairy that you might see in a Balachine Production.  Overall, if you're a dancer who can appreciate technique-then you'll love this, however, if you're a mom looking for another ""Barbie Nutcracker"", you'll hate this.",1165795200,23,1005,4.698863636363637

7810013,3,6301170113,"This live performance was shot during the Soviet epoch. Consequently, the resolution is nothing like HD. The sets are not very good but don't detract from the ballet. Maximova and Vasiliev dance the principal roles gloriously. I didn't realize that they were both legends, and were married. I am not aware of another Nutcracker DVD by this pair, so this is it!. Maximova's performance is lively, accomplished and sprightly, while Vasiliev's strength makes her appear as light as a feather, especially in some spectacular lifts. He is an exceptional prince in every aspect. Their roles are expanded in this version, and that alone may make it worthwhile. They also dance together in Spartacus which is available on DVD. The Bolshoi's large cadre of excellent dancers is hard to match. Grigorovitch's choreography and story line differ somewhat from the traditional Nutcracker, but theycombine to make this a coherent and marvelous production. The stereo sound quality is very good but may not be up to snuff for audiophiles. There are some technical glitches in this recording, but most ballet films that I have seen, have some of these. Overall, I am glad purchased this but you need to be aware of the technical limits of this recording.

Close inspection of the curtain reveals the letters CCCP, and other traces of the USSR but I detected no Soviet themes in this bsllet.",1514073600,,1374,5.0
7810014,3,6301170113,"Watched this on demand as I could not afford to go to the actual dance this year. Not my favorite version by far.

Pros:
I love how the relationship between Drosselmeyer and Clara is depicted with their dance together.
As much as other people disagree, I like the old vs young Clara. In every ballet I have seen, Clara always seems to be slightly too old for her part. This girl was of perfect age. Maybe it is my nostalgia talking, but I liked how it was similar to Barbie in the Nutcracker with how Clara was the Sugar Plum Fairy too.
The overall relationship with Clara and her prince seems so much more genuine than in other adaptions.

Cons:
The Arabian dance. Not the sensual, beautiful couple's dance you are used to.
The conductor. It was almost disruptive showing him in between set changes. I would prefer a version where you are just watching the stage while it fades to black.
No angel dance. Instead, you have to sit and watch an old conductor for the whole score.
What is the heck up with the stuffed doll? If you are gonna have a stuffed Nutcracker doll, make him look like a nutcracker and not an old-fashioned clown doll of shorts.
Having 3-4 other males aside from the prince dance with Clara for the pas de deux. Distracting and loses the intense beauty of the dance.
A very abrupt, abridged version of the sugar plum fairy dance.",1514073600,,1349,4.4574898785425106
