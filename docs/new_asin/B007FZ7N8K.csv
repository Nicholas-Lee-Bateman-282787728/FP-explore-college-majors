5084074,5,B007FZ7N8K,"Gotta love Ernest!! Jim Varney provides hours of clean, wholesome entertainment for kids and parents alike. Whether you grew up in the 80s watching Ernest on tv, or you're experiencing his crazy antics for the first time, this is sure to bring a smile....and maybe a head shake or two. Jim Varney was one of the entertainers that was taken from us too soon, and I can only imagine some of his skits  and characters if he could have stayed around in the 21st century.",1383350400,,466,4.482352941176471

5084076,5,B007FZ7N8K,"I bought this just today at the store and I'm sure I'll enjoy it.  I haven't seen anything with Jim Varney in it that I haven't enjoyed.  The best thing about it is.  I live close to his hometown.  My father went to school with him, so I've heard many interesting things about his life before he became well known.  Anyway.  If you like Jim Varney, buy this.  It's a treat.",1372377600,2,373,4.169014084507042
5084077,4,B007FZ7N8K,"This is rubber faced Jim Varney`s DVD debut of his long sought after film Ernest Rides Again(released Nov/93),and a re-release of Ernest in the Army(the original title is at the end of the flick-released Feb/98).The former is in full screen,while the second is in widescreen. These movies are both on the first disc,but what has me baffled is what is on the second disc. It contains Ernest`s Greatest Hits Volumes 1 & 2,not strange in and of itself,I`ll grant you. However,Volume Two(greatest hits) is the SAME as Volume 1,and,of course,visa versa. So what gives? You`re guess is as good as mine.
Ernest Rides again stars Varney along with Canadian comic Ron James as the professor. Ernest is a janitor who gets involved with a professors quest to find an old revolutionary war cannon called Goliath,into which was put the REAL Crown jewels of England. The English secret service has kept this a secret from the world,while another professor at the university vies for the cannon and its contents. When Ernest`s`professor friend finds the cannon and jewels the chase is on from the competing professor and the British secret service. Will the good guys get and keep the crown jewels,or will they head back to England?Stay tuned. 3 stars.
Ernest in the Army has Varney joining the army after the urging of a buddy sargeant already there. Well,it`s not the army per s&eacute;,but the reserves. It seems a very small country has gotten a hold of a plutonium missile so it is up the Ernest`s rag tag reservists to go over to the sands of the Middle east and kick some patriotic butt. To top it all Ernest is seen as the great white saviour and he befriends a small boy in the process. 3 stars.
Ernest Greatest Hits Vol/1 & 2 ,as I mentioned are duplicates,but they contain a plethora of Varney`s 80s commercials with plenty of bloopers and outtakes. Very funny stuff.
Technically speaking everything looks good,though Ernest Rides Again can and does get grainy at times. It could use a good remastering/or print striking.
For all the Ernest compleatists out there,this is the DVD set to own,as it finally debuts Ernest Rides Again. For Ernest Goes to School,see Volume 2 of this series. I rate this set high(higher if the duplication wasn't there)because this is complete family entertainment,by one of the funniest characters ever devised by a man who sure knew his comedy handbook,big time...knowwhat I mean?",1341360000,7,2406,4.885085574572127
