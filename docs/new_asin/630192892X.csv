7816921,2,630192892X,"Date on VHS box 1986 - when Stand-Up was hot. I Love Steven Wright - and is why I bought this video.
I paid someone to transfer it to DVD-R. They are trying to make it seem at least like a National event -
where they jump cut from NYC to L.A. - to Toronto etc. Steven's time on here is Brief and Not what I consider his best.
They have Ellen Degeneres and others - mostly pictured on box.
It doesn't click for me. - Too much jumping around - which I Can follow - I just Don't like this.
And most of the acts - if you listen - and take away the stage presence and laughter - aren't that funny.
I say this video is more of comedy historical significance than something worth watching.
Another Amazon reviewer suggests buying it on DVD - but I have Never seen that - so I don't know what they are talking about (maybe they don't know either?) Scott M.",1386547200,,848,4.023668639053255

7816923,4,630192892X,I first saw this stand-up show on HBO a long time ago when I was a kid and loved it. When I saw it again last year I thought it was even better. Here you can see great young comedians taking there first steps to stardom like  Ellen Degeneres. This video also has great comedy veterans like Robin  Williams and Howie Mandell. You also get to see clips from there earlier  performances when they too where starting out. So I really recomend this  product if you love stand-up comedy.,957657600,13,481,4.370786516853933
