8119797,5,B000FAL180,"This 45 minute documentary has stunning underwater video in a pristine habitat (Everglades?).  It reveals the life-cycle and habits of the largemouth bass in ways never seen by the millions of anglers who fish for this creature, but never see what's going on below the surface of the water.  With all the fishing videos on the market, it's a shame this one has never been converted to DVD.",1204588800,,389,4.705882352941177
