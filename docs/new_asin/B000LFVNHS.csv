8161903,3,B000LFVNHS,"We enjoyed the video for the information it contained and being able to see again some of the places we visited, but were disappointed with the quality, very fuzzy in many places.",1261526400,5,179,4.625
8161904,5,B000LFVNHS,"The informative quality in this wonderful dvd compensated for the picture quality, which really wasn't as bad as someone stated here.  I watched it, and re-watched it again on my 50"" Samsung plasma Lcd screen and it was equally enjoyable each time with decent quality picture.
This is definitely a keeper of a dvd, wich has inspired me to travel to this most beautiful part of the world.  I also enjoyed learning that the Lippizaner horse was named after Slovenian Lipica. Beautiful animal from a beautiful place.  Croatia made me speechless with its absolutely Gorgeous Adriatic Coast.  The more I learn about this incredible place, the more impressed I am with the culture, people and all the Beauty.",1254873600,9,702,4.923728813559322
8161905,5,B000LFVNHS,"This was very helpful.  I think it's a good idea to do some research before one goes off to new places.  Since I'll be in Slovenia in October, I might even consider making a visit to Croatia.",1218067200,,191,4.135135135135135
8161906,5,B000LFVNHS,"Ok, I will agree somewhat with the previous reviewer.  The picture is not quite as sharp as we've come to expect in this HiDefinition age.  Though, given that I DO have a small TV, it was not particularly bothersome. (But no, except for a few brief bits which MAY have been older, it was all clearly filmed recently, NOT in 1970's.)

The content, however was great.  While the producers set themselves quite a challenge in trying to cover two countries in a little over an hour, they met the challenge admirably. The DVD offers far more depth than is typical of a travel program.  Viewers get the chance to see the most famous highlights of each country (Bled, the Triple Bridge in Ljubliana, Plitivice Lakes, Dubrovnik, Diocletian's Palace etc.) and a few lesser known sites and cities (Idrija, Lipica, Pag). I was especially impressed that they did NOT shy away from talking about the darker aspects of the area's recent past. For example, enroute to the Croatian coast, we pass 'empty villages' that were once the home of Serbian residents.
My only minor complaints about content are that they spent rather too much time on the Lipizzan horses, and on a particular restaurant on Hvar. Oh, and there are no subtitles or extras.",1194739200,6,1229,4.751173708920188
