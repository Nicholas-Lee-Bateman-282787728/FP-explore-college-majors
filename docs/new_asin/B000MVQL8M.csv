The whole video seminar consists of (8), 26+-minute, sequential, messages by Bruce Wilkinson. Each teaching is accompanied by several scripture references for personal validation, as any student of scripture would expect. Bruce Wilkinson has written several books that I have NOT read. He also wrote the popular, small book - ""The Prayer Of Jabez"".

 I don't recall HOW I first came to watch this video seminar, ""A LIFE GOD REWARDS"" but it is EXCELLENT. 44 years of collective and personal Bible research agrees with 95% of the basic principles that Bruce teaches on this DVD. (Even scholars agree that +-5% of scripture resists human harmonizing)
 I know there is a BOOK Mr Wilkinson has published by the same name, I've not read it so I cannot comment on it but I ASSUME it contains the same basic information. Look at other reviews of the video material or the book before you believe what I've written here.

 The information shown in this video series SHOULD HAVE BEEN information that EVERY new Christian believer received, either from the teachers who taught, or from their own personal research that they had done to ""prove"" what they were taught WAS IN FACT WHAT THE BIBLE HAS SAID.
I've learned many things since the 1960's concerning the simple, true message of the ""Gospel"", and I'm talking about the same message that Billy Graham proclaimed from 1938 to his official retirement recently.
A follower of God's Son should ""never be afraid to question"" something that does not sound like it is in harmony with what they have read themselves or researched and are still not satisfied with.",1432598400,,1887,4.94006309148265
