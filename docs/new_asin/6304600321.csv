The first Italian actor of the XX  Century shone so passionately natural, with such acting level as few times you will be capable to admire or even compare. To say this performance influenced to Al Pacino in the later remake is more than obvious.

The beauty of Agostina Belli and the assertive script; the fine irony, the corrosive cynicism of that man fallen in disgrace due his blindness will learn a life lesson when a woman convinces him the life - even in the worst conditions - deserves to be lived.

This is the sumptuous and supreme masterwork of Dino Risi, by far. A real legacy for future generations of filmmakers and the audiences who will survive us. It's useless to state this is one of my personal top one hundred films in any age!",1107993600,8,827,4.574324324324325
915607,5,6304600321,"I must confess I did not know this film existance after the other one with Pacino was released. Because I was so disappointment with it I thought that maybe the Italian one was better. And it is.

I think that humanity is the first word to describe it. The character of Fausto , played by an extraordinary Vittorio Gassman, is a man in all his complexity  and humanity. He does not accept his blindness and wants to live as if he were still seeing. He knows it is a lie, but it is the only way he has to live. He is rude, unpolite, dictatorial and you love him. Not because you feel pity for him, but because he is human and only the great Vittorio could played a man like him. It is a masterful performing.

On  a long trip from Turin to Naples he has the company of a young soldier, Ciccio, played by a competent Alessandro Momo. He is the the link between the audience and Fausto. He is shocked by this strange man, who is unbereable but who also shows him how to open to life.

I think this film is by far better that the one with Pacino. This is real, because the characters are not unidimensional. they have weakness and virtues. And also shows us dignity in its crudest, realistic way.

This film talk about real people, forgetting sterotipes. In their journey we learn that friendship, real one, comes from accepting others faults and not by praising their virtues. It is  a film I really encourage to see by anyone who likes good cinema.",1102464000,14,1446,4.333333333333333
7876248,3,6304600321,"Profumo di Donna might seem like a cheesy Italian romance and it does have its overly melodramatic moments, but due to the subtle acting of Gassman and the great chemistry between Gassman and Momo the movie has a well-balanced narration. It cannot simply be reduced to sex jokes and lewdness, although Fausto's jokes sometimes are rather crude. The writing is spot on and the message of a broken old army captain is fantastically presented against the backdrop of some of Italys most beautiful cities.
Overall 7/10

7876249,2,6304600321,"""See the original! See the original""! (Not that I was ever tempted to see the Pacino remake). This has got to be among the most sexist pieces of tripe ever to be taken seriously. EVERY woman is a tramp or a whore, The sole exception is an angelic, spectacularly beautiful madonna, hopelessly in love with a blind, bitter, abusive drunk twice her age. Yeah, right). The bathos is unrelenting, and the acting is, shall we say, of the scenery-chewing variety. That being said, the scenery is rather tasty. But that's it. AVOID this ""classic"".",1483574400,,539,4.74468085106383

7876251,3,6304600321,"I liked the American Version better.  In the Italian version, the captain finally overcomes his pride and admits to the woman he loves that he needs her. That was good, but seemed to work on only one level.  In the American version, the colonel not only chooses life, but he redeems himself by saving Charlie.  And it is implied that he had begun a relationship with one of Charlie's teachers that could lead to the thing that the colonel had always dreamed of but never felt that he could attain:  the love of a good woman.  In both versions, the guy gets the girl, but I felt the American version was superior.  There was more of a relationship between the characters that the Italian version lacked.",1441497600,,702,4.531746031746032

7876254,5,6304600321,Gassman's performance is unforgettable. A masterpiece of the Italian cinema. Not to be confused with Al Pacino's movie bearing the same title but only a good copy.,1390262400,,163,5.074074074074074
7876255,4,6304600321,"Well, I liked the movie for its sentimental appeal as well as the free spirited nature of the Italian life. The Sara character was particularly beautiful, reminded me of someone I know. This is the original version. Not exactly what I expected, however, I stopped expecting after 15 minutes and accepted the movie as it is. For today's audience it may seem boring a bit--kind of slow paced and occasional over-acting. Yet, I recommend it just because it's the original. The girl Sara is really beautiful.:-):-)",1314921600,,510,4.941860465116279

7876257,2,6304600321,"A rather stilted ungainly original version of Scent of a Woman. It was not all that enjoyable but I stayed with it and it did have its moments. The main character was made to look like a dirty old man which was quite unsavoury and ruined it a bit for me. I am keen on the remake (even though it is mainly a vehicle for Al Pacino), but it was good to see the original, warts and all. The Italian setting and scenery was great to see.",1245369600,,432,3.9770114942528734
