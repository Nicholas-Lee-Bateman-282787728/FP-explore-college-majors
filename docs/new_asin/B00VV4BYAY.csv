8711397,5,B00VV4BYAY,"These are some very amusing situation comedies from the early to mid-1930s. Carol Tevis, June Brewster, Dorothy Granger and Grady Sutton keep getting into all sorts of hard-to-explain situations, and we get to laugh at all the comic complications. Long before TV sitcoms, there were the theatrical films of comedians like Charley Chase and others like the ones in these shorts. They explored the different ways that people could end up getting embarrassed or in trouble with their spouses, jealous girlfriends and bosses, often through little fault of their own.

Considering that these films were all made more than 80 years ago, they hold up well and are funny to watch in our time. The cars and clothing styles we see in these films have changed, but the funny ways that people can get themselves into a mess are still as funny today. These short films were unavailable until this DVD came out, and I'm glad that I have it. I plan on watching it again sometime soon.",1493164800,3,969,4.767857142857143
8711398,5,B00VV4BYAY,I am the fellow who owned the 16mm complete & sharp original prints of shorts from this never compiled series that had in their casts & were created by many Hal Roach employees!  George Stevens even directed !!!!  But these shorts if you love classic comedy from the Pre-Code era is what Roach's THE BOYFRIENDS series could have been like had the cast been a bit older !!!,1488844800,8,372,4.455882352941177

8711400,5,B00VV4BYAY,"Blondes and Redheads: In this new DVD package of early RKO comedy shorts long out of the public eye, we get to see three two-reeler shorts called: ""The Undie World,"" ""Rough Necking,"" and ""The Dancing Millionaire,"" all shot in 1933.  It was promoted as a series and what fun it is.  The Hal Roach Studios were having budgetary problems at this stage of the depression, so RKO hired many Roach alumni for these titles.  Former cameraman George Stevens directed these shorts and started his way up the ladder of success for many prestigious features in later years.  The series revolves around two gals, Carol Tevis, June Brewster and later, Dorothy Granger.  This comedies have been compared to Roach's the ""Boyfriend Series,"" and lots of familiar faces show up:  Grady Sutton, Tiny Sanford, Charlie Hall and they know their stuff.  Much appreciation goes to John ""Mr. Movie Man"" Carpenter who shared his private collections of 16 MM prints to make these reasonable priced DVD's possible.  The images and sound are surprisingly great.",1445299200,6,1032,4.994152046783626
