8223916,5,B000WM84PO,"I've bought this workout over and over again over the years and it always ends up being my go to when I need a cardio workout.  The first level is heavy on lunges, but I think that's great because once you master that level and it's lunge-iness, everything seems so much easier!  I also see a serious toning effect on my legs after doing this workout, especially thighs.  Not quit Body Pump tone but, pretty close for an at-home workout.  I always recommend this one to people looking for an at home cardio.",1500940800,,507,4.419354838709677
8223917,5,B000WM84PO,It's great how I can't lose this since it's on my amazon account. I seriously have two copies around the house that I can't find,1496102400,,128,4.16
8223918,5,B000WM84PO,Love this workout! It really works and does not take a lot of time. There are different levels of intensity but you can always increase your weights as well; although weights are not required.,1483315200,,192,4.676470588235294
8223919,5,B000WM84PO,Great quick little workout that's very affective!,1468972800,,49,6.142857142857143
8223920,5,B000WM84PO,A great workout that anyone can do yet still feel sore the next day!,1452729600,,68,3.9285714285714284
8223921,5,B000WM84PO,"I love this video.  I have a few pounds to lose before going on vaca and have really enjoyed this difficult but not impossible work out.  the first work out of three is very lower body focused. The 1st day I could hardly walk. But, I toned down how intensely I go into it, and since then I feel the work out (in a good way) but can still go down stairs and sit without too much uncomfortableness.  It also works obliques.",1438387200,,421,4.109756097560975
8223922,4,B000WM84PO,Good work out if you put the effort in.  Don't love the yoga cool down.  Would prefer a traditional stretch at the end.,1436659200,,119,4.130434782608695
8223923,1,B000WM84PO,Did not like.,1411430400,,13,3.6666666666666665
8223924,4,B000WM84PO,The workout was good enough but since I bought this DVD digitally you have to select each level which can be very annoying when you're in the zone. Jillian and Bob were great and although I do not like the other trainer she did well. My only wish is that there was a play all button like there is on the other Biggest Loser workout.,1389312000,,332,4.123076923076923
8223925,4,B000WM84PO,"I haven't worked out in several months, so starting with this dvd was great for me.  It shows you the different levels you can do each exercise at, and showing people with different sizes working out is encouraging when you want to stop and see there still going.",1366070400,2,263,4.479166666666667
