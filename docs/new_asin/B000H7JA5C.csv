8137438,3,B000H7JA5C,"Tin Tan, as the title says, is an opportunistic man who takes advantage of women, taking money or whatever he can get a hold from them in exchange of a kiss (have you seen his mouth? and women seem to fall at his feet with that).

The ''funny'' part starts with a misunderstanding including his friend Marcelo Ch&aacute;vez, and a couple women who are not what they say they are: Celia Viveros and Martha Mijares. These two women, think Tin Tan has all the money he said he had, and to see if he really likes Mijares for herself and not for her money, they plot to switch places.
So, Mijares has the money, but Viveros (her assistant) pretends the money is hers. Now Marcelo will go after her. Tin Tan also tries to get that money but the women are very smart. Looks like Tin Tan finally found his match and will have a run for his money! Pun intended.
For me, the most hilarious scene is in the night club, between Marcelo y Celia while ordering from the menu... unforgettable!",1316736000,,978,4.373626373626373
