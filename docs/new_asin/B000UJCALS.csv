The movie was really good too if you like those older glossy soap operate types.  It was predictable but Barbara Stanwyck is always good to watch.

2922236,5,B000UJCALS,"""East Side, West Side"" is definitely not an intellectual picture, but it is so skillfully written and performed that it seems to be ""better than it is"" (Jerry Vermilye). The classical love triangle is worth watching, because it analyses an all-day marriage crisis with sometimes allegoric and witty dialogue which deals with the situation of a woman in her forties, married to an allegedly gentle, charming, but desperately weak husband who is attracted by a much younger - sorry - bitch (Ava Gardner). The movie shows the suffering beyond an all-day couples' life, and despite its banality, it is somehow feminist, because it demonstrates that a woman in her forties has much to lose and few to win. Having cared for his husband whom she desperately loves, she is neglected and betrayed for younger, exciting flesh. In a Hollywood picture of 1949, adultery has to be punished, but the ending of the film is nevertheless a consequent one, because this is a film about a weak, sexually and emotionally immature husband (James Mason) and a typical upper-class American housewife (Barbara Stanwyck) who is right in closing the door behind him. But there is no kind of triumph or women's lib in this attitude, for it is clear that Stanwyck's character has no alternative in life. She is an intelligent woman who gave up her ambitions long ago, and society will not allow her to come together with a sympathetic policeman (Van Heflin) who would be a perfect friend or husband for her. All this married life is full of constraint and hypocrisy. We see Mason and Stanwyck passing from ritual to ritual, from faade to faade, they have their weekly meetings with Stanwycks parents, their cocktail bars, etc., but apart from this, their life is empty. For a long time, Stanwyck is not complaining on it, but tries to save her marriage motivated by a deep love for her husband. She is not the tough lady we have seen in so many Stanwyck pictures, but she fights a nevertheless intense struggle with much - dignity. Yes, it is her dignity she tries to keep. This may not be the best movie ever, it is sometimes a bit soapy, but this is one of the best performances of Barbara Stanwyck. Her dignity and anxiousness are never hysterical, but emotionally touching and acted with a certain understatement which reveals her intense struggle to keep up the faade. The most remarkable scene she has is a conversation with her good friend (Nancy Davis, the later Mrs. Nancy Reagan). She predicts not to be afraid at all, but in some minutes, it is revealed that she is more afraid than ever. You don't remark any acting when her face, her voice and her self-consciousness change step by step, minute by minute, very slowly, but inevitably. And when you finally realize what happens with her, you will remark that Stanwyck herself has not realized it before and is mostly shocked about herself and the life she lives.

Ava Gardner is good in the ""bitchy"" part, although her part lacks any ambiguity. But it is remarkable how openly she plays the vamp card. ""Cheap, that's what you like"", she says to Mason, knowing she's right. Therefore, this allegedly soapy tearjerker is also a deconstruction of masculinity. And it's the proof that Hollywood should not neglect actresses beyond the 40th birthday. In a film released in 1949, we have remarkable confrontations between Stanwyck (* 1907) and Gardner (* 1922) in which the former deliberately searches the direct duel, knowing that it will be very difficult for her to win. But there is no doubt that she's the lead in this picture, which unfortunately was difficult for women older than forty. They were offered minor parts, Bette Davis (whom I adore) made the campy ""Beyond the Forest"" in the same year, playing a too old vamp with a silly wig, but Stanwyck got that wonderful part and played it so skillfully and touching. This is why I love this movie, despite some obvious mistakes. For example, a murder and its solution in the last twenty minutes are rather abrupt, silly and nothing more than a plot device in order to reveal that Mason didn't keep his promise not to see Gardner again. But as I tried to explain, the essential is elsewhere.

The picture has an outstanding cast (Stanwyck, Mason, Van Heflin, Cid Charisse, Nancy Davis, and Gale Sondergaard) and is directed by MGM veteran Melvyn LeRoy. The DVD quality is good, but there is some background noise during the dialogue. Unfortunately there is no audio commentary, but a funny Tex Avery Cartoon as additional material.",1260230400,11,4518,4.805912596401028
2922237,4,B000UJCALS,"The story isn't much, but the performances and direction make it well worth watching.  And Stanwyck for a change plays an almost timid gal.  Gardner is at her slutty best with a very meaty part as the other woman, Isabel.  And my favorite role is Sondergard's, masterfully portraying Stanwyck's mother.  Mason's part is pretty weak.  You wonder why any woman would want him........in fact, as Stanwyck says at the end......Isabel used to be between us....but now she's dead and now there's nothing between us.",1249084800,4,509,5.011904761904762
2922238,4,B000UJCALS,"Jessie (Barbara Stanwyck) is the wife of Brandon Bourne (James Mason). Brandon had an affair with Isabel Lorrison (Ava Gardner) in the past, but she went to Europe and Jessie and Brandon reconciled. Jessie loves Brandon terribly, but when she hears that Isabel is back in town, she's afraid. Her fears are confirmed as Brandon and Isabel continue their relationship. Meanwhile, Mark Dwyer (Van Heflin), an agent for the government, falls in love with Jessie. Jessie likes Mark but only wants to be friends with him because she loves her husband, even though he cheats on her. One day, Isabel calls Jessie and tells her to come to her apartment. Jessie comes and they get into an argument. Jessie leaves with Mark and two hours later, Brandon goes to Isabel's apartment, finding her dead. Who killed her?

This typical melodrama is saved by its all-star cast and good performances from all stars, but Stanwyck and Gardner give the best performances by far. Gardner is excellent as the self-proclaimed ""cheap"" harlot who knows how to make a man want her and keep on wanting her and Stanwyck shines in her wronged-wife character. Incidentally, Gardner and Robert Taylor, Stanwyck's husband at the time, had just had an affair during the filming of ""The Bribe"". I detect a hint of art imitates life here, especially in the scene where Isabel and Jessie have their little talk in Isabel's apartment, perhaps the most powerful scene in the film.

Fans of Stanwyck or Gardner should like this movie, even though it's not the best of the former nor the latter. But it's rather enjoyable, somewhat predictable, and overall good.",1194048000,28,1619,4.905109489051095

2922240,5,B000UJCALS,"""East Side, West Side""
(MGM, 1949)

This hybrid film noir/romance melodrama is a fascinating entry from the post-WWII era that blends broken hearts with busted noses.  The central character is Barbara Stanwyck's tortured, conflicted Jessie, an uptown socialite whose philandering husband (played deliciously by James Mason) seems hell-bent on destroying their marriage. When his old flame (a very naughty, very nasty Ava Gardner) comes back to town, old wounds are reopened, and Stanwyck has to choose -- again -- how much mental abuse she can take from one thoughtless man.  Although this has the makings of a Douglas Sirk saga, the weepy melodrama is counterbalanced by a steady stream of hard-bitten, cynical noir tough talk and witty banter, culminating in a brutal murder and a brief whodunnit mystery.

The female-produced script -- based on a book by Marcia Davenport and adapted for the screen by Isobel Lennart -- presents characters who are unusually nuanced. Mason is charming but a thorough cad; Stanwyck is likeable but self-consciously passive; the temptress Ava Gardner is just plain evil and the manly g-man Van Helflin is also civilized and reserved. Similarly, minor characters share these layers, and this film offers new shades to old Hollywood archetypes. (In one climactic scene, there is a brutish mutual fistfight between a man and a woman -- something we'd never seen like this, particularly in a film of this era -- an exchange that may still shock even today's jaded modern viewers...) A cool old film, and a treat for fans of both genres. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1373673600,3,1605,5.114503816793893

The mystery at the end is easily solved but getting there is worth the trip.

I almost forgot to mention Van Heflin another over looked actor who is his usual natural acting self and is reunited with Stanwyck after ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"".

2922244,4,B000UJCALS,"-----Ava Gardner is in this movie; I bought it for that reason. Her role is typical for her: a home-wrecker in a slinky black dress.  Her great beauty made that very understandable to an audience; she was very good at it.  This movie is high-quality soap opera.  The biggest defect of the movie is the actress who plays an ""Amazon Woman"" who can strangle Ava Gardner's character to death with little effort.  Apparently, no one noticed the actress was no amazon.  I read the actress was only 5'7"" tall.  The characters keep telling each other that she is an amazon; apparently trying to convince the audience that she is.  What is needed is a woman well over 6' tall to play the amazon role; a female Governor Arnold Swartznegger (6'4""+?) would be perfect.  I feel this one defect destroys credibility; it drags down the whole movie.  The ""Amazon Woman"" actress does a great job with the role, but she is just not an amazon. This movie has some great comic moments.  It is worth the price and the time.  Enjoy!  ---Jim",1349654400,,1018,4.56353591160221

2922246,4,B000UJCALS,"East Side West Side, is a story about a woman who grew up on the poor side of town,but is now a wealthy socialite living with her husband who has promised to mend his ways and stay true to their marriage. He is Brandon Bourne (James Mason) a solicitor who had an affair with Isabel Lorrison (Ava Gardiner) which nearly caused the breakup of his marriage to the well liked and respected Jessie Bourne (Barbara Stanwyck).
To the concern of her friends,Jessie forgives Brandon and believes him when he pledges his undying love for her. However Brandon is a louse, and when he meets up with a young model Rose Senta (Cyd Charise) in his favourite club, and discovers she knows who his wife is - it doesn't send out the red danger sign warning that it should. Along comes his former mistress Isabel Lorrison who has just arrived back in New York after some time away. The man that Isabel came in with sees her swept along by Brandon and follows them outside, where a fight ensures and photographers take Brandon's photo - spread eagled on the footpath.
Rosa comes to his rescue and bundles Brandon into a taxi and takes him to her home to sober up.
It is this incident that sends East Side,West Side spiraling into a series of confrontations and questions, that set up the rest of the movie.
1. Brandon has to go home and tell his long suffering wife that he's likely to be on the front page of the newspapers in a few hours - he wasn't where he said he was and anyway it wasn't his fault, it was all a misunderstanding...
2. The next day Jessie goes to her favourite fashion house to meet Rose for confirmation of Brandon's ""far fetched""story. Rose verifies her part in the incident and Jessie thanks her for getting Brandon away from the incident so quickly. The two become friends and Jessie offers to drive Rose to the airport to meet her ""fella"" Mark Dwyer (Van Heflin) home from reporting on the European situation. Mark and Jessie discover they are both going to be attending the same party that evening,and when Brandon fails to arrive home in time to take Jessie to the party,she goes on alone.
3. Finally, Jess telephones Brandon's secretary at home and discovers that Isabel Lorrison turned up at the office without an appointment to see Brandon. Jessie is shattered by this latest betrayal and Mark, alarmed by the state she is in, takes her home.
As time goes on we see Jessie and Mark discover they both come from the poor side of town,both have strong Italian ties, and they really get on.
When Jessie and her errant husband face each other it is Brandon who asks his wife for understanding - as he tries to explain his inexcusable behaviour.
Brandon ""Jess, can't you understand what this is for me ? I'm like a drunk who knows liquor will wreck him. He hates it. He hides from it. He tries...he tries.."" Jessie ""What are you asking for ? Permission ?""
Ava Gardiner - who often played the temptress in her earlier career - is again the seductress. She goes after what she wants and her language to Brandon leaves the audience in no doubt as to the kind of physical relationship she wants again - with Brandon.
Like most popular Hollywood movies of it's time, the roster of good actors in East Side,West Side runs deep. Nancy Davis plays Jessie's best friend who is concerned for her friend and disturbed by Brandon's behaviour. Gale Sondergaard is Nora Kernan, Jessie's mother. I have written about her before in The Letter as the Chinese mistress seeking revenge. Her career was ruined by the HUAC during the McCarthy era, but she was always a fine actress. Beverly Michaels - all 5feet 9inches of her - plays the dreaded Felice, whose man is being wooed away by Isabel. Felice is a nasty piece of work, who can take care of herself in a fight,as Mark Dwyer discovers. I don't know much about Ms Michael's career, but she was very effective and utterly convincing in East Side,West Side.

This film is entertaining, a bit too ""folksy"" for 2012, but is blessed by the presence of the great Miss Stanwyck, who was far and away one of the best actors of her time, James Mason - whose English films often saw him play the cruel cad - was perfectly cast as Brandon Bourne. Van Heflin, who was a quiet achiever in Hollywood, beautifully underplays his perfomance as the decent Mark Dwyer,and they were well supported by the likes of Nancy Davis,Gale Sondergaard, and Beverly Michaels. A definite 4 star movie.",1332374400,2,4414,4.55919395465995
2922247,4,B000UJCALS,"I thought the storyline of this film was pretty genaric. A regular soap opera type. But the performances are definately worth the buy! Barbra Stanwyck plays her part very well as an angelically good wife who is wronged by a morally weak husband.
The best performances, I have to say, must be James Mason and Ava Gardner. (They totally should have played in more movies together) James Mason plays a the part of the vulnerable and cheating husband. He plays his part so well that, despite his many stupid decisions and arrogant manner, I can't help but still like him.
So if you are into old movies, and like to analyze classic actors' performances, this movie is worth checking out.",1311552000,2,682,4.691666666666666
2922248,5,B000UJCALS,"This is a fabulous film with a fist full of hollywood's best stars. The plot, dialog, and the film as a whole lacks nothing. I don't want to spoil it so I won't expound. See it for yourself!",1289260800,11,190,4.026315789473684
8213500,4,B000UJCALS,"Review of East Side, West Side
Hot Toasty Rag, September 9, 2017

As everyone knows, I don't like Ava Gardner, so usually if I like one of her movies, I say I like it in spite of her. East Side, West Side is fantastic, including Ava, not in spite of her.
James Mason is married to Barbara Stanwyck, and in the 1940s, it was unusual for Hollywood to cast a woman past per prime as the lead. Some would say thats still the case now, and Barbara Stawyck, in her gray-streaked splendor, does a fantastic job. As does the fantastically conflicted James Mason, who gets seduced by his old flame Ava Gardner.

As if one temptation isn't complicated enough, Barbara Stanwyck gets distracted by policeman Van Heflin! Its a fantastic drama that turns into so much more as the film goes on, and Id love to read Marcia Davenports original novel, to see if the Ava Gardner scenes are even steamier on the page. I love the script and the characters, not to mention the compelling storyline. Its thrilling, smart, romantic, and intense. This is one classic you're not going to want to miss!",1504915200,,1075,4.536082474226804

8213504,3,B000UJCALS,"You can never predict what will sent a formerly flowering love relationship into a tail spin; indifference, longevity, boredom, philandering, and sometimes just plain murder. That is the premise, the ultimate premise of the film under review, Barbara Stanwycks East Side, West Side, a 1949 melodramatic murder mystery which takes place in high side West Side New York City and has its roots in low side East Side New Jack City as well. Purely by accident this will be the third film in a row that I have reviewed which has some relationship to that big, bad ass city and its eight million denizens. This one is as much about class structure, you know high and low class, in an urban environment as the others but has the added tingle of murder and mayhem among the upper crust to keep things moving at their normal slow pace among that set. (The other two films, both starring Gary Cooper, involved Great Depression light-hearted class struggle stuff and the usual romantic filler to expand the film time and bad ass upper crust characters by but 1949 the country was on the road to the golden age and the class struggle parts are muted to back in the day time).

Here is the way it played out, played out down and dirty, in this one. Former, or maybe not so former, playboy investment banker Brandon (played by a debonair James Mason) had been two-timing his West Side high society wife Jessie (played by Barbara Stanwyck) for years with a low-rent tramp Isabel, played by Ava Garner, a gold-digger from day one of her life probably, strictly from the East Side okay. He finally, or seemingly finally, decided that the staid and demur Jessie was for him and brushed Isabel off. Isabel healed her wounds in Paris for a while and then returned, returned to put her claws right back into Brandon. No prisoners taken this time. The replay of the past is what drives the first part of the story line. That and the introduction of Mark Dwyer, played by Van Heflin, an New York ex-cop now a very hush, hush governmental European agent (meaning CIA probably), who takes dead aim at the staid and demur Jessie.

Of course while Mark and Jessie are playing house, the no sex 1940s version of playing house Brandon had been entrapped (yeah, right) by the scheming Isabel. The battle was joined as Jessie was ready to fight tooth and nail for her man. Except a little problem came up-Isabel wound up dead, very dead in her upscale high rent apartment (paid for by some sweet man sugar daddy she had been hanging around with). And who is the number one suspect. No, not Jessie because she had an alibi in Mark. Yeah, Brandon was all set to take the fall, take the big step off up in Ossining. Is rich lover- boy Brandon though going take the fall for something he didn't do? No way because Mark, for a little breather from heavy duty CIA work, has this one solved before dinner with time for a nap. The sometimes gold-digger girlfriend of the sugar daddy who was paying Isabels bills got sore and put the bang-bang dead on old Isabel.

Heres the funny thing, the funny cultural thing you pick up from old films, the dame was continually called an Amazon, like very tall and statuesque, which was a crime, a social crime in those days when women were shorter than today. She would barely make a high school girls basketball team today. Heres the even funnier part after all the flap over Isabel and her fate it turned out Jessie left Brandon high and dry. Didnt really love the shell of a man he she had married. Maybe she will become Mrs. CIA over in Europe. Hey, not Barbara Stanwycks greatest flix (probably Double Indemnity is) but what can you expect from a melodrama, even one set in New York City.",1460851200,,3691,4.539039039039039
