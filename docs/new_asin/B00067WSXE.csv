2175101,3,B00067WSXE,"I'm not really sure how to review this item. I'll do the cons first: It's definitely dated. The production qualities are not the best, and although it says it's geared to younger would-be drummers, I think 7+ would actually be more accurate. My 5 y/o was so excited about getting this DVD to use with his drum kit, but never made it past the first 15 minutes. I think an older child (like 9+) might find it too corny to the point of babyishness, but maybe not.

The plus side isn't really a plus--it seems to be the only one out there. Hopefully your little drummer will find it more engaging than mine did because the material they present is sound.",1268697600,4,650,4.371900826446281
2175102,1,B00067WSXE,My son is 4 1/2 and couldn't sit through this video.  My son is obsessed with drumming and really wants to learn to play - but there is nothing engaging about this video.,1261353600,2,170,4.151515151515151
2175103,5,B00067WSXE,"I bought this for my nephew's 3rd birthday and he has watched it about 100 times. Unfortunately he's too young for private instruction, but he has always been obsessed with drums, and he's got great timing so far!",1201132800,7,213,4.631578947368421
2175104,1,B00067WSXE,"Get to the point, already!  This guy just talks and talks, taking forever to get the actual lessons.  My son does not have the patience to watch this video, and he really gets into watching bands play.  He absolutely loves the drums, but this is not at all holding his interest.  Though he's young, I think he'd prefer to watch a drumming video that's targeted to adults.",1201132800,29,371,4.492537313432836
2175105,5,B00067WSXE,Excellent video... It takes you step by step from the very beginning... They even teach you how to manage and take the sticks... It was made for kids... but everyone can start from there...,1200614400,4,189,4.588235294117647
2175106,5,B00067WSXE,"This is an excellent DVD to get your youngster (6-10 years old...mine is starting at 5) started on the drums.  Do not go out and purchase an expensive drum set.  Buy some sticks and a practice pad.  The ""Zuchini Brothers"" have engaging and outgoing personalities that kids love.  The lessos start very basic, and are best done with short segments, practice inbetween, and lots of rewards (kids love stickers).  Keep a notebook with lots of praise.  When your child completes the lessons, and has a real love for drums, it may be time to purchase that first piece, or junior set.  Lots of silly faces, expressions, and laughter, all while a 3 piece talented band plays catchy tunes that kids love.  ""You are what you eat"" and other such songs keep your child's interest.  A great job done by the producers.",1176768000,34,805,4.652482269503546

2175108,1,B00067WSXE,"This guy is all over the road... his inability to focus longer than a measure is very frustrating for a child as well as the parents attempting to help. I'm not a professional musician but, have been trained to instruct and this individual shouldn't be teaching when he cannot focus long enough to get a point across. He continually changes tempo, starts and stops, has no clear direction and inadequately skims over the basic foundations. He seems to focus more on an attempt to be silly and less on having a structure to the lessons.",1451260800,8,535,4.6421052631578945

2175115,4,B00067WSXE,"My 3.5 year old has been watching this video none stop for days. I was disappointed that they didn't play actual drums for most of it but instead a stool, but it doesn't seem to bother my kid, and what do I know about drums.",1412899200,2,224,4.0

2175118,2,B00067WSXE,"My son watched about 5 minutes of this before he was uninterested in it. It looks very outdated and the song wasn't too ear catching, which could be the cause of the lack of interest.",1388016000,,183,4.257142857142857

2175120,3,B00067WSXE,This product is great!  It has kept my 6 year olds attention and given him a start at learning how to play drums.,1370908800,,113,3.9130434782608696
2175121,2,B00067WSXE,I bought this for my son and he loves music especially drums it kept his attention for about 10-15 min I was really hoping he would like this,1357257600,,141,4.071428571428571
2175122,4,B00067WSXE,I thought it was kind of cheesy but my 2 year old responds well to it and tries to drum along so I guess it works. Based on my son's review I would recommend this to anyone with a young one that wants to make some noise.,1339632000,,220,3.702127659574468
2175123,3,B00067WSXE,"Have to agree with other reviewers here. Too much talk, not enough action . If you wade through all the somewhat manic banter, he really has a very good fundamental set of progressive drills for learning how to drum properly, but my five-year-old lost interest after about five minutes and so did I. Maybe older kids who are self-motivated will get more out of this.",1334275200,,366,4.6461538461538465
2175124,1,B00067WSXE,"I bought this DVD for my child because he loves to play drums, but the DVD is so bored because these guys talking and talking , and never get to the lesson, and when they finally start to give the lesson they just count 1,2,3,4. it's all what they do. not good. money poorly spent....",1306454400,2,284,4.181818181818182
2175125,3,B00067WSXE,"Our son was 3&1/2 when he received this for Christmas.  I have to agree with most of the reviews here.  It's kind of mixed.  I am a certified public school music teacher, and I found the instruction was very good for young children.  However, my son watched for 10 minutes and lost interest.  He loves drumming, but I think this was too wordy for someone his age.  An older child that can concentrate longer, about 7 or so, might enjoy it if they didn't think it's too corny.  I do agree that the look of the studio & clothing is outdated, but the songs are cute.  I think it's too long for someone under 8 years, unless you let them watch a few minutes at a time and then take breaks inbetween to practice (I wouldn't try that in one day; maybe break it up into several days).  I did this with my son and I think my hands were crossed by the end of the video!  I did like how they make it easy enough for anyone to play, regardless of if you have a drumset or not.  In a nutshell, this isn't too bad for a young child, but you may want to look around and see if there's something a little better for preschoolers (though I don't know that there's that much out there on drumming for that age group).",1300752000,13,1200,4.1072961373390555
2175126,3,B00067WSXE,"Video is ok.  Bought for my 4 year old to watch while he ""played"" his first drumset, but it didn't really hold his or my interest.  Would be better suited for a child a little older.  I like that the guys are silly on the dvd and making it fun for the kids, but it's also kind of corny and looks outdated.  Maybe in a year or two my son will like it better.",1295136000,4,357,3.7837837837837838

He's not kidding, it's an assault on the senses.  I'm keeping this video and going to figure out some way to make others watch it as a practical joke.  Wow.",1470528000,,316,3.9523809523809526
