My only complaint is that they seem to have you change your effort level a little too frequently, but I assume that's to keep you engaged.  I really like that I can just turn off the narrative/coaching and just listen to the sounds of the road.",1327622400,,359,4.173913043478261
8450923,5,B00508VTFM,"Love this series especially with Johnny.  He encourages but isn't bugging you all the time.  They are a good pace, nice scenery and for me 35 minutes on my elliptical is all I can do at least for now.  Just wish he would do a Paris one.  I have several of this series and no dud yet.",1456012800,,283,3.912280701754386
8450924,3,B00508VTFM,"Not really a hike, more like a run. Beautiful scenery but I found this to be way too fast-paced for an average walk. Whoever recorded this made it appear to be running over big rocks and boulders. I usually hike about 2 MPH and the slowest this sets at is 4 MPH. Not many people walk normally at 4-6 MPH. If it was slower paced it would be perfect, but I was a bit disappointed that the scenery flying by didn't match my pace walking on my treadmill.",1415232000,5,450,4.125
8450925,5,B00508VTFM,"ORDERED ON THURSDAY MORNING FOR DELIVERY SATURDAY, IT ARRIVED FRIDAY AFTERNOON. HAS MADE USING MY TREADMILL MUCH MORE PLEASANT. INSTEAD OF GETTING SIDE TRACKED BY NEWS STORIES, I CAN ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL SCENERY OF ALL THE HIKING TRAILS I HAVE AVAILABLE TO ME ON THIS VIDEO.",1374537600,2,273,4.956521739130435
8450926,4,B00508VTFM,"Virtual Active provides a 35 minute workout that helps you simulate the experience of hiking through beautiful trails in the Northeast during the fall foliage season.  It provide a visual stimulus that is missing when just listening to music, and I find it better than watching a TV program that engages the mind, but has nothing to do with your physical activity (kind of like patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time).  The DVD menu provides two viewing options: Guided Hike or Basic Hike.  The Basic Hike shows only the nature hike and you can choose to hear just the nature sounds of the surrounding environment (birds and water) or include a music track (which I find to be uninspired, techno/drum machine music) along with the nature sounds.  The Guided Hike is the same as the Basic Hike except that a trainer pops up every so often in a box in the top left side of the screen to provide instructions and motivational guidance.  Also at the top left of the screen is a suggested ""Rate of Perceived Exertion"" (RPE) level (using your individual scale to match your physical abilities) for changing your workout pace.

I had conceived of such a product awhile back and was glad to find out that it actually exists.  It isn't perfectly executed, but it is very good.  The vantage point seems to be a person that is about 6 feet tall.  The camera just glides in the direction of the trail at a steady pace.  The pace seems a little fast for a hiker.  The camera goes over rocks and steep inclines so effortlessly!  Occasionally, you see other hikers on the trail and they step aside to let the camera (who is now you) go right by.  When you reach the end of the trail you might come to a beautiful waterfall or vista.  The camera scans the vista (though a little quickly) and then you are off to hike the next trail.  At the end, there is a five minute cool down period where you get to revisit the beautiful sites without the rush.

I own several of the Virtual Active Hiking videos.  I enjoy the Northeast video the best (maybe because I live in the Northeast).  On all of the videos, I have questioned some of the trail choices as they are not all consistently spectacular.  I have my treadmill in front of my 60"" TV.  I turn on the Basic Hike video, add my own music for inspiration, turn on the fan, and turn out the lights so that I feel like I'm actually on a hike.  One time I sprayed some forest scent for more realism, but that was going too far.  ;-)",1361059200,7,2482,4.38512035010941
8450927,5,B00508VTFM,"This was one of the first walking DVDs I purchased and I was not disappointed. The video is a great & realistic hiking pace
and full of scenic beauty. It is definitely one of my favorites. I like that you can turn on or off the virtual coach and that you the hikes can be done all at once or broken up into shorter hikes, depending on your time allowance.",1354320000,,355,4.085714285714285
8450928,5,B00508VTFM,"This is a great cycling DVD to help keep you motivated to ride the stationary bike, especially in the wintertime when I want to be outside, but don't like the cold!!",1352937600,,165,4.354838709677419
8450929,3,B00508VTFM,"This was my first indoor cycling video.  I was attracted to it because it covered the Northeast, one of my favorite areas.  However, the video quality did not appear to be that good.  It did not have a high degree of clarity.  Also, the video looks like it was shot from the top of a moving car - it appeared to move along faster than one would on a real bike.  The bizarre part was when the road ran out and one was biking through the woods...supposedly at 80+ rpm.  Not realistic.  The narrator was obviously sitting comfortably in an armchair, with a glass of wine in front of her.  No energy or connectedness in her voice.

I did like the graph that appeared at intervals so you knew what was coming up.  It would have been nice to see it a little more frequently.

The length and intensity of the workout was good, and the way the video ends with a dead end at waterfront was clever.  But I probably will not buy another video from these folks because, due to the items above, I just couldn't get fully into it.",1351728000,,1016,4.234375
8450930,5,B00508VTFM,"I purchased this for my husband to make his daily treadmill workouts more enjoyable. He really does enjoy them and spends more time with his workouts now.  Videos arrived in a couple of days, Thanks Again, Amazon",1341360000,2,212,4.72972972972973
8450931,3,B00508VTFM,"Loved the scenic trails on this video, but oh, so disappointed in the length.  Im training for the big 26.2 and was hoping to get much more distraction and mileage out of this video.  Only about 30-35 mintues of video available.  No other options.  So, yes, I was disappointed.",1329955200,2,277,4.591836734693878
8450932,3,B00508VTFM,"This is a great aid to your treadmill workout - it makes it much more enjoyable and significantly mutes the passage of time. Recommended.

So why only 3 stars? Because there is so much room for improvement.
1 - The sessions are too short. Even a 5k run will take most people longer than the running portion of the video.
2 - Longer runs with less jumping from scene to scene would draw the participant into the event, rather than it being a highlight reel of the area.
3 - It would be better if the speed at which this was shot was consitent. I did not notice the differnce between my running pace, and the pace at which the video was shot as much as I expected (hardly at all), but the varied speeds of the video distracted from the overall quality.",1329696000,2,750,4.244755244755245
