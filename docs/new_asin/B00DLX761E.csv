5832419,5,B00DLX761E,I have tried many Fitness DVDS and this is by far the best. Lisa encourages you to keep going even at your most exhausted moments. I like being able to personalize my workouts and most of all feel like a total body workout at the end. I highly recommend everyone to try it if you want to be motivated and see/feel results. I hope to see a full line of Lisa's videos soon!,1379635200,6,371,4.095890410958904
5832420,5,B00DLX761E,"I have done this HiiT workout about 4 times now and I LOVE IT!!! I was huffing and puffing and sweating bullets. I LOVE that you can customize it like you want. If you only have time for one 10 minute workout you can do that,you can choose the one that you wanna do,OR you can choose to do 2 or 3 or 4 or all 5. LOVE THAT!!! You can also choose to put them in any order you want them in. FABULOUS!!! Definitely in my rotation. Lisa Kinder is nice,motivating,sweet person. I Highly recommend this DVD.",1379635200,4,500,4.112244897959184
5832421,5,B00DLX761E,I was ready to give up during the third segment. I wad covered in sweat. This is one of the more if not most challenging 10 minute solution DVD I have ever tried. It reminds me of Amy DIxions' Breathless Body DVD's.,1379635200,7,215,4.142857142857143
5832422,5,B00DLX761E,"This is what exercise is all about when you have no time for a long monotonous workout.  Even though I am older and have had a hip replacement, I could still do the exercises that were on this 10 Minute Solution DVD.  I may not have done all of them exactly like Lisa Kinder did, but I did them close enough that I worked up a sweat and was panting.

There are 5 different 10 Minute exercises to work out every part of your body.  You can create your own custom workout that works best for your body, age and any other need you have.

I was very thankful for the 10 second recovery time between each exercise. It helped me catch my breath and get ready to dig in again.  This is one DVD that both my and I can do together.",1379548800,5,722,4.013986013986014
5832423,5,B00DLX761E,"Just received and it really is a good workout. I love the fact, as with all the 10 min. solution DVD's, you can do as much or as little as you want depending on your time restrictions. You will not need any weights to do this (just fans, you will most likely sweat!!). ENJOY",1378684800,7,274,4.092592592592593
5832424,5,B00DLX761E,"This DVD will make you work - it is hard! I love 10 Minute Solution DVD's, and this one is no exception.

In each 10 Min segment, there is a short warm-up, 8 different exercises, and a short cool down. You do each exercise 2x, for 20 secs, with a 10 sec recovery in between - think tabata. You don't need any weights or bands, just your body weight.

One of the things I really liked about this DVD is the instructor gives a modification for almost every exercise. There were just a few somewhere in the middle where I noticed that she didn't. She usually showed you the advanced exercise, then showed the modification, then went back to the advanced. I thought that was very good, because a couple of times, I thought, ""I can't do that!"" Right at that moment, she showed a modification. That helped keep me going. I think the more you do the DVD, the better you will know the exercises and their modifications, so you won't lose that couple of secs thinking, ""Yikes!"" Also, there were a lot of exercises that I wasn't familiar with. I haven't done a lot of HIIT, though, so they might be pretty common if you're used to doing this kind of exercise. (My background is gym classes, strength training, 10 Minute Solution, The Firm Express, Lindsay Brin's Post Natal Boot Camp, Turbo Jam, and running) But as a HIIT newbie, it seemed like a lot more variety than I'm used to. There were a lot of plank-based moves - push-ups, walking planks, one-legged burpees (except for me - I did the regular burpee lol). This was nice because I think a lot of my other DVDs don't do planks enough. Sometimes I have to move around my living room some to find a good place for side to side work, but I've never had to face away from the TV before.

I like the production of the 10 Minute Solution DVDs. She is on a big mat, and the background is home/gym like. Very neat. 10 Min Solution updated their menu for this DVD as well.

One small thing that irked me was that at the end of each 10 minute segment, she gives an air-high-5. I didn't really like that, but it's one of those things you learn to look over if you like the rest of the workout. I try to use the time in between each segment to get a drink of water, so I'm not always looking when she does it anyway. Another thing I noticed is that I needed to use more space than I'm used to using in my living for this DVD. Sometimes I had to turn sideways instead of facing the TV.",1378252800,68,2420,4.231601731601732
5832435,5,B00DLX761E,Have been using this for over 2 years!  Love it!,1495670400,,48,3.8
5832436,3,B00DLX761E,"As someone who works at all the time, this totally caught me off guard. They first time I did it, I felt like I had never worked out a day in my life; I was ready to collapse after the 52 minutes. It is quick passed, no breaks even between the the individual 10 minute routines--which I like. After doing this every other day for two weeks, I feel as capable as I do with Tae Bo.

BUT--I did have to end up modifying or completely changing some of the moves. I am not coordinated at all, and about 1/3 of the moves are burpee variations. I can't even do a regular burpee, and then she has you doing them one legged, and surfer, and so many others. Then another quarter of the program is plank routines--which I like, except she has you doing one routine after the other, which can cause a lot of stress on your shoulders. I think it would have been better if she did one plank, then a different type of move, then another plank, alternating them so my shoulders could recover.",1492300800,3,976,4.219251336898396

5832442,5,B00DLX761E,This is a great HIIT dvd. I love that the 10 minutes in each section flys by. It does have some high impact moves and alot of different plank styles and burpees. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with bad knees or wrists. But I do recommend it to everyone else. I did the whole dvd at once. Definitely will make you sweat.

5832444,5,B00DLX761E,"I usually hate exercise videos, but I've been in a huge rut lately with my workouts so rented this title. Ended up buying after the first video! I love Lisa's approach, not too chatty but encouraging when needed. The sets aren't always intuitive but she does a good job of explaining and its easy to get the hang of after a while. These are great to stack or to do just for a quick squeeze in work out. Even the 101 isn't really for people starting at zero, but after plateauing from a couple months of cardio conditioning, this was a great revamp. After a week of two days on/one off I've already noticed an increase in stamina and strength. Really great work out and is perfect with my other lifestyle tweaks for greater overall health. Would certainly look into other videos that Lisa Kinder leads!",1475452800,2,801,4.493150684931507

5832457,5,B00DLX761E,"Finally a HIIT workout with simple moves and zero frustration.  I have read up on the research of HIIT training and was eagerly hoping to add it to my fitness routine 2-3 times per week for the added health benefits. However, each HIIT workout up until this one has been dance-y, required equipment, without modifications, and frankly seemed like an injury waiting to happen.  In my opinion, if I can't pop in the DVD and follow it the first time thru, it's a waste of money.  I have no patience for choreography or bone-jarring, muscle-tearing, and/or haphazard movements done too quickly without proper instruction or technique.  The instructor, Lisa Kinder, has a BA in Kinesiology and is also a certified trainer.  She is deliberate, pleasant, not too peppy, without the boot-camp mindset.  The production quality is high, the workouts are programmable, and I felt like 2 sessions provided me the HIIT trifecta: intensity, strength, and cardio.

This DVD is programmable to each fitness type.  I found myself able to do about 50% of the non-modified moves, but for the others I simply followed the modification that Lisa provides. Not only did I feel like I got a great workout, I feel like it's a workout I could do a few times a week without the fear of injury!  About me: I am a 43-year-old RN with wobbly knees, I have been doing Leslie Sansone for the past 2 years (and lost ~60 lbs), having arrived at my target weight, I am looking to strengthen, tone, and maintain.  My plan will be to use this DVD 2 - 3x week on days I'm not walking with Leslie!",1473379200,24,1559,4.615942028985507

5832459,5,B00DLX761E,I like HIIT workouts and this one didn't let me down. I have a few of the 10 minute solutions tape and this one is in my rotation now. I do it 4 times a week and usually 3 10 minute workouts each but if I only get one in I don't feel like I didn't work out. After 3 I am dripping sweat. The lower body one had me sore for 2 days the first time I did it so it was great to switch up new muscles I had obviously been lacking on with other workouts. I can't say enough good things about this one.,1472688000,6,493,3.616822429906542
5832460,5,B00DLX761E,"Quick, effective workout, 10 minute segments can be strung together to make a longer workout or you can pick and choose what you want to do that day.

5832464,5,B00DLX761E,I really liked this DVD.  The workouts are simple but effective.  I also like how you can customize the different workouts.,1466467200,,123,4.809523809523809
5832475,5,B00DLX761E,"My favorite 10 minute solution.  I've learned something when it comes to doing short workouts like this.  The workout needs to be simple.  if it focuses on cardio, abs, body weight exercises and so forth it tends to be a good workout.  However, the more equipment and more complicated it is, the more schizophrenic and confusing it can be.  Fitting full body workouts into a 10 minute period, or over several 10 minute periods IS VERY HARD TO DO. The exercises in this dvd are simple, but jack your heart rate up and make you sweat.  I work as a nurse doing 12 hour shifts and it can be hard to fit workouts in between shifts.  This gem has become my go to for when I need to workout but just don't have the time.  And I never leave feeling frustrated or like I didn't get a quality workout it (unlike all the other 10 minute solution DVD's).  Get this DVD!",1465516800,5,857,4.273291925465839

Workouts would have been made much, much better if the next exercise were cued before she actually counts down to them. It would be nice to know a few seconds ahead what position to get into.

I love Tabata format (20 sec. hit it HARD; 10 sec. recovery) and plyo (she does give modifications).  I'm giving it 4 out of 5 because of poor cueing not because of the workout itself which is a 5 out of 5. During the 10 sec. recovery she should be explaining the next exercise; instead, she waits for the countdown and then at the start of the 20 sec. she explains the move when you should already be doing the exercise.  I'm sure after a few times through, I'll know what's coming and this won't be a problem, but 10 Minute Solution should have caught & corrected this.  Her personality is fine - just poor cueing.

Its not as hard as some of my other HIIT DVDs so I just feel like I'm cheating by doing it and not one of the others. I think many who are new to HIIT will get benefit from it, however. My other kvetch is that there are too many weight-bearing exercises on the wrists in this video. Younger exercisers might not notice this but this video irritates my wrists and I felt that a little more creativity could have been in order. Lastly, and admittedly a bit of a nitpick: The instructor tells you to breathe after each exercise and then models the breath you should be doing. I find it incredibly annoying. #1 if you are working as hard as you should be doing HIIT no one needs to remind you to breathe. You're gonna be sucking wind regardless. #2 If a reminder is necessary, intersperse it in a few places through the workout, not after every exercise. #3 Don't model how to take a deep breath, I'll get the dang air in how it feels best for me, thank you very much. Like I said, it's nitpicking but if a workout video hits a pet peeve, one isn't likely to put it into the regular rotation. All that aside, this video goes into my secondary rotation; I use it when I need a change up. Cathe Friedrich's HIIT DVD is excellent, imho, if you want to explore other options.",1416528000,5,1380,4.250950570342205

Bad news.  The dvd is defective.  I ordered two, and they are both defective.  Although there is a ""link"" to each workout, they don't connect.  I sent the company an email and they did not respond.  So.......if you want to start with the first program you are all set to go, but if you want any other one, you have to fast forward, and if you think about it is it counter to the intent of the video because if it takes about 12 minutes to get to the last workout you may as well be working out to a 22 minutes of another video and get more bang for your 7 bucks and 25 minutes.

Also, I did not think of it, but another reviewer pointed out that  the next exercise should be demonstrated during the 10 second rest.  This is so basic.

My biggest complaint is that many of the exercises are the same (e.g. lots of plank). They aren't even really working different muscles while in the same position much of the time. I didn't feel like we were even really isolating any muscles in the different arm/leg/abs sets but it was instead just a full body workout. There were even a couple of times where she repeated a move from one 10 minute set to the next.

In a short amount of time you can get an effective workout that combines both cardio and strength training elements.  This dvd is intermediate to advanced and would be very hard for beginners IMO.  That is actually a good thing as I think there is a dearth of these types of workouts yet a plethora of beginner dvds in every genre.

This dvd is made up of 5 10 minute segments each focusing on different parts of the body.  You can customize a workout with your choice of segments or do them all back to back.  I like to pick three for a 30m intense workout then do 30-45m of Yoga afterwards.  Doing the full 50 minute dvd will kick your butt!  In a good way!!

The instructor is encouraging, the instructions are explained succinctly and are easy to follow, and I like that she has healthy real looking body not some Hollywood fake celebrity plastic nonsense.

It doesn't have a section which breaks down each of the moves you're asked to do, like my Beach Body DVDs, but on the plus side, the moves aren't too difficult to pick up and the instructor goes slow enough to ease you into it. Still, beginners may be overwhelmed the first few times unless you have a dance/sports background. (Many of the moves I recognized from athletic training.) Also, you'll need to have a lot of available floor space (your size, height and width, times three) in order to properly execute some of the moves--at least to get the most benefit.

Nice sneak attack.  Suprisingly good burn in ten minutes.

Each of the segments has its merits. If you are familiar with 10 Minute Solutions you know you can mix and match different segments to customize a workout or just do one.

This is great if I wake up too late in the morning for a full workout but still want to squeeze something in before a shower. My husband did a few of these workouts with me and was also sweating and felt like he got a good workout. The instructor is likable enough.

5832582,4,B00DLX761E,"Many times, when I review workout DVDs, one of my main complaints is that it could be just a little bit tougher for the viewer, but you won't see me say that one time when talking about this workout video!  ""10 Minute Solution: High Intensity Interval Training"" lives up to its name, and will definitely be a challenge for all people who pick it up.

Like all 10 Minute Solution DVDs, this video is divided into 5 10-minute segments, each focusing on a different area under the umbrella of ""high intensity training.""  You can choose to do just 1 workout, all 5 together, or you can mix and match the workouts due to your personal preference.

In this workout, each segment is divided into eight moves.  You do a move for 20 seconds, take a 10 second recovery, do the same movement again for 20 seconds, and then you finish with another 10 second recovery before moving onto the next exercise.

I will individually break down each section of this DVD:

HIIT 101 - The title may make this segment seem like it's an introduction to HIIT, but it's really not; it's just more of a general workout.  It's a very cardio segment and is very challenging to finish without breathing and sweating heavily.  Moves included are as follows: lateral jumps, frog jumps, ski planks, bridge kicks, bear crawls, corner jumps, planks with jumps.  Again, it's a very high intensity workout with a lot of jumping movements.

UPPER BODY HIIT - While not as hard as some of the other sections, Upper Body HIIT will still work on whittling your upper body into shape without the use of hand weights.  The exercises all use only your body weight and focus much on your shoulders.  The moves include the following: walk out to push up, pendulums in plank, tricep bends, tippedy frogs, walking planks with mountain climbers, downward facing dog slaps, traveling push ups, and moving side planks.

HIIT EXPLOSION - This section focuses on plyometric cardio exercises, but at the end, I absolutely felt it in my legs, too.  The moves include: high/low knees, jump forward and shuffle back, single leg burpees on right leg, single leg burpees on left leg, fast feet with knee tuck, jumps squats, suicides, and donkey kicks.  I definitely found this segment to be the most challenging of all.

ROCK BOTTOM HIT - Like the Upper Body HIIT, this was one of the less difficult workouts on the DVD, but that's shouldn't be much of a comfort; my legs were still on fire at the end.  Exercises in the segment are as follows: lateral jumps, squat jump pendulum, low lunge jump right, low lunge jump left, alternating bridge kicks, jump squats, squat kicks, and surfer burpees.

AB HIIT - Ab HIIT may focus on your abs, but it's a total body workout for sure.  I found it worked my shoulders and legs even more than their respective 10-minute segments did, and I love that this section offers such a full body challenge.  The ab exercises are: high knee twists, reptiles, reverse crunches, ski abs, ab hammers (basically sit ups), knee rotations in plank, bear tucks in plank, and plank punch.  As you can see, much of the time is spent in plank, and because of this, I didn't get as much of a cardio workout as I did with the other segments.

Finally, let's talk about the instructor, Lisa Kinder.  She seems to be extremely passionate and motivated about what she does for a living, but occasionally it's a bit over the top.  She is CONSTANTLY screaming that she understands your pain and is feeling the same burn as you.  While it's somewhat reassuring the first time, by the eighth time, I was sick of her saying the same thing to me.  Also, she doesn't explain the moves very well.  She basically just tells you the name of the move then expects you to jump right in with you; you really have to watch her do the move first before you can even attempt it.  Plus, she doesn't explain technique at all, so a beginner exerciser may become completely lost in what she's doing and get injured.

Overall, the DVD is definitely focused to the advanced exerciser, and I love how challenging it is.  It might be a bit daunting for a beginner to fitness or HIIT, just because explanations are nonexistent, but I think it's still worth the initial struggle.  I have no doubt that this DVD will get me into great shape, and I highly recommend it to people looking for a high intensity athletic workout!",1387324800,2,4354,4.592496765847348
5832583,5,B00DLX761E,"I am a 40 year old Mom who usually prefers working out with yoga or a walking DVD.  I haven't tried High Intensity Interval Training before.  I've watched my teenage daughters do it and knew I wasn't really ready for it.  They're big fans of Jillian Michaels and her HIIT workouts, though.

First, I love that I can design my workout each time I use it.  I can do one, two, three ... I can mix them up in different orders.  Second, I like the studio that this is filmed in.  Third, I like the instructor.  Lisa Kinder demonstrates every movement and counts you through them.  She does keep talking, but not in an annoying way.

I already said I'm 40 and haven't done any HIIT workouts before, so the first few times I used this I could only do one ten minute segment.  I'm going to have to work up to longer workouts.  The work-outs are hard for a beginner. For those who are accustomed to HIIT this DVD can still provide a fast workout that is effective, even if it's not the hardest thing they've ever done.

I struggled with being able to do the movements correctly at first.  I realized I need to watch her do one or two of them before I join in the first time through, otherwise I realize after a bit that I'm doing it wrong.  I can't look up and see her for the movements that begin in plank position.  This gets easier with future workouts, or you can choose to watch a segment once before actually attempting to do it.  Lisa does provide alternate motions for beginners but those felt too easy for me.  I tried to do the exercises correctly, only falling back to the simplified motion when I just couldn't do the real ones any longer.

For a beginner needing to get in shape, this is a great workout, really pushing your core strength and well as your cardio.  I have a long way to go, but I am looking forward to being able to do 3 of these 10 minute segments in a row, instead of feeling like jelly after just one segment.",1386979200,,1932,4.241095890410959
5832584,5,B00DLX761E,"When you're busy, it's hard to find time to hit the gym.  Heck, even at home it's had to clear half an hour to do yoga with an app or DVD instructor.  But no matter how hard my laziness tries to get the better of me, there's simply no way that I can claim that I can't find ten minutes a day to do a quick workout.**

Each ten minute segment has eight exercises.  Each is performed twice at a duration of twenty seconds each.  It may not sound like much, but if you're a weakling like me who has been dodging regular exercise for years, you'll still find yourself sweating through some of the tougher, plank-based exercises.  The instructor offers modifications for each move so if you have injuries or limitations, it's still possible to make it through your ten minutes.

I found that ten minute segments work much better with my daily routines.  Squeezing in an extra ten minutes before my morning shower and ten minutes in the evening after watching the latest episode of Sleepy Hollow or Grimm was much easier than trying to put aside a larger block of time.  I'll be looking to purchase some of the other exercise DVDs in this series in the near future!

There are some new moves and interesting combinations that I have not seen before.  There is almost no warmup for each section.  There are active combinations with 10 sec recovery between spurts (this is interval training).  Some modifications of exercises are given.  Most of the exercises are high impact.  Instructor Lisa Kinder is by herself on the set and gives decent but minimal instruction.  She does try to motivate the watcher, but it seems insincere to me.

The most irritating part of the DVD is the repetitive techno music.  The timing of the exercises also seems ""off"" with the music a lot of the time.

While this DVD is okay, I did not really connect with the instructor and it did not seem fun or motivating to me.  I doubt this will be a part of my regular workout rotation.  I recommend any of Jillian Michael's DVDs for great workouts and motivation (tough but gets results).",1386806400,,1039,4.612021857923497
5832587,4,B00DLX761E,"The routines here definitely get the blood running.  I really like the approach of a brief high-intensity session, and recently I've seen studies that show how HIIT can be very helpful for weight loss.  I fine the tone and style of the production is just right for routines of this sort.

Of the five routines, one is an intro to HIIT, three concentrate on parts of the body (core, upper, lower), and then there is the HIIT Explosion. I appreciate the ability to work on different areas of the body in different sessions.

The one thing that wasn't so good was ""Create Your Own Custom Workout"", which simply lets you assemble which of the five routines you want to do into a single program.  This is easy enough to do on the fly by going back to the contents, so isn't that big of a deal.  (I thought it was going to let me assemble a bunch of individual exercises into a custom routine.)  Also, the instruction screen about how to do this was barely legible on my (older) tv, but it wasn't hard to figure out how to do it anyway.

Also some supplementary materials would be nice, so once I'm used to the routines, I could just use a booklet instead of having to fire up the tv and use the dvd player.",1386633600,,1201,4.306666666666667
5832588,4,B00DLX761E,"Got 10 minutes to spare and want to use it to get the most out of it getting in a quick workout? 10 Minute Solution: High Intensity Interval Training is worth considering. The moves are powerful, not hard to learn (but maybe harder to do if your body strength is limited), and Instructor Lisa Kinder is fun to follow.

This is not a dancy dance aerobic training fitness video, this is down and dirty power moves that utilize your own body weight to get your heart rate pumping and your muscles begging for mercy. We're talking Calisthenics: squats, crawls, jumping squares, jacks, push ups, etc. You can even see the effects on Lisa as she is sweating a bunch and feeling the burn along with you. For moves that may be too difficult/advance for your fitness level, Lisa shows a modified version that is more doable, but it won't make it burn any less.

For the price, this is a DVD worth giving a shot. Ten minutes of hell (and probably an hour's worth of recovery depending on your fitness level, a day or two of sore muscles, etc.) is small price to pay that may reap some big rewards down the road for a healthier, fitter body.",1386288000,,1130,4.427884615384615
5832589,5,B00DLX761E,"Get ready to lose some weight and inches with this HIGH intensity exercise video! I can tell you it works but there were those days I thought I was going to die (or maybe wished would be a better choice of words) when I first started. Mind you, I'm not in great shape and middle age has made me more sedentary that I've even admitted to myself, so I was in for a surprise when I thought I could just pick up and jump in, especially since the workout was only 10 minutes. Well, it wasn't pretty, but I made it, and have certainly improved with using the video. I've lost over 2"" around the waist and am very pleased with the results.

The video does not require any additional exercise equipment, so you are ready to go when you put your DVD in. The instructor gives instructions on how to do the exercise, an easier option and then leads you through the exercise, gives a short cool down and then on to the next. Some of the exercises take place on the floor, so there is some up and down going on during those 10 minutes. I'm not going to tell you it's easy, because it can get brutal, but there are great results from it. Can't do all the exercises? Just improvise and try to keep up. Don't give up as you'll soon be able to do these along with the instructor. One of the great benefits I've found is just to keep moving. I couldn't do it all in the beginning, but now, I'm keeping up.

This is a great workout video!

Please note that the over 2"" around the waist I lost was not only from using the video but was also in conjunction with a diet.",1386028800,,1548,4.136212624584718
5832590,5,B00DLX761E,"This workout video contains five 10-minute segments. The intensity of the workouts, and accordingly, the benefits you reap from them will depend on your level of fitness:

Level 1: You live a sedentary lifestyle.
>> Consult your doctor before your attempt this workout video, or proceed cautiously, doing the exercises in only 1-minute doses. Gradually increase the length of your workouts as your cardiovascular fitness improves in the course of weeks (or months).

Level 2: You are not completely sedentary. You like using the stairs instead of taking the elevator. You're often out and about (on your feet) running errands and answering life's incessant demands.
>> The workouts in this video will be extremely strenuous. They WILL get your heart pumping! A full 10-minute segment is doable, but that's stretching it. Proceed cautiously.

Level 3:  You're active. You do the recommended ""10-minute cardio 3 times a week"" or similar routine.
>> This video is perfect for you! The exercises will be challenging but you will be able to complete a full 10-minute segment! Be forewarned that you may get achy and sore muscles the next day.

Level 4: You're very active. You run at least 20 miles a week and/or hike and/or participate in sports that are at least moderately strenuous.
>> The workouts in this video are very helpful for incorporating in your workout regime! The exercises will only be somewhat challenging, but they will definitely help you improve your cardiovascular fitness.

Level 5: You're extremely fit and active. You bike 175 miles and/or run 40+ miles a week.
>> The workout in this video will be quite easy. They will probably just help you MAINTAIN, not improve on your cardiovascular fitness.

The exercises will work out your different muscle groups. No weights or other equipment (other than perhaps an exercise mat) is necessary. If your level of fitness falls between level 3 and 4, I would highly recommend this video. Personally, I'm at level 4.

I can see what other reviewers are saying as far as it not focusing on disguising the workout as dance or fun as much as some other work out products do, but to me getting straight to the point is much more valuable.

I have read quite a bit frequently about the benefits of incorporating high intensity interval training into your work out, so this worked great for me.  It gets your heart rate up quickly, you do a variety of different moves during the 10 minutes so you get different muscles working.

5832592,4,B00DLX761E,"Having done my share of exercise DVDs and VHS tapes (remember those?) over the years, and having become a loyal disciple of Insanity, I decided I would give ""10 Minute Solution:  High Intensity Interval Training"" a shot.  The DVD features five ten-minute exercise routines.  Each routine focuses either on a specific body part or a specific type of exercises.

Here's a breakdown of what each routine covers:  HIIT 101-an introduction to HIIT exercises, AB HIIT-focuses on the ""core,"" UPPER BODY HIIT-strength training minus the weights for the upper body, HIIT EXPLOSION-uses plyometric training to give the entire body a good workout, ROCK BOTTOM HIIT-focuses on the lower portion of the body, from toe to tush.

What makes this DVD somewhat unique it the ability for the user to either do single routines or multiple routines in any combination you can dream up.  For example, if you have thirty minutes to workout, you can select HIIT 101, UPPER BODY HIIT, and ROCK BOTTOM HIIT and put them in the order you wish to do them.  All three will play in the order that you choose and you don't have to stop to skip ahead to the specific routine.  Only got ten minutes?  No problem.  Just select one of the routines and do it.

I've been utilizing these routines individually after my daily Insanity routine.  I'll pop in this DVD and go through one ten minute routine to top off my workout.

If you're familiar with Insanity, many of the exercises on this disc will be familiar.  Each routine features one minute of warmup, one minute of cool down, and eight minutes of exercise.  Each exercise is broken into a twenty second work/ten second rest/twenty second work/ten second rest set.

These routines are not easy, but do include modified exercises for most of the moves in each set.  The instructor, Lisa Kinder, is sufficient.  There are no other people in the video with her.  It's just a one on one routine.  Her enthusiasm comes across as plastic at times, but her instruction is clear and easy to understand.

A decent DVD to add to your workout collection, ""10 Minute Solution:  High Intensity Interval Training"" is worth a shot.",1385683200,,2137,4.778688524590164

Well, it is - the instructor is not the same one, but she is still clear and capable, and it is still the same format of five 10-minute workouts that can be combined or done separately.

Now, I have to confess - I knew what interval training is, and expected this to be like that.  I had NOT encountered HIIT before in any form and did not realize what a big step up it was from regular interval training!  The first time I tried it, I really banged up my old knees with all that getting up & down, and a lot of the exercises I could not do AT ALL :-(  This is not a workout for the beginner or someone with issues with impact!

That said, it was a good workout - my teenage daughter, who takes martial arts three times a week and dances all weekend, also tried it and pronounced it 'Great!'  SO there you go - if you are young and fit, this is a lot of fun!",1385424000,,974,3.9896907216494846

Unlike a couple of reviews, I didn't notice any resemblance to Jillian who I find to be fairly annoying.  I do think Lisa's cueing is less than ideal.  Because you only have 20 seconds, if you spend 5 of it watching her to see what she's going to do, you lose out on getting as much of a workout.  Sometimes she shows you the exercise before she starts and sometimes she doesn't.  I'm sure as I do it more and get familiar with the moves this will be less of an issue.

But when I tried the upper body workout, it was a disaster.  I didn't have time to change from (say) pushups to the jumping squat things in time; I couldn't do my jumping squat things as quickly as she did, so I only got about four done in the time it took her to do 10.

This DVD is no different, but I did take a star away because I wished it was a bit more intense or offered a more difficult routine with longer intervals. Previously I did a 60/10 system (one minute exercise, ten seconds rest) and really enjoyed that, but this was a nice change of pace.

The exercises require a lot full body movement, so if you're weak in any one particular area you'll soon be aware of it! I love that I can do what feels like a killer workout in under 30 minutes. I'm exhausted, sweaty, and tired when I'm done and that is exactly what I want out of an exercise DVD.

I love to push my workouts until I'm at my limit and try to do better, faster, more reps than I did the last time. This is why high intensity works so well for some folks and not so great for others.

The instructor makes these workouts look easy- they're not!  The moves themselves are simple.  In fact, you might think ""pfffft, how hard can this be?"" if you watch the video once through before actually doing the workout (and you should, just to get your bearings!)

The reason I give this video 4 stars instead of 5 is that there's a LOT of plyo and jumping.  That's not my favorite, and I ended up modifying some of the moves.

Unusually, this one did deliver on the HIIT promise and gave me a very good workout.  Instructor was ok, rather reminded me of Jilian Michaels a bit.

Cons:  Most of the moves ended up as modified burpees/pushups.  Somehow or other, I was on all fours half the time.  If you like this or do not mind, that works great.  For myself, I prefer to only do a few of those and stay on my feet most of the time for cardio.  Also, one segment included a move where you get on your knees/stand up, get on your knees/stand up.

In this DVD, certified fitness instructor Lisa Kinder utilizes the HIIT style of training:  each of the five workouts offers just eight moves, with Kinder performing the exercise for 20 seconds, resting for 10 seconds, repeating the move a second time, resting again, and then continuing on to the next exercise.  Not only is this program ""high intensity,"" but many of the moves are high impact as well.  In addition, there are numerous plank-based exercises throughout the workouts.  For most exercises, Kinder shows lower intensity modifications.

HIIT 101

In this first workout, Kinder introduces a range of HIIT moves, with a significant amount of going from standing to down to the floor.  The eight exercises here are as follows:  1) lateral hops, 2) frog jumps, 3) low skier plank, 4) kicking crab, 5) bear crawls, 6) four corner hop, 7) jump over plank (hopping from side to side), 8) knee tuck (moving from kneeling to a jump).  Kinder concludes with a quick stretch.

UPPER BODY HIIT

Here Kinder warms up with some chest hugs (arm swings).  Many of the exercises in this section are floor-based plank moves.  This is the sequence:  1) walk out to push-up, 2) body pendulum (plank with leg swings), 3) triceps dip with alternating leg kicks, 4) tipping frogs, 5) walking plank, 6) down dog with calf slap, 7) travelling push-ups, 8) rotational plank.  I found that these moves were not sufficient to keep my heart rate elevated.

HIIT EXPLOSION

This segment contains more plyometric moves.  Kinder warms up briefly with jumping jacks and then goes into the following eight exercisers:  1)  high/low jogs, 2) double jump/shuffle, 3) single leg Burpee (performed twice), 4) single leg Burpee (second leg), 5) fast feet/knee tuck, 6) squat jack touch, 7) ""suicide"" shuffle touch, 8) donkey kick with ""hot feet"" (half handstand position).  Again, there are quick stretches to finish.

ROCK BOTTOM HIIT

Kinder starts this routine with small squats for the warm-up.  She then moves into a lower body focused series that includes plyometric moves.  Here are the exercises:  1) skater jumps, 2) squat jumps with pendulum, 3) low lunge to hop (performed twice), 4) low lunge to hop (second leg), 5) alternating bridge kicks, 6) low single jacks, 7) squat with turbo kick, 8) side Burpee.  Kinder briefly stretches the hamstrings to finish.

AB HIIT

To warm up, Kinder starts with torso rotations.  As with the upper body section, this segment includes many plank exercise on the floor--and, similar to the previous section, I had difficulties keeping my heart rate up with these moves.  The eight exercises are as follows:  1) high knee pull, 2) reptiles (plank with knee tuck), 3) reverse crunch, 4) ski abs (virtually the same as the ""jump over plank"" from the first workout), 5) hammer crunch, 6) plank rotations, 7) plank air tucks (dropping hips side to side), 8) plank punches.  Another brief stretch concludes the workout.

I enjoy plyometric work and was looking forward to trying plyos within 10 Minute Solution's patented format.  Unfortunately, I found the routines on this DVD to be disappointing.  First, the small amount of plyo moves was well outweighed by the overwhelming number of plank-based exercises.  Not only did I find that my heart rate dropped significantly when executing the plank work, but also I simply did not like constantly going down to the floor and getting back up again.  (These moves would also make the workouts contraindicated for those with wrist issues and/or very low blood pressure.)  I did enjoy the HIIT EXPLOSION and ROCK BOTTOM HIIT routines; had the entire DVD been similar to these segments, I would have recommended it more highly.

In the end, this DVD may hold appeal for young, healthy, experienced exercisers (i.e., those similar to the instructor) who are time-crunched yet still wanting to shake up their fitness routine, but my personal rating is 3 1/2 stars.",1380585600,43,4089,4.963181148748159
8594366,3,B00DLX761E,"This workout requires lots of plank type exercises, one after the other, which is stressful on the shoulders. Also, the routines shift very quickly from standing exercises to mat exercises, and back again. It was difficult to follow along when I had to keep getting up and down. Lisa does not explain the exercises or tell you which one is coming next. There are no warm up or cool down sessions.",1525305600,,396,4.591549295774648
8594367,5,B00DLX761E,"Love this workout DVD! I have done a lot of exercise routines over the years, and this has by far been the most effective! Please be sure you understand the goals of HIIT. It is short duration (as little as 4 minutes total) and high intensity. You want to push as hard as you can, get out of breath, and even reach muscle failure at times. It does not follow the old rules of pacing yourself to not overdo. It's a very good thing when you get winded, rest a little, then do it again, because this is what burns the fat over the next 24-48 hours. This workout helped me finally lose the most stubborn fat in my trouble spots! Finally! Highly worth it and done so quickly, just 10 minutes 3 times a week. Lisa does such a fantastic job. She is stronger and more physically fit than I am, but even at my skill level, her routines really work!",1518134400,,839,4.185185185185185
8594368,4,B00DLX761E,"Good workout, really gets heart going. But takes a few times to get the moves. Instructor very perky but doesn't explain move changes well. Worth purchasing.",1516147200,,157,5.076923076923077
8594369,3,B00DLX761E,"The workouts are good, definitely get the heart pumping, but the instructor isn't for me, if I could mute her I would. And the striped socks, ugh! I'll be selling in a yard sale.",1515369600,,178,4.264705882352941
8594370,2,B00DLX761E,She jumps right into each exercise without explaining what the exercise is or how to do it. So you miss part of the interval trying to figure out what is going on. Definitely high impact and challenging exercises.,1507420800,,213,4.631578947368421
8594371,5,B00DLX761E,"This DVD is NO JOKE! I got an amazing workout. This is not for beginners, unless you are willing to accept the fact that you might not be able to complete 10 whole minutes at first. I had to pause mine half way thru and I work out 5 days a week lol.",1504915200,,249,3.7169811320754715
8594372,5,B00DLX761E,"good 1st time HIIT video. I am new to HIIT but not to exercise. u build up a sweat doing the whole dvd, not sure how good of a work out it would be doing just some of it. brought the irish cheeks out in me",1502064000,,205,3.4782608695652173
8594373,1,B00DLX761E,"Reviews were so good but I hate this one and I have loads of 10 minute dvds.  Jarring electronic music, an uninspiring instructor and a lot of up and down to and from the floor which I didn't enjoy.  I'm 63, in pretty good shape and thought it would be more of a Zumba like, high cardio dance dvd.",1500940800,2,297,4.016949152542373
8594374,4,B00DLX761E,I'm pretty active and I wanted to add in some new workouts to my routine. This delivered some sweat for sure! I had to do at least 3 of them to get my heart rate into the high intensity range. So unless you are starting from a beginner level I wouldn't expect miracles from just doing one of the workouts. There are a lot of plank type moves so I would keep that in mind if you have any issues with your shoulders.,1497052800,2,414,4.0
8594375,5,B00DLX761E,Love it! Is breathtaking and hard enough to sweat like you where in te desert.,1496620800,,78,4.266666666666667
