2768847,1,B000NHG82E,"Unless you have a non-standard US Region DVD player this DVD is an excellent coaster.  But you won't be able to play it.  There was no clue about this on the web, and I feel robbed.",1376092800,2,181,4.0
2768848,5,B000NHG82E,"I bought this DVD for one reason only, not knowing anything about the film: Victor Lanoux. In his 60's and 70's he made a series of TV-films as Louis Roman, an antique dealer. I love the series and especially Lanoux's presence in them. It's hard to name anyone else who creates such an atmosphere of warmth, happiness and kindness without losing his mature masculinity. He also is the moral and intellectual spine in the series. So I wanted to see him in something else. There's very little material besides ""Louis la brocante"" -series and this was the only one with English subtitles. I listen to French but not perfectly, so subtitles help.

In ""Cousin, cousine"" Lanoux still has black hair and no moustache and he looks a bit odd. The cover of the DVD didn't seem that appealing to me and the sentence ""two couples one affair"" made me think: ""One of these stories again"", so I didn't expect much. I was very happily surprised. I just loved these people - all of the actors and the way they were handled in this film. To me they all seemed sympathetic and comedy was quite gentle. The main couple, Lanoux and Barrault are just adorable and so is their friendship. They seem so at ease with each other, accepting and happy and open.

The story made me think, that it has been a distant inspiration to ""Four weddings and a funeral"". It begins at a wedding, where two extended families meet and become cousins. Ludovic and Marthe (Lanoux and Barrault) find themselves waiting for their spouses, when everyone else has gone. They talk, like each other's company and very calmly accept the silly explanation, why their spouses had disappeared in the middle of the wedding together. Later Ludovic wants to see Marthe, because he has found a letter his wife has written to Marthe's husband. They burn it without reading and have a long happy lunch eating cakes. A friendship is born and in time they talk about going to bed. ""Then we'd have to become liars"", says Marthe and offers two options: they don't go to bed or they go to bed once and never meet again, so they wouldn't have to lie to their spouses. ""Let's not go to bed"", says Ludovic. ""We'll be this amazing couple. People say: look at them, 20 years together and they never went to bed"". (Quotes are as I remember them, not directly as in the movie.)

The extended family meets now and then at another wedding, at a funeral and at Christmas and relationships evolve - to what, I don't wish to tell. Let others be spoilers.

The movie contains some nudity, but it's very tame and there's very little of it. If you think erotic scenes should happen only between people with sixpacks and firm round breasts, this is not for you. If instead you prefer erotica of real people with physical imperfections and lots of love and laughter, you might like this. And I must confess my opinion is heavily coloured by the fact, that I fell in love with Lanoux's Ludovic. He's not handsome but he has that same warm, happy presence as in ""Louis la brocante"" -series. I'm very happy I got this film and will watch it again. There are no extras, but technical quality is good enough for me and subtitles are OK.",1356566400,4,3150,4.550264550264551

I was thrilled to find this at Amazon.com because I have been looking for it on video ever since I saw it in a movie house over three decades ago.

By the way, it was in Region 2 DVD format, which I was able to watch because I purchased (from Amazon) the All-Region DVD player mentioned in an earlier review.",1320883200,4,484,4.438202247191011

8177760,1,B000NHG82E,"I was unable to watch this movie.  The fact that it was a ""European"" release made it imposible to watch it in the United States of America.  I should have looked more carefully, but I still think that fact should be made clear to shoppers.  It is the second time it happens to me.  Can Amazon.com do something to point out the difference?",1504310400,,338,4.317460317460317

8177766,5,B000NHG82E,"There's nothing like a classic, French romantic film!
A man and a woman, cousins by marriage, pay back their cheating spouses by embarking on a Platonic affair, only to fall in love.
The acting by everyone is superb and believable, especially by the leads, who move from friendship to love.
This film is far superior to its American remake in  the late 80's ( ""Cousins"" ).",1428105600,,372,4.636363636363637
