1077865,4,6305793344,"A typical Shaw Brothers winner in both the feel and content of the film.  Straightforward story line and many recognizable characters.  Early fighting is good, but not great.  Frankly, I expected more in the early going.  A monkey master is ployed into a compromising situation, for which he is punished by crippling his hands.  He takes on a student who becomes the new Monkey King and sets out to avenge his master.  Routine master-student training follows.  Film meanders along unimpressivley until final battle with villain.  The final fight is extraordinary and spectacular.  The star's monkey form is flawless and breathtaking.  I wish the film leading up to the fight was as good.  Overall, a good 70s style Shaw Bros flick worth having.",969408000,14,744,5.016393442622951

1078188,5,6305793344,"Shaw Brothers makes me believe I can pull off things that I really can't. I tried fighting with a hand fan once, and let me just say that it is damn hard to look righteous when you're holding a hand fan. I won't even go into when I leapt into a street brawl armed with nothing but the rolled-up latest issue of Good Housekeeping. MAD MONKEY KUNG FU, a 1979 infusion of martial arts virtuosity, leads you to believe that fighting with a fan is manly work, but don't you do it. MAD MONKEY KUNG FU is one of the few films in which the legendary Liu Chia-Liang (a.k.a. Lau Kar-Leung) not only directs but also plays a co-leading role. And this time out, the master has chosen to demonstrate his Monkey Fist skills.

He and the gorgeous Kara Hui play a traveling brother-and-sister wushu stage act who falls afoul of the local kingpin Tuan (Lo Lieh). The crime lord covets the beautiful sister and so hatches a plot which frames Master Chen (Liu Chia-Liang) for an act of sexual misconduct. As punishment, Master Chen's hands are brutally bludgeoned and his sister whisked away to become the crime lord's mistress.

We catch up to our down-and-out protagonist five years later, and it's been dark times for the Monkey Fist expert. Chen is eking out a lean living by street performing with a trained monkey. And now he's got the local thugs to deal with, shaking him down, bullying him. And since his mangled hands won't allow him to practice kung fu, Chen pretty much just absorbs the abuse. Our second lead character comes in around this juncture, the orphaned street scamp Little Monkey (Hsiao Hou) who befriends the crippled street performer. Are you at all startled that Chen takes the mischievous Little Monkey under his wing, eventually begins to teach him the Monkey Fist technique?

The story itself is pretty formulaic, maybe darker in content by a smidge. It seethes with its revenge theme, yuks it up with its intentionally broad humor. (Can the swishy brothel administrator's jaw mole be any more colossal or hairy?) Except you don't tune in to this one for unsightly moles or the other obvious gags or even for the played-out plotline. Liu Chia-Liang, as ever, deserves mad props for striving to instill authentic martial arts in his films. The training sequences are off-the-chain stuff, and you actually start thinking that you, too, thru due diligence and ungodly hours of practice, can sleep on a length of rope (but you can't). The fight choreography is some of the most dazzling and intricate that I've ever eyeballed. Liu Chia-Liang is himself a martial arts master and he shows off his wares here. But he also allows his co-stars to strut their stuff. Kara Hui shines in one action set piece. But it's Hsiao Hou who makes your jaw drop. I'm not exactly sure why this guy hasn't become a bigger star. He surely has the mad kung fu skills. His fluid acrobatics are astounding and his Monkey style is friggin' awesome. There are two spectacular battles at the brothel in which he will blow your mind, especially his climactic showdown with Tuan, the dirtbag crime lord. When Tuan taunted the cripple's disciple - ""Little Monkey, even if you were the Monkey King himself, you can't escape. Skin him alive!"" - well, that was never gonna end well for the Big Bad. Despite its shortcomings, I must rate MAD MONKEY KUNG FU five out of five stars. The fight scenes are that badass.

This DVD is from the Dragon Dynasty library and, disappointingly, there are no bonus features. Something like this, I would've loved an audio commentary from someone like Hong Kong expert Bey Logan or, heck, even an avid and knowledgeable kung fu fan like RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan.",1318291200,8,3672,4.697204968944099
1078189,5,6305793344,"An excellent Shaw movie with fantastic monkey fighting style.
Fans of old school martial arts movie should pick this up.",1316649600,2,120,5.05
1078190,5,6305793344,"I already owned a copy of this movie but wanted to get the Dragon Dynasty remastered version. I also wanted the mandarin version with subtitles -- anything is better than the English dub. The picture looks great, and the audio is superb, unlike the unauthorised bootleg copies distributed by Red Sun.

Mad Monkey Kung Fu stars Hsiao Hou as little monkey and Lau Kar Leung as Mr. Chan, an opera performer who is falsely accused of raping the wife of a local gangster, an elaborate ruse by Mr. Tuan (played by Lo Lieh) to steal Chan's sister (who is also an opera performer).

Chan's sister agrees to become the lustful Mr. Tuan's concubine in order to save her brother's life, when it is decided that raping a man's wife is punishable with death by drowning. Mr. Tuan agrees, but only if Mr. Chan is crippled so that he is unable to take revenge or have his sister back.

Fast forward five years later, and Mr. Chan (whose life is all but ruined) is a street performer with a monkey show. During a performance, he meets an orphan named Monkey, an athletic boy who is also a petty thief. Monkey becomes enamored with Mr. Chan's show and the two becomes fast friends. But problems ensue when a gang of thugs force Mr. Chan to pay bribes. In fact, the same gang have been terrorizing businesses all over the community. After they finally kill Mr. Chan's pet monkey Ah Mo for failure to pay on time, little Monkey becomes Mr. Chan's sidekick, starring in Mr. Chan's show. But the thugs soon strike again, this time taking all of their earnings. During the confrontation, Monkey learns that Mr. Chan is a master of Monkey Fist, and begs to learn Kung Fu. But Mr. Chan refuses, fearing for little Monkey's life.

Tired of being bullied, Monkey confronts the gang on his own, demanding to meet their boss. But he is badly beaten. He returns to Mr. Chan in a coma. When he awakens, he cries that he is tired of being bullied and humiliated and further begs to learn Kung Fu.

Mr. Chan finally relents, and an awesome series of training sequences begin -- in fact, probably some of the best training sequences in a kung fu movie to date. Soon, Monkey has learned everything about being a Monkey fighter, except its most crucial skill, which is Monkey Fist. But he is eager to take revenge on the thugs who have been terrorising him, and asks to be released from his training early. Mr. Chan agrees, but warns Monkey that there are tougher men than him. Monkey goes out, chest puffed out and takes to the street. He runs into the gang and they try to beat Monkey up, but are instead, badly beaten by Monkey. Monkey forces the thugs to take him to their boss, there, Monkey is beaten by Mr. Tuan - but survives the onslaught when Chan's sister intervenes. Monkey escapes, and in the process learns about the plot against Mr. Chan. He returns to his Sifu, tells him about the scam, and another training sequences begins --- Monkey is taught monkey fist and finishes his lessons. Together, the student and the master goes back to rescue Mr. Chan's sister, a battle culminating into one of the best kung fu fights I've seen.

There's lots of comedy, in fact some of it is downright goofy (there's even a ""yo mama"" joke). But the end fight takes a more serious tone, shifting to an epic kung fu fight between Tuan, Chan and Monkey.

This is a great movie, showcasing the talent of the highly acrobatic Hsiao Hou. Prepared to be dazzled! Lau Kar Leung, who also directed took a back seat, allowing the young actor (in his first leading role) to truly shine. Mad Monkey Kung Fu gets five stars from me and remains my favorite Kung Fu movie to date.

I do wish there was a bonus feature on the DVD, I found that very disappointing but if you dont' care about that, you won't regret buying this DVD.",1313452800,19,3779,4.482558139534884
1078297,4,6305793344,"I love the movie. It is actually, my favorite kung fu movie and Hsiao Hou is my favorite kung fu star. Now, I prefer to watch these movies with sub-titles. The British actor voicing little monkey's character, and the one voicing for Ah Choi's sounded ridiculous and were difficult to understand sometimes because the audio would become very low. This doesn't help because they sound so horribly whiny. I think these bad voice over actors do an injustice to the actors on screen. Should have used American voice over. My copy did not have subtitles.

Despite this, I was still able to enjoy the performances by all...Lau Kar Leung, Hsiao Hou as well as the supporting cast.

The story begins with Chan [Lau Kar Leung] whose hands are crippled by thugs after he is falsely accused of rape... a trick staged by a local gang boss who hopes to claim Chan's sister [Kara Hui] as his concubine. He ultimately succeeds when she sacrifices herself in order to spare her brother's life.

Many years later, Chan is a street merchant with a monkey show. His hands are crippled as a result of the beating given to him after the ""rape"" charge. He is also bullied by local thugs who works for the big boss. He meets an orphan who calls himself little Monkey. Little Monkey takes pity on Chan and befriends him. They become roommates, and ultimately work together after Chan's real monkey is killed by thugs when he refuses to give them the money they want.

Little Monkey looks (check out the haircut) and acts like a real monkey so he fits the show perfectly. But Little Monkey is tired of being shaken down by the thugs and wants to do something about it. He tries to fight them, but is badly beaten. Chan agrees to teach him the Monkey style, and so the epic training sequences begin and for me, that makes the movie. Little Monkey is eager to get back at the thugs, and leaves his training early. He's learned everything about the Monkey style except its most crucial skill, which is HITTING your opponent. He leaves training early, against the wishes of Chan, his sifu. Little Monkey challenges and and humiliates the gang in a hilarious fight. They finally take him to meet their boss, Ah Choi, who is also beaten and humiliated by Monkey. Then finally, the big boss appears and Little Monkey is badly defeated and saved by Chan's sister, who is injured in the fight. He also learns about the trick and the false rape charge.

Little Monkey tells Chan about the trick. Chan agrees that Little Monkey must complete his training first. The results are awesome. They go back to rescue the sister and things happen. I won't spoil the ending but it's pretty cool.

Some of the best, if not THE best, acrobatics in a Kung Fu movie are displayed by Hsiao Hou and that was also very enjoyable for me. Even the smaller gestures, jumps, and flips seem so natural, it's like watching a fish in water.

Mad Monkey Kung Fu is your standard kung fu movie. An underdog learns kung fu to avenge his master. But in the end... so few movie are done as well.",1298160000,,3030,4.538461538461538

The Teacher of the Shaw clan shows his true teaching abilities and the action is nonstop. This is a 7 star movie, but I'm only able to give 5. You will love this DVD as long as you get the remastered version.",1199923200,,518,4.038834951456311
1078300,3,6305793344,"While I'm not a HUGE fan of this movie I am a fan of Hsiao Ho and his performance is worth the price of admission.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie.  If it were just based on the last 20 minutes and the cast it might well be the best kung fu movie ever made.  You have the director, Lau Kar Leung as the protagonist, the lovely Kara Hui as his sister, and Lo Lieh as (surprise!) the bad guy.

Chan (Lau) is a performer with the opera and master of the monkey fist.  When Duan (Lieh) sees Chan's sister, he gets Chan liquored up and after he passes out, he puts him in bed with his (Duan's) wife and gets her to corroborate an accusation of assault.  In an effort to save Chan, his sister agrees to become Duan's concubine.  Chan gets his hands smashed and is then released.

Years go by when Chan meets Little Monkey (Hsiao Ho) and the two become friends, though Chan is still quite melancholy.  Little Monkey eventually learns Chan's monkey fist to defend himself against local thugs, who work for Duan.  When Little Monkey tangles with Duan it is Chan's sister who helps him escape.  Upon learning this, Chan decides it's time to get her back and take his revenge.

This movie has great fight and training scenes but has some rather slow stretches.  It often plays as a comedy yet the story is depressing, and some of the scenes are mean-spirited.  Many of the fights (though well performed) involve more jumping around than striking.  Until the last fight, that is.  The finale is also some of Lo Lieh's most convincing work.  You get to see Hsiao Ho's unbelievable acrobatic display.  The guy does back hand springs so fast he looks like an oscillating fan.

This DVD has the typical flawless, gorgeous picture of remastered Shaw Bros. films.  Though this is far from the best of their productions, it is still a good flick and has enough fantastic moments to make a pleasant addition to any martial arts collection.  It's hard for me to believe that Gordon Liu isn't in this.  Was he too good for it?  Maybe Lo Lieh was sick of fighting him at the end all the time.

1078301,5,6305793344,"... aside from having the same plot as every single martial arts movie ever made.  Veteran director Lau Kar Leung (aka Liu Chia-Liang) was clearly influenced by Jackie Chan's SNAKE IN THE EAGLE'S SHADOW and DRUNKEN MASTER. Both had come out in 1978, and both were directed by Jackie's Peking Opera ""brother,"" the now-legendary Yuen Woo Ping (martial arts director of THE MATRIX, CROUCHING TIGER, KILL BILL, KUNG FU HUSTLE, etc., etc.).  Lau Kar Leung was 43 at the time, and had already directed a classic of the old school, THE 36th CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN (1978), among several films that starred his brother Gordon Liu (Pai Mei of KILL BILL 2).  But still though, he eagerly embraced the new style, and was lucky enough to find a performer who was totally up to the job.  The long training sequences aren't particularly realistic, but they are a terrific showcase for star Hsiao Ho's amazing physical prowess, which is comparable only to Jackie Chan's otherworldly skills at the time.  Along with the last 15 minutes of Sammo Hung's KNOCKABOUT (1979), this is also the best Monkey Fist you'll ever see! (IMHO, of course.)  Inexplicably, Hsiao Ho never headlined another film, but Lau Kar Leung has directed and starred in dozens, and can be seen kicking Sammo Hung's butt in the casino in PEDICAB DRIVER (1989), and Jackie Chan's under the train in DRUNKEN MASTER 2 (1994).",1161043200,,1371,4.837606837606837
