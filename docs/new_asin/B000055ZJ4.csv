Anyway when you watch this you will see a differences in the animation . One it is more fluid . Two it looks more modern for this day and age . Three all except for Shido and Goonie the colorly and features have change on the some of the characters . Well if you want to get technical everything has been changed . Does this take away from it ? No , not really , it`s still an awesome anime.",988588800,6,500,3.7714285714285714
