  stars in it, I did not know anything about the movie. I found it to be
  very enjoyable. Patricia Neal does a superb job and Shelley Winters is
  hard to beat in roles where she can be disagreeable.
  These were two of Hollywoods great actresses!!!!!!!",1189987200,6,315,4.220338983050848
343002,4,6301678141,"I rented this movie after I saw a clip on a talk show with Shelley Winters as a guest, and I was not disappointed. ""An Unremarkable Life"" describes the life of Patricia Neal's character, an old maid who doesn't appear to have done very much, according to her sister, Shelley Winters. Shelley, on the other hand, was a married woman with a home and family. But Shelley's image of herself is shattered when she loses her home and her adult children have no place for her; she is forced to move in with the sister she has always lorded it over. To make matters worse, Patricia has a late-blooming romance with a Japanese gentleman who encourages her to do the one thing she has always wanted to do: take flying lessons. So as one sister's life appears to be on the wane after having had so much, the other picks up with a vengeance.
Shelley Winters plays the bitter old widow excellently. She reminds me so much of a malcontent woman I used to know as a teenager--the characterization rings true. Here was another missed Oscar nomination. View it and you'll know I'm right.",997660800,21,1070,4.520618556701031

7813738,4,6301678141,"I had been wanting this one for years, having seen it advertised as a trailer on several other films.
Patricia Neal and Shelley Winters do a great job - Winters makes me want to come unglued for her small-mindedness and self-centeredness. Great love story, too.",1357257600,,261,4.822222222222222
7813739,5,6301678141,"Love Patricia Neal and Shelly Winters. The story about two sisters - one self sacrificing and the other set in her stubborn old ways. They both learn that they can  - and must change as the world around them does. It's a great lesson for all of us in life. If you are a fan of great movies with great actresses from the past, this one is for you. They do not make them like that anymore.",1354320000,,387,4.025974025974026
7813740,5,6301678141,"Such a wonderful story about the dynamics of relationships.  When one sister wanted to make changes, it profoundly  affected the
life of the second sister.",1352592000,,155,5.16
7813741,4,6301678141,"Frances (Patricia Neal) and Evelyn (Shelley Winters) are sisters who have lived together for years. Frances meets a man (Mako), falls in love, and Evelyn properly senses a threat to the cloistered life she has chosen for the two of them. On the surface this is a relatively banal plot but there is much to raise this movie from banality.

First and foremost are the performances of the two iconic actresses. In the twilight of their careers they both demonstrate the skill that have brought them both academy awards and universal respect. Evelyn, like Shelley, is able to make you see enough inside of her to understand and care for her seemingly selfish and domineering manner. Francis, like Patricia, lures you into herself enough to see her strength and how she has the guts to break out of the many traps that life has set to destroy her happiness.
Beyond the performances the story touches on serious themes like racial and economic prejudice, the loneliness that often faces women as they age, the way people use guilt to manipulate other people. It does this without being preachy.

The story is developed sometimes painfully slowly and photographed too darkly but in the end,
watching two wonderful actresses playing against each other is well worth the effort.",1274918400,,1269,4.897674418604651
