8307592,5,B001H0QVAU,"For anyone who's gotten $35 overdraft fees and had their money slip through their fingers to the Big Banks of America, this movie will change your life.  Karney shows you his story, in an entirely entertaining, enlightening and empowering way.  You don't need to put up with it.  Watch this movie, stand up for your claim (even if you HAVE overdrawn an account, $30-35 a transaction is and INSANE amount for a fee), and spread the word.  The more we applaud this film and get it coverage, a following, and enough people standing up for themselves, the more we can change this egregious ""overdraft coverage"" forever.  Think McDonald's offers Supersize anymore after Supersize Me came out?  Yeah, this is one of those movies that will make a huge difference.

I wrote the filmmaker this email after viewing this movie and finding the power, the confidence, and the avenue to claim back a ridiculous amount of fees that my bank had erroneously placed on my account:

Dear Karney,

Thank you thank you thank you for making this.  I have somehow successfully managed to get my bank to refund most if not all of my fees which were unfairly bestowed on me, though recently I had some run-ins which leave me with a $-375 bank account (all fees).  The customer service is maddening.  I searched online and searched online for some hope, some proof that others were treated this way and that it is WRONG, UNFAIR and in many cases illegal.  The reps just explain to you, and then tell you what happened like you're an idiot.  I have been fortunate to have had several helpful reps, but mostly, they just want to do their job and go home, and not have to prove to their bosses why a fee was reversed.

Your movie is the first thing that has given me power in a long time.  Thank you for doing this, and I sincerely hope your film gets the press and coverage it deserves.  Those clowns need to be exposed.  I'm sick of being screwed over because I don't have a lot of money.  (UM...that part had some expletives which I removed.)

I am drafting a letter to send to the CEO of my bank, thanks to your film and your empowerment.  If that doesn't work, I'll file a claim, including work I lost to talk to these bastards on the phone.  It's even worse, reading your website, that you found it so hard to find consumers to talk to because they felt ashamed.  That's horrible; it's better to be angry, and then revengeful, and eventually I expect to win my power back.  But their practices don't only steal our money, it steals our dignity.

Here's why I write: 1. can you put me on an e-list about the movie, release, etc.?  and 2. I would love to give a donation towards your film once I get my money refunded.  It wouldn't be much, but I want to help your efforts in getting the word out, and even more, just validating those of us who've been screwed over and over and told that ""there's no bank error.""  Tell me how I could do that.

Thank you again.  May you have a fantastic life, my friend.

Yours,

(my name)

I'll update my own situation on this site. Buy the movie! Watch the movie! And if you have no money because your bank has taken it all, watch the trailer and/or the shortened version!

By the way, I am in NO WAY endorsed by the filmmaker.  I am just so happy that for the first time someone has taken this in the open.",1222905600,2,3318,4.383606557377049
