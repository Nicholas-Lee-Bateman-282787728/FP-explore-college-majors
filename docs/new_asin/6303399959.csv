8747399,5,6303399959,"Hands down the best instructional blues Bass guitar for video available.  Mr Beck covers a complete library of blues patterns and some history lessons as well.  I had the privilage of meeting Roscoe at the 2003 NAMM show in CA.  He is a geniune, down to earth person and killer bassist.  I even showed him a chop/slap technique I use as a result of watching his instructional video. My only gripe is that no DVD was every marketed in place of the VHS.  So if you're listening Roscoe ""create the DVD for this product, you're sitting on a gold mine.""",1347408000,,548,4.44
