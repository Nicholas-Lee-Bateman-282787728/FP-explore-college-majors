8232145,5,B000YDLHGE,"The story of a Serbian and a Muslim cellist who love during the horrible warring years as Yugoslavia divided. Chilling the deliberateness of the hate and violence, but their love transcends their environment even when it turns against them. This is a heavy drama, yet a slice of reality from so many peoples lives, both alive and now dead. The fatalist and pragmatic humour throughout is a welcome mitigating factor, that makes you smile many times. The film does not in any way predict gays will continue to be hated. Or that they were hated, it does not even reference that specifically. There is conflict when the jealousy of a woman, who wished to have Kenan for herself and not let anyone else have him, came to a dangerous head. Don't be put off by suggestions this is a political or controversionally gay film, as it is not. What objections to the film came from those who didn't want the Bosnian tragedy to be represented in any way by a gay story, when of course, there were gays during that time who survived, and why shouldn't their story to be told? Why should there only be allowed stories told by hetero characters or survivors?

It's the story of two lovers and what specifically happened to one. It had few political messages in it, except when Milan's friend at the end ironically says, ""Look at us, we are still fighting in the hills like medieval times when other countries are making computer chips!"" This is essentially a story of someone who did what he had to to survive, and the regrets they felt afterward when that love is lost. It is a HUMAN story. This film received MANY awards and commendations around the world, and was considered groundbreaking and poignant by many governments. Again, its no matter if you are GBLT or hetero: survival and keeping your humanity is one of the most important things of life. An outstanding film, but not what I expected to see, yet it was as I have experienced life. You are what you are. You don't have to be anything but that, whatever it is, however it is. There are often hard things, and you have to do things you might not ordinarily have done, and endure suffering in hopes to finally find a kind of peace. The climax of the film is shocking, and the message and characters will stay a long time in your thoughts.

Nudity, non-com hetero sex scene, suggested castration so be aware there are very mature themes. No gay sex scenes, only moderate kisses. One perceives it is the modesty of the east Europe, but for me, it was OUTSTANDINGLY necessary because of the progress of the story. The gay relationship was shown as loving, normal as breathing, a solid relationship of companionship and attraction. The relationship between father-in-law and ""daughter-in-law"" truly shows that gender does not have to matter in expression of fellowship and caring when a child chooses a partner. Too often gay relationships are represented in film and media as uneven, unbalanced or emotionally unhealthy. This one does well in showing that GBLT couples can and do feel and behave just like other couples.

Notable performances by Rade ERBEDZIJA, his performance is truly tremendous, you feel in viewing what he goes through. Simply excellent! And the main character the story revolves around, Kenan Dizdar, played by Mario DRMA is unforgettable. The winner of numerous awards, whether you are GBLT or not, if you like a mesmerizing drama about the endurance of the human soul, Go West is a valuable addition to any open-minded collection.",1247961600,8,3497,4.757825370675453
