7974348,5,B000077VS3,"I've been a fan of Mercy Me since ""I Can Only Imagine"" came out. Although I'm new to the scene, I know one thing.

 This DVD changed te way I looked at the band and there music. You get a feel for who they are and why they are so passionate about what they do.

 I admit, I cried while watching the making of their Award-Winning Hit. But there's more to it than that. You laugh with them as they go over childhood memories.

 I especially liked the Behind the Scenes View of the Dove Awards.

 You owe it to yourself and your WHOLE family to watch this amazing take on life in this Godly Band.

 Go Bless",1090972800,12,604,4.0423728813559325
