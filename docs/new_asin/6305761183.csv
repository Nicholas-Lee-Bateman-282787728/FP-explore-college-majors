7893857,4,6305761183,"In my youth, Jiri Trnka was a ground breaker in the world of puppet animation and creative narrative. We watched avidly for his films as they were technically fascinating, extremely witty and had a depth which english language films so lacked.
In viewing Trnka again after so many years it has dated in technique but is still as fresh in content. We have become so used to the marvels of computer animation that the labourious process of stop photography with its shortcomings sadly seems somewhat lacking. However Trnka, the master, can still show a trick or two as far as content is concerned.
This film is a sentimental journey for many of us, but is well worth watching as  a stage of filmic development.",1201392000,2,708,4.709677419354839
7893858,5,6305761183,"These unique, priceless animated offerings are perfect for those seeking some good old-fashioned low-tech charm after an overload of computer generated effects. Trnka was a brilliant artist whose work reflects a painstaking approach to creating animated magic. All his films reflect a striking breadth of imagination, and none more so than ""Nightingale"", which boasts Karloff's assured, understated narration. A memorable, distinctive treat for the whole family.",1182902400,,462,6.015151515151516
7893859,4,6305761183,"If ever a man was born to his trade and art, it was Trnka. He grew up helping his grandmother make dolls and his mother with her work as a seamstress. By the time started making his movies, in his 30s, he had utter fluency in all of the manual skill needed for success. For new success, that is, because his career as an artist was already well established by then.

This DVD splits almost evenly into a feature length piece and six shorts. The former, ""The Emperor's Nightingale,"" is a wonderful adaptation of a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen. It touches on many things, including the monotony of mechanical perfection compared to the unpredictable beauty of the organic world. Trnka objected to the Soviet regime that controlled the Czech people during most of his adult life. That was the hand that fed him, though, as well as the hand that could crush him. If there's a subtext of rebellion by a living society against a rigid, mechanical system of control, it's written in very small print.

The shorts varied widely in holding my attention. The cartoon adaptation of Chekov's ""The Bass Cello"" is warm and funny, with a delightful chill in it for anyone who's had a no-pants dream filled with frustration and embarassment. ""A Drop Too Much"" could possibly have been a public service feature, about a 15 minute sermon on the evils of drinking and driving. It comes across with the complexity and moral tone of one of those ""Davey and Goliath"" cartoons I never much liked as a kid. ""The Merry Circus"" is interesting for an innovative animation technique, one with many strengths and weakness relative to normal model making, and ""The Song of the Prarie"" is a silly satire of the 1950s Western movies - already pretty silly in themselves.

Only ""The Hand"" really stands out in that set. It's a modern fairy tale about artistic and personal freedom in the face of massive, controlling social power. Small wonder that this piece won awards abroad and suppression in his home country.

The style is a bit dated, and scripting tends towards a meditative pace. There's not a lot here for the ADHD generation, unless they're truly dedicated fans of animation. For us in the middle ground, there's a lot to enjoy, but the world has other things to enjoy in it, too.

7893860,5,6305761183,"I adored this movie from the opening scenes to the closing credits - a wonderful, light, romantic, master peace on animasion.",1146355200,,125,5.0
7893861,4,6305761183,"The Emperor's Nightingale is feature-length (67 minutes).  There are also five shorts plus a brief documentry on Trnka.  I'm not familiar with Andersen's original, but Trnka's treatment of The Emperor's Nightingale makes it perfect for his medium.  First of all, it is a story within a story: a live-action unhappy boy dreams the puppet-animated fairy tale.  Then, the dream itself revolves around a real singing nightingale and a mechanical singing nightingale.  Having this mixture of live action and puppet animation makes the experience more complex and interesting than reading the story in a children's book.  Plus, nowadays, with simulated on-line experience competing with ""real"" get-out-of-doors experience, the story is even more complex.  The Emperor of the title is the boy Emperor of China, and this leads to a nice Czech-filtered Oriental flavor to the art design.  The shorts are a mixed bag.  Story Of The Bass Cello (1949), from a Chekhov piece, and The Song Of The Prairie (1949), a spoof of Hollywood westerns, have humorous moments but felt too much like 1950s TV children shows.  The Merry Circus (1951) is unique: the animation is done entirely with paper cutouts.  The colors are very beautiful and reminded me of vintage carnival posters come to life.  Then there's A Drop Too Much (1954), which is like the Citizen Kane of animation because of the virtuoso display of narrative technique.  There is a stunning sequence of a drunk motorcyclist racing everything on the road during a rainy night.  The last short, The Hand (1965), is best enjoyed as a Beckett-like short play, rather than a political allegory.",1037577600,17,1633,5.113207547169812
7893862,5,6305761183,"What Harryhausen and Pal are to America, Trnka is to Eastern European stop-motion animation; the Master. This collection includes some of his best work, and these short films now shine like never before on this new  gorgeous DVD release. -This almost hypnotic new video format (DVD) seem to  have a very positive effect on people in the industry, bringing them to  seek the release of many a lost or forgotten treasure. I think the future  looks golden, indeed. There's something truly unique about the high art of  stop-motion, and personally I feel the older it is, strangely enough the  better it is somehow. Also adding to the fun in this case, is hearing the  wonderfully voiced Boris Karloff narrate one. Let's hope more Trnka stuff  (and puppet trickery in general) is on the way; he and other Czech  animators, like Karel Zeman, deserves it.",958867200,45,849,4.840277777777778
