There is real suspense toward the end of the movie, and some scenes that are difficult to watch(sexual situations and extreme violence).

2120879,4,B0002V7O10,"This review will be of the film alone and not the dvd transfer or any other technical aspects of the Criterion disc.

I personally own three Catherine Breillat films. In no particular order they are ROMANCE, ANATOMY OF HELL, and of course FOR MY SISTER. All of them are very sexual, very explicit, and very french. But there is something about FOR MY SISTER that is very different from the other two. It tells the very intimate story of two sisters, Elena and Anais, who are away for the summer holidays with their parents. Both couldn't be more different than the other, and I mean it more than just physically. Elena, being the eldest considers herself more adult and continually scolds her younger sister when Anais questions her logics. The two of them pick and tease each other relentlessly, but behind closed doors they are as close as ever. The two share more in common than they think. Something that goes beyond just being sisters. They share a bond that holds strong against anything they may face, including the introduction of a potential boyfriend for Elena. When fights do break out between the sisters, Elena is quick to accuse Anais of being jealous, not realising that her relationship is really nothing to be jealous about. The boy, or shall I say young man, in Elena's life is only after her physical attraction and nothing more. He fills her head with whispers of his undying love all the while caressing her body as she lay naked beside him. Throughout the film Anais is portrayed as the observer. She watches her sister's summer romance play out, knowing how the story will end. She herself is also curious of the other sex, but has a very frank and somewhat honest approach. Anais may not be any more mature than Elena, but I consider her to be quite wise and I think that scares Elena. It scares her to think that her ""younger"" sister may be more advanced mentally so she retaliates with cruel comments on Anais' weight and appearance. Ultimately the relationship Elena has with this young man ends and it is Anais that Elena leans on for moral support. For those who haven't seen the film I've chosen not to talk about the somewhat bizarre and shocking ending of the film. So I will conclude this review with my final thoughts.

2120881,4,B0002V7O10,"Catherine Breillat dials back the formal experimentation just a bit and delivers a harrowing coming-of-age story about a sexually precocious young girl and her kid sister who envies the older sibling's purchase on the adult world without understanding all that it entails. There are two deeply shocking scenes in Fat Girl. The first is the older sister's seduction by an older boy that mostly plays out in one long uncomfortable take and depicts sexual negotiation at its most predatory. The other is impossible to discuss without venturing into spoiler territory, but suffice to say that with it Breillat creates not just a shocking statement about gender politics, but a singularly cold-eyed depiction of how bad things actually happen in life.",1360195200,,746,5.225

These extra features include 'Making of Fat Girl'(5:39), Interview w/Catherine Breillat(9:56), 2001 Berlin Film Festival(11:48), and a Theatrical Trailer which includes the French(1:10) and U.S.(1:21) versions of Fat Girl.

The film which convinced me that Catherine Breillat could spin her considerable insight into sexual politics into an incisive and engaging film, Fat Girl is a very interesting take on sex and relationships which should not only keep you interested throughout its short running time, but show you a story you're unlikely to see in any other film.

2120890,3,B0002V7O10,"Fat Girl (Catherine Breillat, 2001)

So I've now finally seen a Catherine Breillat film. And it's been a month, and I'm still not exactly sure how I feel about it. For a film that runs less than ninety minutes, it tends to the long-winded and didactic. On the other hand, it's one of the few serious films to treat adolescent sexuality with the directness (and, in some perverse way, the reverence) it deserves. On the third hand (can I borrow one of your hands?), Breillat, in her quest for realism of the body, throws out realism of the emotions altogether; in some ways it's a filmed version of one of those awful novels where characters are laughing one second, crying the next, and then full of gritty determination-- and dry cheeks-- and instant later. The characters put on and take off emotions as if they were underwear to be paired with a particularly odd-colored dress. The fourth hand? Well, we'll give that to the ending, which I have since found out (thanks to reading many reviews and a couple of flame wars on IMDB) is considered ""shocking"", ""unrealistic"", and ""too pat"". I, ever the contrarian, found it none of those things a month before I read all this; in fact, it was the only ending that made sense, given much of the dialogue that had come before it.

The plot concerns two sisters, fifteen-year-old nymphette Elena (Sheitan's Roxane Mesquida) and twelve-year-old Anais (Anais Reboux), who's supposed to be the plain one of the two. (I disagreed throughout the film, as I often do; the whole reason I got so confused by The Truth About Cats and Dogs was that Janeane Garofalo was supposed to be the plain one. I don't get it.) The two of them and their mother (Arsinee Khanjian of Code Inconnu) are on holiday at the beach for the summer. Anais resolves to lose her virginity; Elena just wants to explore, while keeping hers intact. There are a number of discussions about this, and it's during these discussions (which also point to the ""long-winded"" and ""didactic"" charges above) that the emotional instability appears; the two girls are picking at one another one second and the closest of confidantes the next. How does that work, exactly? Oh, I forgot: it doesn't in real life. In any case, Elena finds herself a boyfriend, the older, slicker Fernando (My House in Umbria's Libero de Rienzo), while Anais, who, again, is supposed to be the plain one, has to imagine trysts with landmarks and lawn furniture. To go farther would be entering spoiler country, but I think you can plot the course pretty easily from there.

There are good things about Fat Girl, and there are bad things about it. I can't make a recommendation either way; I think this is one of those movies that everyone who sees it will feel slightly differently about, assuming they don't tar it with the overly-wide (and inappropriate, given the treatment of the subject matter) brush of obscenity. What you take away from it will, ultimately, be based on what you bring to it. Proceed accordingly. ***",1223596800,2,2998,4.72848948374761

SPOILER ALERT

Save yourself an hour and a half of garbage ... Read This.

So the film drags along for over and hour. The skinny 15 yr old sister who is still a virgin and prefers to keep her virginity gets sodomized in front of her little obese 12 yr old sister by this italian college guy.

Then she finally decides to lose her virginity to this guy, once again in front of her little sister. The little fat girl sobs and cries while this is happening.

Once the guy gets what he wanted he's gone.

The mom finds out about what happened gets upset and they all get in the car to drive back home from their vacation.

The mom pulls over at a rest stop to get some sleep. Mom and skinny girl fall asleep. Fat sister stays awake in the back seat (eating which she enjoys very much).

Suddenly out of nowhere some psychotic killer smashes the front window and smashes the skinny sister's head with an axe while fat little sister watches in terror, then grabs mom by the neck and chokes her to death.

Drags little sister into the woods and rapes her, but thankfully doesn't kill her.

2120892,3,B0002V7O10,"Relevant, but shocking subject matter, plus out of the blue ""What the heck..."" ending. This film, almost 8 years old is undoubtedly innovative, which I appreciate. My fear is that Hollywood is chomping at the bit ready to stretch the boundaries of what censors and the mainstream American viewing public should be watching. As in ""The Piano"" where a lead actor is so young that they aren't allowed to view the finished product, one must question the moral aspect in terms of child abuse.",1210291200,,487,4.809523809523809
2120893,3,B0002V7O10,"Title was probably not the best in the world but the film is certainly not as bad as the title may suggest.

2 teenage girls go on holiday to their summer house with mum and dad.  One a girl who knows herself to be attractive and the other a chubby girl, out of place and out of step with her older sister.  The older sister has all but embraced adulthood while the younger one still clings to her childhood.  The older sister dresses like a typical teenage girl while the younger is plain and shabbily dressed.

In no time at all the older sister meets a young man who has his own car, speaks a couple of languages and obviously has a bit of money to throw about.  The 2 begin a relationship with the younger sister dragging along behind which eventually leads to the older sister sleeping with her new found boyfriend.

Without going into too much detail of the plot it is an exploration of coming of age, first sexual encounters and the consequences.  In this the film is fairly realistic in how it examines this.  The boy using whatever means he can to get what he wants, the naive younger girl who thinks herself far more grown up than she really is and our 'fat girl' left at the side.

While some have mentioned they found the sex scene uncomfortable (the actress obviously was a lot older) It does go on probably more than is really necessary the film does however explore to some extent her own personal emotions both towards herself and her older sister.  What does concern me however was just how old was the younger sister when this film was made?

The ending while shocking has almost nothing to do with the actual film and quite why the director chose to end the film in this way is anyone's guess.  Maybe he just wanted the extra shock value.",1203638400,,1757,4.385802469135802
2120894,5,B0002V7O10,"Catherine Breillat's ""Fat Girl"" (2001) is an astounding movie that provides uncompromising and unblinking look at the relationship between two teenage sisters, and their first sexual experiences. The older sister, 15 years old Elena,  has no problems attracting boys' attention and sexual desire and while on the family Summer vacation, she meets an older, more experienced boy, who  will say and promise anything to seduce her. There are two long, thorough and uncomfortable scenes of seducing Elena that take place in the girls' bedroom with the younger sister, 12 years old Anais, the fat girl of the title not quite asleep. Breillat remembers well what the hell it is to be a teenager, to be confused, frustrated, to think low of yourself, to be ready to enter the world of sexual relationships, to be ready for love, for intimate closeness and to pretend that you don't care about them at all. She also looks closely and with none a gram of sentimentality into siblings' and parents -daughters relationship.  The scenes of cruelty and contempt the older sister treats the younger one alternate with rare but poignant moments of tenderness and understanding. Breillat takes us to places we don't go often and we don't want to go but they exist. If you've seen Brellat's movies already, you know that her outlook is not particularly happy, optimistic, or sentimental but ""Fat Girl"" will shock you as very few movies can. Just when you think that the movie is over and despite the disappointments,  embarrassing revelations, and shameless manipulations, life goes on and has so much to offer, Breillat presents you with the final scene that is very difficult to watch and impossible to forget. It does not matter really if the final scene actually took place or was just a fantasy, just the dream projected on the screen.",1195516800,5,1823,4.947712418300654
2120895,1,B0002V7O10,"The title of this film is a misnomer.  ...The ""fat girl"" is little more than a prop throughout the entire film.

Breillat, who is completely obsessed with male genitalia and shock value, fails to bring the ""fat girl"" into the spot light at all.  Far too much time is spent on the development of her skinny sister's summer romance (in fact, the title of the film should be ""Skinny Sister Used for Sex During a Boring Summer Vacation"").  This particular actress looks very young and consequently, I found myself to be a little uncomfortable with the sex scene.

""Fat Girl"" lulls the viewer to sleep but does manage to bash you upside the head with such blunt force during the last segment--and thats the problem--the ending is so far out there that it fails to resonate with what Ms. Breillat tries to accomplish with the excrutiatingly dull story.  What good is shock if it struggles to make sense and fails to show purpose?

Under the pretext of being weighty and philosophical this director, whose name I'm trying to forget, has produced a pretentious, ugly, stupid and demeaning movie.  Other reviewers here have already said it very well.  Nothing here illumines the human condition.  Do we know any more about sexuality or anything than we did before?

(duh)  That foolish young pretty girls with superficial, materialistic, absent parents might fall prey to the guy with the Roman hands? (excuse me..bad joke)  (duh) That the fat younger sister might feel bad about herself?  (This is news?)

There is nothing truly original presented here.  I was not shocked by the sorta graphic sex (the guy was at least very handsome!) nor by the hideous ending.  It was boring and prentious...the worst of French film making.  I watched the interview with the director, hoping that her comments would shed some light on the movie, which might make me see it in a more favorable way.  Yuk...she is really full of herself...""I am the film"" she said, (perhaps quoting Louis XIV ""I am the state.""?)  She seemed mean, too, in the way she spoke of how she directs her actors.  I hope they were well paid for what they went through. I give the film two stars for their performances.  There is one nice scene...the one with the two sisters giggling about their lives together.  It's the only one that has anything approaching genuine affection.

This film, Fat Girl (aka For My Sister) was the first film of hers I saw, and it's still my favorite.  The film centers around 2 sisters, one seductive and one slovenly and fat, yet the fat one seems to know what's going on better than her (at least physically) more attractive sister.  The scenes where an Italian suitor tries to seduce the attractive sister are difficult to watch, because they have so much truth in them.  Many people dislike Breillat's film intensely.  She's been compared to the Marquis de Sade, not in terms of S/M sex, but in the tone of her work regarding relationships (many people have never read de Sade.  His work is about much more than bondage).  Watching interviews with her is as fascinating as her films.  Her films are very bleak and cynical, yet there is more truth in one frame of Fat Girl (and Breillat's other work) than in an entire season of Sex and the City (I would have loved to see her as ""special guest director"" on Sex and the City.  It would have been the best episode.  See my review of the Sex and the City boxset).  Many people dislike the ending.  The ending fits in perfectly with the tone of the film (and of the character it most affects).  This (along with Anatomy of Hell) are amongst the best of her films.  To have a filmmaker as perceptive as her in this day and age is something we should all be grateful for.  See Sex is Comedy as well.  It's a companion piece to this film.

2120903,2,B0002V7O10,"'Fat Girl' is a daring and explicit film that tries to explore the confusion, anxiety, violence of teenage sexuality.  It stars two sisters who are trying to find their sexual identity.  One of the sisters is a stunning beauty, while the other is a pudgy outcast.  They are on vacation, and the beautiful one meets a handsome college student who steals the virginity from her.  What saves the film from being a complete waste and being absolutely pointless is the dialogue between the characters.  The dialogue is fantastic as they show the bitterness and cynicism of two sexually confused teenagers.  It shows the emotional abuse that teenagers put on each other.

The ending of 'Fat Girl' seems to have become very famous by now.  Yes, it is absolutely shocking, but the ending does not bring any sense or hope to the overall film.  It is an extremely pessimistic look humanity, and also, might I say, a savagely sexist outlook on males.

The majority of the film focuses on the incredible (as in, ""wow, that is not credible!"") naivit of a 15-year-old girl from the Paris suburbs who decides to let some sleezy Italian 20-something pop her French cherry. Happenstance forces the 15-year-old and her embarrassingly un-smooth older lover to conduct all of this business (the screwing, the pre-screwing banter, etc.) in a room she shares with her pudgy 12-year-old sister Anais. The whole piece unfolds like a dreamy high-budget after school special, except for some truly enjoyable scenes that reveal the sisters' unique bond.

I guess there's some other good stuff about this film, but let me cut to the chase and say that every moment of it is RUINED at the END which is NEEDLESSLY VIOLENT and DONE PURELY FOR SHOCK VALUE. If that's your thing, fine, whatever. But personally, I think pain porn like this is for hopelessly jaded or deeply pretentious people who think that it's cool to exhibit pure contempt for our species. The creative mind that conjures this ending is one that has no sensitivity for the kind of suffering she attempts to portray, and the kind of viewer that stands back in appreciation is either a sadist or afraid to declaim anger at such a dehumanizing portrayal of murder and rape for fear of being called ""shallow"" or ""prudish"" or -- mon dieu! -- ""sincere.""

2120912,4,B0002V7O10,"Anas is a plumb, unattractive 12-year-old girl who lives in a dream world, not unlike many girls her age, where one day she'll find true love, marry and live happily ever after. Her sister Elena is a beautiful 15 year old who has become very aware of her sexuality. For the most part, their self-obsessive mother and workaholic father are uninvolved in their lives and they are pretty much on their own. During a family vacation, which dad must abandon because of work, the girls meet a good looking Italian law student, Fernando, and Elena, literally reeking with wanton sexuality, arranges to meet the young man at their vacation house. Since Elena shares a room with Anas, the younger sister is sworn to secrecy. After Fernando arrives, we learn very quickly that he's been around and his objective is solely to score with this young girl, but confronted with the reality of sex, Elena is hesitant. She wants more than sex . . . perhaps she even shares her younger sisters illusions about love. Nevertheless, Fernando convinces her that she can please him sexually and it won't really count as sex. This scene along with the actual act the following night are difficult to watch, but more so for Anas. Besides the anger, jealousy and disillusionment, all of her notions of romantic love are being warped. Her dreams have disappeared and she's become numb. When the shocking violent end arrives, we should hardly be surprised by her reaction. Graphic and powerful stuff by controversial director Catherine Breillat.",1106784000,31,1517,4.906614785992218
2120913,3,B0002V7O10,"I know really nothing of the director or French Cinema to be sure, but this film attains a rare quality of being truly neutral and thus in connection with reactions to the film.  If it does not anger and delight and/or engage viewers then the film would have been a failure.  Yet as a piece of structure or tale of morality and journey it plays like an animated storyboard.

By maintaining a strange feeling of intimate fly-on-the-wall scenes with a very well-developed main character...the film manages to literally smash itself down in a horrible [...] at the end.  By showing this extreme the film maintains a middle ground although it is not quite the same as the neutral ground of a viewer who approaches the film feeling no sense of extreme.

My meaning is just that Fat Girl is a film much like the characters:  undeveloped, adolescent, hyper-focused, and radiant.  It has a style like a teenage consciousness is actaully telling the story, typically omitting meatier items like the parents.  In fact, the notion that a bleak, ""whatever"" kind of vacation would be the place for love suggests both extremley naive youth and/or jaded adult.  The physical embodiment and connection between adult and teen is Anais herself.  Formless and fat, she looks big as a grown-up and babyish as a toddler.  It is her perspective that we must see.  No other person could tell this tale properly because the Mother would be clueless and enraged while Elena is lost is such a pile of sexual romantic manure she rivals  a naked Snow White.  Even at the end, Anais keeps her identity as the sole individual voice that won't let teens or adults tell her anything.  [...]
  Yet this film is seriously flawed.  If Anais is to be the narrator who can bear witness to and emotionally react to her sister and her exploits (compare the sex scenes with the scene of the two of them on the bed, giggling) then why was there not at least a similar moment with the mother?  Such a scene(s) would have actually supported Anais's character as the ""bearer of weight"" of the family and further explained her inability to wholly believe one side or the other as being anything but a paradox of messed up feelings and true one-on-one connection.  The movie has three characters...but the third really isn't the boy.  It should have been the mother.

Finally, why call Cronenberg?  Because the ""collisions"" between people, the possible and fearful dangers filmed on the highway while the mother is driving the daughters home, and the [...] scene accomplishes in 10 minutes what David Cronenberg's CRASH took 2 hours to do.

2120914,4,B0002V7O10,"Its hard to give a film like this a descent rating without giving it a low or exagerrated stats. But much is to be said about this film other then Breillat directing it. I don't care nor do i bother of knowing who she is and that her films are all focusing on female sexuality. What should be discussed is the film itself without mentioning of Breillat.

The film is more powerful than it is joyful to watch with a ""shocking"" ending and the full frontal sex scenes. And that is all what people are writing about this film, making it looklike Texas Chainsaw gone porn. Nice, im not sure if anyone sees it but like i do, I could care less. It focuses on two sisters, who are completely opposite of one another, in looks and personality. A Fat Girl, may not be the best title, which maybe the first reason to turn off a customer at Blockbuster or Rogers Video store whose browsing through the Drama/Foreign section.

Moving on..Elena the pretty and older one begins a whirlwind relationship with Fernando, an Italian Law Student from Rome. With charm and persuasiveness he lures Elena into making ""love""

to him and in that giving her virginity to a man that she loves and vice versa. As all this goes on Anais, the less attractive and obese sister looks on the whole time. Things soon collapse between Elena and Fernando and what happens after is the fate that the two sisters face. The ending, yes shocking, out of the blue, violent blah blah whine whine. The ending for me was also a shocker and left me dumb founded, but after watching the end scene over and over, I don't think there is anything shocking about it. The conversations between all of the characters, especially the sisters seem cold and cruel, mostly towards Anais's weight. But that is why the film is ohnest because it does not hold anything back.

I had no problem with the nude and sex scenes, and wished that people would stop complaining about it like the movie really made you feel that bad.",1104883200,4,1964,4.508426966292135

Settling in to this movie, expecting somewhat of a dark comedy with some curry, I was immeaditly moved by the two main characters of the sisters, with the Italian male college student as a character I first found charming then quite disgusting. The parents, while seeming to have an interesting back story, are quite literally in the background since this film is interested in the girls' world. The cinematography is beautiful and has a way of elevating everyday boring life into a thing of beauty, not unlike the Virgin Suicides. The dialouge between the sisters and the older sister and the male college student are so realistic and moving and typical, that it somehow transcends it's predictability. I agree with everyone else that the ending is quite a shocker, but I don't think it is meant to be a dream or fantasy but cruel, sudden horror. The director foreshadows this with the seemingly endless highway footage of the mother passing trucks and then being boxed in by them-being a nervous driver myself, it did succeed in freaking me out. This is where Kids and Dusk to Dawn come in. I remember loving the everyday psuedosophisticated dialouges, then BAM! Vampires! BAM! Drunk Rape! Like this movie, BAM!

If you are an easily offended or easily shocked person, do not watch this film because chances are you will be thinking too much about being shocked to think about what Catherine Breillat is trying to say.

In my experience, Breillat makes films that are not meant to be ""enjoyed"" in the traditional sense, but rather analyzed and understood through thought and symbolism.

If you are not someone who likes to think about films past the surface, you may not want to watch this film.

I think there is a lot to be thought about an analyzed from this film, so if you're up to seeing something unlike you've ever seen before and you're not easily shocked, go for it.",1103846400,3,941,4.517647058823529

How novel: A European prize-winner has a repulsively violent ending, coming out of nowhere but laughably and clumsily foreshadowed throughout the rest of the movie.  Who woulda thunk?

It doesn't make a director deep simply if she makes cheap, obvious nihilism.  Of course there are those ""sophisticates"" who think any hint of ambiguity in an ending is evidence of brilliance.  Guess I'm not that soigne.

And the spectacle of the obese young girl (who's seen clutching a stuffed animal in the making-of film) having to bare her [...] for a leering camera is one of the most distasteful things I've ever seen.",1101081600,16,790,4.7226277372262775
2120918,4,B0002V7O10,"Fat Girl comes at you out of leftfield, leaving you breathless by the last frame.  It's an unflinchingly realistic portrayal of two adolescent siblings: twelve year old Anais and fifteen year old Elena.  Anais watches as Elena is seduced by, falls in love with and ultimately gives up her virginity to Fernando, a drop dead gorgeous smooth talking Italian teenager.  Elena, because she's older, believes she's wiser in matters of the heart but it's really the pratical Anais who is wiser when she admonishes her older sister.  ""It's best to do it for the first time with someone you don't know.  That way they can't brag about it afterwards. Men are pigs.""  That line along with the juxaposition of wise younger sister/deluded older sister culminates in a shocking and wildly disturbing ending that comes out of nowhere.

Unlike Breillat's more explicit previous works such as Romance, the erotic scenes in Fat Girl are hugely downplayed. We still get to see a beautiful naked man but the actual erotic scenes, for the most part, take place off screen. The focus of the film is the dynamics of siblings, gender, puberty and desire.  I haven't been a huge fan of Breillat's past work but Fat Girl has given me a new respect for her. Shocking, daring and relevant.",1100131200,8,1262,4.810185185185185
2120919,4,B0002V7O10,"Two teenage sisters, Anas and Elena, are on vacation with their parents.  This means when the older, Elena, begins to explore the quiet seaside town the younger, Anas, tags along.  On their trivial explorations the girls talk about what interests them the most, love, as both girls are curious and beginning to form their own notions on love.  Elena is the slim, pretty, and confident sister that has intrinsic needs to feel and express love, while Anas is round and timid, yet perceptive and thoughtful.  Often Anas drifts into a melancholic slump in which she recites gloomy poetry as an internal reflection, which becomes a psychosocial depiction of anxiety in regards to her own body image.

When the two sisters encounter Fernando, an Italian law student on vacation with the parents, Elena is flattered by his attention to her.  They quickly initiate a close physical connection as Fernando desires Elena while Elena wishes for love.  However, the connection between Elena and Fernando is doomed from the moment they met as he is quick to meet her requests in order to accomplish the mission to conquer her.  Anas sees through Fernando's charade, but Elena does not want to hear about it as her wishes for love are stronger than her convictions.

It is expected that Elena will be hurt, as the painful journey to come of age continues, but she cannot abandon Fernando as her wisdom does not supersede her inner desire to share the affection of love.  In the shadow of Elena's disastrous love affair Anas witnesses everything as she shares a room with her older sister.  Anas's witness to Elena's journey affects her perception of herself and love as her thoughts of herself grow darker and deeper.

Fat Girl is no rosy teenage love comedy, which frequently is released from major production companies.  Instead the director Catherine Breillat portrays a dark and hard-hitting coming of age story that strikes the retina with haunting realism and the eardrum with gloomy poetry, which leaves a lasting imprint in the cerebral cortex.  The cinematography and mise-en-scene enhance the cinematic experience as they enhances the dark atmosphere which Anas is experiencing.  The beach scene where Anas lays on the sand as the sea water barely reaches her is an unforgettable moment as it illustrates her perception of her existence.  Lastly, the final sequences of the film will unexpectedly shake a drained audience as it offers much to reflect upon in Anas's perspective.",1099785600,7,2474,5.012224938875305

This is a movie of the relationship between two sisters;  a beautiful one who attracts men who wish to seduce her, and her younger sister who is obese, but is the stronger of the persons, and the stronger character in the film.  The sisters are close, and confide in each other even with the tension between siblings always present.  The handsome Italian young man who is the seducer is a young man on the prowl, who will say anything to get his goal.  Of Breillat's movies, I can see why this won so many foreign film awards in 2001.  This is a good movie of relationships and character and growing up and dealing with emotions.  The special features (interviews) give good background into Breillat's thinking about film making.  Four stars is perhaps a bit generous, but three stars cheats this film.  For a DVD issued by Criterion, I do not understand why they put the subtitles on the film, rather than in the black letterbox edge.

If anything we get a few extra minutes than the U.S theatrical release, which would be a bonus for anyone who saw this movie in U.S. theaters.  I trust Criterion know what they are doing.

As for the aesthetic value of the film itself: Fat Girl is a fine film! It says much more than the superficial surface of things. In fact, the simpler any film seems, the more it really has to say. It is actually quite open to interpretation, which has left many with various opinions of it. It's a rare film that has very vocal detractors and supporters. Plus, it has one of the most shocking scenes in cinematic history. The whole film could be seen as a build-up to that final scene, one might say, and you could actually get away with saying that and still say the film has much depth.

It shows no male nudity at all, which is at odds with many reviews of the uncut theatrical release - reviews that also list the running time as 93 minutes.

2120925,5,B0002V7O10,"When I first heard that the English title of Catherine Breillat's 'A ma soeur' (literally 'for my sister') was 'Fat Girl', I was shocked that such sexism and sizism could exist in such strangulatingly p.c. times, especially in the light of the director's uncompromising, though idiosyncratic feminism. But from the very first sequence, Anais' weight is foregrounded, as she devours a banana split at a cafe while her sister is being chatted up by an Italian student. The body is the focus of this film, its display, and the attempts to control it, whether by deciding how much you're going to eat, by seducing minors or by deciding to whom you'll offer your virginity. Like another recent French film, Patrice Chereau's 'Intimacy', Breillat focuses on sexuality in a way hostile to mainstream cinema. Unlike 'Intimacy', whose gauche attempts at realism destroyed its credibility, Breillat insists on formality and artifice, from the summer holiday setting, with its two heroines 'locked up' in a chalet that, with its guards, gates, bars, curfews seems like a high security prison; to the ritualistic manner in which characters negotiate sex; to Breillat's awesomely complicated filming apparatus. The film's coup-de-theatre is a lengthy scene in which Elena sneaks in her boyfriend to the bedroom she shares with a sister she assumes is asleep. Not only is the viewer faced with the problematics of staring at the naked, fetishised body of a minor, and the increasingly grotesque and hypocritical attempts of her lover to seduce her; not only is the framing unflinchingly static, with the odd, sinisterly creeping movement, and the tight compositions forcing the two lovers into an airless claustrophobia; but our voyeurism is shared by our knowledge of the mostly unseen gaze of the younger girl looking on. Though this is the longest and most rigorous example, the film is full of scenes like this, triangular groupings of characters inflicting or evading each others' surveillance, while the parents who have theoretically imposed a rigid discipline on the girls see nothing. Spatial relations draw attention to themselves, as do the symbolic resonances of the settings (chopped woods, dunes etc.). The filming is deliberately unshowy, often flat. Narrative proceeds by a looping pattern, the same characters shifting positions in similarly-set scenes.
So rarefied and artificial is this milieu, that when reminders of the outside world intrude, such as financial worries, it is shocking. And this is where the film becomes especially brilliant. What seemed to have been a fascinating dramatisation of ideas culled from feminism and film theory, focusing on ideas of free will, choice, exploitation, truth, knowledge, appetite etc., the extraordinary last third reminds us that we don't always have a final say in everything we do.

In 'Fat Girl,' she follows a young, overweight teenage girl and her babe 15-year-old older sister. The girls are shown as opposing characters: the older is beautiful and bossy, the younger quiet and reflective. When the older of the sisters meets an Italian college student, she begins to explore the boundaries of her own sexuality, with the younger sister onlooking. Shown without any sort of candy-coating or implication, 'Fat Girl,' like 'Romance,' is a raw, bold, and commendable film. But unlike 'Romance,' the shock and humility the female characters endure in the film does not seem over-the-top or ridiculous.

2120927,5,B0002V7O10,"It upsets me that reviewers have focused on the issues of weight and female competition and jealousy that do exist in this film, but completely ignore the major point of this film.  Breillat gives us a brutally honest portrayal of female ""baptism"" into sexuality.  It is not pretty, or romantic, or even sensual (as the socially astute ""fat girl"" realizes).  The older sister, whose bed is surrounded by issues of Cosmo, appropriately enough) is hyper-feminized, and believes that she needs to look as if she stepped off the pages of Cosmo to get and keep and please a man--the most important tasks a woman is given by our culture.  Her younger sister is less accepting of these--in fact she repeatedly says that she wants to lose her virginity to someone she doesn't love (a fact consistenly ignored by reviewers in their reviews, and vital to understanding the ending and the distinction between the two sisters).  The shocking ending is so significant in this regard--Breillat dares us to question the nature of female adolescent sexual experiences, and to blur the line between consensual and nonconsensual sex in the context of female adolescent sexual awakening.  I believe that the consistent overemphasis on weight, (note the strange translation of A Ma Soeur to Fat Girl???) which certainly is an important underpinning of all that transpires in the film, is to the detriment of fostering open discussion of the issue of sexuality; I can only assume that this stems from an inability on the part of the public to get past the reality that adolescent females are in fact sexually active, do not have adequate and reliable resources and information to deal with newfound feelings and cultural expectations and norms, and face often traumatic circumstances as a result.",1006732800,126,1775,5.020408163265306
2120928,2,B0002V7O10,"Catherine Breillat, the director of ""Fat Girl"", has made a career of supposedly exposing the inner workings of the female mind as in her ""Romance"" or ""36 Fillette."" And many have lauded her work as being incisive and earth shattering: probably, in part because her women are shown as acting upon their sexual desires and fantasies rather than keeping them bottled up. So far so good. ""Fat Girl"" is the story of Anais,17 (Anais Reboux), the fat girl of the title, her sister Elena, 15 (Roxane Mesquida.. a sexy, younger version of Parker Posey) and Elena's new beau, Fernando (Liberio De Rienzo).  Anais and Elena have a love/hate relationship as do most sisters, with Anais taking a lot of guff from Elena about her weight, looks and lack of a boyfriend. At this point in the movie you don't really feel sorry for Anais because she can give as well as take the abuse from Elena.  But when Fernando arrives on the scene and begins a sexual relationship with the sexually naive and relationship-impaired Elena all hell breaks loose; especially since  Elena and Fernando make love in full view of Anais (who is in the same room supposedly asleep), who pathetically sobs while Elena is losing her virginity.  Tough, Heart-wrenching stuff as the scene further destroys what is left of Anais'self esteem. The girl's parents are oblivious to much of this with her mother more concerned with the moss growing on her patio and the father with his work in town.  Groundbreaking revelations about parents and children? Revelations about teenage sexual angst?  I don't think so.  All you need to do is view ""Rebel without a Cause"" or ""Spendor in the Grass"" to realize that Breillat is merely regurgitating ideas that have around for many years.  Her stuff is more sexually explicit, yes.  But smarter, more coherent, more incisive than those two examples. No.  And the denouement or ending?  Senseless, Gratuitous and simply empty headed.

The Criterion Collection is a US movie distributor that offers ""important classic and contemporary films,"" so I figured a French film titled ""Fat Girl"" might be worth watching.

Both positive and negative reviewers agree that this movie focuses on the relationship between the two adolescent sisters, Elena (15-years-old, slim, pretty) and Anais (12-years-old, chubby, pretty). The movie does its darndest to convince the audience that Anais is not pretty due to her chubbiness. The sisters can be bluntly honest with each other; I'm not sure if either one ever means to be cruel. It's impossible for me to say if the sisters are particularly close because for most of the story they are isolated and stuck with each other, with no one else to talk to. Their family is on vacation at a rather remote beach area and the parents are aloof to the point of neglect. In fact the entire family seems remote.

Some reviewers describe this as a ""moody"" film but I think that's because everyone is so alienated. Even when the college boy Fernando enters the story, the ""love"" between him and Elena seems shallow and detached. Elena says she might as well lose her virginity to someone she ""loves,"" but she's so matter of fact about it, acknowledging that Fernando will just be the first of many to come. Fernando, like some young men, will say anything to persuade Elena to have sex. These seduction scenes are perhaps the cornerstones of the movie.

Nothing in this film offers any interesting insights on families, sibling relationships, adolescence, coming-of-age, or sexuality. I didn't get to know any of the characters. In the case of Anais (the titular 'fat girl'), we learn that she seems to have low self-esteem and an emotionally-driven desire to eat. On the other hand we get glimpses of her romantic imagination as she mumbles fantasies of love to herself. But even then we don't get to know Anais. All the characters seem to be in a blue funk but we never learn what's at the root of it.

In other words, I don't see how this film is either ""important"" or a ""classic."" As far as I know it doesn't break any new ground in films - if anything it seems to trod over old territory. The conclusion of the film is sudden and unexpected. I'll agree with other reviewers that it doesn't fit the story. One reviewer thinks that the ending reveals Anais' true feelings about her family, including her sister, but I disagree. I can't say more without giving it away, but I'll say this much: The ending highlights the detachment I mentioned earlier. I wonder what the average French person thinks of this film.",1514419200,,2719,4.7420718816067655
8032178,1,B0002V7O10,This film was listed on a top 10 best foreign films list. In my opinion it's one of the worst. I just didn't care about any of the characters and the film was so dull that it took me three days to get finish watching it.,1494806400,2,220,3.8043478260869565
8032179,1,B0002V7O10,"It started okay, it is a lot of slow moments though. The ending was absolutely ridiculous and didn't go with the rest of the movie.",1481155200,,131,4.28

8032181,1,B0002V7O10,"Not worth renting, the relationship between the two girls ran hot and cold, one pretty and the other fat and not interesting at all. The ending was a surprise and at the same time doesn't make any sense. Not what I expected and just not worth your time.",1454371200,,253,4.291666666666667

8032183,2,B0002V7O10,"Briefly, the movie is about a chubby young lady who inwardly resents her family, and especially her sister (although the extent of which is not revealed until the end) for constantly reminding her about being overweight.  Her interactions with her family seemed focused on her overeating and how she would be more of a ""regular girl"" if she didn't eat as much and lost weight.  Outside of that, she was largely ignored by her family, including ignoring that she was developing into a young woman.  Her interactions with her sister is the classic symbiotic-sadomasochistic relationship that attractive people often have with those who are less attractive.  On the one hand, the sister abuses the ""fat girl"" for no good reason except for affirmation that she is somehow superior.  This is then followed by her attempts to counteract the abuse with kindness in order to affirm her own goodness and preserve the relationship for future affirmation-driven abuse, as needed.  On the other hand, the fat girl subjects herself to the abuse to affirm her emotional/ psychological superiority over her abusive sister.  They clearly need each other for more than the abuse, as they both seem to live, in some part, through the other.  The sister seems to live vicariously through the perceived inner strength of the fat girl, and the fat girl lives vicariously through the physical attractiveness and superficial attitude of her sister.  Both love and hate what they see in the other but not in themselves. The backdrop of this interplay is that they are both blossoming into women and are driven by adolescent curiosity and desires.  As with most adolescent films, there is sex involved with the process of developing and there is a little bit here.  However, The sex is more alluded to rather than seen.  There are a couple of very brief shots of an erect penis and a breast or two, but no x-explicit scenes.  Except for the penis shots, it could easily have been a PG13 movie.  The end is rather unorthodox but I won't spoil it here.  I would have given this 2.5 stars but the system won't let me.",1435536000,2,2089,4.812324929971989
