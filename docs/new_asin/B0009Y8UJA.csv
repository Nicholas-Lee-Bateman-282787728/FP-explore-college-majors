Don't know why it wasn't shown here when it originally aired for three seasons in the UK in the early 1990s.  It is a bit dark but still excellent and though you note the lack of cell phones and other technologies that have developed and changed police work in the last 20 years, it doesn't feel that dated at all.  It takes a couple of episodes to get into it fully so don't give up!  This is a good one!",1313193600,3,537,4.076190476190476
