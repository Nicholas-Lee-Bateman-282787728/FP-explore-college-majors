8385083,3,B002ZIAAVY,"This is definitely not one of the better tributes to the Marine Corps. There are far too many film loops and even narrative loops for this to be a quality production. Some of the film clips are shown over and over again it as if the footage was just used to fill in the gaps during the narration whether it accurate to the narration or not. Some of the film clips were just plain wrong for the time period of the narration. For example there was a film clip of a marine using a ""walkie-talkie"" while the narrator was talking about the Japanese invasion of Wake Island. The 'walkie-talkie was not available for use until later in the war. Far too many editing errors for this to be a top notched polished production. The U.S. Marines deserve a better tribute than this series provides. Even the old Victory At Sea series was more accurate than this one and it as created in the early 50's.",1462752000,,888,4.387878787878788
