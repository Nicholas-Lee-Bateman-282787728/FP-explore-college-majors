8313064,3,B000Y2Q9VS,"We recently rented this movie from our local library.  My son(5) and daughter(2) loves it but there are problems with the video from an adult stand point.

There is no ""play all"" option that is often used on children's DVDs so after each segment you need to return to the main menu and move the selection to the next segment.  This menu system does not track what you have watched like most in the industry as well so it would be harder for a younger children to navigate.

The run time is listed at 60 minutes which is very misleading.  Only 2 of the 5 segments are really the children's cartoon.  The other segments include 2 music videos and a documentary on PEZ Heads.

Segment 1:  Episode 1 - One Funky Day - Runtime:  14 minutes(3.5 minutes are credits)
Segment 2:  Episode 2 - Rockets & Chocolate - Runtime:  14 minutes (3.5 minutes of credits)
Segment 3:  The Juliet Dagger with PEZ ""Saturday Morning"" Video - Runtime: 3.33 minutes
Segment 4:  The Juliet Dagger ""Sooper"" Video - Runtime:  3.5 minutes
Segment 5:  Bonus! A collection of PEZ Heads - Runtime:  25.5 minutes

As you can see from the break down, only half of this video contains the actual cartoon.  The runtime of the documentary is the longest segment on the video.

It takes effort for a cartoon to have bad acting in relation to the other voice actors but many of the voices used for this production are flat and the timing is off.  (Check out the piece of taffy/gum)  It seems most of the budget went into the music and music videos which stands out like a diamond in a pile of coal.

This video, although marketed for children, is more for the PEZ Heads.  It would be better if it followed the industry standards for the menu system.  If you are not a collector, save your money on this one.  Perhaps if there are plans for more, they will contain more actual episodes and less filler.  For the price of $9.99 you are getting very little content.",1228953600,2,1922,4.435530085959885
