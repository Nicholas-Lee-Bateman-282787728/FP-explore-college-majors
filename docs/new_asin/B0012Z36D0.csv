3100707,5,B0012Z36D0,In my house we are already convinced that The Backyardigans can do no wrong with whatever episode they put out!,1212624000,,111,4.6
3100708,5,B0012Z36D0,the dvd was delivered to my house in the exact amount of time amazon had said it would. it is delivered earlier than another store! i always preorder my daughter the backyardigans from amazon because we always get it from them the fastest. the dvd was great an entertaining they always are!,1212537600,,290,4.596153846153846
3100709,5,B0012Z36D0,"The Backyardigans series continues to entertain and amuse children and adults alike, and this DVD has four more episodes from Season Three.

1. Fly Girl - starring Uniqua, Pablo, Tasha and Tyrone.
Uniqua delivers singing telegrams to anyone, anywhere - and she's got her own pink seaplane to get her there.  She has messages for Pablo, who's a super clean neatnik pirate, Tasha, who's a Maharani in India and Tyrone, the abominable snowman.  She receives rather chilly welcomes from each of them, but bravely performs her message before beating a hasty retreat.  And now they're following her!

2.  Who Goes There?  - starring Tyrone, Pablo, Uniqua, Tasha and Austin.
If you've seen ""Night at the Museum"", you'll appreciate this one, with Tasha as the museum curator, Tyrone as the night guard and the other three as exhibits who come to life at night to a flamenco beat.

3. What's Bugging You? - starring Pablo, Tasha, Uniqua and Tyrone.
Tasha would love to become a member of the Spiffy Club run by Mr. Spiffy (Pablo), but first her house has to pass his thorough examination for cleanliness.  Unfortunately she discovers that she has a pest problem, and hires Uniqua and Tyrone to control her pest population. Short of spaying and neutering, nothing seems to stop the ""wormans"", and Mr. Spiffy is in the house!

4. Chichen-Itza Pizza - starring Tasha, Uniqua and Tyrone.
This is the only episode on DVD so far that doesn't have Pablo in it.  Set in ""Ancient Mexico"", Uniqua and Tasha run a pizza business, and are asked to make a delivery to King Tyrone in his golden pyramid, far, far, away.  They take a short cut through the jungle, and run into all sorts of Indiana Jones-type trouble.  Can the college fight songs see them safely through to making the delivery?

This is another great DVD in the series, and using your kids as an excuse, I'd recommend you get `em all.  The next DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Backyardigans-Mighty-Match-Up/dp/B001675ZJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Backyardigans: Mighty Match-Up!</a>&nbsp;is due out in July 2008, so you'd might as well pre-order that one too.
