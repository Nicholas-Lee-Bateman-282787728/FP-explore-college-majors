6445896,5,B00KTFJ5NO,"Thank you Shout Factory for sending us this DVD to review!

The Transformer Rescue Bots series is a great show targeted for school age boys.  The characters carry over from the previous shows, but watching them is not required to appreciate these episodes.  This Mystery Rescue has five suspenseful episodes lasting 110 minutes.

Countdown - Some weird bugs are teleporting people all over town into an abandoned cavern.  Will the Rescue Bots find everyone in time before they run out of air?

The Haunting of Griffin Rock - There are reports of ghost sightings all over Griffin Rock.  Do ghosts exist or is there some other explanation?  Perhaps Doc Greene's Spectral Vapor Filter will help solve this mystery.

Spellbound - The rescue team is vacationing in Blossom Vale when people start acting unusually.  Cell phones are to blame as they are somehow hypnotizing people.  Cody must get to the source and save everyone before it's too late.

Blame the Gremlins - Many people blame technical problems on gremlins.  What if they're real and are attacking the electronic devices in Griffin Rock?

Feed The Beast - Cody has an encounter with a bigfoot like creature called the Maine Ridge Monster.  Despite photographic evidence, nobody believes him.  Where does this monster stay and how did it come to be?  The town will soon find out!

My son enjoyed this DVD and is a fan of the show.  There are some supernatural and mysterious themes in these episodes, but most of the phenomenon  get explained through science.  The humor, animation, and voice acting is well done.  All in all this is a pretty good DVD for $13.",1415923200,2,1617,4.824817518248175
6445897,5,B00KTFJ5NO,"TRANSFORMERS RESCUE BOTS: Mystery Rescue came out last month from Shout Factory Kids in collaboration with Hasbro Studios. If you like me haven't heard of it you are probably thinking Transformers is for older kids. Well, let me tell you that is version is perfect for kids ages 3 and up. It features robots that transform into rescue vehicles like a police car, helicopter, fire truck, and a bulldozer. Their main objective is to protect town and people from bad situations instead of bad guys. So if you are worrying about violence and intensely scary situations you'll be pleased to know you won't find that in this show.

My son that's three and a half years has been all about the Rescue Bots for the last couple of weeks. Not a day has gone by when he hasn't been role playing with his toys the episodes he has seen He also has been going around singing the theme song and asking for Transformer coloring sheets (my fridge is literally covered in these robots). I'm really glad to be able to offer him wholesome entertainment and that it's available. It's totally geared for his age as he's growing up and wanting to see more big boy things but not obviously ready for a lot of the cartoons that are out there. It seemed like it happened over night that's he's been all about super heroes and robots!

On this DVD, there are five episodes with complete DVD runtime of 110 minutes. This DVD is following a few others but stands well with the stories on it's own, though I would recommending getting the entire collection. This DVD has a mystery theme so that makes it pretty fun for the month of October. Lots of events are going on that just don't make any sort of sense but the Rescue Bots are there to save the day!  the stories were written well and though there's a bit of spooky here and there, it's never frightening! Episode titles are:

Countdown
The Haunting Of Griffin Rock
Spellbound
Blame The Gremlins
Feed The Beast

I believe my son will be watching the Rescues Bots for awhile and even my 6 year old daughter likes to watch along side him. It's a great show that is full of fun, action, and positive themes! I highly recommend it!",1412812800,5,2151,4.491048593350383

I've done some research and the creators had the younger kids in mind when creating them. There's no harmful fighting or guns that do harm in the show or within the toys. Even the  villains aren't that bad. As an adult the shows are pretty good and have good clean humor. We can't wait till the new rescue bot academy comes out in 2019. Unlike a 2 yr old, after watching every episode over 20 times mommys are ready for some new ones",1503705600,,524,4.188118811881188
