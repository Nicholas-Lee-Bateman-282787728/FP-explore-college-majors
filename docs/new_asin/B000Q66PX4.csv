2829987,5,B000Q66PX4,"I bought this about 7 years ago and still watch it today! Beautifully animated with a timeless theme of good versus evil and Spawn's struggle for his own sense of self. His struggle to do the right thing is tempered with his underlying fear that he will ultimately give in to Malebolgia's bidding.

I truly wish they had finished this animated series. I was so diappointed when it was cancelled. I'm calling you out Todd! Do the right thing and finish it for us! Please!",1184025600,,470,4.529411764705882
2829988,5,B000Q66PX4,"I loved when this Series when it was on HBO for 3 series but then it was cancelled, and that was a shame right in the middle of the storyline, I was hoping that Todd Mcfarlane would've finished this series with a straight to DVD release but it never happened. It was a Great show the Animation was topic notch. Again hopefully one day they'll continue this series from where it left off.",1180569600,33,387,4.315068493150685

2830042,5,B000Q66PX4,"Love this show. It was canceled before its true final. This box set has all episodes in a steelbox. For some reason it won't play on my ps4 at all but will play on my xbox one s in 4:3  and on my ps3 in full screen. Ps3 has been my choice for watching this. Got it for 7.00+ used, great buy.",1503964800,,291,3.693548387096774

2830044,3,B000Q66PX4,Yeah they pretty much left us all hanging. In this last installment of spawn the animated series. I was really getting into it too and everything. Then: poof! No more episodes----damn.....,1503187200,,188,5.096774193548387
2830045,5,B000Q66PX4,"It is nice to have this 90's oddity on dvd. As much as it did wrong, it had it's own charms and sort of served as a great introduction to go read the comic. The transfer is not great but it could have been so much worse. It is dark and does not pull any punches.",1502323200,,262,3.6964285714285716
2830046,2,B000Q66PX4,"It was a bit campy, but what wasn't in the 90s? The thing that bothered me the most is that they just left it hanging. Three seasons, an intriguing story that introduced a new love interest lost to assassination, and then Al decides to fight for his humanity. *crickets* Nothing, nada, zilch. The voice acting is engrossing and well done, the story, albeit predictable and warps the Biblical view of Hell and the spiritual war that wages, is semi redeemable. However, don't expect any amount of closure. Seems the money dried up far before the animated blood shed. They just tossed it on the scrap heap just as the story was unfolding. There is talk of an R rated movie in the works and if you're looking for a bit of back story, this is entertaining and may answer some questions as to origin, character development and story arcs, but, again, no resolution or closure. I'm not much of a comic book buff in that they seem to be going the way of the SJW movement. Making protagonists gay or some sort of quasi-feminazi that objectifies herself for her own agenda, then complains like a petulant child when she perceives herself as being ""objectified"" (I guess giant jugs are inherently acceptable when utilized as sexually coherent as a means to an end). If they furthered the resolution via the graphically rendered page, like I said, I'm not interested. Maybe I'm jaded, but I care not to read how a woman wants to be viewed as a man, yet hates men and wants to be viewed as a woman. If they followed up on the story, great. Like I said, the SJW bend on the printed page is enough to make you want to puke. I bought the DVD set to essentially watch the beginning, the middle, and the end. They barely scratched the surface then pulled the plug. I went on a bit of a political tirade here, but it seems the vast majority backs my stance:",1502150400,2,1838,4.456973293768546

2830078,5,B000Q66PX4,"This set here is the complete 3 season,all 18 original rpisodes.in this 1 package.i remember when this show was on at night & I  used to watch it,and got hooked on the Spawn comics thereafter.buy I remember watching the film with my mom when it just came out. Anyways this is an awesome show,if anybody is a fan of the Spawn series,the film,the books,or the nostalgia behind a truly great show.it was ""vulgar"" so to speak,but it was raw & gritty. I dug it big time.my gf got this for me from Best buy but I wanted to post a review cuz this is an old-school show that was really,really cool to me as a kid. The artwork is amazing,the colors are dark & morbid but there perfect. Al Simmons fights to remember his past & his wife to realize 5 years passed & his best friend is now married to Wanda.they have a child together,Spawn saves the little girl Cyan,who constantly refers to him as the sad man . The pushers of substances have seemingly moved into the back alleys of rat city & there making it known,by taking out the down on their luck souls that harbor in rat city  Spawn offers up a sort of street justice,I hate this term but...Spawn is the perfect ""anti- hero""
The cops on these seemingly unconnected murders occurring in the back alleys is no coincidence,that's the thoughts of 1 pair of cops that everybody loves. Twitch is a genius. Anyways,this show is great.all the uncut episodes showing ultimate revenge & crazy sick violence and intense story. Just check it out & appreciate 1 rare gem.",1486339200,,1504,4.485401459854015
2830109,5,B000Q66PX4,Best show ever with every episode. Intros by Todd McFarlane. If only they could remaster it and release it on Blu-ray. It is how ever in 4:3,1484438400,,140,4.222222222222222
2830110,4,B000Q66PX4,"Loved the Spawn book/series.  It's a little disappointing that this is all we have for Spawn anime after twenty years.  The first season is really good, the second season gets a little lost, like the comic did early on. Would love to see another season that jumped to a more interesting story arc in the comic.  Regardless, if you're a spawn collector it's a must have.  If you're a casual fan prepare to love the beginning and then lose interest near the end.",1482019200,,460,4.506024096385542

2830115,4,B000Q66PX4,Good series but starts out kind of slow and doesn't actually have an ending.,1469404800,,76,4.5
2830116,5,B000Q66PX4,"It's awesome that they finally released a collection instead of the individual volumes of the past. This series is very dark and atmospheric with philosophical undertones. This is certainly not a superhero story. This is a grim tale of a man and his psyche, and his struggle with the transgressions of the past and the consequences of the present and future. Nice artwork and outstanding voice acting, this series has a way of drawing the viewer into an unhinged world that is fantastic and familiar all at the same time. It is unfortunate that this series ended so abruptly, however after each episode I was left with a strange feeling...hard to put a finger on what exactly it was but it left me thinking about it all even after it ended. And in this age predictable plots and never-ending used up tropes I find that to be a commendable accomplishment.",1468368000,4,854,4.7
2830117,5,B000Q66PX4,A great series... I wish it continued after spawn gotten Wanda pregnant.. Wanted to know what happens next...,1467244800,,109,5.111111111111111

2830149,5,B000Q66PX4,"This show is a perfect example of how this comic book character should be showcased. The show itself wastes no time bringing you into Spawn's savage world. It's a dark, gritty and cold hearted series with no boundaries. It's a shame HBO cancelled way too soon. Rented the first volume on video as kid and been a big fan since. Check it out.",1466380800,,340,4.412698412698413

2830155,5,B000Q66PX4,"Like I said before I haven't read the comics but I seen the movie spawn and enjoyed it. When I heard they released an animated series on HBO I decided to watch it. But I notice that this any ordinary animated series, it's actually for adults, it has graphic violence, strong language, sex, and nudity. Other than that it is a good show to watch I recommend it to any spawn or Todd McFarlane fans and I also liked it a lot better than the movie. I would totally not recommend Todd McFarlane's Spawn the animated series to children due to it's mature content, I would recommend ages 18 & up. Spawn the movie I give a 5.5/10 and spawn the animated series a 8.8/10. It's a great show to watch. It's too bad it ended for 3 seasons in 3 years. I hope Todd McFarlane  will make a revival series of Spawn.",1460505600,,797,4.209150326797386

Its also very close to the comics with that same theme from the comics which is Choice. Spawn is in the middle between Good and Evil and he must choose but he chooses his side. Warning though do not let your children see this it has Nudity and Blood and Gore.

2830451,5,B000Q66PX4,"Let me be clear on this: THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS as a matter of fact I would not let a child of mine watch this until they were at least 16 or 17 years of age at this age they can better understand why and how the violence is being used, at younger ages they may think that the violence and tales of hell are simply cool and try to emulate them in the real world where as we adults know this is not acceptable or good, I'm not saying this to scare anyone off it is very violent and STRICTLY FOR ADULTS. with that being said this is a excellent show very well written it plays like a movie (some say better than the 2005 live action movie of the same name, I would agree with that) the violence is there but not the main focal point it is the story that will draw you in, without giving too much away it is the story of a man who dies by the evil doings of his boss who goes to hell right at the moment of his death and makes a deal with a high ranking demon, the deal is he will do whatever the demon wants without question for a chance to go back to earth to be with his wife Wanda whom he loves very much, of course the demon has a trick up his sleeve, true to his word the demon sends Al Simmons back to earth but it is five years later and Al doesn't know who or what he is and Wanda has moved on with her life married his best friend and had a child! Wow talk about your sad and deep story, but it is not a story of revenge it is about Al coping with the deal that he was dealth and becoming something more than HELLSPAWN! I would also like to say that the violence is not just thrown in or random it has a purpose for every violent act there is a reason why it is done (this is what helps the story be so good) the animation is excellent dark and gritty lots of shadow and most of the story takes place at night(sorta reminds me of Sin City the movie) dialogue is hard lots of cussing but again that is not what this is about, it has a point: to carry the story along, I can not say enough good about this series except get it you will not be sorry that you did it sells for $26 I got lucky and got it for $11.93 from a msg. From Amazon telling me about the reduced price, comes in a really cool steel book case with Todd McFarland art(the Creator of spawn) all over it shipping was fast 3 days b4 due date all around excellent purchase, I would only recommend this to adults.",1379462400,2,2379,3.877049180327869

Like some animes it can be wordy and lack some action sequences which is fine by me. just beware that this is not a battle royal series, and I think this anime would of done a bit better with more intense battles sequences.",1366934400,,432,4.034883720930233
2830541,5,B000Q66PX4,"As a child, Spawn was one of the first superheroes I ever became interested in to the point I went out of my way yo buy and read the comics (even though I definitely should not have, seeing as this is NOT FOR KIDS!!!). Unfortunately, I got rid of most of them and it has been years since I caught up with the Spawn universe. Having read up online about what is going on with this forgotten but excellent franchise, and remaining confused as to what happened to Al Simmons in the recent comics, I decided to start from issue one(which goes for ridiculously cheap in local comic book stores), and got hooked. I picked up Spawn Origins Volume 1, the first volume of a superior reprint of the comic series in trade paperback form, and became even more hooked! With it, I decided to buy this, Spawn the Animated Collection, as I remembered it as being disturbing and wondered how the series ""ended"".

So I then decided to read more of the Origins comics (plus issue 10), which are all shipping now, as my biggest gripe with this show is that HBO cancelled it right as things in the story were kicking on to full force. I would love to see a continuation of this, or for Todd McFarlane to FINALLY deliver on a Spawn movie/cartoon reboot (Don't bother seeing the PG-13 movie, it sucks.). But until then, we have the comics and this show, and good God, that is one hell of a body of work.

This show, like the comic, follows the post mortem existence of Al Simmons, a former CIA assassin murdered by a former partner while on a mission. As he died, he was condemned to hell for all eternity; a concept that tore at Al solely because he would never see his beloved wife Wanda again. In his desperation to at least get to see her again, Al strikes a deal with Malebolgia, the ruler of the Eighth circle of Hell, so that he may return to earth in a new form if he will become a Hellspawn, a soul harvester for Hell. However, this deal as you imagine is not so clear cut, and Al painfully learns the consequences of his actions. In the twisted deal with Satan, Simmons, as Spawn, decides that he does not have to be Hell's puppet. This makes Spawn the target of the fury that the forces of Hell can bring, along with a Heaven who denounces his existence, and a cruel dark world full of animalistic thieves, murderers, rapists, etc.

As simple of a plot as this seems, note I am omitting ALOT as to not spoil any major surprises. Generally, Spawn is a tale about how a man cursed by hell to be a catalyst for mass chaos instead uses his powers to fight the hell on earth rotten hearted evil humans bring in life. Hell responds by sending agents such as the Clown, a vile, creepy, disgusting overweight hobo clown with demonic power, to constantly ridicule Spawn's terrible situation, create problems by aiding his earthly enemies, and even by transforming into his demon form and trying to kill him on occasion. Hell also tortures his mind, mainly with the fact that life moved on without him after he died. Not only so, but Heaven goes to extreme measures to hunt him down, and the corrupt/criminal element on Earth which he causes more and more problems for becomes increasingly threatening to him or the people for whom he protects. Spawn, while being a creature from hell with extraordinarily strong powers, still has remnants of a heart, which still bounds him to his morals, even in his horrid situation.

The most important thing I find that kills or makes a cartoon is how well it is animated. This is not essential for me always, as Aqua Teen Hunger Force, South Park, Beavis and Butthead, and even Samurai Jack were not the best drawn shows on television, but they worked because of their unique stylization and great story telling. However, for something like spawn or a Super Hero show in general, bad animation can kill it, especially if the comics are beautifully drawn. In the case of Spawn specifically, you will find that, while Todd McFarlane can go a bit overboard in exaggerating the expression of movement or size (especially in capes and with Spider Man's loose webbing before he did Spawn). This ruins it for some people, as there is no logical reason to do this, but for me it is the opposite: I love how his work is not subtle, but rather kicks you in the face with the style. It is also very well drawn too. The same rings true for this series in general, as you can definitely see McFarlane's influence in the animation efforts. Spawn has the huge cape, but in his case, there is a reason for it, as it moves with his suit as a symbiotic being attached to him. The objects in this show are so well drawn, and  most noticeably, the scale of the show seems so realistic for a fictional cartoon. Characters come to life and action becomes intense when animation is this good. It is much better than Dragonball's animation (another show I like with not the best drawing), as it hardly had the evident scale issues or misdrawn portions DB had at times. The only thing some may take issue to is the heavy use of blacks and shadow in this show; to which I say it is Spawn, and if you ever read the book, you would get that it just helps create the brooding atmosphere of the comic.

The voice acting is great on all ends, as you may recognize Spawn's voice as Keith David, the voice of Goliath from Disney's Gargoyle. THIS is how I always pictures Spawn sounding, though oddly enough, it was his voice during flashbacks as Al Simmons too, which I always thought maybe should have been different, but that is knit-picking. The voice cast also includes a great performance from Richard Drysart as Colgiostro, an old man with mysterious knowledge of Spawn's predicament, with John Rafter Lee as the devious Jason Wynn, Al's former CIA superior, Dominique Jennings playing a very believable Wanda Blake, Al's wife, and so many others. However, Micheal Nicolosi's performance as the menacing Clown is esspecially excellent, and similar to Keith David as Spawn, exactly how you would imagine this evil creature to sound like: extremely disturbed and disturbing, an agent of Hellish chaos, a murder and violence fetishist, a menace, and a putrid evil. It blows my mind how good it is. The music is great too, and at times of great suspense or mental horror, it adds to the emotions it intends to bring out of the viewer.

However, there are few (and I mean few) negatives. For one, this story is not 100% accurate with the comic, and I will leave it at that. Some characters are newly introduced, and some events happen before they are supposed to, after, or not at all. However, this is a minor issue in my opinion, as it still remains the most true representation of the comic in video, and some of the changes, I feel, were improvements. With Todd McFarlane producing this series, and even giving an introduction to every episode in a Rod Serling-esque fashion, you know it is at least accurate enough, far beyond what the movie achieved. Also... once again... it just ends. No finale, no answers, it just ends on a cliffhanger. So, it you are troubled by that, just read the comics from issue one or don't bother with this show. Yet, if you can look past this small issue, you will find a crown jewel of Super Hero animation as good as Batman the Animated Series from the 90's was, but more adult with a unique depth and feeling to it's animation style and subject matter.

Believe me, for ten dollars, even though it ends abruptly, this will be one of the best purchases you could make to add to your DVD collection. And while I originally wanted to give this a 4.5 because of the minor issues, it truly deserves 5 stars still for being a shining example of what dramatic and intense adult animation should be, even if it does get somewhat immature at times, shows nudity, and has some foul mouthed dialogue. It isn't the ""bad words"" or ""naked ladies"", or even the ""kick ass"" blood and gore"" that makes this a good show, it is how damn well it is done with regards to what Spawn is supposed to be, a dark Superhero tale with elements of Psychological thrill thrown in.

5/5; I recomend you get this today or watch it somehow as soon as possible! If you are like me, you will be hooked and disappointed when it ends. I also recommend the comic series if you want to see what was not included in the show's limited run.",1366243200,6,8322,4.487788778877888

It wraps up with lots of behind the scenes stuff with McFarlane himself and the set is an absolute steal at this price. Note that a lot of box sets range from 40 to 80 dollars, which I probably would've payed for this if I had no other choice. If you never caught this on HBO when it aired, this is very true to the comic books. I will be fair and admit what some lower rated reviews claimed, the show does boast that it is an ""adult cartoon"" by showing lots of sexual content and explicit violence, but in a way that's kind of what comic books do, especially Spawn. A movie fan need not like comics to get into this and a comic fan doesn't have to like animation, this is in its purest form a watchable comic book. Love it or hate it Todd McFarlane created the most legendary anti-superheroes of all time and this animated series does his work great justice. And if you wanna go a step above, also purchase the album Dark Saga by Iced Earth, it is a metal album they wrote to go with this essentially and it so kicks ass.",1341705600,,1084,4.1913875598086126

2830643,5,B000Q66PX4,"Well after suffering the old collection of the show for years and I was never really able to sit through the whole thing due to the format on the old discs due to the combination of it not being broken up by episode and the horrible flipdisc format they used on the media, I really missed this show and heard about how great a treatment it got in the 10th Anniversary set, I thought the price was pretty agreeable and decided to pick it up. The picture is improved big time and the new proper 5.1 sound mix is really good too, it really brings out the creep factor that I think was always intended in the shows sound design it gave it a lot more of a mood then I was ever used to it having, but in a positive way. I watched this show as it aired on HBO and then watched the VHS recordings I'd made then moved on to the old DVD set and this 10th anniversary edition is quite definitive so far as the quality of the picture, sound and packaging is concerned. I still thought they skimped a little on special features, it could have stood to have commentary on every episode, there are only 18 and as it stands there are only four commentary tracks on each season premier episode and then the final episode. They did include a whole bonus disc that had some neat stuff and I think some other stuff just to have on the back of the packaging as a special feature.

It's been a while since I can recall a DVD collection of episodic television that was this well rounded for optimum ease of viewing, you can watch by episode or choose to play all they also have the entire DVD broken down in a separate menu by sections in the story. Selecting an episode from the one-at-a-time menu prompts you to another menu that features a brief synopsis of the episode which is nice for tracking down a particular episode you wanted to see, I wish more DVD sets of TV shows had this included in them.

The packaging and disc artwork are just beautiful everything I liked about the show and it's style that was based on the first 20 issues of the comic book. The only thing I didn't like about the packaging was the clips that hold the discs, they are a real pain to get the disc off of and then a couple of them snapped under the slightest pressure. I've never seen insets like this before and I have a lot of DVD's, I don't know why they didn't just go with a more standard form makes me worry that someday my discs will just be floating around the case unsecured.

This is a very dark both in content and artistic style show that moves very slowly at whats often a really sludgy pace. For a cartoon about a comic book super hero there really isn't much action and after the first three or four episodes it really doesn't follow the comic books at all and instead segues off into it's own contained story line apart from the comics. I don't really consider this to be a bad thing in any way I just thought I'd mention it for anyone reading who hasn't seen the show. Each episode is directed in a gothic horror style, like a monster movie where the monster is never seen all the way. I think throughout the whole course of the show you never once get a good look at Spawn, he's always obscured in a shadow or by his cloak. It's an interesting way to go about it, it's also beautifully voice acted by all involved Keith David is incredible as Spawn and everyone else is really well realized as well.",1299024000,2,3379,4.235658914728682
2830644,1,B000Q66PX4,"In truth, I was never a fan of the comic book when I was younger.  I am guessing that this is how views of the animated Spawn series break down; fans will likely love it, and those who are merely curious will likely not.  I am in the latter category.  I cannot deny that the animation is simply stunning - it takes Batman: The Animated Series and brings it to an adult level, with an epic level of shadow and mood.  But that is all that Todd McFarlane's Spawn: The Animated Collection has going for it.  The defects are threefold in my mind.  First, the story telling is so painfully slow, especially on the first disk, that one wonders where - if anywhere - the writers were.  There is almost no action in the series, although there is a tremendous amount of violence - too much, in my mind, and the excess is only one of several indicators of the considerable lack of imagination that drove the series.  The other evidences of this lack are the fairly extensive profanity and the nudity.  It's like the writers, when in doubt about what to say or do, simply deployed these instead.  Please understand that I do not offer these as a moral critique but, instead, as an intellectual one.  These cartoons have the intellectual depth of rap music, which I find that incredibly annoying.  Adult cartoons should be intelligent, sharp, and challenging.  Spawn is none of that.  Second, but related to this, I follow comic books on occasion and I think that it is interesting that around 2000 there were various debates about whether or not comic books were too violent and whether or not the golden age of comic heroes had truly been buried amidst a torrent of excessively violent and ultimately classless narratives.  (This sort of critique took form in various comics, particularly the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdom-Come/dp/1401220347/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdom Come</a>&nbsp;series.)  Spawn fits this sort of critique fully.  He is less of an antihero and more of an immensely selfish figure who doesn't really care about the suffering and pain of others as he is too stuck on his own tragedy (perceived and real).  In other words, there is nothing compelling here, let alone ennobling, on a human level.  Finally, it seems that the series ended too early; the third disk ends with Spawn finally willing to do whatever he needs to do in order to regain his humanity.  Thus, three disks of 18 total episodes, totaling nearly nine hours of animation are, in effect, merely a tediously long origins story.  Combine this with a soundtrack that sounds like something out of a really bad B-movie and one is left with something that only fans will likely love.",1298073600,16,2711,4.914285714285715
2830645,5,B000Q66PX4,"Spawn: The Animated Series. What can I say about this stellar show?

I greatly enjoyed all three seasons. If you consider yourself to be well acclimated to what was known in the 1990s as ""cutting edge"" animation, you owe it to yourself to see (and purchase) this series.

Having grown up on Batman: The Animated Series and JLU in the late 90s and early part of the last decade, I had a certain picture in my head of what a superhero show could/should be. I had read some trade paperbacks of the old comics of Spawn, and I was never particularly impressed. Suffice it to say, the stories and artwork in this series blow both the comics and the abysmal live-action film from '97 out of the water. Spawn is this deep, black, red and green shadow, an urban legend, the stuff of nightmares. The pure gothic horror of this show is even more impressive with this remastered DVD. You can hear the chains snap and twist, sense the wind blowing through the shroud, feel the burning anger, sadness, and torment behind Spawn's glowing gaze...it was for me as an adult what Batman TAS was for me as a child.

The first season mainly covers Spawn's origin (if you're reading this, you probably have a good idea of the history of the character) and shows who the main antagonists will be. There is a very touching scene at the end involving Spawn and the daughter of his widow, Wanda Blake. I actually cried watching it.

The second season ups the ante with a government conspiracy and delves into a bit of social commentary.

The third and final season ends with a bit of a cliffhanger and brings the supernatural aspects of Spawn's world into more focus. My personal favorite episode is ""Hunter's Moon,"" in which Spawn fights a craved female vampire.

The voice acting is superb. Keith David (Goliath from Gargoyles) does an excellent job as the titular character, and Ming-Na Wen (the voice of Dr. Aki Ross in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within) plays a Celestial Bounty Hunter.

All in all, this is one of the few shows that I haven't downloaded or watched online. It's THAT good. The only things I've seen that even come close to this would be the aforementioned Batman TAS/DCAU series or some anime such as Ghost In The Shell or Cowboy Bebop. Comic fans should definitely get it, as well as any fan of truly ""adult"" animation. I will say that there is a lot of blood and gore, especially in the first season. Special features are...decent. There's an extended interview with Todd McFarlane, the creator of Spawn, as well as a few featurettes on the making of the show.

I highly recommend this DVD.",1296604800,,2588,4.586580086580087
2830646,5,B000Q66PX4,"Completely unlike the feature film, ""Todd McFarlane's Spawn"" is a gritty, violent, and immensely mature Emmy Award winning animated television series that is absolutely awesome! The series is far more graphic than both the comic book and the film, and features terribly bloody scenes of violence, sexual scenes, nudity, and extensive use of profanity. However, it's exquisitely entertaining and offers a unique re-telling of Spawn's adventures prior to the ""Armageddon"" comic book storyline (though many elements are absent, such as major villains). The series lasted eighteen episodes/three seasons over the course of two years.

The story begins with Al Simmons' return from Hell, though he is completely oblivious as to what has happened in the past five years. It becomes known to Simmons that he made a deal with the demon Malebolgia to return to Earth so he can see his beloved wife, Wanda, one last time. However, as payment for this deal, Simmons must pledge himself to servitude under Hell, and is turned into a Hellspawn, a vicious creature designed to lead Hell's armies. Upon his return from Hell, he soon uncovers the secrets of his demise and what has happened in his abscence, and is faced with many decisions which will turn him either into the greatest anti-hero of all time, or the greatest villain that Earth has ever seen. Also in the series, you spend a lot of time with the detective duo Sam Burke and Maximillian ""Twitch"" Williams as they attempt to unfold the mystery behind a series of murders that occured in the mysterious Rat City alleys.

The product is packaged in a sleek case featuring some fantastic artwork! This is definitely the evilest animated series I have ever seen, but is one of the best animated series I've ever seen too. With it's surprisingly skilled voice acting, clever story, and spine-chilling drama tone, you'll be absolutely stunned with this jaw-dropping animated epic.

It is so hard to follow, there is something silly and trite about it.  ""WHY DID YOU BUY IT THEN, YOU IDIOT?"" I know, right... well I got one of the very first SPAWN action figures when McFarlane first introduced the toy line. My step father bought it for me and I was so young, I didn't know what I had and I took the toy apart.  YES... I know, I took the toy out of the packaging and played with it. I made a few adjustments to the toy as well, so that it would suit my childhood imagination.

NE Way, I cannot say that I am a ""fan"" of SPAWN, I think the whole concept of a man dying and making a deal with ""The Devil"" and coming back all jacked up and powerful is really interesting.  I was really excited to see that an animated series like this came out and so I didn't hesitate, I was positive that I would love it. My step father was excited about a comic series that was predominately casted with Black Characters... imagine his surprise when he saw the creator, LOL.

So far it is not BAD, but it is kind of slow and difficult to follow.  I am hoping that the whole thing is not limited to that damn alley.  I want to see more demons, more ""Devil"" and more of that creepy forbidden stuff thats make the show rated R -I do not mean cartoon nudity. I mean that dark, Anton LeVay type stuff.  So please, anyone out there, please hit me up, and give me a pep-talk.  Tell me that the show gets better.

Also, upon purchase, I realized that Eric Rodomski who did a lot of work on Batman: The Animated Series, did a lot of work on the Spawn animated series too.

This is the official dvd release. Seems like there are a lot of extras.

I am only one episode in on this collection, but I am already very happy with it.

I'm not an extraordinarily picky person, but the only reason I gave this review a 4 star rather than a 5 is because the tin case had a couple of hard dents in the back. When I buy DVD's, I'm pretty picky about the packaging.
I kinda have this complex about packaging, like, I could download almost anything, but I don't. To a lot of people, DVD purchasing is a waste of money. As far as I'm concerned, one of the greatest reasons for purchasing DVD's is for the packaging. Otherwise, everyone might as well just download.
So, if I'm gonna pay money, the packaging/case, had better be in excellent condition.

I do give this some lenience due to the fact that it came in the mail.

Keep in mind this was a comic book series so not every single nuisance of the comic books are in the TV series, so if you want the full experience and background of characters, get those. In spite of some things being lost in translation, this is a solid series that broke ground when it was released and really paved the way for animation to become more mainstream and available to an adult audience.

Sure, the basic plot elements remain from the comic, but while the comic focused on the usual action storylines, the animated series is a great character driven drama.  While there is plenty of action, it is the characters and story that are the focus of the series.

This remastering of these 18 episodes look great and sound even better with the 5.1 Surround Sound.  The special features are decent, but nothing new.

2830679,5,B000Q66PX4,"I was just a kid when the theatrical ""Spawn"" movie came out, but even then I could tell that the film just didn't live up to the idea; it was all popcorn explosions and CGI demons, devoid of substance.  A few years later, towards the end of high school, I came across the prior boxset release of this show.  Knowing it was well-reviewed, I decided to give it a try.

""Todd McFarlane's Spawn"" is the opposite of the theatrical film, delving deeply into the psychology of this Hellspawn and his struggle between damnation and redemption.  The writing is subversive, alternately witty and utterly creepy; the animation is fluid and richly detailed; the voice-acting superb, with Keith David's Spawn and John Rafter Lee's Jason Wynn as the clear highlights of the cast.  Whether you're into comics, fantasy, film noir, or even simply well-written stories, I would recommend giving this show a watch.

And now it's even better on this anniversary box set.  In the original release, each season of the show was edited together to form one two-and-a-half hour long movie; this would be daunting under normal circumstances, but for a show this bleak it's quite an achievement to get through.  Even worse, the films were presented on both sides of a ""flipper"" disc, increasing the danger of scratches.  Fortunately, this anniversary set presents all 3 seasons broken up into their individual episodes on a one-sided dual-layered disc, making for a much more palatable viewing experience (die-hards need not fear, however -- there's still a ""play all"" option on the menu).  The visuals are improved with truer blacks and more vibrant colors, and the audio has been upgraded to 5.1 surround from Dolby stereo.  Extras include commentary tracks from McFarlane on selected episodes, and a handful of featurettes on a fourth disc.  All this is included in a very attractive steelbook case featuring the pictured artwork at the top of the Amazon page.

Very highly-recommended for a first-time viewer, and if any owner of the previous set is on the fence about upgrading, I believe that it's more than worth the increased quality and convenience offered in this new set.",1231200000,93,2155,4.969359331476323

2830722,5,B000Q66PX4,The episodes are awesome and I'm glad HBO showed this so it could be as violent as it is. Cartoons are so much better that way. Price was really good. Post office takes way to long to deliver but thats not Amazons fault.,1217808000,2,220,4.1395348837209305
2830723,5,B000Q66PX4,"This is the best animated series ever produced.  You don't have to know anything about Spawn to enjoy this.  It is however, in my opinion for adults.  It aired in the evenings on HBO.  It's quite violent and also has sex scenes, you might want to be aware of this if you are thinking of ordering this for a young child.  The series is the best interpretation of the comic story ever released.  The movie was meant for a wider audience and as a fan of the comic book, I thought it was complete trash.  This animated series is a must for anyone who likes super heroes and enjoys a good story.  This really is a unique study of ""good"" and ""evil"".  It really demonstrates how thin the line can become between the two.  Spawn is a unique character and this is a very complex story.  It's fantastic and is presented here in only the way HBO could afford McFarlane to do.  Interested in knowing about Spawn but not interested in comics?  Get this series.  A fan of Spawn and never seen this? Shame on you!!",1215302400,2,999,4.301075268817204
2830724,5,B000Q66PX4,"Pulling heavily from the influences of anime, Spawn is a good treatment of the material.  The first few story arcs in the comic Spawn were original, challenging, and complex.  (Over time the comic would lose that aspect as they never altered the premise, which is finite.)  But for a finite story, the animated Spawn is for adults what Batman: The Animated Series is for young folks (not to say it is not awesome for adults, I have all 4 seasons on DVD).  The animation is smooth, voice acting strong... particularly Keith David who has had a successful and long carreer based on his talents... and the show is put together in such a way that anyone who likes animation could enjoy.
I wish the live-action movie had been half as strong as the animated series.",1210809600,,759,4.6
2830725,5,B000Q66PX4,"I never saw the Animated Series when it aired on television but my friend gave me his used version. I saw it and liked it so much I went out to buy the re-release with the metal box casing. I recommend anybody who likes characters who struggle with their inner demons yet come out on top in the end to buy this re-release. I'm glad I wasted every penny I had on this just to add it to my DVD collection. I'm a little disappointed with the way things ended but since Todd is bringing the series back in a new light, I am hoping he does justice to it. It won't be as good as this HBO version but if  it is delivered expertly, maybe all the fans will overlook the incomplete HBO series. Bottom line: GET IT!!!",1201737600,,706,4.079136690647482

Why is this set flawless, well let's see you've got the steel case, 4 discs, all 18 episodes, the extras, and of course the great series itself for less than 30 bucks.  Just the series itself is worth it for it's awesome story, flawless animation, good voice acting, dialogue, etc. Ok, so you think I'm making this sound to good to be true, well ok yes McFarlane didn't finish the series, but hey it's worth it  while it lasts and Spawn like most comic book characters, is ongoing.

A unique adult animated fantasy-horror-action series with excellent animation especially around the second and third seasons with some excellent voice acting by John Dystrat (""The Thing""), Ming Na Wen, John Rafter Lee (""Aeon Flux The Series"" and ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust""), Ronny Cox, James Hong, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Robert Forster, Eric Roberts, and Kurtwood Smith (""Robocop"").

8194202,5,B000Q66PX4,"You see a dark alleyway filled with only homeless souls who have nowhere to go. As you make your way towards the fire to stay warm, you hear the piercing screams of a someone on their last breath  a gunshot is heard. The scream stops. You know that another poor, unfortunate soul has been taken. Then, you hear a second scream, but not of a man begging for his life, knowing that he won't receive his wish, but of a criminal who is scared, nay, terrified by what his eyes show him. A dark creature of night, with a dark red shroud that flows with him, slowly approaches him with his green eyes filled with rage and fury. Lightning flashes, blinding his view for a moment, and chains come out of the darkness and wrap around the criminal, choking him as he now screams for mercy. The scream stops. Later, you walk to that same alley and see the remains of the two victims. The first has only a gunshot wound to the face  deadly, but quick and painless. The second, however, had a more gruesome ordeal, with blood splattered over the ground and walls, a neck twisted, bones broken, and no signs of a visible struggle  he had no chance. You cant help but wonder what happened. Hiding above in the shadows is a creature from Hell, who is referred to as Spawn.

 Todd McFarlanes Spawn is an HBO animated show that originally ran from 1997 to 1999, where it garnered acclaim for its mature storytelling, gruesome violence, stunning animation, and dark atmosphere that gave the series its own unique personality. Having recently finished the three-season show (a total of only 18 episodes), I can assure you that all of those things hold true. This is NOT a childrens superhero show  if my introduction didn't already tell you, its like Batman, but much darker. The series deals with Al Simmons, a former government soldier who has been resurrected as a Hellspawn after making a deal with Malebolgia (similar to making a deal with the Devil)  he would be revived so long as he can see his wife, Wanda. Since this is Hell we are talking about, this of course doesnt turn out as Al/Spawn expects. The core of the shows plot and structure revolves around Spawns internal struggle for what he is supposed to do. He is supposed to be a soldier for Malebolgia, but he doesnt care about his deal  he just wants to be with his wife. Seeing as how he no longer has his original body (he has permanently burned skin and is constantly shrouded with a long cloak), he cant just waltz up to her, not to mention the fact that she has now remarried (and has a daughter with this new man) and Spawn can barely remember his past life. Fragments of his life return every now and then, but he is far from complete. Thats the main premise of the show, but theres more to it than that.

 Along with the story of Spawn, the plot also interweaves other elements into it as well, including exploring Wandas life (and her husband, Terry), a mysterious businessman named Jason Wynn (also the employer of Terry), and the detective/cop duo of Sam and Twitch. While all of these intermixed stories have their moments (John Rafter Lees sinister portrayal of Wynn alone makes him a fascinating character to watch), my favorite by far is the Sam and Twitch storyline. They start their role in the story by finding slaughtered bodies in a dark alley, which are partially the result of Spawn. They have ongoing-investigations throughout the entirety of the show and its interesting to see them hypothesize about who is causing these murders and what to make of it. Its a simple set-up, but it works so well because they have great chemistry together.

Their relationship is simple, but really well-developed and presented. Sam is the large guy who likes donuts and can hold his own on the force  he has a good heart despite his ruff n tuff attitude (he very much reminds me of Harvey Bullock from Batman: The Animated Series, which Ill bring up again later). Twitch, on the other hand, is more timid and reserved; hes essentially the brains of the duo and carefully analyzes the crime scenes (usually correctly), but just like his partner, he can more than hold his own, too  hes also the king of quips (at one point he says something to Sam along the lines of Yes, sir, your inability to shoot is clearly the guns fault). They might not appear all that great right away, but by the end of the show, I was wanting to see more and more of them than Spawn himself. Easily my favorite characters in the show

Despite having great side characters, the main character is Spawn and (for the most part) he is a solid lead. Keith David completely nails the voice of Spawn, providing a demonic voice of death that would scare the sh*t out of anyone unlucky enough to make him angry, but whats most impressive is not when Spawn is angry at criminals or other people, but himself. It is during these rage-filled scenes that David lets out roars of anguish that really shows how well he suits this role  marvelous casting, really. As for the character himself, hes pretty interesting, not just as a bad guy beater, but as a man who feels like hes lost everything. If I had to offer a couple complaints, one would be that he moans throughout the entire show  there is very little development for him. I thought that by the end of the first season (episode six), he had changed a little, but by the time I started the next episode, I realized that I was wrong. I think that what is most annoying is how he just lets innocents die  granted, Spawn is not supposed to be a hero, but his character feels very inconsistent because it seems like multiple times throughout the show he has decided to start protecting people, or at least the people he stays with (the homeless in the alleys), but nope; sometimes, he is willing to protect them, sometimes he lets them die. Its a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things, but it bugged me nonetheless. Still, as a whole, Al Simmons-turned-Spawn is an interesting character brought to life by a magnificent performance from Keith David.

If I had to mention one last major thing about the show, it would be the atmosphere. This show handles atmosphere and mood better than almost any other show I have ever seen  its dark color palette provides an ominous feeling for the viewer and allows for careful use of lighting not possible in brightly-colored shows. This all adds to the overall noir-tone of the show (especially seen with Sam and Twitch) and I think that the reason it worked so well is because the supervising director of the show is none-other than Eric Radomski, who co-created Batman: The Animated Series (along with Bruce Timm), which was notable for his dark deco style in that show (they painted on black backgrounds to give that show its own unique atmosphere). I cant say for certain how exactly they designed this show, but I feel confident in saying that Radomski was key factor in it and I applaud the work that was done. Speaking of Batman: The Animated Series, Shirley Walker, who composed music for that show, also composes for this show and does a wonderful job at continuing the dark tone established by the mature storylines and visuals. Her music is almost operatic in form  not in the sense that it is only choirs singing, but in that it makes you feel like you're watching something epic, more than just a comic-book show. Her work was impressive in Batman and it shines here as well.

Todd McFarlanes Spawn is an excellent example of how far comic-book adaptations can go when put in the proper hands and treated with the proper respect. Certainly, it is not perfect  sometimes the plot feels like its not going anywhere and it gets a little muddled towards the ending (it also doesnt have a clear ending  I think that it was cancelled, unfortunately), along with the inconsistent characterization of the lead  but the pros far outweigh the cons. The voicework is great throughout, the interweaving plots work well (especially for Sam and Twitch), and it is a perfect example of how to create a mesmerizing atmosphere by combining solid writing, fantastic visuals, and dramatic music. I strongly recommend the show and, as Todd McFarlane would say at the end of some of his openings (he does these cool live-action segments at the beginning of every episode and I love them), And now, Spawn. So, turn off your lights.",1524960000,,8338,4.595558546433378
