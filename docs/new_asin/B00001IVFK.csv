1244283,5,B00001IVFK,"It would be totally inadequate for this reviewer to say that NOT FOR OURSELVES ALONE:The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton & Susan B. Anthony is simply a ""must-see"",""well done"",""moving"",""dramatic"",""compelling""etc.etc. documentary of the two forgers of the early Woman's Suffrage Movement. This Ken and Paul Burns treatise has been so carefully,sensitively and lovingly handled,crafted and assembled that I was moved to anger,incredulity,sympathy,action and finally to just good ol'tears!

NOT FOR OURSELVES ALONE tells in vivid detail, based upon the enormous source material and writings and correspondence of the two amazing women of the 19th -century,Cady Stanton and Anthony, who almost in a battle alone, fought tirelessly for the equality and dignity and rights of all women to receive and exercise their rights as they saw guaranteed to them under the United States Constitution and The Decalration of Independence. These two pioneers maintained an endearing fifty year friendship,endured hardships,misunderstandings,trials,boos-and-jeers,and the sometime opposition of their own sex as well as the opposite sex AND race, and above all ,totally opposite lifesyles and temperaments in order to join faculties to push for what they themselves NEVER saw in their own lifetime...the 19th Amendment guaranteeing the woman's right to vote. Without these two women, much legislation that all of us now accept to be totally understood ,would never be in law today. The Burns Brothers have created an absolute masterpiece,running for 210 totally absorbing minutes minutely detailing how these two women met,how they were alike and unalike,and how their neverending faith and trust in each other and their common-held beliefs was the ultimate key for those women of the following generation to complete the task of gaining equal rights for all women. This is a very typical Burns format for his PBS documentaries complete with voiceovers,historian interviews,still tintypes. Where this particular documentary really succeeds above the other Burns' PBS features is the tender and deliciously sensitive narrative that has been scripted to tell Stanton and Anthony's story. This is a very absorbing piece of art that all peoples would greatly benefit from viewing. It is more than informational...it is life-giving. These were the women who ""sowed winter wheat for others to harvest"".They were ""the women who worked miracles!""",1177545600,,2418,5.661157024793388
1244284,4,B00001IVFK,"This three hour film covered everything you ever wanted to know about the suffrage movement.  It was another excellent Ken Burns effort.  I liked the way it was divided up into chapters.  I'm teaching a women's history class and had a limited amount of time for a film (1 hour).  So I was able to show their early life, twenty years later and the conclusion of the suffrage struggle by selecting certain chapters.  I would highly recommend this film for any women's history buff.",1128211200,2,479,4.654761904761905
1244285,5,B00001IVFK,"I saw this brilliant and beautiful documentary when it was aired on public television and while it has been readily available on VHS, I have been holding out for a DVD.  Finally the long wait is over!  The only thing that surprises me is that it wasn't offered on DVD earlier.  This isn't just some angry feminist rant or emotional tirade against men--the suffragist movement is dealt with as the historical event it actually was, and this documentary goes in-depth with historical details, letters, photos, and even comments from very old women who were just young women when they voted in the first-ever election in which women could vote.  After seeing this for the first time, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, one of the unsung heroes and leaders of the suffragist movement, became one of my heroes, and I immediately sought out a copy of ""The Woman's Bible"".  I have been returning to Amazon over and over, checking to see if this was on DVD yet, and it had gotten to the point where I didn't hold out much hope that I would find it.  I can't begin to describe how excited I am over this!",1051142400,14,1084,4.561855670103093
1244286,5,B00001IVFK,"And I've seen a LOT of video documentaries!
I always thought of myself as somewhat well-informed on the topic of American History, but I knew virtually nothing about these two incredible women.
Their friendship, the beautiful blending of their unique gifts to create one stupendous and powerful whole of a suffrage movement, their dedication and devotion - all these elements combined to make this story perfectly wonderful.
I borrowed the video from our local library, but I think I need to buy it. I've watched it twice and wept tears of joy and gratitude at these womens' sacrifice and unselfish labors for all womankind. It is a delight to watch.
I just had no idea women had to fight so hard and so long to be granted a basic human right like voting.
And Elizabeth's ""best"" lecture, ""The Solitude of Self"" was one of the most powerful essays I've ever heard. Very stirring and inspiring. Even the [background] music was superior.
This video will not leave you where it found you. Should be required viewing for everyone. Period.",973123200,31,1033,4.808988764044944
1244287,5,B00001IVFK,Both men and women need to understand where human rights were once and how far they have progressed at the sacrifice of the very few during the past 150 years.  This is classic Ken Burns offering his unique kind of  perspective.  I am giving this to my niece who will soon be leaving home as  a young woman.  I hope EVERYONE in her family - both male and female - will  view this tape since both sexes need to better understand what women have  faced and continue to face in making meaningful lives through their own  talents and abilities.  If nothing else this video exemplifies courage and  determination in the finest and yet most human sense.,945129600,23,647,4.5
1244288,5,B00001IVFK,This film is truly a must-see.  I was appalled at how little I knew about this remarkable and significant history.  It is inspiring to see these women struggle for basic human rights. It is moving to hear about the  tremendous friendship between Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.  It is amazing to hear the words of one of the most provocative and profound  writers in our nation's history (Stanton). (How can her works be so  unknown! ) It is informative to learn about this very momentous period in  American history. Bravo for Ken Burns. This film fills a void in our  understanding of American history. Plus it is a very riveting story.,943920000,16,651,4.699115044247788
1244289,5,B00001IVFK,"Yes, this is my very first ever purchase of a video. If you watched the PBS telecast earlier this month, the experience speaks for itself. Director Ken Burns has done his usual magnificent job of capturing and examining a  piece of history. Whether you're interested in the history of the women's  movement, the personal stories of Anthony and Stanton, or just enjoy old  photos and film there's something for you here. As an added plus, if you  've lived in or visited western NY, you might see some familiar places--the  Susan B. Anthony House, Genesee Country Museum, and various other sites in  Seneca Falls.",943747200,10,612,4.836538461538462
1244290,5,B00001IVFK,"I watched this on PBS the other night and it's terrific.  I was brought up by a feminist mother, who made sure that I knew the history of the struggle  for women's rights.  Nonetheless, there were so many things in this  documentury that I had never known.  The relationship between Elizabeth  Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony is fascinating.  Anthony was so tough,  and Stanton so brilliant.  It makes it all the more painful that they  didn't live to see women get the vote, although I still thank them  everytime I step into the voting booth, like I thank Margaret Sanger every  month that I'm not late.  This documentary really humanizes these icons,  which is a godsend.  I assume that this will be widely watched in schools,  and I'm glad for that.  Everyone should know what a long, hard struggle  it's been, and how far women, and men, have come.",942278400,17,855,4.586666666666667
1244291,5,B00001IVFK,"This is such an inportant documentary. Every American should see this, especially women.  Ken Burns and company do a fantastic job of telling the story of the friendship between Anthony and Stanton and how these women  dedicated their lives to the fight for the right of women to vote.  I am  inspired to learn more about these two brilliant women that did so much to  improve the lives of American women.",942105600,8,405,4.647887323943662

1244332,5,B00001IVFK,"Saw this on TV and was inspired. Visited the National Park Service site in Seneca Falls, NY. The DVD is so much better that the NPS site.",1445904000,,137,4.111111111111111
1244333,4,B00001IVFK,"Very thorough documentary about Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, and I enjoyed learning more about their contributions. It was a little slow, and Part Two put both of them on too high a pedestal, but aside from that, it was very informative.",1443139200,,253,4.7727272727272725

1244339,5,B00001IVFK,Long (3 hours) but well worthwhile little known history. A great evening showing to friends.,1430784000,,92,5.2
1244340,5,B00001IVFK,Totally inspiring! Required viewing. Thank you Ken Burns.,1424131200,,57,6.25
1244381,5,B00001IVFK,This is a very intereting tape.  Well presented.  You will enjoy it.,1413676800,,68,4.583333333333333
1244382,5,B00001IVFK,Another great documentary by the fabulous Ken Burns and company which fills in some vital gaps in standard US history sources.,1397088000,,126,5.0476190476190474
1244383,5,B00001IVFK,"This is an excellent documentary that should be promoted in all our halls of learning. It is as important as the freeing of the slaves in this country, the difference being that in many ways and in many religions an countries women are still very much oppressed by male dominance. Many women are so ""dumbed down"" their whole lives as to not realize that they can live as equals to men in all intellectual pursuits and many physical occupations as well. There will always be the fact that overall men are more physically stronger nor can they bear children, thus the woman has a special place to fill that men cannot and vice versus. But this in no way should be used to dominate the woman to a subservient role.",1396915200,2,711,4.476923076923077
1244384,4,B00001IVFK,"Really well done, lots of history here, not a lot of politics which is  good thing. Interesting to remember that suffragets were mostly abolitionists too and because of these womens tireless efforts to help gain womens rights and end slavery, black men were granted the right to vote before any women were, very unfair.",1393804800,,319,4.907407407407407
1244385,5,B00001IVFK,"This moving account of the friendship between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B Anthony should be part of the tool bag of every student of american intellectual history for its illumination of the abolition/suffrage/prohibition era of 1830-1870.  It is a documentary of the highest quality and can be used with groups of students for classes scheduled for the up-coming 2014 Women's History Month!  I highly recommend this excellent resource as a window into the hearts and minds of these two extraordinary path-finding figures an era that changed the course of history and all of our grandmothers, mothers, and of course, our daughters, lives.",1389571200,2,645,5.252427184466019
1244386,5,B00001IVFK,"This is an excellent film in the usual Ken Burns style, which I somehow never saw when it was originally broadcast. It's a good thing Stanton and Anthony wrote a history of the early women's suffrage movement since standard American history has largely relegated it to a footnote.  And Stanton and Anthony should be recognized as two significant figures in the history of our country. The title is taken from Elizabeth Griffith's book of the same name, and she too deserves kudos for her work!",1367798400,2,493,4.8
1244387,5,B00001IVFK,Thank you for the movie. It was very educational and informative. Should be out there to be seen by the public before every election.,1359244800,,133,4.583333333333333
1244388,5,B00001IVFK,This documentary explores the lives of two iconic historical figures who are often under represented in general history presentations. This should be required watching for every high school student.,1353715200,,198,5.862068965517241
1244389,3,B00001IVFK,"Very informational.  The DVD focused not only on the women's suffrage movement but also Anthony and Stanton's friendship.  The documentary also showed how as Anthony got older she became more focused on one outcome (the votes of women) while Stanton became focused on many woman's rights issues.  It shows some hard decisions that the two had to make separately regarding the missions they have given their lives to and staying true to their friendship.  Susan B. Anthony wholeheartedly gave her life, her breath, her everything to making the women's vote possible.  This was a well done documentary.",1329264000,,600,5.144329896907217
1244390,5,B00001IVFK,"This video should be required watching for all students,of all ages, of both genders to help them realize the positive changes made in women's lives by the movement these 2 determined women started and stayed with for their whole lives.
Very little is known today by young people about the restrictive and repressive rules that were imposed on women who were citizens of our USA. Very few adults are aware of the near slavery and/or ""coddled-kitten"" lifestyle imposed on females before 1920. What a travesty.",1319328000,,508,4.988235294117647
1244421,5,B00001IVFK,"Should be required viewing for students, both genders, from 5th grade through graduation from high school. I am buying it for all my children,grandchildren,and great-grands. Everyone should.",1315785600,,190,6.074074074074074
1244422,5,B00001IVFK,"As a student of (then called) Home Economics in the late 70s; I learned about early women activists.  But what many women don't know is that they were very much against abortion - They called it ""child-murder"" (Susan B. Anthony) and ""degrading to women"" (Elizabeth Cady Stanton).  Anthony, who remained single, once remarked: ""Sweeter even than to have had the joy of caring for children of my own has it been to me to help bring about a better state of things for mothers generally, so that their unborn little ones could not be willed away from them.""",1283990400,,553,4.63265306122449
1244423,5,B00001IVFK,"I remember being a college-age woman in the early 70s, during the heady early days of the second great wave of faminism in the United States.  I took a course in Women's Studies, and I'll never forget the sense of revelation I felt as I read of these two women, along with Sojourner Truth, Mary Wollstonecraft, Carrie Chapman Catt, Lucy Stone and others.  It was as if the scales fell from my eyes as I realized that I was a member of A People, and my People were women, and there were women who fought and sacrificed for the freedoms I enjoyed.  In ways too complicated to go into here, the promise of those days in the early 70s was only partially fulfilled, but watching this documentary on PBS reminded me of those great women who are not as well remembered in the 21st century as they should be.  Anyone interested in the history of the women's movement, or of the history of freedom and self-determinatn in general, needs to watch this moving film.",1282435200,8,954,4.4655172413793105
1244424,5,B00001IVFK,This was a used DVD.  It arrived very quickly in great condition.  Excellent story.,1269648000,,83,4.857142857142857
1244425,5,B00001IVFK,"I too realize my debt to these extraordinary women -- and Ken Burns for exhuming this hidden history.
Reading it does not compare to this meaningful DVD, now on my Xmas list to edify my three grown daughters.",1256860800,,208,4.5
1244426,5,B00001IVFK,"A wonderfully presented documentation of two amazing women who devoted their lives to women suffrage, a cause they would not live to see completed.  Two amazing women in history, who, though living very different lives, shared an inspiring friendship, and who together literally changed the world for future generations of women.  This 3 1/2 hour DVD is a must for any collection of women's stories!  Sure to inspire the viewer to her own greatness!",1255478400,3,449,5.04054054054054
1244427,5,B00001IVFK,These are not only names but women that all should know--yet yet they ae so often overshadowed.  People just THINK they know them but do they really?  Watch this dvd and you will find out the facts as you see and hear the struggles they went through.  It is truly inspirational and a story that is meaningful for all. It is deeply impressing and done with excellence.  You will want to stand with them so they are never alone. Recommended for anyone above junior high school age to 100. Ken Burns at his finest in the grip of history.,1238544000,,534,4.363636363636363
1244428,5,B00001IVFK,Susan B. Anthony is the best known suffragette but Elizabeth Cady Stanton was really unknown to me.  This documentary clearly shows how both these women worked together and made the vote for women campaign take off.  To see the vintage stills and video of where they came from really helps promote an understanding of what and why they worked so hard.  This historical information should be taught in school as it's very inspiring for girls.,1229385600,3,441,4.8533333333333335
1244429,5,B00001IVFK,"""Not For Ourselves Alone"" is informative and inspiring. Watching it in the context of the 2008 presidential election is fascinating, since one can draw many parallels between the struggles of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth  Cady Stanton and the campaign of Hillary Clinton. The film also stands as a beautiful portrait of friendship and devotion to a cause. The ""talking heads"" make outstanding points, and the storyline of the film builds to the inevitable conclusion: women get the right to vote. Knowing about all the hardships and hard work that led to that moment is truly enriching, and that knowledge is what this film provides.",1207440000,22,635,5.0476190476190474
1244430,5,B00001IVFK,I very eye opening story about a part of history we don't get taught in school. A very good documentary on two of America's most endearing women.,1198195200,4,145,4.407407407407407
7914415,5,B00001IVFK,"This film brings to life an important historical topic in a way that makes it feel immediately relevant. The length allows for a thorough, detailed, and yet not tedious examination of the entire period and related movements (Civil War, African American Suffrage, Temperance). The filmmakers and their team did excellent work researching to find excellent quotes (from letters, speeches, meetings, etc.), and the meshing of the text with the visuals worked very well. I wish I had seen this sooner! I plan to give it to many friends in the years to come.",1520899200,,553,4.956989247311828

7914418,5,B00001IVFK,"I obtained this from the local library, so while not a verified purchase, I did indeed watch it beginning to end, with my heart in my throat. Why did I not know this story?  I had thought of Susan B. Anthony as a tough looking lady on a coin who had disturbed the equilibrium of the 19th century in some vague way, and I had never heard of Elizabeth Cady Stanton at all.  But these two remarkable women did as much as any of the founding fathers to give me my life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  I will never again take for granted my right to vote, to attend college, to own property, to keep my salary for myself, even have a right to custody of my child.  The work these two women did benefits me every day.  The documentary is classic Ken Burns, down to the sweet fiddle tunes and obscure photos-- and that's a good thing.  As much as a catalog of struggles and achievements, it is a quiet exposition of the kind of friendship that we in this generation rarely experience, and that is a beautiful and worthy thing in itself.",1505779200,,1033,4.271794871794872

7914421,5,B00001IVFK,This is a well told documentary.  One would not expect any less of Ken Burns.  He made the statement that he was livid when he discovered this very important part of history that students are not being taught in school.  The information about the women's movement have been glazed over with a paragraph or two.  Every woman should have this.  Make your men watch it with you.,1491782400,,375,4.537313432835821
