2175811,2,B00068S97W,"The DVD itself sucks because there's no menu. Compilations 3&4 are more user friendly. But if you bought this one the workouts start at 2:05, 1:32, 0:56 & 0:15 if you prefer to skip all the credits and instructions.",1406937600,,215,4.538461538461538

2175813,4,B00068S97W,Another good rebounding workout dvd. I have only used the dance and hip hop and enjoyed both. Good exercise for trying to get back into shape after birth and it is easy on your joints,1399248000,,183,4.257142857142857
2175814,1,B00068S97W,"I do not like the video because although there are several different routines on the video, you cannot skip or select the one you are interested in doing. I don't feel the instructors are genuine.",1394064000,,196,4.628571428571429

2175816,4,B00068S97W,"But I'd like to kill this guy for the way he made the DVDs. It's loaded with advertising of his stuff that you gotta deal with every time you run it. What's wrong with him? He gets a star zapped for that. And then he tells you not to use any rebounder besides his. He's nuts. I don't want his cheapo rebounder, I got my own, which is of superior quality. But the workouts itself are great. If you can deal with his spam advertising, then get it. But if your nerves are shot, then forget about these DVDs.",1386892800,2,504,4.101010101010101
2175817,2,B00068S97W,"I bought all of the dvds when I first got my trampoline.  Let's just say I haven't been able to sit through one full session.  There is one particular lady that is especially irritating in her attitude and mannerisms and it makes it all the harder to watch.  I'm not kidding.  And, it seems - she is in all of the exercise sessions I was particularly interested in.  Also, it seems like when I want to go faster - the video goes slower - when I want to go slower - it is going faster.  Perhaps it is just me, but I prefer to just listen to music and do different moves on my trampoline instead.  I keep holding on to hope - though - and perhaps I will take these out again soon and see if I can tolerate them.  The only one that I do care for is the dvd for kids.

If there is any way that you can preview the video before buying - I highly recommend it.  Unfortunately, I jumped right in and excitedly bought these without thinking (just got my trampoline).  This way you can see for sure if it is for you.",1385078400,6,1007,4.010050251256281
2175818,5,B00068S97W,yes yes yes i was very happy with this order. it came fast and was in good shape. thank you from a happy customer,1367280000,,113,3.75
2175819,5,B00068S97W,"I purchased the Compilation #1.  It was was so much fun.  I just knew I had to purchase the Compilation #2.  The Urban Rebounder is a great piece of exercise equipment.  You will be so happy with your purchase, I know I am.  Thank you.",1366934400,,235,4.133333333333334
2175820,5,B00068S97W,A great and instructive workout that you can build on for the rebounder..fun routines easy to follow and you can mix up the routines to suit yourself ..a very excellent and comprehensive menu that lets you choose your level of workout and always gives you the an easier version whilst keeping you safe and fit... A workout to suit all ages...from beginner to advanced..,1336435200,2,369,4.78125
2175821,2,B00068S97W,Workouts were way to easy and the instructors left me bored. I passed this off to somebody else in hopes they found more use out of it then I did.,1331510400,,146,3.9
2175822,1,B00068S97W,"I don't know if I received a bootleg or if this is for real.  I just tried to watch it again and it IS as bad as I thought.  First there are about 7 minutes of showing all the different kinds of rebounding you can do, but only 4 are supposedly on there.  I wouldn't know since you cannot forward and there is no menu.  Therefor, you can only watch the routines in order and if it is taken out of the dvd player you have to start all over.  I won't go into how wacky some of the people seem, but I will also say that the video just pauses for no reason.  I know it could be my player, but it doesn't do that with any other dvd.  I am sure there is some good stuff in there, but how would I know?",1322265600,3,694,3.7448275862068967
2175823,5,B00068S97W,"Love the urban rebounding dvd's by JB Berns. It provides the perfect early morning workout to get me started before a long day of work. The workouts are around 30 minutes each with adequate warm-up and cool-down. On dvd #2, I enjoy Shannon's Box & Bounce. She's easy to follow. The bonus is that you can make the workout as easy or as difficult as you'd like. The rebounder gives you the option of digging as deep on the mat as you desire. I recommend the rebounder workouts.",1316649600,,475,4.409090909090909
2175824,4,B00068S97W,This DVD is totally worth it for Dance Bound alone.  Tracie Finan is so entertaining that you don't want the workout to end.  I also loved Box and Bound alot.  It gives a great total body workout and Shannon makes you feel empowered.  Did not enjoy Hip Hop Bound at all.,1304985600,,270,4.235294117647059
2175825,5,B00068S97W,"Purchased rebounder from HSN a couple of years ago and ONLY did box and bound routine.  This is a really good cardio and upper body workout.  Before I knew it, doing this at least three times a week as recommended, my body started to change.  I stopped after achieving the desired effects and the compliments were flowing.  This year I turned 40 and decided it was time to go back to the old standard.  Yes, you will have a hard time making it through this routine....it is challenging each time I get on the rebounder...even though I know the routine now my body still had to work back up to it.  If you want to tone the arms, and chest and lose the belly fat, get on a rebounder and get busy doing box and bounce.  Three times a week with Tracy and you won't be sorry.",1283385600,4,770,4.197278911564626
2175826,1,B00068S97W,"Let me preface this review by saying that I purchased the Urban Rebounding ""Power Compilation Pack"" with my 48"" rebounder. I found that compilation to be quite good for the money. Now; onto my review:

I borrowed this DVD from my library through an interlibrary loan. I'm certainly glad I didn't spend any good money on it! It consists of 4 pretty horrible programs. Rather than critique each workout individually I would suggest you save your $$ & try it out through an interlibrary loan (ask your librarian). The unattractive models are usually out of sync with each other and the music. The workouts are low energy, low cardio and uninspiring. You and I would have a lot more fun and burn a lot more calories by just free form bouncing to our favorite tunes.

Unlike the Power Compilation Pack (and by implication, presumably, Compilation #1), there is no fun here; nor is there any good cardio. I was thoroughly unimpressed!

2175827,1,B00068S97W,The Instructors talk tooooooo much and get annoying after few minutes. If you mute the TV and put your own music you will notice that half of the time they are talking instead doing the movements. The workouts are short and not effective. The DVD doesn't have a root menu and doesn't show how long are the workouts. In my opinion it doesn't worth the price.,1221091200,20,357,4.424242424242424
2175828,4,B00068S97W,"I have had my rebounder for a few years and saw an add fo the videos.  Number 2 is my first DvD.  I started with the Hip Hop workout and loved it, as I was a dance for year before I injured my back a year ago. The workout wasn't to long. The Core bound was great on my back and I could keep up with the workout. Didn't like the box and bounce to well.  Too arobic for me right now.  I had to stop to catch my beath.  The dance bound was fun with all the dance move, but still got winded.  Looking forward to complation 5 with all the stetching.",1160265600,9,544,3.769911504424779
2175829,5,B00068S97W,"This was my first Urban Rebounding purchase and I am very happy with it. I have been doing Leslie Sansone workouts for a few years, which I still enjoy but I had to start wearing ankle weights in order to get a strong workout. I thought rebounding might be too easy as well but I was wrong! All of the workouts present a good challenge for me. The instructors are motivating without too much unecessary chit chat. I will be purchasing all of the other DVD's soon.",1159920000,9,463,4.333333333333333
2175830,4,B00068S97W,"I really like the Box and Bounce workout the best. I really like the instructor, I feel that she is upbeat and energetic without being annoying.  I find the Dance Bound instructor Traci to be really annoying and the workout is ok.  I haven't done the complete Core bound workout but so far, the instructor was pretty good.

I don't find the Latin bound instructor to be very inspiring at all.",1141948800,9,392,4.492957746478873
2175831,3,B00068S97W,"This is an okay DVD.  After working out to the compilation 1 DVD for about a month, I was ready to move on to something different.  The first workout I tried was the core bound which was a little too challenging.  It was hard to follow what she was doing.  Next workout I attempted was the Hip Hop Bound. I was just starting to get the hang of it and it ended.  It is too short.  The workout only lasted about 10 minutes, not long enough.  I did enjoy the dance bound as well as the box and bound.  Traci can be a little too enthusiastic for me, but she does a good job.  One thing I would really  love to see on this entire series is a listing of the length of each workout.  It would be easier for me to determine which workout I wanted to do if I knew how long it was.  I really hated that I wasted my time even doing the Hip Hop bound, I didn't have time to break a sweat.",1140998400,39,876,3.859550561797753
2175832,5,B00068S97W,"This is one of my favorite work out videos. I love dance bound. In fact, I'll be doing it tomorrow. Traci is one of my favorites in the urban rebounding team. She is fun and very entergetic.

Box and bound is a really nice change from all the other videos. I don't really like the instructer much. But, I still really enjoy the workout.

Core bound is great! However, it is not recomended by me for the beginners. It is a tough work out!

Well hip-hop......it is just different. That's all I have to say. I don't like it much. But, it's a change in the same old same old work out.",1130284800,19,580,4.160714285714286

8040335,1,B00068S97W,"Just like I have seen in other reviews one wonders if this is authentic.  It did not come in a DVD jacket, it was in a white disk envelope with a sticker that clearly was peeled off something, maybe the original, and then stuck on the white envelope. (See picture) The disk is not new, there are scratches on it.  don't want to even put it in my player for fear what may happen.  Very disappointed it wasn't as described, etc.  I ordered the other compilations, 1-2-4 and they all came in their DVD case and were sealed, never opened, no scratches, etc.  I am contacting Amazon also to let them know about the inaccurate description.",1515024000,,633,4.422413793103448
8040336,1,B00068S97W,I'm sending back.. it is not in a box or anything!! The DVD was just in the shipment box with the other things I bought. I'm sure it's scratched or something cause it was just in there with no case.. looks like it's a homemade DVD ..,1500508800,,233,3.978723404255319
8040337,4,B00068S97W,"Rebounding is a brilliant workout. It's not as popular as I think it should be, probably because of the rebounder which runs around $300 + for a decent one. This form of exercise is a godsend with recovering from a knee injury. Finally, I can do plyo squats again, jump, and get a great high impact cardio workout that is low impact on my knee. This JB Berns franchise of DVD's are really good workouts and I'm thankful he made them. The cons: They are reeeaaallly dated, the music is beyond cheesy (think really bad 90's clubby club stuff) and one of the instructors remind me of a cross between a cheerleader and a chihuahua.",1488240000,,627,4.460869565217391

8040340,5,B00068S97W,I'm looking for more of a Hip Hop music training dvd. One for beginners. But up to date and I can't find one anywhere.,1464998400,,118,3.9583333333333335
8040341,4,B00068S97W,"This came with my Urban Rebounder when I bought it some years ago.  I have recently been using it a lot -- Urban Rebounding burns a ton of calories and I find it to be particularly easy on my knees.

First, the big annoyance.  There are four workouts on this DVD, but no DVD menu.  You hit ""play"" and then you have to fast forward to the workout you want (speed up the playback rate -- you can't skip to another track because there aren't any other tracks).  It's almost like having a VCR again (at least there is no rewinding).  This DVD could be greatly improved by reprogramming it to include a menu.

That being said, this has some nice variety.  J.B. Berns, while I do like the workouts he hosts, is only in this *before* the workouts start, where he goes through some of the moves with each of the various hosts.  I don't watch these parts, but if you need the instruction, they're available.

Each workout has a different host.  I'll admit to not doing the Core Bound workout, which basically is some yoga moves but taking advantage of the unstable surface provided by the mat.  I am much more interested in the cardio workouts.  But this one is available if you want it.

I will put the other three workouts together and do all of them in one session.  You get about 70 minutes of cardio that way.

Box and Bounce is a pretty good boxing-based workout.  There are limitations to what you can do with boxing on the rebounder, because of the small area where your feet can go, but this one definitely takes full advantage of the rebounder, all while managing to keep me from getting bored.  I like the instructor well enough, though I think perhaps she tries a bit too hard to be friendly and encouraging.  However, she definitely showed skill in choreographing the workout and it is a nice change of pace from the workouts J.B. Berns does.

Dance Bound is interesting.  It is actually a good cardio workout as well.  It's mostly Broadway-style dancing, with a few other influences, but all the moves seem well-chosen to take advantage of the rebounder as well.  But the instructor is over the top.  She does not stop talking the entire time.  I like her, but at the same time, she can be just a little irritating.

Both of these workouts are about 30 minutes, with Dance Bound being slightly longer.  Cueing is better in Box and Bounce; the instructor for Dance Bound sometimes gets a little ahead of herself.  In both of these, you learn moves a few at a time and work up to a longer sequence.  It is pretty easy to follow along with both (and I'm the kid who was always turning the wrong way in dance class).  My heart rate gets up with both (not as much as running on the treadmill, but that's to be expected), I break a sweat with both, and my Fitbit counts a lot of steps with both.  The hostesses are both easy to hear over the music and the music is appropriate for each routine.

And then there is Hip Hop Bounce.  This had potential -- its basic/core move is a different type of bounce than the basic bounce from most of the other Urban Rebouding workouts I've tried.  But just when you get started...it's over.  It's under 15 minutes long.  It could have been great (OK, it's a little cheesy, but so is Dance Bound).  It uses a lot of moves I've never seen in the other DVDs.  I get the sense that I *would* get a good workout if it was longer.  I suppose you can do this one if you don't have much time?

Anyway, I like this because it's less repetitive than compilation 1.  The new moves and different instructors are good for variety and maintaining my interest.  It's not the toughest workout DVD I have, but I do try to do these workouts (minus the core one) at least once a week as part of my overall fitness program.",1452729600,2,3740,4.353111432706223
