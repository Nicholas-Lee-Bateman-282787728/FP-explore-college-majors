8278590,5,B000TDKUNU,This movie was very informative and is done in a way that even someone with no knowledge of gardening (like myself) was able to understand. I cant wait to try Lee's ways of gardening. Lee O'hara also puts his information as in website and email address on it for anyone that has questions about organic gardening and I have asked him more than a few and he has answered everyone of them and made sure that I understood what he meant.,1267488000,,433,4.3580246913580245
