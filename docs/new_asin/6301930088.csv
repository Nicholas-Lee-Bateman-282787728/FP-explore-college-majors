378439,4,6301930088,"I just brought this one from you also.
In this one you see Pierce's character, Neil Skinner as a bit ruthless.  He's charming, sexy, handsome, but he wants to put Ebet under for sending him to jail.
This shows a new  side to Pierce.  The character of Neil Skinner is very strong.  He is  determined to win back Sheila's affections.  She never really did fall for  Ebet.  I think she just tells him that.
I loved this one, but it could  have been longer.",928454400,7,453,4.2976190476190474
378510,5,6301930088,"I have to like it - I'm in it. :-) But don't blink or you'll never see the quick nod this once-young police woman gives to her partner toward the end. Very fun. Haven't been in a movie since.

Charming, light, breezy horse track whodunit robbery caper with a couple of absolutely funny twists and turns. Hope you like it!",1436832000,,321,4.35
378511,5,6301930088,As a collector of the works of Actors I like I can say that this is a one movie that I enjoyed on cable and wanted in my collection but never saw it in my local used book/movie stores so I went online and found it as well as several other older titles..... Thank You Amazon for having access to so many hard to find movies.,1434153600,,323,3.909090909090909

378515,5,6301930088,"I really like good natured caper movies. This was a great example. Pierce Brosnan's character had four years to plot and plan the perfect heist, knock off a race track and make sure his ex-partner pays for framing him. And he walks away laughing.
The story goes that Brosnan had so much fun with this movie he went on to do the Thomas Crown Affair.",1411689600,,348,4.369230769230769
378516,4,6301930088,"Good, fast paced thriller. I didn't know how it was going to turn out until the end & that's the way I like my mysteries. the characters were well defined & well played especially by Pierce Brosnan & Tom Skerritt.",1397433600,,213,4.35
378517,4,6301930088,I love Pierce Brosnan.  He is a great actor.  I would recommend it to family and friends. His movies are always great!,1392940800,,118,4.318181818181818
378518,1,6301930088,A poorly written movie in my opinion. Brosnan wasted in this effort. Somehow the plot - meant to be clever - was only boring.  I was happy when it was over.,1385337600,,156,4.032258064516129
378519,5,6301930088,One of my favorite actors. This  movie was sent to me very fast. I watched it the same day as delivered. Thanks and hope others like it too.,1371859200,,140,4.0
378570,3,6301930088,This was an okay film.  I think the story line could have been better.  This is probably my least favorite of all the films Pierce made.,1369785600,,136,4.1923076923076925
378571,5,6301930088,The sex scene in this movie was great. I think one of the best in my opinion. Pierce is great too.,1365206400,,98,3.7142857142857144
378572,3,6301930088,"The Heist (Not To Be Confused With Heist), is nothing more than an average ""heist"" movie. Is it better than The Score or the aforementioned Heist? No, it is not. Is it on par with Loophole, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Straight Time or Blood & Wine? No, it is not. It is nowhere even close to The Bank Job or Parker, either.

This is nothing but a lighthearted caper mpovie that's plot is totally unrealistic. Skinner is a man who was framed for a crime he did not commit. He plans to get even with the former business partner that set him up (Tom Skeritt). None of the characters in this movie are sympathetic and I really did not care for any of them. Not even the suave debonair Brosnan. This movie is not horrible, it's just not good.

I give it Three Stars for trying to be a good movie. The day before I'd seen Layer Cake and (Ironically Another Similar Genre Film With An Actor That Would Go On To Play James Bond) it was so much better. Another thing I did not like about this movie was the female lead was not that attractive. To me this has got to be of import to a movie like this. The late great actors Noble Willingham and Robert Prosky were good, but other than that this movie fell far short of its goal.

On top of which, the plot was difficult to understand. He returns the money he went through all the trouble to steal? Prosky's character, Dancer (A Stupid Name If Ever There Was One), wins a big haul at the races but we don't know for how much. I get the idea that he wins the money that Skinner returns to the race track. But this is never made clear. This was a major flaw in the plot.

There were some nice shots of San Diego, however. This is the 20th review overall for this movie and the third Three-Star review.

378573,5,6301930088,We were replacing some of our VHS tapes and we ordered this one.  It was still a good movie and outcome.,1343001600,,104,3.9523809523809526

378575,5,6301930088,Pierce Brosnan is truly a gifted actor.  This movie will stir your emotions.  Watch this one and you can see all of the elements that made Pierce a James Bond.,1331769600,,159,4.266666666666667
378576,3,6301930088,"You have Pierce to look at all through the movie. Plot, okay, but who cares. There  is Pierce. Plot not original idea , good for when nothing is on television.",1324771200,,159,4.3
378577,5,6301930088,"I loved the plot and how he organized it. Of course, since he's my hero, he couldn't miss. He has a wicked sense of humor and his timing is great.",1318204800,,146,3.9
378578,2,6301930088,"The movie is a cheap attempt at a ""sting"" like remake and fails as such. If you are familar with San diego then the movie is somewhat enjoyable as you get to see some of the sights as they were 20 years ago.",1244764800,,207,3.8372093023255816

378620,3,6301930088,"I remembered seeing The Heist as an HBO flik years ago & enjoying it then.  It's not Casablanca, but it is still a fun & entertaining movie. Brosnan & Skerritt play wonderfully off each other & the action moves quickly.  I would recommend it if you're looking for a fun flik with double crossing ex-partners!",1221436800,,308,4.581818181818182
378621,4,6301930088,"This is a really fun movie, and amazingly similar in plot to the remake of *Ocean's 11*, which came many years later.

Brosnan's character is like Danny Ocean, having spent his jail time plotting to get back his girl and get even with the guy who sent him to jail and walked away with the beauty.  A cat-and-mouse game follows leading to the finale, where Brosnan's big plan is enacted.

Definitely worth watching.",1183334400,4,414,4.6438356164383565
378622,5,6301930088,I am so glad that I bought this movie -- Pierce Brosnan really knows his way around women and horses.  I enjoyed the story.,1162512000,4,123,4.125
378623,4,6301930088,"A fun flick, with beautiful Brosnan growing into his bones

as he hit age 35. An elegant man playing a small-time hood

is a nice contrast. Note the hair slicked back. Audrey

Wood plays the bubble-headed moll who divides her favors

between Brosnan and Skerrit, showing little emotion for either

guy. Nice seedy race track atmosphere, pretty hot love scenes,

and a light hearted adio accompanied by the Spanish version

of ""My Way"". Recommended.

378624,5,6301930088,"Where can one start with a review of The Heist. It is a well crafted movie from begining to end. All the colorful characters are well defined and exciting to watch. There is a scene in the middle of the movie where the bad guys are attempting to figure out how Neil ""Pierce"" is going to rob the track and are able to predict a great many thing and still Neil is able to outwit them all and the cop who is trying to put him back in jail. The Gipsy Kings version of ""My Way"" at the end is great. Pierce Brosnan loved this story so much and the whole making of a caper movie in general and that this is one of the reasons he went on to develop and star in the remake of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", but thats another movie review.",1123718400,28,725,3.9726027397260273
378625,2,6301930088,"This movie is a poorly made farce, on a par with a bad ""I Love Lucy"" episode.  Its only virtues are a fine performance by Pierce Brosnan, showing the ""action"" talent he later developed as Thomas Crowne and James Bond, and the Gypsy Kings' cover of ""My Way"".

Chewing gum for the mind.

Deserves zero stars, if it weren't for Brosnan.",1118534400,2,333,4.426229508196721
378626,5,6301930088,"I want to say right off, shame on you, HBO, for not releasing this fine movie on DVD..And having said that- this movie is yet another reason that Pierce Brosnan is one of the coolest male actors around. He plays Neil Skinner-who gets a rag-tag bunch of friends to dish out one of the best doses of get-even that has been filmed. I highly recommend this over-looked jewel.",1086652800,3,371,4.470588235294118
