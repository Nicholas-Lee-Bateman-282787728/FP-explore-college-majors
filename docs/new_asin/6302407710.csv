7825891,3,6302407710,"The VHS was released as a gift set in 87, and a couple of times since as a stand alone VHS before the extended DVD in 2003.

As an early Don Barrett production, it lacks some of the better CGI of later films.  NASA photos, film, animation and artist impressions are used with early Voyager data to create a tour of the planets.  Asimov introduces the Inner Planets, Outer Planets and the last Holst music movement of Neptune.  Otherwise, it is only music with subtitles.  May feel dated for modern viewers.

DVD-R shows 81 minutes, but Amazon has correct time of 53 minutes in the listing.  The extras round out the longer running time:  Voyager II Saturn;  Pictures From The Solar System;  and Hubble Top 10 Greatest Hits.",1428364800,,723,4.578125
7825892,5,6302407710,Isaac Asimov takes the viewer on a journey through the outer planets as only he could. This is a collector's item. It is out of print and Dr. Asimov has passed. I'm very glad I have it as will my grandchildren.,1391731200,,210,4.146341463414634
