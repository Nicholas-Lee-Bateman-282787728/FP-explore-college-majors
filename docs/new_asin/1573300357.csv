191425,5,1573300357,"By The Way this applies to both Neil's Greatest Hits Live DVD and STAGES DVD. Tell ya if all of sudden all our audio CD's get lost over the years, yet the DVD's still exist, and if the generation in the next century ever discover them, it would send the wrong impression on the way Neil had his concerts, length, and ect.

With the Greatest Hits Live comes up short as it only has a handfull of songs, and the Headed For The Future section is a shame, I would of had the LIVE version included in the video first and offered up the studio version to the last section.  Plus I would of wanted to hear Cracklin' Rosie, Song Sung Blue, Red Red Wine, Thank The Lord For The Nighttime, Holly Holy, The Story of My Life,  The American Popular Song, Forever In Bluejeans(REPRISE). Also it's TOO short! Just doesn't chase away our 'Neilie's'. Neil's voice and actions are great in this DVD, but it lacks adequate concert footage.

As for the STAGES DVD. I would of included the ENTIRE concert. We missed a great opportunity to see Neil play the piano during the Yes I Will/Lady Magdelene Medley, The guitar action that Neil gave Cherry Cherry, Red Red Wine, and The Boat That I Row is missing. Also Neil's stage movements and actions with Holly Holy, Soolaimon, Shilo, Forever In Blue Jeans and the songs from the TCO album are missing. Also it would of been interesting to see Neil in the studio and digging out those tapes for the STAGES album.

What also I'm getting at is that we have those audio CD's for a great roadtrip or party, but nothing that can last a while on our TV sets and DVD players. If you only count TWO DVD's that are no more than an hour long, those really don't help me.  Greatest Hits Live and STAGES is just nothing but a concert sampler.",1095897600,9,1755,4.351681957186544
191426,4,1573300357,"If you want to see the best Neil Diamond Live Concert, get his late 70s ""Love at the Greek.""  He will never perform like that again!  This one doesn't come close, but hey, sometimes concert performances are rare and you have to settle for anything.
As usual, he has the audience revved up and interactive.  The man is a true performer.  But, for ""I Am I Said"", that passionate, lonesome feeling he is able to emote just doesn't come through on this show.  ""Headed For the Future"" shows the music video he did for this song.
Filmed live at the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles in 1988 and it is punctuated by his 80s music with the few 70s classics included the fun ""Forever in Blue Jeans.""  He also offers a tribute song to John Lennon.
Linda Press, the sole female in the band joins him for millionth time for ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers.""  Neil, give that poor girl another song too sing!  She has been doing this song and only this song at your concerts for years, even today!!!
So, enjoy an o.k. performance, but for a magical experience get ""Love at the Greek.""  .....MzRizz",1049846400,31,1078,4.431472081218274
191427,4,1573300357,"Not his very best video, but close to the top. Any performance from Neil is worth watching. His dynamic stage presence is well represented in this one. Maybe not the best technically, but the heart and soul of a Neil concert is very much present. This video is essential to round out your ""Neil collection"" of videos.",1003708800,2,317,4.578947368421052
191428,2,1573300357,"Great songs, but a waste for DVD technology. The sound is poor, I can't believe it's in 5.1. Not to mention that video quality hasn't met my expectations. Couldn't believe that this was Mr Diamond's best show. If you like him, better buy the Cd (I bet it will sound better). Conclusion: Look for a DVD that takes advantage of technology",994118400,8,336,4.524590163934426
191429,2,1573300357,"I have seen Neil Diamond in concert three times.  This DVD does him absolutely no justice.  The small venue seems to sap the energy out of him.  He lacks fire and enthusiasm.  It appears that he is just out on the stage singing his songs, just trying to get through the show.  I am extremely disappointed with this DVD.",990489600,9,319,4.338983050847458
191430,5,1573300357,"This DVD is indeed in Dolby 5.1.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, it defaults to Dolby PCM but can quickly be changed in the AUDIO menu of the DVD.
The audio and video on this DVD are extremely well done.  The sound is better - than - CD quality and the performance was edited to perfection.  The crew truly captured the concert in its entirety: Neil, crowd, band, and lights.  The different camera angels work to further enhance this divine display of talent.
As for the concert, Diamond once again poured out his heart and soul for his beloved fans who couldn't contain themselves on such rocking numbers as ""I'm Alive"" and ""Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show.""  It is clear from this performance, as it has been through all of his songs and other concerts, that the fans ARE his life.
Neil is at his best in this show, belting out beautiful slow tunes as well as spine - chilling renditions of his more vivacious hits.  His medley tribute to John Lennon consistently brings tears to my eyes when I watch it.  We get a REAL treat when he sings ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers"" with Linda Press, his female vocalist.  They are perfect together.  Their amazing chemistry translates into a version of the song that is superior to his duet with Barbra Steisand.
Here's the bottom line: If you get the slightest bit of joy from listening to one of Neil's songs, you HAVE to buy this DVD.",981504000,125,1387,4.538152610441767
191431,5,1573300357,Just read some of the other reviews of Neil Diamond's DVD. There seems to be some confusion if it is in Dolby 5.1. It is in 5.1. The problem is it defaults to PCM. So go to the main menu and select the audio button and you  will see the 5.1. I also recommend increasing the center channel volume  about 4db. This is a must for Neil Diamond fans. Sound and video are well  done.,963187200,26,377,4.0

I thought it would be fun to have Neil in his younger days.  Well he's become an even better performer as he's gotten older.  The Blue Ray gives a better/clearer picture with better sound.  In addition, he's much more comfortable and animated performing now, so although I enjoyed this one, too, I had to give the 5 star rating to the ""Live from Madison Square Garden...""!",1443744000,5,518,4.468085106382978

But he's admittedly at a time well past his prime.
Recording quality (both audio & video) are of iffy quality & just about good for TV.

191565,2,1573300357,"Unfortunately there is not a lot of Neil Diamond available on video. Greatest Hits Live is rather hit and miss. Filmed before a small audience at the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles in 1988 it appears that Diamond was just going through the motions.

The performance, while it does include some of his best work, seems oddly disconnected and lifeless. The mix is adequate but nothing special. There are times when the camera cuts to a member of the band and you can't really hear the instrument he is playing.

I have seen Mr. Diamond twice before and I know that there are better performances out there. The song selection could have been boosted to add some more of the classics.

All in all you need to take what you can get but this DVD is disappointing.",1195257600,3,758,4.518248175182482
191566,5,1573300357,"A mixture of several of his hits.  There are some omissions such as ""Be"" (from Jonathan Livingston Seagull) and ""Holly Holy"", but it includes several of my favorites, such as ""America"", ""Sweet Caroline"", ""I Am I Said"", and ""Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show"" (I still wonder if that song is meant to mock Christianity or rather to paint the picture of an old tent revival).

I will say that I prefer Diamond's vocals on the Beatles tribute than the original.",1174348800,,464,4.7875
191567,5,1573300357,"If you have never seen a Neil Diamond concert, this DVD makes it clear why Neil Diamond isn't a diamond in the rough, but is the real thing.  There is just the band, the audience and the man himself with that fantastic voice.  No need for anything else.  Sit back and enjoy!!!  Rose Leith",1157673600,5,288,4.277777777777778
191568,3,1573300357,This was a bit of a disappointment.  The performance was okay and pretty much what I expected but I guess I must have evolved out of liking this sort of music.  It is music; most of what comes out of the pop world today really can't be called music. Diamond performed professionally and sang well enough especially when compared to what the pop world churns out today.  The thrill of live performance was there in spades and that made it worth watching but it's not something I'll watch very often.,1140393600,,498,4.511111111111111
191569,5,1573300357,I bought this for my sister-in-law for Christmas and she just loved it!  She said she sat and watched and cried and sang and danced.  She's been a Neil Diamond fan forever and she said this was as close to being at one of his concerts.  I can highly recommend this to anyone who loves Neil!,1138492800,2,290,4.142857142857143
191570,4,1573300357,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom. When we watched it we both said the same thing. It's not nearly as good as seeing him live. It seems like he isn't putting as much emotion into it as he does when he's live. The sound is more clear and he singing is better than at a live show, but the engery isn't translated very well. On the plus side there are subtitles so you could sing along if that is your thing. The best part of the DVD for me was all the crowd shots. All those tacky 80's clothes and the priceless reactions of the ladies in the crowd made the price well worth it. So if you get the chance to see Neil in person do it. If not then get this DVD, it will do just fine.",1137369600,2,689,3.825174825174825
191571,3,1573300357,"...the only reason that I give this DVD three stars is that some of the best songs we don't get to hear all the wayhrough, because of fade-ins, fade-outs and the spoken dialogue that I would have prefered not to hear.  Other than that, it's a good show, with great versions of Cracklin' Rosy, Song sung Blue, and Brother Love.",1113868800,8,326,4.433333333333334
191572,5,1573300357,"I have always liked Mr. Diamond, and this DVD (the only one at Amazon) did not disappoint me.  Whenever I feel down, I just put it on and his exuberance and positiveness bring me up to a good mood.  It may be an older performance, but it is ageless.

I recommend it to anyone who likes quality music.",1111276800,6,300,4.137931034482759
191573,5,1573300357,Neil is a class act and to see him in a more intimate setting where he is more able to interact with the audience is wonderful!  Neil is a MUST SEE  act!  This is a MUST OWN for any Neil fan!,1096761600,9,191,3.6097560975609757

7798094,3,1573300357,This is a pretty good concert dvd.  I think this was originally on hbo.  It features some of his classic songs like Sweet Caroline and I Am...I Said.  And one of my favorites the country Forever In Bluejeans.  Although he doesn't do the whole song.  That is pretty much the only complaint I have.,1506556800,,296,4.407407407407407

7798098,5,1573300357,"I still enjoy this. My only complaint is that I wish he would sing America like he sang it in THE JAZZ SINGER. The orchestral overture is missing, which takes a lot out of the song. Also, the synthesizer replaces the acoustic electric guitars on America, and the song really suffers. I also hate how Neil sings the first verse slowly and then kicks it into high gear at the second verse.",1494979200,,387,4.388888888888889

I'll take some space here to make another plug for the release on DVD of the original Neil Diamond Hot August Night concert from 1972 at the Greek Theater--I believe it was released on VHS but for some reason never on DVD, so I hope someone gets with it.",1490918400,,379,4.507246376811594
