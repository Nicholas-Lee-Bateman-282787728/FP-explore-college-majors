8428402,5,B004FVZJCY,"This DVD was very well done.  Most of the 20 messages are from General Authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  There are a few messages from members of the Church from their own personal experiences.  Every message was uplifting to me, and helped me to realize that because God is with all of us, there is hope in all of our lives regardless of our hardships.  We all have hardships, at different stages of our lives; if we will be obedient to God at all times, He will help us endure our challenges.  These messages are very inspirational, no matter what stage of life you are facing in regards to trials.  Excellent, excellent, excellent !!!",1318896000,3,668,4.571428571428571
