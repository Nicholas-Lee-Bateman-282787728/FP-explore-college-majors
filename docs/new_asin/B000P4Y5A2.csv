Dear Sammy --

In the dozen or so years I was fortunate to know you, and of all the actors and or crew I ever worked with, one could not find a nicer, can-do, hope upon hope for all things bright than yourself Sammy.

You had the heart of child -- you found wonderment in everything ... you saw the bright light in even the darkest of emotional nights.  You wouldn't let the beast -- that illness get you down -- and from the told me the last time I saw you, you saw the illness as an adventure to be experienced.

There were so many things you wanted to do in the movies & TV ... your interests and experiences on sets ranged from every gig there was -- from A to Z -- from soup to nuts -- the works ... and you always jumped in with both feet with an infectious enthusiasm.

The last time I saw you Sammy, you gave me an outline for a movie you wanted me to direct ... but alas, it was not to be.  So ... Sammy -- if you can read this -- and I do believe you can -- your ideas, your spirit -- the 'ummfph' that is you will indeed be getting every movie, every show you wanted to make in written, shot, edited and released in the blink of your always smiling eyes.

Onwards, Sammy; the sets will be darker down here in your absence ... but we will, all of us, remember the light you brought in your too short of a time with us.  I'm sorry I was not a better friend ... but I'll be forever honored that I caught the garter at your wedding.

It's not a FADE OUT on Samuel 'Ironhorse' Ferrer -- indeed, it's FADE IN on your great adventures in the lands between the winds and our many varied memories of and with you.
