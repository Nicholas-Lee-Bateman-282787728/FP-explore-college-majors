John Ross tells Christopher that he wants to move to England with Sue Ellen. Debra Lynn tells James she's leaving with James Jr. because she feels that Ewing Oil is more important to him.

Michelle also tells James that he must make a decision. JR sees Cally and his son with Cally's new boyfriend. He tells the PI that there's been a mistake and he should call off the search. JR tells James that he let Cally go, but he feels that James should keep his family together - even if it means letting Ewing Oil go. James agrees and plans to work at JR's new office.

Bobby and Jory start to get romantic, but Bobby wants to take it slowly. He offers to buy Carter's land back but Carter tells him he's already sold it to Michelle, who plans to make it a home for herself and James, away from JR. Hillary Taylor arrives at Jory's beach house.

356. Conundrum
Original Air Date:May 3, 1991
JR comes out of his room, drinking.

He wanders around for a while among the empty rooms, still clutching his gun. He takes a seat on the porch and contemplates what life would be if he was no longer around - or if there had never been a JR Ewing. A guy in white appears on the balcony and encourages JR to pull the trigger.

JR shoots at him and watches as the shot goes right through him. The guy suddenly moves to the diving board and says his name is Adam. Adam offers JR the chance to find out what life would been without him. JR is hesitant but Adam seems to know everything about his life situation. The pair is transferred to the Ewing Oil office, now housing an insurance company.

Ewing Oil went bankrupt because Gary, the oldest brother, mismanaged it into the ground. Jock killed himself over it and then Ellie died, broken-hearted, a few years later.

Cut to Gary: He's a successful divorce lawyer in California. He never married Val - there was no Lucy.

Cut to Jason, the new little brother. He's a greedy land developer in Dallas who plowed Southfork into the ground and built housing estates on the land. Cut to Sue Ellen, who's become a successful soap actress on the hit series ""Top of the World"". She dismisses her agent for making a bad career move, and she's married to Nicholas Pearce. Much to JR's chagrin, she's gotten by fine without him. Cut to Bobby. He's a compulsive gambler in Las Vegas, divorced from Annie Ewing, with three kids. Annie, picking up the kids from the park, reminds Bobby he's way behind in his support payments. Bobby promises to get the money somehow. JR can't believe it the way things have turned out for him. Adam tells him that without JR to butt heads with, Bobby become an aimless drifter, bereft of purpose after Ewing Oil collapsed. Cut to Kristin. She meets a man in a hotel, posing as a call girl. Suddenly she whips out a badge and tells her prey that she's an undercover cop. Actually, it turns out she's a very good con artist who goes after high-ranking officials, who would rather pay her off than have the world know their secrets.

Cut back to Gary. Valene visits his office and they meet for the first time, clearly liking each other. Cut back to Southfork. JR tells Adam he doesn't like what he sees, but Adam retorts that no one said he had to like it. Adam walks on the pool water over to JR and tells him that if he doesn't think things are better off without him, that he should shoot himself. JR declines, concerned about Bobby. Cut back to Bobby, who comes home to a screeching showgirl girlfriend with a pathetic fake Long Island accent who tells him that creditors are after him. Bobby goes to see Carter McKay. Carter was fired by Jeremy Wendell, who, without JR to get in his way, was able to concentrate on building up Weststar. Carter ended up working in Johnny Dancer's operation as a casino boss. Bobby owes him $ 50,000 and Carter gives him two days to come up with the money. Cut to Cally, living in a marriage to Eb, arranged by her brothers. Eb makes OJ Simpson look like an honorary member of the National Organization of Women. One night when Eb has a bad day and threatens to get violent with the kids, Cally grabs a shotgun and kills him. Thanks to Haleyville justice, Cally goes to jail for life. Cut to Cliff. He's got the perfect aristocratic family. His son's going to Harvard law school, his daughter's having a coming out party - and just when things couldn't appear worse to JR, it turns out Cliff is the Vice President of the United States - and the President just had a stroke. Cut back to Bobby. He calls Bootsie, Jason's wife, and asks her to tell Jason he's coming to Dallas. Bobby's apartment is now empty, cleaned out by the showgirl. Cut to Ray, who works odd jobs to earn a living. Because of Jock's untimely death, he never found out who his real father was. After a nasty fall at a Ewing Rodeo, he has chronic back problems and is forced to work hard at menial tasks. But he's got a great family who loves him and he considers himself the luckiest guy in the world. Cut back to Jason and Bobby. Jason doesn't want to lend Bobby anything, and gives him a lot of abuse. Bootsie tries to seduce Bobby, but he turns her down. Bootsie tells him that Jason's got cash stashed away and Bobby 'borrows' $ 50,000. He gives Annie half, and then he offers McKay $ 25,000. When McKay demands the rest of the money, Bobby tells him he has $ 75,000 left in the briefcase [which he doesn't] and offers McKay double or nothing. McKay is hesitant, but his pride takes over. The game is one card out of the deck: Bobby picks the five of diamonds and things look very bad. To JR's relief, McKay picks the two of spades and loses. Adam tells JR that Bobby will blow it all that night. Cut back to Southfork. Adam tells JR he's not from heaven, and JR wakes up as if from a dream. Adam appears in the mirror, dressed in red, exhorting JR once again to pull the trigger.

JR raises the gun to his head. Adam's eyes flash red and he yells, 'DO IT!"". Bobby arrives home and hears a gunshot. Rushing to JR's room, he cries out in horror, ""Oh my God!"".",1285718400,5,26919,4.623300564735411

My dream was to have the entire series for my own, and now I do, except for the 14th. season. Anxiously awaiting it.

One thing has bothered me for years. Why did Bobby have April buried in France? She was killed in Paris, and that was where he left her. She was a mid-America kind of girl and should have been brought home. Anyone got any ideas on this?",1276041600,2,529,3.990566037735849

I would like to see Dallas J.R.

As of 2010, the first 12 seasons are available on DVD, with the Thirteenth Season coming soon in April!

That just leaves One Season left for this long running prime time television Soap Opera!

Dallas - The Complete Fourteenth Season is expected to be released in 2011, or sometime later in 2010, if we get lucky!

I can't wait to have all 14 Seasons of one of the greastet soap operas that was ever created!

Hopefully, Warner Home Video will put more effort into Knots Landing and Falcon Crest, right after they finish Dallas!

Please release more seasons for both soaps!",1261785600,20,639,4.660714285714286
3653304,5,B001JAHPXK,"And so it ends, although there were of course two reunion sequels, one better than the other.  This year was the last one for Dallas, and the cast departures for budget cuts translating to decreased ratings obviously reached it's breaking point.  This season saw many players gone or with a reduced episode count, and the result was of course those viewers who were fans leaving.  Despite this, I feel that anytime a soap is ending, it by definition won't be as fun as when it was going on.  In retrospect, I think the only way to go was to have a sort of tragic finale where the remaining characters sort of faced their destiny.  JR deals with losing everything, Bobby loses his new wife but gains Southfork, and Cliff Barnes finally gets control of Ewing Oil.  The year is really about the tragedy of the two brothers as they slowly come to grips with losing much of all they ever thought was important in life-one being able to deal with it and the other not, in retrospect very well done.  The series finale features JR and a devil played by Joel Grey visiting an alternate reality where JR was never born and many familiar faces from the past returned.  Ultimately it is kind of a fun ride, but I must agree that it was rather unsatisfying as an ending.  Fortunately we got the first reunion in 96, JR Returns, and that was a much better conclusion for fans of the show, and that will thankfully be released soon as well.  So, for what it is, the last season of Dallas is really appropriate and as good as it could have been really.  With Barbara Bel Geddes, Charlene Tilton, and Lesley Anne Down leaving and Barbara Stock added to the main title, also starring Jared Martin as Dusty Farlow, Gayle Hunnicut as Vanessa Beaumont, Clifton James as Duke Carlisle, and John Harkins as Control, with special appearances by Susan Lucci, Barbara Eden, Mary Crosby, Linda Gray, Joel Grey, Steve Kanaly, Jack Scalia, Ted Shackelford, and Joan Van Ark.",1240272000,73,1946,4.579250720461095

3653422,4,B001JAHPXK,"The XIVth and final season of DALLAS opens with suspense done in the style of legendary director Sir Alfred Hitchcock, and ends with an ode to a classic motion picture...a Machavellian twist worthy of DALLAS. Two delectable teasers for what happens in between: A Jeannie plots to destroy J.R. and someone who's been an ally of J.R. finds out what a  snake he is. To quote from my favourite motion picture, 'Don't believe me? Ask the dishes.' The final minutes of one episode literally had my heart pounding and almost screaming at the end. That's how good it was.

It's a shame that Barbara Bel Geddes left the show in Season XIII and retired from acting. The series was not really the same without her in the final season. Same with Howard Keel, who appears in less than a dozen episodes. The departing cast members really left a gaping hole in the show, which the writers did their best to fill up. Shame also that Michelle Stevens was a child-hating b---. I don't like it when a beautiful woman hates children; especially kind children, like Christopher. That is why I give this final season IV stars.

A soundtrack for the show should be made, as there are III memorable love themes in the show: one for Pam & Bobby heard mostly through the miniseries (first five episodes) and the real first season (what is known as the second season), another love theme for Pam & Bobby heard throughout Season X and a love theme for April & Bobby heard in the final episodes of Season XII, throughout Season XIII and sporadically in Season XIV. Beautiful music.

Special mention in the acting department goes to Kimberly Foster, Cathy Podewell, Barbara Stock, Sheree J. Wilson, Deborah Rennard, Susan Lucci, the woman who played Jory, Patrick Duffy and the woman who played McKay's harlot.

The Storm Ends...Or Does It?

The series was followed by two reunion movies; DALLAS: J.R. Returns (written by Executive Producer Leonard Katzman) & DALLAS: War Of The Ewings (written by Executive Producer Arthur Bernard Lewis). Both made-for-television films are included with the prequel DALLAS: The Early Years (written by series creator David Jacobs), which aired during the dream season of the show, and the reunion special DALLAS: Return To Southfork in DALLAS: The Movie Collection.",1410307200,,2270,4.867875647668394

Although, this season is missing many key players such as Sue Ellen, Pamela, Ray, Jenna and Donna (they had been missing for several seasons by this time) it is still a very fun season.
As long as ""good ole JR"" is around it is always fun.
JR is still in the ""nut house"" at the beginning of this season and we get to see him at his most vulnerable state.
JR and Cliff still have their great animosity towards one another. The 2nd to the last show they have an absolutely hilarious scene together.

3653471,4,B001JAHPXK,"In its 14th and final season, DALLAS goes out in a gusher of murders and kidnappings, lies and blackmail, seductions and schemes. J.R., Bobby and Cliff  three original characters so big only Big D could hold em  are at the heart of the action, surrounded by oil-country folks who joined the series over the years and a passel of dynamic newcomers & of course theres that DALLAS hallmark, a white-knuckle cliffhanger.

This time its a 2-part finale inspired by ""Its a Wonderful Life"" in which J.R.s guardian from the great beyond shows the Lone Star States meanest rattler what the world would have been without him. Think everythings for the better? Then you're in for some surprises.

As a matter of fact, this 1990-1991 Season takes me back to memory lane to when I was 18 years and a Senior in high school, especially since DALLAS cancelled in the Spring of 1991 after its 13-year run on CBS the weekend I went to my Senior prom and a few weeks before I graduated from high school too.",1389052800,,988,4.564971751412429

L Hagman was brilliant., and it really showed the world., how it all came down on him ., and how it all worked in 2012 and 2013.  Thank you!!",1366329600,,266,4.0
3653484,3,B001JAHPXK,"This final season of the original ""Dallas"" finds the series in a no-win situation on most counts: The only original remaining cast members have turned ""Dallas"" into the J.R./Bobby/Cliff hour and despite the relative newcomers, most of the situations are re-hashed from the glory days long past.

Continuing from Season 13, J.R. is still committed to the sanitarium thanks to James, who has plans to seize control of Ewing Oil. There are a few highlights here in the form of humpy Mitch Pileggi (who showed up on the 2012 reboot) as well as a touching scene where J.R. gifts his fellow patients with goodbye presents.

Bobby and April's newly-wedded bliss is cut short on a Paris honeymoon when April is abducted by the mysterious Sheila Foley (Susan Lucci) who has plans to force Bobby in assisting her in an International protest that turns into a nightmare. This storyline doesn't get resolved until the very end of the season and you can skip through the entire middle section here without missing much.

Even the terrific Kimberly Foster seems more fizzle-than-sizzle this season as most of her scenes are dragged down since she's paired with the lethargic James (Sasha Mitchell).

There's a boring plot involving Cliff's new love (Barbara Stock) who has mysterious mob ties, but this just comes across as an inverse of the Sue-Ellen and Nick scenario from Season 11. Barbara Eden's reunion with Larry Hagman here is a little surreal to watch since we can't help but imagine her folding her arms and blinking him onto a spit in their rotisserie oven instead of having her hatch an elaborate revenge plan that lasts a half-dozen episodes.

Tellingly, even the characters remark on how empty and static the show has become with J.R. stating how quiet Southfork seems and John-Ross and Christopher chuckling ""Things are finally getting fun around here again"" when they witness a catfight in the pool between Michelle and one of James' one-night-stands.

The brief return of Clayton (Howard Keel) is most telling as his bored expression and awkwardness display when he gives the news that Miss Ellie is not returning and has decided to bequeath the ranch to Bobby.

It was past the time to lay ""Dallas"" to rest and everything here seems very anti-climactic. For completists only: everyone else should just watch the first few episodes set in Paris and the last three or four. You won't be missing much in between.

THREE STARS but still better than the 2012 remake.",1365206400,,2465,4.908653846153846

3653486,5,B001JAHPXK,"It's the final complete season for this great series. It is actually a decent season storyline wise. I know a lot of people hate the series finale but in reality the penultimate episode was the series' final episode.

3653508,5,B001JAHPXK,"I was very surprised by how dynamic Season 14 is and I definitely feel that if the final two episodes hadn't been created and edited as a way to 'wrap it up' for Dallas that the show could have continued longer. Despite the few episodes that stalled things slightly while James Beaumont dissolved his marriage to Michelle, the entire season had a wide range of plot directions and introduced some new characters smoothly enough, (including a warmer and wiser family oriented J.R.), to have been a decent installment in the show's continued success. Of course, it would have been a much different product by then, and ""Old J.R."" would need to be up to his skillfully crafted tricks every so often...but they could have been based in his new desire to rebuild the Ewings as a family unit on South Fork, gaining a stake in the ranch for his sons and his grandson from Bobby, or wrestling Ewing Oil back from Cliff and Michelle. After reading that Season 14 was such a low point for the series that I was surprised by how good it was and I did not find it boring at all. All good things indeed must come to an end, but it didn't seem to me that Season 14 was destined to be 'it' for Dallas at all. It could easily have been a launching pad for the show, which had endured after major changes to the overall design. (I know-Spoken like a true fan-lol)!",1358380800,,1347,4.413654618473895

3653539,1,B001JAHPXK,"I really wanted to love it and like it but it was just plain hard since it was so boring.  I don't know why it has stayed so expensive because it is so not worth it.  The show just couldn't be the same without Sue Ellen, Lucy, Ms. Ellie, and Clayton.  Cliff was way too mild. I know Sheree Wilson was pregnant but I think it would have been better for her to go away another way and not the stupid way they killed her.  Season 14 was like they had short timmer's disease, they knew this was it so the writers didn't give a darn.  I wish Dallas went off with a bang but it didn't, but being a die hard Dallas fan I had to see it.  I would have been more than happy if my local library would have had this season but they didn't.  Usually I don't pay much attention to when people write about bad color and clarity because I usually think that some people are too picky and want beyond perfection, but I will have to say that the color and clarity was off at some points.  I wouldn't have thought this was the 14th season by the way it looked because it looked really old compared to the previous seasons.

If you have not bought this season and you have Netflix I would suggets you getting it there or the library.  If you can see it without buying it you will have done yourself a financial favor.  I wouldn't suggest not wasting your time and seeing it, I would just say if you don't have to purchase it then please don't unless you have extra money to throw around.",1306195200,16,1467,4.094405594405594

I thought everyone would come back for the last show, and they did, but it was a blast from the past. I guess that's okay. I wanted it to end a certain way, but you can't have everything. I am sadden that there's no more seasons for Dallas. It was a dangerous, and back-stabbing show, and JR should have been shot more than once because he was ruthless as they come. The man had no scruples at all.

I could have put a different ending on it, but the show was mysterious and had a lot of anticipation. I enjoyed it. I really will miss Dallas. It was one of my favorite shows up there with KNOTS LANDING, MELROSE PLACE AND DYNASTY. Television as of 2011 sucks.",1300752000,7,772,4.216216216216216

From the death of April to all of the family members who just conveniently went on vacation at the same time I felt like the writers were scrambling there at the end to keep it going. Not sure if they ran out of ideas or kept trying to resurrect the show to contine for another season. Why would Miss Ellie leave her beloved family and SF? Why would she not rush home to be with Bobbi when April died? So out of character for her. Also, JR basically just rolled over and played dead when he found out he had another son with Callie, when his eldest one decided to leave the ranch and John Ross left to be with his mother. The JR we all grew to love, and hate,  would never let them go! He would also never have let Ewing Oil go without putting up a fierce fight. We just didn't see that spark with him during this season. He seemed broken. I made myself finish watching because I had watched all of the other seasons but it really didn't do much for me.

All fans remember the start of the show, the good storylines and characters.

They let the show go on too long.
How stupid the storylines got.

Here we go with the last season.  They got rid of Miss Ellie and Lucy AGAIN for the entire season.  We see Clayton a couple of times.

For the last episodes we get to see Sue Ellen, Gary, Ray & Kristen with the stupid finale with Oscar winner Joel Grey.

Bringing in Barbara Eden for a reunion with Larry for several episodes.  Susan  Lucci for several episodes with that horrible, made no sense storyline that killed the April character.

Bobby moping for another wife lost, yet another woman to pick up the pieces.

The James character, terrible.  None of these storyline made SENSE.  How many more shootings did we need, how many more murders.

They did their style of the famous Dynasty shoot out.

I had loved the show, but these last seasons were just bad.

3653559,3,B001JAHPXK,"There is no doubt that the final season of ""Dallas""is something of a disappointment. A mediocre and at times sad attempt to keep the show going that revs up in moments , then gets lazy and drones down again to the all too irrelevant conclusion. What a shame they could not have brought some of the regulars back for a real final episode instead of this gloomy, silly muddle with Joel Grey. Very few long running series have ever ended well and ""Dallas"" is no exception with a cliff hanger that looked like it would never be resolved until after Larry Hagman thankfully survived  his health problems, was able some years later to return and tie up the loose ends with a TV movie that came close to finishing up in  a way that the final episode could and should have been resolved.

Having said all this, there are some fine moments here, the season starts very badly as the producers go to no end of expense and plot contrivance to kill off Sheree Wilson (they couldn't kill her off the season before which ended with her wedding to Bobby)once the crazy and poorly and rather insultingly written Dallas version of ""Cuckoos Nest"" together with the last gasps of Ms Wilson are over, the storyline was quite fine for the next few episodes with the delightful addition  of Barbara Eden. She and Larry have a ball together and their scenes and their plotline is as strong, camp and amusing as anything in the last few years of ""Dallas"" Unfortunately Patrick Duffy's tedious storyline (looking to revenge Ms Wilson's death, didn't he know she wanted to leave!!!??)brings most of the last season down. The addition of Susan Lucci's daughter is slow, tiresome, lacks any sort of sexual spark or dramatic pulse and it goes on and on and on, probably the weakest storyline in the history of the series. Finally in the last few episodes, plots are tied up, actors leave and it all starts to wind down to what should have been a cheery and likeable final couple of episodes (Victoria Principal was going to come back and resolve the Bobby Pam storyline till no one could guarantee to her that this was definitely the final episode)Instead ""Conundrum"" is a trivial, silly, unbelievable version of ""Its a Wonderful Life' that brings the series crashing down in flames. What a wasted opportunity and what a shame the producers could not see it. At least they redeemed themselves much later with ""Jr Returns"", but that could all have been played into the final episode and the series would have ended on a high.",1297728000,,2494,4.648526077097506

3653564,5,B001JAHPXK,"DALLAS is my extreme, all-time favorite series, and so I consider myself fortunate to have been a fan of it since the very early part of it's original run.  It's been an absolute joy to collect all of the season sets over the past 6 years, which brings me to why I feel the need to air a grievance.  The character of Cliff Barnes has been a mainstay of this series since the very first episode in 1978; I'm sure that other die-hard fans are also aware that Ken Kercheval (Cliff) and Larry Hagman (J.R.) were the ONLY two actors to have remained with the show from start to finish.

Keeping this in mind, I must say that I've been highly offended by the omission of Cliff's picture on the front cover art of the last 3 season sets.  It wasn't as if Cliff was a peripheral, secondary character: his conflict with the Ewing family (J.R. in particular) was to me the principal driving force which kept this series so incredibly successful for so many years.  How on earth could the designers of these last 3 box sets continually ignore such an integral presence on the show?  I bit my tongue and kept quiet when seasons 12 & 13 were released, but seeing the cover art on season 14 is the last straw for me, an offense which I cannot ignore.

I fully agree with the inclusion of Bobby and Carter McKay, along with big-name guest stars Susan Lucci and Barbara Eden, who added some spice and intrigue to this final year (and who were both involved in major story lines).  But then you have a character who is almost universally reviled by fans (James), another who is virtually unknown (Jory), one who was unfortunately killed off very early in the season (April), as well as another dead character who returned only for the series finale (Kristin).  C'mon now, I understand not having Clayton on the cover, as he only made 4 appearances during this final year (although it would've been nice to see him here as well, being the important legacy character that he was), but there is absolutely NO excuse for Cliff's absence.  Bottom line is he needs to be here, and in a picture at least as big as Bobby's.  I could still wish for this to not be the finalized box art, but I'm not getting my hopes up.  This is really sad and unfortunate, and a major slight to Ken Kercheval and the unforgettable character that he brought to life for 14 riveting and glorious seasons..",1287014400,8,2361,4.452436194895592
