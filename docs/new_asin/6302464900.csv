7827915,5,6302464900,"This is indeed a hard-to-find Thanksgiving-type special, unaltered at least. This special can be seen uncut in The Essential Daffy Duck DVD set from 2011, albeit high-pitched via time compression. After being absent from 1979's Bugs Bunny's Thanksgiving and Christmas specials, Daffy managed to get 2 holiday specials of his own in 1980; the Easter one by DePatie-Freleng and this one for Thanksgiving by Chuck Jones Enterprises! Thanks-for-giving is mostly a clip show with bits from The Scarlet Pumpernickel, Robin Hood Daffy, Drip-a-long Daffy, & His Bitter Half, and also has an all-new short, Duck Dodgers and the Return of 24th-and-a-half Century, in its original uncut form! It especially has footage not seen when it was a theatrical short later on, all cut out to make the short even shorter than it already was! While this special has little to do with Thanksgiving, you'll be glad to have this in your collections of any sort, holidays and/or Looney Tunes, nowadays, in the Essential Daffy Duck DVD set!",1521417600,,1014,5.077844311377246
7827916,5,6302464900,"This is another one I watch the night before Thanksgiving. A real special treat taht should be aired, but NO. All they air nowadays is stupid Japanese cartoons and such. Do yourself a favor if you enjoy real cartoons. This is a great one that finds Daffy in Hollywood on bended knees to try to get a Hollywood producer or director to let him do ""Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24th 1/2 Century."" It's a great sequel that has an unlikely ending. Enjoy this along with a stuffed turkey.",1038268800,5,488,4.373626373626373
