8033683,4,B0002WRIU6,"""A Question of Fear"" features Leslie Nielsen (in the days when he was a dramatic actor) as a self-absorbed soldier of fortune that shows his manly mettle by spending an expenses-paid night at a haunted house.  ""Camera Obscura"" is a frightening tale of poetic justice featuring a heavily-disguised Ross Martin (""The Wild, Wild West"") and Rene Auberjonois (""Deep Space Nine"").

And horror is balanced with romance in ""Cool Air"" starring Barbara Rush and Henry Darrow (""The High Chapparel"").

These three stories' strengths compensate for the lameness of the shorter vignettes: ""The Devil is Not Mocked"" and """"Quoth the Raven"".",1105488000,2,624,5.282828282828283
