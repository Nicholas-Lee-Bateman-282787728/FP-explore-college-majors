2894690,5,B000T4G8UI,"Love this dvd.  I've been searching for a long time to find a work out that gets you moving without lots of dancy steps in which you are doing something else with your arms.

I'm a bit dyslexic and the others I've tried have me so frustrated I don't want to do the workouts.

Lastly, I hate instructors like Denise Austin, sacharine sweet, who can't keep their mouth shut for 5 seconds. It would be one thing if Austin offered valid points but 95% of the time its useless junk to motivate...althoght I can't imagine someone wanting to listen to it?

In any case Debbie Siebers dvd's are excellent, she gives you instructions to perfect your form, what not to do and it a joy to work out with.",1234483200,12,692,4.341085271317829

8207703,4,B000T4G8UI,"I've been doing cardio core for quite some time, I also have cardio sculp, and slim in 6, but has anyone noticed????? that the wood chopper move is only done on one side of the body. Therefore I always have to stop the tape and repeat the move on the other side! I don't know..... just seems odd that they would mass produce this video with this major flaw.",1399161600,,357,4.188405797101449
8207704,5,B000T4G8UI,"I rate the seller for being awesome *****.  The entire experience with them is fantastic. I was not thrilled with the video, but I give Happy Land Books ten stars if I could.",1384819200,,174,4.2727272727272725
8207705,4,B000T4G8UI,Great and easy to use. See results a couple of weeks. It is good if you are a busy person.,1384300800,,90,3.55
8207706,5,B000T4G8UI,"Great low impact, standing ab work.  Only 30 minutes.  Definitely recommend it.  Debbie Siebers also has one called Cardio Core.  Once again low impact standing ab work with and without weighs.  Also 30 mins",1383264000,,207,4.970588235294118
8207707,3,B000T4G8UI,"I have really seen results from most of the videos I own from Debbie Siebers slim series.  This one however, didn't really do much for me.  I know its a quick work out, but for 30 minutes, I guess I expect more.  I am hoping that Debbie will come out with some new DVD's soon that are comprable to her Slim Series from ealier in the decade.",1379462400,,340,4.044776119402985
8207708,4,B000T4G8UI,This is exactly what it says it is and is a nice short addition when I only have a little time.,1357171200,,95,3.5714285714285716
8207709,5,B000T4G8UI,"This workout gets your heart rate up and really makes you sweat.  It is the perfect addition to Debbie's other workouts because its focus is arms, chest and upper back.  It only takes 30 minutes which is nice on days when you don't have the time or the inclination to workout for an entire hour.",1313971200,3,295,4.345454545454546
8207710,5,B000T4G8UI,I have lost 20 pounds and needed to tone and sculpt my upper body.  I have seen the adds on TV for slim in 6 with Debbie Siebers.  I liked her and the concept of her videos so I ordered this one.  She is excellent and I really liked this workout.  I'm still at a low weight only 2 lbs but I'm getting stronger and the 5 lbs used in the video is coming soon.  Thanks to Debbie Siebers I would recommend this workout to anyone who wants to sculpt the upper body.  Thanks Debbie....,1278633600,4,479,3.9894736842105263
8207711,5,B000T4G8UI,"I have almost all of the Debbie Siebers dvd's and have been doing them since August. This work out is great. I alternated this with some of her other ones and if you're looking for a great work out to do on those mornings you don't have much time this is one of the ones that you will enjoy. It is well explained and quick moving. You don't do anything long enough to get bored. Try this you will love it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NEW-Cardio-Sculpt-Express-Debbie-Siebers-Slim-in-6-Series-DVD/dp/B000T4G8UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NEW Cardio Sculpt!
