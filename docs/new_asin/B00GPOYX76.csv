6097852,5,B00GPOYX76,The Shortest Way Home about C.S. Lewis was very concise and informative.,1405814400,2,72,5.083333333333333
6097853,3,B00GPOYX76,"As a C. S. Lewis fanatic, I was excited to pick up this DVD and watch it. ""The Shortest Way Home: C. S. Lewis & Mere Christianity"" was true to the thoughts of Lewis, but it wasn't anything overly new.  For someone familiar with Lewis and his book ""Mere Chistianity,"" there probably is not anything here that will add much to what they already know.

The film follows the outline of Lewis' book rather closely. It serves, in a way, as a summary of and minor commentary on Lewis' thoughts in ""Mere Christianity.""

Interspersed throughout are small ""discussions"" between someone who is a Christian and someone who is seeking answers while reading the book as a class assignment.  The acting here is not the best, in my opinion, but some of the questions and responses are worth considering.

If you are just getting into Lewis' book yourself, or if you know someone who is, this would make a great companion DVD. Otherwise, there may be other videos that give more insight into Lewis.",1405296000,7,981,4.6473988439306355

6097867,5,B00GPOYX76,This is the best no holds bared video on basic (mere) Christianity. It keeps the viewers attention through-out the presentation and answers many questions for those who are searching. I have been a student of scripture for over 20 years and some of the ways that Lewis opens the truths of scriptures even blew my mind.

6097883,4,B00GPOYX76,"As a Lutheran student since Kindergarten through college, the apologetics aspect of finally finding out why we believe what we believe has always been fascinating. When debating the ""doorknockers"" like JW's and LDS bikers, I embarked on the apologetics line of thinking so finding out what turned an atheist into a believer was likewise interesting. I appreciated Lewis' melding of the philosophical & spiritual reasoning which lead him to his conclusions. I would recommend this film as an introduction to his theological works. But reading his books--as I remember--offered a much better read then reflect pace. The Screwtape Letters was a more entertaining (but substantive) while Mere Christianity is a scholarly search and discover reasoning exercise in why the Christian faith makes sense ultimately.",1474934400,2,806,5.508064516129032

A little dry in places, but I cannot help but give it five stars if for just the presentation several times of the way to salvation. No doubt the BBC or American public radio wouldn't dare broadcast any of C.S. Lewis' words today. Heaven knows someone might get ""offended"" by the free gift of God's love through Jesus.

6097917,2,B00GPOYX76,"In advance of starting a ""Mere Christianity"" book club, I purchased the DVD of ""The Shortest Way Home: C.S. Lewis & Mere Christianity,"" in hopes that it would be a nice informational starting point that we could watch together before jumping into the book, knowing that a bunch of people in our group have not only never read the book but know very little about Lewis.  And I was so disappointed that I decided not to show it at all.

My primary critique is just the cheesiness of the entire production.  The ""dialogue"" between two college students was downright painful to watch.  The acting was weak, but no one could have saved that script.  There was a totally random and unnecessary scene with the narrator ordering a coffee in the same coffee shop were these gals were chatting.  As I was watching, I was chuckling to myself, thinking, ""What in the world is this nonsense?""  And the cheese factor extended to the background scenes which provided a backdrop to the narration, which was a series of weird vignettes from church services or a family eating breakfast together, which had absolutely nothing to do with the material that was being discussed.  It was just painful.

And, frankly, I was unimpressed with the team of interviewed experts, who ranged from boring to rambling.  With all of the genuine Lewis scholars out there, I was baffled that one of the three selected interviewees was the leader of an obscure campus ministry, with no mentioned academic credentials or noteworthy Lewis expertise.  Though there were a few snippets that were valuable and/or interesting, I thought this portion of the production, which could have been the most substantive and insightful, was stale and uninspired.

Ultimately, I just thought this DVD was a mess.  Obviously, others have found it to be helpful, but again, I was so impressed by its amateurish content and style that I didn't even show it to my group.  For a book as substantial and timeless as ""Mere Christianity,"" this hour-long documentary doesn't even remotely do it justice.  If you're looking for some context about ""Mere Christianity,"" I'd recommend Eric Metaxas' ""Discussing 'Mere Christianity'"" small group DVD curriculum instead (the study guide for which was written by one of this DVD's experts).  Even better, just read Lewis, one of the finest Christian minds and writers in all of history.",1455667200,2,2367,4.9393939393939394

6098020,5,B00GPOYX76,"As a 34 year old that is new to my faith in Jesus this video is INCREDIBLY helpful in showing me how far Ive come in the last 4 years of walking, stumbling, backsliding and succeeding in letting go of myself and instead focusing on Christ and just how far I have to go...how very very far i still have to go. Best yet about C.S Lewis and his views explained in this video was that it helps me not only explain myself as a christian more simply and clearly, but God willing, will help me be able to continue to share the truth of Jesus to others in a more Reasonable and logical way,  It also helped  to  reinforcing my  Faith in the Holy Bible and by reminding me not let emotions or an active imagination to get in the way of spreading the Good news of Christ's work for us in the same manner that l Jesus did--with love and patience and kindness and with power as we are working to follow Jesus and hence we are striving to be like him-to be Children of the one true God. That is Huge and life encompassing,C.S remainds us that like Jesus we must also not  allow  pride or judgment to get in the way of the truth of the Gospel message.  Its Hard, Lewis allows, for us  to mirror Jesus , but thats whats required of us, so that as much as possible we can more and more mirror Jesus  to other people who do not know him as their savior, their redeemer, their God yet...and to do so, we must have less and less of ourselves.  BRAVO to the team that brough this video to us and Thank you!-jeannette A. Gardea",1420848000,12,1506,4.109215017064846

6098022,3,B00GPOYX76,Not sure what I expected. I would rather have had a re-enactment of the BBC broadcasts. The words of Lewis himself are always good. The rest was so-so.,1406419200,,151,4.428571428571429

However.

The theologists and the writing otherwise capture Mere Christianity extremely well.  I enjoyed every second of this since I wasn't watching it for the acting.",1526860800,,251,5.024390243902439
