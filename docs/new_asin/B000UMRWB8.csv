8213830,5,B000UMRWB8,Saw this movie in a child development class. Great true story!,1523836800,,62,4.7272727272727275
8213831,4,B000UMRWB8,"This is great to share with kids, but adults should see it too! Powerful look at a piece of MLK's story that we didn't learn about. Some of the old footage is a bit hard to hear, but it's a great combination of history from the 60's and recent interviews with those who participated in the March.",1487030400,,296,4.2105263157894735
8213832,5,B000UMRWB8,"An excellent documentary about a very important chapter in our history.  How heartening that some of our most important leaders were also some of our youngest.  We should never doubt the potential of our children.  Given opportunity, they can teach us a lot.",1460246400,,258,4.953488372093023

It should be required viewing.....",1421107200,,81,4.857142857142857
8213834,5,B000UMRWB8,All too easy to forget the early days of Doctor King's activism. Sadly many teachers will probably need the accompanying guide. I highly recommend this package as part of every home library for a family with children in high school.,1382745600,,232,4.825
8213835,3,B000UMRWB8,"While I think the subject matter is excellent, and while there are many things about this documentary that I did like (for example I thought the use of the re-enactments were very creative and that they took the documentary to a whole other level) I have to give it three stars due to some of the editorial choices that the producers made.  And the number one reason for the three stars is the choice of the theme song, which is a song when taken by itself, praises Alabama.  I know that was not the producers' conscious intent, and I felt it was chosen for irony, but in choosing that song, I could tell that this subject matter was not being told through the eyes of the recipient of the horrid history of the US -- the Black African.  I do however feel that the choice of that song says quite a bit about the producers' subconscious intent, which was to tell this tale of horror in a way that absolves the white perpetrators of racism of guilt and responsibility.  Ultimately the message was that although this horrible history happened, the White people of Alabama at that time were still good people.

And that is a message with which I completely disagree.  But having said this, I am still appreciative of the work that was done to bring to light the tremendous contribution that Black youth played in the Civil Rights struggle.  Their story is very inspiring and must be told.",1381536000,,1384,4.512
8213836,5,B000UMRWB8,A wonderful chronicle of real life (young) people's power that made long-needed change happen. I highly recommend for you history buffs.,1379376000,,136,5.523809523809524
