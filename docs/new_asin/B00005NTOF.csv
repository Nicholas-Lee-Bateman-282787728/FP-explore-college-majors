1637173,4,B00005NTOF,"Good war action movie. Dennis Morgan in the lead role is excellent as Col. Robert L. Scott. Alan Hale Sr. has a great supporting supporting role as ""Big Mike"" Harrigan, the Mission Priest who doubles as the Base Chaplain for the American Volunteer Group (AVG) Flying Tigers. I always watched this film whenever it was on TV when I was a kid. The last time that I saw in on TV was about 10 years ago. I taped it and then later erased it by mistake. I have been looking for a copy to call my own ever since. There is a poem called ""And They Believed"" that Big Mike recites to Col. Scott while they are flying to Fr. Mike's new mission assignment. I love this poem so much that I have a printed copy on my wall at home. Would love to see this movie again and again.",1074902400,32,762,4.086666666666667
1637174,4,B00005NTOF,"Dennis Morgan stars as fighter pilot Colonel Robert Lee Scott who flies with the Flying Tigers, trying to keep the Burma Road open, while also launching attacks into Hong Kong, trying to strike down the Japanese Navy.  Scott believes in himself and in luck, while missionary priest Alan Hale tries to make him see that God's hand can be found all over.  Morgan is good in the lead role, and well supported by Hale and many familiar character actors with faces you might remember, even if their names escape you.  The film isn't quite as moralistic as the title would suggest, although Morgan's gradual acceptance of God's power is certainly at the heart of the film. I imagine that the image of God taking care of everyone must have been a comfort to audiences at a time when the world had been turned upside down. The film is also filled with some terrific air battles, replete with some bad Japanese trash talking (did Forties' audiences buy this?). I've seen enough Forties war films to expect that, as well as some stiff, corny dialogue between the fliers, and I find that part of the fun of watching these kinds of movies.  At only an hour and a half, the film moves along quickly, mixing in enough action with the sentiment to keep me entertained.",1015718400,63,1253,4.605381165919282

1637206,5,B00005NTOF,"Just touches the surface of the Flying Tigers story, and doesn't really do justice to Scott's autobiography. If you like WWII history and especially the air war, please pick up a copy of Col. Scott's book. If you would like to know more about the Flying Tigers, read ""The Maverick War"" by Duane Schultz. The footage of real P-40s and B-25s is definitely worth the price of admission. By today's standards, of course, the aerial combat scenes are pretty cheesy. As usual, the Jap Zeroes are AT-6 Texan trainers. And there are some continuity problems with different transports showing up in the scenes about flying ""the Hump"" over the Himalayas. I seriously doubt that Gen. Chenault and his senior staff members wore their dress uniforms everyday. But Raymond Massey does justice to the general's appearance and stature. Overall, the film holds up pretty good as a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of Col. Scott's tenure with the Flying Tigers, even if he didn't get there until the end of their existence as a clandestine unit ""on loan"" to the Chinese government.",1448755200,,1054,4.893854748603352

1637230,4,B00005NTOF,"This 1945 war propaganda film, telling a true story, is still a quite watchable thing and I think also the best movie about the ""Flying Tigers"". It was adapted from a best-selling book written in 1943 by a real American fighter ace, Colonel Robert Lee Scott, who described in it his real war time experience in India and in China in 1942, at a time when the issue of the war was still far from being decided.

Below, more information about Colonel Scott, as well as more of my impressions about both the book and the film, with some limited SPOILERS.

1. Colonel Scott.

Robert Lee Scott Jr. (12 April 1908 - 27 February 2006) was born in Waynesboro, Georgia and he graduated from West Point in 1932. He then served successively in US Army Air Corps (1932-1941), US Army Air Forces (1941-47) and United States Air Force (1947-1957), reaching ultimately the rank of Brigadier General.

During his early years in service he flew air mail, commanded a fighter squadron in Panama and was an instructor. In 1941, immediately after Pearl Harbour, he asked for an assignment to a fighter squadron - but was told he was already too aged...
Unwilling to stay an instructor when others were fighting he volunteered to fly B-17 heavy bombers from USA to Burma (via Caribbean, Brazil, Africa, Middle East and India). Once this mission finished he was affected to transport missions, flying from Assam over Himalayas to China, carrying all kind of cargo possible and imaginable.

Finally, in June 1942, Scott got his dreamed assignment - together with promotion to colonel he received the command of USAAF 23 Fighter Group, which operated in China and was the successor of the famous 1st American Volunteer Group of Chinese Air Force, better known as ""Flying Tigers"". As commander of this unit Scott flew 388 combat missions in 925 hours from July 1942 to October 1943, shooting down 13 Japanese aircraft to become one of America's earliest flying aces of the war.

Recalled to USA in October 1943 Scott served for a time at the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida. He returned to China in 1944 to fly fighter-bomber aircraft specialised in ground attacks, especially with rockets. In summer 1945 his unit was transferred to Okinawa from which its planes led strikes against enemy coastal shipping until the end of war.

Scott continued a distinguished career after the war and reached the rank of Brigadier General. He retired in 1957. He continued flying as a civilian and USAF also invited him occasionally to fly modern planes, for public relations operations. In 1984 he flew a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon jet fighter, in 1995 a McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and on his 89th birthday (!) in 1997, Scott piloted the enormous super-modern bomber B-1B Lancer.

He was also author of twelve books, of which this one, written in 1943, is the most known - and also is the only one to be made into a movie (at least until now). Retired general Scott died in 2006, at greatly advanced age of 97.

2. The book ""God is my co-pilot""

Published in 1943, the book describes Scott's life from his early childhood to the end of 1942. It was written when the war still raged and the issue was still not certain - and this critical situation on all fronts can be well felt through the pages...

In the book Scott wrote that he was clearly BORN to fly planes and especially fighter planes. He admits that this was everything he wanted from life even as a little boy and with time this passion grew only stronger. He had to work hard and even struggle to make his dream come true, as he had to first get to West Point and then graduate to become a pilot - and neither was an easy task.

He enjoyed his peace time career but in 1941 he welcomed war with a kind of guilty pleasure feeling - because even if it was a great tragedy for countless millions of people, for him it was an opportunity to take a modern, powerful warplane into a fight and test his skills against the best pilots and the best planes in the world. But fighting was not the only thing he enjoyed - his description of a lonely expedition on board of an outdated fighter he ""borrowed"" to fly alone over Mount Everest shows a man simply madly, truly, deeply in love with flying.

From his first experiences in Burma-India-China war theatre Scott learned to respect the skills of Japanese pilots and he never underestimated the enemy - but he also hated them passionately for cruelty shown to Chinese civilians and also allied pilots (the Japanese routinely shot pilots who jumped with parachute from their burning planes). In this he was in good company as most American pilots in China shared his feelings. Modern reader can be particularly shocked by one phrase cited by Scott, when a fellow officer, asked if it wouldn't be nice if all the Japanese could be eliminated simultaneously by pressing a button, answered: ""No, because it is too much fun killing them slowly, one by one..."" Scott also claims in the strongest possible terms that he never lost a moment of sleep over all the Japanese he killed in the airs or when strafing them on the ground.

Unlike what the title may suggest, his book contained only few religious tones. Author makes a short allusion to his Christian beliefs, he states also at one moment that considering all the perils he survived he sometimes had the feeling that some greater force watched over him and he concludes his book with a beautiful poem/prayer written by a British RAF pilot John Magee who was killed in Battle of Britain:

""Up, up the long delirious burning blue
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark, or even eagle, flew,
And while with silent, lifting mind I've trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God""

That being said the main reason for the title of this book is, I believe, author's feeling that he fought the good fight, against hateful enemies. The general tone of this book is patriotic and enthusiastic and I think author was sincere when writing it. He was clearly very proud of his Confederate ancestry (for some reason a large majority of American pilots in China, beginning with general Chennault himself, were from South) but even more proud of being an American and his faith in his country's ability to overcome every challenge is overwhelming. After seeing many countries of the world he states in his book loud and clear, that United States created the best society for human beings to live in and that defending this mode of life is worth taking every risk. He also considered that without a shadow of doubt the Japanese and their allies fought for a bad cause.

This kind of vision of the world, simple but nevertheless I believe globally sound, is actually a refreshing thing to read - and it certainly helps to better understand those men of the Great Generation, who faced and defeated the Axis alliance.

3. The film

PRECISION: this is Region 1 NTSC DVD. It will NOT play on European Region 2 equipment. Also, there is NO subtitles - which makes a couple of lines of dialogs exchanged in the middle of a stoirm hard to understand.

The film was made in 1944, when the war in Pacific and China still raged and released on 7 March 1945, when Americans were preparing the invasion of Japan itself - a battle in which it was expected that GIs, Marines, aviators and sailors will suffer colossal losses. Half a million of dead was the MINIMAL estimation for the cost of invasion of Japan - a number far superior to the combined losses suffered by USA on all fronts from December 1941 to March 1945. That actually can explain both the ultrajingoistic but also the very grave tone of the film, especially when showing how terrible were the atrocities inflicted by the Japanese to the Chinese and how brave were the latter in their opposition against such a pitiless foe. The general tone of this film doesn't promise a merry, joyful shootout - it actually states that even if final victory is certain, the road to it will be marked by blood, sweat and tears.

Colonel Scott is played very well by Dennis Morgan, a tall, handsome and athletic actor/singer who never made a very big career but from what I could read about him was a rather likeable fellow, who frequently preferred to pass over a role to spend more time with his wife and kids. Quite exceptionnally for Hollywood he married only once and stayed married to his wife Lillian for 61 years, until his death...

General Chennault, the commander of ""Flying Tigers"", is played by Canadian actor Raymond Massey (1896-1983), a quite remarkable character, born into money as he was the grandson of creator and owner of the renowned Massey-Harris Tractor Company. He gave a good account of himself serving in Canadian artillery in France in First World War, but once the war was over he decided to become an actor. He appeared in a lot of well known film, like ""Fountainhead"", ""Arsenic and Old Laces"" or ""David and Batsheba"", albeit always in secondary roles. Here he gives a very good performance as the legendary leader of ""Flying Tigers"".

The film follows the book in great lines, but as it is relatively short (88 minutes) quite a lot had to be left untreated. On another hand some things were added, especially the character of Father ""Big Mike"" Harrigan, an Irish missionary in China. This priest is important as he teaches to Scott THE PRAYER - one of the most beautiful and most ardent Christian prayers I ever heard. Sorry for the SPOILER here, but I simply cannot resist the temptation to reproduce it here in its integrality, especially considering that it is said in the middle of a storm and can be hard to fully understand (there is no subtitles):

""They who had scorned the thought of any strength except their own to lean on,
learned at length how fear can sabotage the bravest heart.
And human weakness answering to the prod of terror calls, ""Help us, O God.""
And silence lets the silent voice be heard, bringing its message like a spoken word,
""BELIEVE, BELIEVE IN ME! CAST OUT YOUR FEAR.
OH, I'M NOT UP THERE BEYOND THE SKY, BUT HERE, RIGHT HERE IN YOUR HEART.
I AM THE STRENGTH YOU SEEK. BELIEVE! ONLY BELIEVE.""

This is my purely personal interpretation but I think the reason why this prayer was written and introduced into this film was part of an effort to fortify the resolve of soldiers who were going to invade Japan - and wage what, based on experiences of Tarawa, Saipan, Peleliu and Iwo Jima, was expected to be the most apocalyptic battle in all history... Fortunately for American soldiers, atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki prevented this battle from happening...

Other than this mighty prayer, the strongest part of the film are air fighting scenes, exceptionally good for 1945. Many excellent pictures of P-40 fighters, as well as B-25 Mitchell medium bombers and B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers are included.

This film is also, I think, the best description of life and fight of ""Flying Tigers"". It includes a detailed information about their early warning and communication system as well as some humouristic peculiarities of their daily routine...)))

Bottom line, this is a quite watchable old war film, certainly made for propaganda purposes, but nevertheless still interesting. I will certainly keep my DVD for a future re-viewing. Recommended to all aviation enthusiasts and to all amateurs of war movies. ENJOY!",1416528000,2,11462,4.714642678660669

It would be fantastic if hollywood made a re-make of this old classic or a new movie about the Flying Tigers. Why not ??...Hollywood made a movie only last year about theTuskegee Airman with Red Tails...great special effects. Why not honor the heroes of the Flying Tigers.,1356220800,,568,4.268518518518518

1637298,4,B00005NTOF,"I had the original VHS and longed for DVD. I was so glad when I found it. When it came , I played it right away
but was disappointed that in parts it would catch and not move forward so had to take it out and reinsert it
and it would go further without catching but I finally got it to play all the way through!! I know it is not my
player because it was new!! However I did read on the site that it was formatted for DVD players only and mine is
VHS/CD,DVD combo so not sure that made a difference or not but am still thrilled to own this piece of history!
 But I will keep my original VHS also. Dennis Morgan who stars in it is supposed to be related to our family.

1637312,1,B00005NTOF,"I am a great fan of Robert L. Scott and have read his book a million times. However, if you want a movie that is historically accurate or follows the book this movie is from a definite Hollywood viewpoint being biased against Chenault and showing Scott as this sychotic, atheist freak who finally comes to a belief in some kind of god. Which to anyone who reads the book is complete nonsense.",1111536000,7,392,4.458333333333333
1637313,4,B00005NTOF,"Ever since I first saw this movie back in 1960, the P-40 has been my favorite fighter plane.  I did alot of reading on the Flying Tigers and continue to search out new literature about them.  This movie is much more accurate than the John Wayne film covering time frames and dates.  By the time Col Scott arrived on the scene, the Flying Tigers were flying the P-40E models which are similar to the F models you see in the film.  There are some misconceptions about the Flying Tigers that these two films support that are simply not true.  They were fighting the Japanese Army Air Force, not the Japanese Naval Air Force.  As such, they were flying against KI-43 'Oscar' fighter planes, not Zero's.  Secondly, although the Flying Tigers were in place before America entered the war, their actual first combat took place on December 20th, 13 days AFTER Pearl Harbor.  Raymond Massey's advice to Dennis Morgan concerning combat tactics was true. Allied pilots who turned with a Japanese fighter on their tail often got shot down.  The Japanese planes in the movie were actually AT6 Texans.  The flight scenes were performed at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. The movie deals with issues that I'm sure many combat veterans must have experienced, but doesn't get too sentimental.  Since the Flying Tigers were our real first glimpse of success against the Japanese, it was fitting that they should be honored.  Col Scott proved to be an excellent leader staying in China till the end helping Chenault. This movie is fun to watch not only for the flight scenes but also that period's view point of our enemy.  Richard Loo, who played the Japanese ace 'Tokyo Joe' in this movie also played the Chinese doctor giving the physical exams in the John Wayne film.  Also, the English speaking Japanese radio announcer in the first part of this movie, Philip Ahn, also appeared in the film Battle Hymn with Rock Hudson.  He also played various Korean characters in several tv episodes of M*A*S*H. The sounds of the planes and the machine guns seems accurate and the black and white format just makes this film more enjoyable.  If you are a fan of combat aviation, or like films of the '40's, you will enjoy God is My Co-Pilot.",1102982400,31,2213,4.694300518134715
1637314,4,B00005NTOF,"The oldest book in my possession is my Landmark Books #105 copy of John Toland's book about ""The Flying Tigers.""  When I was given this book as a birthday present as a boy I happened to be living on Chennault Drive on McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, so there was something to be said for knowing the story of the man whose name was on the street sign on the corner.  There was also the fact that the P40B-Tomahawk with its shark teeth was a cool looking fighter plane and that there were Americans who were fighting the bad guys before the United States entered World War II.

Based on Colonel Robert L. Scott's memoirs, ""God Is My Co-Pilot"" tells of how Scott (Dennis Morgan) had always dreamed of being a fighter pilot but when World War II starts he is stuck flying transport planes over ""The Hump"" into China.  But then he persuades General Claire Lee Chennault (Raymond Massey) to let him fly with the Flying Tigers, the American Volunteer Group that was fighting the Japanese in the skies over China before Pearl Harbor.  By the time the Flying Tigers are replaced by the U.S. Army Air Corps, Scott has made his reputation and assumed a key leadership role in the group.  The title comes into play periodically when Scott talks with Big Mike (Alan Hale, Sr.) a priest ministering to the Chinese, who is available for brief discussions on the role of faith in combat.  But mostly the film is about shooting down lots and lots of Japanese aircraft.

From a historical perspective the film is more accurate than John Wayne's ""Flying Tigers"" movie, which is more of a traditional World War II melodrama (two buddies fight the Japanese and each other for the girl they both love).  For example, ""Tex"" Hill was one of the key characters in Toland's book and he shows up here in a major role, played by John Ridgely.  More importantly, you get a sense for a real group of fighter pilots, flying a small number of outdated airplanes against the newer and faster Zeroes of the Imperial Japanese Air Force and doing more than hold their own.  This is primarily Scott's story, but the history of the Flying Tigers and the pilots that replaced them is still the backbone of the narrative.  You also have some foreshadowing of ""12 O'Clock High,"" where it looks like Scott will not be able to go on the big mission, just when the Americans are finally going on the offensive to finish off the Japanese.  But unlike General Frank Savage, Colonel Scott has that whole co-pilot thing going for him, not to mention a priest, and a commanding general who still considers himself a fighter pilot at heart.

Keep in mind the movie was made in 1945, which explains the vitriolic racism underlying the aerial combat as the American pilots banter with Tokyo Joe (Richard Loo), the Japanese ace.  When Chennault's aviators bomb Hong Kong, the Japanese slap a woman in a prisoner of war camp cheering the sight.  Then there is the contrast with the scenes back in Scott's hometown of Macon, Georgia, where whites and blacks celebrate his kills with equal joy.  So the stereotypes are a little unsettling on both sides, but this is to be expected for a movie that was made while the war was still going on (""God Is My Co-Pilot"" premiered on February 21, 1945), where propaganda was always a consideration.  Fortunately that racist elements are not the main part of the film and the aerial combat sequences are pretty good, at least until the pilots starting tossing insults at each other (Scott's coup de grace for Joe is, ""There's your six feet of China. Go fill it up"").",1102032000,18,3557,4.60126582278481
