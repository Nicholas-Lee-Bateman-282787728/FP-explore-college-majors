3884142,3,B002AJQ7HE,"I don't speak the language so I imagine I missed some things in this movie.  The movie ended with questions but I really wasn't interested in knowing the answers.  Where did ""he"" go?  Did ""they"" finally resolve ""his"" disappearance?  Why did ""she"" tell ""him"" to leave and then go looking for ""him""?",1429488000,,297,4.653846153846154
3884143,5,B002AJQ7HE,Beautiful  and accurate,1425254400,,23,6.666666666666667
3884144,5,B002AJQ7HE,I really enjoyed this movie with all the interesting food preparation and the story was a good one too.,1424563200,,103,4.473684210526316
3884145,5,B002AJQ7HE,"It was a great movie! Keeping in mind about the things women in Iran can and cannot do, I thought it was an interesting movie and it's definitely worth the watch!",1423094400,,162,4.258064516129032
3884146,2,B002AJQ7HE,"From the movie description one might expect deep character development, involved cooking scenes, delicate drama , but there was little of that. The movie slowly plods along until finally it ends and you ask yourself. Why did I watch this?",1388534400,,238,4.975
3884147,3,B002AJQ7HE,The movie is is about an Iranian woman who has a restaurant on the property of her ex fiance and when he suddenly returns she's afraid he'll take away everything. It's entertaining but I think it ends abruptly without giving closure for the story.,1363219200,,247,4.636363636363637
3884148,5,B002AJQ7HE,"This is a gentle film about lives and loves disrupted, the consequences of political exile, good food lovingly prepared, and a charming town on the Caspian sea. Contrary to a previous reviewer'r's opinion, it is not at all ambiguous if you watch and listen carefully. I've watched it three times so far and I like it more each time... The place itself is so seductive, I keep wanting to just be there...",1265760000,4,403,4.611111111111111
3884149,2,B002AJQ7HE,"Some important subjects were alluded to pertaining to the role of women in Iranian society but a lackluster, mediocre and incomplete rendering of those subjects left this audience confused and empty. The writer & director, if they are going to tell a story, they should finish their story however they think is appropriate and not leave it up to the audience to create their own ending. This ambiguity laden story telling style is a self-righteous attempt to be clever, intelligent and complex. But instead shows a lack of direction. The acting was flat, lacking emotion and depth. The story seemed to plod through many scenes and lacked impact where many opportunities to showcase Iranian culture presented themselves.",1255996800,4,719,5.153846153846154
3884150,3,B002AJQ7HE,"Tasteless plot. Filled with fake laughters.
The only part I liked about the movie was the abundant depiction of food in it.",1483574400,,123,4.636363636363637
3884151,5,B002AJQ7HE,"Loved it, reminded me Tehran is not the whole of Iran",1482624000,,53,3.909090909090909
3884152,4,B002AJQ7HE,"This is a very pleasant movie, appropriate for anyone who likes the genre.

The ending is a bit less tidy than I would like, but then, this is not a Hollywood movie.",1475798400,,165,4.15625
3884153,4,B002AJQ7HE,Good story.,1474848000,,11,5.0
3884154,2,B002AJQ7HE,"I expected more from this movie than it delivered. The acting was two-dimensional: facial expressions of the same sort (e.g., Aziz the protagonist's perennial half smile,) were repeated over and over. The issue of women's role in Iranian society was never dealt with in any depth. And the storyline itself took a turn toward cutesy--should I say cowardly, instead?--ambiguity, leaving all major issues inexplicably unresolved.",1470960000,,426,5.569230769230769
3884155,5,B002AJQ7HE,Stunning film. I'll watch it again.,1466985600,,35,5.0
3884156,5,B002AJQ7HE,"Beautiful movie .... about love, beauty, joy, food!",1466208000,,51,5.5
3884157,3,B002AJQ7HE,"Iranian films are usually my favorites, but this one fell flat. The acting was fine; the behavior of the two lovers to one another was too contrived, and I became so bored that I did not watch to the end.",1464998400,,204,4.125
3884158,5,B002AJQ7HE,"When I first began watching this movie, I wasn't sure I would continue but then I became ""hooked"" and now I have watched it twice and it joins my small list of favorites that I like to watch over and over.  It's the first Iranian movie that I've seen and I was so surprised by the beauty of the Caspian sea, the countryside, the bountiful and beautiful food market, the tree bursting with apricots.  The colorful clothing of the women and their comfort wearing their long dresses and pinafores. rather like the prairie dresses of the early West - well it is so different from the pictures we see in reports about Iran.  I realized how little I know of that country.  The joking and joy of these hardworking women who run a restaurant to support themselves was enjoyable.  The food produced in their kitchen is gorgeous and looks so delicious.  Seeing them drive their battered old pickup and deal with changing a tire was surprising. I love these glimpses  of  nitty-gritty life.  All the stereotypes of somber people in black clothing are shattered here in a battered but beautiful town on the Caspian Sea.  There are scenes of great beauty.  The story ending is just too subtle for this American mind that wanted a resolution.  Some of the interaction between characters is only inferred but not acted out.  There is a certain modesty in interpersonal relations that is kept so that not all is revealed to the viewer. I liked that but with only captions and given cultural differences, I probably missed clues.",1462752000,8,1512,4.681818181818182
3884159,4,B002AJQ7HE,Enjoyed it.,1461024000,,11,5.0
3884160,2,B002AJQ7HE,"Pg 13 by American standards. Actually, I think they teach  more in first grade about love and relationships. This is a simplistic movie about a complicated culture that has not changed in thousands of years. Interesting, but no big deal.",1459209600,,237,4.925
3884161,2,B002AJQ7HE,Somewhat confusing and uneven. I stayed with it though and it did have its charms,1454457600,,81,4.466666666666667
3884162,4,B002AJQ7HE,Enjoyed this movie.,1453507200,,19,5.666666666666667
3884163,2,B002AJQ7HE,Rather confusing and got bored halfway through.,1451174400,,47,5.857142857142857
3884164,5,B002AJQ7HE,Importance of eating together. So base to our existence yet we view it as an incovenience.,1449187200,,90,4.6875
3884165,4,B002AJQ7HE,"Turned out to have a classic French ending, I hate French endings! Other than that, it was a nice movie. My girlfriend is Iranian, so she didn't need the subtitles.",1447718400,2,164,4.5
3884166,2,B002AJQ7HE,"Not serious, even though it is a serious theme.  A lot of cut-up for a serious theme.  But the goofiness was OK. The ending was typical European style - ""what the heck was that all about?""  I guess the director didn't know how to end it -- or he thought he was clever.  I can't guess what the ending was about.  Surely, was she about to go back to the guy she didn't care a thing about that had abandoned her?  After a whole movie about how she disliked the fact that he 'had done her wrong""??",1444176000,2,493,4.030927835051546
3884167,5,B002AJQ7HE,"This is an excellent Persian (Iranian) film, the scenery is beautiful as the film has been made by the Caspian Sea near the Port of Anzali, the colors are gorgeous and the cast play very well. The story is also well written, and film has been well directed. A must watch!",1443398400,2,271,4.333333333333333
3884168,4,B002AJQ7HE,Great characters and story.  Ending is ok.,1443225600,,42,5.0
3884169,4,B002AJQ7HE,This a beautiful movie that puts the reader in another culture and demonstrates that human values of love and faithfulness transcend culture.,1441584000,,141,5.454545454545454
3884170,3,B002AJQ7HE,"Usually I enjoy Iranian movies but this was disappointing. The protagonist returns to his home on the Caspian Sea from spending some time in an Iranian prison presumably for political reasons. His old girl friend and three other woman have occupied his house while he was away and turned the ground floor into a very popular restaurant. They fear that he will evict them and resume living in the house. The man moves into an upper room and the restaurant continues to operate. The main characters never communicate their fears nor intentions. The women talk and giggle too much and the man is reticent. The scenery is beautiful, a green oasis in the desert landcape of Iran. Perhaps I don't fully appreciate Iranian culture but this movie left me rather empty and wanting resolultion.",1440806400,,784,4.858208955223881
3884171,5,B002AJQ7HE,"I love this movie a lot.
When I have guests and they ask to see a movie and I know they haven't seen this movie, this I go for. It's like a theatrical play which has become a movie. The colors the foods and the colors again are so lively, so amazing. It's all about life. Being human. I'm pretty sure a lot of people who would read this comment would agree with this.",1440806400,6,367,3.972972972972973
3884172,1,B002AJQ7HE,Wasn't my cup of tea.  Could not get into it at all.,1439164800,,52,3.3333333333333335
3884173,5,B002AJQ7HE,"The Fish Fall in Love (2006) is a beautifully-filmed, bittersweet love story. Two decades after he left, Aziz (Reza Kianan) returns to his hometown, a small coastal town off the Caspian Coast, with the Alborz Mountains in the distance. This serene setting provides a backdrop for the tale that is about to unfold. Aziz has returned to settle his affairs pertaining to the properties he owns: a home in town and a cabin in the mountains (the latter has been maintained by his faithful friend Younes). He finds out that his former love, Atieh (Roya Nonahali) is running a restaurant with her daughter Touka (Golshifteh Farahani) and two other women  Atiehs abusive husband whom she was forced to marry after Aziz left is presumed lost at sea and so she has had to fend for herself.

Azizs arrival in town ruffles a few feathers and sets tongues wagging.  Why is he back? Atieh assumes the worst  that Aziz has come back to reclaim his home which she has converted into a popular restaurant, and behaves in a cold manner towards him. Meanwhile, Touka is out of her mind with worry because her fianc Reza has gone missing.

The stories are all inter-connected and as the narrative unfolds, it becomes apparent what happened in the past and how the events of the past have shaped the present. The performance of the entire cast is to be commended and provides an interesting insight not only into the human heart but also into aspects of Iranian culture. I loved the scenes where the women are busy cooking  it becomes obvious after a while that Atieh and also her daughter, enjoy the art of cooking, and express their feelings through the food they prepare. I loved watching all the different dishes being prepared and only wish they were named in the film so I could look it up in a cookbook!

The love story is complex: how do two middle-aged people reconcile the feelings they had for each other with the doubts, trepidation, and resentments of the present, and how do they voice what they actually feel? Aziz attempts to reach out to Atieh but Atieh is too angry and hurt to reciprocate. Atiehs daughter Touka falls prey to town gossips who compare her circumstance with that of her mother in the past  left waiting for a man that never showed up. Will Touka end up in the same predicament her mother did?

I love how the director (Ali Rafie) uses a backstory to move the narrative in the present. I found this device to be compelling and it certainly held my attention. The beautiful Iranian music in the background adds to atmosphere. This contemplative film is well-worth ones time.",1438992000,8,2585,4.651315789473684

3884177,5,B002AJQ7HE,"Beautiful, gentle film about a couple whose life together is interrupted when the husband is arrested as a revolutionary, and the wife must find a way to make a life for herself, her daughter, and eventually two other women by turning their home into a successful restaurant. The various dishes look fragrantly sumptuous, and the film lovingly details the fresh ingredients -- from gorgeous tomatoes and eggplants to visits to a wet market with freshly caught fish flopping on the pavement stones. One of my favorite settings is a small eatery on the pier, with waves crashing against the rocks in the background. The only drawback is that the quality of the film is a bit rough. But otherwise, a film well worth seeing!",1431129600,,720,4.814516129032258
3884178,4,B002AJQ7HE,"This was a fun movie. .. Lots of reading, but the characters were pleasant to look at.  Liked the loyalty amongst the women.",1430956800,,124,4.391304347826087
3884179,5,B002AJQ7HE,"This is a beautiful story of love, hope, tragedy and human resilliance. A sotry set in Iran's picturesque Manzandaran province.

The characters are well developed and the plot unfolds nicely. Very heartwarming. a definate must see.",1430697600,2,231,5.416666666666667
8359532,5,B002AJQ7HE,I love this movie!,1527811200,,18,3.75
8359533,2,B002AJQ7HE,"Interesting to get glimpses into another culture, but the lack of relevant dialogue made it hard to understand what was happening.  And there were quick cuts from one scene to another that left me in the dark.  And the ending remains a mystery - I have more questions than answers.",1512432000,,281,4.6

Full of positive feelings",1507507200,,61,5.888888888888889
8359535,3,B002AJQ7HE,Its similar to Cafe Transit in that a woman works hard in the kitchen to support those around her by not compromising on the quality. The sub-titles were a bit off and some were cut off at the bottom but whats said isn't all that important because its pretty clear when the movie is headed. The laughter wore on a little too much but it was worth the watch but not one of the best.,1506816000,,381,4.093333333333334
8359536,5,B002AJQ7HE,Good movie,1501200000,,10,4.5
8359537,2,B002AJQ7HE,I didn't like the way this was filmed.  Made it seem like a very old movie.  Didn't connect with it at all.,1498953600,,107,3.8181818181818183
8359538,5,B002AJQ7HE,very good movie,1488672000,,15,4.333333333333333
8359539,3,B002AJQ7HE,"2 1/2 stars.  Beautifully filmed, beautiful people, and good acting but left me cold.  For me, too much implied and not enough said, and I ordinarily revel in subtlety.  I found it unnecessarily obtuse, thought it would've been improved by making Aziz's intentions clear.  Virtually no interaction between Aziz and his former love, Atieh (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Madonna, I thought).  But what really grated on me were the many shots of the women's interactions, characterized by forced hilarity, inane and often incomprehensible jokes.  These scenes had a self-conscious cultural quality to them, like ""we may be mere women but we have relationships and personalities"", though for me these relationships and personalities lent little in the way of characterization, i.e., didn't make them comprehensible or particularly endearing.  I just found them mostly non-illuminating, boring or so saccharine they put my teeth on edge.

Also irritating was the pointed lack of resolution of Aziz's motives.  Everyone misunderstands him and the record is never set straight.  For me, a series of missed plot opportunities.  As just one example of many, what was Atieh trying to teach her daughter, from her own experience?  NO, NO, NO.  Hardly inspiring.  The ending could've been powerful, but unfortunately the film established little precedent for it.  I would contrast this film with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion/dp/B001DUDKEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Border-Cafe/dp/B00TYP29G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Border Cafe</a>&nbsp;as masterful embodiments of longings from the past and characters' hearts subtly revealed and gloriously fulfilled.  Unless you're an armchair cultural anthropologist and intrigued by the glimpses of Iranian life, cannot recommend.",1486857600,3,1921,6.474509803921569
