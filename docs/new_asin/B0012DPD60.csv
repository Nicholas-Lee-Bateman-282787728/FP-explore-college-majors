8245163,4,B0012DPD60,"From time, we use to observe every country has a filmmaker who works out as the tormented conscious of a state of unsaid things. Fritz Lang and Fassbinder in Germany, Alain Resnais in France, Antonioni and Roselini in Italy, Mizoguchi in Japan, Kaurismaki in Finland, the first Polanski and Wajda in Poland and Greenaway in U.K. constitute a sort of architects of the existential boredom that surround us but that we usually tend to overlook them and accept them as part of our quotidian existence.

""permanent vacation"" is in this sense, an unpleasant, rending and painful portrait about a set of hallucinated personages who have crossed the border of the sanity and have decided not return.

Chris parker is the main character of this urban nightmare, who walks around desert streets and desolated alleys. He meets on the road, a Vietnam vet who still suffers in his mind the horrors of the war; a Latin girl who sings (for not crying) in a wrecked house without walls, a sax player who plays with morbid pleasure the theme ""Over the rainbow"", but that remarks (Aki Kaurismaki would do the same with this theme in Ariel) with poetic cynicism the well known burden ""There` s no place like home"" in
""Wizard of Oz"" .

Parker visits her mother in the hospital and is aware she is out of her mind, establishing her own paradise in the frontiers of the insanity.

But the end of the film will keep you at the border of your seat, once we realize the boredom is global, and all of those who have decided themselves to become outlaw citizens are travellers in search of the new Babylonia.

The movie is hovered by a minimalist atmosphere that reminds us to Antonioni' s The eclipse and Bresson' s The argent.""",1201046400,2,1703,4.644518272425249
