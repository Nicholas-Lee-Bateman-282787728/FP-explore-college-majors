These DVD's keep my scholar's attention and they really do learn their high frequency words. I also like that when I introduce a new word, I can put the DVD on repeat for just that word.",1386979200,4,283,4.2592592592592595
5689479,5,B00C2WHGWY,"This DVD practices some of the common and confusing sight words like to, too and two. The motions that go with the words are fun and help the students to remember both the spelling and meanings of the words. I also own the first sight word CD and plan to buy more.",1364601600,4,264,4.096153846153846

8576835,5,B00C2WHGWY,"Everything Heidi Songs does is awesome! There are catchy jingles and motions for dozens of sight words on this DVD. I love that the songs emphasize spelling the words, not just identifying them. I highly recommend this product, as well as her Sounds Fun DVD, which focus on phonics/digraphs like ch, sh, aw, in addition to her Letter sounds DVD, which has songs and movement for each letter of the alphabet.",1481328000,,407,4.746478873239437

8576842,3,B00C2WHGWY,I thought more spelling of the sight word would be helpful. They kept wanting to take it out. Too much stuff going on to keep their attention.,1406764800,,142,4.296296296296297
8576843,1,B00C2WHGWY,"After seeing Vol 1, this one's going back since it's unopened.
I am sure it is just as boring using the same background and lady in mom-pants.",1387065600,,142,4.296296296296297
