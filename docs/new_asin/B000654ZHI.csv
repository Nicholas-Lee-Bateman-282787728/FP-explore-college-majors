8038721,1,B000654ZHI,"this was supposed to be a 'serious' insight into 'something-or-other' but I don't 'know' what.

it's basically a melange of softcore from the 'seventies' when this type of 'thing' was 'chic'.

before 'vhs/dvd/internet/devices' we had 'cinemas' to watch 'everything'.

the comedic aspect of this film will be 'lost' on most 'viewers', but it's fun to look at how 'ridiculous' humans 'always' are.

the 'pool-scene' with the 'lifeguard' whom the three 'woman' find 'irresistible' is HILARIOUS (if only for the fact that he looks like he belongs on some s3xcrim3 registry).

8038724,3,B000654ZHI,this movie just like the first one fantasm has a lot of little short skits in it with sexual tones so you get lots of nudity but the girls didn't really look good to me. their was only one skit that I liked in the whole film. it had a star in it that I like i cant remember her name right now. but if you can get cheep then go ahead and buy it. if you like soft porn type skits.,1363737600,,378,3.6219512195121952

8038726,3,B000654ZHI,"Films like these are old pornos that have had all the major sex scenes edited out!!!  I hate this!!!!  As an adult and a paying person, I expect to get what I paid for and a collector of rare and vintage films.  We the customers are being cheated!!! Buyers be ware!!!  Don't line filthy film makers pockets if they can't deliver the goods.",1352419200,,339,4.333333333333333
8038727,2,B000654ZHI,"The other reviewer must live in a closet - this flick is a waste of your time and cash. Sure, it`s got hardcore actors and porn stars headlining (no pun intended), but there`s NOTHING sexy, revealing or amusing going on, and the other reviewer is hallucinating when he states that some of the sex isn`t simulated - it`s all BADLY simulated, so it makes me wonder if he`s ever had sex (with a partner, that is). This is tedious viewing for ten year olds -IGNORE the 'X rating', this stuff would only get an 'R rating' in today`s world. Incredibly boring when compared to what is actually available on Amazon when it comes to 70`s sexploitation. And while we`re on the subject, the first 'Fantasm' also sucked - find your filth elsewhere, 'Fantasm' is a fantasy frustratingly unfullfilled.",1268524800,4,787,4.7101449275362315
8038728,5,B000654ZHI,"If you like films from the 70's, as much as I do. You'll probably like this film...It has it all, attractive women, nudity and sex(Some of which I am more than sure, isn't simulated)...Just watch the scene in the pool. The story is rather weak, if you can even locate it and the acting is god awful...But if your in the mood for a slice of 70's sleaze-orama...It doesn't get much better than this. For another great guilty pleasure from the seventies...also try, ""In The Realm Of The Senses"". It's a very graphic & real film from Japan.",1154217600,14,536,4.479591836734694
