6184859,5,B00HNFSD5Y,I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival where it won a major award. I loved it. I laughed a lot. My eyes even teared up a couple of time when the film dealt with Yiddish and Yiddish humor. This is a must have film,1391472000,6,218,3.760869565217391

6184861,2,B00HNFSD5Y,"Great content and potential but ruined by the dumbest director in the history of documentaries.  Self-indulgent beyond comprehension.  This doc seemed less about the roots of Jewish comedy and more about the interviewer's awful communication skills.  If you slow down for car wrecks, you'll love this one.  Watch Gilbert Gottfried's scrunched face scrunch even more at the inane questions.  Watch 150-year old Shelley Berman appear to want to rise from his couch to throttle the idiot.

6184865,2,B00HNFSD5Y,"I would have preferred if this attempt at a documentary were funnier because as a documentary, it failed.  The interviewer didn't seem to have a purpose so the questions had no focus.  He seemed to be figuring out what he was trying to accomplish as he went along.  He really should have started with a hypothesis and then explored the hypothesis through his interviews.  For example:  ""Jews are funnier than non-Jews.  Evidence: Jews make up less than 1% of the US population, but represent a significant percentage (20%  ???) of the comedians in the country.  Why?""",1484092800,,567,4.833333333333333

6184872,3,B00HNFSD5Y,"The interviewer - muddled, not overly sharp - is ostensibly in search of evidence for his hypothesis that ""things ain't what they used to be"" when it comes to Jews and humor. Trying to impose this construct onto his interviews makes for really weird questions.

6184884,4,B00HNFSD5Y,Mostly a documentary with a little comedy throw in while each performaner is talking. Enjoyable look at comedy history,1474243200,,118,5.2631578947368425
6184885,1,B00HNFSD5Y,Very dissatisfied with the film. Had very few clips. The people being interviewed were confused and were not previously told what the film was about. Could not even finish it.,1474070400,,175,4.866666666666666

6184889,4,B00HNFSD5Y,"As a big fan of comedy, and a Jew by heritage, it's probably safe to say that I'm the ideal demographic for this film, and I enjoyed it. I especially got a kick out of the belly laughs I had listening to some of the talented comics in the film. I also found some of the dialogue insightful. Getting to hear people articulate questions and thoughts about identity that I had not been able to do for myself left me with a little more clarity about my own family and way of looking at the world. My heart was also warmed spending time with some old timers.  But the film leaves at least one assumption unquestioned - or not questioned enough - that did not sit well with me. (After watching the film, I can't help but giggle at how Jewy I'm now feeling for not being able to leave this otherwise nice comment well enough alone without a critique. Perhaps ironically, I'm also being reminded of my gentile German husband's tendency, but that raises a query for another day). This assumption is that Jews are THE funny ones. Gentiles - not funny. So says at least one interviewer. To that I say what about Robin Williams? Monty Python? Dick Cavett? Johnny Carson? David Letterman? Cloris Leachman? Stephen Colbert? George Carlin? Eddy Izzard? These are just a few of the pretty darn funny gentiles who've made me and millions of others laugh for decades. And what about hilarious titans of comedy from other ethnicities? Like Richard Pryor? Chris Rock? Wanda Sykes? Freddie Prinz? Margaret Cho? David Sedaris? I am all for celebrating and pointing out the enormous contribution that Jews have and continue to make (Amy Schumer, Seinfeld, David, etc.) to comedy. And I think it is fair game - because it's true - to generalize as the film does, that Jews tend to have a large share of the funny market and for good reason. Its also totally valid to focus on mourning the loss of a culture that is dying off, as the film does, largely from genocide and the rest by time - the ""Yiddishkeit"" from which Ashkenazis come and which colored Jewish humor and influenced New York and American culture. And perhaps it's human to huddle together, as family does to cope with aging, loss and tragedy, and self reflect, as this film poignantly does as well. But in reflecting on the fabulousness and foibles of Jewish funniness, I'd like to see more room made for Jews' connection to all of humanity, which includes some very, equally funny folks who happen to not be Jewish. While Jewish suffering has been massive, we are not the only people who have experienced a combination of oppression, inhumanity, frustration, which led to humor being born out of necessity of invention.",1473120000,,2660,4.647558386411889
6184890,2,B00HNFSD5Y,Tedious and uninspired,1472342400,,22,6.666666666666667
6184891,3,B00HNFSD5Y,OK at best.  Maybe a little too ethnic for me but still funny in spots.  I miss the old timer comics from the 50's and 60's from old TV shows.,1472083200,,142,3.7
6184892,4,B00HNFSD5Y,"I very much enjoyed this movie.  It does bounce around and loose sight of what it's trying to accomplish, but that is part of its charm.

6184893,2,B00HNFSD5Y,"This had a lot of potential, but it felt like the interviewer was making it up as he went along.  It felt uncomfortable the whole way through, and I kept thinking I should turn it off. I stuck it out, and I wish I hadn't.",1470960000,,221,3.911111111111111

6184918,3,B00HNFSD5Y,"This is almost a really good movie.  It would have been better with a different interviewer and a clearer direction overall.  As it stands, the story bounces around a bit as it tries to flesh out a bigger idea that they never quite get to.  What makes it interesting is just the array of comedians who they speak to throughout the movie and just a reminder of how influential Jewish comedians were in the 20th century.  I have such a level of respect for anyone who can make their way in stand up that even some less-than-stellar interviews are still interesting as are some reminders of some of the 1950s-era comedians who helped define comedy on TV.  So I didn't turn it off but was always waiting for it to hit its stride.

The challenge is the film just wanders about.  And the interview with Super Dave seemed to be in there mainly to fill time.  He comes across as a cantankerous old guy -almost the stereotype of the temperamental artist/comedian who is great on stage but an unhappy, bitter person off-stage. The questions about the role of the religion or culture is almost interesting but also goes nowhere.  The question of whether the days of Jewish comedy are over similarly stalls.  That is the nature of the movie.  A good idea that never comes together.",1463961600,3,1269,4.570796460176991

6184922,5,B00HNFSD5Y,"This film should have been made years ago when some of the funniest comics were still among us... but its good to see that at least it was made before we lose more of the brilliant and hysterically funny comics have left, reducing the sunlight on our world through the loss of good, truly funny humor.  What passes for humor these days is so often not funny... maybe that's one reason our world is becoming so divided, threatening and serious.  We need the comics of old who saw through the BS and commented honestly and with humor, brightening our dismal world and making us laugh.  One doesn't have to be a Jew to enjoy and treasure good humor.  Maybe it helps, but I don't think so.  God Bless those who make us laugh.",1461715200,2,721,4.390977443609023

6184936,5,B00HNFSD5Y,"This movie apparently started off with the intention of being something different than what it turns out to be.

The title reflects what was intended . . . rather than what resulted -- so that may be confusing or misleading to some viewers. But it doesn't detract from the value of what it's actually in the movie, if you're willing and able to evaluate it on its own merits.

I don't think anyone would disagree that everyone in the movie is Jewish . . . and in some way characteristically so.

And for some reason (that is actually interesting to ponder) . . . the director is able to elicit the varieties of that Jewishness in a unusually candid and explicit way.

Some of  the Jewishness is good . . . and some of it is not so good. It's rare to see both juxtaposed so clearly.

And since Jewishness is undoubtedly an important thread in Western Civilization . . . you can understand some useful things from the contrast.",1453939200,,925,4.411764705882353

I loved the answers provided by  old Jewish comedians that I used to watch on the Ed Sullivan show in the 1960s.  To a man, they all expressed the mindset of their generation; those who experienced overt and ugly anti-Semitism by denying that their comedy was Jewish in its affectation, even though, it sure seemed like it was. . And I really enjoyed listening to the musings of younger comedians on their Jewishness and how the work of the previous generation paved the way for them.  What I didn't like so much were  the off camera musings by the director on his own situation, a conundrum  that he created and seems unwilling to change  to make his own life more meaningful.  So it was really sweet and funny, but the director's own musings  kind of messed up the joy of it.  Overall, a good movie and worth watching.",1446681600,2,944,4.5266272189349115

6184979,2,B00HNFSD5Y,"Jews are funny. Old Jews are hilarious. Let me tell you these really old Jewish jokes. And by the way the old world Jews were much funnier because Holocaust. Alan Zweig has assembled a mostly male cast of comedians to talk about Jewish comedians, Catskills and not much else. The comedians give their stories and mostly talk about all the cliches in Judaism including ""old Jews"" and the like.

So pretty much if you're Jewish, you've heard all these jokes before. If you're Swedish and have never met a Jew in your life you probably heard at least half of them.

What really stinks up this movie is the insistence of Alan Zweig to insert himself into every interview. We learn way more about Alan Zweig and his daughter and his obsessions with his goyish wife than we really learn about these guys. When one of the comedians mentions that his son died the answer is to a dumb question about what he is going to do about raising Jewish kids. It's also the last moment in the movie. Then the guy sings a song and Alan Zweig decides taht it should be the theme song of the movie. Way to put yourself in the interview, Alan Zweig, good for you.

I like the fact that Bob Einstein seems to really hate Alan Zweig. I actually find Einstein much more endearing for his unwillingness to be patient for this terrible interviewer.

The rest of this movie is pretty standard. If you want to know about Jewish humor, there are thousands of movies with Jewish comedians, and many of them are telling jokes that were written after the Holocaust. And if you want a documentary, try either Seinfeld's Comedian or the one on Joan Rivers. At very least they won't have the cheesy klezmer.",1402617600,6,1670,4.5016501650165015

It's a real simple film. Besides for a few old stand up clips, there is no b-roll just interviews. The doc is about why Jews are so funny and that they are funny in a different way then older style comedians, but that's enough.

There is a lot of laughs because we are hearing funny stories from some of the funniest people in the world. The only problem was that we laughed too loud. This will not be problem for home watchers, but in a crowded room full of Jews the laughter was so loud that we miss the rest of an interview or the second joke after a punchline.

Some film should be so lucky right?

Don't listen to the reviews I've read here and elsewhere that say this is some kind of failed attempt at making a film about Jewish humor.  It's not trying to be a film about Jewish humor or a history of Jewish humor.  It uses humor as a window to look at the culture.  What it felt like for a lot of us to be brought up in a Jewish home.  And the comedians in it, whether they're old timers like Jack Carter or young ones like the one called Modi, aren't in the film to be some kind of expert passing on wisdom, they're just there to be part of the conversation and bring up different aspects of Jewish culture or humor.  That's why it doesn't matter if they agree with the director or not.  He's not arguing with them, he's having a conversation.  If you like documentaries where a series of facts are presented, maybe this isn't the one for you.  But if you can sit back and enjoy the conversation without trying to guess where it's going, this is one of the sweetest experiences I've ever had a film viewer.

6184988,3,B00HNFSD5Y,"As I post this review, I see three other reviews before me. Two saw the film in Toronto and loved it while the third (a reviewer in the midwest US) commented on the discussion of religion in the film. I have a totally different take on this DVD after watching the main 86 minute film and the Extras on the DVD.

Ive seen a number of documentaries on Jewish comedians over the years including Old Jews Telling Jokes, another recent one on the Catskills humor, and  of course the DVD release of the Alan King TV series Inside the Comedy Mind which featured interviews with a host of Jewish comedians.  I expected something on this order when I started watching this DVD. Within the first 10 minutes I knew this wasn't going to be like that.

The Writer/Director of this film Alan Zweig  (a Canadian from Ontario; the film was funded by the Canada Film Board) goes to visit and interview four legendary American comedians, now all in their 90s! Shecky Greene, Norm Crosby, Shelly Berman and Jack Carter.  Anyone who remembers them from their heyday on TV including the Dean Martin Roasts will shed a tear when they see how they have aged. (I though artist Drew Friedman was being cruel when he drew caricatures of these guys in his volumes called Old Jewish Comedians, but , sadly these guys look just like those drawings. Zweig (who we learn later  for no relevant reason  is 61 years old and has a 2-year old child. And  at least for me  was annoying and egotistical as he tried to probe answers from the four men I just mentioned. He wants them to say they are Jewish comedians and they wont.  They are comedians who are Jewish. Shelly Berman is a Jew but there is no Jew in his comedy albums. Zweig keeps the camera rolling and we see and hear Berman (and others to, but mostly Berman) telling him that he won't tell him what he wants to hear. Its not true, Berman says but Zweig doesnt care.

He then interviews a few of the next generation of TV comedians: David Brenner (from Philly) and David Steinberg (who started in Canada and was at one time  like Jackie Mason (who is NOT here)  a rabbi).
Then we get to the younger comedians who all appear to be Canadian and not one was familiar to me.
The film could have use better editing. There are a few funny jokes (mostly by the legends). Zweig would have made a better  and more useful film if he called it the Wisdom of the Elders and let the older comedians tell more stories.

The DVD has five Extras. The first is called Shecky Mania in which Greene does 4  minutes of shtick.  Next is Shecky Calls Jack which is nothing more than 1  minute conversation that Jack Carter has when Shecky calls during Zweigs interviewing. Jewish Joke Medley is a 7-minute compilation of jokes; some funny, most not. Name That Tune is a one-minute really-dumb joke. And the final extra  Kenina Hurra (keep the evil eye away in Yiddish) has Zweig urging one of the guests to tell a story in Yiddish.

This could have been a fun and funny film (and a chance to learn from the comedians) by Zweig lets his ego  - and his voice!  get in the way and I can only give the project and the DVD 3 stars (primarily for the few funny jokes that get through.) .

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
