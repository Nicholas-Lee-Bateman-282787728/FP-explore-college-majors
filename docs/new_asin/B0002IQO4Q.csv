2099473,4,B0002IQO4Q,"This workout does incorporate some cardio segments, which are not too complicated choreography wise, but the main focus is the upper and lower body workout. The compound movements (e.g., dips from the step with biceps, leg presses with delts) are challenging without making you anaerobic.  The length (50 minutes) is good for a mid-week workout.  Is it the most challenging weight workout?  No, for those, get the Jari Love DVDs.  But is it a good weight workout for the intermediate to advanced exerciser? Yes, if you're happy not being sore the next day.  Stephanie is a good cuer and leader; her voice is well modulated, and not too peppy.  You will need an incline box (I would recommend the transfirmer over the incline box), and 5-12 pound dumbbells. Why not 5 stars? The ab work.  As in the other Firm workouts that do the ab work on the incline, unless you have a death grip on the step, you will slide down.  This makes them very awkward to do, even with a mat on the incline.",1170374400,8,985,4.556818181818182
2099474,5,B0002IQO4Q,"This workout is part of The Firm BSS3 series, which introduces the ""Firm Box"", a 3 in 1 box which you can use at 6 inches for step aerobics, 14 inches for leg presses and seated exercises and in an incline position for some step routines and lunges. The box's legs are adjustable to any of the previously mentioned heights.

This workout is about 45 minutes long and is jam packed with strength exercises and cardio routines mixed in. There are a lot of compound movements in this video, like leg presses with bicep curls, lunges on the incline with shoulder presses, hover squats with deltoid raises etc. For these sorts of moves, lighter weights are likely best unless you can handle a heavier weight. Of course there are strictly strength exercises as well, squats, leg presses, bicep curls, shoulder presses, tricep dips, chest work and there are some abs at the end. Some abwork is done using the Firm Box, of course if you don't have the box or don't like doing abwork on the box you can do them on the floor.

There is a good variety of cardio routines in this workout, there is one that you use the step at the 6 inch height, one that is at the inclined height, and one cardio session that you don't use the box at all.

For this workout you will need assorted dumbells, and while the Firm Box is preferred, this workout can be modified if you do not have it. If you have the Firm's fanny lifter that can be used in place of it, or a step and a stool. Or if you don't care for the incline, you can use the box at the 6 inch position and still get a good workout.

Stephanie Huckabee leads this workout with 4 of her fellow Firm Master Instructors, she does a great job. Libby shows the beginner modifications in the video. All in all a great workout, gets the job done in 45 minutes.",1145318400,15,1791,4.3056379821958455
2099475,5,B0002IQO4Q,"Stephanie is definitely my favorite FIRM instructor.  I love her personality and energy she brings to each workout.  Total Muscle Shaping really emphasizes the upper body, although there is lower body work as well.  I don't own the FIRM box, but I do have the TransFIRMer.  It was easy to adapt the workout using the TransFIRMer.  My upper body was screaming at me when I was finished.  I love working out with the FIRM.  The workouts are challenging, but fun.  I definitely am seeing results that I want by using the rotation calendars.",1140566400,6,537,4.698924731182796
2099476,5,B0002IQO4Q,"This is one of my favorite Firm videos. It packs a total body wallop in 45 minutes, especially with the four limbed box climbing segment. It also seems to have more intense upper body work than any other Firm total body workout I know of (at least from GoodTimes anyway). Of course I use heavier weights than the 3s, 5s and 8s they're using. I finally caught on to the cardio step segment after several tries. This video has enough variety to stave off boredom and Stephanie is one of the Firm's best instructors. I don't recommend using their blue box though because of some safety issues.",1135814400,7,590,4.5233644859813085
2099477,5,B0002IQO4Q,This video is a 50 Minute total body shaping.. I recommend that this video be added to your collection but it isn't for those just starting out..work your way up to it. Stepahine Huckabee is one of the better instructors she gives great cues and is upbeat in her delivery. you will need the firm incline box and dumbbells.,1115510400,8,322,4.47457627118644
2099478,4,B0002IQO4Q,"I only gave this 4 stars because i found one segment of low impact aerobics on the step to be a bit complicated.  And ive taken dance for 12 years!!!  i find that in all the newer firm tapes though.  most is basic stepping, but sometimes they throw stuff in out of nowhere and don't do enough reps to let u catch up.  I wind up doin my own step routine till its done.

That being said, it is a great workout otherwise.  Most of the cardio is low impact, but i like how they do some jumping jacks and plyo jumps.  There is a lot of leg work which is great, but no inner thigh emphasis.  I supplement with 2 other firm workouts, lower body*(lying down) and standing floow work(OUCH)

Arm work is also pretty good. And I like using the incline on the abs.

I was very impressed and reccomend this tape to use in part with the complete body sculpting and fast blasting cardio.",1105056000,11,872,4.167664670658683
2099479,5,B0002IQO4Q,"Another great workout by the Firm! Stephanie Huckabee leads you through a 45 minute cardio and sculpting routine. The step and low-impact aerobics segments are fun but not complicated. The upper body work is some of the toughest I have done, which is a good thing!

You will need three sets of dumbbells (3,5, and 8 pounds to start) and the new firm box, or another step that can be set at 6"", 14"" and on an incline.

Highly, highly recommended!",1100822400,11,445,4.481481481481482
2099480,5,B0002IQO4Q,"i really like the incline box, i don't have the new Firm one but  i have a standard step with risers that i could take one side off and it inclined it really improved the effectiveness my lunges and chestwork. I like Stephanie as an intructor and recommend her, this dvd had enjoyable aerobics segments and tough muscle shaping. this is another firm workout i will enjoy adding to my dvd rotation schedule.",1099180800,5,406,4.561643835616438
2099481,3,B0002IQO4Q,"The workout itself is quite good.  Quite challenging if you use heavy weights, and a well-rounded total body workout in 50 mins.  I used the Transfirmer instead of the 'death box' which worked perfectly and is much more stable and easy to use. Stephanie is friendly, personable, w/ good form and she generally cues well.

HOWEVER, I had some gripes.

I HATED the music!! It's way too loud and totally obnoxious. Some songs as well as being obnoxious and loud, were repetitive (the same few notes over and over and over) until I was ready to scream.  The terrible music almost drowns out Stephanie's cuing much of the time, too. Unfortunately I do not have a DVD player which will selectively mute the music and keep the cuing.

Stephanie repeats, ""You can do it!"" andn ""stay w/ me"" about 100 times and it's really, really annoying after about the fifth time.

Pam and Christa are way too skinny.

Do I really have to look at Lisa's big fake no-bra boobs the entire time?? GROSS.  What is up with that??  In your face cleavage is bad enough (and way too common w/ Firm workouts) but no bra? WTH.

Anyway. lol.
I may force myself to do this one a few more times and see if I can overlook those major and minor annoyances.  If not, I've got plenty of other good workouts to do.  I suggest try before you buy (or buy very cheap).",1332720000,2,1325,4.403292181069959
2099482,3,B0002IQO4Q,"I am not at a level that I can perform this video, but keeping it for use in near future.  I have the box and want to give it full use.",1318032000,,135,3.3548387096774195
2099483,2,B0002IQO4Q,"I felt the equipment was not up to par. In addition, you could hurt yourself on it. The exercise tapes themselves were on the level of a beginner-i don't think a beginner would break a sweat.",1298332800,,191,4.333333333333333
2099484,5,B0002IQO4Q,"I love, love, love this DVD and Stephanie Hucklebee is awesome too. I get the best workout when I use this particular DVD. I like many of the Firm workouts however the ones with Stephanie are usually my favorite.  She has broke out on her own and now has a DVD series called ""Power Fit""  you can find it right her at Amazon.  The Power Fit Harmony is in my opinion a female version of P90X however, shorter but does use the muscle confusion process of developing your new body. I would certainly suggest this DVD and any others with Stephanie Hucklebee.  Her cuing is perfect and she actually helps you enjoy the workout. I hope this helps in your decision to buy this DVD and other workouts with Stephanie Hucklebee.",1290816000,,717,4.450381679389313
2099485,4,B0002IQO4Q,"""We're building lean muscle mass which allows us to burn more calories twenty four hours a day"" Stephanie Huckabee enthusiastically proclaims about half way through this workout. Indeed, as a role model with two of the most beautiful arms I have ever seen, she cannot be beat.

Developing strong, beautiful legs is also something very much promoted on this tape through leg presses, hover squats and dips for strength and skating and jumping jacks in the aerobic portion of this interval training tape. I think it was especially considerate of them to promote an alternative to straight jumping jacks as some individuals with larger breasts find that the ""bounce factor"" can be a real problem with this exercise. Like a previous reviewer some of the aerobic moves can be confusing to catch on to particularly for me I had a problem with the ""turn steps.""

I also agree with the previous reviewer ""Lovetoworkout"" who once wrote:  ""As in other Firm workouts that do the ab work on the incline unless you have a death grip on the step, you will slide down. This makes them very akward to do even with a mat on the incline.""

All in all, however, this is an excellent if not outstanding workout tape particularly for the arms and legs.",1280188800,,1231,4.711627906976744
2099486,4,B0002IQO4Q,"As other reviews have stated this is from the BSS3 Series and is a combination of cardio intervals and strength. There is a nice warm up, approx 4-5 minutes and goes by quickly. I think this is a plus as the Firm Pink warm ups are too blah for me. After you are warmed up there are intervals of cardio then strength. You have 3 of each. 2 of the cardio intervals are step aerobics with one being floor work. I used my Firm TransFirmer for this DVD and it worked fine. The DVD gave me enough transition time as long as I move quickly bc the BSS3 Box takes several seconds to adjust. Compared to the Fanny Lifter (BSS1 & 2) Legs were not hit as hard in this DVD. Being the day after my first useage of this DVD, my triceps have a nice fire in them still. The chest work at the end of the workout really does get into the triceps which is why I am feeling them today. This is the first time not feeling anything in my lower body the day after regardless of what series (including Pink) used. It's a good total body workout that gets you in and out with cardio and strength + Abs in 47 minutes. It is recommended to have a mat to use on your box for the chest and ab work. The same mat will be used for the stretch which is one of the nicest ones I have done with the Firm. The only true drawback of this workout is that the audio is bad. The music is much louder than Stephanie's voice so you really will need to do this DVD a few times before you can stop concentrating on her cues. Otherwise, a good investment and a workout that I will be doing again in the future! It really is a keeper, but use the BSS2 or BSS4 DVDs for a harder overall workout including legs. Stephanie looks great in this DVD, very toned and strong...IMO a better testimony to the Older Firms compared to her new series PowerFit and Harmony where she clearly doesn't have the same strength and physique. Her body in this DVD would motivate anyone to exercise, use heavier weights, and eat healthfully!!",1271894400,2,1974,4.1566579634464755
2099487,4,B0002IQO4Q,"Stephanie Huckabee is an excellent lead here. This workout is great,there is a good combination of compound lifts and traditional weight lifting exercises combined with cardio. The music is pretty good, it's techno and upbeat. I also like the modifications offered for greater intensity, they can really bump up your heart rate. This video, along with complete body sculpting with Christa Riley, are my favorites of the newer firm workouts. I have seen exceptional results with the two.",1239753600,,486,5.243589743589744
2099488,4,B0002IQO4Q,"I just got this tape on Amazon.  I really like it.  It has some fancy box steps that are a little hard to keep up with, but the strength and muscle toning segments are great!  I don't have the incline bench so I have to improvise and use my regular step-up bench.  This is a fun workout and  is over before you know it, so there is no getting bored with it!",1210723200,,357,3.9027777777777777
2099489,4,B0002IQO4Q,"Firm believer for 14 years, had this on VHS wanted it on DVD.  Fun workout combining low impact cardio with muscle-shaping moves.  You need the box pictured to do it right.",1204070400,,172,4.516129032258065
2099490,5,B0002IQO4Q,"This workout is really effective. The instructor, Stephanie, is great giving cues and she is really easy to follow.

8028165,5,B0002IQO4Q,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,,1486,4.427007299270073

8028167,4,B0002IQO4Q,"While I can't say it's my favorite ""The Firm"" workout, I do enjoy it.  It provides a good solid workout, especially for your triceps and biceps, and leaves you with a nice sweat.  I find the rep count to not be as high as with other workouts, perhaps that is because the weights Stephanie uses are heavier than in other videos.
Total workout time is 48 minutes; it includes an excellent warm-up, a brief ab section, and a so-so cool-down.  In between you just keep right on plugging along, working your upper and lower body, sometimes simultaneously, and other times in alternation.
Equipment needed; 3 sets of weights, a mat, and an incline step.",1424476800,,647,4.657894736842105

8028169,5,B0002IQO4Q,"I've been doing step aerobics for 20 + years and really enjoy The Firm Step series.  The workouts, this one included, are not difficult to follow and can be enjoyed by someone who is new to step or an advanced stepper.  I especially like Total Muscle Shaping because it incorporates weight lifting along with stepping so you're getting a 2-in-1 workout.",1391040000,,353,4.770491803278689
8028170,4,B0002IQO4Q,"This workout came out with the Firm Box, which I did not buy.  I only recently purchased this workout and I use my TransFIRMer to do it because it has the incline option and is much sturdier than the Firm Box used in the video.  I really like Stephanie as an instructor.  She cues well and is easy to follow.  I like this workout and add it into my rotation fairly often.  I do agree with a previous reviewer - it is somewhat disturbing to see how skinny Christa and Pam are in this video ~ Christa most of all.  Not only is it hard to look at, but it doesn't send a good message to have someone so skinny promoting a workout. She/they didn't get to looking like that by just doing the Firm workouts.  They should promote healthy looking bodies.  I think Stephanie, Lisa, and Libby look healthy.  (Note: when Pam shows up in the next Firm video series, she does look much healthier and is not so skinny.  I haven't seen Christa since this series.)  I work out often and I break a sweat doing this workout.  I give it my all and I use the heaviest dumbbells I can handle for each exercise that uses them, so I really get a good workout in.  If you get this one and you're looking for an incline box to do it with, I would recommend looking for a TransFIRMer and NOT the Firm Box used in this video.",1372636800,4,1297,4.14
