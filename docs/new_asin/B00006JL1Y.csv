Just a fantastic little documentary. Such a shame it had to be done on a ""Pilgrim's Budget"".

Can only thoroughly recommend this to anyone that has read the book.",1304380800,2,214,4.325
7970314,5,B00006JL1Y,"This is the third copy of True Fans I've purchased, this one for a friend considering a life-changing cross country bike trip.  The first time I saw the film was at the Banff Mountain Film Festival.  It generated spontaneous applause from the audience in at least two parts of the movie and a standing ovation at the end.  One of my favorite, non-mainstream films.",1259798400,,364,4.65625
7970315,5,B00006JL1Y,"Dan Austin's ""True Fans"" is not your usual documentary. It starts off with an exhilarating burst of energy, fast editing and nimble storytelling, and never lets up. It's the story of three guys riding cross country on their bicycles on $10/day with a unblemished NBA basketball, which is signed by everyone who helps them on their summer-long journey. They're riding to the Basketball Hall of Fame in Massachusetts where they hope, at the end of their journey, that their ball will be enshrined as a symbol of America, for the unusual journey it has made.

It's a journey that is fueled by pure love of basketball, America and the road itself -- and the movie sails along on that same energy. It's a completely original experience, and is a fresh breath of air in the cynical times we live in. The film's sincere joy of the pilgrimage is infectious, and ultimately quite moving. It'll remind you how much you can accomplish with a little determination, courage and belief in something.

Editing is the key to the success of any documentary, and this film is so energetically cut, it will knock you over. But it also knows when to slow down and enjoy the peace and spirituality of the road. The fantastic music also fuels the film, giving it a driving heartbeat, as well a placid calm in all the right places. Mr. Austin is an original, full of infectious energy. Highly recommended.

Dan has also written a book about this journey, also called 'True Fans"", which - as much as I loved this film - I found the book to be even more rich and textured than the film, because it delves deeper into the emotions and events he was unable to capture on camera.  So, I highly recommend checking out the book as well.

There's nothing else out there quite like it.",1125964800,5,1753,4.587859424920127
7970316,5,B00006JL1Y,"True Fans is proof positive that heroes really do exist and they're often disguised as ordinary people.  It helps to have a lot of faith in humanity, as Dan Austin, his brother Jared and his best friend Clint do as they ride their bikes from California to Massachusetts to the Basketball Hall of Fame.  Along for the ride is an official NBA Basketball, on which the guys gather the autographs of the ordinary heroes who help them on their pilgrimage-and when you only have $10 a day to spend, you're putting a lot of faith in the kindness of others.  Oh, and by the way, the film's a lot of fun too. Not only did I laugh out loud, but I was mostly inspired by Dan's positive attitude and his ""Just Do It"" mentality. Buy True Fans and see where the Hero's Ball ends up!  This film won the Banff Mountain Film Festival's People's Choice Award and was a favorite at other festivals around the world.",1034121600,9,896,4.379518072289157
