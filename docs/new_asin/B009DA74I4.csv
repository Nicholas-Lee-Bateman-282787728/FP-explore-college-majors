5319439,5,B009DA74I4,"As with any animal life documentary I was very excited to see it. What can I do - I love them all and lucky enough to have yet find the one that would disappoint me. However, with some in-first-sight not so intriguing programs I use the ""Fast-Forward"" technique to get to the good stuff. I do want to learn more about the animals, but sometimes these programs are not all that dynamic.

Although orangutans are not at the top of my ""Favorite Animals"" list, they are very interesting species to learn about. So, I got some tea, dry fruits, and climbed on the couch expecting to have some amount of Fast-Forward action. Let me tell you this - shortly I was glued to the TV like a kid to candy jar. I saw things that are normally not discussed in lectures about apes. By the middle of the movie I was ready to board a plane and go volunteer at orangutans sanctuary. I saw very intelligent animals with great level of interaction. I saw an orangutan school where little apes are taught things to help them to get back and survive in the wild when the time comes. I saw an understaffed organization trying to make a difference in animals' lives and keep them for future generations. Sadly, I also saw apes being badly abused by people and local businesses.

I understand that everything changes and where yesterday was a forest today it might be a plantation of some sort. I understand that local people rely on their activities to support their livelihood. I do. I also understand that if nothing is done in some foreseeable future we may lose not just orangutans but a lot of other things with them.
Here is one thing I learned: If you ever wanted to have an exotic animal as a pet, DON'T! Some of the animals like orangutans are just not pet material.",1349913600,19,1749,4.445482866043614

We laugh because they are so much like humans.  Everyone knows about our DNA. I'm very happy to be so informed.",1503446400,,247,4.674418604651163

which needs our financial and moral support. Thinking long term is always difficult unless it is carried by a vision of
hope. Love for animals extends beyond words even beyond understanding.",1410220800,3,429,4.733333333333333
