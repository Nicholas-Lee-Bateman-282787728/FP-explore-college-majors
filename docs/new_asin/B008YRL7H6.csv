5191936,5,B008YRL7H6,"i'm excited for this since i have been waiting 5 years for this, at first i thought this was blu-ray only but thanks to customer service they confirmed it was both containg blu-ray and  regular DVD so i'll will be buying this for Christmas!",1350172800,,240,4.454545454545454
5191937,5,B008YRL7H6,"Finally after all these years Hellsing is back on the U.S. market! For those who are coming new to the series, the U.S. branch of Genon went under a few years ago, and they stopped dubbing all of their projects. This pissed a lot of fans off because Hellsing is one of those really memorable dubs where the voice actors really it their parts, especially Crispin Freeman as Alucard, in fact I would go so far as to say Hellsing is the best English dub out there. Anyway Hellsing is back now with most of the original voice actors, now being dubbed by Funimation. This set comes out to about 11$ per movie, and you get the Blu-Ray and the DVD versions in one, great value. The Blu-Ray's are great quality, and the sound quality is crystal clear, it's been a long wait, but it was worth it!

Also it comes with a little cardboard insert so that if you decide to buy the I-IV set, it will slide right into the same box that this set comes with, very nice touch.",1346716800,42,957,4.258241758241758
5191938,5,B008YRL7H6,"I have been waiting for this for 3 years!! Hellsing Ultimate is by far my favorite anime series ever. The action, story, and characters are just amazing! The subs are good, but this is the best cast of voice actors I have seen overall. Crispin Freeman as Alucard just can not be beat if you ask me. His voice is freaking perfect for him. The others are also amazing. These episodes are when the action just gets beyond intense. A triangle of combat between Hellsing, Millenium, and the Iscariot is just incredible. If you like vampires or action anime check the other episodes out right now! You will be happy you did it. Trust me.",1346716800,48,631,4.495652173913044

In all seriousness, if you're looking for a great bloodbath in anime and can't get enough, this is the series/OVA for you. Volumes 1-4 help set the scene perfectly and Volumes 5-8 launch you right into the action. Volumes 9 & 10 are up there, mostly for the final confrontation and conclusion, but still worth every penny.

If you're unsure of whether or not you'll enjoy this, watch Hellsing Ultimate Abridged by TeamFourStar on YouTube. They did an amazing job of making the episodes funny without removing what the show offers. Don't get hung up if you think the language is too much, but do keep in mind that it is Rated TV-MA for a reason.",1488844800,,700,4.825

However, one of the Blu-ray disc's had a crack on the outside that prevented me from finishing episode VII on the Blu-ray (thus the 4 stars). This is the first time I have had an error from a product purchased on Amazon. Otherwise, I enjoyed the DVD very much. I would definitely suggest this to someone.",1422403200,,411,4.35064935064935

5191992,4,B008YRL7H6,It's a good anime. I noticed some of the rendering wasn't done very good. Not sure if just a bad copy or what. But they talk way too much. Mostly the Major character. I really like the back story for Alucard as well.,1421539200,,216,4.046511627906977

5192002,5,B008YRL7H6,"I have both Hellsing and this as well, This is a series I truly love Hellsing Ultimate is far darker gorier and bloody then Hellsing but boy is it one hell of a watch, Alucard has been kept in character no major changes like some series do to their main character and sometimes it is more of a detriment then a benefit. This was beautifully done and contains some adult content

You will see another side of Walter you'd never expect it is a shocker I did not see that coming and quite enjoyed it as well. Integra has to deal with even creepier creatures then she did in the original series, betrayal, abandonment. This series has more twists and turns then a curvy road, killer plot twists only add to it",1416355200,2,705,4.340909090909091

5192004,5,B008YRL7H6,"One of the most epic, bloody, s*** storm shows i've ever seen. I really dislike the hole general vampire/zombie genre so i was extremely hesitant to watch this show knowing its about exactly that vampires&gooles(zombies) but once i watch 10minutes of this show i knew i made a terrible mistake by putting off this show for so long! If you like profound language, excessive over the top violence, blood and guts, guns and epic crazy fights, you will absolutely LOVE this show. Hell i think you could hate vampires & zombies with a passion and still absolutely love this show. If you were a fan of ""Black Lagoon"", ""Darker than Black"", ""Mirai Nikki(Future Diary)"", ""Deadman Wonderland"" or ""Jormungand"" i can assure you'll LOVE this anime, worth every penny.

And for the record you do not have to have seen the original series ""Hellsing"" as they're different story lines, apparently the original version didn't follow the manga through to the end and ""Hellsing UItimate"" does just that. I have never seen ""Hellsing"" and had absolutely no trouble following or understanding the story.",1416009600,,1080,4.966850828729282

5192023,5,B008YRL7H6,"Almost a month ago, I posted a review on Hellsing Ultimate: Volumes 1-4 on DVD/Blu-ray. If you haven't seen it, click on the link below:

http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CZF5MYS6FNB4/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm

Hellsing Ultimate: Volumes 5-8 is the epic and brutal battle between three factions; The Millennium Organization, an army of Nazi vampires led by a psychotic major driven to see London burn, the Iscariot Organization, the Vatican's selected army of catholic vampire slayers under the rule of a power-mad archbishop yearning to slaughter all sides, both guilty and innocent, and the Hellsing Organization, led By Integra Hellsing and commanding only a small band of mercenaries (after losing her army in the previous 4 episodes) charged to save London. But she still has two trump cards that may tip the scales of power; the vampires Seras Victoria and Alucard.

As with the previous set, episodes 5-8 are on DVD/Blu-ray with superb video and sound quality. It offers special features including English and Japanese dubbing (from the original English and Japanese Hellsing voice actors). The only down side is that it offers a brief episode called the Dawn, a prequel that shows a young Walter and Alucard fighting in WWII. It's in Japanese with English subtitles. I'm not certain if and when the full series will be coming out. Another downer is that there is a delay in the last two episodes. Not sure when they will be released but you are gonna be left hanging after episode 8.

When I said earlier that the battle for London is epic and brutal, that's not mere boasting from a fan. This is one of the most graphic battles I have ever seen in an anime. I won't drop any spoilers but I will give you a fair warning. The war on London, as well as the entire series, is extremely graphic and violent. If you're not too fond of gore, this won't be your cup of tea. If you are into this series or a fan of over-the-top violent animes, you're in for a treat.",1402099200,,1957,4.798219584569733
5192024,5,B008YRL7H6,"As the box cover states so eloquently, Alucard is a vampire that doesn't ****ing sparkle. A ""retelling"" of the Hellsing series, the anime starts off in a similar fashion, at least from a storytelling perspective. The similarities quickly evaporate as the three factions (Hellsing, the Catholic Church and the last remnants of the Third Reich) clash in explosive and nearly preposterous battles.

The character deaths, special powers and battles are a feast for the eyes (though the sheer quantity of blood could make some fans squeamish). There are more drops of blood than there are inbred children at a Tasmanian barbecue.

The English dub is excellent, featuring Laura Bailey (Sana-chan, Honda Tohru) as the viciously sinister yet undeniably cute catboy Schrodinger. Crispin Freeman plays the ""tame"" vampire working under the auspices of England. The accents are always right on the mark, and the series is never slow or plodding, despite having 50-minute episodes.

Now that the final two episodes are finally slated for release later this year, there is no excuse to miss out on this wonderful series. You won't regret it!",1401580800,,1127,5.181318681318682

5192036,3,B008YRL7H6,"This review is for the entirety of Hellsing Ultimate (all 10 episodes).
I had seen quite a few scenes from Hellsing Ultimate before I actually watched it, and I wasn't expecting much for story or emotion, but I was expecting a lot of action. There actually ended up being more story and emotion than I figured, and even though there's a couple scenes of characters displaying sorrow that seem drawn out and overacted, I still felt it added to the anime. But what I did not expect was the excessive amount of chibi.
The first half of Hellsing Ultimate isn't really all that great. The story plays out pretty standardly, no big plot twists, with the action amounting to nothing real special. But the big problem is that Hellsing Ultimate seemed to just keep trying to sabotage itself. It just absolutely REFUSED to allow you to feel something. Almost every time things were getting tense, whether it be from an emotional moment or a good action scene, it would kill the mood by either showcasing one of its MANY chibi moments, or someone would just keep rephrasing a line and repeat it over, and over, AND OVER. I don't know if they thought that was supposed to make what they were saying seem more important, but it didn't.
The second half of Hellsing Ultimate is where things get good. The story progresses nicely and turns out to not be as shallow as you were first lead to believe. The action gets ramped up, and we end up seeing a lot of good battles. And the biggest thing of all, Hellsing Ultimate actually allows there to be tension! The chibi moments get cut way back...although, there's still enough of it to annoy you.
As for the final episode, I can't just flat-out say that it's good or bad. It does the most important objective of a finale well by putting an end to a lot of things, and doesn't really leave any cliffhangers. However, it does not give sound answers to explain why things ended the way they did. Instead of giving solid explanations, EVERYONE just kept talking around the answers with philosophical gibberish. I eventually gave up on trying to piece together full-proof reasons and just decided to go along with it. The final episode will also give you one of the biggest WTF moments when an almost solely chibi-based character, with little story behind 'em, is ultimately responsible for the defeat of the biggest badass. Near the end of the final episode, you'll also be given the biggest chibi sequence out of the whole series.
So when it's all said and done, I give Hellsing Ultimate a 3/5. It's entertaining to watch, but nothing really sticks with you, and it amounts to little more than a cheap thrill.
P.S. - I couldn't really find a spot in my review to say this, so I'll say it here  Even though the music for moments throughout Hellsing Ultimate is usually suiting, there are some where the music used just didn't fit at all and makes you wonder what they were thinking when they used it.",1393891200,,2927,4.58587786259542

Having purchased volumes 1-4 as they came out several years ago, and thinking the rest would never see the light of day because of the distribution issues, I really looked forward to these. I was let down by the conclusion to this series. The last episodes have a feeling that the producers just wanted to ""get it done"" without any of the care and planning that went into the first 4 volumes. That said, I did like getting the ending of the series, but was somewhat disappointed.
If you want to see the conclusion to the series then I recommend it; just don't be expecting to see the same quality of story as the first 4 volumes.",1390348800,,708,4.330827067669173

5192058,1,B008YRL7H6,"I reviewed part one as well, and it earned three stars for being an improvement on the original, and for showcasing some damn fine fan service and ultra-violence. The show grew wings it didn't have before, and managed to take flight. Part two, however, ""ate the wings to make it tame."" It crashed to the earth and recaptured the same flat, uninspired, mega-powered closing that the original suffered.

Look to my review of part one for PROS and CONS, as they're pretty much the same.

The only difference is that part two features the dreaded DECAPITATION SYNDROME. This is where a series tries to be more than it is, and reaches for epic. In doing so, it cuts off its own head, forgets what it is, and runs all over the place like a chicken kicking down whatever structure sheltered it in the first place.

Hellsing became a lesson in what doesn't work.

***SPOILER WARNING***

- Alucard is the main character, and the one that people watch the show for. He's not in it. He's chilling on a boat until the end of the show. I understand anticipation. Hell, Dragon Ball Z was all about people popping veins and charging up for whole episodes. The only difference is that when they finished, there was a BIG payoff. Alucard shows up and covers the city in a cheap blanket of computer-generated zombies. It looks horribly fake, and while it is an attempt at epic, it just replaces what could have been true animated violence (which, let's face it, is the only lure of the show).

- Alucard squares off against his mouthy nemesis with dinner knives, so do I get my action and actual animation now? Nooooo. The nemesis is going to turn into a biblical vine king and touch Alucard once on the head to kill him. Epic? Nope, just lazy.

- Police Girl turns into a total badass! Yeah, but eclipsing that development is a more than played out romance with the eyepatch-Gambit Legionnaire. This same Legionnaire keeps winking encouragement at his mercs as they try to play the same tired ""band of brothers"" tune over and over while getting slaughtered. I kept thinking my DVD was skipping, but no.

- Butterball Hitler preaches his love of killing all things alive-and-British for about four episodes straight.

This just fell to pieces. The wonderful action and gore that made the show watchable was replaced with gimmicks and redundant themes. If you're a big fan of the series and think that there was a great story here to begin with, then this ending might work for you. But they dropped the ball pretty hard on this one. What a shame.

I really love anime when it works. I'm an animator and writer myself, so I'm always pouring through the stacks looking for gems. I'll be doing a lot more reviews. If you find that these are helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along. I'll try not to steer you into s***.",1378598400,4,2807,4.573705179282869
5192059,5,B008YRL7H6,"In the never ending onslaught of emotional melodrama anime, its very refreshing to see something that caters to the primal instinct.  The plot is rather old and cliche but those who want awesome titillating action will not be disappointed.  Alucard is the classical badass that every man loves to watch.",1378512000,,303,5.04
5192060,5,B008YRL7H6,"Well like most of the OVAs for this series its pretty great. If you love helsing and hated the fact the original series only had 13 episodes you are probobly going to buy this anyways. It is defiantly worth the money. Would recommend to any vampire or helsing fans. I will say though that the excessive music, and overly corny jokes in these are kind of annoying. Though if you are looking for a stupid twilight sparkly vampire romance this show is not for you. Anyone watching twilight this is not for you. Edward is not a real vampire and Jacob is a descrace to werewolves.",1378080000,,575,4.433962264150943

5192067,5,B008YRL7H6,"What can I add about the Hellsing Ultimate series itself? Not much, it's had it's ups and downs in quality with a majority of ups. Having done a great job capturing the gleeful, insanely over the top violence and sardonic, sometimes-playful tone of the original manga. While these particular installments try to get ""war is hell"" serious a bit too often it's understandable for pacing reasons in the film medium. Even with that minor annoyance the overall tone remains true to Kouta Hirano's original, wonderful journey into tasteless excess that would put most any exploitation movie or novel to shame.

As for Funimation's dub and the packaging itself, they are both excellent. Victoria Harwood is THE voice of Integra Hellsing as far as I'm concerned, and it would be equally difficult to accept new English voice actors in any of the key roles. So Funimation should really be commended for going the extra mile in reuniting the original, widely acclaimed English voice cast for the dub of these episodes. Fingers crossed that this set sells well enough that they can do it again for the final two episodes. The discs come in a normal blu-ray box with a thin cardboard slipcover. As someone who bought the limited edition steelbook DVDs for volumes 1-4 I can say this set roughly matches the amount of extras you would find in those understuffed and overpriced collections. It's a bit of a shame we don't get the physical extras the old Geneon special editions came with (steelbook, and alternately a figurine or small artbook) but bringing back the English voice cast more than makes up for it, at least for me. The fact that I got 4 episodes for less than I paid for 1 of the old steelbook special editions doesn't hurt at all either. If you're a fan of the series, buy it. You won't be sorry.",1375747200,,1798,4.707936507936508

It drew me in and won't let go, although I can't really say I want to be let go of. Basically the daughter of Van Hellsing, her servant Alucard, his servant Seras Victoria, pictured on the cover, the butler Walter, Mercenaries, and a host of other people, fight rouge vampires and ghouls in England. There is a lot of blood, fighting, shooting, decapitation, and other forms of violence. Unlike a lot of vampire anime's, this one starts off with a bang and the action never stops. I can't wait for the conclusion, Volumes 9 & 10, to come out on Blu-ray/ DVD combo. Ive watched them with subtitles and I loved it. My only gripe: I think Crispin Freeman's voice is better suited to the character Alucard. As well as the other characters. The setting is England, but the Japanese voices have no English accent. This holds true for the German accents as well. It kind of throws the concept.
If I had to compare it to anything, it'd be Baccano, because of the violence, but honestly the Hellsing series', (both Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate), are so far beyond that. It's beyond anything. The Hellsing Ultimate series is on a level of it own, and I love it.",1371945600,,1284,4.611353711790393

It is extremely entertaining and enthralling.

About the actual product itself. The box was very nice, the art and build were of good quality. There is a space so that (I assume) you can put parts 1-4 in the box with the included discs. This product includes both DVDs and Blu-ray, which is very nice. The quality of the DVDs is great, and I'd assume the same for the blu-rays (my computer doesn't have a blu-ray player so I don't know).

I like how it comes with DVDS and Blu-Ray discs so, just in case something tragically happens to a pair of discs, you still have a backup. However, just know that these volumes are much darker than the first four and personally I love it. I suggest people wait until the prices go down at least $20-$30 if they want to buy it now... just saying for those on a budget. Overall, great action, great characters, great story, great violence, and great series. Also, Alucard is just a complete badass need I say more.",1364860800,,684,4.436507936507937

5192089,5,B008YRL7H6,"I read the manga this anime series is based on. I have watched the original version of the Hellsing anime. The original anime version of the manga pulled a lot of punches. The manga was awash in blood, body parts, bazaar body transformations, heretics, fanatics, and Nazis. All told in a straight forward, cruel, brutal manner and yet still managed to maintain a sense of humor and wonder at it all. Without the restrictions imposed by a strict half hour story format and TV censorship, this remake series is able to indulge in all the grisly, bloody, twisted humor of the manga. It is a masterwork in animated horror. This can't be said that often with a straight face.",1362700800,,670,4.638655462184874

I got 4 episodes where according to the Hellsing wiki page there are still 2 more episodes to come. That makes this artbox useless as an enclosure for the complete series when the next disk is released. I am very disappointed I didn't learn all this before hand. I do blame myself for not doing my research, or perhapses giving in to the excitement that these episodes finally made it to america. However I find it shady marketing to make an artbox not big enough to enclose the entire series. If there is another disk to come there should have been room left in the box for another case. I've been collecting anime for years. Artboxes have always come with the 1st or last vol.

I was especially impressed that the English Dub managed to collect all the original Hellsing English Dub voice actors. It was a delight to once again hear the voice of Crispin Freeman as Alucard especially. The animation quality is especially good and both the English and Japanese audio tracks are worth watching.

I adored the first four and couldn't believe my luck at the price, but not only does the animation look different, but the tone of the series, the characterisation and voice actors are different. It had some awesome moments, though plot events and characterisation had me scratching my head at some points (it might be explained more in the manga; I'll never know). By the end I felt kind of dissapointed, but I'd get the newer installements to see what happens next.

5192112,1,B008YRL7H6,"I love Hellsing.  I love the first anime series.  I love the music, bought up the CD's to both series.  I love the manga.  I love the characters, from the Major to Police Girl.  I love my tiny figures of Alucard, Police Girl, Luke, and Jan.  I love Dracula and vampires and vampire legends.  I even forced myself to read Twilight.  I love the Role Playing Book based on the first series.  Even got one of the anime-mangas (when they make a manga with cells from the anime).  I don't mind the Nazis as the bad guys.  Better than just making copy-cats Nazis.  I don't mind the digs at the Church, as I was raised RC, and am glad I have left the path (as it were).  I love the explosions.  Now, the artwork could be better (frankly I preferred the art style of the first series) and the music comes across as a tad off.  Which is sad because some of it is very good.  But it feels like somebody was trying to do something new and modern and added those stupid songs.  Songs where it should have allowed the action to speak, or sing, for itself.
But I was happy because I wanted to see the final big battles, the battles between Alucard and Walter.  Between Police Girl and the Captain.  And...nope.  They ended the DVD's before the end of the story.  Page 184, Volume 8, of the manga is where they close this series.  It is if Star Wars ended right before the X-Wings launched to attack the Death Star.  IF the last DVD was the last two episodes, even if it meant cramming them in, I would have given this set at least a four stars.  If they had short speeches maybe even a five star rating.  I think the speeches were even longer than in the manga!
But now this is the second series to have Hellsing on the TV screen.  In some ways it was better.  In other ways it failed.  It didn't even bother to wrap up the story in the second set!  Get it used.  Rent it.  Get it out of the library.
There are extras.  But to be honest, who cares?  The story is the steak and potatoes.  And in this meal they burnt the steak and under cooked the potatoes.  Forgive me any spelling mistakes but I had to write this right after viewing the DVD's and am slightly...upset.  I do not wish to offend anybody and I am sure many people enjoyed it.  But in the end, no matter how good it is, it is only half-done.  And with Hellsing, for me half-done is just as bad as not doing it at all.  They should have waited for the last two episodes!",1357948800,2,2418,4.140388768898488
5192113,5,B008YRL7H6,"Don't be surprised when you get the package and see what appears to be a DVD of Volumes I-IV beside the blu-ray case. It's a cardboard insert/placeholder for the first blu-ray pack, which I also purchased from Amazon.

Hellsing Ultimate is an amazing series for adult audiences. The original Hellsing anime was good, but Ultimate took it to a new level, somewhat like Fullmetal Alchemist was rebooted in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. This seems to be a reocurring theme in anime lately. These episodes play out more like consecutive movies than a television series.

Ultimate is far more graphic than the original, and the original was not exactly kid friendly. It is not intended for children, and parental discretion is advised even for young teenagers. That said, it is one of the best translations of a manga series into an anime that I've ever seen. Anime lovers and vampire fans will instantly fall for Alucard, the quintessential BAMF and main character.",1357948800,,965,5.025

5192118,5,B008YRL7H6,"Regarding the quality of the box set, it's great. If you like Hellsing, you'll enjoy this. In case other reviews don't specify, the Ultimate version more closely follows the manga, so after a couple episodes, the 'classic' and 'ultimate' versions diverge (you could make a comparison with Fullmetal Alchemist here). Personally, I like both versions for different reasons.

I want to point out that in this box, there is a case for volumes 5-8 (obviously...), however, there is also a PLACEHOLDER BOX for the volumes 1-4 case. Without unwrapping the box, one might think that the actual vol 1-4 are in this box, but IT IS NOT. I almost returned the vol 1-4 I bought thinking I'd miraculously been given something 'for free'.

Something else, I didn't happen to know this until researching after vol 8 ends with a cliff-hanger: there are multiple volumes beyond this. Apparently, the publisher of the US version of Hellsing Ultimate has the rights to vol 9, but I can't see that it can be purchased yet. And then there are other volumes beyond that (as of this writing, I haven't fully figured out how many).",1356739200,,1106,4.785340314136126

The kawaii gets worse with Police Girl and her German equivalent in the last couple of episodes, which is why I'm only giving this set a 4 star rating.

5192131,5,B008YRL7H6,After 3-4 years of waiting for the release we finally see the episodes 5-8 OVA's. The animation is incredible every episode makes the anime tv series look terrible.. This OVA follows the manga more and more closely. I highly recommend this OVA series if you want to see a REAL VAMPIRE at work.,1354320000,,293,4.547169811320755
5192132,4,B008YRL7H6,"So first off I have not read the manga, but that is not due to a lack of interest or ""loyalty"" to the series. The reason I have not read the manga is purely because I am enjoying seeing the OVA of this series that follows the manga closely, and like the surprises. For anyone who likes some cool fights and vampires that actually drink blood and turn people on a regular basis this is probably a series you may enjoy. This is however undeniably more action than vampire mythos (so far).

I was highly disappointed in Funimation for not releasing the Steel Cases for their take on the series. I thoroughly enjoyed these steel cases and paid the extra for it, as they had very intriguing artwork. They also came with some cool little bonuses as well, which I consider very worth it. Funimation also fails (at least so far) to release these volumes individually and instead just releases them as a chunk, which can save you some money. I personally dislike that and for the Hellsing Ultimate series I would have bought each individual volume so long as it came with a steel book case option, and special features and if it had a little bonus in it too I'd dig it even more. Funimation so far has not seen an interest in doing this though, and I think that is a mistake on their part. For those of you who do not have a clue what I am talking about this series was previously licensed and released/dubbed by Geneon where they did the kind of releases I am stating I would prefer. What I do like about Funimations part though is they did give us Blu-ray, and I personally enjoy that and there are some differences, but unless you're observant you likely won't notice it. (At least most people don't notice it from experiences talking to people). I also dislike the fact that Funimation only has a release that has either an empty spot or cardboard filler box for their release of the series for the volumes 5-8. I already own volumes 1-4 from Geneon and do not have plans to buy Funimations 1-4 until it costs less whether that is by discount or going on sale. Basically what that means is for me it leaves an empty space in my vanity spot for the collection. They also found it to be worth only having it ready for volumes 1-8 with the 2 cases, (Arguably mild spoiler in the following end of this sentence without details though) but this story does continue on further than just 8, so in the future that may be more of a complaint for me. If Funimation later decides to do steel book cases I will likely be more offended, but I may buy them after I sell this particular combo.

The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the first copy I ordered the Blu-ray case was chipped at the top and bottom right corners, as in missing chunks of it the size of my pinky nail. This is purely a cosmetic distaste as all the discs worked fine, but it happened that way nonetheless. I then contacted Amazon about it and they quickly sent me a replacement, as I sent mine in for exchange of same product. This replacement had no issues with it, and everything was fine. Also the other reason for 4 stars is due to the above paragraph on preference(s) for the way it should be released to me, but the story itself is very fun. Chances are though if you're interested in the 5-8 collection you already have your opinion on Hellsing from volumes 1-4 or the manga. I will however note this these episodes do not have as much Alucard as people have grown accustomed, but I found that to still be interesting to learn about the other characters more.",1354147200,4,3535,4.37082066869301

Not to mention the holding case held the DVD case & a paper box where you're supposed to put the first half of the season (seperate order). Why they didn't just sell them together and call it good is beyond me.

Now the other half...

The jap audio is amazing, and gets you right into the series. Feels darker as well!

English audio....I usually give dubs a chance but wow, this was hit and miss! Some roles were played perfectly and others just made me cry inside. Also they change a lot of the script, for the worse and give it a ""corny"" feel.

Overall great series, and a must own for vampire/alucard fans! But terrible presentation with the packaging, and damaged DVD case on my end.

Which means that to not have empty space in this box you have to buy the combined collection of 1-4. I am extremely disappointed in this packaging. I honestly feel ripped off, and I can't even enjoy the OVA because of how angry I am. I purchased the limited editions of the first 4 episodes, and was expecting an art book or something with this, but no, its an empty box saying ""Replace"".

I know its not about the packaging, its about the OVA, but I was expecting it to be something I could proudly put with the rest of my collection, and instead its...basically a half empty box with a normal plastic Blu-ray case.",1353715200,3,880,4.432098765432099
5192136,5,B008YRL7H6,"I can't tell you how happy I am that the team behind Hellsing finally got back together to work on this. I actually found this item on Amazon by pure chance. I was looking up other anime items for a couple of friends when I stumbled upon this treasure. I was so ecstatic because I have the entire manga collection, the tv series, and the hellsing ultimate series as well.

This anime is probably one of my favorite anime of all time for the story, characters, themes, and more! It does justice to the whole idea of vampires and Dracula...definitely puts a twist to the Dracula story.

Amazon offered a great deal for this package because honestly, one Hellsing Ultimate DVD was around 15-25 when I first purchased them. But they were worth it! The animation is great. It follows the manga VERY well unlike the tv series(good but did not do true justice to the manga).

I can't wait for the team to release the last episode. I am going to be sad, but hell I waited years to get these...so why not? I highly recommend for people who like a good story, memorable characters, plot twists, and vampires! haha...even Nazi vampires. These are real vampires. They don't sparkle.

P.S. You can't beat the price for all those episodes, Blue Ray/DVD combo, and the extras that they added to each DVD/Blue Ray. Amazing offer.",1353715200,,1313,4.574468085106383

But I was doubtful of buying it at first because it was only going to be episodes 5-8. But after throwing the idea around in my head for a few days I decided to pre-order it. In short, it's worth it. The anime is well done its sticks completely faithful to the manga. The box set you get comes with a dvd that has the blu-ray and dvds in it and another space in the box for the first volume (ep 1-4).
If you are a Hellsing fan and are on the fence about getting it, do it. Because you should support the compeletion of the series and the anime industry in general.",1353456000,,735,4.075862068965518
5192138,5,B008YRL7H6,"Just started to watch the end of this series which took so long to be released by the studios.
It is truly a epic finish to a already great series. Love that they were able to have all of both the original Japanese
as well as the American voice actors return to complete this series.",1353283200,,283,4.163636363636364
5192139,5,B008YRL7H6,"This is a review of the Blu-Ray edition, although the package came with both DVDs and Blu-Ray disks enclosed.  All four episodes are on one Blu-Ray disk and the other Blu-Ray disk was full of extras. For those who don't know, the Hellsing Ultimate series have rivers of blood and flying body parts, resulting in an MA rating. This package consists of episodes 5-8, and is thus, the middle part of the OVA series. If you are wondering if this is just a remake of the TV series with more violence, be reassured that the plot lines start diverging significantly in this set, so there is new material here.

The setting is this: the good guys have a vampire (Alucard) working for them to destroy bad vampires. One set of bad guys are resurgent Nazi's who run around creating vampires/zombies in England. Another set of bad guys are from an alternate Vatican and seem to be a modern Spanish Inquisition. One group of them are decked out like Ku Klux Clan members. They want to wipe out all the protestants and vampires in England. As disk 5 opens, they all converge on London.

One character in the original Hellsing wasn't developed very well, namely Serias, the police girl. Episode 7 has a good development of her character. She finally gets pushed enough that she develops into a real player in the action. I have this faint hope that by the end of the series she and Alucard get together for a ""happy"" ending.

The Blu-Ray quality was excellent. One fly in the ointment was that a few times in episodes 5 & 6 the producers use cartoon animation to make some point, which detracted from the story a little.  The music was good, and each episode had different music and animation.  However, in one episode they had a couple of songs with people singing during the middle of the action, which I though did not add much. The plot line had diverged enough by the end of Episode 8 that they were able to put a real cliff-hanger in to hook you into however many episodes are to come in the future.

If you have seen previous Hellsing shows this is a must have. If you haven't you should also buy Episodes 1-4 so you aren't hopping into the middle of the story.",1353283200,2,2153,4.463104325699746
5192140,5,B008YRL7H6,"The Blu-rays haven't been released here in my country yet, so I'd like to buy this box set. Could anyone tell me who already bought it how the regional codes of the Blu-rays are?",1353283200,,178,4.264705882352941
5192141,4,B008YRL7H6,"It's Hellsing, it's blu-ray what more do you want?  Ultimately the only people buying this are the ones who already know what Hellsing is so I'm not going to bother explaining it.  If you don't know what Hellsing is I'd recommend just getting the Manga instead, the anime compresses the story a bit and things will feel rushed and at times very confusing.  At the end this is an action story and the plots only point is to send the characters from one battle to another.  It of course has the classic dub problem since it is impossible to sync up a different languages to mouth flaps, though I did feel that some of the voice actors were phoning in their acting at times.  Especially screams, there are times when a character should be screaming at the top of their lungs and all you get is an ""augh my arm, that sucks"".  But whatever the Japanese track is there if you prefer it.

It has bonus stuff as well if you're in to that.  Personally I think it's a waste of a blu-ray.  Seriously the 2nd blu-ray disc is just the bonus stuff.

I only have two things I'd say are legitimately bad about this collection.  1) Why the hell am I being forced to buy the DVD too?  Seriously what a huge waste of money for both the consumer and for Funimation for printing them up.  I'm assuming they were contractually obligated to make DVDs and just bundled them with the Blu-Ray to get rid of them.  2) Only up to episode 8 and the box is clearly not designed to fit the future releases.  There are at least 2 more episodes left to complete the story and episode 9 is already out.  It actually came out in February so I'm actually very confused as to why it didn't make this box set.  I foresee Funimation charging us all another 40 bucks for the remaining two episodes.  If you are looking for a definitive box set collection this isn't it but it may be as close as you will ever get, English language version at least.",1352937600,2,1908,4.296918767507003
5192142,5,B008YRL7H6,"Is Hellsing Ultimate 5-8 perfect? God no.  The dialogue isn't as sharp as the original TV series, the editing isn't as tight, the comedy is out of place in most instances, and some questionable decisions were made with regards to the audio when some characters speak.

But make no mistake, this is great TV.

Over the last four or five years vampire fair has been limited mostly to teen angst relationships and brooding melodramas.  Hellsing has none of that.  It's violent, dark, and twisted, and volumes 5-8 represent the best of the series thus far.

Volumes 5-8 are principally concerned with the invasion of London by the Last Battalion, a force of 1000 Nazi vampires with the ability to turn victims into zombies, as well as other interested parties later on.  Most of this takes place in the first 5 minutes of volume 5 and sets the stage for the next 3 hours of movie left in this box set.  A bold decision is made early on to remove the principal defense of the protagonists, which for the first time in the series leaves the good guys vulnerable, resulting in massive casualties for all sides of an ever growing and more out of control battle.

Whereas volumes 1-4 were a collection of interesting encounters with a thin thread of continuity stringing them together, 5-8 are more cohesive and interconnected.  The motivations of the characters play a huge part in these volumes, adding just enough depth and nuance to make you identify with people who are facing down death.  And truly this show does not shy away from death.  Not only do good guys die in this show, they die painfully.  The cliche honorable sacrifice abounds, but it's not glorified.  Deaths in Hellsing are messy, slow, and not especially dignified.  In this way Hellsing is not unlike a modern war movie like Saving Private Ryan.  In fact, what little down time exists is spent allowing characters to reflect on their own powerlessness, their fears, their desires, and in many cases their mortality.  Volumes 5-7 focus mainly on the pawns of war.  The people who are the first to be sacrificed in battle.

Only in the final volume do the tides begin to change as the protagonist, Alucard, returns and unleashes a hell all his own that redirects the series in an altogether new direction before ending on a spectacular cliffhanger.

At over 3 hours long, plus bonus content, Hellsing Ultimate Volumes 5-8 is an absolute steal for $46 or so dollars.  Far cheaper per minute than previous releases.  Furthermore, the quality of the animation in this show is unmatched.  Long gone is the TV series' fluctuating quality.  While the CG and the standard animation don't quite blend seamlessly in this series, it's also not distracting.  The emotional highs in Hellsing Ultimate are matched only by the intricate and gorgeous visuals that permeate the action scenes.

For fans of Hellsing this is a must have set.  Streaming this illegally on the internet, as many will likely do, will pale in comparison to the quality of the Blu-Ray in it's uncompressed form.  For people unfamiliar with the series, this is a fantastic time to get into it because there is nothing else like Hellsing Ultimate and there's no way it'll ever end up on TV.

What else is left so say.  Hellsing is back, and it's better than ever.",1352764800,3,3283,4.749116607773852

5192144,3,B008YRL7H6,"I really want to specify that I am in no way a dub hater. I have watched most of my anime in dub and Crispin Freeman is my favorite voice actor. Now that I have actually viewed all the content multiple times I feel obliged to give a better review. This was a very disappointing release. Many people have been waiting 4 years to finally hear 5-8 in a dub and I think the direction they went in wasn't wise. Adding a two tone effect in the vampires voice would work; however, it was inconsistently added. Does it play when Alucard speaks telepathically, dramatically or normally is not indicated at all. There were also parts in which some of translations could be laughable. In one case a soldier has his entire body blown up and only half of his torso remains. His captain calls to him and tells him 'not to die' where in the sub he just called his name. It would make more sense if he just called his name as oppose to saying something that was clearly impossible. I think that the strongest areas in the dub were the supporting characters. I was especially impressed with the voices for Heinkel and Yumie, but disappointed with Liam O'Brien's Jackal Willis. They just had him do it with complete disregard of the SUB and Bruce Willis.

Another reason as to why I am disappointed with this release, is that it isn't native HD. 5-7 are an improvement overall compared to 1-4; however, at moments 1-4's remastered scenes look more visually appealing than 5-7. I am not sure if this is an effect for 5-7 or it is just SD. This is the case for Japan as well so I guess nothing could be done. OVA 8 looks fantastic though, except for CG work, which I am personally not a fan of in anime.

Since I am reviewing the product and not really the show I am giving a 3/5. Separately, I think this is a fantastic series and OVA 5-8 is where we see the real action finally kick in. As a whole I give this series a 10/10 easily. I personally feel like the DUB is more maniacal, where the SUB is more serious. I don't have high hopes for the dub in OVA 9, because I see finding someone capable of voicing a certain character will be quite the challenge.",1352073600,5,2138,4.302729528535981
5192145,5,B008YRL7H6,"This review is of the Blu-ray and yes I own it! I got this at Youmacon in Detroit MI two weeks before it is officially released by Funimation.

Picture:

If you didn't know the reason why this has been taking SO long to come out is because the animation for the project has been bouncing studios.  Episodes 1-4 is from one studio and episode 5-8 is from another and 9-10 is the same studio that did the original Hellsing anime. What does that mean?  Well it means that it has taken a lot longer for the whole anime to come out and the animation style is different from each block of episodes.  The Blu-ray version of this fixes this problem as they touched up the anime to make it consistent though the whole 1-10 episodes.  They also add in more detail.  The blu-ray version is essentially a remastering of the anime, and it looks great!  If you own the DVDs you will notice the difference and it's for the better.  Picture quality is just stunning.

Sound:

Crank up your sound systems because your in for a treat!!  Every blood splatter is heard with great gruesome detail!  It's 5.1 and it sounds great.  You will love the sound of this collection.

Extras:

Surprisingly more than most anime DVD's!  I am just going to copy and past the extra's being I have not watched them at this time, so I can not tell you if they are worth it.  I can say it's more than the clean opening and clean ending and promo's.  So that is a plus already!
Special Features: Episode Commentary, Dubbing Hellsing - The 10th year Anniversary Interviews, Hellsing Cast Round Table Discussion, Anime Vegas 2010 Hellsing Panel, Fans' Questions Answered, The Dawn: A Supplementary of Hellsing, Textless Closing Songs, U.S. Trailer, Previews.  As you can see way better than what most anime blu-ray or dvds have to offer!!!

Packaging:

Standard Blu-Ray packaging with multiple disk. I do not know about this particular product but the one I bought at Youmacon had an art box that I could slip the episodes 1-4 box set into. Overall nothing impressive, but it gets the job done.

Story:

I am not going to get into the story, because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.  I will say it's about a Vampire and a organization that kills Vampires and other monster. Somewhere Nazi's come into play and all hell breaks lose.  If your into that, this will not disappoint you!! Not for Children!!!!  This is a very bloody and gruesome anime that can scare young children very easily!

Conclusion:

Simply one of the best releases from Funimation!  It ranks in my opinion one of the top five anime made. It is something that you can make a friend watch that is not into anime and they will be hard pressed to not like it.  Buy this Blu-Ray release and forget about the DVDs of the past.  You will not be disapointed.  The only problem is now you have to spend more money to get the box set of the first four episodes of the Blu-Ray.

Please Note:  This Product does included the DVD version of the anime as well!! it's double the bang for your buck!!",1352073600,18,3024,4.486238532110092
5192146,4,B008YRL7H6,"After waiting for a grueling four years, Hellsing fans finally receive ova's five through eight on blu-ray. Volumes nine through ten will no doubt come out in the third or fourth quarter of 2013. The dub compared to the Japanese audio is very well done but at some points the actors could have tried being louder. I have only two complaints about this blu-ray release. The first is that Hellsing the Dawn episode one is not dubbed. It is only in Japanese with english subtitles. Are you telling me Taliesin Jaffe who is the voice director couldn't find the time to dub the Dawn? That was a disappointment for me.

My last complaint was that Taliesin made the awful and rather, dumb decision to dual voice the characters Alucard, Zorin, and Seras on certain scenes. In the first four ova's the characters did not sound like that so why change them? In disc two in an interview, he stated that he wanted the characters to sound everywhere and not just in one spot. There is no option to remove the dual voices unfortunately in the menu. Complain to Taliesin and to Geneon. Whoever is in charge and have them redo the blu-rays.

Those two complaints alone were the only reason I won't be giving this five stars. Taliesin what the hell were you thinking?",1351987200,18,1250,4.575892857142857
