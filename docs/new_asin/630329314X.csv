7843869,5,630329314X,I used this video in conjunction with my 7th grade lesson on birds. It was excellent! It supported what we had been learning and the kids enjoyed watching it. They had many new questions about birds after we watched the video. I highly recommend this whole series.,1114473600,,264,4.638297872340425
