8291662,4,B001D4NPKE,"Yu-Gi-Oh! 5d's premiered on 4kids TV - 9/13/2008. The story takes place in the future where duels are conducted on motorcycles AKA rudders.
In turbo duels, normal spells are forbidden. Low level monsters now have the ""polymerization"" ability.
The story from what I can tell is that the main character had his rudder and cards stolen in the past from a person named Jack.. Now, he is out for revenge. He lives over in the satellite which is apart from Domino City. One of his friends obtained an illegal chip and now is being used in the main character's rudder making it very powerful.
The main character's voice sounds a lot like Tristan Taylor (Yu-Gi-Oh!).
The graphics are good. Gameplay is good as well. As far as the story goes, no rating (not enough information).
One other thing: Apparently this version is in Japanese only. Look above under ""Language""",1221350400,4,859,4.771812080536913
