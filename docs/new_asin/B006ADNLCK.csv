8495775,5,B006ADNLCK,"Awesome effects, all dinosaurs and see monsters look like real! Yet the best part is this DVD includes actually THREE movies, and the third one - Chased by Sea Monsters - is out of print, and it sold on a separate DVD for about $30 on Amazon. It's a bargain to get this 3-movies-DVD for less than a price of one movie! My whole family enjoyed it and learned a lot! I would recommend it to any dinosaurs fan!",1321747200,,407,4.1645569620253164
