7980876,5,B000089G64,Hello to everyone I would first like to comment on the price of the video. The tape is only 97 dollars on her website. If you are going to spend your hard earned money on hairbraiding videos I would suggest that you visit the website first because most of the tapes on amazon are overprice I actually have 5 of her videos that only cost me around 270 free shipping so you do the math. I gave the videos a 5 star because they are great videos and they show clear,1156809600,,461,4.076923076923077
7980877,5,B000089G64,The video was very informative.  I have been braiding hair as a hobby since I was a child.  I feel confident that I can duplicate the West Coast Swoop.
