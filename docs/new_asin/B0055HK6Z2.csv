4578010,3,B0055HK6Z2,"Way too much over-head. Seems every choice they make is the wrong one. The are constantly growing deeper into debt and borrowing money from anyone who will give it to them, only to make more bad choices. They had no clue how to mine from the get-go. One catastrophe after another. A comedy of errors, but it's not the slightest bit funny.

It is painful to watch. I watched season one on Netflix and they spent over $250K only to recover $20K in gold before the winter forced them to leave. Their operating costs were $1K/day. Have of the gold they recovered was just flushed right out the end of their processing plant due to sheer ignorance.

They had their wives and kids up there with them and they were drinking water straight from the streams, unfiltered. Bears and God-only-knows what else everywhere, but didn't have the common sense to bring a Brita Filter to protect themselves from things in the water. One of the little girls had a grand mal seizure and was rushed to the hospital. Oops. Goofed again.

This is really frustrating to watch, though I can't help myself. I bought season two on Amazon because I figured they had to have learned enough from their bungling in Season one to make it a better view. So far, NOT! It only gets worse. And now there is definitely more scripting, to increase the drama. With this show, they don't need more drama.

And the narrator isn't as enjoyable to listen to as Mike Rowe (Deadliest Catch, Dirty Jobs.) They need someone with a more interesting voice. That alone would help the show.

Do yourself a favor and just walk away before bothering to get into this show. You'll be glad I saved you from the misery.",1327708800,5,1662,4.545150501672241

4578023,4,B0055HK6Z2,"I really enjoy Gold Rush except the show gives away too much of what's coming on the next show and they repeat and repeat and repeat so much of what happened after commericals. Often the story spins its wheels and doesn't get very far.

4578028,5,B0055HK6Z2,"We really enjoy this show though we would prefer to keep the gold mining in Alaska rather than Ghana! A mistake perhaps by Todd Hoffman?  The Hoffman crew have so many pitfalls they continue to overcome that there is very little gold mining action to watch. My thanks to the Hoffman's for their shining example of praying and limiting the cursing. Regardless, each team deserves our attention because of their bold willingness to battle the elements in their common quest to find gold. We love to follow young Parker Schnabel as he continues to mine gold, who occasionally relies on his grandpa's sage advice. Grandpa John has such wisdom and freely imparts advice, when asked, to his young grandson who is quite young in years but is proving to be a stable, reliable, mining contender in the business. Grandpa John is a wonderfully happy and dear man who always sees the positive side of things reminding me of my own grandpa. Last season saw a tremendous success for the Schnabel team! Congrats to all of the miners who find it indeed takes teamwork to mine for gold in Alaska's beautiful land! If there were one thing I would change, it is the amount of cursing on the show. The bleeping helps, but I would rather the cursing not be there at all. However, as a former Alaskan of many years, I look forward to a new season soon....!",1400630400,,1334,4.605042016806722

4578062,1,B0055HK6Z2,"The inept and clueless invade Alaska! Is this a comedy? A drama? Its a scripted docudrama, starring Todd and Jack Hoffman, former slumlord motel owners from Sandy, OR. They round up a band of their hillbilly friends, and, bankrolled by Discovery, head north to gold mine and end up losing their shirts. If you like bad acting, obvious scripted melodrama, and more silly nonsense than a 3 Stooges movie, you'll love these clueless hillbilly buffoons as they try and convince us they're sincere about finding gold. Its one crisis after another, with Todd dragging his 400 pound frame around the mine site, like an Alaskan bear rooting for its next meal in the camps garbage cans. If this series doesn't make you laugh so hard your sides hurt, something is wrong with you.",1347494400,5,769,4.7894736842105265
4578063,5,B0055HK6Z2,Can't beat the price or the speed of delivery on this DVD. We watched the show from first season and this group of guys ought to be called the Bad Decision Gang.

I love Gold Rush,I never thought I would like a reality show like this. It's interesting the things you learn and you root for the Hoffman family and crew. I never realized there were gold mining operations going on like this. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different reality show with lots of heart. I can't wait for season 2 to hit DVD.",1338940800,5,509,4.425531914893617
4578066,1,B0055HK6Z2,"A bunch of incompetent Yahoos go out digging in the woods. Its really as simple as that. Aload of twerps get some money together, decide to go to alaska and try to mine Gold..... Very Unsuccessfully. If there was a competition between The sea shepherd crew of WHALE WARS and the Hoffman crew on GOLD RUSH over which bunch of morons were the most incompetent ,the Hoffmans would win by miles. It was cringe worthy to watch, especially the patriarch of the group , the father.... There's a Certified Fool if ever there was one.

We all know there's bears in alaska don't we, so if we were setting up camp we'd take a gun or two for protection.... But 47???? What are they thinking??? Complete and utter Yahoos..... And why the hell did they bring their kids up there.... Watch it... Even just one episode, it will make you happy to know that even on your worst day you will be more intelligent than any of these guys on their best day.",1338336000,6,933,4.393063583815029
4578067,5,B0055HK6Z2,"I loved the show. They busted their humps to find gold. I learned how hard it is to dig for gold. The people are really nice people and they gave it their all. I really respect them for not quitting. It was entertaining, interesting and I would love to see season two but Amazon is charging 1.99 per episode.  Season 1 was free for Prime members.  I don't know why season two is not free also.",1333843200,2,393,4.157894736842105
4578068,5,B0055HK6Z2,"This is a great reality show.  It shows regular guys trying to make a go of it.  There is no script, it just unfolds each week.  No promise of riches.  It is educational on what it takes to get gold out of the ground and I have a much better appreciation for that.  But most of all it shows how American persistence and effort eventually pay off.  Would be a good educational tool for those lazy people with a sense of entitlement although I suspect it would be lost on them.

Go Hoffman crew!!!",1331596800,,495,4.202127659574468

8458281,4,B0055HK6Z2,I bought for my husband and not a bad series they just get a little drawn out at times and it seems that they edit just for the controversy and not content.  My husband is not sure if he wants the next series.,1454803200,,209,3.86046511627907

It is one of those that is so addictive I can not wait to watch another episode, then comes the wait for next season, there in is the benefit of  these season-sets, you can get the past seasons and watch them while you wait for next season to release.
