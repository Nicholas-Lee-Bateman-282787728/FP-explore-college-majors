5554548,4,B00B3XT9NW,"Set in Naples we meet Luciano (Aniello Arena) who is a fishmonger in one of the City's beautiful piazzas. He is happily married with adoring children and as an extended family aswell as  a network of supporting friends. He and his wife Maria (Loredana Simioli) also pull scams in order to bolster their income. They have a great line going on with robotic kitchen aids. Then so called `reality' TV show `Big Brother' comes to town for auditions. Everyone knows `Enzo' who won the previous year and is now in demand simply for being famous, weddings, bah mitzvahs, anything.

Well Luciano's daughter asks him to audition as he is always such a laugh at family gatherings and so he goes ahead. Then he gets asked to go to Rome for the interview and he sort of knows its a foregone conclusion that he will get in. He tells everyone and everyone in turn starts rooting for him. With the inevitable three month filming, he then thinks about creating a whole new life and binning the old one; all he needs now is the phone call and he is in the Big Brother House.

This is billed as a comedy but if anything I thought it was more tragic-comic. The performances are all great especially Aniello Arena as he slowly looses it all for the want of fame. The whole thing is very stylishly filmed as we now tend to expect from Italian cinema, and the beautiful locations only add to that. The issues are very much to the fore and it was nice to see two virtual unknowns being cast as the leads by director Matteo Garrone, who shot to fame with the excellent `Gomorrah', so it is nice to see a lighter film from him.

The catch phrase of Enzo is `never give up' which seems to be a thread running through the film, the underlying messages are somewhat different, more like `know when you are beat', sort of thing. It is in Italian with a bit of English and good sub titles it runs to 117 minutes, and is an extremely good film. I wanted to like it and I actually did, but I did not find it funny as stated earlier hence my rating, it is still though an excellent piece of cinema that takes on some serious issues in a light hearted way but still manages to deliver.",1375315200,3,2151,4.343283582089552
5554549,5,B00B3XT9NW,"Reality is the newest film by Italian filmmaker Matteo Garrone, the auteur behind 2008's Gomorrah. While that film focused on the criminal underworld of Naples, this follows the story of Luciano and his ambitions to appear on the reality television program Big Brother. Luciano is a wild character, always playing a role, always wanting to be seen, to be the center of a crowd. But when Big Brother has open casting near him, and his family prods him, he decides to audition.

He doesn't initially make it onto the show, but he is convinced that the audition continues, and believes that visitors to his fish stand might be secret scouts from the tv channel, checking to see if he is worthy of joining the cast. The borders of his day to day reality begin to fray, and a rich hopeful fantasy is developed wherein he might, if he is generous and good, eventually be chosen to be an Italian idol.

The film was initially described as a comedy, but I found it to be much darker than that, as it becomes increasingly clear that Luciano is losing his mind. It plays on the desires many of us have to become famous, to have it made, to be a celebrity. Too muh attention and favor directed towards the (false) reality of television makes us lose touch with our own. Our reality, too, is insufficient. If we go too far, we might even reach the point where our lives are only validated, are only real, when we can see them onscreen.

Garrone is proving to be one of the great contemporary Italian filmmakers. Perhaps because of the differences between this (media satire) and Gomorrah (crime thriller) it didn't garner much praise or attention, but give it a shot knowing better. Its one of the best films of the year. I cant wait to see what he does next.",1375056000,2,1747,4.522151898734177
5554550,5,B00B3XT9NW,"Matteo Garrone's Reality - winner of the Grand Prix award at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival - is a marvelous piece of work. It is also, however, difficult to describe. The trailers for Reality, in my opinion, tend to give the wrong impression, that it is a comedy or a satirical send-up of reality shows. But while there are comedic moments in the film, particularly in the earlier parts, as the story progresses it draws you deeper and deeper into some dark territory, but it does it so gradually and seductively that even as your feelings of unease begin to rise, you cannot bring yourself to look away. The closest comparison I can make is to think of it as a combination of a dark twin-piece to 1998's The Truman Show, except that here the protagonist is outside looking in, and Josef von Sternberg's 1930 masterpiece The Blue Angel (Der Blaue Engel).

Set in the current day, Luciano (Aneillo Arena) is a likeable everyday guy in Naples. He has a good life, a loving family, and while he's not rich, he manages to get by with his regular job as a fishmonger and a little scam he runs on the side ripping off pasta-makers from the manufacturer and selling them on the black market.  Life is good... until one day, out of the blue, he gets a chance to try out for Grande Fratello, the Italian version of the TV show Big Brother.  And thus begins his seduction by the prospect of becoming a celebrity.

Highly, highly recommended.",1365465600,,1431,4.534883720930233
5554551,4,B00B3XT9NW,"In ""Reality"" Matteo Garrone makes the mundane life in Napoli beautiful. The fish mongering main character Luciano is lead further and further down the rabbit hole as his pipe dream of being on the reality tv show, ""Big Brother"" takes hold of him. There's a comical tone that hovers over their everyday lives and turns dark as Luciano's family and the viewer realize the opportunity he's waiting for will never come. But we root for him anyway. We root for him to get on the show. Then once we realize that's not going to happen we root for him not to throw away his whole life behind his hopes. But the Reality is he's been taken and we wait to see just how tragic it will turn out.

The score fits perfectly with the plot. The acting is superb from the main characters to the supporting characters. Matteo Garrone has created an enthralling and wonderful, well rounded viewing experience that gives you a good dose of Reality.",1362614400,,927,4.550898203592815

I purchase this movie on Blu Ray and to no such luck with my LG Region free player it will not play. I get a message saying Region Code Error. I thought it was my player wasn't switching over. I played a Region A movie and i had to switch back to A. So this tells me i got a bad print of the movie.

Just wanted to let American consumers know and who ever else look to purchase it on Blu ray.",1491523200,,516,3.8679245283018866

8562194,5,B00B3XT9NW,Absolutely incredible film. I'm astonished it's not a bigger hit. A great satire of reality TV culture. Based in a true story. Starring someone who was on work-release from jail where he was residing for having committed double murder. Many films are shot in one take with a roaming camera. Meticulously directed with the passion of a genius. Love this film.,1443225600,,358,4.885245901639344
8562195,5,B00B3XT9NW,"This is a very dark comedy about an average guy, Luciano, who is seduced by the power of the media.  He wants to get on the Italian version of ""Big Brother"" so badly that he loses he grip on, you guessed it, reality.  He loses everything, in fact.  The ending is enigmatic, as is the current style of film these days, but the film left me with a mixture of melancholy tinged with a rueful kind of laughter---the guy is human, after all.  All he wants is a better life for his wife and kids.  And yet he loses the very things he loves.  This movie embodies, in a  strange, almost mystical way, the old, true words of Shakespeare----""what fools these mortals be."" Yeah, he's foolish---as are we all.  You should see it.  It is a little masterpiece of its kind.",1419379200,,758,4.319148936170213

After watching it, I can tell you this film is now one of my favorites. It really taught me about Italian culture and it ended up being one of the most entertaining films I've had the pleasure of seeing. I have now bought it on Amazon and encourage you all to do the same! I hope you choose to watch it, as it really is a spectacular film.",1376352000,,506,4.01980198019802
