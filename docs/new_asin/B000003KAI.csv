7903045,5,B000003KAI,"I enjoyed this episode of Star Trek Voyager and certainly think that it is one of the more important episodes from Season Two of the show.
In this episode, arch-enemy Seska returns, and with the help of the Kazon Nistrem, takes over the ship and leaves the Voyager crew on a remote and dangerous planet.  Only problem is, two of Voyager's crew members escape initial detection by the Kazon!!!
This episode leaves us with Janeway and company stranded on the planet and the ship firmly in the hands of the Kazon - and so for this reason, it is an excellent Season Two cliffhanger!  Some fine writing combines with some fine acting by all members of the ensemble cast to make this a strong episode.
Please note that the continuation of ""Basics"" is *not* episode 43, but episode 46.  So if you want to see the end of the story, make sure you purchase episode 46 as well!",997747200,,866,4.468354430379747
7903046,4,B000003KAI,"Chakotay is tricked by Seska into believing that she has a child which belongs to him. So the Intrepid Class Voyager helps Chakotay to rescue his  baby son. But unfortunately they all were tricked by the evil Seska and her  Kazon friends; Voyager was surrounded by 8 Kazon ships and eventually  overtaken by the Kazon. They left the Voyager crew on a remote planet and  took the highly advanced Federation ship with them...
This is one of the  most tempting two part series in the whole of Voyager and one of the many  great episodes in the entire Series.",966384000,,555,4.555555555555555
