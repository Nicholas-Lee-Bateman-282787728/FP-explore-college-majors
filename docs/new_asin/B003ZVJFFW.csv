8411094,1,B003ZVJFFW,"The most offensive type of double-dipping, this collection is only 9 of the 27 episodes, being shilled at the astoundingly rip-off price of $10, when the entire 27 episode boxed set can be purchased HERE ON AMAZON.COM for $7.49 {Edit: $5 now; if you buy this janky mini-collection for $2 less, you deserve to get ripped off}.  Seriously.  SPEND $2.00 MORE AND BUY THE COMPLETE SET, PEOPLE.  This release is totally worthless.

If you buy this, the {insert people you fear because of different looks/actions/lifestyle/culture} have won.

Edited to revise for the fact that the complete series is cheaper than this tiny portion.  Something is seriously wrong with this picture, and it's not something conjured from that dork Presto's hat.",1284422400,68,736,5.091666666666667
