8211885,3,B000U1ZVA8,"Interesting parts. I never thought about the hero's behind the scenes, cracking secrete codes or throwing the enemy off, as the man who never was.
Weapons section was also interesting/",1420675200,,184,5.166666666666667

8211887,3,B000U1ZVA8,"I got these in a boxed set as a gift, and the footage is frequently second to none. Roberts Powell's plummy English tones however seem more suited to reading bedtime stories to posh kids in 1930s London.",1398902400,,203,4.513513513513513

Many hours was spent searching for this series and it is a pleasure to add it to my collection.",1343779200,,346,4.257575757575758
8211890,5,B000U1ZVA8,Outstanding series with rare footage of all events covered. A true tribute to the Men and Women of both sides who gave there up most for the cause of World War 2.,1327017600,,162,4.09375
8211891,2,B000U1ZVA8,I had a hard time finding a player that would play all four sides without stutters and pixilation. Maybe a freak problem in production but it makes watching all chapters hard on all but one player.,1288742400,,197,4.5

These four TV series are valuable in treating interesting phenomena of World War II that are less frequently covered on video. Each episode is in stereo, 4:3 format, and vintage B&W (mostly) and vintage color, with modern embellishments (maps, background info, etc.) in color. The quality of the archival footage is variable of course, but all is watchable. The quality of the modern color supplements is very good to excellent (e.g., Bletchley Park). Narration is by actor Robert Powell (born 1944).
