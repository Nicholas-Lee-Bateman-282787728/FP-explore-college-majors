2793111,3,B000OCTRRQ,The DVD was good except the last 10 minutes freezes and had to fast forward with no sound. Enjoyed up until then.,1390262400,,113,4.181818181818182
2793112,3,B000OCTRRQ,The film was a good effort towards showing the inequality of freedom in America . ..we are not where we were and thank goodness we have moved forward...yet we still have further to go..,1388620800,,185,4.470588235294118
2793113,5,B000OCTRRQ,"I loved this film.  Considering the time period in which it was made, and the subject matter, this film is a 10.  It is truly a film that is worth reviving.",1388361600,,156,4.0
2793114,2,B000OCTRRQ,A first term film major could surely turn out something better to watch. Was this actually put out in the theaters? Hard to believe this film got more than a one time run.,1387670400,,171,4.212121212121212
2793115,5,B000OCTRRQ,"When watching a film such as this, the first thing I notice is the release date 1966.  Sure the acting is not the strongest point and finding such white participants would be the same pool to be found in later 'Blacksploitation Films"".  The strong points are not the actual acting but the resources implemented.  A black man that could pass for white with a white lover presenting him the taboo notion of his possible mixed heritage.  I thought characters couldn't even remotely be so inquisitive in a film given the time period.  Then there's the audacity of making such a film given it was right in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement era.  The funny parts in the film such as the main protagonist strangling his white lover over rage of ""the White Man"", in this case the Klan murdering his daughter from a previously relationship with a black woman.  The Klan outfits were very inaccurate, making these men appear to be half Catholic ordained priests wearing Klan hoods.  Very amusing indeed...",1387238400,6,1000,4.7398843930635834
2793116,5,B000OCTRRQ,"I enjoyed the movie because I like fish out of water and revenge stories, If that is your forte, this is an excellent one.",1357344000,,122,4.125
2793117,5,B000OCTRRQ,"I'd never heard of this movie until, while reading a bio on the late Withman Mayo (Sanford and Son), I saw the title and decided to check it out. This movie was way ahead of it's time. A movie with this subject matter, to be made and released in 1966, had me going ""Whoa!"" to myself. I don't know how well it did at the theaters (if any theaters dared to show it). But, I'm sure it raised eyebrows. Max Julien (The Mack) also makes an appearance in the film.",1308960000,23,458,4.1

2793130,4,B000OCTRRQ,I think someone should remake it. Good movie for its time. And Grady from Sanford and Son is in it too.,1466553600,2,103,3.9523809523809526
2793131,5,B000OCTRRQ,Awesome movie.  Love to see a movie where the men stood up to defend their families,1466121600,,83,4.1875
2793132,4,B000OCTRRQ,The story was classic. I like the sentiment of it it could've been less choppy and probably longer but it's a older movie understandably.,1465776000,2,137,4.75

2793137,2,B000OCTRRQ,Not so interesting,1462406400,,18,5.333333333333333
2793138,3,B000OCTRRQ,"It is a poorly produced film, but the message can never be put out there enough. Hare and racism at any level is bad for all of us. We must never for get that. Our time on this small planet is so short we must work together to enjoy what time we have here.",1460851200,3,256,3.759259259259259

2793145,5,B000OCTRRQ,Great story,1456617600,,11,5.0
2793146,1,B000OCTRRQ,"Idiotic and silly. A great plot that could have been better developed with a little more thought and conviction. It should have been made as a comedy. But I found it fascinating to watch one of the most dumbest movies I have ever seen. It like that strange feeling when you are passing by a car wreck and can't just help yourself from slowing down and looking over.

Personally, I think I could have done a better job myself.",1455580800,,425,4.379746835443038
2793147,1,B000OCTRRQ,"much over acting of characters. not certain when this film was made, but i'm guessing sometime during the 1950's. didn't bother to look for information. was somewhat disappointed, but i couldn't turn it off. it was kind of like a train wreck. . . . i couldn't stop watching.",1455580800,,274,4.612244897959184

2793151,3,B000OCTRRQ,Its okay.,1453680000,,9,4.0
2793152,2,B000OCTRRQ,"The only thing more frustrating that watching a white actor pretending to be a black guy pretending to be white was the abundance of misogyny and lack of depth in each character and their performances. The film did seem to provide some context on how the Klan operates which was a 50/50 mix of interesting and disturbing. There were also quite a few plot twists, but if you have a choice between watching this and something else...watch something else.",1453593600,,452,4.734177215189874
2793153,4,B000OCTRRQ,Good plot and very realistic,1453507200,,28,4.8

2793161,5,B000OCTRRQ,Was  good  movie,1445558400,,16,4.0
2793162,5,B000OCTRRQ,"This movie is short and to the point. The acting is reflective of its time, the clarity of the film is reflective of its time but the message is a bold message that was made during its time. I read most of the reviews prior to watching this film and despite some of the negativity, I am glad I chose to watch it with an opened mind.

I attempted to watch Grapes of Wrath and fell asleep! I wanted to know how this would play out and was intrigued to see what the next move was going to be and surprised when it wasn't what I thought. I appreciate the script and the climatic ending.

What I didn't appreciate was the gosh awful hair piece that Jerry kept removing to ""prove"" he was a negro! He could have gotten it chemically straighten and he would have achieved the same look. I am an black woman with mixed sons who have the same hair texture, so I know that the ""AH-HA"" moment could've been achieved without removing a bad wig!

There you have it, the only reason not to watch this film is because of the bad wig, which plays a major role in climax-lol",1444435200,,1056,4.166666666666667
2793163,1,B000OCTRRQ,Terrible,1443484800,,8,8.0
2793164,4,B000OCTRRQ,This is a quirky odd picture. Set in the sixties it chronicles a black man's attempt to infiltrate the Klu Klux Klan. Racism is pervasive and flows through this movie like a river. Man's inhumanity against man.,1439164800,9,210,4.702702702702703
2793165,3,B000OCTRRQ,"Interesting. But, the video quality wasn't the best, maybe due to it being an older film.",1439078400,,89,4.625
2793166,4,B000OCTRRQ,A black man becoming a part of the klan; who would've thought. I've never heard of it.,1437436800,,86,4.117647058823529

2793170,1,B000OCTRRQ,Not what I was expecting. Low budget film.,1424476800,,42,4.375
2793171,5,B000OCTRRQ,"This is an amazing movie! No taboos were broken here even if a couple of necks were. This implausible movie does give a view into the inner sanctum of the KKK and presents the leader in a ""raise the ruckus and the MONEY"" way evocative of a shady pastor. Why implausible? Who could swallow that an undercover Negro could go back to his own town and join the Klan? Negroes talk ... Emmitt Till anyone? And that one drop produced such drama in the protagonist as well. Worth watching!",1422230400,3,481,4.415730337078652
2793172,5,B000OCTRRQ,"This movie was very interesting!  The acting is fantastic in this movie.  It also gave me a feeling that I always knew.  Light complexioned people love their brothers and sisters as well as everyone else.  The man in this movie put his life on the line.  That's love!  If you saw the special on Oprah's OWN channel, Light Girls, there were light complexioned youth who were sent to the north to pass as white by their families.  Yet, there were many that stayed to fight the fight.  Rosa Parks sat down because she was tired.  This man stood up because his child was killed.  Wonderful story!",1421971200,4,592,4.5
2793173,4,B000OCTRRQ,I think there were alot of lessons in this movie. and it was very interesting,1417219200,,77,4.2
2793174,2,B000OCTRRQ,The acting is atrocious; it's nearly a week later and I still haven't finished this movie...,1415923200,,92,4.8125
2793175,4,B000OCTRRQ,To make a movie about miscegenation (with laws still active in the south at that time) and justice denied (at an even more threatening time for non-white Americans) is so gutsy. A decade later you would see James McEachin on TV and Max Julien on the big screen in barrier-breaking roles. Male-dominated script with few lines for females thrown in. Scene with fearful parishoners inside humble church can probably be recreated today anywhere from Florida to Missouri.,1413936000,,466,5.064935064935065
2793176,2,B000OCTRRQ,Fair,1412380800,,4,4.0
2793177,5,B000OCTRRQ,This movie gave me insight to racism and the struggles African Americans face because of White Supremacy and their need to fight against it. I didn't know it was a black and white movie but it was good nonetheless.,1410393600,5,214,4.512820512820513
2793178,3,B000OCTRRQ,It had great possibility but failed to deliver a thorough story.  I wouldn't recommend it. Technically I would only give it 2 1/2 stars but that option wasn't available.,1409875200,,169,4.827586206896552
2793179,1,B000OCTRRQ,The quality of sound and view are terrible,1409356800,,42,4.375
2793180,3,B000OCTRRQ,"On the one hand, you would like to commend this movie for trying to address a serious subject, even if it's with a heavy dash of exploitation thrown in. I'mm all for a fun revenge tale, and plot-wise this movie throws in a few good twists. But there are a few cringe-worthy moments in this film, and even to get that far you have to be ready to accept the lead actor in his assigned role. It requires some suspension of disbelief, as they say. But I am glad I watched it, since it is an interesting artifact of its time and not half-bad.",1408838400,,537,4.173076923076923
2793181,5,B000OCTRRQ,love it,1405468800,,7,3.0

2793183,3,B000OCTRRQ,"I didn't know that Max Julien aka ""The Mack"", has a role in this movie. The movie has a straight theme,  revenge, which is hard to ignore. A lot of  amateur people waiting to say their lines, but the movie moves to an anticipated climatic moment.",1395100800,5,246,4.326086956521739
2793184,4,B000OCTRRQ,"Poor acting, cheap production values, bad cinematography and all the other wannabe movie critic sounding mumbo jumbo words aside, this is a very fascinating film. It came out in 1966, back when Blacks had to sit in the back of the bus, despite the passing of the Civil Rights Act two years earlier.  I'm shocked that this movie got made, much less released. I'm even more shocked that white people agreed to be in this film. I've developed a new respect for Ted V. Mikels after watching this movie. It took some steel balls to take such a risk. There's no beating around the bush here, its a no holds bar cry against the bigotry and violence by whites toward blacks. They made a big deal about Captain Kirk kissing Uhura, but this is a whole new level. I think this movie makes a more powerful statement then ""Mississippi Burning"". Remember, that film was made when it was safe and trendy to take a stand. This movie could have gotten Mr. Mikels lynched. No matter what you think of the film, you have to give the director and the actors credit for their bravery.",1394323200,11,1063,4.479381443298969
2793185,5,B000OCTRRQ,I have Prime and was able to watch this for free. What can I tell you? I liked it. I guess it's all in what you were expecting.,1394064000,3,127,3.5714285714285716
2793186,4,B000OCTRRQ,I really like the movie and would show the movie as part of black history week. History is something that should represent us.,1393891200,5,126,4.521739130434782
2793187,5,B000OCTRRQ,I rated this movie so high because it was entertaining and somewhat provocative.  To understand this type of treatment at the hands of a fellow human being is mind boggling.,1393372800,,173,4.766666666666667
2793188,5,B000OCTRRQ,"This film from the1950s demonstrated to me how you don't need fancy special effects to create a compelling film.  I like realistic characters and this film had them.  It showed the horror of the klan's activities and showed how most of them probably thought of it as a ""boys night out"".  It also showed the interesting issues around ""passing for white"".  Climatic ending.  Good flick!",1390953600,14,384,4.846153846153846

8184256,3,B000OCTRRQ,How I never heard of this movie I will never understand. I guess being a pre-teen when it came out might have something to do with it. It has a perspective I don't fully agree with but the clear focus on the terror of the klan leaves you cold.,1485734400,,243,3.979591836734694
