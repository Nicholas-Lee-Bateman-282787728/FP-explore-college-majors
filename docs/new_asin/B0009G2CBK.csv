8060165,5,B0009G2CBK,"Overall a good teaching on the form . I've been studying Wing Chun for a while now and for the money it's a good addition to my collection . I think my own Sifu would have agreed with every point he made . Nice and clearly done . The only fault would be maybe just a bit more of the fighting applications , but still... not bad .",1451347200,,329,3.8529411764705883
8060166,5,B0009G2CBK,All I can say if you like Wing Chun get this DVD it's easy to learn and fallow along it takes everyday practice to master these Technic so have fun with it.,1425081600,,156,3.90625
8060167,5,B0009G2CBK,I teach self defense and was looking for a great video collection to teach about Wing Chun because some of it's applications are important to what I teach.  My students enjoy reviewing video demonstrations about what we are learning and this is the perfect collection.  I have purchased the first 6 of this series.  The last 2 videos are for Wing Chun Dummy and it serves no purpose in what I teach.  These videos are of fairly high quality and the instruction is easy to follow and full explanations are given throughout the videos.  Sifu Chow is an awesome instructor as you will see from the videos.  Check him out on youtube prior to purchasing.,1395273600,,649,4.6
8060168,5,B0009G2CBK,"Wing Chun is a close-up combat style that stresses quickness and discipline of motion. It uses low kicks and many defensive moves to let you oppenent unbalance themselves. On this video #4, I think that Sifu Chow has done a very good job explaining the first of the three forms he demonstrates in this video series.

This video explains the kata, the practice of the movements, you must learn when beginning Wing Chun. In my Tae Kwon Do class the instructor said we should proctice the forms 500 times to be proficient. With the instruction provided in this video you should be able to perform this form correctly. I would advise getting this the 4th in series, video number 2 for sticky hand practice and video number 3 on free sparing, all together. The first video on fighting applications is also good but you could wait to get that one, concentrating on first understanding and practicing the forms on videos 2, 3 and 4 together. I highly recommend the series.",1295481600,,965,4.676470588235294
8060169,5,B0009G2CBK,"I was taking Wing Chun kung fu from a local instructor for a while but had to move. Where I moved they had no instructors, so I figured the best thing I could do was order some DVD's to keep my training accurate in as much as possible with a video. I was suprised how informative these dvd's could be.

Pro's:
Each form is covered in great detail from different angles and both slow and fast so you know what to work for, while explaining each move along the way.
After covering the forms in detail, the dvd continues on showing the importance of each move and it's applications with sticky hands freestyle fighting.
You'll break a sweat after following the forms practice. Great exercise.

Con:
Nothing beats real world practice from a qualified instructor.
The video obviously isn't a Dreamworks production. Still you don't miss a thing.

summary:
If you're looking for something to have for study or home practice, this dvd is perfect. If you're new to Wing Chun, you really should have some real world training and use these as training aids. It's the only way to learn sticky hands fighting anyway.
