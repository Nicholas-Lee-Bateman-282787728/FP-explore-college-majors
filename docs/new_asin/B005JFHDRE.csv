4712677,5,B005JFHDRE,Hands down one the of funniest shows on MTV rob dyrdek shines in this show. Along himself is is funny friends and family members which makes it even better.,1329177600,2,156,4.413793103448276
4712678,5,B005JFHDRE,"Season Four was to me, by far the funniest, because the series got further into the Fantasy Factory with different guests and celebrities that added to Rob's already hysterical TV series. Rob Dyrdek is incredibly funny as it is and just the things he does and ideas he comes up with, make this show so damn funny. Not only is he a great professional skateboarder that has his own warehouse or Fantasy Factory filled with a foam pit, complete skate park, basketball hoops, a full recording studio ( which he makes jingles with, being the master of all jingles... And Drama Pfaff who makes beats) and offices for his friends and family members.... He uses everything in the place, every day! By far one of the best shows I've seen in a long time and Rob just makes it funnier and funnier with all the crazy, random, and stupid-funny things he thinks of. But most of all, he finds ways to have fun and also support lots of kids/teens/skateboarders out there, by building skateparks or donating money or even hosting skate events for the population of skateboarders in L.A. But eventually is plans to help out the less fortunate people all over the U.S. . Great show, Rob Dyrdek makes up funny and great skits and even participates in everything, with also getting his whole Fantasy Factory ""family"" to get involved as well. Worth buying ALL 4 seasons and it NEVER gets old.",1327190400,2,1370,4.6419753086419755

8475691,5,B005JFHDRE,This was a Christmas present for daughter she loves Rob Dyrdek. She watches it all the time. Even not she wants the last season.,1390348800,,128,4.375
8475692,4,B005JFHDRE,"This is such a funny and entertaining show. I really like the fact that you never know what they will do next. Rob and the gang are always doing something crazy or funny or exciting. And it's a blast to watch them get crazy and having fun at the same time. The first three seasons are great!!! But it seems like Season 4 is starting to show a slower, less exciting pace. Not as funny and the activities are not as exciting as previous shows. I am hoping that Season 5 is better.",1367798400,,478,4.150537634408602
8475693,1,B005JFHDRE,I paid for an original copy but received burnt a burnt copy. I could have done this myself. I paid for what I thought was a new original copy but I received rewritable discs,1363996800,,173,4.117647058823529
8475694,4,B005JFHDRE,I have all the seasons of Rob and Big as well as Fantasy Factory. This one was chock full of laughs and it had the return of Big Black! I was nervous about it but the DVD-R format looked just fine. There aren't any special features either but I really don't care about those much anymore. Particularily since this season has a couple behind the scenes episodes already.,1358467200,3,369,4.4411764705882355
