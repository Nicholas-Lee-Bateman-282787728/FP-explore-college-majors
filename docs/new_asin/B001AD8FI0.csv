8276871,4,B001AD8FI0,"Rather enjoyed this thriller,esp the antics of the brothers. Glad our heroine got together with the man from Scotland Yard. And what a creepy housekeeper! Glad someone shut the butler up!",1421798400,,187,5.064516129032258
8276872,1,B001AD8FI0,Not interesting enough to keep my attention.,1411430400,,44,5.428571428571429
8276873,5,B001AD8FI0,Very well acted and atmospheric. I love the old mysteries and this is a rarity seldom seen. Great old cast.,1409097600,4,107,4.4
8276874,2,B001AD8FI0,I actually have only one good thing to say. The housekeeper was superb. Everything and everybody else in the movie was awful. Don't waste your time on this one,1362873600,,159,4.517241379310345
8276875,5,B001AD8FI0,I very much enjoyed this old Spooky House Mystery! I love these in general. They are usually allot of fun. This one was especially so because it was British and therefore not bound by the film codes our own films had during the 30's and 40's. Watch for the scene with two brothers in the bathroom. Double entendres and British humor at its best. It is a good print with good sound. A lot of fun!,1360713600,8,395,4.2105263157894735
8276876,3,B001AD8FI0,If you like those old creaky dark house mysteries then this is worth adding to your collection. There are some decent shadowy scenes especially involving the housekeeper and it's a pleasant way to spend a dark stormy night.,1360540800,3,223,4.894736842105263
8276877,2,B001AD8FI0,"This is a film that will appeal to sad people like myself who think that Jessie Matthews would be wonderful reading a telephone directory!  Sadly it is of poor quality in terms of storyline and acting (or should I say over-acting) of most of the cast.  A highly unlikely story but the sort that may have appealed to '30s film audiences and a pleasant change from all the blood and gore and gratuitous violence of the modern
'blockbuster'!  How it can possibly qualify to be released in a series of 'creepy thrillers' is beyond me, and it only had one song from Jessie!

If it is old movies you want, it will keep you going but not leave you fulfilled.",1226448000,3,651,4.4
