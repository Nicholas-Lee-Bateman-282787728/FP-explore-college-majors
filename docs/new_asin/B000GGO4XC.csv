8132018,5,B000GGO4XC,"I'm not sure why, but I have been brace-dsylexic. My body & brain could not grasp it. I spent at last 30hours on a class 5 river watching paddlers brace. A fan of Eric Jacksons, I figured it was worth a watch. It really reinforced things & my braces are better.

Due to injury, I'm a sweep roller. Even though the roll taught was different, the fundamentals are there. Once again, a great reinforcement from the man.",1354579200,,416,4.402597402597403
8132019,5,B000GGO4XC,Eric Jackson and his family are some of the moat talented boaters on the planet. His approach to learning to brace and roll removes the separation of the two skills. Combining them so to speak as parts of one another. It takes you step by step through a process that has helped me greatly.,1332374400,,289,4.37037037037037
8132020,5,B000GGO4XC,"Erik has put together an excellent teaching tool for learning to roll.  I pretty much earned to roll on my own and it took me about 2 years and I practiced every time I went boating.  Eventually, I I learned to brace, roll and scull up pretty much the way Eric taught, but have more of a sweep roll an do not come up on the back deck.

So, I wish I had access to this DVD in the early days of VHS when I learned to roll.  Like others, Erik breaks the roll down to small pieces which can be individually practiced till you can put it all together.  But Eric goes beyond and gives the essence of good instruction and explaines ina manner which is easy to comprehend te little details which show how to always succeed in the little things which build confidence.  He explains that if a student fails any step it destroys confidence and is a significant set back to the learning process  (I experienced that a lot when I was learning).

Lastly, Eric involves his family in th training session makig the training seem like he is right there with you.  Since I alrady know how to roll I can only say that I think this would have been a great help to me if I had access to it when I was learning, and I think it will help others to learn and help instructiors with their teaching style and mechanics.",1331424000,,1293,4.181451612903226
8132021,5,B000GGO4XC,Great instructional video for anyone just getting started or wants to tune-up their rolling skills. Eric Jackson puts it in a very easy to understand format for anyone to learn!,1298419200,,177,4.933333333333334
8132022,5,B000GGO4XC,"If you're trying to learn to roll your kayak, this is a very good video to watch to learn and understand the core concepts.  It breaks the roll down into easy steps, with great explanations and underwater footage to show you exactly what to do.

I have used this video and Jackson's teaching method as an aid to teaching rolling ocean kayaks and am happy to say the technique works!",1288915200,,382,4.442857142857143
8132023,5,B000GGO4XC,"Prior to watching this DVD, I took classes, and only had 1 successful roll, which I simply could not repeat. After watching it, I realized I had neglected proper bracing technique. My classes seemed to brush over it too quickly, and I had never actually done a brace where my head touched the water. Learning the proper brace is really what did it for me. I practiced bracing, and it was surprisingly easy, and that evening on the lake, I did probably 20 rolls, and my record for the night was seven in a row, before I had to swim.

Since then, I've watched it several more times, and have shared it with others. I don't have a hand roll yet, but I've finally got an excellent roll I can rely in, in Class 3 Whitewater (tested countless times in the Lower Blue run out of Green Mountain Resevoir, and at the Golden Playpark).

If you feel like you have room to improve your brace or roll, or simply have to learn it from the ground up, GET THIS DVD. If you're not learning your roll under the guidance of an instructor, it's not your fault!",1284508800,,1040,4.301020408163265
8132024,5,B000GGO4XC,"Before I bought this DVD I had a c-to-c roll of sorts, after a little instruction and a few months in the pool and at the lake. It was not very reliable though so I though I'd get some books and DVDs. EJ's DVD more than paid for itself the first day, I watched it from start to finish, went to the pool and saw immediate results. After about a week my roll was 100% in flat water, a month down the line and I have a bombproof roll both sides and am learning to hand roll.

EJ is a phenomenal paddler and teacher. If you are struggling with an unreliable roll, or want to learn to roll, do yourself a favour and buy this DVD.

Best,

Fraser.",1282348800,,640,3.984375

The only one we will ever buy as he is the best teacher.",1256515200,,89,3.5
8132026,4,B000GGO4XC,"A very entertaining, upbeat, beautifully filmed video that introduces a well thought-off sequence that takes the viewer from a brace to a full roll.

The Goods: the author presents a sequence of four skills that one needs to learn in order to roll.  Each skill builds on the previous one and needs to be committed to muscle memory because you can't think yourself through a roll--you need to act it!  The first step, the brace, is worth the price of this video just by itself because in most cases it will prevent you from capsizing and ever needing a roll in the fist place.  The other three skills build up to a successful roll in any conditions--not just the controlled environment of the pool session.

Explanations are clear and amply illustrated.  I wish there was more replay slow-motion footage as I would have liked to see the actions in more detail.  But, I guess, that's what the modern technology is for and I can slow it down on the computer or the DVD player.

The authors repeatedly points to the work his legs are doing under the hull of the kayak but never really shows how they are supposed to accomplish their purpose.  Out-of-the-boat demonstration of this aspect would enhance this video as it is not necessarily intuitive.

The section on teach a roll is just brilliant!  I learned a lot about the roll itself just by watching that section.  Watch it before you try to teach yourself!

The mental aspect of rolling also receives substantial coverage.  I would not trust any rolling teacher who does not cover this.  Being upside-down under water and trapped in a kayak is supposed to be scary.  If it does not scare you, you probably should not be kayaking.  Learning how to deal with this fear is a critical roadblock that needs to be cleared before you reach your destination--reliable roll.

Missing: the only thing that may be a problem for a number of kayakers is the fact that the roll taught here is a lean-back roll.  There are a number of kayaks on the market that have high aft decks or high back support which will prevent a successful execution of EJ's roll.  I also know a number of kayakers who have bad backs and cannot lean back.  If any of these describe you, you may not be able to roll with techniques shown in this video.  C-to-C or lean-forward rolls would be more appropriate but they are A LOT more difficult to learn and execute that the this lean-back roll.",1224547200,9,2404,4.567757009345795
8132027,5,B000GGO4XC,"By a mistake I got this video instead of Kent Fords rolling video. This video is really fantastic! Eric Jacksons brilliant instructions and very inspiring teaching style makes it fun to watch, together with nice technique demonstrations by EJ himself, his children and Clay Wright. You can build up your skills in a step by step manner and learn to roll in almost any situation. Nice bonus tracs on teaching others to roll and children and white water kayaking.
