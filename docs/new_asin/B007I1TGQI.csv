5087685,4,B007I1TGQI,"The Philadelphia Experiment and Montauk Project are covered here...as well as the Phoenix Project, which I was unaware of.  I can't believe our government let this go as far as it did.  Then again, maybe I can.  At any rate, quality lectures on the subject here.",1353456000,2,262,4.6521739130434785
5087686,4,B007I1TGQI,"These 3 DVDs contain two extensive lectures and a long, casual conversation by Al Bielek (often spelled Beilek), who claims to be a survivor of the Philadelphia Experiment, a purported successful time-travel test that has been covered up ever since.  In the world of unexplained phenomena, The Philadelphia Experiment and its cousins, The Phoenix and Montauk Projects, could be the most fascinating of them all.  Beilek himself is difficult to disbelieve.  He seems like a reluctant witness, with nothing to gain by lying, and he's the last person you'd expect would be delusional.  Then again, what he's saying really rocks our view of reality.  Preston Nichols joins in, explaining the Montauk project, purportedly a method of amplifying psychic thoughts, turning what look like vacuum tube ham radios into sentient beings!  Of course the US government doesn't want us to know they have this capability, but then again, how come we've been bogged down in so many decades-long wars if our military controls time and space?  The third DVD is a comprehensive documentary on the subject--if this is all new to you, start with DVD 3, then go to 1, then skip 2 (unless you're a physicist).  Incredible stuff.",1340496000,8,1204,5.045454545454546
5087687,4,B007I1TGQI,"Science or science fiction? This creepy and fascinating documentary claims that two government experiments, The Philadelphia Experiment and the Montauk Project were later combined into a secret third project known as the Phoenix Project that involved walk-in implantation, time travel, mind control, invisibility, mind machines used to develop and control paranormal powers and torturous other things. Photos, interviews and graphics weave an eerie tale of government recklessness and ruthlessness that is hard to look away from.",1338854400,,529,5.973684210526316

8517088,3,B007I1TGQI,"This film falls short of the drama involved with this event.
Gives very brief intro to the occurrence. This was an experiment
gone wrong. Look on the web for other data.",1437350400,,169,4.483870967741935
8517089,5,B007I1TGQI,"There's a lot of information on these DVD's.
I never get bored watching it,That Good!!!
I'am so glad i have it in my collection.",1389657600,,128,4.375
8517090,4,B007I1TGQI,"ok until they started talking about invisible space aliens.  that was when the story unfolded like a scifi adventure.  lots of info concerning magnetic technology and such, but his paranoia about space aliens ruined the interest.",1389312000,,229,5.333333333333333
8517091,5,B007I1TGQI,"Technical explanation and history of the Philadelphia Experiment.  Some people may not believe it or understand it, those on the level of awareness to understand it will appreciate this video. Not for entertainment purposes.",1386633600,,224,5.588235294117647
8517092,1,B007I1TGQI,"I was in high hopes of a quality video but was greatly disappointed. Years ago I had seen a documentary on this subject and it was very interesting, this however was so poorly done, low budget and if you don't have multiple degrees in Physics you can't follow the point or points they are trying to get across. I have never been so disappointed in anything. I do NOT recommend this video, not even to the die hard enthusiasts, in my opinion it's awful!!!!!!!",1374537600,,458,4.464285714285714
8517093,2,B007I1TGQI,I don't usually have a problem sitting through shows but this one was so bad that I had to turn it off after it was 1/2 way over.  It was totally ridiculous.,1365638400,,157,3.90625
8517094,4,B007I1TGQI,"I was really stoked to get this for my birthday this year. I had a passing knowledge of the Philadelphia experiment so this filled a lot of the holes in my knowledge. Not sure what to believe, but it was a cool ride.",1357776000,,216,4.046511627906977
8517095,2,B007I1TGQI,"This was not what I was expecting. I thought I had ordered a documentary style type video. This was not the case. What I got after I loaded the disc into my DVD player was hours of lecture.  Which would be perfect if I were taking a class and needed material for a paper. The videography is amateur (at best) and the lectures are very...very long.  This video is for hard core fans of government secrets and or cover ups. If your the type of person who just can't get enough detail on this particular subject, this video is perfect.  if you were just looking for some fun, psuedo-documentary video on government secrets or cover ups....keep looking.",1356998400,5,649,4.52991452991453
8517096,1,B007I1TGQI,"Man, when one has a chance to do a good thing and sooooo badly messes it up, what more can I say...",1353974400,,99,3.5454545454545454
