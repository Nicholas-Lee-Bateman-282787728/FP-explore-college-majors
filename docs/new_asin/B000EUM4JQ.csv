8114578,5,B000EUM4JQ,Two movies by one of the most charismatic actors of the silent film era who came to a tragic end. One has to wonder what his film legacy might have been had he lived longer. These are two fun movies for silent action film era fans.,1437696000,,231,4.043478260869565

The Roaring Road (1919) and Excuse My Dust (1920) are a continuous narrative of ""Toodles"" Warren striving to race, and to marry his boss's daughter in spite of the contrariness of the old ""bear,"" who owns the Darco car company and is ever on guard to keep the Fargot company from stealing his motor design.

The first film is lifted from a yellowish soft-image print with bleached-out details, and is over-cropped at the top. The racing sequences of open-air cars are mostly long shots, not revealing the two occupants. The second film offers a somewhat better print, but with an over-cropped left that chops off some titles. Some shooting from a traveling car permits medium shots of the driver and his mechanic. Plot-wise, in film 1 Toodles wins the girl. In film 2 the emphasis is on the dangers of speeding on city streets, and Toodles, now Husband and Father, learns his lesson.

Wallace Reid was super-busy in Hollywood from 1910 to 1923 as actor and occasionally director or writer. Injured during film making, he became a morphine addict and died at 31. At 6'1"" he was narrow of body and face. I felt the camera, though sometimes lingering on girlfriend or father, was reluctant to completely reveal Reid's full frontal face. Could he have an eye that drifts off axis, such as Ronald Coleman and Linda Darnell? Please let me know, biography readers.

The fresh piano score is lively, and includes tunes such as You've Got To Get Out And Get Under, and When That Midnight Choo-choo Leaves for Alabam.

The gallery of stills from Reid's other films (most of which are lost) is a PLUS !",1380412800,5,1789,4.739549839228296

Not exactly subtle or intellectually demanding entertainment, but neither of these films was designed to be. Transport yourself back to a more innocent age (trying to forget that a few years after making 'Excuse my Dust' the star of them both was dead from morphine addiction) and enjoy them for what they are!",1205107200,,401,4.911764705882353
8114581,5,B000EUM4JQ,"Wallace Reid's films are mostly lost now, so it's a treat to see two of them together on one disc. Even better, the films are quite good, and I can certainly see why he was as popular as he was. He projects a masculine, can-do energy like a Douglas Fairbanks, but he also has a certain warmth and charismatic presence that must've made him a special hit with the ladies. The movies themselves are two variations on the same theme, and that theme of cross-country auto racing makes for some fun times as Reid plows through the countryside, dodging trains and getting into car wrecks, but always bouncing back. The musical scores are absolutely top-notch, traditional piano scores that are lively and true to the spirit of the times. The films themselves look far better than I would've expected, and I had no trouble reading the title cards on either of them. The bonus section of photos taken from other Reid films really makes you wistful for the chance to see some of those now-lost movies of his. I'd say that anyone who loves old movies or old cars will find a lot to enjoy with this DVD.",1152057600,4,1092,4.52020202020202
8114582,4,B000EUM4JQ,"Unknown Video has given us some more silent film gems, this time in a nice double feature DVD starring the often overlooked and forgotten Wallace Reid who was a superstar in the late 1910s and early 1920s but sadly, is remembered for his tragic death at age 31 rather than for his work and contribution to the early Hollywood film industry.  His early demise due to alcohol and drugs was a big Hollywood scandal in 1923, but seeing him in these films, you would never suspect that he had any addictive problems.  Apparently he was a reluctant actor; his initial goals being screenwriting and directing, but his good looks, charm and magnetism put him in front of the cameras in dozens of films from as early as 1910 onwards.  This DVD features two of his most popular films in a role and setting which the audience liked him best:  a hot-blooded racing driver in fast-paced, action-packed films with exciting street and car racing scenes.  The first film, ""The Roaring Road"" sees Reid in a power struggle with his equally strong-willed and stubborn boss, not just in matters of racing cars but also for the hand of the boss's daughter.  It is a light-hearted but busy plot which races along like the 1919 speedsters featured in it.  This style of light and fun entertainment was so popular that a sequel was made in the following year, 1920, namely ""Excuse My Dust"".  Now married with a baby son, Reid is still fighting a battle of wills with his father-in-law, but this time an unscrupulous racing car competitor is the main rival.

Wallace Reid had a convincing, powerful and realistic acting style without the pantomime-style gestures and expressions often seen in silent films.  While not giving award-winning performances in these two short feature films, Reid does fit the role perfectly.  Theodore Roberts is equally convincing and entertaining as his boss-come-father-in-law, and I personally always enjoy seeing street scenes with those gorgeous old automobiles from yesteryear.  A very good, traditional piano score accompanies both films, and there is a nice little slide show of stills from other Wallace Reid films as a bonus feature which I also enjoyed.  On the downside, many title cards in the second film, ""Excuse My Dust"" are off centre, chopping off a few letters on the left side and making it a bit annoying and difficult to read.  Apart from a few short segments of slightly blurry or too light scenes, the overall picture quality is very good though, and won't detract from having a good old-fashioned fun ride with the Tom Cruise of the early 1920s!",1147219200,4,2574,4.84703196347032
