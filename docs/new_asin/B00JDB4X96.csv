The so-called skrippers were over the hill vomit bag old, We're talking prison work-release variety.... We're talking a film budget so low the neighborhood's standing in the background while um-actors delivered the lines...",1433030400,,388,5.258064516129032

8649874,1,B00JDB4X96,"This is another gansta thug film which glorifies drug dealing and booty shaking. The film opens with an Interstate dash cam and goes to showing us a gross cellulite factory. Rule of thumb: If your flesh looks like it is stuffed with cottage cheese, cover it up.

Two gangsters are ""gun jacked"" by the Pep Boys. They are investigated by white cops, while other gangsters want to know what happened to their guys. Not much plot. Mostly urban slang talking, difficult to follow. Guns they tote never fire, one was being held underwater in a swimming pool. The violent scenes are never shown, just before and after pictures. Apparently shot at 50/50 Club in Jackson, Mississippi. And if those are the girls that work that place, count me out.

There is a video production near the end that isn't exactly Bollywood. The film creator is talking softly by a car grill while loud music drums him out. Poor quality film making all around. On the plus side (other than the dancers) no actors were harmed in the making of this film, as it doesn't seem any were used.

F-bomb, nudity, lap dancing.",1412380800,2,1085,4.640625
