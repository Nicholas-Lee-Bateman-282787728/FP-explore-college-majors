8680760,1,B00NWFDZNY,"Incredibly bad. It is an hour of your life you'll never get back. The ""history"" of the family doesn't go in linear progression, but jumps from present/past throughout. The music track in the background plays 100% of the time and is very hard to listen to while the narrator is speaking. In fact, the musical track makes this DVD far worse; it's very dark, and so are parts of the film. This was BAD, and barely even touched on the royal family; it was made up of screen shots of London, their homes, and pictures quite a lot.",1430179200,4,525,4.36734693877551
8680761,1,B00NWFDZNY,"Poor quality video, and boring storyline.  The history is correct, but by the end you don't care.",1427760000,3,97,4.705882352941177
