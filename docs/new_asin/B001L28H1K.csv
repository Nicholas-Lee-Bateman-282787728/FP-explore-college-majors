While the setting is a little cliche, the awesome pacing and entertaining plot keep this film from being a bore fest. The acting is good for the most part, and the script was decent enough.

This entry relies on CGI more than the two previous entries, which was unnecessary in my opinion... As the first movie did a great job with creating creepy and memorable death scenes without cheap CGI ruining them. The scenes are not ruined in ""Final"", but they disturb the atmosphere of the film.

Overall, probably my favorite of three. While it doesn't answer many questions and lacks coherence in some aspects, it kept me entertained for the 105 minutes that it lasts.",1481328000,,734,4.674418604651163
