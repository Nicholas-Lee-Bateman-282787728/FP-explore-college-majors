I owe tons of guitar lesson videos, and often get frustrated going over them at one point or another, where the instructor is unable to explain the concepts in plain English or is too advanced to understand that some things obvious to him should be explained to the student.

The guys blended the theory, practice, and humor to achieve superior series that anyone can truly understand. Comparing to other products the quality of the DVD is very professional, and it contains a lot of bonus material (all for the relatively low price).

I wish there was a sixth star ;)

The `Disturbed' fans who want to learn their favorite songs and all those that are into this style of music will marvel at the content of this DVD. The martial is presented in an easy and concise way, and  my favorite part is the explanation of the alternate tuning used by' Disturbed' and other `modern' metal bands. The DVD will make you play the four songs in no time...enjoy!",1155254400,,1119,4.575
