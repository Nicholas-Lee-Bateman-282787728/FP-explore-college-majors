6403362,5,B00K6D20L8,"Nice box. A bit overpriced for what it is ... but good for a collector of things that are Peter Gabriel. I also wanted to let everyone know that this is in fact the Blu-ray version of the collectors edition so don't be scared by the description that is wrong stating that the format is DVD.

There is another collectors edition for about $10 less that is clearly labeled as 2- DVD/2-CD so if that is the version you want, then that is the one you should order....",1403481600,21,463,4.261363636363637
6403363,5,B00K6D20L8,"The Blu-Ray Deluxe version comes as a 5.5 x 7.5"" hard cover book. The two blu-ray discs are in sleeves just inside the front cover, the two CDs are just inside the back cover. The book is a good quality binding, with pictures from the show, a short introduction, little snippets of ideas from PG, and a full cast and crew credit list. Nothing really special, but a nice addition.  My only small complaint here is that the discs are very tight in the sleeves, they won't slide out when you don't want them to, but they also take a bit more disc touching than I normally like in order to remove them.

The real star is the concert disc. Wow. Just Wow. This is the concert straight through, the whole thing. The band is strong and Peter's voice is still impressive with very little of the loss of range seen as singers age.

The picture quality is stunning. The depth and color feels so real. I've only seen the blu-ray but I imagine that even the DVD is pretty amazing. The sound is phenomenal as well. I was at the Chicago show, front row, and I can tell you that the quality here just brings me chills with how much it feels like you are right there. Trust me; this is an amazing concert reproduction. If you missed the tour live you can experience it now. I will be interested in seeing what others think when seeing this but I just cannot properly express just how impressive the picture and sound are.

The filming/editing is interesting in that each song has a unique feel; from the peaceful, laid back blue colored pace of ""In Your Eyes"", the fun, audience involved ""Solsbury Hill"", to the crazed, frenetic pacing of ""The Tower That Ate People."" The editing and video jumps take their queue from the music and keep pace.  The result is a concert film that really catches and holds you. Great job by Hamish Hamilton.

Secret World has long been the benchmark concert film for Peter Gabriel fans. Back to Front is better.

Watching the concert in Blu-Ray brought back great memories.  The sound quality of the CD is exceptional, as if Mr. Gabriel would stand for anything less.",1409702400,,291,4.5576923076923075
6403385,5,B00K6D20L8,"While the Blu-ray is awesome, I also was disappointed to find out the 24 bit Audio Download Had already been redeemed, once I got to the website to redeem.  Something Hankie going on here???  I ordered July 20th. Got the Set in a reasonable time, but as soon as I tried to download, I got continuous Errors from Bowers & Wilkinson, so I just assumed it was cause I was on a linux machine trying to download.
Waited till I got to a Windows machine and now it tells me the Code has already been redeemed. I call BS.  I did get an error code like ""Reference: 20835"" or something like that from B&W, but it's bunk as far as I'm concerned.
Update 9-1-14 After contacting B&W, they made the download available.  5 Stars all the way round, now.",1409270400,,737,4.280575539568345

6403387,5,B00K6D20L8,"I loved the performance.
Hated the fact I couldn't get the free 24-bit Audio download because ""your code has already been redeemed.""  WTF!!
I opened up the package right after it arrived, waited a few days and read the extra included back cover slip that you get with the Bonus version of this Blue-Ray product and noticed this Extra download was available.  Hi-Def 24-bit download.  Use the special code on back of this special insert.  Go to web site - ""My"" code is already redeemed.  Epic Fail.  No way to get compensated for this.

Don't know if it is lax security at RealWorld (PG's production company) or Amazon.  But I got screwed!  Beware!!

Well, I'm back to upgrade my Review from 1 Star to 5 Stars! Reason being I got such a rapid and thoroughly rewarding response from Bowers & Wilkins, the company that managed the production and download of the 28-bit digital version of Back to Front for those buyers of the Deluxe Limited Edition that I purchased. I sent a kind of pissy email to them thinking nothing would happen - then amazingly I heard back from a Liz Tempest (ltempest@bwgrouplondon.com) in < 24 hrs who was nice as could be and steered me to a free digital download site at Bowers & Wilkins so that I could get the bonus digital versions of B2F in full 28-bit glory and achieve full restitution. The files you download are FLAC files (a free, open-source format for large 28-bit music files that will soon be made even more popular when Neil Young's version of 28-bit digital music, called Pono, makes it's debut in a couple months). These FLAC files are NOT playable natively on an iPod or iPhone but there are software apps available that can play them on these devices (just search App Store). These files sound great, like you're listening to the original CD. The quality is great since PG made sure the quality on this recording is incredible.
So, small hiccup but eventually got the product I wanted/expected. Worth the money & the effort. Contact Liz if you end up in similar difficulties with your download.",1408752000,5,2037,4.649025069637883
6403388,5,B00K6D20L8,"The picture and sound are both stellar.  Great seeing the original ""So"" touring band playing again.  Originally filmed in 4K this is a wonderful addition for any Peter Gabriel fan

I have only listened to the audio portion, and look forward to seeing the Blu-ray shows. I have been following P.G.'s career since (and before) he exited Genesis. If you are a true fan who wants to see and hear his greatness, get this set w/hardbound book. A must for all collectors!",1484265600,,439,4.569620253164557
8656223,5,B00K6D20L8,"Great concert filmed in 4k, super quality. Peter Gabriel never stops amazing me with his versatility and particular voice, taking into account that at his age, he still sings his repertoire in original keys. I just can't wait to hear his new original work.",1449446400,,256,4.840909090909091
8656224,5,B00K6D20L8,"I recently purchased this concert video being a lifelong P. G. fan. This concert is fantastic in almost every way but I have one complaint. There is a distinct lack of definition in the bass player's part most noticeable when he used sticks attached to his two right fingers. Levin has used this method effect in the past, and it has produced acceptable results on earlier P. G. concerts. However, whenever he uses these sticks to play his part in the Back to Front concert the bass is often almost absent and/or indistinct. I am a lifelong bass player, performer and recording artist having spent alot of time in the studio so those are my credentials. This distinction of the bottom end is noticeable probably more so because the rest of the performance is so flawless, the performances are great and the audio quality is just amazing. Hate to criticize but it seems that this one aspect slips by the attention of those mixing the sound. Or it could be that this effect isn't as great as T. Levin believes it to  be. I respect his work from King Crimson and P. G. but he might want to reassess this right hand technique. We are never too old to relearn. Thanks.

8656229,5,B00K6D20L8,"Have been a Gabriel fan for 40+ years and never find him less than interesting. Got this as a gift to myself for my sixtieth birthday and watched it on my girlfriends UHD 4k TV.  I have the New Blood Blu-Ray and enjoyed that very much but was anxious to see PG back in a band setting, having only seen him one time live in that context (some guys named Collins, Hackett, etc with him).  I plan on back-filling some of his earlier DVD releases although I realize I've probably already seen the best in terms of picture quality with the two shows I have.  Anyway, I didn't find the opener to be the train wreck some have described and will likely sit thru it in future viewings.  Song choice was excellent, and all members of the band are stellar musicians as you would imagine in a production of this magnitude.  Any quibbles are due to my own idiosyncrasies and not worth mentioning.  Good show all around.",1411430400,2,906,4.395209580838324
