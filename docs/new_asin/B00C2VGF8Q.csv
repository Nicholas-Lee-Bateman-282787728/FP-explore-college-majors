5689366,1,B00C2VGF8Q,"I have a rather large collection of belly dance DVDs and I purchased this one to add to that collection.  After watching it, I would strongly recommend you look at other beginning DVDs to learn belly dance. I was concerned when Mayte did not take time to discuss proper posture and instead introduced us to the 4 elements or Air, Water, etc.  I was even more concerned when she began teaching a move she called a hip circle and had people using the torso to create a circle.  Traditionally, the hip circle uses the hips to form a circle and not your torso.  I was not really impressed with any of this DVD.  If you are a beginner and want to learn using DVDs, you would be better investing in other beginning DVD's.  Please do not invest in this one as you will not be learning to do the moves correctly.",1376697600,9,804,4.291390728476821

8576824,2,B00C2VGF8Q,"Graphics are awful.. the amount of time you have to wait for the actual ""Play DVD"" screen to come up is so novice level.. The dances are very good but the tutorial vs the actual dances she does at the end of each part of the video are not even comparable. What she teaches is level 1-3 and what she does is like level 10.. SMH",1480032000,2,326,3.9545454545454546

8576827,5,B00C2VGF8Q,I am a Prince fan & love Mayte & her dancing (Prince's ex wife). Her video is so much fun & does get your belly in shape!! Rock on beautiful Mayte!!  :0),1413936000,7,153,3.78125
8576828,3,B00C2VGF8Q,"This is a very nice basic Belly Dance video. It's not as good as Leila of Cario's DVD or Amira's DVD, but I look at it as a nice easy belly dance workout. Mayte is fun to watch and is so sweet. It's a very short DVD only about 60 mins. so it's good for a quick workout. One thing I really like about this is that it has three routines with instruction which many other Belly Dance DVD's don't have. My only problem with it is that it doesn't seem like real authentic Belly Dancing, like I said before this is more of a light workout than Belly Dance but it's still pretty fun to follow! I would recommend it.",1406160000,6,608,4.033057851239669
8576829,5,B00C2VGF8Q,"My husband would not tell me what he wanted for his birthday, so with a click of a button and a little practice and a nice little outfit from Bellydance.com I did two routines for him off this DVD.  I have say that before Mayte I was a belly dancing class drop out.  I could never follow the steps and felt frustrated because I never felt the satisfaction of putting everything I learned together in a routine.  Mayte's DVD I found very well structured and paced and a lot of fun! I did the Sensual and the Dynamic Routine for my husband.  His jaw dropped...""Where did you learn to do that?!"" was his response.  I was relieved....birthday gift a success!

There are three routines on this DVD: Sensual, Essential, and Dynamic.  Each routine is broken down into sections.  For example, the Sensual routine has about 5 movements which are broken down individually and are taught one by one slowly and with repetition.  Then, the next section is the routine where the moves are put altogether slowly and are repeated 2-3xs.  Then, there is the real time performance by Mayte which has all her lovely embellishments which are something to admire.  You can also practice right along with her.  The format is easy to rewind, or repeat as necessary which you would not be able to do in a live class.  With this format, you can truly learn at your own pace.

The Three Routines have various moves:

Sensual Routine: Hip Circles, Figure 8's, Undulations, Camel Walk (which are combined to be a backwards camel walk), and corkscrew.  These are very sensual and are meant to be done slowly, but can also be fun when speeded up.

Essential Routine: Hip Drop, Hip Lift & Drop, Horizontal Shimmy, Hip Shimmy, Sea Saw Hip Drops.  I found this to be the most challenging with all the hip lifting and dropping.  It requires quite a bit of coordination, but something to work up to.

Dynamic Routine: Show Me Off, Hip Accent, Step Over, Hop Jump, Twister.  This is a fun energetic routine with a lot of movement and jumping.  This is the most aerobic routine of the three.

The music is also quite delightful.  I ended up downloading the soundtrack for my routine performance.  The songs that are featured are Mystic Caravan (Sensual Routine), Shuruk (Essential Routine), and Late Night in Hamra (Dynamic Routine).  These are all great songs to listen to even when you are not practicing.

It was a ""win win"".  My husband had a great memory for his birthday, and I got a nice aerobic exercise while putting a smile on his face.  I can definitely see popping this DVD in for a little fun exercise.  I hope Mayte comes out with another one soon!",1404086400,5,2625,4.594827586206897
