8160462,3,B000LA4BS6,"Frame of reference :
-I am in my second trimester of pregnancy.
-I might be overly critical because I am an E-RYT 200/RYT 500 yoga instructor, but that said....

PROS :
-The models show you different variations for different points in pregnancy, which is helpful.  This video could be used all pregnancy long.
-Good length (40 min. practice)
-The difficulty level of the video is pretty middle-of-the-road.  I think almost anyone could use this, especially with the variations shown.
-Music isn't bad or overly loud.

CONS :
-I cannot handle the instructor's ""yoga voice"".  This is by far one of my biggest pet peeves about yoga instructors : way too many don't  speak in a regular voice!  They elooooooongate every voooooowel, trying to make themselves sound peeeeeaaaaceful....  But really, all they end up doing is making themselves sound silly, fake and irritating.  None of the best American instructors out there (Baron Baptiste, Seane Corn, David Swenson, etc.) speak with a fake ""calming"" voice.  They are who they are when they teach, and they use their own voice, which is powerful.  I think it tends to be new instructors who aren't yet comfortable with their own abilities who use the fake voice, but either way, it has to go.
-The fact that the instructor constantly says ""Go ahead and"" is grating.  It makes her sound a. like a drinking game (""Drink every time she says 'Go ahead and'!"") and b. makes me constantly think of Office Space (""Peter, I'm going to need you to go ahead and come in on Saturday...."")",1466899200,,1523,4.815384615384615

I actually think I prefer it to going to my regular yoga class, of course it's certainly more convenient! I feel stronger and cleansed after this. If you're looking for a relaxing form of exercise that also soothes the mind, this is for you!",1351209600,,329,4.409836065573771
