6124199,5,B00GYHDVWM,"Great work out, I'm new to yoga but the beginning, first workout,  pushed me but I was still able to walk the next day.  As I'm still learning, this is a great intro for me and I recommend this to anyone just beginning or getting back into yoga.  The next part pushed me more and I felt the difference right away and the delivery was uplifting.  Enjoy and blessings.",1402963200,6,366,4.260869565217392
6124200,5,B00GYHDVWM,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this video, but I really enjoyed the combination of exercise and focusing your mind on truths from the Bible.  Throughout the exercise, the instructor would repeat a truth from scripture.  Even after the workout I found myself coming back to those ideas during the day.  The video isn't in-your-face so I would even recommend it to people who aren't religious.

The only other yoga I've done is P90X and this isn't as intense.  I would probably do it as a lighter workout during the week or anytime I want to refocus my thoughts!",1402358400,6,563,4.59
6124201,5,B00GYHDVWM,"I really appreciate how Sarah shows you different versions of poses. She makes a lunge so easy! I like that she reminds me to hold my abs in and breathe. I also learned a new Bible verse, Matthew 11:28 ""Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.""  NIV",1396137600,19,282,4.035714285714286
6124202,5,B00GYHDVWM,"I just tried this for the first time. There were 15 minute, 30 minute and 45 minute options. I did the 30 minute option and am excited to try the 45 minute one next time. (I think it's great that there's a quick 15 minute one in case you're too busy for the longer sessions.)

I have to admit, I was a little nervous to try this DVD because I am a total yoga beginner, but it was great for all levels of yoga experience. The instructor would explain the move and show you how to do it and then she would give you ways to dial it back if you couldn't do it. She also provided tips on what to make sure you were focused on while doing the move, which I found very helpful. This made it great for a beginner like me, and would make me totally comfortable giving it to my Mom to use (because she has a disability so a lot of times she doesn't want to try things like this). It's also great because it shows me where I could go with my yoga if I worked at it more and got more flexible. I think I'll be using this for a long time to come!

It starts and ends with a bible reading, and uses religion of the passage while you are doing the different positions to really make you reflect on God's Word while doing your yoga.

I would definitely recommend this to friends and family - it's relaxing, Christ-centered, you can do it in the privacy of your own home, and it's a lot cheaper than yoga classes!",1394496000,35,1396,4.0324909747292415

6124204,5,B00GYHDVWM,"I've tried a few of the ""Christian"" yoga DVDs and, in my opinion, this one is by far that best. The DVD is divided into 3 different workouts: a 15 min, a 30 min and a 45 min workout. None of them are what I would label as advanced (I'm definitely NOT a flexible person or in that great of shape right now, and I can do everything pretty well). I would label it beginner/intermediate. Let me also state, I would not qualify this as an actual ""workout"" in the traditional sense. While it does have stretching and core exercises, you won't end this in a huge sweat, but you will end this workout feeling much more at ease. Sarah is great at pacing things well so it's not too slow but you also have enough time to get into all the positions. She's a great instructor. Each section starts with a different scripture and each section has a different prayer/mantra that Sarah prompts you to say while you are doing each exercise. She also starts and ends each session with a prayer. Overall, I find this to be great for someone who is wanting to focus their mind of Christ instead of just ""emptying their minds of all thoughts and allowing the healing breaths to flow through your toes"" malarkey that is in the rest of the yoga workouts. I really look forward to trying out her other workouts.",1450137600,23,1287,4.366666666666666

6124208,3,B00GYHDVWM,"I really wanted to like this and I do (like it) for relaxation but it's not a workout. I was hoping to get into sun-saluatation type poses without all the ""yogi gaze"" stuff. It's really just low key stretching. That said, it is great for relaxation and a different type of devotional.",1444953600,6,284,4.480769230769231

6124210,5,B00GYHDVWM,"I love this DVD! I was a yoga beginner and was very intimidated, but this DVD has got me hooked. I like the different sections (15 min, 30 min, 45 min) and the instructor is really clear and ""approachable.""  None of the workouts on this video make me break a sweat, but they do help me center, stretch, slowly build muscle, and release tension. To me that's even better than breaking a sweat. I've already noticed an improvement in flexibility.

And most importantly, I love the Christian tone to this DVD. Each section starts out with the instructor reading a portion of scripture and then a prayer is repeated throughout the yoga session. I've enjoyed that quite a bit.

I look forward to trying the other Atoning Yoga DVDs.",1439596800,4,726,4.612403100775194

6124216,5,B00GYHDVWM,I have struggled to participate in yoga in the past because of the eastern religion element.  I enjoyed being able to learn some beginner yoga through this video and be lead through Jesus-oriented meditation.  Easy to follow and a good option for at home exercise.  Helped me relax and refocus.,1424649600,7,294,4.84

It is the perfect stretching, toning and meditating on God's Word video:) Love how gentle it is to the novice beginner and I can see how relaxing this would be for someone who is used to stretching in these ways. It is a great effort for me right now but I look forward to continuing with this until it is more relaxing and less work...:) Will be ordering her other video as well!",1423440000,7,430,4.2560975609756095

6124221,5,B00GYHDVWM,"Atoning Yoga does it again with ""Releasing Control."" In this DVD, you will learn how to exchange your worries for God's rest.  Most people store their tension in their neck and shoulders, hips and thighs or both.  Many turn to aggressive physical activity for relief. But the Bible says if you are weary or burdened to come to God.  It is in him we find rest.  (Matthew 11:28)  By patiently allowing the key verse, prayer and postures (""asanas"") to holistically work together through micro-movements, you will find the perfect, integrated mind, body and spirit approach to wellness.  Through a systematic upper body, lower body and core progression, you'll see how stress is one big ""chiasm"" (crossing/overlap) taking full advantage of your body.  But when Christ becomes your Core, you progress from exhaling worries and breathing in rest to inhaling his strength and confidently living in peace.  Your shoulder blades, throat, neck and base of your skull will thank you, and you will open up tight hips and build a solid core to integrate them.  You'll be ready to start and end your day in peace, because you're learning to listen to God daily instead of allowing your body to carry all your tension.  Releasing Control is for everyone, for In stillness all conflict must end. ~ Phillip Urso  - Caren Hoehn",1403654400,30,1309,4.877828054298643

It gets me moving and stretching in all the right places so I feel great and in much less pain when I do this first thing in the morning. I love the incorporation of the scripture and prayers throughout, the focus being on God to help release worry and control. This video has 3 workouts, 15 min, 30 min and 45 min.
