8591716,5,B00DCDAS68,"This TV mini-series (made in Spain with English subtitles) is a very well-done accurate bio-pic of St. Teresa of Avila. Actress Concha Velasco does a very good job portraying Teresa's astute forthright manner, charisma, dry sense of humor, and spiritual metamorphosis from mediocre lukewarm Carmelite nun to a reformer who founds a new order of Carmelites throughout Spain who follow a much stricter rule. I was particularly impressed with the film's depiction of her vision of Hell which corresponds to the description in her autobiography. The film was realistic and did justice to presenting the everyday trials and tribulations of this fascinating Spanish mystic who lived during the 1500's. The film gave me a better understanding and appreciation of this saint, the significance of her accomplishments as well as her intelligence, courage, people skills, writing abilities, spiritual formation, humanity. I am so glad I watched all 450 minutes of this DVD set. It made me want to learn more about St. Teresa and read her books. The set was a very good buy and is the same as another more expensive set that has a different cover. If you collect films about saints, you will want this gem as a keeper in your collection.",1397692800,5,1225,5.009803921568627
