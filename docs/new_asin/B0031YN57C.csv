8593047,5,B0031YN57C,This write up covers all the dvds that I purchased on loch ness and other creatures.  I have always been fascinated by dinosaurs and other creatures and I still believe that plesiosaurs still inhabit Loch Ness or offsprings from the oringinal monster. Anything  is possible. I am also a big Godzilla fan. all the dvds are excellent (awesome). If anybody enjoys and likes to learn about this topic please add these dvds to your library.,1279411200,,435,4.786666666666667
