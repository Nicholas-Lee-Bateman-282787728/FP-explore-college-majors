She is the best, period.  It usually takes us 2 and a half hours to get through one viewing of her DVD  because we have to stop and rewind just to hear what we missed because we are laughing so hard,or just to replay a spot that is so incredibly funny.  You just want to be friends with her because she would be so much fun to hang with.  Margaret , we love you and you ROCK.  Please keep us laughing for years to come.",1047081600,,593,3.8595041322314048
7945713,5,B00005ML8S,"As an Asian-American I only wish that there were more Margaret Chos out there, female and male...such a powerful counterpoint to the ""Model Minority"" stereotype of Asians as submissive and faceless conformists and techno/corporate coolies.
There's no doubt about it: this lady is hilarious, her facial expressions are just comedic gold, her graphic humor and acerbic wit devastating.  In a nutshell, she has verve, and she has COJONES!  Her jokes revolve around sex, admiration of gay men, racism and sexism...it's mostly the second that distinguishes her from most comics, who still tend to lean towards the homophobic side.
Towards the end there is a bit of a confessional that flirts with self-pity and then syrupy self-help, but that's a small thing compared to the rest of this side-splitting movie.  I'm ordering a copy for my very ""proper"" sister, who more closely fits the impeccable Yuppy suburbanite Asian stereotype...will relish watching it again with her, to see all the squiriming but also the shocked laughter.",1039910400,9,1025,5.237804878048781
7945714,5,B00005ML8S,"Comedian Margaret Cho brings SF Bay Area culture to the masses, giving bawdy, multiculti pansexualism a very funny, and very recognizable voice. Cho delves deep into the depressing details of her brush with mainstream fame, when the ABC television network cast her as The Star Of The First Asian-American Female Sitcom... and then proceeded to tear apart at the very identity it found so compelling. Meanwhile, she gets in all sorts of brilliant observations about Korean-American identity and the joys of being a big ole fruit fly. She's hella funny and very, very Bay Area.",1039564800,,575,5.063157894736842
7945715,5,B00005ML8S,"I had never seen any of Margaret Cho's work before, so I didn't know what to expect aside from what I read on the reviews.
She is different from other stand-up comics that I have seen. She talked a lot about not only the funny things that have happened in her life, but the serious things too. (Once in a while, it actually looks like she might cry) Someone once said, ""Comics are the most unhappy people on earth."" (or something to that effect.) Well, I don't know how true that is, but I do know that I really appreciated the fact that she could share bits of her life that were less than humorous.
She talked about how the network made her lose so much weight (30 pounds in 2 weeks) that her kidneys just collapsed during rehearsal. She talked about how she didn't ""get it"" and that it took her a while to realize that she was ok just the way she was. (I was almost brought to tears on a couple of occasions.)
On a lighter note, her stuff was hilarious! I loved when she said she slept with a woman on the gay cruise she was working on. Then, she thought to herself, ""Am I gay? Am I straight? Then, i realized: I'm just slutty!!!"" Also, a lot of her routine features her imitating her Korean born mother. I was rolling watching her facial expressions! At the very end, when she walks off the stage, I almost stopped it, cause I thought that it was over. But, she comes back for an encore, so don't stop the tape! This, in my opinion, is probably the best part! Her parents used to own a bookstore in San Francisco, and her mother discusses the gay porn with her daughter...
Oh, if you haven't already guessed, she talks a lot about gay people in her jokes. Don't watch if you would be offended.
I recommend this to all who love watching great comics!",1035072000,2,1753,4.251497005988024
7945716,5,B00005ML8S,"Like most Americans, I never heard of Margaret Cho until her ill-starred sitcom appeared in 1996.  I remember at the time thinking that she herself was funny, but that the show, featuring the first Asian-American family on network, thought it could just coast by on being Korean.  Wrong answer.  I was sorry, but not surprised, when the show disappeared from the face of the earth.
Now we know why.  This concert, more a one-woman show than a stand-up routine, details her relationship with her immigrant mother, the men she's loved, and her ""fag-hag"" history before spending the bulk of its time on how she got her show, how it went, and how and why it failed.
The content is blue in the extreme, and she's frank about her sexual experience.  She doesn't dilly-dally or waste your time in telling you what she thinks you need to know, but she takes her time in telling the story the way she wants to tell it.  If that means taking ten minutes aside to make fun of her immigrant mother, you just have to wait.  But don't worry, you'll be amused in the meantime.
Cho exposes the brutality of the entertainment industry and how it chewed her up as grist for the mill, yet instead of feeling sorry for her at the end, you cheer her perseverance.  She's a hero for the media age, someone who's better off having left than being trapped in the system.  More than just a funny person, she's a post-modern Frank McCourt, using her life story to reveal to us how we can refuse to participate and still come out alive in the end.
Margaret Cho someone we can all admire.  Oh, and she's funny as hell, too.",1031702400,7,1595,4.468965517241379
7945717,5,B00005ML8S,"First of all, anyone who doesn't like, nay love the Notorious C.H.O is a little too ""Tree in the Wind"" for me. I liked this movie alot, because while being really funning Cho also weaves in tidbits of her personal T&T (trials and trubulations. She'll make you laugh, she'll make you cry...She'll make you wanna scream and kick and go a 'lil bonkerz. But hey, thats OK, this is america. Free Country. I've seen Margaret live 3 times now, and she's really nice in person too. Shy, even. I don't know why I'm telling you this, I just want to flaunt my knowledge of the Cho. Flaunt,flaunt. There, I feel better now.
btw, does anyone know what Flaun is? I'm at a loss.",1016582400,,663,4.3983739837398375
7945718,5,B00005ML8S,"I've always loved Margaret Cho, and was really looking forward to watching this.  I wasn't disappointed.  She's both frank and funny in this video...I really loved her honesty about a lot of the negative things she had been through.
Her material in the video combines a lot of new stuff, with some of her classic old stuff (her mom's answering machine messages).
I'm glad that Margaret is back, she's beautiful, funny, and as good as ever!",1016150400,,439,4.7631578947368425
7945719,5,B00005ML8S,"Let me just say that this DVD is very, very funny (and very sad at times). I love the ""Behind The Scenes"" Commentary Feature that comes with the DVD.

I know that off-stage Margaret isn't ""funny"" 24/7 and that's okay, because who is? If you like insightful comedy that has more to offer than a few laughs, then this film is ""the one"".

All The Best Margaret!  : )",1007424000,,363,4.231884057971015
