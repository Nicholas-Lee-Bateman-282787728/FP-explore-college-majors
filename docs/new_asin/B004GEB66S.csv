8428656,4,B004GEB66S,"I have to admit to collecting Disney videos from their animated classic, Disney Parks and select live action films. Most of the Disney Parks videos are more like informercials, but this collection including four individual releases for each park, plus one on their Disney Cruise Line is pretty good as an overview of the park illustrated on the cover. This one for Disney Cruise Line runs approx. 30 minutes give or take and has several options to make the experience more enjoyable and gives some replay value.

You can watch the video, or add the Trivia Track which adds fun facts in text at the bottom go the screen. Another option is Disney Details where you can click on the Mickey icon to bring up stills and short video footage of different events and old footage from WDW. There is also so short video footage of first person ride throughs on some of the more popular rides.

The menu is a bit tedious with no play all feature, but it isn't too irritating to navigate. You can probably spend an hour an a half viewing all that is here and it is certainly better than the informercial style DVD's out there. The video quality could be better, but it is improved on over the older version released under the title Happiest Celebration On Earth DVD collection. It's the same exact video series with very minimal material added to this newer set. Please note that the Disney Cruise Line Video wasn't part of the older series and is new to this set. This collection is entertaining for what it is and if you can find them at a reasonable price it's worth it for Disney collectors. One more note this was released in a 5 disc box set under the title When Dreams Come True. This newer set is the better of the two sets, but it really has very little new added to it.",1405728000,,1767,4.450617283950617
8428657,3,B004GEB66S,"I went on a Disney Cruise last year (on the Fantasy) and recently saw a DVD on the Disney Cruise line that included the new larger ships.  When I ordered this DVD, I hoped it was an updated one like what I saw on Destination America earlier this month.  Although the video is good, it only mentions the new ships for a few seconds and since it was made before the ships were built, there are no pictures of the actual ships.  I was very disappointed!  Be advised this is NOT a good DVD for those wanting to know about the entire Disney current cruise ships.",1368144000,,557,4.226415094339623
