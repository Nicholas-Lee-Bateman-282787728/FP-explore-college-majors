7932004,5,B000056HU1,"The video is an excellent training tool on dealing with knife attacks. It is almost 20 years old, but the techniques are street-proven.
The video arrived in very good condition and plays perfectly. A great value for the price.",1271203200,,226,4.82051282051282
7932005,5,B000056HU1,"Marc MacYoung here presents the basics of avoiding getting cut when someone pulls a knife on you.  None of the usual nonsense about disarming your attacker.  MacYoung demonstrates ways to get out of the path of the knife and then RUN.  I like this approach.  It jibes with my own experience and what intelligent thinking will tell you  if you think about the knife outside a gym setting.  I have watched well thought of experts demonstrating knife disarms and, almost always, I've seen them doing things that would get them badly cut if the knife had been real. MacYoung realizes this.

I have no idea if he would want to be put in the same sentence as Paul Vunak, but their approach is the same.  ""Why on earth would you want me to teach you knife disarms...they can't be done.""

Besides good information and techniques, MacYoung has a quality that makes him almost unique amoung self defense instructors...a sense of humor!  He is really funny...even my wife, who has NO interest in self defense, finds his videos viewable.  This is really the first half of a set of videos, the second is Winning a Street Knife Fight...equally good.",1196726400,,1135,4.681818181818182
