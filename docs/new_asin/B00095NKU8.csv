8217834,3,B00095NKU8,"This dude is basically the Canadian version of John Cassavetes. He's quite competent with what he does. The only problem with that is that there's a John Cassavetes already, just south of that border, who is MUCH BETTER than competent. I mean, this is no Shadows, but there's not much I can say is terrible about it. The acting is good, the cinematography is at times expressive and well laid out, at others boring and does nothing. The writing is realistic and sharp for the most part; while none of the jokes will really make you laugh, there are heartwarming moments. The characters have more depth and the overall storytelling is more intelligent than average-fare, but it's not intelligent or deep enough. While absolutely nothing about this film is bad, there's very little that's exceptional in any way, though.",1294272000,,818,4.892086330935252
