2510868,2,B000E991HA,"The movie has a very inconsistent story, it seems that they didn't consult with any futurists to create something remotely credible. The special effects are very unimpressive, it doesn't show anything worth mentioning.",1133481600,5,218,5.636363636363637
2510869,1,B000E991HA,"I am not a liberal, at least I don't think I am, but on some issues I am forced, reluctantly to side with the Christian right, like Hollywood.  It's not that I object to sex and violence, not at all, it's that I think that Hollywood has lost touch, in fact after viewing Aeon Flux I am doubtful they ever had a clue, who was this film aimed at?  Why was a considerable amount of money spent on this incredibly ill-conceived hodgepodge of boring action sequences, absurd psychobabble and endless camera pans leading nowhere, I scarcely know where to begin, what a lame, disappointing mess.  If you saw the previews you have no reason to waste 80+ minutes of your life watching Charlese Theron embarrass herself with stupid green screen stunts, example:  in the future, 2425 or something, our hero and some other girl whose hands have been transplanted to her feet (don't ask) decide to ""sneak"" into future city by running across a field and jumping over the wall, sounds clever, but the city planners decide to defend against such attacks by having some weird pineapple looking things shoot darts at them, note to would be city invaders, learn gymnastics, they help a lot in cases of massive pineapple dart attacks.  You see when said darts start flying, one just needs to do a lot of handsprings and crawl along real fast, then, somehow, you won't be hit.  Oh yeah and one should be sure to climb in the tree and point the shooting darts fruit at the other shooting dart fruit thereby getting the pineapples to shoot each other, just don't step on the grass that shoots up knife blades.  This is a boring retread of every ""break into the bad guys secret hiding place"" ever shot. This was a cult animated show that went off the air years ago for a reason, honest to God they should have had Charlese Theron playing Daria , I would have liked that a lot better.  As I entered the theater I saw a huge pile of posters sitting on the counter, I guess the theater personnel were hoping people would take them, they were free.  Really nice, high quality posters, the big ones, rich color, Charlene the hottie in her little Aeon Flux outfit.  I considered taking one on the way out....then I put it back.  I did not want to be the only one who took one, I have no doubt they are all still there, they should have left the film sitting out, but I doubt anyone would want that either.",1133481600,12,2375,4.46189376443418
2510870,3,B000E991HA,"This modernistic movie was based on the animated MTV series and a video game about an emotionless female assassin.  In 2011, life on earth was eradicated by some explosive device and the surviving group formed the perfect society called Bregna, ruled over by the Goodchild regime.  The dessident organization out to defeat this was a group who dressed in funky black clothes and used gymnastics and acrobatics to get around the security systems.

Charlize Theron who won an Oscar for playing a real-life 'Monster,' now with a figure like Cyd Charisse, leads the way to the doom of the Goodchilds.  She feels like she is in a gilded cage but has dreams of memories she does not understand.  She said that she had a life once, but now all she has is a mission.  We must show the way.  She agrees to go to the Citadel where they will have their revenge and we will all have victory.  There, in the forum, she confronts Trevor, played by Marton Csokas, and acts like a female John Wilkes Booth until he calls her Catherine which rings a bell.  Nothing is as it seems.

Be careful what you wish for!  Trevor showed her what it felt like to be a person instead of an unfeeling thing.  He told her, ""We both are still alive for a reason.  Everything changed when I saw you.""  Both were clones of the originals and the doctor over the lab told her, ""I knew you were important, so I saved your DNA.""  In a war, people on all sides die.  There would have to be consequences to their indiscreet actions.  He is betrayed by his brother, Orrin, who declared that what he did was treason.

Suddenly, the situation has changed and has become more complicated.  He'd told her, ""You had your chance, so you know where to find me.""  Clones, they realize, are just like ghosts.  I needed to protect you; you are an idea I kept alive.  She agrees, ""I remembered you.""  After their escape, she patched him together again.  We watch a slaughter down among the cherry blossoms and Orrin is defeated.  It's the end results that count in this case, not how pretty the path is getting there.  Aeon climbs aboard the cloning lab in the flying saucer with the gold trailers floating underneath and sets the explosives to destroy it.  After all, we are meant to live only once, but with hope.  The use of the heligraph of the 400-year-old doctor was very effective.  It was a good diversion from the cold weather and Christmas crowds and music.  It was a nice interlude into fantasy and sci fi at its best.",1133481600,4,2477,4.476510067114094
2510871,5,B000E991HA,"Aeon Flux is the very beautiful creation from the mind of Peter Chung.  The original (sans dialog) was far better and pure art.  This is a wonderful rendition of the original, but for the puritan Aeon flock it falls short after the first words are spoken.  Aeon is a little more cleaned up and less the lovely dominatrix she was in the original. Still, not exactly a family show, it is wonderful animation entertainment - Mr. Chung is a master and deserves far more credit than what this toned down MTV series offers as his true expression.  Nonetheless, this is an outstanding addition to any discriminating animation viewers' library.  Oh, yes, for all the REAL Ms. Flux fans out there, bring the ice cubes as you will need them... enjoy.",1113523200,5,740,4.661538461538462

2510883,5,B000E991HA,"Second time I have watched this movie, and it was as good this time and as can't-look-away compelling as the first. Charlize's character was believable and great to see a very attractive woman as a kick-ass athletic character. I found her very appealing, and she is a desirable hot-ticket in every movie in which she appears. An unremembered surprise in this second viewing was Johnny Lee Miller (Sherlock Holmes in TV's ""Elementary"") at a younger age and Frances McDormand whom I did not recognize until the closing Credits ran and I had to go back to determine which character she played.",1517097600,,590,4.851485148514851
2510884,2,B000E991HA,"Silly movie with a high body count. The protagonists, of course, hardly get scratched. (The main male protagonist gets shot twice, gets a couple of tiny skin patches, and then later that day or the next gets into another gunfight, gets shot again, and without any medical care appears perfectly fine. That's some recovery time!) The hand-to-hand combat scenes are laughable, with lots of quick cuts masking poor fight coordination. The other action scenes (chases, falls, etc.) have some pretty egregious CGI and green screen use, even for 2005. If you're into dystopian sci-fi action movies (Ultraviolet, The Matrix, Resident Evil, etc.), then this might satisfy you. Otherwise, I'd stay away.",1516406400,2,694,5.261261261261262

2510898,5,B000E991HA,"I want to preface my review by saying I am unfamiliar with the anime many have referenced in their reviews.

For me, this movie struck a chord. I am a huge fan of dystopian fiction, and the world portrayed in this film reminded me of one of my absolute favorite books of all-time, ""We"" by Yevgeny Zamyatin. Having Charlize Theron in the film helps, no doubt, but I think the story told here is very engaging. The action scenes are great and the pace of the story kept me interested. I've watched this movie a number of times and it seems to be that kind of cult classic you will either love or hate.

2510919,5,B000E991HA,"I had a life.
Now all I have is a mission

The year is 2415; it has been seven generations since the industrial plague whipped out 99% of the people. The few remaining survivors are all huddled into one city with walls protecting them from what ever is outside. It is an ideal city of Bregna ran by Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) and a council. And as with any such city there will always be rebels that thinks something is wrong with lack of freedom and mysterious disappearances. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) belongs to such an organization. Her mission as the most ept agent is to dispatch the so called benevolent ruler. Can she do this or will circumstances and chance encounters change the situation?

The film does not boast of any thing really extraordinary except maybe an exceptionally rich architectural back drop. Shot mostly in Berlin we see many popular places that for some reason they though would not be that familiar to the audience. Evidently they must not know how popular Berlin is, especially key locations. The original location on their wish list was Brasilia because of its 1050's futuristic look; however that proved to be economically unfeasible. See if you recognize Sans Souci, Potsdam built in 1745 by Frederick the Great, one of the world best know orangeries.

Although this movie had nothing extraordinary it is a perfect example of the genre and will hold your attention as you anticipate where they are going with the story. Only someone that anticipates that it will stick to the animated series may be disappointed.

The DVD rendering adds some background commentaries that make rewatching the film more enjoyable.",1506038400,3,1652,4.910394265232975
2510920,3,B000E991HA,"My issue is not with the movie itself (which I think is actually four stars) but with the way this was captured from film. There are moments where the camera seems to be slightly out of focus, as though there is some autofocus trying to get it right. I didn't see this film in the theater, so I don't know if its in the transfer to blu-ray or what.

On to the film - It doesn't (closely) follow the animated series, but I liked the story and the fact it has an ending that audiences can appreciate (the animated series tried to do this, but imho failed).

2510924,2,B000E991HA,"A fabulous art project botched by a silly script.  This was like watching a long fashion show with the entrails of a story strewn on the ground and stomped on.  The plot involved two factions vying for power in a walled city.  There are the elite Congress of Scientists and the rebel Monicans.  Neither group should have been in control.  Both used the art of assassination to regulate the dwindling masses.  There are machinations galore as everyone tries to take out the leader (Marton Csokas as Trevor), thinking his removal will solve everyones problems.  Guided by a lot of misinformation, assassin Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) sets out to kill the poor idealistic Trevor who has the misfortune of being related to a duplicitous megalomaniac brother (Jonny Lee Miller as Oren), who routinely uses murder to get what he wants.

Ive never been a fan of Charlize Theron.  In this film she doesnt act, she poses, its all a fashion spread as far as she is concerned.  As for the convoluted story, they take forever to get to the point and when they finally get there, they rush it through to an obvious conclusion.  This was a failed effort.  Director Karyn Kusama claims they took the film away from her, chopped out a half hour of footage, and made a mess of the rest.  Well, someone certainly made a mess of things.",1504742400,,1317,4.64935064935065

The plot isn't all that compelling and I never really bought the chemistry between Charlize and Marton Csokas since there was hardly any though Jonny Lee Jones made a compelling villain and McDormand put in a nice cameo.

2510948,4,B000E991HA,"Aeon Flux is your typical set in the future where humanity is controlled after an almost all human wiping out disaster occurred generations ago.  Like most movies in this genre, there is a rebellious group who don't follow the rules and annoy those in charge.  This one even has a Sarah Connor tone and pronunciation style voice-over giving us the set up.  Charlize Theron is the main one of these terrorist assassins we follow events over a couple of days and nights through.  The storyline gets a little confusing at times, and a bit hard to follow, although it all makes sense at the end.  But the reason to watch this is the cool visuals.  One of the earliest is a fly getting caught by Theron's character.  What's so special about that you say.  Well she does it with her eyelids!  It's a seriously cool scene and one you can try at home yourself.  You'll definitely want to get lawn like the one in this, if you're one of those who like to have keep off the grass signage. Plants fire dart like things in the future.  Although I don't know why Theron's character and her friend with hands for feet didn't just bring something to deflect them so they don't have to jump around and roll.  A shield would have worked, but perhaps they don't know what that is in the future.",1500854400,,1276,4.429184549356223

2510951,5,B000E991HA,"this movie is based on a real virus that happened in 2011,
we go to the future of 2045 and there is a scientist that has decided to find a cure for the virus,
one of his solutions is cloning other people to keep the search for the cure alive,
in the future, he starts his own group of people to protect himself and his people,
very much like puppets and they are the puppeteers,
like always there is always someone that wants to stop it,
the one person that was chose to do this is AEON FLUX,
not knowing who the person is , that's she was told to eliminate,for some reason when gets to that point, she can't do it
there is a funny felling that stops her, but she does know she needs to stop the person that killed her sister.
without giving away too much, just remember  there are clones in this movie and most of the movie is with clones
there is a lot of action and butt kicking and Charlie Theron is aeon, and she does not disappoint
if you watched the diversion series, this will remind you a lot of it, its just as thrilling if not more!
there is a  something you will see at the end of the movie, it might just blow your mind and you will find out ,

2510983,3,B000E991HA,"The storyline concept is actually pretty cool, which is why this movie was disappointing... it was a missed opportunity.

The action sequences suffer from poor editing... they're choppy and you can never really see what's going on.  Theron's character is basically a futuristic ""Black Widow"", and if they had done the hand-to-hand combat sequences like Marvel did with that character, that alone would have taken the movie the next level.  Even better, they should have taken a page out of The Matrix.  Instead, it's basically Theron striking a pose then cutting to her hitting someone then cutting to a post-combat comic book pose with no fluidity.

Another disappointment is the lack of explanation of technology or abilities.  Impaled on a pair of sharp objects 7 or 8 inches long through your upper back?  No worries; just keep fighting.  Get hit by four or five poisonous darts?  Hey... just keep running and you'll be fine.  Shot six times?  We'll put a high-tech bandaid on that so you can power through it.  Are these people superhuman or is this just silly?  Unfortunately, it feels a lot like the latter.

I like looking at Charlize Theron as much as the next guy, but there are WAY too many gratuitous shots of her standing in some melodramatic ""I'm a bad ass"" pose.  The director was trying too hard.

Overall, I did like the movie because I thought the basic premise (once it's revealed) was pretty nifty.  Unfortunately, the flaws are so glaring, once can't help but be distracted.  If it's available through Prime and you're looking to pass some time, it's good enough.  If you're thinking of paying for it, don't.",1498694400,,1629,4.815884476534296

2510988,1,B000E991HA,"Charlize Theron is an amazing actress, though before Mad Max: Fury Road she was Aeon. Aeon may be the equivalent in 2005 of the Black Widow, but the film is much too formulaic to really delve into any true issues and as a result Theron is silent for quite a lot of the film. Silent to the point where even expressions do not aid her in any character creation, unlike her role of Imperator Furiosa.

A science fiction film, Aeon Flux leaves several gaping plot holes that are larger than the literal hole the finale of the film leaves. The science of the film is never adequately explained, intriguing concepts such as telecommunications devices and an enclosed society, are largely left ignored. Instead the film opts to have Theron ""chase down the bad guy"" only to then go through a memory crisis Jason Bourne style. Intriguing questions on survive-ability of the human race or environmentalist critiques are sidelined for a standard Hollywood film with very few surprises. Ultimately, the film is unable to decide exactly what to do, and though special effects did a decent job in 2005 to bring the world to life Aeon Flux is absolutely flat. Don't waste your time on it - if you have not seen any of her later work, watch Prometheus or Mad Max: Fury Road as they are much more intriguing than this movie.",1498348800,3,1307,4.633620689655173

2511006,5,B000E991HA,"Aeon Flux is a 2005 science fiction action thriller from Paramount Pictures, which is based on the animated science fiction television series of the same name, created by Peter Chung. It takes place in the 25th century, after mankind had nearly been obliterated by a devastating viral epidemic, over four hundred years earlier. The story line centers around life in the year 2415, and depicts the plight of the approximately five million survivors, who have managed to propagate the human race, despite their dwindling numbers, and the many daunting challenges facing them. These survivors reside in a walled and fortified city-state called Bregna, which is ruled by a congress of scientists. Bregna is a seemingly idyllic place, but it is disrupted by the inexplicable disappearance of certain residents, and by terrible nightmares that are endemic in the population. A group of rebels conspiring to overthrow the government, known as the Monicans, have recruited a mysterious assassin named Aeon Flux, to eliminate the leader of the government. The treachery and intrigue that ensue, form the basis for the exploits of this warrior assassin. Aeon Flux features stellar performances by its lead actors, Charlize Theron, Marton Csokas, Jonny Lee Miller, and Frances McDormand, as well as superb performances by the members of the supporting cast. Aeon Flux is a decidedly engaging and entertaining science fiction action thriller, with an imaginative story line and great acting, and it merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1497484800,4,1556,5.381147540983607

If you were a big fan of the original series, you may be unhappy with the film version. It is best to treat this as an enjoyable sci-fi action flick that's long on action, has decent special effects and is a bit light on substance.",1485043200,,584,4.615384615384615

The only purpose of the film seems to be to have Ms. Theron leap around in a spandex catsuit while performing a series of preposterous stunts.  This could at least be fun except for the muddle of a
nonsensical plot and a lot of wooden exposition.  The whole action takes place in the year 2414 but at the very end there is a tacked on sequence of about one minute in which we see the ancestors of two principle characters meet in 2005 New York City.  This adds nothing to the story but does suggest that this was originally a much more arty film chopped up by some desperate editing.

2511039,3,B000E991HA,"I really like this movie. I know a lot of people pan it, largely comparing it to the off-the-wall cartoon, but I refuse to.

First off, yes, it is almost entirely unlike the cartoon series. I counter that by saying that the cartoon series was almost entirely unlike the cartoon series. Each episode played out like some kind of bizarre alternate universe compared to other episodes. The movie actually somewhat addresses that, but for the sake of avoiding spoilers, I won't describe exactly how it does so. Just consider this another alternate universe version of the show.

Next, it is not an action movie. Yes, there is action, and yes, it is often quite awesome, but no, it is not intended to be an action movie. It has a good, if a little cliched story, and it is engrossing because the characters are fairly interesting, for being highly reserved.  The visuals, however, are what make this movie so enjoyable. I like a good visual spectacle in a medium dedicated to such things. Above all else, it is a philosophical drama. Sure, the mystery is simple and the twist is something you can see from a mile away, but at least there was a conclusion to the movie.

And that brings us right back to the comparisons between the movie and the cartoon. Let's be completely honest here: Aeon Flux, the animated TV show, was brilliant. It took a lot of risks, and those paid off. That is, they paid off within the scope of the intended audience. Such an idea would have likely bombed just as badly at the box office as the movie did.

Do I like the movie better than the show? Is a bear Catholic? Of course not. The show was far deeper and more engrossing. Some of the episodes were downright destructive to the psyche. It perfectly captured the insanity of some anime such as Ghost in the Shell and Akira.

The movie, however, was an hour and a half of cinematic fun if you can just let yourself separate the movie from the show. Yes it had slow parts, but as whole, I felt that it was extremely underrated, and possibly pushed lower than it should have been because of nostalgia.",1482192000,,2075,4.50531914893617

2511084,5,B000E991HA,"This movie is awesome!  I watched it a while ago and then recently purchased the Blu-ray.  As a sci-fi aficionado and the proud owner of literally thousands of tiles of books and videos from this genre, I really did find this movie enjoyable.  Some other movies that have similar themes would include:  The Island, Logans Run, the Giver, and perhaps the Hunger Games and Divergent.

Format: Blu-Ray
The Blu-ray disk has all of the extras that are included with the standard DVD, but nothing else.  I was hoping for some additional material, but thats fine.  You still have all the behind the scenes and making of the moving shorts that are included on the DVD.  The Blu-ray is noticeably more detailed than the DVD, but not in a huge way, just noticeably.  In fact, from about eight feet on 55 plasma, there is only a subtle difference.  You have to remember this movie was made ten years ago when Blu-ray was just developing.  So, the Bu-ray could just be an early press of DVD into the blue-ray format.  That said, for the ridiculously low cost of this Blu-ray, I would recommend it over the DVD.
Movie:
The movie has become one of my favorites.  The entire concept, plot, script, acting  everything, is first rate.  This is not a B movie.  With the proper marketing and perhaps a different ending, this movie could have been a blockbuster.

Background:
In the early 1990s MTV launched Liquid TV with included a series of animated short shows set to popular music from that time period and featured a number of independent artists.  Beavis and Butt-Head, for example, came out of Liquid TV.  Aeon Flux was a cartoon character anti-hero who fought against the establishment in a futuristic dystopia where the world was run by a corrupt rgime.  Aeon Flux, herself, was this impossibly drawn fantasy woman with an impossibly tall, slender, curvaceous body in a black skin-tight superhero vinyl outfit (think the Selene character in the Underworld series bumped up several notches or Julie Newmar as Catwoman from the 1960s Batman series and turned into a cartoon).  At the end of each episode, she would get killed.  Thats the premise.

Synopsis:
The Aeon Flux movie ran with the basic premise cartoon and turned into something of a thriller.  It kept the main characters from the cartoon and added a really cool twist.  However, for fans of the very un-nerving cartoon, this movie will probably seem slow and watered down.  I do not think so, but I could see where some might.  The movie is about a utopian society where everything appears wonderful on the outside, but there is trouble brewing.  A deadly virus had wiped out most of the human race.  A scientist, Treavor Goodchild, discovered a cure and what was left of the human race lives in this giant walled city.  Aeon is part of a secret resistance trying to overthrow the apparently corrupt government.  However, as we learn, not everyone in the government is corrupt. And, the whole society is the way it is for good reason.  The leader of the government, Trevor Goodchild (who is supposed to be a descendant of the original Goodchild),  is her sworn enemy and the person she is ordered to kill by the resistance.  However, Trevor is not the evil ruler she thinks he is.  In fact, Aeon is not who she thinks she is.  Im not going to spoil the plot for those who have not seen it.  These are a number reviews here on amazon that do a good job of describing the movie in detail.  Suffice it to say the plot is exciting, believable, and fully developed.  You get into the movie rather quickly and then it confuses you with you with hidden motives and a dark secret that no one seems to know.  Its really good.  I completely disagree with all the reviewers who claim the story is predicable or unoriginal.  They may be comparing it to the disturbing original cartoon, or maybe don't appreciate the production quality.  The writers had to take a cartoon character and invent an entire storyline that translates onto the big screen.  They did a good job.  It works.

Charlize Theron is spectacular.  She comes as close to the cartoon perfection of Aeon Flux as a real human could.  Her movements and expressions are perfect.  She is entirely believable in this roll.  If you watch the extras you learn that she spent months learning how to fight and perfecting all the acrobatics.  She did the stunts herself!  There is this one scene where she comes out of a jump and is about to land when sharp knives come up out of the ground.  She lands on the ends of her toes with her legs spread completely out sideways from her body at the last minute and balances on an edge with her face just above the knives.  You learn in the extras that she really did physically contort her body and do that move  amazing!

My only criticism of the movie is that I didn't want it to end.  The ending is pretty final. Everything is revealed, there is complete closure.  No chance for a sequel.  The movie could have very easily been split into two  even three parts.  If it were a trilogy it would have been perfect.  The first movie could be about Aeon the rebel; fighting the establishment.  The second movie could be about the death of her sister and Aeon going on a personal vendetta against Trevor. The final instalment could be about discovering the truth and then working with Trevor to save the human race.  Having all of this in one short movie is a lot to take in.

If you are a sci-fi fan, give it a try.  To me, Aeon Flux is an awesome sci-fi ride with a perfect performance from a brilliant actress.  A must have for your collection!",1443139200,18,5581,4.570707070707071

2511123,3,B000E991HA,"How do you translate a hyper-dynamic animated series into a live action spectacle? I have no idea, but director Karyn Kusama and Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi decided to give it a shot. The end result was a pretty loose translation of the source material while still holding onto a few ingredients they felt were key: lots of acrobatics, gunplay and a bit of subversive fashion sense. The thing is while the cartoon was able to bring those elements out to the extremes they don't translate all that well in reality. What's left are the things that are different such as the setting, plot and several other elements added to the movie. The thing is they aren't strong enough to make up for the shortcomings. Aeon Flux is an ""also-ran"" in the heroine action sci-fi genre that can't really climb above similar films like Ultraviolet, Resident Evil and Underworld. It's not horrible, but it's hard to like.

The movie is set in an Earth where 90% of the world's population died 400 years ago and all that remain are living in a walled city-state of Bregna. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) is part of a rebel group that has tasked her to assassinate Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), who is the ranking member of the ruling council. This plan starts to unravel when Aeon realizes things aren't all that they appear to be in Bregna, and it seems the very existence of humanity is being coerced. While it strays wildly from the original animated show by Peter Chung it does hold onto some superficial details. Actually there big plotline on this film is pretty interesting, and would have made for some great storytelling if it weren't for all of the other distractions.

Aeon Flux is an action film to a fault, and by that I mean it follows a certain formula that pushes style over substance. There is nothing wrong with style... if done right. However here we have pretty good story that should have been further explored. Instead we get staged action scenes with Charlize Theron dodging bullets by doing somersaults, doing flips and splits any time the camera asks for it, and other stunts designed to look flashy and unrealistic. And there lies the problem. They put a lot of attention on replication some signature imagery from the animated series instead of making the scenes their own. The acrobatics feel forced, and the close up shots feel like they are only there in order to mitigate the fact they simply wouldn't work in the real world. It's hard to put a suspension of disbelief on what you are seeing when you are asked to do so over and over again.

This holds true also for the sound and special effects. Too much emphasis on ""cool"" action sounds actually start distracting from the physical action. Crunching noises, that sword-scraping-on-metal sound, squishy noises. It's like the foley artist was doing a guitar solo what with all the showing off done on the sound effects. Digital effects I admit aren't all bad, but there are one too many moments where a bit of CG animation comes up that either needed more polish are was simply overdone. When the CGI is done right it's right. When not it's really bad. Not really any in-between here.

It feels like in order to make room for all this craziness the exposion and back story come though at such a fast pace you have no time to really let it sink in. The one really good thing about this movie is drowned out. Worse still the pacing of the film gave it an awkward stretch when they finally did give the story time to fully realize. To be honest by halfway through the movie I was ready for it to finish. all the important details were covered and the rest of the film didn't lend all that much. They could have at least sped up the conclusion, but instead dragged it out to an almost torturous length.

The Blu-Ray release looks just as good as the previous HD-DVD release. Although some may content there is less bandwidth on this single layer BD version it really doesn't make a difference. Visuals are as good as you are going to get and do look nice on a bid screen. Audio on the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track is tight, but keep in mind the sound effects issues also come into play as the movie likes to show off the surround sound in ways unbecoming of a refined film. You also get Dolby 5.1 in Spanish and French as well as subtitles for all (nice touch). Special features are exactly the same as the ones on the DVD and HD-DVD releases. It's not bad, even if it's light:

Commentaries - Two commentaries. One with Actress Charlize Theron and Producer Gale Anne Hurd that go through a lot of the technical and production aspects of the film. The other commentary is with screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, and it focuses more on the story elements like the characters and subplots and themes. Both commentaries seem to give the film a lot of praises, which makes me wonder if we are watching the same film.

Featurettes - There are five, but really this is just one 45 minute documentary broken down into five parts. Creating a World, The Locations, The Stunts, The Costume Design Workshop and The Craft of the Set Photographer make up the separate parts. It's actually a pretty good making of documentary when seen all together. Very little fluff and lots of details going into making the film. It's one of the better ""making of"" featurettes out there.

Aeon Flux isn't that good. It's not horrible, and to be honest that really neat story I keep talking about is a worthwhile reason to watch this film if you are a science fiction fan. Just keep in mind the rest of the movie really dulls that moment. I can only recommend this one as a rental. There is talk that about 30 minutes of footage was taken out of the film and if a director's cut would be released it would make all the difference. I have a hard time believing that. However if it does exist, and if the recutting takes out a lot of the messy spectacle and adds some depth they may be onto something.",1428278400,2,5937,4.547240411599626

2511140,1,B000E991HA,"I didn't expect this movie to be good. It got bad reviews. It looked like a cheap, pulp-cyberpunk popcorn movie. My sister said it was ""okay"" (or something along those lines). It stars the woman who played the worst character in ""The Italian Job."" So I wasn't expecting anything super clever or profound. But I at least thought I'd be able to FINISH it.

I've seen a lot of bad movies, a LOT of bad movies. And this is the first time in years, maybe a decade, that I can remember not even finishing a movie.

This movie is bad in virtually every possible way a movie could be. One can't help but wonder if there was some kind of ""Springtime for Hitler"" scheme behind its making.

The acting is about as bad as acting can get. I am not exaggerating when I say that I have seen pornos with better acting. At least the girls in ""Lord of the G-Strings"" showed some excitement when they crossed paths with a sexy elf. None of the characters in this movie seem to care about anything that happens around them, or deliver any dialogue with a natural tone of voice. If they had stuck Nicholas Cage in the lead role, at least it would be entertaining to see him strut about in that sexy leather outfit and cute hairdo.

The special effects are cheap CGI. Occasionally the visuals are vaguely interesting. Those giant tic-tac things with the jelly-fish tentacles were kind of cool. (I think they were space ships...or maybe they were blimps.) But it wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention. And obviously, CGI like that does nothing to create an atmosphere, like the sets of ""Dark City"" or ""Blade Runner"" do.

The plot? Totalitarian government, utopia that isn't, rebels, badass babe with superpowers, wearing a sexy black outfit and an anime hair cut. I think there might've been a romance story in there too. How original.

Characters? .......................um.....................well, there's the sexy assasin babe who shows no emotion..............her sweet sister who's too good for this sinful earth.....some bad guys in business suits....oh, and a chick with monkey feet. Yuck.

I wondered what dolts made this movie. Then I noticed that the DVD had a couple commentaries. Hey, I love commentaries! If the movie itself sucked, maybe there will still be some interesting info on how it was made. Well I watched a bit of the commentaries and....wow. What deep, perceptive people, made this movie. ""This is an Orwellian society. It looks like a uptopia, but it isn't."" ""...in this scene, we see these characters talking about killing someone. And this establishes that they are our villains. That they are evil.""

Well, I have to admit, the commentary certainly explained a lot about this movie.

This movie is not good enough to be good, not bad enough to be funny, and not enough of anything to satisfy a shallow fix for action movies/cyberpunk/visuals. It just sucks. I feel horribly juvenile saying that, but that's really the only way to put it. This movie doesn't deserve a deep, analytical criticism; it deserves to be spoken to at its own level. In an impression of Beavis and Butthead, I declare, hurr hurr, like, this movie sucks. It sucks worse than anything that has ever sucked before.",1417737600,,3201,4.784420289855072

Also, the night before I had watched RED SONJA with Brigitte Nielsen and Arnold Schwarzenagger.  If you want to see a truly bad movie, real one or two star quality, go to that, not AEON FLUX!  Charlize Theron does have real star power and looks, and just watching the way she moves in this movie is worth the price of admission.  She did most of her own stunts (actually injuring herself in the process, it turns out), and she is both powerful and graceful.  The premise about love enduring across death is terribly hokey, but I found it moving and convincing.  The two leads managed to pull it off.

2511197,4,B000E991HA,"The concept behind Aeon Flux is intriguing. It's a dystopian vision of the future in which all but a handful of people died out from a disease. The survivors are left in an Orwellian community that claims to be the last refuge against a disease. But a handful of rebels has risen up against the leaders. There's potential for a fascinating sci-fi plot. Unfortunately, the movie generally descends into a flashy Hollywood action flick after that. The movie does resolve the plot with an interesting twist, but doesn't really explore the moral or philosophical implications. I guess if anything it's a more thoughtful and interesting action movie, but could have been more.

I do appreciate the cinematography for the film. There are some visually interesting scenes. Much of the movie is done in an almost abstract style. It relies heavily on visual imagery and relatively less on dialogue to tell the story. Generally, this worked well. The futuristic world was mysterious but not too unrealistic. Lovely use of water for various scenes.

As for acting, let's just say Charlize Theron can pull off an action hero.

Overall, Aeon Flux is worth checking out for fans of sci-fi action movies. It's definitely not cerebral sci-fi, but has nuggets of interesting concepts. I give it 3.75 stars for being one of the more interesting action movies to have come out in recent years.",1355788800,,1374,4.9393939393939394

2511203,4,B000E991HA,"This is a new twist on the cloning debate.  I must admit, I am not familiar with the animated series or comic serials this film is based on.  My review is primarily from a Charlize Theron fan's point of view.  The story, the characters, the special effect and the overall mood of the story are all a bit unexpected.

As a film, Aeon Flux does not disappoint.  It combines great characters, a complex plot, and great special effects in an entertaining format that zips by in a 92 minutes.  The alternate society is a varied theme that generally creates a blank canvas for writers and directors to play with freely.  Here, Kusama, Manfredi, Chung, and Hay step up to answer the call well.  Action begins quickly and integrates viewers in an alternate world rather quickly.  It is a strange world though.

Aeon portrays a rogue assassin who betrays her mission when unanswered questions collide with residual memories of another lifetime.  Coincidence and circumstance lead her into a precarious position between future and past.  In the end, her decision demonstrates heroic wisdom and courage demanded of a science-fiction character. Theron captures Aeon's character well.

Charlize Theron is sexy, smart, and daring. Her ability to present Aeon's conflict is genuine.  She also stands alone as a unique hero in a complex universe.  This modern Hollywood princess skillfully uses all action, dialogue, and pacing. Her physical beauty harmonizes well with her grace and athletic prowess.  Charlize Theron is a fantastic actor.

The plot is interesting.  I certainly didn't expect events to unfold as they did.  I do like the pace and fluidity involved.  The pivotal scene in which Aeon must convince Sith Andra her intentions are pure is a little sudden, but definitely not forced.  I believe a little history leading up to Aeon's mission would have been well worth the extra time it would have added to the movie.  In the end, most questions are answered, and the story feels complete.",1340841600,6,1984,4.966565349544073

2511205,4,B000E991HA,"People don't seem to get this in terms of the big picture. As a standard action movie it's a little slow, but the action stuff is the least interesting part of the film.

This story is about the relationship between humanity and nature. The people of this world live entirely cut off from everything natural, though there are occasionally pristine manicured lawns and apparently genetically-engineered fruits. Outside the walls is dense jungle, kept constantly at bay by a constant spray of poisons from automated machines. Inside everything is perfect, monitored, and tightly controlled.

There's a resistance movement struggling against the leadership but it isn't clear why. Aeon, the protagonist, is sent to kill the leader, Goodchild. On her mission she learns that the world isn't what she thought it was.

People who don't get this story are focusing too close, looking at it in terms of human characters. Don't. Consider it instead in terms of nature struggling to reclaim what has been taken by humanity, and a completely different picture emerges.

2511209,3,B000E991HA,"Based on what was orginally an animated series of violent and sexually explicit cartoons, it's well been said that the heroine Aeon Flux is pretty much a female James Bond in an futuristic cyberpunk era.  Aeon lives in an apocalyptic setting, where the world has been decimated by a fatal virus and the 5 million survivors have been living for 400 years in an enclave called Bresna under the leadership of the Goodchild family that saved it.  But conflict emerges when members of the populace start strangely disappearing, and an underground resistance force known as Monicans emerges, in an attempt to assassinate the current leader of the Goodchild clan.  Aeon Flux gets the assignment to take out Goodchild, but in the process makes some startling discoveries that cause her to rethink which side she's on.

The primary focus of the film is an action drama, with Aeon Flux and her fellow characters getting lots of camera time doing all kinds of cartwheels and handsprings in the modern setting that is their playground.  It's been said of the animated protagonist that she is ""provocative, sexy, and acrobatic"" - and that's exactly the way Aeon comes to life on the screen as well.  The film was pleasantly free of the crude humor or vulgar language that tends to be combined with this kind of character and action, but expect to see some sexual connotations (with a strong feminine character like Aeon, how can you not?), and lots of violence.  Although most of the victims are faceless, there were occasions where the blood and gore forced me to look away, and it's not surprising that the film got the PG-13 rating it did for this reason.  If the two main protagonists came across somewhat emotionless, they made up for it with the energy of their action and the destruction they cause, particularly Aeon's superhuman acrobatics.

The action is backed by a relatively interesting, if not simple plot, which raises some interesting intellectual questions about contemporary ethical issues, cloning in particular.  In a world where the entire population has become infertile, Trevor Goodchild's quest is to find a way for normal pregnancies to happen, but his brother thinks that the status quo where the human race can only be perpetuated by cloning is a utopia that needs no change.  Perhaps nowhere is this better articulated than in the closing stages of the film, where the question is raised about whether a form of immortality achievable through cloning is superior than to a mortal life.  Aeon says: ""We're meant to die. It's the only thing that makes things matter. ... To live once for real, and then give way to people who might do better. To live only once, but with hope.""  The implication seems to be that even if human cloning were ever to be successful, it wouldn't make human life more valuable than it is at present, even with its mortality.

This kind of dialogue seems to raise deep questions on an important contemporary issue, and even hints at a moral stand against cloning.  But in reality the film only scratches the surface of it, and never really addresses these serious questions except for raising them in a somewhat vague manner at the very end.  Not that it matters - in the end Aeon Flux is really about cool looking fight scenes and a futuristic spectacle with intense action sequences.  And in the process, like much other science fiction, it shows the illusion of a utopian dream, namely that even if cloning does hold the promise of utopia, it would still result in a world where humans are inherently flawed.  Cloning won't redeem humanity, and Aeon Flux won't redeem the genre of science fiction, but it's a fun ride.  While it lacks substance, but it's still reasonable entertainment.  - GODLY GADFLY",1327276800,,3744,4.838557993730408

I think I am willing to suspend my demand for reality and go with science fiction, but the problem with this movie is that it often skips over the 'how did he get there' or 'how did he/she know that' way too often.  DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED TO THE STORY.  The part about clones having a memory is unique and pretty good.  Plagued by dreams and intuitive feelings of the past, those who have gone through multiple clonings could well become a bit 'off' mentally.  But why should the first clone be in that same category?  How would a dead body have knowledge of the doctor that did the cloning?

2511216,5,B000E991HA,"How I missed this production for five years means it's time for me to leave the cave. The three consistent criticisms, from what I read, were that the costuming was poorly conceived and I would disagree somewhat given how difficult it is and historically has been to portray dress codes that far into the future so why not at least promote Charlize's physical attributes. Second, that the movie isn't faithful to the written comic book series is a common argument for all similar transferences from the printed page to the screen and most viewers regard that as a moot point as the mediums are, in the first place, so different and, secondly, how a story is expressed should be independent in the two mediums. Third, that the forest outside the city was poorly conceived and I say, so what, as the forest was largely superfluous to the main direction of the story.

Digression aside, I principally look for creative storytelling in movies including the plot, the props, the sets, the cinematography, the editing/directing, the acting and this movie succeeded on all those criteria.  The story had a moralistic and intellectual theme; the props were visually period appropriate and well conceived; the sets were uniquely futuristic in design and function; the props such as Aeon's rotating eye and modes of communication were all interesting and novel; the camera work contributed to making this alternative dynamic world come across as somewhat realistic and the acting was solid enough. Finally, I noticed that the director's cutting edge work went a little under appreciated. So, director kudos, but a few years late, for delivering an entertaining and thought provoking futuristic action flick.

One of the most important factors for Aeon Flux is the incredible visuals. Characters would pull out cool gadgets and do cool thangs with them. Interesting points of view are used to convey the action in a stylistic manner that keeps pace with the story being told. This movie missed that mark completely.

Instead, it has a few underdeveloped special effects. The action is constantly abruptly stopped, instead of conveying the story through the action. Instead of participating in the action, Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) tends just walk around while everything goes on around her. When she does fight, the action is cut off. I don't think I saw one punch or kick ever get close to landing. We'd see the beginning of the punch thrown, then get the cut away of the person already lying on the floor dead with Aeon Flux doing more walking away.

Being a romantic I was especially pleased by the relationship between the lead characters. The theme of the movie at heart is a morality play and designed to provoke contemplation and discussion of serious societal issues.

It is only loosely based on the MTV Aeon Flux animated series, but it is true to the shows ""Vibe"", and works as a surprisingly astute commentary on 21st C society.

The half hour show even less.  From there to this abomination of a movie it was basically a really flashy, sexy, somewhat interesting concept that was simply never fleshed out into something actually interesting.  When the whole thing was teetering, about to topple from its own weight it was buttressed and supported with a bunch of post-apocalyptic scifi movie cliches.. and then the creators called it a day.

2511235,4,B000E991HA,"There are a plethora of reviews of the movie, but my review is mostly a comparison of the BD vs DVD version. I won't discuss its merits as movie.

I saw Aeon Flux on 2 DVD versions and finally BD, as different releases were made.

This movie is best in BD. Video is noticeably sharper.  However, in colors and audio, the DVD was very well made, its not that far from the BD version.  So if you already own the DVD version, its not that big a leap in quality.

Where it matters most are what you expect from BD, more resolution so the lines are cleaner versus jaggy in DVD.  A good DVD player will 'smooth' the jagged edges when possible, so no where is the lines of any image as tack sharp as in BD.

This very visible as there are many 'sharp' and contrasting colors used in the movie: the blades of grass, the needle popping out of the grass, Theron's chiseled features, the straight lines of her hair style.

The audio is not that striking either in channel separation or dynamic range.

Overall, I bought this disk for $10. I'm not sure its good value at $16.  In contrast, there are many BD releases that truly take your breath away and are a huge leap in quality over its prior superlative DVD version, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-of-Brothers-Blu-ray/dp/B00129H7VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band of Brothers [Blu-ray</a>].

2511237,4,B000E991HA,"Aeon Flux (2005) is a slick science fiction adventure, with Aeon being a sleek, attractive, and athletic heroine.  The character is taken from an animated MTV short, created by Peter Chung.  Substantial changes were made in order to develop a suitable full length story, and to allow for the adaptation of an animated adventure, to a real life format.  The story is complicated, but holds together pretty well, and features various futuristic sets, numerous action sequences, and impressive special effects.

In order to survive a deadly plague, drastic measures were required, and the last remnants of humanity live in a city with walls along its perimeter, called Bregna.  Life seems ideal, but a small organization, known as the Monicans seeks to destroy the government structure.  Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), is an elite guerilla operative for the Monicans, who receives instructions telepathically, from the Handler (Frances McDormand).  Her next mission is huge, to assassinate the head of the government, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas).  Tragically, before she is about to embark, Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner) is shot, apparently for being suspected as a Monican.

Oren Goodchild (Jonny Lee Miller), is also a member of the Government, believing his brother Trevor is not with the program, he hatches a scheme to eliminate his older sibling using the Monicans.  With the help of Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) another elite operative, Aeon enters the Cidadel, the seat of the government, and gets into position to complete her mission, but when face to face with Goodchild, Aeon hesitates, and is captured.  Things take a dramatic turn when Aeon learns the truth about Trevor, and the work he has been involved in.  The two team up to try and survive the Bregnan government, and the Monicans, who regard Aeon as a traitor.

The film shifts into a high action mode in the final stretch.  There are some shaky, over the edge moments, but the result are exciting, stylized, and dramatic.  Whether the resolution is palatable, is another matter, as Aeon makes a decision that all humanity must live with.

After Charlize Theron won an Oscar for Monster (2003), by her own admission, she did no major physical training, and needed to get in top shape for her physical demanding role as Aeon Flux.  Theron and Sophie Okonedo, both tall and athletic, underwent similar training regimes, eventually training together.  Remarkably, Theron did almost all of her own stunts, and amazed the production crew with her physical ability and timing.  Her acrobatic performance, in a skin tight suit, is quite impressive, as is that of Okonedo whose character has hands for feet.

The  future world of Aeon Flux is intriguing, and semi-understandable, but with many mysterious elements.  There are theatrical show pieces like the cathedral where the Handler gives directions, a and blimp that flies over the city, and interdimensional transitions, that are really not explained.  The unique architecture of Berlin was featured, and helps give the film an certain ambiance and futuristic look.  Director Karyn Kusama (Jennifer's Body), whose only previous experience was Girlfight (2000), does a quite remarkable job in a challenging project.  The screenplay by Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay, apparently covered much more ground, and may have filled in some of the gaps.  Some 30 minutes was reportedly deleted from the director's cut, for the theatrical release.  Some may feel that the liberties taken with the character, had already gone too far.  Creator Peter Chung, apparently had some problems with the film.

The blu-ray disc does not contain the director's cut, but appears to contain the same 92 minute version of the film, as well as the extras from the Special Collector's Edition.  This includes two separate commentary tracks, and a number of informative featurettes.  Graeme Revell contributes a cool score for the film.  Although perhaps an incomplete vision, for some thoughtful science fiction, with some stylized action, Aeon Flux is worth a look.  Based on her performance here, Charlize Theron has great potential in the action genre, and hopefully she will pursue this avenue at some future time.",1263081600,7,4207,5.1943620178041545

2511241,4,B000E991HA,"I love Sci-Fi movies and I also have a deep appreciation for women. Many movies that feature female heroines portray them in a way that de-feminizes, particularly some Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Adventure films. This is one of many reasons why the movie ""Tomb Raider"" is not a part of my collection.

Please do not be mistaken! Their is a huge difference between sexuality and femininity. The heroine that exudes FEMININITY will by default exude SEXUALITY. However, many movie heroines are very sexy to look at but are not very feminine in their character portrayal.

I am a man that thinks women are neat, with all their complexities. I appreciate their FEMININITY and their STRENGTH. This movie was very well directed. In that, it accentuated a strong heroine who was very comfortable with being a woman. It appealed to my deep love of Sci-Fi films and my appreciation for the ""complete woman.""",1240704000,4,884,4.966216216216216
2511242,2,B000E991HA,"Taken on its own, this is a so-so B science fiction movie with very nice effects and visuals.  But as an adaptation of the animated series, it is pretty terrible.

Granted that the TV series's storylines were always byzantine, often bordering on the incomprehensible, but there was always a lot of thought and wit behind them, and the dialogue was consistently brilliant.  It was a show that expected a lot of its audience, and it's unfortunate that a lot of people (the makers of this movie in particular) can't see past the show's eye candy.  By comparison, this film's script just drips mediocrity.  The effects are wonderful and must have cost a fair penny, and they really do capture the distinctive look of the show, so I can't help but wish they'd taken the time to write a decent story that was somewhat faithful to its source material.

They could have at least tried to get the basics of the premise right.  In the original show, Aeon is a super-competent freelance agent, working to undermine the rule of Trevor Goodchild, an eccentric megalomanic scientist who has seized political control of the city-state of Bregna (pronounced BREN-yeh) to use as a giant petri dish for his scientific and social engineering experiments.  Trevor is weirdly charismatic and seems to genuinely believe he is creating a utopia, despite the obvious dystopian aspects of the world he has made.  Across the heavily guarded border lies the rival nation of Monica.  We never see much of Monica, but it appears to be a much freer place than Bregna, and Aeon frequently helps people try to sneak across the border, as well as sabotaging all of Trevor's crackbrained pet projects as they occur to him.  Although she clearly sympathizes with Monica, she ""takes no side"" and is essentially an anarchist, rebelling against any controlling authority, and therefore despising Trevor's despotism.  Further complicating matters is the fact that Aeon and Trevor share a past, the details of which are never given, and are still deeply infatuated with one another, even though they are now enemies.

So there you go!  The makings of a terrific movie script, right?

I guess not.  In this movie, Aeon is not her own boss, but instead is a minion taking orders from a rebel organization called the Monicans.  Monica itself does not exist.  Trevor never staged a coup, but is instead the hereditary monarch of Bregna (pronounced BREG-na).  Most of humanity was wiped out by a disease generations ago, and Brega is all that's left.  People have been getting secretly killed by Trevor's government, so the Monicans want to kill Trevor.  Aeon begins experiencing flashbacks to a past with Trevor that she doesn't clearly remember.  Without spoiling the big revelation about why Trevor's government is assassinating people, I can say that Trevor's personality and motivations end up bearing no resemblence to the original, and that the original was a lot more interesting.  For her part, Aeon is far less confident than her animated counterpart, and spends most of the movie being led around by various different people and being unsure what to do.  When she finally does something proactive toward the end of the film... frankly, it seems like kind of a stupid action under the circumstances, but it works out.  The dialogue is a huge let-down, with none of the wonderful, multi-leveled verbal sparring betwen Aeon and Trevor that defined their relationship in the original show.  Aeon does get in a couple of very good lines right as she's about to make the above-mentioned big decision, however.

The funky music is cool, and the film is fun to look at.  Charlize Theron does an admirable job with the material she's given; I'm impressed by how well she nailed the animated character's voice.  On it's own merits, it's not such a bad film, just nothing remarkable.  But it is a lousy adaption of its source material.",1239926400,3,3890,4.9036697247706424

2511244,3,B000E991HA,"Aeon Flux is the 2005 film based on the early 90s animated shorts and late 90s half hour eps;and quite ride it is. I highly recommend the Aeon Flux animated collection also available,but do not try to compare the two. The movie(like any anime'to film property)is a palatable(dressed down)version of the animated series,with the action in the animated series much richer and heavier in content than its' movie counterpart. But that doesn't mean there's not alot to recommend here.
The story is set in the year 2011 and the  walled-in city Bregna,is host to earths' last surviving population. A plague 400 years ago left the survivors sterile and the Goodchild Research Foundation now runs the city with an iron hand. It is in turn run by its' name sake brothers Trevor(Marton Csokas,Borias from Xena) and Oren(John Miller).
But something strange is happening to many of the citys' citizens. Besides a myriad of daily disappearances,many of its' citizens who meet perfect strangers have inexplicable remnant memories of them;some good,some bad.
Our heroine Aeon Flux(Charlize Theron)is part of a rebel group called The Monacans who are fighting to end the Goodchild regime,by any means. Monacans are genetically and drug enhanced humans with superior strength and speed. They also can contact one another and/or their leader ""The Handler""(Frances McDormand) psychically. Aeon is first given the job of sabotaging the security system which she accomplishes with little problem. On her way to meet her sister she sees her being carried out dead on a stretcher. Aeon wants and gets her revenge as her next assignment is to kill Trevor Goodchild. Making her way through many extremely difficult defences she manages to penetrate the Citadel where she finds Trevor rehearsing a speech. As she approaches him he turns,recognizes her and says the name of ""Catherine"".She also vaguely recognizes something in him but it is too late and her hesitation causes her to be caught. Not for long as she escapes and returns to meet with Trevor. They make love and after a brief sleep Aeon wakes up and chokes Trevor to near death. She leaves and realizes that her answer may lay in an object that circles the city in the sky called the""Relico"".It is a flying ship supposedly built to remind the inhabitants of their sacrifices but she thinks there is more to it. She gets aboard and finds out the whereabouts of her sister and leaves. Trevor who has followed behind now knows what she was after and finds out even more information he didn't know of. He meets Aeon at the location of her sister to find that the sister is now a baby. Trevor reveals that she has been cloned;in fact everyone has been cloned over the past 400 years. He also says the real reason her sister was killed was that she was pregnant,naturally. Nature has found a cure on its own for the sterile plagued society and Trevors'brother Oren wants to keep the information from getting out,thus all the kidnappings,disappearances and deaths. Oren has also condemned Trevor to death as a traitor for sleeping with Aeon and both are now wanted fugitives. Aeon herself has also been handed a death sentence seperately by her own Monacan organization for not carrying out her mission. After a bloodied battle with Oren's forces who fight not only Trevor and Aeon but other Monacan snipers,the two barely escape with their lives. Aeon again climbs aboard the ""Relico"" and blows the ship up,sending it crashing into  a section of city wall and exposing the outside forested world to the startled inhabitants. The citizens now free of the Goodchild oppression can now start to live their lives anew.
The film is filled with spectacular stunts and CGI effects throughout and some sequences are amazing to watch. One especially delightful sequence is with a friend,the hand-footed Zathandra,as they attempt to cross the rolling grassy landscape towards the Citadel. With incredible jumps by the pair punctuated by deadly gourds with shooting syringes of poison and the grass,which becomes seemingly alive when a human presence is detected-going from blades of grass to razor sharp blades of steel.
It is certainly both an aural and visual feast to be sure. But the plot keeps you intrigued and interested,I found,throughout the picture with very few let ups. And more importantly this film is one you can watch over and over and still find something just a little different each time.
The picture here is top notch,crisp and clear all the way and with that wonderful sound available in D/Surround 5.1 or 2.0.
The special features abound:Commentary by Theron and producer Gale Hurd or by co-writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi,""Creating a World:Aeon Flux""(20 m),""Location of AF""(15m),""Stunts of AF""(9m),""Costume Design Workshop of AF""(13m),""Craft of the set Photographer""(3m) and trailers.

They did this whole thing and THAT was all they had to offer?""  Unfortunately, this is one of those films:  the images are striking, the mystery fun, and then you get to the end and wonder how any producer could have imagined it would sell enough to recoup the investment.

2511247,5,B000E991HA,"""Aeon Flux"" is one of those rare films that gets universally negative reviews from critics who are normally used to 'epics' such as ""Out of Africa"" or ""Terms of Endearment"". It takes a different sort of mind to appreciate science fiction, because the genre is rare at giving us true classics. That said, if you liked David Lynchs' dark and disturbing film version of ""Dune"", then you will certainly find much to like in ""Aeon Flux"".

The film runs like the fractured tale of a universe in peril, and one woman seems to hold the key and the balance between two insane realities. Charlize Theron really brings it as the lead character, and they really prop her well with the choicest special effects and the most liberal use of CGI, though in an appropriate manner. Theron has always been a good actress, but her stiff, warrior-like role here will win over the most jaded of science fiction fans, simply because there is no comparison (Milla Jovovich in ""Ultraviolet"" comes close, but that was more pop-art than dystopian art).

The storyline is bleak, yet hopeful, and the multiple realities really make the film work even in areas where the script might sometimes let it down. There are issues with it, yes, but I think that it only works in making the film truly a work of art, because unlike other films in the genre, it doesn't cheapen science fiction, but rather glorifies it as a true vision of the future, much like the classic SF novels of the 1960s (remember Roger Zelazny?)

""Aeon Flux"" deserves five stars, and a really good projection system, because the visuals in this movie are just so clear, stunning and memorable, and this is one movie you can watch again and again - which in my book is the hallmark of a true classic.",1233014400,,1736,4.62987012987013

2511260,4,B000E991HA,"When I was first tantalized by the high-speed trailor for the 2005 Paramount motion picture, Aeon Flux, directed by Karyn Kusama (Girlfight), I was blissfully unaware of its history: that it was based on the darkly irreverant and raunchy 1995 MTV Liquid Television animated SF series created by Korean American animator, Peter Chung. The series achieved cult status among a select audience of imsoniacs (it played at midnight on MTV, if that tells you anything). This may have worked in my favour. I had no expectations or preconceptions, except for a hair-flying ride. As a result, when the content (written by Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay) had merit as social commentary, I counted it as a bonus.

In typical dystopian fashion, we join the Aeon Flux story roughly four hundred years after an industrial-related virus has killed 99% of the world's population. Scientist, Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) has developed a cure and the Goodchild dynasty secures a home for the five million survivors in the last city on Earth, Bregna, a paradise walled off from the unrestrained wilderness that ever-threatens them. Dystopias, like Bregna, often appear utopian on the surface, exhibiting a world free of poverty, hardship and conflict, but with some fatal flaw at their core. Built from scientific premise and intended only as a temporary measure, the technocratic society of Bregna continues long after its intended span as the Goodchilds attempt to deal with an internal and enduring glitch (infertility) of the ""cure"". Like most imposed provisional governments, this one's solution to a problem (cloning) has created yet another problem (fugitive memories from the previous clone's life).

It is now 2415 and the walled society of Bregna appears utopian--clean and organized, beautiful, rich and spatious; but beneath the laughter and contentment, stirs an uneasy disquiet. Bregnans are losing sleep, having bad dreams, and are plagued by memories that don't belong to them. Rebels challenge the Goodchild regime, run by Trevor and his brother Oren, and among the rebels is a highly competent and ruthless assassin, Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), whose tools include whistle-controlled ball-bearing bombs, drugs that allow her to meet people on higher planes of existence, and interchangeable eyeballs. She is aptly named, as she serves a true agent of discord to Goodchild, the guardian of order and all that he navely believes is good.

""Some call Bregna the perfect society,"" Aeon tells us in the opening scenes of the motion picture, ""Some call it the height of human civilization...but others know better...We are haunted by sorrows we cannot name. People disappear and our government denies these crimes...But there are rebels who...fight for the disappeared. They call themselves the Monicans. I am one of them."" Several critics disliked the narrative introduction. I found that it particularly worked, by adding a reflective literary quality to the motion picture. It is noteworthy that in the original animated series, Trevor Goodchild often frames each episode with his reflections; only fitting that Aeon gets her chance in the film version. The reflective narrative of the motion picture is meant to enlighten its audience that this is not your ordinary action thriller. What follows is a fast-paced yet thoughtful story, with elements of romance, that explores notions of longevity, social structure and connection, faith and greed to a satisfying end.

Twitchfilm.net aptly called the motion picture ""biological science fiction"". Says Oren, Trevor's treacherous brother who betrays him: ""We've beaten death. We've beaten nature."" The film's clean organic high-tech look faithfully captures the ""sense of biotech gone wild"" of the TV series by exploring several paradigms inherent in a society that lives deliberately in the absense of nature's chaos. Indeed, the lack of connectivity resonates throughout the motion picture in its exploration of friendship, family, loyalty, and purpose. When her sister is murdered in the beginning of the film supposedly by Trevor's men (but in actuality by his scheming brother, Oren), Aeon's mission becomes personal: ""I had a family once. I had a life; now all I have is a mission.""

The film truly launches into stylish action and intrigue when Aeon gladly accepts a mission to assassinate Trevor, thinking that this violent act will make it all better. Instead, it unravels her, beginning with when she confronts him; finding him uncomfortably familiar and alluring, she hesitates and decides not to kill him. ""What do you want?"" Trevor asks her. ""I want my sister back. I want to remember what it's like to be a person."" It is indeed he--or rather what he knows--that holds the key to who she is. The key is that she, like he and all those in Bregna, is a 400 year-old copy of someone before the virus. Four hundred years ago she was the original Trevor's wife.

Filmed in Berlin, the movie is visually stunning, from the opening shot on the steps of Sans Souci to the labrinthine wind canal used by the Nazis. Displaying an eclectic mixture of spareness and mid-century design the film is acted out in a fluid dance to Graeme Revell's (Sin City) haunting score. The action is rivetting and seamless with both plot and underlying theme of bio-tech gone awry. Early on we are treated to a thrilling sequence of Aeon and her biotech-altered rebel colleague negotiating the security of Goodchild's sanctuary that consists of a beautiful but deadly garden, guarded by patches of knife-sharp blades of grass and poison dart-spitting fruit trees.

Aeon champions moral ethics and single-handedly destroys the relicor, the supposetory of the clone DNA, pursuing honour at the expense of loyalty (to Goodchild) and heralding in a new age of ""mortality"". The movie ends as it begins, with Aeon's narrative: ""Now we can move forward. To live once for real and then give way to people who might do it better...to live only once but with hope."" This is truly what Aeon Flux represents and what her very name embodies.",1212883200,,6057,5.161914460285132

Curiosity took ahold of me though when this movie came to DVD and I ended up enjoying it very much. I liked the cool color palette, the sensual nature of organic technology and the innovative methods of weaponry.

The story, though not entirely original, was entertaining and at times thought-pprovoking. I ended up enjoying it. And it's in the truth of this that I discover why many didn't like the movie. As a fan of the show Bewitched, I was devastated by what was done to the movie to follow it. The same I guess for this movie. Fans of the show have a generally disdainful view of this movie.

That having been said, it was worth seeing once just because the locations and costumes were so cool. But the story was just too conveniently tied up, and Trevor was recast as a thoroughly virtuous goody-goody who happened to have an evil brother (I'm surprised he wasn't an evil twin). It would have been tough to make the animated series into anything cohesive, but the characters in this film are just too nice, too Hollywood, not believable. Even Aeon has lost her sadistic streak. And Peter Chung okayed all this, according to the ""extras"" on the DVD! Not a great movie, but well-made mindless entertainment (probably not for the hardcore Flux fan).",1207267200,,743,4.858267716535433
2511266,4,B000E991HA,"To make a film out of a series of short animated episodes, little better than running gags for the most part, is no mean feat if a horrible parody of the original is to be avoided. I haven't seen it, aside from a few clips, but I'm pretty sure that Tank Girl is a a good example of what can happen.

The acting is very acceptable for the genre. The action sequences are spectacular, but are too numerous and simply act as a crutch for the drama. The sets including Berlin locations are excellent. And the plot is actually very good if its more philosophical aspects could have been brought more the fore to dramatically support a story that is a development of  a myriad of snippets from the animations to at least make a story from, remain reasonably suggestive of the animations, for those who have seen the animations, but which have no such storyline, as such.

If failings have to be attributed, it is simply that no clear decision was made about who is the audience for this film. Simply hung on the action, as were the animations for the most part, would have been relentlessly tedious at this length of a film. And to approach it from a dramatic development of the plot, would have demanded a degree of dramatisation well beyond the maker's commitment and/or capability. Ridiculous as it may seem, you would need a dramatist of the capability of Harold Pinter to achieve a worthwhile result, and retain a degree of humour.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sharp-Cut-Harold-Pinter-s-Screenplays-and-the-Artistic-Process/dp/0813122449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sharp Cut: Harold Pinter's Screenplays and the Artistic Process</a>

2511277,3,B000E991HA,"THE PROS: Ms. Theron actually made a decent Aeon; the eyes were right, the hair was close enough, the suit she wore was prefurable over what the original Aeon wore, her voice was pretty close, & it's really not her fault that Aeon seemed out-of-character; she's not the one who wrote the script or changed the story. I liked the inside references to specific episodes & the effort of trying to make sence of the original story by making connections. I also like how the characters who barely lasted 5 minutes before getting killed in the series got a longer role in the movie; that was cute. The special effects fancy moves were appropriate.
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
THE CONS: The movie would have been better if it didn't have the time restrictions of being a single movie. All of that stuff was supposed to happen over years, not a week or less. Despite the inside references, too much new & adultered content was unnessisarily slapped into a movie that already had enough reference material not to need it. There are simply too many changes; it was like watching X-Men after growing up with the comic &/or animated series. I won't say what; some of it is coverd by the Wikipedia, the rest you can find out yourself by watching the series. My other irks were lack of music that really set the mood for the series; the way the hate part of Trevor & Aeon's love-hate relationship was looked over, Aeon being Trevor's long-lost-wife Katherine, Una being related to Aeon, Trevor having a brother, Trevor not having his signature  almost-albino look, the way they hid the fact that Aeon & Trevor are all-around sadistic, not-nice people, the fact that they used the cloning & not Nargals to explain loss of memory, Monika not being a seperate country, & how easily Aeon blew that ship from the sky.",1196467200,,1922,5.082278481012659

2511281,3,B000E991HA,"When I first saw the movie, I was very disappointed. I expected more of the animated series action and plotlines in this film. However, it grew on me. I've rented it, then have seen it a couple of times on the premium cable channels, and I have changed my opinion. Once you break the connection with the animated series, it gets better. Let it stand on its own. Charlize Theron is wonderful as Aeon. She's a woman's action heroine. Her portrayal of a driven well trained freedom fighter who uses her agility, toughness, and wits to survive and get the job done is what brings Aeon into a more fully rounded character. She brings life to Aeon more than the animated series did. Some critics say Theron is more disengaged, but I think it's that the character is focused on one thing and that all else, including her sister and compassion, is put to the side.

The other reason for women to see this is not just that it portrays a very strong woman in a heroic lead role, but it has Martin Csokas. I've had a massive crush on him since his portrayal of Borias in the Xena series. He has an understated acting style here, which is unusual for him (think Edward De Kere in Timeline). Some say it's a one note performance, but I think his subdued characterization of the despot Trevor Goodchild reflects the contemplativeness of Trevor, who feels guilt, remorse, and grief. Some say he's passive, but I say he's thoughtful. Another plus for his character - he allows women to protect and defend him (i.e., Aeon and Freya, his aide) without losing his masculinity. He looks gorgeous! Csokas can give a woman a hot flash (or 20!) for sure.

I also liked Sophie Okonedo as Sithandra. I've always like this actress in everything I've seen her in (Hotel Rwanda, the Jackal, etc.). She doesn't let Theron take over the screen. They are well matched.

Now for the problems. Having a more fully realized script would help. It can't be all art direction and special effects. It looks like a 3-D anime, which it great, but the story has about as many holes as Akira. However, the same complaint was lodged against Blade Runner in 1982 (overdone art direction with little plot development and cliched dialogue) and look at it now. It was a bomb when it came out and 25 years later it's a classic and is considered the best sci-fi movie ever.

Now, four hundred years later, all of humanity lives in a walled-in city named Bregna and are led and monitored by a group of scientists. But not all are happy with this arrangement and a rebel group called Monicans have risen to oppose those in charge.

And Aeon is one of them.

At first glance, the main story of this movie is like many others that have come before: a small band of rebels going up against an oppressive government. But this movie isn't that simple and the aforementioned plot is just what gets us from Point A to B. There are other factors that play into the story, complicated ones, taking what could have just been a B-sci-fi movie all the way to A-level.

Charlize Theron stars as Aeon, the Monicans' cold, stick-to-business top assassin. The intensity she brings to the role drags you in and makes you want to discover what makes her tick. Yet she also has a warm side, but one hidden and numbed by years of training and running top secret errands for her team. Theron put on a wonderful show in the lead.

The supporting cast, though they all did a good job and their characters were believable, were just that: a supporting cast. No one's performance really stood out except maybe Sophie Okonedo as Sithandra (the girl with the hands for feet). She was just plain cold (in that good way).

The special effects are astonishing. There is not a single element in this film that is ""everyday."" Everything was built for it, whether physically or via CGI. The action is astounding, part Matrix and part Underworld.

Quite often, the plot feels like information was left out.  It never does a good job of transitioning from one moment to the other.  In fact, at times it is outright confusing.

The flow of the story uses recycled elements.  There is the bad guy who really isn't the bad guy, the ""I am your father"" type twist (in this case ""I am your wife""), the hero (or heroine) is hunted by the good guys and the bad guys twist, and the real bad guy is trying to gain power twist.

2511297,3,B000E991HA,"Setting aside the technical wizadry that makes ""Aeon Flux"" watchable, this is an ambitious science fiction story that is grounded by its reliance on oppression as its overarching theme. This is the same thing that happened with similar sci-fi flicks including ""The Island"" and ""V For Vendetta"" -- they all revolve around futuristic societies where the action takes place after war or other calamity.

In ""Aeon Flux"" the society is set in 2415 after a plague has taken all but 5 million residents (who all seem beautiful and able to speak English.) They reside inside a walled society that separates them from a world nature has taken over -- similar to ""The Island"", where all the inhabitants tried their best to get to the island without knowing they were stuck inside a tiny little world.

Star Charlize Theron is magnificent in the James Bond-ish lead role as a member of the underground fighting to overthrow the leadership -- not unlike the Zorro-like character in ""V For Vendetta"" whose goal was to topple the totalitarian government in place in England.

Theron gets an assignment to assassinate a member of the ruling party and the action takes a decided turn in another direction. She recalls a previous life with this guy and doesn't kill him. She ends up in prison, escapes, kills some people, meets him again, and finds out more about their collective past -- all in the time it took my wife to go to the bathoroom!

At this point the story changes changes and, without disclosing much, the notion of cloning begins to play a major role. This separates those that want to go backward to the old way (revolutionaries) from those that want to keep things the way they are now (ruling party). I don't recall what happened at the end of the flick so I can't spoil that for you.

""Aeon Flux"" has many fine and involving moments of action and imaginative scenes, has many wonderful sets, is marvelously lit, and benefits from a fine actress in the lead role whose outfits will keep male viewers attached to the screen if not to the storyline. That last thing, the story, becomes a bit bizarre and borders on incoherence once or twice during the telling of the story, so expect to be confused on occasion.

The bottom line: ""Aeon Flux"" is a visual treat and somewhat entertaining as 21st century sci-fi with all its technical details in place. It is neither a film for the ages nor in any way individual compared to other movies of its type that have been made in recent years.

And although Charlize Theron is near genetic perfection and she is definitly a sensual being, big pluses,  you can not make a provacetive scifi action picture in 90 minutes.  The picture lacks to much story to be truly appealing.  In order for the movie to work as it had hoped we need to care about the lead character and care about what she cares about... always an important point in good movie making.  But we are brought into the story and her life much to late to do either.  The filmed which hoped to be heavy, ends up feeling light.  We needed to see what drove her to where she is now and why it is important, we get neither.  Jonny Lee Miller is a menacing villian, very important, but has too little screen time and too little to do to really scare us. But the story just lacks, we need to know why it is so important for Aeon to do what she is doing, why has she become the no. 1 Monicle assasin, and we need to be startled that she has strong emotional feelings for the person she is determinded to kill, we get neither.  I might think budget constrictions had a lot to do with why this picture did not succeed.  All the elements are here for a really good film, but there is not enough film to make it one.  The picture comes of as sort of a modern age ""Logon's run""... ( also not to be crase, but a real love scene with real sexual situations might have help convice us more that there was something deep here).

The story is definitely worthy of the big screen. The 5.1 audio tracks are very clean and captivating. The great HD picture comes through crisp and bright, clean and awesome.

I have never seen the animated series so I have no comments about its similarities, but I consider this film a keeper for the collection that I can watch again in the future and still enjoy it.

""Aeon Flux"" offers a nice variety of well executed, pulse quickening action sequences, coupled with brilliant performances by a great cast. What you end up with is an hour and thirty-two minutes of excellent action-packed film!

2511313,4,B000E991HA,"Ever since I saw Peter Chung's creation mow down piles of enemies with her two Uzis, a leather S&M get up, and little else, I fell in love.  Aeon Flux was bizarre, action-packed, and short on words (actually, almost none at all when she first debuted on Liquid T.V.).  I watched it over and over, I drew Aeon multiple times until I got her right, and the breakneck pace that was established in the film still affects my writing to this day.

So it was with no small trepidation that I approached the Aeon Flux movie.  How could they possibly do justice to a bizarre series that was as much a style as it was a cartoon, alternately ugly and sleekly beautiful all at the same time?

Taking place in 2415, Aeon (Charlize Theron sporting a brunette `do) is an agent of the Monicans.  The Monicans wage a secret war against Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas), a well-meaning despot who struggles to keep the fragile city of Bregna together.  The Earth has long since been devastated by a plague, and there are only five million survivors left in the city. And yet there's something rotten in the city of Bregna, for Trevor's brother Oren (Jonny Lee Miller) is about to stage a coup.

After her sister Una (Amelia Warner) is murdered, Aeon's out for revenge against the supposed despot. Assisting Aeon in her mission of revenge is Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo) who happens to have hands for feet.  And yet when she finally faces her target, Aeon discovers there's something very familiar about Trevor that gives her pause.

Aeon Flux was directed by a woman (Karyn Kusama) and her sensibilities bring a refreshing touch to a genre that is all too muscular, boxy, and grim. Like The Fifth Element, Aeon Flux is an entry in a science fiction genre that avoids the standard futuristic tropes and injects new and bizarre technology into it.  Body modification, as evidenced by Sithandra, is an accepted part of sciety.  Technology is organic, ranging from killer grass to dart guns shaped like beehives, computers made of water to holograms formed of harp-like strings.  All the Monican agents are linked by a telepathic connection that lets them visualize each other in a sort of World Wide Web of the mind. Fashion styles are reminiscent of French couture. A zeppelin computer that looms overhead has all the appearance of a monstrous jellyfish. Even the city looks like a giant carnation from above.

Aeon herself is played with deadly seriousness by Theron, who draws on her ballerina training to adopt a dancer's pose. Her martial arts is as much an art form as it is combat style, and the graceful leaps and jumps that the cartoon version effortlessly executed are much in evidence here; an amazing achievement, given that the original character's proportions barely conformed to reality.

So what's the problem?  Critics lambasted the film, characterizing it as too complicated.  It's difficult for me to agree with them, because fans of the show will know precisely what's going on...and yet the movie wasn't spoiled for me either.  In fact, the biggest flaw of the film is the motive for Oren to ""recycle"" people in the city of Bregna. His ""my way or else"" proposition isn't really justified in the movie's narrative, such that we just have to trust that there's simply no room for compromise between the two ideologies battling it out on screen.  But once you're past that hurdle, the film is as much eye-candy as it is an interesting post-apocalyptic entry into alternative sci-fi.

The backlash on this film is suspicious.  Perhaps it was Theron's Oscar win. Perhaps it's simply that many critics don't like science fiction.  Or perhaps it's that a truly feminist take on a science fiction world makes male reviewers uncomfortable.  Whatever the case, sci-fi fans should definitely give Aeon Flux a chance.",1171152000,3,3803,4.834876543209877

2511315,4,B000E991HA,"It's puzzling why this film was so derided on its original release.  Clearly, it is not a classic, but it is enjoyable enough - one can only think that the media were out to get Charlize Theron after her recent Oscar win.

It is the future - a short time from now a disease wipes out 99% of the population, until Trevor Goodchild finds a cure.  Now as the movie starts it is 400 years later and mankind is reduced to living in one walled city.  However, there is unrest in this Eutopia and resistance has sprung up, of which Aeon is one.  However, events unfold which lead her to question not just her orders but the truth of her very existence.  It's a neat set up, and the story is not as trite as you might expect - it has some genuine unexpected directions and a satisfying conclusion.

If the movie has a flaw, it's that it fails to find much heart - the Eutopia is by its nature pristine and cool, but the acting seems to fall into the same trap so that we don't find much humanity to relate to. This future is not just cool but sexy too - almost like an updated version of the future seen in 'Logans Run'.  If you have seen the movie you might be tempted to see this as a special effects movie, but in fact the effects serve the story well.

All in all a satisfying tale, which is crisply photographed and has a cast and art direction which are very easy on the eye.  I recommend it for an undemanding evenings entertainment where action is desired, but not at the expense of story.",1170547200,2,1489,4.192982456140351

It is sort of kind of a detective ""uncovering the information"" plot, but none of the information uncovered is surprising or even interesting.

You are not told how Aeon Flux gets to be a super ninja babe, and she barely has time to establish herself as one before she has to start revealing her softer feminine side in the stereotypical way these movies require.  None of the characters in this movie are compeling.  They hardly show the bad guys doing bad things so you aren't really all that invested in them getting their comeuppance.  There is no real tension in the movie, there is no last minute saving of anything, and not really that much of a threat that gets overcome.

2511331,4,B000E991HA,"This is a clever adaptation of an MTV animated cartoon series.

I found it more plausible than the original, which is not saying much.

In favour of this movie, the action sequences are stunning, the film is visually one of the most beautiful I have ever scene (partly due to the sets and partly to the lead star, Charlize Theron in the title role). The characters are also more understandable and less morally ambiguous than the MTV original, and the actors brought them to life quite well.

Against this movie, the plot is still pretty implausible and sometimes also hard to follow.

The story is set 500 years from now, after humanity was almost entirely wiped out by a virus in the early 21st century. We are told at the beginning that a Dr Goodchild found the cure which saved the human race from annihilation, and that 500 years later ""the Goodchild regime"" is still in power.

After all that time there are still only 5 million people on earth, all in just one city. This may seem very strange but of the many apparently unlikely things in the story this is one of the few for which the plot does eventually provide an internally consistent explanation.

In the original MTV series there were two or more human nations and the ""Monicans,"" including the title role character, who were often  working against the government of the city where the story is set, were the agents of a rival city.

In this version there is only one city and ""Monicans"" like Aeon Flux are an underground resistance movement against what appears at first to be a highly repressive regime. In the original, the head of state, Chairman Trevor Goodchild, had recently come to power by removing the elected leader, in the film he has been in office for a long time - you'll have to watch it to find out just how long.

Aeon Flux is the principal Monican agent: shortly after the start of the film she gets orders to assassinate Chairman Goodchild. In the process of attempting this mission she finds that the regime holds secrets which are even stranger than she thought, and neither friends nor foe are who she thought they were.

Charlize Theron gets to wear some very strange outfits and mostly very attractive outfits in this film, some of them obviously inspired by the wierd outfits from the original cartoon series, though mostly not as indecent as some of the cartoon costumes were.

Ms Theron looks very good indeed in most of these costumes but they are often ridiculously imappropriate for the missions she is carrying out. For example, who in their right mind would send an agent on a secret mission wearing a bondage costume which will draw every male eye in a millisecond and looks like it belongs on a catwalk?

And what kind of idiot would carry out a night-time infiltration mission to sabotage an ultra-high security installation wearing an all-white outfit ?

The movie also suffers in plausibility from the classic ""Hollywood rules"" of weapon accuracy and ammunition supply. Whenever the good guys fire a weapon they almost always hit what they are shooting at, but when either a bad guy or a computer controlled weapon system shoots at one of the heroes or heroines they almost always miss or hit a non-vital spot. And none of the good guys ever runs out of ammunition until a suitable point in the plot to show them changing a cartridge during a piece of dialogue.

Despite all these implausibilities the film can carry you along and I did enjoy watching it once. But it is probably a film to rent rather than buy.",1163548800,2,3514,4.646774193548387
2511332,3,B000E991HA,"I have a long history of liking trashy movies that other reviewers pillory, for example I love the Resident Evil series. So I was looking forward to Aeon Flux as I still have fond memories of the anarchic blood splattered cartoon series and the cast list boded well. Unfortunately it doesn't really deliver, it's indisputably very stylish with some nice touches, some of the advanced biotech is neat. But it's also extremely clinical with most of the fight scenes being choreographed to death, they're clever, balletic even, but also devoid of any spontaneity and just plain lacking in excitement.

It also suffers from a few whacking great big plot holes and as protagonists, despite all their hi tech wizardry, the Monicans must remain some of the dumbest people in creation. There's a coup in progress, the target has been deposed and their top agent has discovered that something weird is going on. Yet they don't have the common sense to pause and reconsider their strategy, they just add their own agent to the hit list, no questions asked.

An example of the plot inconsistencies is the death of Una Flux, according to the theory when an adult dies a clone is created, implanted and nine months later born to it's surrogate mother. Yet Aeon was able to hold the new-born version of Una within hours of the adult being exterminated, must be the shortest gestation period in human history.

We're also expected to swallow the theory that the dedicated genetic science supremo leader of this utopia is completely oblivious to his idiot younger brother killing off an entire test group. A less observant scientist would be hard to imagine.

Overall, it's not a particularly bad movie. It definitely scores on the eye candy front and isn't even particularly dumb. But when you consider the energy and sheer fun that the cartoon had, the live action movie is curiously torpid. Not a disaster, but it's not going to be on many peoples top ten list.",1163462400,,1948,4.823353293413174

Now, to be fair, eventhough the whole package was wrapped into a better pseudo-clever scheme, Matrix plot's wasn't much newer or deeper... So why the ""decent, if mindless, entertainment"" rating? Well, if you are reading this, I guess you know the answer: Charlize Theron is stunningly beautiful and that movie is build around her body dynamics. You are just looking for a reason to watch her.

I was a fan of the Aeon Flux animations back when they were on MTV. So, with memories of those running through my mind I purchsed the DVD before ever having seen the movie.

When it was over, I just was not left impressed. It felt like a combination of things that left me so... well... unimpressed by the whole thing. For one, the pace of the movie felt very off. The editing can probably be blamed for much of what is wrong with this film. I am a big fan of Ms. Theron, but she played her character very distant - and she did not seem to be able to do this and keep you attentive. Just being the hottest female butt kicker in town is not enough.

The film is set in a far future where there are only a handful of us left in a walled ""utopian"" city. I suspect you won't be more than halfway through the film before you figure out ""The Big Secret"", but I don't have a particular problem with that. It's nice to have clues laid around for us to figure out.

It's not going to go down in the books as a defining moment in the science fiction movie making industry. If your a fan of the Aeon Flux world, this film may have more appeal for you.

2511340,2,B000E991HA,"AEon Flux (Karyn Kusama, 2005)

I'm a very big fan of both Karyn Kusama (Girlfight) and Charlize Theron (Monster). So when I found out that the big-screen adaptation of Peter Chung's wonderful animated series AEon Flux would star Theron and be directed by Kusama, I was hopeful that the film would have some teeth to it. Alas, as everyone in the world but me seemingly knew, I was wrong.

Theron plays the title character, who lives in a world whose five million inhabitants all live in a single city, the world outside having ""gone back to nature."" The city has been ruled by a benevolent dictator for most of those four hundred years, but things have started getting a little weird, and a rebel faction, the Monicans, has sprung up. AEon Flux is a member of the Monican resistance, and she gets an assignment from her handler (Fargo's Frances MacDormand) to assassinate said dictator, Trevor Goodchild (xXx's Martin Csokas). Except that, well, something makes her hesitate, and that something is the vast coincidence upon which the entire film turns. And once you accept that fact that you've been handed a vast coincidence, the whole thing simply falls apart, becoming nothing more than an excuse for a mindless shoot-em-up with all sorts of nifty special effects. (Sophie Okonedo's character, who has had her feet replaced with a second set of hands, is the recipient of, by far, the coolest of the film's effects.)

So, the short answer: the only reason to watch this film has to do with Charlize Theron and a few yards of skintight leather. Which, I admit, could have even made Reds worth watching, really. But be prepared for the fact that Girlfight this ain't. **",1156377600,,1671,4.795138888888889
2511341,2,B000E991HA,"Charlize Theron stars in the live action adaption of the Aeon Flux animated series, which originally was on MTV. Here on Australia, the animated series was on really late on a station called SBS, so I've only caught a couple of episodes. It looked interesting, and I thought the adaption might be worth a look. Wasn't as good as I'd expected though.

Set a few centuries forward into the future, most of mankind has been wiped out by viruses, and wild jungle has reclaimed the planet. The remainder of humanity resides in a city, heavily controlled and plagued, not by viruses, but by mysterious disappearances and memories that haunt the minds of its citizens in dreams. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) is part of a resistance group, determined to have more freedom than they have. Aeon's own resistance becomes all the stronger when her sister is killed by the government. She sets out into the heart of the city, and stumbles on much more than she bargained for, including a lover she never knew she had.

I must say I liked the look of the film, and the sets and such were probably what I liked best about the whole thing, a good combination of slick civilization and the lush green of the surrounding jungles and gardens. But looks aren't everything. Even though the film was a modest hour and a half, due to the straight faced dialogue and heavy seriousness over everything, it felt like much, much longer. Seemed to drag, despite the action there didn't seem to be a lot that actually happened. I can understand why the dialogue was the way it was, it adds to the unnatural atmosphere of the city, and it's similar to the way the dialogue is done in the animation, but a bit of humour and warm emotion would have been nice.

Special features include two audio commentaries and five behind the scenes featurettes which include footage from the original MTV series. It was good to see the comparison between the film and the cartoon. In making the film, you can see that they have tried to recreate the feel of the film. On the other hand, it doesn't quite capture the more bizarre elements of the animation, which is what made the original series so unique, I reckon.

As much as I like science-fiction, and as much as I liked the look of the film, I can't say I liked or recommend this film. Have a look at something else, the original Aeon Flux animated series, even.",1156032000,,2371,4.5717647058823525

Charlize's light is hidden under the bushel of a director who evidently thinks a story can be told without requiring any emotion from the characters. Aeon (Theron) and all the other main characters are flat and awfully boring. The simplistic story about the evils of cloning seems much longer than its 92 minutes. The fight sequences are heavily edited, just so much smoke and shadow -- no real martial arts expertise. Skip Aeon Flux and give Ultraviolet a try.

When you see Charlize Theron acting and running all over the place, you're gonna be like, ""dang, look at that girl run and act!  She means business!""  And indeed she does mean business.

If Aeon Flux had to battle Aileen Wuornos, I would bet on Aeon Flux, because she totally kicks A, and can make blades of grass bend in a very cool way.  Meanwhile Aileen Wuornos' powers are simply a confused sexual identity and an ever-present rage against men.  Neither of which can do anything to affect blades of grass, so....go Aeon.

Overall, it's an okay film to rent.  If you're a Charlize Theron fan but not a sci-fi fan, skip this one.  If you like sci-fi, I'd reccomend renting before buying.  IMHO, it's not a movie that would bear repeated viewing.",1153699200,2,495,4.373626373626373

I've seen more humanity expressed in the the robots/cyborgs from Lost in Space, The Hitchhiker's Guide, and Bladerunner.  In Aeon Flux, the emotive level reaches, say, the level of I, Robot, starring Will Smith.

In other words, a turnip.

Okay, I can appreciate the energy in the stunts, which really is the central part of this movie.  The story, in theory, is interesting (""400 years in the future, after a virus decimates the world population, only one city on Earth remains"").  In ""reality,"" with one walled city, where does all of the food come from?  The concrete?  The energy?  The steel?  Technology is a bit more more complex than just putting up a wall and having everything you need.

The twists in the plot are such that I really had to watch it again a few days later.  Who knew who and how?  What has been happening for 400 years?  How come the secret is known to such a select few?  Why doesn't the populace question the killings and disappearances?

This is a movie to watch for the action.  You won't find any Tomb Raider dialogue here, or James Bond dalliances.

2511351,3,B000E991HA,"I have vague recollections about back in the day (the early to mid 1990s I believe) when Aeon Flux, created by Peter Chung, appeared on MTV as a segment within the series `Liquid Television'...while my memory's a bit fuzzy, two aspects about the Aeon Flux segments have stayed with me over the years, the first being how stylish they appeared and the second being how confusing they seemed...(perhaps had I seen all the episodes in their respective order it'd be different).  Fast forward some ten odd years later to the 2005 release of a live action adaptation written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, both of whom worked on The Tuxedo (2002), directed by Karyn Kusama (Girlfight), and starring Academy Award winner Charlize Theron (The Astronaut's Wife, Reindeer Games, Monster).  Also appearing is Marton Csokas (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, xXx), Jonny Lee Miller (Mindhunters), Sophie Okonedo (Hotel Rwanda), Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects), and Academy Award winner Frances McDormand (Darkman, Fargo)...I'm curious how much MTV, who produced the film, had to shell out for two Academy Award winning actresses to appear in this feature...

As the film, set sometime in the 25th century, begins, we learn how a virus wiped out most of the world's population some four hundred years earlier before a scientist named Goodchild finally found a cure.  Now it seems the descendants of those who survived live in a walled city under the thumb of the Goodchild Dynasty, which has ruled since the catastrophic event.  As with any society there is a group of malcontents, known here as the Monicans, whose main goal appears to be in toppling the Goodchild regime...why?  As near as I can figure they're upset with the fact that it's not unusual for people to just up and disappear, never to be heard from again, something the Monicans think the gooberment is directly responsible for (and they'd be right)...anyway, in furthering their cause, the Monicans utilize secretive, highly deadly operatives, the most skilled being Aeon Flux (Theron).  After successfully completing her current assignment, she's given the one she's been waiting been waiting for, the elimination of Trevor Goodchild (Csokas), the current leader of the Goodchild regime.  While infiltrating the gooberment facility where Goodchild resides, things turn sour and Aeon begins to question those things she originally believed, which ends up leading to an unlikely alliance.  Turns out there is something seriously wrong with the population, the answers lying within a funky zeppelin known as the Relical, which continually circles above the city.  As a power struggle within the gooberment ensues, Aeon finds herself stuck in the middle as both the Establishment, who see her as a threat, and the Monicans, who see her as a traitor, want her dead, resulting in a struggle for survival that may ultimately decide the fate of mankind...

Overall I thought this film entertaining, but it does have some flaws.  I thought the production values excellent especially in terms of the futuristic settings and such (the `stylish' element I spoke of earlier in terms of the original series seems to have made it into the film).  I also really liked all the nifty little high tech gadgets and implants utilized mainly by Theron's character, although I thought it interesting how, by the end, everyone fell back to using what appeared to be fairly standard projectile based weaponry (I guess some things never change).  As far as Theron herself, she displayed quite a bit of athleticism, some of which I'm sure was probably helped along by the special effects department, while looking fairly sweet in her numerous, skintight outfits (actually, with her Der Fuhrer-esque hairstyle and black clothing, she sort of came off as the ultimate Emo chick, but whatever).  I think the biggest issue I had with the film was the performances seemed somewhat flat, but I'm unsure if it was a result of the actors, the director, or the material (some of the cast is just plain wasted, like Frances McDormand...what was the deal with her character and that ridiculous red hair?).  Also, Theron didn't really come off as the ultimate assassin, at least when comparing her to the character presented in the original animated series, despite a good effort.  I learned quite a few things from this film including the following...

1. Charlize Theron can catch flies with her eyelashes, which is kinda cool but also kinda gross.

2. In the future the predominant hairstyle for men is the greasy bed head look.

3. In the future secret messages are passed amongst people by French kissing.

4. Charlize Theron can kill with her thighs (which wouldn't be too bad of a way to go, if you ask me).

5. People in the future are stuck with really weird names like Oren, Una, Sithandra, and Aeon.

6. In the future you can actually get your feet replaced with hands, which looks as creepy as it sounds.

7. The Future is so Goth.

8. In the future authorities are armed with highly advanced weaponry and have no problems using said weaponry to mow down innocent bystanders to get to two criminals.

9. In the future when you get a phone call, your ears flash (no foolin').

10. In the future when they say `keep off the grass' they ain't kidding.

11. Despite a dumb hairdo Charlize Theron can still look hot, which isn't so much the case with Frances McDormand.

12. Fluidic ball bearings can not only be trained to come on command but also to assemble in patterns and explode.

13. Recycling is taken to a whole new level in the 25th century.

14. Politicians in the future are just as skeevy and conniving as they are now.

One aspect of the story that kind of bothered me was how the Monicans seemed to have a technological edge over the established gooberment.  They were able to infiltrate various facilities with relative ease (razor grass sounds like an effective security measure, that is until you get someone who comes along with platform shoes), keep things hidden on their person while in custody, and just generally outfox the authorities at nearly every turn.  The film does have lots of action, slick production values, a decent catfight, and I had little difficulty in following the story (what of it there was), but I couldn't say how closely this finished product resembled the original material.

The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks very sharp and the audio, available in both Dolby Digital 5.1 surround and Dolby Surround 2.0 comes across well.  Extras include two feature length commentary tracks, one with star Charlize Theron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, the second with co-writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, five featurettes involving production of the movie, a theatrical trailer, a couple of previews, and English and Spanish subtitles.

2511352,2,B000E991HA,"and a lot less than you should get for the price (about $20 when I wrote this).  People who liked the series have probably already seen the movie and been disappointed, but it still has the potential to disappoint a general audience, too.

The movie suffers from problems that would doom any movie.  There is a lack of character development, in particular, a lack of explanation for characters' motives.  For example, and trying not to be a spoiler, one character explains that he wants to die simply by saying ""I'm tired.""  Why he's tired, when he hasn't suffered any more than anyone else, really, and less than most, is unclear.  Other characters are killed before we even get to know them, which makes the survivors' over-the-top dedication to them seem a little ridiculous.

The second problem are the plot holes.  I know a certain suspension of disbelief is required for this sort of movie.  But, as the many unanswered questions from my date made clear to me, often the characters seem to just be making random choices.  Why blow this or that up?  Why disobey orders NOW?  Why isn't any of the bad guys' technology worth a damn?

That brings us to the third problem: it isn't a very interesting vision of the future.  The series had the advantage of actual conflict creating actual drama.  The movie gives Aeon such a massive advantage that you never question the outcome of any particular situation.  She solves all of them in exactly the same way.  even Schwartzenegger flicks have him do something creative once in awhile.  Aeon just shoots or kicks people to death.  Often using the same few moves.  Worse, the bad guys' tech choices are just odd.  Why use razor sharp grass when it is plainly ineffective (there are paths nearby and nobody gets seriously injured even after getting cut)?  Why aren't there any alarms?  Why does the bad guy's stuff just automatically work for Aeon, even when its supposed to be a security device?  When the future's tech is less effective than our own, you know there is a lack of vision somewhere.

I grant that the special effects are pretty cool.  They still can't save this movie.  It doesn't even work as a good piece of eye candy because the cool special effects sequences are frequently separated by boring, rather conventional scenes.  I think what happened is the writers grabbed some cool scenes from the series and then just strung them together, using random chunks of story to make them fit together.

What you get here is just some Hollywood hacks trying to capitalize on an old series that they didn't really get.  The result for non-fans of the original is just a crummy movie, and for fans, a travesty.  This flick is a straight up rip.  I gave 2 stars because there were still some cool scenes.",1153180800,5,2757,4.679166666666666

2511355,4,B000E991HA,"""Aeon Flux"" could have been so much that the movie was not, but I wonder if the movie really sucked as bad as some would say. Was it a classic sci-fi in the league of ""Star Wars"", ""The Matrix"" or others? No. On the other hand, it was not that bad either, to be honest.

The premise is that about 99% of all humanity has been wiped out in a great plague and that there is only one city left: Bregna. In Bregna, people live in a healthy, utopian dream and they never venture outside the walls. The city is ruled by one family, the Goodchilds, who rule in benevolent guidance and look after everyone. Or so it seems. The Monicans are the resistance to the Goodchilds and work acts of violence and destruction.

This movie has some definite things going for it, besides Charlize Theron in some very revealing clothing. The action sequences are excellent, and they are of the highest quality. On this basis alone, ""Aeon Flux"" could hold its own against most other films with fight sequences in them. The action is also fairly high paced, with few periods of dry or dull monotony.

The special effects are also excellently executed, and worth a look. The creativity of different weapons and gadgets would satisfy most Trekkies, I think. The advanced technology portrayed was not so different from our own time, with some recognisable items there. However, it was different enough to give you something of the unreal and dreamlike.

The striking thing for this viewer was the contrast between the frenetic intensity of the Monicans with their drive to rebel, and the mindless acceptance of everything by the majority of the population. Later in the movie, even this contrast is shattered when Aeon Flux starts to question the mission that she is sent on by the Monican Handler. Black and white/Them and us start to take on a more blurred aspect, complicating a simple dichotomy of friend and foe. The movie succeeds in raising some issues for thought.

I thought the ending was a bit simplistic and corny. If I had a criticism of the movie, that would be it. I was left feeling a little less than satisfied with the way that the movie resolved itself. However, taken overall, I would have to say that this is more than counterbalanced by the earlier parts of the movie.

In short, be cautious if you are buying it, I would not watch it a lot of times, but it is worth a couple of viewings, at least. I would not be shy on the hiring side of it, and see what you think. It may not be your thing, but I definitely enjoyed it.",1152748800,,2516,4.506578947368421
2511356,4,B000E991HA,"With special effects and action superseding characterization, Aeon Flux makes for a fast-paced futuristic trip to the 25th century.  There's a definite ""cool"" factor to the whole thing, what with all sorts of ingenious futuristic gizmos and Charlize Theron's nifty little outfit, and the story, which is not exactly straightforward, does tie everything together in the end, but this just didn't feel like a complete movie experience to me.  This comes partly from the fact that the movie basically drops you into the middle of an unusual story without really providing you with a guide map at the start, but it has even more to do with the fact that the characters in this film are rather robotic.  The main character, Aeon Flux (Theron), is basically a terrorist, so it's a little hard to sympathize with her early on - especially since you have no way of judging the government or its leader, Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas).  When personal feelings do finally work their way into the story, they really aren't that dramatic at all.  Rather than explore anyone to any great depth, the director just keeps diverting our attention with special effects.

Here's the backdrop for this story: in 2011, some disease wiped out 99% of the human population before a scientist was able to find a cure for it.  This scientist basically built a large walled city to house all of those he was able to save - and no one has been outside the walls in the last four centuries.  The Monicans, an underground group of terrorists and assassins, want their true freedom (and seem to be the only folks concerned by the fact that random people just keep disappearing out of the blue) and have decided that the Goodchild regime has to go.  Since Aeon Flux is their top assassin, she is given the task of assassinating Trevor Goodchild.  If you're thinking that 25th century security must surely be better than its modern-day equivalent, think again - Aeon basically just has to avoid some spiky grass and dart-shooting coconuts (and, if you're wondering, the ""bad guys"" of the future still can't hit the broad side of a barn).  Once Aeon comes face to face with Goodchild, everything changes for reasons she herself really doesn't understand.  As if things weren't complicated enough already, you also have a coup d'etat thrown in the mix.

It takes a while for the viewer to find out what is really going on here, as the film is more concerned with showing off fancy special effects and superhuman abilities than it is in giving us a tightly-wound plot.  I for one would have liked to get at least a cursory look at this futuristic society and better insight into the main characters.

2511360,1,B000E991HA,"This movie was a waste of time, effort, and money.  It was so god-awful that I was amazed (not in a good 'B-movie' or Troma pictures way, either).  The only positive I can offer is the star is attractive, the graphics were interesting, and some of the intriguing core elements of the cartoon came up briefly.

I am a fan of the Aeon Flux cartoon, cartoons in general, and I'm a huge scifi fan.  Go buy a good film & save your money & time -- here's a bunch I'd recommend: 'Hardware', 'Strange Days', 'Blade Runner', 'Silent Running', 'They Live', 'Donnie Darko', 'Time Bandits', 'The City of Lost Children', 'A Boy & His Dog', 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', 'The Hidden', 'Solaris', 'Gattaca', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Altered States', or even 'Alien'.

This film could have been done well, but was not.  There were some shots where even the lighting was bad.  Getting basic lighting done right is not rocket science or art, it's just basic production.  Production value, along w/a good script and good editing, is what this film LACKED.

Regardless of how bad of a 'smeller' this movie was, it DID inspire me to go out and make movies!  I mean, if someone can get paid to make a P.O.S. like this, I will be making $$$ hand over fist!!!

2511362,3,B000E991HA,"In the great scheme of things, this movie is hardly a blip on the radar.

The costumes are fairly unique. The fact that the sun is shining in a post apocolyptic world is novel. The storyline forces you to reason parts of why certain things happen are only because they are in the script.

Charlize looks pretty doing wirework. She's a trained ballet dancer and it shows - but there is nothing ground breaking here in the way of special effects.

Still, if you can suspend every fiber of disbelief you own, it's an okay movie. Fun summer fluff with a pretty girl in tight clothes. Lots of butt-kicking and a sappy love story thrown in to appease the women folk who like that sort of thing.

I would say it's worth the purchase, if you don't have to pay new release prices for it.",1151798400,3,778,4.344827586206897
2511363,1,B000E991HA,"First off, no comparisons between the film and the MTV cartoon.  They're related, inexorably; you draw your own, deeply personal parallels and comparisons.  Me, I think it's irrelevant.

Second, I liked the supporting character casting.  How great to see Frances McDormand outside of a Coen Brothers movie, with that wicked red hair--very cool.  Really enjoyed seeing Pete Postlethwaite in this, despite the old-guy make-up and prosthetics.  It's always so great to hear his voice, and look into those deep, sincere eyes, set inside that contradictory mug.  And Johhny Lee Miller.  It took me the ending credits to finally tag him as ""Trainspotting's"" Sick Boy, and I enjoyed him in this work.

And that's the extent of my enjoyment.  My only comment upon this film's conclusion was that I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater.

The Theron costuming was ridiculous, strikingly unsexy and contradictory to the story.  She's attacking one of the most closely guarded facilities in the city, at night, and she's wearing an all-white bodysuit.  The hair is distracting, looking like a despondent Alfalfa most of the time.

Overall, the F/X weren't inspiring or impressive, not at all.  I mean, seriously, the jungle landscape at the end looks like that super-cheezy Montezuma pyramid backdrop painting at the end of ""From Dusk 'Til Dawn.""  The chicky fights look exactly like what they are: gymnastics-on-wire, all spinning and floating.

She's the best agent ever, yet she's constantly in need of everyone's help to get her out of jams and to help her complete her mission.  Everyone fears her, but it seems she can't get anything done.

She's the greatest agent ever, yet her baby sister knows all about her activities as a rebel.  How's that for solid operational security?

The Council has surveillance everywhere--everywhere!--and yet Aeon and her partner infiltrate the inner sanctum without any real problem, just more sexy wire-gymnastics.  And not one alarm goes off; no guards are alerted.  Seems they don't even have cameras to monitor these incredibly sensitive areas.

At the end, Aeon, Trevor, and evil brother Oren all get shot, but the dozens and dozens and dozens of evil guards/troopers never land a shot on any one of them. All three main characters go down, heavily wounded, until the script tells them to get up, run, and do something conclusive. The evil guards manage to kill all three Monican snipers, hundreds of feet away, but when it comes time to shoot down either Trevor or Aeon, they're predictably incapable; it's just sad, stock, laughable Hollywood pan-n-slow-mo of Aeon in her cool outfit with the casings spinning, mowing them down as they stand pretty for her.

And Aeon destroys the Relicle.  How is it that in 400+ years, no one, no rebel had ever boarded it before?  Seemed to be relatively easy, again with no security, no monitoring whatsoever.  How is it they'd never shot it down, since weapons and training don't seem to be a problem for the rebels?  How is it no one else knows what its functions are?  What absolutely stark raving idiot of a government chief executive chose to store the collected DNA repository of all living human beings in a Goodyear blimp with gold taffeta trendrils flying in circles over the city?  How is this a common-sensical security decision? I think an underground vault would be a smarter move.

And Aeon somehow has freed everyone because she's killed the DNA library and now everyone has to really die?  Like just destroying the Relicle puts it all to rest?  Hello, the DNA is standing around you in the city streets gawking at the spectacle, and the scientific knowledge to continue the cloning program is common.  Yes, there's that long sought after regime change, but the only change in the dynamic is enlightened leadership allowing natural procreation, the path out of the dark and into a new dawn for humanity.

And the big wall gets all smashed down and there's that wild jungle outside.  Gosh, I didn't get that symbolism at all.  Say, why don't you just glue that symbol to a two-by-four and hit me over the head with it, so I'll really REALLY get the point.

Bottom line:  This is not the cartoon--which was better in every way--and one shouldn't expect it to be.  If you're looking for mindless violence, then you've got it, but there is a lot better and more original out there than this.  If you want hard, reasonably logical sci-fi, this isn't it. If you're looking for ultra-sexy, then this won't scratch that itch either.  But if you're a fanatically loyal Charlize fan, then this is just for you.

Plot: Set in the future, only one populated city remains on Earth. Outside the high walls surrounding Bregna is only wilderness. Everything appears idyllic on the surface except for one disturbing fact. People suddenly disappear now and then and the governing ""Congress of Scientists"" refuse to do anything to resolve the mystery. There is a growing faction of dissidents within the city known as the Monican's who want to know why, Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron)is one of them. When it becomes personal Aeon Flux decides to find out what's behind it all.

2511367,2,B000E991HA,"Aeon Flux, the movie and the character, bare little resemblance to the cult animation featured on MTV's Liquid Television in the 1990s. The more you enjoyed the animation, the less you will like this film.

However, the production elements are truly amazing. The sets and costumes are all eye popping. The film also explores some fun futuristic concepts like telepathic message pills, plants engineered as weapons, and liquid memory pools. If you enjoyed the art direction of ""I, Robot"" and ""The Island"", you will enjoy looking at this film too.

While Charlize Theron is one of the most beautiful actresses of today, she's simply miscast. In the animation, Aeon Flux is a lithe sinewy gymnast composed of harsh angles. Miss Theron is simply too curvy to play such a sculpted boney-butt warrior. Her voluptuous body, combined with sloppy wire-work combine to make some acrobatics that simply impossible to believe. Another problem is that in the animation, Aeon was mostly an enigma. Here, they flesh her out with a love story that really doesn't work.

If you've never heard of Aeon Flux, you may have a moderately good time. It's one of those movies that you can ""fold clothes to"" -- mildly engaging, but certainly won't require your full attention.",1151193600,9,1251,4.976076555023924

Being a huge fan of the world of ""Aeon Flux"" I found this incarnation to be a great hommage to the classic Aeon Flux character.  While the story was ""nothing new"", it worked well with the characters and gave Aeon and Trevor a back history that had been previously left blank.  Charlize's performance was wonderful as well; Ms. Theron filled out that her suit like a true champ.

The true beauty of the film was the art direction.  The world of Bregna was truly realized in true life.  It's insistance on using natural beauty over industrial was a true genius to the art team.  And major props to the costume team.

The extra on the DVD are also well done.  With lots of featurettes for the fan in all of us to indulge and enjoy over and over again.  I won't hold my breath for ""Aeon Flux 2"" but at least I have this gem to treasure.",1151107200,18,908,4.226744186046512

2511370,1,B000E991HA,"Aeon Flux lives far in the future.  Unhappy with the government, a radical group called the Monicans revolts by sly and secretive means.  An assassin for the Monicans, Aeon Flux is given an all-important mission that could deliver to her the vengeance she has yearned for over so many years.

This movie presents an interesting concept and might even have been watchable, had acting glitches and predictable outcomes not littered the film.

My first complaint: the plot.  The idea of a futuristic and perfect civilization catches attention, but the story that is placed against this backdrop is positively sickening.  The twists, turns, and realizations (I can't go into them without ruining the movie for anyone that doesn't heed my warning) are so predictable as to become painfully corny.  In addition, the revelations that are supposed to make the audience root for the revolutionaries and hate the government aren't very convincing.  You find yourself wondering what was so bad with the civilization in the first place.

Complaint Number Two: the pacing.  All the ""important"" and plot-making dialogues are crammed in between random fight scenes and long shots of Charlize Theron in skimpy outfits.  It's as though the director was trying to attract viewers not with the plot or movie itself, but with the lure of Charlize Theron in some beaded and very revealing concoction.

Complaint Three: acting and casting.  Let's just say that some of the oh-so-serious scenes had me giggling out of pure amusement.  Moving on....

Acting/Casting, Plot, and Pacing make this movie a sinker.

1-Star - Please don't watch this.",1150761600,6,1620,5.149425287356322
2511371,3,B000E991HA,"In the future, a lethal disease kills off 99% of the population and what's left of humanity is gathered in the cloistered city of Bregna. Hundreds of years later, Bregna has become a ""perfect"" and sanitized Eden, run by an authoritarian regime. But, of course, every paradise has its infestation and the same is true here. There's something not quite right with the citizens of Bregna; they are plagued with troubling dreams and are gripped with a feeling of unsettledness. Enter Aeon Flux, the most capable and lethal agent of the resistance group aiming to overthrow the government. She is sent to assassinate Trevor Goodchild, the current leader of the ruling establishment. But the seemingly straightforward mission quickly goes awry and Aeon finds herself immersed in an insidious conspiracy centuries old, of which scope threatens to undermine the very bedrock of Bregna's ideal society.

So we're back in that old ""been here, done that"" standby of the Utopian world with a fatal flaw. And yet, Aeon Flux is better than I thought it would be. Admittedly, I didn't know what to expect going into this one. I'd seen (and liked, in a bemused sort of way) some of the weird MTV Aeon Flux cartoons of the 1990s, and those shows struck me at the time as being non-linear, bizarre and angular in animation. For one thing, every single episode I saw had our sexy assassin dying. So I was curious to see how the live action film would be interpreted. I gotta admit, I was sold with the very cool opening scene of Aeon's eyelashes Venus-flytrapping a fly.

The overall impression I have of the movie is one of aesthetic sleekness. It's visually arresting, with a semi arty-farty approach that recalls to mind The Fifth Element, in terms of its overall design and look. I like the way the filmmakers integrated nature with the futuristic sci-fi elements (Aeon and Sithandra evading literal ""blades"" of grass and tree pods shooting out deadly slivers; Big Brother implementing water in the use of surveillance technology). The special effects are astounding and original looking and alone make the film worth screening. I both liked and got creeped out by Sithandra's four handlike appendages.

Unfortunately, the plot is nothing new. And being nothing new, it  commits the unforgivable sin of being dull. The action scenes are fairly trite but are beautifully executed, thanks in large part to the beauty, grace and athleticism of the lead star. She certainly is a credit to the recent slew of butt-kicking females coming out in our media (Buffy, Elektra, Lara Croft, Resident Evil's Alice). Charlize worked out for about 4 months and performs 95% of her own stunts, and that contributes to the film's integral credibility. It's also heartening to witness three females handling the brunt of the action here. The acting...is okay. No one sucks, no one stands out. Because the nature of her internalized character calls for it, Charlize has to come from a minimalist standpoint, acting-wise; her expressive, luminous eyes instead do a lot of emoting. I believe Charlize also is pretty close with her tonal mimicry of Denise Poirier, the voice of the animated Aeon Flux. However, the great Frances Mcdormand is totally wasted in her role as the rebel handler.

Special features are comprised of:  2 commentaries (one by the screenwriters, the other by Charlize Theron and producer Gale Anne Hurd); ""Creating A World: Aeon Flux"", the obligatory ""making of"" documentary, which includes input from creator Peter Chung; a segment on the various locations wherein the film was shot; a stunts documentary breaking down the workout regimen of Charlize and the two other action-oriented actresses; ""Craft of the Set Photographer"", which details the still photographer's job and tools of the trade; and the movie trailer.

It's too bad the box office result doesn't seem to warrant a sequel. Aeon Flux has flaws, but Charlize Theron proves to me that she has that certain heroine quality and certainly the physicality to have Aeon Flux become a franchise of Paramount Pictures. Great Godfrey, the sight of Charlize Theron in her futuristic scanties is almost worth the price of the dvd alone.",1150761600,2,4176,5.0
2511372,4,B000E991HA,"Okay, so its another sci-fi action with a female lead.  These sci-fis tend to fizzle at the box office (see Cat Woman, Elektra and Underworld).  The only ones in recent memory that cracked the $100 million mark is Angelina's Tomb Raider 1 & 2.  But that came with a set audience.  The game was accessible, far more so than the original MTV Aeon Flux animated series, which had only built up a cult following.

Translating something so dark and alternative was always going to be a challenge.  Not going the black vinyl and leather look of The Matrix and perpetual rain and gloom of Bladerunner, The Crow and any Batman was a welcome change.

Sure, it took a while to get into the story and the plot was only revealed half way through but at the end everything falls into place.  I have not seen the original Aeon Flux MTV series, just snippets and what I have seen reminds me a lot of The Animatrix and 2000 AD.

But if you're an original Aeon Flux fan, then give this movie a chance.  Understand that in most Hollywood quarters the bottom line in profits and returns is what counts and some producers have to toe the line if they want a movie made. (Hence Bladerunner's watered down ending).

So, in this version of Aeon Flux the producers have had to find a medium between being faithful to the source and at the same time being accessible to the general public.

The budget was not huge and there was minimal CGI but the action sequences were excellent.  Although there should have been more.

Charlize should stand above the other female action leads.  This is better than Elektra, Catwoman and Underworld.  I enjoyed Underworld and hey, Kate Beckinsale in skintight leathers is hot, but the doom and gloom (which seems to be a constant in any vampire/werewolf movie) was just too much.

All in all, Aeon Flux was more hit than miss.",1150588800,,1837,4.5349544072948325
2511373,4,B000E991HA,"If you're suspicious of a shoot-em-up SF action flick by a female director, don't be. This one is as fast and as furious as any other around. And it's better looking than most, and it makes better use of the female leads.

There's some kind of a plot to this movie, if you pay attention to such things: some far future place, the last enclave of mankind. A terrible plague nearly wiped out humanity, and an equally terrible cure nearly finished the job by sterilizing the survivors. Society sustains itself by recycling DNA - cloning people, and maintaining the population by replacement as the old copies die. There may, however, be a cure for the cure, a way to reverse the sterility and restart the genetic Mixmaster. A power struggle ensues, with the tyrants who like being themselves again and again trying to quash the discovery.

Enter Aeon, codename for the super-assassin-babe (Charlize Theron). She'll take out an armed and armored platoon bare handed and never muss a single spike of her sabertooth bangs. That's about it, really, lots of running around and go-boom, with pretty women. Pretty women with their clothes on, if it matters to you. One thing that sets it apart from others in its class, like The 'Matrix', is the pace of action. Where 'The Matrix' alternated set-piece action sequences and breathing space, this one sustains the energy level better. Maybe it doesn't peak as high, but it keeps a thundering pace. And, according to the extras, Theron and the other leads did nearly all their own stunts. If there's one thing cooler than a hot babe, it's a hot babe who can do stuff.

The locations deserve special mention. They're convincingly futuristic, which makes a pretty disappointing statement about our sense of the future. All those high tech, way cool pieces of architecture actually exist and have mundane use: an animal shelter, an urban water supply, a crematorium, or a wind tunnel dating back half a hundred years. The coolest location, the one I was sure had to be sound-stage carpentry, was an 18th century church. What can I say? The future just isn't what it used to be.

It has great action, a great look, and great female leads. If you have a fourteen year old boy anywhere in your spirit, let it see this movie. (And no, you don't have to be male to have a fourteen year old boy somewhere inside.)

2511374,2,B000E991HA,"It's crazy because Aeon Flux is the first movie I've seen where the beginning feels like the end. When Aeon Flux was released I read reviews saying that if you've never seen the anime series that this is a hard movie not only to understand but also to sit through since you don't really know that much about it's past. This film feels like it's bringing closure to it's fans and all that says is that it's only for fans. Besides the fact that I attempted to watch this movie a little blind somehow it started to get a little boring and it wasn't because of the story. As much as I love Charlize she played this character too stiff. The rest of the cast was very weak especially Trevor (Marton Csokas) and I thought he would play the part pretty good.

In the beginning they do their best to let newcomers know what's going on in the films past and present, they do a pretty good job informing and you're not all that in the dark. Aeon Flux's intelligence and cinematography actually start to exceed the actor's talents and it becomes a little hard for them to handle. The camera angles could have been a lot better, a lot of times your missing good fight scenes because the camera is somewhere else other than the action. Overall Aeon Flux could have been done better than this; it's missing a lot of key elements. The story is very appealing but this film missed the potential the live action movie should have. What really makes this movie a little good is the beautiful scenes of the future. The fight scenes were Ok but like I said earlier the camera angles killed them.",1149984000,,1574,4.40893470790378

Charlize Theron slips into skin tight leather as the acrobatic heroine/assassin on a mission to overthrow an oppressive regime, I think.  The story of the film takes a back seat to the visuals and to Theron who sleepwalks her way throughout the film's running time, but you'd hardly notice because she looks so damned good.  The action and special effects are nicely done, but the film's incoherent storyline, wasted cast (Frances McDormand and Johnny Lee Miller are wasted beyond belief), and otherwise surprisingly tepid direction from Girlfight director Karyn Kusama make Aeon Flux a film that's strictly for fans of modern, empty sci-fi; and even fans of the anime series that it hardly resembles may find it hard to enjoy.",1149811200,6,956,4.925465838509317

Over 400 years in the future the remnants of mankind live in one city lorded over by Trevor Goodchild who may or may not be working to save humanity.  Aeon is a rebel assigned to kill him but can't due to strange memories and feelings.  The plot revloves around her getting the answers as to why this is.

We'll hit the positives first.  Charlize Theron looks good jumping around in skin tight outfits.  Her hair, while not Aeon's signature (ram's horns?) hairdo, was a decent compromise and actually looked pretty sexy.  Set design and locations were top notch and the special effects were hip.  All the action was pretty action packed and only got completely unbelievable in a couple of spots.  As a sci-fi popcorn muncher, not to shabby.  But...

The not so positive aspects may bring you down if you're looking for more.

The plot, while passable, would really have been OK as a 30 minute cartoon, but stretched to 90 minutes became monotonous.  Aeon's wardrobe, while skin tight, was nowhere near as racy as cartoon Aeon's.  Its sad that the cartoon could be so much sexier than a live action movie.  What was up with the PG-13 rating anyway.  One of the hallmarks of the animated show was its more adult themes and highly intelligent (and sometimes impossible) plots.  Oh, well.  If you happen to be a fan of animated Aeon then you probabaly love animated Trevor Goodchild as well.  This version is a wishy washy substitute compared to cool animated Trevor.  Some of the acting was a bit under par as well.  In one scene I couldn't tell if Aeon and Trevor were dispassionate about the subject or if the actors themselves were just bored.

So, good action, effects and backdrops, but low plot, acting and sexiness.  Worth a viewing but then go back and watch the animated show for the real thing maybe.",1149206400,3,1943,4.575581395348837

2511381,4,B000E991HA,"I didn't know anything about MTV series.  Regardless, I enjoyed the movie and it does have good entertainment value.  It's about what a would-be perfect world could entail and how science and medicine could make it but with certain lasting effects.  What happens when you combine Rebels with government and they have a past that they can't/don't remember and what can happen when they do.  No this movie doesn't give itself away in the begining which means you have to follow the story and have some sort of an attention span.

By the way, this is a FANTASY/SCI FI style movie.  SO, if you don't enjoy that style of book or movie than don't get this and if you did buy it (and don't like fantasy/sci-fi style, than don't waste our time with bad comments, just take it at face value.)",1149120000,4,783,4.5177304964539005

This DVD is well done.  The surround sound is excellent. It is about the best done of any DVD I have watched. The special features are ""the making of"" type.  I'm not really into that.  If you have seen one ""making of"" video, you have seen them all.  We all know how blue and green screen works.  We understand animation.  If you are huge movie buff or really love this movie, you will probably get into this.

In spite of what some say, this is your typical sci fi, future society coping after armageddon type movie.  400 years after a virus wipes out most of the earth, the ancestors of the survivors live in tightly controlled society.  People mysteriously disappear and there is a group of rebels fighting for freedom.

The story has a neat plotline and some interesting twists.  The only problem is that the characters and plotline are poorly realized. So, the twists aren't that shocking and you don't really care that much.

Also, many things happen in the movie that are pointless and don't futher the story.  For instance, Aeon's first assignment, to interrupt communications is completely pointless.  Why is she doing it?  It has no impact on anything.

Sci-fi movies aren't always my favorite genre to watch, so was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Charlize Theron did an excellent job of playing the lead role of Aeon Flux as I wouldn't have thought she'd be good at this particular role!! This role had seemed more suited for Angelina Jolie!

Loved the settings and costumes for this movie. Aeon Flux is set 400 years in the future and most futuristic movies made over the years have been very dark, drab, & dreary..... Aeon Flux's settings are light and bright and are very nature inspired... a more feminine feel. The costumes are great.... a sexy few to them.

Great action, an engaging story, smooth direction, good special effects, and Charlize Theron in tight clothes; what more can you ask?

But seriously, Aeon Flux is a great film and shares some interesting similarities with a sci-fi movie from long ago: Blade Runner. Wait, before you groan and move on hear me out:

Both are set in post apocalyptic futures.

Both are filmed with a 1940ies style.

Both are dealing with the issues of death and what it means to be alive.

Both movies end on an uncertain, yet hopeful note.

...But everything in-between is, intentionally, different. Technology in the world of Aeon Flux is almost organic, society lives in a utopian world, architecture is all smooth and curved, and everything seems to be in harmony with everything else until you dig below the surface. The best example of this is the total absence of view screens; anytime someone watches a video of something it looks as if the video being reflected off the surface of water. Its great little touches like that that give this movie a unique style.

Charlize Theron was amazing in the lead role not just for her believability but for the amount of stunts she did on her own and the training she went through. This was her first film after Monster and, while she had lost the weight, she wasn't in good shape when she got the part. It took months of physical training for her to be healthy enough for Aeon Flux, and her dedication and hard work shows.

Watching this film the second time was even more fun; with the plot twists all known I could focus on the extra touches that I didn't consciously notice the first time around - How Aeon's jagged, anime-style haircut set her apart from the smooth, curving society around her. Camera angles and dialogue pauses that hint at the secret that this utopian world was built on. Subtle biblical references to the expulsion from paradise... If I go on I'll start spoiling the plot twists.

Apparently she gets driven into moral action outside of her duty when she begins remembering things from a past life she had some 400 years ago, goes against the orders of some all knowing rebel leader, begins figuring out things that no human logic could jump to, and manages to fit a sex scene in all at the same time.

My number one reason I loved it so much is that it is technically classifed as Sci-Fi, but yet, it isn't your typical floating cars, all metal, everything electronic future. It's very ethereal and visually beautiful.

The plotline itself could have used a bit more work to explain a few small things here and there, but if you have a brain in your head you can for the most part pick up on everything that is going on. A lot of people are bashing this movie because they say it drags on and is confusing. THAT IS THE POINT!!!!!!! They want you to be cloaked in mystery up until the very end.....it makes your brain think about all the possibilities........ I personally liked the overall plot. It was very enticing, and perhaps left it open for a very different sequel.

The animated series was very weird for most, Aeon died at the end every episode, which obviously worked for the tv series since DNA is recycled and a tv series has to go on........so some that have seen the tv series are dissappointed because of that, and for the fact that it was very sexually oriented and strange. They toned it down for the movie so that it would be suitable for all audiences. They even say in the costume design part of the special feautres that they toned down Aeons costumes because she is doing crazy stunts and they didn't want her flying out of her costume. I mean, things can't be absolutely copied and perfect for numerous reasons........have an open mind!!!! People that haven't seen the tv series, don't be confused.....it's not that hard to follow, people that HAVE seen the tv series, don't be so judgemental!!! They can't always make everything perfect for the screen.....

PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING THIS HAS NO PLOT OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE A BRAIN IN THEIR HEAD. LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING ISSUES, SUCH AS GOVERNMENT, CLONING, SCIENCE. IT TOUCHES ON THESE SUBJECTS THAT RIGHT NOW ARE VERY CONTROVERSIAL!!!!!!!

As for the movie as a whole, the narration could have used some work, it could have had much better speaking parts, but it works for now. I like to think of the movie as more of a work of art then a movie. It is in all senses beautiful. (watch the special features on the main menu........they give you an inside look at the making of the movie which is just as entertaining as the movie itself)",1148601600,4,2561,4.534632034632034

Sure Charlize Theron is always nice to look at on the screen, but I think it would be better to just watch her walk around talking with her real life friends than have to put up with such a silly addlebrained plot.  The science it espouses makes no sense, the fighting makes no sense (why wear bright white clothes to an attack at night?), the love relationship makes little sense, and the destruction of the technology that Aeon alone has decided must end is stupid beyond belief.

And, by the way, a world of only five million people could not live in the luxury and with the technology this city-state (I guess a kind of advanced Singapore) generates.  Frankly, they would be scrabbling about for food and such.  Where are the food producers?  Where are the carpenters, plumbers, programmers, die makers, assemblers, cooks, gardeners, and so forth?  Calling this a parable doesn't get stupidity off the hook.

Can we also stop, puh-leeze, with the hundred and ten pound skinny women beating up entire armies of two hundred pound males?  And why is it that the hero can spray machine gun fire into the air and each bullet takes down a bad guy, but trained and armored soldiers who happen to be bad guys can lay down focused and directed fire and produce only survivable wounds in the heroes?  That alone would make bad guys not want to go into battle, right?

We could go on and on and on about what is wrong with this movie, but unless you are willing to see it just to look at Charlize Theron in black hair, don't bother.",1148083200,6,1559,4.5321428571428575

For the film, the moral ambiguity of Aeon's world has been watered down.  It has been replaced by an almost ""Minority Report""-type plot, but much less intelligent.  The fighting many times does nothing but serve to show-off Charlize Theron when the plot should have been driving the action.
I though Charlize did well given the material.  But many of the supporting actors were under-utilized and underdeveloped. I also thought that Marton Csokas' character, Trevor Goodchild, was actually more dimensional in the original series. Here he is just an accessory for the lead actress.
I am disappointed, what could have been a slick little sci-fi thriller or neat little Orwellian film more in line with original series falls significantly short of both.

It is a truly original, exciting, and visually appealling masterpiece that showcases not only the talented Charlize Theron but humanitarian and ethical issues like cloning and government control.  The other thing that I didn't expect was the love story within the epic. It really made the movie to have that little bit of emotion coupled with the action.

As I watched the film I felt the disorientation of Aeon, ""What the heck is going on?"". Yet we the audience discover the secrets of the city as she does. In the end, everything is crystal clear.

Now it may not be like the animated series. I remember seeing about 3 or 4 on Mtv years ago. However, this movie is entertaining with the element of making you think about science, nature, and what happens to men with power. I would say this movie is cyberpunk, but it is a little too glossy and well lit [Blade Runner is Cyberpunk].

Final Note: this movie is worth 2 hours, and I find myself saying this less and less. It is unique in some of its ideas, and classic/elemental in others. The action is well balanced by good character relationships. It is not going to make you cry or challenge your thinking, but it will be better than most Summer Fluff.

2511398,2,B000E991HA,"This film should have been made ten years ago at the height of Aeon Flux's popularity on MTV.  With that said and done, I must say Aeon Flux falls flat on its hopeful face.  The special effects are awesome, Charlize Theron is brilliant as Aeon Flux (although I hated her shoes) and Marton Csokas is the perfect Trevor Goodchild (although his appearance would have benefited greatly if he had bleached his hair blonde like the animated Trevor). Also Frances McDormand is good for a chuckle as the leader of the Monicans.

However, the problem with this big screen version of Aeon Flux is there's too much focus on plot.  Part of the charm of the animated version is the ambiguity of the storyline, being thrust into the middle of the action not quite knowing the whats or the whys of what is happening. Aeon wasn't exactly a likeable, moral or ""good guy"" character and all of the blatant sexuality and sado-masochistic undertones found in the animated series are completely stripped away leaving behind a very homogenous film trying very hard to create a cohesive storyline out of a very incohesive and abstract half hour show.  And, if I recall correctly, didn't Aeon die at the end of every one of the early episodes?

Overall, an entertaining yet disappointing adaptation.",1147219200,3,1274,4.794520547945205
2511399,4,B000E991HA,"Aeon Flux is a live-action adaptation of the critically-lauded animated T.V. show by Peter Chung. This movie was something of a gamble as the show only managed to spawn a small, but dedicated cult following. Now, comes along a big budget movie starring Charlize Theron as the eponoymous protagonist. Unfortunately, the show's creator had no input into the movie which only further alienates it from the fan base. However, I think fans will be pleasantly surprised at just how faithful the movie is to the show.

Charlize Theron certainly has Aeon's emotionless attitude down cold and is more than up for her character's athleticism. It is an extremely physically demanding role that she is more than capable of, showing an impressive prowess. However, Marton Csokas is miscast as Trevor. He doesn't look like his animated counterpart nor does he act like him - a lecherous powermonger. Csokas goes in the opposite direction as a quietly confident leader.

This film has top notch production design and special effects with well-choreographed action sequences often accompanied by the requisite techno music. The sterile, futuristic look, flashy martial arts and Orwellian society is reminiscent of Equilibrium, although its action sequences were much better as was its kinetic editing - something that this movie could have used more of. In an interesting twist, all of this society's top assassins are women and, like in the Kill Bill movies, there are ferocious fight scenes between highly trained and very dangerous women, each with their own unique skills.

The animated series was a fantastic example of abstract sci-fi surrealism and to capture that in a live-action movie is a difficult task to say the least. The film tries to have it both ways. It's not quite abstract as it should be and is not as pedestrian as it could have been. Watching this movie, it's easy to see why it failed to capture a mainstream audience. It's too abstract for most and not abstract enough for the show's fans, leaving it in an odd state of limbo.

There is an audio commentary by Charlize Theron and the film's producer Gale Anne Hurd. Theron talks about the challenges of the intense, physical training she underwent for this role and then Hurd, in turn, praises her physical prowess. This is fairly decent track and both commentators are engaging.

Also included is a commentary by the film's screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. They point out connections between the film and the animated series. They also talk about how much exposition was needed to set up this world and how the challenge is to tell enough but not to overwhelm or bore the audience.

""Creating a World: Aeon Flux"" examines the challenge of adapting an experimental, non-narrative cartoon into a Hollywood movie. We see Peter Chung visiting the set and marveling at his drawings being brought to life.

""The Locations of Aeon Flux."" Kusama originally wanted to shoot in Brasilia because it had an ideal, futuristic look that was surrounded by jungle. It wasn't practical for them to shoot there so Berlin was their next choice because it also had futuristic looking architecture.

""The Stunts of Aeon Flux."" Charlize Theron trained hard for this role. She came from a dancing background so she was very flexible - an ideal attribute for her character. It's amazing to see the level of commitment she had for this movie and the fact that she did 95% of her own stunts!

""The Costume Design Workshop of Aeon Flux"" takes a look at how the film's many costumes were designed and then made. They took their inspiration from the film The Conformist (1970).

""The Craft of the Set Photographer on Aeon Flux."" He took pictures on the set for publicity stills and sometimes even for the film's poster. He shows us the various lenses he uses and gives a little insight into how he works.",1147132800,3,3845,4.901538461538461

This movie was visually stimulating -- both the action and the scenery. It was fast paced, action packed, and had a plot, that although not completely new (what plot is?), or difficult to understand, it unraveled in such a way that kept you guessing most of the way through and then, put it together nicely.

The one drawback, for me anyway, was the romantic connection between the leads. Although the romantic link, when made, was a strong one and pivotal to the plot, I did not feel that it was as convincing as it should have been. Unlike many reviewers, I think the movie should have been longer to explore more of the background of the characters and the resistance and, to find out how those fantastic women came by their extraordinary athletic powers.

The movie makers did a good job of making a futuristic city. It was not full of flying cars or space ships -- simply a city in the future -- a type of ""New World"". (That's one of the things I liked about John Boorman's ZARDOZ.) Considering that the movie was shot in Berlin using buildings that were pre World War II (some over 150 years old) that was quite a feat and a nice touch.

Some reviewers I've read thought some of the technology was too futuristic, perhaps beyond plausibility. But I would remind them of Arthur C. Clarke's third law: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""

I'm not looking for redemption or a higher meaning. I watch for sheer, mind disconnected ENTERTAINMENT. At that, this movie excels.

Many of the scenes, poses, settings, weapons, outfits, and dialogue styles of the show make it into the film-and flawlessly.

What is left of humanity is living in Bregna, a protected city that is ruled by the wealthy Goodchild family and we find out that are 5 million people living in that city: which is the same number of survivors left alive when the plague was done killing off people.  Clearly life in the future is carefully controlled, and of course there are those who do not like the arrangement and who are committed to doing something about it, namely bring the whole thing down.  So, once again, a sterile futuristic world is challenged by those who sensibilities are more in keeping with our own.  If only somebody in the future had an actual personality, this 2005 film would be a lot more palatable.

The Monicans are the rebels in this society and their primary goal is to kill the Goodchild brothers, Trevor (Marton Csokas), who is the leader, and Oren (Jonny Lee Miller), the second in command.  The killing machine Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron, reduced to playing a walking manikin) is the best agent for the Monicans, receiving her missions from the Handler (Frances McDormand), and working with her partner, Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo).  After her sister, Una (Amerlia Warner) is killed by the government, Aeon goes right after Trevor Goodchild in his Citadel to assassinate him.  But the ultimate confrontation involves Aeon finding out some information that terms the world upside down and sideways.  This is not actually that surprising, because the vibe we pick up from the bad guy is that he is not the sort of evil megalomaniac we expect to see running a futuristic world.

There are some interesting things about this world, from capsules you swallow so you can receive other people's thoughts to learning a pointed lesson about why you do not walk on the grass in this brave new world.  The problem is that while there are things of interesting in this film, I never found ""Aeon Flux"" to be engaging.  What works as an animated series falls flat as live action, especially when the cast is reduced to two-dimensional performances that tend to make them indistinguishable from each other as the story spins out.  Peter Chung's MTV series provides plenty of ideas for visual treats but it does not translate into anything that proves to be memorably exciting.  But what made me round down on this one is that when we get to the big revelation, which compels us to rethink much of what we have learned about this futuristic society, my reaction was rather apathetic.  To make things worse, the more I thought about it the more I was disappointed that given what is really going on what happens in the movie was not more interesting.  After all, this society has been spinning its wheels for four centuries just to get up to this decidedly underwhelming climax.  It hardly seems worth the bother.",1146528000,2,2939,4.720156555772994

Charlize is a very talented actress, and along with Kate Bekinsale have made some very cool stuff over a wide range of genres and are easy on the eyes.  Charlize is wonderful in this movie, as a disconnected member of her society.

My copy of the movie came with a small sample of the animated series.  Very Japanese, I watched it and threw it out. No plot, no point, not what I consider attractive animation.  But, if it inspired this movie, I say thanks!",1146528000,4,804,4.264900662251655
2511406,2,B000E991HA,"Now this is very bad indeed. There is no real plot. OK, C Theron is a great actress but this movie even manages to look cheaply done. Avoid at all costs",1146528000,2,152,3.935483870967742
2511407,3,B000E991HA,"Let me first say that I loved the Aeon Flux series on Mtv. It positively blew my mind. I use to watch this animated cartoon along with the greats. First came THE Maxx, then The State, Then Aeon. But, now that she's been poured into cinematic form, it seems that all the fan-nostalgia has been washed right out of me.

Charlize theron, a brillant actress, Chameleon actress, did well in portraying Aeon as a kick-butt assasin who takes her work very seriously. I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to play Aeon but her, to be honest.

But, alas, looking like a character doesn't necessarily mean that you will embody that character.

The story takes place in the very far future as the last remaining humans build a city to house the last survivors of the population. Aeon, mingled in with the society, visits her sister often and has the feeling that the regime has been hiding something. Especially since people are dissapearing with no explanation for it.

Now, as I was watching this movie, I couldn't help but notice that it had a similar outline to that of V FOR VENDETTA. But, sadly, this is no V FOR VENDETTA.

The action was good and well cherographed, I admit.

The costumes and plot were also very well done.

If anything, I like the premise and story of this timeless character and movie.

But, with this movie, I think they thrusted the audience too fast into the movie without really spending the time or effort in re-telling the backstory of Aeon and the Regime. Some parts I got confused as to whether everything was comprehendible or if it was just me. STAR WARS had a similar approach, introducing gadgets that need no explaination, but Aeon somehow falls flat in this department. It's not that the gagdets aren't well explained, it's just that they seem to almost pop out of nowhere or need MORE explaining.

I'm Not saying that I hate the movie. I think that they did a spectacular job . . . but they could've done better. They could've spent more time with the backstory, becuase, in essence, that's what keeps us all interested in the characters. And I think that they could've at least spent more time on how the story would unfold. Each frame was not like a painting like it was in V FOR VENDETTA.

It almost seems, when watching this movie, that they left something out or something was missing for the grand masterpiece. Thankfully, this doesn't hurt Charlize's career in any way but the film needs a lot of work still.

I say, that if you are a hardcore Aeon Flux fan, that these things won't matter much. But, if you are a person who has never really been into the series, it may take you a long while to warm up to these characters. You may have to watch the original series and then come back to this movie in order to fully appreciate it more.

I'd say that 40% of the movie was hype.

Final verdict: Needs more history. Still good though.",1146441600,,2867,4.511583011583012
2511408,4,B000E991HA,"Once again I find myself in the minority. The Tomatometer's gauge at rottentomatoes.com levels off at an extremely cool 10% approval rating; meaning 90% of the critics DIDN'T like it.

Most of the bashing comes via comparisons to CATWOMAN (another bomb) or the fact that the original Aeon Flux was an animated feature on MTV and the translation to live-action cinema didn't work. Not having seen these animated versions - or CATWOMAN for that matter - I can't make any comparisons. But what I can do is tell you how the movie flowed, how well it was acted, and its entertainment value.

Charlize Theron (NORTH COUNTRY) stars as Aeon Flux, a rebel in the 25th century. A terrible disease has decimated humanity and its surviving members hide behind an enclosure, cut-off from the possible devastating effects of what lay beyond (think LOGAN'S RUN and you'll be close). Within the confines of their home live the remaining five million members of society thanks to the medical efforts of the Goodchild Regime, named after Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas). Aeon Flux belongs to an elite group of resistance fighters known as the Monicans who's goal is to topple the Goodchild Regime. People have been vanishing. Police actions are resulting in deaths. And Aeon Flux is going to find out why.

As we move through the stronghold of humanity (the city is known as Bregna), we learn and see much about this futuristic yet completely alien-like society. Pills can heighten awareness and even send coded messages to ones brain. Computers look like musical instruments or a type of String Theory. Everyone feels that something is wrong with their world ...and there is. Cloning and its effects on the power-base of the Goodchild Regime are holding humanity back at a terrible price.

CATWOMAN comparisons aside (yes, Charlize looks fantastic in her skin-tight leather outfit), this is a thinking person's film. There are lots of little tidbits thrown into the film that give it a futuristic look without trying too hard (the computers were a nice touch, as were filming many external shots in Berlin, Germany where new construction is the rage).

The pacing of the film was excellent. Never once did it get bogged down in the minutia of the times or the science. If you can't keep up, oh well. Leaping from action sequence to fight scene to action sequence made the 93 minutes fly by. The acting was okay. Nothing special but nothing horrible either. Charlize was the shining star, of course, and gave a relatively fine performance.

For my time, this was extremely entertaining and sexy, and full of great sci-fi scenery.

Only one question remains: What's up with the critics?!",1146355200,59,2669,4.9309576837416484
2511409,2,B000E991HA,"AEON FLUX is an embarrassment.  With the number of gifted writers creating meaningful dramas begging for cinematic adaptation burgeoning, why Hollywood continues to make these bloated sci-fi/fantasy driven, flat stories that were only created as static eye candy games in the first place, into movies just begs an answer.  But the incredible aspect of these creations is how the production companies lure some of our best talent into these messes that can't help but taint the artistic choices made by actors and agents.

The story is the usual one: world killed by virus except for  a single city isolated from the globe by a set of bad guys whose control must be challenged.  Enter a superhuman, barely clad female teetering between abilities to do the impossible and the instinctive need to maintain 'human values' and Voila! you have a story. The characters are flat, as is appropriate for the original source.  But the visuals are terrific!  There are some really beautiful sets of tasteful design and lighting that serve as the background for the idiotic goings on.

And then there are the cast members who hopefully gained a good percentage of the money moviegoers garnered on this thing.  Some of our best actors are here: Charlize Theron, Frances McDormand, Pete Postlethwaite, Sophie Okonedo, Marton Csokas, Jonny Lee Miller, as well as some fine newcomers.  The special effects are good (though nothing new) and the requisite martial arts scenes are well choreographed.  But in the end the viewer is simply left with asking Why...why do these things get made?  Oh yes, public demand and boxoffice success.....Hmmmmm.

So when I see her running around in skin tights, looking fine as ever, I can't help but wonder what jack rod put her up to ruining her acting skills in this horrible adaptation of MTV's long ago animated series, ""Aeon Flux?""  Since I've been writing reviews here on Amazon.com, I've never once written a negative review regarding any musician, actress or actor.  Again, no disrepect to Charlize, she's top notch.  The writer(s), director(s), whomever..........you know what?  I just thought of something.  Maybe Aeon Flux, the animated series was never meant to cross over into a movie?  That's a possibility.

2511412,4,B000E991HA,"`AeonFlux', directed by Karyn Kusama and produced by James Cameron colleague, Gale Anne Hurd, starring Academy Award (Best Actress, `Monster') winner Charlize Theron is, in spite of all earnest efforts, a mediocre Sci-Fi action flick. That is not to say this DVD is not an interesting purchase, as it is one of the first I have seen where the extras add as much or more value to the purchase as the movie itself.

From long years of reading `Heavy Metal' and similar `adult' comic strip fare, I have developed the opinion that both the art and the plots in these works tend to be very derivative of more original works, especially very popular movies. And, since `Aeonflux' is based on an MTV animated feature, I find that it too is very derivative of more original works, in spite of the principle's protestations of originality.

I strongly suspect that the primary inspiration for the general situation is the film, `Logan's Run' and the heroine has strong similarities to the video game adventurer, Laura Croft. And, I am sorry to say, that Ms. Theron simply does not carry off the distaff daring do as well as the excellent Angelina Jolie.

My primary problems with the movie are that first, it does not fully set the premise up well enough early in the movie, unlike the excellent `Blade Runner' or `Minority Report' for example. Second, I develop no interest whatsoever in the fates of any of the characters. They stay flat against the screen, as do most comic book characters. There is none of the angst we feel for the cinema incarnations of Spiderman or Daredevil or Superman. Third, the world in the background is almost totally sterile. There are none of the rich textures of `Blade Runner' or even `Alien' or `Predator'. The extras do a lot to explain this, but do not relieve the tedium of the movie.

I was quite surprised to discover that the movie was shot entirely in Berlin, which turned out to be architecturally even better than their first choice, Brasilia, in spite of the fact that Brasilia is almost identical to the fictional city in the film, as it is set deep in the Amazon jungle. The advantages of Berlin were that there was a thriving movie industry in the city that could supply all sorts of support crew, not to mention a wealth of great costumers and set decorators. And, the scenes were not all-modern post-World War II concrete. Some scenes were done in the gardens of Frederick the Great's summer palace and some other scenes were done in a pre-World War II build aircraft testing tunnel.

I was also delighted to see that many of the costumes were inspired by the 1970's Bernardo Bertolluci film, `The Conformist', which I was also pleased to see was to be released on DVD soon, as it has always been one of my favorite Italian films. There were several video documentaries on the sets, costumes, special effects, and stunts, plus my favorite extra, two voice-overs, one by the star and lead producer and one by the screenwriters.

One of my least favorite aspects of the movie is the fact that the great Frances McDormand appears in a role that totally wastes her talent. That comes on top of the fact that the rationale for the role is totally inexplicable, and connected to virtually nothing else in the film.

Like so many comic book movies, including the Lara Croft epics, poor plot and characterization may be forgiven if the visceral impact is good. I found nothing here that got me the least excited about what was happening on the screen. All I could think about were the errors in science where, for example, they give the impression that characters somehow become immortal because they are cloned from one generation to the next. I'm afraid it simply doesn't work that way. A clone shares no more in the personality, memories, or `spirit' of the original than a naturally born baby shares any intellectual material from natural parents.

In the end, this DVD is literally more valuable as an essay on making this kind of movie than it does as a visceral experience.",1146268800,2,4014,4.7079772079772075
2511413,3,B000E991HA,"OK, so what did I expect anyway.  The actors do a good job (which I would expect from this group).  The director, etc also did well, given what they had to work with.  But there was just so much that didn't make it to the screen that the story seemed oddly in media res at every point.  And there just wasn't enough subtext or back story to engage me.  Having said that, I did think the basic revelatory piece of info (which I won't give away here) was brilliant and unusual.  I also thought the effects were very well done.  So, I recommend this film if you like this kind of futuristic, game brought to life, kind of film.",1146182400,2,624,4.19327731092437
2511414,4,B000E991HA,"There's two ways to watch this one, as a live action version of the animation or as a production of its own, in isolation from the cartoon.

As a live action version of the MTV cartoon: it's very different.  It would be better to describe it as 'inspired by' rather than use the same title.  You can see gimmicks and vignettes from the animation series,  but it is not the same plot or story line, and it is not a continuation of the cartoons.

Taken as a discrete cinema production, it is a pretty darn good action/sci-fi flick!  What the story couldn't carry,  the action did, and when the action faltered, the story got engaging.  Trevor Goodchild is considerably toned down from the cartoon, and much more human.  He leads a government that is more concerned with its own continuation than the good of its members, and is trying to resolve issues from his personal life in the process.

  Charlize Theron as Aeon...  She is a remarkably pretty woman, and has the grace and the moves for the role, but is model/Hollywood skinny :(

  If she'd put on 20-30 lb of muscle and go up to about 15% body fat she'd have been perfect, much more plausible for the role.

  Aside from this bit of personal bias, she carried off the intensity of a fanatic remarkably well.

2511415,4,B000E991HA,After reading the reviews that it was like Halle Berry's Catwoman I was nervous to watch it.  But I liked that it was different and smartly done.

2511416,3,B000E991HA,"I'd rate this movie 3.5. I'm not familiar with the Aeon Flux cartoon series, but after watching some clips from the Special Features of the DVD, I actually prefer the movie.  The cartoon Aeon has spazzy hair, is scantily clad in some strange male-fantasy sort of way, and I was a little disturbed by the scene of a man sticking his wiggling tongue into a woman's ear.  Borderline pornographic if you ask me.

The movie version took some license, softened the hues, made the Bregna world stylish and organic.  I admit the plot is a bit oversimplified and the characters dramatically flat, but the physical action is a pleasure to watch. Charlize made for a gracefully efficient and lethal Aeon Flux.  She maimed her victims with elegance.  Somewhat contradictory in terms, but the action was very fluid and feminine.  I do like that director Karyn Kurasama chose to make a sci-fi futureworld that was very beautiful versus the traditional industrial, hardcore, burnt out look. Think of this movie as the softer version of the Matrix in haute couture.",1146009600,2,1049,4.859550561797753
2511417,1,B000E991HA,"At the heart of the animated series' genius was the tension between Trevor and Aeon, sworn enemies that can't stand to get enough of each other.

This was almost completely ignored in favor of a moldy old mystery plot and a vacant love story.

Instead of any tension (or anything that even remotely matches the cleverness of any one of the old episodes), you have the product of a couple of screenwriters who ""wanted to give a Hollywood feel to the story"" (to paraphrase them, actually) and a director who doesn't seem to know how keep an action movie exciting.

Any incarnation of Aeon Fluz should be character-driven. Aside from maybe selling tickets with Charlize Theron's star-power, I'm not sure what the hell was driving this one.",1145923200,7,736,4.7795275590551185
2511418,3,B000E991HA,"OK, so this is not a masterpiece, but this is not nearly as bad as I would have expected given the horrid reviews by both critics and moviegoers when it first came out.  The real question, I believe, is not why people think this is so good, but why anyone imagines that the graphic novel and the MTV animated series based upon it were so great.  In all three cases the basic story had plot holes you could drive an armada of eighteen-wheelers through, all three were based vastly more on style than substance, and all three were more about how it parsed visually rather than logically.  No version of Aeon Flux could be honestly considered any kind of classic and I really can't privilege either of the previous versions over this one.

Once one gets past the fact that this doesn't have the tightest plot in the history of cinema and just concentrates on the visuals that was really all the previous two versions had going for it, this is actually a fairly pleasant film.  Yeah, there were moments when I would flinch at the silliness of things, but, again, the same silliness afflicted the novel and animated series.

If there is a chameleon in the movies today, it is Charlize Theron.  I find it nothing should of stunning the various physical types that she can play and I think she did a more than creditable job in this one.  Her presence here is remarkable of only because she truly is a first rate actress, capable of a wide variety of roles.  She can do action films, dramas, Sci-fi, and comedy, and could probably do other kinds of films as well if called upon to do so.  She looks good as Aeon, nothing like the previous two versions, but then Aeon in those incarnations looked, in my opinion, rather ridiculous.  Since no actresses who are 6'2 and have measurements of 32-16-30 were available, one has to settle for someone like the lovely Ms. Theron.  The greatest testament to her abilities comes from the fact that in the same period of time this film came out, NORTH COUNTRY was released for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and she appeared in ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT in an extraordinary role for which she could very well be nominated and win an Emmy (you heard it here first) as the ""special"" British female Rita.  As many will know, Theron, who is a very good athlete, did as many of her stunts as possible.

I thought the basic story, as long as one doesn't try to poke too many holes in the plot (an easy thing to do), was fun.  I put no spoiler warnings here so I won't go into the plot, but the basic premise has a kind of Philip K. Dick quality twist on things, where reality isn't as real as it seems.  Nonetheless it is impossible to completely ignore the essential silliness of so many things in the novel/series/movie.  The superfluous athleticism is only one of these.  Why the endless back flips, not only when they are nonfunctional but when they would be actual distractions?  For instance, when Aeon jumps to grab one of the things dangling from the ship that hovers the city she does a full somersault on her way down.  How in the world could that help things?  And why do fifty feet of somersaults instead of simply sprinting?  A one legged person could out hop someone doing back flips or somersaulting.  You can contrast this with the action sequences in another fairly recent film, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY.  What makes Matt Damon's action sequences so refreshing is that in every instance he does the absolute minimum number of moves to be effective.  It makes Bourne come across as the effective killing machine that he is supposed to be.  Here, as in the novel and series, Aeon comes across as an extravagant wind up toy.  And one of my pet peeves:  breaking necks.  I took quite a bit of martial arts and in grappling classes actually was trained in the ways that one can break a neck, mainly so that you can be on the defensive of it happening to you.  On a host of shows and in movies there has developed an intensely dumb way of doing this, which apparently consists of pushing the chin off to one side.  Trust me, you can't break a neck this way.  (My beloved series BUFFY and ANGEL were two of the worse at perpetuating this method of neck breaking.)  OK, this is nitpicking, but I state it as an example of the way the film starts falling apart if you pick at it.  But, again, the same was true of the novel and series.  It's not like the silliness suddenly started with the movie.

So, I recommend this, especially to fans of Sci-fi, as long as you don't expect a tautly thought out story.  What you get is a host of gorgeous images, a compelling main character portrayed by the lovely Charlize Theron, and a pretty interesting visual representation of the future.  I've seen worse and I've definitely seen better but I think a tolerant fan will find more than a little to enjoy in it.",1145145600,49,4863,4.49032992036405

Aeon flux was a very edgy offensive sexually charged cartoon several years ago. This was Aeon Flux in Disneyland. A rehashed plot about a rebel group fighting a totalitarian government harboring a secret that could cripple the utopian society. Been there... done that... about a million times, and this film adds nothing new to the formula, except a few more plot holes. A city of maybe 4000 people is recycled for 400 years and no one notices, I guess they were distracted by the couture designs. It's amazing how many varied fabrics you can get in an isolated ""last"" city on earth.

The action sequences are choppy, some of the special effects are unconvincing, and the fake twists and turns in the plot seem like afterthoughts. They should have went full tilt on Aeon.

I could mention the production designer, costume designer, etc. also, but really it was the script and direction OR the studio that ruined this film.

This film was what you could call ""Sci-Fi Lite"" even though the studio tried to market it as an action thriller with a formulaic movie trailer that did absolutely nothing but misrepresent the film.

In the end the action scenes are poorly photographed and seem to be edited to hide a profound lack of... action.  The story is flat and any resemblance to the original series is painfully absent.",1144886400,2,861,4.535483870967742

The film itself is pure fantasy captured on the screen. I felt transported to another world for the time it took me to absorb the story and on a minor vain note I ended up loving Aeon's hairdo- do, it was awesome!

Aeon is the equivalent of a bounty hunter in this movie, as she is a part of rebel group called the Monicans. She has a secret mission to kill Goodchild, the chairman who oversees the last surviving place called Bregna as he rules with other scientists. Since 99% of the population was killed by a virus, he is in charge and Aeon with her rebellion are about to change that.

What I loved, other than the fantastic costumes and surreal landscapes was the twists and turns in the story! This reminded me of those books I read and loved, when you didn't really know who the bad guy was and that was really going on. You must pay attention as a lot goes! Aeon and Goodchild are caught in a game of cat and mouse and it was enticing to see how they were connected and what the truth would do.

The twist start when Aeon if faced with fleeting memories of a previous life that keep her from fulfilling her mission and as the truth is revealed to her, she changes the future of Bregna with the equivalent of taking the bottom block of the foundation out. She lets all the skeletons loose as she jumps, shots, cartwheels, slinks through the night, paralyzes and disarms army men and fights for the truth of her and her people.

As I said, I'm not a die hard fan, I've never even seen the series and I absolutely let the movie swallow my brain and possess my interest till the end credit.

The writers spent too much time with techno gadgets (YOU ARE IN THE FUTURE) crap, and showing Aeon's acrobatics (ISN'T SHE COOL?) to create any decent suspense.  Charlize Theron, Oscar Winner, is evidently too good to wear the more revealing costume Aeon wore in the series.  Ironic--Hollywood felt the need to put Halley Berry in a cut to ribbons costume when the original Catwoman was fully suited in leather, but they do the reverse here. Go figure.  Overall the movie was okay--a rental.

It's these subpar, flighty movies with big name actresses that give Science Fiction/Fantasy a bad name.

The filmmakers found a good story that helps MAKE the live transition. The action sequences are orignal and nice to look at. But I think what makes this film pretty decent is the story and the question it poses about human cloning. What happens when it's all there is left? Do you do it to save humanity? Or follow the ambiguous moral ethics that seem to want to frown on the mere IDEA of cloning humans? With the scenario and the cloning question in place, it didn't make the movie unbelievable in any way.

I think people just put too much expectation in an MTV movie and decided it was going to be bad before even seeing it. And by doing that actually BELIEVED it was bad while they were watching it.

Last summer, big-budget schlockmeister Michael Bay went for the eternal youth angle in his bombastic though periodically thoughtful morass, ""The Island"", and now indie filmmaker Karyn Kusama makes cloning the lifeblood of Bregna, a cloistered city ruled by the dictatorial Goodchild family. Based on an MTV animated series from a decade ago, this 2005 film set in 2415 has the sheen of a stylish cartoon but the mindset of a confused pair of screenwriters, Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, working off cartoonist Peter Chung's convoluted concepts about the self-destruction of mankind.

Sporting an unfortunate Alan Cumming haircut, Charlize Theron plays the title role by showing off impressive athletic prowess and looking svelte in her black cat suit, but she is bereft of personality, at least one that would draw interest to her character's fate. Consequently, she speaks in a blank-faced monotone that seems to drain more energy than the Matrix-like kicks she uses to pummel her adversaries. As a Monican, an underground resistance movement out to eliminate the ruling Goodchilds, Aeon is instructed by the Handler to assassinate the leader, Trevor Goodchild. Yet, in the moment of key confrontation, she cannot do it for reasons that unfold in clunky plot turns that seem to weigh down an already clunky set-up. Any sensibility the story has - which is minimal anyway - is put completely on hold until the revelations come about later.

Why actresses of the caliber of Theron, Frances McDormand (no more than a talking head as the Handler) and Sophie Okonedo (so impressive in ""Hotel Rwanda"" but simply posturing here as Aeon's colleague Sithandra) are involved in this debacle is the bigger mystery that should be solved. The men fare no better with Marton Csokas saddled with the film's most laborious lines as Trevor and Johnny Lee Miller who seems to be making a career of playing thoroughly obnoxious characters as his power-hungry younger brother Oren. The action set pieces should have saved this movie, but for the most part, they are quite dull and ridiculous and what's worse, edited badly, in particular, the first acrobatic display of Aeon and Sithandra as they attempt to gain entry into the Goodchild enclave.

As the mind-numbing jumble of a story unwraps the mysteries behind the relationship between Aeon and Trevor, it doesn't provide enlightenment as much as it softens an already weak storyline with a romance novel angle. I think the filmmakers had good intentions in showing another variation of a post-apocalyptic world, but even with the slight twist toward the end and Aeon's consequent humanization, there isn't an element in the film that feels fresh. This is one expensive misfire.",1142726400,2,2895,5.181623931623932

2511430,4,B000E991HA,"I figured it out.  This movie is a chick flick.  I saw it with two people, my boyfriend and my best friend (girl).  My boyfriend fell asleep and my best friend and I loved it.  We wanted to see the animated show afterwards.  My boyfriend still claims its the worst movie he's ever seen ever in a movie theater, while my friend and I are probably going to buy the dvd.

The movie boils down to very beautiful love story.  I was familiar with the cartoon from mtv, but i hadn't seen it since it was on the air, like, what was that, ten years ago?  and I was familiar with the love/hate relationship of Aeon and Trevor.  This movie was a tribute to not only the show, but to their unblossomed relationship in the show.  For fans of the cartoon, it was heartwrenching.  They both wanted, practically loved each other, but they couldn't seem to be together.  The way they saw the world was too different.

As promised, I bought the cartoon on dvd the second I saw the movie, wanting to freshen up my memory.  To my surprise, I saw many of the scenes and extra characters in the movie were directly from the show, the woman cassandra with the hands for feet, running across the field of automated guns, even scenes and concepts from the mtv liquid shorts that even less people are probably familiar with from before they decided to make it a full  show.

The movie takes the relationship between Trevor and Aeon and gives the fans of the show exactly what they wanted to see all along.  The two of them together.  The show was a teasing twisting tale of their jealousy and affections and quiet longings for the other, while the movie goes in depth to create a reason and conclusion for their story.  I can only hope they take all this Aeon Flux's rebirth into making more episodes of the cartoon, which was shockingly short, only ten episodes with an unsatisfying ending.  I'd love to see more of their story.",1142208000,10,1903,4.413793103448276
2511431,2,B000E991HA,"As you know, `Aeon Flux' has been either ignored or dismissed as nonsense by the critics, and its results on the US box-office are certainly not what the producers would have expected them to be. So here is a question: Is this so bad? If bad, how bad?

I finally saw the film, and at first I thought these critics were wrong. The earlier chapters, in which heroine Aeon Flux appears as ninja-like deadly assassin, are full of rip-roaring sequences that are fun to see, and there are many good ideas in them such as the deadly turf. Though I have not seen the original MTV series, I thought Charlize Theron (and her black costumes, if not her hairstyle) brings life to the thin story that betrays its origin.

But sadly `Aeon Flux' loses steam too soon, after she encounters the target Trevor (Marton Csokas) the leader of this futuristic, totalitarian society. Except for the secrets surrounding Trevor and Aeon, the film has little to tell, and that little is not very interesting. The film also has Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner), Aeon's partner Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo), but their characters have not much to do in the story. Even two veterans such as Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite are buries in the CGI-created halo and the heavy make-up.

But if only there are healthy amount of good actions, every flaw would be forgiven. Sorry, but Karyn Kusama, who directed acclaimed `Girlfight' five years ago, may not be the right choice after all, for she fails to keep the film's good pace in the second half, slackening it with dull and uninspired actions. The concluding part is very disappointing, nothing that you have seen in sci-fi better actions like `Equilibrium.'

Now I checked out the informative site of Rotten Tomatoes, and found that as many as four critics cited the name of `Catwoman' in order to mercilessly ridicule `Aeon Flux.' The unkind comparison is understandable. These two films both contain talented (and safe to say beautiful) Oscar-winners; both have one strong woman in its central role; and both define the meaning of `stylish action' in a quite unique way. Add to them `Tomb Raider' if you like and what can you have? Three Oscar winners and three very good-looking posters.",1142121600,2,2217,4.841688654353562

The movie managed to provide a perspective for 'big' questions that are so easy to lose sight of in day to day life. I think the flow of special effects fed the story well. My only reservation is that the story was wound so tight that by the end everything fit too neatly into a tidy package. In spite of this small limitation, I expect that, as with many significant works of science fiction, we will someday face related challenges that arise as consequences of current technological developments.",1141862400,3,621,4.6454545454545455
2511433,3,B000E991HA,"First I am a fifty something white guy and I didn't say ""what's going on"" to my wife when I saw this movie. Nothing worse than people that want you to see their bold reviewing vision and then they slap someone in the face with a sexist/elderly discremination remark. Gee, like only the MTV generation understands Science Fiction and this movie. Funny but last time I checked Sci Fi was around and being read long before even I was born let alone someone such as yourself. I was probably reading Isaac Asimov before you were born, so what does that prove? One thing, I have learned age and sex have nothing to do with how people interpret SciFi. Now that we got that out of the way, this is a good movie. Some are being overly critical because of the predictable invulnerability of Aeon and how it is overly easy for her to take out everyone else. I too must admit it was a touch heavy handed, but then so was ""The Matrix"". The faults are minor when you consider the quality of the story, action, and the effects. Take time to watch it a second time and reflect on it before being so harsh.

This movie may seem simple to some, but it has a good deal under the surface. One critical viewer went on about the blimp used to hide the DNA instead of a vault being stupid. I say, not at all. Hiding in plain sight is often quite smart. No one would expect something of great value in a blimp that could be easily shot down or boarded, and the keeper was there to make it seem like something ordinary. Another indicated this was new for a woman to strike out for her believes. Nothing new about a young woman striking out for her believes. Most recently I recall ""Underworld"" using that plotline, and then there was ""Final Fantasy"", et cetera, but I digress. The story is different in the respect of a different look at a future society. As mentioned previously by a couple truly open minded reviews, that is a tough nut to crack. ""Logan's Run"" 30 years later still looks okay even if the effects seem a bit hokey. It holds up because of what they tried to say, not because the F/X were not extreme. SciFi fans will probably like it best, but anyone with an open mind may find it entertaining. I suggest renting before buying. Personally I liked the acting and story so much I am buying it. The trailers did not do this movie justice. They make it look like a mindless action movie.

2511434,3,B000E991HA,"Back in the day...or if you prefer the Star Wars style intro ""a long time ago in a galaxy far far away"", MTV used to show almost nothing but music videos. Occasionally, they would put something incredibly progressive that was also quite popular (see Bevis and Butthead, for example). Aeon Flux was one such animated series.

The problem was, true to Asian style anime, the stories were so disjointed you had no freaking clue what the heck was going on. You just sort of sat back and watched and said ""cool"" a lot when something happened.

Flash forward to this movie, and you get the ""cool"" factor of old, and you finally get what the heck is going on in this world. Alas, the 'ho-hum' of the story makes it so you don't really even care. Check this out for the great special effects and enjoy the style and action.

2511435,4,B000E991HA,"Like many males in the Cold-War, Baby-Boom generation, I grew up reading science fiction when the best Hollywood could do was cheesy ""Giant Ant"" and ""Dumb Flying Saucer"" flicks. Closely critiquing this film misses most of the point (and the fun). Anyone past the age of reason can list this (or any) movie's shortcomings. Science fiction films deserve a looser, more sympathetic evaluation because they are attempting to do something that, when done right, is VERY difficult. The reward for considering Sci-Fi flicks by a different standard is a less tethered imagination.

For my money, ""real"" science fiction is Not a ""cowboy flick set in outer space."" It's a window into what the future might actually look like. What are people thinking and doing in the future? (The farther out, the better) In thinking about what was likable about Aeon Flux, I think about how hard it is to build a sketch of the future that has BOTH a plausible and unexpected 'feel.'

I know that the further into the future one goes, the harder it is to achieve this. Aeon Flux went over 400 years out! Not many films come to mind that had the courage to even attempt that. Now, imagine bringing someone from 400 years ago into our time. How much of ANYTHING would they understand?! Do you think that 400 years from now, things will have changed less, about the same, or more than they've changed in the last 400 years? I think more. Aeon Flux attempted to portray that kind of change by creating a plausible technology based on laws of physics we haven't really discovered yet. That takes guts and imagination in a medium that is risking a lot of somebody's money.

One of the most interesting ideas in Aeon Flux had to do with ""perferating the vail of memory"" that separates biological incarnations. In the whole history of human (sexual) reproduction, few have reason in their own experience to suspect they have lived in the past. Would (asexual)cloning change any of that? I can't recall a Sci-Fi flick out of Hollywood that even rubs up against this question.

What I liked least about Aeon Flux was that ""human nature"" did not appear to evolve very much. Everything was very slick and stylish, and there was a degree of freedom to move from science fiction to science fantasy, but it moved along on the same tired, predictable, adolescent crap about authority versus the rebels-without-a-clue. This begs the question of whether a film set in the future would interest us at all if we were unable to recognize the plot in terms we understand. I'd like to see less Star-Wars nonesense, and more attempts to get out on that ledge with an audience. Show me something that almost totally bewilders me but, at the same time, anchors me to a new vision of what humans could become. ""Chimps with gadgets"" is what we have now. Show me something different in the future.

Aeon Flux has its shortcomings. So did Logan's Run, Blade Runner, Alien, Pitch Black, Dark City, and Le Jete (12 Monkeys was the far less imaginative remake). Erodite criticism in this genre is the domain of the truly boring. On the other hand, minds straining to see NEW possibilities will find much on which to chew in Aeon Flux...beats the hell out of giant ants.",1138060800,13,3210,4.704626334519573
2511436,2,B000E991HA,"The cynic in me is beginning to wonder if there is a shortage of filmworthy material out there, as again another borrowed medium makes its transition to the screen. Now, this is no crime, when one looks at the success of the Spiderman, X-Men, and more recently Fantastic Four movies, and other pictures that have developed even video games into movies, with moderate success. But most of those had a wider recongition base, and global audience to work from leaving this feeling very ""special interest"". So I understand it, Aeon Flux is a relatively successful animated pulp magazine/storybook, and previous short TV series on Liquid TV that has been around for some time, and has a reasonable following amongst the adolescent community. The picture however, starts from the false assumption that you are familiar with the storyline, characters, and chronology of the aforementioned books. As faithful and appealing as that may be to hard core fans, it does tend to leave the uninitiated viewer out in the cold, so to speak. I spent the first 30 minutes or so wondering what the hell was going on, and although I picked up the idea (and a nice SciFi idea it is) the script and action had more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. Often movies like this, bypass the theater and head straight to their intended target audience in the DVD section, and gambling on a major release with the injection of big name actors, is a very hit or miss affair (anyone remember Spawn?)

Theron is certainly visually distracting in a seemingly endless wardrobe of leather and spandex, and the rest of the cast DO follow through their dialogue with conviction, but it simply isn't enough. The end result comes out like a ruined surprise souffl&eacute;, with plenty of promise, but flat as a pancake. Considering the short 93 min running time, some back story would have been more than feasible, and would have helped the movie immensely; also a little more concise editing would have been a welcome addition to the often choppy direction you see on screen. Overall, this isn't a bad movie, but it's really not very good either, and sadly the inventive story and initial ideas ended up being way too large for its own production leaving a watery popcorn flick for the MTV generation.

Theron does an okay job but having this follow so closly to her oscar winning performance in Monster was a shock.  North Country was a worthy follow up, but this was more suited to her Sweet November days, back when she was nothing but eye candy, you know, not taken seriously.  I want to say that a few reviewers said it was hard to follow if you hadn't seen the series...NOT TRUE!!!  I've never seen the cartoon nor had any idea what it was about and I followed the film fine.  There are things they don;t want you to know right off bat and thats the point of an unraveling plot.  That's a good thing.  Anyways...the action is decent but nothing to write home about and thats the reason for my complaint...with a film like this you don't look for a plot or brilliant oscar worthy performances...you look for amazing fight scenes and amazing special effects and this movie only delivered minimally...so, it's kindof a let down.

  If you want some real acting and better martial arts, watch Serenity instead.  It had a good mix of humor, drama and kick-butt martial arts.  I must disagree with previous reviewers that the plot was too complex either in this movie or in Serenity.... I found both plots to be fairly simplistic.  I would consider the Matrix series convoluted.

  If you're into eye candy (I don't mind a little every now and then) as soon as this comes out on DVD or PPV check it out.  Its visually fascinating and has an interesting view of what future technology might be like.  The animation is quite good and so are the stunts.  The martial arts were not so hot.  The scenes are so fast you really aren't sure what happened.

In the year 2011, a deadly virus killed most of the population. Trevor Goodchild, a scientist, developed a cure for the disease, and the rest of the survivors lived in Bregna, the last city on Earth. We now go to 400 years later, where there are some unusual incidents taking place in Bregna. Rebels known as the Monicans are challenging the Goodchild regime and trying to bring it down, as they feel that Goodchild has something to do with the incidents. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) is one of them. Her main aim is to get rid of Trevor Goodchild, but things get really complicated during her mission, as she starts to remember things that she doesn't remember happening. She wants to get to the bottom of what is really going on, and that is what the rest of the movie is all about.

It's too bad the critics are trashing this movie. Personally, I found it a little slow and difficult to understand at first, but after the first 10 minutes, things start becoming very interesting. The special effects are amazing and very life-like, such as Sithandra's `modifications', the city of Bregna, Goodchild's library, etc. Ok, so Charlize is not playing her usual `Oscar winning' role here, but I think she acted very well as Aeon. Just because someone wins an Academy Award doesn't mean that they have to stick to only those types of roles; if that was the case, then there would be no versatility. Similarly, even Sophie Okonedo (after seeing her wonderful performance in Hotel Rwanda) acted fine as Sithandra. The rest of the cast did well for their roles, but nothing great.

True, the storyline is unique, and this might not be a movie for everyone, but you should at least give it a chance. Don't listen to what the critics are saying. Go see the movie and judge it yourself.",1134604800,15,2044,4.579234972677596
2511440,5,B000E991HA,"This movie is only for people who (a) like thoughtful Sci-Fi, (b) enjoy new & creative theatrical styles, and (c) prefer edgy flicks to more traditional formulaic movies.

To compare it to X-men is to compare John Grisham to Umberto Eco. A different ballgame completely.

Two recent favorites in the Sci-Fi genre include I-Robot & Minority Report, but Aeon Flux is definately a step up. Those movies are visually interesting with good plots, but they still follow a fairly bland formula: the good (male) cop falls from grace, lots of action, then it's all resolved nicely in 90 minutes.

Aeon Flux starts out as a ""bad girl"", part of a resistance movement. She then betrays her friends, as a complex mystery slowly unravels.

It doesn't follow a formula, it makes some bold decisions, and I applaud everything about this film. But it's not for everybody. When I was in the theater, I saw all the 50-something white men whispering to their wives, ""What's going on???"". And I saw all the 18-35 year-olds (MTV generation) completely engrossed.

After 15 minutes of this movie, I was wondering to myself how such a movie could have been made in today's conservative culture. It was so fresh & exciting, with new ideas around every corner. Science Fiction is extremely difficult to bring to the big screne: in addition to building characters and a story, you have to build the entire world & new rules of reality. And you have a limited amount of time to do it.

This film succeeded. It provides a counter-example to the unimaginative, uncreative films of today's Hollywood. Whether you enjoyed it or not, you have to agree that it was an extremely unique and creative theatrical experience. It's something Stanley Kubrick & Isaac Asimov would probably enjoy.

And my interpretation of the bad reviews: that stuffy old white men who write the reviews (Ebert, etc) don't understand edgy movies. They didn't understand Matrix at first, either.

I didn't know there was a series before I saw the movie. People who say it didn't make sense at first are too used to brainless Hollywood flicks, serving you a formulaic plot on a platter.

This plot was not difficult to understand - the movie asks for your patience the first 30 minutes, as the story unfolds. It's a futuristic mystery, people! Get real - how lazy must you be if you lose interest because everything isn't explained immediately. It's a mildly (and pleasantly) complex story. If you want a Steven Siegal or Schwarzenegger action flick, look elsewhere.

And only the first half of the movie is the ""mystery"". It takes about an hour for the plot, the characters, and the futuristic setting to unfold. Then the movie evolves into a stunning action flick.

Thing I loved about this movie:

-Srong female characters

-Excellent soundtrack

-Extremely interesting visually

-Extremely creative sci-fi contributions (like the arm-to-leg transplants)

-Thoughtful cinematography

-A very strong cast

-Artistic sets & effects

-Creative weapons & futuristic props

-A truly unique story - it didn't try to copy anything (which probably confused the Hollywood lemmings out there)

My only complaint - it needed more in spots. Particularly, more character development for other members of the resistance. If you've seen it...I believe they jumped the gun getting to the last ""sniper"" scene. I wanted them to invest more time developing the animosity between Aeon Flux & the resistance movement.

Nonetheless, I'm hoping for a sequel. And I hope Ms Theron doesn't get depressed about some of the bad reviews. This is *nothing* like Catwoman (as Ebert said). My humble prediction: it will turn into a cult classic.",1134432000,10,1993,5.086153846153846

Some people don't understand it, some people say it betrays the origional series, some people say that the writing was terrible. In actuality, these are all false. This movie is fantastic. It's pacing is incredible, reveling very little story but hinting at what is to come. The writing is comendable, though some of the dialog is stiff. The cenematography is UNBELIEVEABLE, this movie just drips with a wonderful art direction, amazing sets, and a tastefull use of effects. It is VERY confusing at first, because you really have no idea what is going on, why people dissapear and what the hell the Goodchild's are talking about.

My favorite part about the movie, aside from the amazing art direction and visuals, is the casting. Martin Csokas especially, as the role of Trevor Goodchild. He stands out above the rest of the cast, but the others continue to do a commendable job. Charlize Theron wonderfully depicts Aeon, and her acting is VERY reminiscant of Sarah Connor from Terminator 2. Definitely one of the best leading ladies in hollywood today. There were no real casting flaws at all. Not a single weak actor or weakly written part.

You really care about the characters. At least i did, i really didn't want Trevor to die, or Aeon (for thoes familar with the series, Aeon dies alot, so it was always a possibilty). There were some times i thought the plot would move one way, and it in fact moved a different. I think Riddick and Aeon would make a perfect couple (that'd be some rough sex).

If you are a fan of science fiction, Equilibrium, 1984, The Andromeda Strain, The Matrix, THX-1138, or Pitch Black, or just a fan of the origional series (yet not a zelot), you will definitely enjoy this movie.

I found the message of rebirth and renewal and the optimistic ending very refreshing. I know some people will feel betrayed by not having a naturalistic ending, but sometimes you just want to see some good things happen to people.

When there is something you LOVE, and they are going to make a movie out of it, how often is it incredible?

Does it do it justice?  Well, probably not, but is it a good science fiction movie?  YES, it is.  The next question has to be what sacrifices were made to bring this to the big screen, and are they acceptable?  If you like science fiction movies that deal with post-apocolyptic Earth, then I truly believe you will enjoy this.  Films like Planet of the Apes (old, not new crap), Omega Man, Soylent Green, Mad Max/Road Warrior, Wizards and the Matrix, if you like these I think you will be entertained, and may even really enjoy Aeon Flux.

Great actors don't get to shine. Besides that, I don't think we'll be speaking that way in the 25th century. I can't speak for adaptation of the original animated feature, but it's obvious that this is an adaptation and not an original screenplay. There are lots of gaps in it although there's enough info to piece things together somewhat. Great fight scenes, it seems, but the camera angle was never wide enough to show what was actually happening. Of course this did create an interesting cinematic/visual effect. The best thing was the set design, some of the costumes, a few decent visual effects, theron's legs. If you are not already a fan of Aeon flux, wait for this to hit dvd.

Stupid gymnastic and martial arts crap. Aeon Flux is an ordinarly human being but she has all these superpowers like flying around, martial arts, and shootings guns. I don't get it. This movie is stupid just like Charlie's Angels and Stealth. And razor blade grass and needle shooting fruit trees.

2511446,2,B000E991HA,"400 years from now, 99% of the world's population has been wiped out by a virus.  Those remaining are living in a walled city and led by the Goodchild regime.  Five million people survived the plague in 2001, and five million still live in 2415.  The Goodchild regime is a totalitarian government, and the Monicans are focused on removing him from power by any means necessary.  The most dangerous Monican, Aeon Flux (Theron) accepts a specific mission from the Handler (McDormand) to kill Trevor Goodchild (Csokas).  With the help of her sidekick, Sithandra (Okonedo), she ventures into his fortress.  When the time comes to pull the trigger, something happens that will change their world forever.

""Aeon Flux"" is the film version of some short cartoons aired on MTV in the 1990's, and is a mixed bag, sometimes working and sometimes not -- mostly not.  There are a lot of nods to the cartoon, and they seem kind of silly when not in cartoon form.  Theron is wrong for the role, and never really feels right to this fan of the cartoon.  The story is moderately interested, but poorly executed for the most part.  ""Aeon Flux"" was a disappointment for me, and I can't help but think that with a different cast and crew, a better job could have been done.",1133913600,2,1254,4.654545454545454

2511448,3,B000E991HA,"I was drawn to seeing Aeon Flux, because the trailer provided a few impressive action scenes and I am very interested in seeing the participations of three Oscar-nominated/winning actresses teaming up in this Sci-fi action ""chick flick"". I have been following Charlize Theron way back in the Cider House Rules days, and loved her work in Monster and her recent North Country. I had to see this film to see if she can play an action hero considered that she's got the supermodel body and she's a great actress. And how often does Frances McDormand submitts herself to a big budget commercial film? Lets not dismiss the appeal of last year's relatively unknown Oscar-nominated Sophie Okonedo, she also plays a strong supporting role that managed to steal some scenes next to Theron.

Aeon Flux takes place 400 years in the future, when the virus afflicted Earth had eliminated 99% of the human population, and the remaining one million reside in the city of Bregna, which is controlled by the Trevor Goodchild(Marton Csokas). The citizens are duplicated clones of their original DNAs, but they are all unaware of that they are merely living like a ghost. The Resistant group called Monicants are lead by Handler(a God-like character played by McDormand) have a mission to kill Goodchild and take over the regime. A highly trained and skillful Monicant named Aeon Flux(Theron) and her sidekick Sithandra(Okonedo) are sent to assassin Goodchild . On their mission, there are many dangerous horizons they have to encounter before getting inside the highly secured buildings where Goodchild and his team were hiding. The seemingly fearless and emotionless Flux had no idea that she was a clone and that her true identity becomes clear when she reunites with her forgotten past-life husband Trevor Goodchild. And now she's torn between unsolving the mystery behind the clone humans and abandoning her mission. At the same time, Oren Goodchild(Johnny Lee Miller) is rebelling against Trevor, because he refuse to let Trevor use the new-found cure to the disease that would end the cloning of humans. Both Trevor and Aeon have became fugitives, and they must work together to defeat Oren and the assassins sent by Handler....

This film features some great production designs, and the futuristic costumes are quite meticulous and impressive. The fight scenes are rather mediocre, while the special effects are quite worthwhile. Both Frances McDormand and Pete Postlethwaite(who played the clone Keeper) had less than five minutes of screentime, and their roles are just too low-key and unchallenging for them. Theron wears that black spandex bodysuit most of the time, and she even had to wear a flesh revealing beaded underwear in one scene. She also had some steamy and romantic moments with the hunky Marton Csokas.",1133740800,,2809,5.117647058823529
2511449,2,B000E991HA,"It is a bad sign indeed when a studio does not allow the critical press to preview a film before its release. This happened with Karyn Kusama's (the extraordinary ""Girlfight"") ""Aeon Flux,"" a turkey of such proportions as to overwhelm and upturn the largest and sturdiest of Christmas tables.
""Aeon Flux"" has many things going for it on paper: Kusama, whose ""Girlfight"" was tough, gritty and aggressive, every thing this film is not; the glorious Charlize Theron, the noted cinematographer, Graeme Revell, Sophie Okenedo, Marton Csonkas and the estimable Frances McDormand. But what has come out of all this talent? Not much: ""Aeon Flux"" is still born, stilted, lacking anything even approaching style or forward movement. All of the actors, gifted one and all, are given mostly gibberish to spout...they seem lost and consequently so do we.
Despite all of this, the film is quite beautiful, looking very much like a 1960's futuristic film like ""Fahrenheit 451"" both in production and costume design. ""F451"" was released in 1966; surely the film makers could have come up with some new ideas particularly with all the technical improvements that have occurred in the last 40 years?
Many films are so bad that they are good: ""Aeon Flux"" is not one of these.",1133740800,11,1255,4.980952380952381
2511450,2,B000E991HA,"Never has so much work been put into a film that means so little.

Aeon (Charlize Theron) is an elite member of a group called the Monicans. Due to a large-scale epidemic, there is only one city left on the planet ruled by Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), who heads a council of elders (of sorts), including his brother, Oren (Jonny Lee Miller). Everyone in the cast seems to have been chosen because they spell their names in an odd way. Perhaps this is the director's subconscious method of evoking the future. The Monicans realize that although everything may look good, they are living in a police state and nefarious people lurk in the background, extracting citizens without cause. Aeon receives her latest instructions from Handler (Frances McDormand): The Monicans want her to assassinate Goodchild. Aeon has good reason to hate the Chairman as her sister was just murdered, for being a suspected member of the Monicans. The Monicans have received secret information that he will be vulnerable at a certain time. Just as she is about to kill him, Goodchild recognizes Aeon and asks ""Catherine?"" causing her to lose her concentration.

""Aeon Flux"", directed by Karyn Kusama, whose only other film was the independent film ""Girlfight"", is an interesting film to look at, to a point, but it is extremely simplistic and hollow.

The film is based on a series of graphic novels and an animated series, which I am not familiar with. A friend told me that in these original incarnations, Aeon is repeatedly killed and then cloned, to keep coming back and back. If this is true, it seems rather pointless. How can we root for Aeon, the hero, if she is so completely unsuccessful that she repeatedly gets killed? Thankfully, the filmmakers have changed this when adapting for the big screen. Charlize Theron's interpretation of the character is an extremely well-trained assassin who seems to have every skill she needs at her fingertips. This makes her the sort of tough, no nonsense woman you are probably expecting from the commercials and trailers.

But she is ultimately too tough. Aeon never shows any emotion. Even when her sister is killed, a tear barely falls before she is off running, kicking, or killing guards with a quick jerk on their necks. Note to filmmakers: They don't all have to be cold-hearted and stone-faced killers in the future. This would be an acceptable trait for the lead character if anyone else showed any emotion. Occasionally, a tear makes its way down a cheek, but the person remains cold and immobile. But no one does. I understand all of this stoicism is meant to evoke the sterile, antiseptic feel of the future, but we're beyond that. We can see a character show some emotion in the future.

Watching Charlize Theron kick box her way through a series of attackers is fun, but it gets repetitive. Real fast. She gets a scratch here and a cut there, but nothing seems to slow her down. She just keeps running or kicking or hitting, etc. Yawn. When there is little or no evidence that she will ever be waylaid by any injury, any suspense generated by the situation quickly evaporates. Many of these futuristic fighting machines are just that, machines. They never appear vulnerable, never show emotion and simply move from one target to the next, trying to achieve some goal. What the filmmakers are missing is that the character, their futuristic fighting machine, needs to have something for us, the audience to identify with. Give the machine some trait or other that lets us in, shows us they are vulnerable. This is one of the reasons The Terminator is such a great character. In ""The Terminator"", he is originally the villain. Yet, he is also vulnerable, he can be slowed down. In the sequel, he becomes the protector and even though he isn't the most emotive guy in the world, we see that he cares about Sarah and John Connor. This made him a character we could identify with, yes, even though he is a robot who kills, leaving a path of destruction.

The design of ""Aeon Flux"" is interesting and easily the best thing about the film. It occurred to me that director Kusama probably grew up watching films like ""Logan's Run"" and similar mid-70s attempts at depicting the future, and really enjoyed them. This is her homage to these films. The film looks and feels like ""Run"", but made with better special effects. Buildings have sleek shapes, built in concrete. Clothes are strange, made primarily of leather and latex and cover odd parts of the body. Food is interesting. It looks as though they took a mixture of the oddest looking things they could find in real life and interspersed them throughout, adding a touch of interest to a strange bleak landscape. At one point, Aeon's sister is cutting into a star fruit, which is supposed to be a futuristic thing, but exists in this day and age. I have heard that much of the film was shot in Germany, presumably to use some of their slightly surrealistic architecture as the basis for this futuristic world.

Is this attempt at creating a new world enough to warrant your time and money? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. The film is well-produced, but it is not well-written or directed well. Until the filmmakers can begin to create futuristic characters that experience some believable emotion, which can make us feel for them, don't bother. Without this human touch, these films will always feel like hollow shells of moviemaking excess.",1133740800,,5427,4.785485592315902
2511451,4,B000E991HA,"After reading reviews of this movie, I was skeptical that it was going to be any good.  Some of the ones I saw said the movie was boring.  I have to disagree.  This film had an interesting and coherant storyline, mixed with well done action scenes.
The special effects were also well done, and several artsy shots from the cartoon also appeared in the movie (such as Aeon catching the fly in her eye lashes).
People whom are looking for something which is 100% true to the cartoon may be a bit disapointed.  However I think that most sci-fi fans and fans of the cartoon will enjoy the movie. If you don't fall into either of those categories I can't quite recomend it to you.
The relationship between Trevor and Aeon was quite different in the movie than in the cartoon, and the movie as a whole was not highly symbolic as the cartoon was.  While this makes the movie easier to follow, it does lose some of the appeal of the cartoon.
The other complaint I heard was that the outfits in the movie were way too ""out there"", and that the movie was almost pornographic. I can honestly not imagine how someone could consider a movie, which is actually rather tame when it comes to sex, to be nearly pornographic (unless you're really really old fasion). In fact the cartoon was quite kinky, and the movie wasn't really, which I admit to wishing it had been. Also the outfits are not as ""out there"" as they were in the cartoon, and if you can appreciate a little bit of weirdness, you will find them well done.
edit:
For those complaining about her not being emotional enough.  That is exactly how the character Aeon Flux is supposed to be.  Those who have seen the cartoon know that Aeon is as a rule (with very few exceptions, Trevor being the main one, which she deals with an appropriate awkwardness), a tough person whom doesn't get emotional involved with other people.  The movie stayed pretty true to this.
While there are a few things in the cartoon that this movie lacked, and I found myself missing them, I do think it is a very well done (though not quite amazing), and interesting adaptation of a cartoon which doesn't easily lend itself to being a live action mostion picture.",1133740800,7,2184,4.483627204030227

The new movie does an incomplete but mostly decent job of capturing what made the first Flux movie so good.  They even have the ""fly in the eye"" at the beginning.  Charlize Theron embodies the Aeon character pretty well, although I thought much of Flux's weary cynicism was missing from the portrayal.  The movie has its share of cool special effects, and the architecture and surroundings (set design) are all ultra-modern and great to look at.  The plot is nearly as incomprehensible as in the original (to be expected with any Aeon Flux flick).  The areas where I found the movie less than fully satisfying included the too-frequent sterile pauses in the story, especially the ""talky"" scenes, and also the shootout near the end.  It was a pretty plain action scene, especially by Matrix standards, and it was pretty much completely lacking in the original series' cleverness and creativity.

The premise of the movie is that Eaon is a secret 'terrorist'/freedom fighter/assasin, out to eliminate Trevor Goodchild, the corrupt leader of a future Utopia/Dystopia in a post-apocalypse world 400 years into the future. But of course there's more to the story.  She discovers a hidden truth:

The plague that destroyed most of humanity way back in 2011 had left the survivors sterile, and what people had thought were newborn babies were in fact implanted clone embryos.

Society had become a sterile museum piece, with no fertile offspring, no new ideas or growth was possible and the world had become a meaningless, perfect but unchanging island of technology.

On the other hand, death has been banished - as clones take the place of children, individuals had for centuries been succeeded by their carbon copies.  So while individuals had aged and passed, their DNA blueprints had endured.

And so the question:  Is life so precious that it should be preserved if technology makes it possible is invented?  The answer: No.

That position - that Cloning is Good - is taken by the villains. The moral: Death is necessary..  As carbon copies we lose our individuality and our sacred concept of pure free will is degraded as our abilities and attributes become tracable and assigned to our DNA instead of our personal decisions.

And thus humanity in the current definition ends, and we become simple cogs in a soul-less machine/society. Eaon sees this, as she describes the citizenry as 'walking ghosts'.

Like Venice, embalmed in the 1850's into a museum-area for tourists, so too would the Eaon Flux Future be a bleak and meaningless existence. Inflexible, narrow, devoid of uncertainty and the pleasure or pain of a dynamic possibilities.

So .. Eaon figures out who the good guys are.  She Arranges through a long and overly complex plot to kill the bad guys, thereby freeing the future from it's well-intentioned but wrong-headed techno-overlords, and lives happily ever after in a fertile world - until her certain death in the distant future, which is exactly as it should be.

In the end the city wall is broken and a reborn humanity is again free to flood outward into a rejuvinated natural world, a new Garden of Eden with a limitless future.

Hooray!..

Charlize Theron looks like a stunningly perfect ballerina sculpture from every angle, absolutely hypnotizing, like a poised Leni-Reifenstahl Uber-Athlete made of porcelain. At 29, I'm glad she made this movie. The world wants to see her beauty, and as gravity catches up with her it's likely she'll never look this good again.

But sadly..there wasn't enough personality in this film - the sterility was deeper than the surface.  Every single sentence felt like a movement of a chess piece on an inorganic 3D backboard which really needed more verve and charm. The total abstraction of 'society', while necessary to the story, felt shallow.

If we're meant to root for humanity - we needed to see it.  I didn't see anything on the screen worth saving - instead we were supposed to be rooting for a deeper, more complex humanity which the filmakers didn't decide to show us, probably due to time-constraints and lack of imagination.  They've built themselves a magnificent edifice, but there wasn't any jelly in this donut.  Just cement sculpture and beautiful acrobatics.

Good movies that make somewhat similar points about our DNA-enhanced/cloned dystopic future, but with different styles and emphasises.. are George Lucas's THX-1138 (1970), Gattaca(1997), Equilibrium(2000), Code 46(2003) and The Island (2005).

The other direction for modern Sci-Fi is Man-vs-Robot, or computer intelligence. Some movies in that genre are I-Robot (2004), A.I. Artificial Intelligience (1999), the Matrix movies, and the sublime Bladerunner(1982).

And then there's man vs. Alien, but that's a whole other story, And from there there's Man vs. the One Ring & the Orc Army, or Potter vs. Golden Snitch.  Fantasy has a place.

Sci-Fi represents a deep vein of Metaphysical BS which Hollywood should continue to mine - I wait with baited breath.",1133568000,9,4114,5.090909090909091

- REVIEW

Hey, you!  Yea, you!  Are you one of those people that seen the previews of ""Aeon Flux"" and thinking, ""Woah!  This movie's so gonna suck; I mean, ""Catwoman"" suck""?  Well, my unseen random consumer...I cannot blame you: the concept looks awkward, the stunts are glorified, and Theron's costume screams out ""blech!"".  My thoughts haven't changed, but within 700 words, my thoughts will render how this 1-star predicted disaster convert into a shocking 3-star entertaining romp.

With 1-star on my mind, I have to grasp into the story, which is about as comprehensible as Dubya Bush making his speech.  In about 7 years from now, 99% of the Earth's pop is dead from a virus...possibly from the avian flu.  Those that survived are on scientific notice, and one Trevor Goodchild conducted a cure that will purity the remains...sort of.  All I know is that 400 years into the future, one 'psychedechnical' (Psychedelic meets Technical) city holds the survivors under control of the Goodchild regime, runned by the same guy who cured them 400 years ago (???).  But the rebels against the regime's reign continues to weaking his power, though the territorial rebels are destroying for the good, as the regime are really hostile that often kills certain civilians that might corrupt the nation's premise.  In other words: Government = bad; ""bad guys"" = good.  Only one Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), a high-ranked fighter of the rebels, has the strength to take down something as confusing as the regime.

So, Ms. Theron here fights the government wearing clothes that ranges from ""Awful"" to ""Not awful like the last one"", although I doubt Theron would degrade herself to wear the old revealing get-up the original femme fatale wore on the animated show.

Anyway, the ""future"" remains uncertain, and by uncertain, I mean I have no idea how anything I see in this film work.  How did Aeon's weapons work, how do the futuristic security system function, how is swallowing some pill got Aeon get in touch with the leader of the rebels from her mind, and what are the foods these people are eating?  It seems as though the movie just goes into the future setting without any hint of social explanation.  At least the producers kept the atmosphere in spirit of the original series, along with its intended characters and premise.  And as long as you can tolerate some of the actors goofy one-liners, the characters act well, and Theron is a good Aeon, which is why the star went up a pound.

Another pick-er-upper is the fact that the movie has layers, albeit layers done very sloppy.  As Aeon confrots Trevor to assassinate in a vengeful manner, as she should, a revelation occurs when love and secluded past memories affected her way of thinking.  Neither had killed each other, which resulted in a backlash between the regime and rebels.  That's when the good part sets in, as many mysteries of the film (but not all) have been revealved that deals with the past, the search for a cure, and cloning.  Now, she and Trevor alone are on their own mission to find a solution to the nation's problem, while getting away from the regime who not only considered them as fugitives, but so has the rebels who now wants to kill Aeon.

""Aeon Flux"" is not so bad, I was really surprised.  The abrupt and incohesive premise should've been dealt with more ""flux""-iblilty, but the fact remains: it's not boring, it had some cool action scenes, and it had a solid story as it progresses.  As long as you don't think of this as Theron's big hit like ""Monster"" or ""North Country"", this film will give you a decent time.

2511461,3,B000E991HA,"First off, I have only seen segments of the Liquid Television ""Aeon Flux"" animated episodes back in the 90's, so I'm not qualified to give an in-depth comparison to this movie. And two, I think politics should be left out of it...therefore I won't comment on Hollywood's left/right influence on this movie or anything like that. I'm reviewing it based on its merits alone and nothing else.

That out of the way, I found ""Aeon Flux"" to be a dumbed-down, watered-down, yet entertaining version of the animated series. Although I have mentioned above that I didn't see that much of the original in the 90's, I saw enough of it to say that as usual, Hollywood has toned down the sex & violence so that it gets a safe, for-the-masses PG-13 rating. Fanboys of the original series are going to throw popcorn at the screen, and are advised to skip it. But for the rest of us, I suppose it's an adequate sci-fi/action brainless flick that doesn't challenge anyone and merely asks that one put their brain on neutral.

Although Charlize Theron is WAY too attractive for the role of Aeon and basically phones in her performance, she does a commendable job with what she is given to work with. A large part of this movie relies on her sex appeal and it never apologizes for it. And in all fairness it does have some other good qualities, mainly the special effects and futuristic set designs that are at least original even if implausible. Some work could have been done on the fight sequences, which were amateur and even boring at times.

All in all, I recommend ""Aeon Flux,"" but only if you have some extra cash leftover and/or are a big fan of Charlize Theron (she is after all quite easy on the eyes in this movie). But if you're trying to save some money and want to limit your movie watching, give this one a pass and wait for ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"" or ""King Kong,"" which will surely be light years better.",1133568000,4,1917,4.502873563218391

8107730,3,B000E991HA,"watched aeon flux (2005). i used to passingly watch the old mtv cartoon, and i've been wanting to check this out, especially when i learned it was directed by karin kusama (xx, the invitation). this movie feels to me like one where the first half was the directors vision, and the latter half felt like studio interference. to whit, there was a real thoughtful restraint to gun play in the beginning of the movie, which seemed to be discarded by the end. and while the approach to many aspects of the science fiction of the movie, especially in the case of information/media/computers/communication are clever and inventive, much of the plot felt cliched and frankly underdeveloped. charlize theron is utterly a$$kicking, and is alone worth watching this movie for, displaying the perfect combo of ninjitsu prowess and aggrieved revolutionary and woman with a murky past. the visuals are pretty nice, too, and a lot of the set design is a pretty clever, interesting take on future society. at only 90 minutes, one can't help think that kusama was hijacked and some of her vision trimmed away in lieu of thoughtless violence; there feel like two movies here, the thoughtful one and the banal one.",1523145600,,1195,4.891625615763547
8107731,4,B000E991HA,"I decided on four stars when I realized that this really is best regarded as a YA film.
And one of the better YA films at that.
Like the /Divergent/ films it combines a walled-in humanity with an awful lot of violence.
And it doesn't take three films to get beyond the wall either. This makes it feel a bit rushed at times.
I've never seen the TV series, so I can't comment on how it relates to that.",1522454400,,400,4.075949367088608

8107735,5,B000E991HA,"Certainly not the best Science Fiction movie made, but I really enjoyed it when it came out. It's interesting for it's time and generally well done.",1521158400,,148,4.730769230769231
8107736,4,B000E991HA,"I like this movie for a lot of the sci-fi elements incorporated into the plot and world building, so when I saw this brand new Steelbook for it I decided to pick it up even though I already had the regular blu-ray.  The disc that comes with this Steel is exactly the same one that you get with the normal blu-ray just repackaged in a Steelbook case.  While it would have been nice to get a new master of the movie or at the very least something new, even if just new special features with this release, I fully expected that they might just repackage the old release, but at least the regular blu-ray was pretty decent to start with.  Though this does come with more in terms value than the regular blu-ray, you get a DVD copy of the movie, not that that's such a big deal these days, but you also get a digital copy as well which is probably more relevant and useful to most people.  The art for this Steelbook is pretty nice looking, I like the color of it the most.  Paramount released a bunch of their movies in Steels like this one and some of the others in the group look terrible.  Overall I'm glad I got this, it looks cool and was a good value for the $10 I got it for, if you can get it for that or cheaper I do recommend this release more than the regular blu-ray.",1520294400,3,1275,4.120967741935484
8107737,5,B000E991HA,"Aeon Flux has a very unique flavor. An interesting taste that is so different it may take a little bit of swishing around in your eyeholes to decide whether you like it or not. Ive never read the graphic novels nor have I seen a single full episode of the epic MTV animated series upon which the movie is loosely based. I just thoroughly enjoy the design and feel and the unusual plot of this movie. Very creative, and in my opinion, well done.",1518048000,,444,4.2976190476190474
