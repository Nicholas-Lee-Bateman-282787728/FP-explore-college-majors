6315060,5,B00J2FGZI0,I listen to the most gruesome of stories while I'm falling asleep....it's because of Peter Thomas - he can make everything sound ok and is such a calm voice. I've talked to others and know I'm not alone. There's a reason they run this series late at night! LOL. Never tire of Forensic Files and the stories of how they catch the bad guys in the most amazing ways. There is no doubt there will be future discoveries in the field and I can't wait to hear of them. I just hope Peter Thomas continues to do all narration! Kudos for him for his style and the ability to tell a story.,1485475200,2,578,4.169642857142857

6315099,5,B00J2FGZI0,"Riveting! it tells the actual story, complete with as many of the original victims and perpetrators as possible, with all the intricate forensic information that at times is the only way they could catch the killer back then. Made back in the 1960's thru 1990's, before a lot of the modern technology of today, the detectives and prosecutors and specialists in many areas, work together to bring about the justice of old. Today, with all the internet options available, the truth is often obscured and the killers freed on technicalities or ""leaked"" information, these episodes bring back thoughts of true justice as I remember it being, long ago. Also the crime scenes are shown as they actually were, and not as they can be made to appear, with todays modern artistry. The detectives and their teams did the actual work and that is shown in detail as it was often written in long hand ..........truly an inspiring series!",1483401600,,923,4.848101265822785

Also,  there is a  weird thing about FF, they often show original police photos of the scenes. Not a big fan of that but scientifically it is interesting. ( warning: these are super dated.) As with so many other things forensics has come a long way, but this is how it was.

6315196,3,B00J2FGZI0,"The show is obviously sad due to the content. . However solving these heinous crimes is vital and this show helps us understand how that can be done through forensics.  There is nothing boring about forensics, until you dive into the later seasons of this show.  The earlier seasons are laid out and narrated more effectively than the later seasons. In the later season the constant repeating and overlapping of information become quite boring, whereas the earlier seasons get to the point and stick with it.  At first I thought it was due to having been edited around commercials, but it streams here without commercials putting the redundancy front and center at an all time high.",1474243200,,682,4.862068965517241

6315263,4,B00J2FGZI0,"Loving this series. The reenactments aren't as corny and excessive as many I've seen and the narration is concise and not too corny either. The episodes being short makes them clear and to the point and don't go in as many circles with tedious info u don't want to know like some specials on 20/20 and other shows do at times, making it hard to keep up. So these are perfect. I like that they have gotten real ppl from the crimes and cases giving their experience and notations, and not random ppl giving their 2 cents and speculations. Very cool to learn what little things they can have to go on to solve a crime. I feel like very few true crime shows and specials have ever mentioned going into this amount of forensic detail to bust a case open successfully, which is odd to me. There's a few episodes not as interesting as others, mostly the very historical ones with less live accounts/photos/videos and are mostly historians giving their synopsis/speculations.... and a few episodes that just don't catch your attention as much. These episodes are far and few though... like 2 or 3 per season. The rest are gold. And because I'm super into True Crime, sometimes I find cases covered by multiple documentaries over the years so they're old to me. So far ALL these cases are new to me which is awesome.",1468022400,2,1307,4.5423728813559325

There are no commercials on the Amazon Prime but on networks this would not have been the case.  I wish I could edit out the restatements.  Testimonials from law enforcement and attorneys varies widely in quality.  The re-enactments are necessary but I wish there was less of that and more photos of the crime scenes.  Unfortunately on Amazon, the software doesn't remember where you left off and you have to either guess or have a written reference point.

6315308,5,B00J2FGZI0,"I have been watching Forensic Files for years and I love it. It's interesting and informative. The only downside to this is the truncated episode list.  I'd love to see them all.
On a more personal note, It's funny how distanced you can become from the subject matter until you see an episode with someone you know. I am friends with the family of one of Mark Hofman's victims (Postal Mortem) and it was hard to watch the footage. My heart aches for everyone involved in these tragedies. Still fascinating stuff, but so easy to forget how real it is! That episode was quite a shock.",1465344000,7,582,4.490566037735849

Because each is only a half-hour long,the writing is much tighter and,frankly,more interesting,than the hour long true crimes on broadcast television such as 48 Hours and Dateline. Forensic Files doesn't bog down with continuously repeated information and the usual back-and-fill of the longer form programs.

6315796,4,B00J2FGZI0,I use to watch all the true crime shows when I had cable.  Since cancelling it these shows are the only programs I truly miss.  Forensic Files was the first and I watched them over and over because of the simplicity and of course exciting narration of Peter Thomas.  I would imagine what he looks like and who he was or is.  He has a talent and it would be nice to hear him read audio books of the same venue.  The series itself is unfortunately dated and regrettably it has not kept pace with the many changes in forensic science and the battle to fight crime.  But they were the pioneers and they should be lauded for it.  It is well worth the time if you have never seen a true crime program.,1411689600,,695,4.141791044776119

6315856,4,B00J2FGZI0,"This is a GREAT CSI type show. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because each show is only 22 minutes long. Each show features only one crime scene investigation. They could combine about three shows together and make it an hour long show. Its all good material, and covers the science forensic angle. I just got bored of watching it because as soon I played one episode, it was over.",1405900800,,398,4.32

The narrator is easy to understand and they really go into specifics whenever they can. I prefer to watch how they catch somebody when they commit a crime than listening to a felon bragging about it.

My favorite detective is Sherlock Holmes because he observed and commented on forensic evidence he saw in the stories by E.C. Doyle.",1403308800,,462,4.634146341463414

8647368,4,B00J2FGZI0,"I find the science behind the research totally fascinating.  Not only are there smart people in the world but how they can do the
minute detail work after such scenes are left is beyond brave.  I haven't watched this dvd but have seen episodes on TV from this
time frame.  The thing that is most alarming is that I have noticed that many perpetrators who were convicted for the most gruesome crimes
get only 20 years.  I believe this mean they can get out in like ten.  Many seem to be handsome young men mixed up in drugs.  Women
should be warned.  Who would think that this could happen?  And, some coworkers seem sort of nonchalant about discussing the gruesome
crime.  It is almost like they had a crush on the handsome psychotic offender.  It helps me to better understand why people are reluctant to
give up their right to bear arms.  Even the investigators comment on the heinous nature of the crime.  And, they just get 20 years in states like
Ohio, California and Washington.  I wonder if people know about this because I would think the general public would be outraged.  If they were
caught red handed and confessed why only 20 years?  It is nuts.",1498089600,,1158,4.5
