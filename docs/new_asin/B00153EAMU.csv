8257288,5,B00153EAMU,Don Wyant's account of surviving cancer was encouraging and personal. I found it great that someone could simply share their story and attitude for no other reason than that Don believes that your thinking goes a long way to beating cancer. Worth watching.,1204243200,,256,4.976744186046512
