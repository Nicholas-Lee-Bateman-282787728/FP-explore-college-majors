4046233,3,B0030HT8FS,"For decades, many people in Europe grew up reading the ""Largo Winch"" novels (by Jean Van Hamme) or the Belgian comic book series (by Philippe Francq and Jean Van Hamme) have been intrigued by this character and its action-packed storyline.

The novels would lead to a TV series in Germany in 2001 and in 2008, a French film titled ""Largo Winch"" was released, followed by a sequel titled ""Largo Winch II: The Burma Conspiracy"" in 2011. Directed by Jrme Salle (writer of ""The Tourist"", ""Duplicity"" and ""Anthony Zimmer""),  ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" would be nominated for ""Best International Film"" at the 2012 Saturn Awards and now, the first film titled ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" will be released on DVD courtesy of Music Box Films in March 2012.

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

The film is presented in widescreen 2:35:1 and presented in French and English 5.1 Dolby Digital with English subtitles. While the film has been released on Blu-ray in other countries, as of now, Music Box Films will be releasing ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" on DVD.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The DVD comes with a special digital comic of ""Largo Winch"" Issue #1 ""The Heir"", the Making of Largo Winch featurette and the theatrical trailer.

JUDGMENT CALL:

While watching ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"", there is no doubt that this French film was a major attempt to create an action thriller along the lines of ""Bourne Identity"", ""Die Hard""etc.

First the good news.  The good news is that for action fans, what you get with ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" is a straight-up popcorn action film.  A lot of vehicles are totaled, a lot of firearms are fired and a lot of fighting.  Also, because the eponymous Largo Winch is not your average protagonist and is rough around the edges, he's definitely a character that kicks a lot of ass!

Now the not so good news.

It's formulaic and overly predictable.  But the worst offender is the spotty acting in this film.

""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" had intriguing potential but according to fans, the French film strays away from the comic books too much for its own good.  Among the criticisms is that Largo Winch is to supposed to live in the New York at the Winch Building but instead, he operates from a yacht near Hong Kong and not all characters are represented in this first film.

The film has an international flavor, which is great!  Unfortunately, the acting is quite weak and while the English conversations will work on most countries outside of the United States, for me, some characters don't seem natural enough in their dialogue and it really makes this film out to be more of a B-film.  Most of the time, I was hoping Kristin Scott Thomas would come back on screen because at least she is actress that can deliver and possibly save the scene.

Along with Kristin Scott Thomas, I did enjoy seeing Tomer Sisley as Largo Winch.  I know the character may be too different from what people have read and seen of the character in the original comic book series, but I felt he did a good job playing Largo Winch.  He doesn't have the typical muscles-bulging action hero, if anything, he seemed like a stoic, carefree free spirit doing whatever he wants and he fit that mold perfectly.

And also, it was great to see ""Babylon A.D."" actress Melanie Thierry playing the double role of Lea/Naomi and although her scenes were limited to a sex and massage scene and few other minor shots, the actress also had wonderful chemistry with actor Tomer Sisley onscreen.

Overall, I really wanted to enjoy ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" and really hoped to see an action thriller with the comic book hero Largo Winch and if anything, show that Europeans can make excellent action thrillers based on a comic book character.  I was hoping to watch a film with not just attention to the action but overall storyline but ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" became too simplistic and banal.

After all, with the corporate backstabbing and your not so clean cut protagonist, this could have been a film that would rival James Bond, Jason Bourne or John McClane.  And while the film started off with a lot of excitement, with plenty of action and a passionate sex scene all within the first 20-minutes of the film, unfortunately the pacing starts to go way off, the storyline and acting starts to spiral downward and all that is left is the film's action sequences which were good but not awesome!

In the end, ""The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch"" will appeal to audiences wanting a straightforward popcorn action film.  Nothing more, nothing less.",1335571200,,4568,4.76015228426396
4046234,1,B0030HT8FS,"This is the same movie as ""Largo Winch"" released in 2010. It's just got a different cover and name and is being sold as the follow up which it isn't. ""Largo Winch 2"", called ""The Burma Conspiracy"", is not yet released for North America. Despite the duplicity if not dishonesty the French, in this and as they often do, still produce creative action, chase, thriller movies. So four stars for that aspect with dialogue being it's primary weakness along with a few over-the-top implausibilities.",1334620800,5,493,4.880952380952381

4046236,4,B0030HT8FS,"I don't like movies with subtitles. They usually distract and take away from a movie.  The Heir Apparent has subtitles, but I really didn't notice.

The scenery was fantastic, the acting was pretty good, Mlanie Thierry is absolutely gorgeous and the script was great for an action movie. How often do you have the 'bad' guy say, ""I'm the bad guy in this book.""

Read the other reviews for a plot synopsis, but the plot twists were good and if you can suspend your belief in how long it actually takes to fly across the world, it all comes together.

A hidden gem for the action film fan out there, and don't be afraid of subtitles.",1328832000,2,631,4.413793103448276
4046237,3,B0030HT8FS,"It's nice to see character in an action thriller, Jack Bauer never got this much backstory that I remember. However, character alone does not make up for plot holes one can drive a carrier group through. Nor does it make up for acting that imitates the sound of wood. What I liked, as part of the tradition of European cinema, was the rich attention to detail in the movie- colors, tapestries, landscape, all create a sensuality to the visual landscape that places one firmly in it. But, visual narrative techniques cannot supplant plot holes and cartoonish dialogue. Example A- in the midst of a critical board meeting, an initial suspect for the murder of Nerio Winch is himself assassinated, in front of the entire board of Nerio Winch's company, by gunshot wounds to the head. The filming is graphic. The protagonist, Largo Winch, Nerio's adopted son, attempts to follow the assassin. The scene ends with his discovery of a favorite secretary of his father's sitting on the toilet. They casually exchange pleasantries before she closes the door to resume her business. This is the end of the sequence to the assassination of the accountant for his father's company. None of the scenes subsequent mention or allude to the fact of the assassination. Instead, the next scene depicts the board as it convenes to scheme on how to defeat the takeover attempt by a Russian baddie, with no reference to the dramatic death which had occurred in front of them moments earlier. Also, hearing these actors deliver their lines made me appreciate Hollywood studio actors all the more. The thud of Largo Winch's dialogue, in some cases, was almost sonically audible.",1323129600,,1655,4.914285714285715
4046238,5,B0030HT8FS,"My only real standard for a movie is that it be entertaining without resorting to shock value or cheap tricks, such as lots of explosions (think Transformers), in order to be entertaining.  This movie was great because it was very entertaining and didn't resort to using either of the two.  It had car chases, fight scenes, beautiful women, beautiful skylines, beautiful geography, a good sound-track, and some surprises thrown in.  All very well done.  And all of it was somewhat believable - nothing ridiculously unbelievable like is often seen in a Tom Cruise movie or a Will Smith movie.  Actually, for some reason this reminded me a little of a James Bond movie, except this movie was actually good. And it was 100x better than the Marvel comics crap that seems to be all the rage nowadays.  I gotta start watching more foreign (non-American) movies...that is where the good stuff is nowadays.  If you like well-done action/thriller movies, I recommend this 100%.",1322265600,19,968,4.938271604938271
4046239,5,B0030HT8FS,"Movie lovers know that French action movies ain't that bad at all (Nikita, Leon, and many more support that) . This movie is not exception.
I just can't understand how come French producers don't make more efforts to put their movies in more countries. Hence why this movie never made it to my collection before.
I missed Spanish subtitles, since it is my mother language, and extras (this DVD has none), but it does have a nice packaging that makes it look like collectible.
If you don't need more languages besides English or French, you can definitely buy this movie and you won't regret it.
I hope you find my review helpful.",1301788800,25,629,4.625
4046240,5,B0030HT8FS,"This one slipped under the radar as a solid action/suspense movie, yet there appears to be no distribution here in the States. A worthy DVD though and my customers have been asking for it daily.

The story follows an unwilling yet physically and mentally adept heir to a multi-billion dollar corporate empire as he trots the globe, first for himself then later throughout the film to find who murdered his father and is conspiring to take over the Group. The camera work is great as they went all over the world to film and used some beautiful aerial angles with each switch. The story is told out of sequence over five different times in our main character's life, but I enjoyed how they played out, especially with the final two plot twists. There are a couple scenes where you have to suspend some reality (James Bond-ish kind of events) but they kept it real otherwise.

The picture quality is good, but it NEEDS a Blu treatment as this could be an amazing transfer. The sound is solid, with both English and French mixed tracks, and a reversible cover that is either French or English text. The five interview supplements all last less than a few minutes but are French only with no subtitles. For those that might be concerned, almost half of the movie is in English at varying times, but the scenery, stunts and pacing can keep the attention span if the remaining subtitles bother you that much.",1297468800,41,1402,4.626506024096385

I tried to like this movie, filled with handsome men, beautiful women, exotic locations, corporate intrigue, chase sequences, double-crosses, shamen (shamans?), tattoos, luxury yachts, crashing surf, remote monasteries, bared flesh, money, power and schemes.  I really did.  It just felt like it lacked any heart.

I was thankful that the whole movie wasn't sub titled, but there was a lot of traveling for Largo and so many places has sub titles.  The movie centers around two male leads.  The father, who is killed at the beginning of the movie and the adopted son who is heir to a multi-billion dollar estate.  Largo is the underdog and under estimated by the corporate executives.  But his father taught him well in his early years so he was prepared for what he must do after his father is murdered.

4046256,4,B0030HT8FS,"Most of the other reviews say it all... so I won't bore you.

Largo Winch (Tomer Sisley) is the adopted heir of a multi-billionaire who dies and leaves him his fortune. But the treasure is not just laying around for him to soak in... Largo has to fight to take and keep what is his from pretty much anyone with a pulse in his life.

I enjoyed this movie even with the sub titles. It is shot with multiple languages woven into the discourse including English. That added to the meatiness like a good stew. Don't be looking for James Bond (Daniel Craig) style action or even physiques but the 'fisticuffs' in the various knife fights and kickem ups are good and scrappy.

Tomer Sisley does a good job showing a range of emotions in this movie. He is not a polished actor but he has some raw talent and a genuine face... i.e. his emotions are very believable. I did find him a bit 'Kramer-like' in some of the running scenes but he has that type of face and hair so it was inevitable.

Steve Waddington shows up in a bad guy role and it the first time I have seen him since he was hung up in a fire in the Last of the Mohicans. He has been in a few other flicks since then but they haven't been on my watch list. All in all... you won't be disappointed in the rental. Definitely not a PG-13 as there is a steamy 40 second love scene with some after glow, 'heavy petting' as well as some death, gore and blood with gun shots to the head and body and a drowning/murder scene.

Against other movies similar to this I would have gone 3 stars but there were some good plot twists, cinematography, beautiful scenery and action so I bumped it up as it worked hard to differentiate itself. Enjoy!",1401926400,,1685,4.2367601246105915

Some of the film is subtitled with small portions that remain in the original language without subtitles, but that did not detract from the enjoyment or understanding of the film because the acting was the predominant carrier of the story.

4046310,4,B0030HT8FS,"One of the best features of this movie is something that it lacks, Hollywood. It has plenty of action without all of the crazy Hollywood glitz and explosions. It was easier to get immersed into the story line and stick with the characters. Granted, it wasn't a spectacular movie but that it one of the reasons it's actually pretty good. There was a few spots that I found myself reading the subtitle's since my vocabulary is limited to English, rusty Spanish, and broken French but it was still enjoyable. I'd recommend this title to fans of the action/adventure genre.",1399420800,,569,4.757575757575758

The acting was surprisingly good also along with a plot line that keeps you from looking away for a second.  The camera usage was unbelievable with scenery and set selection beyond reproach.  I highly recommend this for evryone that doesn't mind some subtitling.  Bravo!,1399420800,,477,4.780487804878049

Although the overall setting is that of a corporate world, it certainly doesn't lack for physical action as well as intellectual action.
From the onset of the movie, suspense is immediately established.
There is so much backstabbing, figuratively and physically~!

4046335,4,B0030HT8FS,This movie was intriguing!  My only complaint was the flashbacks and the way they were presented as they were a bit difficult to follow in that they were oddly placed IMO.  Plot had some unexpected twists and was a combination of drama/action thriller.,1398470400,,252,4.837209302325581

4046341,5,B0030HT8FS,The movie was riveting. I read the reviews and thought I would take a chance. It was well-acted and the story was very interesting.

4046342,5,B0030HT8FS,"It's easy to get attached to the main actor in the film, Largo.  I wasn't bored during the film.  It was an unknown film to me, I just picked it, and was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it.",1397865600,,197,4.0256410256410255

4046344,4,B0030HT8FS,"A film in both French and English, the use of subtitles during the French scenes in no way detracts from what was an exciting action film.  The story is told from a timeline perspective, starting with the current day then explaining the cause of the action through a series of flashbacks.  While this is often done in more ""Artsy"" movies, it isn't a regular offering in the action film genre, since it can slow down the pace of the movie.  In this case, however, the flashbacks are the only time you get to breathe ... the director weaves differing levels of action in with moments of singular clarity that move the story forward.  With one small exception (in my opinion).  The main character development starts off as spoiled rich kid who despises money and his father's empire ... and ends up with him fighting to find out who killed his father and taking over that same (once evil) empire.  The jump between attitudes is sudden and unexplained ... I would bet that time restrictions caused some character development to be left on the cutting room floor.  This is a movie where I would like to see a director's cut.  Still in all, it's a very good flick.  The last couple of scenes are quite thematic and manage to cover the topics of recognition and understanding (big picture/epiphany) while bringing the film full circle from alone to alone.  No spoilers, but the full circle is nicely done.",1397779200,,1398,4.646341463414634

It had the right amount of action for my other half & a decent story line for me.  The only drawback were the intermittent subtitles.  This is not the type of movie you should watch if you are tired. A well thought out & original story.,1395273600,,380,4.026666666666666
4046378,1,B0030HT8FS,The script was jumping all over the place and we the watcher were left to put all the pieces together. Well I didn't get all the pieces as I spent more time trying to figure out what was happening rather than enjoying a film. No Kudos here. Finally the movie ended and I was not pleased with the outcome. Left confused and not wanting to see this film ever again. No reccomendations to others from this viewer.,1395273600,2,410,4.337662337662338
4046379,3,B0030HT8FS,"A disjointed global jaunt trying to be something between a Jason Bourne and James Bond thriller. Nice scenery, but that's about it.",1395014400,,131,5.0
4046380,5,B0030HT8FS,"Great movie. Would watch it more than once. Plus, great looking actor who knows how to act. Want to watch more with him in it.",1394928000,,126,4.08
4046381,5,B0030HT8FS,"Had zero expectations for this movie....
But once it got going which was early on by the way, my wife and I were completely entertained.

Watch it you won't be sorry.

4046382,3,B0030HT8FS,"I generally like stories of the heroic but overmatched little guy going up against the big, bad corporation, and I liked this one too. It's strewn with a few too many plot twists and not enough explanation here and there, but the title character is watchable and overcomes the odds. Plus the movie takes place in a bunch of foreign settings I've never been to and probably never will, so there's that.",1394928000,,401,4.583333333333333
4046383,4,B0030HT8FS,A nice surprise. Talented multilingual cast and some great action scenes. James Bond meets Jason Bourne. A few twists in the plot makes the film unpredictable.,1394841600,,159,5.153846153846154
4046384,5,B0030HT8FS,"It's hard to find many 4-5 star movies in the Amazon collection, but this movie was very entertaining - some drama, some action, and pretty good acting. The end had a good twist. It's definitely worth your time.",1394841600,,211,4.578947368421052

4046387,4,B0030HT8FS,This is an entertaining movie with a fast moving story about the life of main character Largo Winch who is a reluctant heir to a fortune.  Largo gets pulled from his isolation into the fast paced world of money and greed where things and people are never what they seem.  Largo's strong character serves him well in sorting out whom to trust and what to do as a series of plot twists turn his world upside down.,1394409600,,411,4.324675324675325
4046388,5,B0030HT8FS,Awesome movie  a lot of truth to the movie about how life and power can do you wrong great ending,1394323200,,97,3.85
4046389,5,B0030HT8FS,What a story! Sort of like James Bond! Lots of action. The plot jumped from different decades and was a bit hard to keep up with but the story and acting were really good. Liked it a lot,1394236800,,186,3.9210526315789473

4046391,4,B0030HT8FS,This movie started out slow but got more interesting as it went on. Has a nice twist and ending is predictable just before the end. Good movie and recommended,1393891200,,158,4.482758620689655
4046392,4,B0030HT8FS,Good twists on story line.  Just did not see any purpose to the girl who framed the main character. It is a good movie to watch on a weekend evening.,1393891200,,149,3.966666666666667

4046394,5,B0030HT8FS,"Thrilling and fast paced. Though a predictable storyline, the movie and the characters capture our attention, maybe because I started watching without any expectations. With all elements for a good movie, I would say-watch it!",1393804800,,226,5.485714285714286

to make its point.",1393545600,,182,5.535714285714286
4046398,5,B0030HT8FS,"An intelligent action movie that sustained my interest all the way through. The story switched from past to present a few times, which was somewhat confusing. Different corrupt groups of people have an interest in gaining ownership of a multi-billion dollar corporation after owner is murdered. A surprise heir shows up, and they try to manipulate him with their own interests in mind. How it will all turn out and who will gain the upper hand is the question that makes this movie good.",1393459200,,487,4.809523809523809
4046399,4,B0030HT8FS,A storyline well honed to maintain continuity of the characters and great action sequences. It is a film I will probably watch again!!,1393459200,,134,4.869565217391305
4046400,5,B0030HT8FS,"The story line was great. It kept me guessing throughout the movie as to who of all the characters, who can you trust? The movie goes in and out with the characters. Is it the body guard, the girl in the one night stand, the adopted brother, the father's right hand person? The action was great. The scenery was great. I think if the main actor was someone like Liam Neesan, the movie would be more widely viewed. But the main actor did a great job. Good movies are hard to find. I ususally can't get into most, but this one, I would recommend to action viewers.",1393286400,,562,4.261682242990654
4046401,4,B0030HT8FS,"It'll make for a fun lazy afternoon's viewing. Plenty of action and rather more realistic physical action than you get in big-budget movies with their frankly ridiculous stunts, which I can appreciate.",1393113600,,201,5.3125
4046402,3,B0030HT8FS,"This movie was very good, a little action with lots of compassion with a little touch of evil.  Very good.",1392940800,,106,4.3
4046403,1,B0030HT8FS,Might have been a good movie but it was in another language.  I don't like reading the captions in a movie,1392854400,,106,4.0476190476190474
4046404,1,B0030HT8FS,The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch [HD]  was not my cup of tea.  I was not able to stay with the first ten minutes of it.  The synopsis and video cover did not fit the beginning of the movie.,1392768000,,187,3.8684210526315788
4046405,5,B0030HT8FS,Don't let the subtitles dissuade you - a good half of the movie is in English.  This is really an old style action adventure movie.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The male lead is wonderfully suited for the narrow escapes he makes frequently. Pure entertainment. Don't miss it.,1392768000,,291,4.452830188679245
4046406,1,B0030HT8FS,"Seriously, it's not worth the time. The plot has more hole than a colander, and none of the characters have any development. Why should we care about this person who is dying? I get the impression that there are many many missing scenes, and I am thankful that I didn't have to see them.",1392508800,,287,4.333333333333333
4046407,5,B0030HT8FS,"I had never heard of it nor of the actors in it, but it had more exotic locations than a Bond movie. It was a story about a murdered billionaire, his heir and the treachery that folks who travel in that arena use to get control of those mountains of money and power. The movie makes understanding the works of US government a tad easier. Lots of violence, chases, crashes and murders, as  the bad guys will stop  at nothing to have their way. And in case you didn't know, everyone in that circle is for sale.",1392508800,,508,4.22680412371134
4046408,4,B0030HT8FS,Good but it can be better since some of the scenes were not believable in reality. Could be tweaked for better.,1392422400,,111,4.333333333333333
4046409,5,B0030HT8FS,"Never heard of this movie.  Just scrolling to find a good action packed movie to watch and this came up, I figured what the heck?  Loved every minute of it.",1392336000,,156,4.166666666666667
4046410,2,B0030HT8FS,"This movie has all the ingredients of a good action picture, however it just doesn't come together. The pacing was uneven, with incessant flashbacks to the main character's childhood, none of which raised the character to more than two dimensions. All the actors lacked any sort of screen charisma. This movie comes across a French film, trying somewhat hard to be an American action picture, with all the requisite scenes, but with a director and/or editor who just doesn't understand or appreciate the genre.",1392249600,,510,5.083333333333333

4046412,1,B0030HT8FS,"Very boring story line. I even  was unable to finish it. When I started to watch it I was hoping to see thought provoking thriller, but no, it was not this kind of movie.",1391990400,,170,4.0
4046413,5,B0030HT8FS,Enjoyed this movie very much.  Well casted and has a great story line.  Filled with action that was relevant and enganging to watch.  A great adverture movie with a well thought out story.,1391817600,,188,4.636363636363637
4046414,3,B0030HT8FS,"Thee movie has an interesting plot. A wealthy man has no heirs so he adopts a child. It has action, some fight scenes, mystery and decption.
Pretty good.",1391817600,,153,4.5

4046416,4,B0030HT8FS,"Pretty solid 4 stars. Good acting, good cast, decent action, sprinkled with intrigue and some twists. The subtitles, however, can be blurry and sometimes impossible to read. There is some English in the film, and Croat. Nice shot locations, and although sometimes the story is just a little too credulous, it is not a time-waster. The cast supports the story well, and the characters were fairly believable, minus one or two moments. Keeps you guessing in several parts, and the ending IS a little 'soft' but I enjoyed this movie pretty much for the entire hour and 40 or so minutes.",1391558400,,583,4.782178217821782
4046417,5,B0030HT8FS,"a great movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat.  if you like the mystery of "" The Usual Suspect"" then you'll like this movie.",1391385600,,132,3.888888888888889
4046418,4,B0030HT8FS,"I was a little hesitant after watching the trailer but it was an interesting film with enough action and story. More like 3.5 stars rather than 4 but I didn't regret it.

4046419,5,B0030HT8FS,"Really liked it, even though it was subtitled.  I had to watch it a second time to pick up more of the movie since I was reading so much the first time through.  I am a fan of foreign films",1390867200,,189,3.7

4046421,5,B0030HT8FS,"I read these comics in French during my childhood and fell in love with the storyline. This is a great Belgo/American movie adaptation of it, and does not disappoint. I'm actually a fan of some of the changes that they made (location of the HQ in Hong Kong instead of New York to represent power shift in the global economy for example), which also some exoticism.

The acting was fantastic and as a native French speaker, I appreciated the linguistic authenticity of the interactions between some characters. Not your typical Hollywood action movie - it had a strong European flair that I personally loved.",1390262400,,607,4.836538461538462

4046429,4,B0030HT8FS,"Surprisingly good, slick film with a likeable hero.  Action-packed and engaging.  Only gave it 4 stars because reality is stretched a bit too far in some scenes (like the timing of a villain's arrival after giving chase -- not humanly possible under any circumstances).  But it's still much better than many films of this genre, with an interesting story line.",1386806400,,360,4.966666666666667
4046430,4,B0030HT8FS,Largo Winch was a good suspense movie with good action.  Tomer Sisley was a good actor showing the character Largo Winch that I wish he could do more movies with that character.,1386720000,,177,4.53125
4046431,3,B0030HT8FS,It did not hold my interest. I am not a big fan of captions it interrupts the flow of the movie. I can say it was ok.  I did watch it to the end.,1386288000,,145,3.264705882352941
4046432,4,B0030HT8FS,"Pretty incredible movie. Awesome plot. Solid action. I could give it a 5-star, but for now, I'll leave it as a 4-star.

4046450,4,B0030HT8FS,"I found it refreshing and enjoyable. There were were story twists that were interesting, though some were not allowed to really have a life. While not 100% compelling and engrossing, the movie has a unique charm.  I loved the locations and languages.  Certainly a few story issues, but nothing that is terribly distracting.  I actually would have enjoyed it more with more character development, however the characters are mostly interesting and different than those that come from the run of the mill film character molds.  A film that would have done very well if not for the lazy audiences having to deal with languages.",1360454400,,623,4.961538461538462

If you are in the mood for something of more substance and meaning and great acting...well this aint it.  Tomer Sisley appears to be strictly an action hero, not much of an actor.  It is a little sad to see a truly fine actress like Kristen Scott Thomas sort of mailing this performance in.  A little like watching Judi Dench in a James Bond flick.",1358121600,,509,4.315789473684211

No Oscar nominations for the acting, but I thought the cast was well chosen and the performances were basically solid. When I realized Largo was going to be something of an action hero, I was initially skeptical of Sisley in the role...seemed a bit too pretty....but he carried it off very well. I thought the action scenes were exceptionally well done, and I'm not a particular fan of action scenes.  I did think some parts of the plot were a bit predictable, but I wouldn't recommend investing any effort on trying to figure things out. The fun in this movie is just watching it happen, and who cares how it all comes out.",1354665600,,780,4.409722222222222

4046456,2,B0030HT8FS,"Honestly, one of the stupidest movies ever. It plays across a grand canvas in exotic locales such as a Croatian island lagoon, a Brazilian Amazonian outback to the skyscrapers of Hong Kong's financial district. It looks like some sort of James Bond movie but mashes in all this corporate intrigue. The most laughable part is the climactic scene is set against this race to get to a ""general meeting"" at corporate HQ.

I do believe there are good-looking people in France but this French movie cast what is possibly the most unattractive lead actors ever. If the producers wanted us to connect with this Largo Winch (what is up with that name when the guy was supposed to be Croatian), you know looks do count. Throw in the hooker turned industrial espionage spy who although cute to some extent is no beauty...and then there's the always mannish Kristin Scott Thomas as well as the evil protagonist. Oh brother, if you are going to go this pseudo Bond route, at least cast some hot babe as the spy and an even hotter Daniel Craig meets Sean Connery as the hero.

The plot is completely ridiculous where (now get this) Largo has to retrieve the actual ten physical shares in the Winch Corporation that allow him to take over from his murdered father. These shares are not in some bank vault in Switzerland. No, they're in a safe on some abandoned island formerly used by a monastic order off Croatian shores.

I could go on but it almost has to be seen to be believed. It's like some B movie soap opera plot with a budget from the biggest Bond movies for the action scenes which, frankly, are not blow-your-socks-off Bourne flick level at all. In this day and age the movie comes across as cinematically great looking but as hollow as can be plot- and character development-wise.

The extras feature interviews all in French with the lead actor (Tomer Sisley...and you thought Largo Winch was a bizarre name, Homer...uh, Topher...uh, Tomer), KST, the author of the book (this plot is based on a book?), the screenwriter and the director.

Also, if you do want to watch this DVD, set the movie to ""English"" and the subtitles to ""None."" When the actors speak French or Croatian or whatever, subtitles will automatically pop up in English. It took me 20 minutes to figure that out as I thought this was a French movie at the start and set it for ""French"" with ""English"" set for the subtitles. You do that and you get subtitling as if the viewer is deaf. For example, when Largo and the hooker/spy are in Brazil you get the subtitle ""(moaning)"" in case you don't understand those noises they are making while getting it on.",1350518400,,2618,4.609442060085837

4046460,5,B0030HT8FS,"I'd never heard of this film, ""The Heir Apparent - Largo Winch"" - and if not for chance would never have watched it. Which would have been my loss. This is a solid, better than solid, adventure film with almost non-stop action, great scenery, fascinating characters, a twisty, thinking man's plot and heart. This French action flick is a great action movie that you could watch at least a couple of times without getting bored. It's a character study of the prickly relationship between a very rich man and boy he adopts as his heir, a murder mystery, a story of corporate intrigue, and while it goes all over the world, it's set primarily in Hong Kong and it's the best tourist promotion for that city I've ever seen. Hong Kong literally dazzles with its jewel-like beauty. And that heart I mentioned. There are real people and real emotions and real pain. They're very good actors. And keep an eye on the cutie who plays a key role throughout the film. She is a heart breaker. If you have a chance to see this, or buy this, do it. It's worth it.",1343606400,4,1047,4.458333333333333
4046461,5,B0030HT8FS,"This film is a very well done action adventure in the greatest sense of the word. It asks less of my suspense of disbelief than Indiana Jones and is arguably as entertaining. Well acted with a fine supporting cast, the dubbing and subtitles are excellent and detract not at all.

4046463,4,B0030HT8FS,"The version I saw was in English and French with English subtitles.

The movie starts with Nerio Winch(self made billionaire)being pulled into the water from his yacht(harbored in Hong Kong) and drowned. Then a cut scene of Nerio in an orphanage trying to adopt. The movie spends a lot of time in cut scenes to help build Largo and Nerio's character, which wasn't to bad. The movie starts to make sense a piece at a time.

There is a lot of action in the movie but this is not an popcorn action movie. The action sequences are very well done. Most of the fight scenes with Largo are hand to hand. I don't think Largo used a gun at all but the bad guys used them. There are no big explosions, no helicopter crashes, No lambo or Ferraris wrecked. This is a very budget conscious movie. As a matter of fact there car chase scene with a beautiful Bentley but Largo abruptly gets away. The movie is filled with corporate backstabbing, plot twist and action.

The acting was very well done. Most notably Tomer Sisley as Largo and Melanie Thierry as Lea/Naomi a sexy, sultry corporate spy for hire to whomever will pay her fee.

A few cons but nothing that kills the movie.
1) An accountant barges into a board meeting with urgent info for Largo but is assasinated thru a 2-way mirror and nothing is ever said after a small chase that the perp gets away and the board meeting concludes with a dead guy on the floor.???

2) Nothing is ever said about how Largo was trained so well in martial arts???

3) Largo is chased and shot off a 100 ft cliff and falls back first in the ocean but wakes up face down on shore....ok no problem...but he is shot in the upper left shoulder and is a thru and thru and never even puts his arm in a sling and doesn't seem to bother him......if you can make it through these problems you will have no problem liking this movie!

I recommend buying, renting or netflixing this movie for sure. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will come out on blue-ray!",1341532800,,1980,4.364130434782608

The plot is preposterous, the kind you'd find in a comic book. The dialog is wooden, the acting -- except for Kristen Scott -- is awful, the editing sucks and it's not even entertaining.  AVOID! If I could give it zero stars, I would.

As for those who gave this piece of sh*t five stars -- you must have watched a different movie from the one I saw, or you are seriously immature. This is a stupid waste of celluloid and time.",1341360000,2,638,4.291666666666667

4046467,3,B0030HT8FS,"This is not an easy movie for me to rate. On one hand it has a lot of flare and deftness. But on the other hand there is something wrong.

Here's the scoop. Nerio Winch, a self made billionaire, heads a huge but tumultuous empire. He is killed by a rival trying to stage a hostile takeover of his company, but he has an ace up his sleeve. He has an adopted son, Largo, who nobody knows about. Can Largo step up, take charge, get to the root of the takeover and thwart the dastardly plans of the perpetrators?

This feels a lot like the ""Bourne"" films. Very big and slick. It takes place over several countries so it has that feeling of international intrigue. The difference here is that you're dealing with big business as opposed to the intelligence community. But Largo poses a problem. In the beginning of the film he's a Bruce Wayne type. Big adventurer who seems to attract trouble. He rather shuns his father's wealth and privilege. But then he steps up and does an immediate 180. He not only knows the ins and outs of this world, he seems steeped in it. I didn't buy it. And it seems some scenes might have been cut because he'll untangle a really messy plot and the viewer doesn't see where he got the information to do so. And it all got wrapped up so nice and pretty at the end I almost went into a diabetic coma. Sorry. Things don't happen that way.

This is a fun film done up in big Hollywood style. All the production values were top of the heap. With the exception of a couple of odd cuts it was edited well. If you're given to this sort of thing you'll probably enjoy it. Don't expect the resonance of the ""Bourne"" films but enjoy it as best you can.",1338854400,,1667,4.252365930599369
4046468,3,B0030HT8FS,"I watched this on Instant (streaming) and wasn't sorry.  This film does have some foreign language (when it does it's mostly French I think) which does not take away from the enjoyment.  If you watch on a Roku XS you can enjoy this in HD and 5.1 Dolby Digital.

The fighting scenes are not in the style of defy-gravity, so you might be let down if looking for that.  Otherwise with a so-so storyline this flick (probably aims for the male audience) has some beautiful women, nice architecture, beautiful scenery, and interesting plot twists.  It's at least rental worthy.",1338681600,,571,4.7272727272727275
