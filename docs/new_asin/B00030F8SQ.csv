First, the bad:  video and sound quality isn't perfect; it's a little dim-looking, though nothing as bad as some old kinescopes I've seen.  The good:  these people are funny and as comfortable as an old shirt.  No, it's not realistic, but does someone want to stand up and tell me that Seinfeld or the Friends are more realistic?  That's what makes situation comedy what it is--the situations.  My favorite episode was David's 17th b'day, though I enjoyed them all.  The humor is mild by today's standards, the children respectful of their parents and others--definitely a step back.  Unlike so many of today's comedies, these presumed the parents really were better qualified at life than their children!  I thoroughly enjoyed these episodes, a steal at twice the price.",1101168000,2,845,4.846153846153846
