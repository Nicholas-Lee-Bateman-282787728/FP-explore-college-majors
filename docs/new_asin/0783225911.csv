53958,5,0783225911,How were John Wayne and Katherine Hepburn wasted  superstars in this movie? How is an old Marshall trying to  prove his worth a dull plot? What an absurd review. Watch  the movie. It is a touching story with an excellent  supporting female character!,978307200,7,250,4.744186046511628
53959,3,0783225911,"What a tragedy that Hollywood was able to unite two of the powerhouse superstars of cinema in one movie, but then saddle them with a plodding, boring and utterly pedestrian script. The chemistry between Wayne and Kate Hepburn is palpable and their scenes together are a joy to watch. But there are too few of such scenes to justify repeated viewings or to classify this movie as anything but average and a spent opportunity.
Hepburn is miscast as a crotchety, virginal spinster who pines in her heart for the Duke, but is too repressed to act on her instincts. The Duke's reprisal of Rooster Cogburn is interesting, and he delivers an excellent performance, but the script fails him time and again. Ultimately it's frustrating to watch two great stars wallow in this banal plot. One interesting element in the DVD version is the gorgeous Rogue river scenery which seems to come to life in this format.",969408000,6,901,4.782051282051282

54037,5,0783225911,"Released in 1975, Rooster Cogburn stars John Wayne as hard-drinking, but formidable Marshal Rooster Cogburn, who reluctantly teams-up with a missionary, Eula Goodnight (Katharine Hepburn), and a Native orphan, Wolf (Richard Romancito), to take down a band of ruthless outlaws who stole a wagon of nitro and guns in the Oregon wilderness. Richard Jordan plays the hardened leader of the owlhoots, who is assisted by a man that used to work for Cogburn (Anthony Zerbe). John McIntire has a small role as a judge.

Ive been wanting to see this movie for years, but never got around to it till now. I was a little apprehensive as I heard it was seriously flawed, but was pleasantly surprised by how good it is. In fact, it won a spot on my favorite Westerns list.

Lets first consider the nitpicky criticisms. One critic complained that a Gatling gun pops up out of nowhere when the protagonists are cornered, but Cogburn explained to Eula earlier at the Native Mission that there were guns in the wagon that the outlaws stole, along with nitro. Thus when they're later camping out (after confiscating the wagon) Rooster pulls out the Gatling gun in case the gang shows up. Wheres the beef? Another complaint is that the guy who plays Eulas father is only a year younger than Hepburn in real life. Who cares? He LOOKS old enough to be her father. Besides, his role is a glorified cameo and so it isn't even worth mentioning.

Another criticism is that the tone is too light, but the film has the same air as True Grit and Waynes other latter-day Westerns. Its an entertaining Western mix of serious drama with intermittent spurts of violence and occasional moments of amusement. Isnt that the way real life is? This is one of the things I like about the movie, its not one-dimensional. One last beef is that Ms. Goodnight constantly spouts platitudes and homilies and it gets old after a while, but this ties-in to her character arc: She just lost her father and many Native friends and so when she meets Rooster shes grim and intent on justice. But, as she & Wolf get to know the Marshal, she increasingly lets her hair down, so to speak.

Speaking of which, the highlight of the movie is the relationship that develops between Cogburn and Eula, as well the father/son rapport that grows between Cogburn and Wolf. They develop into a family of sorts and its heartwarming. The banter between Rooster and Ms. Goodnight is well-written and consistently amusing, particularly if you're familiar with the Bible. Another highlight is the Oregon locations, some of which are spectacular, like the river canyon in the final act. Not many Westerns were/are shot in Oregon and this makes for a unique Western ambiance.

This isn't to say that the movie is without flaws, however. For instance, is it likely that they would handle the nitro as seemingly careless as observed in the movie? Would any sane person cart boxes of nitro on a raft going down a river with a section containing serious rapids? It would be suicidal. But movies often amp-up things like this to make the characters and events larger-than-life. In short, this aint real life; its a MOVIE meant to entertain (but, don't get me wrong, I prefer realism).

The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in Oregon (Deschutes National Forest, Rogue River, Smith Rock State Park & Grants Pass) with a few scenes shot at Six Points Texas, Backlot, Universal Studios, California.

54083,5,0783225911,"What an absolute treasure of a film that is the perfect companion to the True Grit classic. John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn perfectly compliment one another in a film that is mostly a character study of the legendary Rooster Cogburn in a film that is both thrilling and warming in a way only John Wayne can deliver. It offers a number of insights into the Cogburn character, his motivations, the explanation for his eye patch, and plenty of Cowboy adventure to keep the Western faithful engaged and entertained throughout. Hepburn delivers a stellar performance that stands right with Wayne's as their characters get to know one another on their journey to find justice and get to it in one piece. It's a great time and a joy for anyone who is a John Wayne fan. If you're a fan of the True Grit film and were unaware it had a sequel, don't miss out. This absolutely stands with that film and does so without trying to be overly derivative in an effort to compete with it. Indeed, it actually compliments it. The Blu Ray edition is by far the best way to see this film with the picture beautifully cleaned up with crisp imagery and excellent sound.",1469836800,,1148,4.550724637681159

54109,3,0783225911,"Bottom Line First:
There is a lot to like in this John Wayne shoot `em up. Rooster Cogburn II, or The African Queen II Sorry I mean Rooster Cogburn and the Lady. Director Stuart  Miller gives a gently aging John Wane the chance to do all the things his fans loved watching him do. The Duke is in a comfortable role and goes through the motions well. No sex, lightest cursing, and the preacher lady gets to reform a drinker. Added bonus, mature adults have a romance without all the adolescent hormones.  Good old family values and the Duke why ask for more?

I never took John Wane seriously until&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shootist/dp/B00AEBB8YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shootist</a>. A great movie. With new eyes I when back to his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Alamo/dp/B00004ZBVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Alamo</a>&nbsp;and from there I made a major up grade in my appreciation for this performer. His costar Katherine  Hepburn had long been a favorite of mine. Watching her struggle with essential tremors did give a certain poignancy to her performance. The rest of the cast was pretty much there to support these two.

Ultimately Rooster Cogburn (Wayne ) and the Lady(Hepburn) is a roughly thrown together mash up of the very originals, True Grit and The African Queen. Two movies that made superior showcases for each of these two performers. In this movie, the two veterans work very well together. Conclusion, this is a movie that the fans of either KH or The Duke will love.

For me it was too much seen it before. I liked The African Queen better in the original. I liked that the original True Grit was a happy surprise. I got bored with the overlap. It irritated me to see how hard they worked to shove in scenes from African Queen. To his credit, Wayne did one of the best stumbling drunk scene this side of Lee Marvin (and his horse) in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cat-Ballou/dp/B00004TJQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cat Ballou</a>.

Almost all of the villainy and the big shoot up climax left me back from the edge of my seat and mostly cheering for it to end.",1460505600,,2238,5.432276657060519

Wish I would had purchased this a long time ago when it was originally released. It 'might' have had some extra features on the DVD.

One never knows... A lot of early DVD releases didn't have much in the way of extra features.

But rights to reproduce this DVD had probably bounced around a lot, including overseas. And a lot of times when the rights get licensed out, things get changed and altered.

I'm normally a huge John Wayne fan and absolutely adore Kathryn Hepburn, just not this time around for either.  And yes, I was extremely disappointed.  Was genuinely hoping to enjoy.

54207,5,0783225911,"Here is a movie that kicks you in the backside, and you don't know it until you land on your face. Rooster is a first-rate hero. Despite having let himself go, Rooster shows more grit and backbone than any ten sheriffs; furthermore, he does this while coming across as a man of kindness and compassion (not toward villains, however). This is the kind of hero that you have to like. Rooster guns down more villains than he takes to jail, but only because they don't give him any choice.  Both Wayne and Hepburn show why they are all-time greats. Hepburn plays a preacher's daughter who is forced to put up with Rooster's boozing as the pair hunts down her father's killer, and she turns out to have some grit herself. The dialogue was exceptional. The scenery was good, but the story and the characters were what made this a great classic.  --Roger Weston, author of The Golden Catch",1423267200,,882,4.575949367088608

54240,4,0783225911,"Rooster Cogburn has John Wayne reprising his role as U.S. Marshal Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn from True Grit that won him his only Academy Award of his legendary film career. The sequel of the said film is once again based on Charles Portis' novel True Grit and legendary actress Katherine Hepburn co-stars.

In it,Rooster is faced with a dilemma wherein he must win his badge back after he lost it due to his routine arrests that have ended in bloodshed. This time,he must bring down a group of bank robbers who has stolen a wagon shipment of nitroglycerin. He is assisted by his spinster daughter Eula Goodnight,who makes as an unwilling partner.

The sequel of True Grit fails short of being at par with the original as it basically rehashes the successful elements of the first film. It was also noticeable that both Wayne and Hepburn are somewhat uncomfortable with each other that both seem to look awkward on screen in the only film that they made together. But in spite of it,it would still provide a lot of enjoyment and entertainment for John Wayne and Western fans as it provides a lot of fun and action scenes.",1418947200,,1122,4.661616161616162

The scenery in this is simply beautiful. Seeing the on screen banter between Wayne and Hepburn is classic.
An all star cast featuring Anthony Zerbe, Jack Colvin (Mr. McGee from The Incredible Hulk series) and the great Strother Martin.

54324,5,0783225911,"While she acts a bit like Rose from African Queen, Katharine Hepburn is nonetheless marvelous in her role here as missionary Eula Goodnight in Rooster Cogburn (...and the Lady).  Rooster, aptly named, is a tough old bird with a hankering for whiskey and no love for a spinster lady nor an Indian boy thrust into his charge.  Add a bunch of low-lifes after a load of nitroglycerin, some fancy shooting, and beautiful Western scenery and you have a fun, classic movie.  The only other John Wayne movie own is The Quiet Man so it goes without saying I got it because of Kate.  Classy lady.  Wish I could have met her.",1395705600,,614,4.495495495495495

54329,5,0783225911,"This is another movie favorite of mine that I have waited a long time for on blu-ray. Now restored fully to it's glory it looks even better on blu-ray than it did on it's release when I saw it at the theater. The picture is crisp and clean and the gorgeous Oregon scenery looks almost 3D and stands out as much as it's two leading characters. Originally released as Rooster Cogburn and The Lady and to lackluster critical reviews it has stood up well against time and is still popular. Even the DVD release was disappointing in it's presentation of a fuzzy picture but now on blu-ray it looks wonderful and John Wayne and Catherine Hepburn's characterizations sparkle even more. The banter between the two is most enjoyable as the craggy Rooster Cogburn once again met his match in the craftiness of 'The Lady' preachers daughter who is able to draw from scripture like gun to befuddle and counterpunch Rooster's boasting and drinking ways to the point that he says to their other travelling companion ""She's scary"". And later on expresses his new respect to ""She's sumptin!"" all to hilarious effect. One of my favorite scenes is when they are under attack by the outlaws they are hunting and the head outlaw Hawk jokes that she couldn't shoot the Gatling gun where upon she opens up fire and cuts down trees and makes them duck for cover and then Rooster hollers up to them ""Ain't that the way it's done?"" LOL!
I suppose it could be said that this is a rehashing of ""The African Queen"" but these characters stand out on their own as does the locale and will remain one of my movie library favorites to be viewed over and over and now more enjoyable than ever in the blu-ray format.",1394582400,5,1682,4.554455445544554

54333,5,0783225911,"The banter and one-upsmanship between Mr. Wayne and Ms. Hepburn makes this a movie that can be watched over and over without getting old. The story is excellent for the most part with only a few holes in the plot.
Mr. Wayne's performance is every bit as deep and fleshed-out as was his portrayal of ""Rooster"" Cogburn in _True Grit_ (for which he won an Oscar).
Ms. Hepburn's portrayal of the Bible-quoting, straight-shooting, give-as-good-as-she-gets Eula Goodnight is one of the classics of all time and, in my opinion, should have been nominated for an Oscar.

I think it is easy to tell that these actors were having fun while making this movie. It wasn't just chemistry between the characters, the people seemed to truly enjoy being around each other.

54349,5,0783225911,"This movie was the second to the last that John Wayne made.  Starring ""The Duke"" as he revisits his role as Rooster Cogburn, the famous sheriff from ""True Grit"", and Katharine Hepburn a school teacher and more than a match for ole Rooster.  This fun movie was made in the beautiful outdoors of the west and it is an interesting tale of how Rooster and The Lady try to find and either kill or arrest a bunch of outlaws who killed The lady's father.  The leader of the outlaws is Richard Jordan, who really is a sleezy outlaw and he captures a wagonload of nitroglycerine to blow up a bank.  The conversations between old Rooster and the Lady are really fun to listen to and I smile everytime I watch this movie.
It is ashame that these two legends of film only made this movie together, but at least they did.  It is not one of John Wayne's best movies but it certainly isn't one of his worst either.

This is a real trip down memory lane for all John Wayne fans, all Katharine Hepburn fans (let's not forget this great actress won more Oscars than anybody else in her career) and all fans of light entertainment. It scores in many ways. Wayne and Hepburn, after rubbing each other up the wrong way for the best part of the film and despite the great chasm between them in character, background and ambitions, end up with huge respect and great love (the real love kind) for each other. To me that is the highlight and main point of making the film, but when you add the fantastic scenery and the natural unforced humour along with the huge screen presence of these two great stars, this film becomes highly memorable and to me well worth watching again and again.

ROOSTER COGBURN looked better on the laser-disc version than that DVD which was a shameful release of the film.  Mostly that's why I went ahead and took a chance and bought this all region Blu-Ray from England (although a seller here in the USA-Amazon was offering it), and was so glad I did...that current DVD edition went into the trash faster than the shrink wrap came off the new Blu-Ray.  I'm sure it will be release domestically eventually, but I could not find it on any of the advance release lists through Christmas of 2013, and it was  worth it.

Wayne reprises his Academy-award winning role as Rooster Cogburn in ""True Grit"" and there are elements in Hepburn's character of her role opposite Bogie in African Queen. It's pretty much a formula Western except for the dialogue, which is generally free of cliches and is exceptionally witty. The highlights of this film are the scenes in which Wayne and Hepburn engage in verbal duals...with Hepburn generally winning. But there is plenty of Western action too and the gun battles won't disappoint classic Western fans...Hepburn even takes a turn or two behind a rifle and a Gatling gun. All in all a very satisfying film with a satisfying ending.

Local people were selling the poop from his horse at $10 a bag - probably more than MJ was going for at the time!

54413,4,0783225911,"First of foremost let me state that there may be some spoilers ahead in this review.  Anyways, to the critique.

Westerns have never been my interest, I have always avoided them like the plague while growing up.  However, when I was introduced to John Wayne in True Grit some years back, I was surprised!  The movie had such a charm to it that made it possible to follow the characters and enjoy their adventure which is no wonder that John Wayne had won an oscar for it.  Learning of it's sequel, I went out to buy both movies to add to my collection.

I was not disappointed by this movie!  I personally felt that it had it's own unique charm just as True Grit did, giving more action sequences and some fun dialogue.  I did have a few issues with the story, however, as I have noticed some unrealisms.  First of all, John Wayne and Katherine Hepburn must retrieve several crates of nitro glycerin along with the lead villian to return back to Fort Smith for a reward.  But do you know how the lead villian (Hawk) is carrying those crates of nitro glycerin?  On a wagon!  Clearly, they did not research how wagons traveled on the Oregon Trail or the old west or they would have known that the terrain caused the wagon to constantly bounce and shift.  Hence why many people walked besides the wagons because the ride was far too rough.  Hauling nitro glycerin on a wagon alone would have been more than disasterous.

But wait, there's more!  Not only would the rough wagon ride cause the nitro glycerin to self destruct, but they also managed to crash the nitro glycerin into a rock face, damaging the tire of the wagon.  After Wayne and Hepburn retrieve the nitro glycerin, they begin sailing down the river with the crates stacked upon a raft.  While on the raft, they eventually hit some rapids, causing their raft to be tossed about, crashing into things, and constantly bobbing up and down.  Did anything happen to the nitro though?  Of course not!  That packaging must have been so well done, the nitro glycerin could withstand even the most tormented of punishments!  To put the icing on the cake, after rocking, slamming, jerking, bouncing, and almost throwing the nitro glycerin, they come to a small part of the river where they nervously and carefully put it into the water.  Glad to see they're finally being careful with it after all this time but what that nitro has been through, they might as well have thrown it into the villians.

Right before they reach the rapids, John Wayne pulls into his trusty kit and produces a gatling gun to fire on the opposing villians.  Glad that we can just keep gatling guns in our pockets to use when an ambush of villians fire on our trusty little raft from atop a cliff now isn't it?  I always thought gatling guns were heavy, lunky, and would probably not be supported by a make shift raft.  But then again The Duke is full of surprises now isn't he?

To top it off, John Wayne eventually shoots the crates of nitro as they flow right next to the villians, thus disposing of them once and for all.  Now, since you've been on the edge of your seat the entire movie just waiting for the nitro to blow up after all it's been through, you finally get your just reward!  I'm surprised he didn't just pull out the gatling gun as it seems that at this point that would be the only method of destructing the nitro.  Hollywood tends to like to push things like this but I felt that this was a little over the top.

So, plot holes and unrealisms of this movie, hence me giving it four stars instead of five.  Don't get me wrong, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I felt the DVD quality was excellent, a good watch and a good buy for John Wayne fans out there! It may have a different flavor than True Grit and take on similarities to another plot as many reviewers already stated, but it's a great movie none the less!  Don't let me discourage you from buying it!",1314144000,,3914,4.435574229691877

54415,3,0783225911,"Rooster Cogburn, 1975 film

A lawman peers into a shack; he has found those who robbed a train and murdered the engineer. Resistance is futile. ""Excessive zeal""? Is the west changing? Can a judge fire a marshal without cause? An Army wagon is directed to a detour. Is this a trap? One survivor observed this. The same judge visits Rooster with a new assignment: bring back the stolen dynamite and the gang leader Hawk alive. ""Maybe you're right."" The gang stops at a mission for the Indians. The Reverend Goodnight advises them to not sell alcohol to the Indians. Eula preaches to the gang in spite of the gunshots from a vicious Hawk. Rooster is trailing Hawk and his nine men. The gang creates trouble, then shoots the minister. The next day Rooster arrives and learns what happened. [The talk seems stilted, the actors seem to enjoy their work.]

The Indian scout Wolf sees the ambush and they prepare a counter-measure. Eula picks up a gun to save Rooster. One of the gang picks a fight with the other. They have trouble with a wagon. Soon Rooster sights them. Can they be caught? No, but the odds improve. Two members of the gang ride into town. Rooster draws a cork; old age or what? Hawk doesn't like bad news; he will return for that wagon. Rooster and Eula talk a lot; this pads out the movie. Hawk and his men arrive, and ask for that wagon. But Rooster outsmarts them. Hawk's gang follows them to the ferry crossing, then ride on to catch them at the narrows. One man has a plan to stop the raft, but it doesn't work out. Hawk and his men lay in wait, but their plan fails again. The raft goes past the rocks. But they see men and horses on the shore. The boxes of nitroglycerine explode on cue. No prisoners now. Eula argues in defense of Rooster before Judge Parker, who rules for Reuben. ""I just made it up."" Five families will homestead at Fort Ruby. Eula gets the last word in again.

This was the next to the last movie for John Wayne. You can notice a shortness of breath in a few scenes. The comic scenes reduce the tension from this serious drama. I suspect the roles matched the aging bodies of the movie stars. Some have compared this to ""The African Queen"" movie. Hollywood knows that a successful movie can be duplicated years later by changes in scenery and plot. There are two problems with this story. Nitroglycerine is highly explosive so its transport in a horse drawn wagon along rough roads is not possible. Nitro was used to blow open a safe during a burglary, not needed for an armed robbery (fresh, fast horses for a getaway was more important). A Gatling gun is not useful for any bank robbery, its too heavy and cumbersome. That is why General Custer refused to take a Gatling gun on his fast-moving trip to the Little Big Horn river. Was this plot used to show the poor judgment of Hawk and his gang.",1303948800,,2837,4.4414587332053745

54434,5,0783225911,"Sheriff Reuben Cogburn got the epithet ""Rooster"" as a result of his swaggering disposition. So effective has he been in nailing outlaws that an ""enlightened"" judge from the east, ignorant of the realities of the Wild West, took away his badge, for a time, for ""being too successful"".

Rooster Cogburn has to contend not only with outlaws and the judge, but also with the super-religious Eula Goodnight (Katherine Hepburn), who shows her mettle by going along with him for the chase against outlaw Hawk. Eula's father had been murdered by Hawk. An Indian boy who survived the massacre, Wolf, who wants to grow up to be a sheriff himself, also comes along.

The movie is full of dramatic scenes. Wolf falls asleep at his sentry post, and is kidnapped by the outlaws. So Cogburn's original ""posse of three"" is surrounded by the band of outlaws. At one point, the ""posse of three"" is traveling slowly down a stream---a sitting duck for the outlaws in wait behind the rocks above. Cogburn uses a primitive machine gun (a Gatling gun) very effectively on a number of occasions. But the raft with the ""posse of three"" runs into a series of dangerous rapids, and that with boxes of nitroglycerin on board. The Gatling gun falls and sinks the bottom of the river. And so it goes...

The chemistry between John Wayne and Katherine Hepburn is unmistakable and enough to melt any icy demeanor and any detractor of 'The Duke's'. Katherine Hepburn, a staunch liberal and Wayne, a staunch conservative was also probably enough to bring everyone and their mother to see this movie when it premiered, as it would likely make even the deceased curious. I've seen it several times and probably will watch it yet again.

Hollywood often butchers great films and great ideas by trying to milk a sequel, and this is clearly evinced with the old-school attempt with the tomfoolery concerning the script, so this film might go down as the best film from probably the most unoriginal script, mainly due to the chemistry, the believability, and yes ... the acting.",1203379200,5,1271,5.479591836734694

54468,4,0783225911,"Sometimes a multitude of wrongs can come out right.  Hollywood has a penchant for making sequels to successful films, so when John Wayne finally won an Oscar for his performance in ""True Grit.""  Wayne played Rooster Cogburn, a fearless, one-eyed U.S. marshal who never knew a dry day in his life.  Fortunately Hollywood waited six years before making this 1975 sequel.  However, at that point they not only hired a novice screenwriter, actress Martha Hyer (""First Men in the Moon""), they let her rip off ""The African Queen"" and turn it into a western.  Fortunately, they hired Katharine Hepburn to play opposite the Duke.
That is what ""Rooster Cogburn"" comes down to, the chance for John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn to do scenes together; it also explains why the film is also known as ""Rooster Cogburn and the Lady.""  Hepburn plays Rose Sayer, no, wait, I mean Eula Goodnight, who is the daughter of a minister (Jon Lormer) instead of the brother of a missionary.  The gospel is still being brought to the natives, except this time we are set in the Cascades of Oregon rather than the jungles of Africa.  The bad guys are now a gang of thieves led by Breed (Anthony Zerbe) and Hawk (Richard Jordan), instead of Nazis, and this time they gun down the minister.  So when Rooster comes along to track them down and bring them to his brand of justice, Eula insists on going along.
The plot is predictable in terms of the outcome and familiar when Kate and the Duke end up on the water.  But there is fun to be had in these two standing toe to toe, but not jaw to jaw, and going at it.  ""To whom do you think you are speaking,"" she intones frostily.  ""You is to whom I think I am speaking, sister,"" he shoots back.  She allows that he is bigger than she is, but only physically.  He observes in this situation that should be enough and they continue to have great fun with the dialogue.  Wayne has great fun hamming it up and Hepburn enjoys having an actor big enough to stand up to her assault.
The stories from the set were that the two great stars had great fun making this movie.  Their politics were at opposite ends of the spectrum so they just avoid the topics and enjoyed being in each other's company. Wayne was playing a character he had done before in a movie, but then Hepburn's character is instantly recognizable as well, even if the name is different.  The names do not matter.  They can call them ""Rooster Cogburn and the Lady,"" but it is the Duke and Kate, and their fans will not be disappointed by their time together.",1088812800,55,2533,4.469565217391304

Good, believable action too. I'm sorry but I feel I should point out an inconsistency or two with True Grit. Judge Parker is played by a different man here and his court room is small and doesn't call to mind the giant court room he had in the first film. Also, Chin Lee is  a different guy here too.

54472,4,0783225911,"I actually prefer this movie to the first appearance of Wayne as Cogburn, ""True Grit,"" even though he got the Oscar for that while this one seems to have sunk with hardly a critical trace.  A sort of Western remake of ""The African Queen"" (complete with Katie Hepburn as a strait-laced spinster), with murderous outlaws taking the place of the Nazis, it finds Rooster unwillingly joining up with missionary's daughter Eula Goodnight (""Sister,"" as he calls her) to catch her father's murderers, who happen to be the same gang of ordnance-hijackers he was sent out from Fort Smith to apprehend.  Though played much more for laughs than its predecessor (here, as in ""McLintock"" and ""Donovan's Reef,"" Wayne clearly displays an unmistakeable gift for comedy), it's not without either headlong action, taut suspense, or sexual tension.  Admittedly I'm not sure there are any river gorges like these in the *real* (former) Indian Territory, but who cares when the scenery is so breathtaking?  And there's a definite advantage to starting a script from scratch rather than trying to translate Charles Portis's probably-authentic but somehow not-quite-flavorful-enough dialogue to film.

54473,5,0783225911,"Wayne is ruthlessly overlooked for this one, a heartache similar to the fate of The Big Lebowski. Its one of those sad mysteries of life; one of the truly great, last, and forgotten westerns. If you read enough Leonard Maltlin, you really start to wonder if he was raised by Quakers. Rooster Cogburn is a fast-paced actioner with accessible, beautifully embellished characters. Its not best picture material the way The Outlaw Josey Wales couldn't have been---not enough ""morality"" spoon-fed in even bites.
Hearing Wayne say,(in an overlooked line by most, I'll bet)""Don't worry son, they'll pay for it,"" brings tears to my eyes. It throws me back to my childhood memory of what Wayne represented: There's good guys out there you just don't want to mess with. Wayne fuses all his elements to create this masculine, wise, clever, experienced, tenacious, hard dinking, yet respected federal lawman like none ever seen. This time he's got a real director to back him up.
There are incredible lines, as funny as they are character-building:
SCENE:
(Wayne and Hepburn, recently stealing their supplies, are surrounded at night by Jordan, Zerbe and the rest of the bad guys/murderous white trash.)
Richard Jordan, as HAWK:(YELLING) ""You may have the gatlin' gun, but you ain't got the know-how to use it!""
Wayne: (to Hepburn) ""Deputy,... show-em'""
 (Hepburn cranks the gatlin-gun, scattering their startled enemies in the dark, causing destruction. stops.)
Wayne: (with a fierce grin, hilariously sarcastic, yelling)

54474,5,0783225911,"John Wayne shines once again as Rooster Cogburn but Katherine Hepburn provides the polish.
This movie is often refered to as John Wayne meets the African Queen.  I disagree.  The interaction between Wayne & Hepburn is the foundation of the movie, but I think the chemistry and clash between Hawk & Breed (Richard Jordan & Anthony Zerbe)is almost as interesting.  Jordan & Zerbe are two character actors who are often overlooked.
I liked the character of Hawk.  I always thought He would make an  adult version of him would make a good character in a western series if they ever came back.  Strother Martin is a pleasure (as always) in a bit role as well.
Hepburn & Wayne work well together, Hepburn is a different type of foil than O'Hara, of course the relative ages of the characters and the actors call for a more verbial and less sexual  tension.  Of course if it was O'Hara then she would have shot her father's killer herself.
