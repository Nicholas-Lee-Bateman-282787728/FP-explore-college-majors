2472362,5,B000CS6SP6,"These are all from Art Linkletter's House Party show. The kids are cute and original. They are not rehearsed and the humor showes.

 These 40 year old shows are hilarous and timeless. If you want to just laugh and enjoy the way children think, this is for you. This is one for the kids and adults...but the adults will enjoy this humor and laugh out loud a lot

2472363,1,B000CS6SP6,"Since this is called ""the best of"" I thought they would take the funniest clips from various shows and expected to be laughing througout the dvd.

8101530,5,B000CS6SP6,"Art Linkletter is the best there is with kids. These were hilarious when we saw them on television way back, and they are just as funny now - maybe more so as we compare the innocence of kids back then to what exists these days.",1517616000,,228,4.088888888888889

8101539,5,B000CS6SP6,"I grew up watching this on TV and loved it.  It can be a bit off-putting to your feminist side, but the series, like any series of this era, is very sexist.  But those were the times.  I think a series of this type would still do well today because kids really do, say the darndest things.  You can probably watch some clips of it on YouTube.",1392681600,,342,4.059701492537314
