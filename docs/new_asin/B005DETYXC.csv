8466766,5,B005DETYXC,"Candlelight by Night is the story of Clermont County, Ohio's involvement on the Underground Railroad.  The information is wonderful and it features 2 Clermont County Historians(Rick Crawford and Gary Knepp) as well as 2 from the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center (Carl Westmooreland and Richard Cooper).  There are wonderful visuals as well as great stories that you probably haven't heard before.  I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone interested in the Underground Railroad even if they aren't from Clermont County.",1352160000,,534,5.567901234567901
