3978876,5,B002SAMMQK,The usual fast fun delivered in an informative way. They tell you the good the bad and the ugly of cars with no mercy.  You always end up waiting for more.,1272153600,,155,4.0
3978877,5,B002SAMMQK,"Top Gear is the best show on TV. These episodes have more footage than you saw on TV and even more than the ""director's cuts"" that show up on my on demand listings. I laugh until hurt whenever I watch these.",1269648000,,207,4.073170731707317

This goes for ALL the Top Gear DVDs.",1268611200,,489,4.268817204301075
3978879,5,B002SAMMQK,This has to be the best way to watch Top Gear! Has the play all feature which is a must for TV series on DVD. The shows are so smooth compared to how they are on TV.,1266192000,,165,3.4864864864864864
3978880,4,B002SAMMQK,"Yes, the mad men of Top Gear are back again- engaging in the insanity that the world of car lovers (and British comedy lovers) have joined in for years. This set contains the full Season 12 of the show (fall/winter 2008)... or does it?

Although the cuts generally aren't as bad as they were in Season 10's DVD release, they are there. As with the Season 11 set, Top Gear Stuntman is totally absent. Fortunately, other cuts are apparently quite minor- with every episode retaining both its News and Star in a Reasonably Priced Car segment.

The box advertises numerous extras... but don't be fooled. Half of the extras are confined to the Director's Cut of the Botswana Special (re-released here after its prior Season 10 set printing). The other extras are scattered- I didn't find the extended Boris Johnson interview or uncut Cool Wall on disc 2 until the second viewing, for instance. Take out Botswana (which was Season 10, not 12), and the extras are rather meager... although, it must be admitted, ANY extras are more extras than the BBC has put on the other Top Gear American releases.

The best bit of this set, of course, is the massive Episode 8- the Vietnam special. Unfortunately, one of the minor annoyances of the set as a whole cripples a major portion of the humor in that episode- specifically, the alteration of music from broadcast version to DVD version. The BBC have, apparently, decided to cheap out on getting clearances for the music used in the show, with the result that a LOT of the music you heard on the televised version has been replaced by public-domain and/or BBC Archive music tracks.

This results (I apologize for any spoilers, but if you're looking at this you've almost certainly seen the show anyway) is that the Bruce Springsteen bike (a Stars and Stripes bedecked motorcycle used as a punishment threat, should our heroes break down during the Vietnam trip) no longer has ""Born in the USA"" blaring from its iPod. It's been dubbed over with the Star Spangled Banner. This required one series of jokes to be cut entirely (so the ep, though a little longer than broadcast on BBC America, is NOT uncut) and other jokes, including the one immediately in response to the first playing of the music, to make absolutely no sense whatever.

This minor maiming of the Vietnam special wipes out any extra bonus points that the Director's Cut of the Botswana Special might have won the set. The same problems that bedeviled the Season 10 release- not uncut, annoying auto-play trailers, and no skip points within each individual film- also infest this release. There are also incidents of misspelled or mistranscribed words in the subtitles- and even at least one misspelling in the scene-selection menus. (The name is TESLA, not TELSA. And no, it's not a town in Oklahoma, that's TULSA.)

Don't get me wrong. You WILL love this. If, like me, your only dose of Top Gear usually comes from the extremely edited BBC America broadcasts, you'll discover all sorts of little extra bits you've never seen before in this set. You'll want to laugh again and again at the crazies driving anything from Vespas to muscle cars to the near-worshipped Bugatti Veyron. You'll see the definitive test of what kind of buses should be used in London... a race on an oval that's just one step above demolition derby. You'll see a Ford Fiesta chased by a sports car through a shopping mall.

And through it all, you'll see three car nuts bickering at each other, mocking the failures of the auto industry, and sharing a deep love of cars and the use thereof.

But it's not a perfect release, and so I can't give it a perfect score. Sorry, BBC- try again, and next time don't pinch the penny so hard.

(Note: Edited when I found some more extras on a second viewing of the set. Makes it a little better, but still not five stars.",1263772800,53,3838,4.682492581602374

Kind of a cold war review & rally with a surprise near the end of this segment. Hint, it involves fire and a car.  But, the real treat is when Jeremy conducts an almost ridiculously thorough road test.  The car is a Ford Fiesta and is in response to a letter request from a Mr. Needham.  The amount of condescension to Mr. Needham is very humorous.  My habit is not to reveal details, but to give you an overview to watch.

3979817,4,B002SAMMQK,"The Vietnam Special is one of the best Top Gear episodes of the series. I'd give it 5 stars, but for some reason, the Amazon version has swapped out some of the music. Instead of playing, ""Born in the USA"" whenever they show the American bike, they substitute the Star Spangled Banner. This makes it kind of confusing later on when the trio starts joking about ""hearing Bruce Springsteen"" coming up behind them.

Having said that, this series contains one of my all time favo(u)rite episodes - the Vietnam special.  A 90 minute special featuring a trip through Vietnam with our hosts up to their usual pranks, with corresponding hilarious consequences.

Year after Year this show is one of my favo(u)rites.  They manage to mix entertainment with a car show - so much so that my wife will actually watch it with me.  They've tried a US version and although it isn't bad, the US hosts don't have the sarcasm, wit and bond that the 3 presenters in the UK have.

Season 12 was perhaps one of my favorite and their trips to America and Vietnam were completely wonderful.

The best bits aren't the reviews of the ridiculously expensive supercars, but rather the reality show type challenges where the hosts goof off and have amazing adventure worldwide.  Even my mom, hardly a gearhead, appreciates the humor when they hit the road.

Now season 12 is probably the best season of Top Gear and certainly my favorite.  Their trip to California and the Salt Flats with American cars is beautiful and hilarious.  Their trip to Vietnam is amazing and absolutely gorgeous.  The first episode where they attempt truck driving is hilarious and ridiculous.  They have a gas mileage challenge, a Ferrari vs. powerboat race, and a Fiesta does a beach landing with Royal Marines.

Similarly, I have no idea what half the Britjokes they make actually mean, but I consider it cultural research. I'm a supporter of this show and can't see myself ever enjoying the Americanized version.

Probably would have given it a 3 if the Vietnam Special wasn't in there, that was fabulous! The extras are fairly useless as the Botswana special is in a previous season. The guys, as usual, are fairly hilarious, even if a bit obvious sometimes. The lorry (semi truck) competitions were just hysterical. I laughed my a#$ off. I always love the stars in the reasonably priced cars & interviews with them. I always wonder how the American celebrities cope with the car laps because personal experience tells me shifting with your left hand & steering with your right does not come natural to us.

8379218,5,B002SAMMQK,This is one of the best series with the most memorable episodes!  The first episode where Jeremy ends up setting his lorry on fire to the last episode where Hammond is going around in circles on his amphibious motorbike in Vietnam cursing the hell out of it!  The Vietnam was one of the best and most memorable ones and was one of the first shows I watched before becoming an avid Top Gear watcher.,1514419200,,398,4.364864864864865

8379220,5,B002SAMMQK,"What can be said about Top Gear UK which hasn't already?  The most popular television program (brief pause) IN THE WORLD got to that peak through a mind-boggling combination of contrived stunts, adolescent behavior, willful disregard for anything politically correct, and an unabashed ambivalence toward anything or anybody they managed to offend in the process...and yet with all of that, an uncanny ability to tug at the heart strings where needed and to go beyond politics to show all the people of the world just how much remarkable beauty this planet has shared with us.

It's no secret that nearly all of the show's often hilarious scenarios are scripted, and as you get toward the latter seasons there wasn't even a half-handed effort to hide that fact.  Many of the ""shocking"" results Top Gear found via real-world testing were likewise rigged, as Elon Musk would be only too happy to tell you.  But in the end it just doesn't matter: this is not a tv show about cars, but rather a show about 3 middle-aged men who love cars and just happen to have lucked into a paying gig which allows them to drive whatever they want, wherever they want, however they want.  Yet in the midst of all the (often self-effacing) humor, there always seems to be a poignant moment or two included to give Clarkson, Hammond and May the opportunity to showcase their more sincere sides: be it Hammond communicating via a stick and sand with an unnamed local man in Vietnam and learning that he'd lost his hearing during a B-52 raid in the war, the boys bonding with a group of young men high in the isolated Himalayas of India over a game of straight-six cricket, or Clarkson soberly explaining that he'd chosen a V8 Porsche 928 to carry him across Patagonia because it was one of those which had long ago enabled him to make the dash across England in time to be at his father's bedside as he passed on.  A few of the jokes might be lost on those who don't hail from the British Isles, a few others will be badly dated, but it just doesn't matter in the end as you see these three bonding and sharing their rather unique view of the world through this silly show.

In a world filled with far too much junk food in the ""reality"" television arena, this is the filet mignon.  Served with a side of Spam.",1509235200,5,2287,4.520581113801453
