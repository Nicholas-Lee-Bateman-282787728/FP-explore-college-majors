7826984,3,6302505984,"This is the K. Gordon Murray version of the East German import
that he released in his ""Children's Matinees"" venue in 1965.  As Murray product goes, this is one of the best in that it has
good production value and is fairly amusing.  The dubbed track
is played for laughs.  It's not as surreal or schlocky as his Mexican imports like ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and ""Puss N' Boots"".
I will admit that I enjoyed this tape primarily for the nostalgia
of seeing the film in the sixties as a child.  For contemporary
audiences, they may find the cheap soundtrack a bit disorienting
since there are no background sounds and many effects are missing.  Basically, you have the dubbed dialogue and some songs.
Otherwise the track is empty compared to modern dolby stereo movies where every footstep and location ambience is contained in the mix.  Then again, the Sword and Sandal imports had similar track problems.
The source material appears to be an old 16mm print.  The color is acceptable and not too faded for Eastmancolor. It doesn't have the sharpness of a 35mm print but is watchable.  There are some splices and scratches.
If you want to see the image in mint condition, purchase the ""Tales of Europe"" DVD of this title.  It has a different
English soundtrack but looks sensational and as a bonus contains the original German language version.",1074988800,,1342,4.75
