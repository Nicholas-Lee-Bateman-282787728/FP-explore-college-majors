7869443,5,6304398271,This movie is the bomb!!! Yancy Butler was excellent in this film playing a seductive woman who would stop at nothing to get back with her ex husband even if that means she'd have to kill those that get in her way. Infact this is the kind of movie that I haven't seen in a long time since I  use to have cable tv however I'm so very glad to own this movie on VHS to watch.,1526169600,,372,3.831168831168831
7869444,5,6304398271,"This is one of those low-budget, made-in-Canada movies that surprisingly turns out to be a nice little gem! The source material seems to be ""Fatal Attraction,"" but this film stands on its own, mostly thanks to an outstanding and outrageous Yancy Butler! A top-notch sleeper worth checking out!",1516147200,,293,5.125

7869447,5,6304398271,The is one great movie by Yancy Butler. In this movie she's out to reclaim her ex-husband or make his life a pure hell. This movie makes Fatal Attraction look like a children's bedtime story.,1294099200,,191,4.485714285714286
7869448,4,6304398271,"This is an excellent movie. Don't compare it with other thriller's, and don't compare it with the book, just watch it and enjoy. I really enjoyed the evil villain role played by Yancy butler in this made for TV thriller. Deirdre (Yancy Butler) is a beautiful psychotic woman who attempts to get her ex husband David (Nick Mancuso) back. When he tells her he's married and rejects her advances. Deirdre befriends his new sweet and innocent wife Molly (Suzy Amis)by posing as a psychiatrist, and is secretly hired by Molly to treat their son Michael. Molly share's her own problems with Deirdre who, becomes outranged when she learns from Molly that David never told her that he was divorced. Deirdre becomes hell bent on destroying David and his family, and won't stop at nothing not even murder.",1097971200,3,795,4.810218978102189
7869449,3,6304398271,"This thriller is indeed extremely thrilling and very suspenseful. To say the least, it is very clichd, but it does not take away from the extreme chills I got when watching this. Yancy Butler does an amazing job as the psycho Diedre, and I liked Suzy Amis in her sweet and innocent role. The scene where Diedre is lifting weights and Molly and David see her is very scary and got me very excited. The only thing I have to complain about is the fact that this film has too much sexual topic, and the lesbian doctor thing is quite annoying. Diedre seems obsessed with the idea! Overall, I'd say its worth three, maybe three and , but I wouldn't give it five. Suspense is good, Butler's performance is over-the-top and viciously excellent, but the sexual content for some reason bugs me in this movie.",1064966400,2,798,4.510344827586207
7869450,1,6304398271,"An abyssmal waste of time. The formulaic story revolves around the efforts of Deidre Kenyon (Yancy Butler) to stalk and destroy the family of her ex-husband, David (Nick Mancuso). Predictable plot and banal dialog aside, the movie suffers most badly from a complete lack of interesting --let alone likeable -- characters. Admittedly, Yancy Butler and Nick Mancuso do what they can to salvage this mess, but with a lame script and uninspired direction, their efforts are all in vain. Deidre is no Norman Bates; she is not so much frightening as simply overbearing. David is such a louse that the viewer can be forgiven for volunteering to take some of the workload off of Deidre. The character of standard-issue victim Molly Kenyon is so cloying that it seems almost a pity that she isn't bumped off early in the movie whereas five year-old Michael Kenyon needs his on-screen shrink much less than he does a swift kick in the slats.
In the end, the pseudo-psychology of ""The Ex"" simply doesn't work. The creators of ""The Ex"" don't appear to understand the difference between the psychotic and the psychopath. As a result, the film winds up being an uninteresting and uncovincing bore. Don't waste your time with it.",995846400,3,1214,4.869565217391305
7869451,3,6304398271,"THe EX, based on a novel by John Lutz, revolves around a man played by Nick Mancuso, who is being stalked by his ex-wife, Deirdre, played by Yancy Butler. Of course, Mancuso cannot tell his current wife about his torrid past with Deirdre, but as Deirdre ingratiate herself to his wife and son, he finally put his foot down and told her to get out of his life. This made Dierdre ever the more determine to ruin him. And murder is just a mere inconvenience to her. Drowning men in bath tubs seems to be a routine activity for her.
""The Ex"" is not exactly a huge budget suspense movie, but Yancy Butler is riveting in her gleefully wicked performance as Diedre. The rest of the cast is adequate, especially Nick Mancuso. Overall, this a movie you rent, not buy.",972691200,2,758,4.421428571428572
7869452,4,6304398271,"Two words neatly sum up why this silly FATAL ATTRACTION/BASIC INSTINCT rip-off is better than the just-as-silly films it imitates: Yancy Butler. Glenn Close and Sharon Stone are simply no match for the intense level of comic ferocity Yancy generates with her truly terrific performance in THE EX -- she's the femme fatale to end all femme fatales. It's not just that she's pure evil, she's pure evil and she's lovin' it! She's exuberantly sexy and sinister and a lot of fun to watch. Which is a good thing, because other than the consciously (I think) campy script, she's the only thing this indifferently directed film has going for it. And since she's the only character with any life in her, you end up rooting for her to win, and are bitterly disappointed when she doesn't.",969321600,6,777,4.720588235294118
