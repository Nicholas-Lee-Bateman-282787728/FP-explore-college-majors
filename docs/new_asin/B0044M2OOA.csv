8416122,5,B0044M2OOA,"ALPHA VIDEO is a provider of vintage programming that's often unavailable elsewhere. Alpha's prices are fair, but so is transfer quality of some of their offerings. None have undergone restoration, yet the relative obscurity of their titles, plus a reasonable cost make these a worthwhile purchase.

The screen career of cinema's original cowboy star, William S. Hart began with his portrayal of Messala in a 1907 short version of BEN HUR. Reginald Barker's THE BARGAIN, Hart's first feature-length photoplay, is scripted in part by Thomas Ince, who died tragically in 1924 after a visit to W.R. Hearst's yacht. There's speculation to this day whether Ince succumbed to severe indigestion or was victim of a stray Hearst bullet meant for Charlie Chaplin.

In ""The Bargain,"" Hart is 'Two-Gun' Jim Stokes, a wounded stagecoach robber who recovers at the shack of prospector Phil Brent (Sherry), where he meets and falls in love with Brent's daughter. After marrying Nell (Williams), Jim's attempt to reform by returning the express company's cash fails when he's apprehended by Sheriff Walsh (Burke) and held in a room above the town's colorful saloon. The sheriff goes downstairs, hits the roulette wheel and gambles away Jim's returned loot. He then strikes an unusual bargain with the former outlaw: if Jim steals back the express company's money he and Nell will be permitted to escape to Mexico.

8416124,4,B0044M2OOA,"This had an unusual if not unique intro or ""Title sequence"" to the movie  which attempts to bridge the gap between a stage play and a movie. so it sort of puts your mind into the mindset of the time of the movies production in 1914.
  Then there's the movie. The cinematography is definitely below par. Well better finished quality does exist in 1914, though I've seen worse. The musical score was good and fit the movie as it went, whereas some other silent reproductions are lazy and use the same music over and over again or don't even use period music at all.
  The story seems typical, though With Hart playing the bad guy, you just don't know what to expect.  ""The Bargain"" takes a while to present itself and when you think you've figured out what it will be you are totally wrong...not even in the ballpark! It's really amazing how so often these old movies just don't follow any sort of formula...you just never seem to know where they are going so the whole movie is new to you. The Hart movies seem to be best at giving unpredictable storylines.
  I quite enjoyed the movie and for the period it's top notch, though he and production gets worlds better by 1915. Only the lower quality of the footage brings this down to a 4 star...and even at that it's about normal for the period.",1354147200,2,1292,4.421940928270042
