5130520,3,B0084DVU7M,"I actually took my time reviewing National Park videos on Amazon and chose this one because it covered all 58 parks. I was particularly interested because I take a vacation every year that incorporates a National Park. I guess the compromise in getting all 58 parks in one collection is that there is only 5-8 minutes of coverage for each one. The first video I watched was on the Everglades since I will be visiting in 2014, and had done a lot of pre-planning research. I was definitely disappointed in the Everglades segment as it was short and I knew more about the park from my research than was told in the video. I was surprised a bit because the Everglades is a large park and one easily accessible to a large population so I was expecting a little more. The video did spend more time on parks like Yellowstone, but overall I found myself disappointed. I guess I would rather have more time at fewer parks than abbreviated coverage of all.",1391817600,13,946,4.505813953488372
5130521,5,B0084DVU7M,"The ""America's 58 National Parks"" collection of dvds are fun to watch, and full of useful information. For me, the scenery was the best part of the series.",1391817600,9,155,4.571428571428571
5130522,3,B0084DVU7M,"Overall, the quality is good, dialogue well-delivered and helpful,  BUT, this NOT all the national parks!  It does not include the Gulf Islands National Seashore (near Pensacola FL on the Gulf of Mexico), which is the specific one I was led to believe would be included. Maybe this 3-disc set covers 58 out of 59, but it's definitely not all.  It's probably most of 'em or it's all of the biggies and if that's okay with your expectations for this dvd set, go for it/buy it.  It's a fine overall sampler of what's available in national parks; just don't believe that it is every last one.",1382054400,,588,4.518867924528302
5130523,4,B0084DVU7M,"I watched all six plus hours with interest. I have been in 44 National Parks and am a avid hiker. The photography is excellent. Sometimes as with Brook Falls in Alaska with the bears catching salmon while standing on a waterfall breathtaking. Now and then a history lesson with sepia tones and short reenactments shows up. Not a good thing. But 95% of the content is visually stunning with great narration. I know of no other video that features all 58 national parks. The Alaska, Grand Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone portions are almost perfect. The material on the seldom seen parks like Biscayne, Dry Tortugas et al is very good. Overall an excellent effort.",1358208000,36,663,4.824561403508772
5130524,1,B0084DVU7M,"This product's packaging title (ALL 58 PARKS IN HD) is, in my opinion, misleading to purchasers as being a high definition product.  The three discs are standard DVD's which means they are not of the high definition television system known as Blu-ray.  The manufacturer defends this as being material that was shot in HD (high definition) though not released on high definition (Blu-ray) discs but rather on standard DVD discs.

My understanding is that the DVD disc conforms to the original NTSC television system and  is, therefore, not of the High Definition disc system known as Blu-ray.  Customers should be aware of this before purchasing.",1452038400,12,645,5.104761904761904

The quality of the filming and the colours are exceptional, and for those parks which we have not visited, there is no longer a need.

8525045,2,B0084DVU7M,"While informative, the video we've watched so far seems ""old"".  You get snippets of information about the park but not a lot of it.  We've been spoiled on the Ken Burns type documentaries and guess that's what we thought we'd get.  Sorry, but I wouldn't buy this if I knew then what I know now.",1506384000,,294,4.3090909090909095
