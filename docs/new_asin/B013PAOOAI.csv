8728415,4,B013PAOOAI,I like Toby but agree with another writer that more breaking down of the chords would be helpful. The dvd He did with happy traum  take a solo was so great! Happy has a real gift for asking the very questions that are swimming around in my head as I watch. I really love that Dvd and I have bought all of Toby Walkers and have been able to extract stuff that has been useful.but the format of Toby and Happy is Great !,1460937600,,418,3.9761904761904763
8728416,3,B013PAOOAI,"Firstly, I own  a large collection of Home Spun DVDs and find most of them to be great - this product unfortunately does make the cut.

Toby Walker is an extremely talented guitarist and his teaching style is friendly; however, this product's description is misleading: ""This DVD will be a boon to guitarists at all levels..."" This DVD is for intermediate and advanced players, not for beginners. To exacerbate the difficulty for beginners, Mr. Walker assumes the viewer knows more advanced chords throughout the fretboard. I know many intermediate players that do not possess the knowledge that Mr. Walker assumes the viewer has.

This DVD would improve greatly if Happy Traum and Mr. Walker took a few minutes to explain the ""Why"" certain more advanced chords are used with the finger exercises/licks; for example, why use an A6 or an A add9 and not a regular A major chord?",1442361600,3,876,4.865771812080537
