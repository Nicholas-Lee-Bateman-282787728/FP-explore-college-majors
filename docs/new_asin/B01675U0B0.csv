8735718,5,B01675U0B0,"Super introductory workout and advanced beginner aerobics for those of us using wheelchairs. Some DVD players will need you to select a region in order to make the video work, or you can watch it on Amazon Prime Video. Using this daily has dramatically improved my strength and conditioning and prepared me to be strong enough to change from a powered wheelchair to a manual one, do more ADL on my own, and activate my body to the best I am able. Kris is wonderfully encouraging and has thoughtfully gathered a wide range of folks with differing abilities, so we can seek someone similar to our own abilities and also seek to stretch ourselves.",1524096000,,644,4.657894736842105
