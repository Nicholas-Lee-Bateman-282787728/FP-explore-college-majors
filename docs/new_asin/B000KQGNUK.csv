8158705,4,B000KQGNUK,"Yoga on Demand offers two very nice practices appropriate for those with some prior yoga experience.  Instructor Erin Pillman leads a single background exerciser through a slow-flowing series of poses, with a strong emphasis on breath and longer holds of the postures.  The main DVD menu offers the following options:

Introduction [Erin providing a brief overview of the video]
30 Minutes Yoga Practice
Complete Yoga Practice [52 minutes]
Bonus Yoga Poses [5 minutes; additional instruction for five more advanced poses:  crow, headstand, side crow, full pigeon, and wheel]
Testimonials [commentary by yoga students]

The 30 Minutes Practice begins with 4 minutes of breathing and centering and then moves into a slow lunge salutation series.  Next, Erin does a long hold of tree pose (about 6 breaths per side) before moving to a seated position, where she performs cow pose, first with a twist, then with the full arm posture.  A reclined series follows, with plow pose, knee-to-ears posture, shoulderstand, and fish pose.  The final posture is boat performed with breath of fire (little instruction is given).  There is a 2 1/2 minute savasana and then 3 1/2 minutes of seated breathing with a final OM-Shanti-Shanti to end the practice.

The full practice begins seated with a pranayama exercise alternate nostril breathing.  Here Erin performs two slow lunge salutation series, adding lizard pose (lunge with forearms on the floor to stretch the hip flexor) to the first series and warrior 1, warrior 2, wide angle forward bend, and pyramid pose to the second series.  This segment concludes with 3-legged down dog.  As with the shorter practice, Erin again does a long hold of tree poses, this time holding the posture for about 12 breaths per side, and she finishes the standing postures with a side stretch.  Moving to the floor, Erin performs plow, knees-to-ears posture, and shoulder stand, and then additional reclined postures include a cross leg twist and thread the needle.  After rocking/circling the knees, Erin comes to a seated position for a forward bend in cobbler's pose and then a full seated forward bend.  She then performs some brief abs work with a bicycle move before coming into a long savasana.  The approximately 8-minute relaxation segment includes singing, which I presume is performed by Erin herself; I found her voice very soothing and relaxing.  She concludes the practice with a 2-minute seated meditation and a final OM.

I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD.  Both practices are very well-done, and I enjoyed the slower pace.  On the other hand, I also liked the challenge of the longer holds and the inverted postures, both of which I think make this DVD a bit beyond the true beginner level.  Furthermore, Erin does not provide detailed information on form, so prior yoga experience is really a must.  That being said, I think most yogis who are at an advanced beginner to intermediate level would enjoy these practices.",1177891200,8,2964,5.065979381443299
