3520207,5,B001CUB87G,"IF you've ever wanted to see a comprehensive, in-depth re-examination of the infamous ""Chappaquiddick incident"" then this DVD's for you! To those unfamiliar, 1969 saw Ted Kennedy as a shoe-in for the next U.S. Presidency, following his slain brothers tragically cut short physical and political lives. With the American public firmly behind him, in addition to the energy and commitment of former Kennedy campaign supporters, it was almost a given that Ted Kennedy would pick up where his brothers left off and not without justification. He had a gift for public speaking, political savvy and appeared to carry, for many, not only his brothers compassion for social justice, but the aura of ""camelot"" that permeated around the Kennedys. This all changed, altering the course of history, at a little bridge on the small island of Chappaquiddick (off Martha's Vinyard) somewhere between 11.30p.m. and 1am on the muggy moonlit night of Friday, July 18th 1969. Where Ted Kennedy's car carreened off dyke bridge and plunged into a tidal pond. In the official version of events we're told Kennedy was behind the wheel and riding with him was Mary jo Kopechne, only ten days away from her 29th birthday. Mary jo Kopechne drowned in the accident, but somehow Kennedy escaped the upturned submerged car in the pitch black night with his life, unable to actually recall how. That official report has been debated and disbelieved to this day. At its very least it's controversial. For one thing Kennedy's explanation of why it took him 9 hours to report the accident never added up with his movements and the eye witness accounts of those around him that night and following morning (The car, with Miss Kopechne's body in it, having already been discovered by fishermen by then).
In true Bill Kurtis fashion no stone is left unturned, with his dramatic but convincing voice-over he navigates us through that night and it's aftermath, tracking down virtually everyone who was there (except of course Kennedy and his lawyer Cousins Gargan and Markhem).  This impeccably researched documentary leaves the viewer , I think, a most convincing explanation, to date, on the events of that night and while still in the realm of speculation, much more plausible than Kennedy's statement on what happened.
Prior to his recent death some have wondered what haunted Ted Kennedy's life more? Was it the murder of his brothers? His nephew (John,John's) sudden death in a small aircraft(Ironically just off the coast of Chappaquiddick island, almost 30 years to the day-to which Ted was to identify the recovered remains of), or the accidental death of a young woman that he would take responsibility for, whose parents he would make the call,the following day, to inform. If you have a fascination for the Kennedy's very public life, like I do, and modern history for that matter, this a rich look at another event that falls toward the ""tragic"" side of their legacy.

8289673,5,B001CUB87G,"This documentary offers a clear and concise step by step outline of the Chappaquiddick incident which cost a young woman her life and demonstrates the lengths which power and privilege will go to in order to try and evade the full measure of their actions. No ordinary citizen could have acted in such an evasive and uncooperative manner without inviting severe penalties.

In some ways the young Edward Kennedy did avoid the fullest measure of the law for his culpability, but the last hope of that generation for another Kennedy in the White House died alongside Mary Joe Kopechne in the waters around Chappaquiddick. Perhaps then and in the end some measure of justice did prevail, if only to deny him his presumed dynastic inheritance. Based in large part upon a BBC commissioned investigative report, this American version follows the line of that first documentary pretty much all the way, so no new material. The British and American documentaries were both made by the same British production company, the only difference is the voice over being American (U.S. version) and English (British version) To my knowledge the BBC version is no longer available.

Nevertheless this is a fascinating twists and turns tale that pulls few if any punches. A must see if this part of American history is your bag.",1377043200,6,1309,4.945454545454545
