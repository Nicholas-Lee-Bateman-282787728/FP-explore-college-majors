5973087,1,B00FAMJ964,"What a waste of $6.99. A young Treat Williams lookalike but a far cry from his acting ability in the lead role. Horrible acting by all the ""actors?"" throughout. The Hair, makeup, and wardrobe almost childish. It looks like they raided the late Michael Jackson s' closets and was picked out by the head designer of the Gay Parade. Even Thors hammer looks like it came off the shelves of toys are us. Watch now while in theaters? What Theaters. Cannot fathom a sane owner of a legit theater would show this pile of dung! This movie stunk worse then a public restroom in the middle of a hot summers day. Musical score very amateurish and did not fit well with this albatross. I suffered through the whole thing hoping it would get better. It never did. A couple of blood letting battles with decent effects if you are into that. The Blood letters(Lead Guy) right hand man looked more like Cochise the Indian more then a Viking and to boot they throw in a Jet Li martial artist with all the moves as well. This one rates right there with the pile of gift my little American Eskimo leaves me in the back yard to pick up. Not worth watching for 7cents let alone renting for the $6.99 I foolishly payed.

Maybe love is too strong as it had a few not so great moments but I overall really enjoyed the action scenes and the Viking quest story.

The story line was also okay a fantasy quest against Norse Gods. What killed it was the costumes, make up and hair. They were terrble and really took away from what could have been a good fantasy. Even with that  I found myself watchng the whole movie. Is it worth your time? This one kind of depends. Check out the first 15 mins. or so.

5973112,3,B00FAMJ964,"An interesting attempt to make an action adventure flick about Vikings.  Supposedly based on folklore and poems, the plot is a typical quest.  Eirick (Dominic Purcell) is supposed to get some ancient relics before Thor does or there will be hell to pay.  Lots of freeze-frame-slow-mo action sequences to punctuate an otherwise dull story that plods along, made even worse thanks in large part to Purcells comatose acting.  His work here is effortless, meaning he put in absolutely no effort whatsoever.  It is painfully obvious from the outset that he didn't want to do this movie.  My story begins the day I died.  Cue a close-up of Purcell acting dead and somewhere along the way he got confused and played dead for the remainder of this movie.

This movie is low budget, but unfortunately they did not care about doing the best with what they had.  Budget does not restrict you from making special effects look realistic.  You can take shots from angles and distance to cover up wiring and lights, but they did not.  You can make a dragon look like a dragon and not a cross between a T Rex and a dog, but they did not.  The sets and costumes are decent and the acting is tolerable, it's to bad they didn't come through on the fight scenes and other F/X.",1449532800,,641,4.137096774193548

5973135,1,B00FAMJ964,"Well heres something you don't see every daya Malaysian produced film about Vikings.  Vikingdom was made by KRU studios, based in Malaysia.  Dominic Purcells as a Viking ruler named Eirick who is killed in battle but brought back to life by the Norse Goddess Freyja.  Eirick abdicates his throne to his brother to live out a solitary life as a hunter.  However peaceful life is broken when he learns that Thor intends to wage war on the world.  Upset that the Norse Gods have been replaced by the Christian God, Thor is seeking several artifacts which he intends to use to restore Norse rule on Earth.

In a Dungeons and Dragons like plot device, Eirick sends out a call to mercenaries and adventurers to join him on his quest to try and find the Horn of Helheim before Thor (Conan Stevens) can find it first.  Among Eiricks band of adventurers is his friend Sven (Fairbass), an Asian slave named Yang (Foo) who they rescued, the beautiful archer Brynna, as well as several other very brawny warriors.

The Dungeons and Dragons description continues to be apt throughout the film as the band of adventurers has to face rival warriors, an under realm of the dead, a bevy of golden skinned beauties who seeks to enchant Eirick to his doom, and a large, guardian half dog, half dragon creature.  The group is even joined by a wizard who looks like Gandalf and acts like Radagast.  Eventually Eirick, who discovers that he has the blood of Gods in him, has to face off against Thor himself.

Its clear that Director Yusry Abdul Halim is a huge fan of the film 300 as he tries to emulate its style from beginning to end.  Battle scenes are shot in slow motion and certain colors (red and green) are bold against an otherwise grey-toned color palette.  The problem, however, is that Vikingdom had less than a quarter of the budget that 300 had.  As a result the film is a mixed bag to say the least.  The visual effects are wildly uneven.  Often times you can see the outline around the actors as they are clearly performing in front of a green screen.  The Dragon/Dog creature appears to have been made out of paper mache.

As silly and weak as the effects are the battle scenes are well choreographed and exciting.  The actors all fit their wells extremely well.  They may not be the best actors but they are all sufficiently burly and can swing a mean sword.  Conan Stevens as Thor especially looks impressive.  Purcell certainly looks the role of a Viking warrior but his charisma is as drab as the films colors.

Had the film gone for more straight action drama without the bad CGI and fantasy elements it would have likely worked much better.",1405382400,,2642,4.562632696390658
5973136,5,B00FAMJ964,"I have read many of the reviews & find people either hated this or loved it!  I think the people that hated it were a bit harsh & maybe didn't get it.  This is a mash up of the Viking Saga's & Norse Mythology!  There are some moments of real cinematic beauty & yes this is not going to win any Oscars or academy awards but for the budget it really delivers a lot of action & fun! The acting is not the greatest but certainly not the worst!  If you are into sword & sorcery or have an affinity towards Vikings you will enjoy this movie. The colors are bold & vivid creating some striking images. The battle scenes are good & the movie was made using color, imagery & bold flights of fancy that give the movie a dreamlike feel, almost like a graphic novel set in motion.  I don't judge movie's by their budget's but whether or not they deliver & for the low price I paid to own this brand new, I would say it succeeded & delivered on three different levels Action, imagery, & fun!!!  If I were to pick out this movies worst part it is the monster that chases the hero out of hell...It reminded me of the old Japanese monsters ( Men in  rubber monster suits) all psychodeliced out !  Which was surprising because the rest of the special effects aren't bad.  This movie was not aiming for intense realism but a blending of the action & drama of the Norse Saga's with the dreamlike imagery of the Norse Myth's & I think it achieved exactly that causing the great division in the reviews!",1404950400,3,1482,4.226950354609929

You can expect epic action scenes their is also a battle scene at the end of the movie army vs army type of battle scene which is fairly epic and is done very nicely.

5973150,1,B00FAMJ964,"I did not have high hopes for this film, but I thought it would be at least as good as Hammer of the Gods. It wasn't even close. Hammer of the Gods (which I didn't mind, btw) is Steven Spielberg next to this. Even Uwe Boll's In the Name of the King looks like Peter Jackson next to this (the Statham one, not the sequel).

This film is kind of a mash-up of recent fantasy flicks, Clash of the Titans, Immortals, 300 and so forth, done in a very inexpert way. It is tedious and unimaginative. What makes it worth watching (arguable), is the absolute ineptitude of the production team.

By the Gods, the costumes are awful. Frey is a stand out for worst costume and worst wig. I don't know what they were thinking, but his yellow chiffon dress thing looks like it was made for a school panto. His wig is extraordinarily bad. Thor's costume is terrible as well, combing a dodgy looking Lord of the Rings LARP style Helmet of Elendil over bright red hair and beard, a Roman muscle cuirass, and 15th century metal gauntlets. His hammer is a large unwieldy looking affair, obviously sprayed silver and which might be made of cardboard and macaroni. Thor's men wear metal helms mostly, which are OK-ish (with the exception of one officer in an oversized horned helmet, the type they sell online to the undiscerning customer who likes to listen to Blind Guardian and Dragonforce and who possibly has a big picture of a pair of wolves with some Native American quote under it; hey, I can say this stuff, I have two Blind Guardian albums and a Dragonforce CD somewhere). Oh, and Thor's men wear odd looking teal coloured tabards. The hero's sword is a 15th century bastard sword (chosen probably because Aragorn carried one similar in the LOTR films) and some galoot is running around in a 15th century barbute helm as well.

The sets range from OK-ish to the worst I've ever seen anywhere. A highlight is a royal hall, where the stones are clearly painted on, amateur theatre style. Like really just painted on stage flats. Quite amazingly and hilariously terrible.",1388361600,,2056,4.5967302452316074

The reasons the movie was bad has been covered many times over by many different people so I won't create a list.

5973160,5,B00FAMJ964,"I was just commenting the other day, what the world really needs is a faux-Viking saga starring Dominic Purcell, a ballet dancer, and an oriental martial arts fighter. Eirick (Purcell) has been brought back from the dead by the goddess Freya (Tegan Moss). He is tasked by Frey (Jesse Moss) to travel to Hellheim to get a horn so he can defeat the evil Thor (Conan Stevens), sorry Avenger fans. Thor wields a huge molded plastic ax while wearing Emo dyed red hair speaking with a voice enhancer. Oh yes, he also hates Jesus, a plot point which made the film more inane.

The film is about Eirick's quest which includes companions in this ""Middle Earth Period"". Some of the people speak modern English, while others prefer bad Renaissance English. Some fighters are endowed with anti-gravity fighting ability, other are less fortunate. There is also a Druid Priest who subs as a wizard (Patrick Murray) an oriental fighter (Jon Foo) and a ballet dancer (Natassia Malthe) who join the quest. Druids, Vikings: they're both old and lived somewhere in Europe, who would know they weren't the same especially after having a guy speaking Chinese. Our hairy Druid wizard has a walking stick with the large proverbial crystal on the end.

The set was overly CG. I can't imagine how fake this would look in Blu-Ray. For a serious viewer, I would recommend watching this film on an analog TV to blur the fake looking CG effects. For those who watch for the cheese, digital is just fine especially that big monster head thing. The dialog and speeches given in the film closely resemble those of other famous films, particularly LOTR.

The film is Asylum/ SyFy bad. But for those of us who like horrible anachronistic films, this one is worth a peek.

5973163,1,B00FAMJ964,"This movie put in a lot of effort to earn 1 star mainly due to the visual effects and the movie attempts to take itself seriously.  I would liken the visual effects to dousing yourself with perfume after a workout.  It stinks, you know you stink, everyone knows you stink, we accept you stink, but the perfume is unbearable.  Even with that I would have been able to watch the entire thing if it tried to put in some humor like in Army of Darkness, Monty Python, or even a Princess Bride.

The opening reflection of the main character as he was reminiscing about what led him there seemed as if he was giving a 3rd grade speech about his dog Skip but he was actually talking about what led up to an epic battle and his death.  I stopped watching after a guy in a see-through wedding gown with glowy stuff showed up at the guy's house.  That was 10 minutes into it.  I woke up mid-way through a battle where the guy was in hell running away from a bobble-head T-Rex demon.

That being said I will try to watch it again when its free on Netflix.  Maybe second time around it could be one of the it's-so-bad-its-good movies like Sharknado.",1382140800,4,1136,4.295774647887324

Acting is horrible, costume, props, sets are amateur at best. Story is so bad it's unwatchable. I couldn't even finish it.

5973166,1,B00FAMJ964,"This movie had poor acting and very poor props,etc. Wasn't very good at all.
Don't waste 7.00 like I did.",1381708800,7,105,4.3
5973167,1,B00FAMJ964,"When I read the review of another reviewer, I thought he might have been exaggerating a bit in regard to the costumes. Nope. From Thor's neon pinkish/red/copper (it changes color) beard and hair to Frey's (not Freya's) bright canary yellow chiffon dress (yes, he wore a woman's dress) to a wizard with weeds growing out of him and a female sidekick in a black leather bikini top in arctic weather.....these costumes and makeup are so bizarre in this movie it detracts from it immensely. One of the worst is the hot pink Barbie sword worn by the hero's brother, the current King in his purple gettup. Those were just a few examples.....

The hero, Eric Bloodletter, has a flat affect throughout the entire movie. He just kinda stares off into space. He seems like he has a hangover and feels really bad. Monotone, no emotions and just seems to be going along for the ride. Even Eric's zombie father showed more emotions than this guy (not joking).

Eric's friend, played by Craig Fairbrass, an English actor, is the only person in this movie with any real acting skills. He looks, sounds and acts the part well. I feel somewhat sorry for Mr. Fairbrass being associated with this movie. Mr. Fairbrass, you should deny being in this movie and have your name removed from the credits. However, if there is any saving grace, it is that they did not make you run around in a dress nor flamboyant attire like some of the other actors. The motherland may allow you to come back home.

The movie also has Viking zombies, of which Eric's dad is the head zombie.....but we come to find out later Eric's parentage is somewhat complex and unclear and a bit unsavory.

We also find some actors in the movie somewhat overweight, aged and unable to fulfill the roll of a Viking warrior. The result is Grandpa Viking running down the hill with a bow and arrow looking quite silly. Meanwhile, the other actors must wait on the elderly Viking, so they are just kinda standing around, twiddling their thumbs, during the fight scene. I hate to say it, but I was glad to see Grandpa ""die,"" just so he could get on the ground. I thought he was going to require an inhaler or some oxygen.

Whoever is responsible for the costumes and makeup absolutely ruined this movie. Even the props were horribly done and come across as a joke. For example, when Eric goes into the Underworld, and he must fight the Hellhound, and we find the Hellhound is, from what I could tell, one of those paper dragons used in Chinese parades. It looked totally ridiculous. Another example, when another reviewer, Bob, mentions that Thor's Hammer looks like it came from the shelves at ToysRUs, he hit the nail on the head. However, hitting a nail with Thor's hammer may have caused it to deflate. The little girl from ""Adventures In Babysitting"" had a better Thor's Hammer than this dude (his was bigger but a total waste of paper mache). It is difficult to take Thor seriously when he looks like he just came from the beauty parlor getting a dye job (no offense to beauticians, the dye job was severely amateurish).

Anyone associated with creating this movie should be banned from movie making forever.

Also, the Vikings apparently like to drop the ""F bomb"" a lot. This movie is an ""F bomb"" in the past tense.",1381622400,27,3265,4.599656357388316

Then there's the English accented actors and American accented actors and Asian accented actors: pick an accent and stick with it. You can also tell that most of them are wearing wigs.

For example, Thor is a Protector of men and Midgard (earth), and they have him as the main villain wanting to destroy Midgard with the help of Frey the fertility god, acting like a deceiver and trickster, which is generally Loki's role. The movie itself has some pretty good costume work, but also some horrid costume work. Poor dialogue, poor acting, poor wigs everywhere. Although some of the sets I thought were pretty nice, but then you switch to a scene where the set is horrible and cheesy. If you are bored or have a nostalgia for 80's style fantasy romp, you can give it a go, otherwise just avoid it.

Some great characters here, licorice haired Thor, Kung Fu ""elf"", a Druid, true cheesiness to match the boxed wine quality of everything else.
