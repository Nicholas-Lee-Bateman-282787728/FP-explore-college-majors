937342,5,6304906153,"I love the R. L. Stine movies. My son and I love to watch a good scary movie, but finding a good, clean movie that's not too gory and is suitable for a child to watch is quite the task. Thanks to R. L. Stine for bringing back movies that are like the ones I watched as a child. I just wish I could find all of the stories on video.",1048204800,2,331,3.676056338028169

937344,5,6304906153,"This is definitely one of my favorite Goosebump videos. I've seen
this Goosebumps video about 1,000 times (at least a lot). One reason I liked this one was because in the episode there were two not so bright kids and one always repeated everything that the other guy said. This added some humor to the scary story. I also liked it because the video made you think that any of the characters could be werewolves. It is a surprise in the end when you find out who it really is. I'm not going to give any more away. Watch it and see for yourself. It's worth it!",1036627200,5,558,4.224299065420561

I do not recommend this film at all for school aged children,1004572800,4,366,3.9594594594594597

937398,4,6304906153,"The Goosebumps TV series aired in the early 1990s. The series had low-budget special effects, bad acting, and poorly adapted scripts based on the books by R.L. Stine.

In My Best Friend is Invisible, Sam Jacobs and his best friend, Roxanne Johnson, are doing their school term paper on the haunted Hedge House, but there is something more scarier than ghost waiting for them.

An Old School tells the tale of two brothers Tom and John who are being babysat by their Aunt Dahlia while their parents are gone. They eat a few of their Aunt's famous prune cookies and the brothers find themselves growing older and older.

These are two of the oddest episodes from the series. An Old Story is more of a comedy, while My Best Friend is Invisible is more on the light-horror side. These are not the greatest episodes, but kids will like watching them around Halloween.",1346457600,2,862,4.657894736842105

937439,4,6304906153,"Last October Cartoon Network had a weekend of GOOSEBUMPS. 40 episodes were shown.
  I spent most of the weekend entertained. Some were boring. For youngsters it seems like good Halloween programming.
  The horror genre have its cliques, ghosts, vampires, witches, and werewolves. In R.L. Stine's defense he manages to trick us all into believing one thing, when something unexpected is added into the picture.
  A lesson or two may come through. In ""The Haunted Mask,"" Carlie Beth is taught love is powerful, over evils.

The message is repeated in the second story, when a trouble maker school mate discovers the mask. Putting it on to scare everyone,he becomes trapped inside, till Carlie Beth, and her friends find him.
The young man witnesses Carlie in danger, and comes to her aide. This allows his face to normalize, and the mask to release!

937441,5,6304906153,"This movie is a great comedy. A little freaky at times but very hilarious! As always, that Slappy is hilarious, with all his pranks and what not! Oh, that Slappy! I'd say it's a definate must have and the Slappy movies are the only ones worth watching out of Goosebumps, and maybe Horrorland and the Haunted Mask ones. PS Say Cheese And Die [movie] is very boring, and so is it's sequal and the acting is the worst.",1194134400,,415,4.333333333333333

937443,3,6304906153,"The acting is terrible the story of Slappy makes not a lick of sence(mainly because Slappy gets killed in Night of the Living Dummy II and III) And the ending to ""An Old Story"" is (REAL) cheesey. But like I said: ""...You gotta remember it's Goosebumps.""

Here's a breif refrence of both episodes:

""Bride of the Living Dummy""-Wal preforming a vantroliquist act, Slappy(brout to life with the voice of the strange Cathal J. Dodd)

falls dropp-dead in love with a little girl named Katie's(Sophie Bennett) or so they think...

""An Old Story""-Jon and Tom's(Jordan Allison and Kyle J. Downes)

parents are out and their grandma is in. So she feeds them prune cookies and they end up looking 48 years older.

Cover=D+

""Bride of the Living Dummy""=B-

937447,5,6304906153,"This is definately the BEST and SCARIEST Goosebumps video ever! The plot is simply amazing, the story is captivating, and it's just downright terrifying! The only thing wrong about it is, the acting could use a little work. Parents, DON'T let kids under 10 watch this movie! There is a scene where Alex, the main charachter, is talking to is teacher at night in the forest, and the teacher turns around all of a sudden, and he has fangs, a white face, and popping eyes. I'm 11 now, but I first saw it when I was about 8. It was kinda hard to sleep, believe me! Now to the plot. This city kid goes to his aunt's house. He wants to enter a contest to take the scariest picture. At first, nothing scary happens, but then, he learns the legend of the werewolves, and things pick up from there. Besides that teacher scene I talked about before, the scariest scene is when he's looking out his window and these werewolves pop up. Luckily, he gets a few pictures. Anyway, buy this movie now! It's great and you won't be dissapointed! SEE Ya!",1060473600,17,1034,4.390625
