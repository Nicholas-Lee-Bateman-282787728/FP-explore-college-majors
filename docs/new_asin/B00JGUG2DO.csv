6356776,5,B00JGUG2DO,the kind of movie that needs to be shown and taught in this day and age. the kind of film where education and the mind is challenged and not the garbage that the media and Hollywood pimp and push across as a way and avenue. there was a time when films were made to educate and show how racist and one sided things were and how they impact a future of the unknown.films don't come out of the woodwork these days and they are missed.,1414281600,5,431,4.08235294117647

6356778,5,B00JGUG2DO,A great timeless classic!  Thank goodness for a movie that has a genuine heart and runs counter to all the Political BS today! It just shows what goodness there is in the world and what genuine progress can be made in love and respect between cultures and races when one's heart in in the right place and things are done for the right reasons. John Voight shines in this film and shows what this man is made of;;and still today he remains true to  sound principles that are demonstrated in this remarkable little under appreciated film!,1409270400,13,536,4.572916666666667
6356779,5,B00JGUG2DO,"it was one of the first really special films i saw on the television alone, on a sunday afternoon. it didn't have Nazi's or car chases and it was more powerful and moving than all the other films id seen before. john voight made me want to grow up to be like him. and the sweetness, gentleness and overall home town feel of the film made me feel included. a very special film.",1402790400,8,376,4.164383561643835
6356780,5,B00JGUG2DO,"On a Saturday afternoon in 1974, when I was 11 years old, I went with my two best friends to the local movie theater (remember when movie houses only showed one movie at a time, not twelve??) to see the new version of ""The Three Musketeers.""  Much to our dismay, and not un-typical of that time, we discovered that the Main Feature would be preceded by another full movie (something called a ""double bill"" which no longer exists anymore).  That other movie--which we didn't pay to see and didn't want to see--was ""Conrack.""  Four decades later, I can remember nothing about ""The Three Musketeers,"" but ""Conrack"" remains the movie I've never been able to forget, one I stayed up late nights to watch on TV before there was such a thing as a VCR (let alone DVD or Blu-Ray Player), one I've eagerly awaited to be released in digital format while thousands of far less worthy films were released and re-relased.  And all along, I've wondered why a movie of such compelling characters, superb performances, stunning cinematography, and even Hollywood pedigree (Jon Voight, Paul Winfield, Hume Cronyn for crying out loud! and director Martin Ritt) has gone virtually unnoticed.

You can imagine my reaction when I just happened upon the item page for ""Conrack: Limited Edition Blu-Ray"" here at Amazon.com.  My heart nearly leapt out of my chest.

This movie, based on Pat Conroy's ""The Water is Wide"" tells the story of an idealistic white schoolteacher arriving on a remote and utterly isolated island off the South Carolina coast to teach the children of the exclusively black population.  What follows is alternately fascinating and infuriating, funny and touching, loathsome and lovable.  Among other things, it raises questions about the roots of racial discrimination and the constitution of educational curriculum.  If that sounds boring and pedantic to you, the movie's really not.  Maybe some will find it a little corny--especially the final moments of the film--but I find it hard to believe that anyone could view this movie and not at least be moved by the children (so wonderful!) and the title character's interaction with them.

I can't say for sure that my experience with ""Conrack"" circa 1974 is what made me grow up to become a writer and a high school teacher, but it just might be.

3,000 copies available in this Limited Edition, folks.  Get it while you can.",1399680000,41,2375,4.905
8650726,5,B00JGUG2DO,"The film begins in the Spring of 1969.  Jim Crow is barely a faded memory and the ink on the Great Society is still wet.  The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. happened the year previous.  Budding author Pat Conroy (Jon Voight) takes an assignment on an island off the coast of South Carolina as a substitute teacher to itinerant black children.  What he finds is truly horrifying.  These adolescents through systematic neglect and indifference are illiterates.  These kids have no basic life or survival skills.  They have no knowledge of Western culture, or any culture outside the island for that matter, or the finer things in life.  These wretches would have been better off in a Confederate plantation where at least the masters or overseers provided at least something of substance to them.  Conrack, as Conroy is affectionately nicknamed by the children, instills into these kids a zest for learning and living.  Conrack inevitably finds out that there is a price to pay for bucking the system.  Director Martin Ritt was probably the most humanistic director to ever work in the industry.  Ironically he was a victim of the blacklist in the Fifties.  You can sense the outrage in this work but Ritt gently informs the audience without bludgeoning the point.  Love the evocative use of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in the film's closing moments.  Adapting Conroy's ""The Water is Wide"", Irving Ravetch and Harriett Frank's script brims with warmth and knowingness.  They paint pictures of people so that even the nominal heavies are not caricatures.  Voight is stupendous as Conrack instilling the man with zest and a zeal for action.  I think my favorite scene in the film is one where Conrack tells an island moonshiner (Paul Winfield) that he would absolve himself of racism by twice drinking a black man's urine.  ""Conrack"" is a relatively obscure film today which is perplexing.  I remember seeing this is in a high school English class almost forty years ago and it resonated with me.  The themes outlined here are timeless and universal.  I would not hesitate viewing this to the kids of today.",1520726400,2,2111,4.9375
8650727,5,B00JGUG2DO,"Fabulous movie, wonderful performances by everyone esp. John Voight. No car crashes or bloody murders and appropriate for teens as well as adults... although some of it might go over a young person's head, they will get the drift.

8650732,5,B00JGUG2DO,"One of my favorite movies of all time.  I don't follow Pat Conroy or his books, but this movie had a profound effect on me when I first saw this as a young teen.  I had a hard time with Madge Sinclair's role as the school ""prinicpal,"" and who seemed to be more concerned with status quo and not upsetting the school board, to the detriment of these young children.  Today's public education system needs more teachers like Jon Voight's portrayal...unafraid to teach outside the box, and doing so with enthusiasm and commitment to children of all backgrounds.",1468368000,,558,4.673469387755102
