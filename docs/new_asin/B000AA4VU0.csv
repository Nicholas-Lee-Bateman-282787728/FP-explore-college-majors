2383309,3,B000AA4VU0,"This dvd is very simplified and easy for anyone, especially someone with any dance experience. If you are a true beginner in dance, this is the dvd for you.  However, if you have experience in it, unless you want to tune up the basics, I think you will be left bored as I was.  I could hardly get through the video. But this lady is very good at slowly explaining all the steps and showing you them all at different angles.

It goes over feet placement: how to bend your knees, roll your hips, pelvic moments, taps, points, chasses, grapevine, turns, walks, and swivels.  There is a beginning level and an intermediate level, both with demonstrations at the end of all the movements put together with music playing.

Again, if you know nothing about dance, this is the dvd for you.",1159315200,26,781,4.51063829787234
2383310,5,B000AA4VU0,"I wanted to learn to dance but group dance lessons in my area didn't teach dancing like this (solo/no partner) and private lessons cost WAY too much for me.

I'm not afraid to say that I have no rhythm.  This DVD has really helped me! Kasha breaks things down easily and an advantage to having a DVD is you can pause and rewind and repeat a certain step again and again without the instructor getting impatient! Ha, ha.

This is a good investment and a good place to start.",1157328000,33,473,4.292134831460674
2383311,5,B000AA4VU0,"This is a good introduction to dancing.  It won't teach you everything you need, but that's why you need to buy more DVDs from the same people.  I think it's excellent and easy to follow.",1143072000,19,187,4.314285714285714
2383312,4,B000AA4VU0,"For a female with no knowledge of how to dance, or very little rhythem this is a wonderful video.

Basic moves to get you in the groove and muliple camera angles make these steps easy to learn. It's the basics of how to make it look like you know how to dance and to get you out on the dance floor (of a typical white female dance club).

I'm male...if you're male, I highly discourage you wasting your money to learn these feminine moves. I gave the video to my wife.",1140825600,71,468,4.131868131868132
2383313,5,B000AA4VU0,"If you have 4 left feet this is the dvd for you!! I have bought around 5 dvd's to help me learn some moves but no one has been as good as Anyone Can Dance... She teaches from how to move your feet and knees and also tells you when to move your toe and heel. She even shows all the moves front and back and from the left and right sides. She goes at a steady pace too so you do not feel frustrated or lost. This dvd teaches basic contemporary nightclub dancing not outdated moves and then you add ur own spin to what you learn here. My only regret is that I did not get the dvd that cost $20 more and had more content, because if this one is fantastic, I can only imagine what the other one is like.",1138665600,37,698,3.8541666666666665

8076754,1,B000AA4VU0,This video was not informative and very cheesy. I am not sure what nightclub this women goes to but it is nothing like where I am from.,1386633600,,135,4.037037037037037
8076755,2,B000AA4VU0,"Chapters include:
BEGINNER - Rhythm in Place (stepping in place, bending your knees, pelvic thrusts, hip bumps), Taps (step-tap), Points (pointing your foot), Different levels (bend your knees), Chasses (double step), Review of 1-5 INTERMEDIATE - Grapevine, Turns, Hip Rolls, Walks, Swivels, Review of 6-10

From the clips you will see this is old style, passe, 1970s, 1980s Solid Gold, Soul Train dancing.
Kasia Kozak is a great teacher though, she shows both front & back views, normal speed first, breaks it down & tells you what body part to move instead of just counting. I will try her hip hop possibly which you can see clips on youtube, etc. on.
I like Kasia & the decent production & pace. I took off 3 stars for the style of dance, lack of music during instruction even softly & lame music when they do dance to music.

8076758,3,B000AA4VU0,"This video was very very basic. If you're like me and just want to learn how to dance in the club like other girls/guys. This video isn't for you. As a matter of a fact, I can't think of anyone who could benefit from this video.",1178496000,4,228,3.9782608695652173
8076759,3,B000AA4VU0,"This video is very basic, starting with stepping in place and throwing in a bit of grape vine, etc. in the later steps.  If you don't know anything about stepping or moving this may be helpful, though if I saw the instructor in a nightclub dancing the way she does on this video I may laugh out loud.",1174867200,3,300,4.172413793103448

She was great! I never got frustrated, and have found that when my radio is on, instead of only being able to dance to one every 30, I can now put her moves to almost EVERY song! I love it! Get it memorized in your head, and you can dance all night long. Definitely for beginners. It did what I wanted which was allowed me to look and feel good solo dancing!",1170633600,7,522,3.9339622641509435
