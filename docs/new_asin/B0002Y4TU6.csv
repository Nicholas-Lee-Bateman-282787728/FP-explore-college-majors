8324215,5,B0002Y4TU6,"Bob Carlin's DVDs for the banjo are the best I have seen.  The first DVD will teach you hand position, ergonomic banjo position, hammer-ons and pull-offs, and four songs with variations.
  The second DVD teaches drop-thumb technique, slides,  and four songs.
  All the arrangements are quite good and in three different tunings  (The numbers are in G tuning, C tuning, and Modal tuning ).
  Anyone who works through these two DVDs will certainly have a good foundation in banjo playing.
  The tablature booklet is also quite good.
  Bob Carlin explains everything very clearly and demonstrates all the techniques.  He also plays each song several times, both slowly and up to speed.",1393200000,5,682,5.027027027027027
8324216,5,B0002Y4TU6,"The basic clawhammer strum takes time to develop. (Ive been at it for a year, and it's starting to sound pretty ripping now!).  This video is great, goes through everything slow, has good songs, which progress from easiest (basic strum) to hammer ons and pull offs, then to doubble thumb, then finally to drop thum, which he says takes you through beginner to intermediate.  I think drop thumb is pretty tricky, so I might put it beginner to advanced.  Like I said, I've been at it for a year, and I'm not through to the end of the 2nd DVD yet, and can't drop thumb that well.  I would also recommend checking out the ""daily frail"" from patrick on youtube.com, as he is a great teacher too.  Watch out though, clawhammer is more additictive than crack, and could lead to broken relationships with those around you!",1194480000,12,814,4.5479452054794525
