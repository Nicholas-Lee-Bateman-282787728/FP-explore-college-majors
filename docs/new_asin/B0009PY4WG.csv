8065214,1,B0009PY4WG,"This is a very poor quality DVD transfer.  Apparently it was transferred to DVD from a bad VHS cassette and has the defects of that source material.  It also stops playing during the last fight scene with six minutes remaining to the movie.  (I assume the good guys win.) I had Amazon replace my first defective DVD with another and it stops at exactly the same spot.  I'm going to get a refund on the second one.

It appears to be a bootleg or pirate production.  I doubt the company that produced this particular DVD even has the rights to produce this.",1211241600,,555,4.392156862745098
