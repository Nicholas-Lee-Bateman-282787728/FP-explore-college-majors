8286326,1,B001CAZ28W,"unfortunately we did not know that we would NOT like this video until we started viewing it, then found out that we still have to pay to much for something we don't like....not a good policy.
Very disappointed in the quality and narration.",1456185600,,239,4.5813953488372094
8286327,2,B001CAZ28W,I purchased this DVD so I could get a better idea of what Alaska has to offer and make decisions on what areas to visit.  This is a slideshow with a brief explanation at the end of the DVD.  I am no more enlightened by this DVD but my wallet is a little lighter.,1274572800,,262,3.8333333333333335
8286328,5,B001CAZ28W,"Spectacular views in a ""everyman"" guide.  While the reviewer before me felt that it was an amateur piece, I would disagree.  The tips provided by Barbara and Bob Magill were perfect for the novice adventurer.  I appreciated the casual tone and approachability that ""Alaska"" provided for, well, a trip to Alaska.  I found the Magills insightful and their commentary practical.  I would gladly take a trip to Alaska with the Magills in tow.",1247270400,,438,4.945205479452055
8286329,1,B001CAZ28W,"This is a repetitiously boring, poorly made travelog that could easily be condensed into about 5 minutes of viewing time. It reminds you of the vacation slide shows your relatives used to impose on you. Same old, same old series of shots for every location:  wide-angle and pan of unknown scenery; zoom in on glacier or mountain peak; zoom out from same; close up of running streams or waterfalls; rock level views of running waters; old buiildings; animals you are likely to see out of an RV window; and endless footage of an aircraft wing and strut.  At the end of the video you learn that the Magill's wanted to spend a summer driving through Alaska in their RV.  They shot mediocre quality video along the way and cobbled it together into a DVD that has no story or theme to tie it together.  Alaska is so special it deserves much, much better than this.",1237852800,2,858,4.516129032258065
8286330,5,B001CAZ28W,I am planning to go to Alaska and found the travel tips very helpful. I liked the fact that a lot of the DVD had background music rather than dialogue so you can appreciate the scenery and the wildlife. Can't wait to visit some of the non touristy spots shown in the video.,1216080000,2,273,4.169811320754717
8286331,5,B001CAZ28W,"I was left breathless as one of the privileged few who caught a sneak preview of ALASKA.  The crisp hi-res footage comes second to seamless editing and masterful photography.  Without a doubt, the closest one can visually come to the glacial steppes and alpine terrain of our northern state is alongside Bob Magill on his expeditions through ALASKA.",1215561600,4,349,5.0
