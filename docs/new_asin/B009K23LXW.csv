5344148,5,B009K23LXW,This dvd is great. I love watching Tosh! The dvd itself was brand new and came fast! Even for the holidays!,1358640000,,107,4.142857142857143
5344149,1,B009K23LXW,"Ok, so this is a clip-show with stuff from YouTube. I can respect that the quality of those videos is going to be poor, but the entire presentation here is bad. There's noticeable interlacing and artifacting.

I could overlook those issues if this were a full season release, but instead it's like 2/3 of the season and the rest is unavailable on BD (just like they did with the first season). Why are studios starting to do this? It's a rubbish money-grubbing practice and a disservice to the fans.",1358380800,2,499,4.606741573033708
5344150,5,B009K23LXW,I really like Tosh. 0 as a comedian and Season 2 is a great addition to my collection of his TV show.,1358380800,,101,3.6363636363636362
5344151,5,B009K23LXW,"Great stuff here!
Between this volume and volume one you are missing 15 episodes.

Those are actually collected in what is being called volume three and it is only available at Walmart (unfortunately)

That collection collects Cardigans and Casual Jackets

Just so you know",1358294400,7,273,5.159090909090909
5344152,5,B009K23LXW,I have been wationg forever for Tosh to have dvd's for all of the seasons.  Finally  I have them all,1357084800,,100,3.95
5344153,5,B009K23LXW,"16 New Episodes, but why is vol 3 only available at walmart, but that is besides the point. Great season, all uncensored, Freaking Great Dvd",1356912000,,140,4.64
5344154,5,B009K23LXW,"I have recently got into this show while catching it on CC. I came to Amazon to find that there is no season sets, but instead this Bluray and another with 10 episodes of the first season. I know the digital version is on the Amazon store, but I don't like buying digital and would gladly pay for complete season box sets of this show on Bluray. This show is just too funny and totally worth it.",1353456000,5,395,4.142857142857143
5344155,5,B009K23LXW,Don't get me wrong i am super excited for the Tosh. O : Deep v's Dvd because i am a huge tosh.o fan but what i can't figure out is why they are leaving episodes out of the dvd collections like the Tosh. O : Hoodies was the first 10 episodes and now the next Dvd is Tosh. O : Deep V's and its episodes 30 thru 41. What about the 6 episodes(cardigans) missing from the first season and the first 14 episodes(casuel jackets) from the second season. Are they just not releasing those or are the going to come back to them ?,1351987200,11,519,4.0
5344166,3,B009K23LXW,Really good clips and comedy by the folks who bring you the weekly show. Only drawback is that Comedy Central reruns these shows alot.,1402358400,,134,4.625

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who don't get offended easily. If you don't like humor that's shocking, misogynistic, vulgar, racist, or that's not politically correct, (I could go on, but I won't) I would NOT recommend this DVD at all.",1361404800,3,962,4.063157894736842

5344175,5,B009K23LXW,"If you do not know by now then you will never know how great of a show tosh.o really is, but why would they make season 1 so short and season 2 twice as long, while missing a lot of  episodes from the blue-rays, was up with the producers there, seems someone got so damn anxious to release the first season, that when the show got going they side tracked season 2 to long and now have no room for some of the episodes, was up with that. Put the lost episodes on season 2. Then they just could of saved some later material on season 2 and released it for season 3 so we won't have to wait forever between seasons again.",1358985600,,618,4.024390243902439
