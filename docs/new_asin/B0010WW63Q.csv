3054406,2,B0010WW63Q,"I would expect any music dvd this day, and age, to playback in at least dolby 5.1!  I was not able to accomplish that, but was happy to have a concert dvd by the group!",1360454400,,168,3.8
3054407,5,B0010WW63Q,"If you are a fan, get this. If you think this band is okay and only like certain songs....then this probably isn't for you. Enough said.",1358035200,2,136,4.269230769230769
3054408,5,B0010WW63Q,Love Maroon 5 could watch Adam Levine over and over again.  The picture and sound is great.  Glad I purchased the dvd.,1356134400,,118,4.318181818181818
3054409,4,B0010WW63Q,It doesnt matter as long as its Maroon 5. I would like to have a DVD of all their videos with them commentating the reasons for the song and video.,1353196800,,147,3.933333333333333
3054410,3,B0010WW63Q,"This is a good dvd but I was expecting something more.  I was a little disappointed, but it's still Maroon 5 music.  How can you go wrong with that?",1345507200,,148,4.068965517241379
3054411,5,B0010WW63Q,"I looked everywhere for a Maroon 5 video, but couldn't find anything of a similar price. The other reviews on here were good. I decided to get this as a Christmas gift for a coworker.  She really liked it.  It has Adam Levine and gang.  These are some of the older songs. For the price, it was not bad.",1322870400,4,302,4.084745762711864
3054412,4,B0010WW63Q,"First, the good, and there's a lot: most importantly, the music on this DVD is great. It's not just video of the same old songs...the performance of ""She Will Be Loved,"" in particular, sounds fantastic. (Be advised, though, that certain lyrics have been censored. On ""Makes Me Wonder,"" you can see that Adam doesn't even bother saying the F-word.) The bonus interview is a fun watch too. I'm really glad that I have this in my collection.

That said I have some minor quibbles. I'm not thrilled with (though not surprised by) the censoring. And the interview is only with Adam and James...Jesse, Ryan and Mickey are missing. My biggest complaint is also a compliment, though - the music is so good that I wish there were more than a handful of songs!

It's not perfect, but it's still very good. At $6.95 (as of this review anyway) it's more than worth the price. I'd say that any Maroon 5 fan should definitely have this DVD.",1308182400,10,926,4.572289156626506
3054413,5,B0010WW63Q,"This will please a dear friend of mine who's completely fanatic about Maroon 5. And since I am a music lover myself, I am glad to land to her this, as I am too an admirer of their music and talent.",1229558400,2,197,3.8292682926829267
3054434,5,B0010WW63Q,"This Walmart Soundcheck Maroon 5 dvd contains enthralling performances of five of their songs on this dvd; Makes Me Wonder, She Will Be Loved, Sunday Morning, This Love, and Wont Go Home Without You. The Walmart Soundcheck Maroon 5 dvd also features an interview where Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine discusses how the Maroon 5 group came to be with one of the members discussing they are glad to have agreed to be part of the group but that it was a difficult decision to walk away from their other group to do so.  She Will Be Loved and Wont Go Home Without You are probably my favorite performances from the dvd, but Im lucky to have first heard of Maroon 5 around 2004 when I was living in California with the songs being This Love and Harder To Breathe being some of the first songs that I head from Maroon 5. The Walmart Soundcheck Maroon 5 dvd is fine for anyone who is familiar with any of the songs by Maroon 5 and/or who like pop rock music.",1434672000,,949,4.301675977653631
