7885744,4,6305220964,"Scarred City, 1998 film

This is set in New York city. A patrolman walks down a street, then chases three men in an alley. One man ducks into a basement and is followed. The cop shoots this man, then finds he has no gun. Another detective inspects the victim. Later we hear why this was done. The ""SCAR Squad"" lieutenant explains the deal. They operate a stake-out at a porno shop. Three robbers find more than they expected. This squad has a 100% mortality rate for perpetrators. Does anybody care? The new man gets an initiation into this squad. A big car delivers three young women to a mansion for entertainment for Rafael Soto. Later the police will raid this place in the early morning. There is a pool on who pops Soto. Shots are fired like in a war movie. Take no prisoners? That young woman climbs out a window to escape. We learn about this young woman who was saved, as well as that limo driver.

Te new man, John Tracy, looks up people on the police computer. The lieutenant of the SCAR squad is told about the girl that got away. Cooperation? There is a raid on a house. A double-cross? Can Tracy escape? Can he rescue the girl that got away? Can he triumph over a 6' 8"" 300 lb bouncer? Yes. There is another shooting in the parking lot, then on the road, until the red car crashes into an empty swimming pool. The radio tells about a wanted rogue cop. Where can they go? The next morning the shooting begins. Can a lighter and spray can help? They escape the house. [Would all those shots be ignored by the public?] The squad will need more replacements. There is a meeting with Sam and the lieutenant. Tracy shoots again then they drive away. ""Feel better?"" Where are they going? [No seat belts or roll bar? They must like to live dangerously!]

This has so much violence as to be a parody. Was it meant to be a comedy or a warning against a city where the public is helpless with an out-of-control police squad? Is this like some South American country where the people have been disarmed and the military enforce the rule of the aristocratic ruling class? About thirty years ago there was a policy where a stake-out team took no prisoners. Does that still go on? Is this just an action team or does it provide a warning? How realistic is this story? It warns against the idea that restricting guns to the police and military alone. Examples from the last century warn against this policy. Would you restrict fire extinguishers only to member of the fire department? Should only members of the Teamsters Union be allowed to drive motor vehicles (which are classified as a deadly weapon when used for assault)?",1357344000,,2625,4.475991649269311
7885745,4,6305220964,It is a very good action movie.  I like Stephen Baldwin.  I have watched this movie multiple times. I recommend this movie.,1357171200,,123,4.545454545454546
7885746,2,6305220964,"Stephen Baldwin (The Usual Suspects, Bio-Dome) stars as SCAR team member John who gets mixed up with nice hooker Candy played by the beautiful Tia Carrere (Relic Hunter, True Lies) when his SCAR team members invade a place and kill thugs along with two of Carrere's hookers friends. Baldwin helps Carrere escape before she is found and killed. Carerre tells her boss about what happened and her boss tells Baldwin's boss Laine played by Chazz Palminteri (The Usual Suspects, Running Scared) about what Baldwin did. So, he has a couple of SCAR members try to take out Baldwin but Baldwin eventually escapes and grabs Carrere as both him and her are on the run. Carrere is sexy and she has a wonderful singing voice and keeps this movie alive. Baldwin plays this performance in many of his other movies but here and there he has good moments but nothing special. Some of the action is good but it's not that great of an action/thriller. Also starring DB Woodside (Tv's 24, Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Michael Rispoli (Snake Eyes, Angie), Andrew Davoli (Room 6, Knockaround Guys) and Gary Dourdan (CSI, Playing God)",1152057600,,1111,4.821989528795812
7885747,5,6305220964,I didn't expect the unsual suspects but what I found was a film with some great great moments. funny and caustic....a beautiful song by Tia.... some fantastic scenes made the occasional 2-D plot come to life with the fresh chemistry between the two stars!,1129161600,4,255,4.818181818181818
7885748,3,6305220964,"Once you accept the premise that a band of vigilante cops is sanctioned by higher authorities, SCARRED CITY is a watchable crime thriller.  The stoic Stephen Baldwin does little to heighten his acting persona, but again his laconic often soporific demeanor works in his favor as the cop who finds himself a member of a group of lawmen who take the law into their own hands, ultimately becoming as vile as the perps they are killing.  Chazz Palminteri and Tia Carrere are along for the ride, and Carrere shows a fine singing voice in a couple of songs she performs as the typical hooker with a heart of gold.  The action scenes are well staged and although the plot itself is Swiss Cheese, it entertains and fulfills what you expect.",1117152000,3,732,4.615384615384615
7885749,2,6305220964,"A few shootouts here and there aren't what I call entertainment, but at least you won't be bored too long. The Usual Suspect's Chazz and Steven are wasted in this plotless peice of action, only die hard fans of action need apply.",943833600,,229,4.476190476190476
