But how anyone can hate a movie blessed with the presence of Cushing is a tall question indeed. -He's wonderful in a rather small part,  one I understand he even did more or less as a favor to Hammer boss  Carreras. The action scenes involving gun-fights and car-chases are nice to  watch, but because the Shaw Brothers co-produced we sadly have to endure  some martial arts stuff as well. Not only is this a Hammer film with the  great sir Peter, but two other faves of mine are also featured; Stuart  Whitman and Anton Diffring. By no means a great movie, but most certainly  not the terrible mess some would have you believe, either.",951868800,6,718,4.606299212598425
7881230,4,6304960689,"My Sennheiser HDR 120 cordless earphones really helped me enjoy Shatter this time out (my 2nd) . When last I visited Shatter , my fun , funky hero was in a clam shell case on VHS . A fine 3rd party citizen furnished me with a flawless , like new , DVD copy of Shatter complete with all artwork and features I'd been unable to enjoy on cassette tape .
First off , I think it's worth noting that the voice sound work for Shatter is pretty rough going in both formats . Hence the nice , loud  (one can adjust the volume) and directly-in-ear earphones . Now , I can finally , intelligibly understand Peter Cushing (we share the exact same birthday , only 50 years apart) utter the nonsensical line ""The opium is converted into high grade cocaine"" ? How does that happen exactly ?
Unlike many who may read these words , I've seen only a scant few kung fu pictures . A few Bruce Lee pictures , the television series and a few others . As such , I'm personally really knocked out by all of the kung fu sequences . All of them .
I really love that the whole film is shot on location in Hong Kong . I really feel as if I've actually been some place new and , in fact , I have .
There's an old school Hydrofoil and a pretty girl for the terrifically American Stuart Whitman . There's Anton Diffring (Circus Of Horrors , The Man Who Could Cheat Death) as an oily banker/syndicate dude .
Shatter's even got his own funky music . Some stock war footage . A grenade rifle . fun and amusing action and a camera/gun  head hood that's certainly got to be one-of-a-kind .
It's not ""why should I check out Shatter"" ? It's , what took you so long you silly Hammerhead .",1407283200,,1649,4.133956386292835
7881231,5,6304960689,"This isn't the usual Hammer movie with Cushing but really good.
It's a Kung Fu Action movie. Stuart is great as the American agent
and Cushing as the evil bad guy. The story and action made this
a winner for any fan of Cushing and Stuart. One of my favorites.",1390089600,,259,4.2
7881232,3,6304960689,"I have a long association with SHATTER going back to the mid 1970s when it was one of those films that instead of going straight to DVD, went straight to cable. In the early days of HBO where it was known as CALL HIM MR SHATTER, the movie was a late night fixture airing after more respectable viewers had gone to bed. I remember thinking at the time what an oddball cinematic exercise it was to mix a film noir plot (doublecrossed hitman seeks revenge) with martial arts (or kung-fu as Americans used to say) activity. And what were Hammer stalwarts Peter Cushing and Anton Diffring doing in this East-West hodgepodge? Surely this wasn't a Hammer production? Indeed it was. In fact it was Cushing's last role for the company where he had been a mainstay since starring in CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN 17 years earlier and he makes the most of his brief appearances as an amoral police official.

SHATTER was the second and last collaboration of Hammer with Hong Kong's Shaw Brothers after the notorious but hard to dislike LEGEND OF THE 7 GOLDEN VAMPIRES. Both movies were made in 1974 and while LEGEND proceeded fairly smoothly and wound up making money, SHATTER was a troubled production and didn't recoup its meager budget which is why it went to cable so fast. Cult American director Monte Hellman (TWO LANE BLACKTOP) started the film but was replaced halfway through after bitching about nearly everything (just listen to his commentary). Michael Carreras found himself directing another film where the director was unable to complete his assignment. World weary Stuart Whitman looks as if he'd rather be anywhere else but at least it's not THE MONSTER CLUB or DEMONOID. Not a good movie but it's not without some merit. Great ending. Something for true Hammer afficionados.",1379289600,,1773,4.832236842105263
7881233,5,6304960689,"I was upset to learn my former roomate, instead of giving me a heads up, decided to throw out my sweet sweet vhs collection.  Among my precious gems was this movie, which I bought for like five bucks, now I have to go out and buy the dvd which is going for 20 bucks.  People need to chillax and take this movie for what it is: a campy B movie.  It's awesome in that way where it's okay to talk over a film with your friends and totally joke around, the story is questionable and the acting is a little dry but this is a movie where I hope it never gets forgotten, although it seems like its about to.  I respect other peoples opinions, but if you are looking to have a good time and make silly comments with your friends than this is the movie for you.",1243900800,,752,4.026845637583893
7881234,3,6304960689,"I saw this film when I was a teen and I was enthralled with the exotic over seas locale.  I like Stuart Whitman, a more than servicable actor in my opinion.  I'm now in my 40's and can see the holes in the movie.  I still like Stuart Whitman.  In the final analysis, this is a Saturday afternoon B movie.  The dialogue is a bit stilted between the Asian actors and the English/American actors.  The camera moves in sometimes jerky ways.  There are 3 or 4 chop-socky scenes and the camera zooms in and out in the typical way.  Martial arts fans might appreciate these scenes.  They don't serve to move the film along as far as I can see.  The special feature of the narration is very enlightening.  This should be shown to every student in a Film 101 course as a lesson in how NOT to make a film.  The comments by the original, 'first' director, Monte Hellman are interesting and telling of what it takes to get a film made when there are too many chiefs and not enough indians - or not enough of a script to shoot a feature length film.  While not in TOTAL disagreement, the comments by Stuart Whitman are a bit more upbeat and positive.  Mr. Whitman's comments address different aspects of the film and how it was made.  The comments are basically two sides of the same coin.  Mr. Whitman IS NOT in the same room with Mr. Hellman.  So, each man's 'comments' seem to sound a bit disjointed and unrelated to the other.  One view is that of the director, while another view is that of the actor.  Each person has a different role to be fulfilled.  Which is as it should be.  I just wish that a better film HAD been made.  If only for Stuart Whitman's sake.  Did I mention I like the guy?",1211155200,,1685,4.262658227848101
7881235,3,6304960689,"If you are looking for a prime example of a film that's surprisingly decent in spite of itself, this is it! I've heard all the negative comments regarding ""Shatter"", from the low budget to the casting of Stuart Whitman. The low budget does show at times, but this film still has a better look than many of the martial arts opuses of the 70's. Whitman has had a history of these kind of tough guy roles, usually in westerns like ""The Commancheros"" and ""Rio Conchos"", and does solid work here. And Cushing and Anton Diffring add the expected Hammer polish to the works. The action scenes move at a nice clip, which cannot be said for many films of the era. This is not ""Enter The Dragon"", but it's better than some of the others.",1104019200,4,727,4.392592592592592
7881236,2,6304960689,"Back in the 70's, England's Hammer Studios contracted with the famous Shaw Brothers to produce a few movies in Hong Kong.  Only two ever came from the union, this tepid movie and the much better Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires (1979).  I think the idea behind this movie was to combine the action of kung fu, whose popularity was in full swing thanks to Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon (1973) and the grittiness of Mario Puzo's The Godfather (1972).  This hybrid fell short of this lofty goal.  Actually, it didn't even come close to the mark, as this movie really sucked rotten eggs.  I hesitate to mention this movie with those two, truly wonderful achievements in cinema history, but I wanted to give you an idea of what you're in for here.

Craggy faced actor Stuart Whitman, probably best known for his television work from the early 50's through the 70's, stars as Shatter, a hit man contracted to kill an African dictator.  He completes his assignment, returns to Hong Kong to collect his fee, only to discover the double cross is on and finds himself in the position of being a marked man.  It turns out he was hired through his normal channels, but only by someone who intended on using Shatter as a patsy, and now he is wanted by various governments and mafias.  As Shatter tries to sort out the mess, he meets a master martial artist Tai Pah (Lung Ti).  Shatter makes a deal with Tai Pah, promising him half the money he intends to collect for his services render if martial artist will help keep Shatter alive long enough to get the money.  This offers the showing of much martial artistry, and while interesting; it didn't really seem to be on par with some of the other Shaw Brothers' releases.

I do give credit where credit is due, as the plot, while fairly complicated, seemed well laid out, and also, the movie did follow it pretty much all the way until the end.  Also, as the film was shot on location in Hong Kong, providing a sense of claustrophobia while in the city, but also giving some really beautiful views in and around Hong Kong.  The biggest problem, in my opinion, with the movie was that it was just boring more often than not.  The action would pick up, and then die out, making for a sense of herky jerkiness (stop, start, stop, start) kind of like driving a car with new brakes.  While Stuart Whitman was a serviceable actor, I felt nothing for the character, cared not if he lived or died.  The star power in this movie comes from veteran actor Peter Cushing and Anton Diffring, Fahrenheit 451 (1966) and Circus of Horrors (1960), although neither actor appears for any great length of time in this film, but fans of Cushing might find interest here if they're looking to complete a collection.

I commend Anchor Bay on their release, as the movie looks really good in this wide screen format, and there are even some real extras, like a commentary track, a trailer, and a couple of TV spots.  There is also a featurette about various Hammer releases, which I've seen included on other Anchor Bay releases of Hammer films.  Even with the extras, the best I could give this film would be 2  stars, as it was just a difficult and uninteresting release to sit through.  Oh yeah, listen for Shatter's own personal theme music, in that 'wak ki cha' style of the 70's.  Nowhere near as entertaining as John Shaft's theme music, but somewhat interesting.

7881237,4,6304960689,"The print is excellent but what makes this DVD worth purchasing is the audio commentary. The uncredited director Monte Hellman offers some insight into the trouble bound production. Stuart Whitman's commentary is recorded in a hotel room and is not as clear as I would have liked,though his stories are fascinating.",1025481600,4,315,5.196078431372549
7881238,1,6304960689,"In the early 1970's Hammer films saw their movies slipping, they tried new angles like adding more gore and nudity, but were still falling behind. They decided to join together with Shaw Brothers to make two joint productions that would combine the martial arts elements that Shaw Brothers used with some british actors and some of the elements Hammer was known for. The first result was Legend of the seven golden vampires or the Seven brothers meet Dracula as it called in the states once it was released several years after it was made. That film had it's share of good points and it's share of the bad, which is more than I can say for the second collaberation.
  I wasn't expecting Enter the Dragon, but I thought it would have some decent action and maybe a fair spy - drama type plot because Hammer had put out some decent thrillers in the sixties. The plot is like a third rate 70's cop show, guys with lots of guns and very little charater or sense. The fight scenes are not of the terribly phoney variety, but just pretty lame and unspectacular with the sole exception being the final fight scene. It says something when you cannot make a tournament with fighters of varied styles the least bit interesting.
  Stuart Whitman is really quite bad, maybe not at first, but he gets old quick. Anton Diffring and Petet Cushing have small roles, but they make the best of them. The sets and scenery are good and as usual, Anchor Bay did a good job of releasing a very sharp looking product. This film is actually qite hard to watch in one sitting because it just tends to drone on and on. The one star is largely for Cushing and Diffring.",977097600,2,1642,4.481605351170568
7881239,2,6304960689,"Hammer studios known by most for their gripping horror films, produced this drama ""Shatter"". The only horror in Shatter is Stuart Whitman's acting. Shatter (Whitman) is a hitman whose government turns on  him, framing him for a murder they put him up to. Mayhem and martial arts  ensue. Lots of nice scenery, action, and a special appearance by Peter  Cushing in his last Hammer film. Once you view this film you will  understand why Whitman was cursed to play baddies in 70's television cop  shows....who loves ya baby?",957484800,3,520,4.863636363636363
