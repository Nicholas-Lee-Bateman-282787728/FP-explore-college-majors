8739835,5,B017NBP56C,"An energetic contemporary tour of APIs' food, culture, and action.  This film premiered at the 2015 CAAM Fest, largest Asian & Pacific Islander film festival in the county in San Francisco.  I attended the 2015 CAAM Fest but I missed this premiere at the Castro Theatre because I was watching a 3.5 hour Japanese film called 0.5 mm at another CAAM Fest venue in Japan town.  I just watched this film on DVD and I really enjoyed it.  The Director, Writer, and Narrator, Grace Lee has a certain edge and attitude, in a good sense, and takes her audience on a broad section of API food, culture and life from Texas to NYC, to Wisconsin to Hawaii.  With some interesting insight on how the younger Asian & Pacific Americans are creating their own ""Masala"" and Vibe while retaining their own ancestry.  I highly recommend this film!",1461974400,,827,4.63013698630137
