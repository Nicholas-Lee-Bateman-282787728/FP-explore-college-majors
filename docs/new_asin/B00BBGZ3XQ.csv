8565381,3,B00BBGZ3XQ,This is a good movie.  I don't think too many people know about it.  Susan Blakely plays a factory worker  And she gets fed up with the inequality of the men and women in the  work place.  The men get paid for playing football and the women have to work harder to pick up the slack.  So she and other women at the factory start their own football team.  Eddie Albert plays the coach.  And it reminds me of the role he had in The Longest Yard.,1513123200,,442,4.0

8565383,5,B00BBGZ3XQ,"I was glad they came out with this movie on DVD I saw this movie when it was shown on TV back in the eighties I believe and had it taped on VHS. I have it now and watched it today and I'll probably watch it several times over. This was a great movie and if you like Waylon Jennings you'll like it even more. I felt the acting was great and I liked the actors, it was a cute movie for everyone to watch.",1372032000,,402,3.7411764705882353
8565384,5,B00BBGZ3XQ,"SUSAN BLAKELY stars in this film (not Ronee - as mismarked) which is close in story to ""Norma Rae"" which is not a bad story line for television. It's a totally entertaining film with a solid cast.",1366588800,,196,4.324324324324325
