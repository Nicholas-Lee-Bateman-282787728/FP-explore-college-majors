5045963,2,B00701EK8U,Video stopped and i was unable to show it to my students.  Other than that the video was ok and educational.,1395792000,,108,4.142857142857143
5045964,3,B00701EK8U,Would have liked to see the airports and more of small towns and the people.  Wasn't interested in the churches and other old buildings.,1394064000,,136,4.666666666666667
5045965,5,B00701EK8U,Having been researching a move for several years this book provides some very good information for someone else also considering a move and desiring additional information on Cuenca.,1385251200,,182,5.535714285714286
5045966,4,B00701EK8U,This film is a well rounded overview of Ecuador's major cities. Narration is done fairly well and you walk away feeling like you learned valuable information about the country.,1374710400,2,176,5.103448275862069
5045967,2,B00701EK8U,"It is a political polemic not a travel information book.
You need to speak Spanish and French (which I do) to get the point well. This should be explained before one buys it",1360368000,2,173,4.2727272727272725
5045968,5,B00701EK8U,"I'm considering travel to South America and have viewed several relevant videos lately.  This is the best of what I've seen, both in terms of the places covered and the quality of the production.  This is also the first thing of any consequence I've look at about Ecuador and I am completely blown away!!  This looks like some of the best colonial architecture anywhere I've been and the lack of crowds is interesting, too.  Now I can't wait to plan my trip and Ecuador is sure to be on the list!",1357430400,3,496,4.417582417582418
5045969,3,B00701EK8U,"Interesting and informative . However , the narrator knew nothing about Spanish and butchered the pronunciation of many of the places and many other words too . How hard would it be to investigate these BEFORE producing the video or just get a bilingual narrator ? I still enjoyed it but there were so many words pronounced wrong that it was irritating .",1348358400,5,354,4.634920634920635
8507493,4,B00701EK8U,It was good,1461283200,,11,3.0
8507494,2,B00701EK8U,the narrator mispronounced the names of the places.  When you grew up there that is disgusting,1458000000,,94,4.875
8507495,1,B00701EK8U,"Boring, focused mostly on architecture and monuments.  Not much on nature or culture.",1457308800,,85,5.538461538461538
8507496,5,B00701EK8U,Wonderful photography and narrative,1449014400,,35,8.0
8507497,4,B00701EK8U,The video started in the capital. It was not flattering. Then it got better. My opinion. There is much more to see there.,1446249600,,121,4.304347826086956
8507498,2,B00701EK8U,"Don't bother.  If you have considered spending time in Ecuador for more than 5 minutes, you probably already know more than you will learn from this book.",1445904000,,154,4.703703703703703
8507499,5,B00701EK8U,"Aside from the consistently mispronounced words, this was an interesting and informative travelogue. A little dated.",1442102400,,116,6.3125
8507500,4,B00701EK8U,No in depth info.,1430352000,,17,3.5
8507501,5,B00701EK8U,Nice coverage of Ecuador. Hoping to afford the trip to go visit and see it for myself.,1410566400,,86,4.117647058823529
8507502,4,B00701EK8U,"This was an okay video, just covered most of the tourist spots along the pan-american highway. Video was concise and clear, ran with no issues.",1400371200,,143,4.76
