In the late 60's and early 70's, the only foreign cars you were likely to see on America's highways were German, British, or Italian sports cars.  The Japanese cars of the time were boxy, underpowered and really unsafe to drive on our interstates.

Yutaka Katayama or as he is affectionately known, ""Mr. K"" was sent to the US to head up their Nissan sales program.  They were so sure it would fail that they used the name Datsun in the US to protect the Nissan name.

After some rough starts, they finally started making some headway with their Datsun 1200 and 510 sedans.  Mr. K was continually giving them feedback on what would sell in the American market and one thing that impressed him was the number of British sports cars he was seeing.  That led to the boxy little 1500 then 2000 convertible that was a copy of the MGB of the period.  I test drove a 2000 once and it was a great little car compared to my friends TR-4.

Nissan had proposed a two seat coupe in the early 60's but shelved the project.  Mr. K convinced them to bring it back into development and by 1969, the 240Z was born.  The car had a lot of influence from other cars including the Ferrari GT250 and the Jaguar e-type, both cars costing much more than the Z.

The car was an instant hit.  They couldn't build them fast enough and it was common to order one and wait six months for it to arrive.  I ordered my car in October 1972 and it arrived on March 16, 1973.  I paid a whopping $4,144.77 for it at the time.

The Z car program made it possible for Nissan to decimate the British sports car market and the 240Z dominated racing at the time.  Not bad for a little 6 cylinder OHC 2.4 liter dual carb engine with a 4 speed manual gearbox!

The model eventually morphed into the 260Z in 1974 which was the last of the carburetted cars then the 280Z with fuel injection was introduced in 1975.  The car kept getting more refined and became less of a sports car and more of a grand tourer.  The last of the pure Z cars ended with the introduction of the 300ZX which was a totally different car with a V-6 engine and comparable to most American cars.

This is a great documentary of the Z car and Nissan in general.  It would make a great gift for a Z car owner.",1388275200,,2349,4.208053691275167

7904766,5,B000006QTQ,"I caught this episode of Automobiles on the History Channel when it was new, and when I found it at Amazon.com I had to have it.  A must have for the Z enthusiast.  This video Chronicles the life of the world's best  selling sports car, the Z series from Nissan.  Lots of footage of all the  years of Z cars, except for the 84-89 300zx, they only barely touch on  them, but otherwise very informative and interesting video.  I recommend it  to anyone, not just Z enthusiasts.",938217600,19,475,4.379310344827586
