 If society suddenly collapsed, regardless of the scenario or reasons behind it, how would you get home?  How would you get your family to safety?  Would you have the necessary knowhow, supplies, and training to keep you and your loved ones safe from harm?  With his new DVD, Surviving Civil Unrest, Chance Sander's makes sure you will be able to answer in the affirmative to all those questions and much more.
 A veteran of the US Marine Corps, educator of urban survival, and writer for various magazines, Sander's has taken it upon himself to hone his years of real world experience into an instructional video that is both informative and entertaining.  This is quality training, presented in realistic environments.  Unlike books that give you a wall of text to muddle through, Surviving Civil Unrest takes you up close and personal, allowing the viewer to actually see what it would take to prepare, survive, and even thrive.
 Chance is a great instructor, giving clear and concise direction, making it easy for both novice and seasoned preppers alike to learn from him.  The videography is such that it seems like you are right there, getting a personal lesson.  This is a must when dealing with subjects such as safety during riots and natural disasters.
 If you are looking for a learning experience from someone that cares not about the money, but about protecting you and yours come hell or high water, let Chance Sanders be your guide.  You'll be glad you did.",1385337600,,1607,5.018867924528302
5737637,5,B00CSALNX8,"I got this video to learn more about surviving in an urban environment.  Chance Sanders does a good job showing and telling you what things you need to do in order to survive after civil unrest.  This is not an end all survival video.  This is just the beginning.  Overall, I think Chance does a good job and the video is worth the money.",1382486400,,338,4.234375
5737638,2,B00CSALNX8,This movie had such potential. The subject mater is most important. However it was all over the place.  I am sorry Chance. Great idea but poorly executed  I don't know if there where budget constraints or a poor director. It just missed.  I did however get something out of it. For those who are smart enough to even look for such a movie might want to pick it up regardless. There aren't to many around well none that I have found.  I am disappointed in the production not the subject matter and information. Thanks for the effort Chance.  Maybe a remake???  Be well.,1377129600,6,568,4.466019417475728
5737639,5,B00CSALNX8,"I got a chance to meet up with Chance(lol)at the 2013 Blade show in Atlanta and came home with this DVD. Has alot of infomation in it and begs for other volumes(HINT HINT).I have been a US Army Infantryman for 15+ years and have been to a few places. This DVD sure would have made life better at times. I highly recommend this DVD to any and everyone. BTW He has a knife design out NOW with Mission Knives.

8585718,2,B00CSALNX8,"Not completly awful, but highly disappointing. This film topic had great potential and it was just poorly executed. Disjointed and haphazardly put together or perhaps over edited?  It's a bit of a mess. This might have flowed well had the makers filmed Chance moving from point A and Chance actually navigating to point B and then C while actually performing survival tasks instead of talking about what you might do. His dialog or script relies heavily on the viewers imagination. The 1 hour film comes across more like 3 separate scenes hurriedly filmed over an afternoon and then strung together to give the appearance of having actually completed a long mission.  It was quite uninteresting to anyone beyond a first timer with nothing to compare this to. As an example the medical expert was thrown in out of nowhere, he rambled on about NBC injuries and then removed suddenly as he appeared.  It was an odd touch. Same with the blurred out ""Contractor"" with random advice and personal experiences peppered throughout the film that didn't have much to do with what Chance was doing.",1457568000,,1086,4.891304347826087
8585719,2,B00CSALNX8,Way overpriced for what you get.,1423008000,,32,4.5
8585720,2,B00CSALNX8,"Chance is a smart guy, knows his survival stuff. Survival skills and movie making do not go hand in hand, as demonstrated by this DVD. Its short, (especially for the price), some of the suggestions are sloppy and things I wouldn't expect from someone as well regarded as Chance, especially when it comes to the way he handled his pistol (using his back pocket as a holster, sleeping with the gun in his hand) and a lot of the information is reasonably common knowledge among the survival community. For me, this is a great idea poorly executed.",1420588800,,544,4.618556701030927
8585721,5,B00CSALNX8,"Anyone interested in learning the skills to prepare for any bad situation in the city-this video is for you! Chance is a skilled and knowledgeable survivalist. His experience and training are solid as well as having a very clear method of instruction.

This video goes over techniques, principles, gear selection, and some skills you may have not thought about. This DVD will aid you in getting yourself/family out of a bad situation. The video is not only informational it is also very entertaining. Theres not many places you can find this level of instruction for this price. Typically your paying $700-1200 for this information in a class room setting.

Highly suggest this video.",1416096000,,684,5.04424778761062
8585722,2,B00CSALNX8,Commmon sense instruction. Didnt learn anything i didn't already know. Overpriced for the quality and content of the instruction.,1410048000,,129,5.842105263157895
8585723,4,B00CSALNX8,Great DVD for anyone interested in urban survival escape and evasion.  It's good for someone who already has some survival and preparedness training. Helps fine tune those ideas and skills. Looking forward to another DVD from Chance real soon.,1406592000,,243,5.230769230769231
8585724,2,B00CSALNX8,"This video isn't bad, but it isn't great either.  For $45, this video should have given me at least a couple moments where I found the content extremely insightful, but it didn't.  Most of the material is fairly sound, and well presented, though there are a few questionable moments that could have been better thought-out advice (e.g. he says to get a waterproof Tyvek topo map but I have found no places that produce these other than for specialty areas like national parks; he sets up camp for the night inside an urban ""cave"" under a bridge with only one way in and out and thus no way to escape danger should it enter, etc.).  If this was $20 I would tell you it's worth it to watch, and pass on to a friend, but at $45 you could probably take an all-day course at REI that would furnish you with more knowledge.",1404777600,,817,4.326797385620915
8585725,3,B00CSALNX8,"Good/OK, but way overpriced! It came highly recommended by someone we respect so we bought it!  Many were raving about this video and we just thought it would be much different, so maybe that's on us. Still good for new brand new preppers or someone that knows nothing...we will keep it to share with others.",1397692800,,308,4.6
8585726,1,B00CSALNX8,"I expected to learn something new, but did not.  I wish he would have covered more information then the general information available everywhere.",1395360000,,145,5.304347826086956
8585727,5,B00CSALNX8,"What a great DVD!  Well done.  I love that it is scenario driven. If you're looking for a well laid out DVD on Survival for civil unrest, this is worth the investment in my opinion!",1391212800,,181,4.142857142857143
