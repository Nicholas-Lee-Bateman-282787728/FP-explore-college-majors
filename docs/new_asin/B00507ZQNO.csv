4513524,5,B00507ZQNO,This is a eautiful representation of Turandot.  Excellent fidelity as well as color.  Have enjoyed it many times since purchase.,1364774400,2,128,5.35
4513525,5,B00507ZQNO,"I call this Zifferellis Turandot as apart from the excellent singing by all concerned the opulent and magnificent sets and staging made this opera a joy to watch. Perhaps the sets somehow had an effect upon the singers and dancers as everyone who participated rose to the occasion. When my wife and I watched this opera it was a cold winters day here in Johannesburg ,South Africa,and with our log fire and a glass of red wine in hand ,somehow ,everything about the opera seemed very special. A definite buy for any opera lover's collection.",1363651200,6,541,4.705263157894737
4513526,5,B00507ZQNO,Great Met Opera production with Zefferelli sets and excellent cast. Had the pleasure to see it live at the Met and it's great to be able to view again and again.,1362268800,,161,4.225806451612903
4513527,5,B00507ZQNO,"This was a performance I had seen in HD at the movies.  I had also seen live performances of this production of Turandot at the Met.  Because of the Zefferelli staging, this is one of the most opulent and exciting productions extant.",1360108800,,233,4.523809523809524
4513528,5,B00507ZQNO,I saw this production at the simulcast three ago and it took my breathe away. I particularly love the two principals and the sets are exquisite. I chose this particular performance of this opera for those two reasons and am very glad to have added this to my collection.  I would and do recommend this performance.,1356134400,,314,4.607142857142857
4513529,5,B00507ZQNO,"I loved it when PBS played this on tv, and I wanted to own Turandot on DVD, but I could only find it on Amazon. I saw there was an older version of the opera, but this was the one I really wanted (since I saw 2010-2011ish production on tv). I love every second of this opera. Thank you, Amazon, for selling one of my favorite operas!",1350345600,7,333,3.985074626865672
4513530,2,B00507ZQNO,"As the other reviewers have noted, this is a dazzling production of a brilliant musical score, but if your lead is not up to snuff, why bother. Much praise has been given to Maria G., the lead, but I found her singing mediocre and her pronunciation non-existent. The other soprano who sang 4 performances at the Metropolitan Opera House at the same time was Lise Lindstrom and she is magnificent as Turandot, vastly superior to Maria G.
If you must get this production, you are better off buying the original one with Placido Domingo and Eva Marton. It may not be in HD, it may have a a few glitches here and there with the singing, but it is totally superior to this particular version. Sorry Maria G., learn how to enunciate.",1328400000,9,727,4.515151515151516
4513531,5,B00507ZQNO,"No human endeavor is ""perfect"", this one included, and probably best, actually, that nothing here in this life is ""perfect"".  (""So we all love the crooked straightness of a good walking stick.""  --Robert Frost)  So let me dispense with the negatives first:  Is this Zeffirelli production ""over-the-top""?  No, not at all:  It would have to be toned down quite a bit in order to be accurately labeled that.  One excruciating example:  There are gymnasts doing Floor-X tumbling runs across the front of the stage at the beginning of Act I.  (I kid you not.)  Then at the very end of Act III, to my mind this scene BEGS to be presented as a grand tableau, a la the finale of ""The Firebird"" in the Fokine choreography, but instead we have here a lot of fussing-about with a lot of fan-waving.  (""Fan-waving"" would be a good subtitle for this production, in fact.)  And the thing is, the conducting of Andris Nelsons is so breathtakingly magnificent (see below) that the music itself easily can carry the day and needs no ""help"" from the designer/director.  'Tis a pity.  Samuel Ramey's developing wobble:  Yes, it's there, but it does no permanent damage.  The edge-of-harshness in Maria Guleghina's voice:  It's there, too, but you know what, I wouldn't change it a bit, not a bit.  Lastly for negatives, this is claimed to be filmed in HD, but it does not look like HD to me.  Maybe I am wrong, of course, but that is my take on it.

Now the positives that make this performance ""fabulous"":  Andris Nelsons, the conductor (making his Met debut):  Amazing, utterly amazing.  I said in reviewing his ""Boheme"" dvd that he is the greatest conductor of Puccini that I have ever heard, and I am standing by that assessment here.  What a way with this music!  One of the great joys of grand opera is, of course, the goose-bump moments, and he delivers them here in force.  He has a glorious feel for tempos, for climaxes, and for phrasing.  And you can tell that he is highly sympathetic to his singers, never forcing things.  You really have to buy this DVD for the conducting alone--again, I kid you not.  This Nelsons is magnificent, unquestionably, and I look forward to hearing a lot more from him.  Back to Guleghina (Turandot):  She has a rough-edged voice (here, at least) of high-tension steel, absolutely stunning for this role.  Plus, SHE CAN ACT.  (It's such an interesting contrast between her persuasive and understated acting and the character of the over-all production.)  I love her in this, as she is.  Marcello Giordani as Calaf:  Here his voice is one of steel as well, but coated with burnished copper.  Even before ""Nessun dorma"" in Act III he has already conquered with that great voice.  I wouldn't change a thing about him either, despite the fact he is not a Jonas Kaufmann among tenors when it comes to acting.  Plenty of goose bumps from both him and Guleghina.  Marina Poplavskaya as Liu:  Not steely like Guleghina, but Liu is not a steely-voiced role and she conquers in it.  She has a voice of great purity and smoothness and beauty and is a queen of the legato line.  She holds a candle to no one is this role.  The Met chorus sings beautifully throughout and the Met orchestra shines.  Well, let's face it:  Nelsons is an inspirational leader.

Of Puccini's operas, this is my favorite, and it is done fabulously here, as said in the headline.  Even if you are no big Puccini fan, but love great opera, do pay the ticket price for this DVD.  It is thrilling.",1321920000,27,3482,4.6202945990180035
4513532,5,B00507ZQNO,Can't say enough about this DVD. The MET is always great - but they outdid themselves on this production. Franco Zeffirelli is a great producer with an eye for detail. Best money you will spend on Opera DVD's.,1319241600,9,209,4.526315789473684
4513533,5,B00507ZQNO,"Saturday, November 7, 2009, was one of the most singularly memorable days of my life, a high that I still haven't completely come down from. That day, after years of talking about it, four friends and I went from our digs in the Wilds of South Jersey to go to NYC and see a live performance at the Met for the first time, and it was this particular performance of Turandot,the day it was telecast live. The performance itself was outstanding. Guleghina was actually in better voice here than she was at a park performance of the same opera about 10 years ago, back when there still were such things. No Turandot other than Nilsson could really make you get inside this woman's head. Giordani, vocally and in stage prescence, was very possibly the most perfect Calaf since Corelli. All the other performances were on the same level, with Ramey only just beginning to suffer from the severe vocal wobble that would become painfully evident in the ""Rondine"" telecast (and video) of just a couple months later.

But, as I said earlier, for us, the performance was just a part of a glorious whole. With the whole Lincoln Center/Broadway/NYC ambience, followed up by an expensive (but worth every blessed penny) dinner at Jean Georges, we felt like a collective Cinderella at the Ball, swells for a day, riding on a magnificent high until the coach turned back into a pumpkin, and the horses into white mice, at 9:00 AM, Monday morning. But, like Cinderella, we had a ball, a high that defies comparison. We've made it an annual tradition since, and we're going back to see Netrebko in ""Anna Bolena"" this coming fall, and it'll be fun, as always. But that first time was so special, simply because it WAS the first time. And every time I watch, it will be like living it all over again.

Incidentally, when the camera pans to the audience in the auditorium itself, you'll be able to see us, way in the back. Our simultaneous TV debut and farewell. Please remember to wave.",1307836800,15,1966,4.630372492836676

8450855,4,B00507ZQNO,"The dark but highly populated opening set is pretty impressive, the run down boarded area with the hint of a village in the background is a good scene setter.
Calaf is sung by Marcello Giordani who proves to be a pretty ordinary tenor.
Timur is just about sung by Samuel Ramey who must have been given the part as a long service award. His wavery voice is only a shadow of his brilliant earlier years.
Marina Poplavskaya is her usual brilliant voiced self. She makes the earlier acts far more bearable.
Joshua Hopkins, Tony Stevenson and Eduardo Valdes are a great triple act as Ping, Pang and Pong, not necessarily in that order. There voices individually and in trio are excellent.
The second set is a sort of hideout for the three ministers, a terrace with a summerhouse behind them.
Set three is a brightly lit open area with raised walkways, the Emperor is enthroned at the back, sung by Charles Anthony with a complete lack of conviction.
Our anti heroine, Turandot is nicely portrayed by Maria Guhlegina, unlike some portrayals she does not belt the whole of her arias out at full voice.
The costumes throughout are very good, generally in keeping with what I would expect, exotic and colourfull.
The orchestra and chorus are well balanced.
There are better productions available, but most have some imperfections with avant garde sets or over forceful Turandots, My favourite is the Mehta version from The Forbidden City of Beijing.
Incidentally Liu always attracts a good or better artiste for the role.",1475971200,,1512,4.819230769230769
8450856,4,B00507ZQNO,Good operatic voice. The costumes and manners are accurate as in Chinese culture. Though the answers could have been much better than composed.,1475798400,,143,5.260869565217392
8450857,2,B00507ZQNO,"I wish I did not have to write such a poor review of this Mets production of Turandot.  First the positives.  Franco Z, his set design for this production, as usual, is fabulous.  The orchestral music was also excellent, as were the supporting actors.  The principal singers/actors, unfortunately, leave something to be desired.  For me to enjoy opera I have to identify with the principal actors.  Maria G. and Marcello G. just didn't rate.  They are both middle aged, overweight, and there singing for me was less than average.  As far as Maria G. is concerned, I found myself thinking why would I risk my life for a plane looking, overweight princess?  In her case I would gladly have taken the maids!  Marcello G. had difficulty hitting the low notes.  This was especially telling in the third act singing Nessun dorma-- the signature aria.  He really had to reach, and his pause during the piece was noticeably obvious.  Oh, and by the way Met staff, I thought this story took place in Peking, China and Turandot, the princess, was Chinese?  So why did she look so European in this production?  Am I missing something or was she simply adopted by the Chinese Emperor?  Now to Samuel R.  It was ok that he looked old.  Certainly believable, but did he have to be so old?  At least He looked Chinese.  Unfortunately, his voice was weak and he was unable to project it at all.  Perhaps opera singers are like athletes and should retire earlier, before most of them do.  I know Samuel R. has had a long run at the Met, but I think production quality is more important than seniority.  Now to technical details.  Sometimes the audio quality left something to be desired.  Specifically, the principal singers sounded distant.  Now I know that this technical detail can be easily solved.  At least they are able to do so at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England.  The Conference Center in Salt Lake City, Utah does an outstanding job too.  You know, principal actor/singers can wear these hardly noticable little headsets enabling the engineers to amplify and adjust their voice quality separately.  Perhaps, the Met is trying to stay with some tradition but this is the 21st century.  Finally, and this may be hitting below the belt, but Tom C. did a better job with Turandot in the latest Mission Impossible Movie than the Met did with this production!  I can tell you this before I purchase more of the Mets productions on DVD they must improve their production quality considerably.  Finally, this review may seem like it is hitting below the belt, but if I'm going to spend good hard earned money on opera/ musical DVDs then I want the best quality money can buy.",1464998400,3,2669,4.670967741935484
