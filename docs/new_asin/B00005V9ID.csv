1672883,5,B00005V9ID,"That's right, everyone.  I know that all of you out there thought that Chad McQueen was this planet's greatest actor, but he's got a challanger.  It's burnout basketcase Gary Busey's son, Jake.  He enthralled audiances on TV's across this nation in this should-be smash.  Of course, the only ones with enough integrity not to attempt to keep loose cannon Jake Busey down were the powers that be at video stores.  I guess that a cross bow weilding, tin foil jacket donning, bleached blonde cowboy was not good enough for the big screen.  Well, frankly, I am disgusted once again by the American film industry.  If men of sight and wisdom were running the show, Fast Sofa would have been the Oscar winner for Best Picture, and Jake Busey would have responded to the outstreached hand of the presenter of the Best Actor Oscar with a jerking away of his accemptance handshake, pretending to brush his flowing bleached locks behind his bloodshot ear, and yell ""WHOO! PSYCH!""  Now I ask you, does it get any better than that?  If you're not convinced, then you must be El Diablo, or live in Belmar.  Anyway, I give Fast Sofa 5 cans, and nominate it, and Jake Busey, for Manwich Awards in 2003.  As ever, this is Art Vandelay signing off, and remember kids, if it isn't B, it isn't me.",1018224000,10,1278,4.58590308370044

7956172,5,B00005V9ID,"I like the lighting, the acting, whaky wild buddy road trip movie set in California, not for everyone but i loved it",1360022400,,116,4.318181818181818
7956173,3,B00005V9ID,"OK, so when I first reviewed this movie, I was less than generous.  I really hated this movie, but I have to admit, it actually started to grow on me.  So rather than beat the hell out of it, I'm revisiting it and I'm going to give it another look, for better and for worse.

So a quick synopsis of the plot:  the film is revolves around Rick, a stereotypical Californian dude who loves beer, fast cars, porn, and having fun.  Despite having a cute girlfriend who tolerates his careless and insensitive ways, Rick hooks up with a porn star, a decision which triggers what becomes a spiritual journey of pain and loss.  Along the way Rick receives a few lumps, but more importantly, he discovers that life is much more brutal and heartbreaking seen up close instead of through a television screen.

This brutality dominates the theme of the film.  Rick's driving motivator is his desire to fulfill his sexual fantasies with the porn star Ginger, a relationship which begins as a random encounter and becomes an obsession of sorts.  It's a dream come true for Rick who can't believe his good luck, but in short time he finds out that behind the innocent, super-sexualized Ginger is something more.  Porn, like any other form of media, is a form of delusion, created for the purposes of easy entertainment, and Ginger is just the facade of that illusion.  In reality, she is a hollow person who isn't very interesting or smart, reliant on drugs and alcohol to fulfill her emotions and who is abused by her husband.  As this terrible truth hits Rick, he experiences a catharsis that indeed, the truth is not very pleasant.

The characters in the film are all pretty interesting.  Rick is absolutely repulsive, a fact that turned me off of this film at first, but one that is actually pretty important.  He's just such a selfish bonehead you want to see bad things happen to him, and many do.  Ginger is likewise repulsive, but her sensual and easy nature make her fascinating to watch (played by Jennifer Tilly, you can't lose), as well as the path she takes in the film.  Lastly is Jules, a lame figure who doesn't know how to fit into normal society.  There are also a number of great side characters, all of whom add flavor and life to the film.

So, the downsides to this film.  Well, Rick is a problem.  While it isn't mandatory to like the main character, he's so revolting that it is an issue.  You just want to smack the hell out him at times.  His irresponsibility goes beyond acceptable, and honestly, he's not very charismatic.  Now besides this obstacle is also the heavy handedness of the film as a whole.  It gets oppressive at times, and the cathartic moment between Rick and Ginger towards the end of the movie sputters for the next 15 minutes, as if the movie doesn't know what to do next.  So instead of a sensible ending, they thrown a bunch of stuff together and call it a day.  It seems to be a common problem with movies.  Great start, and then they just don't know where to go with it.  I also think that there is too much symbolism in the film which muddies things up a bit, and some really annoying editing techniques to boot.

Despite these flaws, the film gives us an interesting story, some memorable characters, and it moves at a good pace.  It never slows down or becomes too inarticulate, and it only starts to fail you in the last minutes, so I guess that's not too bad.  So for a cheap little Indie film, this deserves some credit and is well worth your time.",1264377600,,3488,4.496025437201908
7956174,1,B00005V9ID,"My husband and I are Crispin fans, to a degree that we try to watch whatever work of his we can find. This movie may have changed that ideology, as this film is painfully bad. And by painfully bad, I have to note that it is NOT bad in the way that one can sit back and enjoy how thoroughly awful a film is, like one would with Ro-Man the Robot Monster or  Pitch Black which is horrendously-achingly-funnily bad, no this film is BAD. Disappointing. BAD.",1214179200,,452,4.255813953488372
7956175,5,B00005V9ID,"One of the best, well written screen plays I have seen. Interesting, thought  provoking movie. Fine performances by all actors.",1196985600,,127,5.35
7956176,2,B00005V9ID,"This movie is so strange I , don't feel as if I could explain it at all. I guess you could say it's just one of those movies you have to see for yourself? I thought Jake Busey was really good in this and his acting was amazing, but the movie just had no plot. I honestly felt uncomfortable watching this. It has way to many porn scenes, and some very gross humor. Crispin Glover stole the show, he was awesome in this movie ,but I don't know if he could save it from being trash on film. There is also a very neat little cameo by the legendary punk band Fear which is really cool. All in all I gave Fast Sofa a 2 out of 5 stars and I think that was pretty nice of me............This is what you would call a pass.

PS: The way this movie ends is just plain out lame. It almost feels like they just ran out of money and stoped filming.",1188691200,,834,3.93491124260355
7956177,3,B00005V9ID,"Fast Sofa starts out very unpromisingly. An agonizingly long sequence of Jake Busey and Natasha Lyonne sexing it up intercut with shots of Jennifer Tilly as a porn star moaning in one of her videos. All of it with some mediocre rock playing over it. Talk about bad beginnings.

The first 45 minutes of Fast Sofa are filled with poorly acted scenes and seem to lack any sense of meaning or purpose. Adam Goldberg's character is almost entirely unnecessary. What saves this move right at the ""time to switch it off"" breaking point is the entrance of Crispin Glover.

With short, red, '50's styled hair, a slightly sun-burned face, a lazy eye, and a wool suit, Crispin Glover enters the picture and the whole atmosphere changes. It literally feels like a different movie. The rest of the actors step up their own game just acting alongside him.

At this point the film becomes somewhat of a ""so opposite they just click"" buddy movie, in which Jake Busey is the neanderthalish tough guy whose thoughts revolve around the female sex, and mostly around one specific member of that sex, Jennifer Tilly. Crispin Glover is the soft-spoken, introverted, biological genius who has never had sex or gotten drunk. The two actually make a very engaging pair on screen.

If the director would have cut about 30 minutes of the first 45 out, and then left out some of the Jennifer Tilly plot-line this movie would have had a chance at cult status. The plot line with Busey and Glover is intriguing and fun to watch. The audience never really knows what's going to happen next.

[...]
The DVD doesn't have any extras, but honestly I don't know what kind of extras there could be. Maybe another cut of the film that's shorter and more fun to watch?",1174003200,8,1729,4.655737704918033
7956178,4,B00005V9ID,"Jake Busey and Crispin Glover are among a cast that all take part in this wierd little movie.  Rick and Jules go on a road trip to palm springs after Rick decides to pack up and leave his old life behind.  Oh, by the way, they are complete strangers.  What an adventure, with a lot of interesting characters along the way, which makes this film just plain entertaining.  Great cinematography to boot.  Worth renting or even buying used.",1163116800,4,436,4.538461538461538
