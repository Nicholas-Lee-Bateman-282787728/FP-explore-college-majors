I first saw Ha Ji Won as the sword-wielding policewoman in the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DUELIST/dp/B001L4EFCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DUELIST</a>&nbsp;and the TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DAMO-The-Undercover-Lady-Detective/dp/B0007TO8TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DAMO: The Undercover Lady Detective</a>. Here, she couldn't be more removed from that character as the sweet and shy modern urban romantic -- a girl who lost her parents early but is being aided by a secret benefactor who she calls ""Daddy Long Legs"". (Yes, this is based on the novel which inspired many other movies, including the Fred Astaire/Leslie Caron musical).

There's hardly any of the Daddy Long Legs story. Instead it's focused on the young girl's discovery of an attractive young man and of her discovery of old emails that tell of another young woman's unrequited obsession with a young man. That mystery and the mystery of the hidden benefactor kept me engrossed.

Of course, it helped that Ji Won is more luminous than ever, melding her girl-next-door quality with a very natural beauty. She has the perfect persona for this kind of film.

The usual mugging comedy is reduced to almost nothing -- and that is very tolerable. The usual weepiness fits in by being dramatically logical and constrained. The visuals are crisp and pleasant. A very good supporting cast helps a lot.

My only big gripe is that I had to fight the impulse to tear apart the story when the big secret is revealed. By restraining myself and just allowing the story to play out without analysis, I took away only happy memories of this film.",1234828800,2,1806,5.749063670411985
