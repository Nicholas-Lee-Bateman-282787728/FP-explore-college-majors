8611367,5,B00F1BFMBU,"The following is a letter I wrote to David Pogue who stars in this show (somewhat edited to publish here as a review). I think it sums up why I gave this program a 5 star review.

Mr. Pogue was kind enough to reply and indicated that he's open to producing more shows if NOVA asks him. Write to NOVA and let them know!

----
Dear. Mr. Pogue,

My kids and I thoroughly enjoyed your NOVA productions, ""Hunting the Elements"" and the ""Making Stuff"" series. Please consider talking to NOVA about producing more science programs like this.

I am a science enthusiast who grew up on PBS shows like NOVA and National Geographic and Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Kids (and adults) today are so science illiterate due in part to the fact that science shows today are so boring. Even the new Cosmos show with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Sorry, but it's a yawner!

Most of today's science education programs are not fun or interesting to the general population. And they're not inspiring. We've lost something in the last 30 years. Science popularizers like Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye are struggling to bring it back, but they haven't found the right formula (no pun intended). I'm happy for what they're doing, but neither has the humble charm of Carl Sagan. But you do!

But there's more to a program like this than just the personality of the narrator. Kids these days have a Youtube attention span. (And for that reason, I think even the original Cosmos series, as interesting as it was to me, would fail for today's generation). It's tough to engage with today's kids (or even adults!) in a 1 or 2-hour special. Yes, there are some good science programs on Youtube, like Veritasium or It's OK to be Smart, but such programs can't go into the depth that a NOVA special can, and neither can they get access to the resources and facilities that NOVA can. It's expensive to make a program like this. The producers of this program have have put in just the right mix of in-depth instruction, animation, talking heads, and humor that has captivated my kids like no other recent science or technology programming has. For the first time ever, my son has actually retained a large portion of what he's learned from the Elements program and asks for more.

I know you are not a scientist and you are mostly a tech writer, but you really come into your own when talking about science.

I watched Hunting the Elements and we're partway through the Making Stuff shows with my children (9 and 11), and for the first time --ever -- they are genuinely interested in science programming that is beyond the length of a Youtube short feature.

I don't care if my kids grow up to be scientists. I do care that they have an appreciation for the methodology of science and the wonder of learning about nature, because that spark of wonder so important even if they're only peripherally involved with chemistry or physics or space or whatever, in their lifetimes.

I bought both Hunting the Elements and the Making Stuff series on blu-ray after we first saw it on the PBS app in our TV.

You and NOVA have a winning formula! Please talk to NOVA about starring in more science shows.",1501977600,,3143,4.5846702317290555
