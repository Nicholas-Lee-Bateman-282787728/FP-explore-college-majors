8060636,3,B0009H72XM,Very beautiful scenery captured with some interesting information interspersed. More information would be helpful. It's too slow a pace and too long for what it is. I bought it for may dad to share with the folks at his assisted living facility. He thought it was too slow.,1444262400,,273,4.708333333333333

8060638,5,B0009H72XM,This was a gift for a horse crazy five year old.  She loved it and so did her parents.  Proof positive that animated cartoon type dvd's are not the only thing that children enjoy. So glad to find this dvd.  Can always count on Amazon to find the unusual.,1359158400,,254,4.142857142857143

8060640,1,B0009H72XM,"This is like watching someone else's home movies only worse - its set to bad music.  I was hoping form some information on the ponies, the run and the town...I watched this on fast forward - and nothing was lost.",1179014400,4,212,4.3
8060641,1,B0009H72XM,"Do you like to watch other peoples home movies?  The ones that all you can hear are the inane comments of the tourists seated behind camera and wind on the microphone? than this video is for you!

If you, like me, are considering a visit to the island, and are looking for an informational / educational / documentary style DVD on Assateague because you are wondering how they got there and why they swim - this video is not for you!

This video tells you virtually nothing.  In addition to providing no information about Assateague or the ponies -  they play horribly monotonous acoustic guitar music throughout.

For $6.99, this is what I would expect.

For $24.99?

I want my money back!

8060642,5,B0009H72XM,"One of the reasons why this is such a great fim is that it contains such great footage of the wild ponies and other wildlife found along Assateague. I noticed it is filmed and directed by a native of Chincoteague Island that knows where to look for the wildlife there everyday. The wild ponies there are a unique species and the film shows how they live, their behavior and interesting social characteristics. Many different herds are shown along the island with each band of ponies and its stallion, mares and foals. The Pony Swim and auction shows how the wild ponies' population is controlled. Any person who likes ""Misty of Chincoteague"" will also love this new film. The DVD also shows really good footage of migratory birds, dolphins and other wildlife at the wildlife refuge there.",1116547200,10,788,4.801470588235294
