8253085,4,B0013UQUSW,"Ive purchased 7 of these play along DVDs and the last four at same time so each is going to have the same review and rating. I had previously rated my first purchase five stars but after reviewing each DVD and agreeing with some other reviews I feel 4 stars is more appropriate. In my opinion Hal Leonard is the best when it comes to publication of Guitar learning and TAB song books for beginners and rare that Ill consider rating anything less than 4 Stars. My guitar status is beginner with approx 14 months of player experience so my review is from that perspective. In General some great songs are on the DVD but its unlikely anyone with less than 3 years of practice will be able to just start playing many of the songs on DVDs considered in this review. The intermediate, experience player will definitely be better served than the beginner. All Im sure will agree that it would have been very helpful if the DVD had included a PDF file of the displayed tab used during the instructional videos. Also a separate track of just the guitar without additional sounds would have been nice. What is demonstrated is done well but some terminology used goes beyond most beginners. I haven't considered returning any and hope that periodic revisits will eventually result in mastering some of these songs. After viewing these DVDs Ive acquired a higher appreciation for the artist that performed the songs and it blows me away to think maybe someday. Reasonably priced so if you're a beginner don't be afraid to give one a try.",1514332800,,1525,4.630996309963099
8253086,3,B0013UQUSW,"For myself this was a waste of money. I expected separate tabs sheets of the songs, but it's just the DVD. If your at a level that you can learn songs at full speed with only seeing 2 bars at a time, then this is for you. There is no way I would be able to practice and memorize 8 songs in this fashion. If an option was given to at least download the tabs from the DVD that would have been a huge plus. I consider myself an intermediated player and this is just a frustrating way to learn songs. The DVD itself is good, but at the pace it goes and no hard copy of the tabs to practice, I found this method of learning to be useless for myself.",1455148800,,644,3.8863636363636362
8253087,4,B0013UQUSW,"I must admit, this is a bit over my head, but I'll get there.  I think the instruction and songs are great but it will take me a while to learn them.  After a very brief introduction, the instructor jumps right into playing the song.  I was left in awe, just staring at the screen.  Even slowing the video down, it was too much for me.
I will get it, but not overnight.  But that's okay. I like the challenge.  If it was easy, everyone would play.
This guy on the video is incredible.
I would not recommend this to a beginner, but if you're patient and persistent I think about anyone can catch on.  I will, it's a good goal",1393372800,,624,4.107438016528926
8253088,5,B0013UQUSW,I bought this play-along as a beginner guitar player.  The instruction is quite clear and the songs are what I wanted.,1392854400,,118,4.619047619047619
8253089,5,B0013UQUSW,"Are kidding me?  for less than the price of a lesson?  The variety on this disc is amazing! If you're an intermediate guitarist who is learning how to build solos and you know the scales but need to know how to weave them together...no better way than to learn from the best, and again, there's real variety on this disc.  The ""lessons"" aren't for beginners, you need to know how to play a little, I leaned heavily on the tab - but it's great to see the fingering and the way it's played, the way notes are bent and slid/pulled etc...way more informative than just looking at a book and listening.  The songs have different and creative (yet common) chord progressions, so you can take what you learn here and spread it around.  THE SONGS ARE BASICALLY PLAYED FULL SPEED WITH TAB AT THE BOTTOM, no slowing down and no breaks.  The lessons at the beginning of each song show the chord progressions and the scale(s) that the solos are based on (ie, it shows you the Mixolydian scale (mode), and now Cult of Personality makes sense), but after a couple minutes of that it's 0-60 into the song.  If there are a couple songs you dig on any one of these DVDs, grab it and you'll learn a lot (btw, if you also hit a few of the songs you don't dig it'll stretch you musically ;)) jam on.",1290988800,6,1279,4.304166666666666
