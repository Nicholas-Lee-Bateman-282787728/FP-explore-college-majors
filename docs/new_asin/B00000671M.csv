7903949,5,B00000671M,Wow! what a great movie. Patrick Stewart does a great job as the ghost.  It has a light hearted teenage love story.  We have seen several other versions of this story and this by far is our favorite.  It has great special effects and good story line that involves all the family characters.  Your whole faimly would enjoy this movie.,1236643200,,333,4.5
7903950,5,B00000671M,"This is a moving, tender, yet still frightening version of Wilde's classic.  Patrick Stewart shines in the role of Sir Simon, and it's so sweet to see him portraying Hamlet's father. Neve Campbell does an excellent job in the role of the empathetic and kind Virginia, who believes in and befriends Sir Simon.
Yes, Virginia, there is a Simon Canterville.
Highly recommended.",969667200,3,373,5.016129032258065
