5736440,4,B00CRWDKNS,"World Championship Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Damien Sandow vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Wade Barrett vs. Fandango vs. Jack Swagger vs. Antonio Cesaro vs. Dean Ambrose - While the WWE Title Money in The Bank match later in the night featured former WWE/World Champion ""All-Stars"", this match focused on superstars of the future that featured many stories & moments such as the tag teams of Rhodes Scholars & Real Americans working together only to eventually face off, ladders used as weapons various times such a Barrett using a piece of the ladder rung to beat on Sandow, multiple backdrops onto the ladder, Fandango's sunset flip off the top of the ladder, Dean Ambrose taking a page out of Terry Funk's playbook, the creative ways Ambrose & Swagger & Cesaro tried to grab the case, Cody Rhodes busted open, outside associates getting involved, and one partner double crossing another.  This was the action expected from this match.

Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel vs. The Miz - Miz was in control early on in the bout & even pulled out a page of Eddie Guerrero's playbook to make Paul Heyman a non-factor while Axel came back grounding Miz before both men traded momentum countering each other's signature moves & hitting some hard hitting moves such as Perfect Plex & a figure four with extra added pressure.  This was a solid contest.

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Kaitlyn - Big E. Langston was in A.J.'s corner & Layla was in Kaitlyn's while Kaitlyn was wear a brace over her elbow which A.J. targeted right away using the ringpost & stretching it with moves like the hammerlock & chicken wing while Kaityln came back with power moves like the backbreaker & a shoulderblock that turned A.J. inside out followed by the scorpion deathdrop & being shoved off the top rope onto Big E. but Kaitlyn ended up hurting her own arm which allowed A.J. to take advantage.  This has not only been the best divas storyline in recent memory but also the best matches too with this & their previous PPV encounter.

Chris Jericho vs. Ryback - Jericho gained the early momentum targeting Ryback's legs with kicks causing Ryback to keep going to the floor & stalling to break his momentum before he was able to use his power to counter Jericho's moves like the springboard dropkick & Codebreaker while knocking Jericho off the apron with such force that he flew between the announce table & hurt his ribs but Jericho kept fighting back being able to counter his attempt at Shellshock & hit a modified Codebreaker.  It's no secret that Ryback is very limited at the ring while it's no secret since Jericho returned over a year ago that he's at the level where he can ""carry a broom"" to a good match which is what he did here.

World Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Dolph Ziggler - The crowd was heavily behind Dolph here as he had the early momentum taking it to Del Rio with 10 straight elbow drops before Del Rio focused on Dolph's head with repeated kicks & dropping him head first onto the barricade while also using Dolph's momentum against him to have his head hit the ring post as they would continue to trade momentum with both men focusing on attacking each other's heads with moves such as the top rope face plant, fameasser, headbutts, DDT, death drop off the top rope, knockout kick, and Dolph catching Rio in mid-air with a dropkick.  This match was more competitive than their previous encounter last month & told a good story of Del Rio once again focusing on Dolph's head only for Dolph to fight fire with fire with the only negative I can say was the ending being disappointing but understandable knowing the other issue they were trying to showcase here.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Mark Henry - Henry dominated with his power & size such as a splash in the corner & delayed forward drop onto the outside steps as Cena's offense initially had no effect until he had to deliver two shoulderblocks to take him down but wasn't able to hit the A.A. initially but eventually was able to while Henry was able to catch Cena off the top with the W.S.S. & resorted to tactics like the low blow while Cena attempted to go for the submission with the STF on more than one occasions.  This was the stereotypical Cena match where he fought a ""giant"" of superior size & strength but didn't give up while I'll give Henry credit in that he gave Cena a better match than I've seen with other bigger men like Great Khali & Big Show as he played his story going into the match well as far as resorting to anything & not easily going down to win the WWE Title.

WWE Championship Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Randy Orton vs. C.M. Punk vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus vs. Christian vs. Rob Van Dam - This match was subtitled ""All-Stars"" with everyone in the match being former WWE/World Champions with each one having experience in Ladder Matches including a few past M.I.T.B. winners which told multiple stories such as the participants teaming up to take out who they felt were the biggest threats right off the bat, the face off between Punk & Bryan, RVD's dominance such as the Rolling Thunder on a ladder, Christian finding Hornswoggle's ladder, Sheamus' crash & burn fall, all 6 men on 2 ladders at the same time (as seen on the DVD cover), Sheamus hanging from the case, the return of the 5 Star Frog Splash...from the top of a ladder, Daniel Bryan having a moment of dominance, Sheamus breaking the ladder in half, a mid-air RKO, and the appearance of C.M. Punk's ""associates.""  This was no different than the previous Money In The Bank match earlier in the night that you got all the action that you would expect from this match with multiple men telling multiple stories but I have to give extra credit to the M.V.P. of the match being Sheamus as he took the biggest & hardest bumps throughout the match.

As usual with this PPV, the ladder matches delivered while the undercard didn't have a bad match on it so it's one of the most solid events from this year so I would recommend checking out.",1375056000,2,5987,4.583177570093458
5736441,4,B00CRWDKNS,"WWE's ""Money in the Bank"" is one of few Pay-Per-Views that manages to capture my full attention and it's one that delivers every year; this was no exception. The ""Money in the Bank"" ladder match has become more and more innovative since its birth at ""WrestleMania"" 21. This event was headlined by the Rising Stars ladder match and the All Star ladder match. The event had a lot of unpredictable twists that are destined for sequels.

Tag Team Championship
The Shield (Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins) [Champions] vs. The Usos
For not making the main card, this was an excellent tag team match. Being on the 'kickoff' show was a blessing in disguise as these stars got a lot of time to shine. The Philly crowd was in to the match the whole way and the last five minutes were top notch. The ""Tower of Doom"" spot was awesome and the crowd was chanting that exact word for the effort these four put on. The Shield retained in a very nice display of work and I wouldn't mind seeing these teams mix it up again. ***

World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank Ladder Match
Wade Barrett vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Damien Sandow vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Jack Swagger vs. Antonio Cesaro vs. Fandango
Wow! These seven up and coming stars really know how to deliver a suspenseful, high risk ladder match. The story line was interesting coming in to this one as Sandow & Rhodes were working as a team, as well as Swagger & Cesaro. There were so many innovative spots including Ambrose 'skinning the cat' on top of the ladder among others. The interference from the Shield on behalf of Ambrose didn't hurt the match one bit because it extended their fued with the Usos. The final stretch was booked brilliantly as Rhodes was fighting off every body and really got the crowd behind him, only for his 'friend' Sandow to steal the win and the briefcase from him. He is the intellectual savior after all! I'm going to love the feud between Rhodes and Sandow. ****

Intercontinental Championship
Curtis Axel (Champion) vs. The Miz
This was kind of doomed from the start as the crowd went dead when Heyman (Axel's manager) was sent to the back; not really sure what the booking team was thinking there. The action was about as decent as you're going to get with these two. It was an okay bout with an anti climatic ending, but the main problem was that no one seemed to care about what was going on. It wasn't a bad match, it just never really picked up. **

Divas Championship
AJ Lee (Champion) vs. Kaitlyn
The divas division has really took a turn since these two ladies have been involved in the championship picture. Their promos and storytelling is as intense and entertaining as it gets when it comes to divas matches. This wasn't as good as their ""Payback"" encounter, but it was still fairly good. The story was built around Kaitlyn's 'injured' elbow as it played a factor in the result. On a side note, AJ can really pull of that Black Widow submission! **

Chris Jericho vs. Ryback
Chris Jericho has always been one of my personal favorites and has such an accomplished career. With that being said, his role now is to put younger talent over, something Ryback desperately needed. Jericho pulled Ryback to one of his best matches yet as this was more than just a punch-kick-punch affair. Ryback delivered a few more moves than I'm accustomed too seeing from him and even delivered a nasty shot to Jericho that sent him flying between the two announce tables. The ending was abrupt and failed in making Ryback a monster heel, but in the end he was still put over. ***

World Heavyweight Championship
Alberto Del Rio (Champion) vs. Dolph Ziggler
Let me just say, these two have crazy good chemistry together. This was different from their ""Payback"" match as that one featured Del Rio make his heel turn by working on the head of Ziggler with vicious kicks. The crowd was solidly behind Ziggler and they were in the palm of his hands the whole match. Del Rio and Ziggler played their roles perfectly and delivered crisp action with many false finishes. AJ Lee hitting Del Rio with the belt accomplished getting Ziggler over as a face and it leads to their eventual break up. This was the best World Title match in a long while. ***

WWE Championship
John Cena (Champion) vs. Mark Henry
The build up to this match was gold as Henry faked a retirement speech with a performance that was Oscar worthy, which led to him delivering the WSS to Cena and here we are. The match was a lot better than I expected as the first half of the match played to the strength of Henry as he flat out dominated Cena. This wasn't necessarily the usual formulaic John Cena vs. Monster match, Henry is much more than that and is a very underrated worker. Cena retaining the belt was predictable but the crowd ate this one up and was behind Henry the whole way. ***

WWE Championship Money in the Bank ""All-Stars"" Ladder Match
Rob Van Dam vs. CM Punk vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Randy Orton vs. Sheamus vs. Christian
The title of this match and the star power gave it huge expectations to live up too and these men still delivered a damn fine main event. It was too cool to see RVD back in a WWE ring and Philly loved it, as well as myself. This was worked a lot differently from the first ladder match, as the stars slowly picked their spots and the build up was worked in a smart manner. RVD showed he still has it as he delivered his usual spots such as 'rolling thunder' and did a huge '5 Star Frog Splash' off the ladder to Christian. Sheamus took a butt kicking all over the ring and went through a ladder as well. Daniel Bryan's run at the end of the match was incredible but it led to some confusing Curtis Axel interference. In the end, this match developed the Punk-Heyman-Lesnar storyline as Heyman turned on Punk and hit him with some stiff ladder shots. The look on Punk's face was brilliant and did a lot in showing how emotional he was when his best friend betrayed him. Orton caught RVD with a huge RKO in the closing moments and grabbed the briefcase, which leads to his re-evaluation in the title picture and hopefully a long awaited heel turn. This match was crazy fun and it's going to do a lot for some of these stars in the long run. ****

This was the best show of 2013 thus far and it really came through and delivered when it needed to. There wasn't a terrible match on the card and the ladder matches were just excellent. ""Money in the Bank"" is a success and it does good in building up the second biggest event of the year ""Summerslam.""",1373846400,10,6510,4.468460891505467
5736442,4,B00CRWDKNS,"The MITB ladder match for the Worlds title(Wade Barrett vs Cody Rhodes vs Damien Sandow vs Dean Ambrose vs Fandango vs Jack Swagger vs Antonio Cesaro) was AWESOME with a twist ending to boot. The Intercontinental title match between Curis Axel & The Miz was boring at first but overall,it was solid. The Divas title match between AJ Lee & Kaitlyn was fine but not as good as thier first bout from Payback. The Chris Jericho-Ryback match was not great but pretty good. The Wolrds title match between Alberto Del Rio & Dolph Ziggler was a very intense,fast-paced bout with lots of great nearfalls from both guys even with the lousy DQ ending. The WWE title match between John Cena & Mark Henry was a heart-pounding,nail-biting bout with good storyteliing and chemistry to boot. The All-Stars MITB ladder match for the WWE title(Randy Orton vs Rob Van Dam vs CM Punk vs Daniel Bryan vs Christain vs Sheamus) was a fun ladder bout even with the multiple interferences. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1373846400,9,995,4.627118644067797
5736443,4,B00CRWDKNS,"Money in the Bank was a PPV event originating from the Wells Fargo Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The show was headlined by two Money in the Bank ladder matches and four other championships on the line. Here is a brief synopsis for each match, with as little spoilers as possible.

1. Money in the Bank Ladder Match- World Heavyweight Championship Title Shot: I'll admit this match I was worried about, but it came across REALLY awesome. Kudos to everyone in that match, especially Cody Rhodes. ****
* There was a Vickie Guerrero 'tribute' segment that went on too long near the beginning, however it didn't seemingly kill a crowd like segments like that have done in the past.*
2. Curtis Axel vs. The Miz, Intercontinental Championship: A serviceable match made more hilarious by a Paul Heyman cameo that needs to be seen to be believed. **
3. AJ Lee vs. Kaitlyn, Divas' Championship: Right on par with their match last night, perhaps even a touch better. **1/2
4. Chris Jericho vs. Ryback: Definitely not a classic, but not stinky bad either. **
5. Alberto Del Rio vs. Dolph Ziggler for the World Heavyweight Championship: A good match with a surprising ending. ***1/4
6. John Cena vs. Mark Henry for the WWE Championship: A match that on its own would not be a classic, but in massive crowds of people, sounds like the greatest thing since sliced bread. *** (primarily for the crowd I was with)
7. Money in the Bank Ladder Match- WWE Championship Title Shot: This was slightly more physical than the WHC title match, which means more people bled practically. Most people kind-of groaned at the winner, but alas, it's how he cashes in that makes the win here good or bad. ****
PRE-SHOW: Thw Usos vs. The Shield (Seth Rollins & Roman Reigns), WWE Tag Team Championships: A fantastic little match on the pre-show that when released on DVD will make people scratch their heads as to why it didn't make the main show. ***1/2

Overall: This PPV is a solid 8/10 from me. A PPV like Money in the Bank truly only needs to deliver from two matches, those being the ladder spot-fests. There's no reason to not check this out, very recommended.",1373846400,5,2141,4.676392572944297
5736444,4,B00CRWDKNS,"Money in the Bank match for the World Championship featuring Dean Ambrose VS Fandango VS Antonio Cesaro VS Jack Swagger VS Damien Sandow VS Cody Rhodes VS Wade Barrett: This was a very good opener, I liked Cody Rhodes muscle buster onto the ladder. The Shield interferes in this match but Sandow takes out his tag team partner, Cody Rhodes, & steals the briefcase. Sadly, he would not win the championship when he cashed it in & he is nothing more then a forgotten up & comer.

IC Champion Curtis Axel VS The Miz: It was alright, seen the match a dozen of times before.

Diva's Champion AJ Lee VS Katilyn: I skipped over this one. However, does anyone know how entertaining Big E is? The WWE never lets him talk but he's a funny guy. Of course he is the IC champ as the writing of this review & we know how useless that belt is in the current state of WWE.

Ryback VS Chris Jericho: I enjoy Ryback as a wrestler even though everyone thinks he is nothing more then a Goldberg clone. WWE brought him up the right way, squash jobbers, slowly move up the card, & then be in the main event. Much like another favortie star of mine, Damien Sandow, he is nothing more then a forgotten talent in the current WWE.

World Champion Albert Del Rio VS Dolph Ziggler: A very good match that i've seen on Smackdown dozen of times. The ending was exciting but then ruined when AJ Lee interferes & cost Ziggler the match.

WWE Champion John Cena VS Mark Henry: Henry puts on a tearful retirement speech on Raw before attacking Cena. It was a good match towards the end with Superman winning it.

Wyatt Family promo.

Money in the Bank ladder match for the WWE title with the returning RVD VS CM Punk VS Sheamus VS Christian VS Randy Orton VS Daniel Bryan: Very good main event

Extra match on the dvd featured a great tag match featuring The Shield beating the Uso's, which is a very good tag match & worth checking out.

Much like a dozen other reviews i've written about the current product, the wreslting is fine but if you watch Raw, Smackdown, & Main Event then your not watching anything speical. The only thing different was the M.I.B ladder matches but still a good event.",1397606400,,2163,4.3875

MONEY IN THE BANK 2013

1.[WORLD TITLE MITB LADDR MATCH]DEAN AMBROSE VS CODY RHODES VS DAMIAN SANDOW VS WADE BARRETT VS ANTONIO CESARO VS JACK SWAGGER VS FANDANGO-this was a great opening match that would see many great moments. Where the main event is main event established guys this one is the future of WWE guys going at it. The action is great here particularly for Cody who turns in a great performance. My boy Dean who I wanted to win got caught on top of the ladder, you will see what I mean. In the end Sandow betrays his boy Cody who was on fire to grab the briefcase.

2.[IC TITLE]CURTIS AXEL VS THE MIZ-this is a much better match than it is getting credit for. Both guys are underrated in my opinion and put on a good match here. Miz was very aggressive in this match and looked very impressive. Axe of course did a great job even after Heyman was sent to the back after a cool little moment with Miz. The pace is good as they go back and forth but Axel retains here in a good match.

3.[DIVAS TITLE]AJ LEE VS KAITLYN-this was a pretty good Divas match that had Kaitlyn looking really good for a good portion of the match. She even comes close to winning the title on different occasions but her shoulder prevents it after a spear. AJ of course is great as always and retains the belt.

4. CHRIS JERICHO VS RYBACK-another match that is better than it is getting credit for. Sure it is most likely because of Jericho but still it was good. Jericho started off strong taking it to the big man but Ryback used his strength to bounce back. He tossed Y2J all over the place including to the outside between the announcers tables. Jericho would come back only to be rolled up by Ryback.

5.[WORLD TITLE]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-this was a great match right here between these two. They went back and forth with Dolph the crowd favorite as he showed off every time he was in control. But Del Rio always came back making this one very competitive. Of course we all know how it ended as AJ got involved and cost Ziggler the belt. I actually didn't mind it as much as others did.

6.[WWE TITLE]JOHN CNEA VS MARK HENERY-I don't care what anyone else says I really liked this match. I loved what Henry had done on Raw as it was one of the best moments ever on the program. The match was a good one as Henry of course used his size and strength against Cena. Cena of course was resourceful and fought back like he always does making it a compelling contest. I wanted Henry to win so bad here as I thought he earned with that Raw performance alone but also all the years he has put in. but WWE wanted Cena to keep it so Henry ends up tapping out, still a good match.

7.[WWE TITLE MITB LADDER MATCH]CM PUNK VS CHRISTIAN VS ROB VAN DAM VS DANIEL BRYAN VS SHEAMUS VS RANDY ORTON-the All-Star MITB match that had been really hyped due to RVDs return. I will admit I was one of those excited for this. I guess all the participants did not because the opening of the match is hilarious as they all attack RVD. From there it is what you would expect from this type of match. All kinds of spots and memorable moments like my favorite, Christian finding the small ladder. Of course there are various uses of the ladders and a moment where every man is going up for the briefcase. We all know that CM Punk was on his way to victory until he is betrayed by Heyman which leads to The Vipers win.

BONUS MATCH

1.[TAG TTILE]SETH ROLLINS & ROMAN REIGNS VS THE USOS-they were crazy not to have this on the PPV as it may be my favorite match of the night. These two teams go all out delivery and showing to the boss that they should have been on the PPV. Both teams look outstanding here in a back and forth contest that sees The Shield retain the belts in a hard fought battle. How is a title match not on the PPV anyway.

This was a really good event with some fun matches on it. Sure others were not as good and the pre show match should have been on the PPV. The tag title match was probably my favorite here and the MITB matches are always fun. I recommend this to any wrestling fan out there.",1389225600,2,4094,4.230473751600512

Ever since it was introduced to the WWE Universe in at Wrestlemania 21 in 2005, the Money in the Bank Ladder Match has given us many memorable and classic moments as well as future WWE/World Heavyweight Champions. In 2010, WWE gave the match it's own event in July 2010. Every Money in the Bank pay-per-view has delivered and we have yet to see one disappoint, and this years no different.

Money in the Bank took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in front of over 18,000 people and the hot crowd as well as everyone watching was eagerly anticipating the return of one Rob Van Dam.

Kick-Off Match:

WWE Tag Team Championship:
The Shield (c) vs. The Usos
  To see The Shield on the kick-off was pretty disappointing, but as usual, they didn't disappoint in what has to be the best pre-show/kick off match of all time. The crowd was already into this match and both teams delivered. The Usos got the upper hand in the beginning of the match and getting the best of Reigns and Rollins. Then they came back and this was a back and forth match and picking up a really fast pace to an already face paced match near the closing moments. The Usos several times looked like they were leaving with the Tag Titles. They're a great team and they showed the Tag Team division to be aware of them. Nice finish to this match as well.
  Winner: The Shield
  Match Rating: 9/10

1. Money in the Bank Ladder Match: World Heavyweight Championship Contract:
  Dean Ambrose vs. Fandango vs. Antonio Cesaro vs. Jack Swagger vs. Damien Sandow vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Wade Barrett.
  Man what an opener to the event. This was faced paced action and is worth noting that all these men are heels. Dean Ambrose and Cody Rhodes put on a really good showing during the match as they were the highlights from the match such as Ambrose giving us a flashback of the Hall of Famer Terry Funk as well as climbing from under a ladder to the top of the ladder and Rhodes missile drop-kicking Cesaro off Swagger's shoulders and a nice brain-buster to Fandango to the ladder. We get some expected guests in the match, but they weren't able to pull off what they came to do. At the end, we see the demise of a team. Great Money in the Bank Ladder Match and although a quick shorter in terms of length than most MITB Ladder Matches, it still put on a great showing.
  Winner: Damien Sandow
  Match Rating: 9.5/10
  * Also, Summer Rae is just gorgeous at ringside during the match.

We then get a segment with Brad Maddox and Vicky Guerrero. Pretty entertaining towards the end.

2. Intercontinental Championship:
  Curtis Axel (c) (W/ Paul Heyman) vs. The Miz
  The crowd was loving Paul Heyman as Heyman was a hometown hero and legend for his ECW days. Pretty nice to see Heyman get a nice reaction when he was forced to leave the ringside area after being outsmarted by Miz. The match itself was ok and the only real highlight being the fact that Axel can counter Miz's Figure-4-Leglock.
  Winner: Curtis Axel
  Match Rating: 7/10

3. Divas Championship:
  AJ Lee (c) (W/ Big E. Langston) vs. Kaitlyn (W/ Layla)
  I was looking forward to this match as I thought they put a classic divas match at Payback the month before. While the match wasn't as good as their encounter at Payback, it was still a nice match. AJ was working on Kaitlyn's injured elbow and Kaitlyn trying to fight off. A quick match, but worth watching. Nice back and forth from these two and I honestly think they can put on a pretty good 30-Minute Iron-Man match if given the opportunity.
  Winner: AJ Lee
  Match Rating: 8/10

4. Ryback vs. Chris Jericho
  This match was worth watching, although it wasn't a great match. The two seem to work fine together and it was Ryback showing his strength and Jericho showing his amazing wrestling skills. The two put on a back and forth kind of match and it was nice with some near falls. We get to see some new moves from Ryback like a spash from the top rope and a nice-looking toss. Nice codrbreaker from Y2J on Ryback from between the ropes. A somewhat disappointing finish, but we see someone earning a much needed PPV victory.
  Winner: Ryback
  Match Rating: 7.5/10

5. World Heavyweight Championship:
  Alberto Del Rio (c) vs. Dolph Ziggler
  Ziggler gets a nice pop from the fans and is clearly the favorite to win. Del Rio came solo as Ricardo Rodriguez had been suspended a week before. This was a good match showing the nonstop attacks from Del Rio and the fast paced style of Ziggler. Ziggler gets the early advantage but Del Rio turns things around. Then Dolph gets the control again and then we get an uninvited guest who, as the crowd said, ""You Screwed Ziggler."" Overall nice match, but not as good as the Payback match, but cool to see Ziggler get more offense.
  Winner: Alberto Del Rio
  Match Rating: 8.5/10

6. WWE Championship:
  John Cena (c) vs. Mark Henry
  Worth noting that this match came before the WWE Championship MITB match which meant that no cash in could happen. After a nice buildup that included the classic faux retirement speech from Mark Henry and Cena showing that he couldn't AA Henry. Henry was the crowd favorite in this match. This match basically had Henry dominating the match for the most part with Cena getting little offense going. Then Cena turns things around and hits an AA, but gets a two-count. Cena then goes for the STF, but Henry makes it to the ropes. Then they battle a bit more and then Cena locks in the STF again and gets the upset.
  Winner: John Cena
  Match Rating: 8/10

7. Money in the Bank All Stars Match: WWE Championship Contract
  Rob Van Dam vs. CM Punk vs. Randy Orton vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus vs. Christian
  The crowd was very loud moments before the match chanting RVD. Rob Van Dam came out first to a standing ovation and one of the biggest pops I've heard for a return since Brock Lesnar's return in 2012. The match started with the other 5 men attacking RVD and then Sheamus. Then we get a short, but sweet encounter between Daniel Bryan and CM Punk. Then we get what we expect in a MITB match, mayhem. We see someone going through a ladder to a splash off the top of a ladder to a mid-air off ladder RKO to a chaotic Daniel Bryan. We also see a surprise back stabbing to one of the contestants. We see that same person get busted open as well. Great return performance by RVD and a great introduction to a storyline we've been waiting for. The winner of the match definitely deserved it and he finally gets back to the title picture after being stuck in mid-card status for nearly 2 years. One of the all time best MITB Ladder Matches.
  Winner: Randy Orton
  Match Rating: 10/10

Overall, great event and probably the second best Money in the Bank Ladder event after the 2011 event. Highly recommended.
Overall Event Rating: 9/10

5736453,3,B00CRWDKNS,"Let me say first off that I actually really enjoyed this event, so much that I would say that it was arguably the best pay-per-view of the year thus far.  My weak rating isn't necessarily based on the pay-per-view event but the DVD.

First, the DVD contains the event in its entirety, as it pertains to the pay-per-view portion, but it's bare-boned at best.  Beyond the pay-per-view the only extra on the entire disc is the WWE Tag Team Championship match between The Shield and the Usos.  While this would have been great (as I personally don't care for the interviews with the superstars as they are in character versus the actual person) the match that I had enjoyed so much during the pre-show has been horribly edited.  Not only is the match half of its actual length, the match is cut up so that many of the most significant moments in the match are left out.  It would be one thing to keep the match as how it aired during the pre-show with the breaks where the commercials would have been but too but to butcher the match further is too much.  Normally I'm not one to complain but when one of the best matches of the year is put on a disc and its not in its entirety that just outright angers me.  I'm not going to lie, having just watched my disc I'm pretty sour.

Second grip, is that the WWE has been pretty good about releasing some of its best pay-per-views on dual format by offering it on DVD and Blu-ray.  If you have an HD television set that's larger than 26 inches than you'll know that even with a Blu-ray player augmenting the DVD the picture still looks a bit off.  That's why I've enjoyed having the option of buying events on Blu-ray which truly allows the picture to shine.  This particular event wasn't given an option for Blu-ray preorder until after the release of the DVD.  Not only that but the release date for this Blu-ray isn't until November.  A stark difference from when the ""Payback"" event was released and gained its own Blu-ray release.  I bought my copy of ""Money in the Bank"" and really wish I could have had the option before receiving my DVD for the Blu-ray so I could have known to save for that release.

I'm really hoping that the Blu-ray release will have the full WWE Tag Team Match, or at least how it was presented during the pre-show) and my other grip is a temporary one until the release of the Blu-ray but I still say better advertizing should have been done to save fans on buying an event twice.",1376697600,,2451,4.377483443708609
