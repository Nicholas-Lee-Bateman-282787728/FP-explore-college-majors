8527783,5,B008GZVHI0,"In July 2001 the G8 held their summit in Genoa, Italy. There had been protests from a number of groups and one man had been shot dead by police which had raised tensions even higher. The Genoa Social Forum had organised the protests to have maximum effect and wanted these to be peaceful. Anarchists of the `Black Bloc' were originally blamed for an upsurge in militancy and vandalism and were not knowingly harboured by the organisers.

The Genoa social Forum had set up a dormitory in an old school called Diaz. They also had a media centre which was being used by journalists and lawyers to advise on rights etc. Then just before midnight on 21 July the police decided that they were going into the school to flush out a nest of Black Bloc activists. They rammed the gates with an armoured car and started to indiscriminately beat up anyone they came across, this included journalists and people who offered no resistance even those lying in their sleeping bas.

What happened as the night unfolded was truly horrific and Amnesty International said it was ""The most serious suspension of democratic rights in a Western country since the Second World War"". Evidence was planted and lies were told to the waiting media, abuse and torture were rife. Even the lucky ones who were taken to hospital were not left alone and were even taken into detention whilst receiving treatment.

The film uses source material including evidence statements to recreate the night and surrounding events. It tells the story from a number of perspectives that include flash back and some repetition in order to give the individual stories some focus as to time line etc.

The acting is all amazing and all of the characters speak in their native tongue, so we have Italian, Spanish, French, German and English all well sub titled. The violence is quite in your face and scenes of humiliation can be a painful watch. Critics were mixed either raving about this as a land mark piece of cinema and being given 10 out of 10, to scathing, portraying this as a work of agitprop of the lowest kind.

I found it well made, informed and as balanced as the evidence would allow. It also summarised the judicial findings that exonerated all of the occupants of all charges brought by a bloated and corrupt police force. And the findings against the police and law officers which are a matter of record. When the protectors of society turn on a whole grouping, as was the case here and in so many places around the world it needs to be remembered or there are risks that it will happen again. Films like this one from director Danilele Vicari act as the reminder and I can only recommend it as a brilliant re enactment of a shameful episode in the history of the Western democracies.",1378857600,,2752,4.665979381443299
