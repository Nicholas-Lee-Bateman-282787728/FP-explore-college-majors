2542997,5,B000EXDRX0,"This movie was adorable! I loved The Ice Cream Wars and The Prince And The Ponies. Both were adorable! I know that Baby Quackers quacks in the G1 My Little Pony episodes like Thistle Whistle whistles in the G3 My Little Pony episodes! The songs I liked best was 'Babysitting' and 'Those Newborn Twins'. I will use my very favorite song, 'Babysitting' for examlpe. Here are the lyrics!

Baby North Star:
Babysitting! Babysitting!
Babies fuss and cry and spitting!

Baby Fifi:
Babysitting! Babysitting!
Oh, my aching head is splitting!

Baby Quackers:
Caring for a cuddly tot takes a lot,
Your nerves get shot- quack quack quack!

Baby Lickety-Split:
Babies cause all kinds of trouble- Hey, you two!

Baby North Star:
And with twins, your trouble's double!
Babysitting! Babysitting!
Babies fuss and cry and spitting!

All First Tooth Baby Ponies:
We say ""Yes!"", they say ""No!""
We say ""Stop!"", they say ""Go!""
No wonder that we feel like quitting
Babysitting, Babysitting....Babysitting!",1147564800,5,983,5.1125
2542998,5,B000EXDRX0,"I thought the rest of the second season of the My Little Pony TV series on this DVD was even better than all the others. What I liked the most was when the First Tooth Baby Ponies appeared. I thought the First Tooth Baby Ponies were funny, although they couldn't stand the newborn twins.

I also thought the Big Brother Ponies in Somnambula were cool, because they were the only boy ponies that ever showed up.

In my opinion, I thought it was strange that two of the characters actually grew up because they don't normally tend to. Spike began to grow up with his fire breathing. Baby Lickety-Split also grew up since she was the only baby pony that went from Beddy Bye Eye to First Tooth.

Overall, I would say that anybody that grew up with My Little Pony should buy this DVD for any occasion!!",1144886400,3,797,4.371621621621622
2543066,5,B000EXDRX0,"I remember this edition of My Little Pony from when I was a child. This DVD is by far my daughter's favorite. We have already bought a few copies of this particular one because she doesn't always treat her DVD's with respect. If you are looking for a child's show, particularly a girls show, with a cute storyline, friendship and ponies look no further. In my opinion this series is MUCH better than any of the newer My Little Pony editions, but that's up for debate from some, I am sure. It's a great little movie, I highly recommend it.",1357862400,,538,4.39
2543067,5,B000EXDRX0,"My daughter absolutely loves My Little Pony and she loves all the books. They are well written and now that she is learning to read, these are great for her.",1356048000,,157,4.266666666666667
2543068,5,B000EXDRX0,"this is half of my little pony season 2, a great video to share with the family! awsome if you like that good old 1980's animation!",1320278400,5,131,4.076923076923077
2543069,2,B000EXDRX0,This has got to be one of the most annoying cartoons I have ever been subjected to....but I must admit that my 3 year old really like it.,1317254400,,137,3.9285714285714284
2543070,4,B000EXDRX0,bought this for my daughter for christmas and she absolutely loves it!  it is nice to see her so enthusiastic for the same stuff i used to like when i was little.  :),1299974400,4,166,4.0
2543071,5,B000EXDRX0,"My daughters are now in the phase of My Little Pony.  Everything has to be ponies.  I myself have not actually watched it all the way to the end but I have not heard any key ""worry"" words that would make me get rid of this video.  These are older episodes that I probably watched as a little girl, so if your looking for the new ones, this is not it.  If your daughter is into the series, give it a try.",1299110400,3,403,3.8780487804878048
2543072,5,B000EXDRX0,"I love how quickly you shipped my order and when we got it! There are so many vendors listed out there through amazon.com (and some orders I'm still waiting on) I really appreciate you getting it out to us right away, I would do business with you again:)",1276560000,,254,4.3125
2543073,2,B000EXDRX0,"The Episode ""Flight to Cloud Castle"" essentially advocates arranged marriage and women 'owing' themselves to men who can provide for them.  I remember seeing this particular episode as a child and realizing even then that it was a shallow attempt at pushing some very... traditional views on kids.",1251158400,,297,5.1875
2543074,5,B000EXDRX0,My kids have enjoyed watching this DVD and its fun for me to watch with them and takes me back to my childhood. Its totally kid-friendly and family fun.,1239235200,,152,4.275862068965517
2543075,5,B000EXDRX0,I bought this book for my granddaughter's 3rd birthday. She loves My Little Pony. She loves for us to read this book to her over and over again. The pictures are so bright and colorful it's a wonderful book.,1235433600,,207,4.333333333333333

2543117,5,B000EXDRX0,"When I was growing up in 1977 and up, all I wanted to watch was She-Ra, The Charmkins and Strawberry Shortcake. But if any of these shoiws were on at the same time as MLP I wouldn't watch them. It was always the MLP. I absolutly loved the peguas Surprize. Then they added they baby ponies I was thrilled. As I got older I was dissapointed with all the new versions ( or remakes) of the old classic cartons. I happy EXTREMELY thrilled with Amazon for selling and finding these classics. YEAH, YEAH!!!!",1215734400,4,500,4.387096774193548
2543118,5,B000EXDRX0,"The voices are so annoying...........to me the adult.  But children, both boys and girls love the Pony movies.  They are very colorful and pretty to look at.  The messages are positive.",1207094400,,185,4.903225806451613

2543120,5,B000EXDRX0,My 8 y/o dtr has watched this over & over. She has at least 10 MLP books that she loves. It is fun to watch & hear them on video.,1200614400,,129,3.3333333333333335
2543121,5,B000EXDRX0,This video brings back all the great memories. I'd recommend it for any my little pony fan!,1197936000,,91,4.411764705882353
2543122,5,B000EXDRX0,"We bought season one for our daughter when she was three and she absolutely loved all the episodes.  I searched and searched for the second season but kept on getting reports that Sony would not release the second season.  I am ecstatic that they finally did.

As the previous reviewer wrote, this is not the Princess Promenade.  These are Saturday morning cartoons form the 80's when Thundarr and He-Man were very popular.  Yes there are monsters, and yes the ponies are often in ""mortal"" danger.  And yes, the animation is not crisp like todays computer drawn animation is, but all the episodes are wonderful and show kids that if you are a good person and stand by your friends, good things will happen to you.  This is something that many of the thin skinned, terrified children of today should learn instead of being coddled by mindless entertainment like Dora or Blue.

Off topic, sorry, back to the discs.  The songs are simple and catchy, our daughter is 4 1/2 now and sings most of the songs from season one.  She hasn't learned season two's yet, but it will only be a matter of time.

I would highly recommend this for all children that love to play with Little Ponies!",1156550400,30,1179,4.5933014354066986
2543123,1,B000EXDRX0,"My 4-year old daughter fell in love with MLP after watching the ""Princess Promenade"" DVD, so when we saw this, we scooped it up.  After watching princess promenade though, watching this was torture.  The animation and audio are so poorly done.  Every story has a scary character that terrified my 4-year old.  The cover resembles the princess promenade disk as far as imagery, but doesn't match the video at all.  It seems deceptive.  Only after my dissapointment did I note the 1987 production date.

If I can return this, I will, because my daughter is too scared to watch it.",1154995200,6,578,4.72

8115378,5,B000EXDRX0,:),1443744000,,2,2.0
8115379,3,B000EXDRX0,"This DVD contains the final five story-lines from the second season of the '80s My Little Pony series (the first two stories are on ""Quest of the Princess Ponies & Other Stories"", together the two DVDs contain the entire second season).

The classic My Little Pony series is a lighthearted action-adventure series with very little violence. The animation is about average for the 80s, which is to say usually adequate but with the occasional animation error. The writing is above average for the era, with many surprising plot twists; however it is weighed down somewhat by the huge cast, which makes it difficult for the writers to flesh out very many of the characters and for the viewers to keep track of them all.

The stories on this disc suffer the most out of the series from the fact that the series was designed to advertise a toy line, as several stories are so focused on introducing new characters that we barely see the old characters. Additionally, several of the stories on this disc are single-episode stories, which means their plots are a lot thinner than is usual for this series.

I would recommend this DVD primarily to those who already have the Season One collection and wish to complete their classic MLP collection. Parents looking for a cheap DVD to entertain young children might also consider this DVD, however they should keep in mind that the characters and world of the classic series are completely unrelated to the current ""Friendship is Magic"" series, a fact which might disappoint those familiar with the current series.",1438214400,,1555,4.860377358490566

8115382,5,B000EXDRX0,"I love the original My Little Pony. It's great for children and adults. I specifically enjoy the animation being an artist my self. However I ordered this DVD from ""Great Buy! USA"" and the condition was far from what they described. I would not recommend buying through them. However I also ordered a different My Little Pony DVD from ""BACKTRAX Music, Video, Books, Etc."" and the condition was exactly the way they described it. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.",1389744000,,473,4.851851851851852
