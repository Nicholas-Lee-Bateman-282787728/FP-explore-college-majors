7960687,3,B0000649M6,"This is was one of those commercial tapes ECW  pushed/promoted like crazy during there hardcore tv airings

It's a glorified best of mostly from past ECW hardcore tv episodes
it runs a short  1hr 30 min
1.) Chris Benoit vs Sabu (Benoit Breaks Sabu's Neck)  This is maybe 5 minutes long it was a botched move
This is how Benoit was renamed the crippler in hindsight Sabu got off easy
Now in 2015 this footage might be hard to find since the WWE has scrubbed Chris Benoit from all wrestling
2.) Sandman & Terry Funk vs Shane Douglas & Cactus Jack  (interesting tag team match)
3.) Public Enemy vs Gangstas  (average brawl)
4.) Dudley Dudley & Vampire Warrior vs The Steiner Brothers (a rare match with the Steiners in ECW) pretty much a squash match that didn't have any real point since the Steiners were never contracted in ECW it hurt Vampire Warrior more then anything else!
5.) Sandman vs Cactus Jack (Barbed Wire Match From Florida) hardcore brutal barbed wire match this was one of the dozen times or so ECW did a sanctioned barbed wire match they tried to mimic early W*ING or FMW
6.) Francine vs Beulah (Catfight Match) Super old footage when Francine was Stevie Richards stalker/ girlfriend this was the match that ended that story line  very weak and tries to hard to be raunchy

I remember getting conned into buying this commercial tape back in the day
It's average with mostly hardcore tv footage  it's better then ECW Extreme Warfare Volume 2 that's for sure
