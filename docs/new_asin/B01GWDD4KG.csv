They have included the original mono track in various other languages but not in English which is the biggest let down and the worst thing about it is that the previous dvd releases don't have it either.  The only way you can listen to the original audio in English is through an old tv recording if you are lucky enough to have it or possibly a VHS copy.

The scene where Jim Kelly fights the cops has this ridiculous background music which takes away from the seriousness and suspense that was once there.  The scene where Han is talking to Roper near the guillotine has had its original music omitted completely ruining the atmosphere, and the fight between Roper and Bolo has a 'hit' sound missing after the kick to the mid section.  These are just a few examples I am sure there are plenty more.

Thank you to the audio department who are responsible for this ruining one of my all time favourite movies of all time, you did a smashing job! Round of applause to you guys!",1487289600,4,1056,4.38974358974359

Who ever did the audio remix on this really blew it. You might not want to purchase this edition and try the other ones. You can barely hear the talking but anytime an action scene comes up ,or the music, it is blasting. Head phones will be the best bet.
Also, I wish folks would just leave the movies alone. You have added footage of Bruce in the beginning talking to his master in which the voice is not even Bruce Lee's voice. Most likely why they didn't originally have it in the movie. Bruce never got around to the audio track on that scene or he decided he did not want the scene in there due to the lengthy time.
Whatever the case I wish I could get the original version of this movie as it was shown in the theaters back in 73. Or even the VHS version. I cannot find the original dvd cut when it first came out. I think that one is closest to the original.
Might be why it is currently unavailable??? Either way I am now drifting over the the movie channels to watch these rather then purchase any more discs etc. Never thought I would see the day!",1479513600,6,1118,4.2046511627906975
