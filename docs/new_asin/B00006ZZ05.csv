1796216,5,B00006ZZ05,"I have been a Monkees fan for 17 years. This is one great DVD! The package is really sweet, probably the best package I ever seen. It has 6 discs in each case but the DVD slides out easily so be very careful with the discs. The only thing that I'm disappointed with is the booklet, I wish it has more information. Overall, I give this 5 stars! Don't wait, go get it!",1053216000,,366,4.027397260273973
1796217,5,B00006ZZ05,Totally awesome Monkees DVD set. I am a huge Monkees fan and I have the complete set on video and I can't wait for the second season on DVD. I told my husband several months ago I wish they would put the complete season on DVD. If you're a huge Monkees fan this is a must have DVD set.,1053129600,,285,3.847457627118644
1796218,5,B00006ZZ05,"The Monkees television program was created to capitalize on the success of The Beatles' movies.  The show was based on the Fab Four's A Hard Day's Night and the idea was to bring rock and roll into primetime for the large teenage audience.  The show cast four unknowns, Mickey Dolenz, Mike Nesmith, Davy Jones & Peter Tork, to play themselves.  The show was produced by Bob Rafelson (who also directed several episodes) and Bert Schneider and they wanted to create a madcap, quick paced show.  The show's plots were pretty simple, usually revolving around Davy falling in love with a girl and the group foiling someone's evil schemes. The way that the show was put together that was extremely inventive.  It didn't follow standard television scene shooting by filming an entire scene on a single set.  The scenes would feature images spliced in and out, quick camera movement from one character to the next, freeze frames, inserting images like light bulbs over someone's head and humorous captions.  The shows also feature what would become known as Monkee romps.  These were set to the Monkees' songs and were basically promotional clips for the songs.  They were the forerunners of music videos and that is probably why MTV featured Monkees episodes in 1986 and helped spur a new Monkeemania wave in the mid 80's.  The Monkees each assumed their own identities, Davy was the handsome one, Mike was the leader, Mickey was the silly one and Peter was the dumb one.  Each actor was quite believable, so believable that the public thought they were an actual group and the success of the music helped pave the way for a Monkees tour.  The show had an anarchic sense of humor and the guys never took themselves too seriously on screen.  It's this loose feel that helps keep the show fresh (although the clothes and phrases are 60's all the way) even today.  The show was a moderate success in the ratings, but it was a big success with the critics.  It won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series (an award also bestowed on shows like Cheers, All In The Family, Friends and The Mary Tyler Moore Show) for the 1966-67 season and James Frawley won for Outstanding Director for a comedy series as well.  Rhino, as they have done in the past with Monkees material, has done a masterful job in packaging this six-dvd set.  The packaging is like an old record player and the disks are encased in what look like old 45 record sleeves.  Each episode contains a trivia section that can be accessed on the episode screen (the trivia section is quite comprehensive as it gives some background info on the episode, bio information on guest stars, use of music and other interesting tidbits) and can be played in 5.1 surround sound which makes each episode sound crisp and clean.  Each episode is presented in its original format, with all the original songs included (the shows in reruns, both during their original reruns during the show's summer hiatus and when they appeared on Saturday morning contained newer songs used to promote new releases) and even with the Kellogg's and Black Label sponsors shown over the closing credits.  This dvd set a first rate set and a welcomed one as it helps preserve one of the great shows from the 60's and an underrated program that was highly influential (shows like Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In copied the show's style) and highly entertaining.",1052956800,4,3369,4.76592082616179
1796219,4,B00006ZZ05,"I'm a fan of the Monkees from the very beginning, as a matter of fact I remember seeing most of these episodes the first time they were aired on television.  That being said, I am thrilled that the first season of episodes is now on DVD.  It's a real treat to see Micky, Davy, Peter and Mike romp around the TV! Every Monkees fan should own this set!",1052956800,,350,4.132352941176471
1796220,5,B00006ZZ05,"Bless Rhino for this near-perfect collection.  I've always written off the first season of THE MONKEES as overly shrill, cutesy, and childish, the worst aspect being the standard laugh track, which tends to flatten some episodes outright.  But, while the second season (and the feature film HEAD) are light years ahead of season one in terms of music, performance, and overall style, watching this set has allowed me an opportunity to re-appraise the earlier shows.  While some are still pretty unpleasant, even the worst episodes have moments of surprising, almost experimental, quality.  The pacing and editing of these shows alone stand out as being well ahead of their time, and, even from the very beginning, the show borders on Brechtian in all the many ways (albeit mostly minor) it attempted to break the fourth wall of televisual artifice.  I am convinced that anyone who wrote the show off as kid's stuff or criticized the Monkees themselves as being talentless or disposable Beatle rip-offs has simply been misguided.  Much of what the Monkees did holds up better than any of the Beatles' film work, even from the very beginning.",1052956800,,1140,5.037234042553192
1796221,5,B00006ZZ05,"This DVD boxset of the Monkees' TV series first season is beautifully designed to resemble an old carry-around record player from the 1960's, which I actually owned at one time, even showing the record speeds at 33, 45 and 78 rpms! The six discs are packaged in cardboard replicas of some of the original Monkees 45 picture sleeves, including a few import sleeves, a very cool touch from Rhino. The only problem I see with them is that the DVDs might tend to slip out too easily from the sleeves and get damaged, so I'd advise everyone who buys the set to be careful how they handle the discs.
The booklet has some photos and interesting information on the Monkees first season, but it's very thin and not nearly as nice and colorful as the booklet from the VHS version of the box set of the entire series.
A sampling of some of the shows on DVD has them in pristine condition, the best I've ever seen them. There are special audio commentaries spread out on some of the episodes on the discs by Bob Rafelson, Michael Nesmith, Davy Jones and Peter Tork. (I guess Micky Dolenz was too busy to comment on some of the episodes, a pity, would have loved to hear what he thought of 'Monkees at the Circus'. Maybe he'll record some commentaries when Season 2 is released on DVD.)
The sixth disc has the most bonus material, including the 16mm version of the original Monkees pilot with Boyce & Hart singing the songs, an interview by Bobby Hart, a gallery of photos and rare memorabilia, audio commentary by Mike and Peter on the 'Monkees on Tour' episode, and original Monkees commercials, though some of the commercials looked like they came from video dupes, a pity Rhino couldn't seem to find original film sources.
Overall, this is an excellent presentation of the first season of the Monkees, beautifully produced and packaged. Hopefully, Season 2 on DVD will be just as handsomely produced. Suggestions I'd make to Rhino for the Second Season box set is to definitely include the '33 & 1/3' TV special (and please Rhino, marry the better video picture from the VHS box set with the better sound of the single tape release of the special), the 1976 'Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart' special, the 1997 'Hey Hey, It's The Monkees' TV special, the Rhino produced 'Hey Hey, We're The Monkees' documentary, some of the Monkees rare late 1960's TV appearances, like Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell, Hollywood Squares and others, more rare commercials, including the Kool Aid commercials, which were the last things Nesmith did with the Monkees before he quit.
Also, if any rare outtakes exist from the show, they must be included, and get commentaries on some of the episodes from all four Monkees, I definitely want to hear Micky's commentary on 'The Frodis Caper', the episode he directed. What would also be nice would be to include the videos the Monkees did in the 1980's for 'That Was Then, This Is Now', 'Heart & Soul', 'Every Step Of The Way', and the 'Justus' videos as well. Rhino should make the second box set as complete as possible, with a thicker booklet filled with rare photos and show information to make it appealing to the fans. If the second season box set comes out by Christmas, I definitely want to see it under my tree.
Kudos to Rhino for putting together a really great DVD set that does justice to the first season of the Monkees TV series.",1052870400,20,3352,4.625838926174497
1796222,5,B00006ZZ05,"This collection was even better than I thought it would be!! The more standard sitcom-like (and, in my opinion, funnier) of the series' two seasons, this collection has (almost) everything. Great packaging (it should win an award), complete, uncut(as far as I could tell) episodes and original songs. FYI-""older"" songs were substituted in later TV airings with ""newer"" songs (some syndicated episodes reflected this). An example: I was surprised to hear 'The Girl I knew Somewhere' in 'Monkees on Tour' during Micky's skating scene (It had always been Steam Engine in my memory). Bonus stuff is also very cool (look for producers comment sheets on auditioned actors on the last disc-It's hidden in the 'Collection'. I'd never seen some of this stuff before!)! Great vintage commercials and informative commentary tracks. The 16mm Pilot is also interesting to watch! Complaints: 1. Commentary should have been on ALL episodes, 2. Where's Micky? He is noticably absent from the comment tracks and 3. the 5.1 audio is not that great (it sounds like it's being played thru the P.A. at the beginning of Head). All in all, A GREAT Collection! A Must Have!! Bring on Season Two (with 33 1/3 & the ""Hey Hey, We're the Monkees"" Documentary included!!)!!",1052784000,3,1244,5.043689320388349

1796282,5,B00006ZZ05,"Great fun show, although it is a little older than me, I still can relate to the fun episodes, which always contain 1-2 great music videos of their hit songs, which were great then as now, in my opinion.  This 1st season was the best of what the show offered, and the episodes seem to be complete, so I can now lay my old VCR tapes of this show to rest and watch it in GREAT quality picture, which does not appear to me to be cropped or edited to cheapen it up.  Comparing them to the old tapes, they appear to me to be complete episodes, and the quality is clear as any show airing now on my dish.  The bad part is the packaging, it is crappy!  The disks are places one on top the other, 2 each ""page"" in the plastic book-type design.  Mine was terribly difficult to remove from this hard plastic, I keep worrying one will snap in half while trying to wrestle it out (luckily it hasn't happened yet).  I like that there is a series synopses for the episodes, it is lame when manufacturers assume you know what a show is about when you read just an episode title.  However, the synopses are printed UNDERNEATH the discs so if you want to, say, find an episode you have to remove several or all of the discs just to read where to find it, which is an unbelievable chore that shouldn't have to be.  But--since this is the only DVD of this show around, you don't have much choice but to deal with the stupid packaging.",1464307200,4,1415,4.176470588235294

1796305,4,B00006ZZ05,"This first season collection has some nice features. Some interesting commentary by Nesmith about the touring. Picture quality is good, but the sound is a big letdown. You get the loud opening theme song and then when the episode starts the dialogue falls off so low you have to adjust the volume manually. A shocking oversight really. Inside the case they have the story of the first season and how the show came to be, but it's printed so small I actually needed a magnifying glass to read it. Maybe the idea behind keeping the sound quality low is to force fans to buy the music separately from other sources. Not sure, but mind boggling. But it's still worth the purchase price for the memories and the realization of just how funny these guys really were as a real or fake band!",1455753600,6,783,4.52112676056338

1796310,5,B00006ZZ05,"If you grew up in the 1970's, you had already missed the original run of The Monkees on TV by a few years. But by the mid-70's this show was a staple of after-school TV (along with Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp), and could also be found wedged between the latest Saturday Morning Cartoons.

""The Monkees"" were like a live-action cartoon, packed with zany skits, lots of guest stars and packed with great music. From Julie Newmar to Richard Kiel, it's a treat to see who shows up in the guest starring role, and with some of the greatest pop songs of the 60's:
Last Train to Clarksville
(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone
(Theme From) The Monkees
I'm a Believer
Mary, Mary
...and so many more!! All are instantly catchy, and instantly recognizable.

If you vaguely remember watching this show as a kid, do yourself a favor, pick up this set and get transported back to those lazy Saturday mornings. It's like a time machine to a better time.",1446768000,2,933,4.5476190476190474

1796367,3,B00006ZZ05,"Monkee Men, Isn't it about time for a Blu-Ray release for this amazing groundbreaking TV classic?

I agree with many of the other comments about the shortcomings here on the old-fashioned blur-ray 4GB dvds. I did not purchase the original ""record player"" box set but the current box design is also bulky, clunky and cheap looking, mine arrived less than perfect. We the fans need a new upgraded for 2015 release to really enjoy The Monkees at the fullest at home at our leisure.

Here's what you need to do: Put the Monkees on Blu-ray,

Why you need to do this: The DVD quality here is not up to snuff especially in the fast action scenes there are a lot of digital artifacts, visible uglyiness - you know what I mean, unreasonably high compression of the data, yuck ...this is just unacceptable -- the Monkees deserve better than this...I deserve better than this, we all do, yes.

Some people say it needs re-mastered, I say that is not as important as high quality data / low compression which would be attainable with Blu-Ray media -- What else? I like the extra features but the re-do the menus too, they are also clunky and dated - no Play All selection? It's criminal.

Release on Blu-ray, less disks - more compact cases & fix the menus. Winner!",1426291200,3,1253,4.551111111111111

But future buyers need to be aware that this problem exists. The video is ok.....doesn't appear to be enhanced, but is not so bad that it is bothersome.

However I am not happy with the quality of the packaging.  All it is is one long piece of cardboard with the dvd trays thrown in, not even connected to the cardboard.  So if I put it on my shelf with movies, I will have to be careful when taking it out because they trays could fall out.  If I knew this, I would have splurged to get the other limited edition set that looks like a record player.  Also, when I received this, the discs were mixed up (not in order.

1796550,5,B00006ZZ05,"THE MONKEES-SEASON 1: Often dubbed the ""PRE-FAB FOUR"" for their intentional similarity to a certain mop-topped sensation from the other side of the pond, THE MONKEES was NBC's unparallelled, hip runaway hit of the late sixties. Intellectual leader MIKE, heartthrob DAVY, quiet soul PETER, and zany comic MICKEY channeled not only JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, and RINGO, but also THE THREE STOOGES and THE MARX BROTHERS amid a colorful, fast paced environment of cartoon-like humor, trippy montages, and wacky guest stars from RIP TAYLOR and LON CHANEY JR. to FRANK ZAPPA. The freewheeling showcase was also notable for early music videos of smash hits like LAST TRAIN TO CLARKSVILLE, PLEASANT VALLEY SUNDAY, and DAYDREAM BELIEVER...a clear predecessor for MTV, who paid back the favor 20 years later by running MONKEE-marathons, which made them superstars all over again. MIKE's southern boy charm, MICKEY's irrespressible slap-schtick, DAVY's affecting British accent, and PETER's innocent ""out there"" persona blended as seamlessly as their playful mix of bubblegum, country and rock and roll; for two gloriously fun-filled years, THE MONKEES proved a certified phenomenonon on the groove-tube, on the charts, and in our hearts.

THE MONKEES SEASON 1 is fun to watch with the catchy music, the fun romps, and the wacky stuff the Monkees get into. It's kind of like a live action&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo-Where-Are-You-The-Complete-First-and-Second-Seasons/dp/B0001CNQVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete First and Second Seasons</a>-- especially during the musical ""romp"" numbers.

Anyway, I didn't really remember the show too much except for the theme song and that a friend of mine used to make me watch it when I'd go over to her house -- although it was on repeats as this was in the 70s. I bought this Season 1 set when it was re-released and way cheaper than the previous edition, but it took me a while to watch it.

While convalescing from surgery, I decided to watch and after the first show I couldn't stop. Each show is formulaic in that the Monkees end up getting into some kind of trouble, usually having to do with Davy and a love interest, and showcases their music. And although it can be predictable, it's great fun just to watch and they seem like they're having a good time.

All 32 episode are on 6 one-sided DVDs with DVD set liner notes on the box by Andrew Sandoval, and episode synopsis with air dates. Clarity and color are pretty decent, though slightly washed out with a warmish tint, but it doesn't interfere with viewing pleasure.

*****  EXTRAS  *****

* The Monkees On Tour -- 25:16-minutes --
[Individual commentary by either Bobby Hart (song-writer), Peter Tork, or Mike Nesmith]
According to the box's episode information this was actually the last show of the season airing on 4/24/67. I list it here because it shows the behind-the-scenes of the Monkees getting ready for a real concert and seems out of place from the rest of the episodes. It's great to watch, but you really have a hard time actually hearing any of the music or singing because the screaming fans is all you hear (now I know what the Beatles meant).

* 16-mm Pilot Of The Monkees -- 24:48-minutes -- B&W and Color
At the beginning is a black and white interview/screen-test of Davy Jones and Mike Nesmith. Then the pilot begins and it sounds like Peter Tork is singing the Monkees theme song. It has a slower tempo, but it might be song writers Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart that's heard on this episode. According to Hart's interview (included) their voices were used on the pilot, but once it was sold to the network, the actual Monkees re-dubbed the voices. It sounds like Tork to me.

* Monkees Commericals -- 05:50-minutes
Various commercials featuring sponsors Kellogg's and Yardley ""Black Label"" Cologne (I wonder what that smelled like?). Also one TV spot for the show.

* Interview With Song Writer Bobby Hart -- 24:11-minutes (present day)
Hart discusses writing the music for the Monkees and going on tour with them. He also discusses the various Monkees reunions.

* Monkee Memorabilia -- Stills
Various pictures and publicity stills and magazine articles on the group. Also, interoffice memos of actors who auditioned for parts in the Monkees (and for the roles of each Monkee) including remarks like ""too old"" or ""pass"" etc., and it also contains bio information and press releases.

* Romps -- These are the musical numbers that play in the episode and you can choose to watch them alone.

Although there is no ""Play-All"" feature for the episodes, you have to select each episode by itself, you get other extras like trivia and select commentaries. And the menus are cool.

I highly recommend THE MONKEES SEASON 1. Sure it's not very educational, but it'll make you feel good and put a smile on your face.",1341532800,10,3966,4.916167664670659
1796589,5,B00006ZZ05,"I bought both Season 1 and Season 2 from Amazon. They were a fraction of the price of the Monkees boxed set that was released a decade ago by another company. This DVD set was released by Eagle Rock, and they have none of the problems that the previous reviews list. They do not include commercials, the color and sound is perfect, and the boxes are slim and take up little space. Each episode has it's own special features, including trivia about that episode, and a feature where you can watch the episode and hear either one of the Monkees or the director talking to you about the episode while it is playing. It is a cool feature - it is as if that person was sitting in your living room, watching the episode with you.

I was a little nervous about purchasing this set after reading the reviews. As another poster mentioned, I do believe many of these reviews are not referring to this particular set. It is a wonderful set for any Monkee fan and I would highly recommend it.",1340841600,9,980,4.384615384615385

1796617,5,B00006ZZ05,"I'm adding extra kudos to my review after watching several episodes of the Monkees first season. I noticed how good the guest stars are, even the familiar ones who appeared in dozens of shows back then, seem to save their best and sharpest acting for the Monkees show. That's a result of good writing as well as good acting, I believe. Who knew back then at age 11, that not only was it a heart-throb show for pre-teens, but was also a well written adult satire? I can't think of any other children's or teen's show that was also a satisfying adult comedy. Brilliant! And just when it gets a little tiresome, a bit too dated and a bit too silly, it seems to pick up again. So it's still fresh. The four guys are really very good improv actors, that's a greater accomplishment in a way than being good enough to perform in a rock group (which everybody did back then).

Initial Review:

The Monkees TV show seems as fresh as this morning's dew, it's amazing. I watched the show at age 11, when it first came out, and now, I find it just as good. It seems timeless somehow, and the good writing and editing is partly responsible. But the cast is too, all of them good improv actors, in addition to being musicians. That's something I didn't appreciate way back then. I love the madness of each episode, the guest stars are great, and what silliness they get involved in is heartwarming. They do seem like the Marx Brothers a bit, but they're our Marx Brothers, of our time. I never expected to find this show so good, as a kid I loved them because they were popular and I especially liked Peter Tork. Now, I still like him and Mike Nesmith, these guys were cute. I'm glad I bought this set, which is beautifully mounted. The DVD menu controls are a bit cumbersome, but workable.",1331856000,7,1776,4.395136778115502

Amazon needs to clear the reviews out for the old DVDs so people don't get confused and can know if this version is better and/or worth the price!",1330905600,12,446,4.5875
1796619,5,B00006ZZ05,"As of a year I have become a huge Monkee fan, so when I found out I could buy the seasons on DVD I was stoked. I bought the Season 1 DVD and found that I got it about 5 days later, sooner than I was anticipating, which is great! It is a wonderful product. It has all of the first season including the Pilot episode. Some people say that the extra feature of having commentary by Monkee members on certain episodes to be dull. I personally find the commentary to be really interesting, especially Peter Tork's. If you are a Monkee fan I highly recommend getting or at least watching the episodes on DVD; Itunes does not have The Monkees show. Certain channels will play episodes of the show on the weekends but those episodes have been edited to incorporate more commercials. So if you want to watch the full episode I suggest you go for the DVD. And based off of the price each episode comes out to a little over $1, which is cheaper than buying shows on Itunes.",1329004800,6,962,4.291208791208791

I never took the plunge on the 2002 Rhino set due to the price. Then as
the years went by I really couldn't afford the secondary market price.
I bought these DVD sets for me, as a holiday gift to myself, and I
am so glad I did. The Monkees are still such a wonderful escape, even if
just for an hour or two. Truthfully, I thought the color & sound quality was
great, I know that was a complaint with the prior boxsets. The packaging seems
secure, my discs arrived undamaged. Though I'm not nuts about the fact the discs
are stacked two by two in the box, but I guess it's alright? Truthfully, The Monkees
reruns belong back on television again. Unfortunately, it seems highly unlikely,
so if you too love The Monkees buy this set while it's availible & don't miss out.

1796656,4,B00006ZZ05,"The 2003 Rhino release repackaged at half the price - and easier to store.

It seems that I've been prefacing my Amazon reviews a lot lately by stating that Amazon has a dumb policy of grouping reviews of ALL releases of any video. If I film was released on VHS and later on DVD and then on Blu-ray, ALL the reviews appear on all products. So readers should always click on ""Newest First"" and look at date review is posted.

This is the case of this Complete Monkees Season One. The set was released on DVD yesterday by Eagle Rock Entertainment, and yet there are 63 reviews of it going back to 2003, when Rhino first released the six-disc set - in a package that looked like a record play and had a list price of about $89.95. The new set from Eagle Rock comes in a much more conservative foldout digipak and lists for $39.95. After watching much of this new set - and reading details of the prior Rhino release, it most definitely appears that this is just a re-packaging of the earlier set at a price reduction of about 50% - an a package that will be easier to store. All the bonus features are the ones listed for the earlier set. So, if you already own the earlier volume, there is no need to purchase this one. BUT...... if you didn't buy it because of the price, now's your chance.

I was never a huge fan of the show but did watch it occasionally, hoping that there would be lots of musical performances. But there weren't as I learned then and remembered as I watched these DVDs. Most of the music came during the ""romps"" (scenes where Monkee's hits would play in the background. There is an option to just watch the romps on this set (same as earlier one) and they rarely ran much over a minute each.

There is lots of bonus material here with multiple commentaries from the cast or directors. And there are the vintage Kellogg's commercials. But the prints have not been newly remastered and the color quality does vary.

I was attracted to the set to see how much I remembered and to re-watch an episode I remembered well (well, pretty well) with guest star - satirist Stan Freberg. It was nice to see again. And I've spent hours with this set already, hitting the fast forward button only occasionally when things got a bit too ""silly""

I won't rehash comments from many of the reviews from 2003 because they pretty much remain the same. The Monkees were TV icons of the 1960s and have a very strong fan base. That base will want to own this set - again, if they don't have it already.

The sponsor opening/closing credits and the original Screen Gems logo at the end of each show would be nice as well.

With DVD technology, these upgrades from the Rhino VHS set that I bought in the early 1990's should not be a problem.

1796664,5,B00006ZZ05,"I was far too young to watch ""The Monkees"" in prime time, but discovered them at a young age in syndication on a local independent UHF television station after school at 3:30 in the afternoon. This box set is a great, though imperfect, treat. Realize that the set contains six DVDs and a thin pamphlet, though the packaging is quite large. The quality of the images is generally good, but some episodes are decidedly worse than others, and it would have been nice to see them cleaned up. Likewise, the audio is sometimes uneven. Having said that, the pros far outweigh the cons here: I was thrilled to see the original episodes as they aired in the correct order, and was especially amused by the presence of the Kellogg's advertisements.

I had forgotten how many great guest stars the show featured. Stars like Lon Chaney, Rose Marie, Richard Kiel, Mike Farrell, and fellow singing sensation and future deputy sheriff Bobby Sherman predominate. As if that wasn't enough, there's even an episode with both Foster Brooks as a drunken rabbit breeder and comic Doodles Weaver (Sigourney's uncle) as a Broadway producer (""Monkees in Manhattan."") (As a strange aside, if you want a truly otherworldly listening experience, find a copy of Doodles Weaver singing ""Eleanor Rigby."" You won't be disappointed.)

The shows all center around the four struggling musicians, and while the show was nominally made to capitalize on the success of the Beatles, realize that the show was originally formulated before the stateside success of Beatles; it took the success of the Fab Four to make studio execs sit up and take note of the potential market. Each episode (except ""Monkees on Tour"") features musical ""romps"" (which are viewable by themselves as a special feature.) While I always liked the music, and while these fast-cut segments define the look of the show, they are fairly repetitive and are now my least part of the episodes. What I remembered loving as a kid, and I appreciate even more now, are the peculiar characters and rather stream-of-consciousness approach in the writing, along with numerous excellent one liners and some sly humor that escaped me as a child (e.g. dominoes as a metaphor for the Vietnam War.)

There are too many examples of great gags to cite, but there are some that I particularly like on reflection. Peter is at one point asked ""How do you feel about demonstrations?"" He replies ""They're the only way to sell a vacuum cleaner."" It was a great way to make you think the writers were going to go for a political joke, and then rip the carpet out from under the premise. In the ""Fern and Davy"" episode we are introduced to a variety of terrible performers, among which is Mike as ""Billy Roy Hodstetter"" singing a hilarious version of ""Different Drum,"" which of course Nesmith wrote, and which became a huge hit for Linda Ronstadt. It also introduced a unique nutritional supplement, ""Sdrawkcab"" (which is, of course, ""Backwards"" backwards...other supplements contain iron, but iron can rust, so Sdrawkcab contains aluminum.) These peculiar turns of phrase and in-jokes fly fast and loose throughout the show. Another great example is in ""Monkees at the Circus"" where Mickey keeps singing the theme song to ""Circus Boy"" and is continually quizzed about what he's singing. (Dolenz starred as a child actor in ""Circus Boy."")

The ability to lampoon various genres is another hallmark of the series, and I especially liked the superhero duo of ""Frogman and Reuben the Tadpole"" who have a wonderful Batman-style fight. (""Kretch?"") Nesmith was very comfortable improvising and slipping into his Texan persona: the children's story about the ""Wicked Stepladder"" made me laugh out loud, as did his ""Farm Report"" ad libs. One of the best episodes, ""Monkees a la Mode"" features the wonderful characters of Madame Quagmire and Rob Roy Fingerhead who work for ""Chic"" magazine. It's clear from the outset where the conflict will originate from and what the boys will have to do, but their execution of the plan is especially ingenious and well-crafted. The final episode of the season ""The Monkees on Tour"" is especially good and introspective. The live concert footage (from a Phoenix show) is great, though you almost can't hear the songs over the screaming. It is clear that the four had melded into a true performing band at that point, even if they didn't start out that way. The set features commentary by various people on various episodes, including all the Monkees except for Dolenz, as well as people like director James Frawley and songwriter Bobby Hart. Though the commentary tracks are not groundbreaking (a few are downright boring) I enjoyed them, and especially liked the recollections of Jones and Nesmith.

Not long ago I had the privilege of meeting and talking with Davy Jones. He was exceptionally friendly and genuine. Davy rekindled my interest in seeing these shows again, after which I only had one thought: what took me so long?",1289952000,5,4966,4.9496402877697845
1796685,5,B00006ZZ05,"I knew going into this that there would be problems.  First, the transfer could use serious improvement (look what they've done with Pride & Prejudice).  This classic deserves a new Blue-Ray transfer, color correction, and soundtrack cleanup.  The packaging may have been promotionally 'cute' when it came out; but with DVD storage space at a premium, a new release would be better served by a more modern package.  Could have used Woodstock's 'scratches in fine leather' quote.  And, while I found both seasons, mint, at a reasonable price, I would not hesitate to purchase an additional, improved, set should it be made available (Are You Listening Rhino?).

All the jokes and gags, all the audience laughter, and the wonderful music; took me back like no other show from my childhood.  A cartoon with live actors (Like Red Green).  Funny, charming, zany, cool.  Davey, Peter, Mike and Mickey were both comic actors and musicians.  While they became a serious band in their later days, this show had deep roots in comedy.  It was a simpler time, which is well reflected by the series.  Ah, those were the days.  The Monkees lead me to my very first guitar, a Sears Silvertone (Just like Glenn Campbell & Jimi Hendrix).

1796691,5,B00006ZZ05,"My dad didn't install an outdoor TV antenna on our house, until the spring of '69. So, our family was stuck watching shows on CBS until then, since we couldn't pick-up other networks 'til the antenna was installed. As a result, I had to watch the ""Monkees"" on Saturday mornings, when they were in re-runs on CBS, starting in 1968.

The ""Monkees"" was a cutting-edge sitcom for its time. The 60s were a new era in pop-culture, television included. So, the ""Monkees"" fit right in to the new generational zeitgeist, that took over America during the mid-60s.

The show was meant to be a spoof of a rock-band, who lived together in a cool beach house. The ""Monkees"" were 4 young, good-looking dudes on-the-loose. They never had to answer to any authority figures, such as parents, teachers, etc. That factor alone, made them popular with their youthful viewer-ship. And this was a show aimed right at the under-22 demographic, during the swinging 60s.

The ""Monkees"" consisted of Mike Nesmith on guitar, Peter Tork on bass, Mickey Dolenz as their drummer, and Davey Jones as their lead-singer (a role he shared with Mickey Donlenz). It was always fun to watch their zany, Marx-brothers-like brand of slap-stick antics. They had a wonderful, on-screen chemistry going on between them all. Instead of relying on funny dialog, the ""Monkees"" series ran on the strength of the group's highly energetic performances. Each episode revolved around the group getting into hilarious misadventures, but coming-out unscathed in the end.

The group also performed their hit songs in every episode. Most of the ""Monkees"" songs were written by some very talented composers, including Neil Diamond, and Boyce & Hart. And so, the Monkees had many chart-topping hits during the 60s.

Some have said that the ""Monkees"" were an insignificant part of the 60s music scene. I disagree. Their show was the early template that paved the way for later sitcoms about rock music, such as the Partridge Family. Most importantly, the ""Monkees"" series was pioneering, since it linked the concept of visual performances set to pop music. Without this show, there probably never would've been MTV.

As for me, I really looked forward to my sugar-laden bowl of cereal, while watching the ""Monkees"" every Saturday morning as a youngster. Both the cereal, and the show, always got me stoked with plenty of energy!",1262044800,,2372,4.992405063291139

US customers have a few options:
Check if your current DVD player is region free. Many new DVD players are. You can buy region free players here on Amazon (starting at about $50).  Search for ""region free dvd player"" or ""codefree"".  Make sure it's in the description.

Otherwise you can search the web for a hack code at your own risk to unlock the restriction.

Downside is that it is a big cute box, 7cm x 15cm x 15cm, and mine got damaged a little in the post and required re-gluing. The actual DVD's are all in their own little cardboard miniature `Record' sleeves, great little facsimiles of the Monkees LP covers, fitted into a removable little `record deck' outer cardboard case that slots into the portable `record player' box. So a lot of the DVD box is air and the odd spring. All the episodes 1 to 32 from the first series are here, first aired from Sept 1996 to April 1967, and they are spread over 6 DVDs. The final DVD also has a few extras, like the Kellogs commercials, discography, play songs only, Monkees commentaries, interview with songwriter Bobby Hart, and a Monkees memorabilia gallery. The set also has little booklet of the chapter indexes and a short `behind the scenes' written piece that's quite interesting (I didn't realise Mickey and Davy were only 20 when picked or that the Monkees concept wasn't nicked from the Beatles film `Hard Days Night' - one of the creators, Bob Rafelson, had toured with a struggling young band in 1962 and got the idea then). See tvtome for the actual episode list. We find the picture/sound fine, particularly on our small bedroom TVs. There is also a similar `record player' DVD set for season two.

My daughter (12) likes the Monkees and has watched most of the episodes - but not as much as her original 4 episode DVD `The Monkees our favourite episodes' - NTSC as well - so perhaps she has suffered from Monkees overload fatigue (and she has since fallen under the spell of the Charmed ones). She also has the CD set `The definitive Monkees - limited edition' which she really likes. She became a fan after singing 'I'm a believer' in the school Choir.

After reading some of the reviews here, I was expecting to be a bit disappointed by the sound and picture quality but, apart from over-saturation of colour in some episodes, (which could be an product of the NTSC translation)  so far I haven't found this release to be anywhere near as 'bad' as others have done.

I have, for comparison, some episodes saved on  my Sky Plus hard drive recorder (like TiVo only better) when Disney Channel screened them in the UK about 12-18 months ago. These are definitely cleaner versions than in the Rhino box set BUT the Rhino ones are perfectly acceptable, in my view.

Let's face it, there is no alternative at the moment - and definitely not at this price. Even after I got stung for some customs duty (about 9 in total) I still thought I'd got a bargain.

So if you're in the UK, and can play Region 1 and NTSC, I'd say buy with confidence.",1114473600,11,1170,4.286363636363636

1796723,5,B00006ZZ05,"Rhino has always done a stellar job with just about everything they've gotten their hands on, and the two seasons of The Monkees are no exception. I agree with the one reviewer who asked why the ""updated"" soundtracks couldn't have been included (as in, summer repeats with newer songs, for those of us who also remember ""Midnight Train"" in the ""Chaperone"" episode and so on)...other than that MINOR complaint...the shows are there, in order, and they look about as good as can be expected...nice work, Rhino...and GREAT touch adding ""33 1/3rd Revolutions"" to season two as well as the Kellogg's and Yardley ads...excellent touches! If you're a Monkees fan, don't miss this!",1093996800,12,673,5.017857142857143
1796724,4,B00006ZZ05,"Its great to finally see the Monkees on DVD! I loved this show as a child, I watched it in reruns on Nickelodeon and MTV in the 80s. Sure, I was around 5 or 6, but I loved the show, I thought Micky, Peter, Mike and Davy were adorable, and the music was really good. Of course I've caught the show on TV since then, and I remember they had a special in 1996 or 1997 where they attempted to re-do the Monkees (apparently they tried this in the 1980's as ""The New Monkees"" which didn't last.. and neither did this remake)

 I think what made the Monkees work, was that there were 4 cute, young guys, each of whom appealed to a vareity of people in their own way. Micky was the zany sort of Jerry Lewis like character with his slapstick. Peter was the ""dummy"", Mike was the strong silent type, or the mature one, and Davy was the short, cute ""teen idol"" of the group. I think I liked every one of the boys at some point. But I think Mike is my favorite. :)

 Also the entire idea of the show worked (all the silly comedic hijinks) because of the innocence of Micky, Mike, Peter and Davy, and of course the music was solid as well. I think one thing about the Monkees that I love also- are the outfits. This is a time when people actually dressed up on TV, even if their clothes were ""funny"" for the time. I think they all look handsome all dressed up. I wish people would do that today on TV!

 Onto the DVD- again its great to see this show in DVD finally, its a classic. As silly and unreal as it is, it works. Now, there are a few things that annoy me about this DVD. You cannot ""PLAY ALL EPISODES""(if there is a way someone PLEASE post it!) - you can ""Play all Romps"" which is great, but this is a show I'd like to watch and then have on in the background, and you can't do that because once an episode ends it returns to the title screen where you have to pick another episode.

 Another semi-annoying thing is that there isn't commentary on each episode. Only a handful have cometary from Peter, Mike, Davy, James Frawley and Rafelson. Which is fine, but some episodes have multiple tracks, so that 2 people are commenting on the same episode but on different tracks, so you have to watch an entire episode twice to hear each persons comentary.

 On a high note, I do like the packaging of little 45 records and a record holder. Very unique. Also I know some have complained about the quality of the DVD. I think its fine, I don't really notice a lot of ""noise"" or ""dust"" unless I'm watching it on a computer DVD player. Other than that, it doesn't look bad at all on TV. Remember, these films are almost 40 YEARS OLD! So you can't expect it to be perfect, even if coming from the masters. The sound is good, it isn't perfect, but again its almost 40 years old as well, that includes the songs. They are a little noisy, but again if that really bothers you, check out a Monkees CD for the music.

 I think overall this DVD set is worth owning. The show is still entertaining after all these years, even though its a bit silly with its slapstick humour. But I enjoy the show, and the songs- I believe the Monkees were pioneers for the whole music video age, and this was WAY before your MTV and your VH1! I hope this helps in your decision to purchase this DVD!",1090281600,10,3262,4.185007974481659

At first glance, it doesn't look like it would be funny to a 19 year old. I'm not saying it's falling over hilarious, but it certainly keeps you smiling. Some of the stuff they get away with alone is laugh worthy. If nothing else you're thinking ""What in the world are they doing?"". ""Too Many Girls"" and ""Monkees On The Line"" are two of my favorites. First season is more formula than second season, but it also has more of the guys when they still liked each other. Peter's commentary is enlightening and really funny.

1796738,4,B00006ZZ05,"NO WAY!!!  This might be the greatest packaging for a boxed set ever.  Who says it does not fit?  It will fit on any shelf I have in my house, including some that regular DVD's are too tall for.  So it is not as tall as the others, so what?  Moving on to what's important.
When you open the box there are six sleeves, each containing a disc.  This can be a problem if you don't know how to treat things.  I recommed before sliding a disc back into the sleeve that you make sure there are no loose materials inside the sleeve that will rub against the finish of the DVD and scratch it.  That is really all that can happen, otherwise it's 100% perfect.  Hint or word to the wise; Don't eat around your DVD's anyway and you won't drop foreign particles into the sleeves or get grease on the cardboard.
The extra minute of footage not originally aired on some of the episodes was completely amazing to see.  This includes Mike and Davy's screen tests.  Hilarious and spontaneous.  The picture is fabulous and the audio is great too.
When you are watching and it appears that they are not playing or singing the correct things and words it's not the audio track. lol...  That's how they were originally released.  It gets four stars from me because it lacks subtitles.  If you want to watch this quietly to avoid bothering roommates or can't understand what they are saying, too bad.  And you can forget about other languages.  This does not really bother me but I am fair to the needs of all when reviewing commerical items for mass consumption.

I know, it's kind irrelevant in music dvds to have captions, but it would have been nice to be able to understand 100% of what they're saying....or maybe it's my boxset that is defective?

1796740,4,B00006ZZ05,"What a fabulous box set. The episodes are still extremely funny and childlike in a good way and I especially love the time filling slots where they talking about themselves - Davys stories about going home are so English and easy for me to associate with the humour 36 years on! I wish they had done more of this as these clips are too short.  Would also have been good to see Peter and Mickys screen tests.
The adverts are a bit weathered but really funny ""Ricey bubbles so crisp and nourishing, Eat'em every day!"".  Had me in stitches!!
Shame that some of the songs were different and that there was no commentary from Micky.  Also it would have been nice to see a face to face interview with each of them talking about what they've done since the Monkees rather than just the usual ""manufactured image"" ""its like Leonard Nimoy really becoming a Vulcan"" stuff.
The packaging is a bit flimsy - think they need to rethink that for next time - Please Please Please !!  mine has to travel to England!! At least a paper sleeve for each disc so it doesn't scratch? Go on - push the boat out!
Cant wait for season two - I like the contrast in their image and seeing them take the mickey out of their original style of show - its time for the Monkee Scare - ahhhh!  I think ive fancied them all at some stage (except Micky - sorry!) but I have to say that if I was the woman on the black label advert there is no way i'd have ran past Mike Nesmith!!

1796742,5,B00006ZZ05,"The Monkees TV program ran for two seasons, combining comedy and music, to present a unique view of the 60's pop culture, focusing on the adventures of an aspiring Southern California band.  Wacky, unconventional, spontaneous, outrageous, irreverent, and fun, are just a few of the adjectives that could be used to describe the world of the Monkees.  Then as now, the reasons for this program's appeal, lies with their music, and the intrinsic charm, and talent of the members of the group.  Modeled on the Beatles' film, A Hard Days Night, the Monkees won an Emmy for best comedy program, in its first season.
Circumstances brought together relative unknowns, Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork, Davy Jones, and Mike Nesmith, to play roles as members of a rock group.  Who could predict the phenomenon that this fortuitous casting would come to produce?  Transcending their TV roles to become a ""real"" band, writing and playing their own music, achieving worldwide success, and turning fiction into fact.
Much has been said about the Monkees' music, which originally consisted of their vocals being recorded over music played by studio musicians.  As the original concept was for a fictitious rock group, this approach to music making was a most natural one.  Top songwriters were recruited to pen material for the group.  ""Manufactured"" or not, their fans didn't care, and the results are hard to argue with, as the Monkees had a string of hits produced in just this matter.  A fact that irks critics immensely.  Season one's final episode, which shows the events taking placing before an actual Monkee concert, provides real insight into their lives, and has three separate commentary tracks as well.
The DVD set is not inexpensive, and served up in one 32 episode dose, is a bit too much for the casual fan.  This is one set that is definitely for the true fan, with material running over 13 hours.  The transfers are very good, with just a few signs of deterioration.  Commentary tracks by Peter, Davy, Mike, director Bob Rafelson, and songwriter Bobby Hart, provide different insights into selected episodes.  Unfortunately, there is no commentary from the ""voice of the Monkees"", Mickey Dolenz.
The extras are only semi satisfying, and could have been much better and more comprehensive.  A retrospective documentary, where we could hear from the guys, and see them as they look today, would have been great.  The closest we get, is Bobby Hart's recollection of events.  For those interested in reading rather obscure, often inane trivia, such is provided for each episode.  Some discs as an extra, feature a compilation of the musical ""romps"" from the episodes on the disc.  Better than nothing, but just barely.
Many have commented on the ""creative"" packaging of the set, in which the six discs are inserted into album sleeves, and placed into a cardboard box resembling a portable phonograph.  It's all very cute, but not the most practical design for long term storage.  Expect something similar for Season 2.
The Monkees remind us of a time, when life seemed much simpler, with an idealistic perspective that never gets too heavy or into the dark side of life.  While the number of episodes may overwhelm some, true fans rejoice and eagerly await Season 2.  Can you dig it?",1058486400,2,3276,4.95970695970696
1796743,4,B00006ZZ05,"This review will mainly be a critique of the actual contents of this package--The Monkees' first season--and not so much a review of the box itself (that will come at the very end).  At the time of its airing, ""The Monkees"" was first regarded as an interesting curiosity (the first time rock music and rock bands were the focus of a sitcom), then as a bunch of ridiculous bubblegum hype with musicians who didn't even play their own instruments (which was not true, of course).  But in retrospect it has been revered as a mostly successful experiment that featured four very talented young men impersonating a band--The Beatles--that was very hard to impersonate, with some great music to match.
""The Monkees""--its first season in particular--really does play like a colorized, slightly updated 1966 version of ""A Hard Day's Night"", replete with zany edits, fast-forwards, in-jokes and self-references (they frequently comment directly at the camera), playful social commentary (esp towards the older generation) and pioneering music video bits.  A lot of this was extremely pioneering for television, which makes the show still watchable today, even if some of the humor (esp that taken from the traditional sitcom format of the time) now seems old-fashioned.  What's even better, all four Monkees are very
charismatic; Nesmith's dry, countrified style is my favorite (he's also easily my favorite musician in the band), but all three are fine (even Jones!), and they work brilliantly together, as if having performed for years. The first season got better and better as it progressed, as well, with the scripts eventually dropping a lot of the old-fashioned humor in favor of the ""hip""
expressions and humor of the mid-to-late Swinging 60s (which may still look old-fashioned to observers 40 years later, unless they are--like me--big fans of the decade).
The Monkees were considered a bubblegum act during their day, but that was largely because of their reputation of having been pre-fabricated by TV producers, and partly due to the Jones-sung ballads.  However, if any other band had come out at the time with their image and songs, they would probably have been well-respected.  The first season wardrobe of paisley and flower-print shirts (as well as the famous six-button, vaguely western uniform), checkered and striped pants, enormous belt buckles and green granny glasses was very 1966, heavily influenced by what was going on in Swinging London and Los Angeles as ""mod"" gradually turned into ""hippie"".  The music, too, was very contemporary, encompassing folk-rock, country-rock (the group, and Nesmith in particular, was very pioneering in this respect), UK Beatle-esque pop (esp from the 65-66 period), ballads, hard garage rock (""She"", ""Words"", ""Mary Mary"", ""Stepping Stone"") and even proto-psychedelia (""Take A Giant Step"", ""This Just Doesn't Seem To Be My Day"").  All the songs were written by excellent writing teams (including Nesmith, who provides some classic tunes in the form of ""Sweet Young Thing"", ""Mary Mary"", ""Papa Gene's Blues"" and ""You Just May Be The One"") and are very slickly produced, which actually put them ahead of many bands of the time.  Although it is true that they do not play the instruments on the studio records during the first season, they soon rectified that situation for ""Headquarters"" and they did play live on tour, which is documented in the season closer that has become celebrated as one of their best episodes.
The second season would see the band become full-fledged hippies (actually, the word ""hippie"" makes a hilarious first appearance here in an episode filmed in November of '66 entitled ""I Was A Teenage Monster), with the plots and filming style becoming even more surreal and self-referential and some drug humor subtly laced in--but that's for another review, hopefully soon!  In closing, Rhino did a fair job in releasing the set (the picture quality is the best I've ever seen it, and as good as it's ever going to get), although the price is, as mentioned, very steep; I, too, would rather have ditched the elaborate box packaging in favor of a cut price. The commentaries are sometimes good, sometimes bad, and the 5.1 sound doesn't really work, but these are minor quibbles--the episode trivia is very thorough and the chance to see the original unaired version of the pilot (even with the poor print) is pretty cool.  Anyways, one star knocked off for the price, and because they also could have included alternate versions of the romps shown in syndication that featured different songs from the very great ""Headquarters"" period.",1057622400,5,4602,5.1226666666666665
1796744,3,B00006ZZ05,"Just to point out that the picture suffers from what (to me at least) is the worse kind of DVD picture defect. It's the kind where, in order to save space on the disc, stills are used as backgrounds giving the picture a wholly artificial look. For sure, a lot of people won't be bothered by any of these flaws. But it's clear how the picture has been taken apart and put together again by the way moving objects (e.g. someone walking across a room) look superimposed on the background. Objects with sharp edges look as though they've been 'cut & pasted' onto the picture, reminiscent of a bad computer game. Tell-tale 'difficult' shots, such as trees and ocean scenes, are particularly poorly handled.",1056844800,5,701,4.661290322580645

1796766,4,B00006ZZ05,"This box set from Rhino has been worth the wait for Monkees fans.  The audio and video are excellent for the most part, which make these first season episodes a pleasure to watch.  The picture quality is so good that you will see things in the background that you have never noticed before, even if you've seen the episodes dozens of times.
The packaging for this six-disc set is outstanding.  The box looks like a little record player and the discs are inside little cardboard sleeves that replicate actual Monkee 45s.
Select episodes have audio commentary from various people connected with the Monkees, except for Micky Dolenz who is sorely missed.  He was hilarious on the audio commentary for the ""Daydream Believers"" DVD and would have had some entertaining things to say about these episodes.  Here's hoping he will be on the second series box set.
The booklet that comes with the set is a bit lacking but the discs make up for this by including trivia on each episode from a well-known Monkee website.  However, some trivia that has previously not been seen before would have been nice.
When I reviewed Rhino's Monkees Volume One & Two on Amazon, I mentioned several things that I thought would make good extras when the entire Monkees series came out on DVD.  Rhino has lived up to most of my expectations, including putting the alternate version of the pilot in the set and most of the Monkees TV commercials.  That being said, most of the commercials are of poor quality and look like they were taken off of a bootleg tape called ""Secret Video Files"" that is in wide circulation among Monkee fans.  I still appreciate them being included though.  I was also a bit disappointed that the episodes did not feature the alternate music soundtracks from reruns and syndication.
Despite these minor flaws, here's hoping the same creative people work on the release and packaging of the Monkees Season Two DVD set.",1056067200,3,1917,4.764350453172206
1796767,3,B00006ZZ05,"What do you actually get for shelling out this much money?
Here are the good things to say about this set, and Rhino's work on it:
1. They actually released it, and it has all the episodes of the first season included in order, with the original songs, and in vibrant color. This earns it most of the points, and is the only real reason to buy this.
2. It includes commercials, and the pilot episode with Boyce & Hart singing the soundtrack, and text trivia screens about each episode.
Here is what I see wrong with this set in no particular order:
The commercials and Boyce & Hart pilot are pretty bad quality copies. The box set video, while mostly vibrant throughout, still includes dust and hairs sometimes. The audio quality never gets above mediocre, and sometimes is either tinny and harsh, or muddy and mushy. The Rhino Monkee audio CDs sound terrific, as do most Rhino CDs. I have not been at all impressed with any Rhino audio on other DVDs so far, and  these DVD 5.1 soundtracks are worthless--and the mono isn't much better. Why couldn't they have just done a decent plain stereo mix from the master tapes Rhino had access to for all the Monkee CDs?
I agree with a previous review comparing what was done with the old Beatles Anthology audio and video, and should have been done on this set. The volume levels are all over the place in this set too. The dialog is mostly quiet so you crank it up to hear, and then the romp music is too much louder. But what is really bad, the menu music level just blasts in comparison to the episodes. So, because you can't just set it to play all the episodes at once, the menu comes back after each one and you turn it down while the menu plays, then turn it back up for the episodes, and so on, very annoying.
No commentary from Dolenz, but if he had as little to say as what is included from the others, we're not missing much. This is some of the most boring and uninformative commentary you will ever sit through. As implied in other reviews, basically any of us could have given these commentaries (many of you much better)--and we weren't even there! You may as well say there is no booklet either, something this small and uninformative in a set this big, at this cost, is unbelievable. The Monkee CD booklets put this to shame.
The most outragious aspect of this set, and the single reason Rhino so overpriced it for what little work they actually seemed to put into the episodes--the packaging. We are paying for AIR.  The expensive (probably about a third of the cost at least) 3 inch deep box holding six discs and a booklet that are 3/4 inches deep. That's 2 1/4 inches of premium wasted shelf space for air. The cute sleeves inside don't protect the discs, they scuff them sliding in and out--so you have to supply your own safe way to store them yourself. Nice way to give people value for their money Rhino.
Yeah, I'll still get season two reluctantly when it comes out--because I want all the episodes. But I hate rewarding Rhino anymore for lackluster work packaged in an over-sized, overpriced, impractical holder.
We deserve better, and I feel we have already paid for better, but didn't get it.",1055548800,269,3163,4.470588235294118

1796769,4,B00006ZZ05,"I picked up this set with great anticipation.  I loved these shows as a kid, stayed up for the marathon in the 80's to video tape them off MTV, and eventually got both seasons from Columbia House Home Video.
With all the recent technical advances these should have blown me away, like the Beatles Anthology set did.  However, it appears Rhino didn't do any restoration at all to these shows, and used the exact tapes they did with the Columbia House videos.  While DVD technology does make the pictures clearer, they still have many spots and flaws throughout like copies of films shown on old movie projectors.  Even the ending credits on the first episode skip several seconds, like a bad 45.  Couldn't they find better copies out there somewhere?
Yes, the special features are interesting.  But why is the 16mm pilot black and purple?  Same thing can be said about the commercials.  I've seen better copies of these at the Monkees conventions BEFORE DVD's even existed.
Restoration can be done - check out ""Strawberry Fields"" (or any other video clip) from the Beatles Anthology.  That stuff is as old, or older than these shows.  Hardly any flaws are on the Beatles Anthology.
The sound doesn't blow me away either, especially how the volume fluctuates in ""Last Train to Clarksville""  in ""The Monkees at the Movies"".  The soundtrack still sounds better to me on the Columbia House videos.
They did put the set in an interesting box - probably spent their budget on it, rather than improving the video quality.  While visually cute, it's a bad design.  It doesn't fit in the shelf with all the rest of your DVD' collection, and, even though the box is large, there's no protection for the DVD's.  They slide out and stay in the cardboard holder when you pull out the 'record' cover, or you end up putting fingerprints on them trying to get them out if they do stay inside.  The box itself will self-destruct if you aren't careful because the upper lid is larger than the lower.  You can't open and close it very often before a corner will split (mine actually came damaged from delivery in the mail).
To say I'm very disappointed is an understatement.  I hope they get their act together for Season Two (and re-do this one, too).
I'm giving it 4 stars since I really do love the shows.  If I graded it on quality, it would get 2 stars.",1054339200,202,2338,4.603864734299517
1796770,4,B00006ZZ05,"Hey, what can you say BAD about a DVD box with ALL the episodes of Season One of The Monkees? Not much! The shows themselves are a JOY to watch in the newly restored glory. Unlike most hardcore Monkees fans, I've always preferred Season One over Season Two (sure, some of Season One's episodes are goofy, but Season Two - while showcasing the superior tunes - just gets a little too self-indulgent at times for my delecate palate). Having said that, I STILL can't wait for Season Two!
Now, the minuses. The packaging, while certainly cute, is not very user-friendly or storage-friendly. If you're a 'cute gimmick' fan, you'll love it. If you're more inclined to appreciate practicality, get out the swear word thesaurus.
Unfortunately, I'm guessing it's the gimmicky packaging that has pushed the price tag into the upper-stratosphere. Compare the cost of this box to OTHER single-season DVD compilations and you'll see what I mean;...P>... Even if you're NOT hip to these things, buy it anyway!

1796771,4,B00006ZZ05,"Overall, I think Rhino's Monkees First Season DVD box is very well done.  But, there is one major aspect of the Monkees TV show that I wish Rhino considered when they compiled this collection:
As you may know, many of the songs played during the ""Monkee-Romps "" were changed when the show was rerun during the summer of 1967, and some were changed again when the show was shown on Saturday mornings.  In many cases, it was these re-worked shows that were included when the show went into syndication in the 1970's.  Since many of us grew up with the syndicated versions, it would have been nice for Rhino to include them on this set.  It gets a bit tedious to have to sit through ""Last Train to Clarksville"" or ""I'm a Believer"" for the umpteenth time.  Since DVDs are capable of containing many soundtracks, it would have been fun to have ""You Told Me"", ""Forget That Girl"", ""Shades of Gray"", ""For Pete's Sake"" and ""Steam Engine"" available on this collection.  (These songs only appeared in the syndicated episodes while the songs they replaced could be found on other episodes.)  As a result of Rhino not including the alternate soundtracks, the wonderful Headquarters album doesn't get much representation here at all...
Apart from this, the set boasts very handsome packaging.  The record player design is just as novel as the TV set design the old VHS box had (but the booklet included in the video box was much better than the small pamphlet included here).  As others have mentioned, the DVDs *do* fall out of the cases rather easily.  To solve this problem, I placed the DVDs into some CD-ROM sleeves that were handy.  This works well and keeps the DVDs from rolling across the floor when you take them out.
I also liked the commentaries, although Micky's absence from the proceedings is unfortunate...  I hope he turns up on the second season box, as it would be sad if he didn't provide commentary on the episode he co-wrote & directed!  (I also hope Peter provides commentary on the episode he directed!)
So, I think this is a very good collection, but with a little more thought on Rhino's part, it could have been a bit better for those of us who grew up with the Monkees every day after school (when the show was in syndication).",1053648000,30,2241,4.614609571788413
1796772,4,B00006ZZ05,"Micky and even David did not take part on any commentary. The episodes were in the best shape that I have ever seen them... I liked the MONKEES GET OUT MORE DIRT episode.. Seeing those 4 guys go after April was a riot! The picture was crystal clear! You can really see the wires that they had Micky hooked up to!
Seeing the pilot in the MM format gave me a bit of a headache! I am glad that the pilot had the Monkees doing the songs in the finished product...
The Monkees in Concert was amazing to see and watching this makes me think about my concert experiences with the Monkees.. I cried when Micky did his James Brown bit and at the end when the show was over... Looking back on that last one, they STILL kept that same magic right through the final tour in 2001..
I agree about the little disc covers for the set... Take special care when taking out the discs... All in all, I am glad to have this set... Columbia House lost out on this gem...  The old Record player box was rather nice...
I hope that the specials, music videos from the 80s, and Heart & Soul Videography go for the DVD treatment next...OH... Be sure to enclude the Christmas video from MTV too... It had all the Monkees in that one..
It was good to see the interviews on how the Monkees happened, and I really look forward to Season 2.. I hope that Micky and Davy will do some commentary on that disc... Till Season 2 comes out... I will be really enjoying this firat set...",1053475200,5,1447,4.223826714801444
1796773,5,B00006ZZ05,"I give Rhino credit, they did an outstanding job on this set.  The episodes look great and the commentaries were excellent.  I was very pleased to see Nez comment on a couple of episodes since he is so often absent from modern Monkee projects.  Both Nez and Peter give some nice insight to the Monkees on Tour episode.  It would have been great to hear all four comment on the craziness of touring, but that is a minor gripe.
Listening to Peter's commentary my wife noted that ""Peter doesn't really like Mike does he?"".  Like his commentary from Daydream Believers, Peter is often out front with his assessment of Nez.
David also has some nice commentary and he seems to really enjoy watching and remembering the show.  Actually they all seem to enjoy it and you can feel the pride in the work they did.
Sadly Dolenz isn't involved in any commentary.  Apparently he was unavailable which is too bad because his commentary on the VH1 Daydream Believers was a riot.  He really needs to comment on Frodis in season two, even if Rhino has to hold the set up to get him.
The photo gallery, which I expect many will skip over contains some very cool scans, including ""grading"" sheets of many that tried out for the show.  Some interesting tidbits come out of this including the fact that not only did a number of females try out, but at least one was seriously considered and apparently turned it down because she didn't want to commit to a series.
As for season two, like many I hope Rhino includes 33 1/3 in addition to the 80's and 90's music videos.  I guess while we are dreaming, one of the concerts (Billboard Live) with all four guys would be perfect.  Then there is the ABC reunion special. Yeah, I know I can only dream.  I imagine if we don't get these items tagged onto the season two box we never will.  Now is a good time to write Rhino and ask (or beg).
As for the actual packaging.  As many have mentioned it is modeled after a 1960's phonograph and looks very cool.  The problem is it won't match any other boxed DVD set you have, nor will it fit well on your DVD shelf.  ""No big deal"" I say, let's just stick it with The Monkees CD's.  Not so fast, it's too big for that shelf.  So I give Rhino 5 stars for creativity and take back half a star for the impractical nature of the box.  I imagine the stores that sell these things will find the odd size annoying also.",1053388800,5,2377,4.3250564334085775
1796774,3,B00006ZZ05,"Monkees fans should know that Rhino had an opportunity to use an improved 16mm print of the unaired pilot to the show featuring the vocals of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart for this boxed set.  Unfortunately due to their reluctance in communication they missed their opportunity to provide fans with a second, better quality, and slightly different version of the pilot on this DVD set.  Now all fans will get for their money is the same version of the unaired pilot already issued years ago on the video box set and this new historic film print will remain unreleased.",1053388800,5,565,4.696969696969697

The video and sound quality are not as good as I would have hoped, and the case is very flimsy and it's difficult to get some of the discs out. I will probably store the discs in a different case rather than deal with this one. The Monkees show is 5/5 stars though so I added an extra star to the rating just because I love them so much.

7973419,5,B00006ZZ05,"The Monkees: Season 1 is 830 minutes and was released on DVD September 27, 2011. Include in this set are all 32 episodes on six discs. Disc 1 through five have six episodes each and disc 6 has the last two episodes plus bonus features and an interview with Bobby Hart. I enjoy watching the episodes and was shock at the opening of the show. I was so used to seeing Peter then one of the other Monkees then finally Peter is introduced. The only down side to this collection are the commentaries. The four Monkees and Bob Rafelson do not do a good job at this. James Frawley does a little better job. Not till you get to the final episode of Monkees on Tour that Bobby Hart does a great job on the commentary. The Zilch pod staff do a much better job. The Monkees: Season 1 is great to watch for those who still do not on a Blue Ray recorder. The Monkees: Season 1 DVD gets an AAAAA+++++",1514678400,,885,4.151162790697675

7973424,3,B00006ZZ05,"When I first had the problem I encountered with this set I turned to the comments section here hoping to find some information on it.  Instead I've stumbled onto the biggest collection of worthless ""reviews"" I've ever read.  Folks, this isn't ebay.  We aren't reviewing the seller in the product review.  Single word ""reviews"" like ""excellent""  or ""I bought this for someone"" do nothing to help a potential customer determine if they want to purchase something.

The only reason this set doesn't receive 5 stars from me is because discs 2 and 3 are unplayable.  They aren't dirty either.  The discs look flawless so it must be a lowest bidder manufacturing issue.  Not a fan of the customer service either as they won't send replacement discs 2 and 3, instead they want me to mail the whole set back for a refund.  So I guess I'm supposed to order this again and hope the next set doesn't have this issue so I can watch the 12 episodes I'm missing out on?  Pass.  Not interested in the manufacturing defect merry go round.  You resellers need a better solution than this.

Other than that...this is a good quality product.  I don't know what people are complaining about with sound issues, I didn't experience them.  The material looks just fine, especially considering it's from 1966.  Yes the box isn't the best for storing them but replacement cases are cheap.

Also a word out to Rhino or whomever the rights holder is for this content.  Who buys DVDs any more?  Get this content in download format on amazon prime or itunes or netflix.",1498262400,2,1540,4.654275092936803
