Although it is enjoyable, I don't like that the trailers are mixed in with the news reels. I was also disappointed that the songs are not video clips from her movies they are only in audio. I liked the ""Marilyn at the movies dvd much better"" but if you don't already have MM's songs on cd you may also like this..",1132012800,9,493,4.2
