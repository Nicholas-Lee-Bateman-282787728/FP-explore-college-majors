This has to be my favorite Lupin the Third movie next to Castle of Cagliostro<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lupin-the-III-The-Castle-of-Cagliostro-Special-Edition/dp/B000FGG5NK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lupin the III: The Castle of Cagliostro (Special Edition)</a>.  It has all the action and suspense you would expect in a Lupin movie.  This time around a good portion of the story has to with Goemon.  We get to learn a little more of his mysterious past.  He and a girl from his clan are after a mysterious dragon statue that apparantly is made out of the same unique metal of Goemon's sword.  Lupin and his crew are after the same prize.  Lupin and Goemon find themselves on opposing sides! To make matters worse, a Chinese gangster and bunch of ninjas are also after the statue. Everyone wants the dragon statue for different reasons.  Its up to Lupin and Goemon to overcome their differences and find out the mystery of the dragon statue.
  I can't recommend this superb movie enough.  It has all of the action,suspese,mystery,and drama you would expect from a Lupin the 3rd movie and more.  Check it out!!!",1313884800,,1246,5.269035532994923
