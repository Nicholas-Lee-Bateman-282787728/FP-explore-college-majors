2253516,4,B0007Z0O3Q,I like really disturbing films and this is definitely one of them. The lead actress is great and she really carries the movie. Every time I thought this was one thing it became another thing and it made me really edgy. There was a lot of blood and some okay Aliens that you hardly even saw but most of this is like your not sure what's going to happen and everything is really horrible. It got talky at one part but I watched it through and the end is really great. If you like this type of film you'll really like this one.,1115078400,7,524,4.097087378640777

8054448,1,B0007Z0O3Q,"No one's a bigger fan boy of The Asylum than I am, but the plain and simple fact is that Alien Abduction is a complete snoozefest. Given the title, you would expect to witness something exciting and unworldly, but that just doesn't happen. In fact, almost nothing whatsoever happens over the course of the entire film. And guess what? The alien abduction itself is basically just a minor plot point that sets up the vast majority of the story. The acting ranges from the mediocre to the really bad, the set looks as cheap as it surely is, and the whole story - despite whatever pretensions it may have - ultimately serves no purpose whatsoever.

So two couples go camping in the woods - and, somehow or other, they aren't hunted down and killed by inbred rednecks. Instead, they're abducted by aliens. Now I don't know where these aliens come from, but they certainly don't resemble any of the species described by actual alien abductees. So, anyway, the abduction thing happens, and then Jean (Megan Lee Ethridge) wakes up in a secret military hospital, with no memory of anything that happened. That seems to disappoint her doctor and, more particularly, the cold female soldier in charge of the place. Jean, of course, is determined to find her friends and escape - and we the viewers are stuck watching everything that happens (or, in this case, doesn't happen).

This hospital is supposed to be a secure military facility, but that is a joke. Any idiot could escape this place easily. The guards on duty won't even chase Jean - they just stay where they are and yell ""stop her,"" and the people who actually do run after her seemingly give up as soon as she turns a corner. This, of course, allows her to sneak peeks at what is really going on in this hospital - which should be interesting but really isn't. Don't hold out any hope for a grand finale, either, as Alien Abduction's ending hits you like a soft pillow. This story could have worked if a decent writer was allowed to get his hands on it. As it stands now, though, this film is a one-way ticket to snoozeville.",1345680000,,2077,4.580645161290323
8054449,1,B0007Z0O3Q,"Very poor, low budget B grader of a horror film about alien abductions.  I didn't know they still made movies this bad. Full of terrible acting and ultra-crappy special effects.",1282953600,,177,4.9
8054450,4,B0007Z0O3Q,"The Sci-Fi Channel showed this movie over the weekend, and I'm seriously thinking of buying the DVD. Often their weekend fare seems to be low-budget techno-testosterone-adventure that's best avoided by anyone with a brain. But ""Alien Abduction"" is low-budget something else entirely.

It starts out seeming innocuously unoriginal, with four fairly annoying twentysomethings on a camping trip in the woods. They experience a horrifically gory alien abduction (hence the title), and then our lead woman wakes up in an institution for abduction survivors, where she has to figure out what's going on before what's going on kills her. We're not told whether the other three have survived, but they do reappear in the story after a while. (I'm being vague here on purpose.)

I knew from the outset that there would be a twist ending, and I assumed the twist would be fairly standard and predictable. Once the movie got going, though, it became obvious that I'd have to revise my prediction. I actually made several guesses through the course of the movie about what it would be, but was still surprised when it finally came. And it was pretty clever to boot.

All the hospital scenes are shot in a wash of green, or sometimes purple, contributing to the surreal, dreamlike atmosphere that pervades the whole movie. The only full color is when reality starts to intrude. If you pay attention, there are clues and red herrings scattered throughout as to the true nature of the situation, and some of them are actually not obvious, such as when the woman in charge says she is ""responsible for all the abductions in the northeast region."" In context, she clearly means that her hospital is responsible for the victims of such abductions. -- Or does she? The bizarre behavior of many (if not most) characters is another clue, but for this there are at least three potential explanations within the course of the story. Don't make the usual mistake of thinking this is merely bad acting. While it may be that, it also (perhaps unintentionally) has the effect of adding to the surreal, inhuman, disorienting quality of our heroine's surroundings, while at the same time preserving the quiet campiness, which turns out to complement the story surprisingly well.

Along her adventure, our heroine discovers scarred, murderous nurses; how easy it is to pose as a doctor in a military-run hospital; and the importance of wearing the right clothes for any given occasion. This is good dirty camp, and should be appreciated as such. Yet this character also acts in a completely consistent and believeable way, and turns out (after an initial spate of shrieking) to be a pretty sympathetic protagonist. This movie was made on a shoestring budget over a whopping one-and-a-half weeks, and the sound quality in particular suffered for it -- be prepared to turn your volume up, then down, then up again, several times. (This is frustrating but not fatal.) For the money and time they had, they did a pretty good job with a pretty good script.

All in all, the best B-movie I've ever seen.",1154563200,11,3067,4.901734104046243
8054451,2,B0007Z0O3Q,"Eric Forsberg's Alien Abduction is really a weird and often times painful experience to watch. The movie has bad effects,and inplausible storyline, unlikable characters and average acting.

It's not worth the $22 much less $10. Sad considering the potential premise. A group of young adults on vacation are abducted by alien beings.

Jean (Megan Lee Etheridge) plays  basically the lead survivor (we assume the restof her friends are dead). She gets puts into an insane asylum of sorts where she thinks she's being takencare of. Of course the twist comes in that this isn't really a mental hospital and really an examing and tortue room being done by the aliens. Btw the aliens in the movie look incredibly fake as if they were trying to combine both spandx and Cgi. It did not work, even the computer effects come out cheesy.

The movie does have a lot of gore scenes though as if trying to compensate for the other things, it worked briefly but the movie takes on too many inplausible turns as with most alien movies,there's a side story about an alien takeover, but it's done so silly you can't take it seriously without laughing.

I'd categorize the movie as a B movie for the millenium so if you're into these type of movies you might like otherwise stay away.

A couple of bright spots is the DVD itself which has a number

of special features including commentary from the director

himself and a pretty fun featurette on the film itself.

It's not all bad but it's one of those type of movies, where

there was more emphasis on making a real cheap movie out

there in the market than making a real impactful movie.",1129075200,,1622,4.636363636363637
8054452,1,B0007Z0O3Q,"This movie got a shudder out of me before it even started. I saw the

logo for The Asylum come up and I knew immediately that I was in for 90

minutes of cheap, irritating horror film-making. I've come to associate

that logo with some of the worst genre movies ever. Worse than Roger

Corman's Concorde label, worse than Avi Lerner's NuImage, worse than

Charlie Band's Full Moon... yes, even worst than Lloyd Kaufman's Troma

label. The Asylum is, hands down, the worst cheap movie horror outfit

in the history of cinema in my opinion. So, as I said, the logo came up

and I shuddered involuntarily. But that was the only scare of the whole

movie.

The Asylum is true to form with ALIEN ABDUCTION. The early scenes of a

crew of campers out in the woods are poorly lit, poorly acted and

poorly edited. About ten minutes in, our hiking quartet is attacked by

a bunch of lizard-alien-monster things. It looks like the suit came

from a B-movie clearance house. It might have been a leftover Godzilla

suit for all I know. The filmmakers apparently knew that the suit was

ridiculous because they coated it with bad CG prismatic colors. Haven't

seen that done since ""Darkhunters"".

So after the alligator aliens capture our hikers by throwing stuffed

pantyhose at them (I'm not kidding - watch the movie), the screen goes

black for a second and then we meet our four hikers again inside the

alien spaceship. Our female protagonist keeps filming everything with

her Handicam to give the movie that ""real"" quality. Because so often,

when I'm abducted by alligator aliens, I feel the need to capture the

whole experience for posterity. They try to escape, the alligator

aliens catch them and eviscerate them, throwing intestines all over the

place with bloody glee.

Cut to some sort of Government Secret Hospital. Our heroine is the only

one to have survived the experience and she has no memory of what

happened to her. Her doctor tries to jog her memory with pictures of

aliens and flying saucers, but to no avail. Meantime, Ilsa the She-Wolf

watches from behind the mirror and makes all kinds of arch statements

like, ""I don't like her. Terminate her."" The doctor begs for just a

little more time. Our heroine manages to escape from her captors and

her clothes several times over the course of the movie. After an hour,

I had seen the heroine's breasts so often that I was starting to

memorize her freckles.

So our heroine runs around, taking off her shirt, trying to avoid

aliens and help her friends (who are in fact alive!) escape from the

institution. But when she finally faces off with Ilsa, guess what....

she's not really a human at all! In a startling reveal that you will

not see coming if you sleep through the first hour, we find out that

our heroine is actually an alien sleeper agent! At this point, the

movie tries to become a poor man's version of Impostor - but if Phillip

K. Dick heard me say that, he'd probably roll in his grave. Obviously

somebody at the Asylum watched the Gary Sinise/Dimension version of

Impostor and thought, ""Let's do that, but with alligator men! We'll

call it Alien Impostor! No, wait, that will give away the twist.... how

about ALIEN ABDUCTION!""",1120780800,10,3225,4.654804270462633
