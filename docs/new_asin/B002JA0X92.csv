8371326,5,B002JA0X92,I purchased this video as my wife recommended it to me as it is a tradition in Ukraine and other countries to watch this movie on New Years Eve which we did. Even though I had to read english subtitles I found the movie to be quite enjoyable and funny at times. I highly recommend this movie as a love story is great in any language particulary if you have good actors as these were. I plan to watch it again this New Years Eve unless I just can't wait but this is definitely a keeper for years to come.,1328400000,,503,4.04
8371327,4,B002JA0X92,"A great film of the Soviet era which takes a light hearted look at Soviet Life where in every city was a carbon copy of any other city in the Union.
In short it looks at the consequences of getting hopelessly drunk during New Year's Eve celebrations with your male friends - haven't we all ??? - in a bath house (no, I got plastered in a pub, but all the same I was hopelessly drunk ), inadvertently catching a plane in place of your equally drunk colleague and then directing the taxi in the city of arrival to what SHOULD be your home address.

ONLY PROBLEM IS ------------------ that you are now in Leningrad, where you know not a single soul, and not in Moscow where your beloved patiently awaits your homecoming with a beautifully prepared candle-light dinner and also awaits your homecoming in as seductive a gown as she can find in 1980's early 1990's Soviet Union ------ Read Russia).

A bit laboured from mid-point on -------------  but this is more than made up for by the first half which features one of the very, very,VERY best impersonations of a drunken man I have seen on screen.

In Russian with English sub-titles ---------- which if you have any taste at all adds to the impact of this amazing movie.",1311120000,2,1219,4.502262443438914

You can never get bored with this film, it's one of the classic movies of the Soviet era with such talented actors like Andrey Myagkov, Yuri Yakovlev, Barbara Brylska, Aleksandr Shirvindt, Georgi Burkov, Liya Akhedzhakova, Eldar Ryazanov, etc. When you hear these names (those who are familiar with these actors, or lived during the Soviet Union) you'll automatically get interested in watching this movie (if you never watched it before), this is how wonderful actors they are! It also has several wonderful songs in it sung by Soviet diva -A.Pugacheva (she wasn't much famous in those days).For those who are interested in getting to know more about the movie plot, you can type the name of the movie and see it on Wikipedia.com, or just copy this link in a new window [...]
I used to watch this movie on TV every year on New Year's Eve with my family. It's like a tradition (almost like in the movie there's a tradition):-) Enjoyed it very much! If you watch it, it won't leave you indifferent either.",1297728000,,1054,4.702702702702703
8371329,5,B002JA0X92,"I love this movie. Everyone in post-USSR is familiar with this movie. Sinse 1975 (  i think) this became a tradition to play this movie on TV on New Year night. Sinse then, every one, at least onse, have seen this movie. Very interesting, full of humor, and shows alot of russian scenes. :)",1264118400,3,290,4.37037037037037
