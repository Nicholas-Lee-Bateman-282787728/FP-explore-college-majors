8328491,5,B001NZF1KK,"I'm rating this DVD on the quality of the information on it and not for the video quality. If you can't finish a video because of poor video quality then don't waste your time buying this. Personally, I'm just grateful that this presentation is available to watch at all.

This was recorded in 1992 at a small venue with a small number of people. It was recorded on VHS tape and then converted to DVD later. You can currently watch this for free on you tube but the question is, how long before it gets deleted or censored? So even though I already watched this for free, I wanted a hard copy in case it was no longer available to stream online.

This man, Bill Cooper, was supposedly assassinated because he was exposing a lot of dirty secrets in the US government. Regardless of whether what he says is 100% right or not, he believed it enough to die for. So many of the whistle blowers end up dead in strange ways or murdered that it's not a stretch to believe they were assassinated.

Anyway, I don't want to give away any of the theories before you watch this but he does present a theory about the Kennedy assassination which is very interesting. The most interesting thing to me is that many of the predictions he made during this presentation have happened like dominoes one after the other.

I've only just started researching this subject of a great conspiracy but I can tell you that once you take your blinders off you've been wearing your entire life, it feels like having ice cold water dumped over you. Then you feel like such a fool for not realizing any sooner. And you wonder what it is you can do to start fixing things and make it better.

I recommend this to all United States citizens. Watch it with an open mind. You will scoff and laugh when you first start your research but I think eventually, if you keep following the trail, you will stumble onto, if not the truth, then at least that the things you thought were true before are certainly not the truth anymore (and never were).

If you're new to these ideas or are a skeptic, research September 11th and then go from there...",1380931200,4,2104,4.423772609819121
8328492,5,B001NZF1KK,"This book is wonderful.  We don't really want to know this information, but our future depends on having this information so we can do something about it.  I applaud Mr. Cooper for his research and fearless exposure of the betrayal of our trust.",1380844800,,245,4.674418604651163
8328493,2,B001NZF1KK,this was the third replacement for this same DVD and this one doesn't play..... the other two weren't the DVD I ordered so I'm tired of dealing with this company not worth my time and the quality of the DVD is really bad it looks like a copy of a copy......really bad,1368403200,,267,4.153846153846154
8328494,1,B001NZF1KK,"This DVD looks like something they burned on their computer, put it in an old DVD case from another movie, and wrapped it in plastic. The movie itself looks like they filmed it themselves. You can barely hear and the quality is poor. DO NOT RECOMMEND!",1359072000,,251,4.478260869565218
8328495,4,B001NZF1KK,"William Cooper is a former military intelligence worker, who had tried to warn the country against a horrendous conspiracy against the American people, if not against the people of the world.  After viewing this video, I must admit some very mixed feelings as a consequence.  To make this review simple, I'll first present the negative aspects, followed by the positive.

First off, the DVD appears to be a copy of some old VHS tapes, ostensibly from 1991, in which Cooper gives a lecture at some church in Oklahoma or Kansas.  The tapes were produced by a consumer-quality video camera of the time, thus he video quality suffers as a result, most aggravating is the lack of contrast and detail of the slides and videos Cooper projects on a screen in the auditorium.  These appear either washed out or too fuzzy to be useful to anyone who wasn't there.

During the lecture, Cooper presents a ""big picture"" view which ties together UFOs, the New World Order, and the destruction of America from within.  In this presentation, he makes several claims that are either misrepresentations of fact, or are simply impossible for most people to confirm independently.

He says that while standing watch aboard a surfaced submarine, he saw a huge UFO emerge from the ocean, disappear into the sky, then reappear just before submerging again beneath the waves.  He was later sworn to secrecy, but has apparently broken that oath some thirty years later.  The book ""UFOs in Wartime"", cites many instances in which military personnel see and report UFOs, are sworn to secrecy, and yet later discuss their experiences.  But elsewhere it makes clear that some witnesses disappear, and are never heard from again.  Where Mr. Cooper stands in apparent defiance, or in covert cooperation with the government, is unclear.

However, there are other statements which seem out of sort with current scientific understanding.  For example, he claims that the lunar crater, Linne, disappeared over time.  In searching the history of astronomical anomalies, it appears that Linne was first thought of as a bright crater six miles across.  Over time the estimates of its size have been reduced considerably.  Now it appears to be only half-a-mile in diameter, but hardly disappeared.

Cooper also states that there are bases on the Moon and Mars, preparing for the inevitable influx of people seeking refuge from a soon overcrowded Earth.  There were perhaps created as a result of flying saucer technology, from Aliens that Cooper isn't sure exists.  The numerous photos and video Cooper shows to substantiate his point were not by any means convincing, and the attempt may have been an appeal to the power of suggestion.

With all of these, and other, short-comings one would think to give a lower rating.  But the fact is that Cooper goes to great length to cite his evidence, much of which is available to average citizens, especially in the Internet age.  He uses books produced by NASA to show traces of intelligent activity on the Moon.  These books were supposedly removed from the public arena after it was noted that the pictures indeed showed some non-natural activity on the Moon.

Cooper goes on to show how the UFO/alien mythology may be a ploy to force the world into a ""totalitarian-socialist"" oligarchy, one-world-government.  And this was back in 1991!  Ten years before the false-flag operation of 9/11.  Both Reagan and Bush I had made comments about an ""alien threat"" uniting all mankind, ala the movie Independence Day.  Thus, Cooper is suspicious of the UFO abduction phenomenon, and dismisses most/all prominent UFO ""researchers"" and organizations as being in cahoots with the government, if not actual agents themselves, naming Bob Lazaar and others by name.

There is some much more worth commenting on in this video, but I don't want the review to be as long as the lecture.  In closing, I will say that I agree with Mr. Cooper's stated sentiments that we should be Americans first, with an allegiance to the Constitution, and not to political parties, ideologies, or idols.  Playing petty games of Democrats vs Republicans, Whites vs colored, and other forms of bigotry is a good way to squander our time, energy and attention, when we really should be paying attention to the bigger picture - the world is in bad shape because we have been remiss in our duty to make the planet a better place for all to live.  Now, we are faced with an insidious enemy within our own borders, inside the halls of our own governments.

Mr. Cooper, right or wrong, is at least trying to wake people up to the dire situation which confronts us.  My only concern is that any misinformation or disinformation presented would be equally distracting.  Thus I cannot award the fifth star because I do not have full confidence in the accuracy of Mr. Cooper's presentation.  The quality of the video is partly to blame.  But I am glad to have viewed this presentation, as it provides a worthwhile alternative perspective on a very troubling situation.",1340409600,5,5028,4.927553444180522
8328496,3,B001NZF1KK,"When i learned that this book was available on dvd i had to get it. When i received it just yesterday,i couldn't open it fast enough. I opened the envelope,and pulled out a burned copy of the dvd. I was bummed that no info came w/it,but put it in the dvd player anyway. It was bill cooper giving a lecture regarding his book ,of the same name. If you have the book and want to know more,and don't mind sitting thru the 1991,vhs quallity, it will still load you up w/ incredible info.,pictures,and more. worth the 10 bucks,and i say gey it and watch it.",1303430400,5,552,4.266666666666667
8328497,5,B001NZF1KK,"** first, you can buy this dvd for around five dollars on ebaydotcom or iofferdotcom (like I did).

this 4 hour seminar covers a lot of material- the Kennedy assassination, UFO's, New World Order, the shadow government, (possible) colonization of the moon, and secret societies.  He has also written a book, with the same title, which covers the same material.

this was filmed in February 1991 in the state of Georgia (the city is not mentioned).  The video quality is not great (but fair), the audio quality is very good (considering this was filmed on a VHS recorder in 1991 and then transferred to dvd).

Bill Cooper was a military man- first he spent 4 years in the Air Force, then later served in the Navy for a number of years as an intelligence officer.  His father was also in the military.  Based on these facts, one must assume that he knows more about the subject matter than the average layman citizen.  And he does, as you'll discover when viewing this lecture.

Basically, this is a filmed lecture, complete with projected slide shows showing various documents and photographs which back up the claims that Bill Cooper makes in his lecture.  It is very extensive, being a 4 hour plus filmed lecture.

He makes a compelling case for what he is talking about.  Anyone interested in the New World Order / End Times would be interested in viewing this.  Considering it was filmed almost 20 years ago, his knowledge about these subjects is almost prophetic.

* highly recommended *",1285545600,7,1491,4.728682170542636
