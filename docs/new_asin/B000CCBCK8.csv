2455928,4,B000CCBCK8,"Same great mix of comedy and action as in the first two seasons, well worth owning.

The image remastering might be even better this time out, I haven't yet noticed any color changes and very little in the way of scratchiness ( seasons 1 & 2 had just a little more I think).

Season 2 was a 40th anniversary special edition, packed with good extras, 3rd season is almost useless for them. You get 4 episode photo galleries, the first two are best (with maybe half a dozen not very different pictures), I think the 4th gallery has only 2 pictures!- why'd they even bother? The only good extra is a segment in which Werner Klemperer appeared on ""The Pat Sajak Show"". There aren't any commentaries.

As you may have noticed in past seasons many episodes have snow patched around on the ground, they went all out in 3rd season's ""Everybody Loves a Snowman"" (disc 3)with quite a blizzard blowing around, the snowman the gang built to hide a tunnel entrance was the worst part of it (didn't look real at all).

Now all we have to do is wait for Season 4.",1142985600,6,1048,4.414507772020725
2455929,5,B000CCBCK8,"So far, all of the Hogans Heroes dvds have been worth owning, but this season had some of my favorite episodes.

D-Day at Stalag 13 has the POWs concocting a plan to make visiting generals believe Klink is being made Hitlers chief of staff, so they can keep the Germans from reacting in time to the Normandy invasion.

War takes a holiday is one of the best - with Col Hogan convincing Major Hochstetter the war is over, and he should let the important captured prisoners take his staff car to go into town.

The Ultimate Weapon - has Schultz becoming ""Clairvoyant"" so Hogan can clear the way for a heavily protected ball bearing plant to get bombed.

The low point is probably ""The Hostage"" with Nita Talbot as Marya - ""the White Russian"".  Any Marya episode seems to start with her causing serious trouble and presenting an attractive target.  Somehow, in spite of her ""help"" the boys of Stalag 13 come through.

It's all kind of hokey and predictable, but it's always fun to watch.  Like the earlier releases, the video quality is better than you'll remember from watching on TV - especially if you have a progressive scan dvd player.",1142985600,7,1137,4.594059405940594
2455930,5,B000CCBCK8,"The third season of Hogan's heroes is short on special features, a few photo galleries and a clip from the Pat Sajak show, but the shows themselves are some of the best including Hogan Go Home and War takes a holiday two of my favories episodes.

You will see a lot more of the Gestapo and a particular Major and a little less of a certain plump General.  You will also spot William Christopher in his 4th and final spot on the series playing ""Thomas"" subbing for Carter as well.

My teenage sons are enjoying this series as much as I have.  I am waiting for the simpson's clip to show up (I'm guessing season 5).

Buy it and enjoy",1142553600,6,631,4.225
2455931,5,B000CCBCK8,"Season 3 of Hogan's heroes is another must have DVD set. I will own every DVD season they produce, as soon as they produce it. I cant get enough!

I would also like to recommend another WWII situation comedy, ""Allo, Allo!"" Set in France and revolves around the exploits of the French resistance [our man Louis Lebeau's folks back home] against the bumbling German army and gestapo, all while trying to help stranded allied airmen avoid becoming POWs. I think of this as the British version of 'HH,' in particular, some of season 3's episodes set in a POW camp [some of the show's best!].

Season 1 is good, but things really begin to develop starting with Season 2. Season 4 introduces new characters including an Italian Captain [sound familiar?]. There are nine 'Allo, Allo!' seasons altogether, with seasons 1-4 released so far. Season five, the shows largest/longest, should be due out next.

The individual shows are great, but 'AA' is a true serial, in that the episodes carry over into one aother with lots of great plot and character development. I believe if you cant get enough 'Hogan's Heroes,' you may enjoy seeing the French underground's perspective of the war on 'Allo, Allo!' Give it a try.",1142208000,3,1206,4.788461538461538
2455932,5,B000CCBCK8,"Col. Hogan and the gang at Stalag 13 continue fighting the war from inside a POW camp, evading detection by their German captors.  Highlights from Season Three include . . .

The Critendon Plan: Bernard Fox is back as the bumbling Col. Crittendon, who once again is a prisoner in another POW camp.  London orders Col. Hogan (Robert Crane) to break him out, so he can put into effect his plan to stop a German convoy.  It's all a big mistake, but Crittendon still does manage to get the mission accomplished.

Sgt. Schultz Meets Mata Hari: A frustrated Maj. Hochstetter (Howard Caine) suspects something is going on at Stalag 13, and instructs Gestapo agent Eva Mueller(Joyce Jameson) to try and find what, by getting close to Sgt. Schultz (John Banner).  Schultz is married, but that doesn't keep him from having some fun with Eva.  Great interplay between Jameson and Banner.

One In Every Crowd: Paul Picerni plays an obnoxious POW, who plans to reveal the secrets of Stalag 13 to the Nazis for a price.  The gang does their best to wipe the smirk off the traitor's face.

Is General Hammerschlag Burning?: Lovely Barbara McNair, guests as a Parisian psychic with influence over a high ranking German officer.  Sgt. Kinchloe (Ivan Dixon) sure gets around, as he knew the lady when she lived back in the States.  With her help, Hogan and the gang are able to copy some critical documents during a sance.

The Hostage: Nita Talbot returns as Marya, the beautiful and mysterious Russian agent.  This time she's in the company of General von Heiner (Theo Marcuse) who is in command of a nearby military installation.  Hogan and his men have rigged the place to blow up, but thanks to Marya, Von Heiner suspects that Hogan is much more than just a POW, and holds him hostage at the depot as the timer ticks down.  Can he escape before disaster strikes?

Two Nazis For the Price of One: Alan Oppenheimer guests as a Freitag an ambitious Gestapo agent who knows all about the operation at Stalag 13, but has not revealed the secret because he is more interested in something else called the `Manhattan Project'.  The Manhattan Project was the code name for the top secret effort to develop the atomic bomb.  Freitag is too dangerous to be left alive, but fate intervenes and Hogan and his men get a reprieve.

Hogan Go Home: The high command wants Hogan to return to the States.  Things get complicated when Hogan's replacement turns out to be Col. Crittendon, who takes over as the senior Allied officer.  The prisoners must scramble in order to keep Hogan around, and get Crittendon shipped off to another camp.

War Takes a Holiday: In perhaps their ultimate con job, the heroes convince Maj. Hochstetter that the `krieg iz zu ende' (the war is over), in order to effect the release of several key leaders of the underground being held prisoner at Stalag 13.  A phony call with Newkirk (Richard Dawson) on the other end as a Nazi officer celebrating the end of hostilities helps seal the deal.

Duel of Honor: Antoinette Bower guests as underground agent Erika Wilder, who develops a phony crush on Col. Kink (Werner Klemperer), in order to get critical information to England.  Klink is all for the romance until he discovers that Erika's husband is a German officer who loves to slice things with his saber.  Sgt. Carter (Larry Hovis) assumes the role of `Tiger' Wilder, and during a tantrum chops Kink's office to pieces.

The Ultimate Weapon: In order to get the Germans to shift some of their defenses, Hogan convinces Kink and General Burkhalter (Leon Askin) that Sgt. Schultz has psychic powers that enable him to predict where The Allies will strike next.

There are a few clunkers, but for the Season Three is another winner.  POW's Carter, Newkirk, LeBeau and Kinchloe each are featured individually in at least one episode, and General Burkhalter and Major Hochstetter make more regular appearances.  Great new guest stars, and favorite reoccurring characters return.  Fans of the series will not be disappointed by this set.",1141776000,9,4034,4.784682080924855
2455933,5,B000CCBCK8,"As the complete third season of this well-written comedy is released, the cast continue their expert timing, acting and making the Nazis look like fools every week.

The extras featuring Werner Klemperer's interview on the ""Pat Sajak Show""  and the series photo gallery are added incentives to help you decide to add this one to your collection.",1141689600,3,345,5.035087719298246
2455934,5,B000CCBCK8,"Without a doubt, ""War takes a Holiday"" is probably the best episode of ""Hogan's Heroes"" and one of the funniest sitcom presentations ever on television.  The absolute absurdity of ""Hogan's Heroes"" is neatly summed up as Col. Hogan and the boys convince the Germans that the war is over so as to secure the release of some important allied prisoners.

Every one of the classic ""Hogan"" characters plays his part (with the notable exception of Larry Hovis, who is strangely AWOL this time around) to maximum effect as the prisoners concoct and enact a scheme whereas they isolate and control communication around Stalag 13 and convinice everyone, prisoners included, that World War II has ended.  It is especially priceless to see Howard Caine's Major Hochsteter join in the mirth as he unwittingly allows Hogan to secure his staff car for the prisoners' escape, as Hogan suggests it would be a nice gesture...""seeing that the war is over.""",1141689600,24,937,4.955414012738854
2455935,5,B000CCBCK8,"Season 3 of Hogan's Heroes has some of the top ranked episodes, including War Takes A Holiday when Hogan tricks Colonel Klink and Gestapo Major Hochstetter (Whooo eeez theese mahn?) that the war is over so prisoners can escape. In The Ultimate Weapon Colonel Hogan convinces Schultz he has ESP, with the predictable outcome of disaster for the Nazis. Colonel Crittendon shows up in The Crittendon Plan, which only endangers Hogan's smooth running operation. I've been a fan of Hogan's Heroes for 40 years, and can't wait to get each DVD set.

2455936,5,B000CCBCK8,"When the first announced the Hogan's Heroes season 1 boxset, I wasn't too bumped up about it. But it had been such a long time since I last saw the show on TV and after watching ""Auto Focus,"" I picked it up on a whim - a chance to watch a show that I was hooked on as a kid. And I'm hooked again. It's great to see these shows in such clarity. I was used to watching it with adjusting rabbit ears. There's nothing sit-com about the look of this show. It looks like a real war flick.

Bob Crane nailed the role of Col. Hogan. He was just the man. I try to  watch an episode before I go to bed. It's a damn shame they just don't make comedies like this.  It'll be nice to have another 30 episodes on my shelf. (they made 6 seasons of the show).

The rumored extras include more of Bob Crane's home movies taken on the set and a few more ads (Season 2's Carol Channing ad is a jawdropper).",1137628800,4,886,3.9329608938547485

By then all the main characters have settled down into their roles.  John Banner truly begins to take the lead of the laughter as Stalag 13's ""Ever Vigilant"" Sgt. Schultz.  With sergeants like Schultz, it was only a matter that the Third Reich would eventually fall.

Some of the best episodes are when Hogan (Bob Crane) convinces Col Klink (Werner Klemperer) and General Burkhalter (Leon Askin) the war was over.  The ""red shirt"" POWs managed to get out before the gig was up.  Good on 'em!  Hogan's Heroes definitely makes fun of the Super Race and all the Fhrer stood for.

As I posted on Season 2...at least 4 (maybe more) of these main actors were somehow personally involved in the sorrows of Nazi Germany.  Some narrowly escaped with their lives, and several members of their families were not so fortunate. Le Beau (Robert Clary) himself, a Polish Jew, spent 30 months as a prisoner of war.

Although they are living in a POW Camp, they have many amenities and the German officers in charge of them always find themselves in funny predicaments because of the work of the Allied POWs.

2456178,5,B000CCBCK8,Hogan's Heroes was one of the best shows ever on television.  I suggest getting every year of the show.  It is interesting to see how the show evolved.  It is still funny after all of these years.,1207440000,,196,4.243243243243243
2456179,1,B000CCBCK8,"This show is terrific - - all 6 seasons!  One of the best shows on TV!  Too bad it lasted only 6 seasons - - perhaps because of Bob Crane's murder??  I would love to have all seasons on DVD, but sadly, English sub-titles are not offered.  I can HEAR perfectly well, but have difficulty understanding the words.  So the producers have lost 6 sales.  If it had subtitles, I'd have given it 5 stars!

If you don't need sub-titles, buy it!  You'll love it if you enjoy a good laugh at impossible-to-happen nonsense.  No slapstick, just great  situations gone comically wrong - for Stalag 13's benefit!  All characters marvelously played by perfectly-chosen actors.",1199836800,9,660,4.701754385964913
2456180,4,B000CCBCK8,"Lot of laughs after a hard day. Some clever plots, vaguely related to actual WWII events. But you don't watch Hogan's for the realism. Probably the last season we will buy - the series ""jumps the shark"" shortly after this.",1187481600,,222,4.575

2456216,5,B000CCBCK8,"I only discovered ""Hogan's Heroes"" in the mid-'90s through french-dubbed reruns while living in France. I very quickly found the plots and characters hilarious, and the fake german accents incredibly funny. I also found the concept extremely bold: even though the series took place in a pseudo-POW camp and not an extermination camp, swastikas and SS uniforms were all around, and the situations and nazi organizations portrayed were bound to shock more than one. AND the series was originally aired about 20 years after the liberation of the concentration/extermination camps. How could they pull off introducing the project to studios, having it accepted, and then airing it? I don't know, but I'm certainly grateful they did. This is one of my favorite shows if not THE favorite, along with ""Sanford & son"", ""Barney Miller"", ""Taxi"" and ""Seinfeld""... Now viewing them in their original English version is great, since some of the humor in the storylines was lost during the translation to French, although I find the german accents less ridiculous in the US version. Anyone fluent in French and having access to French-dubbed episodes should look out for Hochstetter's and Burkhalter's appearances.
I'm sorry nothing as good has been made in recent years; any TV series' attempt at being funny lately has only turned out ridiculously retarded, save for a very few...",1158451200,6,1368,5.166666666666667
2456217,5,B000CCBCK8,"The introductory CBS logo is gone, but the show remains in top form.  Season three of HOGAN'S HEROES is the point at which the actors have become inseparable from their roles.

More Col. Crittendon, Hochstetter, but less of Hilda. This season featured larger roles for Ivan Dixon, Larry Hovis, Robert Clary, and Richard Dawson.

Some of the best shows of the series appear in this season.  Included this this collection are episodes about the snowman tunnel, Schultz conveniently misplacing his rifle while under fire, and Crittendon's assignment to replace Hogan at Stalag 13.

Yes, it is still perpetual winter at Stalag 13.  Despite the lush California greenry in the background we still believe that it is freezing cold outside.  The actors must have been roasting in their jackets and overcoats.  Additionally, you do not have to look too carefully in some of the season three episodes to spot a soundstage or studio warehouse in the background -- towering over the barracks set.  Then again, after three years it was becoming difficult to find new camera angles from which to shoot.

Klink still reports to General Burkhalter.  Leon Askin, as usual, is great in this role.  However, throughout the series' six-year run there was always a question as to why a Luftwaffe colonel reported to a Heer general.  We will just have to assume that Burkhalter, whose military duties were never fully described in the series, was the local non-combat Wehrkreis commander. From a military heraldry standpoint it is interesting to note that Burkhalter sports a ceremonial Luftwaffe dagger suspended from his leather belt.

Like the costuming of the SS in other television series, HOGAN'S HEROES SS and Gestapo personnel, who should be wearing field gray uniforms in wartime, continue to don their pre-war black attire.  I suppose that it made them more readily identifiable as the bad guys.  Season Three marks the first time we find Burkhalter and Hochstetter together in the same episode.  According to Brenda Scott Royce's book HOGAN'S HEROES: BEHIND THE SCENES, the Hochstetter character was used almost interchangabley for Burkhalter when Leon Askin was unavailable for a show.

There are a couple additional faux pas in this season.  In one episode we find Klink summoned to report to a high ranking SS general.  He tries on hats trying to decide which one to wear for the visit.  The peaked cap he dons for one moment is not his usual Luftwaffe hat, but is a field-green German army (Heer)cap.  Additionally, the mystery is solved as to how Sergeant Schultz's cartridge belt remains level around his equitorial girth. Most German soldiers wore leather Y-suspenders to support their heavily laden belts.  In one show, while Schultz is temporarily in charge of the Luft Stalag, we see that his overcoat is tailored with metal clips on each side so that his overcoat actually supports his belt.

By the way, doesn't anyone find it peculiar that the French underground is operating so deep inside Germany?  Luft Stalag 13's fictional location is in the middle of Germany by Hammelburg.  During World War Two, Hammelburg was actually the site of a Yugosloav and American POW camp that housed General George S. Patton's son in law after his capture in North Africa.

In Season Three there are numerous clues that it is 1944 as there is talk of an impending D-Day invasion, two episodes about rocket fuel, and General Hammerschlag's plan for the destruction of Paris prior to its capture by the Allies.  In fact, the title of the Paris episode, ""Is General Hammerschlag Burning?""  is a direct reference to the Larry Collins and Dominique Lepierre book (and later movie of the same name) IS PARIS BURNING?  However, a few episodes later, Hogan tries to persuade Klink to play his violin in a POW camp stage production of ""Escape Follies of 1943.""  Much like M*A*S*H, the actual chronological date is not important.

Remember too that this was the year that Desilu Studios was absorbed into Paramount.  Some episodes credit Desilu, while others list Paramount.  The original STAR TREK likewise shared this change.  Considering the fact that the Culver City 40 Acres lot, which was actually 29 acres in size, was surrounded by urban sprawl the studio did a fantastic job depicting the Luftstalag as being located in the country.  Indeed, when I stumbled onto a several websites featuring photographs of Stalag 13's set in the northwest corner of the lot, I was amazed at how the narrow, grassy and tree studded berm effectively shielded the lot from the highway, homes, and businesses directly on the other side.  About the only recurring clue that civilization lurks nearby are the utility lines above the trees.

As another point of trivia, the edge of the HOGAN'S HEROES set was directly on top of the site of GONE WITH THE WIND's Tara mansion.  Unfortunately the dilapidated remains of Stalag 13 were bulldozed in 1976 to make way for modern sound stages and buildings built for a procession of subsequent studio lot owners.

Once again the DVD set is of exceptional quality.",1157241600,23,5069,4.966785290628707
2456218,5,B000CCBCK8,"For all of us that grew up with Hogans Heroes it just wasn't right that a day would go by without one on the tube, even if it was reruns.

Now that the shows are on DVD in better quality than VHS everyone who loves this show can view them all the time, in their own sort of order.

I am very fond of the episode #40 ""A Klink, a Bomb and a Short Fuse"" originally aired on 04 NOV 1966, which has Hogan thinking that he is difusing a fake bomb when in reality its real. Lots of laughs and it shows have scared the two main german characters are, Klink and Schultz.

Anyway, the Dvd's are here so now you can see some really funny TV not the stuff they have on today",1144368000,5,662,3.888888888888889
