4900058,5,B005X5XINI,"Of all of Agatha Christie's characters, Poirot is our favorite.  We watch and re-watch these stories.  The Brits know how to tell a good murder mystery.  We enjoy the period settings, costumes and automobiles, and particularly the development of the characters.  We wish there were thousands of Poirot mysteries.  We never tire of them.",1330905600,3,336,5.148148148148148
4900059,5,B005X5XINI,"What a treat 'Poirot' is on BD!  I can't believe how clear and crisp the image is on BD.  I was a little worried since I had read that this show was originally filmed on 16mm, which is half the size of regular 35mm.  Acorn to my approval this time has put a lot of care into the product.  I have issues with them for releasing the same product in different packaging three times in about 10 years, but invest in the BD and you will be happy.  Everyone knows how good most of these shows are so I will not give that type of review.  I own some of the A&E films on SD DVD and there is an extraordinary difference between them and the BD just in contrast alone.  The blacks are black and the colors dazzle.  I would love some kind of special features, lets get interviews with David and the gang or license some of the BBC stuff that was filmed about the series (found on YouTube), something!  Acorn has dropped the ball in that department.  If you are on the fence about upgrading, don't be, do it and you will be happy just like me.  I am a little perturbed at Amazon and their adjustable pricing they practice, like how these were 44 dollars when they came out, but less than a month later, they are half the price?!?!?  Use your little grey cells and snatch them up now before the price goes up Mon Amis!",1330473600,44,1305,4.155378486055777
4900060,5,B005X5XINI,"As great as it was 10 years ago to have the early Poirot adventures on DVD, there was a significant caveat. The transfers from film to DVD produced a visual quality that was disappointing--murky, dull, fuzzy, with a unique and unwelcome pinstriping effect in many of the shows. I always blamed this on the 16mm film format that the show was shot on. (Baffling to me that they wouldn't shoot on 35mm, considering all the loving care that went into the costumes and sets and scenery.) Well, I was wrong. Apparently those crappy looking DVDs were the result of human ineptitude, not the film format. Because the new transfers to Blu Ray--while not up to the blazing standard of contemporary high def--are crisp and clean and quite handsome. The 16mm does the stories justice. I've only looked at a couple of the episodes so far, but wow, they look good. You will see details and colors that you've never seen before. One thing that another online reviewer noted was that this first season of episodes was overlit, and that's right. They're rather bright and flat-looking. Apparently, the lighting becomes more subtle and three-dimensional as the show proceeded. Still, that's just a niggle. On the whole, I'd say any Poirot fan who wants the see the show at its best should make the upgrade to Blu Ray. BTW, there's a cool little clip online on the restoration of the early Poirot shows; just Google ""Poirot 16mm ITV.""",1330473600,32,1415,4.7560975609756095
4900061,5,B005X5XINI,"I bought every one of the original 33 episodes in DVD and they're wonderful!  Now, I ordered these 3 Blu-Ray sets from Amazon.  I'm certain they'll be even better in Blu-Ray.  The only problem is the 3 Blu-Ray sets as advertized on Amazon only add up to 30 episodes, not the original 33.  I'm not talking about the later movies that wern't part of the original series.  Does anybody know why Acorn left out 3 of the episodes?  Anyway, you just couldn't get higher quality production value, story telling, or acting!  You'll love these, especially in Blu-Ray!",1328486400,2,558,4.690721649484536
4900062,5,B005X5XINI,"Any POIROT set is just plain GOOD murder mystery. Agatha Christie suspense perfect. David Suchet acting excellence. Combined they make any British Mystery viewer salivate. Add top guest stars in each, SUBTITLES for the hearing and dialect challenged, and kick in some of the best filmed period mystery ever produced. It's what fans have come to expect with Poirot, Agatha Christie, Masterpiece Mystery, and the untouchable as Hercule Poirot--David Suchet.

The Blu-rays and new DVDs are newly remastered and restored to their original U.K. broadcast order. This is wonderful mystery TV, never to get out of date. You WILL love every feature-length episode.

The original 10 late 1930s era episodes (WITH SUBTITLES) in original June-March 1989 order. Period costumes as accurate as the Art Deco sets. David Suchet begins his masterful role as Hercule Poirot with the supporting cast of associate Hastings (Hugh Fraser-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bretts-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B004WMOSMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bretts: The Complete Collection</a>); CI Japp (Philip Jackson-`Robin of Sherwood'); and Sec. Lemon (Pauline Moran) as well as numerous episode guest stars.
1 THE ADVENTURE OF THE CLAPHAM COOK: Poirot's unimportant domestic case is searching for Todd's (Brigit Forsyth) cook Eliza (Freda Dowie-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brontes-of-Haworth/dp/B00009WVLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brontes of Haworth</a>) gone lost. She's inherited and moved to near Carlisle, her trunk left at the station. Dermot Crawley's (`Bleak House') character may be involved.

2 MURDER IN THE MEWS: Poirot helps Japp on a Bonfire Night (aka Guy Fawkes Day) suspicious suicide. Look for David Yelland (`The Bretts') and James Faulkner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Among-Equals/dp/B001B1Q2VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Among Equals</a>).

3 THE ADVENTURE OF JOHNNIE WAVERLY: Waverly's (Goeffrey Bateman) wealthy wife Ada (Julia Chambers) wants Poirot's help when kidnap threats reach a peak.

4 FOUR AND TWENTY BLACKBIRDS: Two brothers die within days Poirot witnessed one, an artist, dining out in a most uncharacteristic manner. Poirot puts his little gray culinary cells to work. Brief nude model (Holly De Jong-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lytton-s-Diary-Complete-Collection/dp/B003L195C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lytton's Diary Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;`Titmuss Regained'). Also see Hilary Mason & Richard Howard (`Love in a Cold Climate').

5 THE THIRD FLOOR FLAT: Poirot is ill plus bored enough to investigate a shooting in his own building flats. Gray cells on the home stairs helps Scot. Yard. Suzanne Burden (`Bleak House') and Josie Lawrence appear.

6 TRIANGLE AT RHODES: See Greek island scenes & costumes instead of the normal London fare. On holiday, Poirot investigates a poisoning of a hotel guest (Annie Lambert). An affair makes Douglas (Peter Steeelen) suspect. Poirot look further--like wife Marjorie (Angela Down-`Emma'), Burns (Timothy Kightley, & Pamela (Frances Low- `Gosford Park').

7 PROBLEM AT SEA: A cruise (see a period yacht) lovelier than a fatal chest wound of a female (Sheila Allen) passenger. Plenty of suspects all with alibi. At least Poirot's clues are all aboard. Victoria Hastead, John Normington, Roger Hume, & Ann Firbank all add star power to the suspects.

8 THE INCREDIBLE THEFT: An industrialist (John Stride-`Lytton's Diary') must convince His Maj. Gov. of his fighter plane's worth & his sincerity after a past scandal. He baits Vanderlyn (Carmen Du Sautoy) a Nazi spy, and his wife (Claran Madden-`Fortunes of War') begs Poirot for security. Phyllida Law plays Lady Isabelle and John Carson (Emma) her spouse. My favorite episode in the first ten.

9 THE KING OF CLUBS: A murder man (David Swift) & a solving clue is a single card. Is a director (Jonathan Coy-`Rector's Wife' `Pillars of the Earth') involved? The stars (Niamh Cusack) (Gawn Granger)?

10 THE DREAM: ""King of Pies,"" Farley dreams of suicide. He asks Poirot if someone could manipulate him to do it. His death matches the dream. Suspect is Farley's daughter (Joely Richardson-`Lady Chatterley').",1323820800,73,4301,6.139767054908486

4900069,5,B005X5XINI,"What more can one say about Hercule Poirot?  As he states himself, he is the best and most famous detective in the world (circa 1930s).  Settings and character actors are outstanding.  David Suchet is inimitable.  I have grown fond of Detective Chief Inspector Japp, who appears in the early series.  Plot is always entertaining. My only complaint is that the British film makers still need to improve their audio recordings.  Especially when there is a heavy accent and the microphone is not well placed, it is difficult to discern exactly what is being said.  This Series provides very good value.",1490486400,,599,4.93

In the books he was difficult but I liked him to some degree.  When I first saw David Suchet as Poirot:  HOW WONDERFUL HE WAS because he was Poirot!  I am niot going to elaborate on the stories because if YOU have ever read the books you know the stories and my opinion is there is nothing like them today.  I love them.

4900181,5,B005X5XINI,"I ordered series 1 not knowing anything about this Agatha Christie ""Poirot"".  In fact, I thought it would be rather boring but thought I'd give it a try.  It was anything BUT boring!!!!  By the end of the second feature on series 1, I was at my PC ordering series 2,3, and 4, then 5 and 6 shortly thereafter, all from Amazon!  The writing is very clever leaving you wondering ""who did it"" almost to the end and always with twists and/or turns along the way.  The actor portraying ""Poirot"" is well suited to the character. That mustache!  OMG, how cute it is.  His funny little shoes, how he walks, how impeccably dressed he is even at the beach and how he works those little gray cells to perfection!  Too much!  All very enjoyable.

The supporting actors are great too, especially ""Japp"" who always seems bewildered at Poirot's thought processes!  Hastings, the lovable buffoon who is never right about anything and the ever efficient Miss Lemon--they all make the series most excellent!  You can even learn a some French phrases by watching and then Goggling!!!  Good clean mysteries with no foul language or sex.  Highly recommended!",1402963200,9,1136,4.729591836734694

4900184,5,B005X5XINI,I have always been a fan on Poirot and to own them on DVD now is great because when there's no good TV on and I want to relax I can just put one of these on. They're smart and entertaining. I love having these as a part of my DVD collection. Even rewatching the ones I've already seen is wonderful because its like visiting an old friend.

4900216,5,B005X5XINI,"I bought this DVD directly from Acorn media during their 40% off Agatha Christie sale (they often have good deals on the mystery genre, too). These are marvelously entertaining stories which feature the incredible acting of David Suchet as the eccentric, brilliant, impeccably mannered, and often humorous little Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. His co-workers -- the helpful if nave Captain Hastings, the efficient Miss Lemon, and the determined Inspector Japp -- are equally endearing. The 1930's style in clothing, architecture, manners, automobiles, etc. is a real treat for the eye, and so are the sometimes exotic locations (cruising the Mediterranean on an ocean yacht , vacationing in Rhodes, traveling by train), and the plots will keep you guessing.
Because I enjoy watching episodes in the same order in which they were originally broadcast, and also try to avoid buying duplicates, I experienced some confusion when it came time to actually make a purchase due to this series being released in a variety of collections by different networks and multiple vendors at different points in time. I found it well worth it to take a few minutes to do some research on Wikipedia's ""List of Agatha Christie's Poirot Episodes"" link. Of the twelve series available at the present time, Series One through Six can be found boxed into ""The Early Cases Collection""; Series Seven through Ten are boxed into ""The Definitive Collection""; and the episodes from Series Eleven and Twelve are scattered throughout ""Movie Collection"" numbers Four, Five, and Six.
Soooo... the simplest way for me to buy all available episodes (Series Thirteen has not yet been made) was to buy ""The Early Cases"", ""The Definitive Collection"", ""Movie Collection Four"", ""Movie Collection Five"", and ""Movie Collection Six"".
Although I hardly buy everything I enjoy on DVD, these definitely withstand multiple viewings, not only because of the high quality with which they're made, but because of the subtle clues woven into the intricate plots which are often overlooked during a first (often late night) watching.",1364515200,3,2085,5.2642642642642645

4900242,5,B005X5XINI,Such a treat to watch these. David Suchet is perfect in the role. Not a bad episode in the entire set.,1345420800,,102,3.9047619047619047

4900244,5,B005X5XINI,"Great stories, a little younger and more dashing Poirot. The picture quality is excellent, I only wish they could figure out how to change the video format so it would work better with wide screen TVs without stretching the image. I am sure it is possible.",1336003200,,256,4.586956521739131
4900245,5,B005X5XINI,"Here the Poirot series Blu-rays really begin. I had heard that Poirot was airing remastered older episodes in HD in the UK for a while now, but I had not seen a single one aired in the USA. I guess work had been done to remaster the episodes for broadcast, but I didn't know that there was such grand plans for blu-ray releases. Wow wow wow, The picture quality. All the versions of this show I had seen on DVD or occasional broadcasts, the colors seemed off of or the detail of the shots seemed off and I always dismissed this based on the shows age. Incredibly, with proper remastering, these old 16mm film TV shows have a soft and grainy picture that I absolutely love.
The picture and audio quality are now a great improvement.  The Audio is 224kbps I believe in Season 1 (With Season 2 moving up to 256kbps, and Season 4 moving to 1.5mbps) but very crisp and clear. The English subtitles are a pleasant surprise too, for picking up the odd quips and inside jokes that I never once understood after years and years of watching this show. Simply Amazing.",1335830400,4,1057,4.420512820512821
4900246,5,B005X5XINI,"When I read some time ago that they were transferring these very familiar programs to Blu-ray, I thought ""hmmm really?"" knowing that they were filmed in tiny 16mm format, and never intended to be seen on anything more that standard TV screens.  But wow the stars really aligned on this project, as they went back to scan the original Panaflex camera negatives and digitally restore them.  The results are just eye-popping and keep knocking my proverbial socks off. As often happens with HD digital restorations, all kinds of detail and depth jumps out in the clothing and sets; antique cars gleam, and the colors in women's outfits shines. Its startling to see how much effort was made in the production which was impossible to see at the time.  I've just finished watching Series 4 and they keep getting better. Now I'm praying that they do the same thing to the original Marples.",1335830400,2,881,4.782894736842105
4900247,5,B005X5XINI,"the films are well made. the acting is excellent. but for some reason, there are duplicate shows when ordering DVD sets. it appears as though there are different sets to collect. the first is a ""movie"" collection. the second is a ""definitive"" collection. the third is a ""series"" collection. i want to purchase and view the films in the order they were released. but, the task is not so simple. my ""little grey cells"" are working overtime to determine which set to purchase. when i am done, i will watch all the episodes. some of them more than once.",1335312000,3,549,4.555555555555555
4900248,5,B005X5XINI,"I am a big Poirot fan. This blu ray version is just great. The buildings, scenery, and even period clothing just pop on the screen. Will save my money and get series 2.",1335139200,,168,4.121212121212121
4900249,5,B005X5XINI,"I really thought the British version may be a bit too dry for me. But, alas, I really enjoyed all of the Hercule Poirot shows. I have read the previous revues, and was skepticle. I like this series. The scenery is beautiful. Makes you feel like you are there!. I will continue to buy this series, hopefully there will be some sales!! Yes, I do like Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot, probably better but you can't compare apples to oranges. They are both good in different settings.",1334793600,,480,4.528735632183908
4900250,5,B005X5XINI,"I'm a big Poirot fan and originally acquired all the episodes and movies on DVD.  When this first set came out on Blu Ray, I picked it up just to see how much of an improvement it was.  I compared numerous specific scenes and frames, and the difference is stunning.  The picture is much more vivid.  The colors in the clothing, women's makeup, etc. are much brighter.  In one scene, a decorative screen can be seen in the back corner of the room.  On the DVD version, it just looks like a really dark (almost black) hazy looking screen, with only a slight hint of any pattern on it.  On the Blu Ray, it is clearly burgundy in color and has an intricate pattern on it.  Now I'm planning on upgrading the entire collection to Blu Ray.  They are releasing the sets at a rapid pace, and the price is reasonable for the number of episodes on each set.  I'd definitely recommend these.",1334620800,5,879,4.337423312883436
4900251,5,B005X5XINI,"I appreciate Amazon carrying the David Suchet Poirot series.  He is the consumate Poirot, and the DVDs are first quality.",1334534400,,121,5.05
4900252,5,B005X5XINI,"It's fun to go back and watch this series from the beginning. Having recently seen latter-day Poirot episodes--which can be quite dark and moody--these first episodes are delightfully light and entertaining. David Suchet's mastery of Agatha Christie's Belgian detective was apparent from the outset. He hadn't yet perfected his mince, or his OCD, but he clearly was meant for the role. Captain Hastings, Inspector Japp and Miss Lemon are also pitch-perfect early on.

The best thing about this set is the image quality. It is my understanding that the show was shot on 16mm film, but the clarity of the AVC encode shows how 16mm can look fantastic in the hands of skilled cinematographers. I had only ever watched this show on DVD, and this set is a significant upgrade.

The calculus is simple. If you are a Poirot Fan and own a Blu-ray player, you must buy this set! Don't argue. Just buy it.",1332547200,13,894,4.7612903225806456

8488241,5,B005X5XINI,"BBC Poirot, played by David Suchet, is based off of Agatha Christie's Poirot mysteries and is an extremely entertaining show for the evenings. This show is set in 1960s, which is depicted very accurately. The plot cover murders and some affairs, but is not overly descriptive and can definitely be handled by an audience over the age of 12. This is a series that must be watched in sequence because, as it progresses, the characters and plot develop.",1512432000,,450,4.782051282051282
