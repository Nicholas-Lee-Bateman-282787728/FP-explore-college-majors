8060968,3,B0009HMTEE,"This work teaches who built the Forbidden City and its present status as tourist attraction and decaying site.  I loved seeing ancient Chinese paintings next to modern video recordings of China.  However, I hate the way Leonard Nimoy asks questions that he quickly answers, talking just to fill up time.

I'm pleased that the work uses actual Asians in its reenactments.  In the West, there is a whole history of European-derived actors ""playing Asian,"" rather than having Asians playing those roles themselves.  There are many Asian Americans in Southern California and many of them could use this credit to advance themselves in Hollywood's hypercompetitive environment.

Nevertheless, I hated how the West never comes up.  The fact that European countries carved up China during their imperialist periods is never brought up.  The work mentions eunuchs, but primarily focuses on the gossip and power struggles.  Though lacking your typical male equipment, some say eunuchs did have a sexuality, having relations with both women and men of the royalty.  Please read Hirsch's ""Passion of the Cut Sleeve"" for more information.

I think experts on Chinese history or politics would find this work risible.  But if you want to hear a quicky discussion on the Forbidden City, then you'll find this useful.",1183248000,9,1302,5.206730769230769
