6987592,5,B00SIHK22I,Im also thrilled to being able to complete my collection of Koth! Keep em coming Olive films! Thank you so much!,1428364800,7,112,4.380952380952381
6987593,5,B00SIHK22I,"I'm beyond thrilled that they're finally (FINALLY!) putting out the rest of this underrated gem of a series on DVD. It's one of my top 10 shows of all time---and, sadly, I watch A LOT of TV :) This show never got nearly enough credit for its awesomeness. It employs so many different types of humor, created a lot of incredibly multi-dimensional, distinctive characters, manages to be genuinely sweet and heartwarming without ever being cloying, is surprisingly smart and thought-provoking about certain issues (such as when it mocks certain sociopolitical extremism on either side) and just holds up so incredibly well over time and with repeated viewings. Oh, and did I mention that it's really, really funny?!

The second, third and sixth seasons are probably my very favorites of the series, but this tenth season ranks surprisingly high. (And that's a feat in and of itself---so few shows even GET 10 seasons, let alone maintain their high quality for that long a time!)  The 10th season episodes are as follows:

""Hank's on Board""

""Bystand Me""

""Bill's House""

""Harlottown""

""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Clown"" Kyounghee Lim Christy Stratton December 4, 2005 9ABE16

""Orange You Sad I Did Say Banana?""

""You Gotta Believe (In Moderation)""

""Business Is Picking Up""

""The Year of Washing Dangerously""

""Hank Fixes Everything""

""Church Hopping""

""24 Hour Propane People""

""The Texas Panhandler""

""Hank's Bully""

""Edu-macating Lucky""

My personal favorites are Bill's House, Orange You Sad I Did Say Banana? (how I love Khan!), Church Hopping, Hank's Bully, and The Texas Panhandler. Rest assured that you can't go wrong with any of these, though. I'm so glad they're finally giving us these long-awaited DVDs and can't wait to introduce new fans of all generations to this phenomenal show!",1423699200,20,1800,5.1061643835616435

I was worried about getting it after reading some reviews on how the TV ratings pop up like they do on TV ,  but just like when I watch live TV I barely noticed them.",1494892800,,343,3.8028169014084505

LOVE KOTH, MISS THE STYLE OF SHOW A TON > Hate these short seasons even though I know why they are short...

I have no issues with the aspect ratio or region, they play great for me.
Bob's Burgers is my other favorite at the moment...story telling is missing from many shows & replaced with cut-scenes & camera pandering.  Lot of people hate the slow pace compared to other quick wit shows, but KotH is a classic that is missed more each year ;)",1479859200,,580,4.351851851851852

If you don't what KOTH is or you haven't watched it before then go look for season 1 not 10. I would really recommend this show though, very funny.",1478563200,,269,4.294117647058823

6987624,2,B00SIHK22I,"No issue with the video or sound quality. I must admit I'm rather disappointed that the new distributor of these DVDs didn't bother to remove the broadcast TV ratings from the episodes. When the scenes change and the should would resume after a commercial break, you'll experience a distracting black box pop up in the corner of the screen.... Almost serves as a reminder you paid for this when you could have had the identical material if you would have just bothered to save them on your DVR.

I have three other seasons from this new distributor and this is the first season that has this issue..",1442016000,11,599,4.598130841121495

6987628,5,B00SIHK22I,"King of the Hill with Seth Macfarlane is more speedy and mocking like Macfarlane's other shows, rather than dull and subtle like the first 6 seasons of the show, but there is still much classic King of the Hill moments that fans will enjoy and more character development.

6987646,5,B00SIHK22I,"I don't care if these are just the episodes and nothing else; I'm just happy that Olive Films got the go-ahead to put these out on DVD! King Of The Hill was the ""anti-Simpsons,"" the ""anti-Family Guy,"" back during the time when most of the animated shows were risque. KOTH was a thoughtful, well-written show with decent, likeable characters. My only real beef with the show was that Peggy Hill was dumbed down significantly over the years, but nevertheless, this was a great show. Olive Films finally righted an injustice by bringing Seasons 7-10 on DVD; let's hope that the remaining three seasons will have their day, too, and soon.",1430352000,4,634,4.7727272727272725

6987653,5,B00SIHK22I,"After waiting so long for seasons 7 and beyond to come to DVD, I pre-order every season and never regret it! I love Olive Films for doing this, and I also love having discs that do not need to be flipped like seasons 1-6. King of the Hill is still one of my favorite shows. I don't pay for television channels, so among what TV I do watch, KotH is the show I watch every day without fail.",1428451200,3,388,3.9871794871794872
6987654,5,B00SIHK22I,So glad Olive Films took this up. Have bought seasons 7-10 now and the discs are in great shape and packed well. Can't wait for them to release the rest! Really love this show and it doesn't get the credit it deserves!,1428451200,,218,4.214285714285714
8698439,5,B00SIHK22I,My husband and I love KOTH and we purchase them on Amazon because we can no longer watch any episodes on Hulu or Netflix which is annoying.  Helpful to complete our collection.,1520726400,,176,4.5
8698440,5,B00SIHK22I,"You get what is advertised; another good season of King of the Hill, but a warning: I returned one because Disc 2 Episode ""24 Hour Propane People"" has a skip: When Mr. Strickland is trying a new ""fun"" Strickland Propane Dealership (near the beginning of the second half of the episode), he says ""It'll be fun; you promised."" then Hank Hill nods and the scene transitions and the audio skips and the video stalls.

That's the only problem which I have experienced on the entire episode and DVD; the rest of the episode and DVD are fine.

This stall happened on both DVD orders, suggesting to me that there was an error with the original recording, so it's unlikely that sending it back and getting another one will produce and better results; just a heads up.",1512777600,,758,4.5661764705882355

8698443,5,B00SIHK22I,One of my favorite shows.,1502841600,,25,4.2
8698444,5,B00SIHK22I,"I tell you what, man, back in 2006 Fox released the sixth season of KOTH on dvd and shortly after that they announced that they scrapped their plans to release any more seasons of KOTH. Dang it, man, Dang it! The fans went crazy and petitioned Fox to please release KOTH but we just got ignored. That is just bad business Fox, dirty pool, Fox, dirty pool. Now listen up Fox, at Strickland the customer comes first. That is right, the customer comes first. I reckon Fox needs to be schooled on that lesson.

Flash forward to 2014. After nearly nine dang years of praying for this to come out, Olive Films comes to the rescue and starts releasing KOTH on dvd. Now I read some reviews on here and I got mighty scared to buy this, I tell you what. People were saying that their screens would just go black after an episode and not return to the menu, or the dvds wouldn't play. I don't know if they got bad copies or what but the set I have plays perfectly. There are no freeze ups and my dvds go back to the main menu after each episode. Every time, man, every dang time.

Yeah man, I tell ya what, man. Those dang ol' Fox flipper dvds, man. No worries, man, no worries. All 15 uncut episodes are on two single sided dual layered dvds. Let me break it on down for y'all:

Disc One:
01 Hank's On Board
02 Bystand Me
03 Bill's House
04 Harlottown
05 A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Clown
06 Orange You Glad I Did Say Banana
07 You Gotta Believe (In Moderation)
08 Business Is Picking Up

Disc Two:
09 The Year Of Washing Dangerously
10 Hank Fixes Everything
11 Church Hopping
12 24 Hour Propane People
13 The Texas Panhandler
14 Hank's Bully
15 Edu-Macating Lucky

Video: The episodes are presented in a solid 1:33 transfer just like they aired. The colors pop and for the most part everything looks good. Sometimes I'll notice some jaggies in certain scenes but it isn't too dang bad or distracting.

Audio: English 2.0 and Spanish 2.0. The audio is clear sounding and I have no complaints.

Subtitles: English

Extras: Boy, I tell you what, man, this dang ol' set just has the episodes and nothing else. Dang ol' bare bones dvd. Dang it!",1501977600,10,2138,4.314214463840399
