1371056,4,B00004Y6BA,"This is a spooky, southern gothic film about two sisters, both haunted by their pasts. Living together in an exquisite, antebellum mansion in the bayou of Louisiana, the Bonnard sisters struggle to meet each day as it comes, running a bed and breakfast. One sister, Lucy (Jennifer Jason Leigh), is somewhat fey and seems to need a reality check. The older of the two, Charlotte (Judith Ivey) is the more grounded sister. Or is she?
Together, they run the bed and breakfast with the help of a hunky handyman and childhood friend, Etienne (Benjamin Mouton), who is sweet on Lucy, despite Charlotte's watchful eye. Charlotte also has someone sweet on her, the local sheriff, Cleve Doucet (Dennis Lipscomb), whom she is on the verge of losing, because for some inexplicable reason she refuses to marry him. One day, Matt Rutledge (Eric Stolz) arrives at the Bonnard bed and breakfast, where he is to be a guest. He, too, seems smitten by the lovely, ethereal Lucy, much to Charlotte's consternation and Etienne's annoyance.
What follows is a series of macabre events, fueled by secrets of the past and misguided perceptions. While the plot is engaging, parts of it are a little over the top. Still, it is so well done that it keeps the viewer riveted to the screen. Terrific performances are given by all, with those of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Benjamin Mouton being especially fine. The ending is also particularly memorable. Shrouded in the mists of the Louisiana bayou, it is a vindication of Lucy's visions and a fitting memoriam to love everlasting. This is a film well worth viewing. Those who enjoyed that other southern gothic, ""The Gift"", will, undoubtedly, enjoy this one, as well.",1022889600,11,1687,4.881533101045296

1371058,4,B00004Y6BA,"Long before he won an Oscar for writing Gods and Monsters, Bill Condon showed his talent with Sister, Sister -- an atmospheric slice of Southern Gothic suspense that deals with two sisters who run a hotel, a swamp that holds many ghosts, and the prerequisite deep dark secrets of the past.  If you really waste your time deeply analyzing the plot, it won't make a bit of sense by waste your time doing something as silly as that?  With excellent performances from Judith Ivey, Dennis Burkley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Eric Stoltz, this is one of the most entertaining, low budget horror films that I have ever seen.  This movie was made before Leigh and Stoltz achieved their current levels of fame and is recommended to anyone who knows them only from their more recent, more commercial films.",1001808000,4,795,4.746376811594203
1371059,4,B00004Y6BA,"This is a suspense/mystery film about two sisters who run a bed and breakfast in Lousianna.  One sister is slightly unstable, while the other is normal. One rainy weekend, murders take place.  Who of the five suspects is the killer?...
This film is very suspenseful, unpredictable and worthwhile.  If you ever get the chance to see it on cable, or rent it, go for it! You won't be disapointed.",992390400,7,393,4.666666666666667

7926607,2,B00004Y6BA,"This is just another in a long line of southern gothic films. Pedestrian script, because anyone who has seen this type of mystery thriller, knows that when all the ""evidence"" points in one direction, then  you obviously must look elsewhere. In this case, there is only one candidate left, so there is no mystery at all, despite the fact that the killer's face is not revealed. The (temporary) inclusion of three other house guests is just filler and do nothing to embellish the plot. Judith Ivey and Jennifer Jason Leigh, normally two very reliable actresses, are not particularly impressive as the mentally suspect sisters of the title, and Eric Stoltz is just plain unconvincing.",1390348800,,681,4.973684210526316

7926609,4,B00004Y6BA,"""Sister, Sister"" is a stylish and gothic-tinged tale of ghosts, lies, murder and revenge set on the bayou.  The film was directed by Bill Condon (""Gods and Monsters"") and marked an early writing credit for Joel Cohen.

The beautiful and genteel Bonnard sisters, Lucy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Charlotte (Judith Ivey), own 'The Willows,' one of those grand dame, antebellum mansions in Louisiana, which they have converted into a bed and breakfast inn after the passing of their parents.  The sisters have an outwardly tranquil, if somewhat twisted, symbiotic relationship that has its roots deep in the events of the past.

With the arrival of a new guest, an attractive congressional aide named Matt Routledge (Eric Stoltz), there is an immediate and electric attraction between Matt and Lucy.  Lucy is the younger and more emotionally fragile of the sisters--holding the key to the sisters' secretive past.  Charlotte's overprotective attitude towards Lucy (which borders on the pathological) ensures Lucy's blunted emotional growth and dependency.  As Charlotte tries to insert herself between the lovers, she causes a rift between the sisters that will soon destroy the calm of everyone's lives.

Traditional Zydeco music and a rich film score by Richard Einhorn provides an atmospheric underpinning for the candle lit rooms and beautifully manicured lawns and gazebos.  The swamp surrounding the plantation is a fitting metaphor for the duplicity of  nearly everyone--with its still black water full of unseen dangers lying just below the surface tension.  Nothing in the film is ever quite what it seems to be.

Like the very best ghost stories told around a campfire, ""Sister, Sister"" relies heavily on atmosphere and mystery--which it has in abundance.  The excessive and colorful characters reminded me of those in a Tennessee Williams' play and the talented actors fleshed out their various roles with interest.  Everywhere you look in this film there is natural and man-made beauty, and the cinematography is nothing short of spectacular.

It has been many years since I visited the South, but this is the Louisiana of my memory:  Beautiful, graceful, secretive and inexorably tied to its past--much like the Bonnard sisters.",1157673600,5,2237,5.294617563739377
7926610,4,B00004Y6BA,"Kim Farina plays Roxy, a bodaciously fine redhead who has spent the past fifteen years in a mental institution for reasons the movie never bothers to explain to us. Suddenly, after years with no change in her condition, she is declared cured and quickly released. She comes to live with her sister Merritt and the brother-in-law she is just meeting for the first time. Just to help you tell the sisters apart, Roxy is the supposedly evil sister, while Merritt is the constantly nagging, ""dragging you over cut glass""-voiced, incredibly annoying sister; personally, I'd take Roxy over Merritt any day of the week, despite the little thing she supposedly has going with black magic. Besides a few unconnected shots of Black Mass doings, a little bit of blood-letting, and some clumsy references to succubae, the satanic aspects of the film are pretty much ignored in favor of scenes featuring a scantily-clad Roxy tempting every man she meets; I have no problem with this directorial decision, nor with the one calling for several scenes of lightly gratuitous nudity. Of course, Roxy wants her sister's hubby for herself, and Merritt is convinced her sister is still insane. Things play out just as you might expect, and I for one was quite glad to see evil sustain itself without falling prostrate to the forces of good, which are in this case quite annoying and less than purely angelic, as the murderous climax of the story does much to prove.
Horror fans will want to know that there is only a small amount of gore to be found here; two incidents seem to use up the movie's fake blood reserves, creating a problem later on in the form of a slashed throat that does little more than dribble; you could nick yourself shaving and lose more blood than this particular victim spurts. With almost no special effects besides image montages, a dissatisfying amount of gore, no better than adequate acting, one completely irrelevant character, and a couple of unexplained events that make little sense on their own, you might think this movie would be a chore to sit through. Actually, I quite enjoyed Evil Sister, but this probably has a lot to do with the fact that, as I have mentioned, Kim Farina is a seductive redhead who walks around scantily clad during the majority of the movie. The fact that an upside-down version of divine justice wrapped its arms around the conclusion was just icing on the cake for me.",1054512000,2,2410,4.781774580335731
