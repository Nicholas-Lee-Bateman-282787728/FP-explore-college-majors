8268130,4,B00180R086,"I do like this product because of the pole moves in it, they are impressive but the harder ones toward the end are not explained :(. The fire poi part shows you the very basics and goes over safety and such for a WHILE. The contortion is interesting as well but neither exercises to get to that point were explained nor how to do the moves themselves. It's a good dvd if you have a lot of experience or to set goals. Don't buy for the fire though unless you want extreme beginner and your not a fast learner.",1223596800,7,508,4.141414141414141
