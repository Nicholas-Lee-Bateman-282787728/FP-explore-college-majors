8175920,5,B000NA21X6,"Contrary to Louis' earlier review, this is a great dvd about a classic dogfight over battle ravaged Guadalcanal. Saburo Sakai who Louis wrote was ""lucky"" ended the war with 60+ victories in the air against allied aircrafts. He is considered by most aviation experts to be the top pilot of WW2, but at the very least in the top 3. Pug Sutherland would also obtain ace status as the Pacific conflict continued. The battle of Sakai's Zero and Sutherland's Wildcat turned out to be a classic. Both pilots traded shots and performed amazing aerial acrobats to dodge the others blazing guns.

Fast forward to the present. A research team is able to contact a local of Guadalcanal who might know the location of one of theplanes that crash landed there. The relics of a Wildcat are proved to be that of Pug Sutherland. And it gets better. They also locate his gun and some ammo clips that may prove that his Wildcats guns were jammed. He had a moment in the dogfight where he could have severely damaged Sakai's Zero, but was unable to fire. Or did Saburo Sakai wound Pug enough to disorient the American ace? Sutherland was badly wounded in the dogfight and was forced to crash on the island, after Sakai fired a 20mm round into the Wildcat. Once Pug lande he had to escape the Japanese on the island as well adding to his misery. Sakai wasn't through either. After watching Sutherland's plane crash he went looking for more. He found what he thought to be a formation of fighter planes in the distance. He went after the formation full throttle. TO his amazement the planes turned out to be Avenger dive bombers, which had machine gunners in the back. It was too late for Sakai, the gunners lit up the cockpit of his Zero. Sending one bullet completely through his brain. Bloody and losing focus the Zero went into a dive heading for certain death. Sakai states that he had a vision of hs mother that made him regain his focus. Tears of pain helped to drain some of the blood from his eyes. What followed was probably the most amazing piece of flying in WW2 history. Sakai flew 5 hours back to Rabaul dying and barely able to stay focused. When he landed his plane a crowd of piolots and crewman gathered around amazed at what they were seeing. Sakai filld out his report before he would seek medical help, he collapsed afterwards. He lived and visited America later in his life meeting some of his aerial adversaries, including the men who shot him down. Pug Sutherland died shortly after WW2 taking off from a carrier in 1949. Both men are legends and this dvd is a fascinating look into both pilots as well as the Zero and Wildcat, which are analyzed by experts on both planes. A Must have",1213401600,6,2687,4.52880658436214
