8754166,5,B01CTFVDU4,"Cult underground filmmaker Jim Van Bebber has made some iconic cult grindhouse films that get a boost of recognition thanks to the up and coming indie film director Victor Bonacore. In this doc, we get a more personal behind the scenes on Van Bebber and his undeniable candor. From stock footage of older interviews,  to segments of his no holds barred films such as Deadbeat at Dawn (my personal favorite), My Sweet Satan, and The Manson Family , the viewer has a broad view if why Jim is labeled as the last outlaw film maker. Bonacore interviews some known faces in the genre and even scored some words from Pantera's Phil Anselmo. A very well shot documentary which finally manifested after years of assembling material and getting verything polushed for the fans. Victor Bonacore put a lot of heart and compassion into this film and its abundantly clear :
The one on one interviews between him and JVB, the Cinema Wasteland Havoc, on set video shots of Jim directing his next film Gator Green and Jims super 8 childhood films. The film serves enough for anyone to feel like a super afficianado on all things Bebber..",1466640000,,1121,4.719387755102041

8754169,5,B01CTFVDU4,"Jim is one of my favorite directors of all time, so it's only natural that I loved this documentary from beginning to end.  We get some rare glimpses into his early filmmaking forays as well as personal anecdotes from his friends and acquaintances.  It's a shame a lot of people don't know much about his work, but this doc does justice to the man and the artist.  Five supernovas!",1461283200,,381,4.492753623188406
8754170,5,B01CTFVDU4,"The man, the legend, Jim VanBebber. Love him or hate him (I love him) he's a interesting fella with a fantastic body of work. This is a great documentary about the mans life and work. It's packed full of entertaining interviews, behind the scenes shots, entertaining moments from conventions etc. If you are a fan of his work at all or independent/underground cinema I highly recommend buying this and checking it out.",1461196800,3,418,4.819444444444445
