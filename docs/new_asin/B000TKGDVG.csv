8209934,1,B000TKGDVG,Atrocious video transfer. Looks and sounds like a 3rd generation VHS tape that had sat in a hot car all summer,1514592000,,110,4.285714285714286
8209935,5,B000TKGDVG,"An all-time favorite film featuring a favorite actor, Matt Mulhern (Major Dad). It is a coming to grips with death of a parent story and turmoil in his personal life. He is an out-of-work TV sitcom actor named Francis McGowan who calls his agent constantly looking for that ""special"" new acting gig while visiting his childhood home in New Jersey finalize the effects of his late father and sell the house. At the same time, his marriage is teetering on the brink of destruction because of his depression of death of a parent and being out of work. A neighbor is a childhood friend of his and is somewhat of a vengeful looney tune played effectively by Alan Ruck (Cameron of Ferris Bueller fame) who makes it known to Francis that he took care of his father in his absence and won't let him forget it. Francis meets up with Lucy, the aptly named keeper of Lucy the Margate elephant tourist attraction in Margate, NJ. This turns into a friendship of convenience for Francis. I won't tell anymore but it is well written by Matt, also features his real life wife and kids in the film. Although never released in the USA, it did receive raves from film critics. I waited for this to be released on DVD and settled for the Region 2 (European release) since Region 1 (North American) was not available. Look for a cameo from Hal Holbrook credited as ""man on the beach.""",1505001600,,1363,4.522267206477733

8209937,5,B000TKGDVG,"Although it indicates ""All Regions""  it will not play on my equipment.  I love this film and would give anything for a copy, a copy that will play on standard US equipment.  My copy was returned, and I fear it is the same copy that is for sale here.",1386028800,,249,4.040816326530612
8209938,1,B000TKGDVG,"I bought the DVD of ""Walking to the Waterline several months ago and have never been able to find a playback machine that can read the format. Apparently the format is not standard in the USA. I don't know why I didn't complain earlier. Mike Seely",1283558400,2,247,4.391304347826087
8209939,4,B000TKGDVG,"Anyone who knows the fleeting value of ""fame"" will find this tale true and funny. I like that Mulhern put himself out there as a writer (of a story familiar to him), and director. I also found the unique shoot location (a tourist elephant on the New Jersey shore)a lively metaphor for the passing strangeness of life. Here's a guy (Mulhern)off balance following the death of his father when he visits the family summer home to empty and sell it. He's away from his current life, swept back into his childhood with gay neighbors who knew him ""when."" He finds warmth with a quirky woman (Foote)who shows him kindness and genuine regard. I found it touching and delightful. Loved the cameos by Broderick and Flanagan written with smooth economy of dialog showing the cold stone of agency people when you're no longer ""hot.""
