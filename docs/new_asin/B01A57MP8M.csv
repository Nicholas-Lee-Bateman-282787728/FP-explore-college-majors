8746466,1,B01A57MP8M,"This show is a cheap family drama/comedy about living off the grid in Alaska. While the cast is really a family, this isn't a documentary or even a reality show.

What is different about this show versus other Alaska realty shows is that there is absolutely nothing real about it. The Brown family never lived off the grid as far as anyone knows. They have not really lived in Alaska since maybe 2008. They don't own the land shown on TV. They didn't build the cabin shown. While the show is shooting, they live in a lodge in town. When the show isn't shooting, they leave Alaska to live elsewhere. The first season was actually filmed on a five acre lot in a subdivision outside town right along the highway. There were houses just outside camera range in that first season. The locals do their hunting for them (they don't know how). The Browns are really just actors.

Its just another TV show even though the cast (the Browns) pretend that its all real when the cameras are rolling.

This DVD is for areas outside the US. You can't watch it on US DVD players. If you are in the US, you need to look at Alaska Bush People: The complete season 1 and 2 also on DVD.",1461456000,,1166,4.339449541284404
