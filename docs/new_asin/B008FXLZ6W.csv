5158814,1,B008FXLZ6W,"I have been a long time Katt Williams fan and have a few other of his stand-ups on DVD. This pretty much seemed like he needed money so he put a DVD together. This isn't even comedy; he is preaching for most of it and the other part is straight politics. He makes very few jokes the entire time. He mostly warns people against the end of the world; he goes on to attack non-christians and anyone who believe in evolution. Extremely disappointing and short -- at the end, I wanted that hour of my life back.",1348531200,6,506,4.22680412371134
5158815,3,B008FXLZ6W,I watch all of his stand ups and this one wasn't nearly as funny as the rest I laughed a couple times but I wouldnt watch it again like I have all the others,1348444800,,157,3.6470588235294117
5158816,2,B008FXLZ6W,"This got to be the worst Katt's show I've ever seen. His previous shows were about making fun of things we usually ignore in regular life or attacking BS that's clearly BS and inspire people to feel better about themselves. This show, however, is all about ranting, attacking everything that he's not believing in and it's not very funny. Especially when he make fun of things he has no idea what's he talking about; evolution is wrong be cause there're still monkeys, Buddha is fat shirtless man (clearly he's never seen that keanu reeve's movies) etc. The flow of his talk isn't good either. There's always a pause in the middle of his sentence like he couldn't remember what to say. Watch his show in 2008 and watch a clip of this show on youtube, you will see a clear different.",1348358400,2,782,4.553191489361702
5158817,1,B008FXLZ6W,"I've been a Katt Willaims fan for a while and I was stoked when I saw a new special for him pop up. I decided to rent it and show it to a few friends who had never seen Katt before. It quickly turned into a nightmare however when Katt began attacking gays, anyone who's not a christian, and making claims that evolution was a joke because there are still monkeys... Clearly Katt, you don't really know how evolution works.

We continued to watch but it progressed into a train wreck. You can clearly see some members of the audience in this aren't on board either. I'm not sure where Katt was coming from in this and found it rather awkward and some what embarrassing. I wasn't aware of all the issues with the law Katt has been having in his personal life, but his anger and rage clearly comes out on stage here. This is not a normal Katt Willaims show so beware.",1348358400,15,864,4.2682926829268295
5158818,1,B008FXLZ6W,"To say that Kattpacalypse was a disappointment would be putting it mildly. Anyone who is expecting the irreverent and outrageous wit that we enjoyed in his earlier comedy specials are in for a big let down. While the beginning could have almost been considered mildly funny, it still wasn't up to par with even the most rookie comedians on tv today. By the end, he seemed to be on the verge of a complete meltdown. Maybe I was so sorely disappointed because this wasn't at all what I was expecting from a Katt Williams show and didn't know about all the arrests and crazy things going on in his personal life (which he goes into some detail about). I was just excited when I had the opportunity to watch a Katt Williams comedy special that I hadn't seen before. Apparently Katt is in the process of a downward spiral and it definitely shows in his performance. He doesn't have same stage presence, his delivery is off, his jokes were more deliberately offensive than irreverently funny. He repeatedly went off on rants about God and Satan and the end of the world that were only humorous in a ""watching a celebrity train wreck"" kind of way. There was some kind of awkward rant about Michael Jackson that never really went anywhere, at least not anywhere close to making me laugh. Worst of all, he did this whole bit about how God destroyed homosexuals in Sodom and Gomorrah which I found absolutely repulsive. He spent the entire show running maniacally around the stage sweating. The whole performance was awkward and uncomfortable and so far from the level of comedy anyone would expect from a comedian of Katt Williams standard. I hope he pulls it together because Katt was one of the best.",1348358400,10,1693,4.6466666666666665
5158819,2,B008FXLZ6W,"I love Katt Williams- I am a big fan. But this show just missed the mark in a lot of ways. To echo others, it started off strong, and then about midway through, he lost me entirely. Rants about how evolution is a joke and those that believe in it are crazy? Anti-gay statements? Attacking athiests? He seemed to get overly political, and unfortunately, not as funny. I felt alienated. Katt is a smart guy! He must know that he has to be losing fans through the message on this DVD. But... It is what it is. He needs to tighten up the political and religious stuff ala Lewis Black, or he needs to go back to talking about pimp culture...",1348012800,16,636,4.264462809917355

5158821,5,B008FXLZ6W,"This was solid comedy in my opinion. Katt Williams is known for keeping in touch with current events and this by far was a dose of reality. I think it was very personal but with what he has been through since his last stand-up special, it is only right that he comment on it, because that is reality for him. He was very in touch with what the everyday person goes through, but he also let the audience in on what he has been going through. I saw it for free on Showtime on Demand and I have no hesitations about purchasing the DVD.",1347408000,4,532,4.125
5158822,3,B008FXLZ6W,"a must have for any katt williams fan. Howvever be warned that it has less jokes in it then the other 2 shows and contains alot more preachy commentary. I probably won't buy it,after seeing it the other day at a friends...",1346976000,5,222,4.309523809523809

5158824,2,B008FXLZ6W,"I was very disappointed in Kattpacalypse. After Pimp Chronicles, It's Pimpin Pimpin, and American Hustle this just did not live up to the quality of comedy that Katt had been putting out show after show. His past stand-ups were full of one-liners and this was hard to push through as a dud. I will always love Katt's work but this didn't live up to the rest.",1476144000,,358,4.4393939393939394

5158829,2,B008FXLZ6W,He was too messed up. Which makes me sad because he is a great comedian. Not this time. It was unbearable. He was twitchy and sweating. Plus he was rambling. He is a genius at comedy. But this was not good. I know this was a few years ago. I pray he is better and back on track. Back to his talent!,1449187200,,298,3.8225806451612905

If you are ""politically correct"" this movie isn't for you, but if you like to laugh and laugh hard! Katt Williams is your guy!

I am a new fan of Katt Williams.",1399334400,,356,4.028169014084507

5158852,1,B008FXLZ6W,"**Spoiler Alert**

I LOVE Katt. Always have, always will. But this abomination of a stand up seemed rushed, preachy, and just plain ignorant. When comedians speak on current events, religion and politics, they tend to do their homework prior to running their mouth in front of millions of people. Katt decided to get his news from conspiracy theory websites and a crackhead who smoked bath salts. Save yourself the money and look it up on youtube if you really want to waste your time watching it.",1397865600,,497,4.77906976744186
5158853,2,B008FXLZ6W,"I've always loved Katt Williams' comedy. He's always been immensely entertaining with his racial humor, his physical humor, and his voice inflections. This time, though, it was off the mark. He tried Carlin-esque, attack-style political humor, but just seemed like a huge, bigoted grump; shallowly bashing atheists, evolution, homosexuals, etc. Some of it was good (when he stuck to what he was good at), but all in all, including the angry heart-to-heart near the end, it was very awkward. Perhaps Katt should've stayed retired.",1397520000,2,529,5.309523809523809
5158854,5,B008FXLZ6W,"This is highlarious.
Katt is an amazing talent.  He is a natural for sure.  He definitely knows his craft.

5158856,2,B008FXLZ6W,"I expected more...and received mediocre jokes with very little humor. I just didn't think this was funny...Maybe he should focus on being funny without the over saturation of racial stereotypes. Don't get me wrong, stereotypes are funny but this cannot be the entire basis for your show....and the stereotypes he chose to use were dull.",1394409600,,336,5.127272727272727

5158863,2,B008FXLZ6W,"Some of my fondest memories are of times huddled up with a ton of friends to put on one of Katt's big 3 specials. It was hard to tell what was more amazing; how funny the lil' dude was or how much funnier his jokes seemed every damn time.

I ignored the low ratings on IMDB (somewhere sub 5) and dove right in.

Don't.

Go throw on one of the others; you'll laugh a hell of a lot harder.",1390953600,,387,3.8734177215189876

5158868,5,B008FXLZ6W,Katt Williams is both hilarious and clever. I have several of his DVDs. My husband won't watch him because of the profanity which is admittedly frequent and probably offensive to many but I just overlook it because the laughs are well worth it to me.,1387411200,,250,4.5777777777777775
5158869,2,B008FXLZ6W,He started snapping a bit and lost the crowd on some of his comments i.e. the Obama comment and some other comments went into the stratosphere. But overall he was funny,1386892800,,168,4.451612903225806
5158870,5,B008FXLZ6W,Katt Williams always make me laugh until I cry. I love him and his comedy. He is always up on the news and makes great jokes on current events. Love this mucho!,1386028800,,160,4.03125

5158872,3,B008FXLZ6W,I like Katt Williams mostly.  This is a funny stand up and may be worth it.  I just think his other stuff is better a deserves a look before this dvd.,1384041600,,150,3.806451612903226
5158873,5,B008FXLZ6W,Katt William's Speaking the truth as always while still being gut wrenchingly funny. This stand up had serious topics people should listen and take heed too. Few entertainers speak truth and/or their own opinions about the world. Katt Williams does it without fear and I love him for it. KATT PACK ALL DAY,1381881600,,305,4.773584905660377

5158878,3,B008FXLZ6W,I wouldn't watch this with kids in the room.  He is funny and has a message to bring but it's hard to pick  out of the really heavy language.,1376265600,,141,3.8275862068965516

5158883,5,B008FXLZ6W,"Katt Williams makes me laugh like no other. His insightful material, priceless expressions and impeccable delivery make him one of a kind . He is obviously an extremely intelligent man who has an amazing gift and if you look past his comedy and listen to him during interviews you can see he has a heart as big as the audience who loves him. He was a bit more wired up at this performance but was the Katt that I love. The man has been through some very undeserved troubles lately but with his indomnible spirit I know he will continue to make us laugh. His physical comedy and his unique use of the stool as a prob is amazing he really needs to be in many more movies as well as he is a natural comic that has more than earned his right to be at the top of the list. He can make anything funny. The one downside is I was not crazy about the hair, I find Katt to be a very sexy man, his manner his confidence his spirit and his style of dressing are very appealing love how he rocks a tie and suit very classy....but the extreme flip though adding to the mood of the moment....took away from his awesome suit and his handsome face. If you like the truth delivered to you fast, furious and funny, Katt is your man. I have always been a fan of comedy and Katt has carved his own unique spot in its world. I love Katt forever and hope to see him a lot more and for many many years to come .",1371859200,,1387,4.047272727272727

5158887,2,B008FXLZ6W,"This movie didn't compare to his other stand up acts. I had high hopes because all of his previous movies are hilarious.

5158888,1,B008FXLZ6W,I loved Katt Williams up until this stand-up special--he seems to have gone a little nuts...and not in a funny way.  Where was the humor?  He spent way too much time discussing his personal fears and irrational views that I found completely un-relatable.  I want old Katt back.,1371168000,,277,4.729166666666667

5158890,5,B008FXLZ6W,"Katt is to funny, he keep you laughing. the jokes and the timing is spot on. He remind me of Eddie Griffin, however he is funnier.

5158895,4,B008FXLZ6W,"I was shocked at the low ratings this got. Katt Williams is as funny as he ever was. Considering it was NYE I'll let all the gloom and doom about the end of the world go but his other jokes were right on the money.

The man has more going on than a bunch of these reviewers know. It's his show, his money & his time, to do & say whatever he wants. I think people use comedy to escape, and too bad for them, Katt brought it so close to reality...I think it made them stop & think & question, instead of just laughing everytime he said ""n****.""

To be quite honest, I've never been a huge fan of his because it seemed all he did was talk about race & women, with the f & n-words being 90% of his ""funny."" This piece made me see a better, maybe less sensational, side of him.

Katt has basically given over his throne to Kevin Hart cause this is some BS right here.

I will say, I did chuckle a couple times watching this, but compared to his other stand up pieces, this is atrocious.  There is no comedic point of view.  He will take one subject and go on about the negative traits, the stand up for the subject with positive attributes.  You're like, huh!?

He needed an editor for the material he had and quite frankly new material.

He presents some interesting ideas about what is happening in both the political world as well as touching on topics we have encountered in mainstream media today. Towards the end of the show he does arrive at a plateau where he incites the audience to draw in and commend a sort of intimacy between himself and his audience. Katt Williams is a dynamic comedian who brings forth some thought provoking ideas and points out details that to some may not be so obvious. This is great comedy for people who listen well, remember details of the stand up, and in turn research them a bit further. All in all, this is a great show I recommend for an older audience as some of the topics he discusses are not suited for children or tween aged kids.

Ask most Gay Black men and I would think they would not agree with him. Then at the end of the show he just tops it of with a steaming pile of religious shit on gay men. Thank you Katt .

Katt has always struck me as a relatively informed and intelligent person, but his behavior was erratic and his jokes revealed some highly ignorant views. He continuously broke off in tangents and failed to finish many of his jokes, relying on the audiences affinity for him and their overwhelming applause to fill the silent void where his punchlines should have been.

5159040,3,B008FXLZ6W,"Typical Katt Williams Performance, nothing overly funny about this film and it left me disappointed. There were comedians who performed before his appearance that caught my attention, but they were given a very short spotlight on the end credits. I would have liked to see those performers entire Standup.",1350777600,,305,5.244897959183674
5159041,2,B008FXLZ6W,"Disappointed with this one.  Sorry, Katt!  I guess nothing commpares to your Pimp Chronicle days!  This performance just was not a LOL type of event.  I still love you though!",1350604800,,175,4.733333333333333
5159042,5,B008FXLZ6W,Another hilarious and insightful standup from the non apologetic Katt williams. If you are a fan of his previous dvds then this is a must get.,1350172800,2,142,4.5
5159043,5,B008FXLZ6W,This was an excellent stand-up comedy. I would recommend this particular dvd to my friends.  I give it 5 stars.,1350172800,,111,4.55
5159044,1,B008FXLZ6W,Katt Williams has lost his edge....he is not funny in the least !!!! he needs to find another line of work,1349740800,,106,4.095238095238095
5159045,5,B008FXLZ6W,"This movie is very eye opening. Even though it's funny and entertaining, truth is still being presented. Katt is trying to tell you that Jesus is Lord and He is the only way. Kattpacalpse is a great movie to enjoy and ponder",1349481600,,224,4.357142857142857
5159046,5,B008FXLZ6W,I see what he see. He's on point! Can't wait to see him perform live in concert. I'll be in line for my ticket!,1349308800,,111,3.6666666666666665
5159047,3,B008FXLZ6W,"This was not one of the best shows of his.  I ordered it before it got out, but should have just rented it from Redbox. Material was pretty new, but not his greatest.",1349136000,2,166,4.03030303030303
5159048,2,B008FXLZ6W,I understand Katt Williams has been out the game for a minute but geez. I am highly disappointed in this stand up. He has his funny moments but I honestly think he fell off. I love Katt Williams but this right here isn't cool. He needs to get back on his A game.,1349136000,6,262,3.9622641509433962
5159049,2,B008FXLZ6W,"I saw this the other night, and it was a waste of time as the Captain D's I had that night lol...What was up with his hair??? He honestly looked like he was on some serious drugs. Now don't get me wrong, there were some funny parts in it, but it's not the same Katt Williams that everyone has grown to love over the years. It seemed like he just ran out of material or something. I'll say it like this...watch for yourself and you decide. But most of the reviews on this haven't been good, and I'm putting mine into that thumb down pool lol.",1349049600,,541,4.113207547169812

5159051,1,B008FXLZ6W,"Let me first say that I am ""HUGE"" Katt Williams fan so what I'm about to say comes from the heart..................THIS STAND-UP SUCKS!!!! I was highly disappointed! He looked bad, he sounded bad, timing was off, it was horrid!! If you are a true fan of stand-up comedy and understand everythng about it, this will piss you off highly!! DO NOT BUY IT, RENT IT, WATCH IT, it will just upset you!",1348704000,5,394,4.486111111111111
5159052,4,B008FXLZ6W,"This is definitely different and apparently it is because Katt himself is different.  He has had legal troubles and clearly feels exonerated and sure of his source of victory.  He will turn off many watchers because he takes clear stances on hot button issues but he has a right to.  Let's not pretend that we do not have any topics where we choose a side to the malcontent of others.  Thats life.  As far as comedy goes, its really funny at first and slows toward the end.  But I was moved by his honesty whether I agree or not.  He was real to himself similar to Dave Chappelle toward the end.",1348617600,3,595,4.306306306306307
5159053,5,B008FXLZ6W,"I persobnally am a huge fan of Katt so getting the new movie before the bootleggers is pretty much the sh**. So i am happy with my purchase as well as shipping time, if u haven't seen it you should get on it. Its not as good as puimp chronicles but he speaks the truth in each movie.",1348617600,,283,3.896551724137931
5159054,3,B008FXLZ6W,"It was not as god as what I have seen before. He has aged and that hair? Hasn't he learned that the sweats a perm too out? Anyway, there were some real truths to what he was saying. There was truth in a lot that he was saying. Guess that isn't really funny.",1348531200,,257,3.8679245283018866

Poking fun at different racial groups can be funny...at least to me...but this guy seemed filled with a lotta scorn for folks and it didn't translate into humor very well with his ""jokes"" and commentary. Jus' sayin'...",1483833600,,296,4.94
