2806566,5,B000OZ2CQQ,"as told by John Wayne and a bunch of other entertainers, singers, dancers, and actors.  The sad part is that I am pretty sure that most of these people are now deceased.  It reminds us what it took to make America great and why we should support it even if we do not always agree with everything about it.  This is good wholesome family entertainment.  The dancers are talented and the costumes are well done.

Everyone in America should watch this at least once every July 4th.  It will give you patriotic warm fuzzys.",1189641600,33,519,4.468085106382978
2806567,5,B000OZ2CQQ,"I remember seeing the program on TV many years ago. I wanted the DVD for my collection of John Wayne memorabelia. If you consider the Duke a true American hero, this is a must have item.",1188864000,29,186,4.194444444444445
2806568,5,B000OZ2CQQ,We like John Wayne anyway and this was definetly not a disappointment.  The whole thing was great.  Many wonderful stars in it.,1187740800,9,127,4.7272727272727275
2806569,3,B000OZ2CQQ,"""John Wayne's Tribute to America"" (originally aired as the television special, ""Swing Out, Sweet Land"", in 1970), isn't great TV, or an accurate American history lesson, but it IS fun, and reflects the genuine love and pride 'the Duke' felt for his country.

The special serves best as a 'time capsule' of entertainment of the era, which will bring a smile to older viewers, but may have today's kids scratching their heads...John Wayne, as the host/narrator, introduces slices of American history, 'Hollywood 1970' style...skinflint Jack Benny retrieves George Washington's tossed silver dollar, Bob Hope and Ann-Margret entertain the troops at Valley Forge, Dean Martin invents the cotton 'gin' (get it?), Rowan and Martin are the Wright brothers, ""Bonanza's"" 'Little Joe' Michael Landon buys Manhattan Island from 'Hoss' Dan Blocker (and 'Ben Cartwright' Lorne Greene plays George Washington, in another segment, featuring Hugh O'Brien as Thomas Jefferson, and William Shatner as John Adams)...Obviously, the material is 'dated', and everything is celebrity persona-'driven'...but some moments do shine! Johnny Cash performs a terrific musical number on a locomotive, Glen Campbell is very good, as well; Bing Crosby and Roscoe Lee Browne, as Mark Twain and Frederick Douglass, have a surprisingly sensitive, if brief, conversation about racial equality (so good that it almost seems out of place, amid the sillier moments). Yes, the musical finale is a bit 'over-the-top' (and proves that most actors can't sing a 'lick'), but Wayne keeps things light and patriotic, and is obviously enjoying himself!

As another of the releases to celebrate the Duke's 100th birthday, this nostalgia piece is a wonderful addition to any Wayne collection!",1182988800,81,1743,5.5

2806571,5,B000OZ2CQQ,"Haven't seen this since the initial broadcast. At the time it was remarked that only John Wayne could produce such a spectacle for he had a whole pocket full of favors to call in from other stars on whose show he'd made appearances. And so they came, and came, and came. We see Bob Hope, entertaining the troops at Valley Forge, Jack Benny, wondering whether he could keep the dollar George Washington might have thrown across the Potomac, Phyllis Diller (""My girdle is killing me ...""), as the first female presidential candidate, Dean Martin, tinkering with his cotton ""beer"" machine, and Rowan and Martin as the Wright Brothers, unwillingly inventing airline service. At first run it seemed a bit over the top silly, which it was, but what a time capsule of everything (and everyone) we loved from the sixties!

And how refreshing to hear from people who genuinely loved their nation, building it up in faith and love. We see in the Civil War segments the acknowledgement of slavery and the hope for better race relations and yet in the well integrated cast and mutual respect we wonder whether we're gaining on the goal, or slipping back? Perhaps all the current unrest and statue smashing is less than productive after all? Back then the good work all seemed to be happening and perhaps it still is, but our eyes are deliberately being focused on the negative.

For John Wayne was a great big happy positive. Perhaps in many ways that was an ideal, one not even he could totally live up to. But the thought does give us hope. And we need hope very badly.",1508716800,,1559,4.644927536231884
2806572,1,B000OZ2CQQ,"""Patriotism""? John Wayne was a WWII draft-dodger. When he was warned that his number was coming up, he got his agent to get it deferred, telling his agent that ""it would hurt my career at this time"". While soldiers were serving and dying in Europe and the Pacific, John Wayne was playing soldier on celluloid.",1508716800,,309,4.636363636363637
2806573,5,B000OZ2CQQ,"Brilliant reminder of when Hollywood represented the American public.  When it's actors cared about the flag, our country and the Constitution.

But I was the one who insisted that the whole family sit down and watch - which is no easy task when you're talking about 7 to 25 year olds.  But afterwards, all the kids - as well as we adults - had a renewed understanding of this great country of ours, and the great people who have made it that way.  I would definitely recommend this ""Tribute to America"" to all true Americans.",1462147200,,518,4.202020202020202

2806606,5,B000OZ2CQQ,"I saw the ending song from this video on Facebook and thought my mother would enjoy it.  Little did I know that I would enjoy it as well.  It is a blast from the past (1970) and most of the jokes still work.  Some people will remember stars like Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Johnny Cash, William Shatner, and George Burns. I remembered most of the actors in the video, but what I remember most was my family gathered around the television and talking about what great talent they had.

John Wayne made this television production at a time when our country was deeply divided.  The War in Vietnam and its accompanying draft of 18 year old boys made people question why we were fighting there.  Politicians sharply disagreed with one another.  The death of Martin Luther King a few years before left the country sensitive to racial tension.  It doesn't sound much different from today, does it?

The purpose of this video was to remind us Americans of our core values.  Without being preachy, the video presents vignettes in American history, acted out with a touch of comedy thrown in.  There were musical numbers that I could have done without, but my mother loved.  The set designs were surprisingly good.  The acting was what you would expect when you put comedians in sketches.

A few nostalgic touches were the extra features.  There was a guest appearance of John Wayne on a black and white TV show called What's My Line.  There were also some old Budweiser commercials showing that the Clydesdale horses used to go to small town parades.  All in all, this video was definitely worth the money.",1458950400,4,1594,4.655913978494624
2806607,5,B000OZ2CQQ,Just as I remembered it from years ago.  It was wonderful seeing all of that talent again.,1457568000,,90,4.294117647058823

2806677,4,B000OZ2CQQ,"This was good and I liked the history of America but thought in places was a little too silly.  I do realize this was a program done by John Wayne and many of his guest and that was the kind of humor from those good times ago so could accept.  I wanted the DVD for a younger person in his 50's  as John Wayne is Really his hero. I probably should have gotten John Wayne's quotes or maybe an All American Icon John Wayne.  Might have to do this in the future.

Thank  you for allowing me to give my reviews.

2806760,5,B000OZ2CQQ,"America is still the greatest country in the world.  Let' keep it that way.  This tribute conveys the Spirit of America as presented by actors of character who loved America back in the 70's.  There were plenty of people including the acting profession who cared about America in those days.  Actors who cared enough to put themselves out to go to entertain troops in potential danger zones.  How often do we see this today?  In general I have less respect for the self centered, indulgent actors of today but having said that there are some fine actors today.  As presented it conveys Americans as a hard working people who refused to give up that made America prevail and grow.  We can not afford to loose that in today's competitive world.  As I watched this I became emotional and wondered if today's self indulgent children focused on games and cell phones will learn to be competitive in the new world economy.  Who is going to help them grow into those shoes.  We were competitive In spite of our many problems in the 70's.  I would recommend this tribute to everyone and as they watch it I hope they get it.",1409011200,2,1115,4.547738693467337

As the old saying goes, the Duke is probably rolling over in his grave with the way America is going today. I grew up in those days in the 60's and 70's and I hope more tributes and television specials will be made available from that era. Thanks for the memories.",1408320000,,438,3.8777777777777778

2806774,5,B000OZ2CQQ,I thought I already did this but here goes. John Wayne was a great red blooded American & this DVD  expresses all that. He even chose great entertainers to help him so there is lots of humor in it also historical information great for kids to watch. The music is good although a bit long for my taste but does not diminish how good this DVD is. Make an effort to get it & sit and enjoy John Wayne. No other actor has been known by 4 generations & the young ones now never tire of seeing him. I have most all his films but the very beginning & hope to find some one day.,1408060800,,569,3.9478260869565216

Are some of the jokes kind of hokey?  Yeah, they are, but they are funny too.
The cast is great.  Bob Hope has his golf club, some great singing and picking happening too.  Good to see Glen Campbell, Roy Clark, Johnny Cash and more.  Red Skelton is in this, when was the last time you thought about him?  :)  Even George Burns!

We need more historical reminders of who we are as our schools teach less and less about our exceptional country; founded on an interesting concept: Freedom of Man.  Why do you never hear about people trying to break out of America?  Americans want a chance at the American dream to succeed.  John Wayne - R.I.P.,1406332800,,426,4.808219178082192

Even though this DVD is full screen only, you will enjoy the entertaining way the history of the U.S. is presented with so many stars chipping in with the Duke to make it work.  Nice tribute to our beginning as a the U.S.A. and some good historical references throughout.  Only flaw I saw was the edited and cut off clip that is included as a special feature where Wayne appears on the old What's My Line game show.  It would have been nice to see the entire thing, but otherwise this DVD is good one to have around and pop in every July 4th, and for the price it's a bargain.",1394323200,4,677,4.106060606060606

this country and often got very emotional about it. You were
walking on his fighting side when you ran down this country.
Age, back and shoulder problems, and Army Chief of Staff General
George Marshall kept him out of World War II. Morale was lower
than a rug after the attack on Pearl Harbor and days later
Hitler declared war on America. Marshall needed movie heroes
to help boost confidence and Wayne, the most popular and
recognizable, was recruited. Putting him in uniform was out
of the question. If he was captured he would be paraded
through the streets of Tokyo and used for propaganda purposes.

It is the sort of PRO-AMERICA program you would expect John Wayne (the host) to be involved with; the type of program that be aired NOW on network TV! Bob Hope, Lucy, Jack Benny, The ""BIG 3"" from Bonanza (Lorne Greene, Michael Landon & Dan Blocker), music from ANN MARGARET, GLEN CAMPBELL, JOHNNY CASH & more. Some of the group musical numbers DO look like they were done in the 60s (the show came out in 1970) & today? Well, think of them as the rest spots from the far better story/skit elements of the program. The cast sings GOD BLESS AMERICA at the end, each singing a line, and it is just beautiful, even though some can barely carry a tune (Poor Jack Benny looked SO uncomfortable singing the 5 words he had, lol!).

It seems like all the new movies stars have the same things in common - sex, violence and foul language movies.

If you get this product, your young children can sit down and watch a decent program.  You don't have to worry about them hearing foul language and/or seeing sex plus violence being used.

This is not a 'cornball' endorsement of America...It is a celebration...F.Scott Fitzgerald said, ""France was a Land, England was a People, But America was an IDEA""...and this DVD pays tribute to that IDEA...That people of all races and religions could live, work and create together...
He doesn't shy away from looking at our faults as Crosby's Mark Twain and Browne's Frederick Douglas discussion proves...
While a devout Conservative he gives liberal Tommy Smothers the spotlight to read a stirring speech on the value of dissent...This was after the Smother's brothers show had been cancelled..Duke truly felt that, agree with him or disagree with him, EVERYONE should have the right to state their point of view (a belief that the champions of so called Political Correctness would crticize that they try to stifle all who disagree with their view)

The Movie:
Not at all what I thought it was I thought it was a documentary lots of grand canyon shots ect. Well it's a variety comedy show about the good ole USA.It is very good has many big starts in it Michael Landon, bob hope, most of the Bonanza cast ect. It is very enjoyable and a treat to watch.

The Video:
I watch mine on a 42inch Hitachi plasma so that said it is clear but has its age shown you can easily tell they did not intend to distribute this movie. No efforts we taken o preserve its film and it was shot for TV. It is watch able but washed with bright colors like many of the 70's TV shows on DVD . It doesn't jump and is very clean.

The Audio:
Well I had her on 1000 watts of sonny surround sound which is overkill for a 1.0 mono show. It is crisp clean and no noise easy on the ears

The Extras
Original Commercials with John Wayne and ed McMahon
First one is a Budweiser commercial with a lot of singing kind of odd when you think of today's commercial

Second Another Budweiser commercial
About Clydesdale horse and how much they use them in parades

Third
About the bud symbol with Ed McMahan

Fourth
John and Ed in a saloon talking bud(noticing a theme here)

Fifth
