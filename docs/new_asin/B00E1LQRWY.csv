5883286,5,B00E1LQRWY,"For those that don't remember or might not be aware of the real life incident that took place on January 1, 2009 - here's a quick refresher (no, this will not spoil the movie viewing experience).  Oscar Grant III was traveling aboard the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) with a group of his friends (returning from San Francisco) after a night of festivities for New Year's Eve.  A fight broke out on the train, involving Grant, leading to a police response at the Fruitvale BART Station platform in Oakland.  Upon their arrival, the responding officers detained Grant and a group of his friends.  In an attempt to restrain Grant, one of the officers fired his gun into Grant's back while he was face down on the ground - allegedly/mistakenly grabbing his gun instead of a Taser.  The incident was recorded via cell phone by several onlookers aboard the train.  This incident also led to a handful of protests, some of which turned to violence.  Eventually, the incident led to a high profile criminal trial for the officer that fired the shot.  In the days leading up to the incident, Grant was in the midst of making some important life changing decisions, which are the subject of the independent film, Fruitvale Station.

Making his directorial debut, Fruitvale Station is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Michael B. Jordan as Oscar Grant.  The film, based on a true story, begins as Oscar discusses his cheating indiscretion with his girlfriend and mother of his daughter, Sophina (Melonie Diaz).  Recently, Oscar has fallen on hard times, losing his job and is unsure of how he'll make money to help support his family, outside of selling drugs - for which he had already been to prison.  It also happens to be Oscar's mother's birthday and he's making preparations to celebrate with his family for dinner.  After the gathering, Oscar, Sophina, and their friends, head to San Francisco to celebrate the New Year.  However, their return trip leads to a devastating and highly controversial incident.  Octavia Spencer, Kevin Durand, and Chad Michael Murray also star in supporting roles.

This film rests solely on the shoulders of Michael B. Jordan, and succeeds because of it.  If you're unfamiliar with his work, you're most likely not alone.  Jordan, a rising star in Hollywood, has previously had notable roles as Vince Howard in the final two seasons of NBC's Friday Night Lights and as Reggie Montgomery for two years on the daytime soap opera, All My Children.  His transition from television to film has clearly been smooth as he continues to impress with his knack for dramatic roles - and this role as the late Oscar Grant is no exception.  It's difficult to know how close the film's character is in comparison to the real life person, but Jordan's character is portrayed as conflicted and desperate to turn his life around.  He realizes he's made a great many mistakes in his life and wants to be a responsible provider for his family.  There are many admirable qualities about the type of man Oscar Grant is trying to be, and Jordan undoubtedly has the acting tools necessary to bring the intensity and emotion to this character's tragic final moments.  It truly is a remarkable piece of acting by this young, talent actor.

Several themes can be taken from the outcome of this film, most notably that people do have the power to change if their desire to do so is strong enough.  The importance of family and relationships are also focused upon heavily over the course of this film, as Jordan's character is portrayed as a loving father, flawed (yet devoted) boyfriend, a beloved friend, and caring son.  Along with the power of change and the importance of family, other notable themes, including responsibility and loyalty, both contribute to the heavy dose of underlying thematic elements within this film.  Additionally, it's quite possible the greatest message of them all in this film is that life is a gift and you never know when tragedy will take it away.  Life is to be cherished, and never taken for granted.

First time director, Ryan Coogler, has an impressive debut on his hands, no doubt setting the bar rather high for his next endeavor.  The plot and characters mesh masterfully as the film operates with a smooth, continuous flow.  Coogler even incorporates a clever text message pop-up, which plays an integral part of the story (almost like a comic book balloon caption).  The pop-up idea truly is an act of sheer brilliance, which helps keeps the audience well informed with the information that comes and goes from Grant's cell phone over the course of his final day and night.  While Coogler clearly did his homework for the character, there is one scene in the film that has been admittedly incorporated as complete fiction - that being a scene where Grant befriends a dog while at a gas station.  Allegedly, the scene was used to simply fill a gap in the day for which Grant's activity were unaccounted.

Overall, director Ryan Coogler and actor Michael B. Jordan collaborate for one of the best acted and most moving films of 2013.  It's completely understandable why this film received such a high amount of attention and praise at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival.  However, it's unfortunate that it had to be over such a tragic event.  Still, the film pays homage to the loving memory of Oscar Grant.  Fruitvale Station portrays a sad, heartbreaking true story that ended with very little consequence.  While it's impossible to determine whether or not the police officer really did make a mistake by reaching for his gun instead of a Taser, a jury deemed that the officer made a mistake.  Sadly, it was an incident that cost a young man his life.  He was taken at such a young age, and unfortunately, no one will ever know what type of man Oscar Grant would have become had he not been tragically killed.

5883287,4,B00E1LQRWY,"""Fruitvale Station"" (2013 release; 90 min.) brings the last day of Oscar Grant, a 22 yr. old African-American who was killed when returning on the BART train from the New Year's Eve celebrations in San Francisco.

The movie opens in shocking fashion, with the actual cell phone footage that was taken of the events in Fruitvale Station, which is like opening a movie with a suckerpunch to your stomach. After that, the events of the last 24 hrs. unfold, and  we first see Oscar and his girlfriend Sophina arguing, as Sophina found out he had cheated on her. Later on we als learn some other less rozy things about Oscar (jail time a few years back for reasons not mentioned, although probably drug dealing; just recently losing his job at a local grocery store for tardiness; etc.). So Oscar is not the immediately likeable character or innocent angel. Yet as that 31st December unfolds, we also see Oscar being close to his young daughter, being kind to his ""momma"" and his ""grandma"", and his close friends, and deciding to make things better in his life. Not much really ""happens"". The last 20-25 min. retell the events of what happened in the train ride and at Fruitvale Station, and also the aftermath. Let me be upfront: even though we already know how it all is going to turn out, I was STILL shocked, and upset, and moved to tears.

Couple of comments: this movie made a huge splash when it was first shown at the 2013 Sundance film festival, and with good reason. Kudos to first time writer-director Ryan Coogler for an outstanding delivery on all levels. Also noteworthy is the performance of Michael B. Jordan as Oscar. Jordan had already gained acclaim for various TV roles but since I don't watch a lot of TV shows, this was my first exposure to him and I was very impressed. We surely have not seen the last of him. And Octavia Spencer is her usual solid self in the role of Oscar's mother.

I had been looking forward to this movie, and when it opened today here in Cincinnati, I went to see it right away. The screening was well attended for a matinee showing (and heavily tilted towards African-Americans, I might add). I hope this movie becomes a runaway hit as it deserves and NEEDS to be seen. ""Fruitvale Station"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1374796800,5,2255,4.601990049751244
5883288,3,B00E1LQRWY,"Anyone who followed the news in 2009 already knows how this will end: BADLY! I really, really did NOT want to screen this movie because it's based on a true, news-making tragedy that took place in the Bay Area early in the morning of New Year's Day, 2009. Based on a script by writer/director Ryan Coogler, we follow Oscar Grant as he goes through December 31, 2008, the last day of his messed-up life.

We see:
  * Michael B. Jordan (""Parenthood"" and ""Red Tails"") does a terrific job as Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old who has several things going on in his life: A mother who loves him; a girlfriend who is trying to forgive; a daughter he adores; the loss of his job; and rent that is due.
  * Melonie Diaz (Lots of TV) is Oscar's concerned fiance. She can see him clearly, but still loves him.
  * Ariana Neal (""Footloose"") is Oscar's daughter; she tries to talk him out of his New Year's party because she is afraid.
  * Octavia Spencer (""The Help"") is marvelous as Oscar's mother, who talks him into riding the train on New Year's Eve because he and his friends will be celebrating the holiday.
  * Chad Michael Murray (""One Tree Hill"") and Kevin Durand (""Lost"") as the transit officers who pull the trigger.

My companion felt Oscar was really trying to turn his life around. His main motivation was his love for his family, which in turn made him reexamine his behavior. This still didn't dull his hair-trigger temper, but he seemed to be moving in the right direction.

If there is a lesson here, it would be: Keep your life in order because you never know when it may end.

Captions on the DVD from Amazon will be a big help.",1374710400,3,1630,4.426174496644295
5883289,5,B00E1LQRWY,"In trying to adequately describe this film by the young  director Ryan Coogler, you run out of superlatives. It is a fantastic, sad movie that hits you in your gut.  ""Fruitvale Station  covers the last day in the life of a young African American man and is based on the true story of Oscar Grant III.  It is pretty much impossible to describe what happens in the film without giving away  the story. On the other hand, the case of Mr. Grant received wide spread publicity in this country in 2009 and the film opens with actual live footage of what took place from the cell phone of a bystander at the Fruitvale Station BART stop on that awful New Year's Eve.

Michael B. Jordan as  Oscar and has said in interviews that he could have literally been the young  man he plays.  He gives a totally brilliant performance, creating a character that is in every sense of the word all too human. He is neither saint nor sinner. We understand that he may not have always remained faithful to his girl friend Sophina (played by Melonie Diaz) and mother of his daughter. He has spent some time in prison, and  has recently lost his job for being late too many times. He, however,  is a devoted, loving  father who adores his young beautiful daughter, is a dutiful son to his mother (Octavia Spencer recently seen in ""The Help"") and, portrayed by Mr. Jordan, is completely sympathetic.

The film has many wonderful, touching moments: the scene with Oscar and the pit bull, the scene in the hospital when his mother-- surely both Mr. Jordan and Ms. Spencer will receive Oscar nominations-- offers up a prayer for her son (""We must lift Oscar up"") that comes close to making Christians out of all of us, the shot of her later slowly walking down the hospital corridor, her words that will tear your heart out-- ""he never liked being alone.""  It is difficult to believe that such a brilliant film as  ""Fruitvale Station"" is the first full length movie made by Mr. Coogler.

That this movie was released just days after the verdict in the George Zimmerman murder trial in Florida and is  based on a true event  of course is just another poignant reminder of the continuing and never ending -- it seems-- struggle that young African American men face as they are perceived  and treated by  the police  in this country. I remember years ago when I taught in a  private black college in Florida having my eyes opened when I learned from my students that  every  black mother---particularly poor ones--  in this country has a fear that her son will wind up in prison. I do not believe that was the worry of poor white mothers, and certainly not those of the middle class, in the community where I grew up.

This haunting film has opened to universal praise from the critics as well it should.",1374537600,4,2772,4.527162977867203
5883290,5,B00E1LQRWY,"While it didn't garnish the prestigious critical acclaim in the award season as initially predicted, that won't stopFruitvale Station from being continually referenced in years to come, both socially and politically as well as a movie that will likely be referenced in film classes for the next 20 years. Despite its grim, it is somewhat refreshing to see an independent and unsafe movie usher itself into the mainstream (mind you it was a summer release) and really challenge the American ideology of second chances at what point do you earn them, or capable of bringing yourself to achieve them? Is there an attempt on the filmmakers part to infuse opinionated social agendas, or are they able to construct a film that refrains from opinions and reenacting scenes without bias. First time director Ryan Coogler admits (BluRay behind the scenes) to being a native of the area, and how the shooting of Oscar Grant affected him, while producer Forest Whitaker admits to political agendas of race equality. Yet even when knowing that, Fruitvale Station refrains from opinions and reenacts scenes without bias. Michael B.Jordan comes into his own by taking up the identity of Americas quintessential Gen-Y African-American, ever combating the image of gang-banger vs. the victim.",1514419200,,1276,5.199029126213592

Surprised it didn't play more at the local theaters as is provides a pointed commentary on Oakland and the interactions between the police and local citizenry.  For those naysayers - the movie is about Oscar Grant, not about the BART police department. If you want a movie about the police, I suggest producing your own movie.

I think the good reviews are because of the subject matter because I can't see how they can be for the actual artistic merits of the film. The low budget shows in every scene. In fact the film looks amateurish. I've seen many low budget films made to look as if much more money was spent on them, when in the hands of a talented director. Unfortunately, this is not one of those films, or directors. The film's pacing was glacial. It seemed as if someone had told the director that it was important to drag out each scene as long as possible, to add importance. The only thing it added was time, and excruciating boredom. Then there's the acting. None of the actors in this movie made me feel for their characters in any way. It seemed as if they had been chosen from an open casting call for high school students. I could go on picking this movie apart, believe me, I could. But I've already wasted way too much of my time on it. The time is ripe for a serious film to tackle these issues.

Michael B.

5883473,5,B00E1LQRWY,"Moving account of a true story. Shows Oscar Grant in real life trying to get his life together and having a tough time doing so, but with a good heart and potential as a young husband and father. A New Year's celebration with his girlfriend and other friends goes to hell when a guy he used to have feuds with in the state pen recognizes him and attacks him, starting a brawl on a train car. When cops try to control the situation, it escalates, and Oscar may have made it worse by not cooperating fully with the cops. Whatever his issues, and he had a few, he didn't deserve to die that night.

But questions of possible excessive force remain on the case, and it's timely to watch in light of the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown and Eric Garner cases. Ultimately the goal of the producer, director and cast was not to vilify but to understand, and the advantage of getting this in DVD is we get to hear their comments in interviews.

Are we protesting? Not nearly enough.

5883593,5,B00E1LQRWY,"This is a quiet, understated film that reminds me of Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant.""  The ostensible point of the film, the fateful moments at the titular Fruitvale Station, should be well known to anyone in the audience.  If not, the film opens with hand-held footage showing exactly what is looming for Oscar Grant.

As in ""Elephant,"" the film is less concerned with the specifics of the event than the rather ordinary day that leads up to it.  Ordinary in that Oscar is one of the most well rounded characters in recent cinema, and Michael B. Jordan is the reason to see this film.  Over the course of the day, we see Oscar intimidating a co-worker, attempting to cheat on his long-term girlfriend, lovingly caring for his daughter, trying to organize a family gathering and fighting with belligerent drunks on a train.

Oscar isn't a saint or a villian, he's a complex person navigating the different roles he must play during the day: partner/boyfriend, father, tough guy with friends, sensitive guy with girls.  One of the most complex moments is when he pauses to care for a dog that has been hit by a car.  He calls for help; none comes.  He strokes the dog as it whimpers.  He waits as it dies.

The tragic true story of 22-year-old Oscar Grant III, who was fatally shot by an Oakland transit-police officer on the morning of New Years Day, 2009, following an altercation on a train. Viral video footage at the scene showed he was completely apprehended and posed no threat.

What did I think?

We follow Grant (Michael B. Jordan, who fans of The Wire will remember as the equally ill-fated young Wallace) on what is to be the final day of his life. Hes no angel and has done time in prison but he is turning his life around and genuinely cares for his girlfriend and daughter. After his mothers (The Helps Octavia Spencer) birthday, Grant and his friends celebrate a fateful New Years Eve on the town. A very well-acted dramatization that is thoroughly deserving of its two Sundance awards. Not a feel-good hit.",1403913600,,833,4.691780821917808

This movie encapsulates the American dream--with its plusses and minuses, joy and sadness. It ends as an American nightmare. You feel for all the people involved and so the tragedy gets into your skin and lingers.

He was living in an apartment with his biracial daughter and Hispanic girlfriend, who was also the mother of that child. He lost his job but tried to get it back. He helped a young Caucasian woman he did not know regarding what fish she should fry. At first, he disrespected and cursed around his mother when she visited him in jail. But, he treated her better later and even listened to her about riding the train. She was regretful when she found out that he was killed ""accidentally"" by the police at Frutvale Station.

5883667,5,B00E1LQRWY,"It took me some time after watching this film to calm down enough to write this review.

I had read about the incident it depicts, but I had no clear cut idea of exactly what went down. The fact that it happened at all is disconcerting and it should make you angry. Increasingly acts of violence against people of color here in the US, even those acts committed by law enforcement, have no consequence or at least watered-down consequences for those who commit these acts. Fruitvale Station delineates the preceding 24 hours in the arc of the commission of one such act.

When you really dig into what happened to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was shot to death by someone who THOUGHT he was a bad guy... and got away with it with no penalty, you begin to realize there are two systems of justice in America: one for whites and one for people of color.

Fruitvale Station opens with the actual video shot on a cellphone that shows what the police did in this instance.

Michael B. Jordan portrays Oscar Grant and the role is a real step up in overall performance level as an actor. He's quite well known for his work in television series with recurring roles in The Wire, All My Children, and Friday Night Lights chief among them. As you watch this performance, it feels real. He gets us to understand that people are NOT created equal... at least not here in America.

Ryan Coogler is a first time director here and the spare screenplay (in most scenes, there's plenty of breathing room between the segments of dialogue), very sharp direction, and the quality of the performances he elicits from his cast belie that fact. This is one marvelous directorial effort from first frame to last.

This movie is an Oscar winner and is quite deserving of that honor. It is fascinating if not so enjoyable to watch. You can't take your eyes off it once it starts. While this film is the depiction of a tragedy, it is a joy to experience.",1398297600,,1944,4.524216524216524
5883668,4,B00E1LQRWY,"""Fruitvale Station"" is a dramatization of the day that led up to the shooting of Oscar Grant III, a 22 year old young man, by police officers New Year's Day in 2009.  The movie does not try to paint Mr. Grant as a saint.  He is an ex-con who can't hold a job, has issues with drugs and struggles with his relationship.  At the same time, like any multifaceted person, he cares for his family and is trying to do right by the hand dealt him.

There is a fine line between holding a person responsible for their actions and blaming society for the person being put in unreasonable circumstances in the first place.  I think ""Fruitvale Station"" does a good job of not really diving into that argument.  Rather, the film simply says, ""this is who Oscar Grant is on this particular day"".

A possible criticism of the film is that it does not give equal time to the police perspective.  This argument is irrelevant.  First of all, we have the actual footage of all the onlookers which show exactly how the police overreacted and mishandled the situation.  The shooting of this young man was inexcusable and, speaking as a person who grew up in the Bay Area, this continues the long tradition of brutal, corrupt, and racist behavior by the police in the Bay Area (anyone remember Mayor Moscone and Harvey Milk?).  There is no ""other side"" or ""other perspective"", the death of this young man was inexcusable.

One criticism that I will agree with is that the filmmakers do err in possibly going a little overboard to make the character likable, such as having him cry over a dog that was hit by a car or choosing that day to give up dealing drugs.  Those feel like forced decisions to garner sympathy.  If they were meant to be symbolic, it felt rather ham-handed.  The audience doesn't need situations like that to make us like the character.  Even if Grant was a complete scumbag (we only know what the film presents us in one day), that does not change the issue that he did not need to die.",1398297600,,1986,4.475

5883692,4,B00E1LQRWY,"Fruitville station...Fruitville station...was that about the crazy guy shot by police?  NO!  Too many incidents like this happen--it becomes hard to keep them straight.  Most often we hear about them for one or two days in the news, and then they vanish.
This is a ""docu-drama""--a portrayal of the events that led to the unjustified shooting of a young black man at a BART station early on New Year's Day.  As such, it sounds like it will be highly polemic, or very depressing.  I found it not exactly either one.  The script writing and direction and acting realistically depicted a few days in the life of a young black man, his girlfriend and children, his family and friends, over the course of a couple days leading up to and including the shooting.  It was sensitively done, not over-romanticizing the character and making him out to be a saint, but very briefly depicting some prior run-ins with the law, resulting in several arrests and at least one prison term before he was even 22 years old.  Nevertheless, it shows he was really struggling to avoid falling back into bad habits: to be a better father, son, boyfriend, hopefully husband, and to find honest employment.  If the movie falls down in any area, it would be a relative lack of analysis of the macroeconomic trends in our country, creating a class of permanently unemployed [or else, illegally-employed]-- mainly for those without the right education or the right job-skills; especially those living in blighted city-environments where jobs are hard to find, hard to keep, and don't pay enough to support a family; especially for young people; especially for young males; especially for young males of color.  But that was not the intent of this movie.  The intent was to personalize this problem: as experienced by Oscar Grant, by his girlfriend, his daughter, his mother and his friends.  Although their parts were performed by actors, at the very end of the film we very briefly see the scene of a protest at the location where he was shot, which includes the real mother, the real daughter, and other grieving family members.  This was both a very personal, and a universal tragedy, unfortunately.  It was well-done and well worth watching.",1396828800,,2215,4.872
5883693,5,B00E1LQRWY,"The worst thing about this movie is it was not nominated for an oscar. Yes, ""12 Years a Slave"", ""The Butler"", and many other deserving films were just as worthy, but this film is if you were living with the people who the story was about. Amazing first time director, and many first times in the cast told a story that should not have happened, but did. Go ahead, see it; it will remind you of the savage society we live in, but ignore the lies and dismiss someone's future.",1396742400,,474,4.277777777777778
5883704,4,B00E1LQRWY,"I am always a bit weary by what Hollywood shows in a movie that has a racial or other ""social"" issue that it centers on.  I know this was a true story and this young man was shot & killed by the police.  Horrible on all counts.  But let's face it, this story tells one side and one side only and Hollywood almost ALWAYS has an agenda even if it's a movie that you wouldn't think has anything to do with a social issue.  They can't help themselves, they just GOTTA get the dig in.  If it went down EXACTLY like this, then my God, what tragedy and I couldn't be happier knowing that cop is off the force (should be in jail).

Regardless, the actors were excellent, and this young man Michael B. Jordan has, I hope, a wonderfully successful career ahead of him.  I saw him on an interview on some morning show, and he seems to be a fine young and charming man",1396656000,3,856,4.120481927710843

5883706,4,B00E1LQRWY,"Ryan Cooglers first feature-length film Fruitvale Station is based on the real-life 2009 shooting of Oscar Grant at Fruitvale Station, Oakland, but those who want to know more about what happened on the fateful New Year's Day may be disappointed. This is a film dramatization of the last twenty-four hours of Oscar Grant (played by Michael B. Jordan), except some actual video footage inserted.

So the comparatively short film (only 85 minutes) is more like an attempt to put a human face to the victim of the shooting than a record of the incident itself, and it largely works. The film is most effective when Octavia Spencer (The Help) as Oscars mother is on screen, bringing an emotional reality to the role.

We don't really know how much of the screenplay is based on the actual events. Did Oscar Grant befriend a stray dog at the gas station? Some scenes look forced, some drawn-out. Of course this is the directors version on the life of Oscar Grant, but thanks to the solid acting from the star Michael B. Jordan, and Fruitvale Station is a compelling drama.",1396483200,,1067,4.731182795698925

Difficult to watch, as viewers are already aware of the horrifying events to come, but Michael B. Jordan does a particularly compelling job of making it even more difficult to look away.  Grant hasn't led the most idyllic life, but on this particular day seems just on the cusp of evolving in an incredibly positive fashion....only to have it all come to an end in a matter of minutes.  Tragic, gut-wrenching, but a definite must-see.  A powerful story.

He runs into the wrong people at the wrong time and gets mobbed on the train by some thugs. Once the BART officers get to the scene to break it up, an officer shoots the unarmed man dead.

5883753,4,B00E1LQRWY,"I had heard somewhat of this event but nothing in depth so I was curious to watch the movie. Similar to other movies, especially true events, that call into question the actions of individuals in our society and our society as a whole, Fruitvale Station is not an easy movie to watch. The story of a man shot by a BART officer while face down on the ground on New Year's Eve is one that shocks and stays with you.

The events of the day leading up to his death and the impact leaves you wondering for a long time after the movie ends. I would put this in the same category as 12 years as a slave - in that it forces you to think about the wrongs we as a society allow even though we're uncomfortable with them. It's not an easy movie to watch and I was certainly depressed after watching but it's powerful, impactful and thought provoking.

The writing and acting are phenominal and I hope it gets all the acclaim it deserves. I only gave 4 stars because I was left feeling uneasy due to the subject matter but not the fault of the movie.",1395014400,,1038,4.185
5883764,5,B00E1LQRWY,"If you are going to watch Fruitvale Station it is a good assumption you are familiar with the events that inspired the movie.  Even if you are not, the film will spoil the ending with the opening scene that features cell phone footage of the event that ends with a solitary gun fire.  The move then gets fictionalized with Oscar Grant waking up the same day.  He is a father raising his daughter with her mother.  This is not a fluff piece on Grant to make us to easily hate how the story ends for him.  This is the story of his last day warts and all.  He is awoken to an accusation of infidelity (which he cops to), he has severed time for dealing drugs and he still had one foot in that world.

The complexity only makes the movie better.  But it is the acting that makes the movie worth watching.  Anyone who has seen Friday Night Lights knows just how good an actor Michael B. Jordan is, and that talent is on full display as a lead actor going head to head with Oscar winner Octavia Spencer as his mother.  Jordan shows a wide range as a guy trying to get by and not sure if he should do it by any means necessary or in a way that will make his daughter and mother proud.

The DVD also has two Special Features.  There is the behind the scenes featurette Fruitvale Station; The Story of Oscar Grant about of the story made it to the screen an half an hour Question and Answers session with the cast and filmmakers.",1395014400,,1420,4.180147058823529

5883818,5,B00E1LQRWY,"This movie shows us the events that led up to the execution of a young Oscar Grant. The acting, writing and shooting were superb. Michael B. Jordan will now become a household name after his great performance. Octavia Spencer deserves an oscar for her role as the mother. Forrest Whitaker deserves one for producing this.  The movie has Oscar talking back to the police. On the actual youtube video he is not talking back. In fact he is taken and placed in a location to be executed. Many of the right wing nuts who saw this film started their conspiracies and attacked Oscar Grant even though Grant was the victim. It is said that the police officer thought he was tasering him. That is a bunch of bull. Anyone knows the difference between a taser and a gun. This reminded me of  an execution that happened in Brooklyn by the white police and young black men. A young man 14 years old was sitting on his stoop. A police car rolled up and an officer named Robert Torsney jumped out of the car and shot the teenager at point blank range in the head.

Here is an excerpt of this execution. On Thanksgiving Day in 1976 an officer named Robert Torsney fired a bullet into the head of Randolph Evans, 15, outside a housing project in Brooklyn. No one could figure that one out. Officer Torsney would later claim he had been afflicted with a rare form of epilepsy that, remarkably, had never been noticed before the killing and was never seen after it.

The ''epilepsy'' defense worked. Officer Torsney was acquitted of any criminal wrongdoing.

Another killing that happened in New York was when a police officer named Thomas Shea killed a 10 year old Black child name Clifford Glover. Here is an excerpt from that incident  - One April morning in 1973 a veteran police officer named Thomas Shea pulled his service revolver and blew away a young black boy on a street in Jamaica, Queens. He shot the kid in the back. There was no chance of survival. Afterward, no one could figure out why the officer had done it. There was no reason for the shooting, no threat to Officer Shea of any kind. The boy's name was Clifford Glover and he was 10 years old.

We now move up to the killings of Jordan Davis and Trayvon Martin. Obviously from all the police acquitals and lame excuses, white citizens are starting to think they can execute blacks and get away with it too. They are creating special coded laws to be applied by whites only to execute against blacks. In any case get this movie. It is heart wrenching and shows the pattern that led to the death of Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis.",1394323200,,2581,4.490405117270789

5883822,4,B00E1LQRWY,"Fruitvale station was hard to watch because of the true life behind the film. I was worried the film would make Oscar Grant out to be someone he wasn't but the filmmakers were careful to show he was a complex person. Altho it focused mostly on Oscar, it included Oakland as part of what made him. The filmmakers showed as full a reality as you probably can in a film - they certainly worked not to take sides. It seemed far more object than other pieces I've seen or read. We follow Grant through his last days, with an eye on who he is, who he wants to be and how he is trying to get there.

The fact that Fruitvale Station shows Oscar completely instead of sanitizing him broadens his humanity. By the end it's impossible not to see he was a person in a situation that breaks people. That life is on display as much as the shooting. You see the absence he leaves and the way the cycle just churns on. Like the real event, Fruitvale Station ends with a void that can't be fixed or filled.",1394150400,,989,4.205263157894737

5883839,2,B00E1LQRWY,"Another young black man unfortunately dead.  History repeats itself, however, many of movies that are ""based on a true story"" as this is have a tendency to manipulate the actual events for many different reasons - to gain support for the person ""wronged""; to push a political agenda; to change public opinion; to make the story more interesting; to gain attention for those involved in its production; to get greater distribution; make more money; and I'm sure many other reasons I haven't considered.  It appears to me that at least some of these agenda's are in play in the movie called ""Fruitvale Station"".

This movie portrays Oscar Grant as a young man of 22 trying to find his way.  We think the movie is accurate because it reveals his character flaws.  He was victimized by an unjust system repeatedly and the present state of the inner city plight is again repeated.  The problem is that critical facts are missing that translate into a clear misrepresentation of that fateful day.

The movie starts early morning, December 31, 2008.  His girlfriend and baby mama comments about her recent discovery of his infidelity, he assures her of his commitment to her.  Initially, she is portrayed as ambivalent about his drug dealing.  After she leaves for work, he visits a supermarket and asks for his job back (we were led to believe he was working) but the manager refuses, Oscar's temper gets the best of him and he threatens his former boss repeatedly.  Moments earlier, he initiates a conversation with an attractive woman in the store and hits on her, this is just a few short hours after promising his girlfriend that he only wants her ""forever"".  Later we see him making a call to a client to set a meeting.  While waiting at the ocean for the client, he throws away a substantial bag ~32 oz. of what appears to be pot into the water, as he reflects on his prison stay (he had been out of jail for four months).  Yet, when his client shows, he sells him something else. Throughout the day, he talks to various family members, lying to them directly about having the day off (no one knows he was terminated).  Later, he admits to his girlfriend that he has been unemployed and the rent is due, she forgives him and reminds him of his drugs as a resource.  She becomes angry at him for throwing away the pot.

Shortly after threatening his former boss with physical harm, he cries over a dog, who after getting hit by a car quickly dies.  He shouts at the driver who speeds away.  In essence, he is a poor black man, a victim with little economic opportunity struggling to survive and so we are to forgive him his flaws.  We see flashbacks of his stint in prison during his pot disposal and we are to believe Oscar is maturing and has every intention to become a good citizen (but moments later he completes a drug deal!?).

The fact is that the writer admits to making up the dog scene (see Forbes article) as well as the scene where Oscar tosses the dope.  In fact, Oscar was a known drug dealer in the area (which is slightly alluded to, you aren't sure).  Of course, his flaws don't justify the fact that he was murdered in cold blood, a victim of stereotyping.

However, when he and his friends are riding the BART subway train (San Francisco's mass transit) returning from seeing the New Year's Eve fireworks, he along some of these friends get involved in an altercation (all have been drinking -we suspect some may be doing drugs as well), the BART (train) officers are called, he and two others are told to sit while the cops collect the other fight participants.  The three become quite vocal and are argumentative and attempt to leave.  Meanwhile, multiple riders are shouting at the police and general chaos ensues.  A gun is fired and you realize he has been shot by an officer.  He is rushed to the hospital for extremely serious injuries, he dies hours later.  The movie closes.

We, the audience are informed that the officer stated he had intended to taser him but grabbed his gun by accident -implying that it wasn't an accident particularly at the close, instead it was racially motivated homicide.  The officer was charged by the jury for 1st degree manslaughter.  Your initial reaction is horror at this injustice with great compassion and anger for his family and friends' loss.

Here are some critical facts that challenge the ""truthfulness"" in the presentation of the events.  These include the following omissions:  multiple videos were taken during the incident, Grant refused to comply with being handcuffed and attempted to get way, when Pirone instructed Officer Mehserle to arrest Grant (among the phone videos, we see the four other men were compliant and two were hand-cuffed); it appears that Grant attempted to get Officer Pirone's gun when Pirone made an attempt to handcuff him, at which point, Pirone assaulted him; the autopsy showed his blood alcohol level was (0.02%) and there was Fentanyl, a potent pain reliever also in his system (so much for turning away from his life of crime); Other officer's reported that the group was aggressive and threatening; BART dismissed Pirone and his partner, Marysol Domenici, BART stated Domenici had given ""false statements"" which was proved a lie and she was reinstated including back pay; a witness, Carlos Reyes gave witness testimony at trial stating that Officer Mehserle said, ""Oh s***, I shot him"" after shooting Grant; moments earlier, Mehserle had been on a call dealing with a hoodlum, who was armed and resisted arrest by running away (this was mentioned at the trial, to give insight into his the state of mind, prior to dealing with Grant and the others).

If this were true story then these facts as they relate to the event should have been presented as well - I guess that is why it wasn't presented in a documentary format and only based on a true story.  It reminds me of the pre-school game where someone whispers a sentence which gets passed along a chain.  Fifteen people later, the sentence is wildly different.

After the jury verdict that were multiple protests, some of which were violent, and crimes of aggression which included arson, vandalism and theft.  The jury didn't believe he was intentionally shot in cold blood.  Unfortunately, Oscar was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He shouldn't have been involved in a fight at 2AM on a subway under the influence of substantial alcohol and pain killers.

After watching footage from multiple videos taken during this time, it would appear that Officer Pirone was aggressive but it is obvious that out of the five men in the group, Grant was the only one, resisting the officers, his body language is clear.  It is unfortunate that there was no audio.  One can understand that the officer's would be concerned when anyone resists arrest (regardless of complexion) and that the elevated adrenaline makes one highly responsive because Oscar was actively resisting them.  We don't know Oscar's state of mind given amount and combined effect of the drug and alcohol in his system but his behavior is combative.  Officer Mehserle looks stunned as realization that he shot his weapon becomes evident -if he had shot intentionally as multiple blogs suggest, would that have been his expression?

Meanwhile, Pirone was fired from his job but it doesn't appear that he is restricted from being a police officer, he is not mentioned in the end summary.  I am concerned he was not stripped of his law enforcement credentials.

I'm not denying that racism exists especially among police officers.  Sadly, it is prevalent in the large metropolitan area in which I reside.  I have black friends that won't drive in certain communities because DWB (Driving While Black). I have heard police in my town say racist things, this appalls me.

Additionally, I can think of multiple incidents where area police have gone to the wrong house and shot a supposed drug dealer.  Why aren't films or documentaries made about these common, Joe the plumber types mistakenly being killed?  Is it because most of those victims are Caucasian or Hispanic?

It is unfortunate that perhaps multiple misunderstandings occurred leading to the death of Oscar Grant.  A family is without their brother, parent's are without their son, a child is without her father, a woman is without her man but to paint him as a saint, whose halo was a bit tilted is a big stretch!  Particularly, when the movie turns this into a race issue.  There is no question that police profile people and that black men are especially targeted for unfair treatment in the justice system ( a great documentary on this issue has been done, ""The House I Live In"", its focus is about the unfair treatment of crack users (popular among the poor, particularly black community) compared to cocaine users (wealthy, typically Caucasian crowd))-please see my review.  It is unfortunate that the writer and producers made the choice of picking Oscar Grant as the poster ""child"" for racist police brutality.  Moreover, by choosing to portray Oscar in this light is almost excusing his drug dealing activities, stereotyping him as having no other options.  This is an injustice to black people, who choose to do honest work.  Being poor is not justification to turning to crime, while some choose to commit crime, others choose to work even if it isn't a career or a good use of their talents.  There are people of all races that face poverty.

That aside, I thought the acting was fair and the writing poor.  Octavia Spencer is a great actress and even she didn't come across as believable in the last scene.

5883862,5,B00E1LQRWY,"2009 was only a few minutes old when a 22-year-old African American by the name of Oscar Grant was fatally gunned down by a white police officer in a BART station in Oakland, California (he died in the hospital the next morning). Oscar was unarmed and lying flat on the ground when the officer shot him before a crowd of horrified onlookers, an event caught on cell phone and video cameras by a number of the witnesses. Almost immediately, the videos went viral, prompting national outrage, mass protests in the Bay Area and a trial for murder (the officer was convicted of manslaughter and served less than a year of his two-year sentence). ""Fruitvale Station"" chronicles Oscar's final 24 hours of life as he and his friends and family prepare to celebrate the coming new year.

How ""Fruitvale Station"" failed to garner an Oscar nomination for Best Picture - let alone Michael B. Jordan for Best Actor - is a complete mystery to me. The movie marks an extraordinary debut for writer/director Ryan Coogler and features a career-making, off-the- charts performance by Jordan, who has impressed us in a variety of TV roles (""The Wire,"" ""Friday Night Lights,"" ""Parenthood""), but who here really comes into his own as a leading man.

As scenarist, Coogler avoids the obvious temptation of casting his subject in a heroic light. Oscar has clearly had his share of run-ins with the law, but he is just as clearly in the process of trying to get his act together, be it as a loving son and boyfriend (despite the occasional carousing) and doting father to a little girl. What Coogler recognizes - and so many even more seasoned movie makers don't - is that actual human beings are rarely either villains or saints, but are instead a complex mixture of weaknesses and strengths. The tragedy of Oscar's case is that, for all his faults, he seemed to be growing into full manhood when he met a senseless fate, partly the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time but wholly the result of another man acting badly. Because we already know where the narrative is headed, we are alert to the many ironies that are being brought into play as the story heads to its pre-ordained conclusion. This feeling of omniscience also heightens the poignancy of the story as we watch an ordinary man going through the motions of an ordinary day not knowing that it is to be his last.

Coogler's direction is so naturalistic in tone and style that we could swear we are watching real life unfolding before our very eyes. This is particularly the case in the final stretches of the film in which he recreates the fateful event with a you-are-there immediacy that is positively breathtaking. The measure of a true artist, Coogler never pushes his points, allowing even the highly volatile racial and police brutality aspects of the incident to speak for themselves.

It would be impossible to overrate Jordan's beautifully modulated and understated performance, but that should not keep us from acknowledging the stellar work of Octavia Spencer as his mother, Melonie Diaz as his girlfriend, Ariana Neal as his daughter and Chad Michael Murray (""One Tree Hill"") as Officer Ingram.

Given the newsworthy circumstances of his death, Oscar Grant could easily have become either just another statistic or a larger-than-life figurehead in a movement for social justice. ""Fruitvale Station"" rescues him from that fate by showing us that the man we lost really was a man, with all the contradictory and glorious messiness that that entails. His story also drives home in a vivid way the very fragility of life itself, the sense that we are all just living on borrowed time, and that, because we never know when the end will come for us, we need to make the most of the time we are given here. Oscar Grant was trying to do just that when he met his senseless end at the barrel of a gun. ""Fruitvale Station"" is a moving tribute to his legacy.",1393545600,,3915,4.734604105571847

5883880,4,B00E1LQRWY,"Fruitvale Station is a film that is based upon the true story of Oscar Grant III and his death at the hands of a BART Police Officer.  Oscar Grant (Michael B. Jordan) is a young man who's trying to get his life together.  He has a daughter named Tatiana (Ariana Neal) and loving girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz).  Grant has a troubled past but he's trying to make the right decisions and make a better life for his family.  It's New Year's Eve and after they celebrate his mother's (Octavia Spencer) birthday, Grant and Sophina are going to head to the city to watch the New Year's fireworks.  On the train ride home, Grant's street life catches up with him and after a spat with a local rival causes a fight.  The BART police break it up and sets off a chain reaction that brings this young man's life to an end.

I really enjoyed the movie.  A very brilliant debut picture for director Ryan Cooglar.  Kudos also go to Michael B. Jordan who portrayed Oscar Grant.  His acting gave the role a realistic aura to it that showed what a complex person Grant was a I feel that a very few people could have pulled it off.  I really enjoyed the direction of the film, especially the last act of the film.  It was pretty intense and heart wrenching.  I hope to see more films from Cooglar in the future and more of Michael B. Jordan.

5883912,4,B00E1LQRWY,"Fruitvale is a neighborhood in Oakland, California. San Francisco/Bay area's Bay Area Rapid Transit system, or BART, has a station in this neighborhood; hence, Fruitvale Station, where the film's pivotal scene takes place. The film tells the true story of Oscar Grant III (Michael B. Jordan), a 22-year-old man with a troubled past, who is trying to turn his life around to be a better partner to his girlfriend, Sophina, Dad to their little girl, Tatiana, and son to the mother he loves so much. In a flashback to his last prison stint, his mother (The Help's Octavia Spencer) has told him that she will no longer be there for him if he can't get his life straightened out and be there for his daughter. While he loves his family deeply and wants to change, he is caught between the ""straight"" life that seems just out of reach and his former criminal one. Oscar pretends that everything is going great, but that couldn't be further from the truth.

While I found this film touching and the end deeply affecting, I can't in all honesty say it's the best movie ever or even the best movie I've seen so far this year. I took issue with a few of the things depicted. That said, it does have an important story to tell and, on that level, I would definitely recommend it.

Note that this movie is rated R. There are a few sexual situations, though I did not find them at all graphic, LOTS of profanity (especially when Oscar and his buddies are hanging out) and a violent ending (this is not a spoiler as the film's description on the product page gives away the ending).

This film has quite the pedigree: It won the Grand Jury prize AND the Audience Award at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, and Movie of the Year at the 2014 AFI Awards. It was produced by Forest Whitaker's Significant Productions and, according to the end credits, Octavia Spencer was also a co-producer.

They were subsequently arrested by BART security and after security had cuffed Oscar one of the officers shot him in the back and killed him...the stuff of which nightmares are made.

The acting was superb with Michael B. Jordan portraying Oscar as he tried to turn away from his troubled past and begin a new life with his girlfriend Sophia played by Melonie Diaz and his daughter Tatiana played by the adorable Ariana Neal.  Most outstanding was Octavia Spencer who always puts in an exemplary performance.  One of my all time favorite actors, Forest Whitaker, was a co-producer.  This isn't a feel good movie.  It's gritty and it will rip your heart out.  It's an important story however and it was done with respect.

Don't miss the bonus features especially the Q & A session with Director Ryan Coogler and the producers and actors.  They speak with passion and knowledge about how they approached this film and why they decided to be part of it.  Excellent stuff.",1393027200,,1199,4.688995215311005

5883928,4,B00E1LQRWY,"I liked that the character was presented with weaknesses and strengths which made him very believable. It was fascinating watching a young person grow up: you can see the outline of the man he would've become as he learns from his mistakes, the way he lovingly engages in parenting his little girl, and his relationships with his lady and his family. Outstanding acting by Michael Jordon, and the cast. Outstanding writing; the writer hit it out the park by largely presenting the story as if it wasn't Oscar's last day, so we get to experience his life with him. Also the writer gave us enough information about Oscar to make him interesting, as well as surrounding him with believable characters (as when the Caucasian young woman he initiates a conversation with in the market initially leans away from his attempt to engage her. Just that accurate behavior shows how African Americans have to work just that extra bit harder to be seen as normal citizens). I predict this writer/director, if he keeps being spot on with human behavior as he demonstrates here, will be winning Oscars. In my opinion, the sign of a really good writer is how she/he writes supporting characters; to me the characters surrounding the lead are as important as the lead, in terms of providing valuable information for the audience. Because this is a believable character study, the film ends up being a celebration of too brief a life.  Well done. 4 and a half stars. A half star removed for use of the N word. Hopefully, one day soon, directors making films featuring African American characters won't feel the need to insert racial slurs into their dialogue. Film would've worked just as well and been just as believable without the slurs. And if they need to find encouragement: there are many jewish film makers but most don't have jewish characters referred to with racial slurs in their films. Just not that hard to do guys. You think what, audiences are going to walk out of films thinking to themselves ""if only one of the black characters had referred to another of the african american characters as N, then the film would've seemed so much more authentic."" We don't need to keep showing little kids coming up that using that word is acceptable to african americans, when it is not.",1392940800,,2273,4.769035532994923

5883944,4,B00E1LQRWY,"This is an engaging and thought-provoking independent film that deserves all the accolades it has received.  It's the story of Oscar Grant, a young black man from the Bay Area who was shot and killed by BART Police while lying on his stomach and handcuffed on the floor of Fruitvale Station. What is most effective about the film is how it takes us through the last day of Oscar's life from his point of view, on New Year's Eve 2008, as he interacts with his girlfriend (Melonie Diaz), dotes on his young daughter and takes her to preschool, and prepares for his mother's (Octavia Spencer) birthday party. Oscar isn't perfect - we learn in flashback that he's done time, but he's trying to get his life back together. He can be sociable and charming, but he also has a volatile temper, which is a factor later on.  The director depicts the unfolding of events of that New Year's Eve and early New Year's Day with an effective sense of foreboding.  According to the film, Oscar is provoked into a brief fight by a former white inmate who recognizes him on the train. At the next station the transit police, thinking he and his friends are the instigators, haul them off the train and detain them at taser-point and gunpoint.  In the escalating tension and chaos that follows, Grant is handcuffed and then shot in the back.  The film seems deliberately unclear about whether the shooting was intentional or accidental, but regardless, Oscar Grant did not deserve to die that way. The incident sparked outrage after cellphone videos from fellow passengers documented the incident. As for the performances, Michael B. Jordan is excellent as Grant, Octavia Spencer is wonderful as usual, and the supporting cast is strong. It's not the most uplifting film, but it certainly deserves to be seen.",1392768000,,1789,4.776699029126213

This slice of life movie deals with the main character's last day, which happens to be New Year's Eve. We get to know his family and friends and all the important players in one man's life.

This is a sad commentary on our society. Other's have already described the plot so I will spare you the retelling. This is a thinkiing person's movie.

5883986,5,B00E1LQRWY,"""Fruitvale Station"" is one of my favorite movies of 2013.  Having won both the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, I was very excited to see it - and it was every bit as dramatic as I hoped it would be.  The film takes the point-of-view of Oscar Grant, a young man who was killed during an early-morning altercation with the police after celebrating the New Year.  The film is presented as a slice-of-life and depicts Oscar's final day - we see Oscar spend time with his family and friends, and we can also see some of his struggles and his aspirations to improve himself.  Throughout the entire movie you feel a dramatic weight that continues to build, until finally we reach the tragic conclusion to the day's events.

The filmmaker, Ryan Coogler, is a first-time director... I am very much looking forward to his future projects.  He does an excellent job with the material, working with actor Michael B. Jordan to create a main character who has true complexity.  At times, you can see the limitations of the budget - there is a lot of handheld camera work, and the image looks as if it was captured on 16mm film.  But Coogler turns the limitations of the production into an asset; every stylistic and technical choice he makes feels appropriate and adds to the realism to the movie.",1392595200,,1304,4.5905172413793105

5883989,5,B00E1LQRWY,"Ryan Coogler demonstrates the  the kind of film  that can be created with a vision. His deft script elevates what could have been a heavily politicized ""Blacksplotion"" film into a work of art focused on the everyman that Oscar Grant (Michael B Jordan) was in life, rather than his tragic death at the hand of a BART policeman, and its aftermath.

That's not to say the incident of his death is ignored, but rather it takes a backseat to his life, his relationships with his daughter((Ariana Neal), girlfriend( Melonie Diaz), mother(Octavia Spencer) and his extended family and friends..

Michael B Jordan primarily known for character work rises to the leading male role with aplomb. Octavia Spencer is up to her usual standards  . Ariana Neal is quite gifted and someone to watch.

Although the subject matter , based on a true story, is sad, the film is entertaining , engrossing and worth seeing by all.

I made a point of making my 16 year old African American son watch this movie.  Young black men are being killed by white men and the white men are getting away with it.

5884036,4,B00E1LQRWY,"First a note: Amazon has a policy of combining all reviews of ALL formats of a film (in theaters, Amazon Instant, David and Bluray).  So, as I post this, there are already 147 reviews posted, even though David and BD were not released until this week. My suggestion is always to sort reviews by Newist First and also look at the format that the reviewer is discussing. Because the Amazon Instant versions do not include any bonus features, I will spend most of my time on those. This is a review of the David version.

Fruitvale Station, an audience winner at both the Sundance Festival and at Cannes, is the kind of independent film that the Weinstein Company specializes in: Films that would not get the notoriety they deserve without promotion. Nearly every release that Ive seen from Bob and Harvey Weinsteins company has been special, and this one is no different.

The 85-minute film is based on the true story of Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old San Francisco Bay area black man ( living with his girlfriend and their four year-old daughter), who was gunned down by a transit police officer on New Years Eve in 2009 at the Fruitvale subway transit station. It was definitely a case of racial profiling. What makes the film difficult (emotionally) to watch is that the film starts with the murder and then, immediately, flashes back 24 hours to show us what Grant was going through in his daily life. You know the end is coming (this is not a spoiler alert because you know up front what will happen) and seeing Grant deal with a job loss and  more importantly  watching the bond he has with his mother (the Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer  The Help) and his daughter (an amazing performance by the young Ariana Neal!) and knowing it will soon end. There are two scenes featuring Neal that will pull a tear from your eye. The first is the kiss she gives Grant as he leaves her at pre-school one day. The other is the final shot in the film, with Neal in the shower.

Actress Spencer is listed as a Producer in the credits, but the big name that got this film made was Forest Whitaker. And, of course, the Weinsteins who got it distributed.

The David includes two bonus features that, when taken together, run nearly as long as the film. First there is  Fruitvale Station: The Story of Oscar Grant, a 21-minute featurette that features the cast and the production team (including Whitaker) and discusses, not only the film but interviews journalist on the subject of racial profiling.  Though a few scenes from the film are included, they are included sparingly. I found this bonus very helpful in understanding more about Grant and the film. The other bonus is a 27-minute Q&A with Cast and Filmmakers recorded in Oakland in July 2013. It was interesting to watch but I felt that much of it repeated comments already covered in the other bonus.

I appreciated knowing the story of Grant  which made more headlines in the West Coast than a similar event with Trayvon Martin in Florida  and Im glad I saw it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Oscar winning actress Octavia Spencer plays Grant's mom and the emotions she showed draws you into the character so much you forget she's acting. Fruitvale Station was one of the most emotional movies I have seen and I cried for the last ten minutes of the movie.

(And I'm sure I wouldn't know enough about the incident thru mass media anyways) I did enjoy it as a movie. There was some swearing, arguing, and physical fighting but nothing an older child couldn't see.  It was well done.  I think it actually helped to know how it would end bc I could focus on the movie instead of worrying about the ending.  A few messages I took from this movie:

1.  S*** happens. That's life.  We should not lay blame in instances we know nothing about firsthand.
2.  Listen to police/authority if what they want is not harmful to anyone.  It's that simple. Yes I know many are corrupt, etc. but why egg them on unnecessarily??
3. Appreciate what you have cuz you never know when it (or you) could be gone..

5884101,4,B00E1LQRWY,"I am a Criminology professor and was interested in this film for a number of reasons.  First, it provides an excellent way to communicate to students how race can inform law enforcement practices.  This film is based on a well-known fatal case and there have been many others since this one across the country to illustrate how this can happen in other places.  Second, the film provides a more realistic approach to the daily life and struggles of inner city racial minority youth rather than a glorified culture of violence wrapped around gangs and stereotypical gang culture.  Third, the film can be used as a starting point for provocative discussion on how certain racial and ethnic minority group members are susceptible to different types of law enforcement compared to white suburban community members.  If you're at all interested in a more realistic (carefully noting it is 'based' on a true story and not a documentary) portrayal of the policing of racial and ethnic minority youth, do yourself a favor and watch it.",1391731200,2,1027,4.9476744186046515

5884125,2,B00E1LQRWY,I was skeptical about ordering this movie based on the trailer.  My thoughts were right this did not deserve to be a movie.  There was not enough action or substance.  You can watch the last 15 minutes and have seen the whole movie.  Unfortunately situation for Oscar and his family and justice was not served.  I feel your pain for the senseless lost.

5884128,5,B00E1LQRWY,"What if the last words you said to a loved one who was murdered were angry ones?  Or perhaps equally bad, what if they were meant as helpful advice, which as a result, may have contributed to the death?  That's the plight that Oscar Grant's mother finds herself in when she suggests that her son and his friends take the train on New Year's Eve when they go out for a night on the town, rather than drive.  As a result, the twentysomething Oscar, an African American man who is trying to put his life back together after being released from jail, is brutally beaten by the police in a train station altercation and dies as a result.  ""Fruitvale Station,"" starring Michael B. Jordan as Oscar, focuses on his day and the events leading up to that fateful hour.  We see him drop his young daughter off at day care, assist a young woman at the fish counter who is planning a dinner for her friend, witness the death of a stray dog, and try to get his job back (the loss of which he has kept from his nearest and dearest).  We see how his past mistakes affect his relationship with his mother and girlfriend.  Though his family relations are sometimes strained, it is clear through witnessing the birthday party preceding the tragedy, that there is clearly love and warmth there, too, making what ultimately happens even more brutal.

Also starring Octavia Spencer and Melonie Diaz, ""Fruitvale Station,"" is based on a real life killing.  I've read several articles that believe it should have received at least one Oscar nomination, and I have to agree (surely, there's room for more than one African American centered movie in the lineup?).  However, it's worth seeing anyway.",1391385600,8,1672,4.63728813559322

1. A young black man has a girlfriend and child.
2. He has been in the hoosegow before.
3. We see that he is fundamentally a decent person.
4. One day he takes a train with some friends (during the New Year) at his mother's behest.
5. He is killed by transit officer.

This is a good film, and it has the feeling of a documentary. There is no music during the film and the acting is not excessively polished, nor the piece overly dramatized.

The writers try to be very even handed in getting at the facts of the case.

Verdict: It's' worth the time and worth the price.",1391299200,,601,4.245614035087719

In this case, the fellow was killed by a over-reacting, stressed to the max cop.  Both Bart and Oakland, should give their police officers periodic mental evaluations to make sure they are fit for duty, not murder.

The story was good, it shows both sides of the victims personality.  Maybe it glossed over a little, but I don't think the writer over did it.  The story painted a picture of a unemployed ex-con with no glimmer of finding the job he needs to take care of those who depend upon him, he was trying to turn his life around. Whether he was or not really has no bearing on the way he was killed and who he was killed by.  A son, a father was taken away from the family who loved him.",1391040000,,823,4.264516129032258

This film focuses on the life of Oscar Grant (which is fine), but I would have liked it to be 30 minutes longer and had some of the legal proceedings included to put more prospective to the story.

Only mean felons are put in San Quentin, like Manson, etc.  I guess I should be glad they even put the scene in San Quentin in the movie at all.",1390435200,5,563,4.072727272727272

Bit of a temper who doesn't know someone like that.  The fact he was black was his only crime ,view through police or other's eyes.

How a stupid, clumsy, ignorant, or mentally unstable police officer can be incredibly dangerous because they run around with loaded weapons.  I personally don't believe (spoiler) that the office could have mistaken a Glock for a Tazer.  Tazers are half the weight and yellow. Such a wast of a life.  11 months is not long enough.

Found myself feeling drained/weak watching  the young actor bleeding from his mouth then subsequently dying at the hospital.  I even ventured out to watch the actual Fruitvale footage taken by cell phones.  That was almost unbearable, I had to keep looking away.  I then watched some footage of Oscars actual funeral.........no matter how good or bad someone is in this life, it is always sad to see someone die, and then be eulogized. Saying ""goodbye"" under normal circumstances is hard enough ; but for young people to  die and be eulogized............... well............it just saps the life out of you.",1390435200,,791,5.030769230769231
5884228,3,B00E1LQRWY,"This movie is about Oscar Grant as a person and not so much the actual event that took his life. I take BART and ride through Fruitvale Station all the time, so this movie had an extra touch of reality added to my perspective. It really drew me in. Sometimes I will look out of the window at Hayward or Oakland and think to myself, ""I'm glad I was lucky enough to not be born there and that I didn't have to grow up living there."" Unfortunately for Grant, he wasn't that lucky. I think this is one of the points the filmmakers were making; that Oscar Grant wasn't perfect, but would anybody be if they grew up in a place where you hear sirens and gunshots every night? One could say that this high stress level makes the police crazy, as well. Even the BART police.

Having said that, there were scenes that drew me out because they could never have happened. The party scene within the train on New Year's could never have happened the way it was portrayed because they are shown smoking, drinking, and playing loud music, all of which will get you immediately kicked off. The BART drivers are very intense with enforcing their rules, too, and will actually tell you to get off the train or knock things off over the intercom before departing. In fact, even drinking coffee on BART was made illegal back in 2005 or so (which was very controversial). In the movie, this scene happens with no response from the driver, then they get off the train, and then get on another train where the famous incident begins to take place.

As far as the movie is concerned, I found it very very slow. They don't even get on BART until 50 minutes into the movie. The filmmakers obviously dedicated the movie to Oscar Grant's personality and everyday life, rather than the actual event. They wanted to portray how they viewed him. But kudos to them for making the statement that Grant was not perfect.  The movie was not perfect, either, but still far more honest than most of Hollywood.",1390348800,2,1971,4.469444444444444
5884229,5,B00E1LQRWY,"Michael B. Jordan did an outstanding job of portraying Oscar Grant's last day, while the writer of this film crafted a realistic glimpse into the life of young men like Oscar who are faced with the challenges of young men in America on the urban landscape. The bonds he shared with his family & friends mirrored he stress and strife that can or could erupt at any moment.  The emotional tyranny at the end of the film left the viewer shocked, awestruck and furious with the injustice and impatience of law enforcement; meanwhile, the real culprit escapes into the shadows. It would be nice to know whatever happened to that instigator as I am sure the train's activities were recorded and there were a train full of witness who should have been able to identify him.  However, the writer and director did a excellent job of shedding light on the life of Oscar Grant and day that has changed those affected forever. The climax was so potent that it broke me down like not no other film has before. All I could do was say, ""he didn't do ANYTHING"". It was a stellar award worthy performance. To those who utilized their resources and creativity to make this film I want to thank you and say that it was not in vein. It really makes me feel proud of the named Oscar Grant III what he was striving to be.  An excellent film that leaves you hunger for justice and curious to know more about those who touched his life: his fiance, his daughter, his boys, his mother, grandmother, as well as, the two acquaintances: female customer who ultimately drew attention to his presence on the train, the gentlemen & his wife of 8 years.

The part where the dog hit by a car and died was really not necessary. Do yourself a favor and watch the first 10-15 min so you know who the players are and then fast forward to the last 30-45 minutes. Acting was good. This story gave me another reason to not like cops.

5884277,5,B00E1LQRWY,"This Martin Luther King weekend, I finally had the opportunity to watch the film ""Fruitvale Station"".  I would like to believe, in my heart of hearts, that we as a nation have made great strides with regard to civil rights and racial equality since Dr. King had a dream, but this film served as a solemn reminder that we as a people have a long way yet to go, light years, really, in our trajectory towards fulfilling that dream.  The changing of laws is relatively simple compared to the changing of hearts and minds.  Oscar Grant was not a hero or a saint; he was just a human being like all of us, flawed and virtuous, a man trying to put his life back together who happened to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time...and who happened to be the ""wrong"" color.  The film was objective and straightforward in its depiction of the last day of Mr. Grant's life, and the extensive use of handheld cameras added to the sense of being there, being in the moment as events transpired.  Ryan Coogler is a gifted director--this was an astonishing film in its own right, let alone as a first effort--it reminded me of the style of Paul Greengrass, whose ""United 93"" and ""Bloody Sunday"" gave the viewer an intimate sense of chaotic reality.  The film is powerful and heartbreaking, and its depiction of Mr. Grant's senseless murder by the police is nonetheless shocking, even when we already know what is going to happen.  The officer who fired the bullet through Mr. Grant's chest that ended his life as he lay face-down on the cold, tiled floor, handcuffed, as another officer held him down with a knee on his head, insisted that he thought he had pulled his taser and not his service revolver, and confused the two in the ""heat of the moment""--yet a cellphone photo taken only moments before by Mr. Grant himself reveals that same officer with his hand on his taser, indicating that he knew full well where his taser was on his gun belt and was familiar with it.

On the day that we celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King, I believe it is profoundly important that we derive from the stories of people like Oscar Grant, and Trayvon Martin, and Amadou Diallo, and many others in this country who have paid a horrible price--including Dr. King himself--that the malignant force that is racism is by no means extinct in this country, and that we as a nation still have a long way to go in the struggle to truly fulfill his dream of equality.  We all need to climb to the mountaintop.  We need to realize as human beings that what threatens the equality of people anywhere, threatens us everywhere.",1390176000,,2603,4.53091684434968

5884280,3,B00E1LQRWY,"Following Oscar Grant through his day on New Years eve was a bit challenging.  It drags and drags with his personal problems and dysfunctional situation with a girlfriend and their baby daughter.  Oscar Grant was not exactly a law abiding citizen as we see during the movie when he's attempting to sell a large bag of pot and then a rewind while he was in prison for another crime that was committed. To which the movie never mentions what crime he was convicted of.  Possibly drug distribution and posession.  In this scene we see a rather detached verbal brawl between himself and a white convict that appears to of Arion Nation type.  The language is pure to the culture of prison.

Their is no denying that Oscar Grant was shot by a transit officer that was ignorant or just plain stupid.  As a firearms enthusiast I can tell you, blind folded, what I'm unholstering and there is a huge difference between a taser and Sig P226 .40 Smith chambered pistol.  It's tragic, and it does make the audience a bit angry that transit cops carry firearms that they do not know how to shoot properly or this would have never happened, regardless of excuses such as ""adrenaline rush"" ""Fear induced panic"" etc.  I don't think we really know who Oscar was, as a person.  But, the movie wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and show some scenes and narratives of his longing to be in a better position for not only himself but his girlfriend and their daughter.  I wish his daughter well in her future life.",1390176000,,1502,4.525925925925926

I had no idea it would get so intense that I would look unblinkingly at the screen. The characters are real and likeable and where this film truly stands out is in the fact that it is not try to widen the RACE DISTINCTION.

5884308,3,B00E1LQRWY,"""A favourite at the Sundance Film Festival at 2013 (along with Don Jon's Addiction), Fruitvale Station (or known as Fruitvale, in some corners and festival patrons) is a rather simple, realistically performed, shocking, and depressing debut feature film from a 27 year old director named Ryan Coogler who graduated from USC. That component alone of it being a feature debut from a well-known university alumnus and the realistic presence of the film's portrayal before-and-after the controversial BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) shooting in 2007 to ex-convict Oscar Grant.

Coogler manages to create a film that speaks a lot to its audience without becoming too preachy and racially charged in the way that Spike Lee or John Singleton would do it but provide a sort-of guerilla, student-film feel to the film that given its encircled popularity at the box office (managed to make around more than $10 million and to be screened in 1,000-so cinemas in America and Canada), Forest Whitaker's producing credentials, and the strong reviews at 93% Rotten Tomatoes or higher, it shows that this was more intriguing than I could call for. Also, the film's discussion about police brutality and force (while not lingering onto the explicit racial overtones) in correspondence to the Trayvon Martin v. George Zimmerman trial that occurred in Florida at the time. While that is a very politicised and controversial move on part of the Weinstein brothers' and Coogler's campaign to heighten awareness of the film, it is still nonetheless relevant enough to understand that some people do not always a perception of reality and the politics or beliefs on something (in this case, the blacks were the perceived suspects of the crime on the train).

While the film's politics is not delved that much, it is more of an emotional, single day exploration about a man trying to do good for his family and turn his life around after spending time behind bars (it is not clear what he was arrested for but drug dealing/use maybe possible). Michael B. Jordan as Oscar Grant is compelling and believable enough (potentially if worthy of Golden Globe attention but that is a competitive business, I will admit) and knowing that Coogler and the people helping on his film seeing the real Grant family only makes the film even more believable and startling.

The best scenes are surprisingly the ones where you do not actually anticipate something and it shows Grant trying to think about his life, text messaging with a clever use of CG to make the SMS graphics, and going to the supermarket Farmer Joe's to get his job back. One of the most troubling scenes for me was not only the incident but the discussions between him and his mother and wife trying to cope with him being out of the cells and sticking by knowing he did that, leave his daughter troubled but still joyous, and his mother and wife having to stick by his side. That troubles me because people who end up on the incarcerated side of life are usually unfit to have children, raise a family, or deal with regular people in society and the penal system once you get out is even more troubling to deal with regular life as they will not hire you.

Needless to say, it is tragic, it is tough but not too ballsy, it can be funny at times but it is far from comedy, and it is one of those films that Ang Lee, Martin Scorsese, or Charles Burnett (who directed Killer of Sheep when during his film school years, which these two films follow a similar aesthetic of being realistic and simply done) would be proud.""",1390003200,,3547,4.771986970684039

5884335,4,B00E1LQRWY,"Ryan Coogler is a new writer/director from Oakland, CA whose significant cinema debut centers around the city he understands so well. The film is thankfully a low budget film  - a factor that gives it a better sense of credibility. The cast of characters is well chosen and knowing that the film is based on reality makes it all the more blisteringly difficult to watch.

The story recreates (vividly, even though there is no actual written data about the lead-up to the infamous incident) the true story of Oscar (Michael B. Jordan), a 22-year-old Oakland resident who wakes up on the morning of December 31, 2008 with a sense of something ominous: he has cheated on his girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz) and is confronted with his behavior, he has been lying about having a job (he was fired for being frequently late to work in a grocery), he needs money but can only get that through dealing drugs (he has been imprisoned in San Quentin earlier and relives that in a brief flashback), and he wants to make his mother Wanda (Octavia Spencer) have a happy birthday. He decides he wants to be a better son to his mother, a better partner to his girlfriend he has emotionally abused by his infidelity, and being a better father to T (Ariana Neal), their beautiful 4 year old daughter. He starts out well, but as the day goes on, he realizes that change is not going to come easy. He crosses paths with friends, family, and strangers, each exchange showing us that there is much more to Oscar than meets the eye. But it would be his final encounter of the day, with police officers at the Fruitvale BART station that would shake the Bay Area to its very core, and cause the entire nation to be witnesses to the story of the murder of Oscar Grant by a policeman who later is given only 11 months for involuntary manslaughter.

The film is shot in verismo style that suits the story well. Most viewers will require subtitles as the accents of the cast mumble the dialogue that is appropriately filled with colloquialisms difficult to translate. This is a very disturbing film, highly original and one that deserves the honors bestowed upon it. Grady Harp, January 14",1389830400,2,2163,4.627604166666667

Regardless of how much is fact and how much is fiction, FRUITVALE STATION is one of those films that is so real that you forget you are even watching a film. Very few motion pictures achieve this level of immediacy, and the low budget indie lack of frills only adds to the quality, as does the absolutely fine acting by everyone involved. It succeeds in being compelling even though we already know how it will end up.

A couple of basic flaws: The run-over dog incident seems lifted directly from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Always-Outnumbered/dp/B00005RDAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Always Outnumbered</a>, based on Walter Mosley's excellent novel of the same name. There are also a few vague, patchy spots, and the story isn't as generally complete as it could be. Still, that's just part of the price paid in a film that concentrates on showing rather than telling, without being overly preachy or analytical.

Some have complained about the lack of action, commentary, or anything apparently meaningful in the first hour or so. Nevertheless, the way it frames its first parts as a day-in-the-life character study of recently paroled convict Oscar Grant who, despite having his share of problems and issues, is still an affectionate (though disloyal) husband, father, and decent human being, is crucial in showing the whole significance of this true event. It is necessary for us to know Grant, his life, family, and friends a little before we plunge right into the details of his illegal shooting by Oakland's Bay Area Rapid Transit System Police(a stupid accident, really, but caused by gross negligence and at least some amount of racial profiling). The early parts of the film also provide tension and very apt foreshadowing through the use of commonplace details (police sirens, etc).

Inevitably, there will be complaints that FRUITVALE STATION misrepresents this or that detail of the actual event in 2009. All I can say is that, based on what I have read--which is, admittedly, nothing beyond the raw basics--about the shooting, the makers of this film were faithful to the essential facts of the matter. I honestly do not know how the fight on the train really began, and it's possible that Oscar Grant was a bigger factor than is shown here. Nor do I know if the BART cops actually behaved this thuggishly from the get-go or how violently Grant and his friends resisted them. Regardless, the single most important fact is that one of the BART cops fatally shot the unarmed Grant in the back, stating afterward that he had mistaken his pistol for his Taser. Some idealization and oversimplification obviously took place in this film, but I can see how that was hard to avoid. It is virtually impossible to get every little fact straight in a docu-drama, and those that want to quibble are free to do so.",1389744000,2,2878,5.091101694915254

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

At a recent screening of `Fruitvale Station', I asked director Ryan Coogler if he believed the Involuntary Manslaughter conviction of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) officer who shot Oscar Grant, was justified.  Coogler was circumspect, stating that he was just trying to make a movie about what happened but he added that he could understand how Grant's family could have been very much upset with the verdict.  An African-American man in the audience commented that that the film did a great service in pointing out the ongoing problem of police brutality in America today; again Coogler was circumspect, acknowledging that his film has engendered a multiplicity of opinions as to the proper verdict for the officer who was charged with Grant's shooting.

From my point of viewpoint, despite Coogler's refusal to take sides in public, it's clear that he's seeking to manipulate his audience so that they feel outraged at Grant's shooting.  He accomplishes this by creating a fictional narrative of one last `day-in-the-life' of Grant's movements, before the fatal shooting. Perhaps Coogler was reacting to some of the unfortunate public disparagements of Grant after he was killed; but Coogler goes overboard in making him into a martyr.  By stacking a whole group of improbable incidents that emphasize what a `good guy' Grant was, into one day, the entire narrative feels manipulative and forced.

And what exactly are all these incidents that may or may not have actually occurred?  Perhaps the most bathetic of Coogler's manipulations is when he has Grant give the stray pit bull that had been killed by a hit and run driver, his last `rites' by the seashore (highly unlikely that this occurred as Grant is never seen telling anyone about it!).  There are more questionable incidents for example: Grant calling his mother for some `fish fry wisdom' for the untutored female shopper and patiently convincing a shop owner to allow the women he was with (along with another pregnant passerby) to use the bathroom.  If in fact this film ISN'T designed to provoke outrage over a perceived injustice, A.A. Dowd of the A.V. Club writes that its intended impact is significantly diminished: ""Fruitvale Station plays like an uncomplicated eulogy, with little more to say on its subject than ""what a shame this bad thing happened.""

While Coogler attempts to humanize his protagonist by showing him to have a serious anger management problem, Grant's anger (in Coogler's eyes) sometimes seems to be justified.  Take for example, Grant's blow-up in the flashback when he's a prisoner at San Quentin--it's the correction officers who are preventing Grant from talking to his mother.

I understand that what Coogler was trying to say about Grant was that at a certain point in his life he was not perfect and had some problems, but by the time he was killed, he had gotten his life together and moved past what was going on in the past.  That may be true but sometimes `karma' has a way of catching up with you.  Grant was actually put in prison for weapons possession (a fact that Coogler does not mention).  His confrontation on the train with the ex-con who tormented him in prison led to Grant being taken off the train by the police at Fruitvale Station.  Had he not been in prison in the first place, he most likely would never have had that confrontation on the train, and would never have been taken off the train, which led to his death.  So here was a guy who was going forward but could not escape his past. This tragic theme seems a lot more truthful than Coogler's agenda which was to highlight the injustice of the verdict.

Unfortunately, if one is looking for a case of classic police brutality, what happened at Fruitvale Station, does not fit the bill as the `poster child' for such incidents. The officer charged with the crime indicated that he mistakenly reached for his gun instead of his Taser.  If he was going to shoot someone intentionally, would it be in front of  witnesses who were filming the incident with their cell  phone cameras?  Clearly it was an accident.  But why does Coogler fail to mention that one of Grant's friends heard the officer say, ""I'm going to tase him.""  Because by doing so, that would be proof that the shooting was an accident and unintentional. In reality, this was a case of negligence, not brutality on the part of the police, despite Mr. Coogler's apparent stance to the contrary.

Despite all the mixed messages, Coogler still should be commended for his technical expertise.  Working with a team of fellow USC students, Coogler has managed to put together a nice-looking film.  He directs his actors well, particularly during the taut, climactic scene, where the tragic action unfolds.  The neophyte director has bit off more than he can chew, attempting to dissect a topic infused with racial animus.  Next time he would be much better served churning out a less controversial, commercial product.  Whatever the case, it's likely he has a good chance of going far in today's ever-challenging film industry.",1385251200,12,5128,4.906141367323291

5884390,4,B00E1LQRWY,This is the first time that I can remember where a character was made personal to the audience.  Oscar is human by no means perfect.  We all have our failings and fall short.  He is trying and such is life everything does not work out all the time.  I wish young people could see this movie not to make them angry but just to say sometimes stuff happens.  Sometimes you can do all the right things and get the wrong result.  Trouble will find you...you don't have to go looking for it.  This film is short but it makes you think.  I would have liked to know more about the shooter and what his life was like prior to the shooting.

5884391,4,B00E1LQRWY,"There is a narrative technique used a lot lately, primarily in television. The episode opens with a big showdown, guns drawn, or in the middle of a big, dramatic moment, the characters arguing with one another, and just as the moment reaches its climax, a title card pops up and we move backward in time: ""72 hours earlier"", ""5 Days Ago..."" The writers and director want to grab our attention and the true beginning of the story is static or less interesting, so they give us a preview of the climax to grab our attention.

I find it to be kind of a cop-out; the writers and director are creating the story, this universe. If it doesn't have a natural hook, fix it.

In ""Fruitvale Station"", first-time director Ryan Coogler's new film starring Michael P. Jordan as Oscar Grant III, the film begins in a similar fashion. Coogler shows us actual cell phone footage of the incident that happened on New Year's Eve at the BART Station. We watch the grainy footage, horrified to see the event happening to and because of real people. But I think Coogler's motives for showing us this footage are different; sure, he wants to grab our attention, but he also wants to give us proof that this event actually happened. Because it seems so incredulous that a young man could be killed. In such a way. As recently as four years ago.

There may be some people out there who still can't believe this type of thing can happen - some people still believe the Holocaust never happened. But this movie was also released the weekend before the George Zimmerman verdict was issued. When something like this happens, the events depicted in the film seem even more real, senseless and heartbreaking. And the hope that something like this could never happen shrinks even more.

After we watch the video footage, we join Oscar (Jordan) on the morning of New Year's Eve, 2008. He wakes up next to his girlfriend, Sophina (Melonie Diaz), feeling frisky. But before anything happens, their daughter, Thatiana (Ariana Neal) comes in and wants to sleep with them. When they wake up, we watch them get ready for the day, make preparations for Oscar's mom's (Octavia Spencer) birthday party that evening, make plans to go out and celebrate the New Year holiday later that evening. Soon, Sophina is at work and Oscar drives around trying to make some order, some sense of his life. He stops at Farmer Joe's and tries to talk his boss into giving him his job back. Oscar wants and needs to change his ways, to become the responsible adult his family needs. But old rivalries surface during his New Year's Eve celebration.

This is Ryan Coogler's first film and this is evident in both good and bad ways. Because he is new to this, there seems to be less emphasis on hitting plot points at studio-recognized intervals, allowing the story to flow in a more natural way. This gives us the opportunity to go along for the ride, literally, with Oscar as he meanders around, trying to create a new persona for himself. There are dramatic plot points throughout his story, but they seem less Hollywood, less forced than most and help give us a sense of this young man's life.

Because this is Coogler's first film, he doesn't have the experience to self-edit and falls victim to a few overly dramatic moments that serve to draw us out of the narrative. The most obnoxious is a moment when Oscar stops to get gas. As he is standing at the pump, a stray dog is hit by another car. Oscar runs to the dog's side and comforts him as he dies. Unfortunately, this scene really hammers home, in a none-too subtle fashion, what the rest of the film does so well. Most of the film paints a believable, subtle portrait of Oscar as a well-meaning young man, not without his problems, who is trying to put his life together, when he falls victim to a stupid, senseless shooting. Oscar's humanity is illustrated by his attempts to comfort the dog in his dying moments. And the dog's senseless death foreshadows Oscar's final moments at the Fruitvale BART Station. This moment isn't needed and its obvious message makes it stand out like a sore thumb.

Michael P. Jordan is an actor who will become a major star. He has appeared in a number of film and television projects, earning impressive critiques for his work. Until now, most of the great reviews have been for his work in television - ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Parenthood"" - but that is changing with this new film. This is the type of performance that can earn a relatively unknown actor an Oscar nomination and set him on a course to make some big-budget studio mistakes (Both Coogler and Jordan are close to signing on for ""Creed"", a ""Rocky"" re-boot being marshaled by Stallone when he isn't working on ""The Expendables III"") before they get their career on track and start earning critical notices again.

Riding around with Oscar all day gives us the opportunity to really become a part of his life, to see his decision-making process and to see how these decisions affect his life. As Oscar drives around, Jordan makes the character believable by just letting him be. Oscar stops by Farmer Joe's to accomplish a few things; he needs to get some crabs for his mom's birthday dinner and he needs his job back. He visits with a former co-worker, flirts with a female customer and then pleads with his former boss, trying to convince him he has changed, he will do better. Much of Oscar's life involves this sort of give and take, good and bad, nothing is a straight-forward moment.

Octavia Spencer plays Wanda, Oscar's mom. She has a few short scenes but the impact of her influence on her son's life is clear; he calls her while driving and she immediately admonishes him for using a cell phone in his car. This is a small, but believable moment; we can each hear our mom admonishing us for doing the same thing.

Melonie Diaz plays Sophina, Oscar's girlfriend and the mother of their child. Her performance is the equal of Jordan's in many ways. She is interacting with her boyfriend; someone she loves and cares for, but who also frustrates her. This young couple is, in many ways, both more and less mature than other people their age; they have been through some problems, helping them gain a certain maturity, but they are still young and prone to making mistakes. Watching these moments unfold in `real time' helps us to become a part of their lives.

Everything is the film is designed to lead us to the inevitable moment at the end of the film. Remember, we have already watched real found footage of Oscar's last moments on the BART platform in East Oakland. Watching the cell phone recording first thing has amped us up, made us anticipate the final moments even more. Because Coogler has already shown us the most important part of the film, our anticipation heightens the drama of the moment, making it more memorable and more powerful.

""Fruitvale Station"" is a very good, very raw, very powerful look at a distinct low point in our recent history. Unfortunately, we seem to continue to have these, letting history repeat itself again...

And again...

And again...

And again.",1381104000,7,7097,4.657348242811501
5884402,4,B00E1LQRWY,"Living in the Bay area one could not have avoided the story of Oscar Grant, and his totally unnecessary tragedy.

The story of him being shot by a BART police officer while face down on the ground at an Oakland BART station, on New Years day 2009 sparked a series of riots there.

Happily, a movie has been made which brings the situation more fully to light, and it raises questions about, for example, profiling, civil rights for black people, and the simple issue of justice.  Around the same time the movie was released the George Zimmerman trial was in progress and decided. The acquittal of George Zimmerman on the grounds of self defense in the slaying of Trayvon Martin sparked outrage, and national protest.  Unfortunately, one of those protests was in Oakland where there was property damage and injuries inflicted on innocent people.

May I say, the movie does not start out promising, it is low budget, and looks it, however as it went along I was totally transported by it knowing its dreadful end.  Some of the storytelling elements are clunky and obviously manipulative.  Undoubtedly, this was done to make the character look more sympathetic, but the story could have achieved the same effect with less manipulation.

Told in a non linear fashion we are not always sure where we are in the scheme of things.  Oscars has faults, and the movie does not attempt to hide them.  If it played up only those faults, there would be a danger of stereotyping.  Go too far the other way and it's manipulative.  Yes, he had substance issues, yes he did time, yes he lost his job because he was unreliable.  But these are not the only things that define a character.  The director has to tread carefully in depicting a real persons tragedy both to honor Oscar Grant, and to not further wound an already hurting family and community.

I felt a few things were overboard.  Visiting a store, he sees a white woman buying fish for a party, and he calls his grandmother to ask her advice, and then puts the woman on the phone to her.  He sees a dog injured in a hit and run at the side of the road, and cares for it.

What is compelling though is Octavia Spensers performance as his mother.  Surely, this is deserving of at east an Oscar nomination if not the Oscar itself.  Here is a very topical theme, in which there is enormous public interest.

As for Oscar himself, it does not matter what his record is, he was an innocent person returning to Oakland having spent New Years Evening in San Francisco.  He did nothing to deserve that fate.  There was no reason why one should draw a weapon and fire it on someone lying face down.  The policeman Mehserle said he mistook his gun for a tazer.  But why even pull a tazer when someone is already handcuffed?

I have to admit that certain scenes in the movie were very powerful, towards the end, where Octavia Spenser playing the mother really excelled, and it's through her performance and the performance of the girlfriend and how they respond that we get the sense of the true tragedy of Oscar Grant.

Mehserle was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and is currently free, and the family settled a $28 million lawsuit against the city for $2.8 million.

I found this movie to be emotionally powerful, and moving, and a very important movie to see.  A few years a movie about race relations called Crash won the Academy Award for best Picture, and I hope that this movie will be fully recognised for it's timeliness and its contribution to the ongoing narrative.  And let's not forget Oscar.

Given its emotional weight it is not a movie I would recommend for everyone.  If the subject matter interest you I think you will find it to be powerful. I think you will like and I hope this was helpful.",1379635200,26,3754,4.573353293413174
5884403,5,B00E1LQRWY,This was a very good movie Michael B.

5884404,5,B00E1LQRWY,"So, walking into `Fruitvale Station', I was anticipating a film that was constructed to move me.  I expected it to paint Oscar Grant as a martyr, a saint and a moral lesson.  I expected an abundance of clich&eacute;s and stereotypes to litter the movie and I expected the political assessment of the whole unfortunate incident to be plastered across every frame.  That isn't because I read into complaints (I'm not even sure if that is a complaint, and quite frankly I don't see how it could be one unless you want to get ultra-picky and complain about the 'obviousness' regarding the conversation he has with his daughter) but because this is a biopic about a controversial subject that is recent and has similarities with yet another recent, tragic event.

I assumed wrong.

What `Fruitvale Station' is, is a tightly woven look at the day in the life of a young, troubled man who is shuffling responsibilities, trying to straighten out his life and maintain his identity at the same time while weighing out the consequences of growing up in a place where his options are limited.  Already been locked up once, Oscar doesn't want to go back, but his lifestyle and carefree attitude have cost him his job (fired for being late too often) and has placed his relationship with the mother of his daughter on the rocks.  When the film opens Oscar is having a minor argument with his girlfriend, Sophina, about a tryst he had with another woman.  What spoke to me was the marvelous balance that both actor Michael B. Jordan and writer/director Ryan Coogler gave to Oscar.  They showed us his flaws.  He doesn't take life seriously, he likes his narcotics, he allows temptation to get the best of him, he has a temper; and yet they also layer him with a natural charisma and charm that allow us to see his heart.  Oscar Grant was not a `bad guy', but he wasn't perfect either.

As the film progresses we see Oscar plan for his mother's birthday party, contemplate his future and reflect on his past.  We see him try and rekindle things with Sophina and we get to see the natural glow of their relationship.  Both Jordan and Melonie Diaz bring such chemistry to their performances, helping draw us into their lives.

But yes, the whole film seems to boil down to the inevitable.  I was worried that that was going to be a problem for me with this film.  When you know how something is going to end you tend to wait for the entirety of the film to see how that is going to play out.  You tend to want to rush the rest of the movie because you already know what everything is leading up to.  I never felt that here.  The film is a brisk 85 minutes, and things are so tightly woven that you never had a chance to want it to speed up.  We are given just enough to color in this young man's life and where he is at that given moment, right before everything is torn away from him.  The final twenty minutes or so are neckbreak chaos and tension, but perfectly honed to sustain that tension and create a real sense of panic.  It doesn't hurt that the young actors are so natural and believable in their respective roles.  The brutality of the situation is kept honest, and the awareness of how far things had gone takes shape in unexpected places.  I was really impressed with the way that Coogler handled the police officers, mainly because the depiction of their actions was so abrasive and yet when shots are fired you can read the immediate retraction in their eyes.  You can tell that they understood the gravity of their actions and so this is not just a stereotypical depiction of `the villain'.

The bookends are tear jerkers, for sure.  Having actual footage of the murder and then this year's vigil outside Fruitvale Station (along with video of Grant's young daughter) was enough to reduce me to a puddle, but it was not mere surface tears, for the heart of this film speaks loudly.",1376524800,10,3880,4.527977044476327
5884405,5,B00E1LQRWY,"I have heard my stories about this film fruitvale station. Some of said that this movie was the best film of 2013 and some felt confused about what the message was in this film. The only way that you are going to know if this movie is any good is to see the film for yourself. So i saw the movie last week and my brother and I talked about it and this is what i got out of this film.

we all know the story of oscar grant and the tragedy that happen on 2008 on new years day. from the video footage that i saw on youtube was enough to say that just by listening to the people in the background that this was a horrific event to witness. First you see the transit cops putting his knee on Oscar's neck. Next you see the cops lay oscar on the ground and then the infamous gunshot in the back. I remember seeing that footage and telling myself i had the same reaction as the people on the train...some were screaming in shocked and disbelief while others where so pissed off that they wanted to riot right then and there. so after i saw this video footage it was time to check out the movie.

Now the movie i will not lie to you, it starts off very slow because for a 79 minute film it focused mostly on oscars flaws and attributes. There are various scenes like that thru out the whole movie. like for example, oscar will smoke weed with his girl in the bed, but the next moment he is playing with his daughter tatiana and going against his mother's wishes not to have candy but he gives it to her anyway. Others scenes like Oscar will try to get his old job back, but first he is talking to a female in the store, he gets a hook up from his boy to free food for his mom's birthday and He goes to his old boss and his old boss hired someone else after he was arrested and gets pissed off easily. This is just one of many scenes that happen thru out the whole movie. The complex contractions of this character study of oscar. The good oscar loves his child, he wants to make changes in his life after being in jail and respect the people he loves plus he loves the do. The bad oscars looks at the reality of his situation and realizing that street money is faster to make then trying to do good. By the way did i tell you that oscar has a quick temper. There is a terrific scene in the movie where Oscar and his mother have a visiting day and i will talk about michael jordan in a second. The scene where he is cursing at one of the inmates for disrespecting his mom was disturbing yet brilliant scene to show this complex individual who has a lot of charm, yet he has a vicious temper.

The movie in the beginning is slow but i am not going to lie on you the movie does pick up at the end of the movie. this is where i will talk about my title did Oscars flaws get him killed? the answer that question is yes. Remember oscar is two personalities. I believe what happen was that oscar made mistakes in fighting on the train. I know people are going to say while the other person started it first. Oscar had the opportunity to change his mind and walk away. Now he fights this dude, the transit police pull him out of the train. This is the moment where you start to look at the situation real close and you can see how this can be a situation where it seems like its everyone's fault. If Oscar didn't fight on the train he wouldn't have been pull out by the police leading to his death. If the transit had did his job and not played around with his gun and fired it, oscar would be alive. If oscar and his boys would have calm down during that situation maybe things would have not gotten out of hand. I do admit that Oscar was the one who threw the first punch. The director took a very big risk in doing the flaws because it could of given a mixed message but i think that is what made the movie so interesting because oscar's flaws where enough to say ok he wasn't a innocent victim in all this. Oscar did get into trouble on the day he was supposed to be making changes and yet he gets into a fight and that fight change the course of his life by ending it with a bullet in his back.

The sad part about this whole situation is that even though there were many wrongs on all sides of this problem and i guess that is what the director wanted to do was show that this was not just black and white but a whole of grey and no easy answers to find. I really loved the ending to this film. If amazon ever get this movie on dvd and it was a very cheap price i would by this movie in a second. I have to say that for a indie film this was a great second half of the movie. I do admit that the flaws of Oscar were going back and forth which it did give me a headache but for the most part i do love the ending especially seeing his daughter tatiana at the ending. the film was very moving.

Michael Jordan gave tour-de-force performance in this complex character of oscar grant. Michael shows us that oscar was not perfect and that even though his flaws was very real and problematic the point was that Michael did an amazing job showing people that oscar was not a good dad or good person to his mom and his wifey all the time. I can see Michael being nominated for best actor for this performance. The director did a great job with this film and did leave the audience thinking about this situation.

The moral of the story is Its never too late to want to change your life because its very short. You have to teach yourself how to live your life as a good person and not let the flaws and the ghetto come out of you. Oscar's life shouldn't be judged based on that night. It should be judged by How he lived and what legacy he left behind. The legacy that he left was that police Violence still continues and it can be stop by recording their actions, taking a stand and realizing that Oscar's background is his personal issues that he was working to change but its was the actions of the police that needed changing on new years day also. Thank Youtube everyday for exposing the violence and misconduct that happens every day.

my heart goes out to tatiana. She is the one that should get the love and respect because she lost her father and her father will not be on this earth anymore.",1376352000,,6183,4.096534653465347
5884406,5,B00E1LQRWY,"Without giving a total synopsis og this movie I'll just simply say this movie is just GREAT in every aspect. The acting is TERRIFIC, me and a friend went to see this in the BAM theater in NY and I didn't Know what to expect I was familiar with the story prior to seeing the movie so the storyline took me by surprise.

It is a real tear jerker. Did I mention the acting was absolutely AMAZING? LOL

I recommend this movie to everyone in the entire universe.",1376179200,,457,4.181818181818182
5884407,4,B00E1LQRWY,"An independent film written and directed with stunning effectiveness by newcomer Ryan Coogler, Fruitvale Station is based on a true story, and even though its story of an unarmed black male who is shot on New Year's Day, is pulled from national headlines, the film is a character study of the choices in life and how a cruel twist of fate intervenes.  It lingers in the heart and mind long after the end, and as such is one of the best films of the year.

We witness video footage of police rounding up black youths at a transit train station, and while the suspects are on the ground and restrained, a gun goes off striking one of them in full view of witnesses.  What follows is a flashback account of the final day of Oscar Grant's life and the events leading up to New Year's Day 2009.  Amid the backdrop of the Oakland Bay area, Oscar (Michael B. Jordan in a breakout performance) is a young black man whose background is a mix of prison, drug dealing, and failed jobs amid a serious relationship with his girlfriend, Sophina (Melonie Diaz), and their little daughter.  He loves his family especially his mother (Octavia Spencer is rock solid) and vows to make a better life for them.  It is New Year's Eve, and he helps to prepare his mother's birthday celebration.  Just as he is on the brink of a new start, fate intervenes at a transit station and a deadly encounter with police.

Oscar is a man who has a conscience and a sense of responsibility.  On the one hand he is portrayed as a devoted father, a passionate lover to his girlfriend, and loving son to his mom, and yet he lies to his loved ones and is in constant turmoil.  It is affecting to see that he genuinely wants to leave behind his broken life and get a second chance.  We root for him too, and that makes what happens at the end that much more compelling.

This is the sort of subject matter, which can be viewed as an indictment of police violence and a statement on racism that might have been ideal for HBO or a filmed documentary like The Thin Blue Line.  You also expect to see a post-shooting trial, but the film focuses instead on the events and people around Oscar that lead up to the fateful moment.  It is a portrait of a young, flawed life ended before it has a chance to redeem itself.  We want to know a bit more about Oscar; what put him in prison, and what was his childhood like? Instead we get a fragment, one day in his life, about a father and his little daughter and the life they had and never will again.  The final images of Oscar's real life daughter after the events depicted in the film are touching and sobering.

Coogler shows a good command of a scene and how to make it authentic.  Moments of levity such as a group countdown to New Years are counterpointed by tense confrontations from the past.  The dialogue is realistic, and you really feel you are watching a slice of real life.  The pivotal scene of the police arresting Oscar and his friends is startling and upsetting; you feel like it could happen to you.  The frantic reactions and emotions of the victims and witnesses as a shot rings out is heart wrenching.

Liberal use of handheld cameras lends an immediacy and realism to the events, and there is a great shot of Sophina from behind as she reacts to the tragedy.  We don't need to see her face because we know from her body language exactly how she must feel.

One wonders how much of the screenplay is based on truth, but whether this is or isn't a biased view of an event by the filmmaker, it is highly emotionally affective filmmaking. In light of other recent, racially charged headlines, it cannot help but become a hot topic.  This vivid, stark reenactment of an event that should never have happened is a relatively simple tale of a complex life, a kind of urban, American tragedy.  It is a powerful, filmic statement that raises questions that demand answers.",1376092800,69,3887,4.431786216596343
5884408,4,B00E1LQRWY,"This is based on the true story of Oscar Grant. This emotional film opens with some actual footage of the incident.

Oscar (Michael B. Jordan) is no saint. We discover he has done time. His relationship with his wife/gf (Melonie Diaz) is strained due to an infidelity. He has gone back to his old ways of dealing pot which has caused him to lose his job. Oscar also has good qualities. He is close to his family. He helps strangers and stray dogs. He recently dumped his baggie of pot as he has realized he was on the wrong path.

It is New Year's eve and his mother's (Octavia Spencer) birthday. Tonight he is going to celebrate with his wife as his life seems to becoming normal, but his prison past comes back to haunt him.

This is a dramatic representation of Oscar's life leading up to the Fruitvale Bart Station incident. I do not know how much outside of the incident is true. The film seems to place Oscar on the road to sainthood after a few stumbles, which set off my skeptic alarm. I would say some of the film was dramatic filler. Octavia Spencer gives us a great performance while the rest of the supporting cast was spotty. Oscar's life was fairly boring which in turn translated into numerous slow moments. This was apparently done by design so as to create the gut-wrenching sickening feeling at the climax.

The film was a winner at both Cannes and Sundance. Certainly worth watching for the politically active.

5884409,5,B00E1LQRWY,"This is a small character study based on the life of Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old man who was shot at a public transit system in 2009 and became a symbol of injustice, especially of police brutality. If you aren't sure exactly what this incident was about, that's fine. Don't let that stop you from seeing this amazing piece of cinema.

The actual incident was captured on cell phones - some of this footage opens the film.

The movie takes place on New Year's Eve 2008. Oscar is recently out of jail and is trying to make his life work. He has a girlfriend and a daughter, so he is trying extremely hard to stay legitimate and give up his drug-dealing past. But financial and emotional stresses make it difficult for him to stay away from the high-risk, easy money life he had before. As he and his girlfriend make plans to celebrate New Year's Eve in the city, a random decision changes their lives forever.

Part of the power of this film is in how real the characters are. There is almost no violence, no screaming, no scandal. If you are looking for
a gritty movie about tough street thugs full of sex, betrayal, and bullet holes, then look elsewhere. This isn't that movie.

The director carefully tries to humanize the incident. He doesn't sensationalize any particular aspect. Yes, Oscar and his friends are black, and racial profiling certainly may have played a part in what happened. But the movie doesn't exploit America's racial tension. Yes, there are characters that deal drugs, but they aren't depicted as violent, greedy thugs. Yes, there are characters that are single mothers, but they aren't bitter welfare queens whose lives are crumbling around them. And yes, most of the people are poor, but they aren't shiftless, lazy bums - they hold jobs and work extra shifts.

The acting in this film is amazing. I completely bought the relationships among the characters, and their daily struggles. They weren't acting their roles, they were inhabiting them. This is especially true of the main actor, Michael B. Jordan. He has had minor roles in a few movies, but is probably more recognized from television than cinema. So he kind of comes out of nowhere for this movie. He is absolutely mesmerizing. To watch him switch from sensitive father to hardened thug and back again is like watching magic. His performance is far and away the best acting I've seen all year. If he doesn't win some kind of award for this role, then there is no justice in the world.

When people become victims of crimes that morph into social issues, the human becomes a victim who then becomes a martyr. Everything gets lost in the hype. This movie pulls everything back down - the martyr is made into a victim who becomes human again. And you find yourself back in real life. Where trivial decisions mix with past mistakes, and suddenly you are at a confluence of forces that you are powerless to stop.

This makes the incident more surprisingly powerful and emotional than any amount of news footage.",1375401600,6,2992,4.7093690248565965
5884410,4,B00E1LQRWY,"Theatrical review.

Director and writer Ryan Coogler walks us patiently through the last day of 22 year old Oscar Grant. On New Year's Day, 2009 Grant was shot in the back by a BART policeman while lying on the ground.

Portrayed with a mix of grace and anger by rising star Michael B. Jordan, Grant wasn't perfect.  He did a stint in prison (shown in flashback) for dealing drugs, and in several scenes we see he has a short fuse.  He wakes up on December 31 and decides his life of drug dealing is over and tries to get his job in a grocery store back after being fired for being tardy numerous times.  He doesn't but he still plans to walk the straight and narrow, primarily for the benefit of his 4 year old daughter, her mother and girlfriend Sophina (Melonie Diaz) and his mother (another award worthy performance by Octavia Spencer).

Coogler sees Grant as a good father who loves his daughter and wants to improve his relationships with Sophina and his mother.  I couldn't help but wonder, is this man really that nice a guy?  I don't know.  Grant and Sophina are headed across the Bay to San Francisco with their friends.  Wanda (Spencer) suggests they take the train so they can drink without worrying about driving home.  Again, Coogler seems to drive this point home as if to attach the blame to Wanda.

This event was played out in the press so the story is well known.  In fact, Coogler shows real footage at the beginning of the movie, which caused a shriek or two in the theater I was in.  A couple women even walked out at the end of the movie when the murder was reenacted.  It is hard to watch and for many, hard to fathom.  Unfortunately we see similar tragedies all too often.

This is an excellent film, with some quality acting.  At first I was a bit put off by the use of hand-held cameras but after a while the film takes on an almost documentary style, which I suspect was the idea.  More people should see this movie.",1375056000,,1944,4.379888268156424
5884411,5,B00E1LQRWY,"Today is the day I finally got to view this film.

I had been hearing about this movie since the year 2013 started, an I did not know the synopsis for the movie until much later. Not only that, I did not expect Michael B. Jordan to be playing the lead character. I have the movie Chronicle, and not only did I enjoy that particular movie, but I really admired his performance. But even then, I was sort of unfamiliar with his work as an actor. But just today after viewing Fruitvale Station for the first time, Michael B Jordan not only took me by storm, he took the ENTIRE audience by storm.

Michael B Jordan plays Oscar Grant, and as I already stated his performance was absolutely terrific. When you sit down to watch this movie, and you are introduced to his character, you understand immediately what is going on here. The movie is not just about what happened that fateful night, but it shows that a person can take all the negative that may be in his or her life and make it positive for the better. Great job here; I expect a nomination.

Supporting cast includes Octavia Spencer( you may remember her as Minny in the movie The Help) as Oscar's mother Wanda, Melonie Diaz as Sophina Oscar's girlfriend. Also Starring in this movie are Chad Michael Murray, and Kevin Durand as the two police officers. The Whole cast was gave passionate, memorable performances.

Did I cry watching this movie? Well I will say that I was able to hold back my tears during several moments; but it was very hard.

I really admired this movie; not only that, I have a new found respect for Michael B Jordan as an actor. This guy can Seriously act. Hats off to up and coming director Ryan Coogler as well. His heart and mind was definitely in the right place in making this movie. The whole set design and layout, and overall atmosphere that Fruitvale Station has makes this movie not only one of the best movies of the Summer but one of the best overall films of the year. First it was Silver Linings Playbook, last year and this year The Weinstein movie company continues to be on a unstoppable roll. And with that being said, the 2014 Academy Awards have a serious Best Actor contender and an even more serious Best Picture contender for this movie right here. Fruitvale Station gets a perfect score of
