2257002,5,B00082ZR3A,"I had to watch this movie in my American Lit. class. Everyone I'd ever heard talk about it did not have nice things to say. I truly enjoyed this film. Besides the teacher, I was the only person in my class who did! It was mysterious and symbolic and tragic. It was great! I really loved everything about it, basically. I think they should do a remake sometime with well-known actors, but it should stay very true to the story (even though I've never read it; I plan to). Every English teacher should show this movie, but I think the story should be read as well.",1010188800,3,562,4.311320754716981

2257015,4,B00082ZR3A,"Rappaccini's Daughter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne, is a riveting tale, but I wasn't sure a film based on it would remain true to what Hawthorne wrote. And yet, it did. Kristoffer Tabori and Kathleen Beller are perfectly cast and their rendition of the central characters seemed flawless, making the film as unforgettable as the original short story - a very rare result.",1373414400,,366,5.016393442622951
2257016,4,B00082ZR3A,"This film adaptation of Hawthorne's classic is very well done.  There are a few minor deviations from the written work, most of them being elements of the text not translating very well by the director's direction.  For one, Dr. Rappaccini doesn't have quite the sinister feel that he does in the book.  I also felt that the film lacked the same kind of emphasis placed on the text's perspective on science's not being a means to human perfection.  At any rate, the point is that there are differences that some may categorize as minutia, while others, such as myself, would classify as major failings of the medium change.  Nonetheless, I think ontic and contextual features are so well preserved in the film that it can be considered a success to a high degree.  It is definitely well worth one's time.

As far as the cinematic virtues, the film is quite mediocre.  A couple of the parts are played well, but that's about it; and the main duo are not those characters.  The scenery is lovely, and, though I have never been there, gave me the feel of Italy.

I should note that the film quality is fairly poor. I think the film was done in the 80's, yet my guess, based on the film quality, was that it was done in the 60's.

At the end of the day, I would recommend this to anyone who has at least a moderate interest in Hawthorne or the story, or as an ersatz for anyone who prefers movies to classic literature texts (shame on you :-) ).",1356048000,2,1441,4.4
2257017,2,B00082ZR3A,"This is a wonderful production, which I have seen before, but this DVD looks like a bootleg.  The picture is incredibly dark, so that what should be a colorful production, looks like it was filmed at night.  I was very disappointed. If anyone knows where I can get a good copy, please let me know.",1352937600,,297,4.381818181818182
2257018,4,B00082ZR3A,"I saw this haunting short film sometime in the early 1980s when it aired on PBS.  And here I am some 30 years later searching to see if it is available for purchase or viewing in this Age of Amazon.  That alone should serve as ample proof of my estimation of both Hawthorne's short story and this short film.  BUT, I think Amazon should have prominently included somewhere in their Product Details, that although this film had a US release date of 2005,  it was in fact released for the first time several decades earlier and therefore is not a recent film with up-to-date production values.  I am giving the film only 4 stars for now, but will update my review if needed after I have seen it again.",1345334400,3,699,4.387596899224806
2257019,3,B00082ZR3A,"In the 1970's, Henry Fonda hosted a weekly to monthly series entitled ""The American Short Story"" where Thoreau,Hemingway and other American author's works were teleplayed for a one hour prime time viewing. I am on a Hawthorne kick right now, so I watched Nathaniel Hawthorne's 'Rappaccini's Daughter' after seeing 'The Scarlet Letter.' The story is Hawthorne to a tee,with virtually no deviation from the original short story. I am not a fan of Hawthorne's prose,especially his novels,but 'Rappaccini's Daughter' was always a more accessible story for me in that typical Hawthorne way of talking about the interference of man with one's soul.
""Rappaccini's Daughter"" was penned by Hawthorne in 1843 and is quite a simple story of one student scholar,Giovanni,who travels to Padua to study at The University, and takes a room that overlooks a mysterious courtyard garden overseen by the even more mysterious Dr. Rappaccini,reported for his ""unholy experiments"" with possibly nature and man. This intrigues Giovanni and one day he is captivated by the stunning dark-haired Beatrice (Be-a-TREE-chay), the Doctor's daughter. Giovanni watches her daily as she tends the plants and talks to one in particular. Something is quite strange, though, about Beatrice Rappaccini. She touches things and they die. What is the awful secret of Rappaccini's daughter?
Where this 60 minute story fails is basically in it's extremely cheap production value, and not so much in Hawthorne. The colors are extremely faded and the music and sound is that of 1970 television production,meaning low-budget quality. This is a good rental, but definitely not worth the $13 for a DVD.PBS has re-released this, but no upgrade in quality has been made from the original 1972 video tape. If you need to see this for a reason, the tape will do at a much cheaper price. The acting is marginal to pretty awful.

2257020,4,B00082ZR3A,"I used this to prepare seventh graders to tackle the short story in English class. While the movie feels a little dated, it isn't a big deal because it is supposed to be set in the past.  The students were appropriately creeped out and engaged and were really able to understand the challenging writing because they have something to make connections. The accuracy of the movie was nice.  Any changes were minor and something that we could discuss, but weren't overly distracting.  At least they didn't give it a happy ending!!",1191974400,5,527,4.769230769230769
2257021,5,B00082ZR3A,"From a rented apartment overlooking an enchanting botanical garden young Giovanni (Kristoffer Tabori) observes a beautiful girl (Kathleen Beller) walking alone talking to the flowers. There is a reason why she is alone but by the time he learns the dark secret for her isolation he has fallen in love.

This 57 minute PBS Presentation was quite a pleasant surprise. Some may find it a little slow, but I found it absolutely hypnotic. Like a prolonged dream sequence, you are drawn against your will towards the enigmatic Beatrice. I've been an admirer of Kathleen Beller for quite sometime and I must say they couldn't have found a more beautiful woman for this role. She has never looked lovelier than she does here.",1116979200,21,717,4.877049180327869
2257022,5,B00082ZR3A,"I saw this on PBS and discovered that Hawthorne was much more than the guy who wrote 'The Scarlet Letter'.
