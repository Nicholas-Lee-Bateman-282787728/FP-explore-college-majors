2630262,5,B000H7JCF0,"Until I watched this box set, Beavis and Butthead was a mere memory of my childhood.  I used to watch this with my older brother when I was 6 or 7, and even though I did not understand most of the jokes I still found great humor in the show.  Now 19 years old, I understand the jokes and the show is just as funny as I remember it.  This box set is a must have for anyone who is a fan of the show.  They were also smart enough to pull out the music videos and put them on their own, separate disc for those who liked/disliked them.  The only downside is that only about 2/3 of the episodes are in this collection.  The other 1/3 were episodes Mike Judge thought were poor in quality.",1243900800,5,683,3.985294117647059
2630263,5,B000H7JCF0,"This is great if you like Beavis and Butthead.  There are a lot of episodes to watch, music videos, and the movie; so if you like Beavis and Butthead this is a great item to get.",1240790400,3,178,3.9444444444444446
2630264,4,B000H7JCF0,the dvd set is okay butt they really should release complete seasoned box sets on dvd instead of just putting out mikes favorites.,1234224000,6,130,4.695652173913044

2630267,5,B000H7JCF0,"This collection was great. It has some of the best episodes that they ever created. A lot of fun to watch. Even now, still makes me laugh. Even if you weren't that big into it then, you just just might like it now.",1200873600,4,214,4.0

2630269,5,B000H7JCF0,My husband Rudy and I really had a lot of laughs watching Beavis and Butthead do and say stupid things.  It took us back to our younger years and it was great!!  Heh-Heh-Heh-Heh-Heh-Heh!!,1184457600,,187,4.636363636363637

8137336,4,B000H7JCF0,I would have given it five stars but it's missing a few episodes i really wanted,1417219200,,80,4.0625
8137337,3,B000H7JCF0,"A lot of people don't realize this but this is not a complete collection. In fact, there are quite a lot of episodes missing. The entire first season isn't even on this from what I recall. This really is more of a collection of the ''best'' episodes, but shouldn't that be left to the fans to decide? I don't understand why it's so complicated to have a complete collection of every single episode produced.

Furthermore, with the recent revival of the series for an 8th season, this is even less of a complete series.",1409702400,,518,4.51063829787234
8137338,5,B000H7JCF0,Any true Beavis and Butt head fan needs to get this. I grew up watching Beavis and Butthead and it's just as I remember it. It's a solid five stars!!!,1397347200,,150,4.033333333333333
8137339,4,B000H7JCF0,"I was an absolute fan when the show first came on MTV. We all waited so long for something official to be released but I cant help but feel cheated. I am gratefull for what was delivered but come on! Really? That might be acceptable to the younger crowd those of us that were raised on the show, so to speak, feel cheated but its all good.",1356307200,,339,4.074626865671642
8137340,5,B000H7JCF0,"uu huh huh huh.when i got this in the mail,i it was cool.i hugged the package it came in.uh huh huh.i said package and came in.the opening music kicked AAAA-butt! when they executed the grass hopper,it was one of the coolest things i had ever seen.yeah ! and that time they played plate frisbee with fine china . that ROCKED !.i have a buch of cool tattoes but i never got a tatto of a butt with a butt shaped tattoo on it on my butt.and im sure no butt ventriloquist.[preach on,brother beavis].i said butt a whole bunch.
when beavis was playing pirate poker,that was cool,especialy when he stabbed his own finger and blood squirted everywhere.and these 2 definately spend a lot of time auditioning thier finger puppets and shining thier helmets.thats not to mention all those times they peeled some chilis and had a tug of war with cyclops !.
like,look,beavis ! on that one part where they were typing its all gibberish except a word referring to a chick who likes other chicks.yeah ! yeah !.that ruled ! and when the saw the mountain.beavis even wrestles........with his manhood.and says ""i usualy win too"".
that dork mr van dreason wears a tricky dick[richard nixon] costume at halloween even though he's a hippie and richard nixon shut down the hippies at kent state by shooting them.yeah!,he mustve been pis@#$ errr urinated. uh huh huh.i said ummm another word for richard.yeah yeah ! and that time they were drinking beer and had to take a so...umm...huh..huh...briety....test or something.butthead said ""im too drunk to take a test"".that was cool.
at that wedding,slash was there.that rocked !.on the wall behind beavis there is a picture of a fisherman.its probably his dad.butthead always says he was a seaman.ummm huh huh huh.i said ""seaman"".butthead always calls beavis's mom a @#$%&*&^%$$% censored! [less than reputable female].
like,uummm,you should buy this. YEAH YEAH ! DO IT,FART KNOCKER BEFORE I KICK YOUR A&$ ! SO put that in your butt and smoke it ! yeah ! huh huh huh.that was cool.",1348012800,,2004,4.845481049562682
8137341,5,B000H7JCF0,Product came as stated. Description was great. Came exactly the way it was described. Really appreciated the region rating as many of the dvd's were not able to play on U.S. disc players. Was a birthday gift for my boyfriend who is a B&B fantic and he LOVED it!,1290729600,,261,4.346938775510204
8137342,4,B000H7JCF0,"The videos are great, I was hoping for the original aired episodes the way MTV played them years ago.  Don't get me wrong, they are, but separated from the music videos they would watch and critique. So watching the DVD, you see episode after episode of the cartoons, never any music videos, those are played separate on a different DVD. Still, it's a blast from the past, just not presented in it's original format.

Also, the bobble-head dolls are neat, but small and insignificant. They aren't wearing their traditional AC/DC and Metallica shirts but they come with the package and so it's a little something extra.

This package is definitely worth it if you're a fan, especially because you get the movie too.",1274659200,2,714,4.788617886178862
8137343,5,B000H7JCF0,"This collection is simply great, I couldn't stop laughing when I was watching the first shows of Beavis and Butthead, the one called ""No laughing"", it is admirable how stupid these guys are and how they give a f*** about everything.
In another review I saw that they were saying that there would be no music videos, this is not true, the third disc has many videos, I am sure those are not all the videos from Beavis and Butthead but you get some, and really funny ones. The things is that the videos are not a part of each episode as we use to see it in MTV(when MTV was a good source of good music, now it is all about reality shows and pop, hip hop, even reggaeton singers)
If you liked B&B and want to remember some great funny times... get it.",1258934400,4,748,4.165517241379311
8137344,5,B000H7JCF0,"B and B at their best!

Although there are a few small negatives to this collection, it's simply the best official release we are going to get....

and boy is it worth it!!!

AWESOME!!

5 HUGE stars!!!!",1253664000,2,202,4.378378378378378
