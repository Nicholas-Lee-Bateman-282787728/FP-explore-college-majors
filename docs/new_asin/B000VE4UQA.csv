2940308,3,B000VE4UQA,"The movie was boring for me all the way threw untill the end. The first rape was a shocker, I have to admit, but to sit threw what she does after the that scene and watch the rest of the events up untill the most desturbing thing I've ever seen in a movie. Like what everyone else says, I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, but I must say that there should have been a warning or something on the movie about that last scene.

2940309,1,B000VE4UQA,"i am in agreement with what has been said of the film by the reviews already
on this page. my comment therefore is about the dvd itself. a most dis-
appointing transfer. especially in the final scene when Mia gets her revenge
on Jarrod. when i saw the film in theaters everything was crisp clear and
sharp but on the dvd leads Rosario Dawson, Chad Faust and Marcus Patrick
look like orange people from Mars. not only that but the rest of the screen
is so dark you can hardly differentiate anything as you could cleary do so in theaters. again one of the most disappointing dvd transfers ever.",1202774400,43,592,4.440366972477064
2940310,5,B000VE4UQA,"Women really have it rough.  So many men are cold, calculating, selfish, and cruel - and, in too many cases, violent - and each woman has to try and find the needle in a haystack that is a truly good man.  I don't know how women can trust a single one of us, to be honest.  Most men just don't understand that women are exquisite and precious, and that we don't even deserve their notice or attention.  The lowest of the low, of course, are male rapists.  I think any man who would rape a woman deserves the most severe of punishments.  And that, my friends, is what Descent is all about.

Provocative, controversial, unforgettable - these adjectives and many more like them fail to even do true justice to this film.  Descent is an incredibly brave and shocking film, and Rosario Dawson turns in an Oscar-worthy performance.  Unfortunately, the film's NC-17 rating (which, I think all will agree, is quite justified) means the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences probably won't touch it with a ten-foot pole, but Descent certainly made waves at the Tribeca Film Festival and has had audiences talking wherever it has played.  Personally, I have all kinds of respect for the filmmakers because they told the story they wanted to tell and didn't water it down in order to get an R rating (and thus open up many more marketing opportunities for the project).

The story follows Maya (Rosario Dawson), a studious young college student, as she attempts to rebuild her life after being raped.  When he first introduced himself to Maya at a party, Jared (Chad Faust) came across as a slightly creepy but seemingly nice guy - weird but nice.  I thought he came across a little strong in his efforts to get a date with her, but Maya wouldn't have finally agreed to go out with him if she didn't think he was serious about her.  Once Jared finally gets Maya back to his place, though, we see him as the monster he truly is.  The rape scene itself is disturbing, but it's not nearly as racy as I expected.  Following this night, Maya withdraws into a lost and empty soul.  In time, she begins frequenting a local dance club and using alcohol to ease her inner pain.  It is there that she meets Adrian (Marcus Patrick), who really doesn't live up to his reputation as a helper of lost souls.  Despite his own major character flaws, however, he does help Maya empower herself to return to her former life.  When she crosses paths with Jared once again, she has the inner strength to deal with it.  Boy oh boy, does she deal with it, as you'll see in the film's shocking conclusion.

Descent does have the feel of a film festival type of movie.  We are treated to several tiny moments in Maya's life that don't seem relevant on the face of things, transitions are often marked by several seconds of cinematic blackness, and there's a somewhat disjointed sense of time as events progress - for example, we immediately jump ahead several months following the rape.  The film also poses some provocative questions, especially in terms of revenge.  No matter how much you may sympathize with Maya, some will feel that she takes her revenge way too far, and it's an open question as to whether or not she finds any peace at all in the wake of her actions.  No matter who you are, one or more aspect of this film is bound to make you uncomfortable, and therein is where the true power of this film comes across loud and clear.

Some viewers have expressed a sense of disappointment with this film, but I was more than impressed by the story and the somewhat surrealistic way in which it was presented.  This is a decidedly gritty film that digs all the way down to the roots of human emotion, treading a dark path that few filmmakers are willing to travel.  It is perhaps no accident that Descent represents the first feature-length film from director/co-writer/producer Talia Lugacy as well as the producorial debut of Rosario Dawson herself.  (I should mention the fact that the DVD comes with a director/writer commentary that also includes Rosario Dawson, a post-screening Q and A video with Talia Lugacy and Dawson, exclusive interviews, and two rather lengthy deleted scenes - the second of which would have added even more dimensions to the depth and scope of the film.)  The deep and intimate level of Dawson's commitment to her character clearly shows, making this film a tour de force that is, in the words of the New York Times, ""hard to watch but essential to see.""",1202169600,40,4466,4.6080910240202275
2940311,5,B000VE4UQA,"Ever since this picture opened The Tribeca Film Festival this past year, the underground buzz on it has been crazy, so I just had to see it for myself.  I can only imagine the looks on people's faces in the audience when the final scene arrived and we see just how clever Rosario's character scores revenge on her rapist with the help of her sexy beast friend played by the very perfect Marcus Patrick!

2940417,1,B000VE4UQA,"Now I love my rape/revenge movies and after some hype about how 'brutal' and 'disturbing' this film was, I was expecting to be entertained. Unfortunately what we get in 'Descent' is pretentious arty crap masquerading as an exploitation movie and not even up to scratch with a serious drama approach such as 'Extremities' or 'The Accused'.

Rosario Dawson is a good actress who I enjoyed in 'Clerks II' but her performance here is bland and boring, in line with the entire filming technique. The direction is flat and uninspired. Characterisation is terrible- Maya is given virtually no motivation or explanation for her drastic shifts in behaviour. The rapist Jared comes across initially as a decent guy then transforms for no reason into an obnoxious jock, who is thick as a brick and vacant-mouthed throughout the last half of the movie.

After Maya is raped and graduates she meets some DJ and ends up in a stupid club which is supposed to be all 'edgy' but just looks like all those crap modern pornos filmed in a warehouse where all the swarthy greasy guys look like Rocco Siffredi and John Stagliano. Anyone who has seen these sort of adult films will know what I mean.

These scenes go on forever with endless dancing, drugs, sex and racist/sexist gangsta rap crap but it's all bland. Of course one could be all academic and claim that it's Maya's reaction to her violation and a means of self-punishment or lack of self-worth but 'Descent' seems to want to satisfy both clich&eacute;s that all women are sluts and all men are scumbags. The adult classic 'V-The Hot One' handled this theme far better with far more realistic and believable results. Just like 'Antichrist' though, if you present explicit sex and ooh taboo-breaking male nudity in an arty way, you can get away with  X-rated scenes.

By the end of the movie Maya gets her attacker handcuffed to a bed and has one of the degenerates from the club rape him. This prolonged homosexual rape goes on far too long and is no suitable closure at all. Jared's expression is one of 'whatever' and even the guy doing it doesn't seem to care either. Maya doesn't even watch.

If you want to be disturbed, watch 'A Serbian Film'. If you want a decent rape/revenge movie there's far better out there which deliver the goods.

This NC-17 edition is in anamorphic 1.85:1 widescreen, but the picture is very dark in places and there's a commentary, interviews and deleted scenes.",1424131200,,2435,4.7559241706161135

It effectively demonstrates Maya's emotional descent and transformation after her rape. Watch the connection between Adrian and Maya which merges them into opposite sides of the same coin. This film uses subtle neuances like color and shadows to communicate  Maya's emotional state, her budding curiosity and her psychologically becoming her attacker.

2940450,4,B000VE4UQA,"SHOUT OUT: Spoilers ahoy! Before I review the movie for you let me first call on the people who already reviewed this movie and had the phrasing ""Didn't like the ending"" then you are totally watching this movie in a wrong light because since when did revenge films were supposed to be likable? Then let's say, ""oh because of the rape"". Then why the last part was the only thing you saw as something disgusting and terrible? Rape is sick. Period. It doesn't matter if it's between a dog and a dog, a spoon and a fork, a man to a woman, or a man to a man: in the end it's rape and it is a crime. Are you telling me, you liked the first rape and then ""oh I didn't like the ending 'cause whoa gay scene"". Then whoever you are, god forsake your soul, you are not even remotely mature enough to watch this and let alone UNDERSTAND the point of the movie. Moving on...

MORAL OF THE STORY(?)/UNDERSTANDING: Okay, now that is done. I am not all gaga for this movie, it wasn't a very inspirational movie, which I get since the point of the title, which is ""DESCENT"", is that these are series of events spiraling downwards rather than up. It's very twisted and depressing and I guess I can tell that, that is the point of the screenplay and direction.

It is in the point where in the end, not one of the characters really got what they deserved nor anyone got passed by the problem of trauma. It only got worse.

I can say these held not a moral of the story but rather a harsh lesson of reality of how people handle their grief and revenge. Most of the time, it isn't satisfying in the way that you only become the monster you were fearing in the first place to be able to do exact revenge on the person you have beef with. And in the end is it worth it? Is it worth to be the abuser of your abuser? To be the killer of your killer?

Resolutions are most effective in ways that what ever started the problem should end in the opposite way to totally let it die but in this case it doesn't get it, it's like a chain that kept repeating because you just took the same path your abuser took.

Just a chain, descending down and down and down and never ending until one choice takes the other direction.

ACTING: I can say enough that no acting was awkward in this movie. Nothing that was like out of place. The actors did their job and did it true to feelings like it should be.

BOTTOM LINE: I give this a 4 out of 5. The concept was amazing in this movie, but the screenplay needed work. It was in a way dull but not in a bad way, just dull. Mostly even realism movies like these needs a great story telling to compel the audience and this one just made me really feel like a witness to something that was obviously crumbling down.",1413504000,,2721,4.151802656546489
2940451,4,B000VE4UQA,"Rosario Dawson has played a wide range of characters through the years and this role may be her most daring yet. She plays a student who has not had the greatest luck in the relationship dept and upon meeting a charmer who is quite persistent finally gives him a chance with dinner and drinks.  From there we get one heck of a roller coaster ride that takes her into the world of s & m, underground clubs and the meeting of a mysterious and powerful man who shows her that revenge comes in all forms.
This was a really different movie and the last 10 minutes will blow you away with a ""omg"" moment that you will never see coming.

I've seen revenge porn movies where every scene makes sense, and helps the story run its course. And others, that verge on complete WTF fantasy. Descent is the former.

2940541,5,B000VE4UQA,"It's hard to say I love this movie, but I really do enjoy it's purpose.
This film is about a college student who gets raped by an at first charming jock, and her journey to find herself again even if that means an eye for an eye.
1. I think the plot, Rosario's acting and the director's style perfectly showcase the struggle of what some people go through when trying to get themselves back after any kind of assault.
2. The film is purposefully shot in low lighting during certain scenes to convey the 'descent' (if you will) into darkness. That horrible dark place you go during and often after a traumatic experience.
3. The dialogue of this movie is not meant to be some type of deep Shakesperian drama, it is appropriate for the struggle of Rosario's character- how she perceives everyone around and vise versa.
4. The 2 rape scenes in this movie altough kind of graphic, I think should be visited, it is something that happens often in society, almost always unsuspectingly and sometimes by someone we know or feel we can trust. I like that the movie explores this and think more people should watch this movie to better understand the damage that assualt inflicts on someone and the support that is needed.
5. Pay attention to how many times Rosario's style changes throughout the movie, take into account her lack of care in personal health, her constant shifting personality- all excellent depicted signs of ones struggle to cope after trauma and psychological impact that has on a human being.

Is this a movie you will pull out and watch again and again? Most likely not, but I would recommend watching (whether you are a Psych major or just curious).",1377129600,5,1662,4.653061224489796

I had assumed the NC-17 rating was simply due to the subject matter itself, but some mentions of male genitalia in other reviews have convinced me that I must have seen a badly edited version. The final sequence of the version I saw was filmed in a way that I was not even completely sure that another male was even in the room; I thought the scenario was a fantasy playing out in Rosario Dawson's mind. In any event, I saw enough to understand what went down. The film doesn't really present a message so much as it shows the viewer how one character tries to weather the trauma inflicted upon her. Whether or not she did the right thing is up to each individual viewer.

This film presents many socially and emotionally significant themes, and it is to be commended for the issues it tackles. However, the lacking technical quality of the film (too many overly-dark sequences), and the dragging period between the rape and the counter-rape make this a film that I respected more than I liked.",1363564800,,1112,4.532338308457711

I thought that was done in poor taste by the commentators although probably unintentional. It's just an uneasy subject matter for most people. The deleted scene between the main character and the college professor certainly would change the tone and feel of the entire scene and give even more insight to Dawsons convictions, If the scene had been included, it would have taken the bite out of the professor putting the bullying student in his place.

2940608,2,B000VE4UQA,"After reading all these reviews, Descent (the NC-17 original theatrical version) peaked my interest.  It sounded like a morbid tale of dealing with a traumatic event and taking control of your healing by descending into a punishing, pain-filled, karma-soaked revenge.

The movie seemed to start out with a dark, poetic feel and gave a realistic setting of date rape, although the rapist seemed like a freshman frat-boy from the 80's.  Still, this beginning (the first 30 minutes) seemed quite realistic and I was anxious to watch more.

What the movie offered me after that was a horrible viewing experience, with amateur shading and contrast that at times made the screen covered in darkness.  On more than one occasion I found myself squinting to see if I could make out what was going on.

The plot-it felt like a 3 hour movie was shot, then edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes by chopping random bits and pieces of the original cut.  Besides Rosario Dawson's good acting performance, the plot left you asking ""why did they feel the need to include that scene?""  The script writing seemed unbelievable at crucial parts of the story.  I personally found it difficult to connect with Rosario even though her acting was good.  I attribute this to the script and choppy plot.

The ""eye-popping, jaw-dropping"" ending, as stated by the other reviewers, failed miserably.  I could barely tell what was going on due to the fore mentioned shading and contrast issues, and it ended so abruptly that it instantly made me regret my rental purchase.  The only reason this movie was NC-17 was it showed several brief glimpses of the frat boy's genitalia when he was standing naked and lying naked.

The ultimate revenge that other reviewers spoke of?  Well, I will say that it does make you contemplate the eye for an eye belief.  It somehow seemed forced (no pun intended) at the end from all the actors involved, and the setup to this scene was unbelievable at best.

I gave it 2 stars for Rosario's decent performance and the beginning portrayal of a realistic date-gone-criminally-awry situation.  Stay away from this movie unless your really bored and don't mind not being able to see what's going on for half the movie, especially the ending.

If you want to see an ""eye-popping, jaw-dropping"" experience, try watching Irreversible.

It never ceases to amaze me how different people see different movies in one single film.

And I believe that deep down, what disturbs people the most is the reversal of power roles at the end which puts Maya's jock rapist in his place. Beautifully filmed with a perfect soundtrack, visually-arresting and almost dreamlike even in its most horrifying moments, this film is a very powerful commentary on the politics of beauty, race, intellect, femininity and masculinity.",1322870400,6,647,4.675438596491228

I've really come to appreciate the job of the casting companies too and feel that Chad Faust's casting as the frat boy turned rapist was spot on.  Everyone knows that rape is not about sex but about power.  And of course, down the road we see what a powerless wimp Jared is in the football locker room scene.  But Jared took his rape of Maya a step further in using racial slurs to demean this young woman even further than the rape.  How dare a black woman walk with such pride and dignity, looking past him as though he didn't exist, this white irresistible jock that he perceives himself to be.  His goal was not only to bring her down a peg or two as a woman, but as a black woman as well.  The scene where she is dressing the mannequin that resembles her was actually quietly brilliant.  In the face of the mannequin you saw the light, pride and grace that she once had and that he robbed from her.  She went from a woman holding her head high, to trying to blend into the background and not be seen.  Even her drive to finish her education and make something of herself had been stolen from her.  Jared's lack of remorse and arrogance in the end left him open for the vengeance that she brought him to. Unfortunately, as many people have learned, vengeance really is not as sweet as you think it will be.  I think her tears were for herself.  What one act had turned her life into.  I came away understanding how a woman who really has character could find this type of vengeance hollow, but not feeling sorry for Jared at all.

2940626,4,B000VE4UQA,"As a rape survivor, I have seen many movies that triggered my emotions.  ""The Accused"", for one.  But ""Descent"" offers up an interesting twist on the aftermath of rape.

I'm not a fan of Rosario Dawson.  Her acting seems a bit stiff until the final scene.  But there is something compelling about this movie.  It is not a cinematic masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. Marcus Patrick provides eye candy in a very crude way.  The dialogue is a bit stilted at times.  Yet, it is a movie that haunts you.

Maya is an introverted, studious young woman attending a mostly white college.  She is biracial and this plays an important role in her character's development.  She does not truly consider her racial identity until she is date-raped by a jock, who expresses his desire and hatred for black women while assaulting her.  Maya is then faced with the task of putting her life back together and trying to heal.  She numbs the pain by engaging in a self-destructive lifestyle.  She also plots the ultimate vengeance against her attacker.

""Descent"" is painful.  It is dark and disturbing and powerful.  Like other reviewers have stated, it makes you question the ethics of ""an eye for an eye"".

This film stirred many emotions within me and it made me recall my own trauma, something I have always run away from.  I cheered Maya on but I was also strangely sympathetic towards her rapist.  It is obvious that he is a very weak, cowardly person with low self-esteem.  He lacks control of his own life and raping Maya was a way to gain dominance over someone weaker than himself.  Rape is generally about power, after all.  Jared is simply a little boy trying to assert his masculinity.

""Descent"" makes me think not only about the impact of rape, but also about sexism and racism.  Maya feels out of place at her college but her position in society as a woman of color becomes clear when Jared calls her vile racist epithets while raping her.  I am a biracial woman and the combination of sexual assault and racism brought tears to my eyes.

In all, I can only recommend this movie to viewers with an open mind.  It is better to watch it without expectations.  Just keep an open mind.  It isn't for the faint of heart.",1307577600,28,2225,4.573604060913706

Her recovery is self-imposingly slow. Her thoughts are not apparent as she befriends the club's darkly handsome owner. He exudes sensual strength. It is something she harnesses later in the film but not in the way you might suppose. Ultimately, it is a film about the reopening of her mind. It is a psychological study with a sharp edge.

""Understated"" is not a word you would usually use to describe a rape revenge film, but ""Descent"" is just that. Classic rape revenge films like ""I Spit On Your Grave"" or ""Last House on the Left"" depict women being horrifically brutalized by random strangers. ""Descent"" offers something different ... a disturbingly realistic portrayal of a date rape.

Maya, a bookish, uptight, intellectual college student, is hit on by cocky athlete Jerrod at a party. Her initial instinct is that he's a creep, but he manages to convince her that beneath his frat boy exterior he is actually a sensitive romantic who's been admiring her from afar. Charming as many a sociopath can be, he gets her to consent to dinner, a drink at his place, and a kiss ... then shows his true colors by raping her, all the while calling her racist names under the guise of dirty talk. Apparently, Jerrod enjoys both physically and psychologically destroying his victims.

And destroy her he does. The film doesn't take the easy route showing Maya's trauma. Maya retreats into herself, appearing still and numb while the world goes on around her. She appears to quit school for a while, takes a menial retail job, and starts exploring the world of nightlife, complete with drink, drugs, and casual sex. This part of the film takes on a dreamier, stranger tone, and yet it never plays it as sensationalistic or over the top. Maya is lost and numbing herself, and, like many survivors of sexual trauma or abuse, finding a strange relief in promiscuity.

In the film's final act, Maya appears to be back in school, working in a prestigious TA position, when she is shocked to discover that Jared is one of the students in her class. Since Jerrod is one of those sociopaths too unaware to realize that he's actually a rapist, he agrees to meet Maya at her place, and Maya gets her revenge.

The highlight of the ""revenge"" scene is not really what Maya does to Jerrod, but the monologue she delivers to him before doing it. She talks about all her conflicted feelings: blaming herself for not trusting her first instincts about him and letting him charm her out of her good judgment, the fact that she still has dreams about him where he's a romantic hero before remembering that he's actually a monster. The film's final scene is a closeup of Maya face, a tear streaming down her cheek. The film shows that, despite brutalizing her attacker, Maya is not left triumphant or complete ... just a survivor who chose to dole out vengeance, a very long way from happy.",1297555200,11,2533,4.695945945945946

2940675,1,B000VE4UQA,"An independent film, Descent came out in 2007, starring and produced by Rosario Dawson. Why have the collective We, duh movie-going/renting audience, not heard of this movie considering it stars someone of Ms. Dawson's renown? A damn good reason: It's not very good at all. Maya (Dawson) is an intelligent, shy, introverted, dating/relationship-less college student. We learn this because Maya is on the phone talking to her mom and she ""invents"" a nonexistent beau for her mom's benefit. First off, Ms. Dawson seems--looks--too self-assured (and a little too old, but that's not too big a dealbreaker) to be this doe-eyed character, and we all know that women as beautiful as Dawson are all-too-often in real life these wallflower-ish characters. (To put it a little more plainly, my Inner Guy chortled, ""Yeah, right! Gals that look like her are lonely!"" If you believe that Dawson, who wasn't even nerd-ed down for the role, could be such a character, then you'll likely buy Sandra Bullock as the snorting ugly-duckling FBI agent in Miss Congeniality.) Fast-forward a little: Maya meets Jared (the appropriate-monikered Chad Faust...that's right, Faust), a smug preppie-jock type that might as well be wearing a T-shirt or button saying, ""Smooth-talking Sociopath."" (In horror films, the equivalent: When someone or a group of people are lost on a nasty rainy night, they ask directions from a hunchbacked, clubfooted fellow that looks like Ernest Borgnine with a cleft palette---naturally, they follow his directions and end up with their heads mounted on a demented hillbilly's living room wall.) Maya rebuffs Jared initially, but his ""charms"" wear her down and she goes on what seems like a nice date with him. (It's the ""nice"" ones you have to watch out for. Booga!) As we can see lumbering up Fifth Avenue, Maya is date-raped. (Fade To Black.) Does Maya report him to the police or campus authorities? Does she get counseling? Does she even confide in her (female) best pal?

We never find out. Maya becomes withdrawn. The guys she works with think she's a...well, what else do white good-looking college-age guys say to each other when a lady is withdrawn or distant? (""She's a ______, haw, high-five me, guys!"") Why, they're insensitive jerks, of course! (We're all scum.) Maya takes to hanging out in a shadowy techno/house-driven dance club & begins her initial ""descent"", and...well, it's hard to say what happens. It's hard to say because it's hard to SEE, literally--it's implied Maya gets sucked into an underworld of artsy-fartsy-spooky-kookie types, drugs, and casual (group?) sex, but like many of these clubs, the lighting is low and/or intentionally blurry. Plus we never really see Maya ACTUALLY participating. OK, director/writer Talia Lugacy, lemme get this straight: You'll show your central character getting raped but you won't show her WILLINGLY engaging in acts of drugging & casual sex? She also falls under the ""spell"" of Adrian, a Svengali-like club DJ who's muscularly ripped to Infinity. Unlike Taxi Driver, Descent doesn't believably or compellingly depict Maya's descent into mental/emotional havoc, or, also like Taxi Driver, into an avenging angel. SPOILERS AHEAD. Maya encounters Jared again. She lures him to her boudoir, she chains him to her bed and then has Adrian come in and administer ""payback"" upon Jared in the form of ""up his aisle."" This scene seems to go on forever and is more graphic than Maya's violation. I also got the notion that maxi-stud Adrian was relishing his application of ""justice"" for more than just Maya's sake. The last shot in the movie is a tear falling from Maya's eye (while Adrian and Jared are still ""engaged""), and the downcast look on her face is NOT one of victory or satisfaction.

I may've made Descent seem ""better"" than it is. In suggesting the concept of revenge as ultimately unsatisfying, that a victim could eventually become what s/he despises in their victimizer--in that sense, Descent is a ""success."" As a movie, with Dawson miscast, with zero convincing character development, the gosh-I-wish-I-were-Stanley-Kubrick camera angles, drab lighting, a predictable storyline, the ""white men suck"" conceit (Did I mention Adrian is African-American? Whoo, get that honkie's hiney, Adrian!), trivializing important subjects (date rape and vengeance), and pacing that feels like waiting in line at the Post Office two days before Christmas, Descent is poppycock, err, I mean, arty crap of the lowest order.",1269648000,18,4486,5.19475138121547

Rosario Dawson actually gets justice in this movie. I've never seen anything like it. It's extremely graphic to say the least. She actually rapes the guy who raped her. An eye for an eye, thats what i live by. This movie shows how damaged a rape can leave someone. Even after Rosario gets revenge, you see how truly hurt and broken she is. I actually saw this about 2 years ago and it has stayed with me every since. It's a powerful film. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars was because it's a little to long. And there's this period after she was raped that seems to drag on way to long. However, This is still a wonderful film that i hope many people will take the time to watch.

2940692,2,B000VE4UQA,"As much as I like Rosario Dawson, Descent is not a success for her as a producer and lead actor. It is a date rape revenge drama, but the second act, where she becomes withdrawn, a clothes folder in a boutique by day and a club denizen by night, is a muddle. I couldn't really tell what was going on, except she meets a DJ (Marcus Patrick) who makes his boyfriend smoke a cigarette held in his toes.

She is miscast as an undergraduate, but the project wouldn't have gotten a green light without her star power. She is still attractive but just is no longer the ingenue she once was. Will she get the green light for her next vanity project? I think not, she has squandered her chance. Finally, the ending is too graphic, and there is zero pay off. Charles Bronson built his whole career on revenge sagas--or Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry, which they mention in the interview segment. It is an easy formula, but they reject it. Though it is commendable that they reject the easy formula, they have no formula of their own, easy or complicated, to replace it with. By the time she gets back at her frat boy (Chad Faust) even her character is sick of it all. No closure, no insight, no resolution.

Rosario and the director (Talia Lugacy) wanted to make their statement, with little regard to how a mainstream audience would react. What is that, the Andy Kaufman school of film making? A private joke amongst themselves? If they wanted to get their message out, it should be encapsulated in a film that entertains. No one wants to pay to see a movie that hectors them. This movie would've really hurt Rosario Dawson's acting career, except that no one is going to see it. But it will go on her ""permanent record"" as far as her producer career goes. That's a shame because they had a feminist message that deserves to be heard, but no one wants to be lectured. Even a film about date rape shouldn't be audience rape.

2940693,3,B000VE4UQA,"Descent has got to be one of the slowest movies I've ever seen, but maybe that gives it some extra power it might not have had without those incredibly long drawn out medium shots.  Maya is a college student who's looking for love, and when she meets ballplayer Jared at a party she's intrigued; he really holds her attention.  He has the surface charm that sociopaths learn to mimic from close observation of normal people, but how's a girl supposed to know that?  When she crosses the threshold into his apartment, and sees his trashed living room, she asks if something happened, but he doesn't reply directly, just gives her a heaping glass of wine and tells her to bring it upstairs.  That messy living room should have told her to just go home when the getting was good, but Maya is a bit of a naf and ignores the signs that the audience never does.

Rosario Dawson is beautiful and talented, and her portrayal of Maya both before and after Jared attacks her is nothing short of breathtaking, but the problem is that there really isn't anything for her to play with.  There are some amusing scenes set in the high-fashion boutique Maya takes a job in, where a snooty Sloane Ranger teaches her how to fold expensive blouses for better presentation (""loose--give them some air""), but by this time Maya is incapable of doing anything but looking woebegone and numb.  About this time it dawned on me where I had seen this character arc before--in Rent, of course, in which Rosario Dawson played Mimi, first as a warm, loving spirit, then as a drugged out zombie with zero emotional range.  I have to say that Rent did it better, and maybe Descent with musical numbers would have made it more lively.  I don't know.  The whole film is set up solely to deliver to Jared what he has laid on Maya, and the cat and mouse game she plays with him is suspenseful up to a point.

This is the second film I've seen in a month's time in which the superjock guy is humbled by the invasion of his most private of parts.  (The last was ""Playroom."")  This must be a trend in the making, perhaps inspired by what happened to Seann William Scott and his nurse in ""Road Trip.""  And of course, to way back when, the notorious Rusty Godowsky rape scene in ""Myra Breckinridge.""  That film was a mess, but it had more spirit than the listless, if well-meant, ""Descent.""",1226880000,2,2349,4.4941176470588236
2940694,3,B000VE4UQA,"This is a powerful, vivid and depressing story about a college student (Rosario Dawson) who is brutally date raped by a football jock (Chad Faust), then goes into a self-destructive state of depression, only to emerge from that void in order to extract an even more brutal revenge on her rapist.

Ms. Dawson and Faust deliver convincing performances and co-writer (with Brian Priest) and director Talia Lugacy attempts to deliver an important message about how violence can destroy the human soul.  However, Ms. Lugacy needs to learn an important basic lesson about storytelling: ""Less Is More"".

There is not one sequence in the movie that would not have benefitted from being cut in half.  Scenes that could have made their point in the first ten seconds seem to go on endlessly.  Indeed, there was one point, about halfway through the picture, where I got so bored that I jumped to the next chapter stop, so that I could get on with the story.  Later, after the picture was over, I went back to see if I'd missed anything important.  I hadn't.

In the future, I would suggest that director Lugacy not only light her scenes so that the audience can see what is happening on screen, but also work with an editor who can convince her that every shot in a film is not ""sacred"".

I am not a woman and have no idea how a woman would feel after such an ordeal and this movie did not make me any more empathetic.

2940698,4,B000VE4UQA,"Mya (Rosario Dawson) is a somewhat reclusive college student who doesn't really have interaction with many men.  She's so reserved that her parents have begun to worry about her.  At one early point in the movie it appears that Mya may even have some thoughts of exploring homosexuality.

I can't go further without mentioning the fact that Rosario Dawson is compelling in her performance, morphing from innocent to wrecked, and eventually to psycho-sexual yet confused strength.

Anyway, Jared is a goofy looking, cookie eating, frat-boy with stalker tendencies.  He has an atrociously borderline mullet, the skull structure reminiscent of a sketch after an alien abduction, the most horribly pretentious pickup lines in history, advances more awkward than a WNBA player walking in high-heels, and an agenda so obvious that it can be from Jupiter.

It's only a matter of time before Jared's polished routine manages to convince a nave Mya into the frat's basement.  How she didn't perceive his creepiness, which jumped off the screen the minute his opening credits rolled, is beyond me.  However, he was somehow seductive enough to get her to engage in some kissing.  When Mya wanted it to end, Jared didn't, and he raped her.  Many may feel the scene is somewhat weak, or not brutal enough for a rape scene, but it's quite possible for someone to simply go catatonic during a traumatic experience, and there is a point at which even the strongest mind gives up fighting.

Afterwards Mya is psychologically destroyed, going throughout her graduation and daily life like Jodie Foster from Nell.  At night, however, she's the polar opposite, and looking for satisfaction, understanding, and healing through alcohol, drugs, and promiscuity.  In this lifestyle, she begins to take pleasure dominating others - mentally, physically, and sexually.

It is only when she has gained full control of her emotions that she can trule overcome her anguish, gain her inner strength, and find the resolution for which she's been searching.  The final chilling sequence is jaw-dropping, and I didn't know whether to cheer or gasp.  It's truly risque, and challenges the viewer to decide whether the old ""eye for an eye"" adage has any merit.",1209945600,63,2225,5.104972375690608
