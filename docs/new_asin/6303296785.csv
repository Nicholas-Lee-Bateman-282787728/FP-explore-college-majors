618822,5,6303296785,"I was new to yoga when I first started with this tape and now I'm hooked! Everything is explained clearly, you're taught how to breathe and the movements are done in a well-paced series that feel natural and  comfortable. I felt great within a month of using this tape and I saw my  body get into better shape. Once you've gone past the beginner's stage,  there are suggestions for advanced movements to challenge your mind and  body. I would love to find out if Tracey Rich/ Ganga White have made more  yoga tapes.",963619200,5,515,4.494623655913978
618823,5,6303296785,"This is the first yoga video I ever purchased. It is not filmed at sunrise in some tropical locale, but it is my favorite yoga video, bar-none. I have purchased several videos since this one, and invariably I always come back  to Total Yoga. So many of the yoga videos I have do not really focus on  or  teach breathing techniques, which are SO important in yoga. Tracey Rich  begins by teaching ujjayi complete (3-part) breathing, which is something  that few videos teach. The tape also includes the relaxation pose (corpse  pose) at the end, in which Tracey guides you through the feel of the pose.  So many other videos leave this pose out completely, or mention the pose in  passing at the end. This is unfortunate because this pose is important for  balancing the body.
 The Total Yoga workout is wonderful, I think. It  concentrates on uniting the body and breath -- Tracey is explicit about  when to inhale and exhale, and she also reminds you constantly to keep up  the ujjayi complete breath. It is a meditative workout without a lot of  extraneous chattering. It seems a bit challenging at first (as a beginner),  but if you keep trying, you'll get it. If you want a meditative yet  challenging yoga video, without a lot of needless fluff, I recommend this  one.",956102400,27,1273,4.63677130044843
618824,5,6303296785,"As an dancer- it alarms me that people buy  tapes and attempt them on their own-having never had any yoga instruction- proper alignment is difficult to learn via video- no matter how great the instructor- without  this knowledge you can really hurt yourself- at any rate- Total Yoga is a  welcome change to many of the yoga tapes I have seen as the poses flow into  each other- and you are not left bored and  awkwardly waiting while what  seems to be needless chatting goes on - in a live class these breaks can be  fundamental as you learn as your instructor verbally and physically  repositions you and your classmates-but I find this does not often  translate well into the videos which  are geared more for practice and  maintenance as opposed to a live class enviornment which should nurture  growth-  again, the style of this video is  grande if you have the basic  knowledge to execute the poses without hurting the body- I sometimes like  to hold the poses a bit longer- but it is possible to ""lag""  behind in this video and still stay with the program- I wish that Rich and  White would create a more advanced video instruction- but this tape does  have a few inserts where White demonstrates alternative advanced poses to  Rich's poses-it would be nice if there was more of this so you could  ""grow"" further with the tape- It is hard to know what videos to  buy- but really- you can't go wrong with Total Yoga- as a beginner you can  grow into it- and as you get more flexibility you will grow with it- it is  not  a video you will work with a few times and discard-Total Yoga supplies  exactly what a yoga video should-",948326400,31,1631,4.462585034013605
618825,5,6303296785,"This was the first introduction I ever had to yoga and it's awesome. I watched the whole video first, then I did it in steps, going a little further each day.  I am 50 years young and have never been this flexible or  strong.  It is a form of mental and physical exercise that a person can do  throughout their lifetime. I can't explain why, but it brings such  strength, flexibility and relaxation all at the same time!  My friend's  mother has been doing yoga for years to stave off the stiffness of age.  She has no trouble doing the plow shoulder stand and she is 74 years of  age.  I intend to follow her example!",946425600,7,618,4.25

618898,5,6303296785,"I have done other yoga workouts seeking that feeling of inner peace that everyone talks about, and never experienced it until now. This one left me feeling groovy the first time through. Good for beginners as it explains different benefits of each pose (I like that) and gives a lesson in breathing at the beginning. I use yoga as part of my fitness regimen that includes aerobics, weight training and flexibility exercise, so at 70 minutes in length, this tape can be broken up for use as end-of-workout stretch or do the entire routine for your day's workout (includes some good ab exercises too). Also appreciate the no-gimmics approach.",1049760000,4,640,4.8807339449541285
618899,5,6303296785,"This video was my first introduction to yoga several years ago.  It can be difficult as a beginner, but who said yoga was easy?  Yoga is still exercise.  I've tried several different ""yoga for the masses"" videos since, and keep going back to this one.  While other videos gloss over the importance of proper breathing, this one spends time showing, in the beginning, and reminding, during the practice, three-part breathing.  I find the reminders the most beneficial, because when you're in a sholder stand you do sometimes forget to breath completly.  It provides a comprehensive workout at any level of experience.  While one instructor does basic poses, the other one shows and explains more advanced ones.  Even if you can't do the advanced poses yet, it's nice to see what is attainable.  Also, in this video, the narrator explains how poses help your body and which body systems the poses effect.  I find this beneficial, if for no other reason than curiosity.  This is the best yoga video I've found thus far.  My only complaint, not available in DVD.",1049068800,5,1058,4.849162011173185
618900,4,6303296785,"I think this is a great video, but only if you've been to at least several yoga classes.  It is not that the video is difficult, but I think it's more valuable if you've had an actual instructor show you how to breathe and pose correctly.
The reason why I like this video so much is because it's almost like going to my studio.  It does require that you set aside some time; a little over an hour for the practice.  The flow of poses is also very nice.
Regimen:  We start with breathing exercises that show you how to breathe.  Breathing is emphasized as you move from pose-to-pose.  Then we move into the sun salutations (Vinyasa), supine poses, standing poses, forward bends, back bends and inversions (shoulder stand).  The thing I love the most has to be the full-length Savasana (corpse pose... kinda like a nap!) at the end of practice.  In some videos (Denise Austin, Rodney Yee, and others) there is no Savasana or a really short Savasana where you don't feel too rested and, before you know it, the VCR is making loud rewinding noises and you have to get up before the TV kicks in.  The Savasana in this video is about 10 minutes and very restful.  I usually fall asleep, which is a nice reward for practicing yoga!
One of my criticisms of this video is that some of the modified poses are not offered until you've already done the pose on one side.  Also, most of the modified poses are poses for advanced students.  A benefit of already attending a yoga class is that you can determine your own modifications and how much you want to ""get into the pose.""
If you do decide to buy this video, you definitely will need a sticky mat.  I also recommend that you have a folded blanket nearby for neck support during shoulder stand, and for warmth during Savasana.  You may need a strap (a belt is OK) for some poses such as the ""Pose of Nobility.""  For the practice, you should have a space large enough to do a snow angel in.
All in all, I think this is a great video and is a nice substitute/complement to going to a studio if you've already been to a few yoga classes.",1044748800,7,2076,4.355844155844156
618901,5,6303296785,"This was the first Yoga video I've done, actually it is what first got me into doing Yoga.
Of all of the different Vinyasa (flow) series out there, this one encompasses many of the most fundamental asanas in all of Yoga. It thoroughly explains how to do each posture as it also shows alterations which make the postures less strenuous or more challenging to fit your level of practice. It's easy enough for a beginner, but challenging enough for the advanced practicioner, as all of these postures take time to master.
The sequencing of the postures is very flowing and balanced in the way it first warms up the body before moving into the more difficult postures and moves the body back into relaxation as the video ends, providing a balanced workout all the way through.
I haven't tried many other videos, but if you're looking for an effective hour long routine, that's easy enough for a beginner but challenging enough to test your limits, and give you a complete balanced workout, this is certainly one of the best out there...",1026172800,12,1032,4.707182320441989
618902,5,6303296785,"this is a brilliant video. I had absolutely no Yoga experience when I first purchased it, but found it very easy to follow along with. The program is nicely designed with smoothly changing movements. After just one week of daily practice, I found myself considerably more flexible, and feeling physically better all around. The program mixes strength and flexibility challenges seamlessly. I would(and do!)recommend this to anyone. I am anxious to try the newer videos in the series.
--updated--
after a few years of yoga practice, I would like to add that the Living Arts series(specifically the Total Yoga series) is still, in my humble opinion, the best yoga videos I have seen. Now that yoga is becoming more popular, ther are a lot of crap videos floating around out there; which is a shame to think that someone may write off this ancient eastern practice b/c of some yahoo trying to make a buck off the ""hot new fitness trend.""",1025481600,2,934,4.807453416149069
618903,5,6303296785,"I originally reviewed this wonderful program in June 2002. Since then I have continued to practice daily and because I like variety in my practice, I've gradually amassed over 80 yoga DVD's and VHS's (which is not as insane or expensive as it sounds since a lot of them came in packs of 3 or 5 :)). That being said, I just did this program this morning and thought I'd share my updated point of view. Well, even after all these years it still stands up as a fabulous and well rounded practice!

If I was to compare it to the ""Flow Series"" programs in terms of difficulty, I'd say it's perhaps similar in terms of level to the ""Water"" program, though it does have a more intense inversion section with a long ""Plow"" and ""Shoulderstand"".

  Someone brand new to yoga would probably be better off starting with something like Yoga Zone's ""Yoga Basics"" (in fact I would recommend getting either their ""Yoga Basics Five Pack"" or ""Ultimate Collection"" which is a six DVD set. Each of the DVD's in either collection have two-twenty minute self contained programs.

 At that point you can easily move into Total Yoga's Flow Series ""Earth"" program and then maybe the ""Water"" program before this one because it has a half shoulderstand rather than a full version of that pose, that would be a good preparation for this.

 Either way, I've written out the sequence and thought this might help those interested in seeing exactly how this program is put together.

618904,4,6303296785,"Although the blurb on the tape indicates that this is appropriate ""for anyone,"" I don't think it would be appropriate for most people who have never done yoga before.  There is no discussion of proper body alignment (though Tracey Rich certainly demonstrates admirable positioning herself), the only modifications provided are for people who are more advanced (which is not the likely to be the largest audience for this or any other yoga tape), and the pace is basically breakneck.  Most teachers will tell you that yoga is to be done with the breath, and doing the ujjayi breathing that is taught at the beginning of this tape tends to slow and deepen the breath... However, Ms. Rich whips through the movements at a frenetic pace that has never left me time to do the asanas with proper care.  I find that I have to do this tape with the remote at hand to stop the program frequently so that I can do the movements at a pace appropriate for me.
If you want an aerobic routine, this might be the ticket due to the speed of the instruction.  If you are brand-new to yoga, this tape may be quite frustrating due to the pace and lack of true beginner-level guidance.  If you have done yoga for awhile and have a good grasp of proper alignment, this program can provide a moderate challenge (again, mostly due to the speed, rather than the difficulty of the asanas).
While this is a great tape, I just don't think it is a good choice for *most* beginners.  Although many reviewers seem to find the Yoga Journal tapes ""too slow,"" they are a much better intro and provide more guidance for proper alignment, modifications, etc.
Incidentally, I agree with other reviewers' comments about the clean, plain set.  I don't mind the exotic locales in most tapes, but they don't exactly provide the viewer any real benefit.  Tracey Rich's ramrod-straight bearing and slightly cranky expression seem very businesslike, in contrast with the often woozy/dreamy vibe put out by most video yogis.  And it's not a negative, just a comment, but Ms. Rich is wearing more makeup in this video than I've ever seen in any other yoga video or in a live class!
Overall, a good tape for people with a well-integrated sense of proper alignment and at least some yoga experience.",1022803200,,2252,4.666666666666667
618905,5,6303296785,"But attainable, just be prepared to scramble up in an undignified manner.... she/we do back rolls and then she rolls straight up to her feet - huh!  i can't imagine when I shall progress to that.  But that's ok, you just get up in your own way and continue following a great workout.  Thorough, balanced workout, detailed instruction, covers all the bases, excellent relaxation ending with her bringing you out - no white noise! - what more does one want?  Yes, this is a keeper.  one lovely hour.",1015804800,11,497,4.6022727272727275
618906,3,6303296785,"I, too, am a yoga beginner and found this tape difficult to complete. While exercises were not as challenging as I imagined (but then again, perhaps I was not doing them right?), I found the pace of the video to be way too fast. From the moment the video started, I felt as if I was ""zooming"" through, and I do not think that the yoga workout was meant to be like that. The narration is useful if you are already familiar with the poses. I also found myself wondering about my form, a more detailed explanation would have been helpful. On the positive note: No Fluff, No Sugary Slogans, No Colorful Backgrounds, Just Yoga. I think I will be returning to this tape after taking at least a month of teacher-led classes.",1012867200,2,717,4.398496240601504
618965,5,6303296785,"I recently started practicing yoga, and this is the first video that I bought.  I found the instructor to be very good at explaining the poses and the moves throughout the routine.  In addition, I found the poses challenging, but not intimidating.  The exercises leave me feeling revived, more flexible and stronger.  In addition, I have lower back problems, and every time I start to feel back pain, I do this routine and immediately feel better.  I would highly recommend this tape for a beginner or intermediate student.",1006819200,4,523,4.8977272727272725
618966,3,6303296785,"I bought this tape because all the reviews said it was a tape definately not for beginners. I have been practicing yoga for a few months and wanted a step up. If you are intermediate, it's a good tape, about 4-5 stars. Shortcomings at the intermediate level would be sounding a bit military at times and not enough time showing the ""for those more flexible"" poses. I really loved the variations explored in some of the sun salutation series, rather than doing 5 of the exact same thing. Another super feature is that they explain what many of the moves do for the body (aligns this, opens that, relaxes the other thing...) and that was of particular interest and value to me.
But being that is labeled for beginners, I would rate it only 1-2 stars. My husband, who is real beginner, quit 3/4 through the tape. This tape includes moves like shoulder stands which I don't consider beginner moves. Even the beginner moves that are used, sometimes are not explained until 3/4 into the tape. Leaving timid newcomers exasperated.
So on average it was a 3. We will use this tape for a change of pace, but for now we'll stick with our other beginner tapes.",1000425600,11,1148,4.550724637681159
618967,5,6303296785,"Of all my yoga tapes (and yes, I have many), this is my all time favorite. When I complete the hour long segment, I feel transformed physically, mentally and spiritually. The tape begins with a sitting meditation focused on the breath then works on gentle back stretches before moving into vinyasas. These stretches are rather rigorous and, if used with the breathing technique outlined at the beginning, lead to a deep release of tension. Upon completing the flow series, she completes the workout with back twists, the shoulder stand and the corpse pose. Yoga is as challenging as the person performing it; in this way, the reviewer who said it was not diffiicult enough was not releasing into the poses as deeply as s/he could have. In fact, I would say this tape is not great for the absolute beginner because one of the asanas (the shoulder stand), if done improperly, can be extremely damaging to the neck vertebrae. Overall, I'd say for those with a passing knowledge of yoga and the desire to lose massive stored up stress/ tension, this is an ideal tape!",998870400,6,1063,4.751351351351351
618968,3,6303296785,"After taking a few yoga classes I bought this video. I found the video too fast paced and could not keep up.  I did not have enough time to move from one position to the next... I don't believe enough enough time is given for proper positioning of the poses either. I think this tape would be better for someone who was more advanced,with a background in yoga. But it's not for the beginner.",998524800,,391,4.283783783783784

""Complete Yoga"" was the perfect choice.  Intelligent, informative and challenging - at the same time, gentle and adaptable for all skill levels.

618973,5,6303296785,Although [one] review says not really for beginners. I thought it was an excellent place to start if you have exercised in other ways. If you have very little flexibility you might need something easier. The explainations are very clear even if you have no experience and breathing is emphasized. There is plenty of challenge as you become stronger and more flexible. The only thing I found slightly frustrating is that there are no intermediate explainations in the way you work between beginning and advanced poses. I don't have any class experience which would probably cover things like that. But I have 4 Yoga tapes and the others collect dust as I always come back to this one.,971913600,,683,4.796610169491525

I've bought perhaps a half-dozen other yoga videos and never even watched them more than a couple times, always preferring this one.  In high school, I let someone borrow it and never saw it again.  Luckily, though, I had dubbed an audio recording of it, and could then practice anywhere I could bring a portable stereo.  And I did.

Through college, and several subsequent moves, I always practiced with that old ratty tape.  After being pregnant with my first child, I was ecstatic to find it again, and begin practicing again, but it was too old and crumpled to be used anymore.  Unfortunately, it had been ages since I'd seen the original VHS tape, and couldn't remember what it was called or even the names of the people involved.

But here it is, after just a short search.  (I would have bought another copy years ago if I'd known it was going to be that easy!)

The biggest problem with this - and it was a big one for me - is that the tape goes logically from a less to more strenuous workout but, at 70 minutes total, there is no clear way to break the workout up.  Other tapes will maybe put 3 20-minute workouts on one, so that you can do one, two or all three workouts and customize it for yourself.  Not the case with this one, and that's a pain.  What it means is, if you don't have over an hour to workout, you will have to just stop the tape, interrupting any sort of flow and progression.  Frustrating!",1109548800,3,815,4.328947368421052
