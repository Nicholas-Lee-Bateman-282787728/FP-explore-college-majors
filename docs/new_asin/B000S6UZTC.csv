8204637,5,B000S6UZTC,"I couldn't help but feel, as a subtext this film explores White people's obsessions with Blacks. Perhaps they should be afraid of them. They will certainly never win a struggle for dominance with them.

This is a great film, even without being, perhaps, at least at times, subtly creepy, and being quite so at the end. The late Roger Ebert noted that it is a fine film in itself, outside of a psychology professor who speaks directly to the audience, and the scenes from old films that occasionally mirror the action of the modern actors onscreen. These cut-ins certainly make the film more interesting, and more educational, perhaps even more poignant. Were those scenes taken from old movies, or were modern actors being filmed in an old black and white and perhaps silent film style? I would guess these were real films from another age, although, in at least one cut-in, it looks like an actor in the film appears in the old reel?

There was an odd point towards the end of the film, where the politician's mistress, or the mistress he rejects, appears in a position of power, seeming to be the boss of the textile managers, manager. It came quite suddenly and this wasn't explained. It did provide (her being passed over in favor of the original wife) an explanation for her sympathy towards the textile manager. It may have been some kind of female-guilt, placed into the movie. That's something I'm not sure I've ever noticed before, living in the USA, a fictional program promoting female-guilt.

I think this film subtly delves into politics. The filmmakers seem to suggest that 'free trade' and the compromises of 'the high-tech global economy' are harmful to people. It is at least within the realm of possibility there is also criticism being cast upon the larger reality of industrialization.

Personally, I feel this is a great film, even if it does become somewhat exploitative towards the end. Even the subtitles work. They almost make the film seem interactive.",1487376000,,1978,4.84319526627219

8204640,5,B000S6UZTC,"This film is a masterpiece, Mon oncle d'Amerique, Alain Renais directed a movie faithful to the scientist's work, the use of archive footage in the middle of the movie brings it a level of warmth that makes up for some of the coolness in the other parts of the film. Henri Laborit uses three people to discuss theories of survival, competition, rewards and anxiety. Rene is a manager of textiles who faces corporate downsizing, Janine an actress having an affair, and Jean who is a writer and politician.

It's perfect and cannot compare to other movies in the genre, it is parlayed into narrative episodes and odes where the chorus, in this case psychologist Laborit, explains the meaning of the episodes, it makes clear the pretenance to everyday life of a discourse which is very rich as an interpretation of life, in exactly Matthew Arnold's sense, but at the same time so abstract that most people just, for example, reading Laborit's ""Decoding the human message"" would not see the immediate relevance of what was being said to their own daily concerns.

I plan on using this in a class to showcase psychology alongside language development.
In the film, we cut from scenes of the human characters involved in various relationships to Laborit showing how lab rats react to stress under various conditions. The result is not dry or pedantic but funny as hell. It comes off as the rats doing a low burlesque of the human comedy. We also see the characters as children and as adults and scenes from various formative episodes along the way. We see one character as a tiny girl interacting with her factory worker father. He is a communist and he is teaching his newly articualte baby girl to repeat after him ""USA go home"".

It's impossible to compare to other movies of this genre, it really is a masterpiece and will hold the attention. Recommend.
