The plot of this one is not new..  a courtroom murder trial.. yawn yawn !!!  But the cast is good !  Young William Shatner, Martin Balsam, McQueen..  McQueen has a very agitated youthfulness about him in this one.  His real name is Terrence Steven McQueen, and he died of cancer as a result of working with asbestos when he was young.  The main appeal of this one is the cast, not the plot, although if you like stuff like L.A. Law or such, you would like this.  Martin Balsam also played in the ""Taking of Pelham 1-2-3"" another favorite because I also like Robert Shaw, who had 10 children and died of a heart attack at age 50.
  Not to reveal any punchlines, but McQueen is a butcher's delivery boy accused of murdering a psychiatrist's wife.  Pretty good start, eh ?  It is an old TV show, and the film editing is primitive, but the clincher at the end is well done.",1005868800,4,991,4.286486486486487
