2855859,3,B000R20164,"Luckily I was able to catch this on HBO OnDemand one boring Saturday morning, expecting the typical HBO greatness and grittiness.

While long, this movie is hardly epic. That is not to say it is terrible, either. There are plenty of redeeming features with regards to acting, costumes, etc.

Like with any modern PC depiction of Native Americans, the conflict is strenuous, painful, and always the same way. Traditionalism vs Modernism, the almost childlike stubbornness of the Natives to live in their homelands in peace, versus the cold, inevitable need to expand of a young nation with the world in front of them to be conquered. It is always an inability for these two to adapt with one another that leads to the conflict at hand.

At the center of the conflict is Sitting Bull, the chief of the Lakota tribe, resisting US expansion. On the other side is Henry Dawes, a Senator struggling fiercly against anti-Indian sentiment in the US after the slaughter of General Custer and his troops at Little Big Horn to try and resolve the conflicts between the tribes and the U.S.

The other story involves Ohiyesa, an Indian boy whose father converts to Christianity and becomes anglicized, taking his son with him, where he becomes Charles Eastman, and the shining star of hope to Henry Dawes and his faction that the natives are not savages, and can be civilized.

Eastman, however, cannot forget his roots, and still has hateful memories of his time in school, Ohiyesa forced to accept a Christian name or else not be called upon or allowed to pass. His story branches out with a sympathizing woman, lamely acted by Anna Paquin, who later marries him. The both of them work to help Natives on reservations, specifically with medicine and medical help.

Sitting Bull, meanwhile, sees that his land is lost, and leads the remnants of his tribe to Canada, where the Canadians graciously grant them land to live on, so long as they abide by ground rules, and tolerate the presence of their ancestral rivals. They cannot, and so the tribe forces Sitting Bull to bring them back home, where they settle in to reservation life.

The story is known from here, and I won't go on about it. While the story was a good one and well acted, it fell victim to a sort of reverse-stereotyping that Native Americans suffered a hundred years ago and more, depicted as godless savages. The Americans are depicted as sleazy, uncaring, selfish men who don't care at all for the plight of the Natives, and see them all as simply a pest infection that cannot be solved via extermination. Even Henry Dawes, the Senator risking everything to help the Natives, is gradually revealed as a sleazy self-serving hypocrite who cares only for advancing his career with controversial legislation.

As the Americans are hellspawn sent to ravage the earth, the Natives are the helpless victims with only good in their hearts and nature in their souls. No tribal leaders seek violence against the White men, none think of exacting vengeance against individuals, and none seek to harm anyone anywhere for any reason. The Natives gathered at Wounded Knee are simply praying. Sitting Bull is simply befuddled and confused as to why he's being taken away from his home.

All of this leads to a rather clumsily delivered conclusion, in which Sitting Bull is shot in a scene because the Americans felt like shooting someone in the confusion, and the massacre at Wounded Knee for pretty much the same reason.

Eastman's story isn't at all resolved, as he leaves his white wife to go and find himself, in the midst of a hellish job of trying to re-name all the Natives in reservations to anglicized names.

I cannot judge the novel, as I haven't read it, and wouldn't know if this was a faithful adaptation of it, but I feel that overall, this was a clumsily executed attempt at an epic. A true example of the popular phrase about shooting for the stars, and at least ending up somewhere high. This was a good movie, but not great. And certainly not as epic as it attempts to be.",1189555200,12,4035,4.733618233618234
2855860,4,B000R20164,"HBO's ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" is not a mini-series; in fact, it only covers the last two chapters of Brown's book and runs a little over two hours. The film would have been better titled,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Days-of-the-Sioux-Nation-Second-Edition/dp/0300103166/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Days of the Sioux Nation: Second Edition</a>

There are many historical inaccuracies in this film; some are big, and some are small. Director Yves Simoneau recounts the story of reservation life, the taking of Indian lands and the debate that ensued. Choosing drama, as opposed to a documentary style, to recount these subjects is most challenging. When one looks past the inaccuracies in ""Wounded Knee"", one will discover many moments of brilliance.

So, let us undo some of the most important snafus first:

* The film opens with a young Ohiyesa -- Charles Eastman living in the village at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Eastman was never there.
* Sitting Bull physically lashes his men for attempting to flee Canada for their old homeland. This was never the case. Sitting Bull did use the akicita (similar to law enforcement officers) to keep people from leaving Canada. The film accurately portrays why Sitting Bull took the actions he did.
* Sitting Bull surrenders at Standing Rock instead of Ft. Buford.
* Charles Eastman was not the right-hand man to Dawes in developing what would later become the Dawes Act.

""Wounded Knee"" indeed seems to be two films. The first covers the latter years of Sitting Bull's (August Schellenberg) life which are filled with triumph and defeat, greatness and loneliness. The second involves the rescue of a culture gasping its last breath. Trying to resuscitate it are Senator Henry Dawes (Aidan Quinn) and Charles Eastman (Adam Beach) through the building of the Dawes Act that ensures every Indian family would own 160 acres of land.

The first film centers on Sitting Bull, a defeated chief of the Lakota, and one of the most convincing American Indian characters ever shaped for a film. He is a complete enigma. He fights to protect his people, yet he lashes warriors for fleeing Canada to their homeland in the Dakotas. He criticizes other Indian leaders for accepting the white man's way of life, yet he sells his autograph and photo. Sitting Bull's redemption is intended to be shown in one dramatic scene where he confronts the Dawe Commission. ""You may say they wish to give us land. But, here is the truth. Each patch is for a man and all generations that follow. They know that this land cannot feed but one generation, not even so much as that..."" He continues his speech which will shock and surprise many viewers. In the end, Sitting Bull's oration becomes his death warrant.

Film two follows the life of Eastman. When he is 15 years old, his father Jacob (Wayne Charles Baker) takes Eastman back from the roaming Santee bands. Eastman is confused from his father's acceptance of Christianity and his singing of hymns. For me, one of the most notable scenes occurs when Eastman must leave his father to begin yet another new life. As Eastman looks out the window of his slowly moving train, his father waves goodbye and begins to sing a hymn. The emotions are exceedingly powerful; the hymn develops into an Indian strong-heart song as he waves goodbye to his son for the last time. Eastman eventually becomes the agency physician at Pine Ridge where he meets Elaine Goodale (Anna Paquin) and they become fast friends. However, the Beach character is filled with conflict in one of his best performances. Living again among his people, Eastman questions what he has become.

From these doubts, the film chronicles perfectly Eastman and Dawe's collapsing relationship. Through the first two acts, they share the enthusiasm of great dreams and aspirations on how they intend to save the American Indian. They become like father and son. But, they finally reach an impasse in a scene that exudes much sadness.

In the middle of this complex storyline comes a moment of elegance in the only scene involving Wovoka (Studi). With ballet like movements, the Studi character brings his message of the Ghost Dance to the Lakota people. As he articulates his vision in words, he accompanies them with Plains Indian sign language while his body gracefully moves before the crowd.  Wovoka's message is simple: If the Lakota people believe his vision and learn the Ghost Dance, the Great Spirit will rid the earth of the white man, return the buffalo to their full glory, and give back to the Lakota their old way of life. It is the strangest irony of this film: from such promise the Lakota people feel happiness again, but all they receive is death.

""Wounded Knee"" gives us two great scenes that connect the two films together. The first is the death of Sitting Bull never told before with such accuracy in any other film. This scene over any other still haunts me. The film then transports us to the second climatic scene, which is the Battle of Wounded Knee. Yes, it was a battle; there was fierce hand-to-hand combat, and it ended in a slaughter. The movie vividly portrays the tension leading up to the battle, its fight, and its massacre, but fails in its explanation why. The movie attempts to explain as when Col. James Forsyth (Marty Antonini) says to Eastman, ""We didn't fire first. I swear to all-mighty God, we did not fire first."" I still wish the film explained further.

That lack of explanation does not diminish from the greatness of this movie. It is truly courageous in the tale movie producers have, until now, been afraid to touch. For the first time we have a Western movie that is concerned with both sides. With its intelligent script, strong direction, and powerful acting, ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" grasps the concept of the last days of the Lakota nation wholly; at times brutal, but the movie still exhibits warmth and passion.",1186531200,198,5979,4.951146560319043
2855861,5,B000R20164,I really enjoyed this movie on HBO.  Years ago I read the book. I thought the movie really put the key points into as much time as they had.  I recently found out I am a decendant of Ten Bears so this movie really got to me.

2855862,5,B000R20164,"When I heard this movie was coming to HBO I knew it was going to be a good movie. It tells of the many conflicts the Sioux Nation had with the white man while trying to survive. The actors were fanominal. They played off of eachothers emotions and situations extremely well. Especially Adam Beach's character who does a complete 360 when he realizes the way his people is actually being treated.

The director portrayed the history well. From the battle at Little Big Horn to the senseless massacre at Wounded Knee. I had tears in my eyes from watching the massacre. Kudos to the director for protraying the history correctly.

It is out of all my backgrounds; Irish, French, Native American, Black, Chinese, and German; that I am proud to say that I feel more attacted to my Native American and Irish heritage. But mainly my Native American ancestory. More so with the past 500 years of history that we had to endure.

For those who complain about their ""civil rights"" being violated, I dare you to sit down and watch this movie from start to the end of the credits. And complain about your rights. This movie shows how the white man made promises and promises to the Sioux but broke them.

2855863,5,B000R20164,"""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" powerfully portrays the usual diabolical motives and savage behavior of the European Americans, this time in the massacre of 200 Indigenous Sioux at Wounded Knee in South Dakota in 1890. A very realistic feeling of that somber historical period was imbued by the talented cast and the skillful director who kept the feeling tone of the production so authentic that it left me tearful.

Watching ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" enables one to make painful parallels to the holocaust that was perpetrated against the enslaved Africans in America, the Indigenous Americans, and the atrocities that continue to be perpetrated by the European Americans around the world. That being said, there is a heavy karmic debt that inevitably...... will be paid.

The film in addition to leaving me tearful, left me wanting to read the book.

It is about hatreds and prejudices and narrow-mindedness and greed and thoughtlessness affecting Native American men, but the filmmakers were too narrow-minded to see their own prejudices.  It is about 1 hour and 50 minutes into the movie before an unnamed Narive American woman has a speaking line.  Woman are only occasionally present in the background in other scenes.  So the filmmakers are no better than the people they portray.

Anna Paquin, a white woman, is the only named female oher than her character's mother, who appears for about ten seconds.

Oddly, you would expect the disaster at Wounded Knee would be a major part of this movie, but oddly, it's shown in flashback as a wounded man tells what happened.  It is not very dramatic and does not have much of an impact.

This movie was very well created and very honest. Native culture is not perfect and never was. It was just not insane...and the white government continues to show that it is severely unbalanced. Now if there will be one made as such an honest portrayal of the insane megalomaniac known as Custer, at least some of the real history will be known and maybe the current court cases would change.

I would not recommend it to younger children as it is very graphic, however, I feel that this is what brings the movie out and is more reality based. It took place to begin with at Cedar Creek Valley, Dakota on October 21, 1876 in the Dakota Territory. This place was also known as the Black Hills where there was gold was gold found. The Native Americans and the White men fought over the land because the Native Americans claimed it and the Europeans or the French white en want to take it over The fight began and what is known as the, Battle of Little Big Horn, and the white men won and ran the Native American Indians off and they even burnt their teepees down to be mean and cruel to the Native Americans so they would not come back. Some Native Americans were sent off to schools were they were to be taught Christianity and about the Holy Bible. They were forced to be taught about the teachings and were made to take a Christian name from Christian Americans instead of using their Indian names which usually were a sacred name to them. The Native Americans traveled to Canada and the Canadians were so kind to them and allowed the Native Americans to settle on their land and even gave them food and clothing. When the Native Americans began settling down in the different land, the children began getting sick with colds and viruses due to the change in climate and temperature compared to the reservations they were used too and they also caught them from the Canadians. Some of the Native American Indians began to separate and this is where the various tribes came about. When the tribes split they become accustomed to the various religions where they settled. Most became Christians and practiced Christian religions and other kept their Native American faith and continued to believe in the Great Spirits and they also continued to perform Rain Dance Ceremonies and the Ghost Dance. The Ghost dance was believed to usher in the destruction and rebirth of the world and then the dead ancestors would return. (The History of Native American Indigenous Religions, 2013) December 29, 1890 was the when the Ghost Dance ended at Wounded Knee due to the American troops killing off all of the Lakota Native Americans. Over all this movie was spectacular and opened my eyes to the way of life as Native Americans. I personally am  Cherokee and sadly I had no idea all this happened. I truly respect the Native Americans as they surely have endured hard times and have had their land, faith, homes, and families yanked right out from under them.

The movie was exceptional, in that, real Indians were used to portray real Indians. The times, they are a'changing. More movies such as this one need to be made. Truth needs to be told. I see quite often the Holocaust of the Jewish people quite often, in documentaries on television. The movie was excellent. The actors played their part very well. I was pleased with the movie. The only thing missing was the pop corn. Thank you for allowing me to view it. Peace.

2855958,5,B000R20164,"A great and very accurate but painful history of how the American Government slaughtered and changed the Native Americans while the U.S.violated the Treaties signed by the Presidents of the United States. People were slaughtered and Genocide committed, lands taken, and valuable resources stolen, sacred lands desecrated and removed from Native Americans. This land is not ours to take, but for us to use while we live in this planet. We must share and respect Nature and not violate the ones who came before us.
One of the best films to clearly depict how the Government was responsible for the kidnapping of Native American children and sent to foster homes and schools away from their homes to be given ""White"" names and then returned tot he parents after the age of 15 or so in the most formidable years of development. They were not allowed to speak their own language.
You would not see white children treated in this way in the early 1800 to 1900's.

The movie left me so speechless and heartbroken; but in the end I am glad that he was still able to continue advocating for the Sioux Nation.  As a teacher I think this movie should be required in all schools (middle and high).  We are not given enough information through our educational system as to what ultimately happened to the Native American culture.  Most of my knowledge has come from doing my own research.

2856181,4,B000R20164,"Released to HBO in 2007, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is a historical Western based on several chapters of Dee Browns book of the same name and details the last days of the Sioux Nation, culminating in the infamous massacre at Wounded Knee. Adam Beach plays Charles Eastman, a Dakota youth who is encouraged by his Christianized father to head east and become a doctor. During his stint as physician at Pine Ridge Reservation he meets and marries, Elaine Goodale (Anna Paquin). Eastman teams-up with Senator Henry Dawes (Aidan Quinn) to legally help the Native Americans. This includes the Dawes Act, which would ensure that every Indian family would own 160 acres of land. Within this framework the story of Sitting Bull (August Schellenberg) is told, including his death. Wes Studi appears briefly as Wovoka, a Northern Paiute spiritual leader and creator of the Ghost Dance. His messianic movement inspired the Natives, promising an end of their suffering under white rule.

Every movie based on history mixes fact with fiction as filmmakers try to overcome the challenge of morphing complex real-life events into palatable cinema. So lets get the falsities out of the way: Charles Eastman never lived in the Native village near the Battle of the Little Bighorn as young brave Ohiyesa; Sitting Bull surrendered at Ft. Buford, not Standing Rock; lastly, Charles Eastman was not Dawes associate in developing the Dawes Act.

With that out of the way, what I like about this movie is how balanced it is as it shows both sides of the story. Here the Indians aren't portrayed as super-virtuous with nigh-Messianic powers (except for Wovoka, which is understandable) nor are the whites frothing with evil to massacre the Natives. This balance is perfectly portrayed in the excellent parley sequence between Sitting Bull and Col. Nelson Miles (Shaun Johnston) where honest and intense positions are shared. For instance, Miles argues that North America was anything but a peaceful paradise before Europeans arrived and that the Lakota Sioux conquered other tribes to acquire their land in the Black Hills. The Europeans were simply a confederation of several white tribes from across the great sea and were merely doing the same thing that Sitting Bulls tribe did  acquiring land from conquered peoples.

Speaking of Sitting Bull, hes one of the most interesting and enigmatic Native characters seen in cinema. And its a noteworthy performance by Schellenberg.

The Wovoka sequence is another highlight where Wovoka (Studi) brings his prophecy and message of the Ghost Dance to the Black Hills Natives. He articulates his message in a hypnotizing manner accompanied by the sign language of the plains Indians. The irony is that, while Wovokas vision inspires the Lakota and it replaces their suffering with hope & happiness, it only ends in death.

Two great sequences occur in the final act: The accurately-depicted haunting death of Sitting Bull, which took place on December 15, 1890, at Standing Rock Reservation; and the titular massacre at Wounded Knee Creek on the Pine River Reservation two weeks later.  Col. James Forsyth (Marty Antonini) says to Eastman, ""We didn't fire first. I swear to Almighty God, we did not fire first, which is verified by history: Tensions mounted in the confrontation as Yellow Bird started to perform the Ghost Dance, informing the Sioux that their ""ghost shirts"" were bulletproof. Known troublemaker Black Coyote seemed to unintentionally trigger the massacre by refusing to give up his rifle; some say he was deaf and didn't comprehend the order. When two soldiers seized Black Coyote from behind, his rifle was discharged during the struggle. While this was happening, Yellow Bird threw dust in the air and several Lakota braves with concealed weapons threw aside their blankets and fired their rifles at the troops. The firing then became indiscriminate and the massacre entailed.

While Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is a television production, its quality is as good or better than many theatrical pictures. As my title blurb says, its basically the sequel to 1991s Son of the Morning Star: That movie ended with Custers last stand whereas Wounded Knee begins with it. Furthermore, they're both televisions productions with the same grueling-realistic tone. Another good comparison is 1975s I Will Fight No More Forever. Its also not far off in style and approach to movies like Unforgiven (1992), Wyatt Earp (1994) and Open Range (2003). If you're a fan of these types of Westerns be sure to check out Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.

The film runs 133 minutes and was shot outside of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Two wrongs never make a right. Feeling sorry for Native Americans or any minority for that matter is disingenuous to the overall Human race. Every single race has massive blood on their ledgers some more than most. The ""white man"" while having its share of atrocities does not rank up there with other minorities that became minorities through defeat or through forced relocation.

We will look at the Native Americans and the earliest recorded history by them, 9 th century to 15 th century. Native Americans wiped out entire civilizations for sport for hundreds of years. The list of prominent tribes/nations nearly everyone is familiar with, did not war to take land so much as they warred for prestige and honor, for fun.

They raided, destroyed entire nations and tribes, absorbed, enslaved, sacrificed, traded Humans to other tribes and did this non stop for hundreds of years. But heritage only goes back as far as it is convenient for those pointing the finger with moistened eyes feeling sorry for themselves and not accepting what their heritage entails, a very bloody history, more so than the ""white devil"".

What happened at wounded knee is not something to be proud of for the fledgling USA but it happened and is over. Do I feel sorry for Native Americans? Not one bit. Many nations of fighters that preyed upon each other, the weak and exploited their weaknesses and conquered and destroyed, were in turn destroyed themselves, that's life and an example of what we do not do anymore and try to keep from happening in this modern age because it is wrong.

A native America once made a statement on youtube and was slammed for it, and rightly so. They asked the question in their self righteous, holier than thou attitude, it was: ""How is the white man enjoying our land?"" My response to them was two fold, I typed: ""I imagine I enjoy it the same way you enjoyed the land you stole when you destroyed civilizations or tribes back in the day. I enjoy it pretty damn much.

I see claims for reparations being levied against the USA all the time. When will Native Americans track down the descendants of those they utterly destroyed hundreds of years ago and settle with them?

Before people make movies like this they need to include the self motivating, violent history of these peoples. Making them look like victims is foolish. Instead we have a heartfelt, sad rendering of what the final stand of a conquered people went though and are forced to feel guilty and sorry for them. No thanks. Native Americans were the baddest kid on the block doing what they wanted, when they wanted, mostly for fun, the worst type of warring. Then they got stomped by someone else.

 History, as recorded through their own tribes 9th to the 15th century and from the 15th century forward through various scholars, both sets are fairly similar in description and happenings. If you are going to represent something, represent it the right way. If you claim your heritage, be ready to claim all of it.",1454198400,,3023,4.764818355640536

2856390,2,B000R20164,"This is an inferior movie. It is highly inaccurate, and cannot even be spoken in the same sentence as two other films which are truly excellent: ""The Last of the Mohicans"", brilliantly cast led by Daniel Day-Lewis (the only actor ever to win Best Actor Oscar 3 times), filmed and directed by Michael Mann, and ""The Last Samurai"" starring Tom Cruise, with Ken Watanabe, in his first English speaking role and American film; although not as terrific a director as Michael Mann, Edward Zwick paid close attention to detail in his epic film.  This movie is subpar in all comparable categories, from the B-list actors to the direction and production-an inferior film. The actors, although good are all B-list, except for the the truly gifted actress Anna Paquin who was 9 years old when she was cast and filmed in ""The Piano"" (1993); plus she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and it also captured Oscars for Holly Hunter as Best Actress and Jane Campion (who also directed) won the Oscar for Best Screenplay.  This is not on the level of those films; no way. As much as I wrote about the awards, they truly mean near as much to me; they do for people's careers and for fat cat studios to make money.

The degradation and humiliation that was forced upon them was truly heartbreaking and as a result is a very sad part of early American history.

I always wonder how so many people thought that this was okay.  It was not okay.  The arrogancy to think that their ""civilized"" way of life was better than the Native Americans.  To force them to cut their hair and take Christian names.  How could they not understand that you have to respect  people and their cultures for what they are and not change them.  I understand they knew what they were doing.  They wanted to crush their spirits.  I even read something once where a person said it was God's will that this happened.  I do not believe God wanted the Native Americans to be treated this way.  It was just an excuse for the greed of the land and all it's value.  In my opinion, the Native Americans live life a lot better.  They didn't destroy the land,  they were part of it.  This was a very hard movie to watch, especially the scenes at Wounded Knee. How they could do that to the people?  I will never understand.  Once again,  Adam Beach is outstanding and ends up making me cry.  I always enjoy seeing Wed Studi in movies and Gordon Tootoois is good as well.  I've never read Charles Eastman's books, but I just ordered one because I want to read what he had to say.

2856686,5,B000R20164,"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee*  is an exceptional movie based on Dee Browns bestseller of the same title, and other historical resources.
It is surprisingly more balanced than the book in its portrayal and history of the Sioux, esp. Setting Bull. It accurately shows the Sioux carrying Henry Repeating Rifles  and the US Calvary equipped with single shot breach loaning rifles (as were the Indians and Custers troops, respectively, at the Battle of the Little Big Horn).**
 Part of the back-story referrers to conflicts with other tribes such as the Chippewas defeat of the Sioux in Minnesota and their subsequent exile and re-settlement in the Dakotas. The movie falls a little short in its narrative of the killing of Sitting Bull. It is depicted accuracy, by all historical accounts. But in the closing credits it is proclaimed a murder.
This is a must see for any American History aficionado.

Much of the history is incorrect, many of the events portrayed never took place and many that did are portrayed inaccurately and are pure fiction.  Some are accurate, but are placed out of context.  It's just kind of a mish mash.

This needs to be looked on as a western melodrama rather than anything else. And to that end some may like it, but I would not want someone to come away feeling they have a historical perspective on these events.

I personally don't believe that you can take these events and subjects which are already muddled by the many poorly researched and agenda based histories (as all histories are) and present it as anything but a melodrama.",1410825600,2,804,4.555555555555555

This film only slightly touches on the government's policy of stealing the land and destroying the culture of this nation's native people. Actually  more was in the bonus extras DVD, how the children were taken from their parents and put in those mission boarding schools,and had their hair cut off and beaten if they spoke their native tongue,and forced to accept the white man's religion.

2856794,5,B000R20164,"I have read the book ""Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee"" several times and am extremely well versed in American Indian history.  I absolutely love this film and thought that it could not have been better cast or better adapted.

The film doesn't follow the book, it would have had to have been too episodic and impersonal in order to do that, instead it follows the stories of few individuals related to the resistance and ultimate fall of the Lakota people as an independent and soverign nation unto themselves.  It is as once uplifting, particularly to those of us with traditional ties to the American Indian culture and to those who do not know these stories, could be devistating.  I often think that contemporary American politics would do well to remember these times in American history as it might bring a bit more humility and wisdom to a country that is often fooled by its own myth.

All the actors are wonderful but Aiden Quinn is particularly wonderful in this film, and Eddie Spears (though his part is relatively small) breaks my heart with his mournful and honest notable performance.  The music and score are particularly good, mixing western music with traditional Lakota and American Indian chants and beats.  I would highly reccomend this film to anyone who wants to understand on a real visceral level what the Indian Wars were really like and what the ""people on the ground"" really went through.  Books are great, but film is meant to hit you in subconscious places and this film really does that.",1356998400,3,1516,4.759541984732825

2856796,5,B000R20164,"I bought this film after returning from the Dakotas. We went on a trip called the Legacy of Survival welcoming the Sioux Natives back to Minnesota after 150 yrs. My husband and I felt Honored to be a part of it all and took as many classes that we could fit in during the three days of festivities. After the welcoming event we were invited to an Intertribal Powwow at Shokopee. While there two Decendents of Charles Eastmen,Ohiyesa,That we were with knew how much I appreciated all that I had learned,the kindness and SPIRIT of the Native Peoples so they suggested I watch the film about their Great Uncle. This film is so well done that it moved not only myself the ""White Women"" but my Native friends as well. This should be a film that ALL children HAVE to see in High School. I had to be in My 50's before I started learning the truth about what really happened in this Country. The Natives were not the Savages but the ""White Man"" has truly proven himself over and over again,performing acts of genocide on our or I should say the Native Americans own Land. This film teaches you about all the treaty's that were broken to benifit the ""White Man"" never once telling the truth or keeping his word. I ask you why is all of this left out of American History Books? You relize why we need and are all trying to do away with Columbus Day. I give this Film 6 stars and will watch it again and again. I also suggest any and all of Charles Eastmen's Books. His writings have a lot to teach. As Linda Hogan the Great Chickasaw Writer said in her book The Women Who Watches Over The World... Charles Eastmen was to her a great hero like Crazy Horse to be respected by her Native Peoples..I am not Native but I have studied about them both and admire them with all my heart,they were Great Men worth admiring.

2856798,4,B000R20164,"Much more of an opinion than a review. You have been warned.

The similarities of blacks and Indians/Native Americans are just so in your face, it's hard not to notice and say something. I'm black myself and admittedly sometimes I'm fixated on the black man's plight. Not in a victimology way, in a that's interesting and sad way.

Indians/Native Americans couldn't understand, at the time, that assimilation into the white world was the only choice that remained. American whites didn't invent how the world works, they are just much better at taking advantage of how it works. White folks, that's nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, you should be celebrating it. After all, what's the alternative? Would you like to switch positions with the Sub Saharan Africans for example? Maybe you'd like to switch with the Northern Africans then? That part of the world clearly can't adapt quickly to ever evolving world conditions.

Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is a very powerful read. The movie wasn't great but does present a clear understanding of Indian/Native Americans dilemma in the later half of the 19th century. The path, for natives, was pretty simple but incredibly difficult to accept, by the first and second generation natives. Even though they have lived by these types of rules the ENTIRE time they dominated the Americas, it was totally unacceptable to be dominated by another race using those same rules. The world is governed by the aggressive use of force. Whom would you rather have THE FORCE? There won't be a vacuum for very long WHEN America falls. With the apparent rise of China the next couple of 50 years could be very scary indeed. Be careful what you wish for.",1335657600,,1681,4.850174216027875

2856801,4,B000R20164,"I do not have the expertise to critique the historical accuracy of this film in detail, but I nonetheless think it was a great success as a viewing experience that is moving, informative, and superlatively acted.  I watched it with my son, whose curiosity I hoped to spark after the raucously wonderful and sad Little Big Man.  THe film leaves you with a hunger to learn more, a sure sign of success.

The story begins essentially at the moment that  Little Big Man ends, with the last big triumph of the Indians in their fight to preserve their land and way of life.  The principal character, a gifted boy (Charles, as he is later named at random in order to participate in school), is sent to get an education among the whites, eventually going to medical school with the sponsorship of a US Senator, Dawes.  The boy excels and is co-opted into helping Dawes in his attempt to reach a settlement with the Sioux and several other tribes on reservations, after their traditional lands had been expropriated.  He moves from hope to disillusion, of course, in a kind of personal crisis of conscience that is painful to watch.

The other big characters include Sitting Bull, a subtle portrait that shows how he is losing his prestige yet still can muster a following to resist the policies that, however well intentioned Dawes might have been, are administered not just poorly but brutally.  He is a man who witnessed the destruction of his culture and way of being, from the first encroachments by whites until he is summarily executed in the terrible incident known as the Wounded Knee massacre.  There is also CHarles' wife, a remarkable woman of empathy and spirit who serves as a witness with him to what can only be called clumsy ethnic cleansing.  It is horrible and heartbreaking to watch.

Not only are the policy details covered adequately, but the existential crises at the heart of the end of the old ways are moving portrayed in characters.  To be sure, though based on historical figures, the film adds novelistic inaccuracies to move the story along succinctly.  These inaccuracies, such as placing Charles at the Battle of Little Bighorn, do not help for the credibility of the film, but they work as plot devices.  Indeed, it would have been nearly impossible to pack the information they had to include into the 2-hour format if they hadn't - and it would have been to do a longer series.  The characters cover the full range, from insensitive and caring whites to adaptable Indians and those who fell victim to bizarre cults that mixed messianic Christian visions with apocalyptic predictions for the fate of whites.  It is as nuanced as you can get in a film.

This movie almost comes across as a docu-drama or reenactment.  The natives for the most part appeared real, but I somehow kept expecting to see a rusted out chevy or ford lying on the 1876 plains.  What I liked most about it was the believability of the story. Though I know the harsh brutality of the United States' dealings with the Native American, It made me down right angry to see it and taste it through this film. That's a compliment to the makers of this one for getting it right.  Basically, you are a witness to an atrocity planned and executed to genocidal perfection.  Here though, the truth does not set you free, it sets you to thinking about other past, present and future lies that help governments justify their land grabbing actions. Is resistance futile?

The lesson this film teaches is that your land is something worth fighting for, even if you did steal it from someone else.",1264118400,2,1147,4.733668341708543
2856818,2,B000R20164,"""Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee"" was one of those landmark books one reads in ones youth and the story and images just stay with one.  I had resisted seeing the DVD because I suspected it would be a disappointment and it was.  So I guess I wasn't actually disappointed.  It is a Hollywood scripwriter's fantasy about what the end of the Plains Indians and their forced exile onto the reservations.  Was it genocide?  Yes, I think it certainly was and it's too important and compelling a story to be trivialized and twisted as this movie does.  I give it points for a somewhat successful evocation of the times and its use of Native American actors but it's history in much the same sense most stories about the history of the West are.

I only know what I've read and learned from a few decades of interest in Western History.  I have no connection to Indian culture other than an interest and would not presume to try to present their point of view.  I'm grateful for any sympathetic portrayal of their story but just once I'd like to see it done with some accuracy.

One example.  Early in the film we see a ""battle"" between Lakota under Sitting Bull and US troops led my General Miles.  The Lakota mount a cavalry charge against a line of infantry with Hotchkiss guns.  I'm not an expert, but the Lakota would never do such a thing and, as far as I know, no battle like it ever took place.  They didn't fight like that nor would Army defend such a tactically poor position where Indian marksmen (they tended to be very good shots) could have picked off the troops at their leisure from above.  The scene is just laughably bad and, in a way, an insult to Sitting Bull.

George Eastman was not a Lakota and was never near the Little Big Horn when Custer attacked.  He was a Dakota, another branch of the tribe and the make movie even makes reference to this by referring to his chief as Little Crow, the leader of the Minnesota Sioux Uprising in 1862.  Driven from the state, a lot of those people settled on the Lake Traverse Reservation in northeaster South Dakota and I presume that's where he was from.  I suppose these are minor issues to some people but it leads one to question the whole intent of the film.  Is it just to tell what someone thinks is a good story?  If so, why did they appropriate a ground-breaking and respected book as a basis for the story and then simply cast aside any attempt at accuracy.  It would be different if the true characters weren't terribly interesting but that is certainly not the case.

In any event, please don't accept this version as anything close to being the real story, whatever that is.  Read the book and any number of other good ones.  As for me , I'm still waiting for someone to tell this story on film with sensitivity and respect for the truth and the people who lived it.",1262908800,4,2830,4.40655105973025
2856819,4,B000R20164,"An arrow launched bravely, but falls short

I read Dee Brown's classic story about the brutal, tragic history of White-Indian relations back in the early 1970s when I was in high school. Ranging as it does over 400 years of American history, from Columbus to the early 20th century, the book seemed impervious to adaptation to television. But HBO has done a creditable job of bringing a slice of Brown's blood-soaked tale to the small screen. To do so, HBO had to cut away much of Brown's wide-ranging narrative, and might have cut even more to keep from confusing the audience with too many characters. HBO spliced onto the story the tale of Charles Eastman, a Dartmouth-trained doctor who grew up as a Sioux. Eastman's story functions as a splint that holds together the disparate shards of Indian history that culminate at Wounded Knee. It also serves as a bridge between the worlds of Washington DC, where decisions about Indian affairs were made, and the distant battlefields and reservations where those decisions were implemented.

""Bury My Heart"" focuses mostly on the stories of chiefs Red Cloud and Sitting Bull, who lead some of the last bands of Indian holdouts against assimilation into white society. The film depicts Sioux life as harsh, yet happy and robust. Tepees sprout in harmony along rivers and streams. Children play happily, hunters bring home the abundant game and families sit cozily around campfires. But all goes awry when whites encroach on Indian lands, and especially when gold is discovered in the Black Hills, sacred to the Sioux. Suddenly, the iron-clad treaties that whites had negotiated with the Sioux are treated as fungible, and deal after deal is shoved down the throats of these bands whose firepower is vastly outbalanced by white guns and rapaciousness. The final ""battle"" -- if gunning down hundreds of unarmed and sick Indian men, women and children can be ennobled by that word -- occurs with horrifying finality at Wounded Knee Creek.

The film is strongest where it shows important events that rarely make it into the history books. The ""education"" (really, indoctrination) of young Indians by white teachers, Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull's death (assassination is not a stretch), the Sioux emigration into Canada, and the final battle are well-depicted. The ongoing debates between government ""progressives"" (who wanted to save Indians from extermination by forced assimilation into white ways) and the militants (who wanted to kill them off outright) shows the lack of understanding and respect that hampered white's ability to deal with the Indians fairly. Where the film falls short is in depicting the emotions and subtleties of the interaction. There are no scenes showing gold-crazed whites pushing into Indian lands. Treaties with Indians are shown, accompanied by maps, but it's hard for the uneducated viewer to quite understand the issues. An interaction between Sitting Bull and Phil Sheridan gives the American general the opportunity to trash the Sioux version of its history, but gives next to no space to the Sioux view, suggesting that Sheridan was correct. Most importantly, the film skirts the issue of race. This was especially evident in the love story between Sioux Charles Eastman and his white wife-to-be, Elaine Goodale. Everyone seems thrilled that these two young people were getting together. But given the tenor of times, it's hard to believed that a red man marrying a white woman would have been acceptable to most people.

Still, the film provides indelible images of the campaign of white atrocities and duplicities that drove the outgunned Indians from their lands. An Indian chief's frozen body is flipped on its back to facilitate a photographer; an endless series of tepees stretches along the Little Big Horn as the battle rages; Indians literally ""touch pen"" to the implements that signify their assent to a document; Hotchkiss guns hurl deadly shells at fleeing Indians; an old man drags young boy after he has been cut down.

In spite of its many deficiencies, ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" is worthy of watching -- especially for an amazing performance by part-Mohawk August Schellenberg, who gave his role of Sitting Bull the ferocity, gravitas and dignity that made him completely believable as the fearsome Sioux war chief.",1261440000,4,4318,5.1191489361702125

Knowing the details of the massacre, and how women, children and old people were chased down and murdered, was something I wasn't sure I could watch - even in a movie.

Another reviewer here on Amazon gave this a very thorough review, and he noted that while it was fairly  accurate historically, it was not completely so. I won't steal his words for this review. After following the steady downward spiral of the Sioux people into nearly complete destruction over a period of 14 years, the end was, well . . . given cursory attention, a gloss over, Hollywood-ized.  According to Black Elk (read Black Elk Speaks for a firsthand account), those ""wagon guns"" went on firing for a long, long time.

The scenery was well chosen, the sets fairly realistic, and of course, the Native Americans who reenacted their own history were terrific.

What should have been the climax of this endeavor, the Wounded Knee Massacre, was handled pathetically.  Such a tragic end to a beautiful way of life deserved far more and better attention than it received. It was the sheer brutality of the soldiers as they shot women and infants at point blank range, their insulting demeanor towards a desperate people, their desire for revenge for Custer's defeat at Little Big Horn, the overwhelming evil that was unleashed that day, that is left out. For that alone, this film falls very, very short of the mark in explaining the grief and mourning, and anger, a people still feel for their lost past. And, as a final insult, if you read the notes at the end of the film, you will see that Congressional Medals of Honor were bestowed upon these ""heroes"" for their part in this, to use Black Elk's own word, butchery.

2856839,3,B000R20164,"Bury My Heart....is a decent film. I always welcome any film that, respectfully and honestly, tries to deal with native american subject matters.
However; this film was simply too riddled with historical inaccuracies to be what it should have been.
The first problem arises in that Dee Brown's book in itself romantizises the massacre at wounded knee. To base a film on a book that is already flawed, from a native point of view, is tatamount to building a house on quicksand.

Ok let's look at the character of Ohiysa, or Dr. Charles Eastman, portrayed by Adam Beach.
Ohiyesa was Whappeton-Sisseton DAKOTA....in the film he is portrayed as LAKOTA. To most people that won't matter much, but for both the Lakota and Dakota people it does.
He sometimes speaks in Lakota....which, as a Dakota, he most certainly would not have. True, both dialects are mutually understandable and are of siouan origin, but Ohiyesa would certainly have spoken his Whappeton Dakota dialect....not the Oglalla Lakota dialect.
Then he is placed in the wrong place and time. Ohiyesa was nowhere near the greasy grass (little big-horn) when the lakota camp was attacked by Reno and his men. In fact, he was a state away up in North Dakota or further over in Minnesota....not in Montana where the battle took place.
Neither was he ever close to the wounded knee massacre. He WAS the agency physician at Pine Ridge, Oglalla Lakota Reservation, but not at the time of the battle at wounded knee.

Chief Tatanka Iyotake...Sitting Bull. August Schellenberg did a good job with the script he was given. What bothers me however, is that in almost all native type movies the actors are forced to speak in a very awckward manner which comes across as phoney and contrieved. As though natives would have spoken that way in their own language.

Anyhow. Tatanka Iyotake comes across as somewhat of a jerk and I feel that the way he was pertrayed took much away from the real Sitting Bull...not that I knew the man of course. However; Sitting Bull was a wicasa wakan...a holy man amongst his Hunkpapa people and I doubt he would have conducted himself as arrogantly and foolishly as he was made to look in this film. Also, he never came to Pine Ridge...much less did he surrender there. He surrendered at Ft. Robinson Nebraska.....the same place where Tashunke Witko...Chief Crazy Horse surrendered and where he was murdered by the U.S. Govt. They did get it right that Sitting Bull was murdered on his Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota.

Again, these inaccuracies may not seem like a big deal to most, but I doubt ANY american would take kindly to a foreigen nation making a film about, say Pearl Harbor, but confuse names, events and places of major american figures along the way. Imagine, a foreigen produced film about Pearl Harbor, with Gen. Mc Arthur invading China instead of Japan, and Pearl Harbor being set on the coast of Maine. Wouldn't go over well would it? Now imagine how the decendants of the native side of wounded knee feel when the story of their ancestors is constantly told in a haphazzard manner. Point made.

There are a few other things wrong with this film. In the last frames of the film Chief Makhpia Luta...Red Cloud, is shown riding on a wagon, as Ohiyesa and his wife bare witness to the aftermath of the massacre. Red Cloud was not at wounded knee. He was at Pine Ridge at the time yes, but he did not visit the killing field because he was afraid that more violence would errupt. Beyond that, he had gone blind and was in frail health at the time of the massacre....he couldn't have gone even if he had wanted to.

All in all the acting was anywhere from great to ok, but given the lame script and dialogue there was not much any of the actors could have done. The cinematography was very good, as were the costumes....at least here they paid attention to detail in ditinguishing the Arikira from the Crow and the Crow from the Lakota...as each tribe had it's own very distinctive dress and appearance forms.

One last note on Dr. Eastman. In the film he is shown as being desolate toward the end and out of work when he, in fact, went on to publish many books and was, even in his day, recognized as a writer and orator of great renown.

From my perspective it is hard to get around the inaccuracies and the torrid dialogue, but given the scarsity of cerdible native themed films...still and ever, I take it for what it is and give it 3 stars.",1203638400,166,4448,4.642947903430749

Ten minutes after he was given the job he was called back and told they had decided to go with another director, Yves Simoneau. Please don't misunderstand me, Yves Simoneau is a fine director, but it is my belief that the job should have gone to Sherman Alexie who is more than qualified and brings the fact that he is Native American to the job. That provides a different perspective than that of a French director. In my opinion the movie was a watered down version of the book and I think it would have been much better had it been directed by Sherman Alexie.",1200355200,23,814,4.469798657718121
2856842,4,B000R20164,"BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE is a somber retelling of the events leading up to the massacre at (what is now) the Wounded Knee Memorial. But this isn't a documentary. This is a made-for-TV fictional retelling, and it is the ""made-for-TV"" bit that makes this important American event lose some of its composure.

The entire production flags because of the TV aspect, many of the film shots losing their impact either because of lack of attention to detail or funds (or probably both). Either way this could've been an extreme visual recollection for most viewers but instead it lacks the depth I would've liked to have seen.

Regardless, there are some stellar appearances and acting within it. August Schellenberg as Sitting Bull undeniably has the most impact. Recent movie viewers will probably remember him from his portrayal as Powhatan in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-World/dp/B000ESSUL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New World</a>. The contrast between the character in The New World and here in Wounded Knee shouldn't be lost, either. Without Powhatan and Pocahontas, the white settlers at Jamestown would've perished within the first few winters. And now, in Wounded Knee, it is the white man who destroys what is left of Native American life; a terribly stark (and bloody) reality.

The other notables are Adam Beach (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flags-of-Our-Fathers/dp/B000M4RG42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flags of Our Fathers</a>) as Charles Eastman, and Aidan Quinn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legends-of-the-Fall/dp/B00004WG2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legends of the Fall</a>) as Senator Henry Dawes. They spend a lot of time together on film and they played against/off each other exceptionally well. Charles being the ""new wave"" Indian who melds into the white man's way of life until exposed to reservation life at Pine Ridge. Henry Dawes seeing himself as ""The Great White Savior Of The Indians"" by passing legislation that loops a few nooses around the necks of the Plains Indians' way of life without even realizing it.

But other actors have little to offer. Anna Paquin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B000KC86F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>) as Charles' white love interest (and eventual wife) is seen too infrequently so the relationship between the two has little impact. She does a good job of acting but the script stymied any possibility of real success. From here the acting dips into the drab and boring. I have to give mention to Senator Fred Thompson (currently a Republican runner for the U.S. Presidency) who plays President Ulysses S. Grant. We see maybe four frames of film with him in it and then he's gone. This surprised me greatly since it was Grant's administration that doomed Native Americans by rounding them up and placing them on reservations.

Despite my misgivings about the script, cinematography and acting, this is a vital story that needs to be told, and it isn't something that is normally taught in grade school or higher. Europeans (us) conquered this land and its people, and pushed them into holding pens where they, to this day, await justice for our multiple treaty violations and massacres of their men, women and children (I will say that the scenes depicting large-caliber rifle bullets ripping through young kids was filmed well and was equally hard to watch).

So the story gives this film a higher rating than anything within it, which is unfortunate, as this terrible moment in American history needs to be remembered just as much as Germany needs to remember its holocaust.",1199664000,39,3738,5.726126126126126

this is terrific experience. The story of what happened to the American Indian is horrific (to say the least) but similiar to the treatment of Aborginal peoples worldwide. My own countrys' treatment of our indigenous people (also,the original owners of the land)is similarly disgraceful! I defy anyone with half a heart not to shed a tear at seeing this movie or reading the book ( in my case, it was many tears). The acting is wonderful and, because of that, the treatment of these gentle original owners of the land is all the more tradgic. It is the old story of ""man's inhumanty to man"". This is a ""must see"" movie for anyone who cares about man being intune with the natural world and careing about the land and its resources, as the great and proud American Indian surely was. Also the scenery and photography are first class.

I found the HBO movie, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee a strong film that makes an attempt at pulling the last chapters of Dee Brown's amazing non-fiction book of the same name. Although what seems to be impossible to make an interesting movie that's not a documentary, I think Adam Beach and August Schellenberg should have received more accolades from this film.
Like most of the films that reference this period of the American West made in modern times, you're left with that stomach wrenching sadness for the Native American people. This film is not an apology, but a representation that follows Dee Brown's history from the other side, the Native American Indian's perspective. The story follows Adam Beach's character Dr. Charles Eastman, a Native American man that has lived in the white-man's world, and yet, does not fit in either. Eastman heads back to his original reservation to try and help the Sioux, the Lakota people, who are dying of disease, a broken people, with the exception of Sitting Bull, played by August Schellenberg.
From a person that's actually visited the Wounded Knee cemetery on top that hill in the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where the massacre took place on a cold day in December 1890, it brought that history to life.
It really is an amazing film that captures the true history of that piece of history that most Americans would like to forget.

2856855,4,B000R20164,"Although Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,the adaptation of Dee Brown's book does have some claring inaccuracies, it does accurately captures the pain and struggle of the Sioux during the last half of the 19th century.  Dr. Charles Eastman,portrayed by Adam Beach, comes across as a caring, concerned individual who wants to do whatever he can to help his people.  It should be noted that Ohiessa (Eastman) was not at the Battle of Little Bighorn, but was in Canada, at the time with his father, Many Lightnings. Also, Many Lightnings did convert to Chriatianity, but he was not a zealot, as portayed in the film.  The film also paints Eastman as being a desciple of Senator Dawes.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Eastman agreed with some of Dawes beliefs regarding the Sioux, but was not a good friend in any way shape or form.  Still the story is a powerful one and one worth watching.",1193184000,,895,4.6687898089171975
2856856,4,B000R20164,"Unique storytelling angle and complex performances by Gordon Tootoosis, August Schellenberg, & Adam Beach. I'm not completely sure, but I think I'd have to say for now that Schellenberg is probably the best Sitting Bull on film yet--even though he's been played well a number of times in recent years. Some other Native people have told me they had mixed feelings about the portrayal of Sitting Bull [it's painful], but I felt that it actually captured a deeper and more subtle tragedy behind the events that other films on this subject don't bring out as much: the way the government manipulated tribes and tribal members to attempt to set them against each other, all while steadily attacking the dignity of each individual (and their ancestors). I'd have to say that this film brought out the shame factor big-time, and that is very, very hard to watch coming from my culture. Yet as much as it might seem disrespectful, I think in this case it's important for Americans to acknowledge this aspect of the injustice and understand the magnitude of it.

On a side note, I have to admit that I resent the inappropriate and melodramatic subtitle ""The Epic Fall of the American Indian"" as it implies some kind of extinction is in effect. Maybe your town/city is Native-free, but Ishi the last Yahi is not the reality of every tribe! I get tired of hearing people feeling bad about what white people did in the past without realizing that they can do something positive in the present. Maybe if people stopped talking past tense about the ""plight"" of the Native American"" and started recognizing tribes as LIVING and supporting tribal sovereignty and such it would help.

Instead we get a movie with more drama in the soundtrack than in the script, another self-pitying performance from Adam Beach, a storyline that is so busy trying to cover a lot of historical ground it misses nearly every opportunity to connect on an emotional level, and a hair-pulling number of close-ups of proud Indian faces looking into the distance -- with tears running down craggy faces in order to underscore the sadness we're supposed to be feeling.

8198317,3,B000R20164,"Everyone's a critic. I don't know. I thought it was a pretty good movie, as movies go. I give it only 3 stars for two reasons. First, it played fast and loose with Dee Brown's book. The movie was more a docudrama rather than a retelling. It pulls in real atrocities that are not mentioned in the book and leaves out volumes of ones that are far worse.

Second, the movie left out the Sand Creek Massacre. Every American alive today should know about Sand Creek in the same way that German students are taught about Hitler's concentration camps, so that it never happens again. Yes, Sand Creek was that bad.

To me, the movie is a stark reminder that, had there been no Civil War, the Union would never have amassed as military capable of crushing the western frontier the way they did. Had the war not happened, then maybe Native American lands west of the Mississippi would have gained sufficient autonomy, soon enough, that they would govern far greater lands today. While this isn't likely, it's okay to dream and, in my opinion, North America would be much more diverse and interesting than it is now.

In summary, it's an okay movie and I recommend it somewhat, because the casual viewer may learn something (unless they are racist). But it does rewrite American history, in favor of white Europeans, and you should read the book. North America was inhabited by North Americans, not too long ago. And if you think Europeans settled it, from sea to shining sea, without using genocide, then you're living in Candyland.",1521590400,3,1522,4.6716417910447765

It brought added depth to the film if you know anything about the broken promises and violence that the Standing Rock Sioux suffered over the pipeline a couple years ago. The abuse has never ended, it has just changed with the times. Something the Native Americans have not been surprised by. Like Red Cloud says in this film, ""You whites use many weapons against us...We have always feared your guns the least.""

Something I wasn't sure about in the film is whether the ""brown bottle medicine"" was actually cod liver oil like doctor seemed to think, or if it was alcohol? Maybe it is more clear in the book? (I have not read it.)

Another thought I had watching this is that the Senator in the film reminds me of MLK's warning: ""I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negros great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: 'I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action'; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another mans freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a 'more convenient season'.""",1517702400,3,1532,4.67037037037037

8198323,3,B000R20164,"""Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee"" is the name of a famous, and almost unspeakably depressing book about the long and sorry history of broken treaties, brutal violence and cultural genocide which underlay the ""taming"" of the American West. This made-for-HBO film is clearly inspired by that grimoire of greed and bloodlust, but narrows its focus somewhat to cover primarily the fate of the Sioux in the years following their hollow victory over Custer at the Little Big Horn.

The movie's plot is a ""fractured narrative,"" meaning it has no real star but divides its attention between many characters, including Sitting Bull (August Shellenberg), the last of the Sioux chiefs to surrender to the white man; Charles Eastman (Adam Beach), a relative of Sitting Bull's who is raised and ""civilized"" by white people; Henry Dawes (Aidan Quinn), a largely well-meaning white man who wants to do to the rest of the Sioux what he has done to Charles; and James McLaughlin (J.K. Simmons), the stern and heartless overlord of the Standing Rock reservation where Sitting Bull's people end up. The story begins at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, deals quickly with the decisive defeat of the Sioux that followed, and then follows a long and gruesome road in which we see a once-proud, once-free race of people broken and degraded into unrecognizable shells of their former selves. Ironically, given the recent events involving the Dakota Access Pipeline, much of the story occurs at the Standing Rock Reservation, proving that, if nothing else, history is cyclical (or, put more crudely: that we aren't done @#$%! the Red Man).

""Bury My Heart"" is a film that is by turns arresting, appalling, depressing, interesting, and -- all too frequently -- boring. Scaling in at just over two hours, it felt like four, and not merely because the story is such a sad one. The pacing is not very good, there are a large number of characters to follow, I didn't think Adam Beach packed enough blasting powder into his performance, and the central character of the movie -- Sitting Bull -- remains enigmatic to the last frame of the film. I understand that his degradation from ""big chief"" and warrior to liar, braggart and Wild West sideshow freak is part of the tragedy -- the once-fierce bear turned into a circus attraction -- but I never really felt I got to know the man, despite a good performance from Shellenberg. The fault lies in the structure of the movie and the script. Was Bull perverted by defeat and humiliation into this minstrel-show caricature of himself, or was he always somewhat unscrupulous and self-aggrandizing, with those qualities only being exposed by his defeat? I'm never quite sure. I also would have greatly enjoyed more exploration of General Nelson Miles -- ""Bearcoat"" to the Sioux -- a ferocious and merciless Indian-fighter played by Shaun Johnson who gives a speech which so thoroughly demolishes the image of the peace-loving Indian, beset by the evil white man, that even the most liberal viewer may be temporarily swayed by it (props to Dan Giat and Dee Brown for writing this and other exchanges):

""You came out of the Minnesota woodlands armed to the teeth and set upon your fellow man. You massacred the Kiowa, the Omaha, the Ponca, the Oto and the Pawnee without mercy. And yet you claim the Black Hills as a private preserve bequeathed to you by the Great Spirit? Chief Sitting Bull, the proposition that you were a peaceable people before the appearance of the white man is the most fanciful legend of all. You were killing each other for hundreds of moons before the first white stepped foot on this continent. You conquered those tribes, lusting for their game and their lands, just as we have now conquered you for no less noble a cause.""

The movie is worth watching just for this scene. Alas, there are too few like this, which crackle with tension, and too many that maunder like a self-pitying drunk. It's as if the producers were so intent on making us suffer that they forgot even the most serious and responsible movies have an obligation to entertain the audience. Having said that, I do feel this is an important film, one which charts with emotional accuracy the deadly effect that cultural destruction has on the losing side of a war. George Orwell once wrote that to attack the roots of human solidarity in a cynical way was worse than killing, and ""Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee"" makes a powerful case that this assertion is true.",1517097600,2,4468,4.806241872561769
