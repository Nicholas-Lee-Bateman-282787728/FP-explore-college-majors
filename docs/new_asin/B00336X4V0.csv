8387838,3,B00336X4V0,"The Bound Heat franchise of soft core sex flix specializes in tales of the capture and torment of young women - thus it would seem that the story of the infamous Countess Elizabeth Bathory (considered to be the ALL TIME record holder for worst female mass murderer!) would be a 'natural' for one of their productions.  Although there may now be some historical revisionists that question the authenticity of the grim Bathory legend - the popularly accepted story portrays the Medieval Countess as a deranged female ruler, obsessed with her personal appearance, who believed that she could maintain her youthful beauty by bathing in the blood of young women - hence the title ""The Blood Countess"".

It is reputed that, in her mad quest for immortality, she had literally hundreds of young peasant women kidnapped and murdered to provide her with the bloody elixir she sought - until the outraged populace demanded justice and retribution for her crimes. As the story goes, the Countess was punished by being entombed alive in a tower of her castle where she ultimately perished.

With such a sensational concept to work with it's hard to imagine that the film-makers could produce a boring product, but Director Lloyd Simandl HAS managed to achieve just that result!

Looking at the positive elements of this film - it does have decent production values to provide a convincing period ambiance for the piece (including a classic torture chamber set) - the lead actress can (for once) actually deliver her lines convincingly, AND there is the usual bevy of lovely young Czech 'models' - divested of their clothing for the viewer's enjoyment. There are a few decent 'tableaux' presented of Medieval style BDSM activities, and all the elements are present to theoretically provide a rousing show...

Unfortunately, it seems that somewhere in the editing process the energy gets drained out of the product and most of the potentially 'hot' elements lose their steam as the pacing slows to a crawl. This is a tendency that I have noted in MANY of the Bound Heat films and is probably the biggest negative factor that plagues the product, generally. Thus, despite the parade of naked maidens being tormented and/or pleasured by the Countess the action seems to drag on interminably.  I also found the 'music' to be strangely intrusive in this particular flik - it became apparent that the director was attempting to add 'drama' to the most banal of scenes by layering ominous musical themes over the images - but, after a series of mounting crescendos have thundered over long drawn out sequences of inane activities (such as bathing) the 'device' became pretty apparent and annoying. Simandl's use of attractive 'models', rather than professional actresses, also often hinders the dramatic pacing as the 'wooden' performances produce little engaging empathy for the characters portrayed.

SO - all in all - a rather disappointing addition to the, fairly substantial, catalog of films that recount the legend of the mad 'bloody' Countess - and, sadly, one of the less engaging examples of the Bound Heat line... a 'missed opportunity' to be sure!",1421884800,,3139,5.036608863198459
