7386921,5,B014DEGSBS,First saw this at the international children's film festival in NYC.  My 10 year old daughter loves this movie and I love the story telling feel. Reminds me of stories my older cousins used to tell me in the evening after supper.,1447718400,2,229,4.4523809523809526
7386922,5,B014DEGSBS,I saw this film 2 years ago at the NYICFF and was blown away. Not only was it the most beautiful animation and wonderful example of storytelling it depicted what it was really like for the people who suffered at the hand of slave traders. Human beings were viewed as property to the point of manaiacal obsession. Honestly everyone should see this film it is a masterpiece. I am so happy I can finally get it on DVD it may just have to be my Christmas present to everyone this year.,1447286400,4,481,4.2967032967032965
7386943,5,B014DEGSBS,Loved the movie. Story is amazing,1500076800,,33,4.666666666666667
7386944,5,B014DEGSBS,"Mature subject matter in comparison to Mickey Mouse. But, there is a depth to this movie that was so refreshing. Beautiful, realistic story about following your own compass. The morals run deep in this one.
We will be watching this again and recommending to others.",1499990400,,265,4.911111111111111
7386945,5,B014DEGSBS,"I loved watching this with my teenager. I've had some wonderful experiences in North Africa and France and this highlighted some of the more famous sites. Always a happy ending for all of the characters, except for the evil slave trader, this is a delightful historical-fiction depiction of some important moments. Worth checking out.",1499644800,,334,5.203703703703703
7386946,5,B014DEGSBS,"What a beautiful movie with stunning animation! English voice cast did a great job too. I personally feel like it's more for adults than kiddos, as there is some violence, slavery, a merchant puffin' hash or some kind of opiate, and some death scenes. But if your If your kids are older, maybe it would be good... there's lots of redemption in the end, and some good points of discussion. Well worth the watch though... a really lovely film with a meaningful storyline. Life is a very sacred gift and this movie reminds us that we all must help take care of one another.",1498348800,,570,4.490384615384615
7386947,5,B014DEGSBS,"A touching story, one that is full of love and loss.",1492387200,,52,3.8181818181818183
7386948,1,B014DEGSBS,"We watched this movie in conjunction with reading the book about the giraffe that walked to Paris. I had anticipated it being a lot more like the actual story, but it was basically just frivolous entertainment using the idea of the giraffe that went to Paris. Seeing as this is supposed to be a kids movie, I found it completely unnecessary for a lot of political/religious opinions to be put into this movie such as how they depicted the French King and family and how they used Buddhism and the cow coming back as a butterfly. I was really disappointed in the movie not having much to do with the actual story about the giraffe that was gifted to the king of France from the Pasha of Egypt back in the 1800s.",1492387200,2,710,4.386363636363637
7386949,2,B014DEGSBS,"Within the first ten minutes, a child is enslaved, escapes, is chased by a vicious dog and slaver, and witnesses a mother giraffe being shot and killed.  It was too much for me.  I can't imagine subjecting a child to this.",1489363200,2,222,4.390243902439025
7386950,5,B014DEGSBS,Great story line and historical accuracy! animation is smooth! adorable story and voice acting job! would watch 5 thousand times and still fall in love with this movie!,1489190400,,168,5.035714285714286
7386951,5,B014DEGSBS,"I can't speak highly enough of this beautiful film. Ages 3 through 60s+ all enjoyed it, we watched it over and over. I rented it because I hadn't heard anything about it, and almost immediately wished that I had just taken the chance and purchased it, because it was obvious that we were going to.
This is a well-crafted tale that portrays a variety of cultures and religions, has adventure and danger and lots of love. The main character, Maki, is a plucky, smart and determined young boy who will go to any length for his animal friend, Zarafa, as well as his other companions.
The movie definitely has scary parts, including children who are enslaved, and who are pursued by slavers. I used this as a teaching opportunity for my young child, as this is an important part of history. Depending upon your child's age, you can go more or less into detail, but it can create a great dialog about a dark and scary time in history.
The cast of characters is rich and and compelling, and there are lots of funny and warm parts that offset the scary ones. This movie has comedy, drama, action, and valuable lessons to teach, all while being beautifully animated and with a nice score.
I can't recommend this movie highly enough, I just adore it, and wish that I had discovered it sooner!",1488067200,,1282,4.530172413793103

7387053,3,B014DEGSBS,"The animation is beautiful, but the story was a bit diffuse. I had a feeling that the original story is too complex to turn it into 1 hour plus cartoon. My kids (4 and 8) got bored in the middle, and I can see why this movie didn't grab them.",1482192000,,242,3.86

7387110,1,B014DEGSBS,"I am not sure how this is only rated PG.  Within less than ten minutes it was turned off.  The description made it sound like it would be a neat story for a kid.  But it starts with ""bad men"" guarding two kids tied up back to back plotting an escape.  The boy escapes while a man with a rifle goes after him.  He finds refuge in a tree where he stays safe and meets a few giraffe.  He befriends them and is playing in the water with a few of them when the bad man sees him and comes after him.  The adult giraffe attempts to block the bad man from getting to the baby giraffe or child.  The bad man stands there, aims and point blank shoots to the forehead and the giraffe falls to the ground, dead.  Turned off.",1471564800,4,712,3.9577464788732395

7387351,5,B014DEGSBS,"I enjoyed this full length animated movie so much.  An elder of an African village is telling a wonderful story, to the village children, with life like stick figures.  It is about a boy's promise to protect a dying mother giraffe's baby with his life and the adventures that fall in his path along the way.  Really beautiful, life-like animation!",1463529600,,347,4.75
7387352,5,B014DEGSBS,Such a sweet movie.  Full of dreams and emotion. A fantasy and great for a family movie..especially if your family is younger. my 5 and 3 year old and I loved it! They've watched it 3 times in 3 days.,1463356800,,200,4.0

7387360,5,B014DEGSBS,"This was such a beautiful and wonderfully animated story that I wish had been around when I was a kid. I know that it's for children but even adults will enjoy this film. It is beautiful to watch and the story is well told. The morals of the story are useful for all ages. I think that it might be a tad violent for really young or easily frightened children, but the violence isn't gory, no worse than the Lion King or Mulan. I think that this is something you should watch with your kids so you can explain some of the more mature themes. It was also a pleasant surprise to see a diverse cast of animated characters. As a kid, I would have loved seeing black children (There is more than one! Not just the one thrown in for diversity) that were central to the story line and not just the best friend or a background character.",1461369600,8,828,4.213836477987422

My 4 year old loved it, I cried. really well done. heavy subject matter yet appropriate and well made- my son didn't have a problem with it, and I explained it as we went along. I really wish there were more movies like this.

7387416,4,B014DEGSBS,The story is a little thin - a boy escapes slave traders thanks to a giraffe and then must free the giraffe to keep his word - but the animation is gorgeous.

And it was portrayed in a ""normal"" light. For kids?!?!?!?!?!? Then a few minutes later, the main character shouted, ""Damn cow"" very clearly. No thanks, not for kids. My husband, who watched the whole thing has more things that were questionable, but I wanted to put these things out there from just the very few minutes that I did watch!",1517443200,,478,4.505747126436781

It just never really took off for me.",1516579200,,242,4.785714285714286
