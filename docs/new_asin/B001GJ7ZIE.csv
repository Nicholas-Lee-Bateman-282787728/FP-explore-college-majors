8305634,1,B001GJ7ZIE,"I am almost embarrassed that I bought this piece of absolute NONSENSE !!  This had to be the cheapest-made DVD/ video I have EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE !!  The background music was comical....it was SO BAD !  The editing of this piece of garbage was done obviously done by a child....just SO BAD !!  But when the guy was explaining why he drew the lines and semi-circles on his map of Norway, that's when I about DIED from feeling absolutely RIPPED OFF !!  The entire rationale for him selecting his ""spots"" on his map, and SUDDENLY it becomes a ""666 Pentagram"" is just absolutely a JOKE !  His logic for his spots he selects make about as much sense as The Mad Hatter !  DUMB, STUPID, HORRIFICALLY MADE, POORLY EDITED, PATHETIC MUSIC, and ABSOLUTE STUPIDITY FOR TRYING DESPERATELY to make this, yet ANOTHER ""conspiracy theory"", but this time blaming Celtics for the conversion of the Vikings to adopt and worship the almighty ""666 Serpent""..... I want my money back !!",1504051200,,970,4.604651162790698
8305635,2,B001GJ7ZIE,Impossible to understand the dialogue with the loud back\ground music.,1480982400,,70,6.1
8305636,5,B001GJ7ZIE,"An incredible window into the ancients of Norway, who definitely knew their stuff. It's amazing how much they knew, and how their symbolism is still very relevant today. 666 is no less relevant today than it was in the Vikings day. It almost feels like communicating with them when you learn about their symbolic messages. They may not exist as they once did, but they have a very strong echo.",1374883200,,393,4.628571428571429
8305637,5,B001GJ7ZIE,To fully describe the contents of this dvd would ruin it for you so I won't do that. the revelations made here are quite stunning and not to be missed by any serious student of history or religion.,1374883200,2,197,4.2105263157894735
8305638,3,B001GJ7ZIE,"I found the scenery to be beautiful enough to make the film worthwhile for this alone. The film gave some some interesting information about Vikings and Celtic Christians.

However there is one real flaw in the calculations of the circle, the  ""666"" is stated in miles, whilst every other measure stated herein was metric, for example the elevation of the mount at 1666 meters above sea level. It seemed that the units of measure were chosen for the convenience of creating a ""mystical"" point rather than being consistent, or simply using whatever units were used in Norway in  the time when the churches mentioned were built, and thus when the odd-shaped pentagram was alleged to be constructed. Consistency in measure units would have made this much more convincing, but then, either the 666 MILES or the 1666 METERS would have to be eliminated from the narrative. Can't have it both ways. (Miles go with yards, feet, inches: Kilometers go with meters, etc.)

As others have stated, this was slow, and the music often drowned out the sound of the voice narrating, or the conversations telling the story. Also I found the sudden and frequent switching from heavy metal rock to choral angelic music distracting. (Perhaps was this irritating switching from devilish to angelic music was intended to keep the viewer awake through the slow parts?)

Still, I did find it interesting to watch and strained to hear all the way to the end of the film, so I took only one star away for the sound and one for the measure-unit mixing.",1326499200,2,1524,4.801526717557252
8305639,4,B001GJ7ZIE,"Along with all of the beautiful scenery of Norway in this film, I must say that I learned some pretty interesting theories after watching The Viking Serpent. I had no idea that Viking Kings and the Celtic Church were involved together.  It also felt a bit like a scavenger hunt as we explored old castles, caves and monasteries looking for symbols of ""good and evil"".  Of course, this documentary doesn't claim to be absolute scientific fact, but it was still interesting hearing the theories presented about snakes, pentagrams and the number 666.  I really enjoy films that help the viewer stretch their imagination, and this one certainly did!",1274486400,,645,4.953703703703703
8305640,3,B001GJ7ZIE,"Was the world once ruled by a serpent cult?  Do they still exist, these Viking/Celtic snake-worshippers?  I don't know and I'm not sure I care, but I still found this DVD enjoyable for the fabulous Scandinavian scenery, the romantic history and the feeling of adventure in first-hand discovery.

With the documentarians, we explore old castles, monasteries and caves, looking for pentangles and snaky iconography, mostly by sea, since this is how one gets around in Norway.

This isn't science, and the ""hidden"" symbols this film claims to uncover seem thin at best, but I enjoyed the journey so much that didn't bother me.  Especially for Viking fans, and I don't mean the football team.",1273622400,2,688,5.0
8305641,3,B001GJ7ZIE,This somewhat controversial film boldly looks at the evil lurking in the most unexpected places and history of the Celtic church.  Not my beliefs but interesting viewing.,1236902400,2,170,5.296296296296297
8305642,3,B001GJ7ZIE,"Author Harald Boehlke was planning a vacation when he discovered the Viking Serpent, beginning with two ""round churches"" on the same longitude. That begins a discussion of spiritual sites, Vikings vs. Celts vs. Catholics, and journeys over beautiful paths and waterways around Norway. What does it all mean? You'll have to make up your own mind.",1233705600,2,345,5.178571428571429
8305643,4,B001GJ7ZIE,This is an illuminating discovery made by Harald S. Boehlke. It revealed a pentagram connecting places of worship and that ancient societies worshiped serpents. I was fascinated by the fact that Viking Kings and the Celtic Church were involved together.,1233619200,,253,5.35
