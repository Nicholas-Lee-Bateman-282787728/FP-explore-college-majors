A mix of politics, satire, bloody violence, humor, slavery, business, guns, and  all around chance-taking cinema.  Upon first viewing, I admit I did not  care for the film.  After repeated viewings, I discovered the rhythm and  intentions of director Cox and his motley band of adventurers.  It actually  made me want to read more about this period and discover for myself how we,  as a country, STILL have not learned from history!  Great originality and  brave acting/direction makes this a film that will stand the test of time.  I recommend it to lovers of daring filmmaking/storytelling.

312368,5,6301024451,"Alex Cox often refers to ""Walker"" as his ""best but least-watched movie."" There is no question that the film is a master work -- the story is compelling, the cast is overflowing with talent, the script blends historical accuracy with poignant anachronisms, and the overall post-punk attitude prevents the film from becoming just another formulaic biopic.

There are two factors why this film is ""least watched,"" particularly in the U.S.: the film is a stark condemnation of American imperialism, and there really are no sympathetic characters. Regarding the former, the true story of William Walker's brutal conquest of Nicaragua is a dark chapter in America's history, and its retelling with so many A-list celebrities, particularly Ed Harris in the lead, makes many Americans guiltily uncomfortable. Regarding the latter, ""unsympathetic character"" movies is what Alex Cox has always done, and done very well.

The Criterion edition includes a fascinating commentary by Cox and writer Rudy Wulitzer that helps explain just how difficult it was to make the film given its artistic goals and socio-political ostracization in Hollywood. Another extra, a ""making of"" documentary that was shot during filming in the late '80s but not edited until the production of the new remaster, is equally fascinating. The extras alone should be ""required watching"" for film students.

People who prefer market-driven Hollywood blockbusters likely would hate this film, but a few may find its deliberate departure from the same-old, same-old intriguing and inspiring.",1380412800,3,1550,5.45

This film is brave, disturbing, provocative, charming, and ultimately genius, and is destined to be a cult favorite in years to come (thanks especially to this wonderful Criterion Collection release).

312371,5,6301024451,"I first viewed this film when I was doing background research for a biographical piece on William Walker, perhaps the most infamous of the filibusters of the 1850s, who were southerners seeking new territories into which to spread slavery in the years prior to the civil war. I can affirm that, with only a few exceptions, this film depicts these events accurately. The film begins with Walker's failed 1854 effort to seize control of Sonora in northern Mexico before moving on to his more ambitious 1856 effort to gain control of Nicaragua, which was in the midst of a civil war. Walker, brilliantly portrayed here by a dead-pan Ed Harris, was a man driven by complex motives, though the film most often has him giving voice to the rhetoric of Manifest Destiny, which rationalized American expansion under the guise of spreading democracy and regenerating decadent societies. Viewers must consider the context in which this film was made in order to appreciate the full depth of its numerous ironies and anachronisms - this was the decade during which the Reagan administration was engaged in a not-so-covert effort to undermine the left-wing Sandinista regime of Daniel Ortega, issuing hysterical warnings about the dangers that tiny Nicaragua posed to a nuclear-armed superpower (see the silly film ""Red Dawn"" (1984), in which Nicaraguans invade the United States). This film, made with the cooperation of the Sandinista regime, takes aim at the imperial tendency in missionary democracy, with often grimly hilarious results (See the scene which opens on a Nicaraguan village square, where Walker's men are whipping bound peasants, as Walker's narration explains that he has implemented ""cultural reforms."")As many critics have noted, anachronisms increase in frequency as the film proceeds, with Walker's men smoking Marlboros and drinking Coca-Cola among other things. The director does indulge in some time-compression (Walker's activities actually extended form 1854 through 1860) and the film climaxes with Walker's destruction of Granada, where the survivors of his bizarre army or either killed or evacuated by a U.S. military helicopter (which actually appears to be a Russian-built aircraft) that swoops down into the burning town at the last moment. The film ends with Walker's execution by firing squad on a Central American beach, an event that actually took place after his failed 1860 effort to seize control of what was to become British Honduras. This film is not without flaws and it's message is far from subtle, but there is a certain genius to it. Given Americans' general ignorance of their nation's history and current foreign policy, it's a shame that this film did not get wider exposure when it was released. One major strength of the film is a compelling soundtrack by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros - I also recommend purchasing this CD.",1353628800,7,2868,5.1965442764578835
312372,4,6301024451,"I'm trilled that I came across this film! I first read about William Walker in my Central America guide book. It had a page or so talking about Walker's exploits in Nicaragua and I found it too outrageous to believe. It turns out that he even burned my favorite Nicaraguan town, Granada to the ground! The book recommend that I watch Alex Cox's ""Walker"" for more of the story. After viewing ""Walker"" I have no problems admitting that it's entertaining film that is masterfully presented by Cox's directing, but I won't go so far as to say that it stands as the definitive biography of the man. Instead ""Walker"" gives us his basic history(He was educated man of fortune, recruited by Vanderbilt to secure Nicaragua for his shipping canal ambitions)

  After the introduction, Cox uses Walker as a figure to convey ideas of misguided American idealism and entitlement. He shows Walker as cold and calculating while forcing his will on the locals which he thinks are grateful for his rule. ""Walker"" is stylized and sensationalized, and if you're looking for the complete story of William Walker this isn't the film for you. If you're a fan of film then you should diffidently watch this art house gem. Ed Harris is perfectly cast as Walker and it's fun to watch he and his men descend into power hungry hysteria.

312373,2,6301024451,"I had never heard of William Walker until following some links recently from a page on the Monroe Doctrine, and once I had read his short online bio I was fascinated. I'll have to read some of the books about him, but this film was readily available to watch so it came first. I knew it would be a leftist statement film since it starred Ed Harris, made during Reagan's term, and reviewers said it was a black comedy. I found the film very good until it breaks down to art house material about 2/3 in, then it totally degenerated in search of an ending. I'm happy they made something about the man though, he seems to have been quite the adventurer and I find real life stories to make the best adventure tales. 2 of 5, wish it had stayed more on point, but it was made for a political reason not as a historic biopic. I encourage you to look his bio up online (Walker's that is), it's quite a tale.

It did a bit better on video release but not much,which is a shame. The movie is a historic black comedy that's both anachronistic and compelling in its execution. Its still amazing to me that this was even green-lighted by the powers in Hollywood. Made in Nicaragua with a stellar cast led by Ed Harris it holds up quite well today. Bloody,violet,and at times simply hilarious in its absurdity, this movie rocks. Hopefully now remastered superbly on DVD,it will(if there is any justice in the universe) find a whole new generation that will get it. I loved this movie in '88 and I love it even more now.
They simply don't make crazy,surreal,political westerns like this anymore. I would argue that Walker is one of the most brilliant and entertaining flicks ever made.""nuff said""",1249603200,5,921,4.726708074534161
312375,5,6301024451,"Alex Cox saw his popularity in Hollywood keel over in 1987 with the one-two punch of his punk spaghetti western STRAIGHT TO HELL and his hallucinatory and strangely entertaining political satire WALKER. Telling the true story of William Walker, a Tennessee fillibuster who embarked for Nicaragua in the late 19th century with a small army of crminals and mercenaries in tow and the intention of conquering the nation to open it's ports up to shipping tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt, Cox uses Walker's little-known story to launch a scathing critique of the Reagan administration's genocidal foreign policy towards Central America in the 1980's. Historical accuracy is not what the director is interested in here. People drive modern cars and read TIME magazine (with Walker on the cover) while helicopters descend into burning Nicaraguan towns with State Department officials in tow. If Cox had filmed a straight historical epic he might have made some money and garnered some respect in the show business circles, but then he wouldn't be the Alex Cox we all know and love: the giggling film geek/cinematic anarchist who delights in tearing down all the tired Hollywood cliches and conventions in order to craft his own wonderous outlaw art. REPO MAN and SID & NANCY may be the filmmaker's most respected and accessible films, but I think it's high time WALKER got a reappraisal. The movie is a beautiful and messy collision of many eclectic elements. The expertly assembled cast headed by a masterful Ed Harris in the title role and also includes the Cox repertory company featuring Sy Richardson, Xander Berkely, Miguel Sandoval, Dick Rude, and Zander Schloss all in typically wild top form. Peter Boyle chews and spits out the scenery as the contemptuous tycoon Vanderbilt. Richard Masur, Marlee Matlin, Rene Auberjonois, John Diehl, and LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE director Alfonso Arau. The late, great Joe Strummer of The Clash composes a excellent score with a strong Latin flavor and nary an orchestral flourish. For anybody willing to take a chance and discover a great and underappreciated filmmaker at the peak of his powers giving the screw to the Hollywood system, WALKER is a treasure that yields many rewards upon repeat viewings. I can't recommend this baby enough.",1245715200,4,2275,5.1347708894878705
312376,3,6301024451,"This is a little known film directed by Alex Cox and well worth watching. I was Production Manager for the Tucson location. This film is filled with Anachronism's,i. e., all sorts of modern items creep into a film that supposedly took place in the 1800's. It is a sleeper and fun to watch.",1219881600,,289,4.471698113207547
312397,5,6301024451,"Walker is an unconventional biopic that effectively burned any remaining bridges Alex Cox had with Hollywood. He took a modest amount of studio money and made a film about William Walker, an opportunistic American who invaded Nicaragua and became its president from 1855 to 1857, instituting slavery which didn't go over too well with the locals, and he was eventually executed in 1860. Cox wasn't interested in making a traditional biopic and, with screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer, decided to include the occasional modern anachronism (Walker appears on the covers of Newsweek and Time; a Mercedes drives past a horse-drawn carriage) to give the film a satirical howl of protest against the Reagan administration's support of the contra war against the democratically elected Sandinista government. This did not endear Cox to his studio backers.

Cox sets an absurdist tone and never looks back. This is evident in Walker's first battle in Nicaragua. As his men are gunned down in the street, he brazenly walks through seemingly oblivious to the carnage going on around him. He takes refuge in a building and plays the piano as bullets whiz around him. It's a crazy scene but works because of Ed Harris' conviction. He portrays Walker as a self-important, power-hungry madman with characteristic charismatic intensity.

Cox actually had the chutzpah to make Walker in Nicaragua with the approval of the Sandinista government which demonstrates just how far he was willing to put his money (or rather the studio's) where his mouth was. The filmmaker adopts a very playful attitude as he gleefully deconstructs the biopic (much as he shredded the spaghetti western and gangster film genres in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Straight-to-Hell/dp/B000059POZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Straight to Hell</a>) in such an off-kilter way that had never been done before and rarely attempted since (perhaps Kevin Spacey's take on Bobby Darin in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-the-Sea/dp/B00094ARN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond the Sea</a>&nbsp;or Tony Scott's gonzo take on Domino Harvey in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Domino-Widescreen-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B000CQQIDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Domino (Widescreen New Line Platinum Series)</a>). However, Walker remains a cinematic oddity as he applies the punk aesthetic to the biopic, making a political statement about the abuse of power that is eerily relevant today as it was in 1987.

There is an audio commentary by director Alex Cox and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer. The two men talk about how they took a traditional historical narrative and proceeded to break all of its rules. They praise Joe Strummer's emotional score and touch upon the mood it creates. Cox is funny and full of energy with Wurlitzer providing his own laconic take on the film.

""On Moviemaking and the Revolution"" is an audio excerpt from an extra on the film who recounts their experiences and providing a snapshot of the crazy atmosphere of filming on location.

""Dispatches from Nicaragua"" is a 50-minute retrospective look at the making of Walker. It provides the historical context in which Cox made his film. There are all kinds of great behind-the-scenes footage of the filmmaker and his cast and crew hard at work. We see what a logistical nightmare this film was and the challenges of shooting in Nicaragua.

There is another extra where Cox quotes from and responds to the scathing reviews of his film from back when it first came out.

""The Immortals"" features two still galleries, one of behind-the-scenes photographs taken on the set and Polaroids of various cast members in costume.

Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.",1202688000,26,3808,5.7875
312398,3,6301024451,"Best remembered (if at all) as the film that comprehensively destroyed Alex Cox's mainstream career, it's hard to see what caused such vitriolic offense at the time. Cox and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer's take on the unbalanced self-deceiving `idealist' mercenary William Walker's intervention in Nicaragua to protect Cornelius Vanderbilt's financial interests there, setting off a century of disastrous American interference, is not particularly subtle, but then William Walker wasn't exactly a subtle man (""Clearly this is no ordinary ***hole,"" judges one of the more astute locals). With a visual style clearly inspired by spaghetti westerns and Sam Peckinpah, a contradictory narration - what you hear isn't what you see, with Walker's own third person narration frequently completely at odds with the farcical reality - and a slew of critic infuriating anachronisms, it was received with a mixture of outrage and contempt that makes the critical reception of Domino look like a triumph of Schindler's List proportions.

It's not a great movie, but it's certainly not the disaster its been painted, and even the at first jarring anachronisms are fun - Walker gets the cover of both Time and Newsweek, interviewers use tape recorders while Vanderbilt has a computer displaying stock market prices in his office - but perhaps should have been introduced earlier: however, there's no doubting the pertinence of the final arrival of trigger-happy helicopter gunships to evacuate the US citizens. Harris is on fine self-righteous form as the `short idealist,' short on ideals but big on a sense of divine purpose even though he has no idea what that purpose actually is from one moment to the next.

Whle this has been available for some time on Region 2 in a version with no extras, Criterion have certainly put together an impressive package of new extras for a film that was for so long held in such unwarranted disdain - though be warned that the theatrical trailer and the featurette of Cox ruefully going through the film's savage reviews are both well hidden (if you want to know where to find them, click the comments link on this review). It's not perfect by any means, but there's too much that's interesting about the film to dismiss it entirely out of hand.",1199404800,15,2445,5.079601990049751
312399,4,6301024451,"Alex Cox's Walker is certainly an odd period film. It is ostensively set in the middle of the 19th Century, but with dialogue that alters between period realism and modern slang, characters speaking English to Spanish speakers and Spanish to speakers who claim to know only English, a contemporary music sound track by Joe Strummer, anachronistic modern technologies (like computer screens, a luxury sedan, and even a helicopter) showing up at odd moments without any explanation and barely registering surprise in the characters. The action scenes are almost hallucinatory, with freeze frames and tight closeups cut at a kinetic pace. William Walker, as played here by Ed Harris, has little of the cold but amused and calculating cunning that the same historical figure inspired in Gillo Pontecorvo's brilliant film Burn!, there played by Marlon Brando. Here, Ed Harris's William Walker is not so much ruthless in his mastery of situations as overly confident and fearless (or desperately naive), incapable of being moved from a position he has once decided.

The anachronisms, and especially those that appear in the ending of the film, make clear that Cox is not really aiming to recreate a historical period here so much as put on display the ruthless and unabashed idealism (indistinguishable from arrogance) that Americans have and continue to display as announced in the doctrine of manifest destiny, that we have the God-given right to rule all of the Americas and to spread American style democracy (which in the terms of this film is clearly taken to mean governmentally sanctioned corporate control of all foreign markets and resources) throughout the world. The explicit parallel the film draws is between Walker's invasion of Nicaragua and the United States military intervention in Central America during the Reagan era (but more contemporary parallels could easily be found). As the film suggests, we liberate in order to put in place governments that are willing to sell their national goods to foreign companies, and we support those governments until they begin to exercise the autocratic authority we give them in their own interests (whether as tyrants or as servants of the people is irrelevant) and against foreign corporations. (It is interesting to note that in Burn! William Walker was the agent of this strategy, and in this film he becomes a disposable element of this strategy.) What may mar the film is that it is a bit heavy-handed about this message, but its boldness also makes it exciting -- it is rare these days that films are willing to take such an explicit stand against contemporary policies.

It remains an important film, and as always, Criterion has packed the single disc with cool extras, including a feature length documentary on the making of the film, reminiscences by extras, behind-the-scenes photos, an a booklet of essays on the film.",1199318400,11,2885,5.136170212765958

A political response to Reagan's invasion of Nicaragua in the 1980's, Cox uses satire and stark, stunning imagery to portray America as an imperialist nation blinded by manifest destiny. Set in 1855, Harris plays a humanitarian public figure sent by a capitalist to settle Nicaragua and bring the country democracy. Similar to Napoleon of ""Animal Farm,"" Harris eventually becomes a power hungry and merciless tyrant who betrays every principle he once stood for.

There is a certain madness in creativity but this thing is just plane loony. Never mind the topless senioritas doing laundery in the stream as Walker's men walk by. That could be  historicly accurate. Not much else is.

Harris comes across both a clueless gringo who can't understand the abusive verbal insults his native mistress politely whispers in his ears  in Spanish in the tone of sweet nothings and a lunatic with delusions of grandeur but the way this film comes across I suspect the directer for being more clueless and with deeper insanity. I try to see the activities of William Walker but there are too many scenes of questionable value.

It's really no wonder that Walker is hard to find in the ""Land of the Free"" as it warns us all that our freedoms come through a price that someone somewhere else is paying right now. This movie should be shown to anyone who can't remember what it was like when Americans had the cajones to look in the mirror and admit the truth. God bless Alex Cox.",1143244800,4,1491,4.908366533864542

Ed Harris is brilliant as is the supporting cast of knock-offs who join his rag tag army on their quest for glory in central america.  the blurring of the timeline reminds us that our  meddling in C.A. is fundamentally not much different today than it was  during the period this movie depicts.

The movie builds a hypnotic power until the final scenes, when the town is burning at night  and Joe Strummer's music is playing on the soundtrack. It's a drawn out, mesmerizing scene.

To be clear, Alex Cox's career did not go down the toilet because he made this movie or because he made straight to hall. What happened is he worked during the Hollywood writers strike (87 or 88, I forget which) and he was immediately placed on the ""DO NOT HIRE"" list of all major studios. He's been on it ever since. Basically, he was blacklisted.",1523923200,,784,4.514084507042254

7809730,1,6301024451,"This is a really terrible film. There is no real script to speak of. The direction is non-existent. There cast is full of good actors who are not used well at all. It has the appearance of Alex Cox throwing a party in Central America for friends and family. Its hard to believe that this is the Alex Cox who had previously done some good films. In the commentary, writer and director attempt to explain away the flaws of the film as being ""unconventional"" storytelling choices. But strictly speaking, that makes no sense. Its more of an actors improv workshop than a film.

The script is a collection of one-off junk scenes where Harris (as Walker) is really the only person who matters as an actor. Walker typically gives set-piece speeches or re-enacts semi-historical moments. But often the speeches are recitations seemingly from period accounts or the historical record. The other actors are generally allowed only to re-act to Harris when they get any dialogue at all. Its almost a film done in the style of narration but with the main character as narrator. Rather than being unconventional, the choices simply make the film stiff and wooden. Accomplished actors are wasted. Harris is to a large degree wasted.

As a political statement it fails because it lacks anything political to really say. Other than the bleeding obvious. He reaches out of the time period with occasional references just to hammer home the obvious points already being made. Cox is also deluded in thinking that nobody had ever heard of Walker before his film. I guess he must never have heard Brando's film ""Burn!"" or lots of other things.

The commentary provided is extremely interesting. Its amusing to listen to Cox defend his laziness or bad ideas as artistic choices. There is a scene during the standoff in Mexico where they brag about all the actions written for all 15 characters moving around the set. Then he makes a telling comment about how much ""work"" it would have been to break everything on into scenes & shots. That it was so much better artistically to just send the camera on a lazy walk through the action. Cox then brags about how *after* Walker he *only* did shots for the next ten years in the same lazy style. He doesn't say of course that he afterward used that style because he was working on shoestring budgets.

The films ends in an expensive rather aimless night scene with a whole lot of burning. But Cox and the screenwriter explain that what the film was ""really all about"" was a bunch of war footage buried in the tail end of the credits that few likely even saw and that fewer still would have even understood. Part of the problem, as apparent in the commentary, was that these people were making the film for themselves. They all have within their own heads a deeper context for most everything, but the problem is that to a viewer of the film, all that context is going to be invisible. In the behind-the-scenes material, its clear that the actors know far more about their characters than the audience is ever told through the film. Characters with names & backstory played by not-untalented actors are used as if they were extras.

There is an interesting commentary by a minor member of the cast. His commentary is actually better than the film. He talks about getting typhoid and how most of the cast was sick during the film. He is honest, bitter and rather cynical. But its all interesting stuff. Far more interesting than anything Cox had to say on the official commentary.

What is presented is not an aesthetic, its just a badly made mess. Cox is still convinced that the film was done in by politics and audiences not understanding. But in fact, many did understand and just saw it as a poor film. The best thing to compare it to is perhaps Dennis Hopper's ""The Last Movie"" which had a similar dedication to bad film craft and was similar in effectively destroying the career of the director.

The film would make good classroom material as far as explaining why certain rules in filmmaking exist and what the consequences are to breaking those rules in terms of creating a watchable or workable film. Ed Harris deserves credit for trying to so hard to make a script that gave him nothing to work with work out in some way. But for his performance, the film could have been far worse.",1427587200,,4314,4.660972404730618

7809732,5,6301024451,"This movie will largely not make any damn sense to anyone not thoroughly initiated in the study of military filibusterism and the history of Latin American interventionism.  If you are conversant in those topics, this movie will blow your mind.  In my mind this movie is the perfect sibling to Woody Allen's classic film Bananas.

If you are not up on those topics, it should still be very watchable as a character study.  Also, it will appeal to movie nerds for the director's Werner-Herzog-esque willingness to get weird within the context of a non-fiction subject.  (I don't think it is an accident that Cox went on to direct Fear & Loathing, a film who's real life subject is treated in the same way).",1416528000,,705,4.699186991869919
7809733,2,6301024451,"This is truly a horrifying film. Not in the sense of the content, but in terms of it's delivery.
There was a period in the 1980's where men sought to make terrible films about dark times and make them tolerable to watch by introducing surreal elements.
The fact is, it actually makes the contents somewhat grotesque. One could argue this is the point, but is actually just a horrible experience. There is no real point to this film. You don't learn anything useful about history, you don't enjoy it, and you feel like a worse person from watching it.
It is only at the very end, during the credits, that one realises the director was trying to make a serious political point  about the united state's involvement in nicuaragua in general, and by then it is far, far too late.
Overall I would not recommend watching this. Ever. Do yourself a favour and pick up an actual history book, instead. You will do yourself and nicuaragua justice by doing so. Watching this film will only make you feel sick, and stupid.",1410566400,,1010,4.580110497237569

This film was done in Nicaragua during the 1980s and all the strife,between the US and the Sandinistas. There is a bit of prejudice here and I wonder how the film and all the American actors got in with the embargo on travel? A definite statement on America's way of doing business with gunboat diplomacy,Smedly Butler would be proud! The zippos are a nice touch, remember the burning of notches in Vietnam Nam?
