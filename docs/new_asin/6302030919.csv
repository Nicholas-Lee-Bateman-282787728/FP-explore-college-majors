416498,5,6302030919,"I've always loved this film.  It has great dialog, great casting, great production and direction. Carrie Fisher wrote the screeplay based on her book, and her commentary on the film is very insightful, honest and funny.  She discusses her rehab from drug addiction and her relationship with her mother, Debbie Reynolds.  She points how the film differs from her real relationships with her family, discusses the writing process and how she had never written a screenplay before and wasn't sure how to do.  And, of course, she's very funny on top of everything else.  Buy the movie because its a good movie.  The commentary is the icing on the cake.",994118400,,648,4.845454545454546
416499,4,6302030919,"""Postcards From The Edge"" is by all means an autobiographical account of a very chaotic period in actress Carrie Fisher's life.  Her inspirations for her debut novel (originally published in October of '89) were her personal experiences in a drug rehabilitation center surmounting a cocaine habit, the relationship between she and her screen-veteran mother Debbie Reynolds and, generally, her wry perspective of life itself.  However, instead of sharing her mordant musings as the main character, Fisher created her counterpart in a character named Suzanne Vale (Streep).  Vale is a rising talent in the film industry with - surprise - an addiction to cocaine.  She has other indulgences as well and one day pops pills until the inevitable occurs - she is rushed to Cedars Sinai emergency room to have her stomach pumped.  Upon her near-death experience, she is committed to rehab and makes a deal with her director Lowell Kershak (Hackman): stay sober, get paid.  Of course, this is a grueling period not only because Suzanne is trying to curb her addiction but also because part of the deal involves living with her mother Doris Mann (MacLaine), an aging starlet who is eccentric, overburdening and an occasional alcoholic.
Meryl Streep said while reading Fisher's acerbic but earnest screenplay that she immediately fell in love with the story from a single line uttered by her character during her struggle with sobriety: ""I know my life is good - I just can't feel it."" Streep undertakes one of her more complex roles; using Fisher's insight on the driving force behind drug dependence and building from her own interpretation, she portrays Suzanne as a conflicted but staunch individual struggling to gain a sense of authority over her own life.  Although the role of Suzanne called for a serious dramatic depiction, Fisher's dry humor and Streep's impeccable comedic timing make her conflict frivolous and fun to watch.  Director Mike Nichols (Regarding Henry, Working Girl, Biloxi Blues) had brought out the best in Streep before - she earned an Academy Award nomination in his 1983 film ""Silkwood"" as the title character.  He proved once again to be her good luck charm when Streep caught the Academy's attention for the ninth time, earning her seventh nomination for Best Actress.
Nichols also enlisted Shirley MacLaine as Doris Mann, Vale's brazen mother.  She had already been intimately acquainted with the role of an oppressive parent, winning an Oscar for her endearing performance as Aurora Greenway in ""Terms Of Endearment"".  This bawdy, russet-tressed thespian has a long resume; although she has portrayed many a character, she gives Doris a much-needed spark combated by a unique sensitivity, making her performance a markedly impressive one.  This is a sorely underrated role, overshadowed by critically acclaimed performances of her past.
Gene Hackman and Dennis Quaid make for entertaining supporting roles as Jack Faulkner and Lowell Kershak, respectively.  Quaid is adept at playing the smug spinster and therefore makes his character easy to despise.  Hackman, a refined player with credits like ""Target"", ""Mississippi Burning"" and ""The Firm"" plays a hard-edged but sympathetic film director who is willing to forgive and forget, knowing that Suzanne has so much more to offer to the film industry.
Both MacLaine and Streep get a chance to boast their musical theater skills - Shirley sings a lively rendition of ""I'm Still Here"", a song by Stephen Sondheim that the man himself amended with personalized lyrics especially for her.  Streep sings the languid Ray Charles classic ""You Don't Know Me"" and at the very end of the film belts a country-western tune ""I'm Checking Out"" written by Shel Silverstein with little-known Canadian rockers Blue Rodeo in accompaniment.
When Fisher was asked to write the screenplay for her novel, the producers wanted the film to focus more intimately upon Vale's relationship with her mother, even though much of the content of her book dealt with her tenure in rehab. Fisher didn't mind the change but much of the facts were slightly exaggerated not only for the drama but the comedy as well.  People will find this out as well as several other factoids while listening to Fisher's gravelly voiceover during the commentary mode.  It's almost as if one is sitting in the very room with Fisher while watching the movie, cracking odd jokes and having a drink or two.  Her dry wit is unique and distinctive, making it easy for the audience to realize and identify with the overall philosophy of the film.
On the whole, ""Postcards From The Edge"" is an endearing portrait of the impenetrable bond between mother and daughter and, coming from Fisher's point-of-view, a quirky and poignant portrait indeed.",993772800,2,4760,5.135834411384217
416500,5,6302030919,"Anyone who has dealt with any substance escapism-or overbearing mothers-need to revisit this movie. Just try to catch all the humorous interactions you might not have caught the first time between stars McClain and Streep as a famous aging movie star who drinks and her actress daughter dealing with drug abuse.  Based on Carrie Fisher's novel, if ""rationalization is part of the addiction"" then watching McClain (""Now I just drink I like an Irish Person"" and Streep (""Well, the behavior may have been suicidal...but I am not!) have great one liners supporting this notion.  Don't all of us one day or another think Streep's line ""Well...I'm glad I've gotten sober so that I am hyper-concious for this series of humiliations!"" Mike Nichols says that he shoots every scene by asking himself ""How does it really happen??""  With cameos by Rob Riener, Richard Dreyfuss and Gene Hackman you get some of the best films moments acteds by pros; supporting roles taken by future stars Oliver Platt and Annette Bening are also funny but brief.",992563200,3,1033,4.959537572254336
416501,4,6302030919,"This movie was such a refreshing change for Meryl Streep.  She truly shined in a brillant comedic performance as Suzanne Vale, a middle-aged movie actress struggling with drug addiction, her relationship with her aloof mother (Shirley MacLaine) and the challenges of day to day life.  What impressed me the most about Meryl Streep is that you get to see her as a normal, frumpy woman.  Basically, someone you could relate to and sympathize with.  Finally, you get a chance to see Meryl in a film that doesn't take place in some era/period with extravagant costumes and accents.  Ofcourse, many of you already know that this film is based on actress, Carrie Fisher's, bestselling book of the same name.  The dialogue is so witty and fresh that I envy all the actors who got to opportunity to bring the words to life.  One of my favourite scenes is between Suzanne and her mother on the staircase.  In the scene, Suzanne confronts her mother about giving her sleeping pills when she was a child.  She also confronts her about holding her back.  A few memorable lines:  ""You don't want me to be a singer.  You're the singer, you're the performer.  I can't possible compete with you.  What if somebody won ?  You want me to do well, just not better than you.""  I love that scene.  It even gets more histerical when her mother defends herself about the ""birthday party incident"".  A memorable line:  ""I did not lift my skirt.  IT TWIRLED UP !!"".  Then the scene of reconciliation in the hospital.  Some memorable lines:  ""You know what dear ?  I think I'm jealous of you.  And that is because it being your turn and all.  And I find it difficult to face that my time is almost up.""  Both of the Oscar-winning actresses bring such life and energy to their characters.  For this film, Meryl Streep was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar and Golden Globe.  Shirley MacLaine was nominated for a British Academy Award and Golden Globe.  Don't pass up this fantastic comedy from director Rob Reiner (Misery, A Few Good Men).",989193600,13,2013,4.636363636363637
416502,5,6302030919,"What I personally found amazing about ""Postcards from the Edge"" was its unexpected ability to hit home themes and issues that all of us deal with, day in and day out.  Meryl Streep's amazing performance registered for me most in how ""ordinary"" she made this character.  McClaine's over the top and still profoundly rich performance is the perfect foil for Streep's character.  But the film's most extraordinary quality is in developing profound themes about parenting and relationships with those you love the most in life.  We don't yearn for Suzanne's rich celebrity filled existence.  Instead, we relate to it, and can easily place ourselves in her situation.  That's Streep's greatest achievement - every step of the way, she's real and familiar to us.  She is us.  McClaine's mother is all our mothers.  Not unlike the superior ""All ABout My Mother"" Pedro Almovodar's great film about loss and redemption, Poscards also confronts many of the same issues, though in flesh and blood.  As if reminding us that unlike Esteban in ""Mother"" we are still living and have the opportunity to do something to work the issues through.  ""Postcards"" stands as a rich character study of life as most of us know it - the struggle for independence as teens and young adults, the need to prove ourselves in the shadows of our parents (or mentors, or friends, or spouses) and the very real risks involved in making choices that might seem trivial at the time.  Streep brings us on this journey and in return, we can use these lessons in our own somewhat bland lives.  A deep and rich examination of the mother-daughter dynamic that represents the parent-child in all of us.  Best moment:  McClaine at the top of the stairs proclaiming ""I didn't lift it up!  It TWIRRRRLLLED UP!""",987120000,,1764,4.849498327759197

416762,2,6302030919,"TWO STARS for the Blu-ray release, not the film itself, which deserves all five stars, and a better Blu-ray release.

This film is a masterful representation of several artists at the top of their form...Superb performances from Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine, outstanding direction from the great Mike Nichols, and the witty screenplay by Carrie Fisher adapted from her own best-selling novel, which reflected a thinly-veiled version of her own experiences. A triumph at the box-office, the movie holds up wonderfully after all these years, and is all the more poignant in light of the heartbreaking loss of Ms. Fisher and her mother Debbie Reynolds in recent months.

This Sony-owned film is long overdue for Blu-ray release, and I was a bit on the fence of buying it, as Sony themselves did not release it. Instead, it was among hundreds of titles that Sony decided to sub-license to Mill Creek Entertainment, whose reputation for 98% of their releases being of poor quality made me hesitant to purchase. The price at $14.98 list was reasonable, and I had hoped that Sony provided Mill Creek with a good quality master of this great film, which would make for a great Blu-ray.

They did not.

Instead this Blu-ray is as mediocre as can be. It is no better than watching the old DVD upconverted on your HDTV.  Most of the time the picture is soft, with occasional damage showing up, unimpressive audio, and a low bit-rate.

The tell-tale sign of this being an old, dated master that was slapped on a Blu-ray by Mill Creek was the ""Sony Pictures Television"" logo that comes at the end of the film. Yes folks, an old master for TV was the source for this Blu-ray mess. Sony's Columbia Pictures library is filled with hundreds of terrible low-budget films. Why they threw this gem into a licensing deal to a bargain-bin outfit like Mill Creek is beyond my understanding.

If you love this film and have it on DVD, stay away from this Blu-ray travesty.

If you don't have the film, buy the DVD to get the commentary, and the picture quality will be virtually identical to the Blu-ray.",1487116800,13,2085,4.740331491712707

Con: Transfer is not great quality. At times I wondered if it was actually an SD upscale, though some shots make it clear that it is not.

Only extra on the Blu Ray is Fisher's 2001 DVD commentary, which is wonderful, but really the bare minimum they could do. Anniversary edition DVD doesn't even have that.

It's a shame that no one who held the rights thought it important enough to do a proper release while Fisher and Reynolds were still alive to participate.",1486425600,4,552,4.7894736842105265

417497,4,6302030919,"In memory of Carrie Fisher I wanted to view something that was hers. I watched her last interview with Graham Norton this month, December, 2016, and decided to take another view of this film. Meryl Streep plays Carrie in Carrie Fisher's book of her addiction. Shirley Mc Laine plays her mother. It is the age old story of the once famous woman taken over by her daughter, the ego cannot be left at the door.

This film starts out so well with the scenes of addiction and rehab, and then saunters into a film of mother versus daughter. Mike Nichols directed this film, and it is good. Scenes of a once famous actress now being told many times a day how to act and react. Mother and managers all nagging until we finally get to a nitty gritty scene. Great performances all.

How very sad that Debbie Reynolds has to bury her daughter. How sad that Carrie's daughter has to bury her mother. How very sad that all of us have to lose Carrie Fisher, an original if there ever was one.

417607,4,6302030919,"I don't even have to say that Meryl Streep is the best actress that is now living in this world.
And also Mike Nichols is one of the few director who really knows how to controll actors well as a Hollywood filmmaker who just passed away in 2014.
But this movie didn't met my taste that well.
As usual, Meryl Streep and her mother(Mother's roll) Shirley MacLaine were all good.
And althouth small rolls only but Gene Hackman, Richard Dreyfuss, Dennis Quaid were all charming to look at.
But something is missing in this film.
Some people are saying that we should know more about the actual charactor of the woman who was played by Meryl Streep (Suzanne Vale is the name) but I don't think that way.
The movie should be understood by the movie itself. If it cannot be appealed to the audience just because they didn't know the background story of the main charactor, then that movie is a failure.

The main charactor has problems with drugs because of her famous actress mother played by Shirley MacLaine who is an alcoholic all her life. She was influenced by her according to her thought and that's why her life was so miserable. Also she is an actress too and just because of her mother's fame, she can always got the luck enough to keep act, she was more miserable. That made her having more drugs.

But then again, it is her life. There is no excuse for that. She is the one who should control her life not her mother.
According to her mother, she sang well from her childhood and as we see, she sure does sings well. Maybe she should have had concentrated as being a singer instead.

The ending was her singing in front of all the people of her mother's friends and she sang beautifully.
She seemed so happy at the end. Maybe she will find a way to live a better way from then on but it was not concrete enough for the audience to what this film is really about.
I can guess why this film was kind of failed at  the boxoffice back then. But still it earned almost 40,000,000 $ soley from the US which was not that bad bad.
I think the star power made it possible.

417704,5,6302030919,"Excellent movie about maternal narcissism and its effects. So many great lines in here, I had to wonder if the writer's knew about maternal narcissism quite extensively. They hit so much with all the great dialogue, even going so far with Gene Hackman's character proclaiming that this type of abuse goes, ""all the way back to Eve."" At least that bit of dialogue takes on on the wounding of the Feminine in many cultures going way back.

Annette Bening's cameo appearance was also joyful to watch. Meryl Streep and Shirley McLaine deliver fine and extremely exaggerated performances in comedic fashion that also tackle the seriousness of their mother-daughter issues. However, I do not believe maternal narcissism has such happy Hollywood endings as this film seemed to have, but it may depict the love-hate relationship between mother and daughter in such strained relationships.",1442016000,,880,5.197183098591549

Carrie Fisher (Star Wars) penned the novel and wrote the screenplay.  Then in 1990 director Mike Nichols made the marvelous decision to put it on the big screen.  Now available on your little or not so little, as the case may be, home screen.

This cute movie is based on a woman trying to break into show business following her mother's famous shadow.

Who doesn't love Shirley MacLaine (Steel Magnolias) who plays the mother or Meryl Streep (Out of Africa) who plays the daughter?  Apart they are genius actresses but put them together in a movie!  A genius match made in heaven.

Dysfunctional, funny and sad.

Watch this movie and see the mayhem transpire and lessons learned.

418037,5,6302030919,"This must be my third copy of 'Postcards from the Edge' - first one was a VHS tape (I just wore it out with overuse) then the next one was locally bought here in Australia - but that got pinched by one of my adopted Bhutanese kids and it has since vanished into the extended family. I was informed at every local DVD store it was ""no longer available"" and so I looked to the internet and eventually found it on Amazon ('eventually' - probably took ten minutes).

I love this film for so many reasons; the insight into Hollywood is one major reason - seeing Meryl Streep in anything is always a great thing. I love Shirley MacLaine when she is playing an American particularly if she is singing as well as acting. Like Shirl, I seriously do not understand why she wasn't given an Academy Award for her role as Doris in this semi-autobiographic film written by Carrie Fisher (at least a nomination).

Three things: (1)It is a greatly made film all around with some very good camera work and editing - and(B)it reminds me in so many ways of Edina and Saffron Monsoon from the BBC TV series 'Absolutely Fabulous' although it's far from that in reality I think the two products are kindred spirits and also the commentary from Carrie Fisher on this Amazon bought copy is truly wonderful. I like Carrie Fisher, she's funny in a laconically sweet way - like a rusty first car you don't want to part with even though it makes odd sounds as you take her out for a drive.

The story is obviously based on someone's real life, and then ramped up somewhat for 'poetic license'. I have always loved anything where Meryl Streep sings - from 'The Deer Hunter' through to 'Ironweed' and here she has two numbers that she delivers with gusto. MacLaine also delivers a wonderful number and manages to even take (what we say here in Australia) the piss out of herself... as much as anything. I think the film was dumped on a little by critics for being ""too Hollywood"" - but rest assured that those of us who love the movies and haven't lived or visited in Hollywood don't give a 'rat's' about that.

It is entertaining and has a strong message to deliver. With Carrie Fisher adding her reflective insights and opinions in the commentary it's doubly wonderful. One of my favourite (the spelling is different here in Australia) things to do is sit and watch 'Soapdish' (featuring Carrie Fisher) and then 'Postcards from the Edge' - it's a great comedy double for my money (time is money) - so I am very very happy to have found the disc on Amazon and all the more delighted that there's the wonderful Carrie chattering away about a variety of things along for the showing.

It is too much to ask if I have a particular favourite (see above) film - because I love so many films - but I quite often cite this one as my favourite (I've miked that enough) mainly because it makes me laugh and I always enjoy the story of a recovering drug addict and her alcoholic(ish) mother both in the movie industry and both competing for attention in their own special way.

It must be twenty odd years old as a film, but it speaks to me today as clearly as it did when I saw it in the cinema during it's theatrical release - just say ""No"" to drugs is the message ultimately - but there are plenty of other messages about relationships in there as well - and it is funny!",1350345600,12,3335,4.414634146341464

The second time I saw it on its original release, in Orange County, CA, my friend and I were the only ones laughing through the whole movie.  (Did the audience think it was a documentary?)  Now it's the movie I watch whenever I need a pick me up.  The movie satirizes Hollywood and show business, but also reflects (in a funny way) on their impact on the real lives of the people within that bubble. The best part about movie though is Streep's two musical numbers - the first, ""You Don't Know Me,"" reluctantly sung at the insistence of MacLaine's character at a surprise party, and a rousing ""I'm Checkin' Out"" (from this heartbreak hotel) at the end -- are wonderful.  Of course the writing by Carrie Fisher is what makes the movie.  (This movie led to her career as a ""script doctor"" in Hollywood.)  One of my favorite movies.",1326499200,,1052,4.505263157894737
418041,3,6302030919,"Funny, charming and comforting in all the right places, `Postcards from the Edge' is nearly perfect thanks to some sharp dialog, marvelous chemistry and a relaxed internal flow. While the film certainly forces the ending (ugh, I hate it when good films tack cheap endings on in lazy attempts at resolving all problems before the credits role) it makes a real go at getting there, and so much good is found in every nook and cranny up to that horrendously clich closing.

Kiss, kiss...thanks; all better now.

The film, adapted from Carrie Fisher's semi-autobiographical yet wholly fictional novel, tells the story of mother/daughter stars Suzanne Vale and Doris Mann. Suzanne is the pill popping daughter, grade-A actress who is burning bridges and ruining her reputation because of her drug abuse. Doris is the alcoholic mother who feeds off of her former success by meddling with her daughter's life in a way that drives them both into their vices. They don't mix well, yet they undeniably love one another with whole hearts. The film opens with Suzanne being rushed to the hospital by a one-night stand after downing too many pills. She has her stomach pumped and is rushed to rehab. Upon release she is given a role in a B-Grade flick and is only allowed to work if she stays with her mother who can monitor her and make sure she doesn't start using again; despite the fact that her mother most certainly pushes her closer towards drugs than possibly any other human being. Through the course of the film shoot we see Suzanne and her mother interact in odd yet surprisingly human ways and we see their relationship flesh out to reveal the reasons (or excuses) for their destructive behavior.

And then it throws a happy ending on it and calls it a day.

I love the entire cast as well as the director (what could be more exciting than Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep starring in a Mike Nichols film together!?!??!?!) and so I really wanted to LOVE this film. I didn't, but I really, really liked it. It felt a little too light for what it could have been, a tad too uneven or unfocused. It had the potential to layer things better, but instead it went for a more convention way to tell the story, which worked from an entertainment level (it is fun and engaging in all the ways that Hollywood clichs have been proven to be) and yet it suffers on a more honest and artistic level (it could have GONE THERE but it doesn't even try). In fact, even when it is trying to flesh out these two women it stops short of saying anything truly alarming or provoking but beats around the bush with more accessible detailing.

But like I said, it has sharp dialog, marvelous chemistry and a relaxed internal flow; all of which makes for an entertaining ride.

The playbill reads like a who's-who of Hollywood giants, with Streep and MacLaine leading a cast that consists of Dennis Quaid, Annette Bening, Richard Dreyfuss, Rob Reiner, Mary Wickes and Gene Hackman; all of which making the most of their borderline cameo performances. Hackman is especially marvelous, opening and closing the film with dynamic effect and delivering possibly the most memorable performance in the whole film (the two shades he brings to the opening sequence is unforgettable).

I think many people will like this film a lot, and like I said; I really did too. I just wish it were a little more grounded and focused on relaying a more honest depiction of fragmented relationships and substance abuse instead of falling back on cinematic clichs and humor.",1314835200,2,3525,4.721951219512195

418109,4,6302030919,"Postcards from the Edge is not a sappy, been-there-done-that comedy. It's actually a movie with a lot of heart and spirit that just happens to be funny. This movie's been classified as an overall comedy, but I felt it dwindled between two genres: comedy and drama. It follows the protagonist--played by Meryl Streep--, a rising actress who is gifted at her craft, but has one thing that is stopping her from reaching her full potential: her drug addiction. The film, surprisingly, does not give us much to work with as a result of her addiction. We do not see a lot of Meryl Streep scarfing down pills and getting high; that all happens within the first ten-to-fifteen minutes of the movie. Instead we see the story of a woman who is attempting to overcome this obstacle and regain her humanity in the process. There are many great scenes shared between Meryl Streep and Shirley Maclaine in this movie. They have incredible chemistry as mother and daughter and, better yet, they give no cringe-worthy performances in this movie. Every line is inflected with the proper tone required for the character and for the story to be effective. I suggest, if you're not a hardcore drama fan, to see this movie plainly for the performances, because they are all great. For those who like a drama sprinkled with some witty dialogue, this is your movie. The merging of the dramatic elements as well as the humorous ones are almost flawless, which makes this movie a true classic for any movie lover.

418112,5,6302030919,"""Postcards From The Edge"" was written by Carrie Fisher, who based the screenplay on her autobiography. That autobiography was in turn loosely based on her personal life growing up in the Hollywood limelight as the daughter of a famous actress, Debbie Reynolds. When it came time to cast the film Debbie expressed an interest in being cast as the mother, but director Mike Nichols (""The Birdcage"" and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?"") decided on Shirley MacLaine. Meryl Streep was cast as the daughter after deciding to star in some light-weight films in the late eighties, most notably ""She-Devil"". The chemistry between MacLaine and Streep is excellent and Nichols direction is superb. It is, however, Fisher's screenplay that makes the film work and we get a chance to see the struggle between a mother and daughter in forming a real relationship while trying to survive in the movie industry. Drug addiction, vanity, and actresses getting old are some of the issues the film tackles. Dennis Quaid and Gene Hackman have supporting roles and the film became the #1 movie in the country upon its release in 1990. ""Postcards From The Edge"" garnered Streep an Oscar nod as Best Actress and the title song ""I'm Checkin' Out"" was nominated for Best Song. That song was performed at the 1991 Academy Awards by country music superstar Reba McEntire who had recently lost her entire band in a planecrash.

418171,4,6302030919,"Carrie Fisher's bracingly candid and acerbically amusing commentary is definitely worth a listen when you watch this scabrous 1990 comedy, especially since she wrote the screenplay based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/her-first-novel/dp/0743466519/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">her first novel</a>, which is turn, was based on her life as a drug-addicted movie actress who happens to be the daughter of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. With the self-assured Mike Nichols at the helm, the picture is glossy and often smug in its insider's look of Hollywood, but it also has an emotionally resonant quality thanks mainly to the shrewdly observant interplay between Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine as mother and daughter. Streep plays Suzanne Vale, an actress successful enough to star in a cheesy action flick but spiraling out of control with her drug habit. In fact, she barely finishes a film for veteran director Lowell Korshack (an initially snappish Gene Hackman) who reads her the riot act on the set about her budget-escalating addiction.

In the midst of a bleary-eyed one-night-stand, Suzanne becomes comatose from an overdose and is taken to the hospital where she gets her stomach pumped by a smitten doctor (a puppyish Richard Dreyfuss). She recovers and can work on her next picture only if she will live with her movie star mother Doris Mann to appease the insurance company. While the rest of the movie focuses on Suzanne's bumpy road toward recovery, the story really takes flight when it zeroes in on the prickly, dysfunctional relationship she has with Doris, a larger-than-life personality who means well as a mother but can't help being judgmental and competitive. Whether showing off her gams on a piano belting out Sondheim's ""I'm Still Here"" or revealing her pathetically shorn head after an auto collision, MacLaine is spot-on in the role, probably the best among her latter-day performances after Aurora Greenway in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terms-of-Endearment/dp/B000055ZF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terms of Endearment</a>.

Liberated from her parade of accents and period costumes, Streep seems at first too accomplished to be playing a second-rate actress, but she makes the bedraggled Suzanne likeably flawed. She also shows off an impressive singing voice with a couple of country-western numbers. Beyond Hackman and Dreyfuss, Dennis Quaid effectively plays an errant lover with smarmy panache, and there are nice near-cameos from Annette Bening as a flaky actress, Gary Morton as Suzanne's agent, Robin Bartlett as Suzanne's sardonic rehab roommate, CCH Pounder as an unctuous rehab counselor and Simon Callow as a two-faced director. In the studio scenes, Rob Reiner, Oliver Platt, Michael Ontkean and J.D. Souther provide even smaller bits. I just wish Fisher could have explored Suzanne's recovery beyond the fatherly pep talk from Korshack and the final moment of vulnerability from Doris. Beyond Fisher's commentary, the 2001 DVD contains partial filmographies for the principal players and several unrelated trailers.",1207785600,,3152,5.80561555075594
418172,5,6302030919,"Having just seen 'The Devil Wears Prada' for the umpteenth time in the last several months and not just to see Anne Hathaway...I have become transfixed with Meryl Streep's acting ability and the level of perfection and style that she brings to the screen.

I know that everyone has written their review and given their spin on this being a 'Hollywood Insider' film and it may very well be one.  I too can relate to Suzanne Vale's travails; her dependency on drugs, the struggle with her relationship with her mother and with her career.

BUT, I do not think that this movie is so much about any of that or even about the obvious...what I do say the movie is about is the dialectic of 'Becoming vs. Being'.

I'm not going to explain what I mean by that and I'm sure that the mature and savvy readers who ponder my humble words will know what I mean...but there is one line that everyone has overlooked...the 'Tell' (for me) so to speak and that is when Suzanne is embracing Gene Hackman in a nearly Father and Daughter dialog when she mutters...'I don't want life to imitate art...I want life to be art.'  WOW!!!

Perhaps it is the very high expectations that Suzanne places on herself and in the quest for full self expression within the dynamics of living in the Umbra of her mother that drives her to drug dependency and is the source of her deep rooted unhappiness...

Having spoken those words which segue shortly to the last scene of the film as Suzanne delivers a rousing rendition of Heartbreak Hotel there is no line of distinction in her performance between her life as an actress and her passion for her life and her craft fully self expressed, becoming no more.

At that moment I dropped a tear or two.",1201910400,,1713,4.503225806451613

If you want laughs, tears, and GREAT acting then spend an evening curled up with Postcards from the Edge!",1122508800,16,527,4.695652173913044

I should write this review emphasizing that fact alone.  As for the writing, it is excellent and witty and cerebral and dramatic, and it is all the more evident with all the incredible actors making the words their own.  This exceptional cast includes former Oscar-winners Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine, Gene Hackman, and Richard Dreyfuss.  Dennis Quaid, Rob Reiner, and Annette Bening also have good performances here and are worth mentioning.  But the finest actor in this film is Meryl Streep, with yet another Oscar-nominated performance, this time showing great comedic timing with hilarious expressions and delivering her dialogue with impeccable precision.  I'll stop now, before I wax rhapsodic.  The script is sharp and intelligent, the acting is superb all around, and the price for this DVD is amazing!  Thank you.",1106611200,46,988,5.1572327044025155
418239,4,6302030919,Great acting with Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine. Streep was nominated for best actress award both by the Academy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards. It is a chance to see Meryl Streep in her prime about 15 years ago. I very much enjoyed her role in the film as a country and western singer. I think it is the first time I have seen her sing.,1105315200,2,345,4.164179104477612
418240,5,6302030919,"Great cinematic rendition of Carrie Fisher's semi-autobiographical novel with wonderful performances from Shirley MacLaine as the aging screen queen and Meryl Streep as her star-druggie daughter. The cameos are wonderful...Richard Dreyfuss as the doc who pumps Streep's stomach?! Gene Hackman as Streep's suffering director...the list goes on. The ""bad"" thing is that we're left with one big unanswered question - when is Meryl Streep going to record a real album? Her voice is incredible! Fun, funny, and all too true - this one's a winner.",1104969600,26,541,5.376470588235295
418241,4,6302030919,"The insider here telling all is Carrie Fisher (of Princess Leia fame), daughter of crooner Eddie Fisher and songstress Debbie Reynolds.  Carrie adapted the screenplay from her best-selling novel of the same name in which she tells us what it's like (through her protagonist Suzanne Vale) to drug rehab Hollywood style.  As a writer she has a sharp eye for the hypocrisy of movie land culture, dysfunctional relationships, and a splendid gift for cutting one-liners.  Her dialogue made the book, and is the heart and soul of the movie.  Here are a few examples:

""Instant gratification takes too long.""  (A takeoff on, and a reinvention of, the doper's ""Too much is never enough."")

""...Endolphin rush.""  (Annette Bening corrects with, ""You mean enDORphin rush."")

""I am so glad that I got sober now so I can be hyper-conscious for this series of humiliations.""  (Suzanne Vale on her life without the deadening effect of drugs.)

Playing Carrie Fisher's alter ego is Meryl Streep, one of the great actresses of our time, while Shirley MacLaine, another outstanding star, plays the mother.

Streep is nearly flawless as always.  She just demands the camera, and she has extraordinary talent.  In the finale she sings a country and western song (from Carly Simon, by the way) and she does a great job.  But she seems almost absurd in the police uni (playing a part in a movie within a movie).  She doesn't seem to be achieving a comedic effect and then she does, just this side of the ridiculous.  But, as usual with Steep, when the camera gets on her face, we believe her.

Particularly telling was the opening scene, nicely directed by Mike Nichols.  I could see the familiar Palos Verdes cliffs and the shots of the ocean below.  As I waited for the SoCal scene to unfold (actually it was supposed to be Mexico) I thought, ""Gee, this looks like a cheap MOW set,"" and I continued to be fooled as Streep is hauled from customs by the customs officer and slapped.  It is only when they go to ""cut!"" and the movie within the movie is exposed that I realized why the set looked cheap.  (Because it was supposed to!)

Streep sold the scene within the scene, and irony, she was supposed to be doing a terrible job because of her character's drug dependency.

Somehow a scene with Meryl Streep in it never drags.  Maybe she guides the direction and the editing.  Thinking back (this is the first movie of hers I've seen in years) to Sophie's Choice, for example--1982 best actress Oscar and other honors--she hasn't changed much except that she's a little more relaxed, and while her concentration is still total, there is a touch less urgency in her performance.  I've heard people complain about her mannerisms, that head to the side so that the corner of the mouth goes up, a little defensive smile, and then the flash of eyes, comes to mind, and some others; but compared with say, Dustin Hoffman or (horrors) John Wayne, she's as pure as Olivier.

I liked her timing on the ""..And you weren't wearing any underwear"" line (talking about the embarrassment of her drunk mother showing her legs at a party in the past).

Shirley MacLaine is, if anything, even better here as--dare I say it?--""Debbie Reynolds,"" one part alcoholic, one part stage mom, and one part frustrated actress jealous of her daughter's youth and talent, all parts overbearing.  I recall Shirley MacLaine as a young woman.  I can see her in Can-Can (1960) showing off those gorgeous legs (she shows her legs here too, but I cringed along with her daughter).  She was pretty, healthy and busting her bodice as a young actress, and I liked her, but she was never more than a popular actress.  Then came, Terms of Endearment (1983).

Shirley MacLaine is the classic example of the actress who really learned how to act as she got older, not unlike Betty Davis, who also got better as she aged.  Shirley MacLaine (Warren Beatty's sister, one recalls) did get an academy award nomination for The Apartment (1960) with Jack Lemmon, but did not win.

I liked the hospital scene here at the end, mother and daughter renewing their bonds, Shirley without her wig, and no make-up.  You know you've got a serious actress when she will let herself look naturally terrible for the camera!

This is a true tinsel town original in which Hollywood self-analyzes in public, to be ranked in the vicinity of Sunset Boulevard (1950) and The Player (1992)--in different ways, of course--for giving us a glimpse of what it's really like to live the dream.  (Or is it a nightmare?)",1093219200,14,4523,4.727969348659004
418242,5,6302030919,"What a revelation.  I never knew what a movie could be until this film.  Sweet, sentimental, dramatic, heart-wrenching and fall-down funny all in one movie.  Meryl Streep shines and is more accessible than ever before.  Shirley MacLaine is luminous as ever.  Mary Wickes (Grandma) is hilarious and ended a wonderful career with this and ""Sister Act,"" forever cementing herself as a 20th century fixture.  Robin Bartlett (Aretha) is also a delight.  A wonderfully written and awesomely acted story.  Highest of recommendations for one and all, especially anyone who's interested in the ""behind the scenes"" aspect of Hollywood.",1065744000,32,625,5.371134020618556
418243,5,6302030919,"This Carrie Fisher penned film is perhaps one of the best screenplays written in the U.S. in the last 20 years. All the dialogue is crisp, clever and reads like a mix between Neil Simon and Moss/Hart.
Mike Nichols takes it to an even higher level, by casting Streep and MacLaine against each other and watching the sparks fly.
Filled with wonderful supporting performances by Gene Hackman, Richard Dreyfuss, Dennis Quaid, Mary Wickes, Oliver Platt, Rob Reiner and Annette Benning among others.
The extra features on the DVD are pretty scarce. But the Carrie Fisher audio commentary is priceless. Funny, whimsical and totally casual, Fisher manages to ramble on with no direction and still provides us a wonderful glimpse (in her own way) on what it was like on the set and making the film.
A must have for fans of excellent dialogue and good, clean comedy with a sarcastic edge.",1011139200,2,878,4.821192052980132
