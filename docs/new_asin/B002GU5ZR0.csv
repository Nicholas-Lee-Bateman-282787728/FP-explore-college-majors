3925919,5,B002GU5ZR0,"I have always been a HUGE fan of Michael Jackson. I will always remember where I was and what I was doing when I heard the news of his passing. I was so sad that I couldn't make it to LA for the memorial service. I just wanted to be there. After I watched this DVD, I felt like I was there. I can see how Michael was a huge part of our lives. I will miss Michael.",1248048000,38,363,3.6666666666666665
3925920,5,B002GU5ZR0,"No artist in history has touched as many lives as Michael Jackson.  That's evident in this documentary film shot at his memorial service in Los Angeles.  The film focuses on the fans that came from all over the world to be near MJ and say goodbye.  Sharing their stories about Michael, how he impacted their lives and what his music meant to them.  Very personal accounts from real fans, much different than the rehearsed speeches we've all seen on TV. If you couldn't be there in person at Staples Center, this is the next best thing.  A great way to remember the man and his music.  Highly recommended.",1247184000,93,604,4.546296296296297

3925924,5,B002GU5ZR0,"If you liked this DVD you will love the new Tribute book out on Michael Jackson called: ""Michael In Foreverland.""

3925925,3,B002GU5ZR0,This was a teary farewell with a smile as well. Proud to hear positive things about Michael and his talent and love for the world as well as to how much he IS adored by his fans but it was very repetative. So I really don't encourage this DVD unless you want it for your collection;it shows a lot of fans at the Appolo and at the Staples Center.,1267488000,,345,4.0144927536231885
3925926,2,B002GU5ZR0,I wasn't to fond of this dvd as it was all the fans opinions hanging around the Staples Center saying things about michael. But there really wasn't anything about michael except people talking the whole way through this. It was okay to watch once but I will probably never watch it again.,1267056000,,288,4.5576923076923075
3925927,5,B002GU5ZR0,"Anything about Michael Jackson is very good...period. About the latest news on child molestation, Don't they realize he's not with nus anymore? He is so dead and they have to open old wounds, What for?????? my friend told me though that if Michael's estate pays them  they don't have to mention it anymore...Look what they are doing to Tiger Woods? They destroyed all possible hopes to save their marriage...For me, its the media who destroyed Tiger...I hope they don't have to do this with Michael...He's dead...",1262908800,,513,4.965116279069767
3925928,1,B002GU5ZR0,I was disappointed to find out that the only thing on this DVD is just interviews of people as they waited to go in to his memorial service.  I thought there would be actual footage of MJ or of the memorial service itself.  I love Michael Jackson but was very disappointed that I spent money on this DVD.,1262390400,2,304,4.224137931034483
3925929,3,B002GU5ZR0,"My family watched this and we were happy that so many people adored this man.  He deserves all the recognition, shame it wasn't expressed when he could hear it himself.",1260403200,,168,4.6
3925930,4,B002GU5ZR0,"That thousands of fans from all over the world mourned Michael Jackson's passing should be enough evidence of  the strength of his music. I live and work in Indonesia. I travel a lot in relation to my works. On Nov 12th, I was in a small city in Borneo, on the edges of the rainforest, when I went to a local restaurant for dinner, and there was the entertainment team (a man on keyboard and a woman singing) playing ""Ben"". 2 days later, I was yet in another rainforest town, this time in the island of Java, when again the local band played another Micahel Jackson's song, ""One Day in Your Life"". I think Michael would have loved that! People - of all nations and races - will remember and will keep on playing Michael's songs, long after his critics have been gone and forgotten.",1258416000,2,781,4.386206896551724
3925931,3,B002GU5ZR0,"This DVD was kinda not what I was expecting, and I probably would not have bought it, if I had known that it was just about other peoples comments, I was thinking it was some footage of the memorial service, which was just outstanding.  But still it was ok listening to the people talk about how Michael Jackson inspired them and how they loved him.  Michael was all about love anyway!!

3925932,5,B002GU5ZR0,"This video gives you a look into the Michael Jackson fan base outside the Staples Center. It is comprise of regular fans giving their thought and testimonials on the King of Pop.

Yes is sad and it did bring tears to my eyes but at the same time I said to myself I'm not alone there are million of us that feel the same way. MJ is no longer here with us.

It is heart felt because it comes from average every day people some are impersonators and they have the right to show their love for Michael by imitating him.

This is not the celebrity after celebrity that we saw at the memorial service. BTW where were all those celebrities when MJ really need it them during his darkest hour in 2005 dunno???",1255305600,4,701,4.2164179104477615
3925933,2,B002GU5ZR0,WAS LOOKING FOR I GUESS SOMETHING SPECIAL.I SAW ALL OF THIS ON T.V. WASN`T ANYTHING NEW. WHAT A BIG BUMMER.M.J.WAS THE BEST EVER. AND SUCH A CAREING PERSON,1253923200,2,155,4.571428571428571
3925934,1,B002GU5ZR0,"This is a warning because as a die hard fan I would want someone to share their input, if it were sincere! This is not a product worth puchasing because for what seemed like an hour, they filmed the same six to eight people! The entire footage is first asking what does Michael mean to you and then where were you when you found out he died! One guy even has the nerve to say that he's not surprised Michael died the way he did because alot of Hollywood people mix drugs and stuff -so he's not surprised! Ok- was he a fan or just a random participant of the day! I wonder how he feels now that it has been declared that Michael was murdered at the hands of another! Not saying Michael was a saint but give me a break- you are at the man's memorial service! Ugh!

And no disrespect intended- but I agree with one of the other amazon comments about the people they interviewed in this film. There was not a diverse group represented and the ones shown seemed to be those who were... I'm not sure how to put it but it was not from all walks if life! They also show alot of the street hustlers who were there to make a profit off the day! Selling 8 MJ buttons for 19.99! Come on!

But honestly- as a fan this is not something I would purchase to add to my collection in remembering a man who means so much to me. From one fan to another- save your money and buy something that will bless you for years to come! purchasing stuff like the DVDs he produced of his short films, looking at past interviews and anything that gives his words is the best get- besides his
songs of course! Don't become sensitive during this time and let those who throw anything together become bait for MJ fans! Listen to the comments- although it seems as if some enjoyed this footage! If you really want to see this- I will mail you my copy! Seriously- no postage required!",1252281600,38,1847,4.2
3925935,1,B002GU5ZR0,"I attended the memorial, and was interested in this video, hoping it would show the amazing turnout and fellowship shown on that day. This video shows what.. 10 folks?  Half of them ""came out of the woodwork"" it looked like. This is not a true representation of the fans that I encountered that day. Yes, they all loved Michael, but why were more people not interviewed? Sad indeed. And to the lookalike that was ""Trekking in the outlands of Nepal"" when she was informed by a ""Sherpa"" that Michael Jackson had passed..  um.. no. Would I recommend this video? 5 out of 5 sherpas say NO.",1251590400,19,585,4.509433962264151
3925936,5,B002GU5ZR0,"Every MJ fan should have this video. It's about us and it expresses what we all feel in our hearts. It connects us to each other. It assures us that, no matter where we are in the world, we all share one thing -- our love and admiration for the King of Pop. Let's keep his memory alive forever!",1250899200,13,294,4.0
3925937,5,B002GU5ZR0,"I am glad they made a dvd of his fans and what they really thought of MJ, I know he new we loved him but I don't know if he really got it on how much he met to us, he was like family, I am 5yrs younger than Michael I grew up with him so I remember it all, but I could not watch all of this dvd it is just to sad. It will be awhile before i will be able to watch all of it. But to everyone out there this is something to have in your collection. I love u 4ever Michael od Bless you RIP.",1250812800,8,485,3.418181818181818
3925938,2,B002GU5ZR0,"This documentary is more along the lines of just his fans speaking out on how Michael Jackson influenced them. It does not show any of the memorial service in here. Its a little slow paced for me and I think it would have been better as a ""tv special"" / infomercial. This is something you watch once and thats it.",1250380800,7,313,4.233333333333333
3925939,5,B002GU5ZR0,"Incredibly depressing  and uplifting at the same time. Don't even bother to try to keep from crying. Not only does it show how many fans he had, but just how much he touched the lives of so many people on a personal level, people he never met and knew existed. What I like about it is these are just regular people, just like me and  you and we all have one common bond in Michael Jackson and that we were fans and loved and cared about him.

I can't even stand to see the word ""Farewell"" in relation to him. But if you are still very emotional over his passing I think this will give you that ""You Are Not Alone"" feeling and it will make you feel good to be among people who feel the same way. I have been a fan since ""Off the Wall"" since I wasn't around for J5, but I became a fan after that fact. My fandom for him only got bigger. I'm grateful I lived in an era to see him and be alive in this world with him, and to witness a true LEGEND. I will never, never, ever forget him. I miss him so much. We fans will keep his spirit alive for many years.",1249257600,62,1052,3.9065420560747666
3925940,5,B002GU5ZR0,"Michael, although a few years older than you, I grew up with your music, as it evolved; I evovled along with it.  Thank you for that.  I've heard it said that God picks the brighest flowers in his garden first, and I believe He did that with you, too.  May you rest in peace in the Kingdom you have earned.

This video will be a keepsake for me.  You were a part of my life; and now your life is a part of my soul.  It was good to hear the comments of others throughout the video that resonated with my own thoughts; moved me to tears; and moved me to smiles.  You meant the world to much of the world.  You excelled despite the many roadblocks thrown in your journey down life's trail, and for that, I commend you and hope I can do even a small part of what you accomplished to further the arts and the status of all mankind through your magnificent talent.

The end of the video, with final notes by Nelson Mandela, were so moving.  I had to take time to let my emotional cup overflow -- and then mop up the teary-eyed mess - ha-ha.  But it's true.  You moved me in many ways and in the final analysis I have to question my own life and whether I have done a fraction of what you accomplished in your short time on earth.  I fear I fall short, but I will move forward with these words you wrote and sung: ""Heal the world...Be God's glow"".  That, now, is my mission.",1249257600,41,1367,4.071161048689139

8370022,5,B002GU5ZR0,"Michael Jackson was clearly the most talented performer of our generation.  His vocals were not only outstanding, he was not afraid to put his personal stamp on his songs.  His choreography was flawless, and has sparked a generation to dance.  While this was filmed we felt a terrible sense of loss, but nobody yet comprehended what a deep rift his death would leave in our society.
  While he chose to be controversial the last years of his life and then isolated himself from the public, he still remains a figure that sparks debate.  Whatever the public's varied opinion about MJ, his last album shows that he was still a perfectionist, and that well into his fifties, he could keep up vocally and physically in his dance with performers in their twenties.
  For those who were able to experience all of MJ's work, the depth of his loss is unexpectedly painful.  No performer has stepped up to fill his shoes.  Rest in peace Michael, and thank you for the legacy you have left.",1349913600,,980,4.645348837209302
