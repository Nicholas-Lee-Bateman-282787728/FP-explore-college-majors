8731480,4,B014P6ST02,Bought this without too many reviews available. It's basically an hour long TV style documentary about Dolly's early years up through 2002. Includes a British narrator and seems to be produced by the BBC. Not a lot of content that I wasn't already aware of (though some new to me backstory on her breaking away from the control of Porter Wagner) but will make a good introduction of Dolly to my children who aren't yet familiar with her. Short interviews with collaborators including Lily Tomlin and Alison Krause. Heavy emphasis on the I Will Always Love You song. Just wish it went past 2002 or that there was a more recent DVD for the last decade or so. No bonus features or any content other than the documentary.,1459987200,3,717,4.609375
8731481,5,B014P6ST02,This is a must have for any Dolly Parton fan. Very Entertaining. Love Dolly. I've been a fan for over 35 years. Worth buying.,1457481600,2,125,4.25
