1484933,1,B00005JMBQ,I want to give it negative stars but it won't let me.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Movies like this make me go back to the video store and rent another movie hoping that it will cure this illness I feel from watching it.  How did this movie get made?  I would have gone into detail about what I didn't like about this movie but then I wouldnt have been able to say how much it sucked!,1066435200,10,407,3.8674698795180724
1484934,4,B00005JMBQ,"Labute made a good work in the direction of the ascendent Rachel Weisz and the funny and good partner Rudd. All of the characters involve in this film are so regular, like many others moralist in our world. This kind of cruelty is so common in many places with our current modern lives. All the staff understand this and show us regular people in regular situations with regular and raw ends. Noone like the sweettest Weisz to show us the cruelty between loving people that we live every day.
My wife still hate the movie, she can't believed that people like them exist but she know very well where to found them. Good movie to hate and remember in some crucial ocasions.",1066089600,5,671,4.508196721311475
1484935,4,B00005JMBQ,"Gretchen Mol and Paul Rudd star in ""The Shape of Things"".  Mol plays a college student who takes her obsession with art over the edge.  While correcting a ""fake art"" sculpture in a museum, she meets one of the employees, played by Paul Rudd.  One is popular, one isn't due to appearances.  The two begin dating.  Their relationship turns intense very quickly as the guy quickly changes his looks.  Many more people start finding him highly attractive.  Many intensities erupt time by time.
The producer, the director, and the writer creatively film this movie.  Everyone gives their unique outlooks.  Paul Rudd acts his role wonderfully.  The one complaint is that the screenplay often stretches certain scenes too long.  This causes numerous unnecessary repetative scenes.  Besides this, ""The Shape of Things"" is enjoyable viewing for the audience.  Many shocking scenes keep everyone watching closely until the shocking end.",1065916800,,926,5.217687074829932
1484936,4,B00005JMBQ,"Neil Labute's deep psychological look at relationships is as provocative as his groundbreaking ""In The Company of Men"" All of the characters involve in this film are deprave in someway or another, and just as cruel. All four leads give great performances but the real showstopper here is the great performance of Rachel Weisz that pushes this movie along to its heartbreaking end. Her performance is haunting, and at the same time horrifying. Prepare to take some down time after the ending to catch your breath and take in what you just saw.",1064620800,,542,4.838709677419355
1484937,2,B00005JMBQ,"The Shape of Things is based on a play, which is one strike against it from the start. Neil Labute, in adapting it for the screen, scarcely makes it into a movie at all, with the same four characters running into each other in various unpopulated and nondescript settings and having long conversations. For the first three-quarters of the film I felt like I was watching some kind of improvisational exercise from an acting class. Then, around the last twenty minutes, we find out that the movie is actually about something. This reverses the usual flow of bad-to-mediocre movies, where the high concept usually runs out of steam around the middle and the end is a complete disaster. The end of The Shape of Things is actually quite interesting, though this cannot redeem the tedium of the beginning and middle. Paul Rudd plays Adam, a nerdy museum guard who meets the attractive and enigmatic Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), a graduate art student who is about to deface a musuem sculpture. This opening scene sets the stage for most of the film; it is drawn out and talky and the actors don't succeed in conveying that they are really involved in what's going on; Evelyn doesn't seem like a fanatical avant-garde artist about to commit a crime and Adam doesn't seem especially concerned. They seem, rather, like two actors improvising dialogue that might be spoken in such a situation. The introduction of Adam's friend Phillip (Frederick Weller) and Phillip's fiancee Jenny (Gretchen Mol) mainly gives the film about an hour's worth of dialogue and superfluous (as far as the real theme is concerned) activity. Evelyn and Phillip hate each other but might actually be attracted to each other; Adam and Jenny are attracted to each other; Phillip finds out that Adam and Jenny have kissed so Phillip and Adam have a long talk; Jenny and Evelyn have a long talk...yawn. Meanwhile, Evelyn is gradually getting Adam to make all kinds of little and not so little changes in his life, from his hairstyle to his clothes. Like Labute's prior film, In the Company of Men, The Shape of Things explores the manipulation and deviousness that often characterize relationships. The problem with the present film is that it takes way too long to reveal what it's really about and sidetracks us with too many unnecessary diversions. The film actually raises some fascinating questions (again, not till the very end) about the relationship between art and real life. Finally, it asks whether the artist is some kind of Nietzschean being who is above morality. I only wish more of the film focused on these questions.",1064534400,9,2592,4.879818594104308

1485060,2,B00005JMBQ,the art student is a narcissistic sociopath who has no heart or conscience. She is a disgusting human being who has no compassion or empathy. Of course she could manipulate him he was a lonely nerdy guy getting attention from a pretty girl. I hope this creature because she is not a human being got an F on her project. I wonder if she would have felt remorse or guilt if he had killed himself. He should have sued her I think a jury would be horrified by her.

1485063,3,B00005JMBQ,"Watching this is defiantly an experience you can only have once like the car wreck that finally kills you.  To sum it up, yep, Evelyn's definitely just a sociopath using art as an excuse to manipulate the subject for fun. She's just your typical example of a narcissistic ""artist"" who believes that they are the only ones who ""get it"" and their level of comprehension is above and beyond what others know.  Watching movies like this makes me long for a movie like Funny Games the difference at least in Funny Games the deranged individuals have the good manners to kill you after they have had their fun and they don't expect the victims to thank them for attempting to improve their lives.

So we find out the main twist is that a semi attractive girl can manipulate an unattractive man over the course of a fake relationship.  Is anyone shocked by this?  Woman can manipulate men with sex, what was I supposed learn by sitting through all this?

The scenes drag out way too long.  The acting is timid at best.  I'm never rooting for any character through the whole film so you don't get sucked into to any of this.  You just watch distantly as the movie ticks toward a sucky end.

The DVD extras are sub par.  The tour of campus is a total joke.  I started listening to the commentary and its basically the crew talking about the music selections and patting themselves on the back about how awesome they are.

1485146,3,B00005JMBQ,"I loved this play when it was done at my university's theatre. I thought I could enjoy the greatness again with the film, but it wasn't even close to as good.
Especially for people not familiar with the play, it just drags with all the dialog.
In theatre, there is motion in even the straight dialog that would look silly on film.

Regardless, it is a true rendition. But if you can, watch the play in a theatre and not on a screen.",1291593600,,432,4.204819277108434

1485148,4,B00005JMBQ,"Perhaps not quite as nihilistic or misanthropic as LaBute's ""In the Company of Men"" or ""Your Friends and Neighbors"", ""The Shape of Things"" takes aim at the potential psychosis that can evolve when an artist expresses more empathy and concern for the power of her own work than for human subjects. The stellar performances by Rudd and Weisz are deceptively complex and the allusions to Bruce Nauman and Godard are ingenious both formally and thematically. A postmodern version of ""Frankenstein"" reworked through the guise of gender wars and the horrific throes of dating, this might be LaBute's masterpiece.",1251331200,,606,5.1938775510204085

1485153,5,B00005JMBQ,"Deception. Hate. Cheating. Heartbreak. For some, these are aspects of life and relationships best not explored in films. For all others, there is Neil LaBute, a writer/director who's fearless when it comes to exploring the darker side of human nature. LaBute exploded onto the scene in 1997 with the controversial ""In The Company Of Men,"" a film about two young men who play a devastatingly cruel trick on a deaf female coworker. Subsequent efforts such as ""Your Friends And Neighbors"" and ""Nurse Betty"" showed LaBute continuing to push the envelope while enlisting A-list actors such as Morgan Freeman, Renee Zellweger and Ben Stiller.

""The Shape Of Things"" shows LaBute at the top of his game. Paul Rudd plays Adam, a shy, nerdy college student who works part-time at a local museum. While working one day he meets Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), an attractive graduate art student who surprisingly takes a liking to Adam. The two begin seeing each other, later embarking on an ill-fated double date with Adam's former roommate Philip (Fred Weller), a cocky jock who delights in mocking Adam; and Jenny (Gretchen Mol), a fellow student who the gregarious Philip ""stole"" from Adam.

Before long, Adam has fallen hard for Evelyn, who fulfills his every sexual desire and slowly begins transforming his physical appearance. She changes his hair, gets him to lose weight via a new running regiment, overhauls his wardrobe and more. As Adam's physical transformation progresses, he changes emotionally as well, gaining a newfound sense of confidence. His new demeanor catches the attention of Jenny, and flirtation ensues. From there the games of deception begin, and it all builds to a brutal climax in which more than one character experiences the ultimate in humiliation.

It sounds like the potential stuff of soap opera. But LaBute is the rare filmmaker who strikes a raw nerve with his words and cinematic style, and he uses the setup to make one stingingly perceptive observation after another about art, humanity, and relationships. The film, adopted from LaBute's play (which starred the same actors) sometimes feels stagy, but with dialogue this sharp, who's complaining?

Each actor is standout. Weisz, the most well known of the crew, is surprisingly good, even delivering lengthy monologues about the nature of art with ease, and looking stunning every minute. Rudd, who had a long-running role on ""Friends,"" makes the transformation from nebbish nerd to sharp-dressed stud with impressive ease. Weller also makes a strong impression as the classic slimy-male LaBute character. The solid Mol, another future star, rounds out the impressive cast. My only complaint: Where's LaBute regular Aaron Eckhart, one of the best actors in the biz?

Stellar acting aside, the movie belongs to LaBute, who with each of his films continues to show that's he one of the most unique voices in American cinema. It may not be perfect, but it's still exciting to watch LaBute climb out on a limb and take chances. This is a film, like LaBute's incendiary debut ""In The Company Of Men,"" that's guaranteed to divide audiences and promote debate. Where else can you see a film where the lead actress flips off the audience during a pivotal scene? Whether you're flipping her the bird right back or cheering her on, ""The Shape Of Things"" is one film you don't want to miss.",1180224000,2,3353,5.0451263537906135
1485154,3,B00005JMBQ,"Paul Rudd plays a man who has nothing whatsoever that makes him distinguishable from anyone else. One day he meets a graduate art student at the gallery where he works and asks her out. She accepts which is a surprise to him since he's slightly overweight, wears glasses, has never had much success with ladies, and she is--in a word--stunning.

Soon into their relationship things about Rudd's character start to change. He begins working out, dressing better, and starts to consider cosmetic surgery. In direct proportion to how much time he spends with his artistic, creative, and beautiful girlfriend he starts to see more of these qualities in himself. In fact, so much so that he's willing to sacrifice his friendships to become closer to her. Then comes the day that her final art project is revealed and Rudd begins to question the validity of their entire relationship.

This was one of those films that makes you not want to be around people because you can't help but think that everyone might be as unfeeling and uncaring as some of the characters in this film. To put someone else's feelings and wellbeing in jeopardy for the sake of one's own art is incomprehensible to me... and fascinating to watch. The Shape of Things is one of those films that makes you think about things and is therefore, in my opinion, worthwhile. Like Voltaire once said, ""I may not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.""  I hate the message that this film presents. I hate the bleak picture it paints for the state of people's emotions and the way that people can overlook the bounds of common courtesy for their own selfish ends. But that being said, I understand that it happens every day, and this film does a great job of portraying the banality of human thoughtlessness.

I think it's also important to watch the introduction to the film by director Neil LaBute that's included as one of the DVD extras. In it, he talks about the difficulties of bringing this story, which was originally written as a stage play, to the theatre and how it affected the casts' performances.",1167696000,,2114,4.674731182795699
1485155,4,B00005JMBQ,"There's a point in Neil LaBute's razor sharp satire, The Shape Of Things, where the protagonists, Adam and Evelyn, are discussing a show they've just seen.  Their graphic description sounds suspiciously like Karen Finley, whose zany antics helped galvanize the extreme right wing against all things liberal and artistic.  I saw Finley perform and will freely concede that watching her pour chocolate sauce on her naked body was amusing, diverting, and tested the perimeter of what may seriously be called art.  Finley's position was that she herself was her own artistic statement.  Evelyn, played brilliantly by Rachel Weisz, takes this concept one step further.

Although it reads like a play adapted for film, it is, The Shape Of Things is really more like a slow burning horror movie that builds to an unbearable climax.  It's urbane and clever, a yuppified Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolf in its sensibility.  Plenty of fun references for all the liberal arts major out there.  But beneath all this smart banter is a basic assumption laying the groundwork for cruelty to come.  That is, when we fall in love, we fall in love with the person who we will have shaped out of the person who is before us now.  We don't even see the actual person in front of us; we see what that person might become.

In this regard, The Shape Of Things is a ""high concept"" film, because it addresses a clearly defined philosophical problem.  But the great irony here is that almost all of us are ultimately disappointed because efforts to change the objects of our affection are doomed to failure; people simply don't change unless they must.  Thus, the day comes for us when we look across the breakfast table and see the actual person, at last, and most often, that individual is not from royal lineage.  We say goodbye to the imaginary person we thought we could shape, and feel a sense of loss.

The dynamic between Adam and Evelyn poses the opposite question - what if you succeeded in shaping a person to your will?  What then?  What would you have gained?  What would be the consequences of such an act, especially the unintended consequences?  It's a fascinating question with many layers of complexity, and LaBute is to be congratulated for raising it in his compact, disciplined film.  All four players come through admirably, Weisz is amazing, and Paul Rudd delivers the goods in a deceptively understated way.  Evelyn's sketchy motives for remaking Adam are clearly the lynch pin of The Shape Of Things, but all the human interactions in this film will get you thinking and keep you thinking.  Recommended.",1162339200,3,2601,4.823927765237021
1485176,1,B00005JMBQ,"This movie does not adress art in any way, shape, or form.  Do not be fooled.",1153526400,3,77,3.8125
1485177,4,B00005JMBQ,"Some people may not feel this movie the same way others do, as it seems to be a Conversationalist film and not a so much the college love story you may expect. At first it definitely does feel like love is brewing between the two main characters but after a while it loses the love and gains a ton of drama. The best thing about The Shape of things is that after a little bit of time the film becomes unpredictable. This movie is filled with talk and even ends in a lot of talk but it is more interesting than boring and you get hooked to see where the story is going.

Adam (Paul Rudd) meets his future girlfriend Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) in the museum he works security. Unfortunately they meet while Evelyn is closing in on a very important sculpture but the can of spray paint in her hand lets Adam know she's not there for a closer look. Now I figure that trouble is coming but the two are almost perfect for each other and they settle for a number exchange. Evelyn is a loud and sometimes obnoxious art soldier and loves anything she can do to make a statement. Paul on the other hand is a nice, calm, and shy guy or geek. Paul's two friends Phillip and Jenny who are engaged give the story that gigantic load of drama it needed to keep the viewer interested.

The four-man cast does a great job making you believe that love or some affection is involved between them but the mystery is who actually loves each other. The genius in the Shape of Things though lies within the belief that one thing is going on and then bam your hit with an unexpected ending and a nicely done performance from Rachel Weisz. She never gives off the secret that she's hiding from her new boyfriend.

This is a movie not only about well kept secrets but psycho girls willing to do anything to get what they want, dishonesty, betrayal, an unlikely love, and most astonishing humiliation for a good grade on an art project. Though to some this film would seem to be unoriginal it was very well done. The style that it was made with was very smooth even though it's mostly talk. It's a great movie and I'm sure that girls will enjoy it on almost all levels especially the ending that is sure to destroy any guy and Rachel Weisz definitely nailed the coffin shut. The story tries to get you to wonder why Evelyn is with Adam but the real story and mystery is why she gets him to change so much or her obsession with photographing and taping themselves but eventually she tells you and it makes the movie pretty good.",1149724800,3,2494,4.3247863247863245
1485178,4,B00005JMBQ,"Like being punched in the nose, the pain is so shocking that it leaves you fallen to the ground holding your head in surprise and victimizing you pride. Being dumped in a relationship can hurt a person, in The Shape of Things; Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) plays an evil hearted woman who sculpts a human being into her art thesis. In this sour comedy Evelyn's main title for her thesis is ""Moralists have no place in an art gallery,"" which holds true for the climax for this movie. Adam (Paul Rudd) ironically works in a museum, who innocently discovers Evelyn and from that point Evelyn secretly molds and shapes Adam into societies clich? of what people see in popular magazines. Evelyn uses her skill of sexual seduction, convincing persuasion, and even reframes from using powerful motives such as; you must or you have to. With these artistic persuading skills Adam has changed his style of clothing, his sense of style, he finds him having surgery on his imperfect nose, disregards his friends, and even lives a different way to accommodate Evelyn's wants. Neil LaBute writes edits and directs this move in such a poetic and sophisticated way that he is the modern day parallel to Edgar Allen Poe. Having the climax at the end of the movie makes it slow paced, but with patience this move really is emotionally disgusting. Labute successfully created this movie to show that ""Moralists have no place in an art gallery."" Labute also demonstrates how powerful the combination of women and persuasion has on men, and what extremities men will do to satisfy a women's needs. It is controversial to say that ""Moralists have no place in an art gallery,"" because of history of art. Shakespeare demonstrated tragedy, but tragedy shows us reality, and other poets who talk about happiness, these are things that show us reality and it is the reality of art to show us what is moral and what is not. The Shape of Things is a move about a big question, is there moral in art? This movie successfully challenges the audience to think about that big question. It is also ironic that the characters name are Adam and Evelyn... Creative but sad this move is granted four stars out of five.",1145404800,2,2173,4.721052631578948
1485179,4,B00005JMBQ,"For people who've seen this movie:

I found the double-cross at the end of this deeply unsettling.  This movie felt like a comedy of manners/character ensemble at first and I was looking for fun personality quirks and that kind of detail, but the playwrite was really working towards making a _Statement About Art_, a kind of philosophical Point - something very rare in American cinema. I was surprised - I would expect it more in a French movie.

I found it easy to fall for Rachel Weisz myself, and morover I thought the male friend was just a repellent jerk.  So although Rachel was obviously trying to mold him in a certain direction, it felt agreeable and OK because his resistence wasn't very strong and the people and traits he was getting away from were not necessarily a reflection of his true nature. They were personality ticks holding him down. She was improving him.

That she turned out to be a strangely uncaring sociopath at the end..well it made sense in hindsight, and it was a good hook to hang a movie around, so I guess this film succeeded on its own terms. This is a good character drama and worthwhile as a rental if not a purchase.",1134691200,5,1156,4.538461538461538
1485180,1,B00005JMBQ,"While the ending of this film is a surprise and a little interesting, it is in no way worth sitting through the rest of the movie.  Truly stilted, awkward dialouge and some really unaturally bad acting makes this film painful to watch.",1130025600,3,235,4.595238095238095
1485181,4,B00005JMBQ,"I invited a (girl) friend of mine to watch this movie with me.  After fifteen minutes I could saw that she was extremely bored, so I stopped the ""tape"" (because in this DivX days tape is at all used any more) and asked her what happened.  ""It's a boring movie"", she said, ""and the boy is really not cute"".  She was conditioned to think that in an American movie with a male and female character the two of them must be attractive.  She looked at the surface, at the shape of things.  Would she die of horror if she had seen the end?  I doubt so.  The human kind has a considerable capacity for cover what nobody should seen or thought of.
 Neil LaBute wrote a theorem for the stage, and translated (effectively I must add) to the screen.  Each gesture and line from his four actors is refined with the assurance that only months of rehearsal can give.  I could not think of another way to convey to the broad public, or at least to the segments of them that wants to chew thought food, this piece of existential question that the one LaBute choose.  With static settings and nuanced camerawork the attention drifts toward what each character does, what he says and how he says it.  The movie is constructed in a number of scenes joined by slices of Elvis Costello music that refers to the plot.
And what is it?  Boy meets girl, girl has a great influence over him.  Like a teenager comedy from the eighties.  And without a twist.  If you read other reviews, they would tell you that a wicked twirl of a regular plot awaits you.  But the truth is that LaBute decided to play with the silenced consequences of devotion in the love game.  And they aren't a deviation from the regular portray of romance in movies but only the result of a little bit of interest in the moral results of it.  In a romantic unbalanced couple there is always one that dominates.  The question is if everything that derive from this domination is justified in the name of love.  LaBute uses art instead of love, because the last one is too much integrated in our thinking like a big justifier that could cover all moral ambivalence.  But art, in my opinion, is only here a proxy.
LaBute has been compared to Todd Solonz in his cold treatment of human relationships and hypocrisy.  But if Solondz goes for a shock that always pays off, LaBute thinks in terms of an idea surrounded by little examples about it.  That sometimes goes wrong (as in ""Your Friends & Neighbours"") and sometimes goes well (like here).  The obsession and conformity with the surface, our ""immoral"" behavior, betraying friends (that tries to correct misfortunes but goes berserk and is paid for later), the question about our goodness, all are there in those two LaBute movies.
""The Shape of Things"" is more streamlined, more energetic in his dialogs, better of the same.  It's cheaper than going to theater but has the same feeling, has great music and actors in it, is thought-provoking, and is a great date movie for that date that really (really) deserves to be with you.  So what are you waiting for?",1129420800,6,3052,4.51183970856102
1485182,2,B00005JMBQ,"I rented this DVD because I thought it would feature Gretchen Mol's fine acting ability in a romantic comedy. Well, one out of two I suppose is worth something.
The movie's first problem is that, despite claims to the contrary, it still comes off like a play (what it was originally), which would be acceptable had playwright-director Neil LaBute been able to transfer the plot successfully to the big screen. Unfortunately, though, that doesn't occur. The scenes lack life and perspective while there's also an absence of continuity, which might have been remedied perhaps with the use of, say, a musical score or better transition between scenes. Instead, there are too many pregnant silences that presumambly would have been filled with the responses from a live audience, but, since it's not a live play in a theater,  remain embarrassingly silent.
The movie's other major problem is its tone: beginning lightly -like a romantic comedy- it quickly turns dark and then darker (I mean, darker!!), and without subtle nuance either. We get mauled while we also get misled.  To add to our dismay, we discover, too late, that we're also receiving a moral lesson.  It's not that the message itself is that disturbing; it's the bombast with which it is ultimately delivered. The stark brashness simply does not seem necessary to make the point. Even less tolerable is the pace along the way- the tedious, laborious journey accompanied, I might add, by too many annoying instances of irrelevant crudeness.
Buried amidst this rubble are admittedly good performances by Paul Rudd, Rachel Weisz and of course Mol.  Yet it doesn't matter. They're wasted on a vehicle that in the end is far too awkward and depressing.",1125532800,3,1708,5.003521126760563
1485183,3,B00005JMBQ,"The Shape of Things is a decent movie but it feels awkward in a lot of places, and most of the dialog is a bit stiff. Rachel Weisz is probably one of the best actresses we have in our generation and she does carry this film on her back and for her performance alone, this movie gets three stars from me. The movie as a whole does not cut it in the reality department, and the whole process of Paul Rudd becoming a man was a bit ridiculous, and a bit hard to swallow because it was obvious from the get go on what she was trying to do and if he did not see what was coming, then he is much more at fault than she was because he let happen.

Like I said before, Rachel Weisz is the only reason I give this film 3 stars but the movie really needed to pull itself together in order for me to take it seriously.",1117065600,4,806,3.8848484848484848
1485184,4,B00005JMBQ,"The Shape of Things is one of those films whose ambition is greater than its achievement.  It clearly provokes thought but to what price?  The film had the potential to be a brilliant exploration of the morality of art and contemporary culture, but as it stands, LaBute's vision is challening, piquant, overly simplistic, and frequently just tonally off.  Still, two days after first seeing this film, I long to revisit what I enjoyed- and like an oddly pleasing pressure point, endure the parts of the film that irked me.

The film, based on LaBute's stage play and featuring all the original actors, depicts a metaphorical and artificial conceit owing to such sources as Pygmalion and Genesis.  Without revealing the central conceit, the unraveling of which, may surprise viewers, the plot is as follows: Adam (Paul Rudd) a truly nerdy museum guard meets Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) an ""art terrorist"" to quote LaBute.  As the relationship progresses, Evelyn gradually persuades Adam to change his appearance and lifestyle.  After getting a nose job (Rudd sports a hilarious prosthetic in the film's first half), several pounds, and a bad haircut, the handsome Rudd as we have come to know him finally emerges in the latter half of the film: the fruit, if you will, of Evelyn's labors.  Jenny (Gretchen Mol) and Philip (Fred Weller)- an engaged couple and Adam's friends- seek to intervene, complicating the plot's outcome.

The story is told entirely through these four characters using point-and-shoot setups.  In other words, this film is pure dialogue: rhythmic, intelligent, but inherently artificial and contrived.  Frequently the characters sputtering out these pungent and quirky lines seem more like marionettes to LaBute's writerly wit than thinking, breathing entities.  However, once in a while, LaBute lets the characters overcome the artificiality and emerge as real people.  For instance, when Evelyn and Phil get in a fight about controversial art, the passions ignited between the two is palpable- and hilarious.  Evelyn and Phil felt real in that scene and the fact that they both present their arguments poorly is refreshingly realistic and ambiguous.  Another perfect- and hilarious- moment occurs after Jenny first sees Adam post-rhinoplasty and asks him, concerned and curious, ""How much weight *did* you lose?""  It's moments like these that present LaBute as a genuinely unique voice with an understanding of everyday human behavior.

However, the overarching themes that the film raises are frequently undermined by the aforementioned artificiality of the characters.  For instance, how can we, as an audience, accept a treatise on the callousness of modern art- the way it dehumanizes- when LaBute himself fails to effectively present the realities of the human experience?  LaBute has been called ""misanthropic"" for this failure.  I think a more appropriate term would be ""lazy.""  As an artist with a fixed agenda, he should realize that his perception of the world resonates better when it addresses multiple sides of the considered issue.  Up until the weirdly melodramatic last scenes and excepting the intermittently brilliant little scenes, the human element- so critical in understanding Evelyn's perception of art- is all but replaced by the stagy artificiality of marionette puppets in the hands of a witty and angry God.  (If the Adam and Eve reference holds true, then LaBute is surely the God).

Perhaps the crowning achievement of The Shape of Things is the way that LaBute elicits a tremendous performance from Rachel Weisz.  An actress sadly known for her soulless blockbusters like The Mummy movies and Constantines, she shows a range of emotion as Evelyn- a darkly ominous restlessness that I found highly engaging and rare.  She's alternately sympathetic and contemptible, sometimes at the same time.  Weisz also happens to pull off what seems to be one of the most contrived and ridiculous endings ever- LaBute's weakest moment as a director.  Rudd, Weller, and Mol all shine in their roles, but it is Weisz who most transcends her director's artificiality and achieves something that, ironically, her character most dismisses: humanity.",1116201600,6,4177,5.278366111951589

Now, I didn't really like the movie. I thought it was horrible how much that girl put that boy through for the sake of ""art."" But in the same sense, I think everyone should see it.

This movie really made me think about many things. It made me think of myself, my actions, things that I had done all in the sake of ""love,"" all in the sake for being deemed attractive.

The ""dark comedy"" description is misleading. It's flat-out dark and cruel with no redeeming features. The ""artist"" as sociopath theme didn't wash. I wish I'd never seen it, and I hope I don't encounter anyone who liked it. I don't need that type of person in my world. Yes, the end is exactly that creepy.",1110412800,12,505,4.260416666666667
1485256,3,B00005JMBQ,"'The Shape of Things' has gifted acting talents marred by the self-indulgent director.  I'm talking about Rachel Weisz and Neil LaBute, and if you love Ms. Weisz, anyway you like the film, no matter what taste it leaves in your mouth.  One thing is clear; she can act, but has a straneg penchant for selecting the wrong project.

This film is based on the London stage production (in which Rachel Weisz was in), about four young art college students.  Weisz is sexy and independent-thinking Evelyn, who meets an unassuming, slightly geeky boy Adam (Paul Rudd) in a museum.  After the surprisingly light, casual conversations exchanged between them, they start to date each other.

Naturally, it is Evelyn who leads the relations between them, and she changes Adam into a more sophisticated, attractive guy.  As this metamorphosis is going on, Adam's realtions with other friends (and a couple in love with one another) Jenny and Philip begin to be influenced, not always in a favorable way.

Neil LaBute loves controversial matters and shows it full-scale.  I don't discuss the ending, or Evelyn's personality, but the origin of the film is too clear.  'The Shape of Things' is an inverted version of 'My Fair Lady' (to which the film refers briefly), and well, the diretor surely made the point.

But the film cannot hide its too stagy nature, and more damaging thing is, though the film is impressive in revealing the hidden (so he supposes) motives in our relations, more cool, rational thinking would inevitably lead you to the conclusion that the film's characters are just cyphers.  If you know, directly or indirectly, someone who acts like Evelyn, please raise your hand.  No one?

The good thing, and perhaps the only thing for you to see here, is the acting of Rachel Weisz.  Her deft performance makes the character of Evelyn more human than the one found on Mr. LaBute's misguided script, and if you do not believe in the whole 'presentation' (which no college would allow, I am sure), Rachel Weisz barely makes you, giving a realistic touch to the otherwise monsterously incredible character.

Again, I say, Rachel Weisz's great acting is the only reason for you to see the film unless you want to see the 'Truths' about the manipulative relations between humans.  No matter how these views in the film are distorted by someone's 'original' visions, her acting talent is a genuine one.",1106524800,10,2398,4.896039603960396
1485257,5,B00005JMBQ,"The characters spend a lot of time obsessing and arguing about things that hardly seem worth the trouble, but there's more than enough to keep you interested. First of all, it's nicely unusual in that it's more of a PLAY, which is what it was originally and they didn't tamper with that, yet it works well as a film; you don't find yourself wishing for more. It's basically just four characters, and you don't really need much of anything else  --  just put them out there and let them go at it. Plus, as luck would have it, they're charming and attractive, which helps (actually one of  the guys isn't necessarily that attractive at first, but he gets better as he goes along), and, in spite of themselves they're somehow interesting.

A major issue of the film is the question of ""What is 'art'"" (don't worry too much about this until you're done seeing it). To me, the question almost doesn't matter, because whether it's art or not, all I know is that I'm against it. But still, while many people find the portrayal troubling and I did too, I'm sorry but I also found it funny as hell. We don't hear this said very much, but I'm sure I'm not alone in it.

This was my first exposure to Neil LaBute, and I see that regardless of how we might feel about any particular one of his works, he's an original and interesting writer and filmmaker. You never know what you're going to get from him, except that it's going to be different than what you'd get from anybody else.",1101600000,4,1471,4.413284132841328

1485259,4,B00005JMBQ,"Interesting yet true look at relationships is probably the best film we have had on the subject in a very long time. The topics raise are true in a lot of ways and it does require multiply viewing just to understand the underlying message that Neil Labute its trying to say. Its very easy to say that what Evelyn did to Adam was wrong but in essence if you saw the movie little more closely, you would have notice the fact that she had told Adam numerous time on what she was up to. So Evelyn is really not that responsible for the outcome of the film, and Adam is not as innocent as some might think he was. He did after all let her to it to him, and he did it willingly, despite the warnings and the hints she gave him.  So to put it in a better perspective, the only honest character in the whole film was in fact Evelyn, and that is because you knew where she stood. The other characters in the film ether lived in denial or just did not know what they really wanted.

The acting in this film is a major factor, and the entire cast should be commented for their great performances. Paul Rudd gave a tight woven performance that walked the balance between innocents and desire. You root for Adam and feel sorry for him but deep down, you know that he was asking for the betrayal, and deep down you know that he somewhat deserved it. Gretchen Mol is fantastic as Jenny, the woman who had her eye on Adam since the beginning and is more attracted to him now since his makeover. Her performance is a contrast of character and emotions because while she desire Adam, she also wants to believe that her boyfriend Phillip can change, despite the fact that he will not. Frederick Weller is great as Phillip, a man torn between his own macho ego and his own insecurities. He wants to protect Adam from Evelyn but he is doing it more out of fear than friendship, even though his heart may be in the right place. He portrays the right amount of macho grace but lying beneath lies an insecurity that he wants to keep hidden. The best performance out of the entire cast belongs to Rachel Weisz, who brings a raw and uninhibited sense of independence to her role as Evelyn. She walks a fine line between rebellion and insecurity, displaying Evelyn's own strength and weakness in full view of the audience. Her role is the riskiest one of all and the most dangerous, especially in the last act where her speech to the audience is not only the pay off of the entire movie but a real look at a character who is emotionally damage in every sense of the word. Rachel Weisz is an extraordinary actress with uncanny talent, and she brings out the best in every movie she has ever done. She is simply amazing in this film, and her performance in this film will go down as one of the best performances I have ever seen an actor do in a film.

Neil Labute has an eye on the ugliness of the Human spirit, but if you look closely at his work, you would notice that he is simply warning people of the evil that we can inflict on others and ourselves.

I won't spoil what actually happens at the end for those who want to watch (although I certainly recommend against it).  It is at the end of the movie, however, that the writer/director stopped make, well, I don't know, choices, I guess.  It is as if LaBute got to the end and had to find a way to put the conceit behind this movie on film, and just stuttered to a halt.  The substance of the conceit is interesting enough, and probably could have been execute well.  But, instead, we get this self indulgent clunker.  I actually tuned into this because I liked other films by Neil LaBute, but - wow! - I'll think twice in the future.  On the other hand, maybe I'm being too harsh:  After all, since the movie ends with the presentation of a graduate thesis project, maybe the director intended to make the end of his film look as much like one as possible.",1091232000,5,971,4.35

What Evelyn did to Adam was a complete violation of trust and a total disregard of  consideration toward a human being.  By utilizing a false premise of love Evelyn was able to manipulate Adam into doing almost anything to make her happy.  She treated Adam like he was a test rat and all he ever did was love her and worship her(it's hard to count Adam's unfaithfulness against him since Evelyn was deceitful from the start). Although it was unfair and cruel, I actually liked this film and highly recommend it to anyone who likes to argue about morality vs. art or for those out there who just think Paul Rudd's cute; he is just adorable in this film (from beginning to end)!:)",1078444800,2,1030,4.4
1485343,2,B00005JMBQ,"I really wanted to like this film. I've seen two of the cast members in other projects, and liked them quite well. The film is about a different perspective, thinking outside the box, the meaning of things subjective versus a collective reality. All that kitschy, philosophical stuff.
But like its subject, the piece falls flat on its face.
Art must connect in some way in order to affect its subject. You cannot annihilate your audience, then expect them to love you and your work when you show them how stupid and uninformed you think they are. That's pretty narrow-minded, and is anything but artistic.
How easy it must be to think you have all the answers, to be able to force-feed your perspective and walk away feeling superior, whether or not you are agreed with.
It's offensive. It sets up a road block the size of the Great Wall of China.
The Shape of Things may be art, but my reality is that I think it's pretentious, psuedo-pious manure.
Not one likable character, actor or piece of story is to be had in this obviously filmed play. It feels at times like we are watching an acting class on conflict: everyone running around in improvised states of anger. Now let's try anger with walking, anger with stomping, anger with hand gestures.
Rachel Weisz should be sent over to get Saddam to talk. She's more irritating than a hangnail while you're peeling an orange.

1485344,4,B00005JMBQ,"Neil LaBute is a force to reckon with.  In THE SHAPE OF THINGS he has transferred his four character play (using the original actors) to the screen without resorting to a lot of cinematic chicanery to alter his message about art imitating life imitating art.  Though the dialogue feels stilted in the beginning (the ending of the story is so well concealed that we the audience are literally part of the charade), LaBute guides his quartet of actors through vignettes that trap us deeper and deeper into the jolting ending with phenomenal ease.  Rachel Weisz is the guiding charlatan on this adventure and her willing model is Paul Rudd, believably undergoing the transformation from an overweight nerd into a fit and classy man about campus (the college of scene is aptly named 'Mercy College').  The unknowing other 'players' in this tale are Gretchen Mol and Frederick Weller who add a dimension of reality to the progressing project.  In the end we understand that we have been witnessing the dark side of comedy and we are left with the question ""What constitutes Art?"" - and it is at this point that we wish we could return to the beginning and fully appreciate just how fine is LaBute's writing.

1485345,4,B00005JMBQ,"I have never seen any of this directors other films, so I wasn't prepared for the shocking conclusion of this one!  From reading about his other movies, those who are fans of his would be more likely to see it coming I imagine!
The basic story involves only four characters and from what I've read, is adapted from a 4-person play which explains a lot of the extended scenes.  Adam (Paul Rudd) is an overweight nerd who works in a museum.  When Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) comes in and attempts to deface a statue's genitalia, the two meet.  Adam is immediately smitten and is surprised when the beautiful, artsy Evelyn flirts with him.  The two begin a relationship and Evelyn steadily begins to change things about Adam.  At first, she just gets him to change his hair style and start jogging.  The changes get steadily larger and include getting plastic surgery on his nose, getting rid of his favorite jacket and him getting a tattoo of her initials.  She also gets him to ditch his best friends, engaged couple Phillip and Jenny (Frederick Weller and Gretchen Mol).
While I say I wasn't prepared for the shocking conclusion, I did realize soon in to the film exactly what Evelyn was up to.  I was expecting there to be some sort of twist to it that would make Adam wise up to her, but there wasn't any of that.  I was a little disappointed because it seemed way too obvious what Evelyn was going to do.  Also, the way the ending was pulled off was a little awkward and stiff.  The rest of the movie was much better, I don't think the ending did it justice.
Overall the acting in the film was good, the only complaint I would have is Frederick Weller was a little over the top with his character.  There are some scenes, especially the one in the park between Adam and Jenny, that were obviously shot in one take, which is impressive!  Rarely do you see a 10-15 minute scene done in one long take anymore.  The film was shot in very few locations, I think only around ten.  I'm assuming this is because it was originally a play, it wasn't meant to have dozens of sets.  The dialogue is overall well written (until the end) and despite being somewhat disappointed by the conclusion, I still enjoyed most of the film.",1074902400,2,2213,4.465174129353234
1485346,5,B00005JMBQ,"Neil Labute's look at the way we let each other change ourselves to be the perfect mate is almost as good as his disturbing, and down right horrifying first movie ""In The Company Of Men."" Paul Rudd plays Adam, a dorky security guard that meets an outcast named Evelyn play by the beautiful and extremely talented Rachel Weisz. They begin to go out with each other, and Evelyn begin to change Adam a little at first in his appearance and demeanor. The change slowing gives Adam the confidence he always wanted and the people in his life begins to take notice in the sudden changes in him. Then the way Evelyn continues to change Adam becomes a bit extreme, even going as far as to have him go and get plastic surgery. In true Neil Labute fashion, nothing is what is meant to be, and the reasons for the changes in Adam becomes horrifying clear in the end, and nothing will ever be the same again for him, and the people around him.
This is hands down Neil's best movie since In the Company of Men. The only problem I have with the film is the fact that it can't shake off it's stage roots and some of the scenes feel too off key to be real but besides that, its as scary and as disturbing as it's predecessor. Paul Rudd is great as the low maintenance Adam, and he brings a sense of humanity to his role and a sense of mischief as well. Gretchen Mole and Fred Weller are good as his bewildered friends, but It's the phenomenal performance of Rachel Weisz, who blends a sense of danger, insecurity, and deadly smarts in her role of Evelyn that makes this film as powerful as it is. Weisz is down right riveting, and you can not take your eyes off of her.

1485351,5,B00005JMBQ,"I think that many people are surprised at this film and do not view it in its intent because they do not know the story behind it.  The film is actually a stage play and is therefore set up as one.  The actors performed the play onstage for several months before beginning shooting and therefore their portrayal of the characters is much like that of actors onstage.  The delivery of the lines is a little overexaggerated because the script is written that way.  The scenes are comprised of long chunks, not like films are made today.  With modern movies, there are cuts everywhere, usually not allowing many scenes to last longer than five minutes without cuts back and forth between character and giving more of an illusion of movement.  However, becuase this film is based on a stage play, it is shot very much like it has been staged in a theater, not cutting back and forth between the characters every ten seconds and giving more of a lingering view on the characters.  This is not to highlight physical movement, but to allow the viewer to absorb the main focus of the film:  the dialogue.  The key to understanding and enjoying the film is to listen closely to what is being said and the subtleties of the language.
As far as film to screen transition, I believe the director did well, considering he was trying to preserve the feel of the film as a staged play.  It is executed very well, especially since it was shot in under twenty days and is an independent film.  I would agree that if I had not known that this had been a play before it was a film, I would be greatly confused.  It is clear that the purpose of the film was not to make a big motion picture based on the play, but to preserve the feeling and nuance of the play in a film version.  Knowing that this is the motivation behind the movie, I feel that people would be able to enjoy the film more and really allow themselves to think about the issues it raises, for that's what the purpose is; not to impress, but to inspire thinking.",1066608000,3,2008,4.394594594594595

It's not a perfect movie, but it kept my interest and I liked the cast.  And at least in my realm of movie watching, the twist was original.",1517788800,,289,4.071428571428571

All I can say is I collect movies and have nearly 600 I purchased and MAYBE 60 that I was really impressed with. I had no idea this movie would be as good as it was and would recommend this to ANYONE. At this time, this is in my Top 10. I guess it's ""R"" rated, but in today's standards it's nothing any age group couldn't watch. Younger viewers may not understand what's going on as much, but it isn't going to offend anyone. All I can say is it is definitely worth watching and I'll just bet you'll enjoy it and be as surprised as I was.",1480723200,,683,3.8857142857142857

So the story begins with a humble student of Adam. He stars in the sky are not enough, and lives like a normal person. His life is boring and uninteresting. It seems that nothing can change his lifestyle. But there it was! In his fate appears extravagant, emancipated and free-spirited girl Evelyn.

A little more and we the audience, along with Adam, we believe his luck. But unfortunately, the truth will be very bitter.
This drama movie is which has important and deep meaning. And this meaning lies in the simple phrase: express yourself, don't repress yourself.",1435363200,,1052,4.81767955801105
