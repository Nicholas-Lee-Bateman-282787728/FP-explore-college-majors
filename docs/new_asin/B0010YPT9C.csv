8239421,5,B0010YPT9C,"This entire series of ""America's Game"" DVD's are absolutely phenomenal!!  I ended up buying this one after purchasing several others because I was so impressed.  Plus, I was sitting in Iraq watching bits and pieces this Superbowl, so it was nice to be able to go back and enjoy this in the comfort of the good old US of A!

I highly recommend any of the ""America's Game"" series.  The Giants, 49ers, and Broncos sets are extremely good as well.",1325289600,,443,4.5

8239423,5,B0010YPT9C,"I had DVR'd this off the NFL network and was distressed when a storm erased it.  It was a blessing in disguise, because the extra material on here is phenominal (""...like a big glass of...kool aid, that you are sipping...not even using a straw..."").  Ive always been a Bucs fan and this video is the next best thing to getting to go for beers with Chuckie and Sapp, both of whom are remarkably engaging and funny on this video.

My advice to you, though, is to skip this and look for the full set at a reasonable price.  I got it for $30 and it is the best DVD investment I have ever made.  Seeing these proud old warrriors telling the behind the scenes stories, laughing...crying... it is moving and is the essence of why I love this sport.",1267574400,3,741,4.302158273381295
8239424,5,B0010YPT9C,"These documentaries are just spectacular. I thought I knew it all about the 2002 Bucs, but this DVD reveals more behind the scenes trivia. Overall it's a great companion to the Super Bowl dvd.",1228435200,3,192,4.676470588235294
