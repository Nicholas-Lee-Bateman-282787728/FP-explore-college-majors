7964943,1,B0000694W7,"I regret buying this dvd, it may be a good 'intro to an intro' to a middle school student. There is nothing in it that cannot be found on the internet for free. I truly believe I wasted my money on this product, unlike some other dvds of Standard Deviants.",1203120000,4,256,4.14
7964944,3,B0000694W7,"I hesitate to use the word finance since this 30 min dvd barely mentioned the word stocks & doesn't even mention a 401K. This is best for grade school or middle school or those who handle money like them. Most of the content is about knowing if you spend more then you earn, you won't get far. There was about 5 minutes on how investing (doesn't even say in what/how) is better then sitting in your mattress. It's cute, it's not boring, good skits, but won't tell you HOW to invest or how to understand red tape of financial management.",1199404800,7,536,4.37
