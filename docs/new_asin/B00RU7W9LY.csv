6935627,5,B00RU7W9LY,"Cenk Batu was a riveting series about a Turkish undercover agent in Germany. The main character is both courageious and considerate.
My only regret is that there are no more in the series :(  This often happens in a good series and I don't understand why.",1431388800,7,255,4.543478260869565
6935628,5,B00RU7W9LY,"The acting is superb and the plots very interesting.  Sometimes I had to take a breather because there was just too much action and danger that made me nervous.  Also, the main character is very likeable which I prefer on these.  I've started getting into the ""German Noir"" and they are competing nicely with the Scandinavians.",1428883200,10,327,4.803571428571429

8695872,4,B00RU7W9LY,"Cenk Batu is a Turk, born in Germany and a member of the LKA, State Bureau of Investigation, which, because of his heritage, lends him to various investigative and police agencies to perform undercover assignments. As such, this is mostly a ""lone wolf"" show where our lead only infrequently interacts with his handler Ewe. Set in Hamburg, topics include industrial espionage, state secrets, organ theft, financial crimes and a Baader-Meinhof like story of anarchist terrorism. Each generally fast-paced episode runs approximately an hour and a half and stands on it own. There are, however, romantic interludes threaded through the six movies and, when they appear, slow down the pace as if they were part of another program. Hamburg is shown off well with both industrial areas and the broader metropolis. The color palate is dark, like many Scandanavian series, but it is consistent with a city set on the North Sea with its many rainy days. There is lots of swearing but I don't remember any nudity. The last two episodes have more hand held camera work, which this reviewer really hates. Unless the viewer speaks German, one must rely on reading the very legible subtitles and having a shaky background makes that more difficult. There are more gaps in logic in the story line than many but they generally are covered with the near ubiquitous use of cell phones. The handy devices keep the plot moving by having the principals verbalize explanations and advance the story line without additional scenes. Mehmet Kurtulus is believable as the lead and all the acting, as well as production is first rate. Only one series has been made

Cenk Batu is part of the Tatort (Scene of the Crime) franchise that has been running in Germany for decades. Each series set in a different city and some series have run for years. Cenk is the only Tatort series I know of that is available with English subtitles. The Tatort Series might be compared to the old NBC Sunday Night mysteries which ran Colombo, McMillan and Wife, McCloud and other series under one broad title. The Tatort series tend to be darker and more gritty than the American series mentioned. One oddity though, is the opening credits and music; they instantly made me think of that this was a QM Production...Remember the series, the Streets of San Francisco? A Quinn Martin production!

I believe that reading and attempting to digest the subtitles in these non-U.S. programs forces a deeper investment in the story than just viewing the normal American crime drama. When the story turns out good, that enjoyment is enhanced. These are pretty good and there is a real plot twist a the end that I didn't see coming. Recommended.",1453507200,5,2686,4.87527352297593

8695879,3,B00RU7W9LY,"The premise, a German Turck, going undercover to resolve big issue crimes, like industrial espionage, suicide bombers etc., appealed to me, and was the reason I bought it. The subjects of the issues were potentially good.
But I found there were many ""holes"" in the story lines. A mystery series should have  ""airtight"" plots. This is indicative of sloppy writing.
e.g. in the story about infiltrating a jihadist plot for suicide bombing, the undercover agent, was left to produce the explosives all by HIMSELF without at least a witness or supervision, even though the leader KNEW that he was a police agent, so he was able to THROW OUT the chemicals.!!",1434067200,4,653,4.882882882882883
