8361708,5,B000ZNQ150,"This DVD is marketed as a documentary, and it is, to the extent that it shows the process of two musical traditions coming together to create a new musical composition by the Canadian composer Michael Tenzer.  Mr. Tenzer is perhaps the leading Western composer of gamelan music, significantly extending the explorations of Colin McPhee and Lou Harrison.

Beyond showing the process of musicians learning a completely new style of music, however, this is also an intimate postcard for anyone who has visited Bali and who has been captivated by the music and dancing preserved on the island.  If you have been to Ubud and neighboring Pengekosan, you'll likely recognize at least a few of the many venues shown in the film.  If you have been fortunate to see Cudamani--an amazing gamalan ensemble--either on tour abroad or in residence in Bali, the film shows how this brilliant group incorporates Western instrumentation into its practice and performance.

The shadow puppet and gamelan factory segments are nice inclusions since most tourists to Bali would see neither unless they seek them out.

In short, as a musician interested in ""world music,"" as someone interested in delving a bit deeper into Bali culture than the tourist might encounter, or as someone fascinated by how musical inspiration and composition become a performance, this film should be of great interest.

Video and audio quality are excellent.  Those familiar with Bali will feel immediately transported back to their experience of sensual vibrant colors and mesmerizing gamelan sounds.

Highly recommended.",1199145600,2,1579,5.258964143426295
