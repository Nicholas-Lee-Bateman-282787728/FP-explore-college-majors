3916445,5,B002EAYE0Q,"I was thrilled to get a DVD of this movie after trying for almost 20 years to find it.  I used to watch old movies on late night television and it was one of my favorites. The story of ""High Pockets"" and her valor is very inspiring and reminds us that women made great contributions and sacrifices in the name of justice and freedom long before the 70's women's lib movement.  The National Spy Museum in Washington DC provides a lot of history/information about these brave women and how critical they were to our intellegence efforts. Bravo!",1312675200,7,542,4.577319587628866
3916446,4,B002EAYE0Q,This amazing spy story is true and was made into a feature film- I loved all the intrigue- I love true spy stories and this one is great!,1302825600,2,137,3.9285714285714284
3916447,3,B002EAYE0Q,"Ann Dvorak gives a very gutsy performance in this exploitation drama. Her husband is killed after being taken prisoner in Bataan when he defies the order of a cruel Japanese solder to not drink from typhloid contaminated water. She is left behind with a little girl (They marry during his army deployment, and no one explains who the father is) and Ann masquerades as an Italian night club singer in the Phillipines who gives Japenese military secrets to the Americans.  Sooner or later, her cover, ""high pockets"" is revealed and she is taken prisoner to be tortured to the point of being kicked in the head by the colonel who had first felt a romantic attachment to her. He's ready to pull out his large boot and hooray.. the Army raids the island to rescue her. Sort of a familiar Republic Theater show from TV, it was an attempt to capitalize on anti-communist paranoia and the Korean War in the 1950's. Also on my rare want list: Anyone seen 1956's Young Guns with Russ Tamblyn?",1279238400,4,982,4.611428571428571

8367073,3,B002EAYE0Q,This is a historical film that I have been wanting to see for years.  It fudged the story a bit ..... she was executed..... but it was fascinating how the filmmakers dealt with is very anti-Japanese story in the post-war era.,1467676800,,225,4.487804878048781
8367074,5,B002EAYE0Q,"A real live woman who did real live things and with sheer will and nerve made a huge difference in the lives of tens of thousands; maybe millions.
Movie still as good as it was when I first saw it in 1951 or so.
My disk appears to have run out of space at the end.
Looking at the laser tracks there does not seem to be any room left and the movie ended abruptly just as the Medal Of Freedom presentation ceremony popped onto the screen.
Would have like to have seen the end of the movie.
Buy, on Amazon.com the book ""THE GENERALS""  by Groom for a good idea of the whole picture.  $18.93 prime  $3.99 used good plus $3.99 postage. ($7.98)  This book is a must have to see the picture of sacrifices made off shore during the wars I remember the onshore sacrifices made during the war by the American people like yesterday when there were many things ""no found in stores"" even if you had ration stamps for them.
Please take the time to use your search engine to read about Claire Phillips ""high pockets""",1465862400,2,1000,4.247368421052632
8367075,5,B002EAYE0Q,"This is, without a doubt, the best WWII movie I have ever seen.  We have collected quite a few over the years.  Thanks, Amazon, for making this one available.  I think the fact that this movie is based on a true story, just makes it mean so much more.  The patriotism and the ""help one another"" that is displayed, is very moving.  Ann Dvorak is excellent and, also, one of my favorites.  Her acting was always the best, and this is no exception.  The casting was well thought out.  I do not want to give any of the plot away, but, if you like WWII drama with just the right amount of humor, this is a must see.",1451433600,2,610,4.110169491525424
8367076,4,B002EAYE0Q,"I have been looking for this film for years. I had memories of it from my childhood, not knowing the name of it and the actors I searched the web for years and finally found it at amazon. funny thing is, it was on TV a week after I purchased it.",1430265600,2,245,3.823529411764706

8367078,3,B002EAYE0Q,"I remembered this movie from when I was a kid and was excited to be able to see it again.  It is a good story but  a bit slow.  Not as exciting some 50 years later.  I was extremely disappointed in the editing of this version.  In the scene where Japan was bombing the Americans, the aircraft dropping the bombs were American B-29 bombers.  In the final scenes where we Americans were bombing the Japanese aircraft carrier, the aircraft used were Japanese Mitsubishi G4M---we called this bombers a ""Betty"".  Sloppy inattention to detail!",1409097600,2,537,4.709677419354839
8367079,3,B002EAYE0Q,"This movie, like in most cases, does not relay the events as vividly and completely as does the comprehensively written book.",1368057600,,125,5.0
8367080,5,B002EAYE0Q,The movie was one of  my all time favorites and I haven't seen it in many years. Quality was excellent,1364947200,,102,4.1
8367081,5,B002EAYE0Q,"Very good movie, it should be required viewing for the youth of today. They, as well as, many of the older generation have no clue what these people did, the dangers they faced to perserve the freedoms we still enjoy as Americans. Three other eye openers, dealing with this period of time, are A Man Called Intrepid, The Great Raid (also a movie) and Cast No Shadow should be required reading from 11th grade through graduation from High School.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Man-Called-Intrepid-The-Incredible-WWII-Narrative-of-the-Hero-Whose-Spy-Network-and-Secret-Diplomacy-Changed-the-Course-of-History/dp/159921170X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Man Called Intrepid: The Incredible WWII Narrative of the Hero Whose Spy Network and Secret Diplomacy Changed the Course of History</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Raid-on-Cabanatuan-Rescuing-the-Doomed-Ghosts-of-Bataan-and-Corregidor/dp/0471037427/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Raid on Cabanatuan: Rescuing the Doomed Ghosts of Bataan and Corregidor</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cast-No-Shadow-The-Life-of-the-American-Spy-Who-Changed-the-Course-of-World-War-II/dp/0394575563/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cast No Shadow: The Life of the American Spy Who Changed the Course of World War II</a>",1335744000,2,1384,9.10948905109489
