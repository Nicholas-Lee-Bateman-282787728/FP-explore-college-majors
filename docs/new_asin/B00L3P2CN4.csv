8663640,2,B00L3P2CN4,"Haven't checked the movies yet, but I'm not a fan of this packaging.

The case is a 2 disc case -- so they stuck 2 Blu-ray discs on top of one another. The 3rd one has its own slot.  Now it doesn't look like the top disc is scratched, but I'll have to check playback. It should have come in a 3 disc case.

It's a good deal, triple feature and all, but what's the point if one of the discs ends up scratched? Now I'm going to have to order a set of 3 disc cases...which I don't need, except for to repackage this Blu-ray set.",1421280000,2,525,3.8878504672897196
