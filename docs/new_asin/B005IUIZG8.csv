8475042,5,B005IUIZG8,I cannot believe Forrest Griffin lost his second fight with Shogun Rua! The first fight between them was 100% my favorite fight Forrest ever fought. I tore my BSN Finish First shirt in half after I found out about this loss!,1490745600,,224,4.487804878048781
8475043,5,B005IUIZG8,I'm a huge UFC fan an ufc 134 Rio definitely didn't disappoint at all all the fights are very excellent and the shogun vs griffin will definitely make you say wow and Silva vs okami was just like I thought it would be a slugfest so I will say I got my moneys worth and a great DVD to have if you don't own it.,1473379200,,309,3.769230769230769
8475044,3,B005IUIZG8,"The three matches I mostly bought this dvd for; Silva vs Okami, Nogeira vs Schaub, and Griffin vs Rua 2 were worth buying this dvd alone because they all ended with finishes. The card overall was decent. The main thing I liked about this event is that the UFC finally returned to Brazil.",1339718400,,287,4.433962264150943
