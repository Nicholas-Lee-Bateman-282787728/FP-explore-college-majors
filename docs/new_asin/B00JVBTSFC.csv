The Who DVD Collectors Box is a must for mods and rockers! Anyone who has an interest in the upper echelons of the pop format will find an immense satisfaction from a 2 disc box set which clocks in at a very generous 156 minutes. Associates and assessors unite to front a forum and along with priceless footage this cast can explain the nuances of a generation where rebellion and rhythm came to the fore.
One element of the package is The Who-Under Review 1964-1968 and this disseminates the early, energetic endeavour of one of the most influential acts of all time. Those nascent days saw the legendary pairing of Roger Daltrey and Pete Townsend (a duo that still carries the name of The Who to this very day). The other primary players in the band were the late, great rhythm partnership of Keith Moon and John Entwhistle This fiery four went on to create the loudest rock band in the world-but, it was noise with poise as the decibels were met with dexterity. In particular a string of stellar singles made for some of the greatest 7 releases of that or any other era. This account of the story places the viewer in to the eye of the storm and our knowledge of an electric era becomes far more rounded via an entertaining insight in to the development of these Britpop pioneers. The archive action turns up so many magnificent moments that lead one to reach out for a greatest hits album to further absorb the magnitude of this majestic musical momentum
The other half of the produce comes under the banner of The Who: The Mods and the Quadrophenia Collection as a vision of the 60s comes through the eye of a 70s needle. A 1973 soundtrack was followed by a movie-and, that study of youthful culture came through the medium of the mod movement. In particular the focus was on the multi dimensional Jimmy Cooper as was perfectly portrayed on the big screen by Phil Daniels. An analysis of any release should be objective but a personal take of this merchandise comes with a bonus slap on the back because the celluloid experience of Quadrophenia ranks in the high numbers when it comes to scoring my film favourites. It was a Sunday afternoon trip to the sadly departed White Palace cinema in Pontypridd during the initial 1979 run that provided an opening personal encounter-but that has been followed by many sittings since! Therefore, to delve deeper in the nuances and nuggets connected to this premier rites of passage presentation is essential for not only me but also for countless others.
The knock on effect of The Who and their muscle also led to a mod revival around and after Quadrophenia and that occurrence is also given due diligence. If you had another purchase in mind Substitute it for this quality commodity because there is a need for this collection-Anyway Anyhow Anywhere!",1474502400,,2835,4.643426294820717

8654000,1,B00JVBTSFC,"I bought this set and should have been tipped off to its content when I saw on the back of the box""...NOT SANCTIONED BY THE ARTIST...""  This DVD is a total ripoff of Who fans. The first disc is just a chronology of their singles up until the year 1969 with commentary by total unknowns who write for various British music magazines. The second disc is a mockumentary of how the Who influenced the Mod culture. I very begrudgingly give this 1 star and that is for the second disc. If you are a Who fan or are interested in the Who DO NOT BUY this,instead buy the superb Amazing Journey DVD set or The Kids Are Alright, do not waste your money on this so called collectors bix",1406592000,6,674,4.224806201550388
