1023347,1,6305335907,"I bought this tape because I had heard so much about Tae Bo.  I tried the tape, then did a 1 hour tae bo workout at my club.  What a difference!  The Club workout was more intense (25 minutes is not nearly enough) was better  choreographed and the instructor's instructions could actually be  understood.
This video is hard to follow.  It is difficult to figure out  what he wants you to do, and the camera shots don't help.  Half the time,  the camera is not even on Billy when he is explaining what to do, it is on  someone in the class.  There is virtually no warm up, not nearly enough  stretching.  Be sure to stretch on your own first.
I bought this because  I thought the 2 video pack was a bit pricey.  What a mistake.  Now I plan  to buy the ""real"" video set soon.",922060800,,773,4.149659863945578
1023348,1,6305335907,"I have Billy's Tae Bo tapes and absolutely LOVE them, but this one leaves alot to be desired!  I thought this would be a different form of workout (cuz it was supposedly made in 1999) to kinda spice things up a little, but  you could tell there must've been a huge mirror on the other side of the  camera cuz the women couldn't stop looking at themselves and making what  they thought to be sexy poses in the camera that they even would loose  their place in the ""workout""!  They looked like they just got out  of the hair salon with enough makeup on Tammy Faye would be embarrassed.  The REAL tae bo workout tapes with those people on them, are TRULY working  out and not afraid of getting sweaty.  The techniques were good in this  one, if you can get past the egos and silliness.  Also, what was up with  the dancing??",921715200,,821,4.287581699346405
1023349,5,6305335907,"If you want to learn some fun exercise tae-boxing combos, kicks and all, then this video is great!  Really the best thing to do seems to be to learn the combos and then repeat them on your own (while not watching the video)  to music and get a good sweat working.  The moves work many muscle groups  in a fun way.  Just don't forget to warm up and stretch (stretch before and  after).  The video is very inspirational for those that want to learn, but  could be VERY discouraging for people that aren't very coordinated.",921369600,,520,4.4
1023538,1,6305335907,"This is really a horrible workout video.  I don't think Billy Blanks had ever done the routine in the tape before it was made.  Most of the time he couldn't follow along with all the people behind him or he'd be telling them to do something and they'd be doing something else.  I just follow them anyway.  This tape includes two workouts that are both very short considering the long warm-ups and cool-downs.  The same moves from Tae bo are used in this workout, but there's only time for about one repetition of each.  You can get some cardio workout from this tape (if you do the whole thing at once skipping the cool down of the first and the warm up of the second, but that's annoying) however, you don't get any of the toning of the `normal' tae bo workouts.  Skip this and head straight to the other non-crunch tae bo workouts which are great.",1041638400,,849,4.369426751592357
1023539,2,6305335907,"I rented this video because I wanted to get a peek before I purchased. What a disappointment. Blanks didn't even bother to do the exercises most of the time. He did one or two reps, and then just watched the others. It was boring too. I don't see how you can expect for people at home to get into the workout, when the guy leading the thing doesn't. Glad I didn't buy this one!",1037923200,,377,4.108108108108108
1023540,2,6305335907,"I love kickboxing and tae bo . . . I have several different tapes that I use.  This tape was one big mistake.  The workout has no continuity, the camera work is awful, and Billy moves so fast that I had no idea what he was doing.  I would recommend Billy's Blanks Tae Bo series before I would ever recommend this tape.",1029801600,,318,4.096774193548387
1023541,5,6305335907,"There are 2 workouts in this awsome tape, the first half is a workout that has different combos of moves at a steady pace and it teaches you unique punches and kicking combos, you'll break a pretty good sweat after one session of this workout. The second half is a fat blasting amazing fun kickboxing workout that has the same moves and combos from the first workout but this time at a faster pace with much higher intesity. In this workout you'll break a way bigger sweat than you do in the first half, and you'll tone your arms, legs, and stomach and you'll feel the brun after your first workout. This video will help you burn mega calories, lose weight, tone your whole entire body and teach you self defense techniques.",1028592000,,724,4.492424242424242
1023542,3,6305335907,"And I have to say that I personally thought it was awesome. I mean, true, Billy did seem a little vain by not even performing the already pre-rehearsed moves himself, but for this to be my first kickboxing tape, i enjoyed it. I am sure it will get extremely boring to me in a few weeks, in which I will advance to a harder tae video. But for ones who are just starting out, I think they may find it an interesting alternative, or addition to aerobics and step workouts. Kicking and boxing moves with the all too popular ""aeeeya!"" karate yell allows me to release some stress, too.",1022544000,,580,4.330275229357798
1023543,1,6305335907,"Normally, I love Tae-Bo and everything about Billy Blanks' strategies. However, this video is a huge disappointment.
I workout with his other videos, as well as doing Pilates, yoga and the treadmill. I use these videos to spice up my workouts, and give me a change of pace. This particular example is very short-- each workout is only about 25 minutes. There are minimal repetitions with each move he teaches (say, 8-10 for each move). This is hardly enough time to feel the impact of the exercise, let alone move on!
 The participants are uncoordinated, and confusing, as they continue to do the move after Billy Blanks has moved on to the next position.
If you are used to Tae-Bo, and think this video will be a nice detour from the usual, choose a different tape. This one is hands-down, the least effective workout video I've bought in a long time!",1011052800,,852,4.642384105960265
1023544,1,6305335907,"I need something a bit more challenging than this.  Talk about boring...i'm so ticked I wasted my money...too slow didn't break a sweat and definetly not energetic.  Billy just doesn't have a ""pump you up"" attitude in this video.  It's BLAH!",999820800,,241,4.829268292682927
1023545,1,6305335907,"This tape is a disgrace to the Tae Bo name.  I ordered this tape thinking it would be an alternative to my regular Tae Bo Advance Work out, but to my surprise I found out it was NOT.
This video is ,hands downs, one of the worse put together exercise tapes I have ever scene.  For starters ITS TOO SLOW.
WARM UP---HAH--- how can you warm up your muscles going at a snail's pace.  I was very annoyed by the fact that all of the people in the video knew the routine already and Billy Blanks was soo caught up in himself that he didn't even take the time to explain what to do.  He spend the whole video talking (usually in Tae Bo Advance, this gives me some where to focus my energy--- on Billy),but this time it was just an outword display of his vanity.
I don't think Billy did any of the exercises full out and the people in the background annoyed me sooo much.  They had the nerve to know the routine and still manage to make it look a complete mess. This video was a production----not a workout! Billy attempts to look [racy] with his new facial hair and the background ""dancers"" pretty much top it off.
Intense---I think I missed that part.  This workout, for lack of a better term, should be burned and never talked about again.  IT [STINKS]!!!!
If you want a real workout, just buy Tae Bo Advanced. It will save you time, money and the energy you will use bashing Crunch--Tae Bo Workout (HAH!)",996364800,,1398,4.2727272727272725
1023546,3,6305335907,it helps but after you have it for a while you get tired and they go slow,995587200,,73,3.3529411764705883
1023547,1,6305335907,"I have a used the Tae Bo tapes and was enthused to find out Crunch had a similar video.  Unfortunately, this is a very different video.  It is slow to start and hard to follow.  It cuts away at key moments of instruction.  At the end of the video, I was left wondering where it would begin.  I didn't feel like I had worked out at all and was highly disappointed.",993427200,,363,4.056338028169014
1023694,2,6305335907,"Billy Blanks is in his usual form in this workout, showing how certain moves can be used in self-defense situations and motivating in a suave way. But this video looks like someone taped it from the TV and edited out the commercials. At one point you're just getting into the exercise, and it cuts to the Crunch logo without warning and a whole other segment begins. The background people know the routine better than Billy does, as he's often standing there talking while the group continues with the workout. He also  stops once or twice to show off his own moves and encourages his group behind him to do so as well. It's a good workout if you don't mind the choppy editing and lack of cueing on Billy's part.  You really have to apply yourself and fill in the blank spots in this workout (NO pun intended).",984355200,,810,4.466216216216216
1023695,1,6305335907,"The only person in this video who knew the routine was Billy.  Everyone else fumbled along.  And by the time you figured out his move, he'd change and go to the next one.  Then there was the couple of gals who not only didn't know what they were doing, I think they were actually flirting with the camera men.  This video was a complete waste of time.  Try the Crunch Abs and Arms for a better workout.",984355200,,402,4.1688311688311686
1023696,5,6305335907,"I am just starting out. Being an over weight housewife, I found this video lively and do-able! Billy takes the time to warm you up and stretch you out. After just 3 days I was not sore anymore after working out. Billy gives you the proper encouragment if you can't do this, then do this. He allows you to work at your own pace. I can feel the results after only two weeks.",979171200,,372,4.109589041095891
1023697,5,6305335907,"This tape compared to the other basic and advanced tape is really better due to the techniques displayed and taught. The punching combo's and the kicking techniques are great. If these type of techniques were taught in  the other tapes, I possibly would have bought them to. But the enthusiams  was better displayed by the CRUNCH team.",964915200,2,335,4.859649122807017
1023698,1,6305335907,"I purchased this tape with the impression that is was going to be a high-energy, challenging, fast-paced workout. Well, it was energetic. It was challenging to follow due to MAJOR lack of instruction. Banks neglected  to instruct the proper positions on many sets.  It was extremely difficult  to follow and I found myself lost. I liked regular tae-bo and wanted a  quick tape for variety....this Definately is not it.",963532800,2,418,5.0144927536231885
1023699,5,6305335907,"As a Fitness & Nutrition Specialist, I truly believe this workout video is a great buy. Not only is it available at a great price, but it also gives you such a wonderful workout. Unlike the Tae Bo tapes in his Tae  Bo series, this video offers a good amount of stretching for warming up and  cooling down, which helps to prevent injury.
I think that Billy Blanks  has had bad reviews due to the strain involved in the workouts in his Tae  Bo series. They don't offer nearly as much stretching or emphisis on proper  form as this video does.
Save money and time buying this video instead  of the ones from his series, and you'll be on your way to a stronger and  toned body!",963273600,5,673,4.251968503937008
1023700,4,6305335907,"I have been working with the video for about three weeks and I am experiencing quick results. It gives me a good workout that is not boring and I sweat. At the point you are jumping up out of the bed to go  downstairs and insert a tape into the VCR, you definitely have found  something that you enjoy.
Finally a workout that is not boring.",947808000,,340,4.136363636363637
1023701,4,6305335907,"I agree the tape was obviously done before Billy Blanks developed his Tae Bo technique, and there are some ""moments"" that are obviously not professiional.  However, there is a warm-up and a cool-down inspite of what  other reviews here have said, and it is possible to shape up using this  video.  I have lost 8 pounds and an inch and a half doing this.  I find it  a quick and easy way to include a work-out into my busy schedule.  I do not  consider myself co-ordinated at all, but had no trouble following the  moves.  Since I have had some leg injuries, I find it helpful to follow  Billy's slower moves, yet the more intense moves are there for those who  want them, as well.  Who says you have to sweat to shape up?  And if I want  more sweat, I work-out harder.  For ten dollars, and a quick work-out I  think it's a good deal.  I recomend it to my inexperienced YMCA members  where I am receptionist, and have bought copies for our aerobics  instructors, who basically have the same opinion of the video as I do.",935625600,4,1020,4.324468085106383

7889019,1,6305335907,"This workout video is a joke! The group is obviously being led by someone behind the camera. The whole time they are doing their own thing with Billy ""walking it out"" most of the time not to mention they only do 8 reps of everything so you don't even get winded and I am not in that great of shape. The thermostat must be cranked up to 90 degrees because everyone in the video is sweating profusely and I know it would take a lot more than that to get them that sweaty because they are all in fantastic shape and as I stated before I barely broke a sweat. Bottom line don't waste your money! There are a lot of other great workouts out there!",1360454400,,642,4.103174603174603

7889021,4,6305335907,"I'm more than willing to concede that some of the women in this video are obnoxious (sorry Shellie -- stop hooting and stealing lines), the production value is obviously low, and Billy isn't really leading the group ... but aside from that, this is an excellent workout. I've lost 15 pounds and 4 inches in less than 3 months. I'm also clumsy, awkward, and suffer from joint problems, and even *I* was able to do these moves. Taking it slowly at first was the key to not overdoing it and getting hurt. I've got the set of original Tae-Bo videos and look forward to trying those next!",1206576000,,583,4.457943925233645
7889022,1,6305335907,"It's awful. Just awful.  Don't waste your time and money.  I've heard good things about Billy, so I know he can do better.  Try Crunch: Boot Camp instead.  It's a very fun workout, and you WILL work up a good sweat in 30 minutes. Plus the instructor is actually instructing you and not just standing in front of her class.  A much better buy than this video.",1153958400,,358,4.2835820895522385
7889023,1,6305335907,"I totally agree with others who gave this video a poor review. One person mentioned that by the second part the background people were on ""auto pilot"", without any introduction of what the heck we were doing. It was hard to keep up and Billy didn't really seem to know the correct and reasonable time in the music to start the reps, so a couple times it was off the beat which got annoying. It was sort of bizarre how right after the warm up the people on the video were sweating like pigs, and I wasn't even winded yet. When he DOES decide to explain the moves, he spends so much time doing them slowly and then only does it like once fast. He seemed to like to show off too, all his fancy kicks and such, and I can't get through the beginning without cracking up, where the camera goes down the people in the line, and ends on him with that robe thing on and he says in this serious voice all the stuff about ""kickology"" and stuff. Its a bad video, don't buy it.",1104883200,3,964,4.132978723404255
7889024,2,6305335907,"I LOVE Crunch videos. I have also enjoyed Tae Bo and Boxing videos before because they are a great workout. I hated this one. It was slow moving in the begining and very unbalanced. Once you got to the second part, the people behind him were on auto-pilot without any cuing from Billy. After five minutes of standing there and trying to figure out what was going on, I shut it off and did one of my Crunch videos that would guarantee a good workout. I was glad I rented this from the library instead of wasting money on a disappointing video.",1076025600,2,542,4.323529411764706
