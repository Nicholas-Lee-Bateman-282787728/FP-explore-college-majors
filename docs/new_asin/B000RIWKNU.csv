8200878,4,B000RIWKNU,"Note first that you can, depending on where you look, find a minimum of two versions of this movie:  The first is the original uncut Chinese dialog with English subtitles, the second is an English-only dub.  Despite Chinese script covering the front, side, and back covers, this movie falls firmly into the second category.

Note also that this movie is fantastic in the original language, and that several localizations (every one that I've seen, but not necessarily all) cut plot elements and alter dialog.

Unfortunately, this version does both of these things.  Not terribly so, but definitely noticeable if what you were expecting was the unedited Chinese subtitled version.  Overall, still a fantastic movie.",1270252800,3,714,5.219298245614035
