7991243,4,B00009K77Z,"Don't have a whole lot to say about this movie other than I highly recommend it. I just happened to catch this on some movie channel recently and new I just had to own it. File it under 'quirky sex-comedy'. The reason this movie flew under the radar is probably because Jenny McCarthy is the only ""name"" for the most part in the movie. Oh yeah, there is also the dad from Sixteen Candles and some guy I remember from The Last Nights of Disco.

Not a huge McCarthy fan to begin with, but see this movie! McCarthy plays an aspiring news reporter who keeps having bad run-ins with a would-be writer- who is having nothing but frustrating questions about his own dating life. Believe it or not, although not a very popular actress, McCarthy does really well in her role and makes this movie so much fun. If you want to laugh hard and don't mind if 'everything gets wrapped up in a neat little bow' at the end - see this fun flic right now!",1395273600,,935,4.2824858757062145
7991244,5,B00009K77Z,Great movie that I can watch time and time again. Jenny McCarthy has real attitude throughout. It's a movie that is very underrated.,1385769600,,132,4.782608695652174
7991245,1,B00009K77Z,I thought this movie might be good because I LOVED dirty love.  This movie DEEPLY disappointed me.  It was so uninteresting I didn't even follow the plot very well. Waste of my time. YIKES.,1378944000,,189,4.529411764705882
7991246,5,B00009K77Z,"Jenny McCarthy is excellent in this movie. She's not only beautiful, but a very entertaining comedienne. I'm going to try her other DVD's.",1373241600,,138,5.043478260869565
7991247,1,B00009K77Z,"Sorry I can't recommend this one.  I bought it USED (thankfully) based on all the nice/good reviews here. I don't think we watched the same film.

If you don't like movies where the characters talk to the viewer, you won't like this one.",1158537600,4,237,4.488372093023256
7991248,5,B00009K77Z,"I don't write reviews, and I don't purhase movies but I'm doing both for this one.

What a great movie. In a time when most humor has really stupid sophomoric humor, this movie is smart, fast, clever and unexpectedly expected. Enough said. Rent or buy this movie. Watch it and prepare yourself to watch it again. Get a kleenex because you'll laugh so hard you'll cry.",1144195200,7,367,4.5606060606060606
7991249,5,B00009K77Z,"""Crazy Little Thing"" is an intelligent comedy about relationships.  I'm surprised its not more popular, but that's probably due to it's ""R"" rating.  Whitney (Jenny McCarthy) keeps running into Jimmy (Chris Eigeman) during the movie and they think they despise each other.  Whitney has a crazy neighbor Dee (Drea de Matteo) who helps her figure how to meet men.  Jimmy has a friend who realizes his sexual preference isn't female and he goes through some major changes, while his other friend has a relationship with a girl in High School which is funny and sad at the same time.  Rent or buy it if you haven't seen it, because you probably won't be disappointed if you like this type of humor.",1131840000,12,693,4.694214876033058
