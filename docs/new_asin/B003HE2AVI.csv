4125557,5,B003HE2AVI,Nikki showcases her great repertoire of music and I'm sure any Jazz fan will love this DVD.,1278201600,,91,4.411764705882353
4125558,5,B003HE2AVI,Nikki Yanofsky is an awesomely gifted singer regardless of age. The fact that she is only sixteen at present is mind boggling. She is already a seasoned performer and appears capable of any style of music. First of all she is a real jazz singer that can do Ella Fitzgerald type vocals and can do pop tunes and soul tunes and whatever she chooses to do as she has an amazing voice and vocal technique and is  incredibly versatile. She mixes genres although jazz and Ella Fitzgerald's vocals are her first love. She should appeal to fans of jazz and pop and soul as she is awesome at many types of music. She is extremely intelligent for her age of sixteen and is very confident on stage. She is very charming and pretty also which doesn't hurt. Technically gifted beyond even some great and much older established female singers in jazz and pop the sky seems to be the limit for her. Considering that as she gets older she will have had even more experience and her voice will mature into a deeper range is exciting to ponder as she is so awesome already. She is richly deserving of huge success already and although she is a prodigy she shouldn't be considered special just because of her young age but extra special as a singer of any age. It is difficult to think of a female singer that is her equal in so many genres all at the same time. An amazing and spectacular talent for sure. Do yourself a favor and buy her dvds and cds and discover her for yourself ahead of the rest of the world.,1277769600,15,1493,4.351254480286738
4125559,5,B003HE2AVI,"Must have DVD for any Nikki Yanofsky fan. I already have her new CD, Nikki, and the 1st concert DVD/CD combo, ""Ella... of Thee I Swing"", but this new concert DVD is even better! Visual detail and clarity is every bit as good as can be squeezed from the DVD format, which is actually very good. The 5.1 sound mix is clean, detailed and imerseive. Two new songs, unavailable anywhere else, ""New to Me"", and ""Thinking of Someone"" are an special treat. Her live performances have an special energy and emotion that is simply unparalleled. If you have even an passing interest in Jazz, get this DVD! You won't be disappointed.",1275609600,23,621,4.603603603603603
4125560,5,B003HE2AVI,"I was happy to see that this DVD includes my favorite tracks from her CD, but really excited that it also included several songs that were not on her CD. Almost every track sounds better than her CD. This is surprising since they appear to have been recorded at almost the exact time. She just gets more into the music when she's performing live and that shows in the overall quality of her voice.

If you like her CD you will love this DVD.",1354924800,,441,4.25
4125561,5,B003HE2AVI,"I enjoyed the CD. Her talent is outstanding and the back up musicians were wonderful. I gave this as a gift for my wife, who also enjoys jazz.",1349481600,,142,4.107142857142857
4125562,3,B003HE2AVI,"Let me say this up front:  If my review was only rated based on Nikki Yanofsky's singing, then this DVD would be 5-stars, but, unfortunately, as I will note  later in the review, some of her band falters in places on this DVD--enough that I keep going back to her first CD/DVD instead of this one.  Lesson here:  First-rate singers--think Ella Fitzgerald, Tony Bennett, Frank Sinatra--always tried to work with bands stocked with 100% first-rate musicians.

Inevitably, comparisons will be made between this concert DVD and Ms. Yanofsky's debut concert CD/DVD ""Ella . . . Of Thee I Swing.""  In both, Ms. Yanofsky performs in front of a live audience, and in both she shows that she is both comfortable and fearless performing in front of a live audience.  Unlike so many modern singers, Nikki seems to perform her best in front of a crowd, rather than in the studio--though her third production, her self-titled CD ""Nikki,"" shows that she can perform quite competently in the studio, as well.  When one listens to Nikki sing on this DVD, it is clear that her voice has matured and smoothed compared to her first CD/DVD, and that she is even more comfortable in front of an audience, though her first effort was a ""shock and awe"" confident performance, considering that she was 13 years old at the time.

In that first CD/DVD, Ms. Yanofsky sang in front of a first-rate 16-piece big band, with every chair filled with first-rate players competent both as ensemble players and as soloists.  The band was ""tight"" and swinging.  Nikki knew it, the audience knew it, and that swinging band enhanced Nikki's already formidable performance that night.  Unfortunately, things didn't work so well here.  The band here is admittedly differently configured--likely to better enable them to play a mix of pop and jazz, as well as to make up a practical traveling unit.  Only two players from the original band featured on ""Ella . . . Of Thee I Swing"" remain on this second DVD--the trombonist, and Rob Fahie, the bassist.  A comment here about Rob Fahie:  He has been with Nikki from the start, and figures heavily in her success.  He has done many of the musical arrangements, has been the ""band master,"" and is a fine bassist, to boot.  I put him on my short list as one of the best jazz bassists playing today.  Added to the band for this DVD are three backup singers, an organist, and two guitarists, but gone is the string section and all of the horn section, except for one trombone, one trumpet, one alto saxophone, and one baritone saxophone.  And therein lies the reason that this DVD only gets 3 stars from me.  Quite bluntly, this ensemble--especially that horn section--is just not consistent, cohesive and swinging on some of this outing, and it actually detracts from Nikki's singing on a couple of tunes.

The alto saxophonist, at least on this DVD (he seems better on the subsequent ""Nikki"" album), is just ill-suited for Nikki's singing style.  A great example for comparison is Nikki's performance of ""Lullaby of Birdland"" on her first DVD compared with this one.  On this tune, Nikki's phrasing, already extremely good on her first DVD, is even smoother and better here--but the saxophone solo sounds harsh, squawky, and almost sophomoric on this outing compared with the delicious, swinging tenor sax solo delivered on the first DVD, and that nearly spoils this tune for me on this DVD.  When one uses a limited horn section such as this, it requires that they be able to play very cohesively to deliver a good sound and too often here that just does not happen.

On this DVD, some of the best tunes--and a couple of them are just wonderful--are those where Nikki sings with only the rhythm section--piano, bass, drums, and guitar.  For me, the delight of the DVD is Nikki's humorous and deliciously swinging version of Rodgers and Hart's ""Everything I Have Belongs to You""--swinging rhythm section with Nikki's lovely, smooth, but swinging delivery.  Same with ""You Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini)"".

If this DVD proves anything, it is that Nikki Yanofsky can pretty much sing anything that she wants to quite well--be that jazz, pop, blues, as well as her own compositions.  All of which begs the question:  So just how good a jazz singer is she?  And I say ""jazz singer"" because, frankly, that is what Nikki sings best, notwithstanding her comments that she is not just a jazz singer.  Well, if one ignores her age, I would still rate her a solid 7-8 on a scale of 10--understanding that only the jazz giants of the likes such as Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, or Sarah Vaughan would rate a ""10"" on my scale.  In the current crop of jazz singers, female vocalists such as Tierney Sutton, Roberta Gambarini, and Stacey Kent still have Nikki beat--but they are all two to three times Nikki's age and all have considerably more years of singing experience than young Nikki does.  If one factors into the rating that Nikki was still under 16 years old when this DVD was recorded--well, then she is off-the-charts good.  Through her own talent and singing maturity, Nikki Yanofsky can no longer trade on her youth, though.  The cute, precocious little 13-year old that ""wowed"" audiences with her almost unbelievably mature jazz chops for her age on her first album has been replaced by a very attractive young woman with a maturing voice and singing style to match.  Despite her still young age, she really can not be thought of as a ""child singer"" any longer.  She's hit the big leagues now.  Now, if that horn section could just match up to her talent.",1299542400,4,5562,4.747138397502601
4125563,5,B003HE2AVI,"Great selection of songs highlighting this young artist's incredible talent. Although well known in her native Canada, she is bound to be the next Celine Dion here in the US.",1284768000,,174,4.833333333333333
4125564,4,B003HE2AVI,"Nikki displays incredible talent in her singing, especially for such a young person.  Her parents have kept her close to home for most of her youthful years.
Most of her performances have been in her home country, Canada.  She will soon
tour in USA.  She is an amazingly ""gifted"" Jazz-Pop-Soul-Blues style singer. She was only 16 when this was performed.  She seems to have the potential to develop into one of the best singers of her generation.",1282867200,,446,4.753246753246753
4125565,5,B003HE2AVI,"This DVD will never be far away from my DVD player,as I find much to praise life about when I see and hear this beautiful young girl perform.

It assures me that there are still young people out there that are creating,not destroying,and that the God given voice is still one of the best instruments around.

The music is positive and pleasant to listen to,Miss Yanofsky'S command of earlier vocal art forms is inspiring,and her innocent beauty is a real bonus .especially when you compare her to other entertainers of this time.

I carry her music on my ipod,and never fail to feel better once I am listening to her.....Oh.....don't let the i[od mislead you....I am 70 years old,but never want to be without a song!!!!

Do yourself a favor,invest in this girl's music.......you won't be disappointed!",1280448000,4,801,4.824817518248175
4125566,5,B003HE2AVI,"I saw this on television once and had to have it because I was amazed at the talent and musical maturity of such a young performer. The band is smoking and Nikki is beyond talented in tone, texture, timing and charismatic charm. This is a must buy to have in your collection. You will watch this many times and never tire of it. It is quite impressive. I just can't wait to see what treasures Nikki will offer over the coming years. Thankfully, she is making this music exciting.",1279497600,,479,4.393258426966292
4125567,5,B003HE2AVI,"Absolutely incredible! What this girl has done over the past 4 years is breathtaking. Watch this and be amazed. Never a dull moment, mature and funny at the same time. A great grasp of the music. You will not regret buying this.",1279411200,7,228,4.4523809523809526
4125568,5,B003HE2AVI,Nikki is such a talented young lady!! This DVD is awesome!! I highly recommend it!!,1279065600,,83,4.6
4125569,5,B003HE2AVI,"Nikki yanofsky is one of a kind talent! At her age she is almost a reincarnation of Ella Fitzgerald. Her strong voice and phrasing of a song is almost unheard of in this day and age. If you love jazz or any kind of music for that matter, She is a force in the music world that should be around for a long time to come. A talent like hers comes around once in a lifetime and her choice of music hopefully will be picked up by the younger generations. It's time to bring the real sounds of music back and Nikki is by far the greatest spokesman for it. May her talent never fade!.",1278979200,,577,4.026086956521739

8397016,5,B003HE2AVI,"I watched her DVD again and again and purchased a few for gifts. She makes me wonder how many other people out there have such giftedness of musical ability and interpretation. I bet she is one in many, many millions. I am so thankful she has shared her gift with all of us. She gives 100%.",1388534400,,290,4.196428571428571

8397018,5,B003HE2AVI,Nikki is an amazing talent.  As a music professional I'm quite critical of performance issues.  I've never heard her sing ANYTHING out of tune and her ornamentation (while somewhat rehearsed) is flawless.  Live performances are the best way to judge talent in my opinion and she flat rocks.  It's performers like her that are breathing new life into classic jazz.,1371168000,,363,5.0
8397019,4,B003HE2AVI,"I do enjoy Nikki - a lot. But as she matures some of the playfulness has waned. She still nails every song but I wasn't smitten by the concert as a whole. I'm glad I got the DVD. I will watch it again in a few months, but I had been hoping for a bit more of the ""old"" Nikki sparkle when she was more of a kid.",1366243200,,309,3.5588235294117645
