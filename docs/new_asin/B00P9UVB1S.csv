6791159,4,B00P9UVB1S,"Scream Factory brings one classic supernatural comedy and an extremely problematic tale of the presumed undead to Blu-ray for the first time ever with the Vampires Kiss / High Spirits Double Feature release. Vampires Kiss is questionable because of its uneven tone and unintentional annoyances thanks to one of the most unbearable accents ever heard from Nicolas Cage. Lets just say that if you were to watch both of these movies in one night you might feel like you were on an emotionally draining rollercoaster ride.

In Vampires Kiss, the life of white-collar New Yorker Peter (Nicolas Cage) seems to revolve solely around making as much money and sleeping with as many women as possible. After a typical night of scouring trendy bars for some action, Peter manages to take home the sexy Rachel (Jennifer Beals), who bites him on the neck while they're in bed. The next day, Peter is certain he is now a vampire. Though no one shares his point of view and he hasn't changed physically, he dons fake fangs and begins stalking women.

High Spirits revolves around Irish hotelier Peter Plunkett (Peter O'Toole). The failed proprietor attempts to fill the chronic vacancies at his castle by launching an advertising campaign that wrongly portrays the property as haunted. Unfortunately, he fails to scare a single American tourist with his hokey and dreadfully unconvincing effects. When two actual ghosts, Mary (Daryl Hannah) and Martin (Liam Neeson), show up to add some authenticity, they end up falling for two guests, Sharon (Beverly D'Angelo) and Jack (Steve Guttenberg).

The bonus material for Scream Factorys Vampires Kiss / High Spirits Double Feature is less than what weve come to expect from the detail-oriented company. The most exciting extra is audio commentary by Director Robert Bierman and actor Nicolas Cage for Vampires Kiss. The fact that Cage would actually sit through this mess and talk about it is proof that he will do just about anything for a buck these days. I say this with the utmost respect for the man, who I fully support in even his most lampooned roles such as his Ghost Rider and Left Behind turns. A theatrical trailer is included as well.

High Spirits doesnt have any special features. I cant believe they couldn't get a theatrical trailer or an interview with Steve Guttenberg, Beverly DAngelo, or even Peter Gallagher about the making of the film.

Vampires Kiss is rated R for sex and nudity, violence and gore, profanity, alcohol and smoking, and frightening and intense scenes. Theres a short attempted rape scene which isn't detailed. High Spirits is rated PG-13 for adult situations, language, alcohol and smoking, mild violence, and some frightening scenes.

Scream Factorys Vampires Kiss / High Spirits Double Feature is a mixed bag of horror comedy and failed social commentary. Vampires Kiss could be looked at as a sophisticated take on the phrase looking for love in the all wrong place if it weren't so poorly executed. High Spirits saves the day with its gothic setting, all-star cast, and 1980s flair. Vampires Kiss is one of those missteps that have to be seen to be believed while High Spirits is simply an enjoyable supernatural tale of romance and haunted hijinks.",1424390400,8,3224,4.983271375464684

that makes a GREAT grave-yard-companion to this double feature:
""Love At First Bite/Once Bitten""

One of the few times that a double-feature release DOESN'T have a stinker. These
movies didn't win any Oscars, true, and they're probably---three of the four movies
I recommend---180-away from the 1931 Dracula flick--- don't stress the -factor, but,
DO have that '80s romantic-horromedy thing going for it. Did you know Nic Cage wanted

6791189,5,B00P9UVB1S,"Look I haven't watched High Sprits but I'd give this 6 stars just based on Vampires Kiss being on Blu-ray. This is proof that Nick Cage may be the finest method actor out there. You can disagree with the directorial choices and the writing but if you ever asked yourself what if a weird guy thought that he was becoming a vampire but wasn't becoming a vampire Nick Cage delivers in spades. This may the weirdest, craziest, awesomest movie you could ever have the joy of viewing. If that were it would be good enough but then you can watch it with Nick Cage telling you all about him being crazy and why the alphabet needed to be recited in such an aggressive way in the commentary track. I am not saying it is a cinematic masterpiece but it is a must see if you are a fan of quoting movies with your friends while you laugh at a horror movie that just isn't scary.",1448841600,7,864,4.242424242424242

6791193,3,B00P9UVB1S,"Neither of these movies will win a Oscar, but they are not that bad. Vampire's Kiss for me is the better of the two movies. It is a horror comedy movie or a horror tragedy movie depending on how you view the plot and the ending. High Spirits is not bad but could have been better. Both movies were made in the 80's. Both movies are squeezed on one Blu-ray disc side A. I would prefer each movie on its own DVD but since this is a Blu-ray disc - movie quality for both are good. Both movies are in Widescreen 1:85 format. Two movies for the price of one, not a bad deal.",1440633600,,569,4.0

6791198,3,B00P9UVB1S,"Shout/Scream Factory has been doing a great job of the double features theyve been issuing, bringing back many lesser known films from the past. While many are collectors dreams the majority of the public is likely to have forgotten some of these films. In truth, some are better left forgotten while others are finally getting the blu-ray treatment they deserve. Which brings us to VAMPIRES KISS, a movie that I would think even the most die-hard fan of Nicolas Cage would have to say should have had a stake driven through it.

In the movie Cage plays Peter Loew, a publishing executive who treats his employees like dirt while thinking he is above it all. On a night out Peter picks up a woman he feels mysteriously drawn to. The next day he begins to worry about just who this woman was, going so far as to believe that she was a vampire who has infected him. Displaying the most insane behavior possible, Peter begins to act out the delusion he seems to be feeling. Spouting vampire teeth that he picks up somewhere, his downward spiral into madness is played for comic relief rather than actual horror.

The first problem with the movie (among many) is the terrible English accent Cage decided to employ here. While critics ripped on Kevin Costner for not using one in his Robin Hood film it seems like he made the right choice if that accent would have ended up anything like what care uses here. Its more insulting to the English people than Austin Powers English teeth. On top of that the movie wavers back and forth, trying to decide if there is indeed an actual vampire causing Peters problems or is it all in his head with neither truly satisfying that answer. Add to that Cages extreme use of overacting here and you have what many would call a bad movie. It did little at the box office, little on video release and went unnoticed or unclaimed until it was put as part of a double feature here. I can recommend this for the extreme Cage fans only and even then with some reservations.

HIGH SPIRITS on the other hand is a true joy. I remember seeing this in the theater when it was released and enjoying it from start to finish. Directed by Neil Jordan (who also did THE COMPANY OF WOLVES, THE CRYING GAME, MONA LISA and MICHAEL COLLINS) the movie is a comedic romp in the haunted halls of a dying castle that might find new life with the number of ghost hunting and paranormal programs on TV these days.

Peter OToole stars as Peter Plunkett, the owner of an old Irish castle that has seen far better days. In near ruins and about to be bought out by a land developer to be torn down, Plunkett comes up with the idea of touting the castle turned hotel into a haunted attraction in hopes turning around the fortunes of his inheritance. Recruiting the ever loyal staff in his endeavor, a group of tourist arrive in the hopes of finding the ghost they believe to be real. The ineptitude of the staff in staging their hauntings makes for some funny moments that unfortunately result in the guests wanting to leave.

As fate would have it though there are actual ghosts in the castle, one of which (Daryl Hannah) is saved by guest Steve Guttenberg. Having been stuck in the castle for centuries after her husband (Liam Neeson) killed her there, the intervention of Guttenberg could result in her moving on to the afterlife. The fact that she has fallen in love with him doesnt help things, even more so when it turns out that his wife (Beverly DAngelo) is the daughter of the man trying to buy the castle.

The movie is played for laughs from the antics of the staff to the hijinks of the guest who are all there for their own reasons. The father of the one family that shows is a paranormal researcher out to debunk the entire charade only to find the real ghosts more than he bargained for. A soon to be priest (Peter Gallagher) ends up possibly changing his mind when he meets Meg Tilly. And OToole does a tremendous job as the desperate hotel owner willing to do anything to keep the family castle and discovering there is more history in it than he bargained for not to mention more love of the location for familial reasons than he thought he possessed.

While the movie isn't the deeply dramatic film that Jordan is known for, he does display a knack for bringing laughs to the screen. Not only that but even though the center piece for the ghosts involves a murder and the lack of a souls ability to transcend this world, the combination of comedy and romance here work well together. At times the film may seem a bit fast paced but in my opinion that works. Ive never understood why for decades film makers were able to tell a story in 70-90 minutes and yet today directors feel the need to create 3 hours opuses. With this film Jordan tells the story and does it well in only 99 minutes.

Both movies are offered in a clean, crisp clarity associated with blu-ray product, something that even the worst prints cant make appear good if the original film was shot poorly. Here they both look great. Not only that at least one of the movies offers a nice evenings entertainment while the other does little more than take up space on a DVD disc. In any event kudos to Shout/Scream Factory for allowing these movies to live another life.

As for the star rating, 4 stars is due to HIGH SPIRITS. VAMPIRE'S KISS dragged it down to 3.",1431043200,4,5345,4.468237704918033

The main character picks up a woman for a one night stand during which she bites him during some rather aggressive sex. He becomes convinces he's turning into a vampire and starts to lose all grip on reality.
In my opinion the only reason this could be considered a vampire film is because it both bites and sucks.
It's not scary enough to be horror and not funny enough to be a comedy.
Frankly I don't find rape (which took place  off-screen) appropriate for a comedy anyway. I realize that's a matter of opinion, but it didn't add to the movie .
