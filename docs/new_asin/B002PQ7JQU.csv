3965778,5,B002PQ7JQU,"Taxi is a great show with both humor and heart, and the fifth season may be the best example of this. One of the best sitcoms ever. Kudos to CBS/Paramount for releasing all 5 seasons and not leaving Taxi fans hanging.",1262217600,6,217,4.317073170731708
3965779,5,B002PQ7JQU,"I'm 21 years old and LOVE this show, and I'm a huge Andy Kaufman and Christopher Lloyd fan! I really didn't think it would happen that me and other TAXI fans would ever see the day when this season would be released! I didn't even think the third season would be released, but its awesome to see that all the seasons will be on the shelves together soon enough!

Bottom line: pure awesomeness! Tank you veddy much!",1257811200,4,414,4.376623376623376

3965781,4,B002PQ7JQU,"Season 5 of Taxi focuses more on individual characters and their stories rather than the cast as an ensemble. Aside from the episodes where he is featured with Simka, Latka is nearly invisible in all the other episodes. Jeff, the assistant behind the cage, gets his own story-line for this season.

The DVD set itself has a scene that is cut from the original episode(Jim's Marios) where Alex and Jim is playing the piano in Mario's. It is too bad that there are no special features of an any kind(no commentaries, featurettes, etc,). This show isn't that old relatively speaking and most of the cast is still around, would've been nice to hear their thoughts.",1401667200,2,660,4.739130434782608

3965790,5,B002PQ7JQU,"Taxi was one of the best sitcoms of all time. And this final season showcases the talents of all the fine cast. Unlike the early episodes that missed the comedic talents of Christopher LLoyd, this has some of his best work. I just wish his earliest appearances (i.e., the LMAO ""DMV Office"" episode) was in this collection. But hey, for one season, this is really sweet!",1358553600,,369,4.606060606060606
3965791,5,B002PQ7JQU,"This show added more storylines with deeper meaning, that would have killed some sitcoms but this ensemble cast were all accomplished actors. Andy Kaufman was good enough to even work with professional wrestlers in their arena of theater!. The show was one of the best of it's era and it stands tall today. It would be fun to see these in hd someday as well. In reruns or blu ray. But at least we get them on dvd. Of course Andy Kaufman died very young just a few years after this show ended from cancer and his loss to comedy was immense. Much like ernie kovacs back in the 1960's. But that doesn't make this show any less enjoyable, nor does the fact that jeff conaway destroyed his career with drugs and eventually died from them 25 years later or so. At this point the show was leaving in a very strong way. The talent in this one is some ways not matched by many sitcoms to this day. Of course other shows like mary tyler moore and others were up there as well. But Danny Devito, carol cane , and the rest (surviving) still are at it making good productions.",1355529600,,1063,4.293532338308458
3965792,5,B002PQ7JQU,A MUST BUY for any Taxi appreciater.  This is an amazing show. Every episode is so well written and filled with talent.  This show is so rarely on TV any more it's nice to have on DVD.,1349654400,,184,3.945945945945946
3965793,2,B002PQ7JQU,"I applaud Shout! Factory [In reality: CBS/Paramount...as another reader has corrected me] for making it possible for us to have the complete series of Taxi- and I own the entire series....but, I now see why such a once-great show was cancelled. This final season is not like the first four seasons. In this final season, the laughs are fewer and further between; Each episode seems to focus on just one character, and their private life- so the great cast interaction that made the first four seasons so great is less in evidence in this season, as the show takes on more of the feeling of a drama or soap opera, rather than a brilliant sit-com. Many of the episodes are just plain boring: Tony goes to sea with his Merchant Marine father- yawn! (we are deprived of the rest of the Taxi cast for 80% of the episode); Alex deals with his elderly dog (If you love dogs, as do I, this is a real tear-jerker- which is NOT what I watch comedy for!); Jim's father croaks (oh, what a laugh-riot, watching someone deal with the death of a parent alone in their apartment- NOT!); Elaine dates a short, bald insecure dweeb (uh...it could happen...) and the series culminates in an episode about Simka's menstrual problems!(Nothing remotely funny about that).

I don't understand why they chose to tamper with such a once-great show, thus ruining it and sealing it's demise- but they did. If you're a die-hard Taxi fan, you'll want this season anyway; If you're just looking to buy a season or two, or have never seen this show and want to try it, buy season 2, 3, or 4....but not this 5th and final season.

Having said that, there a few eps here which are real gems, and which no Taxi fan would be without- such as A Grand Gesture(It would be worth purchasing this season just for Scatman Crothers's performance in that ep!- and it is also one of the only eps to feature Jeff [J. Alan Thomas] quite prominently in the story (IMO, he was a great character and should have been included in more eps).

Another problem with this season is that Carol Kane, as Latka's wife, Simka, became a regular, and her screeching, grating voice is sheer torture! If nothing else, I'm sure her voice would have caused this show's cancellation- why any producer would inflict such agony on the fans of their show is beyond me, but it was definitely a major factor in the ruination of this show.

Just like the last season of All In The Family, us die-hard fans buy even the seasons which we know are crap (even though I'll likely only atch two eps from this season again)- but for ""normal"" people, stick with seasons 1-4, which are great. This final season is more like an illustration of how to ruin a great show by isolating the characters who worked great as an ensemble, but who just aren't funny alone, without the contrasts and interactions of the others.",1325721600,6,2834,4.550980392156863
3965794,5,B002PQ7JQU,"Taxi was one of the best sit-coms to ever air on TV without a doubt. The series ending was bitter sweet as television lost a fantastic show but soon gained another (Cheers.) A lot of the producers and writers from Cheers went on to create classic episodes and won numerous Emmy Awards throughout the 80s, but they cut their teeth on Taxi. Reverend Jim played by Christopher Lloyd has to be one of the funniest, most original and realized characters to ever grace the small screen, while Latka was Andy Kaufman's comedic tour de force. A pity the show did not go longer, but maybe it's just as well, it never wore out its welcome or ran out of gas like others of its Ilk (Happy Days, Different Strokes etc.)",1314576000,4,706,4.438461538461539
3965795,5,B002PQ7JQU,This series is so much fun to watch again. Such good humor and it is clean. Proves you don't need to be in the gutter to be funny. Makes you miss the good old days,1314230400,,163,3.6857142857142855
3965796,5,B002PQ7JQU,"The series comes to an end, but I have it on DVD to enjoy whenever I want.  Virtually every character that starred in this show went on to further fame in TV and/or movies.  Jeff Conaway, RIP.",1307404800,2,192,4.162162162162162
3965797,4,B002PQ7JQU,"This is a show that was GENIUS.  Granted, it is about cabdrivers.  But where the writers took the characters was amazing.  Not only did we get inventive humor, we got strong characters with range and depth.  Always loved Taxi, ALWAYS!!!!!!!",1301875200,2,240,4.925
3965798,5,B002PQ7JQU,The product came quickly and in new condition. As with the rest of the Taxi series it's terrific fun and poignant. The only negative is that this is the last season. If only it could have continued!,1272067200,2,198,4.378378378378378
3965799,5,B002PQ7JQU,This show ended way too early. This season is full of great episodes. Every episode is full of emotion. Many times you'll be crying while you are watching and then you will start laughing at the same time.  Such a great series that I definitely didn't appreciate as much as I should have 20 years ago. Just a great TV show with great characters and great writing.,1268697600,,363,4.417910447761194
3965800,5,B002PQ7JQU,"This was the final season of a great show.  I DID NOT like the addition of Carol Kane as a regular, as her bad accent and voice is grating, but everything else cancels her out!  Louie DePalma became a sympathetic character for one episode!  ""Taxi"" should have gone a few more seasons.  The new characters introduced on the first 5th season episode could open some great story lines!",1267660800,,382,4.573529411764706
3965801,5,B002PQ7JQU,"The DVD played flawlessly!  My only regret is that Taxi only ran for five seasons.  You must watch these shows more that once, since you miss a few things the first time that you watch it.  I have the other four seasons of Taxi.  I do not have any favoites since all the episodes are equally funny.  The more you watch Taxi the funnier it is!  It always picks up my spirits when I watch an episode.",1265328000,2,398,4.103896103896104
3965802,5,B002PQ7JQU,"I absolutely enjoyed watching Taxi when it was being shown on television, and now I have all 4 Seasons with every single episode.  I would have to say that one of the best and funniest episodes of all, is when Jim goes to the DMV to get a drivers license.  This is the art of comedy at it's best.  Whaaaat does a yellllooooww light mean?  Or when Louis goes to meet his girl friends parents for the first time and has his life threatened by his girl friends mother.  Then there is the episode where Louis makes a deal with God when he is in the hospital where he promises to be a kind lovable person, then goes nuts at the end, is another great, very well written and very funny story.  I have yet to see all the episodes on the final DVDs that I received recently,  but for sure my friends and I will be watching soon what is on there and enjoy the good laughs thanks to these funny artists doing their comedy.  If you enjoyed watching Taxi, then you will enjoy owning these episodes on DVD.  It was a real bummer when Taxi was cancelled.  That was a mistake.",1264896000,2,1060,4.177339901477833
3965803,3,B002PQ7JQU,"The season has some good laughs but the audio is very poor, which appears to be typical of 1980s technology. Good for die-hard TAXI fans, but somewhat boring for 21st century viewers.",1264550400,,183,4.75
3965804,5,B002PQ7JQU,"Although this is an aborted season due to the two retrospective episodes, this season - the final season, and the one which aired on NBC after it was cancelled after four seasons on ABC, pairs a whole lot of funny moments with many poignant ones as well. The episode in which Alex tries to give his dog a great send off before his imminent demise will put a lump in your throat and tears in your eyes. The episode where Louie's blind girlfriend is about to regain her sight looks into the soul of the scoundrel Louie as he ponders his deepest insecurities about his appearance. This may be one of Danny DeVito's finest moments. Plenty of brilliant moments abound making season 5 a real winner, and definitely worth the wait.",1264204800,9,724,4.534351145038168
3965805,5,B002PQ7JQU,Seems like I've been waiting forever to *complete* my Taxi DVD collecion. Great classic sitcom with an all-star cast.,1264032000,,117,5.2105263157894735
3965806,5,B002PQ7JQU,Hilarious !!  A Laff A Minute !!  Lots of Fun !!  Too bad the show lasted only five seasons - it was very well done and the cast was always excellent. we have purchased all five seasons thru amazon and the service has been excellent.,1264032000,,233,4.133333333333334
3965807,3,B002PQ7JQU,"Twenty six years might be a little late to claim dissappointment, problem is that although I saw most Taxi's first 4 season in some form through the years, Season 5 never made it in any shape of form down here in Mexico so I hadn't seen a single episode until this very week. Never before did I understand how such a great show could pummel so badly in the ratings. Today I finally do. Sure, Season 4 had a clunker here and there but it had plenty of great episodes. Season 5 doesn't have a single one that fits this category.
I am aware the Charles/Charles/Burrows team left around this time to do the equally magnificent CHEERS. At least it's good to know where exactly TAXI's laughs went.
You know how a show looks when it's about to be cancelled? TAXI is exhibit A in this category. The cast doesn't seem to be trying much anymore. The jokes are telegraphed way before they occur, specially for Reverend Jim. Latka has thankfully left his ""personalities"" crap behind but his material seems to be getting old in a hurry. Simka's voice might have sounded funny in the beggining, but try enduring it for a whole season! The Alex character who breaks down crying about the death of a 19 year old dog doesn't even ressemble the sharp guy we remmember from past seasons, as recently as the last episode of #4. Suddenly nobody seems to hate Louie anymore and he's become quiet popular for invitations to all types of family events, whatever edge he gave the show is all but gone. The lack of material is so evident the writers even give the bland ""Jeff"" guy more lines than ever before, talk about desperation. Even the shows techinicians don't seem to be giving a damn anymore, notice how when Tony sails out to sea, his shadow from the set's lights moves repeatedly all around the suppossed ""sea skyline"" while nobody seeems to care. Heck, the cabbies don't even seem to be driving taxis anymore, the only reason they show up at the garage is to talk about their problems and the cabs are just there to take them to personal events.
Another Amazon reviewer who wrote about Season 4 claimed Andy Kauffman antics killed TAXI, I beg to differ. What truly killed TAXI was the abrupt end to the show's brilliant writing. Think about the awful episode where Elaine's son takes up boxing and ends up with a broken nose. What kind of earth-shattering or even entertaining dilemma is that for a show like TAXI? (never mind that the kid actor sucks). I won't even get into detail about the one where Alex's dog dies since I don't want MARLEY & ME lovers to follow me to this other section of reviews but, when Alex breaks down crying at the end of the episode it felt like such a desperate plea to extract any emotion from the audience, I truly felt simpathy for Judd Hirsch, no wonder he never got a decent job after TAXI was cancelled. Still, the most ridiculous episode that comes to mind is the one where Elaine dates Simka's monk cousin who has one of those unbelievable sitcom plots in which he has precisely one week to enjoy the world's delights; every previous actor who had protrayed a character from Latka's country has been brilliant enought to speak his hilarious made up language,  until this guy came along that is; he doesn't even try, and his dance routines with Elaine and by himself are beyond pathetic.
Enough, I don't even want to think about Season 5 anymore, luckily there's the first 4 season to watch over and over again and let's not forget it's not like other great shows didn't end up tanking eventually, still, by its fifth season CHEERS was just beggining to pick up steam. It's just a shame TAXI had such a small run.",1262822400,3,3637,4.51896813353566
3965808,4,B002PQ7JQU,"This final season has some great episodes, but it nearly ends with a major atrocity for us ""Taxi"" fans.  Remember the episode where Iggy buys Mario's and all the cabbies help him bring in customers, and he and Alex sits at the piano and everyone sings and has a great time?  Well, the entire piano playing and singing was edited out.  Absolutely no music or singing was viewed or heard.  I was looking forward to seeing this complete episode again and they ruined it by that catastrophic editing.

That's just one disappointment.  Another is the two part episode of ""A Taxi Celebration"".  The picture quality and sound quality is very bad compared to the rest of the episodes.  Luckily, they look fine on the original episodes but what a disappointment, nonetheless.

And, another strange thing that happened while I was watching all three of the DVD's, after the sixth episode, the DVD seems to want to play the second episode over again.  Maybe this only happens because I stopped the DVD, and later went back to just hit ""play"" again, but it happened to me on all three DVD's.  Peculiar, huh?

To me, the least appealing episodes were ""Travel's with my Dad"" Which is about Tony and his dad, ""Sugar Ray Nardo"" with Elaine's son wanting to try boxing and Elaine being way too overprotective.  And ""Love Un-American Style"" was about Latka and Simka arranging for all the cabbies to meet someone who may be a good match for them.  ""Arnie Meets the Kids"" is rather pathetic because Arnie is pathetic because Elaine is much too beautiful to be with such a balding doofus like him.  It's kinda funny, but Arnie and Elaine? No way.

Now, the best episodes which is really like opening a great can of worms because all the other episodes are fabulous classic episodes.  But, if I still have to pick some absolute favorites for this final season, it is definately ""Sceneskies From a Marriage"" where Latka has sex with another cabbie to stay warm and Simka knows just by looking at him that he ""did it with another woman""  so their minister tells Simka that she is suppose to be unfaithful to Latka to save their marriage.  What an excellent interpretation of an extremely warped religion.  Man, then there's  ""Crime and Punishment"", ""Alex Gets Burned by an Old Flame"", ""Louie and the Blind Girl"", ""A Grand Gesture"", and well, all the others.

Any ""Taxi"" fan knows what I'm talking about.  This was a fabulous season for ""Taxi"".  It ended as a strong show.  I can't believe that it got canceled when it did.  But, it's great to finally have all five seasons.  But again, why did they do that blasphemous scene cut from ""Jim's Mario's"".  That's so sad.",1262476800,4,2643,4.6501079913606915
3965809,4,B002PQ7JQU,"TAXI is one of the classic ensemble comedies ever to surface on the small screen. The writing, directing and acting were always superb! The great cast introduced us to Danny DeVito, Tony Danza, Christopher Lloyd, Marilu Henner, Andy Kaufman, Carol Kane and brought us another great series with Judd Hirsch. Season five has always been special to me because of its poignancy. Who can forget episodes like: ""Louie and the Blind Girl"", ""Alex's Old Buddy""' and ""Jim's Inheritance""? The only reason that I am not giving this five stars is because it is slightly edited. Seems CBS/Paramount does not like to pay for music rights. We really saw this in season 4 where ""Vienna Waits"" had a completely different score. Season 5 is not as bad: I only noticed one cut: The Piano bar scene in episode ""JIM'S MARIO'S"". Believe it or not, all of the other original music (including ""You Are The Sunshine Of My Life"" from JIM'S INHERITANCE and ""Cheek to Cheek"" from ELAINE AND THE MONK) is still intact. All in all, Season Five is a triumph! It took a four-year wait for the remaining seasons, but we finally got the entire series of TAXI: A True Celebraition!",1262390400,13,1145,4.701492537313433
