1331791,5,B00003O02T,"Certainly this is the best adaptation of any Dumas novel that I have seen.  Although it doesn't follow the novel precisely, I felt that it accurately captured the spirit of the original, with one exception: When I read the  novel I was captivated by the scenes of communication in code between  Edmond and the Abbe Faria that take place while Edmond is imprisoned in the  Chateau D'If.  Almost all of that is omitted from the movie.  On the other  hand, unlike some other reviewers, I thought the change in the ending was  an improvement -- in fact I think it is one that Dumas would probably have  endorsed.  In his time it might have been considered completely unromantic  to have the hero end up with a widow in her forties who is the mother of a  grown son, even if she is the love of his life, so Dumas, as I recall, has  her choose, however painfully, to spend the rest of her life in a  convent.
In this movie, the small, but pivotal, role of Mercedes is  played by Ornella Muti, who must surely be one of the world's great  beauties and who, judging by this performance, is also a very capable  actress.  When I saw the movie, my only complaint was that she looked too  young for the part.  Then I learned that she was 43 when the movie was made  -- exactly the age of her character.  Anyway, having Edmond end up with  Mercedes seemed to me much more credible than having him end up married to  the nubile Haydee, who is young enough to be his daughter.
Gerard  Depardieu doesn't look anything like what one might imagine of the Count of  Monte Cristo.  However, it doesn't matter.  He is a great actor, with a  wonderful voice, who completely owns the part.",961545600,3,1667,4.3737704918032785
1331792,5,B00003O02T,"""The Count of Monte Cristo"" has been treated better by the movies than Dumas' other classic swashbuckler, ""The Three Musketeers"". Both the Donat and Chamberlain versions are nice, feature  length adaptations of Dumas' long, convoluted novel. This mini-series,  however, is just plain magnificent. The care taken with details and  sub-plots, the haunting performance of Depardieu as Edmond Dantes, the  authentic look of the sets do justice to Dumas' classic. If only the  producers would give us a 3 Musketeers adaptation! My only complaint? Alas,  as most other adaptations, the ending is changed to, perhaps, lighten the  very dark story or romantize it more. Still, one of the greatest  mini-series ever produced. Do not miss it!",960768000,14,732,5.304347826086956
1331793,5,B00003O02T,"Wonderful adaptation of the book, very involving and watchable the entire 400 minutes.  I wish more books were adapted in this fashion.  Reading the French subtitles meant constant attention to the screen to follow what was  going on, but it was worth it.
I had a couple complaints.  First,  Depardieu was too overweight for this role and did not look like someone  who had spent 20 years in a pretty wretched prison.  Yet his acting  qualities are so good I was able to overlook it.  Secondly, I wish they  hadn't changed the ending, because it subtracted from the overall message  of the book.  Not to give it away, but I was able to see how it was all  actually going to end a long way off just by observing the places where the  movie deviated from the book.  Oh well.
Still, it's a lot of hours of  great entertainment, and faithful to the book in most parts, so it gets my  highest rating.  I'm waiting for someone to do the same thing with my  favorite Dumas novel, The Three Musketeers.",958089600,5,994,4.4222222222222225
1331794,3,B00003O02T,"The DVD suffers from poor production values.  There are audio sync problems, video quality is only fair.  Some liberties are taken with continuity and many chapters from the book are eliminated, altered or  greatly abbreviated (well, it is only 400 minutes long).  Gerard  Depardieu's (and the rest of the cast) performance is mediocre.  (see  Gerard in Cyrano de Bergerac to see how good an actor he is when he tries).  Gerard's disguises are totally ridiculous.
On the other hand, this is  the most faithful movie/mini-series of the novel.  And it is great to hear  it in French (I wish the subtitles could be turned off).  I would  definitely recommend that you rent this one.

1331795,5,B00003O02T,"I have never read the book ""Count of Monte Cristo"", so I can't say how closely the film follows it. But I caught this flipping through channels one night and got hooked. I'm stunned at how good this is: great  cinematics, costuming, casting -- first rate production that takes its time  developing like ""I, Claudius"" or other classic lit pieces. But  what's fun about the story is that the Count(Depardieu)is like an early  detective -- a cross between Dracula and Sherlock Holmes.  He's a  wonderfully enigmatic and complex character -- out for revenge yet unable  to help being a decent guy. He dabbles in alchemy, swoops through the  night, dons various disguises.  The story contains several sub-plots that  are like mini ""cases"" the Count resolves, all within a longer,  continuing theme.  The count's side-kick, Bertuccio, was a wonderful  character as well, played by a charmingly original actor.  All in all, this  is one worth buying and playing over and over, whether you're into costume  dramas, A&E Mysteries or romance. And if you're a Depardieu fan, you're  *really* in for a treat.  He's wonderful in this.",951782400,19,1121,4.967567567567568
1331796,5,B00003O02T,"Indeed, this production of the Count of Monte Cristo is truly a breathtaking experience. The director, Josee Dayan, did a marvelous job. And so far, Gerard Depardieu's part as the Count of Monte Cristo is  certainly his career highlight as he shines with an exceptional perfomance.  Even though the movie is in French with English subtitles, nothing of the  tension and continuous action is lost throughout the eight hours running  time. There are no boring scenes in this film and the producers made every  minute count. The shoot took place on location throughout Europe which  produced even more originality and authenticity. And while it is a TV  mini-series, we're glad to say that this production comes across the screen  like a mega-budget motion picture. We think it's the best adaption of  Alexandre Dumas's novel to date. In addition to the great perfomances by  virtually every actor in this film, viewers will certainly also enjoy the  scenery, the set and the costumes. We must say that this motion picture is  an unforgettable adventure.",951696000,10,1051,5.046511627906977

Other video versions tend to do one or the other of the following: (1) they miss all the intricate parts of the novel in the attempt to shorten a 1200-paged novel into a 1.5-hour video; (2) they modify the novel for sensationalism until the bare skeleton of the original story is all that remain.  The one minor problem I had with this version was that the ""happily ever after"" ending was not the ending written in the original novel.

I was so happy to find out that there is a French TV series of my one of my very beloved novels ever!  I am still smarting after watching the Jim Caviezel disaster of a movie (well, less than half the movie, but it still hurts me to think about it).  Gerard Depardieu seemed an odd choice for Edmund, but I knew (or thought I did) that the French would honor Dumas, what with the fact that the series was more than 4 1/2 hours long.
How wrong I was!  Not only is Depardieu a bloated insult to Edmund Dantes, but the series is bad, distorts the novel (Bertuccio has to teach the Count table manners, scare bleu!!  And then they set about finding a mistress to the Count, a dastardly act which makes the Count earthy, mortal, instead of the human embodiment of revenge.  Oh, and the nepotism in the casting, mon Dieu!  At that point I gave up.
I should watch the Richard Chamberlain movie again, after many years.  He did look the part, at least.  Also, I still think of Donald Pleasance when I think of Danglars.  I never saw the Robert Donat version, but I remember him fondly from The Winslow Boy.",1408579200,,1115,4.29665071770335

1331838,5,B00003O02T,"Actor - Gerard Depardieu, in his engaging portrayal of the mysterious COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, immerses the viewer in an intense, all too human battle of inner turmoil, stemming from unwarranted betrayal and justifiable anger. Specifically, in forgiving and letting go of the wrongs done unto him or the avenging of himself to the fullest extent, of all the deliberate injustice that was perpetrated against him. But, as horrific as the sufferings of THE COUNT may be, does he alone, in and of himself, have the right to avenge himself even if it culminates, in murder? For THE COUNT, having amassed enormous wealth... had every valid reason to retaliate. Hence, with the cruel and sadistic battle for power, prestige, wealth, titles, a respectable position in society and the securing of a dwelling place finally - now, behind him, what is a 'rags-to-riches' COUNT, supposed to do particularly with all his enemies, who are now within the palm of his hand? Alexander Dumas -  Author of the Book: THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, based his literary classic on a true-life account which he heard about and after having researched through some old Police Records, that prison portfolio based on actual events, sparked his writing genius. And with the addition of creative license, the phenomenally best selling novel: THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, was born. This 4-part, 2-disc, color, DVD, Mini-Series depiction, is no less, spectacular! You will wonder... how, can people (THE COUNT's enemies), be so callous, cold, cruel, selfish, corrupt and willfully ruthless, and actually sleep peacefully at night? And, just how... does THE COUNT, go about dealing with such savage animals, posing as men who needlessly betrayed him? This foreign French film with it's English subtitles, is clearly understandable in every facet, by any race, creed, color or religion. Because as human beings, in some form or fashion, we have all been betrayed? Whether recently or in your distant past, if you have been betrayed or taken advantage of and suffered mightily because of it and want revenge, then this timeless and epic classic, is a 'must see' for you. Because righteous indignation and just retribution is what - THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, is all about. And I'm of the mind, that ""Forgiveness is one thing but stupidity, is another!"" THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO was done wrong... and now, his enemies (those who needlessly and without mercy - set him up), better run for the hills and hide, because THIS COUNT, will definitely come-a-calling!

Yes, this movie ( compared to the 2002 version ) follows the story line better, but it does so without any emotion and character building. Gerard Depardieu has helped in the making of an insult to Alexandre Dumas, with his horrid acting ( as all the other actors had- who in their right minds chose this cast?? ). It surprised me how emotionless they could be- Oh, I've just learned why I was imprisoned. That's cool. Oh, my dad died of starvation. Whatevs. Oh, I've just escaped from years of imprisonment. Yay. I could go on, but I think my hand would be in pain from typing before I finished. And also, they spent five minutes with Abba Faria before he died. That was terrible! Abba Faria was supposed to become a sort of fatherly character to Dantes, and they should have shown the love and growth between them. Okay, I'll stop ranting about what they did wrong ( mostly because I don't think I could type it all...... Seriously ). But anyways, the movie was an abomination. All these other people love it dearly because, ""Oh, it got the story line MOSTLY correct!"", but it also did so in a confusing, disgustingly acted and directed way.

The production values are excellent and the film's length allows it to explore plot twists either ignored or only hinted at in earlier film adaptations. Gerard Depardieu is as always excellent.

1331851,5,B00003O02T,"I had seen this previously as a two part presentation on tv - initially when I sought to get a copy it was only in French and although my French is passable it was not adequate to understand the story in detail.  I have seen this DVD several times and have enjoyed it thoroughly each time.  I was born by the sea and so a film with such wonderful sea scenes is most thrilling for me.  Depardieu is excellent as the central character and the other actors are excellent as well - it was most thoroughly put together and well produced.  Great care seems to have been taken to make the film authentic and enjoyable.

As there are many supporting characters as well as the central characters I did find it hard to remember them all throughout the action of the film.  This is most likely because I am now in my 70s. After buying this DVD I also bought other versions - because lengthy as this one might appear, certain details are left out as the span of the story is so vast - but this is the most entertaining and enjoyable.  II also bought the book which I had to give up reading as it was very long - over 800 pages.  I found the scholarly forward highly informative and useful - published by Wordsworth Classics.

This book was written as were the stories of Sherlock Holmrs in serial form in a newspaper and magazines - that is why it is so expansive as most serialisations are. New characters would be brought in to enrich the story every week and no doubt readers would be talking to their friends and family about the current week's events cementing the story and its ongoing development in their mind.  This, after all is a French Classic so young people going to school in France would know and critically study its content - something that would not be available to those like myself who grew up in Wales. To bring to the screen a complete version of the story would be extremely expensive - perhaps at some time in the future when computer graphics are more natural and realistic and less extravagant, a full version could be made avoiding the necessary expenses of building vast sets.

The scenes of his double riding horses hell-for-leather just do not work. It's obvious the rider is much younger and slimmer. In scenes where Girard applies 21st Century makeup appliances to his famous deformed nose, I did get to laugh on several levels. First to cover his nose he needed a huge rubber thingie. Second, in that time period they did NOT have advanced latex/silicone theatrical makeup! We did not need to see him applying the makeup, it was too laughable.

I have never seen more destruction to this most-masterful of archetypal stories: The Return of the Man, is what Truby calls it.

Give it a miss---there are waaayyyy better versions out there.

The original story is a melodrama with some silliness, and this was an opportunity to use just the best part of this classic. Unfortunately, the very great liberties taken with the original have had the effect of adding more absurdities, silliness, and, worse of all, boredom.

All the script writer had to do is follow the original plot faithfully!

An example of a disastrous tampering with the original: The new version adds an irrelevant love affair for Dantes. The woman, not in the original, keeps groveling for Dantes to spend the night with her. He finally does as a favor for her, and she is ecstatic. Supposedly nothing would be more important for her than to spend the rest of her life with him.

1331882,5,B00003O02T,"Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870) was not only a colorful writer but also a 'man of color', the grandson of a French nobleman and a Haitian slave. Does his African heritage matter, or show up in his novels? Only in his vast sympathy for the poor and maltreated of the world, but I mention it because so few of his millions of readers are aware of the author's life story, of his rise from abject childhood poverty to literary fame and prosperity. His pauper's wild imagination -- his dreams -- are the substance of his novels, of his fantasies of the impossible prowess of D'Artagnan and the fabulous wealth of the Count of Monte Cristo. Dumas's heroes are super-human, and his novels are comic books  extended to ten thousands of words. But they're huge fun. They'll always be huge fun, in French or in translation. Beyond that, they're not so shallow as some people might think; the history lessons of the Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo are vivid to the point of luring the 'recreational' reader into realms of curiosity about the epochs they depict. And Dumas's book are richly, generously human. I wouldn't mind having my son or grandsons-to-be, or my daughter if I had one, draw their models of ethical/moral behavior from Dumas.

The Count of Monte Cristo was originally published in serial form in 1845-1846. I can imagine that reading it then was a lot like catching the Saturday matinee serial cinema adventures of my boyhood. This adaptation of the novel for television is also a serial of four lengthy episodes, each about 100 minutes, making a whole story of almost seven hours. I chose to watch it that way, one chapter at a time. Most of the plot of the novel is included. The characters in the film are at least roughly what I imagined them to be as I read the book ... or so it seems in my memory, perhaps fifty years later. The exception might be Edmund Dantes, the Count. He's larger and lustier, as acted by Gerard Depardieu, than I might have expected. But this is the kind of role for which Depardieu was born and bred; the only role he's ever acted even more convincingly was Cyrano de Bergerac. The rest of the cast is excellent. The sets and costumes are a visual banquet. The French 'do' costume epics better than anybody. There are no sword fights or fisticuffs, but the sense of action is strong throughout. There's not much eroticism -- even less than in the novel -- but the female characters are both lovely and vigorous, perhaps more 'acceptable' as portrayals of real women than those in the book. Basically, I can't see any reason not to sit back and enjoy!",1319760000,8,2600,4.613390928725702

One thing more: the miniseries doesn't set up the story correctly, as it begins with Dantes in the Chateau D'If, shows Dantes, Mercedes, Fernand & Danglars in too brief flashbacks and almost skips over the relationship between Dantes & Abbe Faria in prison, completely screwing up the first half of the story.

Depardieu makes some nice speaches but I never really felt him portraying the heart and agony of Edmond nor his madness. But, given all that it is better than most other attempts at the story.

1331909,4,B00003O02T,"""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is one of the most beloved and best-selling books of all time.  It has been filmed at least ten times (at least four of those times in English).  It has been abridged into I don't know how many versions of less than 400 pages, but the full 1,000 + page Dumas text is an absolute marvel, although I was limited to the English translation.

It is impossible to adequately convey the full spectrum of plot and subplot in a two hour movie, and most of the English versions are far too short.  I don't mind reading subtitles, so I finally decided to take a chance at this seven hour French production starring Gerard Depardieu as the title character.

As I expected, the fleshed out running time allowed for a more detailed depiction of some of the frequently omitted sub-plots: the last hour ""saving"" of Morrel and Sons with the miraculous appearance of the lost at sea Pharoan, the kidnapping of Albert de Moncerf and rescue from the Bandit Vampa, the luncheon where Monte Cristo tells the true horror story of the buried alive child of two of the luncheon guests.

This version also does a better job of depicting The Count as a master of disguise as Depardieu dons an even larger nose to portray Abbe Busoni and grey sideburns as Lord Wilmore.  He is also depicted as a master of poisons and potions, figuring in a pair of subplots which also involve Monte Cristo displaying a logical crime-solving technique that would make Sherlock Holmes proud.

Alas - much is bungled with no gain.

Dumas sets up the rest of the story expertly in the opening pages of the original book: Just promoted to Captain and about to marry Mercedes, the most beautiful girl in Marseilles, Edmond Dantes is instead unjustly imprisoned in France's Alcatraz - the Chateau d'If - after being falsely accused by envious conspirators.  Danglars envies Edmond's job, Fernant Mondego wants Mercedes. Slimy Caderousse helps them write an anonymous letter accusing Dantes of treason, trying to help Napoleon return from exile.  The letter goes to Villefort, the son of a notorious Bonapartist.  Villefort imprisons Dantes rather than risk family scandal. During his eighteen years of captivity Dantes meets a kindly priest, the Abbe Faria, who gives him a first-rate education and helps him figure out the circumstances of his arrest and imprisonment.

Without knowing the world of opportunity that is opening to Edmond Dantes, and the circumstances of his unjust imprisonment, the audience member has no clue of his motivation.  This film opens with Edmond in prison.  (Huh?!)  We find out about the dastardly deeds of the conspirators in bits and pieces, some in extremely tired flashbacks.

So - the first thirty minutes of this film are disjointed and would leave the novice Monte Cristo enthusiast with almost no understanding of the background and motivations for Edmond Dantes for the remainder of the story, and I would argue that this is mandatory information.

The middle five hours or so aren't bad, as I stated before, with better than typical versions of the Count's adventures in Italy and Paris, with a single inexplicable oversight: The character Benedetto, the illegitimate offspring of Villefort and Danglar's wife, is introduced and forgotten.  (More time is given to a fictitious woman who is beheaded for performing abortions.) In the 1975 English version Louis Jordan portrays Villefort and the public unmasking is one of the most satisfying scenes of the film.  It is inexplicable that the circumstances of Benedetto's birth is covered in detail, then we are introduced again to the adult criminal Benedetto, but the climactic courtroom scene is omitted.

The ending is complete Hollywood, which seems odd for a French production.  No, no, no, no, NO!  The Princess Haydee is introduced, and has an excellent scene denouncing Mondego, but we're told off-hand that she is pairing off with journalist Beauchamp.  (I curiously thought of the journalist with the same name in Clint Eastwood's masterpiece ""Unforgiven."" Were both brought in as a sort of Greek chorus, to comment on the on-screen story for those who may not otherwise ""get it""?) A non-Dumas character, a widower, is introduced to fall in love with the Count, only to give him up at the end so that he may reunite with his beloved.

Dumas isn't rolling over in his grave as strongly as at some of the other versions, but I daresay the definitive film version of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" has yet to be produced.",1237766400,9,4492,4.90224570673712
1331910,5,B00003O02T,"To begin, I have read Alexandre Dumas' ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" The novel is very long, nearly 1,000 pages. It contains an incredibly large number of subplots and characters, which may either add or detract from the reading depending on the preference of the reader.

This film adaptation, nearly 420 minutes, certainly makes an attempt to stay relatively loyal to the novel. There are places where it compresses action, scenes, or subplots so as to prevent a 15 hour very BBC-like miniseries. However, this French film was very interesting to me and loyal enough - it contains most of the Count's revenge scenes (which are often greatly changed by other film companies). [Note: The whole last 0.80 of the James Caviezel 2002 version is drastically changed.]

One of the main drawbacks to this film for me was the French dialogue. While I understand French moderately well, it was still difficult sometimes to follow what each character was saying. The English subtitles were not a large help because every time I wasn't certain what a character was saying, seeing an English translation was only moderately helpful. (It would have been easier for me to have French audio with both French and English subtitle options).

Otherwise, I really do not have any major complaint with the film. I would have liked to see M Noitier de Villefort have a greater role, but I realize that would be difficult since the book ""claims"" M Noitier communicated by blinking his eyes, which does not seem very practical to show on film. Therefore, while Dumas paints M Noitier as a relatively major character in the novel, I can see why he was given a much smaller role in this film.

I can also say that I greatly enjoyed G&eacute;rard Depardieu's acting as Edmond Dantes. (Note: Depardieu plays in ""102 Dalmatians"" and ""Le Placard"" as well as many other French films.) In my opinion, Depardieu was a more realistic Dantes than James Caviezel in the 2002 American Buena Vista version. The same I find true with the actors who played the Prosecutor Villefort, Fernand Mondago, and Danglars.

PS: The end of the film is also kind of a let-down for people very loyal to the novel. However, so many people love happy endings. The film provides a happy ending. The novel, well, not so much.

Also, I have heard that some people were not satisfied with the quality of the DVDs. I had no problem watching the DVDs on my Apple computer.

1331914,3,B00003O02T,"Almost everything that needs to be said about this version has already been said by other reviewers. I will only add three things which may explain my painful three stars instead of the five I would desperately like to give.

Firstly, as already mentioned, but needing emphasis in a big way - the physical quality of the two disks I got were atrocious. I had to rip and re-burn them to enable me to watch the whole series without interruption, and even then I had a hard error which I could not recover. Come on!!! This isn't the 1930's and we aren't talking about 45rpm scratchies. Not good enough!

Secondly, as a keen intermediate level student of French, I looked forward to being able to pick up a few gems while enjoying this magnificent story presented by a superb cast. It would have helped if the idiots who created the subtitles actually translated what was being said instead of just making some of it up themselves. (Example: ""Donc, tu est sr de ne pas pouvoir aimer une autre femme que Valentine de Villefort?"" translated to ""You're sure that Valentine is the one?"".) I know, I know. Subtitles are always a problem, but gee, give us a break.

The final problem is the ending. It's ridiculous and has nothing to do with the original story. The ending for Monte Cristo was not some idyllic return to the past with his long lost love, who incidentally also betrayed him, but an attempt by an emotionally and physically exhausted man to find some happiness with a woman, the princess Hayde, who was also betrayed and who also suffered terribly as a result. The faux ending must have been created as a feel-good finale with an eye to the American market or something like that. It does leave a bad taste in the mouth though.

With all this in mind, you should still buy this version. It has lots and lots to offer and you will, as I have, enjoy hours of splendid viewing.",1223251200,50,1879,4.517647058823529

It is shot through with intrigue, both political and romantic, gripping suspense, and slam-bang action. The first time I read it I lost a few nights' sleep because I couldn't stop reading to turn off the lights. The best way by far to appreciate a story of this breadth and texture is to read the book. If you must watch a screen version, however, this is the one.

This production, with a cast of impressive depth and range, surpasses the other film versions I've seen. The book is sprawling, and any screen adaptation necessarily makes substantial cuts, omitting and reconnecting various plot lines. Here, the character of Mondego (played by Jean Rochefort--one of France's great actors, but miscast in a part that calls for a younger and darker man to play against the smoldering rage of Edmond Dantes) is somewhat underdeveloped.

On balance, though, this production succeeds impressively. The dialogue, most of the time, is worthy of Dumas. The English subtitles are excellent as well (accurate and colloquial without being overly intrusive).

Compare this effort with the more recent American version to see what a magnificent piece of film this is.  Depardieu is magnificent; he delivers a stream of often complicated lines with great lucidity without glossing over their moral dimensions. As an aside, they must have rounded up every first rate show horse in France (with priceless tack in period and a parking lot filled with elegantly restored carriages--- it earns 5 stars as a horse show) for this visual delight; The acting is uniformly strong; the locations exceptional, the women beautiful.  I would say many more wonderful things, if  were getting paid by the word, but suffice to say that for anyone who loves the book yet fears what moviemakers might make of it, fear not. This is a visual and literary delight. For criticism: the quality of the DVD could be better and the subtitles can't be made to go away.

This version is about ten hours long, but never tedious.  I preferred this french version to the Hollywood version with Jim Cavel, which was too glamorous and over the top at times.  Gerard Depardieu is one of the greatest actors of all time and he is perfect in the role of Monte Christo in all his disguises.  It was interesting to find the role of the young Edmond Dantes played by Guillaume Depardieu, keeping the illusion alive.

1331921,2,B00003O02T,"One of the few memories I have of my father is that he raved about The Count of Monte Cristo as being among his favorite novels.

During my American 'education' - in front of the TV screen - I have of course come across the recent version with James Caviezel, and I thought it a nice movie but, as I have come to perceive most films, it was nothing really spectacular.

I have begun listening to audio books, which I can rent a great number of for free from the public library, and per chance I have come across an unabridged version of this novel.  It is a narration by Fred Williams spanning 40 CDs.

No literary or visionary escapade I have yet witnessed compares with the sublime splendor of the masterpiece which I have, quite by accident, discovered - that is why ... I couldn't STAND this movie, which I hurried to procure immediately afterward.  I progressively grimmaced through the first part and didn't even watch the latter ones, though I had rented them from the library.  I'd rather enojoy the Caviezel version which greatly changed the story [including the ending ... aia yai] than this one which parallels close to the literary masterpiece, yet only enough so in order to remind an aware viewer of its desperate inferiority.

An audio book is the ideal compromise between the fatigue of actually reading an enormous novel in today's demanding society and the superficiality of Hollywood interpretations.  If you would see a Count of Monte Cristo that dazzles you by his personality more than his wealth; if you would experience a script that inspires in its expression and a plot that is leagues beyond anything even Tom Clancy can conceive, then vizualize it in the fathoms of your mind, as you contemplate the unabridged audio version of this book.

Sadly, I am not certain that Amazon has it in stock, but you can find it in other sources.  The relevant information is that it is narrated by Fred Williams and published by Blackstone Audio, Inc and has an ISBN of 078613853X.  Be careful to not settle for an abridged version ... the full length book is at least 35+ CD lengths long.",1199404800,13,2102,4.638814016172507
1331922,4,B00003O02T,"I have read the classic novel twice and I've seen every film that has been created from this beautiful story by Alexandre Dumas.  This one is my personal favorite!  For being a T.V. mini-series adaptation, it sure is suprisingly excellent.  This French film is shot on location, with none other than the legendary Gerard Depardieu starring in the lead role as Edmond Dantes (a.k.a. The Count of Monte Cristo).  Even if you are not a fan of Depardieu, he is brilliant in this role.  Yes, perhaps the producers were stretching it a bit, casting him in the lead and not going with a younger actor with more refined looks.  However Gerard definitely can act, and like him or not, his portrayal is magnificent and dead on (the man has been nominated 15 times in his career for the Cesar, the French equivalence of the Academy Award for Best Actor, and he's won it twice).

This four part series (about 400 minutes total) is an absolute joy to behold.  It has everything you would want in a film - excellent acting, great directing, action, adventure, romance, absolutely breathtaking scenery, lavish and exquisite costumes and sets, exceptional writing, etc... etc...  This thourough adaptation may seem long, but I was longing for more once it ended.  It's just that good!

For those of you who are new to this classic:  The story takes place in early 19th century France, where we find our main protagonist, the young, dashing, heroic sailor Edmond Dantes falsely accused by a group of men whom he considers friends.  The cabal are jealous of his good fortune and right before Edmond is to marry the love of his life (Mercedes) he is suddenly taken by force away to prison to spend the rest of his existence in solitary confinement for a crime he had absolutely no part in.  After almost 20 years of imprisonment he finally escapes and that is all I wish to disclose in order to not ruin the fun for the rest of you.  I actually envy those who have no clue about what happens in this story, because they are in for a treat beyond belief!

Finally, I can't say enough about the incredible acting.  In particular, I was quite impressed and amazed by the actress who portrayed Mercedes - Ornella Muti.  On top of being one of the most beautiful creatures I can ever recall setting my eyes upon, this woman is one hec of an actress.  The scenes between her and Depardieu are just amazing.  And my advice to those of you that are very sensitive and emotional, I would highly recommend having some tissue paper around.  Believe me, this star-crossed love story (although it is obviously much more than that!) is definitely a tear-jerker and one that you will never be able to forget.

The French adaptation of the classic Alexandre Dumas novel 'The Count of Monte Cristo' released in '99 as a television mini-series is a daunting 6 six hour and 54 minute production that is at times a little challenging to stay with, but overall will prove to be a satisfying and enjoyable watch. Gerard Depardieu is superb as the brooding and calculating Edmund Dantes proving once and for all that he is truly one of the best actors in the world today. The locations and sets are magnificent, the acting excellent and the women beautiful (Julie Depardieu as Valentine, Florence Darel as Camille, Ines Sastre as Princess Haydee and Ornella Muti as the beloved Mercedes).

Word of advice, take your time to watch this feature over a period of several sittings. If you tire at any given point turn it off and come back again later, you'll enjoy the subtle nuances that permeate this extaordinary film much more if you're rested and focused.

1331926,4,B00003O02T,"I'm a big fan of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo, and read an unabridged version (the penguin classics edition) about 2 years ago.  As you can imagine, faithfully converting a 1200+ page novel to film, even a 6 1/2+ hour film, is extremely difficult.

Judging the film on its own merits, it probably would have earned 5 stars.  Despite it's length, it really doesn't have very many ""slow"" parts and I enjoyed it quite a bit, watching it over a period of two evenings.  There are a few cheesy parts (it seems somewhat low budget and/or cheesy at times compared to the hollywood films we're used to), but the overall piece is excellent.  The acting was good and the subtitles didn't bother me a bit, although I've never been bothered by subtitles.

I am a little bit surprised, however, at some of the reviews stating how true this film is to the novel - there really are a number of completely unneccessary differences versus the novel.

For example, it completely glosses over the entire first 1/4 or so of the book, without developing the relationship between Dantes and his accusors, and between Dantes and Faria.  They also unneccessarily changed the dialogue of several key scenes, such as with Dantes' controntation with Morcerf, which detracted somewhat from the story if only for those of us who have read the book (come on though, how could the director think he knows better than Dumas?).  The worst offense, however, was the ending - they completely changed it!  Now, I understand some of the differences versus the novel were necessary given the task of converting 1200+ pages to 6.5 hours, but many of the differences were quite simply unnecessary and detracted from the story - hence the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.

On the plus side, I think Depardieu's interpretation of Monte Cristo was quite good, if a little unbelievable (come on, in order to pull off masquerading as 3-4 different characters without anyone catching on would require somewhat nondescript features, i.e. near average height and build ... Depardieu sticks out like a sore thumb regardless of which disguise he's wearing).  But his Monte Cristo isn't the all-knowing, invincible Monte Cristo from the novel, and I think that does make the viewer better able to relate to the character.

Overall - a good interpretation of a great story.  It's not perfect, but it's probably the best film adaptation out there.",1171843200,19,2398,4.831295843520782

Unfortunately, I do not think most film makers portray this movie well enough in terms of its scope and overall feeling. The French miniseries I think is the best adaptation of the book. It incorporates a lot of the 19th century French aristocrat philosophy as well as the intriguing philosophy of the story's main character Edmund Dantes. It is quite long, but this is required because of what type of novel this is. If you enjoyed the book, I think you will love this DVD.

Granted it's part of watching a dvd to see it stall occassionally, but this one stalls five times on the first disc!  Now I used to work at a rental store I know how to care for dvd's and what to expect, and stalling that frequently the first time through definitely does not bode well for future playing.

I would strongly recommend you read the unabridged version so that you get the full array of emotions contained in this masterpiece. The one thing I didn't like about this Dant&egrave;s is that the literary one is sad and full of melancholy rather than angry and wrathful. In the book, even while executing his vengeful plans he regrets having to do this since he never did anything to deserve the hell he went through.

1. The ending is probably the most criticized part of this adaption. Dantes ended up with with Mercedes instead of Haydee, and the love between the count and Haydee was simply not mentioned. This disappointed thousands of hardcore fans of the book.

2. The creation of some unneccessary characters seems rather stupid.

The good:

1. Depardieu did a fantastic job portraying the count even with a seemingly exaggerated body frame. Nearly everything(excluding the right bodyshape)is there, the style, the attitude, the character all make you feel nobody can possibly do a better job. All other actors and actresses seem to know their job very well too.

2. The role of Bertuccio has far exceeded my expectation, bravo!

3. Great music and fabulous scene design.

Well let's face it, putting the original story into 4 episodes is a daring adventure and they managed to pull it off(Many other trials of putting the story into a movie have failed miserably).

Gerard Depardieu does an excellent job portraying Edmond Dantes. He conveys the emotion and intelligence of the character without over-acting.

Not sure why the Camille character was introduced. It doesn't hurt the story, but is unneeded. Caderrouse is an excellent minor character. Depardieu's children, in this movie, is a great touch. Depardieu the younger, portraying the younger Dantes, makes the flashback scences more real.

One, the length. Instead of condensing the book into a two-hour movie, and deleting much of the story that made the book compelling. A story as large as ""Monte Cristo"" can only accurately be reproduced as a mini-series.

Second, the language and setting. While keeping the dialogue in French can annoy American audiences, it keeps the tone of the story intact. The sets and costumes were also first-rate.

Third, family touch. Depardieu's children made good counterparts, and you can feel the emotion between them.

On the downside, the mini-series had no reason to tamper the story. Like Kevin Reynold's movie, there was no reason for Dantes and Mercedes to reconcile at the end. Also, most distracting to the story was the unnecessary addition of Camille, who ruined Monte Cristo's self-imposed exile on the world.",1156723200,11,1036,5.076470588235294

This is the first version of the story I have ever seen that does not try to abbreviate the tale, or make characters into composites of people from the book in an effort to save time.

If anything was changed, it was to streamline the story (the book I have is 1400+ pages) but there were a few creations that weren't necessary in my opinion.

There are a few things about the book that made it better, such as the ability to disguise the identity of certain characters, giving the audience/reader a sense of occlusion.  This isn't possible when you have an actor playing their parts, but it isn't fair to fault the filmakers for that.

Depardieu plays every nuance of the complex character's emotions and inner thoughts with the same brilliance as his performance of Cyrano de Bergerac several years before. The cast includes a variety of European actors who bring their own talent to the series.

  This is probably the best rendition of Dumas' famous story to reach the screen in a long time. Being originally a mini-series, Dumas' plots and themes are treated much better than adaptations made for a 2-hour film.  Even though this film's ending significantly deviates from the original story, its French origin allows it to capture the minute details of the period's mannerisms, fashions, and culture as depicted by Dumas like no other production has done so far.

It is wonderful to watch him  meticulously destroy his former tormentors one by one.  All the other performers in this series are also excellent, and there is an authentic period atmosphere.

1331967,5,B00003O02T,"This version of The Count Of Monte Cristo is my absolute favourite.  It is completely in the French language, stars Gerard Depardieu and Ornella Muti and is eight hours long.
A perfect movie to watch if you're planning to stay up all night long.  The DVD version is a 2-disc set, with two 2-hour long segments on each disc.
The basic plot is that of Alexandre Dumas' novel of the same name, however the movie starts out with Edmond Dantes in the Chateau d'If and having been there for 18 years.
As the story unfolds, we meet the character of Abbe Faria, who teaches Edmond facts about many things and reveals that he was imprisioned by Villefort's father.
Villefort had imprisioned Edmond for the possibility of reading a letter and carring out the motions to get Napoleon back on the French throne.
Wanting to protect his father, Villefort has no qualms about throwing Dantes into prison and letting him rot.  What he wasn't counting on was that Dantes would come back and give out swift justice.
However, there were two other people who wanted Dantes out of the way. One was Ferdnand Mondego and the other was Eugene Danglars.  Mondego wanted the girl that Edmond was going to marry and Danglars wanted something else, I'm not exactly sure what it was but I think it had something to do with being the Captain of a ship.
To get rid of Edmond Dantes, Mondego and Danglars wrote an anynomos letter denouncing Dantes and claiming him to be a traitor.
Therefore, Dantes gets thrown in prison, Mondego gets the girl, Danglars gets what he wanted, Villefort gets promoted to head gazeek of the French justice system of the early 1800's, and Dantes comes back for revenge and makes them all pay for what they did nearly 20 years before.  And then he gets to be with the girl he was going to marry.",1059436800,9,1792,4.570093457943925

1331969,3,B00003O02T,"At least that is the feeling I was left with when I finished watching this movie.  The movie focused just enough to scratch the surface but nothing more.  Obviously when a book is translated into a movie, there will be a fair amount of ""creative interpretation"" and editing by the producer and director due to time and budget which is understandable and I was willing to accept that.  But the book spends a fair amount time focusing on Edmond's relationship with Abbe Faria but the movie barely scratches the surface on that matter.  I don't think this is something that should have been addressed lightly.  This is a critical point when Edmond ""the kid"" becomes a ""man"" in the Chateau d'If.  From innocent youth to the bitter and vengeful ""count"", this is what the producers/directors did not allow us to share with the main character. Abbe Faria, a friend, a father figure, turns this naive young Edmunds into a ""man"" by imparting knowledge (not to mention the location of the treasure) which would play a critical part in Edmond's revenge. If you never read the book, then perhaps you may not be as critical as I have become but if you read the book even with the understanding that the tv version was edited for time, it left me feeling empty. And one last thing, did anyone else think it was funny when Edmond (played by Gerard Depardieu) remained heavy set after escaping from the worst prison in France almost two decades later?  Either prison life was good or the producer/director forgot to think about that, ha!",1040256000,2,1521,4.674157303370786

At first I was disappointed by the English sub-titles but now I must say the movie was better for it - I enjoyed the French dialogue (it immersed one more in the setting) and the sub-titles forced me to focus much more on what was happening. Gerard Depardieu was a very believable Edmond Dantes and the writers did wonders with the script.

We watched this in French class over a period of a few weeks and almost the entire class wanted to stay after each day and continue watching. I have never read the novel, so don't know what was changed, but I loved the numerous subplots. I think Depardieu is excellent as le Comte; he gives the character the perfect blend of ruthlessness and tenderness. The actor who plays Bertuccio adds an almost comic aspect to an otherwise serious movie. My only caveat is that the romance between le Comte and Camille seems somewhat contrived.

1331973,5,B00003O02T,"This movie was very well done.  The acting was incredible, and the set locations were spectacular.
There was what I feel to be a significant amount of modification to the original story.  Some of these things are justified for the sake of keeping the movie from being too long (such as leaving out a few minor characters).  However, it only would have taken a few extra minutes to expand on Faria's role in educating Dantes at the beginning of the film, as well as Danglars' punishment at the end (more on this shortly).
What I didn't like were the additions that were made to the script.  These were done to make the count a more ""friendly,"" likeable character, when in fact his darkness was part of the appeal of the book.  I didn't like how they changed his role in giving the poison to Heloise Villefort to make him less ""evil,"" playing less of a role in Albert de Morcerf's abduction by Luigi Vampa, his lack of a role in the building up of Villefort/Hermine Danglars' son and using him to destroy Villefort's career, taking away his intention to actually see Villefort's daughter poisoned, and cutting the amount of time Danglars' suffered in Vampa's custody to nothing (did I miss anything?).  Overall, I feel that off the 4 characters that were the subject of the Count's revenge, they only stayed true to Caderousse's and Fernand de Morcerf's.  The fate of Danglars' was going along great until that last scene which I mentioned.  I feel that they took out any part the Count played in Villefort's misfortune.  This, as I said, was probably to make the Count a friendlier character.
Another thing that perturbed me was the addition of Madame de Richardais' character.  As a caveat, I must say that I really liked her character and the actress who played her.  But unless I'm suffering from a memory lapse, I don't ever remember her in the book!  Part of the cold-heartedness and darkness portrayed in the book stemmed from the fact that he was so alone.  And what's with him getting back together with Mercedes at the end?  While that's a nice thought, it changes things quite a bit.
As you'll notice, in spite of all these complaints, I give the movie 5 stars.  The additions they made to the love interests of the story were ""nice,"" and you still got an idea of his vengeful nature, and the brilliant acting and screenplay will still hold your attention throughout the movie.",1013385600,4,2386,4.647619047619048
1331974,4,B00003O02T,"This French mini-series, co-produced by the Bravo network and starring Gerard Depardieu, is probably the most complete version of the Dumas tale to date. Of course, this is the classic yarn of Edmond Dantes, the sailor sent to prison unjustly, and who escapes to avenge himself on those who put him there.  With solid production values and a good cast, this classic tale of romance and revenge is given a performance that is both involving and moving, with a literate screenplay that does justice to the original source.
  Despite being a bit too beefy for the role, Depardieu (in his first television role) turns in a stalwart and stern performance in the title role. It's a mannered performance that contrasts to some of the more bombastic roles that he has done in American films like THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK.  It might not be the definitive performance of the role, but Depardieu does justice to it.
  Because of the length of the series, many of the plotlines of the original are left untouched. Of course, if you're not used to foreign films with their subtitles and the  long mini-series format (this series runs almost 400 minutes), you might find yourself getting impatient with this production.

Half the characters have been scraped, Depardieu is laughable at best as the revenge-driven Dantes (I mean, come on, we see a frail young guy go in the worst prison of the time, and 14 years later he reappears with Depardieu's face and after having gained 100 pounds? Give me a break here), and all this farce stinks of self-importance. For the definitive, ultimate film version of Dumas' book, see the TV adaptation of 1979, a gorgeous  French/Italian/German co-production, with Jacques Weber, who IS the Count, forever in my opinion. All the dramatic tension, sadness and suspense, not to mention EVERY character from the book, are present in that version, whilst all this is completely absent here.

1331976,3,B00003O02T,"Gerard Depardieu's protean presence dominates several recent DVD transfers of French films inslcluding Alexander Dumas' beloved novel of love and revenge which was adapted as a mammoth, four-part French TV miniseries. ""THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO"" (Fox Lorber,...), is the story of sea captain Edmond Dantes (Depardieu), who, in 1815, is falsely imprisoned in solitary confinement for nearly twenty years, then escapes, finds a huge treasure, takes on a new identity, gets a girlfriend and wreaks vengeance on those who betrayed him; in the process, exchanging one kind of prison for another.  Filmed on numerous European locations, this was the most-watched miniseries in the history of French TV.
Richly detailed with interwoven subplots, this movie is great looking and involving, especially for those not familiar with the novel.  For starters, Depardieu's plump, beardless departure from prison where he ostensibly had only bread, watery soup and no barber, is an eyebrow raiser. The screenplay adaptation by Didier Decoin is at variance with Dumas in many other instances.  Characters, relationships, events and motivations are, in some cases significantly, altered, as is the ending.  And these aren't improvements. They are arbitrary changes the screenwriter chose for unclear personal reasons.  After all, it was not for a shortage of running time, this version runs just over five hours.  Josee Dayan, a well known European director, approaches this material with moments of brilliance mixed with apparent indifference.  The end result is an intriguing, watchable epic that's a fractured reflection of Dumas' great tale, but not a true mirror image.

1331978,4,B00003O02T,"(...) First, I have to say I really liked this production. I confess I am at heart a romantic, and I enjoy Dumas thoroughly, particularly his flair for description. In his books, teeth are pearls, eyes flash, diamonds gleam, etc. In this production it seems no cost was too much. The sets, costumes, actors, extras, etc etc were gorgeous! I loved hearing the dialogue in French. The actors were great, from the greasy weasels to the ""doll"" mistress. Not knowing the faces of these actors let me fall into the story. I kept missing parts on Bravo and having to stay up late to catch up. I waited and waited for it to be rerun only to miss bits again. Arrgh!
So, how much should an actor suffer for his art? Compare Tom Hanks in Castaway (completely believeable) to Gerard (uh, yeah, MAYBE he missed a shower, shave and breakfast). Come on, M. Depardieu, couldn't you at least give Slimfast a try for a week?  Depardieu's acting went from gloriously passionate to the occasional stiff and awkward. His talent is obvious, though; how much he communicated with a glance, the twitch of an eyebrow!
As for the changes in the story, well, I was at first a bit disappointed. The novel was fine as it was, did they really need to change it? I agree with snipping out a bit or two, but ADDING more? I especially dislike the beginning, the relationship with Abbe Faria is barely touched upon. Surely they could have spent 5 minutes showing the friendship develop as time passed! They instead focused on how Edmond's relationships with others (servant, mistress) softened his heart and made him human again. However, I have always felt that in the book, Danglars (for example) wasn't punished enough. Apparently those writing the screenplay felt the same as they added scenes to lay it on thicker all around. (...)
For as much as this DVD cost, the quality is poor and there are few extras. The powers that be should be ashamed of sending this beautiful lady out into the world in such a shabby dress.",1007337600,3,1989,4.61864406779661

It is, in my opinion, the greatest book ever written.  I have seen a few of the movie adaptations, and I was greatly disappointed.  So, when I heard about this adaptation, I was really excited!  8 hours long.  Surely the writer/director will be able to cover the entire book without leaving anything out.  Wow.  Important scenes were changed, events were left out, events that never happened in the book were added, and the ending was changed.  I realize that the movie cannot include everything, but I was really disappointed.  There are many things that bothered me, but I'll only name a few.  Morrel does not die the day that Edmond saves him and his family.  And where is Julie and Emmanuel?  Bertuccio is not the Count's friend.  He is his servant.  Bertuccio does not convince Monte Cristo to save Albert's life.  Monte Cristo does it to have someone to introduce him into Paris society. WHO is this woman that Monte Cristo is sleeping with?  He buys the house in Auteill; it does not belong to some woman.  Where is Eugene Danglars?  Where is Villefort's son, Edward?  His death in the book plays a big part.  It makes Monte Cristo realize that he has taken his revenge too far.  Monte Cristo does NOT, NOT, NOT end up with Mercedes in the end.  He tries to start a new life with Haydee.  She does NOT marry Franz d'Epinay.  Anyways, most people who have read the book will probably think that it goes along with the book pretty much.  It does.

Many key scenes are not included - I understand that it is impossible to include the entire novel but... - while many scenes/characters have been invented for no apparent reason. For example, at one point, Mone Cristo gets invilved in romantic relationship interrupted by arrival of the Ali's daughter. It's a totally unjustified fantazy - it does not show a new twist in character of the hero. Actually, it damages the idea of Count's preoccupation or rather obsession with his mission which Duma had managed to emphasize. Excellent actors, poor movie! Sad.",996105600,3,948,4.751515151515152

It contains Haydee (which only one other version even mentions), Caderouse's treachery (again, not seen elsewhere), and an international cast on locations throughout Europe.  Thus, this version is able to get more of the European flavor that not one of other versions even comes close to.  This version also does the best job of conveying the redemptive themes that Dumas includes in his classic work.  Edmond Dantes has his heart turned into stone because of the betrayal of his 'friends'.  This heart slowly turns back into a heart of flesh in both the book and this version in particular.  The theology is not perfect, but considering standard European morals today, it is commendable.  A few warnings though !  This version ends in a way the book does not !  Perilous of the writer & director to do this--but it does work fairly well.  Also, much of the dialogue between the Count and Mercedes is also added--presumably to lend credence to the 'new' ending. Again, it also is done fairly well.  Also, this DVD gives more flesh and character to the Count's servants, but it again works to the story's advantage.

1331995,5,B00003O02T,"I have long ago dispelled the notion that any movie production faithfully reproduces a book as written. For those zealots who desire this, see George C. Scott's rendition of Dickens, A Christmas Carol. Alexander Dumas did not write the Count of Monte Cristo as a single novel, but rather as a long series of chapters in a French periodical of the time, hence its almost 1500 page length which would require a movie in excess of 800 hours.
I have always enjoyed Gerard Depardieu in whatever role he portrayed, either in English (Porthos, Columbus) or in his French films. It was said that Depardieu did not portray the stature of Edmund Dantes, but let's face it, Gerard is a big guy. Even Dumas does not describe Dantes as a sickly wretch, even though his food was described as ""maggot ridden slop"". To paraphrase this, no actor has ever portrayed a role as one invisions when reading a novel, least of all, any actor that ever portrayed Jean Val Jean in Les Miserables.
Le Comte De Monte Cristo captures the essence of the book which concerns a man bent on revenge, yet not so totally consumed that he looses his sense of humanity. I have recently re-read many of the classics that were part of my father's literary collection and must say that the movie ended on a happier note than the book.
The scenes and demeanor of the gentry were extremely faithful to the time frame of the novel, as were the portrayal of the suporting cast of character. Although the movie is presented in French with English subtitles, I feel that this should not dissuade one from seeing it. Since movies are to be entertaining, I feel that this one fits the bill.

1331996,5,B00003O02T,"I read the Dumas books growing up and still have the paper I wrote on ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" from my senior year in high school.  To me, Richard Chamberlain WAS the count in the 1975 TV movie.  And then,  in June 1999, I caught the very beginning of the remake on Bravo and was  totally hooked for four nights. It was just different enough from the book  that I had to see what they were going to do next.  Oh, I was pathetic! I  even stayed up late to watch the re-broadcasts and left work early to catch  them again the next afternoon.  Alas, I didn't tape them the first time  around and waited six LONG months for their rebroadcast.  Happily, I taped  all the episodes in November. Then my husband surprised me with the DVD in  June of THIS year.  We watched it four nights in a row, and  wouldn't you  know it--Bravo showed it again the week after that and I watched it  non-stop like a real addict. I can almost recite dialogue from the  subtitles at this point.
As you can plainly see, I am NOT the most  objective reviewer here.  To me, there is not another living actor anywhere  in the world who brings the dedication, style, and just plain fun to the  work as Gerard Depardieu. This is the first time I'd ever seen anything  he's acted in, so when I first saw him in this, I thought--no way.  He's  wrong physically for the role.  Maybe in the beginning during the prison  scenes that's true--but once he's out of prison and ready to take on  Europe--watch out!  He can be sexy, disgusting, evil, soft-hearted, or  whatever the part and the moment require.  The cast around him is marvelous  as well. Florence Darel is terrific as the country widow who isn't nearly  as naive as she seems, and Ornella Muti sizzles throughout.  Whether she's  dressed up in Paris or letting down her hair in Marseilles, she's  beautiful.  The movie has the look and feel of artwork come to life.  It  was as much a feast for the eyes as the French language is for the ears.  And by the way. . .I'm glad they went with subtitles rather than dubbing.  When you've watched the movie as much as I have, you can just listen to it  and revel in the beauty because you already know the plot.  Speaking of  which. . .
The changes from the book didn't bother me at all.  Most  screenwriters do take liberties in transposing works to movies (think of  Gone with the Wind)  I know that several other reviewers hated that the  ending was dramatically different from what Dumas wrote and probably not at  all what real-life characters would have done in that situation.  But as  for me, I was--and still am--totally swept away by the grandeur and beauty  of this production.  It's made me a fan of Gerard Depardieu and also more  willing to take a chance on watching foreign films with subtitles,  literally opening up a whole new world of entertainment.  This production  would make a great activity for a literature or French course in high  school or college, too.
Catch it on Bravo or rent it if you're  intimidated by the price of either the VHS or DVD versions.  Or better yet,  you can borrow my tapes where I recorded it last year.  But not the DVD.  It never leaves my house. No sirree:)",966470400,9,3182,4.396193771626297

It captured the essence of the book, with superb acting and sets, and really makes you FEEL the story. Honestly compared to the half-hearted attempts before, this was eye-opening to watch.
Perhaps the best review I can leave is this: this version has stuck with me and I deeply desire to own it and watch it again. Grab a copy if you can, you won't regret it!",1509321600,,588,4.653846153846154
7919098,5,B00003O02T,"The best of all the Monte Cristo films. It's long, lush, passionate, thorough. I was enthralled and captivated every moment, and I know the story so well! The acting is great. The casting is superb. The gorgeous settings are magnificent. The clothes, the horses, the carriages, the sea, the food, the theater, the dungeons -- magnifique.  The subtitles are wonderfully written and in sensitive time to the scenes.  After a few moments I forgot I was reading and was certain I understood French.  That's skill and artistry at work.  No matter how many Monte Cristo films you've seen, give yourself a real treat and don't miss this one.",1506384000,,634,4.842592592592593

7919102,5,B00003O02T,"The best adaption of the book I have seen. The costumes, the sets and the actors are very well cast and it's long enough to document the author's vision and the full scope of the story in the way the film adaptations can't. Watching it is such a treat.  I didn't mind that the dialogue is spoken in French,  as it was quite enjoyable to test and revisit the French I learnt at school and stretch myself a little. The subtitles are well placed so it is not asking too much of the viewer to put in a little effort when it is so well rewarded.  A superior production of stunning quality. 10/10.",1487116800,,591,4.212389380530974

7919104,5,B00003O02T,"My French class watched this in high school and everyone loved it.  For anyone not in the know, this movie is very French, meaning it is full of misery and anger, but the Romanticism of the age gives it a happy ending.  Though it does get away from the book, it is a great mini series.",1481155200,,285,4.071428571428571
