7210247,5,B00YAZNCNI,"An amazing family film! It is so rare to get a film that entertains in a way that the entire family can sit and enjoy--you learn about America, about history, culture, family and most importantly about the human heart. You get totally inspired by the main couple in the film. My family all loved this, even my 13! My mom loved it and I plan to share it with my inlaws who will get such a kick out of it. Thank you to the filmmaker for bringing this incredible story to us!",1437696000,6,472,4.141304347826087
7210248,5,B00YAZNCNI,"Wow!  I got to see a screening of this film a while back and have thought of it many times.  Game Show Dynamos is such an interesting, unique, and touching story. It's somewhat quirky but at the same time honest, and heartfelt.  This movie was a pure joy to watch. Any documentary fan will LOVE this movie. I cannot wait for the DVD!",1437696000,2,333,4.253968253968254
7210249,5,B00YAZNCNI,I was pretty familiar with the story when happened and with some of the family stress at the time. The film maker has done an outstanding job  of piecing together the details of their family history to bring to life their story of economic redemption. She tell the story with justifiable pride and humor. Even this old curmudgeon was moved. It is a fun story and a good picture.,1437609600,2,378,4.478260869565218
7210250,5,B00YAZNCNI,"Can't wait for this DVD! I was lucky enough to see an early rough cut of this marvelous film, and then to see it again at one of its first public screenings. This is a documentary that has it all--history, nostalgia, romance, comedy, suspense, tragedy, visual invention, intellectual stimulation, social provocation, and above all love for its subjects. The film is utterly unique, like no other documentary you've ever seen, and likely to give you one of the most enjoyable and memorable times you've ever spent in front of a movie. I can't praise Patricia Boiko's marvelous film enough.",1437609600,6,588,4.94949494949495
7210251,5,B00YAZNCNI,"What an interesting, funny and incredibly touching story!  Such a unique couple (and family) who accomplished so much.  A tremendous love story as well as blast into the past.  It brought back such great memories of the old game shows.  Can't recommend this movie highly enough!",1436486400,2,278,4.978260869565218
7210252,5,B00YAZNCNI,"My wife and I saw this film at a theater in San Diego hosted by the filmmaker. What a blast! As I see it, Game Show Dynamos is a cute and touching love story woven around the couple's truly unique experiences on classic game shows. Both sides of the story are entertaining. Put them together, and you get a very compelling story that is fabulously entertaining. Should appeal to men and women alike, as well as to all ages. Perfect for a ""family night"" get-together. Proof that a good true story is always better than fiction!",1434758400,4,526,4.489583333333333
7210253,5,B00YAZNCNI,"I caught this film at a Hawthorne NY theater event hosted by the filmmaker. I don't want to play 'spoiler' so here's my take:

Riddled with debt, the central characters, Claire and Bernard Boiko, had five kids and literally no way out of the mess they found themselves in. Living in their ""Munster House"" (as some referred to it), the Boiko's were definitely a pair of outsiders but he was a history teacher and she a children's author, they banked on their intelligence and so chose a most unlikely path out. Game shows... and more game shows.

Filmed and narrated by one of their daughters, Patricia, who just so happens to be a filmmaker (and a family doctor, no less), Game Show Dynamos is a personal story that travels back to a time of more innocence but also brings you into more modern game shows and much of the psychology that they live on. (Remember when the FBI launched their investigation into game show practices?) Oddly, game show techniques today are not that different than they were 50+ years ago. Boiko brings you inside her most unique family and then weaves a ""you'll laugh/you'll cry"" story that is incredibly inspiring. Packed with some very hard to find footage from the early days of television, the film is simply a delight to watch.

I found this quote online which sums up much of what you can expect:

""Even if you're not a game show junkie like I am, this documentary has lovely gifts for you."" - Ken Jennings, Jeopardy! Champion who won 74 games and $2.52 million, Bestselling author, TV host and speaker.

I would add to this that if you think you live in a...ahem... interesting family, you'll love this film.",1433462400,7,1643,4.632302405498282

7210255,5,B00YAZNCNI,CUTE SHOW!!!,1464912000,,12,5.5
7210256,5,B00YAZNCNI,"Game Show Dynamos is charming and delightful. I was taken in completely by the story, the subject, and most of all the deep and apparent love between the two main characters, Claire and Bernard...and when I say characters, I mean characters. It's a truly American story with interesting insights into post-War American working and family life  its joys and travails, all against the backdrop of the rise and fall and rise again of the TV game show.",1464048000,,448,4.818181818181818
7210257,1,B00YAZNCNI,The Blu-ray version seems to be defective. There is no sound.  I've replaced it and tried them both on several players.  Still no sound.,1459641600,,136,4.625
7210258,5,B00YAZNCNI,Great Doc.,1457308800,,10,4.5
7210259,5,B00YAZNCNI,"This is an amazing documentary! Ultimately, I found that the story of how a couple became famous for their performance on TV game shows was really the quintessential American story of how 2 special individuals found each other--one the child of immigrants; the other from a classic American California home--coming from opposites coasts of the country. They had dreams of a life suffused simultaneously with public service and ""show biz"", and they also were committed to raising a wholesome family ""from the boots up"" amidst typical American lower middle-class circumstances but also unique challenges. The values they consciously and also unwittingly conveyed to their children and grand-children clearly came through. This was a true ""love story"" played out across an amazing life of a couple together! I was literally riveted to the video for the entire piece! Thank you for making such a beautiful production!",1456963200,2,913,5.303448275862069
7210260,4,B00YAZNCNI,Just delightful! A quirky couple who used their wits to supplement their income and take care of their family's expenses. Very well done - not your fun of the mill story.,1456358400,,170,4.516129032258065
7210261,2,B00YAZNCNI,"It's an interesting story, but most of it is about the couple's lives...how they met, etc.  I was hoping for much much more game show footage.  I ended up fast forwarding to the few actual clips of them on various game shows.",1454889600,,225,4.333333333333333
7210262,5,B00YAZNCNI,This was an excellent documentary.  I loved the honesty and openness of the Boiko family.  I enjoyed the journey of a family struggling to make it in the U.S. and how they found a unconventional way to overcome.  It was a beautiful story from start to finish.,1453507200,2,259,4.468085106382978
7210263,5,B00YAZNCNI,Very sweet and interesting documentary.,1453507200,2,39,7.0
7210264,5,B00YAZNCNI,"What a sweet story of a man and a woman who struggled financially through life to support their children but their family had nothing but love for each other.  This was all while the man pursued his professional dream of being a teacher and both he and his wife pursued game shows.  The game show spin is not even the nicest part of this story, although it did make it even more interesting.  This is one of those documentaries that should make you feel good and should restore some of your faith in humanity.  This is the story of true love that is so rare today and how a committed couple can get past life's difficulties. My favorite scene was when Bernard (the dad) was explaining how he felt to get a huge check. It was not my money and I did not benefit from it at all but I felt so good for him and his family. Unfortunately, Bernard is gone now but I am absolutely certain that his family remembers him fondly every single hour of every single day.  I would LOVE to be remembered like that when I am gone.  Touching... beautiful story.",1453248000,2,1043,4.295918367346939

7210267,5,B00YAZNCNI,"If you grew up in NYC in the '50s, '60s and '70s and especially if you grew up in Queens, you're bound to get a kick out of this heartwarming, offbeat, humorous, intelligently presented bio of a most remarkable couple.",1451001600,,218,4.475
7210268,5,B00YAZNCNI,It was interesting,1449100800,,18,5.333333333333333
7210269,5,B00YAZNCNI,"I loved this movie. This family portrait is funny, touching and not sappy.  Bernard and Claire stay upbeat even when their lives get tough. Any boomer will appreciate shots of Art Fleming on the original Jeopardy, Vanna, To Tell the Truth and more.",1449014400,,248,4.767441860465116
7210270,5,B00YAZNCNI,A fascinating American story!  The Boikos' journey supplementing their income by appearing on game shows is very engaging.  The film is directed by their daughter and tells the story with love and humor.,1448323200,,203,5.121212121212121

7210276,1,B00YAZNCNI,What could have been an interesting movie about game shows was turned into a boring collection of a family's home movies.,1446249600,2,121,4.809523809523809
7210277,5,B00YAZNCNI,"I was hesitant to watch this because I thought it might not keep my interest piqued for very long. I'm very glad that I read some of the positive reviews and gave the movie a chance.

The entire story of the Boiko's journey through the bumpy ride that is life was totally compelling. From their first meeting, to their marriage, their struggle to keep afloat as each baby came along and their clever idea to get on as many game shows as possible to make ends meet. They were masterful at strategizing how to be picked as contestants... and how to win. The movie doesn't just tell the story of their lives (from young adults to senior citizens) and their winnings from game shows... its also is a fascinating look at the ever changing panorama of America. From decade to decade, it was a pleasure to watch.

What endeared me the most was the undying love between the Boico's. It's rare to see a couple stay together for 50, or so, years. Especially enduring all the hardships that they encountered. They seemed to be just as in love as seniors as they were when they first met. I won't give away the ending but I will say that it was very moving  and brought me to tears.",1446249600,4,1170,4.382488479262673
7210278,3,B00YAZNCNI,"Folksy folks gaming it up for their lives, and the winnings are proof love can grow strong in combat (with the big wheel) in game shows...great feel-good story for families from 1 to 99,  and TRUE story !",1445644800,,204,4.368421052631579
7210279,2,B00YAZNCNI,"It was more of a biographical story about the Boiko's lives than a story about their game show appearances.  Nothing against the Boiko's, but I watched this hoping for more clips from their actual game show appearances.",1444348800,2,219,4.918918918918919
7210280,5,B00YAZNCNI,This is a great look back at a couple who added to their income by appearing on almost three dozen game shows from the 1950's to the 1990's.  The story is lovingly told by their daughter with clips from their appearances on some of the shows and will be enjoyed by game show fans and everyone else,1444176000,2,297,4.2105263157894735
7210281,5,B00YAZNCNI,"In addition to this film being a wonderful love story, it's also an intimate look at  twentieth century from the perspective of an American Family. It merges individual dreams with the history of a nation - the Depression, Immigration, the Korean War, the rise of advertising and consumerism.  And there is so much more in this delightful, funny and very moving portrait of a unique and wonderful family.  The story of Claire and Bernard Boiko is lovingly told by their daughter, Patricia, who pays tribute to their brilliance, imagination and courage - and their wacky, wonderful life together. Not to mention their over the top intelligence.
I recommend this documentary to anyone who dreams.",1444089600,4,694,5.0701754385964914
7210282,5,B00YAZNCNI,"What a beautiful documentary. So American, so funny, so real. We loved this hilariously original family story.",1440892800,,110,5.529411764705882
7210283,5,B00YAZNCNI,"This is a strong, intelligent, fun, heartwarming and honest story that I was fortunate to see on screen. I would highly recommend Game Show Dynamos to anyone. GSD not only is a documentary about a family but is also a unique behind the scenes look into the making of Game Shows and the people who appear on these shows. Filmmaker Patricia Boiko presents this story in a layered, compelling way and it is easily enjoyed by all types of audiences everywhere.",1440374400,2,456,4.6419753086419755
7210284,5,B00YAZNCNI,"At its heart, this stunning film is about unconditional love and family. It's a truly amazing story as well, I was captivated the whole time, but crying at the end, I have to admit. Loved it. Can't wait to see more from this director.",1439164800,2,234,4.340909090909091
7210285,5,B00YAZNCNI,"Funny and poignant, this film is a terrific true story of love and family.  It will surprise and delight you!",1439164800,2,109,4.45
7210286,5,B00YAZNCNI,"This film is a loving and humorous tribute to an admirable, resourceful and charming couple, Bernard and Claire Boiko.  The filmaker, the couple's daughter, tells their personal story using family videos and video clips of the couple's real life appearances on various TV game shows. In a nod to Bernard's career as a History teacher, it illustrates how events in our country's history in the last half of the 20th Century personally impacted this family. This is a movie that will inspire audiences from teens to seniors.  The film is fast paced, funny and moving.  You'll want to enjoy it over and over again.",1438819200,4,611,4.855769230769231
7210287,5,B00YAZNCNI,"There is simply no other film that delights from beginning to end like this masterpiece of enlightened documentary filmmaking.  You will enjoy this film so much  that you will want to tell all your friends and loved ones about it, and feel good each time you share the memories.  A story of love, sex, and game shows, it probes deeply into the joys and sorrows of the 20th Century American psyche, yet leads the viewer lightly along with laughter, excitement and drama that just keeps on coming.  A rare gem!",1438819200,4,508,4.611111111111111
7210288,5,B00YAZNCNI,What a great film!  Interesting to learn about the history of game shows through such a sweet story.  Engaging and well done.,1438819200,2,125,4.636363636363637
7210289,5,B00YAZNCNI,"The movie was well made, touching, funny, enlightening, heart warming and enthusiastic. I applaud the directors and creators.",1438732800,2,125,6.0
7210290,5,B00YAZNCNI,"I was initially drawn to the film because Bernard Boiko was a beloved teacher of mine at Francis Lewis HS in Queens in the early 1970s.  I remembered him as a wonderful teacher and a bit of a ""character.""  I had no idea about his game show career.

The film is a total delight.  It captures the experiences of an improbable young couple whose love affair survived the Korean War, religious and cultural differences as they struggled to make ends meet on a teacher's salary in the 1950s while raising a growing family in a NYC housing project.

What the family lacked in material comforts, was more than balanced by the love of learning instilled in the five Boiko children by their parents.  My husband, who did not know anything about the family, enjoyed the film as much as I did.  A real gem.",1438214400,10,795,4.479166666666667
7210291,5,B00YAZNCNI,"I was fortunate to watch the evolution of this delightful film from the filmmaker's desire to create a unique piece of art that was also a tribute to her brilliant, resourceful, and eccentric parents.  Her loving touch is evident throughout the film and her desire to share their triumph of the spirit makes for a poignant trip down her family's memory lane that can be appreciated by all.",1438128000,2,389,4.720588235294118
7210292,5,B00YAZNCNI,"Anyone who watched a game show, at some point in their life, had a yearning to win ridiculous money by answering ridiculous questions. This film shows a family with a crazy trivia library, somewhere in their brain, and how they used it to make ends meet. I loved this film. I got a chance to see it at one of the early filmmaker screenings. It is a very warm and genuine story about the family, their struggles, their love, as well as their crazy appetite and economic need for Game Shows.

If you're in the mood for a quirky, interesting, and inspiring film, this is definitely a good call.",1438041600,8,591,4.422018348623853
7210293,5,B00YAZNCNI,"I saw the film when it was presented in Washington DC.  You'll find yourself cheering for the Dynamos as they take on game show after game show. In truth, there's something for everyone in their story. It's a wonderful film for families to watch together.",1437782400,2,255,4.666666666666667
8718012,4,B00YAZNCNI,"The names of husband and wife Bernard and Claire Boiko probably aren't familiar to you. But if you are a TV game-show junkie you would certainly recognize their faces. They appeared as contestants on shows like Match Game, Jeopardy, To Tell The Trust 28 times in 37 years! While Bernard (never called Bernie) was a school teacher, and Claire was a prolific playwright for childrens plays. They earned about $48,000 as contestants on these shows.

Their daughter Patricia (one of five children) directed and narrates this documentary on her parents. It a lot of home movie interviews combined with archival TV footage of the Boikos TV appearances.

I think it was also therapy for the director because  as we learn  life at home was not easy. Many of the prizes were not in cash and taxes had to be paid on them (in cash). The family declared bankruptcy at least ones and all the credit cards were maxed out. (Oddly, we never find out how they did get all those bills paid off, but Patricia doesnt feel thats part of the story.).

The 61-minute film is not a fancy production and obviously was done on a low budget. But it was interesting to watch once.

The DVD comes with about seven outtakes as bonuses  each is about a minute long.

If you like real-life docs or watch a lot of game shows, you should find it worth watching. I did.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
