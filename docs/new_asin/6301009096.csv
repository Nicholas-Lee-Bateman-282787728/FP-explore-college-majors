I saw him live at Albert Hall in 1970 in London and he was absolutely amazing--a one man show with so much energy and talent that I remember it to this day.  His skill was unparalleled and to see him live is my fondest rock and roll moment.  And I saw the whole gang at the Denver Pop Festival who went on to Woodstock.  Jimi Hendrix was the final act and, in my opinion and many others, Johnny Winter was by far the better of the two--at least that day.",1332115200,,550,4.064814814814815

306154,5,6301009096,"This DVD is undeniable evidence that in a world of great guitarists, Johnny Winter in his prime, was a true colossus on the six-string.

  Following the success of his ""Live Bootleg"" CD series, Winter's fans have been eagerly anticipating the release of some of the fabled early European & US TV performances. Not one to disappoint, Johnny ventured deep into the archives to produce ""Live Through The 70's"", an extraordinary collection of clips showing the soul man in his fiery formative years from 1970-74, and 1979.

  It kicks off with an appearance on Danish TV's Gladsaxe Teen Club from 1970, that brings the original Winter band of drummer Uncle John Turner, bassist Tommy Shannon, and as guest on keys & sax, brother Edgar Winter, into your living room with vivid color & sound quality. If one has any questions about the essentialness of this disc, they're answered as soon as the band explodes into their powerful early version of Edgar's ""Frankenstein"". This pre-synthesiser nugget is driven by Johnny's guitar and that signature Uncle John backbeat. And though I'm not usually much on drum solos, to see Turner work his kit here, is a primal & rhythmic thing of beauty. Not withstanding a rather spiritless audience, the quartet packs plenty of raw blues punch into ""Be Careful With A Fool"" & ""Drop The Bomb"".

  Also from 1970, are three songs from London's Royal Albert Hall. Here we see the start of Johnny's progression into the rock & roll realm. His version of Chuck Berry's 1955 classic ""Johnny B. Goode"" will always rank right up there with the original, as Winter's scorching guitar puts his take head & shoulders above all the rest.

  The smokin' ""Mean Town Blues"" on Germany's famed Beat Club round out the 1970 performances.

  ""Rock & Roll Hoochie Koo"" and ""Stone County"" from a 1973 Waterbury, CT show recorded for Don Kirshner's Rock Concert have Johnny performing at his arena-filling, rock-star apex. With his long white beard, and decked out in silver stack-heeled boots & black leather top hat, Johnny is like a wizard, gliding around the stage, mixing up a white-hot musical potion, and holding the audience under his spell.

  The All-Star performance of Muddy Waters' ""Walk In The Park"" from 1974's Chicago Blues Summit on Soundstage brings together Johnny, Junior Wells, Dr. John, Michael Bloomfield, and the mighty Band of Gypsys' drummer Buddy Miles, for what can only be described as a ""blues jam for the ages"".

  For the 1974 German Musikladen's ""Boney Maroney"", Winter added a second guitar player, giving him a chance to stretch out even more with his lead work. The camera edits here are pretty dynamic for the time, with lots of quick cuts and interplay. Sort of similar to the classic Beat Club look, but without the ""green screen"" effects. It fits the energy of the tune very well.

  To wrap up the collection, we see Johnny come full-circle back to the blues, with three songs on the German Rockpalast program. Outside of the drummer being perched behind an enormous, transparent orange drum kit that would be more appropriate for Led Zeppelin than a three-piece blues act from Texas, this is a marvelous performance in many ways. Bassist Jon Paris takes on harp duties as well, and handles the task to a tee. The trio takes the audience on a southern road trip with Jimmy Rogers' ""Walking By Myself"", and the 1957 Dale Hawkins/James Burton hit, ""Suzie Q"". It's Winter's soul-deep treatment of Delta blues pioneer, Willie Brown's ""Mississippi Blues"", that best showcase Johnny's passion for the genre.

  Interspersed throughout the segments are interview clips from Detroit's Tubeworks in 1970, which were filmed in the early morning hours following the Ann Arbor Blues Festival. The clips are very off-the-cuff, and cover the ground between the current state of rock & roll music, to Johnny's desire to levitate. Johnny even offers up an impromptu take of Big Bill Broonzy's ""Key To The Highway"", as he teaches bassist Randy Jo Hobbs the tune. More evidence of JW's pure passion for the blues.

  ""Live Through The 70's"" is an indispensable document of the rise & rule of one of the greats, and should be an integral part of any blues, roots, and Texas music fan's library.

306155,3,6301009096,"My expectations of this DVD were high, too high perhaps. After viewing I think this DVD is a bit of a mixed bag.
Most of the video's are already known to the fans; and some of the ""best"" material was left out.

The real ""gems"" for me were the Danish recordings of 1970. The video and audio quality is amazingly good, as are the performances. Only the (very young and quiet!) public seems to be quite bored...
The Royal Albert Hall show is amazing. Although video and audio is quite bad, the ""drive"" in this show is unsurpassed.
Also the Beat Club performance of ""Mean Town Blues"" is very good. But why did they leave out ""Johnny B. Goode"" of that same show? That's imho. one of the best JBG performances.
The Don Kirschner's show (with bearded Johnny!) is OK, although the sound is a bit worse here.
""Walkin' thru the park"" is next; unfortunately without Muddy. I hadn't seen that one before.
During ""Bony Moronie' an interviewer suddenly fills the screen; very annoying since this line-up (RH, RJH, FR and JW) is imho. the best Johnny ever had.
The DVD ends with a few tracks from the 1979 Rockpalast show. Since this show was on TV (at least in Europe), most fans already have this performance.

As said, it is bit of a mixed bag, a bag full of concert footage, TV shows and interviews.
If they had only left out the clueless interviews on this DVD, and fill it up to 2:30 hrs with e.g. footage from the Captured Live tour it would have been perfect.",1267228800,,1452,4.414179104477612
306156,2,6301009096,"Despite some negative reviews, I puchased this video. I did not find it very interesting. It is little more than poor quality audio & video of TV and small european club performances from the 70s. If the quality was better it might be interesting. If you find it anywhere in a $5 bin it might br worth a look.",1266364800,3,309,4.254237288135593
306157,5,6301009096,"I read the many reviews before buying this DVD, and I have to say to those that were negative, to stop being so picky! The version of Frankenstien was worth the price of the whole video!! Yes a few of the songs the video was old and a bit grainy, but they didn't have HD cameras back then. And a german VJ interupts a song for a few seconds (boo hoo). I found the sound to be great on most all of the songs. I saw JW a couple of years ago and he now sits on a chair and plays, but is still impressive as a blues/rock guitarist. I only own 1 album by him, it was recorded live in the 70's, so maybe thats why I found this collection so excellent. I find it hard to believe that anyone would not enjoy this DVD, even a hardcore collector who has tons of his music should find this worth the money!",1263340800,9,795,3.9135802469135803

I am not kidding when I say that one dude going nuts in the audience could have been me. What a trip back in time. Punch that ""add to cart"" button now!",1242518400,,399,3.9382716049382718
306161,5,6301009096,"At last some great video of Johnny has come out, I don't know where they found all this stuff, but it is a quantum leap in quality from what has previously been available.  Here's a brief synopsis:

The opening three tracks from Danish TV (1970) surprise especially by the bright, sharp video.  You can even see the zits on Edgar's face.  Good stuff, especially 'Be Careful With A Fool', although the best is still to come.

Next we break into part of an informal interview from 1970, someone says its 4 in the morning, joints are going round and both interviewer and interviewee, plus band and hangers-on, seem pretty wasted.  After a few minutes, we go back to the music, but we'll be returning to this free-form interview a few more times on the DVD.

The roughest quality film comes next with the 3 Royal Albert Hall songs, starting with Johnny B Goode.  Both film and sound are of a lower quality than the rest of the DVD, but seeing as there's space on the DVD for it, I'd rather it be included than not.  However, the music itself is great.

We rejoin the previous interview scene next.  In a long stoned rap that Johnny just manages to hold together, he says he believes he is able to levitate if he puts his mind to it, by tuning into the gravitational force on another planet.  A great jam follows with just Randy Hobbs on bass, and Johnny pulls off an amazing impromptu version of 'Key To The Highway', without drums or rhythm of any sort other than Randy's basslines.  Johnny seems so out of it, but it certainly doesn't affect his playing, which is crisp and tight.

Next we have a single clip of 'Mean Town Blues' from Germany in 1970, one of the highlights for me with some fantastic slide playing.  Incredible track.

We return again to the previous interview scene, where there's a criticism of contemporary rock (1970), Johnny complaining that it's become too unstructured.  Johnny says he and his band never rehearse, and try new things every night.

We jump now to 1973, but it looks like Johnny's aged 40 years.  However, we soon realise that it's just his longish albino beard that makes him look like Willie Nelson from a distance, plus his black leather top hat.  Glam has affected their stage clothes, but thankfully not the music, which is as great and sharp as ever.  Johnny shows amazing dexterity in moving around in his massive platform shoes.

An interesting version of Muddy Waters' 'Walking Through The Park' from the Blues Summit in Chicago in 1974 follows, which features Michael Bloomfield, Buddy Miles and Dr John, amongst others.  Sadly, little if any of Bloomfield's playing is audible.

We return again to the previous scene, where Johnny surprises all by telling the assembled group, stoned out of their minds, that people shouldn't let their lives revolve around dope.  They've got to have something to live for.  In true 'Do what I say, not what I do' fashion, Johnny insists on moderation(!), assumingly in their drug-taking.

We return next to Germany in 1974 for a great 'Boney Maroney'.  The audio is a little muddy in comparison to other tracks, but still good enough to enjoy some great playing.  Weirdly, for 30 seconds we break to a German pop presenter who explains in German that callers can only choose to see videos which are on a previously given playlist, as they were getting callers asking for the Beatles and the Stones, and others not on the list.

Finally, we jump to Essen's Rockpalast in 1979.  An older maturer Winter is playing in a leather cap, and although by this point his liver must have already processed vast amounts of toxins, this doesn't seem to have affected his playing.  'Walkin' By Myself', 'Mississippi Blues' and 'Susie Q' round off one of the greatest classic rock DVDs I've seen in years.

(I saw Johnny last year in Berlin, and feared the worst when he had to be helped by two people onto his stool in the centre of the stage (he doesn't play standing anymore, and his back is a bit arched).  He was pretty immobile throughout, but the moment he starts playing you realise that you've underestimated the man - he can still play, even if only at three-quarters strength.  A true living legend, he still wowed the crowd despite his lack of audience interaction.)",1241740800,10,4245,4.652348993288591

When Johnny played on the stage with Rick, there was a nuclear meltdown of loudness:  raw rock-n-roll, sizzling blues.....all total humbucker-toned orgasmic LOUDNESS!  I got to see ""Johnny Winter And"", [the ""AND"" being the former McCoys of Hang On Sloopy fame] at Crawfordsville, Indiana at Wabash College in the very early 70's.  They opened for Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.  I went home soaking wet from sweat....the amount of energy I burned up, along with the rest of the crowd boogying to one of the best groups to ever hit the stage, totally exhausted, mesmerized, and wasted all of my musical being that night.

Then it gets into some classic rock songs performed by Johnny, such as ""Johnny Be Good"" and ""Rock & Roll Hoochie Koo"", the rest is mainly blues.

He plays with a lot of different people, but no matter what he just shines like you would expect. Overall this is a must have for Winter fans, way better than (Pieces & Bits) or (Live At Time Square) for sure. I know some people will complain about it, so if you want perfection you might not like it. So far this is the best there is on DVD, so why not just watch and enjoy it.

306214,5,6301009096,"Well some of us remember Johnny Winter when he came out as a ""bonus baby"" (one of the highest paid artists at the time- not really appropriate for a ""bluesman"") on his initial Columbia Records debut. That record was fantastic, but it was at the end of the ""blues boom"" of the 1960s. Winter went on to record some great things but got stuck between blues, rock and so on. We guitarists all loved him with his fingerpick style and soulful speed- a cross between Freddie King and B.B., with a great growling voice- not like Bob Hite and other ""white"" blues singers at the time.

This DVD is really the best released so far. I have waited two months to write a proper review of it. Winter has had several Japanese releases (bootleg) with some of these tunes on it, but they are not as good. The sound on this DVD makes it very special. If you only have one Johnny Winter DVD this should be it. A few years ago they released ""Pieces and Bits"" which, like this was a compilation of VHS released stuff, but it was a bit all over the place. This DVD is right on! I am a Blues lover and I will address this review to that part of the content.

The opening tunes are special- the sound this track not the best but Winter's interpretation of his brother Edgar's ""Frankenstein"" is a highlight (still the Winter Bros top chart hit!- even if Johnny didn't play on the record-(Ronnie Montrose- with ex-band member, guitarist, Rick Derringer as producer)-but this version is superb Johnny's graceful lead and his multi-instrumentalist brother's great drum solo- just fantastic!. Of course the presence of Tommy Shannon, later of ""Double Trouble"" with SRV on this tune and in several other parts of the DVD is also very special.

Johnny's version of BB King's ""Be Careful Of The Fool"" is one of the highlights of the disc. It showcases Winter's abilities and style. This tune is much like his version of another King tune, ""It's My Own Fault"", from the Fillmore East sessions! You will play that one over and over.

At Royal Albert Hall the highlights are ""Johnny B. Goode"", very clever and well done. And ""Talk To Your Daughter""the great tune from JB Lenoir, is performed with a different groove. ""Tell The Truth"" showcases the immense talent of Johnny's brother Edgar- what a keyboard and Sax solo!! A fantastic effort, even if it is a runny VHS transfer!

The final selections I want to comment on are; ""Key To The Highway""-Big Bill Broonzy's and later Little Walter's tune-which by the way is not listed on the back of the case!! This is Johnny at his best--just him and an inadequate bass player- but his is still brilliant-you can watch that one over and over if you are a player. Also ""Walking Through The Park""- from the famous Muddy Water's tribute show (why has this not been released yet!!!) with Johnny playing with Muddy, Junior Wells and Mike Bloomfield on this tune! Another superb blues selection is ""Walking By Myself""- Jimmy Rogers' (James Lane) classic tune. In many ways it's the highlight of the whole disc! A great rendition! Finally is Dale Hawkins' ""Suzi Q"" with James Burton's classic riff.- just great!

This is a ""must have"" for all blues fans and guitarists. It is a pity that so little footage exists of this great blues innovator. It's a shame that the ""Blues Boom"" of the 1960s ended and left this talent hanging- but at least we have something! Remember little exists of Magic Sam, Guitar Slim, Young Buddy Guy and T-Bone Walker and even Albert King. This show is a must for most collectors and Blues enthusiasts.",1230854400,43,3528,4.600953895071542

306216,4,6301009096,"This DVD is a treat.  It's generally great compared to the few other Johnny Winter DVDs I've seen.  Considering Johnny's been performing for 40 years it's unfortunate there aren't more of his shows captured.

Not all tracks on this DVD are of equal quality - the Albert Hall concert is an electric performance but the footage is rough.  The source video on some of the later German concerts seems to have slightly deteriorated in spots but it doesn't detract much from the quality of Winter's excellent performances.

The earlier Danish footage is extraordinarily sharp for its age - with great sound - surprisingly enjoyable to watch. The interviews are spontaneous, whimsical, humorous, even a bit ominous - and provide a rare glimpse into the personality of the man behind the searing blues riffs.  Winter's performances of 'Be Careful With a Fool' and 'Fast Life Rider' are mesmerizing (These songs are listed on the DVD as 'Be Careful Of The Fool' and 'Drop the Bomb'), as is the German production of 'Mean Town Blues'.

306217,2,6301009096,"I'm writing this review to give potential buyers a pause in the face of the 5 star reviews that got me clicking the order now button. I am a big fan of Johnny Winter. I've owned many albums and seen him play in a couple clubs years ago in Houston. This dvd has its moments: highlights include Be Careful with a Fool, Mean Town Blues, Stone County, Walking By Myself. Lowlights inferior video quality and an on going interview with a stoned questioner discussing how rock n roll is going wrong and wouldn't it be great to levitate while playing. The price is not bad but I don't see myself jumping through the low points to view this again. Well maybe for Be Careful with a Fool.",1229040000,15,678,4.346456692913386

306219,5,6301009096,"I've been a Johnny Winter fan for 35 years. There have been some great live releases that have come out over the years, but they have  generally been audio only. Good video footage of Winter is rare. In Winter's case some of his best stuff is live. It is the only way to fully appreciate his full range of playing. From his scorching fast Texas blues/rock hybrid to his slower paced more Chicago style blues, his playing is some of the most impressive ever put down. This video captures all of that and more. The footage for the most part is amazing in its quality, considering the age. The sound is absolutely pristine too. Every set is great on this disc; but I can't tell you how blown away I was with the opening sequence at the Gladsaxe Teen Club, Denmark 1970, set in a very intimate atmosphere. In the Denmark sequence we are also treated to an early version of brother Edgar's ""Frankenstein"" with A young Edgar sitting in. Both Winter brothers' playing is just fabulous on this. There is also a strange but entertaining interview with Johnny, from that era, that is included on the disc. His language and thinking on the interview are certainly reminiscent of the times. What else can be said; this is the disc that Winter fans have been waiting for.",1226707200,6,1258,4.541850220264317

306222,5,6301009096,"Reason I'm giving this DVD such a high rating is because both the sound and picture quality are pristine. Total of fourteen foot-stomping blues rockers as only Johnny Winter is able to play. Couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the three song performance from the 1970 Danish Teen Club show of ""Frankenstein"", the bluesy ""Be Careful Of The Floor"" and ""Drop The Bomb"" + the three song live concert (looks like maybe a 16mm film) snippet from the Royal Albert Hall with brother Edgar on sax. I for one, had no idea the two toured together in 1970. Next up, is the almost ahead-of-it's time presentation of the total *ss-kicking ""Mean Town Blues"" - from a German Beat Club appearance. Following that, it's a two song 1973 Don Kirshner's Rock Concert gig of ""Rock And Roll Hoochie Koo"" and ""Stone Country"" - that I remember seeing on TV when I was in junior high. Sure sounds better in full stereo. Also seem to recall the one track here from Johnny's 1974 Soundstage show - a song written by Muddy Waters, the toe-tapping ""Walking Through The Park"". Wanted to mention the interview snips (appearing at the right place during this DVD) were nice. Simply, a must-have for all true Johnny Winter fans. Would make a memorable holiday gift.",1226275200,35,1231,4.651376146788991

7809028,5,6301009096,"Johnny is the most under-appreciated guitarist in history; probably because of his commitment to playing blues 99% of the time. Starting in the '80s, the blues was sort of stored in the attic upon the advent of Eddie Van Halen, then the genres of Grunge, Metal, and today's Shred guitar. Blues simply wasn't as cool as it used to be as time progressed. Back in the '80s, you'd only get a taste of blues when BB King appeared on ""The Tonight Show"". That never phased Johnny and he was always loyal to the blues. Watch this video and you will hear Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn sounds. Unmistakable, lightning fast blues runs that you thought belonged to Jimi or SRV....were Johnny's licks to begin with. His fluidity, speed, and accuracy are hard to fathom...it seems his left hand is in that F major chord shape up and down the neck on the D G B and high-E strings yet he pulls off some of the most intricate speed-of-light licks you'll ever hear. Check out ""Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo"" (Hobbs on bass and Hughes on drums) and you'll see what I mean. I'm thoroughly convinced that Jimi and SRV were trying to play like Johnny.",1422921600,2,1130,4.490291262135922

7809031,4,6301009096,"This is a compilation of 'some' of Johnny Winters concerts from 1970 to 1979
The footage from Denmark is stunning with some great interplay with Johnnys brother Edgar who can play every instrument brilliantly it seems.
The footage at Albert Hall is poor quality as is the sound, however the performance is stunning. My favourite of his Mean Town Blues is highlighted from a clip from German TV. There is an interview that is put in between songs which annoys me. I prefer to hear the music and can play the interview when I want.
The remainder of the DVD is Johnny's journey into a more rock mode but he did return to the blues in the late 1970s.

The video and sound is  variable but well worth seeing all the same. RIP JW",1410998400,,723,4.388059701492537
