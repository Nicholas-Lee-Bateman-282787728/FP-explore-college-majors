7793794,2,0965286835,"I learned the hard way that this is NOT a ""how to do a handstand"" instructional video.  I purchased it to help my ten year old daughter to learn safely how to 'do' handstands.
This is a short, 22 minute video that shows fine tuning points and techniques of the handstand position suited for athletes who already know how but want to improve technique.  This instruction is done very well and in a lively fashion.
It doesn't instruct how to get up into a handstand position or how to work up to it. Or balance. Or safe exit techniques. Or hand walking or anything else.",1067299200,4,568,4.4
7793795,5,0965286835,"After nearly DESTROYING the first Coach Wayne gymnastics production (from constant use mind you!) this second tape is definitely a fine addition to the Coach Wayne legacy of gymnastics.  Obviously filmed in the very scenic city of Savannah GA, ""The Coach"" hits it over the fence again by preaching form, function and saftey.  A must for cheerleaders and gymnasts, at a buck cheaper than the first tape, I am giving two away for Christmas.  Nicely done. It also offers his secret website adress ... where he offers free advise to students and answers many vistor submitted questions too.",1035849600,,586,4.959183673469388
