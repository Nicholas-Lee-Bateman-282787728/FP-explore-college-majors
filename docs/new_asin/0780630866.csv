34116,4,0780630866,"This movie has a good plot but as the series goes on, it starts to be taken less and less seriously as a horror film.  Starting with this film in the series, Freddy starts to utter one liner jokes and begins to take on a  more lighter and less serious outlook by the public as a evil and hardcore  horror icon.  They should have ended the series with this one in my own  personal opinion because the series is starting to lose it's seriousness as  a horror film. When I start laughing during a horror film, there's  something wrong.  I don't watch horror films to laugh; that's what Jim  Carrey and Adam Sandler are for.  When I watch a horror film, I want to be  scarred out of my wits and have bad dreams for a month;  for example :  ""The Exorcist"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" scarred  the hell out of me the first time I seen it; and you know what...? I didn't  laugh the first time either during the whole movie!!!  My point exactly  with this movie.  It wasn't taken seriously as the first two and the image  of Freddy is starting to become someone you love instead of someone you  should hate. We're talking about a psychotic serial killer who likes to  torture and kill little children while they sleep. Since when did this  start to be something to laugh at??  The image of Freddy slowly but surely  becomes a joke as the series goes on!!!",922579200,,1352,4.316

34138,3,0780630866,"My current reappraisal of the Nightmare on Elm Street series continues....
This, the third film in the series, is admittedly the hardest one for me to share an opinion. It has a pretty decent and engaging story which, unfortunately, the later sequels mostly failed to deliver on. Having said that, the movie definitely has its share of flaws: Heather Langenkamp's character is just patently ridiculous, portrayed as an ""intern therapist"" barely older than her teenage patients! The movie is filled with cringe-worthy cheesy Dokken music, giant glasses, stone washed denim and other period visual atrocities. I know some of the kids out there today seem to worship the 80's for some God forsaken reason, probably because they weren't old enough to actually remember them. But I digress... My point is that it is now extremely dated, somehow looking even more dated than the first two films! The worst thing, though, is how Freddy had changed from a truly horrific figure to a more or less comedy routine - not the least bit scary.
Despite all of those shortcomings the film does remain entertaining for what it is. The Badalamenti score is not cheesy (unlike the Hair Metal), most of the make up effects are still pretty cool, several annoying teens are slaughtered and the origin of Freddy is revealed! Wish me luck as I next delve into Renny Harlin's hack job world of the Dream Master....Part 4",1483574400,,1396,4.894514767932489

34142,5,0780630866,"So you understand, I'm not saying that the first 2 chapters weren't good nor worthy, I'm just referring to how the franchise has matured alot at this point and how they upped the ante big time the 3rd time around.  This chapter is truly no nonsense and balls to the wall.

Freddy is starting to be more comedic this time and his back story is expanded upon finally.  You get to meet Freddy's mother and best of all Nancy Thompson is finally back in the franchise.  That alone is a good reason to watch.  However the special effects are five times better this time along with the visuals, set designs, plot concept, kills, great casting, and some humor.

This time we focus on a group of lowly suicidal teen kids at a mental hospital of whom are given therapy by the good natured Dr. Neil Gordon.  It isn't long before Nancy Thompson makes an appearance to work by Dr. Gordon's side to help them with their nightmares.  At this time a new patient named Kristen Parker is sent there by her mother after she survives Freddy slitting her wrists making it look like a suicide.  Nancy comes to know that not only are the kids are mixed bag with a vast variety of individual issues, but they are all susceptible to Freddy attacking them in their dreams, also they all have individual dream powers that may have the potential of killing Freddy.  Unfortunately Freddy knows their weaknesses and has every intention of using them against the troubled teens.

Some Facts about the Film: It was directed by Chuck Russell and Robert Shaye returns as the producer.  It was written by Wes Craven and co-written by Bruce Wagner.  The score was done by Angelo Badalamenti and the soundtrack was by Dokken.  The cinematography was done by Roy H. Wagner.  The production company was Heron Communications Smart Egg Pictures.  It was once again distributed by New Line Cinema.  It was released to theaters on February 27, 1987.  The production budget was $4.5 million and it made $44.7 million at the box office.

Every scene in this movie looked great.  The set designs for the hospital corridors, hospital rooms, the Thai restaurant, Freddy's house, Freddy's boiler room, the Junkyard, and Freddy's mirror room all had beautiful furniture(where that applied), paint, great decorations, and best of all there was light perfectly used where it was not only a more cheerful scene but also to make it easy to see what's going on clearly.  I also love the perfect use of the dark and creepy shadows where it's grim, foreboding, and unsettling.

The camera work was brilliantly handled.  Where it's most appropriate, the quick zooms forward, the one beautifully done quick zoom back away from Freddy's house, the tight close ups of the actors faces, and the all emcompassing shots where all masterfully done.

The special effects were pure genius.  The special effects for the Freddy snake, the angelic look for John Saxon, the Freddy puppet, Freddy's tv head and metallic arms, and Freddy's skeleton are just some examples of how awesome the special effects are.

The cinematography was at its best in this chapter.  The background shots were just as great looking for the bit of outside shots as they were in the many indoor shots.  All were perfectly captured as well.

The musical score was right on the money as it could go from an eerie low spooky tune, to an ethereal sound, and all the way to a suspense filled heart-pounding sound.

The gore that the movie had to offer was quite good and effectively gruesome.

The kills were extra inventive from the first two movies.  Two of my top faves will always be the head in the tv kill and the gruesome human puppet on a string kill.

Happily there is one scene of sensational nudity provided by the sexy and seductive nurse at the mental hospital.

It was just awesome to have beautiful, sexy, and cool Heather Langencamp back in the role of Nancy Thompson.  Man was Patricia Arquette hot and drop dead gorgeous even back then.  Thankfully Jennifer Rubin got to look hot and gorgeous in her punker look.

All in all, this chapter proves highly exceptional as it triumphed with it's interesting characters, sexy scream queens, amazing special effects and set designs, it's great pacing, fab camera work, beautiful and brilliant musical score, cool storyline, concept of control and magical powers in ones dream, Robert Englund beginning to play Freddy with more of a sense of humor, and above all finally getting a little more info(but not all) regarding Freddy's origin.  A must see!!!  10 stars out of 10!!!",1477180800,,4537,4.76056338028169

M-Net premiered it a while back and I watched it again and --- nada!

34148,4,0780630866,"Released in 1987, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors picks up where the original 1984 movie left off. Fresh from college, Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is now a psychiatrist specializing in dream therapy. She gets a gig at a psychiatric hospital to help a group of teens who face Freddy Krueger, the same supernatural psycho she encountered in the original (Robert Englund). One of the kids is Kristen (Patricia Arquette), who has the power to draw others into her dreams. Hooking up with a male doctor (Craig Wasson), Nancy tries to equip the kids and strategizes a rescue attempt into Krueger's domain, with the hope of putting the fiend to death forever. Laurence Fishburne is on hand as staff security at the institute.

Some people feel that ""Dream Warriors"" is the real follow-up to the original movie, which benefited by bringing Wes Craven back to the fold for the script. They feel the actual first sequel, 1985's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge,"" was just a rushed attempt to get a sequel out as fast as possible to capitalize on the still hot hype of the original. They say it wasn't well thought-out or paced and therefore seems out-of-sync. I disagree. I found it a perfectly fitting and effective continuation of the story. We know from part 3 (this movie) that Nancy was off at college during the time of part 2 so what was wrong with showing what was happening back on Elm Street with a new cast of characters?

In any case, practically the entire story in Dream Warriors takes place in or around the psychiatric hospital, and you really get the feeling that the staff and patients are real people. You sense, for instance, that Max (Fishburne) really cares about the kids; moreover, the warmth between Nancy and Dr. Gordon (Wasson) is palpable. Like the original, Heather makes for a quality protagonist and Englund is charismatic as the sinister psycho.

The movie runs 96 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles (the psychiatric hospital is at UCLA in Westwood).

34156,3,0780630866,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 has Freddy taking on many forms (which is interesting), but this movie feels more like sci-fi than horror. Furthermore, the creators should've made up their minds as to what direction they wanted to go in terms of darkness; this movie yanks us back and forth between darkness and lightness. While there are some memorable scary moments in this movie, there aren't enough to keep your interest for a 98 minute movie. Finally, this movie has the feel and look (at times) of two very famous horror films (The Shining, The Thing 1982) in terms of special effects. This third installment in the series is just as inferior as the second, and just as unnecessary. This movie is simply a special effects extravaganza, and distracting at that.  The plot vehicle (dreams becoming real) is unique for the horror genre, but unfortunately the acting is subpar in supporting it. Overall, this movie is very mediocre, as it doesn't capture the imagination like the first movie. Here, the imagination is handed to us via all of the 'goodies.'

34176,4,0780630866,"The saga continues as Freddy returns to kill off the last Elm Street kids, whose parents took part in burning the child murderer Fred Krueger to death years ago.  Director Chuck Russell (The Blob) delivers this third franchise installment in a mental hospital (6 years after the events of part 1) which houses several teenagers who all share the same nightmare of a man with claws on one hand, a burnt face and an ugly sweater.  Coming to their aid, Nancy (Heather Langenkamp; A Nightmare on Elm Street) returns to Springwood with a Masters Degree in psychology and supports the young patients claims, which are largely dismissed as mass hysteria by the staff.  How convenient [diabolical laugh].

The five troubled teen patients are an eclectic bunch and include Patricia Arquette (Stigmata), Rodney Eastman (I Spit on Your Grave) and Jennifer Rubin (Screamers, Bad Dreams).  Youll also enjoy a young Laurence Fishburne (Event Horizon, The Colony) as an orderly to round out a solid cast in this surprisingly well written horror movie in which, as seems to be a trend in the NOES franchise, Freddys menace becomes increasingly iconic of sick humor rather than terror.

The by-now iconic Freddy (Robert Englund; Wishmaster, Hatchet) returns as the same demonic power with the red and green sweater, a single clawed glove, a face still-moistly burned beyond recognition, and a penchant for painfully raking his claws over metal objects.  However, unlike part 1 and Freddys Revenge, Freddy is now more outspoken and no longer hides in the shadows like a mysterious boogeyman.  He has a much more active role on screen.

What makes this sequel completely dissimilar to its predecessor is that it doesnt take place in the residences or high school on Elm Street.  The mental hospital offers an eerie new medium for Freddy, and a convenient one since the hospital staff readily considers the teen deaths (as they mount in the story) to be the suicides of troubled youth!

Another interesting touch is that, in their nightmares with Freddy, each of the teen dreamers retains a sort of special power they always had in their dreams.  A wheelchair-bound Dungeons and Dragons dork becomes a physically capable wizard, the attitudinal token black guy has super strength, the drug addict becomes a mohawked punk knife fighter, the mute gains the ability to speak, and our heroine becomes an acrobat.  These abilities help them combat Freddy in the dreamworld while, in turn, Freddy uses their fears and weaknesses against them.

This third installment also plays with the rules of Freddys dreamscape.  In part 1 we were introduced to the terrifying notion that someone can kill us in our dreams (and we really die!) and Nancy was able to pull Freddy into reality, part 2 removed from us not only control of our dreams but also control of our body while awake, and now in Dream Warriors people can pull each other into their dreams and Freddy is able to depart the dream world and enter reality on his ownwhich doesnt seem to follow the NOES rules.  That last bit (Freddy choosing to crossover into reality) may seem like a horrible rule violation, but I forgive it.  It happened only once, it was prefaced with his increased power from accumulating souls, and it made for a great scene in which he possessed his own burnt remains (a charred skeleton) to prevent Nancys father (John Saxon; Blood Beach, A Nightmare on Elm Street) from burying his remains on holy ground.  Watching the skeleton battle Nancys father and the hospital psychiatrist was pure joy!

This sequel has also steered clear of the unease of Freddys Revenge, instead offering more diverse kills to the Krueger formula.  The wrist tendon puppeteering scene was brilliant and very hard to watch; welcome to prime time is one of Freddys best lines ever; a cripple faces the wheelchair from Hell; an addict meets a syringe-fingered Freddy; Joey and the sexy Freddy-succubus nurse was a great teen-fantasy-gone-wrong; and the Freddy-snake swallowing scene was appropriately shocking, unique and gross.  Overall, this was the Freddy movie that started making the kills fun in addition to being creative.  Freddys dreamscape has become a twisted carnival funhouse.

This is the kind of sequel the franchise deserves!  We call back to many elements that worked before, like replacing shadowy, steam-spewing boiler rooms and the creepy power plant where Freddy worked in life with the junkyard where his remains were hidden; instead of face impressions on Nancys bedroom wall and Freddys form emerging through Jesses stomach and his claws piercing through his fingertips, we find Freddy manifesting himself through a television set; where once Freddy licked through the phone or lengthily licked the stomach of Jesses love interest, he now tethers a teenagers limbs in a sick fantasy; and rather than slicing off his own fingers or revealing his own brain, he uncovers his soul-embedded chest.  Also continuing to flavor the franchise, we revisit Nancys dilapidated dreamworld house and unnerving little girls, likely the ghosts of Freddys victims.  I should add that I still enjoy ALL of the practical effects in all three of the first NOES films.  Sometimes the simplicity makes it more gross, weird, off-putting, or even a bit funny; and thrillingly FUN.

Oh, right!  And Dream Warriors has contributed to the Freddy mythology in the form of Amanda Krueger, a ghostly nun tells the horrible story of Freddys conception, the product of rape in a mental hospital.  Son of a hundred maniacs.

Being presented in a completely different style, this is not comparable to the original.  It remains a fun movie experience and well worth the ride for the first time or for a good re-watch.  It certainly made me smile.",1441929600,,5761,5.00524109014675

34192,5,0780630866,"continuing my stroll down the 80's comfort food aisle, i revisited a nightmare on elm street 3: the dream warriors, a movie that occupies an interesting place amongst die-hard elm street fans: i think most of us would agree that, of the first six movies, this is the best sequel, even tho it really gets wise-crackin freddy into the spotlight. it's the fourth movie that gets all ridiculous, tho, with freddy wearing sunglasses on the beach; in dream warriors, he's still pretty mean, even if a little more light-hearted about it. dream warriors is the transitional movie, giving (most of) us what we love about the series: brutal freddy, nancy, creative special effects, and also what we don't: freddy the jokester, craig wasson, and perhaps a little too much polish. lots of the dialogue needs help, too. either way, this is a fun flick, and my  favorite elm street sequel.

so, pretending like the second movie didn't happen, which is too bad, cus what a unique and fabulous movie that is, we pick up several years after the original. nancy thompson has become a cutting edge dream researcher/mental health counselor, and is coming back to springwood to help the final generation of elm street kids. it's interesting how all of the original elm street parents, after having burned freddy krueger to death, have all gone on to be seemingly terrible parents. look at nancy, glen, tina, and rod's folks from the original. all absentee, emotionally distant, and dysfunctional. elaine, kristen's mother, who i have a hard time seeing burning anyone to death, continues this trend. donald thompson returns from the original, and he aint winning any ""father of the year"" awards. is wes craven informing us that vengeance is empty and destructive? dream warriors is also filled with questions of faith, christian theology, science, and cultural attitudes towards dreaming.

the cast, except for craig wasson, who i just can't stand, as he drains the energy from every scene he appears, is top notch. laurence fishburne is on hand to play the compassionate nurse, max, and priscilla pointer is appropriately evilish as dr. simms. the teens are excellent. patricia arquette brings both power and sadness to kristen. when kristen shows up, the kids finally have a weapon to use against freddy: teamwork. all the kids are great, and ken sagoes carves an especially memorable niche for himself as kincaid, a$$ kicker and freddy trash talker. heather langenkamp is wonderful as nancy, providing the kids with leadership, protection, compassion, and trust. despite her really curly, frizzy, bad hair, langenkamp once again demonstrates what scream queens--and final girls--require, as she consistently meets freddy head on, decisively, and with agency. robert englund is wonderful, and clearly having a ball. the way he modulates his voice thru this movie is a delight, and, even when making with the funnies, he still gets some menace in there.

dream warriors is packed to the gills with incredible make-up and fx work from kevin yagher, greg cannom (he does the veins!), and mark shostrum (freddy worm).  the filmmakers fully exploit the world of dreams and create a gothic nightmare of decay. at times the smoothness and red-lighting detract from the horror, but they certainly add to the dark fantasy, and i think this is what dream warriors is, a dark horror fantasy. chuck russell's direction is smooth, and the story, worked on by craven, russell, frank darabont, and bruce wagner, is above average for this type of movie.

i love dream warriors, and have since i saw it the saturday after it opened. it's dated in places and could use some dialogue polish, bit it's overwhelmingly awesome. the effects, acting, and atmosphere are all top notch. you'll definitely want to grab your crucifix, tho.",1438300800,,3792,5.0495207667731625

34245,5,0780630866,"Wes Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) became a cult classic immediately on arrival but after its critically panned but still enjoyable sequel, A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985), Bob Shaye and the heads at New Line wanted to make a sequel that would win fans and critics over. Originally, Wes Craven penned a script with Bruce Wagner but because of creative differences with the studio, New Line hired up and coming writer/director team Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont to change some elements. Both Russell and Darabont felt because of the serious tone of the two previous installments and of Craven's original script that a new direction was needed for the series. Released in 1987, A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors has some of its roots in the original film, bringing Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) back is a good example of this but Russell makes a film that is slightly more comedic and almost comic book like which makes it a breath of fresh air. Freddy Krueger has more personality here then he ever had previously and there are even moments of satire including an ingenious sequence with Dick Cavett. This is a wonderful, adventurous and inspired entry with well developed characters and plenty of imaginative scenes of horrific humor. It's no wonder that this is the film where Freddy went from cult to pop culture icon. The only issue I have with it is Nancy being killed off but most slasher sequels are guilty of this. Interesting note: co-writer Frank Darabont went on to direct to Oscar nominated films The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999).",1392854400,,1617,4.883636363636364

Nancy returns in this one.  She's become a psychiatrist and a specialist in pattern nightmares.  In the hospital she works with a group of teens who all share a common element.

Among the group is a girl named Kristen.  She has a special gift.  She can pull others into her dreams.  When Freddy attacks her she calls for Nancy. Revealing to Nancy that the teens are the last of the Elm Street children and  that Freddy has returned for them.

Nancy's knowledge of dreams has advanced since her last encounter with Krueger.  At some point everyone has had a dream power - an ability that makes the dreamer stronger in the dream than in real life. Nancy trains the others to utilize their Dream Powers even in a Freddy Dream. One was a Wizard, another had Super Strength, next became a Bad Ass Punk, Kristen was an Olympic Level Gymnast.

Freddy's origins are also revealed in this chapter.  Freddy's mom had been a young girl who was accidently locked in a psych ward with the criminally insane.  Before she was found she'd been rape 100's of times.  Freddy Krueger was the Son of 100 maniacs.

In the final battle Nancy, Kristen and others link up in a single dream.  Using their powers they go after Freddy.  They become the Dream Warriors.  Several fall in battle, including Nancy.  She fights Freddy until her last breath.

John Saxon also returns as Nancy's pessimistic father(Lt. Donald Thompson)& reveals that Donald is the only person who knows where Freddy's remains are hidden after Dr. Gordon finds out from Sister Mary Helena(Nan Martin) that the only way to kill Freddy is to lay his bones to rest, but then Dr. Gordon discovers later at Nancy's funeral that Sister Mary is actually Freddy's mother(Amanda Krueger).

A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 was also released in theatres in February of 1987 and was the highest grossing film of 1987 and this flick got very positive reception from critics, especially when compared to the first sequel A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-PART II: FREDDY'S REVENGE which was called the ""Bummer of the Summer"" since it flopped at the box office during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1985 which prompted this films producers to bring back Nancy & Donald from the original which was released in the Fall of 1984 along with the fact that the original is still the best installment of the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET saga series to this very day just like the original John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN is.

Therefore director(Charles Russell)wanted to make A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET III more similar to the original A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET to bring the ratings back up just like they did with HALLOWEEN IV: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS in the Fall of 1988 since its predecessor HALLOWEEN 3: THE SEASON OF THE WITCH toppled at the box office in the Fall of 1982 since it had no Michael Myers and was totally unrelated to its predecessors HALLOWEEN I and HALLOWEEN 2 which prompted them to bring the ghoulish Michael Myers back by making a 4th installment of the HALLOWEEN saga and just like Paramount did by bringing back the diabolical Jason Voorhees back in FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 6: JASON LIVES in the Summer of 1986 since its predecessor FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 5: A NEW BEGINNING fizzled at the box office in the Spring of 1985 since Part V had no Jason in it since Jason had presumably died off in its predecessor FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART IV: THE FINAL CHAPTER which was theatrically released in the Spring of 1984.",1385510400,,2800,5.095860566448802

34268,4,0780630866,"If you are like me, by the time most stories reach a ""part 3"" you're already somewhat over it.  Not to mention, cinematic history has again and again left us feeling ripped off by many a part 3... for me that list is long, no doubt the reader of this review has experienced the same.

  This is different though.  Dream Warriors is super well done.  The premise, is interesting and the dreamscape battle is full of unexpected twists.  Well worth watching for fans of scarey movies and Freddy Krueger fans in particular.

  It is in this movie where we learn of Freddy's heritage.  His mother was held captive for days by inmates of an asylum for the criminally insane.  She was raped hundreds of times over a period of days until she was discovered and freed.  As the creepy old nun who told the story put it, ""he is the b#sturd son of a hundred maniacs."" That certainly puts a few things into perspective. Not to mention introduces me to a cool new catchphrase that I can use to more colorfully describe my former boss.

His role in the organization was to crush the joy out of the lives of his direct reports.  Imagine a b#sturd son of a hundred maniacs!  Now imagine that guy with a god complex and a penchant for quoting Rush Limbaugh throughout the day.  Take the person who is now in your imagination and add a comb-over that would make Donald Trump point and snicker...  Now imagine that 5 days a week, 50% of your waking hours are monitored, directed and critiqued by that man... but I digress.

I think this may have been the best of the Freddy Krueger movies.",1376784000,4,1569,4.423076923076923
34269,5,0780630866,"Don't let my review fool you into buying the box set--only 1 and 3 are worth watching. 1 is very good, but 3 is one of the all time greats! This is quintessential Krueger; If you liked 1 and Freddy Vs. Jason or even any of the others, then you absolutely have to have this one! This was Englund's best Freddy performance; his funniest; best makeup; his scariest performance; the writer's best story; best acting by the group; etc. There is nothing major wrong with it! The scene with the girl and the tv could be seen as over the top or, rather, a glimpse into how stupid denial makes adults in scary movies like this(scene: when the children go to sleep, they are vulnerable to any thing that can happen in any nightmare for real--Freddy's trademark. Anyway, one of the kids is watching a tv that is some 15 or 20 ft. off the floor, but(when the girl somehow finds herself through the tv without a ladder being present)the doctor in charge sees nothing wrong with that! If you like scary movies and don't like this one, then you're--simply put--retarded on the genre and should give it up! Yeah, just switch to romantic comedies and call it a day!

This is the best fantasy based horror movie ever! The movie starts out brilliantly by showing a scene(as dreams are often closely based on events in one's real life) that the girl in the scene dreams about later(it will make perfect sense, if you know this). Anyway, there are--as in all the movies--a group of kids on/from Elm Street(the place where Freddy--after getting off for multiple child molestations-- was burned alive by the first parents of the first children in the first movie). Freddy has become this demon who gets revenge on these Elm Street children for what those parents did. Any kids that live here are cursed and doomed via nightmares. Whatever happens in their dreams happens for real bc of Freddy. Freddy manipulates the dreams to kill and fear strengthens him. The more that the kids think of him; the more they dream about him and the more fierce their dreams. Freddy also wields the 5 bladed--metallically clawed--glove. In this movie: he doesn't rely on the fear as much bc fear in him is already established due to him being in his horror prime and due to the kids chaotically not knowing what to do and the kids that he's killed in the past strengthen him. All the Elm Street kids have been written off as crazy and live in an asylum, bc they are seen as suicidal(bc of what happens in their dreams). Adults think they are doing these things to themselves. These kids also have special abilities that come true in their dreams--of which they can use to attack Freddy(hence, the dream warriors). Or so they think, as--due their inexperience--they pose only an annoyance! One of the kids even tries to beat Freddy as a wizard in the name of a fictional god and is defeated; I got a real kick out of that. Freddy is stronger than ever due to the kids he has killed over time. As devils are defeated by God in real life, so to is Freddy. Just when it seems like he will defeat them all, they get help from an old sympathizer(Nancy), her cop father, and another new professional guy who isn't as stubborn against the truth as the doctor(who prolongs their suffering and allows Freddy to kill them one by one due to her skepticism in light of evidence that cannot be explained away). Notice that at times Freddy--just as he did with Jason--uses their fears and temptations against them in the dream world and how they make references to Freddy's history and his old wicked hobby in the dream world. The end is really special and I won't spoil it! Hope this sheds some light for you.",1365811200,2,3655,4.546282245827011

Nancy has grown up to become a doctor specializing in pattern dreams. When she finds out about the kids dreaming of Freddy she becomes determined to intervene, which causes her to butt heads with the establishment.

34272,5,0780630866,"The original 1984 Nightmare On Elm Street remains an absolute classic of the horror genre and even a legion of sequels couldn't ruin or undermine its importance or the fact that it's a great horror flick. Although for a genre of films that makes money on a franchise having numerous sequels (let's face it those movies cost very little to make and have the potential to generate big revenues) I thought they completely missed with the sequel, Freddy's Revenge and it added nothing to the original and superior nightmare. A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (the first of three nightmares with the word ""dream"" in its title) succeeds were the first sequel failed. This is one example of a sequel that actually works; it doesn't mess with the original storyline (Freddy doesn't just rip out of people's bodies this time around), introduces new elements that add something to the original film, we see some of the previous characters, and it has all the things that makes it a great Nightmare film. Director Wes Craven returns to create was at the time intended as the final ANOES movie but of course we all know how that turned out...).  The intention was there and Craven coming back certainly helped. They knew they messed up with the second film and a third would be their opportunity to end it up as trilogy and do so properly. Dream Warriors is to me one of the best horror sequels and is one that is actually worth watching, I can get people not liking the sequels but DW is a solid horror film and comes very close to the first.

The concept this time is that kids are put basically in a mental institution for various reasons and each of them is haunted in their dreams by Freddy Krueger. The lead character this time around, Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) has the unique gift and ability to pull people in her dream which was a cool feature. One by one Freddy goes after the kids and the mental institution people deny that there is anything wrong with their dreams of course. They added some back story and did it rather well. In this film the kids are tormented by Krueger because their parents burned him alive and killed him. They are said to be ""the last of the elm street children"". We also see for the first time Amanda Krueger, Freddy's mother and she tells the back story as to how Freddy came to be which is something fascinating for fans. I thought she was one of the most frightening and best aspects of Dream Warrior. They all tied it in nicely to make a great final movie and hopefully an apology for the disappointing second film. Part III featured nudity, suicide and drug references and is therefore a bit heavier when it comes to content, they went all out on this one. There are many memorable scenes such as Freddy turning into a snake, the junkyard scene as well, and the effects were really good for the era.

The best part is you actually like those kids and the actors who play them; they're some of the most loveable characters the series has had and they have edge unlike some of the later weaker sequels. Usually you don't care, but in this case you want them to survive. It was great to see Heather Langenkamp reprise her role of Nancy and it added a great dimension to the film, having someone from the original film and integrate so well in that continuing story. This time around Nancy is not the hero and sort of passes the torch even, but I like what they did with her character here. Having her work around her expertise of dreams was a nice touch. John Saxon also comes back as Heather's father and this time he plays a bit of a bigger role I'd say, he is certainly more important here and it was nice to see another familiar face back on board. Craig Wasson as the doctor who tries to help the kids with Nancy I thought did a fantastic job also.

The cheese factor is definitely there, but it's all fun yet the edge of the series is there even though it's clearly a product of its time, 1987 (Dokken anyone?). Other than the first A Nightmare On Elm Street who had a slightly more serious tone, this one has no competition and if it's not the best Nightmare it's very close and at least the best sequel. It brought back what we loved so much about the first and is in some ways a superior film even. It's very memorable Slasher flick and it explains the story of Freddy which makes it a must for fans and horror enthusiasts DO NOT miss out on Dream Warriors. 5/5",1345075200,3,4417,4.435960591133005
34293,5,0780630866,"""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3-Dream Warriors"" is simply my favorite out of all the ""Elm Street"" movies. Thankfully, Wes Craven came back this time around (after refusing to be part of the sequel) and made the movie funny, exciting, innovative and down-right good.

 In this outing Freddy torments a bunch of teenagers housed at a psycho ward. He of course goes into their dreams and decides the fates of each character.

 One of the best parts of the film are some of the one-liners Craven gives Freddy such as the one in which he says to a character that cannot talk, ""What's wrong? Tongue tied are we?"" and the best line in the movie when Freddy murders a girl who wants to be a TV actress. After smashing her head into a television screen he utters, ""Welcome to Prime Time Bitch!"". Simply hilarious!

Nancy Thompson is back in this third movie, now older, and working as an intern in a hospital (or is it a mental institution? I don't remember). When Kristen Parker begins having some twisted dreams of a killer with knives for fingers that stalks her dreams, Nancy is the only person who will believe her. The two of them must convince the doctors not to force them to sleep, because they will end up helpless against their dreams. When word gets out that the doctor wants to sedate the teenagers...
Then one among them dies. Killed by Freddy Krueger (I don't remember who dies first). The doctor tries to shrug it off as a suicide attempt, but, as the kids slowly drop (one by one), evidence that there could be a killer stalking their sleep gets out, and it is realized that he must be stopped  before everybody dies!
This movie is deliciously evil, to the core, and contains information we've been frantically trying to discover about Freddy throughout the whole franchise (as SPOILER!!! Nancy's father has a talk with a nun named ""Sister Mary Helena"" and, when she dies, and don't quote this, her grave says something like this: Sister Mary Helena, name in Christ: Amanda Krueger... Freddy's mother!)
This is probably the best casting, directing, writing, and acting of the series, and it will always be my favourite of the Elm Street movies. It is a treat to own this movie. It lives up to Nightmare and surpasses Nightmare II, which I didn't like.",1344124800,2,1633,4.6116838487972505

34296,5,0780630866,"A Nightmare on Elm Street brought to movie goers the imfamous Freddy Krueger and we were taken on a horrific journey as young Nancy Thompson battled Freddy for her very life. After the horrible second film, Wes Craven decided to take charge and tried to end the series with this second masterpiece.

The last surviving Elm Street children are locked up in a hospital and are treated as nothing more than disturbed teens in need of therapy. None of the adults either knows or believe what is going on but luckily for our doomed youngsters, Nancy returns in an effort to help them. Nancy has since become a mental health expert and tries to teach the surviving teens how to control their dreams. Kristen, for example, has the power to pull people in her dreams to assist her or in many cases put them in the same peril as she is facing and we are introduced to new characters who go along this terrifying journey and Freddy displays his most gruesome secret.....he imprisons the souls of his victims.

The entire story is excellent and the film gives the audience a sense of hopeless and despair as the teens try to explain what is happening and their pleas for help are ignored. The actors did an excellent job portraying their characters and Freddy pulls out all the stops when he tortures and kills his victims.

I highly recommend this film not just for sci-fi/horror fans but anybody who enjoys a good movie and enjoys a good scare.",1313625600,3,1435,4.59765625

I like it when goofy horrors make fun of themselves, but it wasn't clear during some of this movie if that was the case.

I think there is definitely a decline since the first and second movies here. I've seen bits of sequels after this one and I can't say I'm even interested they seem so ridiculous. I think they should have laid it to rest after this one, save for the New Nightmare years after this. That one just might be the best in the series after the original and it is clear that it's making fun of itself throughout, instead of leaving me to wonder.

Overall, it was just ok. I don't think I'll watch it again though. Even alone in the dark during a thunderstorm (I really couldn't have done more for ambiance), I found myself rolling my eyes at some of the poor acting and pathetic script writing.",1275955200,2,1108,4.197183098591549

Personally, I thought that was probably the best of the sequels since it picked up where the first left off and brought it to a new area, and only 5 out of 6 sequels picked up where the original left off. If there had to be one problem with this one it would be with that one doctor since she did not want to listen to the kids and the ending result of that was that half the kids were killed. Also it seems that in every movie that there is always one or two interfering grown-ups and it always comes to the same thing and that is they've got to go against the clock before that character is killed. There were some really good parts in the film I thought that some of the best scenes in this were when they were showing off their powers, and I liked the fight between their doctor and Freddy's skeleton, as well, which only served to point out that there could only be one or two trustworthy adults in every movie.

34344,5,0780630866,"New director for this third episode. The modern world is growing and we are starting to have the information highway coming into the picture. The new architecture is very striking and powerful. We come back to a girl as the center of the film, but at once that girl is living with her mother and her male guests. But also at once she is moved to a hospital where she meets a whole gang of young people who are Freddy's victims. Freddy does not try to make anyone kill the others. At first he tries to terrorize them into committing suicide.

Society reacts as can be expected : the kids are calling for some attention and their dreams and suicides are nothing but the symptoms of their guilt. A junior doctor reacts positively when a psychiatrist comes into the picture, and this psychiatrist is the surviving girl of a preceding episode. This leads to a psychiatric ward in a hospital with all these kids, and group therapy.

This time Freddy has a group against him, a group that can remain united, or at least the survivors can, and they can start a war against this Freddy. The film also densifies Freddy Krueger with a mother who was a medical personnel in the old psychiatric ward of the very hospital in which we are. This wing of the building was closed when this young woman was by accident left behind in the ward surrounded by all kinds of crazy criminals.

She was raped and many other things and Freddy is her son. Even worse she lost her head, though not completely and could then dedicate the end of her life to religion. She became a nun. The father of the young psychiatrist who has survived Freddy was one of those who burnt Freddy to death when he was caught after kudnapping and killing twenty children. His remains had never been buried. The father will finally accept to tell where the bones are. During that time the kids and the young psychiatrist are getting into the dream to save the others who have been taken and to get rid of Freddy.

They will not all come back, but they will come back after Freddy's destruction by the junior doctor burying the bones and sprinkling them with holy water before covering them with earth. It is the first time the christian theme is brought in with holy water and a crucifix, hence with a parallel to vampires. The film then is a new twist in the general fabric invented by Wes Craven and it is quite effective. We must go on in this saga to see where we are going, where we are taken to. Be sure Freddy will live forever and ever, ever after the end of each film.

34345,3,0780630866,"My dad, ever the moralist, never allowed me to watch Freddy Krueger movies as a kid. He said that they led to the discrimination against burn victims, and that he would take no part in that. So I'm in catch up mode with this series. This is the second that I've seen in the series after I watched the original a few months ago. Overall, it is a step down, though not a massive one. Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) from the original is brought in as a savior of sorts to a bunch of kids in a psych ward placed there because of ""suicide"" attempts. Patricia Arquette, looking surprisingly hot in her younger days, takes on the role of Kristen who is our main character here. From there everything else is pretty much predictable. Kids try not to fall asleep, they eventually do, Freddy slices and dices. Only in this chapter the goofiness factor is turned up full blast. Look, there's Freddy up in the sky playing the role of puppet master, oh and now he has turned into a TV set, and now a creepy little doll. There is also this terrible little twist that these kids gain certain powers when they fall asleep. The scene in which they come together for a group dream so that they can show off their powers couldn't have fallen any flatter for me. I am also hoping that somebody could explain to me the scene in which one of the kids turns into the ""Wizard Master"" and shoots a very 1980's pre-CGI green lightning bolt out of his hand to destroy a murderous wheelchair Freddy had turned loose on him. . .because I'm at a loss. To me that scene captures everything wrong with this film. Also, the less said about the scene where Freddy's skeleton comes to life the better.

But under all this kookiness there are some good messages to be found here. We, of course, get the traditional, fight your fears and believe in teamwork. But we also get the more unconventional lesson of never listen to your elders because they don't know what the hell they are talking about. Throughout this film (and the original) every decision made by a figure of authority turns out to be dead wrong. Here the only things more evil than Freddy are the clueless authority figures who serve the kids up to him with their idiocy. On the flipside we also get the kids who are punished for ""Overt sexuality"" (shock!). One if left for dead with Freddy after chasing after an easy, eager blond. The director, Chuck Russell, does find time for a striptease first. I guess he'll be sex on Freddy's hit list. I do wish that I could go back in time and enjoy this film for what it is. But my eyes have seen too many movies and have turned critical on me. So I know that the acting here is bad and the special effects (which are used liberally) are so horrible your jaw will drop. There is a kinetic energy at work here that makes it an easy pill to swallow.  I will also admit that the silliness here does cut both ways. Most of the kills are borderline brain dead, but they are also interesting and eye-catching. Russell wasn't shy about screwing this one up, and oddly enough I admire him for that. **3/4",1165104000,3,3065,4.394366197183099
34346,3,0780630866,"For me, the second one was absolutely diabolical, and seeing as I'd just bought the seven disc set, I was angry, and reluctant to watch the rest. I was persuaded, and found myself actually enjoying Dream Warriors. It continues on a few years after the first one, and it's like the second one never happened, as there's no apparent reference to it.

Dream Warriors is made all the better for a higher budget and bringing back Heather Langenkamp. She's definitely an asset to the movies and although she doesn't appear again until the seventh movie (as herself, strangely enough), hopefully the movies will continue the same as this.

A very, very young Patricia Arquette appears in this, her first film, and thankfully she has managed to hone her acting over the years. She's laughable in this. Also look out for ""Larry"" Fishburne!!! Larry, good grief.

The story is basically simple: a young girl (Arquette) is put into a psychiatric ward, with others, who discover they're all dreaming about the same man. They find an understanding adult in the form of Heather, who was of course in the original. She's older, wiser, and specialising in this kinda thing. She tries to help him, but when she finds out Arquette's character can bring others into her dream, they agree to go in and tackle Freddy.

What makes this film better than the second one, is the deaths are becoming bigger and better. One girl dies being put through a TV during Critters - she dreamt of being an actress. Then there's the whole back story to Freddy. We find out his mother was raped repeatedly, and actually appears in the film - a little twist in the plot. He was also never properly buried, and needs to be buried in holy ground, and that will finally get rid of him. Obviously not enough to spawn another 4 sequels.

My suggestion is that you skip the second one, and move straight from part one to part three. Honestly, you will never know the difference. Definitely the best of the series so far. Look out for a severely phallic Freddy snake, and a very cool stop motion puppet.",1164844800,,2057,4.6401098901098905

34348,5,0780630866,"Ohhhhhhhhhh my my my, what can I say about this one?  By the time it entered home video on vhs in late 1987, I was not familiar with Freddy at all except for the fact that I knew the premise....he can kill in your dreams and goes after kids and teens.  The fact that I was at that time only goin on age 15 did not help.  I was terrified of anything related to horror.  In my mind Freddy was the worst.  As a scared 15 year old kid, Freddy was the last thing I wanted to view.  I was watching films like, Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back.  Those I could handle.  However, in late summer of 1987, a friend of mine rang me up and told me to come over because he had a new movie he had rented that he wanted me to watch.  I asked him what it was and he wouldnt tell me.  All he said was that id be surprised and that id really like it.  So, I went over and he wouldnt let me see the title on the box.  He just slid it into the slot of the VCR.  Folks, I saw the New Line Cinema Logo and then this graphic,  ""Sleep, those little slices of death.  How I loathe them....Edgar Allan Poe""  My mind started to reel but I had not yet realized what this film was; and then I saw the title, ""A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS.""  Now mind you the closest I ever came to seeing this film was the wonderfully cool Dokken Video on MTV called, Dream Warriors.  I even had a hard time viewing the visage of Freddy in that MTV video.  Hilarious huh??  Anyway, when I saw the title come up, I grabbed my coat and I was getting the hell out of there and quickly.  However, my buddy begged me to give it a chance, he said its not as bad as I was thinkin and that id actually find certain parts of it actually funny.  Now I thought he was pullin my leg with that statement.  Even his mother told me id like it.  She had already seen it in the theatres and so had my buddy.  So, once I heard her reassure me as well, I decided to give it a chance.  As the opening of the film carried on I viewed the front cover on the box.  A vicious looking cover with Freddy's face leering over several teens facing him, appearing to stand on his out-stretched knives with a tagline that I find today to be one of the most creative taglines ever!!!  ""If you think you'll get out alive, you must be dreaming.""  Anyhow, suffice it to say, after experiencing dream warriors, I was instantly relieved and I was also an instant fan!!  I couldn't believe it actually because id sworn this character off.  I was terrified of him.  I suppose id have to thank my buddy Mike C. for that.  Thank you Mike for opening the door to this series for me.  Ive loved it ever since.  Ive seen all of them.  Many argue and argue over which film is the best, but Dream Warriors will always hold a special place in my heart because it was my first Nightmare and the first time I had to get ready for Freddy!!  :)  Hope you enjoyed my review.

34349,4,0780630866,"Once again, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) is back to terrorize a group of unsuspecting teenagers in this third installment of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series, but this time its no ordinary group; these are the last of the Elm Street children.

Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) has been having terrible dreams about Freddy Krueger.  Kristen's mother was one of the people who was charged with burning Freddy alive.  Kristen's dreams continue until one night, she ends up slitting her own wrists while in her dream-like state.  She is soon confined to Springwood Hospital.

At the hospital, Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) is invloved with a group of teenagers.  These are the last children of Elm Street whose parents were involved in Freddy's murder.  These include Will (Ira Heiden), Jennifer (Penelope Sudrow), Taryn (Jennifer Rubin), Phillip (Bradley Gregg), Roland (Ken Sagoes) and Joey (Rodney Eastman).

Dr. Elizabeth Simms (Priscilla Pointer) is the leader of this group of children.  She, along with Dr. Gordon has hired a new staff member who has experience in the field of dream interpretation.  This person is Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp).  Meanwhile, Kristen has been slipping deeper into her dreams.  Dr. Simms and Dr. Gordon try to help her out, but they fail.  Only Nancy, who heard Kristen singing Freddy's rhyme, knows what is really going on.  Later that night, Kristen has another nightmare.  During her dream, she calls out Nancy's name.  Nancy hears Kristen's voice and ends up in her nightmare, where she saves Kristen.  She also realizes that Freddy is back.

Unfortunately, the other members of the group are having their own nightmares.  Phillip has a dream that Freddy turns him into a marionette, and he falls from the hospital's bell tower.  The staff members seem to think it was a suicide, but Nancy thinks otherwise.  She persuades Neil to prescribe Hypnocil, a dream suppressant, to the others.  Nancy tells the others about Freddy, and also about Kristen's ability to pull others into her dreams.  Nancy persuades Kristen to try out her abilities on the others and soon, everyone is showing off their ""dream talents"".  However, Freddy has also been awakened as well.

However, Dr. Simms is unconvinced of Neil and Nancy's techniques.  She relieves both of them from their positions and are asked to leave.  While Neil is loading his car, he notices a person in the bell tower.  It turns out to be sister Mary Helena (Nan Martin).  She tells him a story of a young woman, Amanda Krueger, who was locked in the tower and raped by over 100 men.  Freddy was the bastard child of these men.  She goes on to say that the only way to stop Freddy is to find his remains and give him a proper burial.

Will Neil find the remains before Freddy kills the rest of the children?

I thought this movie was very good.  Freddy is back and better than ever, and his one-liners are pretty funny.  The story continues to be good, and Robert Englund continues to be teriffic as Freddy.

Both chilling and funny, this is a movie to watch if you want a good time.

This particular ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" has a rather ingenious storyline; possibly the most creative in the series. The ""survivors"" of Elm Street are slowly falling victim to Krueger's violent rampage one by one (although the deaths are considered ""suicides"" by the doctors). Only a few remain alive in a psychiatric ward and they all have similar nightmares. They all dream of a man who is horribly scarred and wears a glove with razor blades for fingers. And they know that he is out to get them. However, these aren't your typical survivors. They have special powers and gifts in their dream world that makes them unique and powerful. These gifts and powers may be the only thing that can stop Freddy once and for all, before he murders each and every one of them.

This one was actually co-written by Wes Craven, the man behind the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" It really shows because this one isn't as funny as the later ones. It's more creepy and scary, too. The movie was very well-directed and written. The actors were great and each of them really made the movie work. And of course, you have to give credit to Robert Englund, who really shines as Freddy. There is no way anybody else could play the part. Englund practically made the role his own.

The DVD doesn't have much to offer, but it does look and sound great. No more having to deal with the mono VHS copy that was recorded in ""extended play."" The picture is crystal clear, and even a little TOO clear at parts. The new Dolby Digital mix is also really good. You do have the option to listen to it in mono, which is the original theatrical mix. Other than that, no eye-popping extras.

""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" is a Freddy movie to remember. Not only is it scary and even funny at times, but it's also very creative and impressive. I'm a fan of all the Freddy flicks, but this one is probably my favourite of them all. This is something recommended for ALL horror-buffs. Then again, all of you horror-buffs have already seen it, now haven't you? Well, then to the rest of you... check it out when you can!",1150156800,5,2514,4.5553097345132745

It's cool to see Freddy morph into things like the hot blonde nurse, a T.V. creature thing, and a giant worm(not a snake, OKAY? Snakes aren't slimy, I know, I own 2. Actually, according to the Nightmare encyclopedia, the giant worm was originally going to be a...well..a giant d**k!). We also get to see Heather Langencamp back as Nancy, and hotter than ever. Patricia Arquette does a good job acting as Kristin(Who was played by Tuesday Night in N4 for some reason). It defiantely has some good graphics for the year in it, like the floating door, the magic sparks the crippled boy does with his dream power(I can't remember his name). It's cool to see Freddy control the guy obsessed with puppets like he was a puppet-truly a highlight of the film. After N3, the Nightmare series did sort of go underhill from there. N4 was okay, N5 was..decent, N6? I'm not even going to comment on N6! Wes Craven's New Nightmare saved from Freddy not ending with a bang, and it proved that Wes Craven truly is the master of horror and that he does know his own creation better than anyone else. I certainly can't forget Robert England's superb acting, and noone could ever play Freddy better than him. If you want to see a great movie that may not scare you, but will certainly entertain you, then buy N3 Dream Warriors now. Watch the kids at a sleeping disoreders hospital battle Freddy in their dreams and-as if you hadn't already guessed-fail at doing so.",1139356800,,1598,4.610526315789474

Cast:  Heather Langenkamp, Craig Wasson, Patricia Arquette, Robert Englund, Ken Sagoes, Rodney Eastman, Jennifer Rubin, Laurence Fishburne, John Saxon, Bradley Gregg, Priscilla Pointer.

Running Time:  96 minutes

Rated R for violence, gore, language, and some nudity.

""Dream Warriors"", the third in the seemingly endless ""Elm Street"" series, returns to the ideas and themes of the first film, which is sure to make the fans of the original happy, as ""Part 2: Freddy's Revenge"" is far from being the most popular in the series.  ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3"" is not a bad installment by any means, and there are some magnificent visual ideas throughout, but it's let down by some wooden acting and an unexciting script. Heather Langenkamp isn't a great actress, but she was a good heroine in the first film. Here, as Nancy, she's a little extraneous, and doesn't have much to do except let the new victims know what's in store for them. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" follows the similar formula of the previous films, as a terrified teen named Kristen (Patricia Arquette) is being stalked by a killer in her dreams by the name of Freddy (Robert Englund).  She wakes up without knowing that she slits her wrist and her family decides to send her to a mental hospital for troubled teens. When a new young psychiatrist specializing in Dream Therapy is by the name of Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp).  When Nancy finds out that Freddy stills haunt the frighten teens and knowing what Kristen is talking about. Most of the teens are now dreaming about the killer in their sleep. Nancy and Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) are helping the teens to fight Freddy back with their dream powers and their help.

Once the action moves to the hospital, we're introduced to 'the last of the Elm Street children'. As the original told us, Freddy was killed by a vengeful group of parents who were horrified that this murderer was released from his impending jail sentence on a technicality. Freddy now seeks vengeance by killing the children of those who burned him alive. Here we have a nerd in a wheelchair, a wannabe actress, an ex-drug addict, a sleepwalker, a mute and a cocky sort who always ends up in the quiet room. More or less all of them won't make it to the end, and instead of setting up what could have been a terrifying atmosphere as these kids try to convince those in charge that their 'delusions' are actually real, debut director Chuck Russell throws in big set piece after set piece. Clearly the budget has been upped for Part 3, and the special effects are pretty cool. The dream sequences are also imaginative, especially whenever Kristen is trapped in the old Elm Street house, or when Nancy leads the remaining patients down into Freddy's hellish dungeon. Best of all is a really sinister, very painful-looking scene where one of the victims is turned into what can only be best compared to as a puppet on a string. The last twenty minutes really see the film come alive, featuring a good fight sequence in an abandoned scrap yard.  The music by David Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti has its creepy moments, though the heavy metal cuts by poodle-haired rockers Dokken are the epitome of cheese. The acting is a big problem here: aside from Langenkamp's stilted acting, Craig Wasson is dull as the doctor who takes unorthodox measures to try and help the kids. Patricia Arquette is a bland heroine and the other kids don't have much to do, though when they enter the dream world, a couple of them get to have some cool superpowers. Larry (not Laurence) Fishburne gets an early role as an orderly, and effortlessly out acts nearly everyone in the film. Robert Englund as Freddy has become a full-fledged pantomime villain now, getting a snappy one-liner for every victim he devours. Though not as bad as later chapters like ""The Dream Child"", it's difficult to care much about the characters and the direction lacks energy and spark, yet the film does provide diverting amusement for an hour and a half, and there are some individual great scenes.",1137715200,3,4106,4.80028328611898
34388,5,0780630866,"Nancy Thompson is back. This time as a dream therapist. The last of the Elm Street kids are being held at Westin Hills, a psychiatric hospital. The doctors think the kids are sucidial and crazy, but Nancy and Dr. Neil Gordon work together to help the kids overcome their nightmares and beat Freddy!

This is such a relief, because the sequel was such a disappoinment. Not only to have Heather Langenkamp & John Saxon from the original, there is a very promising cast including Laurence Fishburne, Patricia Arquette, Craig Wasson, Jennifer Rubin, Rodney Eastman, Ken Sagoes, Bradley Gregg, Pricilla Pointer, Penelope Sudrow, and Ira Heiden.

34389,5,0780630866,"There are a lotta things to like about this film- first, Nancy from part one is back. Second, the acting is actually quite good, particularly Patricia Arquette, Larry Fishbourne, Craig Wasson, Priscilla Pointer, and of course Robert Englund as Freddy. However, Heather Langenkamp gives what can only be described as a schizoid performance- her scenes with Craig Wasson are awkward and laughable, but when she's confronting Freddy or trying to save the kids from being tongued to death (you gotta see it to believe it!) she delivers a knockout and believable performance. Third, the directing is top notch and exciting. Fourth, the ways in which Freddy kills his victims are undeniably clever and fiendish- my personal favorites include the puppeteer and the girl who wants to be on TV. Gross but very clever and creative. Fifth, they take a plot that is basic but timeless- none of the adults understand what the kids are going through- and take it to a whole new level. Watching these kids band together to protect each other is surprisingly moving. My only disappointment is that there's no audio commentary from anyone. I would have loved to have learned more about the making of this film, as I understand that it was made on a very tight schedule with lots of rewrites and hard feelings because Wes Craven wasn't allowed to direct, resulting in a tense shoot. Would have been interesting to learn what Craven would have done differently if he had directed.",1127692800,2,1461,4.895161290322581

34401,5,0780630866,"In 1987, director Chuck Russell had brought us, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS.

  KRISTEN PARKER (played by Patricia Arquette) has been having horrifying nightmares about FREDDY KRUEGER (again played by Robert Englund). Kristen lives on Elm Street and is one of the children, whose mother, ELAINE PARKER (played by Brooke Bundy), was involved with burning Freddy alive. She sits up one night and is seen building something. But what? We don't know. Her mother walks in and puts her to bed. What Kristen is building is a house. The house at...1428 Elm Street, Nancy's house. Kristen has another nightmare, but she seems to have awoken without fight Freddy. She goes into the bathroom to do her...business. But the knobs on the sink grab her and slashes her wrists.

  At the Springwood Hospital, DR. NEIL GORDON (played by Craig Wasson) deals with the remaining children of Elm Street, whose parents were all involved in the murder of Freddy Krueger. Amongst those teens are WILL STANTON (played by Ira Heiden), JENNIFER CAULFIELD (played by Penelope Sudrow), TARYN WHITE (played by Jennifer Rubin), PHILLIP ANDERSON (played by Bradley Gregg), ROLAND KINCAID (played by Ken Sagoes), & JOEY CRUSEL (played by Rodney Eastman).

  DR. ELIZABETH SIMMS (played by Priscilla Pointer) is the head of this group, with Neil as her assistant. Dr. Simms has hired a new staff member, who seems to be real successful in pattern nightmares. As they discuss this, trouble is happening. Kristen has been added to Dr. Simms and Neil's group, but she is flipping out. They try to calm her down, but can't. She is sing the Freddy Krueger rhyme. She seems to have trouble getting out the last line, until a familiar voice finishes it off for Kristen. The voice belongs to...NANCY THOMPSON (again played by Heather Langenkamp). Nancy is the new staff member.

  That night, Kristen falls asleep and has another nightmare. She calls out Nancy's name. For some oddball reason, Nancy actually hears Kristen's voice. Nancy falls asleep and finds herself in Kristen's nightmare, where she saves Kristen and realizes that Freddy is back and ready to kill. She has Kristen wake them both up.

  The next morning, Nancy talks to Kristen about how she did what she did and how Nancy is so amazed by it. Which leads Nancy into having her first group therapy with the rest of the kids. That night, Phillip has a nightmare of Freddy turning him into one of Phillip's marionettes, which is how Phillip meets his demise.

  The next day, the kids discuss in group, but Neil and Dr. Simms seem to think that Phillip committed suicide, just like the others in the past. But we all know that Phillip was not suicidal, but murdered. Neil and Nancy decide that they prescribe Hypnocil for the kids, a dream suppressant for the kids. Dr. Simms, after some persuading, agrees. But that night, Jennifer meets Freddy and her death.

  The next day, Neil and Nancy hold a therapy session with Kristen, Taryn, Will, Joey, and Kincaid, without the authority of Dr. Simms. There, Nancy tells the kids of Freddy and what he wants, which leads her into telling them of Kristen's gift. They try it once, but it doesn't seem to work. Suddenly, something indicates that it did, where Will, supposed to be paralyzed, is actually standing on his feet. The others show off their dream talents, all except Joey, who has been lured into another room by the beautiful nurse,  Marcie. She strips down and begins kissing Joey, until she turns into...Freddy.

  The others are experiencing horrifying events until Dr. Simms interrupts the session. Joey is now in a coma, relieving both Neil and Nancy of their duties at the hospital. Neil, packing up his car, notices someone at the top of the abandoned tower. It is SISTER MARY HELENA (played by Nan Martin). Neil had already met her at Jennifer's funeral, where she was in the middle of telling him how to kill Freddy once and for all. He runs up to the tower, where Sister Mary Helena is. She continues her story on how to kill Freddy. She reveals that a young woman worked in the tower, the criminally insane ward, that would be. She was locked inside with the 100 inmates over the holidays. They had raped her thousands of times. When the staff came back after the holidays, the woman was barely alive and pregnant. The woman was...Amanda Krueger, Freddy's mother. The way to stop Freddy is to find his remains and bury them in hollow ground.

  Nancy knows one person who knows where the remains are...LT. DONALD THOMPSON (again played by John Saxon). He refuses to tell her. At that moment, Neil gets a page from Taryn. He calls Taryn and finds out that Kristen flipped out, where Dr. Simms doped her up and put her in the quiet room. Nancy goes to the kids, while Neil gets Lt. Thompson to drive him to the remains of Freddy.

  At the hospital, Nancy is not permitted to see Kristen. She gets to the others, where they go into the dream with Kristen. They all get separated. Will and Taryn are killed off, leaving Nancy with Kristen and Kincaid. They find Joey and Freddy. They save Joey, and are now after Freddy, since they can't wake up, with Kristen being sedated. Nancy then sees her father. Her father had been killed by Freddy's remains. She hugs him, but she feels someone stabbing her in the stomach. Freddy had imitated her father to kill her off, but not before she grabs his arm and shoves the knives very deep into his stomach. At that moment, Neil buries the remains, pours Holy water and a Crucifix on top. Freddy has died, yet, again.

  Much better than the second film, even though, the second film was a worthy follow-up. By this film, Freddy started to become more comical than horrifying. You'll notice that as the films progress.",1117670400,2,5762,4.729
34402,5,0780630866,"Dream Warriors brings back exactly what Freddy's Revenge lacked. Actual Elm Street kids as in kids of the parents who torched Freddy; Imaginative dream sequences; Characters with some depth and relationships worth caring about; and Heather Langenkamp.

 Dream Warriors is a perfect example of what I wish every Nightmare movie could have been about. Freddy takes each kid's own weakness and uses it against them. In later sequels, these sort of things are hinted at or underused. In Dream Warriors, the weaknesses of the kids gave the kids character and depth. And this gave Freddy more character too. I'm not generally saying all the kids gave great acting. The better performances come from Patricia Arquette (the girl can scream) and Jennifer Rubin (""In my dreams, I'm beautiful ... and baaad."")

 Chuck Russel captures a very unique atmosphere in Dream Warriors. Subtle blues and blatant reds are used a lot and sets the tone of the film very well. The dream sequences are the best here: the freddy snake, the puppet boy, Taryn's nightmare, and the first use of the Elm Street house in it's dream-state.

 On my list of best to worst Elm Streets, Dream Warriors sits at #2 right after New Nightmare. It has what the original Nightmare had, has more, and it has what the following sequels tried to capitalize on but didn't do as well.

 The DVD is much like most of the Nightmare. Simple, widescreen, trailer, that's all. But this one is worth the simple disc.",1117584000,2,1463,4.824

WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: ""Nightmare"" creator Wes Craven returned for this third Freddy feature and brought with him an intelligent, enjoyable story. Springwood teenagers are now being institutionalized because of their bad dreams, yet the scientists meant to protect them are only doing them more harm by not realizing the cause of their problem. But when new assistant Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp, another returnee from the original film) enters their lives, she begins to help them make sense of their monster. In turn, each of the teenagers uncovers their own unique ""dream power"" to aid in combating Freddy. Taryn (Jennifer Rubin) is a recovering junkie who becomes a beautiful and bad switchblade punk. Will (Ira Heiden) is a soft-spoken paraplegic who becomes the Wizard Master. Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) is a loud-mouthed, hot-tempered teen who becomes a super strong bastion for the group. Joey (Rodney Eastman) is a sweet mute who uncovers a hidden vocal talent. Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette) is the innocent newcomer to the group who displays extraordinary acrobatic skills and also possesses the ability to bring other people into her dreams. Together, alongside scientist Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson) they try to end the killing spree of the maniacal Freddy Krueger once and for all. They are also aided in their efforts by the mysterious Sister Mary Helena (Nan Martin) who helps push Neil in the right direction to save his suffering patients and Nancy's father Donald (John Saxon, demoted from police lieutenant to some form of local security guard) who sheds some light on Krueger's mortal past. This was also the film that introduced dream suppressant Hypnocil...remember that name, as seventeen years later it would be used again in the ""Freddy vs. Jason"" spin-off. This was also the first film to establish the fact that the souls of Freddy's victims gave him more power in his quest to invade teenagers' nightmares. Director Chuck Russell keeps the suspense at a decorous pace for this film while new score composer Angelo Badalamenti brings new depth to the musical background. Unlike Christopher Young (""Nightmare 2""), Badalamenti remained faithful to his source material and even included touches of Charles Bernstein's haunting original score in this presentation. Death scenes have become more over the top than they were in previous ""Nightmare"" entries and the cast itself has become a more cohesive unit. Only Patricia Arquette seems unsure of her acting abilities, coming off as awkward and stiff when she interacts with her fellow cast mates. Robert Englund, on the other hand, has grown in his portrayal of Freddy Krueger. Unlike ""Nightmare 2"" where he basically sleepwalked through his performance, he sinks his teeth into the role and thoroughly enjoys himself. Trivia buffs take note of two occurrences in this film. First, the priest (Jack Shea) who presides over the funeral in this film is the same one who did the honors for Tina Gray's funeral in the original ""Nightmare"". Secondly, the streak of white hair on Nancy's head has miraculously moved. When she received the silver streak in the first movie, it was on the left side of her head. In this film, it has magically transported itself over to the right side of her head. Overall, this is a winning horror film that delivers the chills, thrills and spectacle terror fans crave.

THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: There is a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation of this film which is relatively clean and free of grain. The appearance is properly dark and subdued and there's more precision and lucidity than there was in ""Nightmare 2"". Even the stop motion skeleton looks less fraudulent than it did on any existing video print of the film. The 5.1 surround sound is also a drastic step up from its predecessor. Back are the freak out, fairly multi-directional effects and intense resonance of the first entry in the series, although back speakers are not utilized to their fullest extent until the finale of the film. This disc also includes the original mono audio track for the film and easy to read English subtitles which are placed within the frame of the film. This disc arrives in another paper case from New Line and it features a miniaturized version of the original theatrical poster on its cover. The rest of the case is devoid of any artwork, however the inside spotlights the list of special features and the thirty-one chapter stops that make up this hour and a half long movie. The DVD itself has been painted with a photograph of Freddy Krueger extending his razor-gloved hand in the hallway where the ""wheelchair from hell"" sequence would take place. Special features on this disc include the now obligatory ""Jump to a Nightmare"" option. The extensive cast and crew information section was taken from the original theatrical press kit for the movie and is a remarkable improvement over the section featured on the ""Nightmare 2"" DVD. DVD-ROM users also have access to an interactive screenplay for the film, the third ""Dream World"" trivia game and up-to-the-minute weblinks.

THE YOLK'S ON YOU: New Line Cinema has packed their boxed set so well that they don't need to place hidden easter eggs on the separate discs. You're more likely to find a way out of the locked ""quiet room"" than you are of finding easter eggs on this one.

THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: Joey (Rodney Eastman) is seduced by sexy nurse Marcie (Stacey Alden) who bares her breasts and wears a pair of slinky white thong panties. That's the only moment of sexuality in the entire production.

THE GORE REPORT: Early on in the film, Freddy turns luckless Phillip (Bradley Gregg) into a bloody walking puppet using Phillip's own tendons as marionette strings. Later, Kristen Parker's mother Elaine (Brooke Bundy) has her head chopped off by Freddy in one of Kristen's dream sequences.

SAY AGAIN: ""In the name of Lowrek, Prince of Elves, demon begone!"" - Will (Ira Heiden). ""Sorry, kid. I don't believe in fairy tales."" - Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund).

THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this DVD. Even without being a part of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street Collection"" boxed set, this is still an essential entry into horror history. After the failure of the first sequel, this is a refreshing reversion back to the psychological terror and revisionist humor that made the original film so popular.

34404,5,0780630866,"This sequel is the best in so many ways, great special effects, very good, creative storyline, and interesting characters. The film is much better than the disappointing first sequel, Freddy's Revenge. Although the dark, terrifying Freddy from the first two gone, he makes up for it with very creative deaths, and one-liners before every kill. Also this film is quite fast paced and has stop motion photography; Freddy does not stop all is this one. This film has many cool, yet horrific scenes in it, including the claymation Freddy scene. The deaths in this film are so cool, and very creative. The scene where this girl is watching television, and gets her head eventually smashed into to the tv by Freddy, is an very terrifying, and well as creative death scene in the movie. Also the scene where Phillips is turn into a puppet using strings made out of his blood and arteries, was the best death scene in the movie.

 Picking up where the original Nightmare left off, Nancy has grown up and become a psychiatrist specializing in dream therapy. She meets a group of children at a local hospital facing Freddy Krueger, the same demon she once encountered in her sleep. One of them is Kristen, who has the power to draw other people into her dreams. Working with a male doctor assigned to the case, Nancy helps the kids realize their special abilities within the nightmare world. When Freddy captures one of her charges, she leads a rescue attempt into Krueger's domain, in hopes of putting his spirit to rest once and for all.

 This film is different from the first two Elm Street in the fact, that it is not a personal story, but rather about several different teens, with different personalites and characteristics, who are all being tormented in their dream by the infamous Freddy Kreuger, all of the teens are helpless against the demonic dream stalker, until the heroine and main character of the first NOES film Nancy Thompson comes by to visit. Nancy Thompson is now a dream researcher, and has come to help the struggling teens, who are threatened by Mr. Kreuger in their dreams. She tells the teens to be Dream Warriors, and fight back against Krueger or ingage in dream combat. Although the teens do fight back, they don't work as team, and are slaughtered one by one by Freddy Krueger, in very evil and imaginative ways. The teens learn they all have different powers in the dream world, and they use it to fight Krueger.  Although the film does have incredible special effects, and awesome death sequences, the film was made with still quite a small budget ,only an estimated 4 million dollars. Even Nancy Thompson herself is killed in this film, by Freddy pretending to be her father.

 This film is an 80's classic, and definitely the best sequel of the nightmare films, it has most of the darkness and eerieness of the first film, and comical elements that made the sequels after it after it great, including the one-liners, and the imaginative dream death sequences. This film racked almost or nearly close to 50 million dollars, and is the most successful elm street sequel. Freddy gained permanent cinema icon status after this film, and gained millions of new fans around the world. Buy this film on DVD or VHS if you like, it's definitely the best elm street film, and it has quite a bit more special features than other two Elm Street films. The picture of this film was excellent, and actually really that grainy, and you have a choice between Dolby 3.1 or Surround Sound, and one thing makes this film so much more excellent, is that finally get to learn a lot more about Freddy's origins, like the fact he was the Bastard son of hundred maniacs, and that his mother got accidently raped in an asylum and so much more. Dream Warriors revived the Nightmare after the somewhat pathetic Freddy's Revenge. This film is spectacular on DVD, and is definitely must a see, go buy or rent this film now, or DVD or VHS, it's an 80's classic, and the best Freddy film ever, you will enjoy it.",1115856000,,4008,4.676595744680851

God, if Fishburne agreed to be in it, it's got to have something going for it. The whole 'dream warrior' angle is a bit childish for a horror flick but it's still all good.

They must all go into the same dream to fight off Freddy with the help of Nancy Thompson. Definitely the best NOES sequel, besides ""New Nightmare"".",1114905600,,301,4.592592592592593
34407,4,0780630866,"After the lame attempt to make Freddy possess a teen in the second of this venerable series, producer Robert Shaye wisely got Wes Craven more involved in this third and very good film.  Shaye got Wes Craven and Frank Darabont (Green Mile, Shawshank Redemption) to work on the script and hired Child's Play director Chuck Russell to direct, with the results far superior to the second and almost as good as the first.

This time around, Freddy is inhabiting the remaining Elm Street's dreams and killing them in ways that make it appear like suicide.  One failed attempt (a young Patricia Arquette) is sent to a mental insitution by her apathetic mother (the still lovely Brooke Bundy) whereupon she meets other teens who are experiencing the same frightening dreams.  Staffed by a caring young doctor (Craig Wasson from Ghost Story and Body Double), and a stuffy old bat (Priscilla Pointer from the original Carrie), not to mention a young Laurence Fishburne as an orderly, the kids aren't really getting any better.  Enter a young intern who just happens to be the heroine of the first movie, Nancy Thompson (again played with her innocent naievete by Heather Langenkamp)who knows why the kids are having the terrible nightmares.  John Saxon returns in a cameo as Heather's now alcoholic father cop.  The other teens include Jennifer Rubin as the drug-addled teen.

Dream Warriors is a dark entry and Robert Englund is starting to get more screen time as Freddy, and coming up with his infamously funny one liners.  He is still one of the best screen monsters of all time, and it's to Englund's credit he continues to make Freddy frightening.  Some great sequences in this one, including the puppeteer death; the t.v. spot with Dick Cavett and Zsa Zsa Gabor; and the spooky sequence in the abandoned car lot.  The ending of course left space for another sequel, which of course we got.  This one is one of the best in the series, though.",1113091200,,1938,4.804216867469879
34408,5,0780630866,"While renting this movie I had little expectations that this movie would even come close to matching the original movie.  How wrong I was.

  This movie portrays the last of the Elm Street children(who's parents killed Freddy in a mob years before)  have been put into a mental hospital for various sleeping disorders.  Nancy(the original hero) comes back to the Springwood as a grad student.  However during there times there at the hospital Freddy knocks them off one by one until Nancy leads an all out attack on Freddy in their dreams.

  Very well acted and the visual effects are just awe-inspiring for sure.  This movie is one of the few sequels that equals or surpasses the original movie in everyway.",1112313600,,709,4.776859504132231
34419,5,0780630866,"Freddy's back and ready to tear his knives into a new group of Elm Street teens. This time, his next victim is Kristen Parker. While trying to kill her, Freddy makes it look like a suicide attempt and Kristen is thrown into Springwoods' Mental Insitution. There she discovers more teens who are plagued by the same horrifying nightmares she is. Helpless as they seem because the doctors refuse to believe that they are trying to be killed by this 'Boogeyman,' They have help on thier side from the new staff member, Nancy Thompson. The heroine from the first movie returns to help a new group of teens to combat Freddy Krueger. By tapping into thier dream powers, the teenagers become 'The Dream Warriors.' Now with thier new found dream skills, the troubled teens must battle this Dream-Stalker on his own hellish turf. Nancy and her convinced collegue Neil Gordon must do all within in thier power to help thier patients survive, even if it means using an experimental dream surpresent drug called 'Hypnocil' on them, if they can. Only few will make it out of this nightmare.

This is the best sequel in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. The script and diolouge were well thought out and planned to create something worthy of a great sequel, unlike Freddys' Revenge.
This time around, Nancy Thompson returns, played once again by the fantastic Heather Langenkamp. The movie also stars Patricia Arquette in her first role who does a very good job playing Kristen. While watching this movie you'll realise that some of the teenagers' 'dream powers' can be rather annoying, mostly 'The Wizard Master.'
The movie has a good plotline which goes at a reasonable, steady pace. 'The March of the Bloody Puppet' was one of the best and goriest deaths ever in a horror movie, it actually looked pretty real and disgusting, considering the year that the film was made.
The soundtrack is pretty good, featuring an awsome 80's song called 'Dream Warriors' preformed by Dokken.

Most notably the song BACK FOR THE ATTACK by DOKKEN had been removed and replaced by some generic metal guitar. The DVD release of this film is the original theatrical edit and restores the missing DOKKEN song. Thanks Robert Shaye!
About the plot; basically a great film, but.....  What's with the ""hypnocil"" subplot. Very inconsistant. Nancy apparently cannot dream because of this drug. So, how does Kristin pull her into the dream with the snake?
Later, Nancy suggests that the kids should be put on Hypnocil. Neil agrees and (after some convincing) so does Dr. Simms.  They hope to get some by the next morning.  Next, we see Jennifer get killed by Freddy and her subsequent funeral. Several days must have passed. After the funeral Nancy convinces Neil that the kids should enter the dream as a group.  What happened to the hypnocil? Obviously they are not taking it because they have no problem dreaming. And strangly  neither does Nancy, who has been taking it for a long time. When did she stop taking it? And if she has, why hasen't Freddy come after her.
Anyway, after the kids are trapped in a giant boiler in the dream world,
Joey is in an (apparent) coma. (it cant be a real coma because you don't dream in a coma).  The administrator of the clinic blames the coma on the exparimental drug Hypnocil.  Which Joey apparently never even took.  Maddening!!!! My head is going to explode (just like Jennifers)!!!!
Then, once again, Nancy and the kids enter the dream, together. No problems.  I am convinced that there is no such thing as ""hypnocil"",
The jar that fell out of Nancys purse, and was examined by Neil, contained Good and Plenty or something. (Also, I bet Nancy is glad she didn't drop her credit cards or her vibrator with nosey Neil around)",1107648000,3,1900,4.675675675675675

I just like it for the DoKKen song at the end.

I am a big DoKKen fan.

So actually, this review really is not about the movie at all, but just about the awesome band that made the title song.

Who cares about the movie.  Fast forward through the movie just to watch the ending music video.

DoKKen was much cooler than Freddy ever was.

DoKKen was one of the very few 80's bands that were not commerical hair fluff/Pop Metal at all, but were actually a breath away from being Helloween/Iron MAIDEN Power Metal.

Just get it the movie just for the DoKKen song.

Although, this is the first movie in the Freddy Series where people started to fight back against him instead of being helplessly slaughtered.

If you like the DoKKen song, then get the ""Back for the Attack"" CD from DoKKen, that ""Dream Warriors"" is the last song on.  Not to mention that there is not a bad song on that entire CD at all.

Also check out the ""Tooth and Nail"" and ""Beast from the East"" CDs as well from DoKKen.  Those 2 other CDs are equally just as good as the ""Back for the Attack"" CD is.

Actually, for anyone who is going through or who has gone through a relationship breakup either currently or in the past; 3/4ths of ALL of DoKKen's songs talk about breakups and how to get over a bad breakup.  It worked for me, and I am sure it can work for someone else too.

By the time ""Dream Warriors"" commences, Krueger is no longer limited to haunting a small handful of targets at a time; his razor-clawed grip has extended beyond Elm Street and all over town, invading the dreams of more and more victims.  The film's main setting is a hospital where a number of his objects of torment are institutionalized because of their dream-based 'delusions'.  Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) from the first Nightmare, now a medical professional specializing in dreams, is brought back into the fray to prepare the surviving victims to take the battle to Freddy on his own territory, the realm of dream.

  Featuring the best special effects of the series up to this point and some truly legendary horror sequences, including the famous 'puppet' scene to name but one, and delving further into Freddy's hideous origin, ""A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" is among the better in a hellaciously good series.

In this film, Freddy returns with his sights on killing the remaining kids of Elm Street who are all in a mental ward....oh gee I wonder why? Also, Nancy (from the first film) makes a reprise in this film. In my opinion, this film should have been the second one and the second film should have been the third, but one must realize that this was probably a casting problem or maybe she couldn't do it....hmmmmm.

One of the unique qualities about this film is that it's the beginning of where Freddy starts to kill his victims in unusual ways. It also marks the beginning of Freddy as ""King of the One liners."" What's really disturbing besides Freddy are these kids. I mean they are strange, mentally-ill rejects, which with the help of a doctor and Nancy they will all unlock powers to help them battle Freddy in the dreamworld.

34440,5,0780630866,"This movie really should have been the sequel to the first movie, and realistically speaking, if you try to forget that Part II exists it can sneak in without ruining any plotline!  This movie returned us to the twisted reality that is Freddy's dream world and makes us fear sleep yet again, only this time it takes it up a notch!

Kristen is having dreams about a house, a bad dream house that seems to suck her into it and bring out a man we've all come to know is Freddy Kruger.  When she attempts suicide (which was really Freddy's doing) she is committed to a local hospital where all the kids seem to be having the same bad dreams.  The only thing worse than feeling unprotected in your dreams is knowing that your parents think you're crazy so they ignore you!  Nancy returns, now as a psychotherapist specializing in dream therapy, but really only to protect the kids from Freddy Kruger.  Freddy has decided to play dirty and now that the kids are all starting to die off, the staff of the hospital are blaming the new therapies from Nancy as the culpret.  Can Nancy stop the killing before Kristen and the other kids die from their own therapy?

This movie had it all.  It returned us to the world of Freddy Kruger that was so creepy from the first movie, only they made it bigger, better, and scarier!  The cast is much larger than the original and for a bunch of kids, the acting is quite good.  You may notice such favorites as Heather Langenkamp (Nancy), Patricia Arquette (Kristen), Robert England (Freddy), and even Lawrence Fishburne (Max)!  What was even better about this film is that it didn't hesitate to get a little more gory this time around (especially with the first victim!).  It also explored dream manipulation to make the kids stronger against Freddy (which was inventive and made the kids seem more like kids).  There's even a side storyline that includes some KILLER stop motion.

The DVD is cleaned up and in Widescreen, although by the third film it's to be expected.  I'm glad to see that this film was in Dolby 5.1, it seems New Line doesn't just take it's best seller and re-mix it, it'll go all out for every member in the series!  The ""Jump To A Death"" feature was much more used in this film as the deaths are pretty drawn out and all quite impressive (from the gory in real life to the mystical dream warrior deaths).

34446,5,0780630866,"Excluding the first, this is definitely the best Freddy sequel. It is lighter hearted than the first two, but it doesn't let Freddy's wise-cracking antics get over the top.
  The story concerns a group of teenagers who are all patients at an asylum. Later on we also learn that they are the last children left of the parents who murdered Freddy. Basically the film is about him (Freddy) picking all of them off one by one.
  This is the one that really paves the way for Freddy's character to cease to be dark and become quite funny. He's not in the shadows no more and he's starting to pull jokes rather than snarl. You would think that this would put the film in quite a negative light, but it doesn't. This factor makes the film more fun. Sure, it's got a few scary moments but it's also jam-packed with humour.
  The acting is actually quite good, too. Much better than the first two. I know that not many people watch slasher films for the acting, but if it's good it does help greatly. Also, unlike other horror movies, you actually care for these teenagers and especially the Doctor who's in charge of them all. That's why you feel a little sorry for them when they bite the dust.
  And talking of the deaths, they'll all great. Like Freddy's character, this is the one that paved the way for the deaths to become a little more elaborate. The 'puppet' death, the 'T.V.' death. They'll all great.
  Also, like its predecessors, this film is full of good imagery. Freddy transforming into a giant worm, a moving skeleton. Visually the film is quite good.

This one has it's share of silliness that would be amplified in later movies, but it's actually very good.  More elaborate FX were starting to get used at this point, such as Freddy as a marionette, and as a giant worm.  Quick plot synopsis for those unfamiliar:  The remaining Elm St. kids are all locked away in a psych ward, tormented by Freddy dreams.  Naturally the doctors don't buy into this Freddy thing all until Nancy Thompson from the original film shows up.  She's now a doctor herself, and manages to convince a fellow psychiatrist(Craig Wasson, a horribly underused actor) of what's going on.  The kids get in touch with their dream powers(thus the title Dream Warriors) and go off to do battle with Freddy.  The Dream Warriors concept is kinda corny(the whole ""I am the wizard master"" thing will make you cringe), but it's all in good fun.  Nancy's father(the underrated John Saxon) also makes a cool appearance.  Honestly, this series should have ended here.  Freddy's demise here is actually pretty final and more films weren't needed-it could have ended here.

34449,5,0780630866,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge was an interesting film that took viewers down a dead end street, but A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors basically saved the movie franchise by not only putting it back on its proper footing but also building upon and improving the impressive strengths of the original film.  The storyline is strong, putting Freddy back where he belongs - inside the nightmares of the remaining children of the Elm Street vigilantes responsible for his fiery death.  Heather Langenkamp's return in the role of Nancy Thompson provides a crucial link between the original and this, its true sequel.  Freddy's character is expanded not only in terms of his history but also in terms of his character and engaging personality.  The acerbically witty Freddy we all know and love truly comes to the fore for the first time, and he now takes more time with his victims in order to truly enjoy his work.  The blessings of a larger budget also pay huge dividends here, making Freddy's little hobby especially fun to watch.  A little camp comes along in the process here and there, but Freddy himself is truly on top of his game.
Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) is now a graduate student pursuing research on nightmare therapy, and she returns to Springwood in order to join the staff at the local mental health institution.  Some half dozen teenagers from Elm Street are being treated at the facility, each of them suffering from nightmares that are all too familiar to Nancy.  One young lady in particular (Kristen, played by Patricia Arquette) has the remarkable ability to pull someone else into her dreams, and this ultimately becomes the basis of Nancy's plan to stop Freddy from killing the surviving kids.  Convincing her superiors at the hospital that the dreams they scoff at are actually real is about as hard as fighting Freddy himself, so of course a few souls are bound to die (in some truly delightful ways) before the action plays out.  On top of all this, we also come to learn the tragic story of Freddy's birth and get a close-up look at the source of his amazing strength.
Freddy has some great scenes and some great lines in this film.  The big sleepwalking death scene is probably my favorite Freddy kill of all-time; Freddy first takes the form of a gnarly little puppet before doing some mighty impressive ""string"" pulling of his own.  You also have the gigantic Freddy snake trying to swallow a victim in one gulp, some impressive claw work, a really cool ten ""finger"" goodbye for one special victim, and many other great Freddy moments.  Some of the kids are rather annoying, and the ""dream powers"" they discover in themselves can be rather silly (especially those of the ""wizard master""), but one tough guy in particular has some of the best anti-Freddy lines in the whole Nightmare series.  The big shovel fight toward the end, featuring a skeletal version of Freddy, is also a joy to watch.  While the special effects may not look perfectly convincing to modern viewers, this fantastic scene was quite impressive for its time.
A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors is arguably the best film in the series, and it really sets the tone for the cinematic future of the unparalleled, thoroughly enjoyable Mr. Krueger.  Killing isn't just a business or hobby for Fred by this point in his career; it's something he really enjoys, and it is truly a delight to watch him do his thing.  A commentary of the film would have been a nice addition to the DVD, but this movie is more than capable of brandishing my five-star rating all on its own.",1074470400,5,3602,4.7376
34450,5,0780630866,"The original ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" is undoubtedly one of the top ten greatest horror movies of all time, and it instantly became a worldwide phenomenon upon it's release.  Thus, it would be very difficult to make another Nightmare film that was equally good.  But this one is.
First of all, I don't see why so many people dislike part 2, I loved it and I thought it was just as scary as the first.  But like many of the other reviewers said - part 3 is the TRUE sequel.  The main reason is because Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon reprise their roles as Nancy and her father from the original.  We also get to learn more about Freddy's past and we even get to meet his mother.
The remaining Elm street children are all thrown together in a psychiatric ward due to their disturbing nightmares.  Of course, the staff just assumes that they're all suicidal and crazy.  That is, until Nancy, now a specialist in dream therapy, comes to their aid.  Only she knows the horrifying secret of their nightmares, the nefarious Fred Krueger (I liked it better when they called him Fred, ""Freddy"" just sounds so cliched now).
Despite what many people seem to think, Krueger is not 'funny' in this movie.  He has a couple of witty one-liners, but he's still unspeakably evil and his presence is as frightening as ever.  Eventually, the head of the staff has a fateful encounter with Fred's mother, a mysterious nun who tells him the secret of how to kill her wicked son.  But it won't be so easy!
After two of the teens are killed, the remainder of the group comes to find out that they have special powers in their dreams.  But we soon realize that these powers are still not enough to stop the King Of Nightmares.  I won't say anymore, I'll just let you see it for yourself.
Greatest scenes:
1.)The puppet scene (very freaky and scary)
2.)The scene where Freddy invades the TV and gives Jennifer a fatal close-up of the screen (out of this world)
3.)The Freddy snake (wow)
4.)The scene where the nurse shows us her breasts (okay, I just threw in this one for fun)
And there's more where those came from.  See this movie now!",1072915200,3,2117,4.493472584856397
34451,4,0780630866,Part three of this great horror series is in my opinion the best sequel in the series. Freddy is still somewhat scary while becoming more outrageous and funny. The story is pretty cool and the acting is pretty good. There are alot of great moments in this movie and some great special effects. I love that they brought the character of nancy back for this one. This movie is well deserving as one of the best in the series and I would recommend this flick to any fan of the series.,1072396800,2,481,4.2967032967032965

I think to keep freddy as popular as he is today they had to make this movie as well as they did or freddy might have slipped into the abyssof 1 movie wonders but this movie saved that from happening. This is where freddy begins to get his witty humour. So if you loved the 1st you will enjoy this sequal!!!",1069891200,,590,4.324324324324325
34463,5,0780630866,"As far as slasher films and slasher sequels go, not to mention 80's slasher films/sequels, this third entry in the mega successful Elm Street series is classy, top of the line stuff. And it holds up well 16 years later. Coming off of the disappointing and fan hated Part 2, this third movie returned the series to it's upstanding roots with a spectacular and fun thrill ride that some fans think of as the real sequel to the brilliant original. The story takes place some years after the events of the original film. A young girl named Kristen Parker(played by Patricia Arquette), is having nightmares of you know who. After trying to kill herself, she ends up in Westin Hills Psychiatric Ward(a place that also figures into the current smash hit, ""Freddy Vs. Jason""). There, Dr. Neil Gordon(Craig Wasson)tries to help her along with a bunch of other troubled teens that we soon get to meet. But it's returning survivor Nancy Thompson(once again played by Heather Langenkamp), that comes thru to the troubled girl. As Nancy comes on board and meets the teens, we learn that they all have been having troubling dreams about Freddy Krueger. Something that Nancy knows all too well. As Nancy and Neil battle the hospital over using a dream supressant drug called Hypnocil(again, something used in F Vs. J), Freddy begins preying on the troubled youths, until they turn on him in the dream world when their biggest wishes, and strengths, come true. Robert Englund returns as Freddy, and he's as brilliant as usual. His Freddy is devilish and sinister in this installment. Much more than the second film. His performance in the new team up movie really harks back to the Freddy in this film. Langenkamp is a pleasure to see. She always represented the best of the Nightmare On Elm Street films, and it's no secret to anyone that her three films are the best. John Saxon also reprises his role as Nancy's father, Lt. Donald Thompson, from the original film. He has a smaller role, but he owns every scene he's in. Wes Craven was credited with  co-writing the story, but he and New Line had a fall out, and the only things in this film from Wes were the idea for Nancy's return and the kids in the hospital. He left the project and the new writers took the outline of that and turned it into their own story. Completely different from Wes', but he still got a writing credit. The film was directed by Chuck Russell, who went on to do ""The Mask"" and ""Eraser"". He does a bang up job here and really photographs every scene very well. The film is sharply put together and tight. The script is solid, clever, intelligent, and incredibly creative. The characters are all fleshed out, three dimensional people with real personalities and traits. You really get to know them and like them, even if you don't in the beginning. The effects are and make-up are teriffic, and the overall mood is sharp. One thing you can always say about the Freddy movies, even if some ones leave much to be desired, is that they are always strongly done, competetly acted, and always have top of the line directors, effects, and make-up. The series' teens, and the ones here in particular, have always been above average horror kids, and the actors have always been better. Some other reviewers didn't seem to get the solidness of the film, and that's too bad. Even ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" co-star Katharine Isabelle made a rather ignorant and clueless remark about the film. Oh well. Their loss. This is a classy addition to the series and makes you forget Part 2 ever happened. The original film, this one, and ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"", are the perfect horror trilogy. The others have good parts, but those three are the ones that matter. Nightmare On Elm Street 3 is about as strong an entry as you can get, and this trip into dreamland is well worth it.",1067817600,4,3823,4.655325443786983

 And even though this movie is one step behind the first film, this is a good movie, if you like horror films you must see this one. ""A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" is easily the best sequel of the series, Freddy's fans won't feel disappointed this time.",1067299200,2,644,4.953703703703703

34468,5,0780630866,"I practically grew up on watching ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies.  Been watching them ever since I was little.  Freddy Krueger is my all-time favorite horror villain.  ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" is probably one of my personal favorites in the series.  It's got a great script, great concept, and it's entertaining as hell.  Both chilling and funny, this is a movie to watch if you want a good time.
This particular ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" has a rather ingenious storyline; possibly the most creative in the series.  The ""survivors"" of Elm Street are slowly falling victim to Krueger's violent rampage one by one (although the deaths are considered ""suicides"" by the doctors).  Only a few remain alive in a psychiatric ward and they all have similar nightmares.  They all dream of a man who is horribly scarred and wears a glove with razor blades for fingers.  And they know that he is out to get them.  However, these aren't your typical survivors.  They have special powers and gifts in their dream world that makes them unique and powerful.  These gifts and powers may be the only thing that can stop Freddy once and for all, before he murders each and every one of them.
This one was actually co-written by Wes Craven, the man behind the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street.""  It really shows because this one isn't as funny as the later ones.  It's more creepy and scary, too.  The movie was very well-directed and written.  The actors were great and each of them really made the movie work.  And of course, you have to give credit to Robert Englund, who really shines as Freddy.  There is no way anybody else could play the part.  Englund practically made the role his own.
The DVD doesn't have much to offer, but it does look and sound great.  No more having to deal with the mono VHS copy that was recorded in ""extended play.""  The picture is crystal clear, and even a little TOO clear at parts.  The new Dolby Digital mix is also really good.  You do have the option to listen to it in mono, which is the original theatrical mix.  Other than that, no eye-popping extras.
""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" is a Freddy movie to remember.  Not only is it scary and even funny at times, but it's also very creative and impressive.  I'm a fan of all the Freddy flicks, but this one is probably my favorite of them all.  This is something recommended for ALL horror-buffs.  Then again, all of you horror-buffs have already seen it, now haven't you?  Well, then to the rest of you... check it out when you can!",1058486400,10,2544,4.541850220264317

This is the first film that made Freddy a staple of Pop culture. Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp, and John Saxton return along with a new face on Elm street, Laurence Fishburne.

Even after watching it many times, I can still get frightened by this (especially when Jennifer gets a real close-up of the TV set).  It has some of the rawness that the original had.
Heather Langenkamp's character Nancy Thompson was brought back in an interesting way, as a counselor to a group of kids in the local teen mental ward, and she helps them to fight Freddy (only 3 of them make it out alive and Nancy isn't one of them).

Here we are introduced to Kristen (Patricia Arquette) who is admitted in a mental institution with other teens who all share the same dreams of being stalked by a familiar razor clawed killer.  An older Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp returning in her role from the original film) is now a dream specialist and she tries to help the kids, and the final solution is to enter the dream world and do something no one else has dared do: beat Freddy at his own game.  Dream Warriors is one of the better installments of the series, and the return of Langenkamp and Craven as a co-writer are reasons why enough, but Russell's great direction helps elevate Dream Warriors above many of the other films in the series.  My only problems are this is where Freddy began to pop out one liners and be funny, and while that is amusing itself for a while, it does get boring and Freddy just doesn't seem as scary after a while.  Also, the film can be a bit cheesy at times, and don't even get me started on the theme song done by Dokken.

A new patient, Kristin Parker (played by Patricia Arquette) arrives and also dreams of a red and green sweatered man with knives for fingers.

A suprise entrance by Nancy Thompson (played by Heather Langenkamp), who has not been seen since Elm Street 1, is a welcomed addition to this movie. Her past with Freddy adds immediate extra excitment to the film when the killer lays eyes on her and whispers only ""... you...""
The film shows off group unity against Freddy instead of the usual kill-off-one-by-one formula. Another first for the series is the deaths become much more spectacular. And Freddy's darkness begins to fade in favor of quip one-liners.

""Sudden Impact"" (the sickest film ever made) makes this film look like a work of Shakespeare!  And rightfully so.  Brilliant Freddy dialogue (""What a rush"" is the best line), great acting by actors and actresses who would later be big stars, great music, and the backdrop of a hospital ward make this film the true masterpiece it remains today.

The teens die off slowly and of course no one believes Nancy about the real reason behind the deaths. This is the first movie where Freddy uses the teenager's weaknesses against them. There are a lot of really elaborate and interesting death scenes and this is where the series got creative without turning Freddy into a comedian. The movie has great cinematograpy, great directing and great acting. If you were a fan of the first one, you will definetly fall in love with nightmare on Elm Street 3.",997488000,,972,4.624277456647399

I was thinking it was just going to be another bad sequel but, on the contrary this movie is good. Robert Englund does once again an outstanding job at being Freddie Kruegger.

34517,5,0780630866,"Nightmare On Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors is one great movie.  Everything that was wrong with Freddy's Revenge (Part 2) has been fixed to create one of the best films of this series, and one of the best horror films ever made.  I'm serious!  This blows stuff like ""The Exorcist"" right out the window.  This is the perfect horror film.  It's scary, funny, has great suspense, good acting, great writing, good cinematography.  Everything!
The film begins with young Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette, in her first movie role) having a horrible nightmare.  She wakes up, and is faced with another nightmare!  In this nightmare, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) cuts her wrists open.  When her mom finds her, it looks as if Kristen was trying to commit suicide.  So, her mother, Elaine (Brooke Bundy) takes her to a hospital full of (supposedly) crazy teens, whom try to commit suicide as well.  As it turns out, they're all dreaming of Mr. Krueger, but all the doctors think they're psychotic.  Dr. Elizibeth Simms (Priscilla Pointer, Carrie) has them sedated to help them sleep well.  However, this causes many deaths, and they keep on coming until Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), survivor of the first film and now a dream specialist, comes to help them.  Dr. Neil Gordan (Craig Wasson, Body Double) takes a liking to her, and so they both try to help out the troubled teens before there are no more troubled teens to help!
This movie's fantastic!  Thanks to a clever script by Frank Darabont (who would later write ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"") and co-written with three others including series creator Wes Craven.  The script's great.  It moves at a good, fast pace, and never slows down a bit (something Part 2 did quite a bit).  Look out for Larry Fishburne (The Matrix) in a small part as Max.  I wish people would stop being so mean to poor Heather Langenkamp and her acting abilities.  I felt she did great with her role.  She simply doesn't have much to do this time around.  I find her a great actress, and it's a shame she didn't make it to many other movies.  Craig Wasson plays the caring doctor well, Priscilla Pointer is great in a part you'll hate and watch out for a cameo on TV by the sci-fi cult horror clasic, Critters, another Robert Shaye film.
Great DVD, as usual.  And, as usual, the extra features are on the bonus disk in the Nightmare Series Encyclopedia in the box set.  This movie does have great picture and sound quality, though!  You get either mono (poo!) or 5.1 surround (now THAT'S what I'm talking about!).  Just switch around the two sounds, you'll definately see the difference!  You also get producton notes, Jump To A Nightmare, a proper widescreen 1:85:1 anamorphic ratio, as well as (unless you get the boxed set) a 1:66:1 standard format.  The only extra NOT in the boxed set is theatrical trailer (it's actually a teaser).  For DVD-Rom you get an easy trivia game as well as an entire script and links to the Freddy website!
All together, great DVD!  I'd recommend it to any body anyday!

Nancy has returned to help the remaining Elm Street kids to defeat the utmost evil, Freddy Krueger. The Elm Street kids are now in a psychiatric ward and are being treated for all types of sleep disorders. And noone will believe them until Nancy shows up. There are 3 very interesting concepts introduced into the NOES series.
1. Kristin, played by Patricia Arquette, is one of the newest patients at the ward. She has the ability to pull people into her dreams by calling out their names. They could've overused this technique and made it annoying, but it wasn't overused. Thus it worked wonderfully.
2. The term ""Dream Warriors"" is efficient in the movie. It desribes how each kid had a special power or talent they could only use in their dream. They would later use their special powers or talent to try and defeat Freddy. This also was not overused, and for most of them, their powers or talents worked against them. The director made the best of all of them though, and it was great.
3. Each kid also had a weak spot. Such as Taryn, played by Jennifer Rubins, was a recovering heroin addict and Joey, played by Rodney Eastman, was mute. NOES3 is the first Nightmare where Freddy begins to use the kids' weaknesses against them.
 Each of these concepts were used in the best way possible, and I give mucho kudos to director Chuck Russel for bringing these concepts into the series. Wes Craven also helped in writing the script for this one.
 The cast has some pretty well-known faces in it also. Patricia Arquette plays the Kristin, she who wields the power of bring people into her dreams. This lady can scream, and she can also act very well. Heather Langenkamp makes her return to the series, and always brightens up the room with her great smile. John Saxon, who is Nancy's father and was in Nightmare 1, also returns. Laurence Fishburne has a very small role, but has a decent amount of screentime.

""Dream Warriors"" is one of the best entries in the series, and a lot of it was due to an imaginatively written screenplay. I give most of the credit to Wes Craven and Frank Darabont (that name should look familiar to fans of ""The Shawshank Redemption""). There are a lot of dream sequences that left me in total awe.

Thank God for this return to stir things up.  Well, the title ""Dream Warriors"" is good because it pretty much tells the story.  The people have abilities within these nightmares.  Hmmm....the powers aren't all that great and the possessors aren't worth caring about.
Forget about them for a sec except one in the character Kristen and her power to pull people into dreams.  This manages to keep the action going inside your mind.  This along with the young kids playing around the house is fun and chilling stuff.  Not to mention the fact that Freddy stabs for the funny bone while showing his evilness.

Well,if you ask me,this is the second best of the series,next to Part 7 (the New Nightmare).It holds a more ""dramatic"" sense of death than the any of the other entries of the series. The acting is superb. You'll actually feel sympathy for  Freddy's  victims. It's strange,coz usually your rooting for him the whole...  time  but here, you'll be hoping the kids make it out alive. Odd, but great. The  story is excellent. Kids use their dream powers to get back at Freddy,which  is very creative. The death scenes are excellent. Phillp's puppet death is  without a doubt the coolest  death of the film (not to mention,it's  incredibly gruesome and is sure to make you cringe for quite a while).The  special F/X are brilliant. Phillp's death,Freddy's make-up,the other death  scenes. It's just brilliant! Freddy also gets some real cool  ""upgrades"",with the ability to transform into a snake,and he even  wears a tuxedo at one point.  The gore is plentiful.if your looking for  gore, you won't be disappointed at all. Robert Englund's performance as  Freddy,once again,is incredible. Also,this is the last NOES flick where he  was evil. In NOES 4-6 he got very humorous,with his non-stop profanity,lame  one-liners and dumb tactics. He got VERY evil in Part 7 and was at his  darkest,and he's almost at his best and darkest here. My only gripe is the  running time. It's fairly short. Still,this is an excellent entry in the  series and definitely one of the
better ones. I highly recommend you go  out and buy it along with Part 7. It totally rocks! Rated R for gruesome  horror violence,some language and a sex scene.",962496000,,1649,4.894927536231884

34566,5,0780630866,"The last teenagers of Elm Street, institutionalised as a result of recurring bad dreams, are helped by Nancy, now a professional psychic counsellor, to fight back against Freddy as he continues his reign of  terror.
Forget Part 2.  This is the deffinate Nightmare on Elm Street  sequel.  The characters are well-written and acted and the plot is filled  with good ideas and interesting developments on the original film, not  least the would-be victims learning to control their dreams.  The special  effects and sets are also first-rate, filled as they are with imaginative  dream-like images.  A must-see if you liked the first film.",953769600,,635,5.137254901960785

34569,2,0780630866,"Vastly overrated entry in the Nightmare On Elm Street series, NOES3: Dream Warriors is barely passable for an evening's rental.  Gone are the dark overtones that set the serie's standard with the original NOES.  Instead we  have our villian showcasing bad one-liners and losing what little aura of  fear he sustained after the last sequel. Even the attempt here to bring the  NOES series into more of a fantasy/horror realm is filled with many missed  opportunities. The film's greatest selling point,  that the Elm Street kids  can fight back against their nocturnal assailant with their own  personalized dream powers,  is filled with great promise.....but ends up  taking a backseat once the bodies start piling up.  The performances are  passable at best,  with the returning Heather Langenkamp coming across as  shockingly ineffective after her great performance in the original  installment. Still, it is great to see John Saxon and Craig Wasson  exchanging blows and glances.  The special effects sequences are varied in  quality. Some of the effects,  like the Freddy Puppet are ingenious and  well-done.  However, the showdown in the junkyard with Wasson and Saxon  dueling with a stop-motion skeleton looks, unfortunately, just like  that....two actors miming a fight with a superimposed stop-motion creation.  Still,  for all it's faults, NOES3:DW is worth a night's rental to catch  some of the better special effects of the series and to recapture some of  that 80's nostalgia (Dokken on the soundtrack!). spg2@earthlink.net",951609600,4,1537,5.34453781512605

The new staff member of the institution they are in tells them the truth behind their nightmares,  and with the help of a teenage girl (played by Patricia Arquette), she  encourages them to become ""Dream Warriors"".
Good story, great  visual effects, a surprising ending, and a good soundtrack make this movie  enjoyable. There are certain scenes where the dialogues are awful, but  overall, a very great movie. Go rent the plain version of this movie, NOT  the Digitally Remastered, if you want to see the Dream Warriors music video  by Dokken. If you liked the original, you'll like this one!",949622400,3,694,5.035087719298246
34581,5,0780630866,"One heck of a film. This was the first ELM STREET film I saw and I really got into the series after this. This fantasy horror is so much better than any FRIDAY 13TH because its original, and has a plot. The ending to this is  one of the best/ clever endings to a horror film and Freddy moves to  different heights of evil (ie:  turns into a snake, puppet, nurse and he  wears a tuxedo.)
Simply brilliant, horror fans miss this at your peril!",947721600,2,441,4.152941176470589

This sequel still has quite a number of good scares and killings which will be enjoyed by a number of  fans of the series. Nancy's return also makes it a worth see. Probably one  of the best Freddy sequels.,946252800,,320,4.145161290322581
