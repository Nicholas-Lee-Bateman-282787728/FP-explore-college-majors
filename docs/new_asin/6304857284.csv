7880090,5,6304857284,"I bought both these movies because of the rave reviews from Stephen Chow fans. Their biggest drawback: substandard English subtitles. However, the movies pay you back for sticking with them in spite of this.

 The first one was kind of tough -- lots of broad physical humor -- a few brilliant Stephen Chow gags. And the second one is connected to the first one in only a haphazard way.

 But you really do need to see both of them.

My interest was immediately captured when I realized the actor playing Monkey King was Stephen Chow. He completely inhabits that part and he's just hilarious. Particularly amusing is his troubled relationship with his teacher Tripitaka -- who gets to brilliantly lampoon religious double-speak.

The second movie is just unforgettable. I would love to see Chow play Monkey King in a real film treatment of the original Journey to the West.",1156982400,,872,4.818791946308725
7880091,5,6304857284,"I've already expressed my great appreciation of this movie in another review of part one. I believe part one and two are inseparable, and they are equally good, but quite different in style. While part one is more slapstic and more funny, part two is a more ""serious"" exploration of identity, time, and love, in a more postmodern sense.",1128902400,,336,4.711864406779661
7880092,4,6304857284,"Ive seen Chinese Odyssey many times, because its just so funny! Chinese Odyssey is not really a remake of the Chinese classic, Journey to the West, but its more of a parody, or a side story based on the Monkey King.

The second part starts off with Monkey King (Stephen Chow) who is now 500 years back in the past due to a malfunction of Pandoras Box. Here, he meets with Fairy Zixia (Athena Chu) and got involved romantically with her, although initially, he wasn't too fond of her. Its also as funny as part one, and Wukongs super long-winded and naggy master, Tripitika (Law Kar-Ying), also provides more laughs here. My fave moment in part two has to be the super hilarious Only You version sang by Tripitika!

Therere plenty of twists and turns that are really different from the original story, which is good since it doesnt get boring even if you already know the story of the Monkey King. However, a minus is that youll need to know the story of the Monkey King to be able to appreciate and laugh at some of the jokes aimed at the original story, but if you dont, therere still plenty of comical parts around to keep you laughing. The funny parts may be rather silly at times, but go ahead and laugh at their silliness. Afterall, Stephen Chow is known to be the King of Comedy. :)

Part two has a stronger romance theme than part 1, and the ending is kind of romantic and nice, albeit a little sad. Chinese Odyssey comes in two parts, so youll need to watch part 1 as well to be able to fully understand the entire movie. If you're into Chinese mythology and culture, give this a try and take the time to enjoy this show!",1106611200,2,1629,4.3519736842105265
7880093,4,6304857284,"The second and finale to the Chinese Odyssey adventure has Joker (Stephen Chow) travelling 500 years back via the Pandora's Box to save his designated beloved, Pak Jingjing (Karen Mok, who has died in part 1).  Unfortunately (or fortunately) he meets with the Zixia Fairy (played by a ravishing Athena Chu) who's convinced he's the one for her -- although she's also co-possessed by the spirit of her sister, Lin Qingxia (aka Brigitte Lin, in a satiric nod to ""Ashes of Time"").  It's funnier (though not wackier) than the first instalment, thanks in no part to Law Kar-Ying, who plays the long-winded master, singing a riotous ""Only You""; the plot coheres too, in a way which the first part never manages to.  Stephen Chow gets to act much more in this film than does the first.  The ending is affecting and apt, and Athena Chu is so sweet as to be irrestible; I'm glad that Stephen Chow gets to kiss her in the end.",1106438400,2,916,4.567073170731708
