2704825,5,B000LC3IKQ,"I have now watched this piece at least 6 times since I bought it this past Friday and let me say it is worth the money. While it isn't perfect, I am just glad to see some of this old footage as it brings back memories of me watching World Class on ESPN during the mid to late 80's. Yes, ESPN used to air them and AWA at one time.

Anyway, back to the product, it was great to see Gary Hart, Skandor Akbar and ""Wild"" Bill Irwin again and to hear their stories. Its also great to see Kevin Von Eric still around to give us his stories about his dad and brothers. Time has been kind to them but not so kind of the former Fabulous Freebirds, especially Buddy Roberts and ""Gorgeous"" Jimmy Garvin! Michael Hayes still looks pretty good and I like hearing his views on World Class as well. I also liked seeing guys that often are forgotten like the late Missing Link, Kamala, The Great Kabuki (kayfabe ""father"" of former IWGP and NWA Champion The Great Muta), ""Iceman"" King Parsons, ""The Mercenary of Mayhem"" Bruiser Brody, Abdulah The Butcher and Gino Hernandez.

If I have any problems with this release, I would've liked to have heard from ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin. True, he didn't wrestle for World Class (it had changed to USWA by the time he started) but he was trained by ""Gentleman"" Chris Adams so I would've liked to have heard from him about Chris. I mean, we heard from Mick Foley, HHH and Shawn Michaels so why not Austin? Oh well, you can't have everything.

The ending of the promotion wasn't as sad as all the deaths like Gino Hernandez and the Von Eric brothers. David's was particularly sad because it has been said he was next in line to be NWA World Champion in 1984. Mike and Chris' deaths, while sad, weren't totally surprising because (based on what's said on the documentary) there were signs. Kerry's death was almost as shocking as David's in the respect that no one saw that one coming at all! Still, they were tragic no matter how you slice it.

This release from WWE wasn't perfect by any means but it still gets 5 stars from me because any acknowledgement of wrestling outside of WWE is always a good sign.

Overall, this release gives you a good idea of who World Class was and what they contributed to what we call ""sports entertainment."" I will also be purchasing ""Heroes of World Class"" very soon as it has also received high praise. Between the two, you'll almost have a definitive look at this Texas promotion which had great wrestling, colorful personalities and fans whose loyalty and passion for these wrestlers rivaled (in my opinion) those fans who cheered the original ECW during the mid to late 90's! Definitely deserves a place on any wrestling fans wall or someone who likes good documentaries.",1197936000,39,2732,4.511111111111111
2704826,3,B000LC3IKQ,"Just finished watching my copy, and I thought Vinnie Mac & Company did a decent job on this, but it didn't look or feel definitive.  There were no matches at all from David Von Erich (the greatest all-around performer of the Von Erichs), and the famous Ric Flair/Kerry Von Erich NWA title match from the first David Von Erich Parade of Champions is missing, despite reports it would be included.

However, the news is not all bad.  The matches that have been included have (for the most part) been digitally cleaned and look awesome, as does the footage in the documentary.  A few matches that should be here are, such as Fritz's retirement match vs. King Kong Bundy, the Ric/Kerry cage match at Star Wars that set up the white-hot Von Erichs/Fabulous Freebirds feud, and the Hair vs. Hair Match with Iceman King Parsons vs. Buddy Roberts.

As far as the doc goes, it has some holes (glossed over Brody and his death, no David matches), but fills others left by the superb ""Heroes of World Class"" documentary from last year (no Missing Link, Abdullah the Butcher, Kabuki, Bill Irwin, etc.).  I would recommend watching both to get a full picture of the once-great NWA territory known as World Class Championship Wrestling.",1197763200,2,1222,4.740566037735849
2704827,4,B000LC3IKQ,"I bought Heroes of World Class about a month ago to prepare myself for this latest documentary ""WWE"" style. The WWE is a great disc and is of course a top notch product. However I kind of preferred the Heroes of World Class DVD because they covered way more content and included alot of old clips. If you're a fan of WCCW then I suggest you pick up both as each have their own qualities that make them the ultimate World Class Anthology. Buy Heroes for the documentary and buy Triumph for the matches.",1197331200,4,501,4.340425531914893
2704828,4,B000LC3IKQ,"For about 10 years have I longed for a in depth documentary of the world famous VON ERICHS and World Class Championship Wrestling...even after the release of HEROES OF WORLD CLASS was released....I was hoping that Vinnie Mac would buy the complete library from KTTV/ Channel 11 and the last survivor of the family Kevin. I have been a wrestling enthusiast for the better part of 30 years...and when people woof and blow smoke about which organization had the best or better talent..and then there was one...WCCW!!! For those that are not too familiar with WCCW, it was a territory of the old National Wrestling Alliance...and let the truth be know...World Class was on the verge of being bigger than the whole Alliance..but more on that later...when you talk about the names that have come through Dallas/ Fort Worth territory, time would fail me to list all of wrestlers that came through WCCW...the likes of SHAWN MICHAELS...RICK RUDE..ULTIMATE WARRIOR...RODDY PIPER...THE UNDERTAKER..TERRY TAYLOR...KABUKI...ONE MAN GANG...HARLEY RACE and RIC FLAIR on numerous occasions came through to defend at one time the ""only"" WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP of the NWA. There might have been super cards in MSG..the SuperDome...or the Last Tango in Tampa...but atleast 5 to six times a year, WCCW would put on STARWARZ shows at the 18,000 seat Reunion Arena...and have COTTON BOWL EXTRAVAGANZA'S...along with shows at Texas Stadium. Not to sound like a homer, because I live in Dallas, but I liked the VON ERICHS, but rooted for FLAIR or the FREEBIRDS whenever they would meet. I can remember watching a show on cable television around 1984 of MID-SOUTH wrestling..and to my surprise there was Kerry Von Erich teaming up with MAGNUM T.A.and the crowd were going ape @##$@!!..it took Kerry atleast 5 minutes to get down the aisle and into the ring..in Florida Championship Wrestling David was a star there along in Kansas City winning the MISSOURI STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.The popularity of WCCW and the VON ERICHS was contagious...and if Fritz wanted to go head to head with Vince during the time of the advent of cable television and his raid of other territories, I think he could have ran neck and neck. The major down fall of WCCW in my opinion was that stars that the promotion help get started turned their backs on the promotion and headed to Bill Watts UWF, WWF or the AWA...and when Jim Crockett started to monopolize the world title and basically high-jacked the NWA in his quest to turn his MID-ATLANTIC promotion into a national promotion....really, what can you do when you cant book the world title to be defended in your territory , yet at the same time you're operating under the same umbrella of the NWA system?...simple...you leave the NWA...and that is what WCCW did in 1986, when the declared their American Heavyweight Title a ""world title"".Depending on how you look at it...some say that is one element of WCCW failing...I won't get into the tradgedy part...I'll let the veiwers do that for themselves...but I just wanted to harp on specifics about one  of the greatest promotions in the history of professional wrestling. On the DVD I'm sure they will talk about SUPER CLASH III, when the WORLD CLASS title was unified with Verne's AWA world title, culminating with the sale of the promotion to a out fit in Memphis which eventually became USWA. I have not watched the DVD yet, but hoping that they would have STARWARZ CHRISTMAS 1983...Michael Hayes had just lost a loser leave town the month before..at this show, we see a omnious santa claus at ring side passing out candy all through the show...and when the main event was over which pitted Kevin and Mike against the other FREEBIRDS in which the 'BIRDS lost...the mysterious Santa ranned in the ring in jubilant congratulating the VON ERICHS..and then starts to deck them...it was Hayes in disguise!!!...LOL...a funny moment in wrestling. I hope that those that buy the DVD will be treated to something unique and different....and know the history of a organization that operated with world class precision, showmanship, style, and tradition....",1196467200,9,4109,4.998540145985402

2704830,5,B000LC3IKQ,"It has just come to my attention that WWE has decided not to release this DVD until December 11, 2007. As we all know, the mainstream media has been focusing their attention on the large amount of unfortunate tragedies that have occured in pro wrestling over the years and this DVD will be partially about some of those tragedies. WWE feels that it wouldn't be appropriate to release this DVD at this time. Not only due to the media coverage but also following the Benoit family tragedy that occured in June.

This isn't the only future WWE DVD release that has been effected by the Benoit family tragedy. Another DVD was scheduled to be released this month dedicated to the career of Stone Cold Steve Austin but the release date of that DVD has been pushed back because it was going to feature one or two Chris Benoit matches and WWE doesn't want to release DVD's that feature Benoit matches at this time. They may completely remove the Benoit matches from that DVD.

Also, WWE wanted to release the SummerSlam Complete Anthology DVD Box Set in time for the holiday season but that's been put on hold because WWE is trying to decide what they're going to do about the Benoit matches that took place at the SummerSlam events. I have more news about wrestling DVD's and wrestling in general on my free hotline called the Ringside Report at (847)604-3769. I can let you know for sure when the DVD's you're looking for will ship from great retailers like Amazon.

Plus, we are finally given an in-depth explanation of the sudden loss of David Von Erich.  WWE can't be wholly faulted because WCCW's tragic moments became many at once.  You'll watch most of this video enjoying the legacy of this organization.  But by the time it ends, you will want to cry.  The first time I watched it was the last time I watched it.

2704870,5,B000LC3IKQ,"This is an awesome DVD. World Class was new to me given I was born in the middle of it's glory years and was just five or so when it went out of business. I loved this DVD and learned about how Awesome wrestling was in that era. When I think of Wrestling I think of the WWF in the 80s being the face of wrestling with NWA and Ric Flair not far behind. AWA was also great but similar to World Class it was before my time.

  The rivalry between The Von Erich's and The Freebirds is one of the greatest rivalries in the history of wrestling. The Freebirds were like The NWO before The NWO. The Von Erich's were awesome wrestlers and so entertaining and exciting. Jimmy Garvin along with Precious was a great staple of World Class. He was a great wrestler. Chris Adams was a very underrated and gifted wrestler. Ice Man Parsons was awesome. King Kong Bundy was great here where he got his start. Gino Hernandez was a great wrestler there. World Class had a lot of Major Players and if the tragedies never happened the Company could still be here today or would have lasted another ten years. We might have seen a whole different wrestling world.

  I really like Gary Hart and I believe he knew a lot about wrestling and if Fritz would have recognized that and treated him better World Class might have lasted longer and it certainly would have been better. We learn on the DVD Fritz didn't pay Hart well at all and Hart helped put World Class on the map. Hart was creative and could build great storylines and make wrestlers. He was an asset. Much like in WWE Vince knew Jim Ross knew a lot about wrestling and maybe more than him so he treated him poorly and I think he felt threatened. I am not sure what went wrong with Fritz and Hart but if things went smoothly World Class would have been back on track and weathered some of the storms.

  The dvd is great as it features interviews from all the Major Players from World Class from Bill Mercer, Kevin Von Erich, Gary Hart, The Sheik, Michael Hayes, Jimmy Garvin, Bill Irwin and Buddy Roberts. You get the whole story and honest truth.

  In the end World Class is often too remembered for the tragedies than for the awesome promotion it was. It was just as good as WWE and NWA. They had great wrestlers and put one some great shows. You miss those days but I hope still a promotion like that might come around again in the future. In the current lean years of wrestling it's fun to look back at the glory years. Cheers!!",1408060800,,2473,4.306034482758621
2704871,5,B000LC3IKQ,Excellent DVD if you're an Old School wrestling fan. They even talk about Gino Hernandez in this. You get to see Buddy Roberts in an interview!,1404950400,,143,4.538461538461538
2704872,4,B000LC3IKQ,"It pains me not to give this 5 stars, but there are a few issues with this. The best part of this set is that the documentary (the shining star of the set) perfectly supplements the WWE network. With the WWE network having so many WCCW shows now (and hopefully more to come) the documentary helps frame all that.

You can find match lists and match reviews on here, so I won't do that. I will, however, cover a few pros and cons of this DVD.

Pros
- Great documentary with lots of good interviews. It certainly highlights the von erichs, but so did WCCW as a whole. It is a sad and tragic story so this one is one of the more compelling ones.
- Some good, rare matches that you won't find on any other set. Very few WCCW stars made it huge in the WWE so they won't get their own sets. There is even a 2/3 falls match between Duke Keomuka and Ricky Starr that will certainly be hard to get ahold of anywhere else. It is just nice to have access to that stuff.
- You get to see Terry Gordy and David Von Erich. Neither guy is featured enough, but these are two of the most underrated wrestlers ever. They are ahead of their times in terms of style and agility. If you really like wrestling you will see why they were the wrestling glue that held this feud together.
- Good extras and interviews
- AMAZING price

Cons
- Not enough matches. It isn't as big a deal with WWE network supplementing everyone's collections now, but this really should have more matches. With so much talent and such a hot crowed, there is really no excuse not to have more matches.
- Not enough Terry Gordy or David Von Erich (see above)
- Doesn't get to the as many stars as I would like.

Bottom Line: You should buy the set. It is a really important chapter in wrestling history. This set is much more about the documentary than it is the matches, but it is well worth the price.",1402531200,,1856,4.190476190476191

I had never seen King Kong Bundy with hair before, or Paul Bearer with blonde hair, so that was a bonus.  Kamala has always been a favorite of mine, but his match was rather boring.

2704892,4,B000LC3IKQ,"I'll try to keep this review brief but to the point. I love the history of the Von Erichs which the WWE people put together. It had a few tidbits of info that I never knew that were NOT included in HEROES OF WORLD CLASS<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-of-World-Class-The-Von-Erich-Story/dp/B005K8RJPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes of World Class : The Von Erich Story</a>&nbsp;such as the confirmation of a story that was printed in the now-defuct WOW (WORLD OF WRESTLING) Magazine: that during his WWE career, Kerry Von Erich wrestled with an artificial foot! The WWE version is relatively more upbeat than the previously mentioned collection, in that they showed some of the little features for which WORLD CLASS became famous, such as Jimmy Garvin and Sunshine working on David Von Erich's farm as a stipulation for losing his Texas Championship.

All in all it's a fine collection and MUST be purchased with Heroes of World Class as they complement each other. However, on a down note, NEITHER collection contains matches featuring The Dynamic Duo GINO HERNANDEZ and CHRIS ADAMS! After The Freebirds, the ""Bad To The Bone Boys"" were the most popular\hated Tag Team in Texas and it's a crime that NONE of their matches were included! Why?

The only complaint that I have is that they did a terrible job showcasing Kerry Von Erich on Disc 2 (The Matches). The only match that features Kerry is a losing effort against Ric Flair in a steel cage for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The significance of this match is that is was the birth of the Fabulous Freebirds/Von Erich feud, which is why I assume it was included. They should've at least included Kerry winning the title from Flair at David's memorial show, and it would've been nice to see some of Kerry's WWE career included on Disc 2 as well. This package really could've been a 3 disc release.

2704907,3,B000LC3IKQ,"Having been a huge fan of wrestling (mostly the 80's), I was really looking forward to this collection.  I grew up watching matches from every promotion and I've got to say that there could've been at least a 4-disc set as mentioned above.  I can recall several matches that were left out here and possibly other wrestlers as well.  Even if there were a larger set released I would've paid for it!  Might have given this a 4-star rating, but only gave it 3 because I enjoyed the commentary more than anything.",1336521600,,509,4.5

They did less than minute on Kamala, The Missing Link, Abdullah The Butcher, and The Great Kabuki. Not to mention did not metion the Dingo (Ultimate) Warrior which would have been cool for people who did not know where he started.

2704909,5,B000LC3IKQ,"In many ways, it's admirable that WWE owner Vince McMahon allowed a DVD retrospective of World Class wrestling to be made. Yes, he had recently purchased the company's library, and i'm sure knew he'd make a decent little profit from the disc's sales. But the content of the documentary portion is excellent. This is a Shakespearean level tragedy that was kept partially hidden from the organization's rabid fan base...hidden until the tragic amount of injuries and deaths severely affected the product. It's certainly a tale any pro wrestling afficianado should know.
  Even though i awarded this release 5 stars, it's not without faults. And that's primarily due to the short shrift given to fans as far as actual matches are concerned. Let's face it, people purchase wrestling biographies more for the bouts than the interviews. The matches included here are great...but how can you omit any matches featuring the great heel Gino Hernandez? ""The Handsome Half-Breed"" oozed charisma, and drew heat as well as any heel, maybe ever. So that's a huge minus against this release. But it was great to see Brody, Abdullah, Gang, and so many others. Caveats aside, this is a must-own.",1332720000,,1178,5.035897435897436
2704910,3,B000LC3IKQ,"this video has 2 dvds.the first goes on and on and on about the von erich family and how big they were in texas.they shouldve just called it ""THE VON ERICH STORY"".so its extremely repetitive.even the parts about the freebirds grows stale fast.because then the story simply shifts to how big the von erich/freebird fued was.
some other stuff includes the ""bad street u.s.a."" music video.it was horribly recorded onto the dvd so i could hardly understand what was being said.
there was some stuff about jimmy garvin but not when he was with the free birds.i remember them being a team.
then all of the von erichs started dying.suicide after suicide.i noticed also that on the part about kerry,they left out that he got caught with a buttload of cocaine which is why he killed himself to avoid a lengthy prison sentence.they also switched up some of the younger von erichs overdosing on steroids.thats the problem with the wrestling higher up.they think our memories only go back a few years.they are always giving out false stats and making things up about the royal rumble and saying so and so was the first guy whoever blah blah blah when some other guy did it in the 80's.
  the 2nd dvd was the matches that made them big.the first one was so old it was in black and white.i think the competitors were david and goliath.then more and more matches rolled out.once again,almost all of them containing the von erichs and freebirds.also,the iron claw manuver was so stupid.my brother used that on me all the time and it didn't hurt at all.even the best match was good for only like the last 5 minutes.it was ric flair vs kerry von erich.
another thing was they made such a big deal on dvd 1 about how the dad,fritz ,always knew kerry would be world champuion one day.he did,but,only held the title not even like 3 weeks before losing it back to ric flair.and the attendance records they were citing from the early 80's were like 40,000.in 1987,vince mc mahon over doubled that with 98,000 at wrestlemania 3.
so,i think either everyone lied in the 80's about the von erichs or everyone on that dvd is lying now because they are 2 different stories.
  also,once again,triple h was on there bashing the person the dvd was commemorating.he does this a lot.he talked all kinds of trash on his father in law,vince mcmahon,who gave him a job in wrestling and let him rise to be one of the biggest stars ever with dx,putting cactus jack out at hell in a cell,a royal rumble win in 02' and something like 6 wrestlemania main events.he also made fun of the big show every chance he got.on this video,he said he didn't think hardcore should be considered a style.that pompous,arrogant ungrateful jerk made himself a name in hardcore.here are some examples.
  vs mankind no dq.
  vs cactus jack in hell in a cell
  with hbk vs shane and vince with the big show in a hell in a cell
  2 elimination chambers
  he carries around a sledge hammer etc etc etc.
  this is just some more mc mahon bs to make more money.i cant blame him.money is nice.but,put out something we want to watch.and who are these losers who decide what matches get to go on?i buy dvd set after dvd set and the stars best and most memorable matches and moments aren't on them.these include the big show,undertaker,hbk,rey mysterio jr and more.

if you are a von erich fan,this PERFECT for you.if you are a wrestling historian,then this will be quite nice as well.but,if you are anybody else,put your money on the rvd dvd set.its the most awesome one ever with very few exceptions.",1328918400,,3533,4.600318471337579

2704923,5,B000LC3IKQ,This is a great video for anyone that followed or had an interest in World Class Wrestling back in the 80s. It is an incredible tale of the hell that this family has went through. I was literally left stunned at the end of the video.

2704925,5,B000LC3IKQ,"Wow! This DVD took me back to the golden days of Wrestling, back to the days when wrestlers were real athletes but could still put on a show for the people. No one did this better than the wrestlers of World Class Championship. I remember being clued to my TV on Fridays and Saturdays watching wrestling on regular TV and cable.

For me, it is so good seeing the late Gary Hart and the late Skandor Akbar hearing their stories again. ""Wild"" Bill Irwin looks better than he did when he was wrestling and I appreciate him speaking up for the late David Von Erich. The Fabulous Freebirds are featured on this DVD, too. While Michael Hayes looks pretty good, I was shocked by ""Gorgeous"" Jimmy Garvin's appearance and sadden by Buddy Roberts's cancer.  The dvd also mentions the late Missing Link, Kamala, The Great Kabuki, ""Iceman"" King Parsons,the late Bruiser Brody, Abdulah The Butcher, the late Chris Adams and the late Gino Hernandez but could have done a better job in explaining their importance to wrestling. These men are legends and deserve more respect.

However, the highlight for me are the Von Erichs. I had a crush on each of them (David, Kevin and Kerry), especially the greatest of them all David. When David died, the WCCW began its decline. Many people, including myself, believe had David lived the world of Wrestling would be entirely different. This is why I am surprise that Vince and WWE did such a good job on this DVD because its shows how the WCCW led the way for so many years before Vince started buying everyone off. Another golden feature (dealing with the Von Erichs) is the now infamous 'Gorgeous' Jimmy/Sunshine day as David's valet in its entirely...still funny 25 years later. It was good to see Kevin again and I hope he/ his family are at peace. Alot of burden for one man to carry but he seems to be doing well.

I haven't watched wrestling in over 18 years. I lost my heart for it when the Von Erichs started dying and WWF/WWE became too commerical. Wrestling will never be the same and has started its decline because the people who control it have no idea what it is...one have to wonder if the old system was the best system because the modern system is not.

Good bye WCCW but thank you for the memories!",1309737600,,2244,4.544554455445544
2704926,4,B000LC3IKQ,"My biggest problem with this DVD is the title.  It is called Triumph and Tragedy of WCCW...but based on the documentary it should have been called Triumph and Tragedy of the Von Erichs.  Don't get me wrong.  The documentary was great and I thoroughly enjoyed it but it wasn't about the entire WCCW.

The documentary centered around the Von Erichs (and the Freebirds to some extent).  And while you would expect the Von Erichs discussed heavily I did expect some of the other stars to be discussed.  Barely mentioned were performers like the Missing Link, Kamala, Abdul The Butcher, Bruiser Brody, Jimmy Garvin, Bill Irwin, Gino Herendez (who died while one of the top heels in the promotion), and so many other greats.  I also expected more discussion around some of the poor choices made by the promotion, the stolen talent by Wild West Wrestling that forced the Von Erichs to sell a portion of their promtion to get their people back, etc.

Like i said the documentary was great for one focused on the Von Erichs...just call it what it really is.",1303689600,,1048,4.688524590163935
2704927,5,B000LC3IKQ,"I am not a big fans of wrestling but grew up watching the WCCW so I had to get this. The matches are awesome just like I remembered when I was a kid. The Von Erichs were HUGE in the Dallas area but that were I was a little kid. If you grew up in Dallas or remember any of the WCCW then this is for you. There is also another WCCW video that Kevin but out about 5 years ago (2006) called the Heroes of World Class Wrestling (the director cut does not add much) that is prety good. This made me remember when I was little and thought wrestling was real, I would fight you if you told me different. Today wrestling is just a bunch a lights and bad story lines. Kids don't even care if it real which to me takes away from all of it. The Von Erich/Freebird rivalry was the best in wrestling history (nothing comes close, it went on for years) and is up there with Cowboys/Redskins, it was HUGE in Dallas. So if you never heard of WCCW buy it anyway, it is history of wrestling.",1290902400,,972,4.015463917525773
2704928,4,B000LC3IKQ,"I never really understood how or why WCCW's syndicated show got on TV in my neck of the woods in the early 80's, since i lived in AWA country, and the standard AWA ""All-Star Wrestling"" show was already getting competed against by two WWF shows at the time -- but one day, there it was. The show quickly became my favorite, simply because WCCW shows employed the radical concept of SHOWING THE GOOD MATCHES ON TV. The AWA and WWF shows on broadcast TV at the time were an endless litany of star v. jobber matches -- to get the ""good"" stuff, you were supposed to come out to the bouts and buy a ticket. With WCCW, you got REAL matches, all the time, which was AMAZING. They also always had a pretty limited number of wrestlers working for the promotion at any given time -- it didn't seem like it was more than a dozen or so -- so it was easy to pick up on the various personalities and storylines. I really think it was the best wrestling TV show ever, or at least the best wrestling show that wasn't on cable. I guess that doesn't have much to do with the DVD set, so let's move on.

I thought the documentary portion was decent, though not as good as the Rise & Fall of the AWA documentary. It was more kay-fabey than that, but not horridly so like the Starrcade documentary was. Obviously, they had a good tale to tell -- but, like most fans, i'd have liked to have seen them dig a little deeper on various issues. Like, when they say Kerry Von Erich wasn't ""reliable,"" what does this mean, exactly? It would be nice to get some insight as to the scope of the problem. Did he not show up for matches, at all? How many matches? What kind of matches? Or did he just show up messed up? Anyway, it's decent, but not deep. Kevin Von Erich's interviews seem sort of half-shoot/half-worked; i hate having to decode what is reality and what is kayfabe out of what he says. Still, a good story, generally told well.

It was great to see some of the old matches, but i want more. There really should have been an additional disc of matches. I understand why they included the Kamala v. Kabuki and Brody/Missing Link v. One Man Gang/Rick Rude matches -- to tie-in various later-to-be WWE personalities -- but these aren't particularly important matches in the history of the WCCW, and therefore they compose too great a percentage of the matches here. They'd be fine if there was another disc full of matches, but, as it stands, i'm sort of like ""why THIS match?"" all too often here. Put another way, Kamala appears in as many matches here as Kerry Von Erich -- one! Further, i'm not sure what factors conspired to keep the Kerry/Flair Texas Stadium bout off the DVD, but leaving that match off the DVD is like leaving the Ice Bowl off of a Green Bay Packers DVD. Not hearing Gino Herndandez saying ""I AM YOUR CHAMPION!"" once during this DVD set is also inexcusable.

In short, the documentary portion is good -- not truly great -- and there should have been double the amount of matches. Since there weren't, they should have made better use of the one disc's worth of matches they did include. Not fully satisfying, but by no means disappointing.",1287360000,,3139,4.390034364261169

2704941,5,B000LC3IKQ,"After watching the excellent World Class documentary ""Heroes of World Class,"" I checked out ""The Triumph and Tragedy"" and rate both of them five stars.  Although ""Triumph"" isn't as long as ""Heroes"" (it's about an hour and fifty minutes), it covers some issues that were not addressed in ""Heroes"" and offers vintage promos and additional interview clips as extras.  ""Heroes"" has more perspectives from the creators and non-wrestlers of World Class like Mickey Grant, Marc Lowrance, and David Manning while ""Triumph"" has more interviews with wrestlers like Michael Hayes, Jimmy Garvin, Buddy Roberts, Bill Irwin, Jerry Lawler, Verne Gagne, and Triple H.  I recommend both documentaries for World Class fans.

""Triumph"" begins with a brief history of Dallas wrestling as told by Skandor Akbar, Dusty Rhodes, and Bill Mercer.  Kevin discusses the career of his father Fritz.  An interesting point is both Fritz and Kerry were capable but unable to compete in the Olympics because of marriage for the former and the boycott for the latter.  ""Triumph"" seems to flow better than ""Heroes.""  Clips are shown of Iceman King Parsons, Sunshine vs. Precious, Chris Adams, Kamala, The Missing Link, Bruiser Brody, and the Freebirds vs. the Von Erichs.  Neither DVDs make mention (except a commentary on the bonus ""Heroes"" DVD) of Brian Adias.  Why is that?

The tragedies are told in a different way on ""Triumph"" compared to ""Heroes.""  Bill Irwin was in Japan with David Von Erich and may have been the last man to see David alive when he left him at his hotel room.  He gives convincing insight on what he believes caused David's death.  Mike Von Erich's toxic shock syndrome and suicide, Chris's suicide, and Kerry's motorcycle accident is discussed in more detail on this DVD than in ""Heroes.""  Kerry's suicide is told a little differently here, too (no mention of Kevin trying to warn his father).  More details on Gino Hernandez's ""overdose"" are on ""Heroes,"" but there is information on Gino's paranoia on this disc.  Clips of Chris Adams's ""blindness"" is found here (it is completely ignored on ""Heroes"").  The Lance Von Erich experiment is also discussed more here.

""Triumph"" covers, briefly, the demise of World Class and the change to the USWA which wasn't discussed at all on ""Heroes.""  Strangely, the murders of Adams and Bruiser Brody are not discussed at all.  The drug issue is covered here more as well with Triple H mentioning that the Von Erich story is an anti-drug public service announcement.  ""Triumph"" is a little more critical than ""Heroes"" of some of the decisions and actions of the Von Erichs.  Fritz did not want to hear about the drug problem in his wrestling organization.  Kerry's lack of reliability is mentioned (though not detailed).  Two different perspectives on Fritz's ""heart attack"" are given by Gary Hart and Kevin.

The extras are excellent.  I like the Gino Hernandez promos (""What you see is what you get and what you don't see is better yet"") and the full-length Freebird video ""Badstreet.""  The most revealing extra is a story Kevin gives about suffering a serious concussion and his father insisting he wrestle in Japan in place of an AWOL Lance even though doctors were warning him a single blow to the head could kill him. Gary Hart describes a terrible plane crash he survived.  Jimmy Garvin gives a couple revealing stories on the pain wrestlers suffered to perform their craft.  Other extras include Tea with Chris Adams, 1983 Iceman promo, Freebirds 1983 interview (Michael Hayes was hilarious), Freebirds at home in 1984, Adams and Hernandez at the Guy Laney Lincoln car dealership, Jimmy Garvin as David's valet for a day, Sunshine gets an assistant, 1987 Kerry's Korner where Kerry talks about his fondness for photography. Interview segments: Hayes on Kabuki, Kevin on Sunshine, watching Fritz wrestle, showing Bobo Brazil a move that backfired, and being a survivor, and Bill Irwin tells a story about Fritz's generosity.

The second disc has twelve matches.  The first is an old black & white ""Texas Rasslin'"" match between Duke Keomuka and Ricky Starr. I would have liked to see a match with Jack Adkisson before he became Fritz.  These are the other matches: Fritz retirement match with King Kong Bundy, Ric Flair and Kerry steel cage match June 1982, May 1983 Parsons/Kevin/David vs. Freebirds with alternate commentary by Todd Grisham and Kevin, and Hair vs. Hair (Iceman vs, Buddy Roberts). There are three matches from the David Von Erich Memorial on May 1984: Kevin/Fritz/Mike vs. the Freebirds, Adams & Sunshine vs. Garvin & Precious,  Kabuki vs. Kamala.  The remaining matches are the Fantastics vs. the Midnight Express at the second David Von Erich Memorial, July 1985 match between Adams and Kevin with alternate commentary by Todd Grisham and Kevin, October 1986 Bruiser Brody & Missing Link vs. One Man Gang & Rick Rude, and October 1986 steel cage match with Brody vs. Abdullah the Butcher.  It seems like a decent variety of matches, but I would've liked to see a Gino Hernandez bout included on this disc. Still, for the price, it offers a lot of wrestling action and an excellent documentary.",1259366400,2,5154,4.987134502923976
2704942,3,B000LC3IKQ,"After watching and enjoying Heroes of World Class I thought it couldn't hurt to order this video. Heroes of World Class was obviously made with a lower budget but in my opinion was the better, more heartfelt of the two videos.

There were little things about this particular video that didn't make sense. Freebirds Jimmy Garvin and Buddy Rogers sat next to Michael Hayes without introduction for quite a while. It is almost impossible to figure out who these gentlemen are after several years away from the spot light. Also in the segment dedicated to Garvin there was no time allotted for his accounts of the storyline.

It bothered me to hear accounts from WCCW from HHH, Shawn Michael's and Jim Ross. I understand wrestlers can wrestle for years as virtual unknowns before being famous. But there were no documentation what so ever of any of these guys in WCCW. Their accounts were useless and didn't make sense to me. Instead I would have preferred to hear from actual members of the WCCW family.

I figured in the WWE DVD version there would be mention of Kerry's' foot coming off at ringside during a match; if indeed the story is true. During this video it's acknowledged that indeed Kerry's' foot was amputated but throughout the rest of the video you see him wrestling. I think to someone who was not as familiar with the story could easily be confused. I'm aware there is only so much time for the video but I figured they could have substituted a few Freebird stories.

Also, both videos say that Mike Von Erich wrote a note to his family, drank several beers and was found in a sleeping bag. But neither video says how while under the influence of drugs, beer and depression her actually drowned himself. The reason he wasn't found for several days had something to do with him having floated down the river.

This is a very tragic story and I wish it didn't have to be told. This video was a bit disappointing because when we buy videos such as this we think we're being told the whole story and I wish this had told a little bit more of the truth.",1242432000,,2061,4.529569892473118

I'm afraid I used to dismiss non-WWF product as ""cheap.""  Boy was I short sighted.  Too bad I can't relive this days as they happened (nor with the NWA or AWA) as seeing a fued unfold is just as much fun as a great match.  Anyway, you get the story of WCCW with all the fun they had but also the tragedies that dogged them.  They celebrate the many top guns of the promotion and include old time matches and interviews.  Current fans will recognize some of the faces and hopefully will not get bored by the matches which are slower compared to today's styles.  I was hoping for more, we never saw Gino Hernadez in action and the claim that Brody/Abdullah had proto-hardcore matches wasn't in evidence by the one match that had on here.  I hope future releases might get to more of the WCCW talent and use more of their vault.  I find it odd the Von Erichs are memorialized but no mention is made of the deaths of Bruiser Brody or Chris Adams.  These were part of the WCCW ""curse"" even if they happened after the promotion was gone (just like the deaths of Chris & Kerry Von Erich).",1239667200,,1247,4.219409282700422

How can you have a DVD about World Class without including a single match with Gino Hernandez,and the one that really gets me,how in the hell could you not include Kerry Von Erich's world title victory over Ric Flair in Texas Stadium???

2704947,3,B000LC3IKQ,"I thought WWE would do a better job with this, especially since the promotion is dead and no longer a threat!  If you were a big fan of World Class, you're probably going to be dissapointed.  If you were a casual wrestling fan, this will suit you just fine.

My biggest issue was with the choice of matches included.  This promotion had some of the most exciting wrestling matches of it's time and very few are included on this set.  WWE has the entire WCCW library at its disposal and it was unfortunate that this is the best they could come up with. Clearly this compilation was put together by somebody who didn't love the promotion.  If they did, the matches would have been better.

The Von Erichs and Freebirds are discussed in detail and even if you thought you knew everything about both, you will come away with new information. The deaths of all the brothers are narrated in uncomfortable detail, often by Kevin, who comes across as remarkably composed for somebody who has dealt with all that he has.  Despite his positive demeaner you can't help but see the pain in his eyes as he talks about the past and what could have been.

Michael Hayes is featured prominately, and his off the cuff comments about his involvement with the promotion that made him a major figure in pro wrestling were refreshingly candid. (""my agent called me and said you have GOT to see what's going on in Texas,"")  Jimmy Garvin and Buddy Rodgers add significant commentary as well, although Garvin's role in the company (among many others) could have been highlighted more.

The promotion was more than just those two groups and while Ice Man King Parsons, Gino Hernandez, and ""Gentleman"" Chris Adams get mentioned, the rest of the supporting cast get very little credit.  A critical factor in what made this promotion succeed and something that current promotions no longer do, is that World Class had three groups of wrestlers as opposed to the usual two.....in a nutshell, good guys, (Von Erichs) bad guys (Freebirds) and freaks (Devestation Inc.) Getting the Texas fans to cheer for Michael Hayes as he wrestled The Missing Link (for example) was an accomplishment that doesn't get the credit it deserves, and made the Freebird / Von Erich matches all the more juicier.

Several other wrestlers get a small mention in the story but none are adequately explored.  Another oversite was the acknowledgment and expanation of the constant turnover of NWA talent into and out of the promotion, which kept things fresh for many years.  The decision to break from the NWA was rightfully highlighted as one of the major reasons for the decline of the company.  Even Lance Von Erich gets a mention here, the ""proverbial Red Rooster"" of World Class, his insertion into the talent roster was a desperate attempt to recapture the magic of an earlier time while the promotion was in its last days.

The disc also includes a very candid discussion of the impact that drug and alcohol use had on the talent during the 80's. Several major wrestlers had substance abuse issues and often with disasterous results (Gino Hernandez).  Salaries and the lack of sufficient profit sharing were also discussed as one of the reasons for wrestler discontent and the promotions' eventual decline,  especially in the mid 1980's when the World Class was at it's peak.  Unfortunately the issue was never unpacked to the point where you felt like you knew where the truth was.

The trip to Israel, while mentioned, should have been highlighted more.  (Kevin Von Erich says the same in his reflections on this disc set)  World Class also performed two outdoor shows in the Boston area during its peak, a geographic anomoly that is unfortunately ignored. Ice Man King Parsons was highlighted at the time as the first African American World Champion, a juicy topic that is not mentioned at all in the video and totally ignored by todays wrestling historians, who give Ron Simmons that honor.

In short, a good compilation that could have been / should have been so much better.  World Class was ahead of its time in terms of promotion, the use of music and attractive performers.  (All points made by Michael Hayes and Triple H????? in the video) While the video set mentions that fact, it fails to adequately capture it visually.  Still for most wrestling fans, this will be a pleasant walk down memory lane.",1212451200,11,4364,4.784
2704948,5,B000LC3IKQ,"I'll be honest in that I didn't have the chance to see World Class until I got WWE 24/7 a year ago as it wasn't available to me growing up but this is WWE's 4th attempt at telling the story behind another wrestling promotion.  This can either go the way of the ""Rise & Fall Of ECW"" where they go a great job in telling the buildup & downfall of the company along with the legacy it left behind that's still used in wrestling today or the way of the AWA or WCW on the Monday Night Wars DVD where they quickly gloss over the positive influence of the company before spending a majority of time picking apart the negatives of the company from a heavily biased WWE point of view just to put over it's superiority.  Well, I saw this as the ECW route in which WWE did justice to a wrestling company that even I knew changed the way wrestling was presented that still effects us today.

The documentry kicks off by talking about the early days of Texas wrestling with comments from Texas legends such as Dusty Rhodes & Dory Funk Jr.  The beginning of Fritz Von Erich, his reputation, and how he moved into becoming a promoter & wrestler is talked about.  The documentry moves on in how the Von Erich boys (David, Kerry, Kevin) came into wrestling along, Fritz retiring as a wrestler leading to a big show at a football stadium in Texas, the backlash towards the kids being pushed in the promotion, and just how over the Von Erich's were over in Texas.  How the TV show expanded into sydication across america & international countries was talked about including how the boys wanted to travel but Fritz didn't want to break the traditional ""territorial"" rules.  All the new elements the promotion brought to wrestling such as personality profiles & features were glossed upon with a funny story about what happened at a water park.  The legacy of the Sportatorium was brought up next before moving onto how the Freebirds came into World Class & what elements they brought to the show in & outside the ring was talked about before moving onto how the big rivarly between them & the Von Erichs got started in the cage match with Kerry & Ric Flair.  The story behind Gary Hart leaving that night & Ken Mantel taking over the booking along with the influx of young stars coming into the company such as Wild Bill Irwin, Iceman Parsons, Jimmy Garvin with Sunshine & eventually his wife Precious, Chris Adams, Kamala, The Missing Link, and Brusier Brody is heavily discussed.  How the Freebirds feuds with the Von Erich's rivarly brought in bigger crowds along with the importance of each member of the group is discussed before moving onto all the events leading up to David's death in Japan along with the aftermath which lead to WCCW's biggest crowd.  The memoral show is discussed with highlights of Fritz coming out of retirement against the Freebirds along with Kerry winning the NWA Champion before revealing why Kerry didn't have a long reign as champion.  Gary Hart's return along with his influence in the Chris Adams heel turn & feud with Kevin was brought up including the ""stiff"" working styles both men had with each other.  The story behind Mike Von Erich's toxic shock syndrome was talked about before going into the negative effect that ""Lance Von Erich"" had on the company (I guess he was the Paul Roma of the group).  The story of Gino Hernandez in how over he was as a heel and various storylines he was in was talked about before moving on to his death via cocane & how much it effected Gary Hart up to that time (he's passed away since this DVD was released).  World Class withdrawing from the NWA & making their own champions was brought up in a negative light with comments from Gary Hart & Kevin in how that was a bad decision despite having wrestlers like Rick Rude & Chris Adams as champion.  The story behind Kerry's motorcycle accident & losing his foot is talked about next before talking about the influence of drugs into the company.  The events leading up to the suicide of Mike Von Erich is next and such a sad story told by Gary Hart before moving on to the heart attack angle they did with Fritz Von Erich.  The SuperClash III PPV with the unification match between AWA Champion Jerry Lawler & WCCW Champion Kerry Von Erich is talked about next with how various parts of match was booked due to certain events before moving on to how WCCW was turned into the USWA.  Kerry moving on to the WWF as the Texas Tornado & winning the Intercontinental Championship was highlighted before Kevin went into why he wanted to leave the business & the suicides of both Chris & Kerry Von Erich with footage from the ""Current Affair"" television show regarding Kerry's death close out the documentry.

This DVD comes with 12 bonus matches featuring a 2 out of 3 Falls match with Duke Keomuka vs. Ricky Starr, Fritz' retirement match against King Kong Bundy, the steel cage match between NWA Champion Ric Flair & Kerry Von Erich that started the feud with the Freebirds, Fritz coming out of retirement with Mike & Kevin against the Freebirds, Chris Adams & Sunshine vs. Jimmy Garvin & Precious, Great Kabuki vs. Kamala, Fantastics vs. Midnight Express, Bruiser Brody & The Missing Link vs. One Man Gang & Rick Rude, Bruiser Brody vs. Abdullah the Butcher in a steel cage match, and a Hair match between Iceman Parsons vs. Buddy Roberts.  Kevin Von Erich does alternative commentary with Todd Grisham on two matches with him vs. Chris Adams and with Kevin & Iceman vs. Freebirds.

The only negatives I have here is that eventhough as I said that I didn't watch WCCW until around a year ago, I know that more could have been said about King Kong Bundy & Destivation Inc. since even I heard about them when I was young but yet they didn't get anything past a quick one liner throughout this documentry & they would have gotten some words from Steve Austin since he's said it time & time again that he grew up watching WCCW & would drive down every Friday night to see the Von Erich/Freebird feud so his memories as a fan would have been great to hear.  In the end, this DVD reminded me exactly of Jake Roberts' in that when they bring up fun & memorable angles then it's a fun documentry to watch & get a couple of laughts off the stories being told but when they talk about the dark times, it's one that's either really distrubing or really sad to watch.  After watching this, you can see why WWE decided to push this documentry back for months after the Benoit incident last July & Triple H described the sad deaths throughout this promotion best...""A public service announcement saying DON'T DO DRUGS!""  This isn't just a documenty I recommend as a wrestling fan but one I would recommend for parents to show their children as well who are wrestling fans when teaching them the dangers of heavy drug use & the effects negative effects of suicide.",1211068800,3,6851,4.545897644191714
2704949,5,B000LC3IKQ,Why did u put this dvd out now in 2007 or 2008?The new young fans won't buy this dvd u should have launched it bakc in 2000 or 2001 heck even 2003 but not now....i waited years for this dvd. Dumb move wwe,1205798400,,204,3.7674418604651163
2704950,3,B000LC3IKQ,"Yes, it's a very good dvd, and let's admit it, the WWE is doing a very good job with its documentaries.

However, ""the triumph and tragedy of the Von Erich family"" would have been a proper title for this release, as I think that the documentary is focusing too much on the Von Erichs (as well as on the Freebirds) and not enough on what was the WCCW actually, its position in the business, its rivalries with the other territories and promotions etc. On such aspects, the AWA documentary released by the WWE was better and was not only about the Gagne family, so I would have wanted to know more about the other big names in the WCCW like the Missing Link, Kamala etc.

The four hours of bonus are interesting, but, once again, the matches seem to have been randomly picked and, to my view, cannot be considered as a best of, as there are several terrible matches (Kabuki vs. Kamala for example).

Oh yes, this dvd also has the best demonstration of hypocrisy I've ever seen ;here, Jerry Lawler tells that his match vs. Kerry Von Erich at AWA/WCCW SuperClash III was one of the greatest of his carreer...on the AWA dvd, he tells that the very same match is probably the most terrible he has ever been involved in ! (and what's even more ""incredible"" is that when you watch both dvd's, you see that both interviews have been shot on the same day !).

I don't regret my money, but this dvd could have been a lot better, especially in comparison with other WWE documentaries like ""Monday Night War"" or ""the Spectacular Legacy of the AWA"" !",1205798400,,1536,4.4361702127659575
2704961,5,B000LC3IKQ,"I loved the von erichs and WCCW was the only wrestling i loved.  Buy this and watch it you'll love it if you loved the von erichs and couldn't get enough. I wished it could have showed more interview footage of Kevin von erich and More matches; but what they showed was great. and very informative. It talks about some stuff ""heroes of world class"" didn't talk about. Its good to get both documentaries they are both great and have different things.",1203811200,2,449,4.475609756097561
2704962,3,B000LC3IKQ,"I am disappointed witht two things. First, there is no closed captioned at all for deaf.  Second, I don't see Gino Hernandez and Chris Adams wrestled, just Von Erichs and Freebirds that is all.  I hope in the future there will be more Gino Hernandez and Chris Adams in DVD.",1201564800,,273,4.44
2704963,5,B000LC3IKQ,"From 1982-1985, WCCW had the ""It"" factor; a syndicated-TV show - with state-of-the-art production - which aired main-event-quality matches, major shows which captivated national audiences and a Rock-n-Wrestling connection that did not make the talent into cartoon characters.

Though, for some of the talent, it became a party to the abyss. And, when it all began to fall apart, there were oftentimes very tragic consequences.

This two-disc set does a good job in capturing the growth of WCCW from a regional business into a powerhouse and its slide into irrelevance while it tried to hang on in the late 1980s as the independent WCWA and - from 1988-1990 - during the last gasp in the fatal merger with AWA and CWA.

While the documentary on disc one fails to mention the 1986 oil crisis which depressed the territory and the major talent wars with the upstart, UWF, the candid commentary by the legendary Gary Hart makes for compelling viewing. And no matter how many times the tragedy surrounding the Von Erichs is told, it remains a sad journey of the perils when business - at all costs - takes precedence over family.

The second disc - though Gino Hernandez is not in any of the bouts - features a good overview of the superior matches during the glory years; including the historic steel cage match of Kerry Von Erich versus Ric Flair and a steel cage match featuring two legends who invented hardcore, Bruiser Brody and Abdullah the Butcher.

This is a must purchase for fans who fondly remember WCCW or those who want a better historical understanding of the great heights and dramatic demise of a company which had so much, but for many of the wrestlers, it was too much, too soon.",1200960000,13,1693,4.744897959183674
2704964,4,B000LC3IKQ,"I noticed on the DVD when Gary speaks he has a tied tongue lisp and he talks slow and kind of like he's drunk. Watching him when he was a manager in the World Class and the NWA, I don't remember him talking like that. It's like he had a stroke or something.",1200700800,,257,3.8679245283018866

2704966,5,B000LC3IKQ,"I just finished watching the documentary portion of The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class. This was a very well done DVD.  Like others that have posted reviews, I like to see Vince talking positively about other companies in the wrestling world. I am always pleased with the WWE dvd's as of late and this is no difference. WCCW used to air on Saturday mornings before WWF's Superstars of Wrestling when I lived it Tampa, FLA. I used to love watching it and it was great to see some of my favorites being talked about. Ice-Man King Parsons was always a favorite of mine. I remember hearing about all the Von Erich deaths, and I think now that I am older and understand the culture of wrestling a lot more than I did in 1986, only made some of the stories a lot more tragic for me. Kevin recounts amazing stories of he and his bothers and life in wresting in the 80's. How Kevin still keeps his head up is truly inspiring and amazing. It was great to hear from the superstars that set the trends, and created the molds that many wrestlers today emulate. What was sad was the toll time has taken on Jimmy Garvin and Buddy Roberts. Michael Hayes still looks like he's in his prime compared to these two. The extras on disc one are also good. There is an especially detailed account of a plane crash by Gary Hart that was one of the craziest things I have ever heard. I am amazed that Vince McMahon and Co, has allowed so many non WWE'ers so much time to talk about the business and letting people admit that they created things that I believe Vince would like to lay claim to. I really enjoy hearing from veterans that truly love wrestling. No matter how many stories I hear, I enjoy hearing them all. Everyone has such interesting takes about what life was like in this crazy business.

Admittedly I have not watched the matches on this DVD. I am looking forward to them. With this purchase and the previously purchased Heroes of World Class dvd, you have a nice representation of a by-gone era. Any fan should love this collection the WWE did a hell of a job letting Kevin Von Erich tell his story.",1199145600,3,2097,4.374358974358974
2704967,5,B000LC3IKQ,"I must say that the New WWE dvd release the Von Erichs is well done but how could they justify giving 2 dvd,s to this dynasty when they gave 3 to some one so insignificant as Ray Mysterio Jr.,Its just not fair there should have been 3 or even maybe 4 dvd,s attached to this set. Unfortunately Vince McMahon now owns the rights to all the WCCW Tape Library that Kevin sold to him this year. If McMahon was smart he would put out a box set with every World Class Wrestling Show there was especially since Blue Ray discs can hold 8 times what a regular dvd can hold. I must say growing up with World Class in syndication here in South Jersey it was very emotional for me to watch the final moments of the dvd where they showed the Sportatorium and the music that went with it was erie. It brought a lump in my throat. If anyone knows what the music was called at the end of the dvd would you let me know.thanks

2704968,4,B000LC3IKQ,"In the early 1980's, World Class Championship Wrestling was on par with (and in many instances better) than the WWF, NWA, and AWA.  The Von Erich brothers were the major stars of the promotion and catapulted it to worldwide popularity.  This DVD gives a fairly balanced portrayal of WCCW and features some classic matches that provide a good overview of what the company was all about.  The eighties was a decade of excess, and never was it more evident than in the world of professional wrestling.  Guys lived wild lives, abusing drugs and alcohol, without thinking about what the consequences of their actions would be.  That was the downfall of WCCW, along with the failure of a promoter to forsake his old school ways and have a vision for the future.

This DVD brings back many great memories for an old school wrestling fan like me, who was able to experience all the great promotions that existed in the eighties.  It relives some of the great rivalries, has some great matches, and is filled with great extras such as the ""Badstreet USA"" music video that I thought that I would never see again.  However, it does not provide the viewer with some important facts, and it does not include some major matches.  I highly recommend Brian Harrison's superb ""Heroes of World Class"" DVD as a complement to this one to truly realize the full scope of this great promotion.

On the negative side, this WWE production does not mention most of the vital innovations that WCCW brought to wrestling, such as multiple camera angles, the handheld cameras, and microphones to make the wrestlers and matches larger than life.  It also only gives brief mention that WCCW was the first company to use entrance music.  It does not cover the death of Bruiser Brody, probably because the man who was responsible for it still probably works for the promotion that Carlito's father, Carlos Colon, owns. Many important wrestlers that came through the promotion also aren't mentioned or just barely mentioned (Devastation Inc., etc.)  Although the Freebirds were a big part of WCCW's success, this DVD gives them too much credit because Michael Hayes is a major player in the hierarchy of the WWE.  The VON ERICHS WERE THE HEART AND SOUL OF WORLD CLASS, and the company lived and eventually died with them.

The matches were great, especially the Kerry/Flair match from Star Wars '82, but there are many very important matches missing, which include:

David vs. Harley Race
David vs. Flair
David vs. Terry Gordy
Kevin vs. Flair
Kerry vs. Flair for the NWA Championship from the 1984 David Von Erich Memorial
Kerry and Kevin vs. Chris Adams and Gino Hernandez in a Hair Match
...and many more.

Hopefully, if the demand exists, the WWE will release more DVDs featuring these and many more classic WCCW matches.

Overall, this is a great DVD that gives a fair view of WCCW and provides a strong anti-drug message in WWE's own unique way.  The Von Erichs were superstars before wrestlers were superstars.  True, they were grown men that made their own decisions and suffered the consequences.  However, their blood lies in the hands of their own father, Jack Adkisson (Fritz Von Erich).  Had he been a better father, all of his sons might still be alive.  Had he been a smarter promoter, he would have forgone his old school mentality and let the promotion explode to what it could have become.  To those of you younger fans out there that are only familiar with the WWE, WCCW was just as big, more popular, and seen by many more people than all of the other promotions.  Watch this DVD and the ""Heroes of World Class"" DVD to truly know what a bad guy Fritz was and how one man can destroy many lives through bad decisions and not enough love for his own family.

In conclusion, if you are even a little interested in wrestling, buy both this and the ""Heroes of World Class"" DVD. You will get a brief glance of a significant organization that was wildly popular and revolutionized a business so much so that, nowadays, is a multi-billion dollar industry with millions of fans all over the world. Plus, you'll see great athletes perform, and you'll get a lesson that transcends all walks of life-drugs kill.",1198713600,5,4184,4.728650137741047
2704969,5,B000LC3IKQ,"I was pleasantly suprised to find WWE putting out a video for the classic Texas pro-wrestling organization, World Class Championship Wrestling.  As a man who grew up with the stories and legends portrayed in the video, I was hoping for something comparable or better than the other documentary, ""Heroes of World Class"".

The video was a fantastic and appropriate testimony of the powerful glory and tragic ending of World Class and its home team, the Von Erich family.  I was a huge fan of Kerry back in the day, and only the passage of time has allowed me to see the character flaws of my childhood hero.

The video is professionally done and not as dark as ""Heroes..."", but just as sad.  You can't tell the story of World Class without exploring the sad truths.  With Vince holding the keys to the most massive professional wrestling video vault, this is the definitive WCCW documentary.

Any Texan who grew up with the tradition of the von Erich's owes it to themselves to purchase this video.",1198627200,3,996,4.689655172413793
2704970,3,B000LC3IKQ,"I grew up in the Dalls/Ft. Worth area. I started watching Saturday Night Wrestling, on channel 11 in about 1978. This is before the stuff that most people in other parts of the country are familiar with. And I don't remember it being called WCCW. It was Southwest Championship Sports. It was a hugely popular show, running against Saturday Night Live in 10pm-12am time slot, kicking SNL's *ss. These were shot in Ft. Worth, on Monday nights I believe, and then shown on Saturday nights. Sometime around 1982 they started running a Sunday morning program on channel 39. Shot in Dallas on Friday nights, at the awesome Sportatorium. This is what most people are familiar with. This is what was syndicated around the country and on cable. And all these current releases focus on that very narrow time frame. While it was the most popular time of the Von Erich era, the earlier stuff was actually wilder in my opinion. And I remember Fritz Von Erich still wrestling on a semi-regular basis. I remember six-man tag teams with Fritz, Kevin, and David. And other wrestlers included many great stars fom surrounding promotions. People like Mil Mascaras, Tonga John, The Spoiler(who had his own version of the Claw), Ivan Putski, Cowboy Bob Ellis, Dale Valentine(aka Buddy Roberts), Junkyard Dog, Wahoo McDaniels, Al Madril, Jose Lathario, Bill Rathke, Gran Marcos,Armand Hussein,the Iron Shiek,Sweet Brown Sugar, Al Perez, Scott Casey,Rick McGraw, The Grapplers, Brickhouse Brown,and many others whose names I can't recall at the moment. There was always a good rotation of talent from the nearby promotions. And I vaguely remember visits by people like Dusty Rhodes, Tommy Rich, and of course Bruiser Brody and Abdullah the Butcher. And I always get excited when I hear that new stuff is going to be released, but it always turns out to be the same stuff. Most of these matches have been released in various forms. It would be nice to see a DVD of the more rare matches. The Kerry Von Erich vs. Ric Flair match is on just about every release for instance. But you never see the David Von Erich vs. Harley Race match. I have a tape with a highlight reel of that match and it was awesome. Why not release the whole thing? And were the Ch. 11 tapes included in the sale to WWE? And is there a chance that stuff will ever see the light of day? Or are they just going to keep re-releasing Von Erich/Freebird/Iceman King Parsons/Chris Adams/Jimmy Garvin stuff? And on the ch. 11 stuff Mark Lowrance does the commentary, not Bill Mercer. I like Lowrance better. And the ch. 11 suff was less gimmicky and a lot wilder.... Country Whipping Matches, Brass Knucks Matches, Battle Royals, etc.... That stuff was cool!!
