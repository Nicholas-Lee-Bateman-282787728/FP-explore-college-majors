8261974,1,B0016AKSKK,"Poor video, audio, & overal value.  Other available collections of the same SPIDER-MAN series are FAR, FAR better!  They feature Spidey's face on the covers, and usually include the face of another character in that string of episodes.",1504656000,,235,5.157894736842105
8261975,4,B0016AKSKK,"Its pitiful that we faithful Fans Of Ol Marvel cant get a complete DVD/Blueray release of SpiderMans various 1980s & 90s television episodes. This sporadic piece meal approach is expensive and really obliterates the narrative. So, what you have here are 3 episodes from the second season of the 199498 TV series. I say this cautiously as the content has been merged into one single presentation. I had to research online at TVShowsOnDVD to determine exactly which episodes were contained (see below), and though its been ages since Ive seen these shows, this sounds about right. Also, contained here are 2 bonus Iron Man episodes (ASIN: B0036EH3XO) from the mid90s when he had his own shortlived TV run.

* Neogenic Nightmare, Part 4: The Mutant Agenda (1995)
* Neogenic Nightmare, Part 5: Mutants' Revenge (1995)
* Neogenic Nightmare, Part 6: Morbius (1995)
* Iron Man to the Second Power, Part 1 (1994)
* Iron Man to the Second Power, Part 2 (1994)

Now as obscure as this listing is, it is a legitimate offering and not some DVDR creation. It was produced by the Canadian firm Morningstar Entertainment back in 2008, and reportedly contains parts 46 from that second season whose whole 14installment run was one continuous Neogenic story arc. I think the best way to describe the audio/visual quality is that its adequate. But understand, I grew up watching the original 67 Spidey series on a small black & white that had tin foil attached to its rabbit ears.

But you know, it was so much simpler back then. The hardships todays younger generations have to struggle with is awful. I mean, I clearly knew my purpose in life very early on and that was to get my father a beer, change the channel, and adjust the antennas for maximum reception. (Nope, nope, back the other way.) If you were born around the time of these wallcrawling episodes, raised on cable, and think anything less than HD is an offense to the natural order of the universe, this will probably disappoint. Me, this one disc satisfied my curiosity AND its the best DVD available that isn't all padded out with 1967 episodes (which I already own).

Since this Amazon listing offers so little, well, actually offers you nothing in the way of a product description, I offer this from the DVD packaging.

I was in high school when this show was on, so I missed out on it for the most part, but I must say as a full grown 37 year old man who just enjoys great story arcs, decent animation, and exuberant voice acting, the 90's Spider-Man series is a veritable treasure trove, and something any true Spidey fan simply can't afford to gloss over!",1434412800,6,421,4.275
