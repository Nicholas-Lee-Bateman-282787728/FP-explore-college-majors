327126,3,6301327705,"Orson Welles created some of the very best theatre, radio, and films in history, and is credited by almost everyone for making the #1 film of all time - ""Citizen Kane"" ( 1941). But somewhere along the line, early on, he started having problems with producers and studios, left projects unfinished, went over budget, and a whole host of problems that ultimately resulted in fewer and fewer films of lesser and lesser quality. By 1943, when this film was made, Welles was already in trouble and exhibiting many of the problems that would unhinge his career. Though his brilliance would always shine through even the shabbiest of projects he undertook, it became harder and harder to find. ""Journey into Fear"" is an example of this.

Several members of Welles' stock company appear in the film, including Joseph Cotton, Agnes Morehead, Everett Sloan,

Cotton was a close friend of Welles and appeared in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), ""Journey into Fear"" (1943), ""The Third Man"" (1949) and ""Touch of Evil (1958). He went on to star in such memorable films as ""Gaslight"" (1944), ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946) and ""Portrait of Jennie"" (1948), for which he won the Best Actor award at the Venice Film festival. Cotton does a great job as the munitions representative caught up in something he doesn't understand. His final remarks made sense for the 1940 novel from which it was taken, but for the 1943 film they seem strange.

Agnes Morehead earned 4 Academy Award nominations as Best Supporting Actress (""Magnificent Ambersons"", ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"", ""Johnny Belinda"", ""Mrs Parkington""), along with 6 Emmy nominations for her role in ""Bewitched"" and a win for a role in ""Wild Wild West"" (1965). She won two Golden Globes. She appeared with Welles in her film debut in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), and then in ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942), and ""Jane Eyre"" (1944). Morehead's accent in this film is disturbing. It isn't necessary, and the one she produces is really poor. Only Welles' accent in ""Lady from Shanghai"" is worse. In any event, Morehead isn't in the film long enough to make much of a difference.

Everett Sloane appeared in more than 100 films and TV programs and was part of the Orson Welles stock company. In fact his film debut was in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) as Mr. Bernstein and he appeared in this  film and ""Lady from Shanghai"" (1948). He transitioned to TV in the early 50s and was nominated for an Emmy in 1956 for his role in the ""Kraft Television Theatre"". Sloane is over the top in this film, as he was in all his Welles' films. But Sloan was able to be over the top and still turn in a great performance, as he did elsewhere and as he does here.

Richard Bennett was well known in the silent era. He played Major Amberson in Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942) and ""Journey"" was his last film. He died in 1944 at the age of 74. Bennett has a brief but memorable role as the laughing Captain.

Ruth Warrick made her film debut in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) as Kane's first wife. She went on to make more than a dozen films (although ""Journey"" was her last film with Welles) and then transitioned to TV where she had recurring roles in ""All My Children"" (1999 - 2005) as Phoebe and ""Peyton Place"" (1967-9) as Hannah Cord. She was nominated for an Emmy several times, but never won.

Dolores del Rio was a famous Mexican movie star who also made a mark in the U.S. Between 1946 and 1954 she won the Mexican Silver Ariel 3 times and was nominated twice more. She started in the silent era in 1925, and began a romance with Welles in 1940 when he moved to Hollywood to begin his film career. She does a good job in this film, making us wonder what exactly her agenda is.

The marvelous Hans Conried appears as a Magician (Welles himself was quite an accomplished Magician). He appeared in more than 200 films and TV shows. We know him best for his recurring roles as Uncle Tonoose in ""Make Room for Daddy"" (1956-63) and as the voice of Snidely Whiplash in the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons.

The villain of the piece is fat Jack Moss. He seems an unlikely villain as he listens to opera and worries about his appearance. But when he crushes a cracker in front of Cotton as they have dinner aboard the ship, and then devourers the soup, we know that Moss is up to the task. Moss was not an actor but a business associate of Welles and other actors.

The film is directed by Norman Foster, but Welles was also involved, although he was in a hurry to finish up and go to Brazil where he worked on the ill-fated ""It's All True"".  In addition, he was trying to put the finishing touches on ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" which he never did. Rumor has it that he was responsible for the first few minutes of the film, which are certainly interesting, and which, for the first time, offer action before the credits.

Foster was a friend of Welles, a sometimes actor, and director of more than 50 films including several Charlie Chan and several Mr. Moto films in the 30s. He transitioned to TV in the 50s where he was active in various Disney projects (Davy Crockett, Zorro, Hans Brinker)

Welles is generally credited as producer, although the film was released by RKO to fulfill his 4 film contract. The screenplay is credited to Joseph Cotton but he was assisted by Welles and Ben Hecht. The prodigious Hecht worked on more than 150 screenplays, was nominated 7 times, and won twice (""Underworld"" in 1927 and ""The Scoundrel"" in 1935). Other notable films he worked on include ""Scarface"" (1932), ""Front Page"" (1934), ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""Gunga Din"" (1939) and ""Notorious"" (1946). Hecht was known as ""The Shakespeare of the movies"" and rightly so.

The film was made in 1942 (based on a 1940 novel) when war time films were being churned out by the dozens - ""Casablanca"", ""In Which we Serve"", ""To Be or Not to Be"", ""Watch on the Rhine"", ""Lifeboat"", ""Forever and a Day"", ""Since You Went Away"", ""Hail the Conquering Hero"", etc. When they weren't specifically addressed to WW 2, they served a patriotic purpose, such as ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", ""The Pride of the Yankees"", and ""Meet me in St Louis."" In this context, ""Journey into Fear"" doesn't make a lot of sense, because its treatment of the war is tangential. Of course, Welles argued that the final film had little to do with his script and the editing by RKO changed it considerably. All things considered, this is probably true. During the editing of the film, Welles was fired by RKO.

The film is often identified as ""film noir"" but this is a mistake. While there are some noir elements (e.g., low lighting, unusual film angles, intricate plot, questions of betrayal, presence of rain and night shots) present, we are lacking the doomed hero and the femme fatale, both of which are essential to film noir.

Welles was interested in betrayal, especially male betrayal. We see this is ""Citizen Kane"" (Kane vs. Leland), in ""Macbeth"" (Macbeth vs. MacDuff), ""Othello"" (Iago vs. Othello), ""Touch of Evil"" (Quinlan vs. Menzies),""Lady from Shanghai"" (O'Hara vs. Bannister vs. Grisby), etc. Superimposed on this is a homoerotic element that is often subtle, but nonetheless present. Some suggest it can be seen in this film too.

The acting is OK. Certainly the main actors were all capable of far better performances, but they perform adequately (if not admirably) in this film. The story has several holes, probably due to the deletion by the studio of more than 20 minutes.

The film will appeal to fans of Welles, for historical if no other reasons. Fans of film noir will find it disappointing, although the camera work is interesting.",1273104000,5,7585,4.689473684210526
327127,5,6301327705,"""Well Mister Graham, you brought a weapon. Now what did you think you'd do with that?"" -- The German Agent

""I don't know. I just thought I'd bring it along."" -- A Chagrined Joseph Cotten

Exotic locations and another fine performance by the much underrated Joseph Cotten keep the viewer watching in this filming of Eric Ambler's popular wartime novel set in Turkey. Ben Hecht, Orson Welles, and Richard Collins reportedly all worked on the script, but Cotten himself received the final credit. For reasons too murky for many who have enjoyed this film, it has gotten a bad wrap over the years. It is another of those films with Orson Welles' fingerprints all over it, but as in the case of the others, he always denied helming much of it, giving the credit to Norman Foster. All of his gang is here, however, including Cotten and Moorehead, and his love at the time, gorgeous Mexican beauty Doloros del Rio.

American Howard Graham (Joseph Cotten) is writing his wife Stephanie (Ruth Warrick) a letter trying to explain how everything got so complicated as Journey Into Fear opens. He didn't really want to go with his company's representative or get involved with that exotic woman, and he especially didn't want to become the target of German agents and find himself on a rainy ledge with killers intent on delaying munition sales to allied forces. When Graham finds himself in the very real world of danger, however, rather than simply signing contracts for guns, he is a fish out of water, and must learn quickly how to swim, or sink to the bottom of the Black Sea.

Whisked away to an exotic Turkish nightclub where he meets the catsuit wearing Josette (Doloros del Rio), he finds himself called to the office of the notorious Colonel Haki when a magician in the club is killed by mistake. Welles gives another of those performances as the Colonel where you aren't quite sure if he's one of the good guys or not, and neither is Cotten's character. Graham is rushed aboard a ship bound for home for his own safety, leaving his wife behind at the hotel with only the assurances of Haki for comfort that she'll be fine. Naive in matters of real danger and intrigue, he finds himself getting closer to Josette when he discovers those out to kill him are onboard as well. Lonely and surprised at her receptiveness, he relies on her more when who he can trust becomes ever murkier.

Doloros del Rio was such a huge star during the silent era she was known as the female Valentino. Born into a wealthy family in Durango, Mexico, this second cousin to Ramone Navarro was full of beauty and passion which was not always displayed to great advantage once sound came along. In the early 1940's she found a new career in Mexican cinema, however, where she flourished in films often helmed by Emillo Fernandez. Reportedly the great love of Welles' life, she worked to help orphans in her later years. Unfortunately, she's mostly ornamental in Journey Into Fear, but viewers who never got the chance to see her in silent films or in Mexican cinema can catch a glimpse here, albeit in a supporting role.

The audience sympathizes with Cotten's character because as always, he is just like us. An offer he isn't sure he can refuse culminates in a daring escape and Graham heaves a sigh of relief, believing he has eluded the killers. But he'll find a surprise waiting once he reaches his wife, and Haki may not be able to save him on a rainy ledge with two men bent on destroying him. While this film doesn't offer edge of your seat thrills, it is fun to watch, and almost impossible not to enjoy. Cotten is just terrific once again and shows the reason why a genius like Welles thought so highly of him. A film that comes in just under 70 minutes, it is never boring and you find yourself rooting for the naive American to get home to his wife before anyone can nab him. Despite the fact that Welles would part company with RKO after this film, it is quite entertaining when viewed today.",1271894400,4,3979,4.597183098591549
327128,3,6301327705,"The operatic approach of adding a musical dimension to menace with a killer-theme on the soundtrack has been greatly used in Orson Welles' glorious suspense film, ""Journey Into Fear,"" where the little killer obsessively played a scratchy old 78 rpm disc of someone singing ""Chagrin d'Amour.""

The assassin was short and fat; his belly large, his chin and neck flabby... I do not recall him having a line of dialog to speak... But the whole film was spread with heightened menace when he sat, his little round eyes blank behind his little round pebble lenses, listening compulsively to the atrociously scratchy record, confusing the words of the song at the wrong speed, the needle jumping from groove to groove; his nerve-ends, unlike ours, immune to the discordance...

This was a spy thriller set in the wartime Near East, about an innocent American engineer (Joseph Cotten), pursued by Nazi agents and blundering from danger to danger without seeming to know too much of what it was all about...It was essentially a hunter-and-hunted story, with settings that were often seedy but always exotic...

The opening was in Istanbul, the climax in Batum, and all the terrors between were forced claustrophobically between the low ceilings and narrow partitions of a neglected little steamer plowing the Black Sea...

""Journey Into Fear"" lives for its portrait gallery, its atmosphere, and for Welles' touches and excesses...",1233619200,3,1421,5.165217391304348
327129,4,6301327705,"Dark atmosphere and claustrophobic effects dominate this Orson Welles adaptation of the Eric Ambler novel about munitions smuggling in Turkey. It's spy vs. spy as a band of Nazi sympathizers attempts to bump off American dealer Joseph Cotten. The acting, mostly by Welles's Mercury Theatre gang, is very good, especially Cotten. The action, however, generally fails to build; even the chase scenes - one on the ledge of a hotel building in a driving rainstorm - seem uncharacteristically bland for Welles. Filled with quirky camera angles and stylistic experimentation, the movie still manages to disappoint in the long run: one expects more from this masterful crew.",1170460800,2,667,5.30188679245283
327130,3,6301327705,"In film school people in the row behind me would whisper that this was one of several films ""secretly directed"" by Orson Welles, who stars in the movie as Colonel Haki with a preposterous Istanbul accent with the stress on the last syllable of each word.  He tries to steal the whole show, for he seems to have had a compulsion to wipe every other actor off the screen.  However this movie has so many hams that none of them budges an inch.  You only have to watch a scene or two to believe the back row gossip, for so much of it feels like you're seeing a really inferior Orson Welles production, and the actors are the same ones you only see in Welles' movies!  Oh, I suppose Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead were all over the place in the 1940s, not just in the Mercury Theater, but scanning the faces of those bit players is like going through the Mercury High School Yearbook.

People say Norman Foster couldn't have directed this because all he did before were cheesy Charlie Chan movies.  Well, I have news for them, those Chan programmers are excellent!  I look forward to seeing some of the Foster Chans newly restored to DVD (RENO, PANAMA, TREASURE ISLAND, not a dud among them.  Hope JOURNEY INTO FEAR makes it back, too, to its full length, with all the cut scenes restored, especially the rumored ""Brief Encounter""-style almost-love scenes between Joseph Cotten's salesman character and the cabaret artist ""played"" by Dolores del Rio.  The picture opens up with Ruth Warrick and Joseph Cotten, the Grahams, forcibly separated in a Middle East hotel.  For some reason Howard Graham just takes off with Everett Sloane, a business associate, the kind of nut who makes Peter Lorre look sober as a judge, without a second thought to how his wife will get home by herself from Turkey to America -- during wartime.

It seems like a facile excuse to free Cotten up and warm him up for Del Rio's vamp act.  However with the movie chopped up as is, she postures with hideous makeup and he stays notably cool, as though she wasn't a sex bomb and he wasn't afraid for his life.  Moorehead plays a Xanthippe shrew of a wife aboard a rundown freighter, and Frank Readick does a stalwart job in a thankless role you've seen a zillion times before, the henpecked schlub who finally grows some balls.

It's hard to believe that Welles & Company set out to make a film whose hero works for an armament and munitions manufacturer?  Why glorify guns in 1943, well, maybe they were making some kind of hardhitting statement.  The movie is fairly faithful to Eric Ambler's often praised novel, but have you ever noticed, has a really good movie ever been made out of any Ambler novel (or script)?  If you ask me, in that family it was Joan Harrison who had all the talent.",1145318400,6,2764,4.551515151515152
327131,2,6301327705,"In strict technical terms I suppose Journey Into Fear qualifies as film noir. For my likings though it's a stretch. The genius of Welles aside, the movie while providing much of the Noir technique lacks a bit of the heart and soul that defines it. Not that Journey has to be Noir, but the movie is dished up as such. A wet dark street in Nowhere USA with an embittered protagonist, well, I guess I can't get enough of that. To each they're own--I got tired of the boat and the weak protagonist Cotton early in the game. And the antagonist, could he have been more obvious? If your range for this era of film is far and wide, and you tend toward technique over mood, and over suspense, you'll probably be OK with Journey. It missed my target though.",1103414400,,748,4.35

Orson Welles plays a blustering Turkish general who takes the American under his wing, perhaps protecting him, perhaps sending him to his doom.  Placed on a cramped ocean liner, Cotton soon finds himself stalked by a variety of goons: which are the good guys and which are the baddies?  Can you take the tension 'til you find out??",1040342400,9,657,5.130841121495327
327133,4,6301327705,"Although credited to Norman Foster, and co-written by Joseph Cotton, Welles infact ""supervised"" (i.e. controlled) most of this production.  What we get is a tight and very compact (barely over an hour in length) thriller.
Joseph Cotton plays an Engineer who someone is trying to assasinate.  Trapped on a steamship crosing the black sea, he avoids attempts on his life (several of them by Welle's real life business manager, Jack Moss).
Think of ""Journey..."" as a practice run for ""Touch Of Evil"" and ""The Third Man"" (I know he didn't direct it but you'll see the similarities). The humour is broader, the dialogue not quite as sophisticated, but it is still Welles at work.  While not a major work of Art, it is still a masterpiece of craft.
The Camera-work, as usual, is brilliant -- partucularly the interiors of the steam-ship.  Welle's always worked his cameramen hard, forcing them to new heights; lighting rooms ""without light"", and building sets with ceilings (not a popular practice in the forties).  It pays off -- the clautrophobia on board the ship is extreme, and Cotton is excellent as it's primary sufferer.  Naturally the camera angles have Welles' innovative stamp all over them.
If you're a Welles fan, ""Journey Into Fear"" is an absolute must see; a nice precurser (thematically, chronologically,  and cinematically) to ""The Stranger"".
And if you're not a Welle's fan, then you should give your corneas to someone more deserving.
PS:
Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any plan for releasing this lost gem on DVD any time soon.  A shame, since ""Journey Into Fear"" (with it's short running time) would make an excellent double bill DVD with another Welles film (The Stranger, for example).",1003968000,27,1710,4.996478873239437

The lead character is hard to root for, as he never gets involved more than he has to, and the tension doesn't build enough to the climax.

This is an adaption of Eric Ambler's novel about a man who travels to a foreign country for employment. His job involves the defense industry (this makes him a target for those who seek to prevent an upgraded defense). How did they know this? That's what they pay spies for.

It is an introduction to what should have been a simple job for a defense contractor. Travel to a foreign country to work on a project still goes on today. But another country who would be adversely affected by this project sought to eliminate Graham. It would mean a delay, but that would be as effective as halting a project. The book goes into details that were eliminated in a simplified movie version.

I recommend reading the book first so you can appreciate the changes made in this movie. Some background details were changed to meet the politics of the time. The movie is as good as the book given its time limitations.

7811408,4,6301327705,"Sound like a good title for a horror movie right? Also it must be a good title for a World War II espionage thriller, since that is what this movie is. The screenplay is co-written by Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten (who both star in the film) from the novel by Eric Ambler. Most of the cast from the Mercury Theater (Welles's troupe that did the War of the Worlds radio broadcast and Citizen Kane) play the various characters, so the acting is top notch. Welles is a little bit hammy in his role as a corrupt Turkish cop but not too much. Cotten as Howard Graham is the star of the show.

Graham works for an American weapons manufacturer and is in Istanbul on his way home from a conference. He's met by the company's local Turkish agent, who browbeats him into going out for some drinks, leaving Graham's wife at the hotel. At the seedy cabaret they visit, Graham is dragged up on stage for a magician's act. The lights go out and a shot is fired. The magician is dead; everyone gets dragged off to the local constabulary to get things sorted. Here, Graham meets Colonel Haki (Welles), who recognizes that the bullet was meant for the ""arms dealer"" (as everyone else thinks of Graham) and decides Graham needs to leave town by the midnight boat rather than the morning train with his wife. Otherwise he won't escape the Gestapo assassin who is after him. He's still worried about his wife but Haki says he'll reassure her and get her to meet him at the boat's next port of call. Graham reluctantly agrees. He meets some of the performers from the cabaret on board. Who can Graham trust and did the assassin make it on the boat too?

This is an interesting though not great thriller about the Nazi menace. The story is more built around the cat-and-mouse pursuit of Graham and the tension is built around the question of who can be trusted. The ending is a bit of Hollywood standard fare but doesn't ruin the film. At 69 minutes long, a lot is packed into a short running time.",1346112000,2,1978,4.431318681318682
