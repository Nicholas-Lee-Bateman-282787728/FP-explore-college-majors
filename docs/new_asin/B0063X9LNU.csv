4948634,5,B0063X9LNU,"I hope you can buy the Blu-ray version of this, it is INCREDIBLE! Jason Lisle is one of the most sound scientists in this era and this disc shows the planatarium show he created. Gather the family around the tube when you watch this one, all ages will enjoy this video.",1354060800,11,269,4.294117647058823
4948635,1,B0063X9LNU,"This is truly the worst act of propaganda for something that has been dealt with, and discarded, by science. In fact, it is nothing but the ridiculous cry of a dying theological misunderstanding of science. I only hope that people who see this actually look up the facts and learn something that isn't dictated to them by their religion.",1398729600,33,337,4.728813559322034
4948636,1,B0063X9LNU,"Not science.  At all.  As in, zero.  Which is fine, except it's PRETENDING to be science.  Which makes it not-fine.  Avoid like that small-minded plague that it is.",1398556800,39,164,4.714285714285714
4948637,1,B0063X9LNU,There's nothing else to say. This is religious propaganda that is trying to hide by twisting science around it. Complete waste of time if you hope to actually learn something.,1396828800,46,175,4.866666666666666
4948638,1,B0063X9LNU,"This edition is so cute, just like sponge bob square pants!  Dr. of what? I assume Dr. Lisle does not have a degree in astronomy or physics or never learnt the scientific method.",1395878400,27,178,4.393939393939394
4948639,1,B0063X9LNU,"This is not science, folks.  Give it a pass and go get the New Cosmos, a Space-time Odyssey with Neil DeGrasse Tyson.",1395792000,38,117,4.318181818181818
4948640,1,B0063X9LNU,"This is not science. This is creationism and creationism is NOT science. Science gives us the ability to predict outcomes, something that creationism is not able to do. Please understand the difference.",1395792000,40,202,5.34375
4948641,5,B0063X9LNU,"""In the beginning GOD...""  This video does an excellent job of displaying the vastness of space and the incomprehensible distances to the stars.  This excited my soul and made and humbled me even more in the presence of the ALMIGHTY!  Thank GOD for sending Jesus to shed His blood to pay the debt that none of us could ever pay!  I am thrilled in my soul to be able to serve one who is capable of speaking all into existence!  PRAISE HIS HOLY NAME!",1380499200,6,448,4.285714285714286
4948642,5,B0063X9LNU,I have watched this 20 minute DVD numerous times.  It is breathtaking.  It really gives an appreciation for the power and majesty of God.  It places life in perspective by showing the contrast between this life and eternity. I highly recommend.,1370131200,8,244,4.902439024390244
4948643,5,B0063X9LNU,This DVD is so awe-inspiring!  Praise the Lord for the cosmos he created and the blessing this DVD will be to all those who see it!,1362873600,8,131,4.038461538461538
4948644,5,B0063X9LNU,"I got this DVD after seeing the show at a planetarium. If you liked Powers of 10, this is in the same category. The scale of the universe is depicted in breathtaking detail, wonderfully illustrated. The DVD has a great commentary track describing some of the behinds the scenes work required to program the simulation. I showed this with a projector to a bunch of high school student, about 20 feet across on the side of a building and they were equally impressed. It is pretty short, though, less than 30 min.",1361923200,8,510,4.554347826086956
8492298,5,B0063X9LNU,Great intro to astronomy for kids! To show them the immensity of space! Nice and short but every moment makes your kids and you go wide eyed in awe! Homeschool essential!,1520467200,,170,4.516129032258065
8492299,5,B0063X9LNU,Good product. Would order again.,1457481600,2,32,5.6
8492300,5,B0063X9LNU,"Very scientific presentation of the cosmos. Whether one agrees with intelligent design or primordial soup, this video does a great job of explaining the vastness of the Universe. If it has a flaw, the image quality could be enhanced, outside of that it is great.",1438819200,,262,4.844444444444444
8492301,1,B0063X9LNU,"So you're Christian.  Great, you can still embrace your community and dismiss absurd notions presented here.  Christianity doesn't have to be associated with stupidity, but it will continue this way if one more person watches this garbage.",1418860800,2,239,5.4324324324324325
8492302,5,B0063X9LNU,It's hard to find material and information about the glorious heavens that God created that aren't trying to force evolution down our throats. Answers in Genesis delivers us a breathtaking view and commentary that gives glory to our Creator while teaching us all about the mastery of creation. We have the DVD already but the quality of the video was grainy for some reason. I bought the bluray in hopes that the video is cleaned up. This is a MUST have for every Young Earth Creationist home. Also worth a watch for those who either don't believe or are on the fence about evolution and the idea of an old universe.,1414368000,9,616,4.558558558558558
8492303,1,B0063X9LNU,"I hate this for one very simple reason.  Not that I've seen it, it's religion masquerading as science and not worth my time to investigate.  Much like the billboards claiming to care about poor pregnant women, but are actually nothing more than groups set up specifically to scare women away from having an abortion (every street in Texas has one of these billboards) this video exists merely obfuscate the truth of science and prop up the dying embers of religion in a scientific age.

No, the reason I hate this video, the presence of this video in my search results, is that I specifically went looking for ""Cosmos Carl Sagan"". I didn't want to get false results for Neil Degrasse Tyson's new show (not that I don't love it too) what I wanted was to see the purchasing options for Carl Sagan's PBS program.  Instead of finding a good offering for the real program, I'm offered this schlock in its place.

I missed Cosmos when it was originally broadcast because the backwater of Kansas that I grew up in didn't have access to public television.  We had churches on nearly every street corner, but only one tiny library.  Cable was a new invention.  By weird coincidence the cable company took over the Kingdom Hall across the street from my home in that small town, which was a great relief to us since the Jehovah's Witnesses stopped at our house every time they went canvassing. While we couldn't afford to buy cable services, at least we were no longer disturbed by people who wanted to pass on their twisted message of god on a nearly daily basis. No computers, no internet.  Only country radio and two fuzzy TV channels we could pick up with an aerial.

I'm reasonably certain that the idyllic setting I'm describing is something that the liars who created & marketed this program on Amazon including the keywords ""Cosmos Carl Sagan"" would greatly prefer over the current ability to find accurate information regarding the natural universe and what we really know about it.  That they would give up not only blu-rays and Amazon, the current technological marvels of cell phones, electric cars, wind turbines, etc; all of science, medicine and progress. Give it all up and go live in caves clad only in the skins of animals that they had to kill themselves, if only they could be assured that their bronze-age god was real.

To them I say ""go find your cave and give up your comfortable cotton clothing. Hand over your cell phones and your comfortable air conditioned houses. You do not deserve to benefit from the achievements of science, since you hold it in so little regard."" Either that, or pull this offering from the marketplace and apologize to the memory of Carl Sagan for ever creating it in the first place, much less placing it on Amazon falsely linked to his name.",1414281600,,2784,4.682377049180328
8492304,5,B0063X9LNU,Absolutely awesome view of our place in the universe!,1413849600,6,53,5.0
8492305,1,B0063X9LNU,"How can a great nation like America be full of so many gullible idiots? Pick up a book written by an actual scholar or scientist, you know, those people who actually know what they are talking about.",1402444800,12,199,4.405405405405405
8492306,1,B0063X9LNU,"Rubbish in its purest form. Trying to imitate Carl Sagan makes them end up looking like fools.

The makers of this rubbish aren't fit enough to pick Carls dogs poo.",1401753600,26,164,4.466666666666667
8492307,5,B0063X9LNU,Very scientific video with tons of information- it is from a perspective that God created everything amazingly and perfectly! I have a Masters of Science and I highly recommend!!,1401321600,11,178,5.172413793103448
