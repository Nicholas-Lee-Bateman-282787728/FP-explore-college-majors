8267891,4,B0017ZG71S,"These are the only episodes I've seen of HIPPY GOURMET, since I don't believe the series ever aired on my local PBS TV station. I stumbled across the DVDs on Amazon and ordered this Vancouver one because I was studying Canada at the time. And there is a significant amount about Vancouver on these 4 episodes, including a tour of an aquarium, street scenes, and, since the series is mainly about food, prominent restaurants of the city. The restaurants shown are interesting to see and are a natural part of touring Vancouver in any case. To justify the ""Sustainable"" part of the title, several of the restaurants discuss ways they are helping with environmental efforts, such as by acquiring fish that are sustainably managed so as not to cause depletions. There is also a book entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hippy-Gourmet-s-Quick-and-Simple-Cookbook-for-Healthy-Eating/dp/B002OFVNMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hippy Gourmet's Quick and Simple Cookbook for Healthy Eating</a>&nbsp;(available in both Kindle and paperback editions) that accompanies the TV series, so I'll end up getting that too probably. Both the TV series and the book emphasize foods that are natural, organic, and usually vegetarian, although fish is also used in some recipes. In any case, these 4 episodes of HIPPY GOURMET - SUSTAINABLE VANCOUVER TOUR are quite enjoyable, both for the food aspect as well as for sight-seeing in that interesting Canadian city. I would not really recommend getting this DVD if you're ONLY interested in seeing Vancouver, but if you're interested in BOTH the city and some of its food, then I DO recommend this.",1313884800,,1677,5.580392156862745
