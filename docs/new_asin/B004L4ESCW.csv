8433797,5,B004L4ESCW,"Love this series!  After staying home and taking care of family and home a woman gets a plum job at a wonderful book company.  The next day her husband turns up as the new sales and marketing director and the fun begins!  Company policy does not allow family members to work together (so they keep their marriage a secret) and hubby keeps getting ""hit on"".  Totally love this comedy and watch the whole series at least once a year and still laugh out loud at it!",1418774400,,462,4.337209302325581
