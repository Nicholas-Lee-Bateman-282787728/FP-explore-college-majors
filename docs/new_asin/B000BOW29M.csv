8090300,4,B000BOW29M,"Okay, so this isn't the *best* background video I've ever seen, but it's really quite nice and relaxing. There are no true ""waterfalls"" as such, but the sight of gently rippling water cascading over the beautiful red rocks of Sedona, Arizona are vey nice background viewing.",1247961600,,274,4.978260869565218
8090301,4,B000BOW29M,"This DVD appears to be ten different views of an Arizona creek:  three small waterfalls, six views of water rushing over stones, and a long shot of the creek and neighboring buttes.  The camera remains stationary within each selection, and each selection continuously loops after 8 to 10 minutes of play (with a slight hiccup).  Both the video and audio portions are sharp and clear, and I was glad to find that the soundtrack is only of the sound of rushing water  --  no distracting bird calls.

My guess is this DVD was produced solely as a relaxation DVD, so that viewers looking for a variety of spectacular waterfalls should look elsewhere.  For relaxation purposes, these modest waterfalls and creek views do the job nicely.

Selecting a view from the menu was a bit of a problem.  On the computer the DVD played flawlessly and allowed me to select any of the ten views.  Using my DVD player and its remote was more of a problem:  sometimes I had to fast-forward to get to a particular selection that I couldn't reach via remote command.

Bottom line:  Well worth $9.95 for relaxation purposes.",1154044800,,1101,4.671875
8090302,1,B000BOW29M,"Very disappointed with this dvd. I could have done better with my own video camera. Waterfall scenes are very poor(looks more like water running over some rocks). Not very interactive, you cant do much more than placy an individual scene, no playlist, etc. I have bought much better scenic dvds for the same price. I expected better based on their description. If you really want something better try vat19.com ambient dvds.",1137024000,,424,4.985915492957746
