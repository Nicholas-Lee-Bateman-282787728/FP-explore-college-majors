7799636,5,1593121148,"This movie is fabulous.  I borrowed a friend's copy to preview and was so glad to find it offered on Amazon.  This is a great movie that is made with interesting narrators and clips from popular Christian films.  I purchased it to show my 6th grade Religious Ed class since we are learning about the Old Testament.  While this has scenes from the new testament (Nativity, Jesus, John the Baptist, Pentecost) is very detailed on the Old Testament (Genesis, Abraham, Moses, etc.) and perfect to support the instruction for this year.  Very good quality movie with great visuals and sound and is divided into 12 chapters.  Highly recommended.",1347667200,,639,4.87037037037037
7799637,5,1593121148,"I bought this video to use for a Bible Basics Sunday School class I'm teaching. There are a couple things that I really appreciate about the video:
1. The quality of the acting and video work is good. It doesn't come off as goofy or cheesy.
2. The narrators are diverse in appearance and speak clearly and slowly--perfect if you are showing the DVD to  an international audience with non-native English speakers.
3. The film accurately and clearly portrays the main theme of ""His Story"" through the major events of the Old Testament and the life of Christ. It doesn't get sidetracked by small details which are not necessary to the main point of God's message of salvation.
4. The DVD is broken up into chapters and the chapters are divided into smaller sections. This makes the DVD very easy to use in small portions (for example as an introduction of the day's topic at the beginning of class)

The only negative things I have to say about the video are that I wish the actors used for acting out scenes like Adam and Eve were not all caucasian. Historically, this is inaccurate, and it may unnecessarily lead to false assumptions about Christianity being a western or white mans' religion.",1234742400,13,1192,4.671428571428572
