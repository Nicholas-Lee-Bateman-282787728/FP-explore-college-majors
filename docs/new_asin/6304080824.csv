7860954,3,6304080824,"Item and seller were fine, but...maybe it was the folly of youth but I rememberrf this film as being much better than it actually is. Is it me, or does the life of a supermodel seem downright boring? And, there is way too much Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss in this film for my taste, obnoxious and silly b_tches.",1510272000,,311,4.288135593220339

7860956,5,6304080824,"I'm very happy with the product (Catwalk on VHS).  It was received much earlier than expected - at least two weeks earlier.  Even though it's an older VHS tape, the picture is clear.  I still hold my breath when I watch it because I'm afraid that, because it's an older tape, it will start to buckle inside the cassette and will be beyond repair, and ruin my VCR. (That's happened to me before.)  I just wish Catwalk was available on DVD.  I would purchase items from the seller again and, right now, am very happy with the product.",1336176000,,532,4.387755102040816
7860957,4,6304080824,"Yes they are overpaid. Yes they are overrated...but then again, who wouldn't give their right arm just to be one of them for a day. Catwalk is an engrossing look at a top model going through one season of shows. It would've been more fascinating if the documentary had focused on some no-name lesser known model fighting her way thru the industry to get recognized...but there are some amazing moments in this documentary - primarily John Galliano's show where the models are reminiscent of Russian Princesses in sweeping ballgowns running down the runway like they are being chased to the sounds of ""Ride of the Valkyaries"" -- the Malcolm McClaren soundtrack is beautiful (you can buy it - called PARIS) - all in all interesting to sit through, but wish there was a bit more depth to the nitty gritty of the industry - i felt as if it was a bit too romanticized.",1107820800,3,863,4.6103896103896105
7860958,5,6304080824,"The video documentary ""CATWALK"" is way better then it should be. Beautifully shot, great Malcolm Mclauren soundtrack, all the supermodels.  This video stars the freakishly beautiful supermodel Christy Turlington and takes place when Supermodels ruled the world and lived the lives of rockstars (witness some lady telling Christy, ""We Love you Christy"" on the way to a fashion show.
Christy takes us behind the scenes to a life of a supermodel during the fashion weeks in Milan, Paris, and NYC. She takes us to 5 star Hotels, Nightclubs, and house parties with other supermodels.
Ms. Turlington doesnt show any of the darker sides of the modeling industry, which is the only thing missing from this film. But, this documentary is wonderful journey that show us a side of Christy, Naomi Campbell, and Kate Moss that is rarely seen by the public.",1085529600,7,843,4.9787234042553195
7860959,5,6304080824,"Should I be embarrased to say I found this documentary completely engrossing?  From the initial cover shoot at Versace to the closing shots of Christy T. sitting for a Francisco Clemente portrait (it's haunting and beautiful -- he's the artist that did the artwork for the movie ""Great Expectations"" BTW), I was glued to this movie.  The soundrack includes ""St. Germain"" by Malcolm McClaren, which I love, during the Paris collections.  Many parts are beautifully shot in black and white.  Some great moments go by quickly: a really funny exchange between Christy and model Veronica Webb, Kate Moss drunk at a club in Milan, behind the scenes at Galliano (""Think Irving Penn, Irving Penn!!""), ALT commenting on the same collection (""This man HAS NO MONEY!""), Christy eyeballing Naomi's gift flower bouquet at the Georges V (""Is hers bigger than mine?""), the whole documentary is full of great stuff.",1062979200,5,899,5.054054054054054
7860960,4,6304080824,"If you're not into fashion scene, steer clear from this one. If you're into the fashion scene or have a curiosity about the world of the supermodels, you'll luv this. Yes, sometimes it gets a bit dull, but some of the behind the scene footage is incredible. Trust me, it's so worth it! If u can find it, buy it. I got my copy from ebay, and believe me I'm holding on to it!",971654400,5,373,4.054054054054054
7860961,5,6304080824,"AMAZING, this movie is definately for those who posess a deep interest for the fashion industry. Weather it be the models, the clothes or the designers you are interested in, this movie caters for all. It is true when they say this movie captures the end of an era. The era of the 'supermodels' has come to an end and 'catwalk' definately captures this classic era. Christy Turlington inspires and captivates veiwers with her stunning looks and enchanting charcter. Catwalk captures the intoxicating auora of the fashion world... i have watched it literally 30 times.",970963200,5,567,4.978947368421053
7860962,5,6304080824,"CHRISTY TURLINGTON IS WONDERFUL IN THIS BIO OF HER ADVENTURES DURING FASHION WEEK.  I PARTICULARLY ENJOYED THE JEAN PAUL GAULTIER AND JOHN GALLIANO COLLECTIONS, PLUS THE CATTY CONVERSATION BETWEEN CHRISTY AND  VERONICA WEBB WHENEVER THEY SPOKE(THERE WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING BETWEEN  THE LINES).
