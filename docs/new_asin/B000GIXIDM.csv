2614581,5,B000GIXIDM,"First of if you love really technical sound, great choregraphed and timed wrestling moves done by semi pro women this is for you. This DVD is great, women who can ACTUALLY WRESTLE, FOR REAL! If you are looking for so called womens wrestlers trying to get by on looks and sell more T&A, this ain't it. This is not the WWE Divas or the so-called TNA Knockouts, although Beth Phoenix, who wrestles in this DVD, did make an appearance on a WWE taping twice. There are a few very good looking ladies in the DVD with great bodies as well, I kinda like Shantell Taylor, Cheerleader Melissa, Christi Ricci, and Beth Phoenix, I like a full figured, muscular woman with a nice face and great T&A assets ! But to each his own. This DVD concentrates on women who can wrestle and who can give great showings of talent exhibition. These ladies pull off great moves and holds plus they sell the reactions and emotions to the crowd. This is Vol 1 there are actually 5 volumes already out to date that you can get at the Ring of Honor wrestling website. This is a breath of fresh air for me as a true wrestling fan. A must have if you are tired of novelty womens wrestling.",1163289600,3,1156,4.331797235023042
2614582,5,B000GIXIDM,"When I saw the price of this DVD, I couldn't believe it. I spent a lot more for this DVD and it is a STEAL!  You will not find a better DVD when it comes to legitimate ladies wrestling. If you are thinking that women's wrestling is what is on Monday Nights, then you are in for a big surprise. This is a major step in the right direction. The Sara Del Rey VS Mercedes Martinez & Lacey VS Daizee Haze matches alone are worth the cost of this DVD. And there is a whole lot more. I know this will come as a shock, but some of Shimmer's matches are BETTER than those served on USA or THE CW, and I include the men. Shimmer is just over one year old. It is getting more popular by the day. If you are willing to give these ladies a chance, then you will appreciate how hard they work and how they provide a good wrestling style. I have, and this DVD makes me believe that this product will last quite awhile. Highly recommended!",1163203200,6,923,4.043715846994536

8133124,5,B000GIXIDM,"In late 2005 SHIMMER Women's Athletes debuted in Berwyn, revolutionising women's wrestling in North America. It's no secret that women's wrestling had lost a lot of credibility and respect among the wrestling fans; as a result of the product that the WWE shoved down our throats. Whether it was the hiring of a bunch of models with as much wrestling ability as a wooden spoon, or the just downright embarrassing gravy bowl, bra & panties and lingerie pillow fights, the WWE women's division was and still is a joke. Admittedly, the division no longer has toned down in that area (the only positive thing of the PG rating it would seem) and there are thankfully no more Diva Searches. However, women's wrestling in the WWE sucks. And that is coming from a women's wrestling fan.

After growing tired of that rubbish, I soon tuned into the TNA Knockouts and fell in love with women's wrestling once again, and soon realised that Trish Stratus and Lita were not the greatest female wrestlers ever as the WWE would have you believe. The TNA Knockouts are awesome IMO but there is something better out there if you're a women's wrestling fan..... and that's SHIMMER.

SHIMMER is an all woman wrestling promotions, which boast some of the best women's wrestling that I've seen since the glory days of Manami Toyota and Aja Kong in the early 90's. I guess I should mention that SHIMMER is filmed in front of a very small audience in a little club with no pyro or some fancy lights show. But honestly, when the wrestling is good who really cares where it's at? The production values get better and better up the volumes anyway.

SHIMMER is not only a place where the best female wrestlers get a chance to showcase their superior skills, but a lot of new, less experienced women are given the chance to show what they can do in a wrestling ring which leads into my only gripe with the organisation. I have no quarrel with SHIMMER giving the younger talent the opportunity to wrestle, but this unfortunately results in a lot of sub-par matches. Granted, not everyone can be as good as a Sara Del Rey or a Cheerleader Melissa, but there is a clearly a massive difference between the main even level stars and the under card, which often drags down the volumes. Nevertheless, there's at least 1 match every volume which is fantastic.

Volume 1 opens with Tiana Ringer vs Shantelle Taylor (also known as Taylor Wilde in TNA). This was a good little opener with some flashy wrestling thrown in. The opening moments of the match were the best with some nice work with Taylor outsmarting and out wrestling Tiana. After about 8 minutes, the finish came when Taylor delivered a missile dropkick to Tiana. Fine for an opener **

Next match is a tag team bout with the team of Nikki Roxx (Roxxi Laveaux in TNA) & Cindy Rogers vs Team Blondage - Krissy Vaine (briefly worked in WWE, not sure of her name their though) & Amber O'Neal. Team Blondage played their characters to a T however the match itself was nothing special. Team Blondage won after about 12 minutes whilst cheating on a pin attempt. Not very good. *1/4

Ariel vs Rain (Peyton Banks in TNA) This was a decent little match which saw Rain work over Ariel's back throughout. A few nice moves thrown in including a variety of suplexes and such. In the end Rain fell to Ariel after she hit her finisher the Dariel (an ace cutter). Decent. **

Lexie Fyfe vs Christie Ricci - Again this was nothing special. Both wrestlers were quite sloppy and nothing about either of them stood out in the slightest. Fyfe won after hitting a TKO. *1/2

In case the low star ratings are putting you off this DVD, I'm only reviewing the matches from a wrestling standpoint - male or female. I feel that many people tend to overrate women's matches because they are women and are ""not as good"" as the men. I don't think I've ever seen a women's match in the WWE go above 3 stars and a 3 star match in the 'E is very very rare, if existing at all. So although the ratings I have given may seem low,they probably the same ratings that the diva matches would get. Now on to the reason why SHIMMER is frickin' awesome...

Cheerleader Melissa (Raisha Saeed & Alissa Flash in TNA) vs MsChif - This being the first of many good matches in SHIMMER's 4 year history. This match is better than any women's match in the WWE and definitely the best on the disc thus far. This is also the first match between the two, which would result in a full blown violent feud. There are some sick spots on this match, most notable the now infamous bending MsChif in half and forcing her to kick herself in the back of her head! Sick! Also at one point Melissa bends the 'Chif over the steel barricades and rams her back first into the ring post, then later continuing her assault on the back with a nice sitout powerbomb. MsChif also gets some nice moments as she hits her patented double-stomps in the corner and a springboard moonsault. The match ends when MsChif counters out of Melissa Kudo Driver and hits her with the Desecrator (a modified DDT which is awesome) at 15 minutes. Good Stuff. ***

Allison Danger (who also does the commentary for the DVDs) vs Beth Phoenix. And yes this is the same Beth Phoenix although she plays a completely different character here which is refreshing to see. Not as a good as the proceeding match, as this had a completely different tone to it being more fun with a few comedy spots thrown in there which I won't describe here. There was some decent wrestling thrown there as well which made for an entertaining match but not exactly a classic. **1/2

Sara Del Rey vs Mercedes Martinez - wow. The first classic SHIMMER match right here. This was the first time either had faced each other, and what a first time encounter it was. This had a great balance of technical wrestling, stiff strikes and high impact maneuvers. Both ladies hit each other with everything they had and it resulted in a fantastic match up that needs to be seen. In the closing moments of the match, Martinez hit her Fisherman Buster but the 20 minute time limit expired before the referee could count to three, thus resulting in a time limit draw. Both women shook hands after the match and another feud would commence... ***1/2

Main event
Lacey vs Daizee Haze - Another classic right here and one of my personal favourite SHIMMER matches of all time. Whether this is better or worse than the Del Rey/Martinez match up depends on your opinion but the two are completely different. The previous match was a strong-style face vs face match up seeing who was the better athlete where this one was a classic face vs heel match up with the smaller underdog ultimate face Daizee Haze taking on the ultimate mouthy arrogant heel Lacey. The Haze would always out wrestle Lacey, who would then resort to sneaky and underhand tactics to get the upper hand. Lacey relentlessly worked over the back of The Haze, which Daizee sold remarkably well. At one point, Daziee hung up in the Tree of Woe catches a charging Lacey and hit her tornado Daizee Cutter (a tornado stunner essentially) and after that move the intensity and emotion are at their highest as the two exchange big moves like TKO neckbreakers, yakuza kicks and top-rope elevated swinging neckbreakers until Lacey is put down with Daizee's finisher the Mind Trip (snapmare driver) after over 20 minutes of action. Tremendous. ***1/2

The last two matches (along with the MsChif/Melissa match) are must sees for any women's wrestling fan. Honestly, the last two are better matches than any WWE main event I've seen this year (which has been cena vs orton on a loop really) so give it a chance, it only gets better!",1269216000,,7674,4.5804806991988345
8133125,4,B000GIXIDM,"I really had no idea what to expect with this DVD.  Two plus hours of women's wrestling (minus the blatant T and A peddling) could either have been a total train wreck or a unique twist to the wrestling landscape.  Fortunately, SHIMMER Women Athletes, Vol. 1 falls closer to the latter.  That's not to say SHIMMER is perfect (far from it), but for fans of indie wrestling, it warrants a watch.

SHIMMER Women Athletes is an all-female indie wrestling promotion, based out of the Chicagoland area, founded by Dave Prazak.  Basically, it is designed to be an alternative to the WWE style of doing things when it comes to women and wrestling - look like a barbie doll first, wander around in outfits that would make a stripper blush second, and wrestling a distant third.  Since Dave Prazak is so closely involved with ROH, SHIMMER is viewed as almost their ""sister"" promotion.

This DVD, as the name implies, is SHIMMER's first show.  It's literally being filmed at a Elk's Lodge in front of roughly 20 people - the venue and crowd are embarrassing even for indie wrestling standards (even more shocking - I believe they are still filming there 4 years later).  Putting that aside - the wrestling is actually, in all honesty, fairly decent.  Several of these women have gone on to TNA or WWE - most notably Beth Phoenix (who is donning a pink singlet and bow tie for some reason - say what you want about the WWE, they really found a nice niche for her) and Cheerleader Melissa (Kong's associate Raisha Saeed).  As a side note, seeing Cheerleader Melissa raised some interesting questions for me.  First, why in the blue sane h*ll isn't TNA taking the scarf off and pushing her through the roof - she's cute and has a lot of skill.  Second, why would you call yourself Cheerleader Melissa and not actually wear anything resembling a cheerleader outfit (or carry poms or something)?  The many wonders of the wrestling world I guess.

To me, women have two distinct advantages over their male counterparts in wrestling.  The first - they are much more flexible and can pull off more ""unique"" moves.  For example, on the DVD you see an competitor getting wrapped around the guard rail - a very cool spot.  No matter how good The American Dragon is, he simply can't do that.  When the matches are clicking on the DVD the girls are using their flexibility to pull of some great moves (and again, there are some amazing spots).  The matches come to a grinding halt, however, when they try to mimic the men - it just doesn't work.  The second huge advantage women have over men in wrestling is rendered a moot point in SHIMMER - sex.  I know it's cliche and people don't want to hear it, but sex sells.  SHIMMER has some very attractive women in it and to take away virtually all their sexuality for the sake of making it pure wrestling is going to limit the appeal of the product (like it or not - the women are never going put on the same quality of match as the men can deliver and a vast majority of wrestling fans - who are heterosexual males - aren't going to give SHIMMER much more than a shrug unless some sexuality of the females is involved).

Overall, the DVD is certainly worth picking up if you are a fan of the indie wrestling scene.  At the end of the day though, it's still nothing but women wrestling sans the sex - for better and worse.",1236988800,,3345,4.498344370860927
8133126,4,B000GIXIDM,"My raging feminism needed to be sated by some genuine female wrestling.  And the only genuine female wrestling the WWE offered was one match at Survivor Series 2002, one throwaway 3 minute affair on some Sunday Night Heat between Molly Holly and Lita, and some occasional bits and pieces over many years.

So I come here, and I was simultaneously impressed and disgusted.  Match by match, it was like this:

Shantelle Taylor vs Tiana Ringer
This was one of the greater matches of the DVD, with some technical wrestling, but a seeming lack of ROH-type ""flippy-dippy"" high flying, or WCW/ECW-type ""Dean Malenko and Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit"" technical submission techniciansy.  But compared to say, most wrestling on TV, it was a great match.  (8/10)

Team Blondage vs Nikki Roxx and Cindy Rogers
Here is where the proverbial S-word stepped in that ruined my experience.  I guess this ""Team Blondage"" is supposed to be a spoof on WWE Divas, except it was a total bust (no pun).  First, they waste about 5 minutes or more just wandering around ringside being bitches and refusing to get into the ring.  Whatever this was trying to do psychologically, all it did to me was want them to GET THIS EFFING MATCH STARTED OR GTFO.  Once it did started, it impressed me with absolutely nothing.  Nikki Roxx was no star here; she was in the ring 90% of the time for her team, and for virtually the entire time, she was beat on by the two blondes nonstop.  And it wasn't even impressive-looking; just boring generic WWE-style strikes and sloppy moves.  Cindy Rogers did next to nothing.  (0/10)

Ariel vs Rain
Ariel was being pushed by the announcers as some kind of high flyer.  But she did nothing in the ring remotely high-flying.  Again, I was disappointed by a lack of ROH ""flippy-dippy""-ness.  Just because of the announcers.  Also something to mention, Allison Danger is decent enough on commentary, but she's no color commentator.  The match was decent, but nothing memorable.  (6/10)

Lexie Fyfe vs Christie Ricci
Apologies, I can't rate this one.  I did see it, I just don't remember it at all beyond the entrances.  Maybe it was boring, maybe not.

Cheerleader Melissa vs MsChif
Wrestly goodness!  I got to see a rather great match here, with Melissa being a heavy hitter and seeming power wrestler, and MsChif being the one who did some great screams and submission holds.

It was here that I noticed that something was indeed going on with the DVD production: all the girls had entrance music, but apparently not licensed for the DVD release.  And apparently the DVD production couldn't even edit them out, as instead they muted ALL sound to play crappy generic synthesized music over it.  As such, they unmuted the sound temporarily during MsChif's entrance to get a soundbite of her shrieking.  And in the background, I could hear a completely different song being played in the tiny arena, before the sound was muted again and some generic pseudo-gothy thing played.

This match was rather great except for the fact that it looked as though MsChif was doing most, if not all, of the ring work, while Cheerleader Melissa simply went along, plying some heavy moves, and putting MsChif into contorted positions for her to sell heavily.  (8/10)

Beth Phoenix vs Allison Danger
It was at this point that I realized despite seeing Allison Danger in Ring of Honor, I'd never seen her wrestle.  And what a horrendous match to see her ply her trade in.  Beth Phoenix, the same one whom I thought was ""BADASSMUTHA4000"" in the WWE who was all-serious, no-nonsense, the female version of Chyna or Chris Benoit, comes off at this Shimmer event just like the man she's paired off with now in the WWE, Santino Marella.

So this match was utter crap.  Phoenix was the smug, yet cowardly heel, who did very little but act afraid and act pompous, while Allison Danger barely got to do much in the way of real wrestling.  It was a mess and utter trash.  (4/10)

Sara Del Rey vs Mercedes Martinez
Should've been the main event.  This match made people pissed off big-time, in that it was THE GREATEST MATCH OF THE NIGHT and it was only 20 minutes long.  These two were the true superstar women's athletes here, with lots of the WCW/ECW-type ""Dean Malenko and Eddie Guerrero and GUY WHO NEVER EXISTED(WWE)"" technical submission techniciansy wrestling with heavy moves and quick, slippery, chain-wrestling action that had people applauding many times.  It went past the 20 minute time limit and people were RABID!  They were pissed off.  We all wanted more.  People chanted ""FIVE MORE MINUTES!""  (10/10)

Daizee Haze vs Lacey
People booed when the announcer said this match would have a 60 minute time limit.  I imagine they wanted more for the last match.

As for this one... I saw SHiMMER's female equivalent of John Cena in Daizee Haze.

For around 20 minutes, Daizee Haze did almost nothing, getting her limp ass beat down by Lacey in a rather worthy, yet bland effort by Lacey, that was somewhat reminiscent of the glorified squash match that was John Cena vs JBL at Wrestlemania 21.  Daizee Haze did a few weak-ass moves, then did her weak-ass finisher for the win after having just been beaten down for virutally the entire match.  I don't even know the girl's wrestling, but if it's anything like this match and John Cena, I say screw Daizee Haze.  (4/10)

Bonus Match
Sara Del Rey vs Lacey  from Ring of Honor
Bigger arena at a different event, and while the ROH crowd didn't s*** on the women as they entered, they didn't seem to want them in the ring either.  Lukewarm response, which at least they got more into when they started wrestling.  It was nowhere near as great as their respective matches from the Shimmer event, but the crowd was very much into it, giving the loud ""OOOH!""s even to simple slams and kicks and the like.  It was too short, in my opinion, and I think the ROH crowd would've wanted 3-5 more minutes as well.  Maybe.  Don't take that as immediate fact.  (7/10)

For end notes and thoughts, I have to say that the DVD production was terrible.  It was supported by ROH, so the Chapters menu shows you the matches and plays them, and once the matches are over, takes you back to the chapters menu.  Not a problem.

But what is a problem is the lack of use of licensed music.  Maybe ROH can afford to use licensed music, because they use it in their DVDs, but they didn't even bother to edit the music out on this DVD release, choosing instead to mute all sound during entrances, and playing crappy generic synthesized music instead.  They totally fumbled this with MsChif's entrance, where they went and unmuted the sound to let us all hear MsChif's screaming, and the background music playing at the event was something completely different.

The arena itself was the most empty I've ever seen for a DVD release.  I had been astonished by the maybe 150 people in NWA Florida Jeff Peterson Memorial Cup 2004 event, but there must have been a maximum of 20 to 50 at this event.  So very empty it was here, it gave lots of opportunity for the wrestlers to yell at the crowd, yell at each other, and communicate better for psychology (when used properly).  Unlike the ROH crowd in the bonus match, the crowd here was at least respectful to treat these women like athletes, instead of catcalling or chanting things like ""SHOW US YOUR TITS"" or anything of that sort.",1230508800,,7380,4.673913043478261
8133127,4,B000GIXIDM,"As an indy federation associate with ""Ring of Honor"", Shimmer vol 1 contains exciting matches featuring a few of the most promising female wrestlers like Lacey, Cheerleader Melissa, Allison Danger and team Blondage, also there is a match involving Beth Phoenix on her days before she was the ""Glamazon"" known in WWE.

The DVD is good however the production is very bad and since is like a bar the matches, even watchable, are poorly shot with 2 cameras.

If you like indy wrestling and don't mind a not so great production, maybe you can forgive the mistakes and get this DVD.",1215475200,,576,4.693069306930693
8133128,4,B000GIXIDM,"Having now ordered and watched the first five Shimmer DVD's,

here is my assessment...

This is an excellent women's wrestling troupe, but, unfortunately,

I don't think it will be around very long.  Mainly, it is because

this league won't get the exposure it deserves, since its audience

will likely be limited to the DVD market, and not national TV or

widely advertised live events.  Like so many other women's wrestling

troupes, like the LPWA, GLOW, POWW, WOW, and others, it will likely

see it's time and be gone.  But what it DOES have going for it is this...

They are finally doing everything RIGHT.

This league has signed a number of rising stars in women's wrestling,

such as Cheerleader Melissa from APW, Krissy Vaine and Lexie Fife from

WEW, Shantelle Taylor and Tiana Ringer from Canada, Nikki Roxx, Lacey,

and the very popular Daizee Haze, and a number of other very talented

women.  (See the other reviews here for lineups on Volume 1)

Here's what they (finally) get right...

1. The women actually wrestle.  The matches are not over in two minutes

(like in the WWE), and these women really pound on each other.  They

wrestle tough, and the matches are very entertaining.

2. They don't mess around with the back-stage non-sense, comedy, or

excessive mouthing off.  A few individual comments backstage for a

minute or so and that's about it.

3. No men.  No Bugaloo Brown, or Jonathan Blue, or Papa Mae, or Sound

Guy, or David McLane, or other stupid guys in the ring, or as outside

managers wasting disk space.  Some men referees and that's it.

4. The characters give the women individuality, but are not over the

top.  No space aliens or mutants.  The most unique is ""MsChif"", who

has green hair and screams.  That's about as outlandish as they are.

I'd have given this DVD five stars, except for a few drawbacks...

1. The league needs to expand. Only having 18 women on the roster

will create some repetitiveness.  Imagine if they were able to sign

GI Ho, Amanda Storm, Taylor Matheny, Terri Gold, and Pincess Sugey ?

2. The stars, unfortunately, will gradually move on.  Vince McMahon

has already stolen Krissy Vaine and Beth Phoenix from the troupe.

3. Their tiny arena looks very amateurish.  It looks like a grade

school all-purpose room, and the teddy bears on the wall look a bit

ridiculous.

4. The lighting is poor, and sometimes streaks across the screen.

5. The camera work could be better.  Sometimes they don't get the

best angles.

Overall, though, it is the best women's wrestling troupe around in

the past 20 years.  Hopefully, it will have a good run before it

joins the scrap heap.",1170288000,3,2648,4.717439293598234
8133129,5,B000GIXIDM,"After about a decade of being brainwashed by Dub Dub E's desperate version of Women's wrestling, I found it extremely refreshing to sit down and watch an event full of real women athletes competing in a wrestling ring, and using actual wrestling moves. Attendance was embarrassingly low and I pray that SHIMMER catches on and more people go to the shows, because the girls really deserve it, and more voices could really add to the atmosphere. This was SHIMMER's debut show, and with the exception of a few minor flaws, I enjoyed myself from bell to bell.

I had a lot of fun watching some female wrestlers whom I had never actually seen on video prior to this occasion. For example the first match featured Shantelle Taylor and Tiana Ringer, two of Canada's finest examples of home-grown talent. They had wrestled each other a million times before and opened the card with a great match. The fans were then treated to tag team action, pitting the annoying heel Team Blondage (Krissy Vaine and Amber O'Neal) facing the make-shift combination of Cindy Rogers and Nikki Roxx. Everyone was decent here but Roxx was clearly the star, and I look forward to seeing her in some singles bouts in the future. Ariel (what a sweetie) battled IWA Mid South's Rain in a nice test of skills for both women. This was my first taste of Ariel, and I have to give her a lot of credit, as she surprised me with how well she has developed as a wrestler.

Rain is one of the most beautiful women I've ever laid eyes on --  Next we had my personal highlight of the night with everybody's favorite California girl Cheerleader Melissa taking on the demonic force of MsChif. I've seen lots of Melissa matches and she is my favorite by far, but this was my first chance to check out a complete match involving MsChif -- what a threat she is with her unique personality! The match was a stiff contest and included Melissa stretching the hell out of MsChif in positions that just had to be seen to be appreciated. Ring veteran Lexie Fyfe brought all of her experience to a SHIMMER ring and faced Christie Ricci in a decent match. Allison Danger, who doubled as color commentator all night long, was fortunate enough to get a match with WWE-signee Beth Phoenix (Note: It was easy to spot the WWE employee in the roster photo, look for the one with BIG BOOBS). This was the best match I've ever seen out of Allison Danger, and I'm really looking forward to watching more in future SHIMMER DVDs. Sara Del Ray and Mercedes Martinez slowed things down a little bit and went at it for neary 30 minutes with back and forth action. ROH-influence was felt before, during, and at the end of this match and handshakes were exchanged and respect was shown. Mercedes Martinez is a close second on my favorites list. The main event featured two ROH valets donning the tights and going to war for a 20 minute battle to end the evening with a solid match. Daizee Haze is deceptively tough. Lacey is deceptively talented.

Final Thoughts: There was an obvious lack of stipulations, but that is understandable seeing as though it was their first show. This was by no means a failure, because I was happy with this volume; I do, however, expect an improvement in future SHIMMER DVDs.  Thank you to all the girls and keep up the wonderful effort.

It should be noted that, even though they are not yet available on Amazon.com, there are a total of five SHIMMER Volumes so far.  They can be purchased at ROHwrestling.com",1166227200,8,3471,4.579710144927536
