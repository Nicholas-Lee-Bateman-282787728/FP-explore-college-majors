4093039,4,B00393SFP2,"""Baking with Julia Vol. 2"" is as good or better than the first one released. Like many other reviewers I too wish they would just put the entire series on one set and be done with it. The Dvds, I & 2 are still not a not a complete complement to the series' cookbook  ""Baking with Julia"" which is mentioned throughout the programs. Other than that- it is a delight to see Julia interacting with some of the best Bakers in the country. The recipes are awesome and the filming is crisp and clear. The food photos are gorgeous and mouthwatering with every presentation. All eight episodes are delightful, entertaining and informative.",1302566400,10,630,4.625
4093040,5,B00393SFP2,I'm so glad they're slowly releasing more of the Baking with Julia segments.  I wish they'd just do the ENTIRE series instead of 8 episodes here and then next year another one.  I have the book that comes with this series and it's invaluable!  I've tried a lot of the recipes and they are yummy!!!  I've watched Julia Child's since the 70's and her shows are of excellent quality.  The cameraman (men) in her production company are EXCELLENT. Every shot captured each technique demonstrated by the chefs and the quality and lighting was very clear. I watch a lot of cooking shows and no one has the same quality as Julia Child's production company.  I just LOVED watching all of Julia's cooking and baking shows.  Miss you Julia!!,1294272000,3,730,4.65625
4093041,5,B00393SFP2,A classic cooking video instruction. Can't go wrong with Julia as your teacher. Now I have more confidence and enjoyed more in cooking. Thanks Julia.,1280188800,,149,5.0
4093042,5,B00393SFP2,"I was thrilled to see they have released more Baking with Julia on DVD. While I enjoyed the first volume, I felt most of the recipe selections were items i would rarely try, and only had the nostalgia aspect of viewing.

This 2nd volume, takes on a better mix of recipes, many of which I can not wait to try!

Nancy Silvertons Pecan STicky Buns and Brioche pockets is worth the DVD alone!  However, Michel Richard doing Tourte Milanese is very fun and has a great rapport with Julia.  The torte is also delicious!

I hope they continue with this wonderful series, as there are a few episodes i can't wait to see, including a rather young Martha Stewart.",1270339200,19,653,4.453781512605042
8391908,5,B00393SFP2,Love these shows and hope to find volume 3. Our first DVD would not load in the player. It kept trying but could only see the main page but couldn't load an episode. Returned and got a replacement. This one would not load even the front page. Switched it to DVD on Mac laptop and it played! Bit of a hassle but well worth it. No idea why it won't work from the actual DVD player for TV.,1506556800,,386,3.9615384615384617

8391912,5,B00393SFP2,"I enjoyed watching the ""Baking With Julia"" shows on PBS Create. I just wish the DVDs included all of her shows. I order both volumes but found that some shows were missing, such as Martha Stewart's segment and a few others. I even checked out Volume 3 and found no detailed description of the contents of the DVD. I hope all of her shows will be included in future volumes. I would pay for them. Five-stars for the actual shows.",1462147200,3,428,4.3625
8391913,2,B00393SFP2,Beware! I bought this for mom in April but she didn't get to see it until recently as I had given her several cooking course dvds. Well it was freezing in several sections when played on any machine and it was too late to return it. So I bought another and it was even worse! It would be wonderful to have this if the quality was usable!! I got her the book and vol. one dvd works but we haven't played vol. 3 so we are hoping it's playable!!,1444694400,3,442,3.9775280898876404
