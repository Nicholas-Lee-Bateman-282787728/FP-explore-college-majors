5722006,5,B00CGMUOYC,Seriously it is so good!!! I didn't think anything could be as good as Repo! but they topped themselves I can't wait to see the next part!,1351382400,,138,4.148148148148148
5722007,5,B00CGMUOYC,"I just happened to stumble upon this movie, thought it seemed interesting, and watched it only to discover at the end that my feeling of it reminding me of Repo! The Genetic Opera was right on the money; it was by the same people! With many of the actors from Repo! as well. While you'll love this if you loved Repo!, don't be dissuaded if you didn't enjoy it because this is an entirely different experience. The music is just as enticing and memorable, but in an entirely different way. It fits the atmosphere fantastically, and the visuals only add to the whole experience. I advise watching it several times to catch all of the hints and tidbits that are easy to miss your first time on the wild ride. This movie is well worth the small price to get it digitally here, and a lot more! The acting is very well done, particularly Sean Patrick Flanery did a wonderful job, but so did Dayton Callie and all the others. I adore this movie, and am so glad I fell upon it!",1351382400,,969,4.329670329670329
5722008,5,B00CGMUOYC,"Excellent take on Aesop Fables .....cant wait for more...keep em coming!! Another successful venture by Darren, Terrance, and the team. Your creativity is truly appreciated!",1351382400,,173,5.96
5722009,5,B00CGMUOYC,The Devil's Carnival is an introductory film to a new dark musical universe from Darren Bousman and Terrance Zdunich centered around a reimagining of Aesop's fables. Episode one tells the stories of 3 sinners who find themselves transported to the hellish carnival where they become unwitting participants in an elaborate performance orchestrated by Lucifer himself. Not having learned their lessons in life each sinner must wrestle with their own demons as they navigate the treacherous midway. The Devil's Carnival is expertly crafted to both stand on its own with three fables and 12 new songs but also functions as an introductory piece to a bigger universe with hints and glimpses of characters that we can look forward to being explored more fully in future episodes.,1351123200,,773,5.192
5722010,5,B00CGMUOYC,"Wasnt sure if i would like it as much as repo! but i absolutely loved it. It had a very interesting story plot, and great actors. Definitely going to be a movie to watch over and over again.",1350950400,,190,4.026315789473684
5722011,5,B00CGMUOYC,"For fans of Repo! The Genetic Opera. This show will peek your interests all over again, of our unfairly amazing friends Terrance and Darren.  The shows content is of course; as subjective as a movie can be where our heroines are in hell and being subjected to a tormented existence of their life's actions following them to hell. But it's all done to a catchy tune that blazes your greed for the second episode. Yep, this is only the beginning.",1350950400,7,444,4.55
5722018,5,B00CGMUOYC,Love this movie. Fantastic music.,1495411200,,33,5.8
5722019,1,B00CGMUOYC,"My wife and I thought this was the worst of the hundreds of movies we've seen in the last year. The idea, the prose, the plot, the acting, the music-- they are stupid-bad. Super waste of 26 bones.",1494374400,,196,4.184210526315789
5722020,4,B00CGMUOYC,I enjoyed it. It could have been better. I plan on watching the sequal soon.,1489881600,,76,4.133333333333334
5722021,5,B00CGMUOYC,Amazing music and lyrics. The costumes and sets truly bring heaven and hell alive with beautiful but terrifying scenery. Terrance and Saar are brilliant!,1489363200,,153,5.416666666666667
5722022,5,B00CGMUOYC,Warning:  Songs are seriously addicting.  Brilliant musical from a brilliant mind that brought you Repoman. 10/10,1488844800,,113,6.0

5722025,3,B00CGMUOYC,Pretty good movie but kind of crappy delivery,1482969600,,45,4.75
5722026,5,B00CGMUOYC,This is a masterpiece! Terrence as the devil is truly a performance that leaves a lasting impression. The entire cast is amazing and the music is to die for. I highly recommended this show.,1481846400,,189,4.588235294117647
5722027,2,B00CGMUOYC,"I am a fan of Terrance Zdunich's movie opera, Repo! The Genetic Opera and I guess that's what I was expecting with Devil's Carnival.  The songs are okay, but the story is seriously lacking in development...nothing is every really explained, it's like ""drive by musicals"" that don't really seem to go anywhere.  There's no explanation to why the characters are in Hell and the characters might as well be cardboard cutouts.",1481500800,,422,4.929577464788732

5722032,4,B00CGMUOYC,"Amazing costumes and characters, there were characters in the background that I wanted to know about but didn't have a chance. I will have to check out the sequel ""Alleluia"" to see if they are there. The story is three vignettes based on some of Aesop's fables. I'm not sure being nave and trusting gets you to hell, but what do I know, I'm Asatru. The songs are catchy, some lessons are learned, others are not, at least maybe not immediately, and sinners are punished. You see Satan's (or the Devil, Lucifer, Mephistopheles, Asmodus, Leviathan, Beelzebub, Baal, I don't remember him introducing himself) master plan at the end, which I believe is the set up for the next film. It's fun and easy to watch.",1468108800,,706,4.656

5722084,5,B00CGMUOYC,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies and I also enjoy musicals. These songs are very easily remembered and quick to be stuck in your head. The story-lines within the movie are chilling and some may even be a little borderline psychotic, but it also truly makes you think. The make-up on the characters, wardrobe, and the acting are very well done and the voices will send chills down your spine. I had actually seen this before but had to get it on Amazon so I could share it with others. If you enjoy musicals, I highly recommend this movie and it is the type that seems to be done as quickly as it began.",1430870400,,612,4.2844827586206895

5722091,4,B00CGMUOYC,"I've got to say I liked it. I think they conveyed exactly what they intended, how they intended. The ""rough"" feel was an intentional part of the show. Comprised of three short narratives that flow one to another, the story progresses mostly in song as a post-cautionary tale - this is what happens after you ignore the warnings. Clever lyrics and characters deliver a fun horror/rock experience.",1423526400,,395,4.91044776119403

The first and last stories didn't make a lot of sense to me.  The middle story was spot on in a lot of ways.  Not sure why that would land her in hell....

5722102,2,B00CGMUOYC,"I should start by saying that I LOVE REPO! It's one of my favorite movies, so I was really excited about this next collaboration . . . only to be dismally disappointed. Repo! had an incredible story and the music helped to tell the story well. The Devil's Carnival sacrificed the story for a few chaotic ditties. The story had very little development, and one poorly built up to twist that was rather anticlimactic. In fact the entire film was rather . . . monotonous. The costume and set work are great, but that's the only compliment I can muster. I can't believe how bitterly disappointed I am by this. So much so that I really regret wasting any money on it. It's just not the same caliber of film that Repo! is . . . which, I now feel the need to watch just to make me feel better.",1412899200,2,786,4.246666666666667

5722106,1,B00CGMUOYC,i wanna get this soooo bad and see this movie so bad since one of my favorite singers is in it Ivan Moody but i am not going to spend a hell lot on it  just cause its rare doesnt mean u gotta make the price really sky high where nobody can afford it or want to spend the money on it its worth like 30 or 40 dollars not 300 or 5.000,1400976000,2,331,3.5342465753424657
5722107,3,B00CGMUOYC,"Bottom line, ""The Devil's Carnival"" was fun for me. It's weird, over-the-top, musically incredible, and oddly compelling. It's also uneven, unfinished, and at times overstuffed and gratuitous. Some spoilers follow.

In this film, the minds behind ""Repo! The Genetic Opera"" give us their vision of the afterlife. God (Paul Sorvino) is a crooning toymaker who throws away pieces (read: people) that are even slightly damaged, and all the damaged souls end up at the Devil's Carnival--a half-Hell, half-Purgatory where demonic carnies torment the sinners with special traps based on their greatest failings. The carnival is presided over by a classic red-skinned, horned Lucifer with a striking baritone and a fondness for Aesop's Fables, played--of course--by Graverobber himself, Terrance Zdunich. Subtlety is not welcome here: the exaggerated makeup and costuming of the carnies turns them into gruesome caricatures of ordinary things, and their carnival of evil is gleefully, ridiculously over the top in its enthusiasm for suffering sinners.

The audience follows the fates of three specific sinners: Tamara, Merrywood, and John. Tamara's gullibility and weakness for bad boys got her killed, Merrywood was a jewel thief killed in a shoot-out with the police, and John committed suicide in grief over the disappearance of his son. Two of their punishments proceed according to plan (and with some excellent musical numbers), but a cog is thrown during the third one, and Lucifer finds himself contemplating some ambitious changes in the balance between Heaven and Hell.

Zdunich's Lucifer is the highlight of the film. He narrates the sinners' fates out of a book of fables and seems to enjoy the creativity of his work, but he also betrays a sense of morality (!) appropriate to a fallen angel.  ""I am not in the market of killing innocent children,"" he tells John. ""That's God's jurisdiction."" His debatable motives and as-yet-unrevealed plan leave the film ending on a cliffhanger, but that's not surprising, given that this is only the first part of a series.

The weakest part of the whole setup is probably the sinners themselves. It makes sense for the carnies to be one-note, caricaturish or incomprehensible, since they're not quite human, and Lucifer's stereotypical look could be part of that. But while the point of the exercise seems to be to paint God as careless and heartless, throwing away pieces that are only slightly imperfect, the sinners we actually meet are much more than a little broken. Merrywood is especially guilty of this: her lust for jewels is her only real trait, and considering how she died, she was obviously a career criminal. John's wallowing in grief ended in suicide, which is considered a very serious sin by many Christian denominations. The one-note nature of their characters would work better, and make more sense, if the focus of the story was different. As it was, I had a hard time sympathizing with Lucifer when the case against God rested on three weak characters who might've come out of a Chick tract.

That being said, I enjoyed ""The Devil's Carnival"" quite a bit. The music is really the highlight of the whole production: each sinner's fall and punishment are given separate songs, often wildly different in style but laden with off-kilter, complex lyrics. Two stand-outs for me were the slow, almost lullaby-like ""Hello, Beautiful Stranger"" and the scenery-chewing ""A Penny for a Tale.""

If you can overlook some writing issues and a generally incomplete feel, I would recommend this film. After weighing several wildly disparate scores, I give it a 3/5.",1393977600,11,3612,5.15358361774744

5722109,4,B00CGMUOYC,"There were two things that made me want to see THE DEVILS CARNIVAL.  The first was the name Darren Lynn Bousman under the directors credit.  The second was the 55-minute running time.  Bousman has made a lot of films people don't like (SAW II, III and IV), but I dig his work and his dedication to the genre, so Im a fan.  And people really seem to love the previous Bousman/Terrance Zdunich collaboration, REPO! THE GENETIC OPERA, which, I admit, I haven't seen, but, come on, THE DEVILS CARNIVAL is 55 minutes.  I can watch this entire movie before its time to take my son to school for drill team at 6:00 and not have to finish it when I get back like usual.  Now thats the movie for me.

The plot of the movie is based on three of Aesops Fables, The Scorpion and the Frog, The Dog and Its Reflection and Grief and His Due, and it features some pretty recognizable faces in some pretty unrecognizable roles.

Three people, John, Ms. Merrywood, and Tamara all wake to find themselves in a very strange and demonic carnival.  John is a grieving father who wound up here after slitting his wrist in the bathroom.  He wakes up and immediately sets about finding his lost son, Daniel, whom he knows is somewhere in the carnival.  Theres Tamara who is a sucker for a bad boy, even though theyve done nothing but hurt her in life.  Wandering around, she finds a stereotypical bad boy called The Scorpion, locked in a cage, asking her to please help him.  Do you trust me? he asks.  She does.  Unfortunately.  Then theres Ms. Merrywood, a thief in life, a woman more in love with diamonds and jewels than anything else, so enamored with them she seeks them out at any cost.

The three lost souls are left to their own devices in the Devils Carnival, and each, in their turn, fall victim to the sins that haunted them in life.

The Scorpion betrays Tamara, Ms. Merrywood is made a slave to her greed, and Johnwell, thats the one that sort of confused me.  Im not familiar with the Grief and His Due fable, so that part of the story was lost on me.  However, the other two characters stories, I really enjoyed.

THE DEVILS CARNIVAL is a musical, with about 95% of the story being told in song.  Its no ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, but, Zdunich has definitely written some winners here, A Penny for a Tale and Prick! Goes the Scorpions Tale being, for me, the most memorable.

I enjoyed keeping an eye out for the actors I recognized, seeing Dayton Callie (Sons of Anarchy) under all that Ticket-Keeper makeup, or trying to find Alexa Vegas (SPY KIDS) Wick character.  Bill Moseley (THE DEVILS REJECTS) has a brief appearance as a magician while Paul Sorvino (GOODFELLAS) is God.  Sean Patrick Flannery (BOONDOCK SAINTS) plays John the grieving father and Jessica Lowndes (AUTOPSY) is Tamara.  For such a small movie with a reported budget of only $500,000, it was surprising to see so many actors I knew.

THE DEVILS CARNIVAL isn't for everyone, I admit.  The plot takes a lot of unexpected and strange turns, and never really gels into a cohesive whole, but instead plays like an anthology movie (CREEPSHOW, for instance), without the chapter breaks between stories, instead featuring all of the separate stories at once, and letting the viewer figure out whats going on.  Its a smart movie, and I enjoyed it, but I think its got too much working against it to really appeal to a huge audience.  However, I also think the audience it does find is probably going to be a pretty loyal one.  I know Im ready for the sequel.

Zdunich and Bousman are definitely a team that work well together and I look forward to seeing what they do next, wherever their muses take them.",1392940800,,3659,4.5220700152207005

5722115,2,B00CGMUOYC,"The Devil's Carnival (Darren Lynn Bousman, 2012)

Strike one: Darren Lynn Bousman is the guy who took over from Wan and Whannell, and turned Saw from a single excellent film into the laughable crap franchise that it had become by the third movie.

Strike two: you put together a cast of this caliber, both of actors (Dayton Callie, Bill Moseley, Paul Sorvino...) and musicians (Ogre, for pete's sake), and then you put Emilie Autumn, a second-rate goth-rock wannabe, at the top of the list? What on earth are you thinking? Worse, one of IMDB's trivia bits strongly suggests Bousman had always conceived of Autumn as the movie's top billing: Darren Lynn Bousman 'stalked' Emilie Autumn online and convinced her to be in the film.

We'll have to wait for strike three, but given (a) strike one and (b) the end of this short making it obvious that this is going to be a series, the chances that it's not going to come are pretty much zero.

All of this is frustrating, because there are some really good ideas in Terrance Zdunich's script, most of which are undercut by Bousman's workmanlike-at-best direction. None of them is allowed to do more than peer up at the surface, however; this is worth watching only if you are a major fan of one or more of the principals here, and even then, prepare to be disappointed. **",1384905600,,1316,4.635193133047211

Shrug, I guess i got exactly what I was looking for--stars I love, a premise I enjoyed, a segment in a trilogy I want to see more of.

It was very visually stunning, and I love the concept for the story, and for the characters. The character development falls short, though, and the music isn't nearly as catchy as the music from Repo!

I didn't feel attached to any of the characters by the end of the movie. And even though the run time was on the shorter side, I still expect that by the end I'll feel some motivation to see part two. I don't, really, as far as the movie's concerned. I'm seeing part two only because I believe in Darren and Terrance's work, and I believe they can pull it together and make something even greater than Repo!

It was very beautiful to look at, possibly even more so than Repo! The costuming and sets really injected a lot into the movie that the lackluster script didn't. And even though the writing didn't captivate me, some of the themes that they addressed in the movie made me really happy. Bonus points for steamy BDSM action.

I'm looking forward to part two, but if it falls short like this one did, it's really going to affect my confidence in Terrance and Darren, and will probably keep me from seeing any additional work in this series.

It could be said that intentions that aren't crystal-clear could be mysterious, even possibly suspenseful, but at some point I had to go online to get ""the big picture"". Sights such as DevilsCarnival.com and Wikipedia were helpful to this point. And speaking of mystery, I appreciated the idea that the carnies' backstories weren't really mentioned but, in some cases, almost hinted upon. It allowed one to connect to the characters without needing to know a lot about them. It allowed the viwer's imagination to run wild thinking how each carney could have come buy such a peculiar carnival; maybe they all were there to begin with.

5722147,4,B00CGMUOYC,"John (Sean Patrick Flanery; The Boondock Saints, Saw 3D: The Final Chapter), Merriwood (Briana Evigan) and Tamara (Jessica Lowndes) find themselves in a carnival in Hell dressed in the wardrobe of a long past era (`50s-ish).  After introductory choruses by the carnies, the music treats the sins of each sinner in turn as the Devil reads them as fable morality tales.

This short (56 minute) musical was directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II-IV, Repo! The Genetic Opera, Mother's Day).  The carnies were all well done and their make-up had an intentional theater appeal.  The Devil looks stunningly similar to the djinn (i.e., genie) in Wishmaster (1997).  Other characters, especially the cracked face ""painted doll"" lady who we see quite often, were well wardrobed and creepily presented.  The music was decent, occasionally surprisingly good, and dominated the film's running time as each of the three wayward souls' sinful stories were told in song.

Between the dark nature of the movie and carnies versus the bright colors and lighting in the sets and wardrobe I found an interesting duality towing my reactions.  This is musical horror in theme, but presented in an upbeat Broadway manner--except for John's tale, the third and final of the Devil's fables, which is more forlorn.  I am especially fond of the Devil's role and his musical number at the end, which explains the decisions he has made regarding the three souls cast into his carnival.

This strikes me as being a great deal similar to Repo! The Genetic Opera, although Repo! was only occasionally upbeat in song (in an uppity, non-macabre feel good way, that is) and not so much in set and wardrobe palate.  In either case, the ""feel"" is there and fans of Repo! should be quite pleased.  We even find some of the same actors (e.g., Paul Sorvino).

I am told that this is the first of a series of films and the DVD cover says ""Episode 1.""  I'm curious to see how the next installment will connect to the present characters and theme.

Very different.  Very interesting.  If you're very adventurous, then give this a shot.",1352678400,,2092,4.864406779661017

I had never heard of Repo! The Genetic Opera until I looked this movie up to see if there were more like it. I was completely unprepared for how cool this turned out to be and how much I was going to love it. I immediately bought the sound track because I couldn't get the songs out of my head, and then I bought the digital copy here, and then I ordered the fancy super ""Ringmaster"" special edition from the creators' website because I really want to support them making more episodes.

It's a crazy, burlesque, dark carnival musical and it's just awesome. It is just the first episode of a longer work--and hopefully more *will* be coming--so it is short (less than an hour) and it ends in a way that is obviously setting up for more.

5722150,4,B00CGMUOYC,"If you walk into this film thinking it can duplicate the sound and look of Repo you'll be sorely mistaken. This movie was not produced by LionsGate and reflects the small budget it had. If you walk into it thinking it's a horror film you'll be disappointed. It's not.

And if you walk into this thinking it's a complete story you'll also be disappointed. It's the first episode of several installments telling a complete story over time. Think of it as a mini-series on television.

Once you get those things out of the way you can watch the film for what it is. It's beautiful and vibrant and I loved the way Aesop's Fables were used to describe the sins that can condemn someone to hell. The film is very stylized in the way we've come to expect from Darren and Terrance's collaborations. The songs are not nearly as rock and roll as Repo but they were not meant to be. This is a carnival and the music reflects the showy flashy idea that embodies.

That being said there are a few songs (666, Kiss the Girls, etc) that I didn't enjoy as much as some of the others. It all kept very much in the right vein but some things were a miss. No one gets it 100% right all the time.

The look was dazzling and fitting despite the small budget. The story should be exciting as we delve into later episodes and discover more about the balance of heaven and hell and figure out a bit more about the three newcomers and their fates. Very excited for the next installment!

SPOILER ALERT -

I'm including this down here so people can stop reading if they haven't seen the film. You know, just in case. I've had a lot of people complain that John's sin of loving his son and Tamara's sin of being too trusting are not really hell worthy sins. No, loving your son is not a sin but John committed suicide because he could not cope with his son's loss and that was what bound him to hell. Tamara's sin is a bit more complicated and I'm thinking we'll get to know her character more a bit later on in the series. I don't think trusting people is a sin by any stretch but her problem is that she's naive and trusts all the wrong people. ""Cast not ye pearls before swine"" comes to mind. She doesn't value herself at all. She believes everyone has good intentions and you know where good intentions pave the way to...

I'm also very curious what the take on God is going to be.",1352246400,,2358,4.285393258426966
5722151,5,B00CGMUOYC,"This movie is pure artistic genius. If you didn't already know, this is a first installment of a series...So an episode. More will come!
I first saw The Devil's Carnival on the Road Tour in Denver and I was completely blown away. The makeup, the actors, and the music all blend together perfectly to create this dark masterpiece. If you were a fan of Repo! The Genetic Opera, you won't be disappointed. It includes many of the same actors with new cast members who are just as wonderful...This is a film/series that will stay with me for the rest of my life and I cannot wait for the future episodes.
(P.S. Terrance, if you just so happen to be reading this...I love you.)",1351814400,,672,4.471544715447155
5722152,1,B00CGMUOYC,"Perhaps my mind is not as open as it used to be, but I could not describe this amateurish use of cameras and microphones as art.  I wonder, have films evolved into something that may deviate so far from our mutual understandings of what may constitute art that they no longer can be recognized as such?  I read the reviews of this film, the content of which were mainly in praise of the previous film made by the same individuals, so I took a chance to view it.  I understand now why there were so many words devoted to a previous film.  If you do not have a greatly expanded view of what may constitute art, even to the point where technical quality is ignored, let alone the attempt to make a film that might satisfy any other criteria, you should probably consider another film to spend your money and time upon.  While this review is quite critical, it is possible that I have missed some artistic points that would earn it five star ratings.  If I have, I certainly would not mind any criticism of an informative nature.",1351728000,4,1025,4.396825396825397
5722153,5,B00CGMUOYC,People pushed this project and these great film makers aside. They went on there own and produced an amazing piece of art and can't wait for the others.  I have the ringmaster edition super awesome behind the scenes features.,1351641600,,225,4.769230769230769
5722154,5,B00CGMUOYC,"When I heard there was not going to be a sequel to Repo! the Genetic Opera I was disappointed since I was a fan of that movie. But this movie makes up for. Now even though I am a fan of Repo, I went into this with a blank slate and judged the movie by itself. This movie was well done. For one it has some interesting characters mainly the carnies who will hopefully be develop in the sequel. Also the art direction is great, an old fashioned carnival with a hellish twist and I thought the songs were well done and original and used effectively. Also the film is able to give a interesting and cohesive story within a short amount of time.  But this movie does have it's flaws.

The biggest flaw is the movie is just too short which hinders the movie the most because it doesn't allow alot of the characters some screen time as well dive deeper into there characters. I am hoping that we will dive deeper into this world and it's inhabitants as well as it's victims in the next movie and I hope the film is longer. But overall this problem should not  turn you away from this movie for the price you pay it is worth it and within the amount of time they make an interesting movie with a great concept. Just note this is just the beginning and if you are a fan of Repo this is a completely different movie.",1351468800,,1306,4.174603174603175
5722155,1,B00CGMUOYC,"I should state from the outset how I differ from the previous eight reviewers who have unanimously given this production 5 stars. I had not previously seen Repo! The Genetic Opera prior to watching this, and am not a fan
or follower of the producers or any of the actors/performers involved. I'm simply a movie lover, and was enticed into renting this film because Paul Sorvino got top billing, and I saw that it had a 5 star rating.

First off, Paul Sorvino's part was very small. He appears at the end and the beginning for a few seconds. That's it. And there's nothing particularly compelling about his role.

The best I can say about this piece is that I was initially excited and really looking forward to something entertaining and philosophically provocative. But I was disappointed, partly by the low-budget production which made long stretches cacophonous and confusing. Lyrics were hard to discern, and the sound quality generally bad. This is a killer for a musical, obviously. The story line wended its way to a suprisingly dull conclusion, and the path it took on its way there was dull and unimaginative.

Putting on outlandish costumes, using carney props and making a lot of noise can never replace good story telling.

Anyway, if you want to get a good deal of amusement out of this movie, read the reviews on IMDB. You'll get a more honest assessment of the show's value from that source.",1351468800,3,1406,4.75
5722156,5,B00CGMUOYC,"That's how a carnival grows, my son!  I am terrified of clowns, but I cannot pull my eyes from the screen when I watch this movie.  The storylines, the amazing music, the creativity of the writers, costumers & wonderful actors all make this a wonderful experience from beginning to end.  I've watched it over & over again from the moment my Ringmaster Edition arrived.  I cannot wait for the next episode!",1351382400,,405,4.661971830985915
5722157,5,B00CGMUOYC,"When I first heard of The Devil's Carnival I wasn't sure that I would like it, but given my favorite director, writer, and music artist were behind it I decided to buy it. End result, I love it. I've had this movie and the commentaries on loop from the moment I had it. I'm a film student in the Fine Arts and all I can say is, ""Wow"" just wow. Darren and Terrance have made something that is inspirational to anyone who is about to go into the movie business or merely an artist. I think I've learned more from just sitting down and listening to these guys compared to what I have to read in my textbook. Always thought I wanted to work for a studio, but after seeing this and the making of TDC- INDIE is the way to go. I can't wait till episode two and will make deals with whoever I need to, to get a bus ticket/car to a city on the road tour so I can see this with a group of people.",1351382400,,886,3.9553072625698324
