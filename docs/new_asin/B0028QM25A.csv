3872903,2,B0028QM25A,"Oh CANADA!!!!....Canada is one majestically, mystically, epically beautiful Country, there is no doubt about that,  yet one simply cannot use these same adjectives for their cinematic efforts.  Needless to say  ""the Mystical Adventures of Billy Owens"" is neither epic, nor magical, or mystical in any way shape or form. In fact, it is the worst Canadian family film well....since the last Canadian family film, whatever that was.  The prosaic narration from Billy's young female friend and counterpart is pretty typically ""Canadian"".  (again, no offense CANADA..your forests, lakes, critters and parks are enchanting) Before feasting mine own eyes on this piece of Canadian history (could not help myself to rent this after seeing the ""Potter"" clone cover box on the video store shelf)  I had read a review saying it was very different from ""Harry Potter""...but of course that review came from some Toronto based local community newsletter. The fact is...it is a complete and utter ""Potter"" rip-off! (save for the good acting, decent script, awesome musical score, amazing special effects and about a thousand more factors that Potter offered us)...although I must concede that the special effects  (or should I say THE special effect...as there really is only one)  are amazing....amazingly amateurish that is!  There is basically only ONE special effect throughout the whole of this masterpiece...golden sparkles that emanate out of a  of a wand that was easily done by someone's Dell home PC......oh, and there is this ""dragon"" creature which I really cannot even call a special effect as it looks more like a cartoon...I have seen more realistic dragons in a 1975 Atari video game.  Now, to the acting....ah.....acting!!....there is a lot of ""acting"" going on here...overacting, underacting, terrible acting, acting like their acting, and acting just plain stupid (the Library Security Guard for example) Let's start with overacting.  Our most famous  (actually only semi-famous) personality here is that of Roddy Piper (""your soul was lost in the rivaaaaaa!""), a former professional wrestler who had a brief stint of success on American WWF back in the 80's.  This guy MUST be THE wikepedia definition of overacting but needless to say, he is the best of the cast (or should I say, least awful actor in the movie) Another overactor is the villain, some Canadian dude who can't act his way out of a box but can over act his way out of anything.  As for the bad acting..it is rampant..like a stage 4 cancer actually. Ironically, the WORST acting comes from our young protagonist..the kid who plays Billy Owens himself...but do we really need good actors with a script like this?  Finally, I will say that the ONE saving grace of this straight to DVD Harry Potter clone is the camera work...THIS is the one thing that the Canadians seem to get right!  There are many nice shots of the incandescent Canada and ""Spirit River"".... wherever the hell that is. Lastly I will say that this DVD will actually have a sequel soon! Something like ""Billy Owens and secret of runes!?"" ..this should be good!  Although it looks like Roddy Piper won't be joining us for this grand and epic adventure (maybe he was refused the 3 thousand dollars his agent demanded) perhaps it will feature another unemployed wrestler who hails from the great white North!  Regardless, I will of course watch it but perhaps wait to purchase until the third installment is released and there is a deluxe edition Billy Owens trilogy DVD set with the works!!!!!",1249603200,9,3527,5.039586919104991

3872914,1,B0028QM25A,"I watched this years ago when I was about 10 and thought this was terrible; you can practically see the edge of the halloween mask in one scene, I couldn't tell the boss, ""dragon"", was dead till they announced because the CGI was so bad, the plot is all over the place, the camera is worse than my grandpa's flip phone from the 1990's, the angles looks like Stevie Wonder shot it, this is the most obvious rip off I have ever seen since the cover looks almost identical to the cover of harry potter, and I can't believe how they made any money off of this garbage.

3872924,2,B0028QM25A,"In a time of excellent FX and top notch acting, I was disappointed with both.  The acting was definitely NOT first class.  Is there such a thing as a C rated movie?

On the bright side, the story itself was good.  The constant revelation of good morals and educational enlightenment was great for a young audience.  I think some of it was a bit overdone, but since it's geared towards kids, I doubt they'll notice.",1394582400,,414,4.466666666666667

But I want to warn people not to buy the movie.  My kids didn't even like it.  That's saying a lot.  For a more thorough review, see the others below.  :(",1393804800,,310,4.083333333333333
3872926,2,B0028QM25A,"Whudda gem. I can't decide what I love more about this movie.  The fact that no one can act (even though they believe they can), the pitiful ""graphics"", the adult actors who are WAY too serious, the over cliche and Harry-Potter influenced script, the line ""Billy, all I know is that the key.... well... it's the key."" All I can say is that the screenwriter has an interesting style...to say the least! Oh... yah and those vines...can we just take a moment to appreciate the attention to detail and the production values (AKA the clearance section of Michael's floral department.) I just love those linking ivy chains!...all two of them. There seems to be just enough seriousness in the acting that it is somewhat off-putting. Favorite character...well they are all so good...without a doubt has to be the  guard at the library. But was it really a library or the office of the wife of some production assistant that they put a few books in lets be real. The plot...I am still trying to follow what took place in this hour plot arc...I am having difficulty processing; between the alter of destiny, the key, the master #(...?), and the abandoned pawn shop guy...it's just too much, we just need to simplify everything.  Overall there were lots of choices made with this film directionally, dramatically, and artistically... some of which I applaud and most with which I strongly disagree... all I can say is this was, is, and will always be in my mind and should be in the minds of all who experience it ""the best worst movie ever.""",1378252800,5,1531,4.684014869888476
3872927,1,B0028QM25A,"On his 11th birthday, a boy purchases a wand at a second-hand shop and learns that he can do magic with it. He has two friends - a boy who isn't the brightest or the bravest - and a girl who is an annoying know-it-all.

This film is an excessively poor knock-off of the Harry Potter stories. Special effects are barely present and very amateurish. There is an animated dragon that must be fought...I have seen scarier kittens.

Samples of the far less than stellar dialogue include:

1) ""All I can tell you about the key is...it's the key.""
2) ""There is an air of promise in the air.""
3) ""Did you know that friendship is the strongest bond between two friends?""

The one redeeming bit of dialogue:

""Real heroes aren't knights in armor or men in capes. Heroes are those people who are willing to fight for what's right, not knowing if they can do it or not. Billy knew he had to try and we knew we had to help him.""

Do not let that last quote fool you. This movie is complete rubbish. I had to fight to stay awake. The acting ranged from simply reciting lines to being flat, emotionless, overacted, etc. Very two-dimensional.

To add insult to injury, the film ""ended"" with ""To Be Continued"" across the screen.

No, thank you. I have had enough. Please do not waste your time or money. If you think the general premise is interesting, you should read/watch Harry Potter, where you can find an actually compelling, thought-out story, with complex characters and intriguing plot developments.",1356307200,,1491,4.558052434456929
3872928,1,B0028QM25A,"Before I go in to details of this garbage, let me just say don't by the movie! I was lucky because I bought the movie for 5 bucks, instead of the outrages price it is being sold for here!

Billy Owens, is a cheap Harry Potter knockoff. The lead character, Billy Ownes(Harry Potter)finds a magic wand in a store shop owned by a wise wizard (Dumbledore) he and his friends, Mandy(Hermoine) and What's His Name (Ron), must go on some task to save their town.

The script seemed to be written by some third grader who just finished watching Harry Potter. The movie is hard to follow. At first Billy Owens seems to be the only child with magic abilities and then every one in the town has magic to.

The villian of the story seems to change every three minutes and the biggest threat of all is a vine.

The film had terrible effects, terrible acting, terrible script, terrible camera crew!

Bottom Line....the movie's GARBAGE!

Avoid at all cost!",1279238400,3,941,4.5058823529411764
3872929,1,B0028QM25A,"Oh my gosh, I bought this from a movie rental store going out of business.  the cuteness of the actor on the front lured me.  (He looks like my cousin son)  Anyway, this ishte worst movie I have ever seen.  Bad acting, horrible storyline/plot, less than amateur special effects.  All of this has been commented on, so I will touch on the bad editing.
An example-The kids steal the book from the library at night, are in school what  we assume is the next day, are back at Billy's house doing homework in the evening, a TV news crew broadcast that the book had just been  stolen at 7pm that night.

The story was nonexistent.  Its like someone said ""hey here's an idea-a viking, a dragon and a river, now ad-lib your dialogue.""",1275264000,3,726,4.398496240601504
3872930,1,B0028QM25A,"OK, so we took a chance and rented this. This film had some promising parts and couple good laughs from the energetic kids, but many parts were just badly done and badly acted. The kids for the most part were ok, particularly the lead boy who I think was fun to watch. But some of the the adult actors...unbelievably emotionless and very difficult to watch. Roddy Piper was not bad, a little over the top sometimes, but he would have been a good addition to a talented cast...however, this was for the most part not a talented adult cast. The film started off going downhill with CG effects that made me shake my head (think Pete's Dragon from 1977). The plot was just plain difficult to follow. What really killed it for me was when totally unbelievable things happened, and the parents and other adults and even the ""bully"" kid were completely unfazed...like this stuff happens every day...totally emotionless.

All I can say is this had a couple decent parts but could have been much better with an understandable plot that made any kind of sense and some serious acting improvement. One Star!",1265587200,9,1096,4.678756476683938
3872931,2,B0028QM25A,"OK- I'm giving this two stars instead of one only because I applaud Mr. ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper (who is an Associate Producer on this film) and the film makers for trying to make some kind of ""family friendly entertainment""

The cover of the DVD seduced us to rent it, but the film is laugh-out-loud BAD throughout.  The film was obviously a VERY, VERY LOW BUDGET attempt to capitalize on  the popularity of Harry Potter, but without any of the charm, character development, dialogue, actors, or the special effects budget of the Potter films.

The children in the film are stiff and unnatural, and the adults are even MORE stiff and unnatural.  The acting is just plain terrible, but who can help it with dialogue like this?  Mr. Roddy Piper is actually the only one with any acting chops whatsoever in the film...if that tells you anything.

Even the kids (7 & 10) laughed out loud at the poor execution of parts of the film- it became fun to watch only for making fun of how poorly it was done.

The story itself actually seems rather original...if you can follow it!  It's a convoluted and confusing mess about Viking runes and a river dragon and being born on November 11th.  Some stand out dialogue includes:

""All I can tell you about the key is...it's the key.""
""There is an air of promise in the air.  Can you feel it?""",1262304000,6,1324,4.516806722689076
3872932,1,B0028QM25A,"This movie was good if it's a homemade movie.  Not so good if it's an independent film.  And down right horrible if it was professionally done! It looks like a movie a bunch of kids made, and young kids at that.  I've seen teens do a much better job at homemade movies.  The only funny part was the fat security gaurd getting stuck at the library, otherwise very, very boring.  Our 9-year old fell asleep watching it.  The older kids kept hoping it would get better. I'm doubting the sequel will be any better, but we can always hope so.",1255564800,6,537,4.32
3872933,1,B0028QM25A,"If you have a list of movies you would like to purchase for yourself, gift or children this should NOT be on it.  Actually, YOU could have made this movie.  The acting is non-existant, period.  The plot is weak to predictable and hopefully they spend less than $1000 making it as that is how it looks and feels.  I was tired of watching it within the first minutes as it was painful to endure.  Referrences to Harry Potter, etc., are pure imagination and creative marketing.

8356640,5,B0028QM25A,"This excellent and well made movie blew my expectations out of the water. The realistic-fantasy genre has become stale with the typical movies and same plot lines. Billy Owens takes what you think you know about the genre and throws a new original twist on everything you think you know. The acting seems to come straight from a Shakespearean era play. Often child actors do not know how to act, but in this movie, the children have found their own niche and show promise for what they will do in the future even. Special effects were well placed and seemed almost life like! The plot kept it interesting and all followed a concise and well thought out course of events. Overall, one of my favorite movies to come out!",1481155200,,718,4.573643410852713
