2293974,4,B0009IW8DK,"Courtesy of Unearthed films, this DVD is a complete and essential package for those wanting to explore the works of Spanish cult director Nacho Cerda.  We get all 3 of his short films and a boatload of extras to boot.  But before you read any further, I will issue a warning.  If the sight of blood makes you the least bit queasy, do not view &#8220;Aftermath&#8221;.  If you see yourself as some sort of hot-shot horror aficionado because &#8220;I dig gory films such as Dawn of the Dead and Evil Dead&#8221; then stay far away from this, because you won't be prepared for what's about to unfold on your screen.  Why would I go out of my way to watch something like this?  Well for two major reasons 1) I'm a hardcore horror fanatic whose always looking for something to push my boundaries and 2) because these films are a prime example of DIY filmmaking, beautifully made despite a micro-budget and by a director who refuses to compromise his style and vision for the hope of commercial success.

THE AWAKENING (B&W, 1990): A bored, underachieving student doses off in class and when he awakens he finds everything to be frozen in place as if time stood still.  Cerda's twilight zone-ish debut film, this is rudimentary filmmaking at best, made with no budget when Cerda was a film student at USC.  Despite the zero budget, The Awakening does keep us intrigued during the length of its scant 5-minute run time.  This short explores the first step in the process of dying &#8211; actual physical death, and should be viewed first to appreciate Cerda's evolution as a maker of short, silent films.

AFTERMATH (Colour, 1994): This 30-minute short is one of the most brutal, graphic and uncompromising things ever put to celluloid.  Still, it should not be viewed simply as exploitation, this is actually a well-filmed and artsy piece of work.  The transfer is beautiful and the picture crystal-clear, free of the grain that plagued the original video format.

Aftermath explores the second step in the process of death: What happens to the body after death.  Plot:  In an autopsy room, two coroners carry on their grisly deeds which are gory but at this point nothing seems inherently wrong.  Until one of the two coroners is left alone with the body of a beautiful female, then things get really wild.  By now he's no longer just doing a job, emotions have taken over and we watch his descent into madness as the corpse is raped, the private parts stabbed along with other unpleasantries that I refuse to go into in further detail.

Aftermath is utterly difficult watch.  The graphic nature of the barbaric acts is the main reason of course, but also because of the de-facto way in which things are presented to us; these scenes of necrophilia are not fetishized a la Jorg Buttgereit's Nekromantik films, instead they are presented to us as the horrible, unpleasant and sick practice that it really is.  You will not be turned on in any way sexually by watching this one, I can guarantee you that.  As much as Cerda might try to put some sort of philosophical spin on it, Aftermath has no point whatsoever aside from wanting to shock and revolt.  Still, it's essential genre viewing for gorehounds and because, well, something like this has never quite been done before has it?

GENESIS (Colour, 1998):  Genesis premiered at Montreal's Fantasia film festival to scores of applause even though the end result is different than what most people were likely expecting from a Nacho Cerda film.

Plot:  A sculptor loses his wife in a tragic car accident.  He then sculpts a statue of her, which eventually begins to bleed from a wound in its chest.  In a desperate bid to give her back life, the sculptor begins to open wounds on his own body in an attempt to offer his life for hers.  As the sculpture begins to gain life, the artist slowly begins to lose his.

Genesis is free of graphic grotesqueries and its fantasy theme of a statue coming to life is in stark contrast to the brutal realism of Aftermath but still Genesis is not quite the radical departure from his other work that others might think it is.  This is unquestionably the director's unique stamp and style.  It also makes for a perfect companion piece to Aftermath as it explores the 3rd stage of death, which is what happens to the survivor after a loved one dies.  Beautiful and haunting, Genesis is another film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.

The special features are among some of the best I've ever seen.  This one's packed to the rafters with goodies such as a director commentary track for all 3 films where Cerda explains in fluent English how the films came to be made.  We also get a 20-minute film on &#8220;The making of Aftermath&#8221;, trailers, storyboards, production stills and best of all, a 10-minute dual interview with Nacho Cerda and German madman Jorg Buttgereitt of Nekromantik fame.",1125705600,35,4895,4.709753231492362
2293975,4,B0009IW8DK,"After seeing the first few minutes of Aftermath, I have to say that it is a beautiful and disturbing piece of work. The quality of the filming is very good and the lighting used was spot on.

Its a film that will stay in memory for a long time after after viewing and I am sure that many people will be sickened by the taboo subject matter of necrophillia.

It really does make you wonder about what goes on behind closed doors and I am pretty sure that all the people who work in morgues are a select breed who have their own reasons for doing such an unpleasant job. My one complaint about the film is that I felt that the bodies in the film looked very Rubbery and lightweight! theres one scene where one of the bodies is lifted and dropped onto the slab which looked very fake in my opinion, but I guess with the budget Mr Cerda had at the time he would have had the best he could afford!

All in all I loved the film and all the extra stuff that came on the disc was well done.",1125532800,,982,4.051546391752577
2293976,5,B0009IW8DK,"The Awaking wasn't too great maybe if it had a budget it would have been a more profound film like the other two movies. Aftermath was quite bleak and disturbing, yet something just didn't seem right to me. Maybe that's the point of it though. Genesis was my favorite out of the three shorts. It was beautifully shot and more thought out at least to me. There was also more of an emotional feeling conveyed by it that wasn't in the other two films.",1125187200,,448,4.345238095238095
2293977,4,B0009IW8DK,"This DVD consists of three short films by Nacho Cerda. Each concerns a death theme and are best viewed in order. ""The Awakening"" is a very short black and white student film the director made early in his career. It basically illustrates the moments one experiences at the time of death. The print used shows a little wear and tear but not enough to really distract from the viewing experience. The second and most sought after is ""Aftermath"". This film is notorious for its lengthy sequence concerning a female corpse and the morgue worker who is really into his job. Well done camera work, interesting visuals throughout and a seriously creepy feel make this the best of the three if you can handle the subject matter. It is extremely graphic. The third film is ""Genesis"" and it concerns a man grieving over the loss of his wife. He spends most of his time creating a life-like sculpture of her and soon realizes that there is more to this work of art than just clay. ""Genesis"" is easily the least of the three films and reminds me more of Asian films like ""Tetsuo"". The DVD has many extras, most notably, commentary by the director and an interview with Jorg Buttgereit of ""Nekromantik"" fame. I would think that anyone who is into Jorg's films would certainly like this, for everyone else, if you are able to handle the extreme taboos of ""Aftermath"" give it a shot.",1125100800,8,1368,4.610655737704918
2293978,4,B0009IW8DK,"For gorehounds, fans of extreme violence and anyone else with an eye for the grotesque.  The thing is though, Aftermath is a beautifully shot and very slick and polished short film. The subject matter and content can be considered gross and unwatchable by some but it is handled as a genuine work of art. It is coupled with two other shorts(the follow up Genesis and another short the director made in college). Recommended for all that can handle it, highly recommended for fans of extreme horror.",1124582400,2,498,4.790697674418604

2293990,5,B0009IW8DK,"Nacho Cerda has been a huge name on the short film circuit for many years for his works which deal primarily with the dreaded subject of death. Perhaps no other director comes to mind when we think of the fascinating topic which has enthralled people from all cultures throughout the course of humankind. It is not uncommon or unheard of to dwell on the various aspects of crossing over or what really happens when we make that traumatic journey from our earthly residence into the unknown. Nacho Cerda has crafted what many should deem to be silent cinema for the new era & his vision is unparalleled in my book.

With only three short films, Cerda has captured the most beautiful yet disturbing images on film by means of a limited budget. Like many great directors who are virtually struggling in the dog-eat-dog industry, Nacho refuses to compromise his style in hopes of any commercial success but rather chooses to illustrate some of the mysteries of death through the use of film. Only the viewers themselves can be a judge of how well he achieves this goal but I'd say the man has surpassed my expectations in nearly every way possible. Personally, I would suggest watching them in order.

The first short film is completely B&W & might even remind one of old Twilight Zone shows on TV or perhaps something more modern like a student film one could come across in college. Although shot on a mere shoestring budget, Cerda really makes the most of every cent here by giving us a chilling view of a young man who awakes to find everyone in his class room frozen. Although the short film does end on a rather somber or tragic note, the viewer is then consoled with the image of a beautiful angel standing in the doorway ready to take the recently deceased into another realm.

What happens to our bodies when we leave this plane of existence? After all, our bodies are merely just shells that we are only borrowing or renting for a brief time span & one day we will depart from them even though I hate to think of such a hideous notion. The spirit itself will take that final step off the platform we know as life & hopefully make it's way onto a better place. At this point in time, we are no longer in control of what takes place regarding our bodies. Even though our souls may be granted that final destination, the human remains are merely at the mercy of another human.

Aftermath is a rather gruesome, if not uber-gory short film which seems to be all the rage with lovers of extreme cinema or just plain gore hounds in need of a fix. Within a mere 30 minutes, you will need to brace yourself for some of the most ugly images one could ever imagine as a coroner carries out his grisly deeds on a cadaver after another coroner has already left the building. Mind you, we are subjected to a rather interesting display of what an actual autopsy might be like & the rather unpleasant side of the entire ordeal. I won't go into many specific here of course but I will tell you that the unspeakable acts committed in this autopsy room are not easily forgotten & are almost unwatchable. There is nothing here at the beginning nor the end to provide any solace or comfort unfortunately.

The final short film entitled Genesis is perhaps the most beautiful work of all. Although the end result is anything but what a Cerda fan might expect, it's perhaps my favorite short film of the three. A sculptor tries desperately to deal with the sorrow in his life after recently losing his wife in an automobile accident. Unable to cope with his loss, he begins to sculpt a statue which closely resembles his deceased love. As the sculpture becomes more life-like, the sculptor begins to lose his own life. Although tragic & even a tad shocking, it's a beautifully filmed work of art that was praised by many upon it's premiere at the Montreal's Fantasia film festival.",1291075200,,3863,4.544540229885057
2293991,4,B0009IW8DK,"What happens when you die?  What was the first thing you thought of when you read that question?  Most people would immediately think about whether there is a Heaven or Hell.  ""Aftermath"", the controversial 30 minute short from Spanish director Nacho Cerd takes a look at (in graphic detail) what happens to the body after death.

The second short film in a trilogy, ""Aftermath"" is easily the best and hardest to watch.  The others include ""The Awakening"" which deals with the first part of death, the process of dying.  ""Aftermath"" being the second, explores what happens to the body after death.  The third film, ""Genesis"", looks at the affect death has on the surviving family/friends.

This powerful film is not for the easily offended or those with a weak stomach.  There is no dialogue and primarily takes place in an actual morgue.  ""Aftermath"" will make you question how you want your body handled after death and it will open your eyes to the horror that is present in the world.  Cerd decided to make a film that covered both issues when I suppose he could have stuck to one.  Although this is only 30 minutes, after the second act you will feel as if you have been watching for hours.  That is if you make it to the second act.  Make no mistake, this is 30 minutes of the raw, uncompromising reality of Autopsy's.

That being said...there are some things you should keep in mind while watching in order to understand, respect and ultimately enjoy what Nacho Cerd has put together. You have to take into account the cinematography, the fact there is no spoken dialogue, the soundtrack and the moral questions it brings out of you.  Cerd did an AMAZING job with the filming using slow moving camera work mixed with an eerie classical soundtrack. Speaking of sound, the sound effects were that of a big budget film. The clarity and realness was nearly more disgusting and frightening than the action on screen.  I cringed more from the sound than the visuals at times.

This film makes the viewer think about what happens after death.  Most people may think their soul leaves them and their ""temple"" aka body gets laid quietly to rest. They don't think about what goes on between the time of passing and when the body is six feet under or cremated.  They certainly don't think about how the autopsy will go or what will happen with their organs if they are an organ donor.  The first person doing the autopsy seems to have no care in the world for the body he is mutilating; however, you later realize that he is just trying to do his job (quickly) and get out. I would be the same way.  Wouldn't you? Then you're left to realize the second character, meticulously played by Pep Tosar, is really the sicko.

The second short film in a trilogy, ""Aftermath"" is easily the best and hardest to watch.  The others include ""The Awakening"" which deals with the first part of death, the process of dying.  ""Aftermath"" being the second, explores what happens to the body after death.  The third film, ""Genesis"", looks at the affect death has on the surviving family/friends.

""Aftermath"" may be a lot more than most people can handle, but if you can put aside the ""shock"" of seeing a graphic autopsy and sickening necrophilia what you are left with is an important film that begs the viewer to confront their thoughts of what happens after you die. A powerful film.

2293992,3,B0009IW8DK,"Having finally got hold of a copy of Aftermath I must admit I was surprised but not for the obvious reasons cited in connection with the Film. It was far more stylish, atmospheric and well-filmed than I'd originally expected. This is itself signals Cerda's desire to elevate this above the usual Teenage Gore-Hound depictions of death and far beyond the kind of so-badly-filmed-it-must-be-Art stuff purveyed by Jorg Butgereit. Personally I found the most gorey effects unconvincing, which rather undermined the impact. The Bodies of the dissected man and especially Marta, the girl defiled by the Pathologist,are obviously made out of Latex. The movement of the skin, obviously painted discolourations  and the rubbery-regidity of the cadavers when being moved help to spoil the illusion. In the girl's case she looks like an expensive Inflatable Doll when seen in profile, and the crushed and eviscerated Dog during the title sequence is faintly ludicrous with it's excessive amount of Blood and Entrails etc. Pep Tosar's performance as the necrophiliac Pathologist is expressive, but spoiled by his noises and exclamations which make him sound like a comedy dirty old man watching a girl undress. I expected him to be wearing a dirt fawn Raincoat under his smocks.
Having said all of this the Film is still thought-provoking in it's treatment of how we will all be stripped on dignity after death and I'm sorry that it's reputation means that it attracts the kind of viewer who's only interested in the amount of gore it contains and may repeal those who would find it's meditation on the nature of death fascinating.",1287964800,,1619,5.086466165413534
2293993,1,B0009IW8DK,"I heard about this flick years ago but at the time it was an obscene cost to buy.
So finally I looked and found just 2 weeks ago. Wow what trash.
I don't know how anyone could be shocked or upset after watching.
The bodies were fake as hell. In no way looked real. Only one body that of a man with a Italian stash, but you will see no actual cutting was near this guy, just clever film cutting.
I was expecting awesome effects but this looks beyond trash. Maybe this was cool back in the 80's when the crap was filmed but this stands to be more of a joke than anything. Right down to the horrible dog at the start of this crap.
Even when he was humping the body, keep your hands to your sides and save the paper towles, if thats your kind of thing. Cuz it was so sexless and stupid. Her chest was open. It wasn't like he had sex with the woman. It was that of an open wound. Dumb.

2293994,1,B0009IW8DK,"GENESIS: Goofy horror story of a statue of a sculptor's dead wife's statue bleeding and then the sculptor turning to stone, while she generates to flesh and bone. [...]I laughed at most of it; when I wasn't reading a book or surfing the NET. That's how bored I was. Honestly, after the first 5 minutes in the sculptor's shop, everything is predictable.

AFTERMATH: Starts off with blood and viscera from a slaughtered dog. Bodies being ""worked on"" in a morgue (i.e. autopsy) by guys who looked like they enjoy their work. One guy takes the brain out of a body and then deposits it into the chest cavity of said deceased (is that SOP?). He then works on a female body and starts doing ""his thing"" after cutting her up. Pretty sick. I could go on and on. If you have a weak stomach, you'll probably barf.

However I was amazed at the stylish quality of the film and the feelings the film created. This is one you have to see at least once (and possibly more).

2293996,3,B0009IW8DK,"Aftermath (Nacho Cerda, 1994)

Nacho Cerda's infamous short (half an hour) film Aftermath is a love-it-or-hate-it affair. Unlike most films of this stripe, it's not an easy split; you can't simply say that gorehounds and perverts will like it and everyone else won't. And that should clue you in that there's something beyond gore, necrophilia, and a really twisted (but damned funny) punchline going on under the surface here. This is where the split occurs; if you can grok what Cerda seems to be saying, and you've got a strong enough stomach to take it in the way Cerda dishes it out, you're probably going to like this. You may never watch it again, but you can appreciate it on some level.

Aftermath takes us behind the scenes at a medical examiner's office. I want to say here that it's not your normal medical examiner's office, but we don't know, do we? One way or the other, however, the guys who work here are just plain scary. In the first of the two extended sequences that make up this movie, there's nothing terribly amiss on the surface, but you can tell there's something wrong about the whole scene. No one speaks, the characters simply grunt to one another or to themselves. And yet there's a language here, one that we can eventually begin to puzzle out. And when we get to that point, our suspicions that our characters are not nice people really takes off. And then comes the second scene, which is the one that sends most people out into the streets holding placards and calling for Nacho Cerda's head on a platter.

I first saw the infamous second scene years ago, when a band I saw live used it as a filmic backdrop to their music. I was drunk at the time, and thus misremembered some things about it that kept me from seeing the whole thing until now. I remembered it being a great deal funnier (unintentionally) than it is (for those of you who've seen it, I recalled the ME actually holding the camera while he was, erm, having fun. You can see where the hilarity came into play). If you've got a really, really warped sense of humor, it is kind of amusing, in a ""blackest of the black"" sort of way; if you wondered why people called Very Bad Things a black comedy, because to you it seemed like slapstick, then you'll probably appreciate Cerda's nihilist form of humor here. The rest of you are watching it for the necrophilia. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying there's anything at all erotic about this. Quite the contrary-- and that's what Cerda's getting at, I believe.

Then comes the final scene. Maybe it wasn't necessary-- Cerda definitely used a bigger mallet than necessary to drive his point home here-- but when it comes right down to it, if you want to view Aftermath as a black comedy, the final scene is most certainly necessary.

So what is it that Cerda's trying to say with his ""evil"" (for lack of a better term) medical examiners and these poor abused corpses? I don't think, as some folks have offered, that Cerda's point is that when we're dead, we become nothing more than meat. I think it's more about the loss of control-- once a person is dead, those around that person have the ability to visit any sort of horror upon the body that they like, and aside from the ethical questions (which our characters have obviously ignored), there's really nothing that the dead can do to stop them. (This is, it seems to me, what Cerda is really trying to hammer home in the final scene-- the real depths of the lack of control.)

Given all this, I do think it's a thought-provoking little piece, though gorehounds and the perverse will certainly find enough packed into this half-hour to sate their more prurient tastes. While there is no conceivable way to posit that Aftermath is fun for the whole family, it is worth seeing if you've got the stomach for it. ***",1212105600,6,3813,4.542940320232897
2293997,1,B0009IW8DK,"This has got to be the most depraved and horrible film I have ever seen. There is no value to this film at all. The plot is weak (if you can call it a plot), the effects are disturbing but still lame. I've got to say if you watch this film and enjoy it, there is something wrong with you in the head. I can understand wanting to see a gorey movie, but this film goes beyond gore. The entire story is about a guy mutilating a dead female body and having sex with it (it is very graphic). There you go! That's 30 minutes of your life! I want my 30 minutes back! I am boycotting this film based on it being one of the worst films ever made!",1209513600,5,637,3.9076923076923076

The reason I give this DVD 4 stars is because of the shear shock value alone. I think Aftermath is a mix of Faces Of Death and Nekromantik. Genesis and Awakening were just plain boring. Aftermath was not exactly entertaing, The good gore was what made it good.

For fans of hardcore horror, You will like these. Just remember that these films end before they start, I think they would have been better as feature lenght films.

2294009,5,B0009IW8DK,"The subject of death is rarely exposed or investigated with any sort of tangible certainty.  Possibly in an effort to diminish its ominous threat, the topic is often ignored.  Or sometimes it is romanticized, with fabrications of some angelic getaway just waiting for us.  But, in reality, it is a looming question mark that has no definite answers.
Nacho Cerda is a courageous director that doesn't back down from these notions.  This release actually has three short movies

~Awakening--This is only like 7 minutes long, and it deals almost entirely with spirituality.  It is beautifully shot with kind of a twilight zone feel.

~Aftermath--It deals with the physicality of death. It is extremely grotesque, plus the special effects are incredibly realistic as some cadavers get sliced up and some...uh,...sick stuff happens.  Really sick.

~Genesis--This final one deals with the emptiness that is left behind after a lover passes away.  This guy has some issues letting go.

Total running time is about an hour and a half.  They are all superbly shot in a very artistic manner.  You might not always be delighted by this artistic expression.  They contain no dialogue, just stark, black and white images that will supplant all your expectations.

2294010,3,B0009IW8DK,"There are many things that can be said about Nacho Cerda's ""Death Trilogy"" most of them having to do with the shockingly brutal Aftermath but viewed as a whole the trilogy is surprisingly artistic and lyrical. Unearthed Video presents all three shorts with a wealth of supplements on a one disc special edition.

The Awakening (1991) starts the series. This is an eight minute student film shot in grainy black and white. The theme of the film is the physical sensation of dying. Time stands still, moments of your life pass by, one sees the physical body as it dies and finally there is peace represented by a calling angel.

Aftermath (1994) is probably the single most controversial film of the last 20 years. This film deals with what happens to the body after death while  in the hands of the coroners. This film shows in  graphic detail the desecration that happens to the body of a young woman killed in an auto accident. This film is not for the weak of heart and will haunt your dreams. Despite its subject matter it does have redeeming qualities and is excellently made.

Genesis (1998) deals with those left behind to grieve. In it an artist tries to make the perfect statue of his deceased love one only to find himself turning to stone in his attempts. The film is haunting and lyrical in its beauty compared to the outright brutality of Aftermath.

The presentation by Unearthed is surprisingly good for such extreme material. There are a good selection of bonus materials including commentaries by Cerda on each of the films; extensive storyboard sequences on each of the films and some photo galleries. The  materials for Aftermath are the most extensive and include several interviews with the director including a 45 minute audio interview conducted for the Montreal film festival.

Altogether an interesting presentation for those who can stomach it.",1193875200,2,1869,4.855345911949685

I keep reading reviews that ""it is too predictable"" or ""it wasn't long enough"" but gore does not need length to be effective, and as far as being predictable, Amazon spells out the whole 30 minutes for you in the plot summary.  These people are most likely not into just pure gore.  There is no dialogue just a classical score and it worked perfectly.  Plenty of gore to go around in this 30 minute blood bath.  What better setting for a gore film than a coroner's lab?  My only problem with the film is that the necrophilia scene in my opinion could have been more explicit.  If you enjoy such quality film making as the the Guinea Pig Collection (the gorier films such as Flower of Flesh and Blood, Mermaid in a Manhole, etc.) then this film is for you.

is something you will never forget ! and wath this guy does to the cadavre

at the end....... you won't beleave your eyes !!!! This came out in like in 1997 and the dvd , almost 10 years latter is worth every penny !! Plenty of xtra, pakaging is a+, go buy it now !!!!!!",1179100800,,719,4.028169014084507
2294015,2,B0009IW8DK,"I often hear people praise Aftermath for it's innovation and originality. I just can't see it. Yes the makeup is pretty good for it's budget and for that I'll give the devil his due but the movie is just plan tasteless and sickening. you are probably thinking. ""Well it's tasteless and sickening. perfect qualities for a horror film!"" yes and no. I agree that a horror movie should make your skin crawl and make you feel uncomfortable, but aftermath is a film depicting perverse violence against women. Not really something that I get my jollies watching. The whole film is about a mortician who uses his subjects as sex toys and violates them with surgical tools. When he's gone he cuts them up and feed them to his dog. End cut release. End of film. no dialog just a bare bones plot and very disgusting imagery. I love horror flicks but this just went too far and it did it in a very non graceful manner. More of a snuff film than a horror flick. If you like seeing women violated and humiliated that this is your movie. otherwise give it a pass.",1178150400,2,1048,4.435233160621761
2294016,5,B0009IW8DK,Well what can I say?Nacho Cerda's only reason to make this is to shock and offend and he pulls it off great. No doubt one of the sickest short films ever made.

2294017,2,B0009IW8DK,"I was looking forward to these films after hearing so much about them.  My advice is not to waste your time.  Luckily, they are only 30 minutes apiece.  There is a student film on here called The Awakening, but I was so bored and disappointed by the first two films I skipped it.  Aftermath is the film that most people talk about.  It starts out well, with some good atmosphere and excellent camera work, but then goes downhill from there.  It's actually very boring, despite the intense gore.  It's rather predictable that the morgue attendant would be a necrophiliac.  Nacho Cerda, the filmmaker, just went out of his way to shock people.  I have seen tons of ""hardcore"" cinema, and this stuff didn't bother me.  There was no real soul or art to the film, which makes it just an exercise in style, and a rather tedious one at that.  If you want to see an artistic film about a morgue, watch Stan Brakhage's The Act of Seeing With One's Own Eyes.  Brakhage films actual autopsies, and there is a strange, mystical, even spiritual quality to Brakhage's film.  That is nowhere to be found here.  The other film, Genesis, doesn't fare much better.  Genesis starts out to be another exercise in style, with some really obvious acting by the lead actor.  There are several lame dream sequences here, and it gets pretty dull very fast.  The ending isn't too bad, but the first 25 minutes or so of Genesis are just an ordeal to sit through.  A rather disappointing evening.",1164153600,4,1468,4.5807692307692305
2294018,5,B0009IW8DK,"I saw a degenerated copy of Aftermath some 7 or 8 years ago.  When I was digging around for a copy on DVD in September of this year and found it here I was in heaven.  Yes, it is gory, yes it is about necrophilia, yes it is about a man who loves his dog.  I always say that when I describe this film because to me it is all about power, desire, and the stark contrasts of one man's life.  The clean, final, and very clinical world our medical examiner deals with everyday is the opposite of the very visceral longings that he must succumb to by the ""money shot"" of the film.  Even his home is very clean and orderly, the only disorder is in himself.  With no dialog in the film and most of his face covered by a surgical mask everything is expressed in the eyes.  The long looks, the anger, the violence, the want and need, even the satisfaction.  It is visually a treat and I think one of those gore gems every fan should watch with someone they love.  Personally I took it to a party at a friend's house, who had built his own personal theatre.  We started with a packed house and ended with three people (by the by, party poppers at the right moment will make people jump out of their skin).",1163721600,4,1194,4.12987012987013
2294029,4,B0009IW8DK,"Of the three short films here, I only enjoyed ""Aftermath.""  ""The Awakening"" is a shoestring student film, and ""Genesis,"" while beautifully shot, bored me.

""Aftermath,"" however, which explores that taboo subject of necrophilia, is a seriously depraved short film.  A demented coroner indulges in his fetish with a recently-arrived corpse, and his violent sexual urges build to a frenzy (the scene is both gory and sad, since Cerda focuses on the poor woman's face, highlighting the utter violation of the act).

The ending doesn't quite fit -- and though they get most of the autopsy procedures right, there are a few mistakes (I don't know how they do it in Spain, but in America you don't make the Y incision with a butcher knife!) -- but this is a must for the extreme horror crowd, and it's probably one of the few films you'll see that will make you want to vomit and cry at the same time.",1158364800,3,894,4.639240506329114

Awakening is Cerda's student film. While its low resource origins are apparant, it is still engaging.

Genesis is a truly beautiful film about death, rebirth, and sacrifice.",1147046400,3,391,4.82089552238806
2294031,4,B0009IW8DK,"i am a fan of extreme horror, i enjoy things such as the august underground movies, cannibal holocaust, cannibal ferox, for a few examples. so if you enjoy these types of flicks you may want to keep readding. if those movies disgusted you, you may want to look up anouther movie and read there reviews

the awakening- this short, has a good concept but you can tell that this was one of  nacho cerdas first attempts at making a movie, the use of the all seeing eye was a good effect. but not the best short ive seen, but also not by far the worst ive seen.

aftermath-this is the movie that put nacho cerdas name on the map, movie if you did not know, is about a doctor performing a auptopsy, and ***SPOILLERS***

ends up with the doctor, sleeping with the corpse. the film is suppost to show, how vunerable the body is after life, which it does a great job at, with such effects as the doctors, just messily placing the organs back into the corpse, and slamming the ribcage down, and trying to smash all the organs back into the chest. this really in my opinion did a good job. and also showing how rough the doctors with the corpse, really makes you not want a aptopsy. now my personal problem was the necro part of the movie, not that it was to far, just personally i do not wish to see this, it was majorly effective.

the camera work in the film, is amazing, the one part i remember being majorly impressed by is the use of reflections, in eyes, and the lens of a camera used as a prop in the movie. this was/ a major upgrade from the first film. all and all i have to say i really enjoyed the flick.

genesis- now this in my opinion was the gen of the dvd. its a romantic story, about a guy that loses his wife in a car axident, and builds a statue, to look like she did. and the statue starts to come to life, but as the statue comes to life, he starts to turn into a statue hisself, so in essence he is dieing while she is comeing to life, and it shows us what happens while all this is happening. its a really great flick if you have a romantic nerve, also there is things in the movie that show irony, such as the use of a unfinished sympathy by i believe its mozart.

the camera work in this one like aftermath, was phominal, every time i watch it i notice things i never noticed before, which to me is a sign of a wonder film.

the extras- the dvd itself comes with a four page insert, which explains the history of the films, and the feeling of the editor of the movie ultra violent. its very informitive little booklet. the cominteries are also a great way to find things out about the filming of the shorts.",1143763200,2,2622,4.157790927021696

Enter Aftermath.  The effects are amazing.  How can this footage NOT be real.  I'm glad they had a making-of documentary on the disc.

This movie is not for the faint of heart, but if you are a gore hound like me looking for a fix .... here it is!",1142553600,3,525,4.18
2294033,5,B0009IW8DK,"This trio of Death--actually you do have to watch all three versions to get the picture. The first story is about a guy who dies in class, and what may happen to you once your spirit leaves your body. Who knows? It's a short movie...well, perhaps..

The second-which made this trio famous-is aftermath. It's what can happen to your body once your spirit leaves this world. An autopsy is done, and the corpse stabbed repeatedly. then the guy has intercourse with the body. Not one word is said in this whole skit, but you really don't notice that. The facial features make up for the lack of voice. Actually the ""corpse"" he rapes is a plastic dummy, and you can tell it's a plastic dummy, with cheap plastic hair.  The cheapness of this dummy kind of removed the ""creepiness"" of the movie. I didn't find it particularly ""gross out"". (THe only movie that made me make wreching sounds like I was about to vomit was Salo. I was also appalled by the ""Guinae Pig"" which was a japanese gore film series, and Kichiku, which was a work of pure genius and awesome in every way). Aftermath did nothing to me in terms of grossing me out . I guess it had to do with the cheap looking dummy corpse made of plastic and cheap hair. But the question is--WHAT CAN happen to your body after death...not that it matters, but dead men tell no tales....this is what makes you think.

THe third moviette was kind of slow that this dude's wife is killed and he mournes carving a likeness of his dead wife...until it starts bleeding and he slowly turns into a statue while his creation turns into flesh and blood. It's in fact a symbolic thing of what extreme grief can do to a living being and turn him into something dead due to the magnitude of pure sadness: He loses his own life from excessive mourning. It is what happens to loved ones, that ""survivors"".",1134432000,,1835,4.439169139465875
2294034,5,B0009IW8DK,"This is definately one of the best editions I've ever held in my hands. Short films are not a commercial product and don't bring their creators lots of money but here's an idea how to make them profitable - make such DVDs, because for every movie there is a fan.
This edition contains a load of bonus-features so you can get a full perspective of Nacho Cerda's work. As I see it Cerda is extremely talented filmmaker and we may expect some masterpieces from him in future. His first short feature ""Awakening"" is only 6 minutes long and not of a much interest but is very good for a student work, don't skip it. The second - ""Aftermath"" which everyone has been waiting for and which is the reason this DVD saw the light - is utterly gory and repulsive. While watching I was asking myself: why anyone would want to make such a movie? Although I wanted to see it for many years because I'm interested in such macabre themes. First ""Aftermath"" seems to be a pure exploitation film but closer to the end you start getting Cerda's idea. It's not that simple and exploitative as it seems - it's the ultimate insight into death and post-living experience in general. Don't take the name of the film for granted - take a minute to think about it. The point is there's no post-living experience and there's no death, because death is nothing. It's a void. And I think the movie is not about necrophile-pathologist, the main characters are cadavers, and ""Aftermath"" is dedicated to them. I once observed an autopsy live and I must say it's quite an uneasy sight. Not because of all that flesh-slitting and gore and guts. But because in that room you feel that life has stopped there. There's just no life in an autopsy-room. And bodies lying there are not people anymore. And pathologists handle them so harshly the only thought that comes to your mind is: I don't want to end up here where these butchers will treat you like a piece of meat. And I was always wondering: how do pathologists menage to deal with people normally, not like with chunks of meat, after they spend all day long with those chunks? Anyway I'm sure you'll have plenty food for thought after watching this short film.
""Genesis"" is a brilliant picture. Just awesome. Extremely beautiful, sad and majestic. The colors, the cinematography, the music - everything works for it. There's not a single word in the film (as well as in ""Aftermath"") but you don't feel like you need them. As Nacho Cerda says in an interview: ""Silence is golden"". ""Genesis"" is an enchanting masterpice and it's no surprise it got so many prizes and awards. A truly heartbreaking film about love and what love can do. I really felt like sobbing at the end.
So if not take ""Awakening"" it's a two-film edition, both movies are great although very different, both deal with love and death, I'm sure you'll love one of them and maybe both. This DVD is definately worth its money, and even if I thought it would be amuzing, I was taken by surprise because I never could guess it would be so great.

2294036,1,B0009IW8DK,"Nacho Cerda was clearly aiming to position Aftermath as one of those pieces of ""extreme cinema"" that walks the line between mondo/snuff and art, in hopes that it would develop a ""must-have"" reputation among shock-cinema daredevils. My advice? Save your money.

Aftermath's plot (if you can call it that) examines what might occur if a sexually obsessed coroner turned on by the visceral aspects of his job, got a hold of a cadaver he just couldn't resist. This is of course just a flimsy concept concocted to provide a framework for a series of visceral images. However, for all it's realistic gore, Aftermath ultimatley is a ripoff in that the sex is simulated. I'm sorry, but if the conceit here is to assault the viewer with images that go where no film has dared to go before, then you better go all the way. They either couldn't find an ""actor"" to pull this off, or more likely they were afraid of alienating the 18-35 year-old male demographic this film is aimed at by showing male genitalia engaged in hardcore sex with a corpse.

My guess is that most who buy this dud will trot it out to offend their buddies after a few beers, and then it will go back on the shelf or in the bottom of the sock drawer until they admit it was a waste of money.

If you need this kind of stuff, buy Necromantic, at least it's amusing.",1129507200,3,1325,4.444444444444445

Sure the lighting and colors of the film are excellent, but what does that prove about the overall quality of what you are watching? No talking, short running time, and overall cliched boring scenario. Most horror fans want to be shocked, but also provided with dialogue, action, suspense original plot, atmosphere...Aftermath has none of these. I'll admit that it didn't come accross as goofy as Nekromantik did b/c of the overall tone and silence of the film. But yeah, I am not giving this a one-star review b/c I am offended, but rather cause I was bored. I'm not going to even get started on the other short films on this dvd....I hope I helped your decision on whether or not to get this a little easier, cause there is a TON of better horror flicks out there.

It for the movie goer that can handle being a morgue with an autopsy going on and eat their lunch at the same time. And no their not crazy, Just stronger minded.
 I look for over the top brutal gory, disturbing, twisted, insane movies i can find. And this is one of my favorites. I'm a realistic person that i wouldn't  want this sort of thing go on in a Real Morgue, I be piss if my dear family member that pass away treated like this.. But it probably does happen.

8061751,1,B0009IW8DK,"ok, here's the lowdown. In a nutshell this film is indeed sick and disturbing, but in a numbing, bland sort of way. It also didn't seem as realistic or as disturbing as some members said it was. Indeed the most disturbing thing about this film are the scary member reviews. The corpses seemed sort of rubbery in a way, and the gore was pretty much average. This movie brought to mind the X rated 1973 Paul Morrissey film, 'Flesh for Frankenstein'(aka, Andy Warhol's Frankenstein), which in my opinion was sarcastically more disturbing even if it wasn't as realistic looking. Same premise though. In the case of that film Udo Kier disects a much prettier dead female then releases sexually while he plays with her organs. Then mounts her bloody body and has sex with her. That seemed sicker to me than this dribble of a short stupid film. If you really want to get sick and disturbed try watching that horror of a movie, The Butcher. That remains the sickest and most disturbing film I have ever seen. Yes indeed The Butcher is the most sadistic and sick film ever made hands down. More so than Nekromatik or Cannibal Holocaust even. Or even the film called 'The girl next door' adapted from Jack Ketchum's book, which is a true story about a girl who is held captive in a basement then tortured and raped till she dies. This one is tame in comparison to any of those films in my opinion, especially The Butcher. if you really want to see something sick and depraved then see The Butcher. Then you'll know what sick really is. Also an interesting note. Did anyone else think the rapist autopsy doctor looked like Mr. Bean? or is it just me? This movie was terrible and only truly disturbing if you haven't seen some of the other films I have mentioned.",1367884800,,1751,4.544303797468355

After watching with my significant other, while high admittedly, but we had to prepare ourselves for what some other reviewers said was sick, depraved, misogynistic, vile, filth, trash. It scared many a viewer, and left an impression on anyone who saw it. My girlfriend thought it was a pretty F'd up movie, but she watched it thru all the way. I came across a mention of this movie in reviews of another fairly sick movie, Dead Girl, which isn't as good as this. I guess to say ""Good"" would be wrong, but I got what the director was trying to do and he showed me a pretty wild ride, and its a lasting impression on me. The 2nd of the trilogy is the ever-controversial 'Aftermath', which is the star of the show.
