8705007,5,B00UART8AG,"Another great DVD for the Littlest Pet shop fan in your own home. The episodes are a mixture of season two and three, but they were fun and entertaining. That being said you get to know Blythe a bit better in this and she and her Littlest Pet Shop friends have some great adventures. Animation was great and what I have come to expect from this series. In watching this with my own girls they loved the Some Assistance Required episode the best of all of them - outside the Sing-Along bonus feature that is! All-in-all though this was a great DVD!
