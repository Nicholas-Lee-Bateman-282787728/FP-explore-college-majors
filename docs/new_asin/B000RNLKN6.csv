8201519,2,B000RNLKN6,"Clearly a bootleg, and not even a decently subtitled one.",1428451200,,57,4.8
8201520,5,B000RNLKN6,Great product. I was told it arrived very quick. Unfortunately I was out of the country when it arrived.,1428019200,,104,4.526315789473684
8201521,5,B000RNLKN6,"Great DVD set!!!  Has opening and closing only one time on each of the 5 discs, and the English dub sounds great.",1425081600,,113,4.136363636363637
8201522,1,B000RNLKN6,"This First Gundam series I realy wanted to get my hands on. when I got my set. Well Bandai realy cut it up and gave the Cartoon network version and I wasted heck of a lot of money. then I got this set. well the good news is inbeweeen the opening and closing theme. well I did not notice too much cuts and editing.
 The bad news is the opening and closing theme is not on every episode. its done once per disc. I loved the opening theme and its not showed on each eppisode. also this item is not a licneced version and the licenced version is also nuked to the point its not worth a darn $0.01 ( once sent) never mind the 40.00 + shipping. so I do not shop at then online dealer. Told me to send it back however I do not have the time to send stuff. so I am too late
Bandai licneed dvds realy stinks Gundam Seed Vol 1,2,3 dose not work. Bandai lost there customers and looking for fan subs that do not work. like the Gundam 00 seasion 1 and 2 thats done in none licnced do the entire seasion on two dvds when it should be thirteen of dvd's
Its verry hard to contact Bandai and fix there bad production line
 First Gundam and Gundam seed Vol 1,2,3 dose not work. so the Gundam seed rest of the volumes that did work is useless.
and Gundam Seed Destiny did work however useless due to the fact Gundam Seed Vol 1,2,3 did not function and Bandai Lied to me it dose work when it dose not.
Gundam Seed Vol 1,2,3 problems are Dose not go to the next episode then its competed instead it goes to the middle of the epside I did watch and other problems is its programed to go to a strange location on the dvd. Bandai dose not take the time to double check there own work. and refuses to fix it then complain like hell about people buying fan subs. if the liccened version dose not work. so the only option is to find fan subs.  that do not work eather.
I am a no win lost heck of alot of money.
 well on this dvd box set. Mobile Suit Gundam (First Gundam)
you will be disapointed thet the opening and closing theme is not on each episode. I am still looking around to fone one more set that contains Japanese and English audio that dose work. and not the waste that Bandai USA made for the US market. I am too stupid to watch anime so sell the cartoon network cut up crap. due to 9/11 crap thing. Some heavy object falling on to earth is no way close to a three Jet plaines crashing in to these buildings.
What kind of Bandai CEO is running it? Bandai dose not double check on there work and dose not lissen to the consumers
Dont give a  S H I T and one like to take notes on my crappy DVD's from Bandai USA?",1251417600,,2598,4.007722007722008
8201523,5,B000RNLKN6,"It was wel worth the wait I had been looking for a collection of this seires since they started doing the anime legends, but never had any luck until now.",1229040000,,154,4.166666666666667
8201524,5,B000RNLKN6,Quite simply the only way to get all of the original Gundam (U.C. 0079) episodes in one collection at a cheap price. You get English dub and Japanese audio track. One of the best collections to own. Get it while it's available in a single collection.,1225324800,,250,4.456521739130435
8201525,5,B000RNLKN6,This is what started it all.  There is no way I could have given it less than five stars.  The one thing that threw me when I started to veiw it was I had to switch the language settings from Japanese to English.  That's all right though.  Anyway my opinion is you're not a true Gundam fan if you dislike the Original Series.,1207353600,2,325,4.111111111111111
8201526,4,B000RNLKN6,"You get all the episodes from the original gundam 0079 series. You get the intro ,and closing just once on each disc. Being the intro themes from the begining episode at the start ,and the last episode has the closing themes on each disk. But all the episodes are intact. The very last disk at the end it has some extras. Like some of the original marketing trailers of the show ,and the intro and the closing without credits. It has the english dub from the cartoon network done by vancouver, canada ocean group. Original Japanese audio as well with the english subtitles but the english substitles aren't done too well. Chinese subtitles are also included. I give this chinese bootleg four stars.

I got the zeta gundam complete series chinese bootleg the other day. Well all that it is missing is the 2nd half of the 7 th seventh episode after the commercial break. I felt a bit bad cause I missed the dramatic battle scene between Kamille and Lila. It just jumps to the next episode. It's the only minor issue. The rest of the other episodes are all intact. All having the intro and closings. But the intro and closing don't have the 80's j-pop original music. It has the same same new instrumental music from the bandai box set release a couple of years ago due to copyrights. The english dub is done by blue ocean group in calgary canada. There's the orginal japanese audio with english subtitles and chinese subtitles. No extras though. I give it a four. Would of been a 4 and a half if the whole 7th episode was included. But I can't ask for too much since they are cheap bootlegs. You can get these cheaper if you look on ebay. That's if you don't mind a cheap bootleg.",1196985600,4,1678,4.4480519480519485
8201527,3,B000RNLKN6,"If you're looking for a Mobile Suit Gundam box set, this is it.  Too bad it's a Chinese bootleg.  If you don't speak Japanese but, for some reason, still want to watch the show in Japanese, look elsewhere, the subtitles are atrocious and the video is muddy.  If you want to watch the show in English, you'll get nicer looking video, but with slightly odd transitions between episodes.  Of course, there are no special features, but the case is nice.

All in all, it's a good value, if you don't mind bootlegs.",1191110400,8,509,4.489130434782608
