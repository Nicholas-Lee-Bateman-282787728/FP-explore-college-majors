8433940,2,B002W650VY,"This video is difficult to understand.  When panning an area, the movement is jerky, the objects blur.  The person talking is obviously not American and uses words most Americans would not understand.  And some of the information in wrong.  My students found at least 2 pieces of totally wrong information in the video.  I cannot recommend it.  Sorry.",1363219200,,351,4.9655172413793105
