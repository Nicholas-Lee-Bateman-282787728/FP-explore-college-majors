8243471,3,B00120Y4XQ,"After being out of Paintball for 10 years I bought this box set to brush up on how to be an effective player. I found the DVDs to be redundant and packed with a bunch of filler but there were a few good tips.

Basically each video starts out with an introduction of the players.  Then Rich Telford gives a safety speech about using a barrel sock and wearing your goggles.

Each video then has a section that covers bunkering, how to position yourself in the bunker, common mistakes, etc.  This is the same across all 3 videos.

At some point in each video DJ Radar does a mix and its either a video of him mixing or his mix with video of a paintball game playing.

Each DVD (Front, Mid, Back) has a section dedicated to that position which is useful.  IE, what each position does and some tricks for playing that position.

Each video ends with a talk about the gear for each position (which made sense and was fairly useful) and then a discussion of standard equipment; again same across all three videos.

Realistically, you can watch the entire 1st DVD and then just watch the Specifics sections of the other 3 DVDs.  If you watch all three in a row you'll notice a lot of the same video footage and content.

My other feedback on these videos is that it was shot on the same field and didn't offer much in the way of alternate field setups, scenarios.  I think it would have added something to talk about bunker selection as it wasn't really covered.

Additionally, I would have liked to see some breakdowns of actual tournament/game play footage in terms of what was done right vs. done wrong.  It seemed like in the videos a lot of the situations were staged.",1281657600,,1665,4.398692810457517
