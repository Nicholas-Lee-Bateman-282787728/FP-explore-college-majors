8400094,5,B003M3A818,"OK, first you have to have to watch Tom Gun then Robin Hood with Kevin Costner. Because this movie combo picks on these two movies. In order to get some of the jokes, you need to see them. There are other, political satires or making fun of some of the famous commercials in the DVD as well. With all that said, this is a movie that you will be laughing from beginning to end, yes end. Please do read the end credits. Jokes are in there too. This is a must spoof/satire movie for your DVD library.",1292025600,2,497,4.134020618556701
