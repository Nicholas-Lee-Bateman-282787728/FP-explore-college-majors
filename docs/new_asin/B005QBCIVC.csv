8483060,3,B005QBCIVC,"Alan Ladd turned in a good performance in a story of three ex-GI's getting out of the military after WWII and two of them dealing with the problem of telling their young friend that he was dying and only had a few months to live.  The team agree to fly a plane to Saigon and find themselves involved with a smuggler.  Another fine pairing of Ladd and Veronica Lake, who appeared in 7 movies together (although in 3 they played themselves).  Nice romantic adventure to pass the time with.  Worth a watch.",1431648000,,503,4.434782608695652
8483061,4,B005QBCIVC,"This movie was made after Veronica Lake's high point. The character she plays is supposed to be tough, but she plays it bitter. This is four years after the fiasco The Hour Before Dawn that marked the downward spiral of her career. It shows in her portrayal and maybe that's why it's good. The story raises questions about trust and ulterior motive.",1421193600,,349,4.645161290322581
8483062,5,B005QBCIVC,What is not to like about Ladd in this role.  It was a piece of cake for him.,1410220800,,77,3.2777777777777777
8483063,4,B005QBCIVC,"The old chemistry between Lake and Ladd is there and it is a pleasure to see them together. But this one is not on the level of Glass Key, This Gun for Hire or The Blue Dhalia",1379462400,,175,3.7567567567567566
8483064,4,B005QBCIVC,"Lots of tension, sentiment, and a lovely developing love story. An Alan Ladd/Veronica Lake classic worth seeing. I had ordered this for an older friend, but enjoyed watching it myself.",1374796800,2,184,5.166666666666667
8483065,1,B005QBCIVC,"Alan ladd is one my favorites movis stars,the  quality of the movir is very poor,i do believe  also that it was record from  a tv chanel,either  way is LOUSY",1352764800,8,157,4.310344827586207
8483066,3,B005QBCIVC,"Veronica Lake continues to be  fascination for me.  This film (I'm greatful to even get ANY copy) was a terrible ransfer!  I suppose the film was as bad (chopped up, POOR quality of original film!).Too bad there isn't someone interested in Veronica's film and re-master
them...in particular ""I married a Witch""  etc.  She underated herself...as did others!  My opinion!!",1347321600,11,370,5.186440677966102
