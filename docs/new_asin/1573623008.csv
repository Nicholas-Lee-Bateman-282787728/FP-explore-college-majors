192236,4,1573623008,"Visually stunning, filled with beautiful colors, an Indian landscape that probably looks the same as it did in the 16th century setting of the film, Mira Nair shows us the differences between the castes. Two sets of couples'  lives become intertwined as friendships extend beyond the class differences  that ruled Indian society. Meanwhile, the cost of following the path of the  heart is paid by, you guessed it, the lower caste couple, in particular,  the female. Surprise. But all their lives are affected by the actions they  take. In a larger context, the contrast between the path of duty to family  and society's expectations versus following one's heart is filled with risk  and only the strongest are able to go against the tide of popular opinion.  And if that doesn't grab you, some of the most beautiful, tasteful erotic  moments I've ever experienced on celluloid. This one's to own, folks.",920160000,2,903,4.966666666666667
192237,5,1573623008,"I actually hadn't known what Kama Sutra was until after I rented the film.  So I had little to compare this with.  While most who are watching this movie for sex will be greatly disappointed, I thought this an excellent  film.  The Cinematography was very good... The music I must buy the  soundtrack very soon.  The music turned me into a fan of the film.  Actually the basic storyline (the love interest story line) echo's a little  of the storyline within Titanic.  While I won't give away the ending of  this storyline.. That's what occured to me a couple of hours after watching  it..",917913600,,589,4.5673076923076925
192238,4,1573623008,"A poignant love story. If it was longer, allowing for even deeper character development, it would have been a 5 star film. This story would have been fantastic as a mini-series.",1506211200,,177,4.741935483870968

192240,5,1573623008,"I say that the sex/love link remains unclear, and that love is the primary driving force in this story. At the same time, the film shows the tenderness that ignites and fuels deep passion via the Kama Sutra. This is the first time I have seen the film without commercials, and the first time I ""got it."" Convention and custom are turned upside down, sometimes unwittingly, and there is a price to pay. In the film, custom and convention have been considered ""natural"" for so long, the characters cannot but suffer. But where is the crime? Is it from flaunting convention, or is it from having elevated convention to an improper and ultimately deadly position in the first place? As I say, this is hardly a ""sex"" story, because there is so much more to ponder.",1506124800,,759,4.588235294117647

192243,5,1573623008,"Visually stunning, incredible cast of characters, examines the dual nature of the Virgin/Sacred Prostitute, the double nature of abundance versus poverty, and what it truly means to be a divine fem/masculine or Queen/King.  This movie has hidden depths, the more you watch, the more it unfurls itself.  Totally underrated.",1504224000,,322,5.551020408163265

192296,4,1573623008,"This is a really low quality DVD. It doesn't provide subtitle options for English (French and Spanish only, which luckily I speak), which didn't help because the sound quality wasn't good either. With that said, I give this DVD copy  Now, the movie is lovely. I don't want to describe the film and distort anyone's expectations, but think of unrequited love, caste system inequality, ancient royalty, lust, dishonor, jealousy, deep lovemaking. If you like movies with a historical, ancient storyline, this is a must watch. Now some reviews mention that the film is historically inaccurate for the period. Can we not work with what we have? We can enjoy each individual character, and their reality, their emotions. I can give you a list of 100+ films that are ""not an Oscar worthy masterpiece,"" yet provide essence that viewers can deeply relate to, whether they are fiction, historically accurate, based on true events, etc. The movie I say is 3-4 stars.",1451088000,,955,4.96875

192299,3,1573623008,"This movie was not of the best quality nor does it have good quality actors. However, the reason that I give it three stars is because it tells the story of how Kama Sutra became the best in sex education. This is a movie and not a documentary, but it gives the viewers of how Kama Sutra was taught for years in India, and these techniques were taught to them at a young age. However, I would recommend that you watch this movie with the one you love to get a great enjoyment from the movie.",1448150400,,491,4.125

192341,5,1573623008,"If you like exotic movies and music this is a ""MUST SEE"". I bought this film back in the VHS days but decided recently to get it again on a DVD because I intend to watch it many more times in the future. The story is captivating and the actors make you forget they're just acting-----plus the men are handsome (I'm just saying) and the women are gorgeous---like only bejeweled, sari-wearing women can be.
  I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who decides to buy it so I'll just say it's a complicated tale about jealousy wrapped around a love triangle between a king, his concubine and the man she  truly loves.
  AS for the music, I also bought the CD back when I bought my VHS copy of the movie because it can stand alone it's so good. I'm sure everyone is familiar with sitars and chanting, but this is done on a big-time movie level.",1425427200,2,844,4.283018867924528

The most important thing to remember about this movie is that is comes from a different culture. Many people from the West don't know about castes, and why some people can or can't do something they'd like to do. Maya, the main character, is the servant of Tara, her best friend. Maya must wear Tara's old clothes and is always made to feel inferior, because she is from a lower caste. This isn't going to be some simple love or sex movie; it is deeply intelligent, romantic, and powerful. By far one of the best I have ever seen, or will see.",1414972800,,719,4.255474452554744

192388,5,1573623008,"With regards to the movie, it's masterfully done. Given the subject matter, I'm sure that many will expect it to be salacious and somewhat pornographic - but, that is really not the case. It is extremely erotic in appropriate moments, but the story itself much broader and complex. In addition to this, the soundtrack, the cinematography, the sets... everything is just perfect. I also have to say that the acting is sublime. The principle players each add their own uniqueness to their roles, and carry them out flawlessly.

However... If you are thinking of getting this, definitely get the DVD and NOT the Blu-ray. Although the DVD is of lower resolution, the Blu-ray is plagued with a host of transfer problems. It appears to have been transferred directly from film and contains all of the dust, artifacts, and soundtrack hiss that one would expect from a back-alley boot-leg shop. Additionally, it has been censored for content in a rather clumsy way - scenes tend to ""jump"" unexpectedly where something has been edited out. So, the choice is (a) less colour and resolution in an otherwise excellent transfer - the DVD - or (b) an edited, extremely poor transfer in HD - the Blu-ray. Again, I suggest the DVD.",1406592000,4,1215,4.841346153846154

192498,4,1573623008,"So, I'm going to tell you about the Blu-Ray version that I just bought:

The picture quality, although not extremely fabulous, but is greatly improved. I don't think it is mastered from the original master film. When it starts, the screen is very spotty and crackly. You know, like the sound of bacon frying. But, it does fade to a minimum very quickly, and just little white spots pop up throughout the film.

But, the sound quality is the real disappointment here. When people speak, it is very hissy. Everybody sounds like they have a lisp when they speak. But, again, that starts to minimize as you get deeper into the film.  And, what everyone will find extremely disappointing about the Indian released Blu-Ray, is that about 3 minutes of the film has been removed.

Yes, that's right!  You've guess it!  The nudity has all been removed.

India sure has a warped sense of values.  They don't mind showing bloodshed, police brutality and disrespectful behavior of one another, but when it comes to showing the beauty of God's creation (the naked female body), they censor it and remove it from the appreciative viewer's eye. India's got serious morality problems.  No wonder Indians that came to America from India raise their middle finger and wave it at their native country.

Anyway, I'll keep both this DVD and the Blu-Ray disc because, in the long run, I do prefer a better picture, especially with a visually artful film such as this.

You'll notice that the Blu-Ray disc isn't readily available in stores, or even sold by Amazon itself. It does have the Indian film certificate printed on the back, so I guess the Blu-Ray disc was made from a source film or tape that came out of India. It's not uncommon to see pirated movies coming out of India, especially Bollywood films themselves. They may even be made here in the US, and are sold in Indian stores. That just might be the case here.",1321747200,3,1901,4.678678678678678

192522,4,1573623008,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first sat down to watch this movie.  That it was set in pre-colonial India made it appealing as I figured there would not be a cultural battle between east and west in it.  This is true and the story developed well as a result.  The story follows, roughly, the lives of two girls as they grow to adulthood, each with her own ambition.  The story is somewhat disjointed as the stories are not intertwined as much as perhaps they should have been, but the overall effect is still a good movie to watch.

We do not get much insight into Indian society other than the king was the ultimate ruler who could determine life and death.  While women were subserviant to men, common in many eastern traditions, they still held more power than one might imagine.  The Kama Sutra gave women knowledge in dealing with men on both a physical and emotional level.  While men can be far more physical than women, it is the emotional part of life that gives it all depth and meaning.

We follow the story primarily of one of the girls, Maya, a beauty who has captivated the king but has sacrificed her own virtue through a moment of youthful indiscretion.  She cannot be queen but only a favorite courtisan.  She eventually falls in love with a commoner, a sculptor by trade, but he rejects her primarily because of his own selfish vanity.  Eventually the sculptor angers the king and all of Maya's pleadings will not spare his life.  The king has troubles of his own, and we can only assume that his lack of interest in actual governmental affairs has allowed his rivals to conquer his lands

This movie moves at a good pace, but it can be erratic at times as it bouces around and reintroduces characters the viewer has all but forgotten about.  It has enough sensuality to make it appealing to many and the ultimate tragic end leaves the viewer wondering if Maya will even really find satisfaction in her life.",1299283200,6,1931,4.508620689655173
192523,5,1573623008,"I first saw this movie in an ashram in Bali during a spiritual movie night.  If you don't look for deeper meanings, then the movie may appear to be just a porn flick set against an exotic backdrop.  But there are deeper levels:  it's about a woman who grows from her years of innocence as a girl into an adult who has learned certain tough lessons in her life - about greed, pride, Love, betrayal, injustice, jealousy and forgiveness - but does not close down, does not become bitter, revengeful or sad or withdrawn from the world.  Instead, she acknowledges what she has learned and keeps her heart open to Life and whatever may occur next.

Yes there was a lot of Yummy sex, but there is a very deep storyline here. I have watched it several times, and enjoyed every minute of it. The actors and actresses are really what makes this movie, as usual in film the men show very little and the women are highly exposed. If you are looking for an intense story pick this one. I highly recommend it to those who can handle a sometimes cryptic script, and delicious sex.",1282953600,3,551,4.52
192528,2,1573623008,"If you're looking for something resembling soft porn- you've found it here.  It's not a horrible movie, but it's not great either. Though the lead actress is hot- she can't act, so in the end it just looks like some horny producers wanted to see boobies & didn't care as much about the end product of their film. Seems when given the choice between acquiring a talented actress and getting some no-talent woman who'd be willing to have her nipples sucked by a stranger on camera, they decided on the latter. I liked the music & also there are poignant scenes showing rape followed by arranged marriage and even pedophilia in the selling of pre-pubescant girls. Though a couple of the actors did well amongst a sea of bad, the script offered them a poor foundation & it gets more & more soap-opera as it goes along. If the movie suddenly stopped playing 3/4th of the way through I wouldn't have cared much- which is a sign of it's ability to grab the audience right there. As far as the controversial scenes go: we see an actor clearly sucking on the actress's nipples, licking, biting and grabbing very private parts.- Not just portraying this, but actually DOING it on screen. I'm in no way a religious nut, but I believe that (aside from porn) such intimate things should remain private rather than between an entire audience and film crew. Not because it is ""wrong"" or ""dirty"", but rather because:

a) It does nothing to advance the story or plot in any way.
b) It takes the audience out of being immersed in the movie for a moment as they suddenly get whacked with the thought- Oh my god- what are these actors doing? And therefore doesn't serve the art of the film.
c) If done too often It can take away from the specialness and enticement of the act desensitizing an audience to lesser acts on screen which may actually be more meaningful.

Nudity is fine if it advances a story or makes a statement, but here it does none of that. The men show no real nudity at any time- It's only the women. You could argue that this makes a statement about women being made vulnerable and subserviant in a patriarichal society, but there was definitely no statement in the intimate moments that crossed the line and the characters desperately lacked depth. The creators of this film failed at fully realizing the politics they tried to bring up. (And it was all brought up rather sloppily if I might add) I almost want to give this an extra star because I enjoyed watching the nice colors the film uses & the music, but I figure in a review it's best to speak about the story, the acting & the script which was all sub-par and it seems the top critics agreed with my sentiments.",1280707200,4,2671,4.491769547325103

192537,5,1573623008,"Released in '97 the exotic, sensual and visually alluring `Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love' is an intoxicating story detailing the intense, complex intermingling sensations of romance, sexual attraction and obsession as played out in a royal family in 16th century India.

While I was remotely familiar with the contents of the classic Indian sex manual of the same name I began my viewing of the fillm `Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love' with no expectations as to how explicit this production might be. For all I knew it may have turned out to be nothing more than soft core porn of an exotic nature.  Fortunately what unfolded was indeed a pleasant surprise. The Indian landscape, architecture and costumes, the mesmerizing soundtrack and the captivating storyline are everything an audience could ask for. While you may not recognize the names of any of the cast, possibly with the exception of Naveem Andrews, the acting is excellent.

WARNING THERE MAY BE SPOILERS

It takes place in the 16th century India.  It's a tale about two girls.  They've been best friends for life.  Tara (Sarita Choudhury) is a princess, Maya (Indira Varma)is a servent girl.  But things turn sour years later, when the women are grown up.  On Tara's wedding night, Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews)is seduced by Maya's good looks, even though my dad thought Tara was better looking then Maya, and Tara, who is jealous of this, spits in Maya's face.  As a plan of revenge, Maya takes the bride's groom to bed with her.  Oh it gets much better, not!  Maya then confesses to Tara that she did it with Raj on the wedding night.  Tara who is devistaded, kicks Maya out of the palace.  Someone who is even more devistaded is Tara's perverted hunchback brother, he has an infatuation with Maya, yuck!

Anyways, Maya is out in the real world now, and she wants to understand the fine arts of seduction, so she finds this school, with the teacher named Rasa Devi (Rekha)  Rasa teaches Maya the fine arts of seduction with the book Kama Sutra, suprise, suprise.  Well Maya also finds a love interest too, he is called Jai Kumar (Ramon Tikaram).  But at the time, he's only interested in scupluring her, oh yah he's a stone sculptor.  Then out of nowhere, the Raj shows up and wants Jai to sculp the woman he lusts for, that would be Maya.  So they both go to the palace with him, and he even challenges Jai to a friendly male-bonding wrestling match, but just how friendly are we talking here?

Well now Maya is the top concubine for Raj.  Tara is insainly jealous, and she can't believe that she's married to a opium smoking playboy who lusts after Maya.  Maya even tries to rekindel her lost friendship with Tara, and at one time even helps her seduce her husband.  But that doesn't happen until the near end though.  But Jai is finally realising that he's in love with Maya, but it's kind of too late, because Maya is the top concubine of Raj.  And when Raj finds out that Maya is still in love with Jai, he plots his horrible revenge.  And perhaps it's Maya's presence in everyone's lives that leads to their destrution and the destruction of the monarcy.

Low-caste Maya adds training to beauty in becoming a courtesan, with men her life for her pleasure as well as men in her life for their own pleasure. High-born Maya's looks seduce a king into marrying her. The years in front of each one promise happiness, even a chance at love.

Their own jealousies, combined with jealousies around them, break that promise. Maya resents Tara's wealth, Tara envies Maya's grace and allure, and so on until utter collapse. In the end, only Maya seems to escape unharmed - she starts life with nearly nothing, and in the end walks into exile with neary nothing, just the clothes on her back. But, in between, she gains a wealth of knowledge and memory that can never be taken away.

Intimate encounters vary, as they do in real life. The finest are warm, gentle, enticing expressions physical love, with real feeling enhanced by training in the skills of love. The worst come from a terrible mismatch of wedding-night expectations: Maya's virginal fear against his animal urges and belief in a skilled seductress, a failure that contaminates their feelings forever.

The story of loves gained, lost, and stillborn will appeal to some viewers. For me, the simple beauty of the actors and the scenes around them is enough.

192587,5,1573623008,"This is a lushly lavish, sensuously beautiful film, superlatively directed by Mira Nair, a world class director noted for such other cinematic masterpieces as ""Salaam Bombay"", ""Mississippi Masala"", and the more recent art house feature, ""Monsoon Wedding"". As are her other films, ""Kama Sutra"" is an intelligent and mesmerizing story, peppered with excellent performances by a stellar cast.

Set in sixteenth century India, this is the story of Maya (Indira Varma), a servant girl and companion to Tara (Sarita Choudry), a Maharani destined to be Queen to a Raj. Childhood friends, they are to become palace rivals as the fates pit them one against the other, only to have them both become casualties of love. Maya, tired of being treated as a second class citizen and of receiving Tara's castoff clothing, makes a life defining decision on the eve of Tara's marriage to Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews). Sensing that the Raj desires her, Maya gives herself to him, later telling Tara that it is she who now has a cast off from Maya.

After Tara departs with her husband, Maya's perfidy is revealed to the household by Tara's hunchbacked brother, who, coveting Maya for himself, had spied upon her and saw her in flagrante delicto with the Raj. Ousted by Tara's outraged family, Maya leaves to make her way in the world. She comes across a sculptor, Jai Kumar (Ramon Tikarum), of Raj Singh's royal household and falls in love with him. Unfortunately, timing is everything. By the time Jai realizes that he, too, is in love with her, it is too late, as Maya is now the favorite courtesan of the by now debauched Raj, who is obsessed with her and cannot seem to get her out of his system, much to the dismay of Tara, as well as Jai.

Trained in the arts of love by the graceful and beautiful Rasa Devi (Rekha), Maya, as a royal courtesan, is a sensuous, beautiful sylph. Tara, now the Queen, is insanely jealous of her husband's desire for Maya, but must tolerate it, as must Jai, as it is a culturally accepted way of life. Unfortunately, when the Raj discovers that Maya and Jai are still in love, all hell breaks loose, and the piper must be paid.

This is a wonderful film of a woman's journey to find herself within culturally imposed constraints. It is a tale of the vicissitudes of life that leave imprints on one's journey. Told in the context of carnal love and desire, it also tells of a love sublime. This is essentially a woman's film, sensuous and erotic in its imagery, a veritable sumptuous feast for the senses. While there is some nudity in the film, it is tastefully and beautifully filmed, as well as highly erotic.

Indira Varma, in what is her screen debut, is sensational as the entrancing Maya, imbuing her with an impishness, as well as with a sinuous and provocative sensuality. Sarita Choudry, of ""Mississippi Masala"" fame, is excellent as the beautiful and exotic Tara, who appears to be relegated to a life of frigidity and jealousy. Rekha, the well known and exquisitely beautiful Indian actress, is hypnotic as Rasa Devi, teacher of the Kama Sutra. Naveen Andrews gives a good performance as the debauched Raj, and Ramon Tikarum is compelling as the conflicted artist. They both, however, take a backseat to the women in the film.

192611,5,1573623008,"Maya, a young woman of a lower social standing finds friendship and companionship with her much wealthier but much dissolusioned friend Tara. When the two become of marrying age, Maya is essentially thrown to the kings brother (think Kwazimoto) as a consolation prize, while Tara is bargained away in an arranged marriage to the King, Raj Singh, who is a man who appreciates only the beautiful things in life. So much so that even on his first viewing of Tara in all her finery, he sees only Maya, the ""lowly servant girl."" Tara becomes incensed and sends her off.

Maya may be treated as a servant girl, but she is not subservient to anyone including Tara. So the night before Tara and the King are to marry, she loses her virginity to him. Of course, someone sees this, ""Kwazimoto"", who upset that he cannot have Maya for himself, runs to tell his mother who immediately has Maya thrown out for being a whore.

Well, what's a ""whore"" to do, but become one. Maya goes out and decides that she will innact a further revenge and become a courteasan to the King, a fact that she holds over Tara's head.

Drama ensues, Maya ends up falling for a handsome sculpture artist, but cannot abandon her ""duties."" Meanwhile Tara begins to lose her sanity waiting on the king who never loved her in the first place, to love her.

I thought that this film was aesthetically perfect. The backdrop is rich in its color palette, and you really get a sense of the grandeur of palace life. The actors did a wonderful job of portraying the love/hate relationships between each other. Through Maya's character, we are allowed to see that the only one who controls her, is herself. She loves indiscriminately, and it not afraid to go after what she wants despite the consequences.

192612,2,1573623008,"I believe that I would like to place a moment of blame on this film.  Due to the title alone, I was nervous about viewing it with the windows open.  Prior to my viewing, I was unaware that it was directed by famed director Mira Nair, and was fully prepared to draw my blinds as I embarked on this film adventure.  The title was Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, what was I to assume.  After watching nearly two hours of this film, I was disappointed.  I was upset with not only the lack of commitment to the characters, the tired storyline, and the anti-climactic ending, but also due to the lack of sexuality surrounding this film.  ""Kama Sutra"" headlines this feature, but alas, it is not the central focus, and this is where I believe Nair failed us and my moment of blame was born.  I would like to make it clear that I did not desire a film of pornography, I knew that this was a ""mainstream"" film, but I did want something deeper and centered around the art of ""Kama Sutra"" instead of just another clich? story of rival girlfriends.  I realize that I am generalizing the overall theme of this film, but at the core of this movie it was not about the art of sex, but instead the decay of man.

I did not like this film.  For several reasons, I felt that Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love was bland, void of emotion, and unoriginal.  I understood this film to be considered an adult fairy tale, but alas, I never saw the elements of a fairy tale in this story.  Written in part by Nair, I saw this film as her opportunity to demonstrate the power of a woman's sexuality over even the strongest of men.  In a very small part she succeeded, but her attempt to build this opportunity failed with her characters.  When you make a film centered on love, or the passion of its act, you must hire actors that will give the audience that sensation.  The audience must feel the sweat, the energy, the excitement of what is happening on screen or it will fall swiftly into just another Skin-a-Max midnight movie.  Sadly, Nair could not accomplish this.  When her characters, whether it was Maya, Tara, Raj, or even Jai, were ""forced"" into the ""Kama Sutra"" part of the film, it felt scripted and staged.  There was no instant passion between these characters, which destroyed, utterly ripped from its roots, any attempt that Nair had to create the theme of sexual independence.  Without the fire behind her actor's eyes, the rest of the film fell to the wayside as just your ""average"" film.

Nair had another opportunity to capture back her audience with this film, but she never took it.  Nair could have pulled a Gandhi-esque moment for us by countering the horrible acting with beautiful images of India.  Nair could have coupled the beauty of ""Kama Sutra"" with the beauty of the land, thus creating at least one moment of visual eye-candy for the viewers, but again, she did no such thing.  The few moment of fresh scenery that we had seemed like it came from National Geographic stock footage.  I realize that she was actually in India, but what concerned me was that I didn't feel like I was in India.  Throughout the film I realized that I was sitting on my couch watching bad acting with recycled images of India.  I was nowhere close to being swept away by a lavish love story.  Wait.  This wasn't an original lavish love story.  This was nothing more than the clich? story of two friends whom find themselves fighting over the same man with a foreign twist.  Perhaps I needed more influx into India's culture or even more back-story on our smaller characters, but nothing took my breath away.  The character's lack of passion cheated me, and now Nair's choice of scenery felt just as plastic.

Finally, I would like to say that (without giving anything away); the ending was rather lackluster.  Void of emotion to our characters and obvious clich? India images only strengthened the forgettable ending.  Again, the title of this film was Kama Sutra, which invokes images of lust and passion, sadly the ending evoked nothing of the sort.  There wasn't a care in the world for our characters, so why should we feel impassioned about them in the final climactic moments?  I didn't.  As I watched this film I felt as if I was on a Disney ride through India.  The tracks were in place so my cart couldn't go off the forsaken path, while the robotic characters did what they were supposed to do without any surprises or excitement.  The only character (and I hate to go back on this rant again, but it is the central reason this film fell hard) worth enjoying was that of Naveen Andrews, but I think it is because of his Lost connection.  By the time the ending finally happened, I was sculpting my own story in rock and hoping that Hollywood would produce it.

Overall, this film did have potential, but by giving it a name like Kama Sutra it over promised and ultimately did not deliver.  Again, I would like to make it clear that I was not hoping for a heavily sexual film, but it needed to be a stronger point in the story than just a ""quick-cut"" or a side quest.  Kama Sutra failed because of its characters and their obvious lack of devotion to the story.  There were no surprises, there was no excitement, and there was no romance, just clich? plot points that you can see in any film across the fine Earth.  Could Nair been more adventurous?  This reviewer thinks so.  She could have taken us off the beaten path, deeper within the darkness, but instead she glossed over the truth giving us a Kama Sutra that was more pastel than passionate.  As you walk by this film in the future, do not be fooled by the title, the contents of the box do not match the visuals it promises!

192615,1,1573623008,"What amazes me most about ""Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love,"" is that it is an Indian movie set in the 16th century that has nothing to do with the real India of that time period. Its director Mira Nair is a member of India's elitist, English-educated intelligentsia, who as a matter of fact is trained like them to regard pre-colonial Indian culture with contempt and scorn. In this film, she decided to paint a fictional picture of a medieval India based on one 6th century Indian text on relationships. From this one source, she justifies her portrayal of an ""exotic"" India with promiscuous women and debauchee kings, apparently with the goal of making money from an uninformed, international audience who want to see sex on the big screen and leave feeling that they've seen a fine film. Somewhere in this story is a plot about alleged double standards in gender relations, sexual mores, and the whole bit vis-a-vis traditional Indian culture, apparently to reinforce the feeling that Kama Sutra is a intelligent, cultural criticism instead of dull, soft pornography.

It would have been nicer if Nair had had the ethics to try and represent the Indian setting more faithfully, rather than weaving a false tapestry of so-called Indian civilization to serve as the background for what is essentially a money-making, sex movie. It is bad enough that the characters are bland and that their actions make absolutely no sense. What is truly shameful is the way in which customs and attitudes are invented by the writers and implicitly passed off as ""Indian."" For example, there is NO such thing as a ""dance of enticement,"" as Indian dance in general has a spiritual, devotional basis. Of course, Nair would have none of that since movies about Indians worshipping God through dance don't sell. Similarly, Hindu kings did NOT smoke hookas (that was a Muslim custom), which makes it harder to swallow the idea of the drug-addict, debauchee king. The prayers chanted in the Hindu wedding are NOT actual Vedic prayers, but rather poetic verses taken from a devotional composition that was written 100 years after the time period in which this movie was set! Hindu queens did NOT encourage their sons to maintain courtesans and engage in womanizing. Nor could kings become debauched without losing the respect of their ministers and subjects. Sex was NOT seen as casual fun in traditional Hindu society, but rather as an allowance for procreation by married couples. The list goes on and on....

There may be some who might think they know better, wanting to cling to their fantasy of a sexually-liberated India. All I can say to these sadly misinformed people is that I've actually lived in rural India (unlike people of Nair's ilk), and as a scholar of Indian literature I know what I'm talking about. You cannot claim that the India of Vatsyayana's Kama Sutra was the real India when you ignore the bulk of other Sanskrit literature (Mahabharata, Ramayana, Puranas, etc) which tell a very different story.

Nair lacks the honesty to represent Indian culture as it is, because she is too busy trying to weave a story about sexual double standards interwoven with tantalizing sex which ultimately fails to be anything one could be proud of. But then again, truthfulness isn't really the priority; showing nude Indian women as sex objects is. Congratulations Ms Nair for turning back the clock on intercultural understanding and respect for women. I'm sure you've made a lot of money. I just don't know how you can look at yourself in the mirror.",1136419200,34,3534,4.896494156928214

This film is thinly based on Vatsayana's ""Kama Sutra,"" which translates into A book of love or a treatise on pleasure. Other than that the film has no reference to the book at all.

192620,4,1573623008,"""Kama Sutra"" is a a beautiful, sensuous film directed by ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""Vanity Fair"" director Mira Nair. The story revolves around Maya (Indira Varma). Maya grows up in a lower caste unlike her best friend Tara (Sarita Chodhury) who is born into a wealthy, privileged family. After being humilated in public by Tara, Maya takes it upon herself by seducing her soon-to-be ex-bestfriend's future husband Raj (Naveen Andrews) on the night of the wedding. When Tara's brother catches the couple in their tent together, he exposes all which leads to Maya going into exile.

Maya meets up with an artist Jai Kumar (Ramon Tikarum). He later introduces her to Rasa Devi (Rekha) who teaches the philosophies of the kama sutra to a group of young women. When Jai initially pushes Maya away when she declares that she is in love with him, Maya turns to Raj and becomes his royal courtesan. This makes Raj's wife and Maya's former best friend Tara insanely jealous and insecure.

I enjoyed this film. I loved the lush scenery and the beautiful costumes. I thought the love scenes were done tastefully and without being explicit for the sake of being explicit. While there wasn't really much of a plot, I still thought the writing was entertaining. One of my favorite scenes was when Maya went with Jai to a brothel dressed up as a man.

After seeing the stunning Indira Varma in ""Bride and Prejudice"" earlier this year, I have been curious about her film work. I think it is funny that she and Naveen Andrews would later work together in that film after ""Kama Sutra"". It was real interesting how their relationship in ""Kama Sutra"" differed (greatly) from their characters' relationship in ""Bride and Prejudice"".

My only issue with the film is the way that it ended. I do not care for films that leave on an open note. I feel so unsatisfied when films end without any closure but that is probably what Mira Nair wanted. All in all, I liked ""Kama Sutra"". The entire cast was great. They all put in excellent performances. It wasn't too long, nor was it too short.",1120089600,6,2058,4.692520775623269

Instead, I was expecting the story to be interwoven with the philosophies behind the original Kama Sutra and the ways these are used by the characters in their relationships. This is strongly hinted at in the trailers and preview for the film, in which Maya says that if she cannot use the Kama Sutra ""on the one she loves, she will use it on the one she hates.""  The film actually reveals very little about the Kama Sutra, despite promises scattered throughout the film.  This in itself was a big dissapointment.  The film is very erotic and sensual, however, sure to offend some viewers.  But what keeps the film from being excellent are two things.  First, much of it is painfully obvious though it's trying for subtle, and second, the central conflict (Maya vs. Tara) is never fully explored. A longer film could have given ample time to exploring their conflict as well as developing the two girls' individual stories.  It still gets 3 stars however for being absolutely visually sumptuous and conveying enough emotion to the viewer to be affective and, perhaps, remembered.",1108857600,9,1218,4.7990430622009566

192623,4,1573623008,"Hotter than ""Fire"", but without the same depth of emotion and not much of a story line, Kama Sutra comes over as a beautiful art movie, with magnificent scenery, brilliant color, and maximum use of nature, light and texture.  Yes, there are also love scenes that are not for the prudish, and some full frontal female nudity and bare backsides, but in essence it is a story of love and loss and debauchery and death.

Indira Varma is captivating as the servant girl Maya, portraying her as young, flirtatious and resilient, while at the same time, regal and vulnerable.  Her lovely eyes speak volumes, and there are entire scenes that are conveyed without the need for dialogue.

Sarita Choudhury plays a major supporting role as Tara, the intended bride of Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews). Although a lifelong friend of Maya, she turns on her in a fit of jealousy when the Raj lets his gaze wander to Maya on their very first meeting, and her reaction causes Maya to flee the room in shame.

Seeking revenge, Maya makes a pre-marital visit to the Raj, and gives herself to him in a performance that he never forgets.

She however forgets that people who live in transparent tents shouldn't fool around, and when the night's events are disclosed by Tara's humpbacked peeping tom of a brother, whom Maya has rejected outright as a husband, she has no choice but to leave her home as a fallen woman.

Unlike the popular advertisement however, she is able to get up, and thanks to the artistic skill of a stone carver Jai Kumar (Ramon Tikaram) and the friendship and teaching of Rasa Devi, (Screen legend Rehka) teacher of the Kama Sutra, she finds new confidence and a whole new attitude.  She falls for Jai big time, but unfortunately for him, he doesn't react well to unconditional love and chases her straight into the open arms of Raj Singh as his #1 favorite courtesan.

Tara is now living the life of the neglected wife of a debauched husband, and has a disastrous wedding night when he calls her another woman's name.  Her unhappiness is aggravated when she discovers Maya lolling off in a hot tub at the palace, and unable to cope with her situation decides on a drastic course of action.

Raj is by now totally obsessed with Maya, and when he discovers that his stone carver friend and his number one girl have not only rekindled the flames, but are busy fanning them when he's not around, he goes berserk, and orders the appropriate punishment for Jai.

To close things off, while Raj has been partying, his kingdom has been falling, and you don't need a fat lady singing to tell you that it's over for him.

Excellent performances by Indira Varma, Sarita Choudhury and Rekha make this movie worthwhile, and the attention to detail by Mira Nair makes for beautiful watching.

The story is about a girl who is poor but friends with a rich girl and her struggle to find love and lead a normal life.

Though many references are made to the Kama Sutra, the producers should have probably stuck with the title Tara and Maya or at least Maya since that is who the movie is really about. The book is just a side note to the deeper issues that she faces to not be treated as a servant.

There is some sex in this movie, but not much more than what you will see in your typical R rated movie today. The cinematography is great as well as the use of nature lighting.

The movie actually centers around the character Maya (not played by Sarita Choudhury) who grows up as a servant and playmate of Tara (who is played by Sarita Choudhury).  Both are somewhat jealous of the other - Maya because she gets Tara's hand me downs and is indeed treated like the servant she is - and Tara because Maya is more beautiful and accomplished than she is.  On the night of Tara's wedding to a Raj, Maya slaps Tara during an argument, who gets revenge by sleeping with Maya's husband to be.  Needless to say, Maya is driven from the house in shame.  Forced into difficult circumstances she becomes the courtesan of Maya's new husband, and takes every opportunity to rub this fact in Maya's face.

What is most surprising is that it does have a message; one might say that despite being set in 16th century India, it is a modern morality play told more than a little tongue-in-cheek.
Maya, born into a servant caste, and thereby relegated to a powerless situation in a rigid society, manages with daring, intelligence, and humor to live an authentic life. She acts boldly, at times, to shape her destiny; but she also accepts with equanimity the turns of fate that she cannot control. I think I can say without giving away anything that I love the final scene where, on the metaphorical path of life, she walks  serenely out of the chaos and madness created by powerful men into the peace of her own future.

The object of his desire is Maya, who is forced to become courtesan, after some unfortunate events. But, Maya was brought up as a princess...
Indeed, Maya grew up with the evil Prince's future wife-to-be, Tara, so it gets very complicated: Prince has beautiful Tara, but he desires beautiful Maya (they are both so beautiful, why not have them both?...Prince manages to do that for quite some time).
There is another amazingly beautiful woman in this film, whom I enjoyed seeing on screen once again: famous Indian actress, Rasa Devi, playing Rekha-- older courtesan and Maya's mentor, and what a wonderful mentor she is!
In short, Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, is one of the most beautiful and most sensuous films in years. It is entertaining and at the same time philosophical!

192650,2,1573623008,"For one thing, it puzzles me how this westernized view of India -- plush with its dusky women courtesans and its white bread social beliefs -- is associated with ""Kama Sutra"". A perfectly guessable tale of unrequited love, scorn, and revenge thereof, is packaged with frequent bits of unnecessary sex (call it audience targeting).
But even if I were to detach myself from exploring the Indianness in this film (the lack thereof, I mean) or its non-chalant labeling as Kama Sutra, in and of itself the movie is still quite an ordinary one.
The theme, as simpleton as they come -- Maya (a conveniently dark-skinned Indira Verma much in keeping with a western stereotype of Indian nymphs) is reviled by her Prince husband and socially ostracized. She takes refuge under the aegis of an exotic dancer (played convincingly by a superbly controlled Rekha, the only respite amidst all this facade). This dance teacher supposedly coaches our modest protagonist in all the requisite moves and emotional shenanigans involved in inveigling a man.
Lots of visual eye candy lines this bagatelle (not as much soft porn as some XY-chromosomes among you may wish for), some good costume designs, and an occasionally entertaining soundtrack. Nothing more.
From a veteran of Mira Nair's cadre, one would perhaps expect more than that -- maybe even a complex story of sexual intrigue and character study. Instead, looks like she fancied unshackling some international mental barriers about eroticism in the oh-so-orthodox Indian society, which ends up being little more than a farce to real Indians. (A trend that she seems to have continued with Monsoon Wedding)
Come to think of it, the whole plot reeks heavily of another movie, ""Dangerous Beauty"", which btw is a must-watch, where a Venetian courtesan tackles a similar fate. At least you may run into some honestly intelligent dialogue there.",1064620800,28,1878,5.10064935064935

Full Review
Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot.
I've always loved and enjoyed learning about Indian culture. I first saw this movie on HBO and only caught part of it. The next time it came on I made sure NOBODY interrupted me. I was so impressed and moved by this movie that I knew I had to have it on tape.
I don't think I could say enough about the setting it was absolutely breathtaking. What I also enjoyed where the stark contrasts of society. You see the rich in their kingdoms as well s the poor and their living conditions. Then there are the middle class who either work for the king or have some kind of trade of their own.
This story is about two young girls one a princess the other a servant girl,who come from different backgrounds yet are the best of friends. Until the night of the princess's wedding. Because of her actions the servant girl is banned from the kingdom forced to live upon her own. She is determined to make her own destiny in life instead of having it made FOR HER.
I really admired this woman's hopes and her attitude. She was not going to be ruled by any man. Not even the king but only by the man she loved. She knew how to use her body to get what she wanted yet still kept her pride intact. She wasn't what I would call the norm as far as a concubine would be or act. Yet even at the end when I thought she would truly break down, she becomes even stronger and walks out on the luxery she knew and finds herself a new path to walk in life.
Like I said I enjoyed this movie so much I bought it on VHS and just a couple of months ago I just found it on DVD. So now I have the movie in BOTH formats. Of course I enjoy the DVD version better, you get background info on the actors in the movie. As well as a little history lesson on the kama sutra, and other interesting facts on India.

192655,3,1573623008,"Directed by Mira Nair, the talented force behind the recent Monsoon Wedding, Kama Sutra is an earlier take of her beautiful vision of India.  Ms. Nair has a flair for showing her native country with all its loveliness unfurled, entrancing people of all ilk with its endless vistas and melting sunsets.  How can we resist her India, with its beguiling glimpses of beautiful women and passionate men as sculpted as the statues that adorn the Hindu temples (often used as incidental scenery).  The colors in each frame, from the glinting edges of whirling saris to the flower petals that flow over the steps of the royal residence like a red river, are enchantingly brilliant.  They draw the viewer into this Technicolor world without hesitation.  With all this beautiful scenery, one wonders why Ms. Nair even bothers to have a plot.  Unfortunately, once one is done watching this movie, the question remains unanswered.
  Many people will rent this movie for its title, known for the famous book of sexual positions so widely read by college dorm-goers.  But if one is looking for a more visual reenactment of this lovely text, be prepared to be dispassionate.  Though the movie is superficially about the life of a courtesan, its sex scenes are carefully choreographed to prohibit any real sensuality from coming out.  Though the participants are beautiful, the end result lacks real passion, making these scenes a mere revel in the beauty of human form.  Unfortunately, as the plot hinges on these incidental sex scenes, the rest of the movie really doesn't move along.  We might care a little for Maya, the film's main figure, but her inability to free herself or her lover from their predicaments makes us wonder why the filmmaker made such a big deal about her supposed independence in the first place.
  If you would like a film to show you an ideal 15th century India abounding with glitter, look no further.  If you're looking for a movie with plot, look elsewhere (try Monsoon Wedding on for size).",1042329600,14,2006,4.873156342182891

192657,5,1573623008,"This is a lushly lavish, sensuously beautiful film, superlatively directed by Mira Nair, a world class director noted for such other cinematic masterpieces as ""Salaam Bombay"", ""Mississippi Masala"", and the more recent art house feature, ""Monsoon Wedding"". As are her other films, ""Kama Sutra"" is an intelligent and mesmerizing story, peppered with excellent performances by a stellar cast.

Set in sixteenth century India, this is the story of Maya (Indira Varma), a servant girl and companion to Tara (Sarita Choudry), a Maharani destined to be Queen to a Raj. Childhood friends, they are to become palace rivals as the fates pit them one against the other, only to have them both become casualties of love. Maya, tired of being treated as a second class citizen and of receiving Tara's castoff clothing, makes a life defining decision on the eve of Tara's marriage to Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews). Sensing that the Raj desires her, Maya gives herself to him, later telling Tara that it is she who now has a cast off from Maya.

After Tara departs with her husband, Maya's perfidy is revealed to the household by Tara's hunchbacked brother, who, coveting Maya for himself, had spied upon her and saw her in flagrante delicto with the Raj. Ousted by Tara's outraged family, Maya leaves to make her way in the world. She comes across a sculptor, Jai Kumar (Ramon Tikarum), of Raj Singh's royal household and falls in love with him. Unfortunately, timing is everything. By the time Jai realizes that he, too, is in love with her, it is too late, as Maya is now the favorite courtesan of the by now debauched Raj, who is obsessed with her and cannot seem to get her out of his system, much to the dismay of Tara, as well as Jai.

Trained in the arts of love by the graceful and beautiful Rasa Devi (Rekha), Maya, as a royal courtesan, is a sensuous, beautiful sylph. Tara, now the Queen, is insanely jealous of her husband's desire for Maya, but must tolerate it, as must Jai, as it is a culturally accepted way of life. Unfortunately, when the Raj discovers that Maya and Jai are still in love, all hell breaks loose, and the piper must be paid.

This is a wonderful film of a woman's journey to find herself within culturally imposed constraints. It is a tale of the vicissitudes of life that leave imprints on one's journey. Told in the context of carnal love and desire, it also tells of a love sublime. This is essentially a woman's film, sensuous and erotic in its imagery, a veritable sumptuous feast for the senses. While there is some nudity in the film, it is tastefully and beautifully filmed, as well as highly erotic.

Indira Varma, in what is her screen debut, is sensational as the entrancing Maya, imbuing her with an impishness, as well as with a sinuous and provocative sensuality. Sarita Choudry, of ""Mississippi Masala"" fame, is excellent as the beautiful and exotic Tara, who appears to be relegated to a life of frigidity and jealousy. Rekha, the well known and exquisitely beautiful Indian actress, is hypnotic as Rasa Devi, teacher of the Kama Sutra. Naveen Andrews gives a good performance as the debauched Raj, and Ramon Tikarum is compelling as the conflicted artist. They both, however, take a backseat to the women in the film.

Filmed on location in India, this is a film that should be watched for its sheer beauty. Bravo!",1024790400,190,3348,4.7243150684931505
192658,4,1573623008,"Set in 16th century India, ""Kama Sutra"" is a seductive, sensual story of love, lust, and betrayal.  Mira Nair's hauntingly erotic film brings us a low-caste girl named Maya, who functions as both a servant and companion to Tara, who belongs to the Indian nobility.  Even as children, although Maya cleans up after Tara and wears Tara's cast-offs, it is Maya whose seductive charm entrances everyone who comes into contact with her; for all her family and financial connections, Tara is really living in Maya's shadow.

Tara is destined for great things; she's engaged to be married to the spoiled and dissolute young king Raj Singh, while Maya is trained to be only a courtesan; but Maya knows how to put her training to good use; when Tara is formally introduced to her future husband, it is Maya's hypnotic eyes that bewitch him.  But Maya is prepared to go even further than this; for once, she will make Tara know what it feels like to feast on someone's leftovers.  Maya seduces Raj Singh on the night before his wedding.  By taking such an enormous step, she may become a social outcast, but Raj Singh is hooked; he will keep Tara as his wife, since he has to have a wife, but since Maya is the woman he really wants, he will keep her as his courtesan.

It's a mess all around; Tara can't win her husband's love, she's as cold and sexually frigid as Maya is enchanting; but Maya soon becomes disgusted with Raj Singh's dissipation, and at this point she meets her soulmate, the sculptor Jai Kumar.  It's a love doomed from the start; the more Maya is repelled by Raj Singh, the more he desires her, and he'll never let her escape.  Something has to give, and something does.

 ""Kama Sutra"" is not an especially deep movie; it doesn't have a convoluted plot and most of the characters are pretty two-dimensional; but as a straightforward tale of love and lust, it's eminently satisfying.  The setting in pre-colonial India with its exotic atmosphere and lavish costumes makes for a stunning eyeful, and the actors play their parts to the hilt.  Indira Varma makes a luminous Mayra; her sensuality steams up the screen; and Sarita Choudhury is convincing as Tara, the unloved and jealous wife.  The male actors, Naveen Andrews as Raj Singh and Ramon Tikram as Jai Kumar, are good, but they don't stand out as much as the women because their roles are not as compelling; ""Kama Sutra"" is essentially a women's film, directed by woman and telling a woman's story.  It's sultry, sensual, and very much worth seeing.

Very colorful and visually stimulating movie. Absolutely wonderful sets and costuming. The sex is only part of the spectrum, so the movie doesn't really exploit sex but gives insight on how sex affects the lives of the characters. Fabulous commentary from Mira that really gives insight on what she wanted to accomplish in the film. Great DVD mastering job from the film print.",1003536000,5,544,4.860215053763441
192674,4,1573623008,"i loved the movie every bit;it was great;the cast ws great;my favourite being indira verma & ramon tikaram. if anyone who expect a porno movie will be disappointed; its not abt just sex.it;s abt LOVE. sex is taken to a higher level when its shared by 2 people who truly love each other. it has got nothing to do with the kamasutra by vatsyna.  its about society's treatment of the underclass and how the women is affected. great movie; indira verma ws simply breath taking in her indian beauty.
would recommend anyone who is interested in a love story.",985478400,10,552,4.575757575757576
192675,1,1573623008,Fake studio scenes with vulgar language and beginner modelling type people who seem to purposely speak Hindi with an affected French-Canadian accent. Even the facial expressions and background music sounds remind us of techno clubs. The story is rather poor with more emphasis on prostitution and rape rather than true love-making secrets prescribed in the original Kama Sutra. Don't get it for the name -- it has no connection whatsoever to Kama Sutra. The casts are far from sexy -- maybe rich and ugly enough to woo Mira Nair to give them a role. They hired Rekha (from Utsav) but that boring mama simply fails to uplift the mood of the movie. Mira Nair did a lousy job using a camera with a heavy reddish yellow lens when this movie could never even qualify to be a timeless collection.,982972800,11,790,4.690647482014389
192676,5,1573623008,"I loved this film!! I have it in my collection and find myself watching it over and over again. The visuals are breathtaking and the characters are all extremly easy on the eyes. I couldn't help but long for the kind of love that Jay and Maya had,especially under those circumstances. I felt that Sarita Choudry portrayed the character of Tara believably. She acted corrupted by her husband Raj and I was happy to see her survive that.  This picture also had plenty of unforgettable lines and this film never looses it's beauty even after one has seen it a hundred times..Trust me.",976752000,5,581,4.640776699029126
192677,2,1573623008,"I'm not a big fan of Bollywood movies.... I've seen only a couple that I could stand.  This movie to me felt like an attempt to create an Indian style melodrama that deals frankly with sex as a tool for feminine empowerment.  Mira Nair's intentions are good (she arranged women only screenings in India), but she winds up with a nicely photographed Bollywood movie with sex scenes replacing the musical numbers.  Is this a bad thing?  It just depends on how much that style of melodrama appeals to you.  It doesn't work for me much, but I can go for the sex instead of musical numbers, though.  It reminds me of some Bollywood movies (not to mention Hollywood movies) that deal with serious subjects by simplifying it and stripping the issues of it's depth so that it can be easily consumed by the masses.",973814400,6,805,4.555555555555555
192678,1,1573623008,"If there is one movie that is worse than the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" then this has to be it. A story of a scheming woman who intentionally sleeps with her ""best friend's"" (Tara) husband on the day of Tara's wedding and then doesn't have the sesne to keep quiet about it in revenge for Tara's crime of being born in a higher caste than she. Maya gets everyhting she deserves as everyone else is left cleaning up the mess that she creeated. One of the central ideas of the film is that if a lady isn't aware of the ""Kama Sutra"" then she'll never be able to keep a man, which is as silly as cooking bricks. The guru who supposedly teaches this art to her young pupils is so stupid that she can't even seem to tell the difference between love and sex, but is nevertheless portrayed as being a ""wise"" woman. The scenery is OK, but far outdoes the plot and the acting. Save your money. If you want real porno, try some X-rated stuff, and if you want a better story, try the daytime soap-operas.",972604800,10,990,4.2712765957446805
192679,4,1573623008,"A thought-provoking masterpiece it isn't, but KAMA SUTRA: A TALE OF LOVE does what it does well.  The plot is mostly predictable, turning the story into little more than celluloid bodice-ripper, but the entire film is filled to overflowing with unearthly beauty.  As such, it's easy to forgive the shortcomings of its plot.
Just sit back, suspend your disbelief (there's no way India was ever THAT clean in the 1500s) and feast your eyes on the startingly beautiful star-crossed lovers work their way to what, given the romance novel theme of the rest of the story, turns out to be a surprising plot twist at the end of the film.",972432000,4,629,4.709090909090909

192691,5,1573623008,"This is, indeed, a Tale, a tale for adults... For in the East, it has always been known that adults NEED and enjoy tales no less than any child would.
This story is about LOVE (of course), true love broken by the  society and its ""powerful ones"". In this case, the powerful one  is a Prince, evil yet very sexy Naveen Andrews (Kip in ""The English  Patient"").  The object of his desire is Maya, who is forced to become  courtesan, after some unfortunate events. But, Maya was brought up as a  princess...
Indeed, Maya grew up with the evil Prince's future  wife-to-be, Tara, so it gets very complicated: Prince has beautiful Tara,  but he desires beautiful Maya (they are both so beautiful, why not have  them both?...Prince manages to do that for quite some time).
There is  another amazingly beautiful woman in this film, whom I enjoyed seeing on  screen once again: famous Indian actress, Rasa Devi, playing Rekha-- older  courtesan and Maya's  mentor, and what a wonderful mentor she is!
In  short, Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, is one of the most beautiful and most  sensuous films in years. It is entertaining and at the same time  philosophical!
It was nice to see ""making love""-scenes, as  oppose to random and mostly meaningless sex-scenes that seem to dominate  today's cinema.
I only regret that there wasn't more dancing in this  film. I also regret over-using the word ""beautiful"" in my  review:)....but, in this case, it is more than appropriate.",960854400,48,1457,4.752

This film leaves you feeling beautiful  and sensuous. It is exactly what its title says: Kama Sutra, meaning  ""the Teaching of Love"". It teaches you how you should use your  body language in order to spark with luminous beauty.  Just watch it and  see yourself completely mesmerized.",953164800,4,535,4.955056179775281

This is definitely not porn--if you're looking for pure  T&A, I wouldn't rent or buy this movie...but if you appreciate erotica  with a lovely story behind it, then definitely watch this film.",950313600,5,559,4.861702127659575
