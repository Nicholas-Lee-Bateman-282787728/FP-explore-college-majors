2385770,4,B000ADS62Q,"We bought this specifically for ""What's Opera, Doc?"" and never thought of ourselves as such fans of what seems to be the majority of this collection, various Road-Runner cartoons. But you know what? With time, there's a certain, shall I say Zen, that comes from just enjoying those cartoons. I'm sure one could come up with major philosophic insights from them, on the bad karma the coyote generates for himself....but, naaaah, these are just fun.

 So it's a good value!",1163289600,3,471,4.875
2385771,4,B000ADS62Q,"I love this collection. I'm a fan of the golden collection box sets and do own these, as well. The movie collection is designed only to serve as a companion to the golden collection, and a very well companion it is.

The first movie was released in 1979 and the second movie (3rd Looney Tunes movie in all actually) was released in 1982. I received this collection free as a promotional give away from a leading merchants, but I was thinking of buying it for awhile before that anyway. It's history and shows the classic cartoons spanning over 20 years of annimation all in one movie with narration between.

But, I didn't buy it right away for one reason as I noticed it was missing the second Looney Tunes Movie. The collection is incomplete, and that's why I give it 4 out of 5 stars. The 1981 movie, ""The Looney, Looney, Looney Bugs Bunny Movie"" should have been included, as this would officially make it a true Looney Tunes Collection. Hopefully, WB will deside to release this later this year in another companion DVD set for the Looney Tunes Golden Collections.",1149552000,,1069,4.591623036649215
2385772,2,B000ADS62Q,"I bought this set hoping to supplement the Looney Tunes Golden Collection. If that's your plan, don't bother. Practically everything here is on one of the Golden Collection discs. Sure, ""greatest hits"" compilations are convenient. But as other reviewers have noted, a lot of these classic shorts have been hamhandedly redacted.

Note the title of this set: ""Looney Tunes Movie Collection."" Sounds pretty comprehensive! Odd, then, that the second movie is omitted. What you get here are the first (1979) and third (1982) Bugs Bunny movies. What you WANT is the second (1981) movie, which has ""Knighty Knight Bugs"" on it. (Y'know the one: Yosemite Sam rides the dragon and gets flattened by the drawbridge. You can't get that cartoon on DVD.) Yes, what we want is ""The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie."" No such luck.",1149379200,50,820,4.985401459854015
2385773,4,B000ADS62Q,"Got this one with a Best Buy gift card that I received as a gift for Christmas. Although it was exciting to purchase the DVD, I've mixed emotions...because of the content of Disc II. Let me talk about Disc 1 first. To start off...disc one is great and I laughed & laughed & laughed some more. It's filled with lots of memorable Looney Tunes Favorites...strung together cleverly with a modern story. The major hi-lights from Disc one have to be ""Ali Baba Bunny"", ""Robin Hood Daffy"", and ""What's Opera, Doc?"", although every cartoon is a riot. There are some episodes (cartoons) which our local tv station doesn't play too often...so it's nice to have them in their full length versions with such clarity.

On the other hand...Disc 2 is strung together with a very aggravating & annoying modern story, featuring Yosemite Sam & his loud-mouth, bratty nerd of a son. It's not amusing unless you're the type who's expecting anything to happen. In fact, this whole disc is spoiled because of the above mentioned character (Yosemite Sam's son). It's difficult to appreciate a cartoon when you have an ugly character with a really loud mouth & bad attitude. That's why I only rated the DVD 4 stars. Actually...I'd rate it about 3.8 stars...if possible. The hi-lights on Disc 2 are ""Ducking out of the cold"", ""Hassan Chop"", and ""Singing Frog"", which won an award at the cartoon festival, here in Montreal in the 90's.

If you are into a bunch of laughs and don't mind Yosemite Sam's annoying loudmouth son, this 2DVD set is for you...because it is truly a funny item...and at 171 minutes in length...it's definitely worth adding to your collection. Picture, Color & Sound Quality is remarkable and clear, making it a treat to watch over and over.

2385774,2,B000ADS62Q,"This DVD is advertised as being a great collection of classic Looney Toons.  Unfortunately, the makers felt the need to make a segway into each new cartoon by adding commentary from a Bugs Bunny (and other characters) from the 80's.  If you're like me, the Bugs Bunny from the 50's is the only way to go.  I was annoyed by the added cartoons that were obviously modern animations and not the original character voices (I'm not a big fan of Space Jam either).  Plus, some of the best toons were cut short to fit the time slot, as this was probably first made for a TV special.  If you don't mind the 80's Bugs and you aren't all that familiar with these early cartoons, then you will probably still enjoy this DVD.  If you're a purist, like me, then you would probably be better off getting one of the more expensive DVDs that feature more of the original cartoons and less of the fluff that was added in to try and make each cartoon seem as though they were all meant to fit into one storyline.",1135641600,11,994,4.317204301075269
2385775,4,B000ADS62Q,"Finally Warner Home Video has put out something worth buying as a companion set to the Golden Collection!  Although I'd rather see the cartoons stand-alone and not partially hacked up and strung together with filler for these movies, this is nonetheless a welcome addition to the Looney Tunes DVD library.  It helps to make up for the lack of later (ie good) cartoons on the Golden Collection Volume Three.  I hope they continue this trend and don't fall back to releasing useless stripped-down versions of the Golden Collections as they did in the previous two years.",1132185600,17,568,4.895833333333333
2385776,5,B000ADS62Q,"Excellent DVD, a very good complement to LT:Golden Collection Vol. 1-2-3

2385777,4,B000ADS62Q,"It always amazes me with the status of cartoons today. Yet with all the hype, there just is a whole generatiion that not only doesn't appreciate the classics like Disney or MGM with Tom & Jerry, they just ignore it. Yet for this generation, the one biggest cartoon franchise is the looney tunes. Warner Brothers has done a fantastic job the past few years re-releasing cartoons for the highly acclaimed golden collections. Although that has been great, they also have released smaller and more petite editions like the lackluster premire collection and spotlight collection, for people who want the zanyness of Bugs, without all the hassle in price. While that has been unfortunate, a change had to be made.

The Looney Tunes Movie Collection, is a 2 Disc DVD collection, that contains 2 Warner Brothers cartoon movies from the past, that have been placed on DVD for the very first time. The collection is considered as a smarter motion to display and a great ordeal of improvement, especially with the lackluster Premire and Spotlight Collections. The first disc showcases the Bugs Bunny & Road Runner movie by the late legendary Chuck Jones, which includes so many snippet of some of his most dynamic cartoons from the legendary What's Opera Doc, Duck Amuck, the Oscar-winning Pepe Le Pew toon For Scent-imental Reasons, and a unique compilation of some of the greatest chases from Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. The movie was incredibly funny, and has been remastered beautifully in a quaint display.

The second movie in this bunch is Bugs Bunny's 2rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales, a story that Friz Freleng compiled. This is about Bugs & Daffy as book salesman, going head-to-head for the chance as a pro, where both of their jobs land them in hot water. Bugs takes a awkward turn in the hot desert, where he happens to be pushed by an arab Yosemite Sam to read stories to his bratty and ego-minded son. This movie showcases some hilarious toons like Goldimouse & The Three Cats, the Chuck Jones classic One Froggy Evening, the enjoyable Ali Baba Bunny, and Bewitched Bunny which was Bugs Bunny's first encounter with Witch Hazel. Like the other DVD in this collection, the movie has been restored very well, and doesn't miss a single beat in humor.

Nevertheless, I honestly doubt that many people might consider this collection with Warner Brothers recent release of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection volume 3 coming out, but this is much better than the two previous vinette compilations from before. The Looney Tunes Movie Collection is a much needed improvement, and is a great buy for the die hard looney tunes fanatic, or anybody who hasn't seen the zanyness yet.

Disc 1 contains 1979's Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie, and disc 2 has Bugs Bunny's 1001 Rabbit Tales from 1982! Don't worry, there's nowhere near THAT many shorts in this movie, it's just an expression! Both movies contain footage from shorts that have never been on DVD in their entirety, even today since the WB ran out of dough to restore any more Looney Tunes shorts never before on DVD! Both discs in this collection also have bonus live-action documentaries of popular stars from 2005 (when this was released) giving their opinions on the Looney Tunes past and then-present, including footage of the recently-dearly-departed Joe Alaskey at work, plus commercials for other great toons on DVD, mostly from Hanna-Barbera! Around a decade later, this collection was joined up with volume 2 of the Spotlight Collection as a 4-disc double feature set, and yet they're still made & sold separately, on top of the double feature! Go ahead and add these renowned compilation features to your Looney Tunes DVD collections! Happy 76th birthday to Bugs Bunny, a day late, when I typed this review!

We even named one of our dogs Hansel with BB's pronunciation. For kids who lived out in the Alaskan wilderness, with no neighbors, no easy access to the outside world, and only had generator power to run the TV once a week (to charge batteries for our radios), Bugs and friends were a real treat.

2385886,4,B000ADS62Q,"As a bargain DVD, this is a real gem. While the transfer doesn't wow, Bugs and pals are still just as funny for my son as they were when I was a kid. And what parent, inundated with sickly sweet cartoons of today, doesn't long for the sly and wry humor of the Looney Tunes gang once in a while? Proof the '50s and '60s were far more subversive than today's far safer kids' shows.

This one was in my son's Easter basket and I really enjoyed watching the cartoons again with him after breakfast and even laughed out loud a time or two. Makes me feel like my childhood memories--Michigan J. Frog still rocks--are moving on to a new generation. (Or, considering Looney Tunes longevity, a third or fourth generation at this point.)",1303603200,3,727,4.425373134328358

2385888,2,B000ADS62Q,"This, the ""third installment"" in the spotlight collection series is a real let down and I write this so you can beware. The Spotlight collection which apparently is just the ""Golden Collection"" put out a second time with a few small tweeks, a different cartoon here and there, is a great collection of cartoons. I wanted my kids to see such silliness and be able to laugh like I did as a child. For that, the collection as a whole is fantastic. Classic cartoons I remember and love and my kids love too though I tend to edit some violence here and there with the remote.

However as I mentioned this third installment is just plain weird. It's the ""movie collection"" if you didn't notice and these ""movies"" just don't work. Here's why.

1) Virtually all of the cartoon shorts are edited down and you don't get to see the whole cartoon as you would have in the past, or like you do in the rest of the Spotlight Collection.

2) The content is primarily classic old cartoons chopped up with horrible, ugly, poorly drawn and very out of place modern looking animation in between the poor dissected originals as some sort of supposed unifying thread, which is not only not needed, but intrusive and annoying.

The first disc is bad, but the second even worse, with a storyline that is base to the point of being almost insulting. I can understand perhaps after every Looney Tune ever made was printed on a DVD as a last ditch attempt at squeezing some money out of the buying public that loves them, that you might venture to put out this horrible blemish on the world of cartooning,  but to stick it in the middle of the spotlight collection only tricks people into thinking they might be getting what the rest of the collection delivers, which as I said before are classic full length cartoons.

My advice, skip this one and save yourself some agony, move on to the 4th edition and never look back, there really is no 3rd installment in the Spotlight Collection.",1283212800,3,1959,4.5354107648725215

2385896,3,B000ADS62Q,"This is an okay buy if you find it on Amazon at a discount.  I enjoyed the cartoons.  However, there are a lot of classics here with NO introductory titles...  And the follow-up ""moral of the story"" sequences were cut off altogether!!  Each of the cartoons were interwoven with a 90's narration from Bugs, who seemed more sophisticated than fun or spontaneous.  So these cartoons ran like one long ""movie"", which lost me at times.  I think the editors forgot their primary audience are kids?  And kids, like the adults who like to watch cartoons, have short attention spans. Cartoons are great with breaks, so you can grab your snack or cereal, or run to the bathroom.

I.E.:  it would have been better to have a collection of the original classic cartoons with their follow-up conclusions and sequences.  These should have never been deleted!",1237075200,4,843,4.791666666666667

""Looney, Looney, Looney Bugs Bunny Movie"" isn't on here, nor is it even available on it's own. I know there are a lot of people who think it's redundant or disappointing to see chopped up pieces of the same cartoons over and over in each of these movies, but why buy the movies in the first place if you don't like that? It just doesn't make sense to release this DVD without including the missing one when it is just as unique as the others--""Satan's Waitin'"", ""The Unmentionables"", and ""The Oswalds""....come on now.

2385904,5,B000ADS62Q,Who knew that Looney Tunes would remain funny after 50 years or so.  Many of the best episodes are the oder ones.  Many of today's cartoons are watered down since there is an atmosphere of 'offending people.'  There's so many one liners and sophisticated jokes that these make cartoon watching hip.  My kids love these cartoons as much as I did and I can't see that for many other programs.  They are silly and bold without being gross.,1212796800,,436,4.538461538461538

I hope that Warner Bros. plans to release Looney...Bugs Bunny Movie in the future as well as some of the lesser movies such as Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island & Daffy Duck's Quackbuster's.

Some of the shorts found in this dvd are also in the golden collection volumes 1-3 but the way this movie is put together is awesome.  Disc one is obviously better than the 2nd, the first disc features bugs and many shorts are strung together in the encompassing theme of 'chases.'  The second disc has some great shorts in it but it is collaborated with yosemite sam and his extremely annoying son.  I have no idea why anyone would make yosemite's son be so stupid looking and abhorrent, if he was a mini yosemite it would be alot better.  I can't believe that anyone agreed to put that hideous character in this DVD. If you can stand the annoying character which almost ruins the 2nd dvd in this set then this is a great buy.

The presentation of the shorts, tied together by a storyline, make the cartoons that much more interesting.

Overall, if you are only looking for an excellent cross-section of Looney Tunes, then this is the DVD collection for you.
