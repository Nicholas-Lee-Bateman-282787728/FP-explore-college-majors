8636150,5,B00HUZ8YAG,"This DVD is the next step after Mindful Movement 1.  If you are a beginner, you should probably start over there.  But I tried this DVD after I got the hang of Mindful Movement 1, and it was a great transition.

The moves are similar, but more intense than 1.  For me, they required much more focus and offered a workout that was just a bit more strenuous.  You don't have to be a yoga expert to do these DVDs, but if you are looking for a 30-minute boost during the day, a short break from your thoughts (I really had to concentrate), or an effective workout you can do with nothing more than a yoga mat, this is a great option.

I like that these DVDs seem to be self-produced, because then you know that they WORK for Julie, who stars in them. If you are looking for workout models smiling on screen through their workout, this is not for you.  But if you are looking for a program that actually works in real life, this is a great one.  I always felt stronger and more focused after it was over, and I recommend it to all my friends who work out regularly or are more experienced at yoga.",1420156800,,1092,4.166666666666667
8636151,5,B00HUZ8YAG,"I loved this 2nd edition because version 1 was getting a bit easy, I have now given up my gym membership and needed to push myself a bit harder. Its a great DVD and even though I am not a caregiver, I love that I don't need to go anywhere to do my workout.",1419638400,,256,3.759259259259259
8636152,5,B00HUZ8YAG,"My wife (Fit not Fat) tried Mindful Movement 1, and seeing her reaction, got me to try #2. Seeing the success she had in losing weight without making it a chore was a real change. I tried the second disk, and found it strenuous and a good workout. It's something a guy can do if he's flexible and needs to keep stretching his routine.",1419552000,,334,4.234375
8636153,5,B00HUZ8YAG,"It is obvious that the creator of the Mindful Movement 2 DVD, Julie Bowes, is someone who can relate to the stress of being a caregiver and realizes the importance of taking timeout for ones own nourishment.  Her genuine concern for other caregivers is apparent in her gentle encouragement and peaceful state of mind throughout the DVD.  She offers a calm moment away from your cares and the opportunity to take time for yourself to breathe and move freely.  In this 2nd DVD in the series, Julie offers more words of advice and inspiration and picks the physical practice up a notch by adding more difficulty.  As she implies, the practice should be undertaken with mindfulness and an awareness of ones individual body.  Her quest to nurture the caregiver is very inspirational!",1418515200,,778,4.863636363636363
8636154,4,B00HUZ8YAG,"This  DVD is for anyone who wants to benefit from yoga and learn from an excellent teacher who presents in a very genuine, caring way. The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is if you are looking for a fancily produced DVD, this isn't that kind of a DVD. If you're looking for an excellent instructional video from someone who embodies what yoga can do to keep you fit and vital, this DVD is for you.",1418256000,,407,3.9634146341463414
8636155,5,B00HUZ8YAG,"First of all, my review of Mindful Movement 1 pertains to this one as well:  ""Having gone through a time where keeping myself energetic enough to care for someone, I was curious how this program would work. I was very pleased with it's ability to acknowledge the emotional, spiritual and physical buckets that need filling at a time of quick depletion. The creator, Julie Bowes, clearly leads by example as she comes across with serenity, confidence and strength. Not to mention she is extremely physically fit! It appears self-produced which adds to the authenticity of her offering. I highly recommend this program to people who could use help in taking care of themselves in all dimensions, and also during times of great care giving stress (or stress in general)!""  Now onto Mindful Movement 2:  I used Mindful Movement 1 for about 2 months before wanting to go the next step.  Julie filmed this in Hawaii, so it's a beautiful background! She challenges you in just the right amounts and continues to offer the multidimensional support (physical, emotional, spiritual). Do you see the picture on the cover?  That's really her! Don't you want that physique? This DVD is how you get it - with the added bonus of the serenity as a result of the meditative quality of the program.",1418256000,,1280,4.82648401826484
8636156,5,B00HUZ8YAG,"This DVD is the perfect follow up to Mindful Movement 1. The routine is definitely more advanced but not so hard I couldn't get it. Again Julie has such a calming and pleasant way about her, and it's filmed in Hawaii so you feel like you are right there with her. well done!",1418256000,,274,4.188679245283019
