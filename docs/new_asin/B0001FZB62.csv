1996544,5,B0001FZB62,"I really like the digital fireplace! It's a great way to make the room feel cozy without the hassles of an actual fireplace. This way I get to feel like I'm in a cabin in the woods, with all the convenience of not leaving home! I really like it. I was a little worried that the picture might not be clear, or that it might have weird sound effects, but actually the picture is great, and the crackles and pops are clearly from the original fire - And the funny thing is that I swear the area around the television feels warmer when the digital fireplace is playing.  : ) I'd highly recommend it to everyone young at heart.",1106265600,13,622,4.226890756302521
1996545,5,B0001FZB62,"I saw this product on the Ellen Degeneres show a few weeks ago and loved the way it looked.  I didn't know if it could be purchased by just anyone so first checked with Amazon - and there it was!  All I wanted was the sound of the fire - no music.  I love to read but don't like total silence so would have the TV on low in the background but often something would catch my attention and I would stop reading.  This fireplace is just perfect.  I read and hear the fire, note the inobtrusive flames without looking at them, and almost feel warmer.  I have four dogs and they will be asleep all round me as though they found it comforting.  Anyway, I love this product!",1106179200,27,667,4.124031007751938
1996546,2,B0001FZB62,"Don't judge a book or in this case a DVD by it's cover. The packaging for ""Digital Fireplace"" is impressive, but the video quality is not. The overall image seems soft, and at the end (when the flames die down) it looks as if the gain control in the camera comes on because the image gets grainy.

It's a strong fire but that's all you see in the beginning just the flames (which are cut off at the top). Look at the image on Amazon's detail page and you'll notice you can't see the logs, they're just black shadows. Later in the video the fire is not as bright and you can see the logs a little better.

I would have liked to see the flames not burn down to a small fire, the purpose of a fireplace video is to see the best of a fire - all the time. Audio is good, but at the end you can hear what seems to be a fan running or something, and sounds of people moving in the background. There is also a ""corporate logo"" superimposed in the lower right corner of the screen all the time. I can barely stand this on my cable shows, I certainly don't want it on the videos I pay for.

When I hit the menu key on my remote there is no menu, just a title page showing the date January 28th and the time 3:44am Looks like this DVD is from a consumer grade DVD recorder like mine at home. There is no way to get the disc to repeat without programming my DVD player to run it again.

I would have given this only one star, but the Packaging and disc art is nice. The bottom line... I really expected better.",1105401600,98,1498,4.0
1996547,5,B0001FZB62,"If you are in search of a realistic fireplace DVD, this is it.  No frills, no music, no hand with a poker.  Just straight fire burning start to finish.  Audio is real, not looped like an old video I used to have.

For those of us not fortunate enough to have a fireplace, this DVD on a big screen is as close as you can get.  I'll be running it with Christmas Lounge during our upcoming cocktail party.  Ambience in the bag, baby!",1101081600,18,430,4.120481927710843

1996570,2,B0001FZB62,"Purchased this DVD several years ago to give to my brother as a Christmas present.  Thought he'd enjoy it because he does not have a fireplace in his home and mentioned one time that he misses having one.  The DVD was delivered promptly however, it wasn't as great as I'd expected it to be.

1996574,5,B0001FZB62,"We tried out the three ""fireplaces"" available on Amazon Instant Videos, and this one is definitely first place. It runs for two hours, and is an actual burn-down of the logs - with some enhanced flames in the back of the hearth, which the chemistry / physics teacher in our household figured out. There are satisfying crackling & burning sounds, the occasional sound of a burned log dropping. The image is a little blurry, at least on our TV, but we don't mind. Maybe irrational, but we love this one.",1355875200,,501,4.5777777777777775

Fish Tank, etc...but I cannot get to a place on the screen where I have the choice...what I've got is only a fireplace. thank goodness amazon gave me some promo credit on the purchase @ 5.99$ and it wound up costing 99cents....that's about what it's worth.

1996587,4,B0001FZB62,"I received this DVD as a gift some years ago.  I thought it was a lark, watched it once and put it away.  Well just recently I had my cable shut off so as to quit watching so much darn tv.  However this left a large 27"" box sitting in my LR doing nothing.  I needed to keep it for renting movies so I couldn't dedicate the space to something else.  So I decided to get out the fireplace DVD and turn my bix square box into a fireplace.  What a great idea!  This DVD is realistic because it is literally a video of a fire burning from start to finish.  I have found no control options so I just watch it from start to finish and have it on loop on my DVD player so it runs continuously.  There are some quirks...you do hear some background noise every once in a while.  I always laugh when I hear the rear beep of a fork truck or something way in the background.  And frankly until I read another reviewers comments, I NEVER noticed the logo in the rh corner.  I have literally watched this thing hundreds of times and didn't notice it.  Really if you have OCD and tend to fixate on things then maybe that will bother you.  Didnt bother me enough to notice it.  My friends love coming over for parties and having it on.  They say it literally makes the room feel warmer.",1326412800,,1269,4.097560975609756
1996588,5,B0001FZB62,"This is the second digital fireplace DVD that I have ordered.  Every year at our Christmas open house we have it playing on our big screen TV. During the open house our friends use it as a background for their Christmas photos. Everyone gets a real kick out of it.  This year I purchased one for my mother since she always asks me to play it while she sits and reads.  I swear the house actually warms up when its playing.  I have really enjoyed the DVD and while it may not be perfect, ooh the crackling sound isn't just right or the flame isn't high enough (a few complaints I've read)... it is really lots of fun.",1324252800,,616,4.194915254237288
1996589,1,B0001FZB62,"The video quality here is unacceptable and, as others have mentioned, the sound is totally sub par. When the fireplace crackles, black lines flicker through the video; the publisher watermarked the fireplace with 'MD' on the lower right; and the dark areas are totally boxy and over-compressed. In short, I prefer the free YouTube clips in HD to this crap. Don't waste your money.",1322092800,2,380,4.953125

1996591,4,B0001FZB62,"My six year old son kept asking if he could blow out the fire and just for entertainment value, it's worth half the price of pausing the video every time he blows on the screen. I'm just glad that he didn't go fetch a bucket of water right on to the flat panel.

It actually ""warms"" the room with its orange and red tones and glow, as well as the sounds of a crackling fire as the wood burns.  Great background to have on the TV, creating just the right atmosphere on a chilly day!  The fact you can change the fire from a low-burning fire, somewhat romantic, to a roaring fire is an added bonus.  A nice,quiet addition to our home accessories.  Even if you already have a fireplace in your home - as we do - this is still a plus because it is quick and easy.",1262476800,,580,4.052631578947368

Actually, I've always wanted a REAL fireplace, but finally decided this was as close as I was going to get <g>

We pitched a tent in the living room and put the computer screen on the floor for the boys to gather around -marshmallows in hand. The rental downloaded and started to play almost instantly. We liked how the fire is set up - not too zoomed in, and with the logs stacked in a space that actually looks like a fireplace. Plus, it started as a large fire, but burned slowly to a soft rolling fire - over a period of almost 2 hours. We turned down the crackling sounds until it was just the right amount for our room.

Save your money",1198800000,,241,4.5813953488372094
1996626,5,B0001FZB62,There are four types of fires on this HD fireplace and all are vivid and realistic.,1197590400,,83,4.25
1996627,2,B0001FZB62,"I agree with Kris on almost every point. The video looks as if it were shot with a $150 VHS camcorder that never quite got its autofocus right. And after about 60 seconds of viewing, I can't take my eyes off the annoying logo in the lower right-hand corner of the picture.

The menu selection offers you three different ""fires""; in actuality, it is the same fire filmed at three different stages of its existence. Yep; someone plopped a tripod in front of a fire one evening, chopped it into three segments, packaged it, and sold the result. Complete with, as Kris notes, some background noise, including a plane going overhead.

I can get my DVD's menu function to bring me back to the options; and it is, in fact, a video of a fire in a fireplace. So it gets at least two stars from me because of basic truth in advertising.

But save your money. If you want this sort of video relaxation, Amazon also carries ""Ambient Fire: Ultimate Video Fireplace DVD."" The packaging, in this case, looks squirrely. But the product is $4 less expensive, shot in HD for a superior image (the DVD itself is not HD or Blu-Ray), Dolby 5.1 sound, and truly gives you a choice between a few different fires that loop continuously.",1196035200,,1212,4.5
1996628,1,B0001FZB62,"Having purchased this DVD based on the other reviews, I was very disappointed.  The quality of the video was very distorted (particularly on my 46"" HD TV) and the color was an unworldly orange.  If you are planning on using it on a large screen TV, I would look at other alternatives.

The packaging was also very low-quality.  This resulted in the DVD coming lose in its case and getting scratched up.  It took some significant effort on my part to clean up the scratches enough to make it play properly.

A Better Option:

Shortly after purchasing this one, I saw and picked up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Living-Fireplace-DVD/dp/B000CR7U68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Living Fireplace DVD</a>&nbsp;at a local discount retailer.

1996629,1,B0001FZB62,"I regret this purchase.  It is essentially, three different shots of what seems to be the same fire.

It has good color, great sound, you can hear every crackle and hiss - at one point the logs even break down and fall in half.  It's really great.  I just light some cedar incense and it's almost all there.  You couldn't ask for more in a fake fireplace.",1138579200,,429,3.941860465116279

1996663,5,B0001FZB62,"When we had guests and tried to have a fire in the front room fireplace the room got too hot.  So, we purchased this DVD, put our old TV in the fireplace, ran the cords out behind the fireplace tools and hid the DVD player behind a chair.  Our fireplace screen is a French antique with black iron mesh behind the grill work so you can't see the dark TV.  However, my husband is still planning to make a black, plywood cutout to sit tight around the TV screen.  When the DVD plays it looks exactly as if we have a roaring fire in the fireplace without the heat.  All one can see are the flames and hear the crackling.  We and our guests love it!  Now if someone would just figure out how to package a fire smell.",1134172800,12,711,4.071942446043166
1996664,5,B0001FZB62,"I was a bit nervous when I purchased this dvd as I know that some of these ambient dvds are annoying. But this dvd got it right... a simple, clear, beautiful image of a burning fire with clear, crisp audio of the fire burning. I need this dvd to make some of my presentations at work a little less ""corporate"" feeling and this creates a fantastic vibe that everyone has commented on when they walk in.",1124496000,14,401,4.2894736842105265
1996665,3,B0001FZB62,"This is a good, straight fire: no hands, no music, nice crackle.  Annoyances:  faint background sounds (actually, I didn't mind them); black trademark in lower right corner (not too distracting); inconsistent lighting at end (I like the fact that the fire burns down to embers -- however, as this happens, the camera adjusts the light so it ends up looking like morning, not night; kind of defeats the glowing coals effect and makes you feel like you stayed up all night).",1108684800,49,472,4.814814814814815

I love watching it on a cold winter night, curled up in bed, when there are no other lights in the room.  A great way to reduce stress.",1428019200,,312,3.967741935483871

With the fire burning and some soft music in the background, I have a relaxing, intimate setting for myself or guests. I love the fact that the fireplace looks real and its easy to imagine it heating the room.  I put it on and forget about it for two hours. No smoke or mess.  It has sound effects of fire cracking and logs settling.  WELL done.  Brings back memories.",1383868800,,428,4.182926829268292
