2785140,4,B000NVKZVK,"If you loved ""Prime Suspect"", you won't want to miss this. Janine Lewis, played by Caroline Quentin, is a Manchester-based single mother of three (soon to be four) who also happens to be a Detective Chief Inspector.  Coming home to surprise her husband with the good news of her promotion to DCI, she herself is surprised to find him having sex with the housecleaner in their bedroom.  After the initial shock, Janine handles this curveball with aplomb, juggling the draining dual roles of chief homicide investigator and sole domestic engineer without losing her mind.  She even has time for a promising, if somewhat ill-advised, flirtation with a junior officer on her squad.  Janine is Earth Mother to Jane Tennison's Ice Queen, but she is every bit as committed to her job.  Like Helen Mirren's Tennison, she must also deal with daily verbal reamings from her male superior and his obligatory musings about a female's capacity to handle her responsibilities in a predominantly male profession.  Janine manages to do it all and somehow keeps on smiling.  British TV series have a much more realistic feel than do their American counterparts; I can't imagine that an enormously pregnant 40-something woman who looks her age and is a size 18 in the best of times would ever be welcomed as the lead in an American police procedural.  Caroline Quentin proves that it is possible to be larger and more mature than a supermodel and still be warm and sexy.  I hope more of this series is on offer, though I have no idea why they chose the title.  There is nothing 'blue' about Janine Lewis--she's the type everyone would be lucky to have as a spouse or a best friend.",1187913600,57,1663,4.7630662020905925

2785164,5,B000NVKZVK,"Just about any British mystery is a winner with me. They actually make you think. Always well done and everything in era is accurate. The actors are real people, not just a pretty face/body. Aperson can relate to them and ride along in their pockets and share the excitement/experience.",1378598400,,286,4.857142857142857

2785166,3,B000NVKZVK,"We had no idea what to expect when we started watching this story; but quickly learned it was to be filled with the sometimes gruesome details of regular life with all of its problems and annoyances. Broken marriages, disobedient kids, too much to do with too little time to do it; it was all there in spades; this two-part story impressed me as being very hectic.

Over and above that the detecting part is pretty good as newly promoted Detective Chief Inspector Janine Lewis, played by Caroline Quentin, tries to balance her responsibilities as a detective with her responsibilities as a mother. The story is fast paced and requires one concentrate on what is going on or risk losing track of what is happening.

I suggest you view this one before you buy it as it does have some polarizing elements.",1322352000,3,802,4.680851063829787
2785167,1,B000NVKZVK,"Much of the success of murder mysteries depends on mood.  People who compare this series to Morse or Jane Tennyson are idiots.  The actor in the lead role has absolutely no gravitas, the dialogue is childish, the music puts one in mind of the old ""Columbo"" TV series.  Desperately bad all the way around.",1303603200,2,304,4.592592592592593
2785168,3,B000NVKZVK,"The Suspect series, in my opinion, the very best; hence, this somewhat copy cat is only a three.
It is quite predictable and somewhat unrealistic. A woman whith 3 children and pregnant again, and not young, going through a divorce and is suppose to be a top notch DCI. I don't think so - something has got to give. My litmus test is to keep the video and watch again - both my wife and I agreed to send this along to our British friend for her pleasure; hence, we didn't want to see it again. Bloody hell!",1290902400,,505,4.163265306122449

2785170,4,B000NVKZVK,"This is a series where the characters are real and likable. The relationships between the characters are well developed. The plots are well thought out, and there is humor interspersed throughout each episode. Caroline Quentin hardly is the hard-edged cold figure normally played by female leads in a crime series. I like it and recommend it.",1279584000,,342,5.125

2785172,5,B000NVKZVK,Why are the British so good at these murder mysteries?  You will want the entire set.,1261353600,2,85,4.3125
2785173,4,B000NVKZVK,"Americans say ""scream bloody murder""; Brits say ""scream blue murder"".  In Blue Murder, Set 1 there is also some 'blue' content.  The murder victim, we learn, has been making s/m blue movies.  He is found, gutted, at his gardening allotment, feet in the shed, face, torso and legs in the dirt.  The principal investigator, Janine Lewis, is played by Carolyn Quentin; many mystery fans will remember her as the sidekick in the Jonathan Creek series.  She is now a single mom, having discovered her husband in flagrante, with three kids and a fourth on the way.  The narrative cuts between her problems and responsibilities at home and her work at the south Manchester nick, where she serves as a DCI with a largely male team and an annoying, bean-counting, paper-pushing supervisor.  This all sounds like Prime Suspect, but the atmosphere is more comic, even though the crimes are violent and real.  The supervisor is a little too fussy; the problems at home are more annoying than insuperable and the Quentin character, with her weight, pregnancy and would-be love life, is a 'lighter' character than Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison.

The supporting cast is strong, with the ensemble police team consisting of just the right mix of 'characters'.  The mystery is plausible and interesting.  The production values are solid.  All in all, a very, very good series.",1258243200,,1357,4.982222222222222
2785194,3,B000NVKZVK,"Typical british., hard to understand and the sound quality is suspect. The story line is creative and interesting.",1253404800,,114,5.388888888888889
2785195,5,B000NVKZVK,This is a great series.  The characters are believeable and the story lines are well written and executed.  It is worth your time.,1252713600,,130,4.608695652173913
2785196,4,B000NVKZVK,"For those used to the polished British mysteries like 'Midsomer Murders', this series might be a bit jarring.  I was surprised when I started watching it how... there's no other way to say this... how cheap it felt.  The camera work and sound quality felt more like a daytime soap than what I'd come to expect from this genre.  The overall feel was somehow more gritty and raw, to the point of being annoying at times.

Despite this, or perhaps because of it, I think it ended up a pretty good series.  The characters are intriguing and flawed, but with some depth.  While having to watch yet another scene of the main character trying to balance work and family obligations does occasionally get wearing, at the same time it adds to the understanding of the characters.  And I wouldn't say it entirely takes away from the main mystery, though I also wouldn't say it particularly added to it.

This is less a mystery series and more of a drama, though the individual cases are interesting enough - it's the overriding story of the people that's more prevalent in this series.  If you want very little character study and straight-up mystery, you might find this series off-putting.  But if you like some back story and real character development to your mysteries (and don't mind the occasional appearance of melodrama!) you'll find this a decent set.  I would say it's more 'Foyle's War' in terms of how much attention is focused on the main characters as opposed to the mystery of the episode.",1240963200,,1495,4.689655172413793

2785198,5,B000NVKZVK,"I bought this set no knowing anything about the series and was very pleased, not the best series I have ever watched, but very good.

2785200,4,B000NVKZVK,"""Blue Murder, Set 1,""gives us the first episodes of a substantial British crime drama/police procedural, told from the woman's point of view.  It is made by Granada for Independent Television (ITV). It is, apparently, a ratings hit in the U.K., where it drew 8.4 million viewers, a number almost unheard-of there, in its May, 2003 broadcast debut.  It consistently ranks #1 in its primetime slot. However, the series is only now becoming available on this side of the pond, through its DVD release.  It's leavened, no matter how gritty episodes may be, with some sly humor, and domestic subplots.

The series was created, and the first episodes written, by Cath Staincliffe, who has said she's particularly interested in the problems of women, single mothers, trying to be good mothers to demanding families while holding down demanding jobs. Staincliffe is a Northern/Midlands British girl, through and through: she was born in Bradford, graduated from Birmingham University, and, as a graduate, moved to Manchester to start a job.  She has published several mysteries, including a series about another Manchester single mum/private investigator.  Her work has been nominated for awards, and is highly praised by her hometown critics.  Val McDermid, Manchester's reigning crime queen, said, Staincliffe""has her finger on the pulse of her city and that rare ability to write about love motherhood and friendship without sentimentality, a must,"" in ""The Manchester Evening News."" Another local reviewer said her work was ""compassionate, exciting, and down-to-earth. Infused, also with that rare and precious ingredient: true feeling.""  And you'd better believe me, in the Midlands, you'd better be down-to-earth.  ""The Yorkshire Post"" said her work was ""warm, compassionate and engrossing.""

Caroline Quentin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonathan-Creek-Season-One/dp/B000GYI3MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jonathan Creek - Season One</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-Behaving-Badly-The-Complete-Collection-The-Original-British-TV-Series/dp/B000H6SXZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men Behaving Badly - The Complete Collection (The Original British TV Series)</a>); an award-winning comic actress, plays the lead part, newly-promoted Detective Chief Inspector Janine Lewis, and reveals that she's got solid dramatic chops, as well as comic ones.  She plays a contemporary top cop, supervising a squad in the English midlands city of Manchester; but she's also a single mum of four, who finds it as difficult to supervise goings-on in her own home.  Ian Kelsey (""Casualty"") plays her handsome lead detective, source of some romantic and professional stress.  Among the company, Nicholas Murchie stands out as Detective Schapp.

The stories are set in Manchester, and filmed there: it provides a strong background to them, as a place boasting great diversity of place and atmosphere, and equally great diversity of population.  It's just a bustling, interesting-looking town we don't often get to see over here.  And the series has been filmed with a liberal hand, no shortage of cars and people in the streets, bars, police station, etc. However, a word to the wise, the actors apparently have been encouraged to use local accents and slang, which add greatly to the foreign flavor and pleasure of the production, if you can make out what they're saying, in an accent that's rather unfamiliar to us on this side of the pond.  And there are no subtitles.

The first episode, ""Cry Me A River,"" a two-parter, is by Staincliffe.  With three kids at home, and another on the way, Lewis rushes home, champagne in hand, to share the good news with her husband - she's just been made Manchester's first female DCI.  She finds her husband in bed with the cleaner Tina, and it's champagne for one.  Along comes her first big murder case: she's hardly in the mood, but she worked hard for the promotion and she's determined to succeed.  Matthew Tilley, a 42-year old teacher/deputy head of a local high school, has been left to die, almost eviscerated, face down in the mud of his allotment.  Lewis's prime suspect is on the run, her only eyewitnesses an elderly dying man and a seven-year old girl.  This episode most closely resembles the&nbsp;&nbsp;series; it's more violent than the author's usual, and more powerful.  It strongly addresses women's concerns and issues; we're going to find out that the vic wasn't a very nice guy. Mind you, we see a lot of pretty scene of crime officers, and a best black girlfriend for Lewis: we won't see these again.  Nor, single mum that she may be,  will we again see Lewis ironing,  or picking the head lice out of her daughter's hair, as she does in these episodes.

The third episode,"" Hit and Run,"" also written by Staincliffe, was praised by ""The Birmingham Post"" as ""an original thriller whose protagonist is no-nonsense and thoroughly likeable... combines gritty realism with a clever plot.""  And you may be sure, once again, those Midlands girls had better be no-nonsense.  Another local publication called it ""gritty, intelligent, humane, and involving... a highly believable heroine rooted in a vivid and convincing Manchester background.""  Lewis is dropping her son Tom off at school when she sees a horrifying hit-and-run that kills a little school girl.  At the same time she takes a call about a girl's body fished from the river.  The two events will prove related.

The fourth episode, ""Up in Smoke,"" is an interesting and rather gruesome one.  After the cremation of suicide victim Charlotte Moran, evidence suggests that a second body was burned with hers in the coffin.

The fifth episode, ""Fragile Relations,"" involves ethnic tensions between the city's white and Muslim communities.  It's not the most original plot in the world, and suffers from an excess of preachy political correctness.

Episode Six, ""Lonely,"" is again a powerful woman's story, involving the death of pretty young child minder Diane Waugh, and Lewis's only witness to the crime, an autistic boy the victim looked after.

The series inevitably will be compared to Helen Mirren's ""Prime Suspect,"" and it holds its own, although the mysteries in this series are lighter than, not as powerful as some in the ""Suspect"" series.  But, of course, where we'd all mostly agree that Tennyson is tall, slim, and regal-looking, we'd also mostly agree that Lewis isn't.  But her homies are crazy about her, anyway.",1216339200,10,6505,5.406342913776016
2785201,5,B000NVKZVK,"The story is simple but tricky enough to let you get lost in some contradictory details. You are all the more lost because the obvious elements are leading you astray, along the path of a serial killer, when it is not, along the path of rotten young people when it is the adults, teachers and school-principals mind you, who are. You are phased out by love when that love can find some real soil in a relation of the master-slave type. And of course we are in England, so no deluxe free scientific police or forensics because it is expensive, and hurry up because we have to fulfill our targeted objectives in efficiency and productivity, as if crime and criminal investigations had anything to do with efficiency, productivity and nothing to do with high level technology and patience, a lot of patience. The Detective Chief Superintendant is a blind idiot creating stress with his whip that wants to beat some clear water into mayonnaise. Add to it that the poor Detective Chief Inspector is a woman, pregnant, divorced and with three kids, one already in his mid-teens and you have the perfect overdose of stress to end up in a hospital. And she manages, with a lot of luck it is true, to get a culprit, with hard evidence and a confession. The crime is sordid, like life, but the series is British so the actors are regular actors who do act properly and convincingly. They even know how to cry without looking or sounding like mooing cows or meowing cats, both with a sore throat. And that is what I like in British series. The good acting and the intricate plot. What's more the series is long enough for us not to be rushed through the action at a TGV or Eurostar speed. And of course the solution is not necessarily what we were expecting and it avoids the worst worn out humdrum pedophiliac outcome, since for once teachers and school principals, at least those implied in this case, were not child molesters not teenager rapists. Good entertainment.

2785202,1,B000NVKZVK,"Blue Murder is perfect for those who really want a weepy soap opera, but whose significant other demands a mystery.  The main character is infuriatingly bland and one wonders how or why she became a Chief Inspector, or an actress for that matter.  The dialogue, such as it is, begs the question: Are you really trying to put us to sleep?  You'll hear such memorable lines as (disclaimer:  I made these up.  Actual lines may be far worse.) ""We've got to work hard to crack this case!"" and ""Let's all work together!""  She should have added, ""And I really, really mean it!""
