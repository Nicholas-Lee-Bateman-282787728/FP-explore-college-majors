6332461,5,B00J3QG6Y6,"Buy this set.

With this set, not only do you get more episodes on less discs (so you have less to scratch or lose), but it will last you longer than the box set. The Box sets have an annoying fold-out set up where the plastic casings break easily when you take the disc in and out. The hot glue holding everything together starts to come off after two years or so.

I lost my Series 4 box set to this fate and Series 3 is not to far behind. So I'm really glad that they are rereleasing these. They are two disc DVDs. So I know from past dvds and experience that these will last. This set is really great.

But despite anything else, consider the prices!

6 Disc Fold Out Box Set - $45-$80 (On the expensive side, but if you like bonus features, it's got quite a lot. This set doesn't)

6 Disc DVD Set - $30-$45 (Cheaper, but it's still got a lot of discs. Higher probability of scratching, however less episodes per disc to lose.)

This, 2 Disc Half Season DVD - $12-$25 for half a season, making it $24-$50 for the whole season. And $50 is pushing it. Plus you only have four discs rather than six to scratch.

It's up to you. All your preference. Get the bonus Features with the Box Set, Save Space with the 6 Disc DVD Set, or get this longer lasting/safer set.

Happy collecting!",1402358400,13,1283,4.186991869918699

6332467,4,B00J3QG6Y6,"All of Series 3 is good Doctor Who, especially ""Blink"" (in Part Two) so I give Part One 4 stars.  However, I originally bought the entire series 3, as well as the entire series 2 eight or ten years ago and while watching them again I discovered that almost all of the disks had become unplayable through degeneration or corruption.  I've got DVDs I've had twenty years, even ones I've used for recording and not had a similar problem.  It made me wonder if it was worth buying Doctor Who disks, especially with the prices of new episodes.  To date, I've had no problem with the parts 1 and 2 of series 2 and 3 which I purchased, but I've only had them a few months.",1444003200,3,665,4.253968253968254

Smith and Jones has got to be one of the best episodes that introduces a new companion.  Shakespeare Code, Gridlock, Daleks in Manhattan, and The Lazarus Experiment are also incredibly great!  David Tennant, Freema and all the other supporting actors and guest stars are also really good as well.",1441411200,,488,4.9753086419753085
