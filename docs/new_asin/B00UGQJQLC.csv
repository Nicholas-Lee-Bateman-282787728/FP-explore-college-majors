8706539,2,B00UGQJQLC,"Movie opens with a wife murdered in her bedroomby her drunken husband? Starts with a bang and then slows to a crawl. Way too much time spent on romantic subplots. Earl Holliman makes a mark in this film with a strong performance. Overall, though, this film is an example of a good book turned into a dull movie. Read the book; avoid the movie.",1468108800,,343,4.375
