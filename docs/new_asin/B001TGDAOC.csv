8341316,5,B001TGDAOC,"I started using this set last February and cannot say enough good things about these workouts as I have seen results and toning in places that never seemed to respond before.  Have always worked out and have always been slim and fit but this tightened up my inner thigh, waistline and upper arms like nothing I have used before. My thoughts were that this would be very intermediate as there isn't any jumping and leaping and thrusting and so it would be for days when I was too tired for turbo jam etc.,  Well let me tell you, I was in a puddle of sweat on the floor after doing these and after one month I have seen results that I have never been able to achieve before.  The workouts are mellow and graceful that are done barefoot to the most different but neat mindful music that really suits the integration of pilates, yoga and ballet moves. I feel so graceful and calm and am not beating myself up and then feeling that I need to lie down after these exercises yet it is tough! I highly recommend Ellen Barrat and her wonderfully pleasant personality.  Buy it!",1334966400,,1067,4.401015228426396
