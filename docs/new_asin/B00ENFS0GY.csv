5928296,5,B00ENFS0GY,"While the editing together of the two episodes wasn't as smooth as I'd have liked, this Blu-ray is still highly recommended for all Trekkies.

The episodes themselves look great in HD and I constantly find myself noticing the little details on the costumes, props and the work done with the lighting.  I think it's great that the folks who worked so hard behind-the-scenes for this show can finally receive more recognition for their work!  Standard definition doesn't do this show justice!

The included documentary has a few nice moments spread throughout and features several of the cast and crew.

I particularly enjoyed the audio commentary which features Jeri Taylor alongside Michael and Denise Okuda.  The Okudas bring their encyclopedic knowledge of Trek while Taylor tells us her history in Hollywood, how she came to Star Trek, and of course some of her memories writing Unification.

The packaging for this Blu-ray is distinctive (you can see the neat cover design with Spock and Picard) as well as a surprise outer case that opens out into a large spread featuring the characters from the episode as well as that gorgeous new shot of the Enterprise from the  Zakdorn Surplus Depot (see my customer image for a look!)

Some folks are irritated by CBS putting out these separate releases with unique content but I don't mind.  At least CBS makes these releases WORTHWHILE with the bonus content (back in the dark times of Paramount shoveling out cheap garbage, this release would've cost the same and probably included nothing but the episodes and SD previews).  Besides, it's a good way for Trek fans to enjoy some of the big moments in Trek without having to invest the money for the complete collection.  These little releases also have good potential as stocking stuffers to introduce people to TNG!

I wouldn't recommend buying at full list price but there are numerous opportunities for getting the Blu-ray at a discount.  Keep your eyes out!",1385596800,17,1959,4.951070336391437
5928297,5,B00ENFS0GY,"this is my third buy of the married two part episodes....I know it's being used by Paramount as a cash cow but I still like them....sitting down and watching it like a mini-movie instead of broken into two parts (watching end credits and then needing to click into the next part or have to change the disc all together)....the episodes flow better...no real magic to it....they just reformatted the credits and did a simple cut and paste to marry them...I hope that Paramount puts the rest of the two part episodes out....for a prospective buyer...no it is not a ""have to buy""....you'll get them as you buy the seasons...but I enjoy them....the audio/picture looks great....",1385510400,,674,4.869565217391305

Otherwise, I would have given this a full 5 stars.",1384992000,6,271,4.42
5928300,4,B00ENFS0GY,I am glad CBS chose to edit this like the season finales. I do however miss the Time Arrow edit and am hoping they continue with Descent when season 6 is released. For a trekker it's worth the triple dip (I owned the DVDs too) for the very nice slipcase packaging and the extra making of and commentary track. The making of is 16 minutes for those wondering.,1384992000,,358,4.279411764705882
5928301,5,B00ENFS0GY,"""Unification"" was not the two-part Next Generation episode I expected to follow ""Redemption.""  I assumed - and I think a lot of others did as well - CBS-D would continue to release the cliffhanger two-parters as standalone releases.  When Season Five was announced I fully expected the standalone release to be ""Time's Arrow.""  ""Unification"" makes sense, though.  Not only does it feature Leonard Nimoy - on the heels of his cameo in Star Trek Into Darkness - it also features the late, great Mark Lenard.

Just like ""Best of Both Worlds"" and ""Redemption,"" ""Unification"" features the original episodic promos and a documentary titled 'From One Generation to the Next.'  There's also a deleted scene and audio commentary.  The 30-minute documentary features commentary Patrick Stewart, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn, Denise Crosby, Rick Berman and the Okudas to name a few.  ""Unification"" also marks the final appearance of Denise Crosby's character, Sela, which I thought was a bit of a waste.

As with previous releases the HD upscale is fantastic, both in audio and video quality.",1384905600,3,1081,5.166666666666667

5928303,5,B00ENFS0GY,"Unfortunately, many hardcore fans seem to think that every piece of merchandising is marketed to them.  This is a great introduction to TNG for any fans of the JJ Abrams' Star Trek movies.  If you are a hardcore fan, then buy the full season.  It's pretty simple when you think of it like that, isn't it?",1384732800,4,304,4.392857142857143
5928304,4,B00ENFS0GY,"CBS DVD and Paramount take the release of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation: Season Five"" on Blu-ray as the perfect opportunity to give fans another two-episode arc seamlessly joined together as a full-length film. ""Star Trek: The Next Generation: Unification"" serves as a companion piece to 1991's ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country."" It's another example of the old cast from the original series joining the new crew (at the time) for some cross-promotion of each other.

The Federation calls in Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the crew of the Enterprise to locate a defecting ambassador they've traced to Romulus. It sounds like just another mission, until it's revealed the defector is none other than Spock (Leonard Nimoy). With the help of the Klingons, Picard and Data go undercover as Romulans to uncover the respected Vulcan's motivations for defecting.

The audio and video quality for ""Star Trek: The Next Generation: Unification"" will please viewers. The picture is as clean and clear as we've ever seen it. New and improved visual effects help to give consumers who might already have these on DVD a reason to come back for more. The 7.1 surround sound places viewers right in the center of all the action.

There are a few special features included for ""Star Trek: The Next Generation: Unification."" Audio commentary is provided by Jeri Taylor and Mike and Denise Okuda. A behind-the-scenes retrospective on the episodes entitled ""From One Generation to the Next: The Making of 'Unification'"" includes interviews with the cast and crew. It also features a deleted scene and episodic promos for Parts 1 and 2.

Although I love ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" I have the same problem with the feature-length presentation of ""Unification"" as I did the entire series. There are more diplomatic discussions than action. I prefer the brawling and phaser-shooting of the original series to peace talks. ""Star Trek: The Next Generation: Unification"" is still an enjoyable peek at an important moment in Gene Rodenberry's space saga.",1384560000,13,2048,5.159638554216867
5928305,3,B00ENFS0GY,"Those following ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""'s release on Blu-ray should be familiar with CBS/Paramount's strategy of stand-alone releases alongside the excellent season collections.  ""The Best of Both Worlds"" was the first such stand-alone release, offering a seamless edit of the popular episode and a few exclusive extras.  ""Redemption"" followed suit: it wasn't as good of an episode, but the exclusive extras made it worth a look.

""Unification"", like ""Redemption"", is a fine two-part episode of ""TNG"" but falls short of the series' most enduring moments.  It's best remembered for the appearance of Leonard Nimoy as Spock, as well as the politically-charged story about peace negotiations between the Romulans and Vulcans.  There are some great character moments during this two-part episode, including a few excellent scenes showing the dynamics between Spock, Picard and Data.  As for the seamless edit, it works well this time around...even better than the edits of ""Best of Both Worlds"" and ""Redemption"", due to the format.  The extras include a full audio commentary, a short retrospective featurette, one deleted scene and the original episode promos.  It's not a bad collection of extras, but IMO they'd be better suited on the Season Five collection.

Which brings me to my summary: ""Unification"" is a decent two-part episode made ever-so-slightly better by this edit, but the exclusive extras (and the fact that both parts are already available on the Season Five collection) don't necessarily make it an essential release.  It honestly feels like more of a cheap cash grab, but die-hard ""TNG"" collectors may still want to pick it up on sale.

As a fan of the original cast, it's a lot of fun watching Nimoy/Spock interacting with Picard and Data but it was disappointing that he (Spock) didn't show up until the very end of part 1. There is also a wonderful moment reuniting a dying Sarek and Picard as he is ""searching"" for Spock. Mark Lenard is tremendous in those scenes. It's already common knowledge that the hi-def restoration of TNG was brilliantly done and the old school miniature work of the Enterprise-D cruising through an alien junk yard looks fantastic. This two part episode was made to help publicize the upcoming release of Star Trek VI.

5928315,5,B00ENFS0GY,"Unification was the episode that us Trek fans were eagerly waiting to see. Having the character of Spock join up with the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation was phenomenal. The script was well written, and the relationships fans wanted to see were there, including the delightful interplay between Spock and Data. I can say that for me, and most probably for many Trek fans out there, the airing of this 2 part event signaled that Star Trek: Next Generation had arrived. It was the absolute opposite of jumping the shark. Even after viewing this episode many times, I still watch it again and again. The acting is superb, the story, as I mentioned is first rate, and the connection between Trek series is everlasting as a result.

The blu ray treatment adds to the episode by giving the viewer top notch picture and sound. The merging of both parts into one presentation makes this event easy to obtain for everyone from casual fans to the die hards.",1407369600,2,954,4.644970414201183

5928320,4,B00ENFS0GY,"the episode looks great.. and its still a fun watch.. Although seeing it now so many years later I now realize that Spock was only in HALF of the actual episode.. He only appears for a single line at the very end of the first episode, or at the half way mark as this is actually both episodes stiched into a single one. That's not a bad thing, as the episode itself looks and sounds great. But I do think it weird considering I suppose my perception of when I watched the episode in the 90s (and have rarely seen it since). Still though if you don't want to collect the entire seasons this disc is a great way to collect some of the better stand alone episodes. I do hope for season 7 they give the same treatment to the finale, All Good Things.. which still stands in my mind as bar none fhe BEST TNG Trek film.",1391644800,,812,4.113207547169812
5928321,3,B00ENFS0GY,I was disappointed in that I expected more of the picture and sound. An interesting episode but not something Id consider as the best of ST:NG.,1389398400,,143,4.538461538461538
5928322,4,B00ENFS0GY,"""I'm looking for Ambassador Spock.""
""Indeed. You have found him, Captain Picard.""

That exchange remains one of the most exciting moments in the entire Star Trek canon. I can't even be sure the last time I saw either part of ""Unification"", but it thrilled me as an adolescent. I read the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novelization/dp/067177056X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novelization</a>&nbsp;penned by Jeri Taylor (who wrote the Part I teleplay). I bought the TNG&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volume-Three/dp/B000001P17/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Volume Three</a>&nbsp;CD, featuring a suite of Dennis McCarthy's music from the two episodes. I was thrilled when Playmates added an Ambassador Spock action figure to their lineup, and when he appeared in Decipher's Star Trek CCG. In short, I've been borderline obsessed with ""Unification"" for 22+ years.

At present, the full season sets on Blu-ray are outside my limited entertainment budget, but I was kindly given some Amazon credit by a friend and splurged on this release. I know I'm behind the times, but this was my first TNG in HD (outside of the movies) and I was quite impressed with the A/V quality. I was captivated just taking in the richness of the textures of costumes and sets. The lone exception is that the Vulcan ear points on Mark Lenard are embarrassingly off-color from the actor's own skin tone. I never noticed it in SD, but it's distracting here. His scene with Patrick Stewart is so poignant and heartrending, though, that I feel guilty even remarking on such a trivial thing. It remains one of the most affecting scenes in the series.

As for the bonus content, I confess to being disappointed. Though I didn't expect anything particularly revelatory, there isn't much here that adds to the appreciation of the featured episodes. Also, CBS decided not to include an UltraViolet Digital Copy for this title, as they had done with the similar standalone Blu-ray releases for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-Both-Worlds/dp/B00BAXTY8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Best of Both Worlds""</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Redemption/dp/B00CLA3Y2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Redemption""</a>.

Commentary by Jeri Taylor and Mike & Denise Okuda ***
This one is a mixed bag. When Jeri Taylor shares anecdotes from either ""Unification"" or Star Trek at large, she's engaging and interesting. The highlight for me was hearing Taylor acknowledge that Sarek's reference to Spock going off into the mountains was, in fact, a direct reference to ""Yesteryear"", an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-animated-series/dp/B000HEWEJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the animated series</a>. The Okudas, however, interject with remarks and questions more along the lines of minutiae. It comes off as a Q&A conducted on a fan made podcast. Since Taylor doesn't appear in the lone making-of featurette, though, it's your only chance to hear her reminisces.

From One Generation to the Next: The Making of ""Unification"" (16:43) ***
In fairness to the producers, it's difficult to make a making-of featurette without any of the key principles participating. Jeri Taylor only recorded the commentary, Michael Piller (who wrote the second half) passed away several years ago, as did actor Mark Lenard, and apparently, Leonard Nimoy passed outright on anything to do with this release. Instead, we hear more about the road that led from the original series through the TNG episode&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sarek/dp/B00FEG9ODY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Sarek""</a>&nbsp;to ""Unification"" - which, thankfully, is actually relevant and interesting, even if it feels off-topic.

Deleted Scene (1:43) ***
This one kind of baffles me. It's a throwaway scene, to be sure, but it's clearly completed, rather than rough footage that was jettisoned early. I can understand excising it from the broadcast episode, but it seems to me that this single cut Blu-ray would have been an appropriate place to reinsert it as originally planned, though of course, no one asked me.

Episodic Promo: ""Unification I"" (0:34) ***
Episodic Promo: ""Unification II"" (0:34) ***
Pretty basic TV promos, but that second one, touting ""one man sacrifices his life"" is entirely and unnecessarily misleading.

Conclusion
Though the bonus content is generic and the second half of the story - the part that actually includes Nimoy as Spock - feels rushed and anticlimactic, the first half is genuinely terrific. ""Unification"" has taken on a new place in the context of the franchise in the wake of the last two movies. I can't in all honesty call this a mandatory purchase for Trekkers with the money to buy the TNG&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-Five/dp/B00ENFS0F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season Five</a>&nbsp;Blu-ray set, but for me...I have no regrets.",1388793600,2,5122,6.194092827004219
5928323,4,B00ENFS0GY,"As a devout fan of the Original Series, I was filled with excitement when this episode was first aired.  That being said, I was a little disappointed when Spock didn't show up until the end of the 1st hour, and the episode ended as a cliffhanger.  Here of course, both parts one and two are combined into one 90 minute story.  There is a lot to like in this episode:  Picard's scene with Sarek, who is suffering from the Vulcan equivalent of dementia, is very touching.  Spock and Data's conversations about the nature of humanity are very good too.  There is a good subplot of Riker in command of the Enterprise trying to do some detective work.  And Data and Picard with Romulan ears is interesting as well.  Sela makes and appearance, and I have never been fond of that character--just seemed to far fetched for me.  This is a good TNG story--some criticize it for ""not enough action,"" but you've got to remember that this was filmed on a TV budget.  Overall the picture and sound are of good quality.  And I like the novel packaging of these two-parter DVDs, which opens to depict a scene.

I love em. And I love the full movie-like experience. And the quality of sound and visual is rich and satisfying.

The docs are great and in old all cast members, which is rare even in some huge movies, and the commentary tracks, which I rarely get excited enough to even try, are so enveloping and informative, they give a deeper level of enjoyment. I can't believe these were made and with such care--so luckily they did so just before the bottom dropped out of the physical media industry.
These extras, if you didn't know, are NOT included on the season blu-rays or the complete box set. The makers were given more budget to do more (thankfully) when the studio decided to make these 2-part episodes available as stand-alone movies with the ep's edited together. .
