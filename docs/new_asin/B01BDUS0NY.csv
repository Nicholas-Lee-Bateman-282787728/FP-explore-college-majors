7626627,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Deadpool wins. Hands down this was the funnest movie I have ever seen in theatres. Preordered it before I even got out the door. If you love Deadpool, you'll love this movie.",1455235200,3,174,4.46875

The Good:
From the very beginning of its opening credits all the way to even its ending credits, Deadpool doesn't hold back with a flurry of comedic jabs. There are so many funny punch lines that you may miss because you'll be too busy laughing. As many fans already expected, Ryan Reynolds was made for this role and it showed greatly. His wit, charm and humor were on full display throughout.

The supporting characters in this film also do a wonderful job sustaining the movie, and not leaving the burden of keeping you laughing only on Reynolds. Ed Skrein (plays ""Ajax"") plays a great villain that compliments Deadpool's character very well. Gina Carano was finally utilized properly as an imposing figure in her role. Even the character of Colossus was finally done in a proper way that will make you enjoy the character opposed to his previous portrayals in other X-Men appearances.

The action scenes were also a great highlight to this film. Given the rated R rating, the violence was not held back in its gruesome form. Even better, while some of the scenes were really intense and fast paced, director Tim Miller was wise enough to slow them down so that the audience could fully absorb what they were seeing. In other words, it wasn't a bunch of blurry action scenes like in Man of Steel.

One last minor note, the love angle was done in a very genuine way. Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin (plays ""Vanessa"") shared some great on-screen chemistry. While romances in comic book films usually don't help the movie progress, this one succeeded in my opinion. It was done in such a way that you really do end up rooting for the couple's success.

The Bad:
I think that any ""critic"" that attempts to find something wrong with this film is just unnecessarily nitpicking. The ONLY thing that MAY be considered ""bad"" is the constant references that lead into being inside jokes within the movie. Due to Deadpool's consistent breaking of the ""4th wall"", there are many jokes that may go over some people's head if they are unfamiliar with the former X-Men movies, Ryan Reynold's past movies (Green Lantern or X-Men Origins: Wolverine), or even the media criticism that has surrounded this film and the actors before. I can't hold that against this movie though so you can make of that what you wish.

The Reason:
Fellow Nerds and Geeks REJOICE! This is what every adult comic book fan has been waiting for! We finally have another perfect comic book movie! The same way The Avengers broke the mold by introducing multiple heroes on one screen, or how Captain America 2 placed superheroes in a different movie genre, Deadpool is now a game changer in the comic book world. The R rating opened up so many more opportunities for this film in regards to the violent action, humor and originality. In other words, the R rating gives Deadpool a unique advantage that former comic book movies could never obtain.

This was probably a combination of The Hangover + The Punisher.  By the way, this is in no way shape or form suitable for a young audience. This movie is very ""adult"" in every sense of the term. I strongly urge you all to steer away from any internet talk about this film. There a lot of surprises in the film that you'll enjoy. There are also TWO end credit scenes so feel free to stay to the end to catch it. Don't be cheap, go watch this film. It deserves every penny spent, because after watching it, you'll want to see more like this. As of right now, Deadpool just kicked off 2016 as the best movie going and its putting a lot of pressure on upcoming films like Batman V Superman and Marvel's Civil War.

The Rating: 10/10

7626629,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Just saw this in theaters, movie of the year!  I am going to say all movies this year are going to be hardpressed to beat this!!!",1455235200,3,129,3.9615384615384617
7626630,5,B01BDUS0NY,"None of us ever really thought it would happen, but Deadpool did get his own movie, and it is everything you'd expect it to be. Now, while that's going to be great news for fans of the character, for casual viewers... maybe not so much.

It's all here: breaking the fourth wall, a comic-faithful costume complete with expressive mask, insanely violent, quips galore, more pop culture references than you can shake a chimichanga at. Deadpool knows what its audience wants and it delivers - and then some. The thing is, if you're not prepared for the endless onslaught of gross-out gags, gratuitous nudity and at times quite sickening gore, you may grow tired of it pretty quickly.

I was, though, and I bloody loved it.

Sure, the movie is a tad obnoxious at times and it definitely goes out of its way to offend at every given opportunity, but there's one crucial factor that makes it all work where similarly juvenile fare will always fail: it's funny... like, really damn funny. We're talking an average of at least 2 giggles, chortles, or full-on guffaws every 5 minutes or so - and our leading man is to thank for pretty much all of it.

Mouse over video for audio cannot load player configRyan Reynolds was born to play this role (properly), and while watching him in action you'd have to imagine that if it was anyone else under the mask that it just wouldn't have worked nearly as well. He brings the laughs, but also some pathos and humanity to a character that, on paper at least, can be difficult to like. He also has great chemistry with his supporting cast, particularly - and most importantly - Morena Baccarin's Vanessa, who while somewhat underutilized does shines with what she has to work with. T.J. Miller also gets his share of chuckles as Wade's equally profane pal Weasel, and the token mutants (Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead) are good fun too - even if they are really only there to connect this to the wider X-universe.

The most pleasant surprise is probably Ed Skrein as Ajax. He's not exactly what you'd call a well rounded villain, but he does a great job of making you hate him and sometimes that's enough.

The only real problem is the story. For a movie that clearly wants to push the envelope and take more chances than any other CBM that came before, it really does stick to the tried and tested formula. To be fair, it employs a very effective narrative structure that works brilliantly with Wade's penchant for chatting to the audience, but in terms of the actual plot, it's by the numbers all the way. It's not a deal breaker because everything else is so on point, but it would have been nice to see them try something different in that regard.

Deadpool is a sexy, hilarious blood-soaked blast from start to finish. It definitely won't be to everyone's taste, but if you're prepared to leave your PC hat at home and just go along with the mayhem on display you're bound to have fun. It's a little disappointing that more risks weren't taken with certain elements other than the obvious, but hey, there's always the sequel. So see this, then see it again - just don't bring your mother.

7626631,5,B01BDUS0NY,I saw this movie last night and I laughed my head off. Deadpool is the funniest super hero movie I have ever seen. I just cant wait to see the sequel.,1455235200,6,150,3.870967741935484
7626632,5,B01BDUS0NY,"I went with my two buddies to the 7:00pm showing last night, and it was amazing. We didn't get any Chimichanga's beforehand, but we did polish off a few Mike's Harder Lemonade's with Deadpool on the can in preparation. Everything about this film is exactly what you want for a movie theater experience, great action, lots of humor, gore, sexy time stuff, Deadpool is top notch. Ryan Reynolds is better than ever, T.J. Miller almost isn't even needed as Weasel the comic relief, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus were great together, the villains Ajax and Angel worked as 2 dimensional villains and something for Mr. Pool to verbally spar with. We went into the theater knowing a decent amount about Deadpool and having read a bunch of the Daniel Way and Brian Posehn runs I knew I was gonna like this film, I just didn't know how hard I was going to love it. We all loved it, in the theater, laughter was lingering throughout the whole runtime, even into the credits (there's an end credit tag scene so stay through all the credits).

What's my favorite scene you ask? Hmm... Zamboni!! I also enjoyed the montage scenes, and the meta humor was great (tons of great disses on 20th Century Fox, Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds himself). A lot of my favorite scenes took place on the freeway (bullet countdown was awesome), but I also really liked the love story parts as well, but my favorite scene is probably when Wade has to wait for his hand to grow back and has a weird baby hand, so damn funny! For a first time director of a feature film, Tim Miller knocked this out of the park. Really, everyone did. You could just tell this was a film that everyone working on it loves the character of Deadpool. This was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time, and the action was great and there's plenty of it. Also, boobs, and profanity... ooh! Even if you're not a fan of comic books or comic book movies and you at least like action comedies, you're gonna love Deadpool. This isn't your run of the mill comic book movie, not another boring origin story (at least not told in the typically boring manner) and my new favorite comic book film (ok, well it's tied with Guardians of the Galaxy and the 1989 Batman), I think this is something tons of people are going to enjoy. You don't have to know anything about Deadpool walking into this, you'll know what it's all about in the first 5 minutes. Deadpool comes FULLY APPROVED.

I accidentally rented this movie, meaning to meaning to use a gift code. No where does it tell you that you have to click ""more purchase options"" to insert the code. I learned this after I purchased. I cancel the order. However, in a fresh screen all of a sudden it's telling me that it's too late to cancel because I've started watching or downloading when I haven't done either.
I'm resigned. I figure that since I rented it I might as well just watch it. Except I can't, because it isn't showing that I've rented it.

7626959,5,B01BDUS0NY,"I am not a fan of Superhero movies. Never even cared for the Super Hero thing as a kid (Westerns were my thing). I seriously debated on renting this movie, I don't like superhero movies but the reviews had me wondering if this might not be one I want to watch. I don't care what professional reviewers say, but the individuals who went to see the movie and reviewed were almost all positive. I knew the wife wasn't going to watch it so sitting home alone I decided to go ahead and rent it, laid the recliner back fully expecting to fall asleep like I did every other Superhero movie I took the kids to.

I didn't fall asleep, the opening scene on the bridge had me laughing so hard I had to stop the movie. If you think Superhero movies are stupid then this movie is for you because the Superhero in this movie thinks the same thing. I am definitely not a superhero fan but I loved this movie. It is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. No one needs to tell me if they think the movie isn't funny, humor is an individual state of mind and this movie made me laugh more than a few times.

The individual ""regular people"" who just went to the movies and reviewed it were absolutely right. I would have not watched Jack Reacher or John Wick if I had paid attention to the professional reviewers, they ""regular people"" who reviewed them were right on those movies too.

This is not some movie a nine year old would watch, lots of adult themes and situations. I have seen the first 15 or so minutes of the Batman, Superman, Transformers and others before falling asleep (You know they have recliners in movie theaters now) and someone has to take the kids to see the movies. But if you think Superhero movies are stupid, then this Superhero movie is for you.

Actually it is just a good funny Superhero movie, I think. Is this guy actually a Superhero? He knows he is in a movie. I think he is more like an Anti-Superhero.

Superhero fans may give this a lower rating than five stars, but I'm not a Superhero fan and am rating it for what it is, a good movie.",1531008000,,2072,4.248730964467005

I had some reservations when people told me this movie was great because it's the first Marvel superhero movie where the superhero has a dry, witty, scathing sense of humor, because that seemed so unlike the rest of their movies. There was nothing dry nor witty about the humor in this movie. It was just unimaginative. Everything in this movie, from the jokes to the bootleg Spiderman suit, was mediocre and unimaginative.

7627042,1,B01BDUS0NY,"Without spoiling the movie- it's essentially vengeance on the heterosexual, christian, conservative, second-amendment appreciating, white male.
The SJW's likely bid this up because it is extreme (over the top) violence against what they hate (us) and shows the anger, bigotry, and violence that the left believes in. There's only one positive- I'll give credit where due- there was some subtle ""messaging"" and I appreciate solving those things even though the ""message"" is meant to offend & make you feel like you don't deserve to live.

For context, I'm not a prude and can deal with subtle Hollywood programming- love all Tom Cruise movies, The Matrix, O'Brother where art thou, The Jerk, even Django Unchained was okay compared to this. I would have never paid for it but our son in law and daughter suggested it- so my wife and I somehow made it through without vomiting.

This was one of two atrocious delivery experiences with no resolution.  The comment about delivery to a neighbor is especially disturbing.  I have never approved that and neighbors say it did not happen. Please email me a link that I can use to send this this to the appropriate department. Your delivery system seriously needs some correction in fixing delivery issues.  Purchases either come as expected which is truly wonderful systems or become a nightmarish series of screw ups that customers find way too difficult time consuming and demeaning to try and correct.  Seriously, canceling the sale and repurchasing is probably the best solution.  Obviously this again  will not be posted here but this time can you send a real link to where I can send it.
p

I did though have to make many repeat time consuming contacts by text and phone to different departments at Amazon to get it delivered. Most orders to me have been no problem and a number of people use Amazon in my complex so I can not explain why this and my carpet shampooer took so many times to straighten out but these two other were ridiculously difficult and time consuming. The order contained my gate code and phone yet again and again it was delayed because of ""not able to enter gate, no gate code, no such address"". The no such address really floored me because I am not the only Prime member in the complex and have had other prior deliveries. At no time did anyone call me even though I included my phone number. Also it is easy to contact me at the gate call box even with out the code by using my name it will call my cell.

No one seemed to be responsible or interested in finding a real fix to avoid this in the future. To cap it all off after I found it on my door step the delivery record said that it was left with a neighbor, definitely not a choice I gave and is something that my neighbors said did not actually happen.",1528329600,,2019,4.405913978494624

7627197,5,B01BDUS0NY,"There are very few duds. Some dialogue is so fast you haven't recovered from the last laugh to catch the next one. Although the story arc is incredibly rote (what stories on this earth are innovative anymore?), the fleshing out of the story is wonderfully done and despite the low budget (relatively speaking) the scenes are well done and entertaining. Both Miller and Reynolds have one or two flubs but these are minor and generally bookended by otherwise great interactions.

My complaint is that I wanted more. More scenes in general, more scenes and dialogue for Morena Baccarin, more verbal sparring between Reynolds and TJ Miller.

This is all despite Ed Skrein's incredibly flat character (the acting was just fine, it was a matter of the content with which he had to operate) and the most traditional of traditional story lines. I'm likewise hoping Carano gets future opportunity to DO something with the forgettable Angel Dust character (again, due to no fault of Carano's). But these criticisms all stem from essentially the same thing: more time and to some extent more budget to fill in these plot elements (or not, in Ajax, which is fine too).

7627212,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Definitely a great Marvel film! I love the opening credits (thanks to Monty Python for starting bizarre film credits!) and Ryan Reynolds is fabulous as Deadpool. He has a great sense of humor, as he always has. He can be a great dramatic actor as well. I'm sure others have given away the plot, ending, etc., and I hate that that happened, however, life goes on. I noticed on this viewing (10th or 11th time) the end credit for producers and was pleased to see Lauren Schuler Donner and The Donners' Company (which invariably includes her producer/director husband Richard Donner, most remembered for the ""Lethal Weapon"" films) and any input they had to it. But, BE WARNED - it's R-rated! This film is NOT for children - it's NOT that kind of superhero film, even though it IS based on a Marvel comic character (who was pretty raunchy in the comics). There is truly bad language, sex, extreme violence and more. Come to think of it, if you cannot, as someone else said, put yourself outside of the box and just watch the film for the entertainment factor, then you should likely not see it.

7627237,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Deadpool is possibly my favorite comic book movie. It's at the very least in the Top Five. Infinity Wars was pretty epic, but didn't quite have the humor and certainly none of the 4th Wall breaking that Deadpool has in spades. I've seen it four times now and I thought the humor might get old, but it never does. I always catch little pop-culture and Marvel references and details I missed in previous viewings. It helps to be a comic book geek to get the most out of this movie, but it isn't required.

If for some reason you've not seen this movie yet, I won't spoil it for you. Just go in realizing that there is dark humor, profanity, sexuality and a over-the-top graphic, action violence. If you're cool with that, enjoy the ride. Try and watch it before catching Deadpool 2, which I hear ups the ante even more. BTW, the quality of the Prime Video stream is top-notch, and I had no hiccups watching it via Wi-Fi on TV or on my desktop.

But back to Deadpool.

Reynolds is terrific. In fact, I'm not sure any other actor could pull it off. There's something about taking one of the top leading men of Hollywood and turning him ugly while making him a superhero with humor. It works flawlessly, and that's all Reynolds.

The supporting cast is good. The action loud. The jokes (for the most part) funny. The opening credits the most honest ever.

7627256,3,B01BDUS0NY,"Until Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool) mutates into the burn-victim look-alike, physically regenerative, superhero (who, nevertheless can not regenerate healthy looking skin) there is a lot of male eye candy for those so interested---nothing terribly frontal,sadly, he almost always has a lumpy sweater on, but lots of male eye candy just the same.  Then, he morphs and has to wear the suit.  At this point his gay voice takes over---apparently straight, married, and with children, Reynolds still has a great gay voice (here) which goes on and on and on as the babbling, can't stop talking, narrator for a character who isn't exactly tight with words himself, at least before the mask---to the annoyance to those who are trying to kill him.  And sometimes to the annoyance of the viewer.

The question is, IS Deadpool supposed to be gay?  In other films Reynold's is in I've never seen him in the mile-a-minute-motormouth mode, and he doesn't come across as particularly gay on or off screen, even as one might have said of Jack Benny for example.  So is this characterization meant to convey a gay Super Hero, or is the gay sounding patter not meant to be gay sounding?

A minor consideration, other than for the fact it's near constant.

The film is gory in the extreme.  People don't just get whacked, they get whacked and as they do they spew, spurt, gush, and spin off bloody bits and pieces.

Over all, in an era when every third movie is a Super Hero movie, I'm well over the form and this one did little to restore my enthusiasm.  Then again, the twisted history within ""Wonder Woman"" didn't do much to that end either.  I'm just not a Super Hero fan, and this to me is not that funny (one of the selling points I heard) or all that entertaining, even with all that near nudity on Reynold's part.

When the protagonist, Wade Wilson, gets ill, someone makes him an offer he cant refuse, leading to one of the wildest movies and action characters this side of Wolverine and Mystique. The movie even starts out in the middle of a wild-action sequence that is frozen in time and then ups the ante throughout the movie to even wilder set pieces and action as Deadpool keeps up the humorous banter throughout. Full of profanity, gore, and irreverence, Deadpool takes the viewer on a non-stop trip full of twists and turns. Starring Ryan Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, T.J. Miller, Ed Skrein, Stefan Kapicic, Brianna Hildebrand, Jed Rees, Karan Soni, Leslie Uggams, Gina Carano, and more.  Directed by Tim Miller. Very Definitely Recommended. Four VIOLENT Stars.

Of course its not gonna be suitable for 7 year old Kayden. And might not be suitable for you if you don't like, well... fun, i guess.

Anyways, this is one of the best movies ever, period. Not even on a superhero level - it's just fantastic in its own right. Fight sequences, hilariously raunchy script, great character development, it doesn't get much better than this folks.",1526860800,,552,4.52

Remember, Marvel started out family-friendly, but somewhere along the line, it got twisted (like everything else, right?).  Can't blame human minds for that, honestly.  I enjoyed the movie for its humor, but in my heart, I know this isn't what the Marvel universe is all about.  Deadpool clearly caters to a select, corrupt segment of society, and if you're part of it, then this movie is definitely for you.",1526774400,,521,4.820224719101123

7627495,4,B01BDUS0NY,I have a lot of Marvel movies and thought I'd add Deadpool to my collection. I like movies that show how the character became who they are. I also liked the humor.,1521331200,,163,4.125
7627496,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Deadpool is vulgar, coarse, and littered with bad language. It's also wonderfully funny. I usually find vulgar films filled with bad language distinctly un-funny. Somehow this film walks the very fine line between going too far and going just far enough.

Ryan Reynolds' performance as Deadpool is superb (his performance as Green Lantern was poor - this is the super-hero he was born to play). He is a man tortured by the conviction that he cannot force his ugliness upon the love of his life (played beautifully by Morena Boccarin). He breaks the fourth wall often and gleefully. So do the filmmakers - even the opening credits are funny!

This movie would have been a massive disappointment had they tried to make it (like most super-hero movies) in PG or PG-13 - it demands an R, and they delivered exactly that.

There are stretches of this film which work so much better in 4k than in Bluray or DVD - the sequence counting down 12 bullets, for example - the numbers on the shell casings are crystal clear. This is demo-disc quality, showing off why you've invested in 4k TV and player.",1521331200,,1091,4.671875

I spend a good hour scrolling through hilarious 1 star ratings, and y'all, this movie is made for adults. It's rated for adults. It even says it's for adults. Not kiddos. If you, an ADULT, have a dark sense of humor and don't mind a few tatas, this is a awesome super hero movie.

Ryan Reynolds is probably the only actor for the job, and the supporting cast is great as well.

Hey, Hugh Jackman, enough said.  I finally broke down last night to watch this one. I figured why not, because at least I was a bit familiar with Wade Wilson from the Xmen Origins: Wolverine.  Man, am I kicking myself for not watching it sooner....it was fantastic!  This may not be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you don't like swearing, sex talk/jokes, etc.  Fortunately for me, it is my cup of tea!  Now, just like I can't picture anyone but Hugh playing Wolverine, I can't picture anyone else playing Deadpool.  Ryan Reynolds was perfect!  The way this movie was done, with the writers and actors (especially Ryan), it all came together perfectly!  I love the humor in this movie...it was refreshing to laugh so much during an action movie.  And watching it a second time today, I finally caught on to the Ferris Bueller-ness during the movie (not just the end).  Which, by the way, make sure to watch after the credits.

I guess it is still too new for Netflix. Well it was worth the 3.99, because I absolutely loved it. I am not sure how to describe it, but it was a love story, action movie, super hero comic book style movie. I normally don't like the movies that do a lot of flash backs during it to describe the what and why of the moment but this movie was so interesting that it didn't even bother me. This is definitely a movie to watch and I will watch it again and I will definitely buy a movie again, as it is way cheaper than going to the theater and I could lounge in my pjs while watching it.",1518912000,,775,3.9615384615384617

The tone of the movie was all over the place and the ""jokes"" came so hard and fast I had to turn on closed captions to make sure I wasn't missing anything. With the rapid-fire delivery of lines and changes in tone, I didn't have time to suspend disbelief long enough to decide whether or not a joke was funny. The timing was all wrong.

In short, this movie is a complete mess. It is at war with itself in both tone and substance. Why anyone would find it funny or entertaining is beyond me. Maybe I need a shorter attention span.",1517875200,4,688,4.251908396946565

The story line was barely there, and the whole time I was watching the movie I kept thinking, but everyone said this movie was so great, maybe Ill give it some more time. Nope.

7627670,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Deadpool is the latest comic book movie in an industry over-saturated with comic book movies. And it knows it. The movies self awareness is one of the strongest elements of the film from a first time director, and theres a lot to love about Deadpool. Yeah, I loved it. Its not the best movie ever made, but its the most fun Ive had in the theater since Ant-Man. So, whats so great about it? Ill discuss below, with some light spoilers. Nothing major.

Pros

  The Comedy. This movie had me laughing within the first 30 seconds of the film, and kept me in stitches the entire run time. Its funnier than most comedies. The humor comes mostly from Deadpool himself, but TJ Miller, who plays Deadpools best friend, probably has my favorite line in the movie. I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen it, but if you have, its starts with, Id come with you Deadpool is a self aware character who constantly breaks the fourth wall. The movie had to reflect that, and it did in spades.
  The Action. Its not just funny, its exciting. The action is top notch and there are real stakes, unlike some comic movies. The R-rating allows the movie to show fighting in very explicit and creative ways. Its bloody, but not gruesome. Think Kick Ass or Kingsman.
  The love story. Too often in comic books and comic book movies, the female love interest is bland and interchangeable with any other. Not in Deadpool. Morena Baccarin plays the love interest perfectly, and you really believe these two people are in love, and you can understand why. If the love interest didn't work, the movies finale would feel empty. Luckily, it rings true.
  The Pacing. At the end of the day, Deadpool is a basic origin story. Again, the movie is self aware. This opens the possibility of creative editing choices, which are used. Flashbacks and fourth wall breaks fill in the gaps to explain where Deadpool came from, and it keeps the movie moving along at an exciting pace. As someone who is not too familiar with the character, I found the movies explanation of Deadpools origin to be very easy to follow and very entertaining at the same time.
  The casting. Two words: Ryan Reynolds. Hes never been better. To a large extent, the success of Deadpool rests of his performance, which is fantastic. Deadpool is a wise ass, and Ryan Reynolds is a wise ass. I don't know who could have played Deadpool any better; the casting was perfect. The fact that he played Deadpool before in the terrible X-Men Origins: Wolverine also opens up a lot of comedic possibilities, which were thankfully exploited. The rest of the cast was top notch as well. I already mentioned Morena Baccarin, but credit is also due to the villain played by Ed Skrein (of Game of Thrones).

Cons

This was another movie that was difficult for me to come up with the cons. However, I did think of some. No movie is perfect.

  The trailer. Its not a bad trailer, but it ruins a lot of the best jokes. However, as a piece of marketing, its perfect. I just turned this into a pro, didn't I?
  The bad guys. With the exception of Skreins Francis, the bad guys were a little underdeveloped. I wouldve liked to have seen more of Gina Caranos character and more of Agent Smith. Also, the terrorist character at the beginning of the movie is kind of forgotten after his one scene. Maybe hell show up in the sequel: Deadpool 2: Electric Boogaloo.
  The final fight. The final fight is a bit by-the-numbers. Why not use Deadpools tropes while hes fighting? I saw one commenter mention that hed love to see Deadpool beat a character with a boom mic grabbed from off-screen. Thats a great idea. I hope they use it in the sequel.

Final verdict: The highest praise I can give this movie is that it made me want to read the source material. I ordered a Deadpool comic on Amazon right after seeing the movie. (Get yours by clicking the link.) Deadpool is a lot of fun, as a comic book movie should be. It knows what it is, it knows what beats it needs to hit, and it does the job almost perfectly. Its just definitely NOT for kids.

7627695,1,B01BDUS0NY,"One of the Worst Movies Ever Made.
Ryan Reynolds has Forever solidified himself as the ""Tool"" of the 21st century.

The last few years, or so, he has done nothing but play a pretentious dirt-bag, and I have absolutely zero desire to ever see another of his movies, after this one.
He's completely unlikable, at this point, and I'm absolutely done with him.

The fact that there are so many full marks reviews for Deadpool is a despairing sign of what's going on in the minds of my male peers in the USA.
Today, if a movie is sarcastic, trashy, depraved, pornographic, and murderous, the average high-school, jock-minded, pot-smoking scumbag will rate it 5-stars, and tell everybody how AWESOME it was BRO.

It's disgraceful, and yes, that's really how I feel about it. (whew)
The movies being produced are getting worse and worse, by the year, and this was Legendary Trash.

Cannot wait for all the Marvel casted Losers to lose popularity, and be forgotten.
Ryan Reynolds being probably the worst of them.

Unfortunately, that's not gonna happen for a while, but at least they will space it a part, to some degree.
It's like, Middle-Schoolers have been handed Weapons of Mass Cultural Destruction, and we are all slowly being Obliterated by emergent the emergent millennial though process.
(scary stuff, run for the hills, the hipsters are among us)

P.S.
If you take pleasure in movies like this, you should really think about their substance, and ask yourself if you really wanna be the kind of person that delights in those things.

7627817,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Wade Wilson is wise-cracking antihero mercenary who discovers he has lung cancer. His only surefire treatment option is to be turned into an indestructible superhero by sadistic slave trader Francis Freeman. The process to become superhuman involves around-the-clock torture to wake up his mutated genes. Wade is cancer-free, but also has a hideous face that he believes will make his fianc want to break up with him. Now the newly christened Deadpool must track down Francis and force him to fix his disfigurement. Deadpool not only has superhuman strength, speed, and healing abilities, but an ass-load of guns and knives at his disposal. That and the help of X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

Deadpools one-liners and funny moments are easily the movies best features. Whether hes glad Francis is wearing brown pants or hes sarcastically offering to help Franciss balding henchman lure children into his windowless van, theres always a reason to laugh your ass off throughout the movie. Its impossible to list every zinger this movie has to offer, because my review would be longer than the first Game of Thrones book. Yes, this movie has its downer moments, the cancer diagnosis and torture scenes being among them. But even in the darkest, most depressing parts of the movie, theres another profanity-laced tirade around the corner. Whoever wrote the dialogue for this movie deserves a medal. And an Oscar. And the keys to the city. And a key to the playboy mansion. Andwhatever the hell he wants!

And because its a marvel superhero movie, it has to have a hefty amount of violence. But due to its R rating, theres a lot more freedom to splatter some blood everywhere. For example, Deadpool can spell out Franciss name using the dead carcasses of his soldiers. He can cut off one guys head with a sword and soccer kick it into another guys head. He can use one bullet to splatter three different guys heads at the same time. He can pull out all of the martial arts tricks he wants, including some that would make Jackie Chan crap his pants. Word to the wise: if you want to keep your bones and your blood where they belong, don't screw around with Deadpool. Dont kidnap his girlfriend, don't torture him, don't make his face look like a giant scrotum, and don't outclass him in his witty dialogue. Actually, its damn near impossible to do the last item on that list, but you get the point. Right?

The fact that Deadpool is a huge departure from regular Marvel movies is enough to earn an extra credit grade. Sure, any movie can be R-rated, but only Deadpool can make you laugh, cry, and giddy with deliciously violent excitement at the same time. And while you're watching, enjoy the strategically placed soundtracks of DMX and Wham on the same album. You might as well make a greatest hits CD with Skillet and Marilyn Manson on the same CD too. Or Rage Against the Machine and Ted Nugent. Orokay, thats enough for now. The point is, Deadpool has earned every one of its five stars and theres nothing anybody can do to take that happiness away from me. If you want to cry over the filthy language and sexual dialogue, Wade Wilson will be happy to drink your tears with a shot of rum. Congratulations, Deadpool, for being an overly awesome movie that exceeded expectations!",1508544000,,3292,4.7618213660245186

  This movie isn't for everyone. If you are one of those people who can NOT, in any way, abide so-called ""bad"" language and/or violence; nor can you tolerate ANY sexual references WHATSOEVER, then steer well clear of this movie! If, on the other hand, you aren't quite such a tighta$$, then you will probably find this movie to be VERY enjoyable (and, VERY funny)  with its sly, sadistic, send-up of pop culture in general (and comic book movies in particular). This one is definitely NOT for the kiddies, folks!

  Let's hope they DON'T screw up the sequel! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  See the other reviews on this page for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  2.39:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (31.2 Mbps)

  This movie's image features dazzling colors (as befits a comic book movie), sharply detailed objects, and very good apparent depth. It also has very good, to frequently excellent, contrast and has very good shadow detail (as seen in the many dark and shadowy areas, such as the bar scenes, the scenes in Wade's apartment, and the scenes located in Ajax's lab). Also, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations (probably because of the extensive use of CGI [which is an observation, and NOT a complaint]). Overall, this movie's presentation on blu-ray has very good, to frequently excellent, picture quality  and, should satisfy all but the very pickiest of viewers.

AUDIO:  DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 (48 KHz, 24-bit)

  While the sound quality of the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack for this disc is very good  it is NOT among the best examples of the art. Although dialog is clear and well placed, and the rear and side channels are somewhat active and fairly directional  still, it never gave me that deeply moving 'you-are-there' feeling that I frequently get when listening to movies that have what I consider to be reference-quality soundtracks (e.g.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Wick/dp/B00OV3VGP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Wick</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pacific-Rim/dp/B008JFUR10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pacific Rim</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-men-Days-Of-Future-Past/dp/B00K7IPGS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-men: Days Of Future Past</a>). Don't get me wrong: this soundtrack is very good, but it definitely could have been better!

7627858,5,B01BDUS0NY,"This super hero movie is one of the greatest ones. It's not traditional super hero for sure, but that's what makes it so special. I like the fact that it does not try to deal with current political or other events. It tells a story of an above average male who gets himself into a situation, which ends up magnifying his origianal personality.  All the pain did not change his positive thinking of whatever situation, fruity nor grim. All actors did really well, but dead pool, Ryan Reynolds did a super job as the Dead Pool Character - fantastic. I don't watch much movies multiple times - but this one I can watch over and over. NOTE: This movie is not for kids, not for people who can't take vulgar language, nor vilolent scenes, blood, gore, decapatation. People of strong personal beliefs against these things will not appreciate the fantastic master piece that it is; those individuals would  have to be able to step outside the box, forget about what is right or wrong, realize it's a movie, see it from a difrent dimension, and enjoy.",1506384000,17,1042,4.596774193548387

7627882,4,B01BDUS0NY,"My superhero experience was shaped back in the 60s and 70s by TV cartoons featuring A-list Marvel talent; Spiderman, Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, etc.  Im a lot older now and don't read comic books but have enjoyed most if not all the more recent blockbuster movies featuring the mainstream characters I just mentioned.  Much credit to Marvel Studios for their willingness to back feature length films starring lesser known heroes like Antman and The Guardians of the Galaxy which were terrific and lots of fun.  However, when I saw Deadpool it just seemed to me like Marvel was scraping the bottom of the barrel (which Mr. Pool would likely agree).  Well, having recently watched the film I have to admit I was just plain wrong, Deadpool was highly entertaining and Ryan Reynolds did a super job playing the irreverent hero.  Having come to the story with no prior knowledge of the character did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the movie.

  This is an origin tale and we meet a guy named Wade (Reynolds) who apparently works as some sort of mercenary thug for hire.  For the most part hes doing light weight stuff like scaring off a young womans dorky stalker for example.  Then he meets a girl (Morena Baccarin, best known for Firefly and Homeland), falls in love and looks forward to marriage.  But, after he gets a terminal cancer diagnosis hes offered an opportunity at gaining super powers from a shady recruiter and things don't go well from there.  After a torturous series of experiments hes horribly disfigured and left for dead.  Only, hes not dead and he does now have superpower.  The rest is essentially a revenge story as Wade/Pool tries to find the scumbag who ruined his looks and hopefully get himself returned to normal (whatever that is at this point).  Good news though, no more cancer!

  Theres a ton of action and lots of excellent exciting sequences that are guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Its nice after so many crowded ensemble shows like The Avengers where its hard to keep track of whos doing what to whom, you can easily follow whats happening in Deadpool. Viewers should note that theres some partial nudity, no shortage of profanity, and the humor is mostly of the adult variety so not a kid friendly flick.  Given its box office success its no surprise that a sequel is currently filming and if it does well this may mark a new Marvel franchise.  The X-Men keep trying to draft Deadpool to join their ranks and lets just say hes not enchanted at the prospect but who knows what will happen?",1505433600,,2557,4.662946428571429
7627883,5,B01BDUS0NY,"I loved everything about this movie.  I didn't know much of anything about the character Deadpool before watching this movie - except from watching X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

7627934,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Deadpool has been a Marvel comic-book fan favorite for over twenty years and after more than ten years of on-again, off-again development, this film is one of the top-grossing in the Marvel X-Men universe.  Because it is part of the X-Men universe films, it is decidedly not part of the MCU which means there are no references and appearances of characters from the massive ""Avengers"" storyline of the MCU.  But that does not take anything away from this film whatsoever. Ryan Reynolds had been pushing to have this film produced ever since he briefly appeared as an alternate version of Wade Wilson in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine.""  In that film, Wade Wilson is genetically altered to become Deadpool/Weapon XI, but a radically different version of the character featured in the comics and in this Deadpool film.

Even though this is the origin story of a Marvel comic book character, it is decidedly NOT a family film as it contains scenes of gratuitous violence and gore along with an abundance of adult language and situations.  This movie features much more humor than other Marvel productions, to the point that there is a joke in nearly every line of the script.  The visual effects are all high-quality and over the top at certain points.  The story is presented as flashback sequences for most of the film and is narrated by Deadpool himself.

This version of the film includes the 4K UHD disc, BD and UV digital copy.  (Note that the UV digital copy is not in 4K UHD but in 1080p HD.)  Deadpool is glorious in the 4K format and once you've seen a few films in 4K, HD will seem dated by comparison.  The packaging is standard fare for any 4K BD and includes no bonus items like booklets or collectibles inside.

If you're a Deadpool or Marvel fan or enjoy superhero films with tons of action and violence with plenty of humor added to the mix, I highly recommend this film.",1503187200,,1880,4.663636363636364

Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, has created a truly exceptional Anti-Hero, whose bad boy mouth constantly spouts irreverant taunts and threats toward his evil nemesis,  ""Francis"", played by British actor Ed Skrein, who gets as good as he gives.
 The crash and smash interplay between these two characters is fantastic, producing some of the bloodiest and best fight scenes I have ever seen. Definitely not for children, and probably shocking for many adults, the quirky, ribald, humor throughout the entire movie kept me howling with laughter from intro to end.

7627961,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Well I have to say that this movie is pretty good. Generally Marvel puts out some moral imbued cheese. This movie has some cheese too with the whole romance story aspect but the violence and cussing is really good stuff combined with the humor. I died laughing in both of the taxi scenes. This movie is not politically correct and it is rated R so please ignore reviews that whine and moan about that aspect of the movie, if you can't read the rated R rating you deserve to be annoyed. If you aren't some comic nerd and you just ran across this movie watch it and enjoy. Ryan Reynolds does a good job acting and this movie was a lot of fun. In conclusion if you aren't a marvel or dc expert and you find Batman annoying because rich guys don't really save the world......watch this...there is no world saving and no moral nonsense. Just some romantic cheese but hey you have to have something like that right? Enjoy Deadpool",1502236800,,924,4.409356725146199

Just because it's based on Marvel comics, though, does NOT mean this movie is for kids. It has gore, mindless violence, a ****-ton of profanity, and more dirty jokes than you can keep up with.

7628066,4,B01BDUS0NY,"i'm not sure why i never got into comic books. you'd think i would've because i've always enjoyed superheroes, but somehow the art-form said to of spawned them never quite clicked with me. the currently overriding result of this anomaly is that more and more superhero movies are serving as my introduction to a given character. i'm walking into it with a cleaner slate that that which i carried into the Spider-Man and X-Men films.
on this basis, i have to admit, i was highly, highly skeptical about this Deadpool fella. his costume looks like a rejected version of Spider-Man's, and his power is that, however severe the injury, his body will heal itself. couple that with his textbook bad attitude and, basically, he's Wolverine without the claws.
(before one of the devout fanboys sets out to correct me, let me say that i've since found out that the serum he was given was based on a sample of Wolverine's blood, so it's not such a lazy retread after all. the big question is, why doesn't the movie mention that?)
there's also the fact that i've gotten severely cynical about R-rated movies, particularly post-20th century R-rated movies. i'm not exactly in love with the Movie Rating System in general because, let's face it, it promotes the wrong value system. it teaches people to ignore the questions they should be asking - what is this film about? what is it trying to say and how well does it make it's point? how valid is said point? - and instead focus on the rankest class of incidental minutiae. it teaches that the matter of artistic merit is a disposable side issue, if not an outright myth.
there was a brief, decade-or-so window during which an R actually meant something. the best R-rated movies - Blazing Saddles, The Godfather, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Monty Python's Life Of Brian - are those which took advantage of the opportunity to delve into previously verboten territory, to literally break ground.
but alas, the novelty inevitably wore off, and the concept lost it's edge. somewhere around 1983, that R all but ceased to be about taking risks and has since only gotten more and more about Just Because We Can. seriously, i mean, what was the last film to get an R-rating for an integral element of the plot, something the same story couldn't of been told just as well without. i'm damned if i know, but i can safely say that, at this writing, it's at least 20 years old.
in other words, we've long since reached a point where the attitude behind it is little more than posturing. i don't necessarily find the things that result in a R-rating offensive in and of themselves, but i feel manipulated when, as is the case the overwhelming majority of the time, they serve no more substantial purpose than to attain said R. what's been the prime motivator of an R-rating for decades now, too much of a certain F-word, i find positively tiresome. if nothing else about a given film is working for me, an overdose of F-bombs feels like salt in the wound.
still, occasionally a film is so good that i can actually look beyond even that. This Is Spinal Tap, for instance, or A Fish Called Wanda. and, yes, Deadpool.
there's a certain pomposity to pretty much anything, and Deadpool is to the pomposity of superhero movies what ""Weird Al"" Yankovic is to that of pop music. it's need to puncture that self-importance throbs so hard it can't even wait for the opening credits to roll: starring ""God's Perfect Idiot"" and directed by ""An Overpaid Tool."" he follows Spider-Man's footsteps in narrating his movie, but takes it so far as not only to break the fourth wall, but gleefully quip about having broken the fourth wall.
in the tradition of Mad Magazine, he gets to acknowledge certain usually unaddressed logistical inconsistencies. observing that only two other X-Men are featured - Colossus (""A CGI Character"") and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (""A Moody Teen"") - he deduces that the producers couldn't afford any others. told he's being taken to answer to Professor X, he asks, ""McEvoy or Stewart? these timelines are so confusing.""
other elements manage to transcend the usual superhero formula as well. there's no threat to the existence of the world itself, so Deadpool is free to focus on his quest for revenge against Francis and/or Ajax (""A British Villain""). informed that he pretended to be dead in shame after his disfiguring injury, his girlfriend (""A Hot Chick"") slaps him silly before reassuring him. Colossus, attempting to serve as a mentor a' la Yoda or Gandalf, let's just say, ultimately fails to sway Deadpool. (i know that sounds wishy-washy, but it's the best i can do without resorting to ""spoilers."")
but there has to be more to it than that. the bottom line with any sort of film is whether you can root for the characters or not. whether you're watching, for instance, Star Wars or Spaceballs, you need to connect with the characters before it'll register with you. however much fun a film might make of traditional storytelling techniques, it's ultimately no less dependent upon them.
it must've been a particular challenge to root any accessible nobility into a character known as the Merc With A Mouth, but they pulled it off. for all his snark and issues with authority, Deadpool has a conscience and a heart, as well as a certain whimsical side. he likes to draw. his favorite band is Wham! (""Make It Big is the album where they earned the exclamation point."") he contracts cancer and sincerely worries about the effect his theoretically imminent death will have on his girlfriend.
Ryan Reynolds didn't surprise me as much as he seems to of the rest of the world. i didn't think Green Lantern was quite the mess The Consensus Of Opinion does. and i must say, even at the risk of being lynched, that i enjoyed X-Men Origins: Wolverine. though i must admit that, looking back, that film did do something less than justice to the Deadpool character. what i'm trying to say is, just because previous efforts along the same line don't pan out doesn't mean an actor doesn't have it in him. the material just has to gel with him.
and now the heavy question: just how R did it need to be rated?
the good news is that for the most part it doesn't abuse the privilege. it's violence, while certainly kicked up a notch or two, manages not to be gratuitous, and it's brief sexual situations manage to serve the story without titillating to the point of distraction. the film delivers both elements in exactly the dosage level circumstances dictate, then moves on.
still, i'm sure you can be a snarky iconoclast without resorting to certain language. Bryan Singer and Hugh Laurie proved that with House. nor, i think, did the humor have to be quite so consistently crude. take the early gag where he presents his girlfriend with an candy ring and proposes. she asks where he was hiding it, and we cutaway to see he's not wearing pants. a little of that sort of thing goes a long way.
but hey, what film doesn't have it's imperfections?
in fact, you know what? the ""little"" things bad movies are criticized for, good movies do just as often. for instance, not killing the villain at the early point when it would've been most practical (and probably easiest). after a bad movie we say, ""why didn't he kill just him then and spare everyone all this aggravation?"" after a good movie we say, ""if he'd killed him then, there'd be no movie."" and in both cases we mean it with the most absolute sincerity.
what is this film about? it's about the fact that we know superheroes are outlandish tall tales, and we love 'em anyway. hell, isn't that a significant part of their appeal?",1497830400,,7617,4.697830964846672

7628211,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Great movie.

The R rating is for nudity, a couple sex scenes and about a billion F bombs.

The sex scenes aren't too intense, but there are a few breast scenes, and the lead actors butt is shown a few times.

Too much to let my nearly teenage kid watch, so be forewarned.

Now the good,
without giving too much away,
expect a comic book movie to play out like one,
improbable outcomes of insane situations,
there's CG, there's dodging of bullets, super powers, bad guys, good guys,
and the star, who's not really either.
And theres as many laughs as there is action.

Lead character is a lovable nut that lives every day with a rock solid invincibility complex,
and a deranged sense of right and wrong.
all while dropping non stop one liners.

9 minutes into the movie and I had a new all time favorite comic book (anti?)hero.

Action was fast paced enough to make up for a basic ""get the bad guy"" comic book plot.

Story jumps back and forth between present time and flashbacks, but it was easy to follow if you were paying attention,
and helped advance the plot in an interesting way.

Recommended movie,
  ridiculously funny comic book story with decent enough acting that may even appeal to your own messed up concepts and invincibility complexes.",1492819200,10,1252,4.569506726457399

On a side note, this is NOT for children; Adults Only! The ads told people not to bring children to the movie and it has a hard R rating.
I can't believe all the negative reviews I have read because people:
One; don't pay attention to the ratings system, not only do they tell you what age/maturity is appropriate, they also tell you what the reasons are behind rating a movie or game what they rate it; and
Two; didn't listen to the ads that literally said ""This movie is not for children; Do not bring you children to see this movie!"" I mean come on people; don't give a great movie a bad review because you 're dumb.

Now since this was made I'd be excited to see a Lobo movie made but I am not sure people would be as accepting. But I digress. With Ryan Reynolds dying to play Deadpool for years he does not disappoint. But on the other hand the story kind of holds the movie back a tiny bit.

One down side not for the movie itself, but 4k UHD HDR market out there... still lag of content.

7628305,2,B01BDUS0NY,"It's sad commentary on the mindset of the audience that a movie can receive such high ratings based mainly on its leading man's ability to deliver crude jokes with good timing.

The character of Wade Wilson / Deadpool is pretty superficial.  He ""lost"" his fiance because his radical, tortuous cancer treatment left him looking ugly.  His motivation in finding Ajax was to recover his good looks.

Cancer is hard to think about, much less joke about, but maybe that's how some people deal with it.  The most realistic scene in this movie is when Wilson, after surviving his ""treatment"", walks a public street and begins noticing how people are looking at him.  They recoil, as if he's a monster.  If you've ever been close to someone who's really dying of cancer, you know how true this is.  They lose weight uncontrollably.  They are gaunt, thin, and unhealthy.  A close family member, dying of colon cancer, told me how people reacted when they saw him in public.  They recoiled from him; they looked away in horror, because he looked like a skeleton and it got worse every day.  When cancer patients deal with this, it's because they're so far gone; or undergoing treatment that truly is tortuous.  When they get close to the end, they can't eat, they can't drink, they can barely speak, barely walk, and barely have the energy to squeeze your hand.  Cancer patients don't walk out on their families or become super-powerful.  They either survive a very harsh series of treatment, or they die slowly and painfully.  Their families stay close, often quitting their jobs or taking an extended leave, in order to help keep up with their medications, spend nights in the hospital, help them into and out of bed, talk, listen, and eventually mourn their passing.

The movie deserves about a 6.5 or 7 out of ten, at best.  Why it's getting 8, 9, 10 star ratings is beyond me.  A movie that rates that high should be re-watchable, time and again, and I have no interest in re-watching this one.  I don't really expect a comic book adaptation to be poignantly or realistically deal with a topic like cancer.  It just uses cancer as an excuse to further the plot, and if you've outgrown explicit, crude jokes and cartoonish violence, there really isn't much to see here.",1490572800,,2263,4.707379134860051

The reviews are deceptive in that they are for the movie in other formats, not 4K UHD.  Disappointing.  Amazon promised me that they would give me a refund -- but didn't, only a partial refund.  Amazon also promised that they would address the fact that so many people can't play the UHD discs -- but again, it didn't.
Bringing the issue to Amazon's attention appears to have had no effect -- except that they have lowered the price to entice people to take the risk.  Extraordinarily cynical!",1490313600,8,669,4.571428571428571

I am getting tired of reboots,back story..Lets try one of these in the NOW..and let a comic or a one off magazine sell how they became this..give the writers and artist of these comics more . This movie had great effects..Ryan killed it..but I just am tired of back stories..Why do we need to know everything when we see each and every superhero movie..take a leap skip one ..I don't think Dead Pool needed the back story and the over blown CGI..there was enough interesting effects and jokes..I seen it twice..so I didn't hate it..but at the same time.it just pains me to rewatch the back story over and over..part of the hero world is you can pick up any where..the backs stories change..and sometimes they are dead..but then another story alive? Then you have reboots..what spiderman are we on now? I don't need to see another uncle die..and him bite by a spider..and the new viewers..just make it shown in a magazine.a collectable  ad. for marketing .",1490054400,,995,4.653409090909091

...unnecessary blasphemy and swearing.
...predictable plot throughout the film.
...for Stan Lee thinking that taking the role of a misogynistic pig would be humorous.
...and for the insensitive gay stereotyping.

Oh, and for not giving proper credit to the Dirty Harry film series for Marvel's ripoff of the main character's name.

7628517,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Well, they did it! We finally got the Deadpool movie that we have been begging the world of cinema to give us. Let me tell you, FOX delivered a gem of the film!

From the opening credits to the surprise at the end it is impossible not to enjoy this hilarious action packed romp of a comic book film. Ryan Reynolds himself even wanted to make his return and give the fans what they truly deserved. We got it all. The quick one liners the 4th wall breaks and the most accurately designed comic book hero costume we have seen next to Spider-Man and Superman. There is a little something for every one in this film and sometimes a little too much for others. However, there is tons of appeal and tons of fan tribute. This film had set the bar for what comic book films need to be, even getting an 'R' rating.

If you haven't seen this film yet, I do not know what you have been doing with your life. While there are still faults making this film far from perfect there is still a good time to had.",1486598400,3,993,4.166666666666667

7628584,5,B01BDUS0NY,"I really wanted to hate this movie. His creator (Rob Liefeld) is perhaps one of the most controversial comic book artists of all time: Most comic fans appear to either love or hate his work. Unfortunately, I was solidly in the later camp, and cringe whenever I ran across any of his illustrations. Other comic book artists even began copying certain aspects of his style, and for this reason I hold Liefeld personally responsible for a sharp drop in the quality of comic art during the 90s. Various people have also pointed out that Deadpool is highly derivative, since Liefeld blatantly ripped off the DC character Deathstroke. Why then have I given this film my coveted 5 star rating? Well, no matter what reservations I might have about Liefeld or his ""creations"", Deadpool the film was an absolute delight. The relentless sarcasm and adult humor managed to achieve a perfect balance that is nearly impossible to pull off. Also, apparently an amoral bounty hunter makes for a better inversion of the traditional superhero than the confused anti-heroes of Batman v Superman. Personally, I rank Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool as on par with Christopher Reeve's Superman and Christian Bale's Batman. Whats even more remarkable is that you rarely even see Reynolds' face, which demonstrates a great deal of humility, since what actor doesn't want his face on the big screen? While I would love to provide readers with a complete catalogue of Liefeld's numerous offenses to good taste and decency, it is perhaps better to point out that Reynolds and Miller probably revolutionized the superhero movie formula with this innocuous little movie.

The only criticism I can offer is that my 69 year old father did not enjoy this at all, and I suspect most women might not like it either. Deadpool's target demographic is likely to be mostly men, from their teens to their 40s.",1486080000,,1862,4.929936305732484

7628694,5,B01BDUS0NY,I have nothing terrible to say about Deadpool - they DEFINITELY redeemed themselves from the other movie when they screwed up his character. Goodness gracious this movie was so satisfying. I wish they made all Marvel/DC Comics with a R-Rating because 9 times out of 10 the true origin stories or comic series have dark/twisted storylines or whatnot. This was superb! It broke the 4th wall in pieces. Ryan Reynolds redeemed himself with this one. I hope for a sequel!,1485475200,,466,4.8375

7628708,3,B01BDUS0NY,"As much as a I love Deadpool (he's in my top 3 of favorite X-Men related characters ever along with Nightcrawler and Gambit), I was a little disappointed with this film for some reason.  I enjoyed it, but I think I was expecting it to be funnier or more mind-blowing or something.  For the budget and timetable and Ryan Reynolds being in it, it is very good, don't get me wrong.  I guess the hype just got into my head.  The production feels a bit lower level at times, but does give the film some charm.  This is R-rated Deadpool and not some lower-rated, censored fluff.  The villains are appropriately villainous, Deadpool is equally bombastic, and the side characters are intriguing.  I like it enough to watch again, but first impressions, for this viewer at least, were a bit underwhelming.",1485475200,,796,4.642857142857143

A neighbor mentioned it and taking their word, I went to Amazon and downloaded it. I was puzzled for the first few minutes, as I simply couldn't figure out WHAT exactly I was watching. I've NEVER seen blatantly gratuitous violence taken to such extremes in my lifetime! The story line might have had some merit if done differently, but I see no value in any manner of its production or directing. ""R"" rating...what's that nowadays? Even Disney puts out ""R"" ratings. This movie should have been rated ""X"" and anyone below the age of 19 should be carded at the door. Save your money for something that has REAL entertainment value.

7628904,3,B01BDUS0NY,"I absolutely hate the character of Deadpool, his origin, and how he seems to be a favorite for every douchebag tattooed dudebro for whom Deadpool is not only their favorite comic character, but the only one they really know anything about. Having said that, it was s surprise to me that I actually kind of enjoyed this movie. The film has all the major plot holes, inconsistencies, and random stupidity that you'd expect from a movie about a character created by Rob ""I'm a cancer on the comci industry"" Liefeld. It has all the worst qualities of Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman. What it got right, however, was its irreverence and use of violence.
This is not a comic book movie that will be tying in anytime soon to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because it can't. Deadpool is the ""inside joke,"" the ""blue humor,"" the ""adult animated humor"" [ie: Rick and Morty, Archer, etc] of all comic book movies. It breaks the fourth wall constantly and crudely, but it also does a great job of lampooning itself.
The plot, about how the titular character gains his mutant powers and goes on a quest for revenge, is both brainless and plodding. Yet, if you were expecting anything more from the character of Deadpool, you're better off sticking to Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy, because this is all that is needed for a Deadpool movie. This movie feels like more of a last-minute side-story to an X-Men movie but it doesn't have to be anything more for its target audience, especially in light of the decline of the X-Men franchise.
This movie sets out to be the ""violence and nudity-filled gross-out college comedy of Marvel comics,"" and it succeeds wonderfully! Ryan Reynolds is perfect for the role and this movie forces me to admit that a character I hate, by a writer and artist I loathe, actually entertained me for the duration of the film.
Still, the pedestrian plot, flawed story, and lowest-common-denominator feel of the film prevent me from giving it anything more than an average rating.",1484438400,2,2000,4.717142857142857

we have family movie night weekly, and I I sit through some movies where I find myself rolling my eyes, or muttering 'seriously?' But this here? This one is just for me. All the elements I love rolled up in 1 movie. I watch this over and over, alone, and I laugh so hard I cry. Me time. No kids allowed, not a kid movie.
Ryan Reynolds is my kind of funny. Morena was not the annoying love interest, and the X-men were just enough (Collosus is one of my fav). The villain was cool too. I swear every time I look up I see a GOT actor! LOL. Love it!
No this movie does not hold the secret of life, and it's not a hero movie, but it is sharp, it doesn't insult my intelligence, and every once in a while, it's ok to enjoy watching someone do/say irresponsible stuff and laugh your butt off.",1484352000,,811,4.06875

7629051,2,B01BDUS0NY,"Deadpool was perhaps the most hyped film of 2016. During the first half of the year, I felt like it was more talked and obsessed about than The Force Awakens.

When Deadpool was in theaters I didn't go to see it. Instead, I rented it when it made its way to Redbox to see what I had missed.
The answer? Not much.

With all of the hype and praise for Deadpool, I was shocked to find that the most enjoyable part of the film for me was the opening credits. They provided the only laughs I was able to get from this film. A majority of the films attempts at humor tended to be very lame and generic action hero lines which, I guess are part of the character.

Thats a conflict with superhero films today, you're allowed to put out a piss poor film if theres evidence of a reference to an issue of the actual comic book.

Every twenty minutes or so theres some clever breaking of the fourth wall which is some of the little enjoyment one is able to find from this film.
What surprised me most of all about Deadpool was how this movie was labeled as the coolest and most offensive film to come out that year and had what is without a doubt the most mediocre love story Ive seen outside of a Nicholas Sparks or Tyler Perry film. It seems as if the few uses of the f word being somewhat lazily sprinkled throughout this film in order to turn a PG-13 script into a rated R movie helped cause a distraction from the generic love story.

The first use of Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine as a mute is perhaps the worst representation of Deadpool but is Deadpool stalking his girlfriend and feeling insecure about his face any better?

Its very clear to me that this film has benefited from a younger audience made up of people who refuse to see anything that was made before they were born because literally every film from the 1970s is far more offensive and extreme than Deadpool could ever imagine to be.

Before seeing this film I heard the sex scene was very graphic and something nobody would want to see with their parents. I guess that is because it was suggested the girl used a strap on dildo on Deadpool, but if audiences took the time to see sexually graphic films like Blue is the Warmest Color, Blue Velvet, Showgirls or something as simple as Sharon Stone crossing her legs would they really take the time to look away from their phones to notice such a lame and conservative sex scene?

What made my eyes roll the most during the sex scene was seeing the male using his hands to cover the womans breasts at all times in order to prevent her boobs from being shown. With how millennials were in such awe over such a lame sex scene, it really discredits anybody who says the pornography of today is desensitizing the younger generation.

Being someone who has seen and enjoyed raunchy comedies such as Caddyshack and Sixteen Candles, Deadpool is very lame and held back from the kind of humor it so wants to be.

This rated R action/comedy film to me is only something that could surprise and amaze people whose memory of rated R comedies only dates back to 2008.",1483920000,,3071,4.371929824561404

On the plus side some of the special effects were quite well done - the slow downs and zoom ins while things are in the air (for example, a car flipping over) impressed me more than once.

Though they slightly altered how he got his name which bothered me because having the dead pool where Wade was being tortured seems like it would be more meaningful than simply at the bar he works through. This is also probably the least disfigured I've ever seen Deadpool. He looks more like a burn victim than anything. There are comics where his eyeball is falling out and his jaw is practically coming off but I digress. Great movie.,1483401600,,491,4.655172413793103

7629288,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Hilarious but definitely not for children. A lot of sexual innuendo, brief nudity and off color remarks make this unsuitable for children who might love super heroes, but this is an adult movie. Reynolds plays Deadpool, a bumbling but capable kind of super hero forced into service because of a lab accident that renders him so ugly that he resorts to wearing a mask. He takes a taxi to his missions, but routinely forgets his weapons and ammunition while cracking jokes and insulting his enemies throughout the film. Men may find this a lot more fun to watch than the women in their lives. It's just that kind of movie.",1482969600,,620,4.6454545454545455
7629289,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Hilarious. This was a very different superhero movie and it was so refreshing. The sex scene in the middle was very funny, but when you watch this over and over, it turns out it's actually a bit too long! Otherwise, loved this script (very smartly written(, the acting (oObviously Ryan Reynolds makes this film), and the overall concept. Looking forward to a sequel!",1482969600,,366,4.825396825396825

Even though I had seen it before I bought it, I am happy to have it to see again and again, I already found quips I missed and some background visuals I didn't notice before. And it's really raunchy; not for your young kids. Plus, I enjoyed the included extras which are also very funny.",1482883200,,422,4.023809523809524

7629339,5,B01BDUS0NY,"I just watched this movie again, and I am pretty sure its better every time!  I love the breaking of the fourth wall, especially because that is a Deadpool thing.  Nobody else really does it.  I will say that if you are complaining that this is not a kids movie, or a hero movie, well of course it isn't!  It's rated R, the comics are evidence enough, and if you didn't read the comics, well then you must have seen the previews.  Unless you have been living under a rock of course.  And who goes to see a movie without knowing anything about it?  That would be the fault of the viewer, not the movie.  Ryan Reynolds just perfected the role of a character who may not have been invented for him, but it sure seems like it.  Reynolds is just that good.  This is the first time I have nothing even slightly negative to say about a film.  Each interaction was true to character, in my opinion. Even though I know nothing of the two x-men in the film, I want to see more of them.  I loved the Wolverine references, mostly because, Wolverine.

7629390,2,B01BDUS0NY,Parts of it are entertaining but it feels like the director and cast are trying too hard to make the movie interesting.  Ryan Reynolds is a fine actor but he isn't as funny in this movie as in others I've seen. Probably not worth your time.,1482624000,,240,4.217391304347826
7629391,5,B01BDUS0NY,This movie took years and a lot of effort by Ryan Reynolds to get it made.  It really shows the dedication they had for this project.  Do not confuse this Green Lantern or Wolverine Origins (those movies were a failure of epic proportions.)  Not recommended for young viewers this movie is Rated-R and it earns that rating.  The humor is mature in nature and the violence is graphic.  Great movie for people old enough to watch Rated-R movies.,1482624000,,443,4.628205128205129

The action and comedy in this was for great and well after the movie was over still good laughs. This is however not a childs movie. Nor is the comic and any parent who thought otherwise and let their child see it only to complain later should probably have done their research or perhaps not let their child see it to begin with when it was stated over and over before release this movie would *NOT* be under a rating less then R.

I originally saw this movie when it first came out, with my daughter. We giggled right through it. It has the perfect combination of action & humor. Deadpool is totally irreverent & twisted (check out the opening credits! ha!). Its nice to see a 'superhero' who isn't trying to save the world or be a shining example of moral fortitude (he loves being shady), but begrudgingly ends up doing the right thing anyway. This movie is a solid pg13 due to a few scenes, but nothing softcore. Enjoy!",1481673600,,508,4.593406593406593

7629645,4,B01BDUS0NY,"Thought this was maybe a bit gory for my taste, but...................Morena Baccarin and Ryan Reynolds do tip the scales up and to the positive. There are so many films now emanating from graphic novels. Mostly, I think this is a great artistic addition to cinema. I'd be even more impressed if there were more cinematic titles like 'Wonder Woman,' featuring female heroes. There is certainly an ample offering of female heroines populating graphic novels. Time for the matriarchy to be better represented in film. Studios should be thinking about making a project of the graphic novel, 'Monstress.'",1481155200,3,600,5.195876288659794

This is the comic book movie for grown ups (seriously, kids shouldn't see this one until they are older). Ryan Reynolds portrayal of the eponymous Deadpool is perfect! It is impossible for me to imagine any other actor in the role.  No spoilers from me, but I will say this: Deadpool is no hero, and, this is a love story :)",1481155200,,422,4.197530864197531
7629649,5,B01BDUS0NY,"I don't know if it is Deadpool, his hot girlfriend, blind Al, or less angry Rosie O'Donnell, but this movie made me want to touch myself. I laughed like crazy, rewound and re-watched several parts, and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Ryan Reynolds has been one of my favorite actors ever since I saw him in Van Wilder. He is funny without being stupid, which seems to be a rarity with the comedic actors these days. Awesome flick, well worth the watch.",1481155200,,452,4.580246913580247

The theatre near us even had a sign up inside the theatre with the parental advisory and Deadpool saying something like: ""As one parent to another (yes, I have a kid, read a comic) don't bring your child to my movie so your complaints about how violent this is don't mess it up for people who are old enough to watch it and prevent further sequels.""

Not gonna go through every scene like some wanna be movie reviewer but if you like the ANTI-hero genre, love dark humor, are not afraid of massive F-carpet bombing dialogue, are a fan of ""DeadPool"" comics......oh yah, and are okay with lotsa gruesome violence that is not to be taken seriously, then this movie is killer. (80's expression)  The writers really were the REAL heros in this movie. The movie got its budget slashed by like some $5million while they were making the thing. The writers wrote all around the needed cut scenes and still cranked out a killer movie plot/story.
AND....special thanks to Ryan Reynolds for NOT taking off his DeadPool mask every 10 seconds just to satisfy an actor's over inflated ego....the way most other actors would have done...... in fact the whole cast from Baccarin  to the ""Moody Teen"" to mister CGI Colossus (WHO THEY ALSO FINALLY GOT RIGHT!), all made the movie very re-watchable.",1480291200,,1078,4.9502762430939224

This is NOT a family film by any means.

It is chalk full of raunchy, sarcastic humor. It's also pretty full of vulgarity though. . . .think of it as the dark side of the superheros that we all know. This isn't your typical good vs evil ....this is your dude wants revenge and takes it...but just so happens that the guys he wants revenge on are the bad guys.

It's definitely not something I would watch again....simply because of the vulgarity but that's just my personal preference. Pity though because the movie was very enjoyable aside from that",1479686400,2,594,4.584905660377358

7629809,5,B01BDUS0NY,"This film is what happens when you take virtually every common trope in superhero movies and turn them right on their collective heads. Let's run through a checklist:

Morally righteous good guy as the main character? Nope, instead we get a foul-mouthed homicidal psychopath with a wacky sense of humor. Virginal love interest with a schoolgirl crush on our hero? Nuh-uh, try ""lustful hooker with a plastic hard-on"" and you've got the girl of the movie. Grandiose effort to save the world from an all-powerful bad guy? Nah, instead it's all about Wade getting revenge on the guy who disfigured him so he can continue having sexy time with his hooker girlfriend. Virtuous morals? Gone. Clean, family-friendly humor? Forget about it. Innocent people in need of saving? Not even once. Deadpool completely subverts the genre and openly mocks the common trends and cliche's we've all come to know and love, regularly breaking the fourth wall and offering sardonic yet witty commentary on the genre as a whole.

Ryan Reynolds, put simply, IS Deadpool. He embodies virtually everything about the character, from his light-heartedness and completely amoral personality to his absolutely filthy sense of humor. His performance is at once endearing, hilarious, and the truest possible portrayal of Deadpool to ever be depicted on-screen. He's lovable, psychotic, and downright hilarious at times (with my personal favorite scene involving a dispute between Deadpool and Colossus... which ends with the single funniest fight in the movie).

Be warned though, this film is NOT for kids and is NOT family friendly... ... which should have been plainly obvious judging by the R rating... ... would you believe I actually saw parents with their kids when I went to go see this in theaters? Look guys, this film has everything -- no, really. EVERYTHING! Graphic violence, obscene language every few seconds, full frontal nudity (both male and female), an entire sex montage, dirty jokes... every single R-rated thing they could throw into this feature WAS thrown in and is regularly stuffed in your face in full detail. If you're seriously ignorant enough to think that Deadpool is a child-friendly movie purely because it's based on a comic book, might I humbly refer you to Watchmen, V for Vendetta, The Crow, and The Killing Joke, before having your geek license revoked. Seriously -- the rating is there, half the marketing campaign was devoted to emphasizing how non-family-oriented it was going to be, AND the source material is obviously adult-oriented, so if you ignored all that and got upset at how obscene this R-RATED MOVIE was, you have nobody to blame but yourself.

So, rant notwithstanding, I highly recommend this film. I give it 5/5 stars. See it when you can.

(... seriously though, would these concerned parents just SHUT UP already?!)",1479600000,2,2840,5.098924731182795

7629868,4,B01BDUS0NY,"Here's a short unhelpful review.

Some thoughts:
1. Enjoyed the movie overall for humor and action sequences
2. This movie is rated R, contains blood, gore, nudity, and strong language. Some parents have made the mistake of letting their children watching it and blaming the content creators later. Do not be one of those parents. If you're one of these individuals, accept responsibility, you lazy hypocrite.
3. Movie contains many references that can be lost in translation or if you haven't watched X-Men movies or familiar with U.S. pop culture  so may not be as enjoyable to friends/dates that don't get the references
4. Having said all that, the movie might be enjoyable for young audiences, because Ryan Reynolds.
5. Its an origin story with a pacing I don't like, but screw random internet guy, right? Im not a fan of present day action sequences with extended flashbacks. (this is where I took off the star)",1479081600,,917,4.871794871794871

This movie has a strong sexual content and nudity, not to mention very graphic violence. This movie is for mature audiences. Even some of the violent scenes are more then I can handle, especially in the beginning. The sexual content is very intense as well, so make sure no children are watching. Other then that the story line is great it adds flashbacks throughout the movie that helps build to give the ending a great finish. The only thing about having too many flashbacks is that some people can get lost in them and miss out on the story itself. It can also be told that it leads into other movies such as the x-men movies. Otherwise for adult action this is a great movie for adults. It has a good love story along with action.",1478390400,,841,4.432258064516129

It is not for young kids though but definitely worth seeing and owning. I went ahead and bought the Combo Pack in 4K even though I do not yet own 4K TV. It saves money down the line when I do get one. I do wish this movie was in 3D but hey we can not always get what we want. :)

Seriously, after the first few jokes and gimmicks wear off we are left with a tacked on origin story, paper thin plot, and some very weak villains and pointless side characters. Some of the action is legitimately impressive but it all comes off too forced and inconsequential. Not for me and I'm not getting all the sudden hype for Deadpool. Deadpool was a running joke for comic fans but they found a way to make the character have mass appeal. That's all, nothing more, nothing less.

7630118,3,B01BDUS0NY,I don't really see the hype behind Deadpool.  Ryan Reynolds is chill and funny but the overall concept of the character isn't that funny.

7630119,4,B01BDUS0NY,"Deadpool is perhaps the best adaptation in recent comic memory (but its NOT for kids!). My review concerns the value of purchasing a film in digital form, when it is available as a digital Ultraviolet copy elsewhere. In short, if Amazon is your primary viewing medium, and you do not want to own the physical discs, it might be worth it to you.

This stated, you should know that the physical, Ultra-High Definition (UHD)/4K version of this film provides a digital Ultraviolet (UV) version redeemable through an approved MYUV digital cloud locker service (VUDU, Flixtser, etc). Amazon is NOT an approved UV digital cloud locker, so if you wish to watch Deadpool on Amazon (FireTV, Stick), buying a standalone digital copy is your only option (redeeming an Ultraviolet code will not allow you to watch Deadpool on Amazon; Ultraviolet and Amazon Services do not get along). However, as Amazon streaming quality is good, and my purchased copy was only $9.99, I believe the value for this film is acceptable.

Know that if you wish to view Deadpool in higher streaming quality, Amazon is not your best option. You alternatively could purchase the Digital 4K physical disc media (Blu-Ray 4K) that includes an Ultraviolet digital copy.  Although you can use different MyUV digital cloud locker services, a favorite is VUDU. Through VUDU, your registered UV code for Deadpool would then play in HDX format through VUDU. Note: streaming content at UHD will require that all of your devices be HDCP 2.2 compliant. You can run the VUDU service on a Roku device (it is HDCP 2.2 compliant), and output a high-speed HDMI cable to your 4K TV (note: if you use any other device used in your UHD chain, <i.e. stereo, etc> it must also be HDCP 2.2 compliant to receive the UHD signal). I am now in the process of upgrading to receive UHD signals, and there is investment related to the 4K process that no all users will value.  Knowing what I know now, based on my user needs, it would have been better to have waited for an upgrade.

As an aside, Disney-owned films engage a process that allows access both on Amazon, VUDU, and iTunes. Once you own a Disney Film in its digital form, it is viewable on all devices. This stated, despite the recent use of vfx in Disney's live-action Jungle Book film, Disney does not currently have any UHD releases planned for distribution on Home Media.  While Disney now owns Marvel Studios, Deadpool is definitely the one Marvel character that ""got away"".",1477353600,8,2475,4.771028037383178

7630147,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Deedpool is a comic book character from the 80's. He was meant to be a joke, a parody of all other Heroes.  A man with a ego as big as his mouth who just happened to be pretty much impossible to kill.  Self-centered, greedy, heavily armed, this is not the man you want on your side.  But you don't want him coming after you either.
To make a movie based on this character, centered totally around this character, is insane.  Nobody in their right mind would have done it.  But Ryan Reynolds is not in the right mind.  Not by a long shot.
So we now have this R-Rated movie about Deadpool.  And it is GLORIOUS.  From the opening credits to the ending credits, this is full of humor, explosions, nudity, fights, explosions, costumes, X-Men, super-powers, explosions.  Okay, okay, maybe not that many explosions.
The point is, the story is simple, the characters are simple, the ethics are black and white.  This is a movie about Deadpool, a movie about a character, just like Suicide Squad is about a group of characters.  There is no message here, nothing about the struggle of man over nature or Good vs. Evil or anything like that.  This is not about gun control or not doing drugs or wearing white after Labor Day.  Which, by the way, you totally can.  Anyway, this is about Deadpool.  Not Francis, no the Joker (wrong universe), and not about clean language.  Deadpool isn't a Hero.  He tells us that many times during the film.  He is just a guy going after another guy who wronged him.  It's a guy thing.  But women can enjoy the romance in it too.  And the explosions.  Did I mention the explosions?",1477180800,4,1604,4.477508650519031

Extremely funny, extremely graphic, and has all the trademark quirks and abilities we have come to love about the character. Morena Baccarin is excellent as the sometimes tough, sometimes caring girlfriend/fiancee, and Brianna Hildebrand just kills it as Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Full of pop culture references (sometimes a bit too much), it's a great movie even to have on the background while working since the music is so good. Bonus features are great, including a gag reel.

Or at least, I thought I did but during a particularly mournful time in my life I had heard Deadpool was a jolly, gore-soaked, romp that I thought would cheer me up, or at the very least wouldn't make me more depressed. It turns out I was right. Deadpool is definitely a terrible human being, but Ryan Reynolds plays him with enough charisma and energy that you can't help but cheer him on as he decapitates and murders countless nameless henchmen or gleefully encourages his taxi driver to murder his love interests' boyfriend so that the cab driver can move in on her. It's deliberately dumb in a fairly smart way and I enjoyed every minute of it.

7630347,5,B01BDUS0NY,"10. It's the best R-rated superhero movie to ever come out. Yes, there's sexiness and violence in this movie, but it's entertaining-plot-driving sexiness and violence.
9. It's a refreshing break from superhero movies that take themselves so seriously. I mean really, who wants to see the world saved again? Been there, done that.
8. This movie was even better than the trailers made it out to be. Don't pretend you didn't watch the trailers. You wouldn't even be here if you hadn't.
7. It provides unexpected insights into the lives of professional sex workers and professional mercenaries. No, I'm serious. Watch the interactions between Wade and Vanessa and tell me you don't see the parallels.
6. This movie has a way better love story than Twilight, although let's be honest that's a pretty low bar, so let's say it's a way better love story than some trash like the Notebook.
5. There's a unicorn in this movie, and it too has a better love story than Twilight. You have been warned.
4. Deadpool breaks the fourth wall in entertaining and amusing ways. How many other movies do you get to be part of the action? No, 3D movies do not count as breaking the fourth wall.
3. The cast is excellent. You couldn't ask for a better Deadpool than Ryan Reynolds. The man should just legally change his name to Wade and be done with it. The other actors are really good too. Show them some love. Give them some royalty money.
2. You see the best introduction of a teenage superhero ever committed to film. If you don't like Negasonic Teenage Warhead there's something wrong with you because Brianna Hildebrand hits a home run.
1. You were going to buy this movie anyway. You already saw the movie at the theater and you're just reading reviews for entertaining tidbits and the chance to see some crazy person melt down in public.",1475971200,,1823,4.6645962732919255

I think in the future this film will ultimately become a teenager thing though because the type of humor in it. It has a lack of seriousness  (which some will really appreciate) but I think the humor lines towards the media industry will drive it to being a teen icon just my opinion.  It is the first Marvel comic movie that truly depicts graphic violence which is nice for action fans and some of the crass humor did make me laugh. Just be aware the humor is kind of juvenile at times.",1475798400,,609,4.324561403508772

7630380,5,B01BDUS0NY,"What to say. I don't even know where to begin.

This movie fires on all cylinders. Ryan Reynolds deserves praise for holding out on Deadpool being rated R. It would have been a travesty otherwise. He absolutely nailed it with the character. Violence, gore, the hilarity of neither being taken seriously by him, and the fourth-wall breaks were spot on. Fans of Deadpool should be proud the Merc with a Mouth had been given his due.

There might seem like there was a lull in the action during the second act but that was absolutely needed in order to flesh out the plot. Even then, the humor kept me going. T.J Miller as Weasel was just awesome and Leslie Uggams as Al was funny as hell. And......having Bob thrown in was just the cherry on top.",1475625600,,744,4.463235294117647

As many others have stated though, if you are looking for a family super-hero movie, this is not it unless your family is okay with profanity, violence and sexual situations.  Growing up in the 1980s, not sure that this would have hit my family's radar.  Anyways, if you are at all a fan of Deadpool in the comics, they did a great job with the character on the screen.  Give it a shot.",1475539200,,413,4.324675324675325
7630397,4,B01BDUS0NY,"Standing there opening the case, I told myself I couldn't believe I bought this ridiculous movie. The guy posing on the back and even the title was so stupid. Only Evil-bugs will appreciate this title/name.  Just thought it was gonna be so lame, but Ryan pulled it all together and owned that character. Just like that Chris dude playing Thor, He nailed it. Nobody could replace them.
Pity about Colossus. Too tarnished and the thick heavy Russian accent was somewhat disturbing. As far as I remember Piotr grew up in the states. His accent wouldn't have been anywhere that thick.

So if you're not an evil bug and have the ability to look past the carnage and slaughter, then you might enjoy this movie as I did.
Course if you are an evil bug then none of what I just wrote will matter and you should be lovin this movie all the same  :D",1475539200,,838,4.428571428571429

My friend couldn't sit through it and after 45 minutes, left!  After hearing and reading a few encouraging reviews, I was committed.  But, it just idled on and on, and only the last 30 minutes seemed compelling and relevant to me.  I'm sure there is an audience for this film and many will be amused, but no matter how badly I wanted too, I just didn't connect with this one and found it really tough to watch through to the end.",1475539200,7,614,4.222222222222222

It was recommended to me by someone I'd just met, and I expressed that I used to like superhero movies, but that lately, I don't see them because I can't follow chase and fight scenes, and there is so much of that in most movies today. This one was really different. Even the fight scenes were interesting to me!

I read another review on Amazon before watching this that pointed me to be sure to check out the clever opening credits, so I'm sharing that here for you, too!

I also really enjoyed the thoughtful use of music throughout the movie.

I have watched all the X-men, Avengers, Iron man and all the other various marvel movies and this one from the previews looked totally different, Well  i am glad i watched it. In fact i have watched it probably 7 times since the first time. It is a refreshing change of pace from the normal super hero marvel movies. The comedy in it is exceptional and really makes the movie with all the one liners and references to the other marvel movies and characters. Highly recommended.",1475452800,,573,4.563106796116505

7630545,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Let me say at the very beginning of this review, I loathe super hero movies. I can not stress that point enough. For me, watching anyone of the countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios in the name of entertainment over the past decade is, for me, akin to having teeth pulled. Painful to say the least. My friends however are addicted to every single bombastic franchise, and through sufferance, I've endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet more Lycra-clad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat (there are of course exceptions to the above; 'The Dark Knight', the original 'X-Men)

I was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watching Deadpool would be an excellent waste of my time. I envisaged 15 minutes of feigned interest, followed by an hour 45 of updating my email and some cheeky online shopping. Well that new Morphy Richards kettle and toaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold, shock of all shocks, this film is bloody marvellous!! Bloody, hold your knickers cause they are about to get blown off, marvellous!

The dialogue is witty, sincere, and delivered by every single actor with a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius, than drab scripted nonsense.

The pacing of the movie is excellent. It held my interest through its entirety.

The actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned director.

This film is a perfect storm! Just everything is right! I look forward, to my great surprise to any squeals!",1475020800,,1549,4.896946564885496

I caught an early showing of it luckily, and the best part, there were NO little annoying whiny kids whatsoever, they got through their thick skulls that this was for the grownups. the audience reaction was great, there were a few good previews beforehand even though they're really annoying, and as soon as the movie started, one of the audience members said ""time to laugh"", and that's exactly what we did, we all had a great time and laughed our heads off.

It is kind of f'd up and certainly not for the under teenaged crowd.

It does have some of the best versions of X-Men to appear on film, plus there is a lot of humor. Plus, keep a look out for the comic version of the SHIELD helicarrier because it makes an appearance.

If you are a fan of Marvel comics and are remotely familiar with Deadpool or current pop culture you will probably like this. It is rated R but tends to skew toward the entertainment of ""14 Year Old Boys"". So if that, or Ryan Reynolds, is your thing, or at least something you might get a chuckle out of then this movie is for you.",1474848000,,662,4.116279069767442

Ryan Reynolds was definitely the best person to play Deadpool. He is such a great actor in general by really sold this character for us. The plot was great and easy to follow. Some movies can be all humor and no plot, but this one had an equal amount of both. We can't wait until Deadpool 2 comes out and I am sure we will be the first people in line to see it in theaters.

There was (as expected) some very adult scenes, language, references, implications (and many direct references), but all together, definitely one of the superhero movies I enjoyed the most.

7630741,5,B01BDUS0NY,"I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers.
Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).
The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.
The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.
The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.
Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.
Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.
As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.

Sometimes odd movies with a touch of edge provide just the right level of humour to give an audience a smirk as if they had been let in on an inside joke.

In my opinion, it is probably the best ""super hero"" movie I've ever seen. It's no more violent than any other contemporary film, but the writing and acting are brilliant!

Definitely worth a watch if you can tolerate the overall attitude of the movie that it's okay to laugh at or be entertained by people getting hurt.

This movie is a cut above most ""comic book"" movies; it is hilarious, and it is unashamedly adult.

7631050,4,B01BDUS0NY,"Ended flat for me, but overall, as a person sick of comic book super hero movies I enjoyed Deadpool. I always thought Ryan Reynolds was perfect casting for this character (though I still think he would have fit The Flash much better than Green Lantern but that's unrelated). It was really cool to see Colossus.

The humor, and in some ways the satire and outright commentary on contemporary films both romantic and action, made the ending seem surprisingly unfitting. But that's possibly the point--I'm going to make fun of what I'm doing, and what I'm about to do, and that's what this film does.

This is an hour and forty-five minutes of typical marvel plot holes you can drive a truck through, some really obvious CG, and jokes seemingly aimed at the 11-14 year old male audience.

It is irreverent, violent, and graphic but all done knowing that it is for that purpose. Ryan is Deadpool and he plays him perfectly.

7631162,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Let's just say this is not the movie I had in mind when my husband said we were watching a superhero movies. Needless to say I actually enjoyed it. If you are expecting to see a movie along the lines of avengers, hulk, ironman, or even Thor this is not the movie for you. I has a thorough storyline. The main character and almost every character in the movie has a potty mouth. It is filled with a lot of action and it will keep you entertained. The only reason I am giving this movie 4 stars is because I would have liked to have seen a better ending due to the movie being grade A action packed.",1472860800,,597,4.067796610169491

7631197,1,B01BDUS0NY,"Well, the one star is for the version we saw. We just rented the Vudu version of the movie. It's likely significantly watered down. It was rated R but was more like a PG-13. Negative reviews on Amazon have talked about the vulgarity of the movie. We didn't see that. Only innuendos. I saw a YouTube trailer when this movie first came out and had been waiting to rent it since then. The YouTube trailer I originally saw was much more coarse than the Vudu rental version we just watched. In the rental, if there was a single f-bomb it slid by so fast I didn't even notice it. Neither did my wife. Make sure you buy it or rent it from Amazon to get the movie you think you are getting. I think the comedic quality of the movie is affected by the ""water-down"". It doesn't seem to have the impact that people rave about in other reviews.",1472774400,,832,4.238993710691824

7631216,5,B01BDUS0NY,"With 9,988 reviews and counting there isn't much to add to the discussion of the film other than it's fantastic.  I'm not a comic book buff so I can't really ascertain whether it's faithful to its source or not.  I can say though that this is a career maker for Ryan Reynolds.  Reynolds got his start years ago as the best thing in a mundane sitcom ""Two Guys, A Girl, and a Pizza Place"" and since then has been featured in routine comedies and straight-to-video dreck.  I know he was Green Lantern but since I didn't see it I'll let the fanboys pass judgment.  Last year he had a terrific bit as Helen Mirren's lawyer in ""Woman in Gold"" but Mirren makes everyone look good.  With Wade Wilson/ Deadpool Reynolds has finally found a role tailor-made for his talent for wry sardonic dark humor.  Yes, the direction and script are terrific but it's Reynolds that makes this bird fly.  Here's hoping he can parlay it into the career that should have been jumpstarted twenty years ago.",1472774400,5,979,4.5227272727272725

The character really lacks humor and he is way too childish - I've seen kids more mature in behaving and thinking than Deadpool.",1472688000,,526,4.25

I was expecting the movie to be more along the lines of how he was portrayed in X Men Origins: Wolverine and follow in the steps of the other Marvel movies. That was my mistake for assuming.

Learned slang for private parts from other kids at school and songs on the radio. As long as they realize this is not reality and do not try to re inact any of it, they can watch it a 100 times.

Since he is in costume most of the time (no mouth and his  own eyes can't be seen) , it's his voice that really carries the character.  Not for young kids, and  not for my 90 yr old mother who has little, if any, tolerance for language she was never allowed to speak;  Great for everyone else.  I appreciated it even more the 2nd time around.",1472169600,,430,4.2592592592592595

The movie in 3D is mediocre and not really worth the extra. However, the 4K IS worth it! Between the Atmos sound and quality just an amazing film.

If you're on the fence for 4K get it! Just make sure that you have a REAL 4K TV and not some fo-4k. I love the fact they brought in other Xmen who hopefully will be introduced in other",1472083200,4,479,3.9791666666666665

Miller(Transformers:Age Of Extinction) as Weasel , Brianna Hildebrand(First Girl I Loved) as Warhead, Stefan Kapicic(Tears For Sale) as The Voice of Colussus, Karan Soni(Safety Not Guaranteed) as Dopinder, also Starring Michael Benyaer(G.I. Joe: Rise Of Cobra) as Warlord, Gina Carano(Fast And Furious 6) as Angel Dust,Ed Skrein(Game Of Thrones) as Ajax and Leslie Uggams(Nurse Jackie) as Blind Al . For a Superhero Comedy Film it was great They Knew what they were making and it was they broke the fourth wall from the Opening Credits to The Post Credit also despite being a Comedy it was very dramatic at times also loved the action also one of the most accurate CBMs of all time it was too me a Epic Of Version Of Kick-Ass Though it could've done without some of the nudity but at least it wasn't Wolf Of Wall Street Bad, I Still Like Man Of Steel better but this fun and worth owning on Blu-Ray .

Ryan Reynolds really knocked the merc with a mouth out of the park. Dead pool's craziness is really set loose in this movie, and from start to finish there are quite a few references to other things that just make you laugh. And the tip of the hat to Ferris Bueller's Day Off at the end? Priceless. I can't wait for the 2nd installment.",1471996800,,506,4.510869565217392

The fight scenes are really well done and you can't help but laugh your ass off at all of the X-Men/Hugh Jackman references. Big time sex scenes in this one too, so if you think your kids can handle violence, just know that the sex is pretty hardcore.

It was okay.

It was funny but not -that- funny. It didn't make me go breathless from laughter at all. The action scenes were done well but I felt like there could have been more, maybe. It was also not as crude as some people liked to say it was (which is probably a good thing).

Boring torture scenes, pedestrian fight scenes with 90s era slow motion bullets traveling through the air. Colossus actually has the ability to change back into his human form, however he's too stupid to do it when he sits in the back of a taxi cab.  A ridiculous cardboard British villain with an expressionless face. Another scene at the end where a large ship massively explodes in a harbor. Again, not a police car or ambulance in sight. The whole movie was a tired cliche of stupid babbling banter, with the typical ""hostage girlfriend"" climax seen in every bad 1980s television show.",1471651200,7,854,4.618421052631579

If you are not familiar with Deadpool it might be a shock to system.  There endless bad puns, tasteless joke, and violence. He is the true anti-hero.  He does not do good for the sake of being good. It just happens along the way.

If you are member of political correct movement this movie is not for you.  This pick on every stereo type out there.  To be fair they did pick on everyone.",1471305600,,600,4.303571428571429

7631760,5,B01BDUS0NY,"And I've been a big Marvel fan since the early sixties. Pretty much anything Marvel. I also like DC a lot, so I was hesitant to get this after seeing what Ryan did to Green Lantern (which he admitted in the movie). But the good reviews persuaded me to try and I'm glad I did. I laughed til my jaws hurt. In the process, I also was able to free myself of excess gas, a side-effect of hard belly laughing. So if you decide to watch this, avoid gassy foods like beans and dairy, unless you're alone, in which case it depends on whether or not you can tolerate your own bouquet.",1470787200,2,574,4.133928571428571

7631775,5,B01BDUS0NY,"I've never read any of the comics but I knew enough to know that the portrayal in Wolverine: Origins was bad.

I am really glad they rebooted it using Ryan again. This movie was awesome. It was hilarious, from the first few seconds to the last few seconds. They made jokes about Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, Wolverine, the X-men, the budget, the Stan Lee cameo, and of course, the fourth wall.

If you are a Deadpool fan, you loved this movie. If you are a fan of action and humor, you loved this movie. If you are not a fan of the internet and were one of the people that thought this would be a good movie to take your kids to ... you were probably in the minority that didn't like this movie.

The studios are getting very crafty at hiding ultraviolence behind a quip or a joke, and having us laugh our way through splattering heads and guts. It's clearly desensitizing our brains to accept blood and guts as a part of life, a rite of passage. Why wouldn't a kid think it's ok to shoot up a school after a childhood of watching things like this? The amount of homicides in the country this year alone, one might think someone might intervene and stop some of the gratuitous comic violence that's shaping young minds.

7632014,4,B01BDUS0NY,"Wasn't really expecting this to be more of a comedy even though maintaining all the elements of an action Movie.  Despite all the crude language and associated references, this is a movie taken for its intended entertainment value.  The concept of ""Deadpool"" is not what I expected yet enjoyed the connection between Wade/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) and his bar-tending sidekick Weasel (TJ Miller).  Fights scenes are pretty much as expected and expose weakness elements leading to the finale.  I could also classify Deadpool as a Romantic Comedy in a twisted sensitive sort of way (Reminded me of Spiderman).  Will be interested to see how they put the sequel Deadpool 2 together and how it will be casted.

NOTE TO BLU-RAY USERS:  This DVD contains advanced play features which requires very current firmware to work.  I tried on 4 DVD players before I was able watch the movie.  So if you have an older DVD player, you may need to update your firmware before watching.  Guess it is associated with new Blu-Ray formats.",1470441600,,1018,4.900584795321637

7632079,5,B01BDUS0NY,Ryan Reynolds finely found a super hero he was meant to play.  Green Lantern didn't work out for him but his style matches perfectly with Deadpool.

In this movie, he's out to get the villains who hurt him, so it's a little difficult to see him as a superhero yet. The language and jokes are definitely for mature audiences only, as they are crude, vulgar, and frequently sexual in nature. There's also a scene in a strip club that includes nudity inappropriate for kids. But if you're OK with that type of humor, it's laugh-out-loud funny!",1470096000,,557,4.9361702127659575

7632132,1,B01BDUS0NY,"I found the mindset depressing. Even if you are a 12 year old boy, or enjoy the same pleasures as a 12 year old boy, the pleasure ""Deadpool"" takes in his own kinkiness and cruelty is akin to Orwellian despair. I do understand the 5-star reviews because _if_ you are a fan of the comic, and if you are a fan of Ryan Reynolds, and if you are a fan of - not black humor but soul-less humor - then this movie should be right up your alley. As the other reviews note, this movie is not for children. It is fast paced and smart-assed, with much generic CG color-coded into an X-man style universe where only three types of people exist: ""bad guys""; ""wise asses"" and ""dweebs"" (the rest of us). Enjoy at your peril.",1470009600,12,707,4.205882352941177

Deadpool is one of those movies that I really liked and have seen twice now, once in the theaters and then I rented it again. So that should say something about the movie.

I don't think I  can say much that hasn't been said already but it's not for kids or adults faint of heart.  There is way too much swearing for the easily offended.  If you can get past that though the movie has action and (offensive) comedy.  What more can you ask for.  The entire film takes a side view of itself with much self-deprecating humor all around.

Personally, I found them all to be like Dane Cook having a bad night onstage in 2005.  He's simply trying way too hard for my tastes.  Even the best stand up comedians knew there was a limit to how much bodily humor and profanity any audience could stomach.  It wants to be a good action film but it's impossible to truly care about anything that happens.  It wants to be a good parody but the jokes are so obvious and superficial that any 1970's MAD magazine would be funnier.  I fully expect millions of people to purchase the blu ray, dvd, or download and wonder why they liked it so much the first time.  This will one day be recognized as the moment comic book films jumped the shark.  I understand exactly what they were trying to accomplish.

It's a fun movie that, to both its detriment and benefit, is a bit by the numbers in terms of plot. It's a revenge film.

7632478,5,B01BDUS0NY,"We rented this as a late night movie and it was good enough that I stayed awake the entire time.  (I will usually fall asleep to tv even if I am enjoying the show.)  It was hilarious.  Completely inappropriate, so if you don't like crude or vulgar humor, I would avoid. My husband was in tears during the bridge scene where Deadpool tries to fight Colossus.  It was refreshing that to have a super hero who really wasn't a super hero, but was still an evolved character and 'likeable' with his faults.  They used the fourth wall fantastically--to belittle Ryan Reynolds, the x-men universe, Hugh Jackman, etc.  Reynolds was perfect for this role and all the characters fully committed to the obsurdity of it all to really make it enjoyable.  I could see not enjoying it if you didn't know what it was about before watching--but the movie delivers on exactly what it promises.  I haven't read the comics but if you have at least heard the name Deadpool, then you should have an idea of how he operates.

The ONLY downside is that my husband has picked up some of the insults and tries to use them :)",1469491200,,1098,4.477386934673367

My husband, myself and our 17 yr old teen rented this movie and we thought it was hilarious but fair warning, within 10 minutes of it staying there was some graphic violence.

I guess everyone that gave this movie 5 starts like that kind of thing.  There were a few amusing scenes, however I felt like this was a low budget movie about violence and vulgar language.  The critics gave Green Lantern a poor review and gave Deadpool a great review.  I will vote for Green Lantern over Deadpool any day of the week.

Caught it twice more in the theatre and the first time on Amazon Instant Video bright and early at 7AM on the day of it's release.

Ryan Reynolds was made for this role. He owns it. His love interest is a fantastic bad girl to his very, very bad boy. The writing is masterful. Every chance to engage the audience is taken and taken cleverly.

This is NOT a movie for children or anyone who is: easily offended, grossed out by blood and violence, prudish about sex and crude humor, or just generally has a stick up their tailpipe... As I am none of these things, this movie was tailor fit for me.

My husband, however, is a huge fan, so after many days of pestering me to watch, I finally did.  I can't even describe how hilarious this movie is from start to stop.  It's incredibly violent, but the writing and acting are so well done, the violence is comedic instead of disturbing and grotesque.  Hard to grasp if you haven't seen it, so watch and see.  Truly a movie to watch again and again....I do!  Ryan Reynolds is an amazing Deadpool...who knew?!  I can't wait for the next movie to come out.",1469232000,,594,4.485981308411215

7632704,5,B01BDUS0NY,"This is the movie Ryan Reynolds, so often miscast as snarky, self-aware characters in other action movies, was born to star in. From the irreverent credits at the start of the movie to the on-going comments directed to the moviegoer (he doesn't break the fourth wall, he demolishes it), this movie blasts all the superhero movie cliches to pieces. Serving as his own narrator, Reynolds inhabits the role of Wade Wilson, a smart-mouthed, low-budget mercenary, who suddenly finds true love with Vanessa, a prostitute (played with quick-witted zeal by the beautiful and underrated Morena Baccarin), and then is diagnosed with terminal cancer. In Wilson's efforts to find a cure, he goes to an underground ""doctor"" who turns out to be using hyper-dangerous techniques (with a high fatality rate) to attempt to force people to evolve into metahumans with superpowers who he then sells as slaves to whoever has the money. Wilson is cured, develops a Wolverine-like healing factor, but with the side-effect of causing his skin to look like ravioli - so he's out for vengeance.

But the plot is almost irrelevant to this movie - it's Reynolds (now in the requisite superhero costume and, in a clever twist, adopting the title name) and his character's ability to find the absurdity in almost any situation in this film that makes it work. Whether it's showing a piece of paper with a crude cartoon figure of a man to a bad guy and asking if he recognizes him or announcing he's almost out of ammo to his opponents as he brings down several with one bullet (""...so you'll have to share!""), it's often uproariously funny. This movie is filled with foul language, more (simulated) sex than you've seen in a superhero movie, tons of over-the-top violence and as much bad taste as they could stuff in its running time so it earns its ""R"" rating. Leave the kids and sensitive souls at home. sit down and enjoy the action, humor and snark!",1469232000,,1924,4.812688821752266

7632735,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Just when you thought you'd seen every kind of superhero movie. Enter the long awaited Deadpool. Amazingly written, hilariously acted and stunning visuals, bringing a different brand of dark humour to the Marvel X-men world. Even my friends who don't like Super hero movies really enjoyed this fresh take on a coveted and very individual character.
Poking fun at a large host of already established marvel characters throughout the film alongside real life actors (Especially Hugh Jackman), the humour is none stop as Deadpool tears up the city looking for his tormentor, coupled with his dark yet still humorous origin story.
Ryan Reynolds does a bang on job and suits the character to a tee, having pushed to do this film since his terribly received appearance in Wolverine: Origins, its great they finally buckled in and helped him tell the story that he wanted to tell about Deadpool. And in return they've just opened up a huge new franchise possibility that will be firmly and successfully around for years too come.",1469145600,,1022,4.982456140350878

Graphic gore, incredibly raunchy jokes, and more Ryan Reynolds nudity than a straight male would want to see in a lifetime. If I gave a brief overview of some places they went with the gags, this review would be NSFW. I'm surprised they kept it R instead of X.

It's ridiculously funny in ways I've never seen in a movie before. And it came out at the perfect time, when people are getting tired of the superhero movie clichs. This movie will probably start the next wave, showing superhero movies don't have to be vehicles for selling toys to kids, but can actually be for adults, too.",1469145600,,706,4.4728682170542635

I hate to point out flaws in what is probably my new favorite movie, but he had 2 50AE Desert Eagles and said he only had 12 bullets. I can't remember if he racked the slides before shooting or not, but if he's a mercenary, I can't imagine why he wouldn't keep one in the chamber and top up too. Either way, 50AE Desert Eagle magazines hold 7 rounds, so he should have had AT LEAST 14 rounds, but almost certainly 16. That has bothered me every time I see this flick. He should have used 44mag Desert Eagles. Those hold 8 rounds, giving a possible 18 total rounds. With that many, no one would have had to share. And let's not forget the savings on ammunition alone.

7632762,4,B01BDUS0NY,"I have read a number of the comic books because I am a huge Brian Posehn fan (comedian and current writer on the Deadpool book). Despite being fully prepared for the foul language (some of which was very funny and clever), the violence (visually stunning, like a Jackson Pollock painting all in red) and the sex (something I don't typically look for in comic book films), the movie just didn't work well for me. If you strip away the foul language, super-graphic nature of the violence and the unneeded sex scene(s) you are left with a trite and predictable action film that really fails to deliver anything interesting.

If you are a really big fan of the comedic style of the Deadpool comic books, or you are just someone that considers themselves impossible to offend and you like action films, then this is probably for you. If you are a big fan of the superhero genre and you are really excited that Marvel has put out a series of Avengers movies and tie-in movies that form a complex fantasy world with intersting characters and some symbholic meaning and social commentary behind the plot. . . do not expect the same from Deadpool.

Despite the appearance of a couple of B list X-Men in the film, which served only as fodder for Deadpool's potty mouthed chaos, don't expect any big X-Men tie-in for Deadpool 2. It just can't happen. It would have been nice if they used at least one character from the X-Men that had some recent screen time.

To close, this film was genuinely funny and irreverent, but at its core it is a middle-of-the-road action film with a paper-thin plot. If you told a friend what this movie was about, it wouldn't sound interesting at all. It is in all the details of dialog and visual effects that this movie earns what I consider to be a generous 4 stars.",1469059200,,1788,4.546583850931677

""you can do it, Barry!  Run Forrest Run!""  There's no monlogues on the nature of heroes (at least not by deadpool) and none of that No Killing bs, even for the evil supervillain who'll inevitably escape.  And did I mention there's no girlfriend constantly stroking his forehead and tucking him in at night!!  How in the living hell is this an actual character in the Marvel universe?!?

The guy earned a lot of respect from me.

Deadpool is everything any other ""Superhero"" isn't.  He's gross, perverted, swears like a sailor, and those are his good points.  Best of all, he makes a mockery if so much you cannot help but he amused.  Face it, Reynolds is a hoot and makes this movie far better than it likely would have been with anybody else in place.

You can tell it's going to be irreverent from the start.  The moment the credits start rolling, so were we.  LOVE IT!",1468800000,,1021,6.163120567375887

Graphic violence, gratuitous sexual humor, and a lot of cursing.  It's NOT a feel-good or dramatic superhero movie to rent or buy for your adolescent or even teenage children.

Absolutely hilarious!  A great movie with a fair amount of action and a lot of blue humor.  Really enjoyed it and I'll be more than happy to watch this several times in the future!  My warning might be longer than my review.... if you like blue comedy, violence, and cursing, then this is the movie for you!  Ryan Reynolds is the perfect person for the role, they make plenty of tongue-in-cheek references to other superhero movies, etc., and it's just a lot of fun to watch.  You'll be laughing a LOT and the love storyline that follows along in the background works pretty well.  Again, NOT something for kids to watch... You've been warned by plenty of people by now, I'm sure, but for the love of everything holy do not rent/buy this thinking your kids are going to be seeing The Dark Knight Rises or The Avengers.",1468800000,,1137,4.534313725490196

I mean, ever since the Dark Knight came out, everyone is trying to ""out dark"" Batman. The Dark Knight was an exceptional movie, but the studios have fallen into a rut trying to imitate the bleak tone.

The movie is wonderful, full of excitement and action, there are some sex scenes at the beginning and innuendo going on but that's deadpool.

And this movie brought the best of Deadpool to the screen. I don't think there's one thing I'd have changed about the movie, honestly.

I will say that the humor, violence, and theme of this movie are just as graphic as Deadpool's own nature. And it's so refreshingly charming and honest compared to other major ""superhero"" type movies out and about right now.

7633009,4,B01BDUS0NY,It's been a long time coming but we finally have an R rated comic film that has mass appeal. Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool but his characters are always pretty much the same anyway. The time and effort put into the film is obvious and inspirations from the Marvel Comics Universe are very deliberate. The action was great and the comedy lived up to the Deadpool legend.,1468713600,,379,4.507246376811594

I guess the intended audience was teenage boys, but that would be an insult to teenage boys I think.  I don't object to vulgar language if it has a point.  The only point of it in this movie seemed to be to get a four letter word in every piece of dialog.  It was supposed to be a comedy/action movie.  It lacked both.

Deadpool is not a hero.  He will tell you that himself (literally).  Nor is he the villain.  The villains, however, are exquisitely villainous.

If you have not heard about the opening credits yet, then you have not been paying attention.  Pay attention.  You will be rewarded.

The question ""Cuddle?"" might take on a whole new meaning for you.

A decade ago, he might have doing movies Like The Mummy or Looney Tunes Back In Action. Two decades and it might have been Kindergarten Cop or Tremors.

The film is only comedic if you are pre-adolescent and find humor in vulgarity.  Although we expect some departure from reality in a superhero film, this one is beyond credulity.  It consists mostly of fights and scenes of mass destruction, both of which are repetitive and become boring.  The acting is forced and clearly not a strength of the film.

This is literally the only superhero movie I actually have wanted, besides Azrael, which will unfortunately never happen due to Nolan's stupid ending to his Batman franchise (which I otherwise loved).

Anyway, I basically got this for the cut scenes and bloopers, and it was worth it for those reasons.  SPOILERS ALERT So, for instance, I was unaware that the whole vendetta took him 5 years to complete!!  That makes so much more sense, not sure why they cut it from the movie.  END SPOILERS But, on that same note, they had some pretty dark scenes that they cut, which I can understand why they did it.

7633102,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Having been a fan of Ryan Reynolds going all the way back to him being in ""Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place"" I expected good humor. Being a fan of DeadPool (especially when he fights with Wolverine) in the comic books, I expected the movie to be intense. What I did not expect, was a movie I would watch over and over. I love the action scenes with the slowed down, almost Matrix-like movements. Then add the comedy. A++++ in my book. All of the hidden references to other Marvel movies and things found only in the comic books were great. It amazes me that movie studios passed on this for so long but yet the same studios insisted on a Ben Affleck Batman. This movie is really not for kids. The references are to things from the 80s. For a 40-something, DeadPool is nostalgic enough to warrant a return to old issues of X-Men and Wolverine but modern enough to display exciting action. I honestly cannot wait to see what Ryan Reynolds will do next, as long as it is not Green Lantern 2.",1468627200,2,991,4.304812834224599

7633134,3,B01BDUS0NY,"Dead pool was a good way to wade into the waters of making a hard R-rated comic book movie. For the most part is really succeeds mostly on the shoulders of Ryan Reynolds and TJ Miller, whom i normally cannot stand. The movie worked very hard to keep neophytes keyed into the character's backstory via many flash back sequences and there are a lot of snarky comments about not being able to afford the actual X-men to appear in the movie. What I did not care for too much was the romantic subplot it just did not work for me and unless it is a major part of the comic or something which i confess i have not read should not have been included. The only other thing that bugged me about the movie was some of Deadpool's jokes were really dated. As most of you know the story bounces back and forth from present day to the past regarding one Wade Wilson, one time Mercenary who meets and falls in love with a hooker then finds out he has cancer in just about every vital organ. He is approached by a shadowy figure for another shady figure named Ajax a.k.a Francis(a running joke in the movie) Wade thinks he is being recruited to cure his cancer and turn on his super powers but Ajax has other ideas. This program is to turn soldiers into Super Powered, unstoppable killing machines to do the bad guys bidding and to be sold to the highest bidder. Naturally Wade escapes the lab, powers intact after a lab explosion and goes after Francis and his cronies. I enjoyed the movie and with a few minor tweaks think the sequel should be quite solid.",1468627200,,1541,4.335640138408304

7633137,4,B01BDUS0NY,"Ryan Reynolds is back in a tour de force performance in a role that was tailor made for him.

It's a good thing too, especially after the fiasco that was 'X-Men Origins, Wolverine' - which completely butchered the Deadpool character, and his Green Lantern performance, which was less than spectacular (and both of which are lampooned in this movie).

The quips come fast and furious, so you might have to watch it a few times to catch the lines that you missed.

Oh...  Points for including Morena Baccarin, one of the great Sci-Fi hotties of all time, as the Pool Guy's girlfriend!",1468627200,2,582,4.676470588235294

Other than that this movie is funny, in a juvenile way #driveby, and hilarious, in a grown-up dark graveside humor way. There is gratuitous violence, as many fight scenes as you could want, and a love/lust story. I wouldn't set a 10 year old in front of it unless you are willing to answer some questions, happy international women's day . That said my favorite parts are when he talks to the audience because I love when characters are winking at the audience and 4th wall breaks take that to the nth degree.
PS there is little to no connection between this version of Wade Wilson and the one from X-men origins: Wolverine that is not a bad thing, but it's another thing you should know.",1468627200,3,800,4.412162162162162

7633203,5,B01BDUS0NY,"Great movie, I could watch it over and over again. Great writing (by the Real Heroes here), and never once succumbs to taking itself seriously which is what I expect of a Deadpool movie. I would love to see what this creative team could do with Spiderman",1468540800,,254,4.425531914893617
7633204,5,B01BDUS0NY,Well done! Reynolds portrayed Deadpool just as I expected. Effects were good. It was great to see Leslie Uggams. Totally enjoyed it; can't wait for the next one!,1468540800,,161,4.785714285714286

8749926,5,B01BDUS0NY,"I'm not even really into Marvel, but I absolutely LOVED this movie!!  I don't dislike Marvel by any means, just haven't really watched much of them.  Of the few that I have seen, including Deadpool I & II, Iron Man I & II, Thor, Captain America, and Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool is BY FAR my favorite!  Deadpool II ranks at a VERY close 2nd place.  And while there were a couple times throughout the movie in which other Marvel movies were referenced, as a whole, not having seen the majority of the Marvel movies had no impact on my enjoyment and ability to follow Deadpool.  I recommend Deadpool 100%!!",1537401600,,609,4.5

I laughed out loud several times just based on his bad-ass attitude throughout the movie. Great story line, love the main character. Very funny and full of action.
