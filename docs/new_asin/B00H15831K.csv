I liked Airbender but I realize I'm in a huge minority...but the other three are all really classic Children's movies for all young at heart adults as well.
Hugo is a true classic on its own (according to the Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences anyway).  The point is for $15 bucks you get four family films in blu-ray in one set.  Now to the reason for the price.  These are the first discs of the regular sets unless the regular set was one disc only, in which case you get it all!  An added bonus is that The Last Airbender is the 3D disc as well as the regular blu-ray in one.  You can't beat that.

The set includes The Last Airbender (3D too), Hugo, The Golden Compass and Inkheart on four blu-rays.  I have watched them all and the sound and blu-ray transfers are great.  It's all part of Warner's 4 Film Favorite series (which includes the original Batman movies and the Lethal Weapon series on other sets at this same price and other sets you can google or type 4 film favorites into the Amazon search box to find some at equal to slightly higher prices).  I wholeheartedly recommend this set and the other two I mentioned bearing in mind that you're getting the same treatment in all the packages.  There are discs with lots of extras and discs with none but a few if any at all depending on whether they came from two or one disc sets originally.  So if you just love the movies and maybe a few extras then this is for you!!!  I highly recommend!!",1393459200,,1601,4.3830508474576275
8629056,5,B00H15831K,"I am a collector, so I love to save space on my shelves. I already have all of these but Inkheart. However, I was willing to take the chance on this set. What they have done here is put the first blu disc of past sets in one box. You get 4 discs piled 2 to a side on top of each other. I was a bit taken aback when Airbender said it was 3D but the menu has an option for 3D or 2D blu, and the picture is clear as a bell. There are no extras. Tne set I have of Golden Compass has 2 discs with a lot of extras on the second disc. In this set you only get the disc with the movie and the commentaries, but one of the commentaries is Picture in Picture, so there's probably enough here to satisfy. Here again the picture is excellent. Hugo seems to have all the features that are on my original disc, so a real bargain there. Inkheart has features as well. There are no DVD copies to use in the car. So a mixed bag: a lot more features than I expected (I thought they would be a bare-bones set); quality blu-ray and an excellent price - $5.00 or less per movie. Probably because three of these did not do well at the box office and/or disappointed fans of the books, these have been put in sale price set. But I enjoyed all of them and so did the grandchildren. Highly recommended.",1389484800,9,1277,3.972762645914397
