THE MAN FROM GUNTOWN is scripted in part by Thomas Ince Jr. His producer father died in 1924 under mysterious circumstances after a night on W.R. Hearst's yacht. The accepted but unconfirmed story was that Ince caught a Hearst bullet in the belly meant for philandering Charlie Chaplin.

Director Ford Beebe's 55 year career includes two Flash Gordon serials and the original Buck Rogers cliffhanger. Star Tim McCoy was born in Michigan but, influenced by a Wild West show, took a job on a Wyoming ranch after high school graduation. An expert in cowboy skills, McCoy also was fluent in more than one Indian language. Tim's final screen appearance was in REQUIEM FOR A GUNFIGHTER  (1965), which also included western vets Johnny Mack Brown, Lane Chandler, Dickie Jones and Bob Steele.

SYNOPSIS--
In his second PURITAN programmer, Tim is arrested for a bushwhacking he didn't commit. After making a deal with Guntown's sheriff (Clifford) on a two week furlough that allows him to search for the killer, Tim visits the dead man's debt-ridden sister (Seward). She mistakes him for her brother (Lease), so he aids her in opposing a crooked saloon owner (Oakman) trying to take over her ranch.
