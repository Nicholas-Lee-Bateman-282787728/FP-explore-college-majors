8081056,4,B000AYQJBU,"Hellboy is a paranormal superhero film akin to Men In Black by way of some Saturday Morning Cartoons. During the prelude, the notorious Grigori Rasputin, redressed as a Nazi sorcerer - and made famous by the German pop band, Boney M (just kidding), is opening a portal between worlds in order to free some tentacled Elder gods on loan from H.P. Lovecraft (how this will help the Third Reich is uncertain). Fortunately, a squad of `Merakin soldiers and their cigar-chomping sergeant spoil the show, but not before a small CG devil-toddler escapes into our world and the squad's occult expert woos the tot with candy, names it Hellboy, and becomes Hellboy's surrogate father, raising him to fight crime with a Fish Man from the back of a mobile command center disguised as a garbage truck. Eventually, Rasputin returns, murders the occultist (played in his old age by John Hurt) and other things happen.

That may sound ridiculous but it isn't (it's ZANY, he said, with mock jubilation), it's funny, oddly poignant at times, with one or two jump scares, and plenty of super strength-based action sequences. The film probably would have faired better (not that it did too shabby) if it hadn't been distributed on the heels of Men In Black II, a film following basically the same formula, with similar special effects, but an entirely different plot. The comparison wouldn't even be worth mentioning if not for Myers, the annoying protagonist played by Rupert Evans, but I'll get to him in a moment. First, some glad-handing!

Jeffrey Tambor, playing Agent Manning, is the star of every scene he's in, so I'd like to give him special mention since he hardly gets top billing, but Ron Perlman is Hellboy the same way that an apple is an apple. He embodies the character, never seems uncomfortable with three pounds of makeup on his face, and carries himself like he's having one helluva good time.

Okay, so, the skinny. Like in Men In Black, the protagonist in Hellboy is your basic point of view character, an everyday normal guy, in over his head. John Everyman (I mean ""Myers""), is as flummoxed and flabbergasted as the audience would be in his shoes, but also kind, caring, brave (to sum, as the film does for us, pure of heart), and unabashedly boring. I'll spoil the sequel: the studio, the producers, whomever, realized that the audience was interested in Hellboy's antics, not his everyday normal partner (da-derp) and they leave Myers in the lurch, reassigned by Hellboy to some godforsaken snowcapped waste, jealous of Myer's relationship with his longtime, off/on flame (wink, nod, nudge to those that know the story), Liz Sherman (played by Selma Blair. Nothing too exceptional to add there). According to IMDB, Rupert Evans was unable to reprise the role, so the character was written out, but I like my version better.

Aside from Myers, my only gripe is the occasionally weak wire work. The CGI can be rubbery, but since we're dealing with cosmetic-makeup monsters, animatronics, and occasionally rubber tentacles, rubbery CGI fits right in, but there are three moments in my recollections - Hellboy fleeing on a crumbling bridge, leaping over a truck to pursue Samael (a monster of little renown), and Samael tossing Hellboy across a crowded subway platform - where the wire work is less than convincing and Hellboy seems to float ON A WIRE.

If you're a fan of the director, Guillermo del Toro, a fan of Men In Black, or the Marvel movies, I think this would fit nicely on your shelf next to the others. The sequel, The Golden Army, is loads better, so clear some extra space while you're at it.

This particular release is the ""Director's Cut"", reinserting some great footage that had been  left on the floor due to time constraints, and while it does fill in some holes, I'll admit that it begins to chafe a bit around ninety minutes in, when Hellboy sulks and Myers (MYERS!!!) has a crisis of faith...in himself (oy!). The commentary track is worth a listen. You get to hear del Toro dish, gush, and ogle his own work, and he seems pleasingly tickled by all of the bits of his imagination that have been brought to life. There are other features too, so check'em out.

And for those care, Hellboy does NOT pass the Bechdel Test.",1370908800,,4244,4.796169630642955
