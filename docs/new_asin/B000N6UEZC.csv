2757194,5,B000N6UEZC,well i finnaly got it today i also own the other two boxsets and this one was just as good as the others it starts right in the forest of death and ends right before the sudden death eliminations the perfect place to end in my opinion just like the other box sets you have the options of watching it in japanese with english subtitles or you can watch it in english with subtitles as well so you can see what they say in the japanese version while watching it in english perfect the album art on the inside of the box is also very nice if your looking for an addition to your naruto collection this is the boxset for you,1180569600,3,620,4.090163934426229
2757195,5,B000N6UEZC,I've bought past Naruto boxed sets from different anime sites and these are by far the best ones. The subtitling is very good and almost the same with the fan subbed versions. I wish they would release more boxed sets so they can at least catch up with the series. Naruto:Shippuden series is getting better and better. For anyone who is looking to buy boxed Naruto sets I would strongly suggest theses.,1179446400,4,402,4.597222222222222
2757196,5,B000N6UEZC,"I still don't really know which episodes are going to be featured in this box set, but i just hope that they make it all the way to the battle scene between sakura and shion, or atleast that's who i think she fights...sorry if im wrong, and the one where sakura cuts her hair....i still don't know how or why she did it, she looked better with longer hair, but any way i just hope it makes it that far cuz i don't think i can wait till august 29th i believe it is till the fourth box set comes out and i miss alot of episodes cuz of work & school so this is the only way i can somewhat keep up with the anime, and Naruto all the way!",1178928000,,633,3.8396946564885495

At the beginning of the Chuunin exam's Stage 2, we first meet Orochimaru and learn his designs on Sasuke.  Hopefully, it will go as far as to include the episode where he finally wakes up in Curse Seal Level 1 and thrashes Saku.  Way cool.  If not, I can't wait til Vol. 4!",1176940800,2,391,4.16

2757507,3,B000N6UEZC,"Been watching this on Prime instant, and maybe I'm in the minority, but this show pisses me off. This show has (imo) way too much filler. It's plagued with a lot of unnecessary inner monologue, flashbacks that I just don't care about, recaps that aren't needed, and recycled ""reference"" footage from previous episodes that simply don't need to be there if you've been paying the slightest bit of attention. I feel like 3/4 of this show is filler to buy time and drag out the episodes. The writing treats the viewers like they are all stupid. It's rife with reduntant and recycled exposition of information that is already known, continually beating you over the head with it. Some of the battles drag on way too long... ""but that's impossible""... ugh. This guy is more powerful, but no, the OTHER guy is ACTUALLY more powerful! Except this guy is DEFINITELY more powerful, until the other guy is SECRETLY MORE POWERFUL!!! This is why I never watched DBZ, but at least in this show I'm actually interested in some of the characters and want to see where they go.
I do really like some of the characters, and it's interesting to see their arcs and how they grow. The story is ok, but I find myself skipping through most of the scenes just to see the turnout, as the filler parts are, again, unnecessary and frankly not interesting enough to watch. If you cut out the redundancies, each episode could seriously be cut down to 5 minutes.
I know this anime is old at this point, and probably considered a classic, but there are many, many more shows that have much better pacing out there. I'm probably not going to watch much more of this one.",1413763200,,1639,4.578231292517007

This is where I made up my mind that I would put naruto at the same level as dragon ball z. This is where naruto starts to show you just a glimpse of how awesome the battles are going to be in the show. In this season its just the tip of the iceburg. the only thing I do not like about the majority of the show is that they clearly show how special sasuke is and how naruto is not as talented as him. But I guess it had to be like that I like that they show how naruto started with nothing and worked hard to become a very powerful ninja.

I have to say that, unlike Naruto Uncut Box Set 2, this set is more enjoyable to watch; the story isn't being stretched out a ridiculous amount, so it actually progresses at a decent pace.

The first extra included in this DVD set is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of ten pages, and all ten pages are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is also ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode thirty-three.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.  These are the exact same English version of the credits that appears on the first two DVD sets of Naruto.  This, of course, means that there is no bed music to accompany the credits, so you just watch text crawl up the screen in complete silence.

There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 4, which runs a little over three-and-a-half minutes.  A link labeled ""Shonen Jump Home Video"" is a link to three trailers: Bleach, Hikaru no Go, and One Piece.  The ""Shonen Jump Magazine"" link includes an advertisement for Shonen Jump Magazine, an advertisement for the Naruto manga, and two advertisements for other Shonen Jump manga titles.

Just like the first two box sets, I was rather disappointed with the special features included on this set.  While I basically knew to expect these extras, since they're the same kinds that are on the first two sets, I kept hoping that perhaps Viz Media would go to a little more effort with the extras this time.

If you're a Naruto fan and want to collect the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 3 would be a good addition to your DVD library.",1234828800,,1888,4.647590361445783
2757882,4,B000N6UEZC,This item is great and I acually paid the price for it.  Then I about kicked myself when I found this at Walmart for $24  oh well,1231459200,,129,3.740740740740741
2757923,4,B000N6UEZC,"Since I first read the Naruto manga a few years ago, I was taken in by the excellent storyline and action sequences.  It quickly became my favorite manga / anime.  The DVDs themselves are good, with both the english and japanese languages, with english subtitles, of course.  While lacking special features and being slightly expensive, I still love this Boxed set.

The part of Naruto that I love is the fact that it usually stays away from being CHEESY.  Any anime that is cheesy or kid- oriented makes me want to puke.  Sure, Naruto and his classmates are kids, but they are ninja. Ninjas kill other ninja- thats just the way it is.

I enjoyed the episode selection in this set in particular because of the epic battle against Orochimaru, and Sakura's struggle to fend off the Sound Ninja.  These DVDs leave nothing out that the episodes that aired on Cartoon Network might have.

All in all, this DVD set is awesome.  The only deduction that brought this to a 4 star review is that it has a large price.  Look out for amazons occasional price drops or find it at a lower-than-50-dollars-price at another store.",1229126400,,1114,4.63265306122449
2757924,5,B000N6UEZC,"Box Set 3 might just be my favorite.  The Uncut releases are still the best to found pretty much for this series or any other.  These 13 episodes generally full of action, drama and are pretty dark.  All the teams who have made it this far must now compete directly against each other to obtain a complementing scroll.  This will allow them access to the tower at the center and let them move to the next round of eliminations.  The best part of this arc is the introduction of Orochimaru and level or seriousness and intensity he brings to the entire series.  His scenes against Sasuke are some of the most memorable throughout the anime and the manga.  And the anime does a great job communicating the fear Orochimaru brings out in his opponents.  Naruto also has some standout moments with and without the help of the Nine-tailed fox.

Another very positive aspect of this arc is the amount of character development and action we get from secondary characters.  The other teams from the Leaf Village and the Sound Village get fleshed out a bit more, and you start to see into the ever expanding world of skills and techniques the ninja have.  While the team from the Sand Village, mostly Gaara, shows how very terrifying they are. In conclusion, this is the best Naruto box set so far, and very good reason to continue with the story.  Basically, if you can't get into this series of episodes, then Naruto probably isn't for you, because this IS what Naruto is about and is the real beginning of many things to come.",1216512000,,1519,4.564575645756458
2757925,4,B000N6UEZC,"This box set contains the episodes which introduce more ninjas with new techniques and brings one of the most important antagonists of the early series into the story.  Also someone gains extremely dangerous power so the episodes are interesting, but not my favorite in the series.  Still a must watch!",1199664000,,302,5.02
2757926,5,B000N6UEZC,"Volume 3 of the series starts with a very humourous introduction that recaps the first 25 episodes due to a ""mistake"" made by Naruto. It then introduces the new opening song... which is a very addictively awesome song. In my oppinion one of the best openings I've heard from any series, animated or not.

Volume 3 takes the viewer into the forest of death where the main villian for the series is first glimpsed in Orochimaru. Volume 3 is also where Naruto begins to let some lesser shown characters take the spotlight. Rock Lee... the annoying little brat from Volume Two becomes an instant fan favourite as he shows his skills and his high morals. And Sakura, finally does something useful while her comrades are out.

Once you watch Volume 3 there is no going back. Naruto will have you hooked!",1199318400,2,797,4.6453900709219855
2757927,5,B000N6UEZC,"It has lots of things that were cut from the series that ran on cable.  Without taking out the things that we are interested in seeing.  Plus there are 12 episodes in this volume spanned over 3 disks and a collectible book for one of the episodes.  Nice pricing, shipping and item received.  Its hard not to be into or get the series.  If you aren't already.  A purchase of this or any other Naruto Uncut boxed set will have them thanking you for buying it.",1197244800,,457,4.255813953488372
2757928,5,B000N6UEZC,"It's the third Naruto box-set. Buy it. Trust me, unless you have a perfect memory, by the time the Naruto series is finished (200+ episodes and counting) you'll have watched it many times to review the 'early days' of the series.",1191456000,,229,4.609756097560975
2757929,5,B000N6UEZC,I am satisfied. My son is a HUGE Naruto fan and he enjoyed the extra footage not shown in the tv version. It added more insight into the characters and also added to the authentic Japanese animation which is always unique and impressive. I look forward to buying him the entire collection.,1191196800,,289,4.576923076923077

If you've never seen Naruto before--DO NOT START HERE....GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING AND START THERE....NOW....SERIOUSLY.

All right, now that that's out of the way, let's move on.  This boxed set spends basically the whole time in the forrest of death.  Let me tell you, Naruto's team gets the worst of it, because the bad guy is after them--of course--. Sasuke has the curse mark put on him, bad guy(Orochimaru) puts another seal on Naruto's nine-tailed fox so Naruto can no longer access it's chakra while fighting, and we finally see Sakura doing some real fighting.  I love the fact that all nine rookies make it through the second part of the exam.  I'm sitting there going, ""YES! You just got your butts kicked by the rookies!""  This set ends in the middle of the preliminary exams, which they are having because too many people passed the second part.  Of course, it ends right in the middle of Sasuke's battle.  (Grumble to yourself and go get the next boxed set.  Better yet, just get 4 when you get this one.)

The first two boxes were very interesting, you know that- unless you should be heeding my warning above about not starting here-but this is where things really start heating up.  And it just gets better from here-I know because I've seen about 100-103 episodes(unfortunately that is all that has aired here in the U.S. -sad face-, if you live in Japan, you might have seen more like 250 or so -jealous face-)

As I have said in, at least most, of my other reviews, buy these sets on sale.  See that number of aired episodes in Japan up there.  250.  Average of 13 episodes in each box.  250 divided 13???  Round it up to 20 boxed sets.  And from what I have read about where that last episodes ends, there will be more.  If you pay 50 bucks for each boxed set, you are CRAZY.  or rich, but still...crazy.  Amazon has pretty good sales around labor day weekend.  I saved around 90.00 dollars by buying the first five boxes on labor day weekend (okay, I only pre-ordered the fifth cause it wasn't out yet).  Save yourself some money.  If they keep on releasing them as they have been, a new boxed set will be coming out about every three months.",1190246400,13,3253,4.68141592920354

2757932,5,B000N6UEZC,"This set contains episodes 26-38 which range from the second part of the Chuunin exam to the beginning of the preliminaries for the third part.  We get to see the introduction of Orochimaru and his curse seal.

I would rate this set above average (each special edition contains a headband, this one of the sound village).  Box set 4 is available for preorder and will prove to be better.",1183161600,2,387,4.579710144927536

8175180,4,B000N6UEZC,I enjoyed the season but is very disappointed that I have to pay for more series after paying a premium for prime,1429747200,,113,4.181818181818182
8175181,3,B000N6UEZC,"I'm sure this will get flagged as not being helpful, but there's no good way to get Amazon's attention on matters like this.  They made it Prime for a few weeks, long enough for my daughter to get interested in it, watch a couple seasons, and then be upset because they took it off Prime.  I'm not going to pay Amazon for the episodes because they decide to renege on having it up as Prime.

But overall Naruto is a good kids cartoon.  It's a little weird at times, and the main character can be annoying, but it has that classic feel that most older cartoons did where you'll want to watch more.  Everything is beautifully drawn with vivid character and animations.",1429660800,,666,4.426229508196721
