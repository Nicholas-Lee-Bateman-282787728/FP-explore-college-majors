2764346,5,B0007VNPDQ,"This is great for we that can remember watching the actual moment when we first walked on another celestial body. This is a GREAT program, getting all kinds of interviews from the most elite club in the world, the men who walked on the moon. Any fool that believes we DIDN'T go there...watch these men, listen to them, look into their eyes. These men were changed for life. They were shown how small we are and how great we can be. This is a must see, take anyone below the age of 40 and get them to watch it so they can see that we as a nation, at one time, were the greatest explorers on the planet. Try not to get angry that we've lost our drive to ""boldly go where no man has gone before"" (sic)",1430438400,2,698,4.065217391304348
2764347,4,B0007VNPDQ,"First off, let me say this DVD is not a mass produced item.  It is made on-demand and recorded on DVD-R disc.  Video and audio quality is not what you would expect for a commercial DVD. It was reproduced from a VHS tape originaly produced in 1995.  Most of the archival footage has been seen before and very familiar to anyone who follows the space program.  The real value here comes from the accounts of the astronauts and mission controllers in original interviews.  Their thoughts and recollections are the best part of this video. And with the passing of Msrs Conrad and Shepard, who were featured in this program, it is important that these astronauts share their experiences with the world while they are able.",1203206400,10,717,4.704
2764348,5,B0007VNPDQ,"I purchased this DVD for my son-in-law who is a major fan of the space program, NASA and any movie/book regarding the space flights.  He was just ecstatic when he opened the gift box and saw what was in it.

I haven't seen this movie myself - just know that I gained major points with my son-in-law by purchasing this for him.
