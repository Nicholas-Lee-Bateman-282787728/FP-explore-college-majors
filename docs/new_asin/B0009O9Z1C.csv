Good, professional acting and Daniel J Travanti is just good! Seen snippets of this first episode but just go and buy. See for yourself. 5 stars!",1455408000,,287,4.142857142857143
8063971,5,B0009O9Z1C,"""Hill Street Blues"" is one of the most pivotal series in television history, not only because it brought a flinty-realism in terms of both the style and substance of the program, but because it proved that a show could survive despite low Nielsen ratings as long as people with large amounts of disposable income were the ones doing the watching. Created by Stephen Bochco and Michael Kozoll, ""Hill Street Blues"" used cinematic techniques associated with the films of Robert Altman (""M*A*S*H""), namely an unusual mixture of drama and comedy that was fast-paced and presented with deliberately choppy editing.  Each episode usually began with morning roll call and ended late at night, with several stories interwoven in between.

Episode 1: ""Hill Street Station,"" (January 15, 1981, written by Michael Kozoll & Steven Bochco) introduces us to beleaguered Captain Frank Furillo (Daniel J. Travanti), who has to defuse a tense hostage situation despite the aggressive inclinations of the leader of his EATers, Lt. Howard Hunter (James B. Sikking) and the uneasy help of gang leader Jesus Martinez (Trinidad Silva). Meanwhile, Public Defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamill) tries to find a client lost in the system and boy are we surprised after watching Furillo and Davenport butt heads all episode long to learn they are secretly lovers. Meanwhile, Sgt. Esterhaus (Michael Conrad), confides to Fay Furillo (Barbara Bosson), the captain's ex-wife, about his intentions towards his teenage girlfriend, everybody is worried that Mick Belker (Bruce Weitz) is going to bite somebody again, and the bickering team of Bobby Hill (Michael Warren) and Andy Renko (Charles Haid) find out that having their cop car stolen is not the worst thing that could happen to them on another bad day on the Hill.

Ultimately, I think ""Hill Street Blues"" did for dramatic programming what ""All in the Family"" did for situation comedies.  I would not go so far as to say that ""Hill Street Blues"" was an outright dramedy (""M*A*S*H"" was the first true dramedy in television history), but it is heading in that direction.  Without ""HSB"" we obviously do not get ""St. Elsewhere"" and ""L.A. Law,"" which in turn means no ""E.R."" or ""N.Y.P.D. Blue.""  For that matter not having ""HSB"" would have prevented or at least postponed HBO shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Oz.""  With ""Hill Street Blues"" television redefined ""adult"" programming, and did so with literate scripts, fully realized characters, and superb acting.  Watching the pilot episode again it does not seem as dated as other programs from that period and it still constitues quality television.  So when is the first season coming out on DVD?  You can save it on you queue at Netflix, but there is no release date yet.  Keep your fingers crossed and, hey, let's be careful out there!",1124582400,3,2812,5.078091106290673
