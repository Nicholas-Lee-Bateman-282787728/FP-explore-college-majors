536520,5,6303019854,I remember seeing it a while ago and I became facinated with Russian history.  This is well worth your money although I would much prefer DVD,1101513600,35,141,4.423076923076923
536521,5,6303019854,"In the annals of TV movie mini-series this one was one of the greatest.  I know that other people that have left their own reviews have made similar comments.  The initial time that this series was shown on television, I watched it from the beginning to end faithfully.  It is based, I think on Robert K. Massie's voluminous tome, Peter the Great, His Life and His World.  I later read the book, which is quite an undertaking, but well worth the time.  This mini-series is, as far as I could tell, is as accurate and true to the spirit of what Peter was trying to do not only for mother Russia, but for himself.  He had many faults, suffered terribly from paranoia, and could be extremely cruel.  Then, on the other hand, had great compassion, and  kindness.  He had no patience with incompetence, whether it was with his own soldiers or the religious leaders.  He wanted to pull, push or drag Russia out from the dark ages and into the light of the new industrial and cultural revolution.  To do this, he knew that he would have to expose his people to the modern world.  He wanted her to be a progressive nation in the new Europe.

This is truly the quality our television is missing today in exposing our people to things we really need to know about.  This mini-series needs to be shown again, and it needs to be available in DVD format for those of us that would like to own it.",1097452800,57,1383,4.372549019607843
536522,5,6303019854,"An international all-star cast appears in this sumptuously detailed epic, which deserves to be on DVD. The original miniseries was much longer than the 6 1/2 hour VHS tape that is currently available, so it would be nice to have the missing footage reinstated. It would also be wonderful to have DVD extras such as cast interviews and ""bloopers"" (hey, I can dream, can't I?).

 Jan Niklas plays the young Peter and Maximilian Schell the middle-aged Peter. These actors are both brilliant and perfectly matched to share the lead role. Helmut Griem gives a strong performance as Peter's close friend and advisor.

 All in all a great moment in TV history.",1091059200,17,653,4.8558558558558556

It is well written, excellent acting, beautiful scenery - filmed on location in Russia - and the music in the background adds to the experience.  I highly recommend this to anyone that loves history.  It is unfortunate that it only aired ONCE on television.  It would be well-worth the networks to bring this type of film back to television - it is a great story for both adults and children (11 and older).",1005955200,14,475,4.552941176470588
536576,5,6303019854,"Highly entertaining biographical film of Peter the Great, chock full of never-ending palace intrigues that are easily followed, thanks to fine acting all around.  For all the well-known actors in this cast, I still like the idea that considerable time was spent on Peter as a boy, brilliantly played by Graham McGrath, showing a bright, highly inquisitive lad who liked practical engineering and saw its value to Russia, but whose young life was already in grave danger at all times.  Including his boyhood helps explain some of his ""paranoid"" (they really are all out to get him) behavior in later life.

This film should have been on DVD years ago; it's now a few tech generations behind.  ( Something Peter would not have liked at all, and someone would have certainly had their head chopped off! ) Time for a good high-definition transfer to Blu-ray now, before that technology becomes obsolete, too.",1397952000,,904,4.927631578947368

But so is the entire supporting cast, especially Jeremy Kemp, Helmut Griem, Ursuala Andress, and Christoph Eichorn. For some odd reason, great TV historical mini-series from the 80's were ignored when DVD's came out. For example: 'Son of the Morning Star' and 'Marco Polo' never made it as well.

536584,4,6303019854,"CAUTION:  Be sure to clarify with the seller whether this is the 3 tape SP set or the 1 tape EP Japanese release, divided into four parts, showing the cast and credits before and after each section.  The mini-series is complete but, of course, suffers in audio and picture quality and at least one rather long section of black screen in part 3.  The best feature of this 6 hour mini-series is the fact that it was filmed (for the most part) in Russia (Communist Russia) in 1986 and that means wonderfully authentic sets, costumes and Russian people in the crowd scenes.  By that, I don't mean that you go away 'humming the scenery' but those elements are very important in telling this story.  When the music used is also authentic (as in the church services), the entire enterprise picks up a few notches.  The Massie book (on which this series says it is based) is a historical narrative.  When the author of the script  for this series has to translate narrative into dialog for the characters to speak, it ultimately becomes fiction and turns the epic sweep of the events depicted into an intimate family drama, albeit in high places. The use of all the familiar 'stars' of the time (1986) to portray historical figures is a distraction, adding little and obviously done to draw in the TV audience, for which the film was originally made and they carry it off very well, considering the havoc that must have reigned behind the cameras. although a lot of rehearsal time was also, obviously, not in the budget for some of the 'stars'.  That said, it is, for the most part, an enjoyable and enlightening way to spend about 6 hours of your time.",1386720000,,1645,4.587030716723549
536585,4,6303019854,"I have read the Massie book on which this mini-series is based.  The book is a narrative, with no attempt at putting words in the mouths of the historical figures.  When that is attempted, as it is here, in this 1986 mini-series, it can take away from the historical 'sweep' of  events and it becomes a family drama, with many events condensed down to a few sentences.  Putting it on a digital DVD would only serve to accent the fact that this was clearly made for TV.  Lay on top of that, a  rather uninteresting and 'soupy' pseudo-I-don't-know-what  musical score and it bogs down even more. The most authentic scenes are the ones in which actual Russian music is used to enhance the action.  The wisest decision was to film the series in Russia which offers real Russian exteriors, interiors and costuming.  The rather dull direction  doesn't help.  The cast does its best with what it is given (Sir Laurence is obviously reading from cue cards) but the use of all the star names is a waste, clearly done to attract the TV audience.  I would almost rather the soundtrack be in Russian, with sub-titles.  All in all, its an interesting 6 hour movie but it should have been so much more.  Buyer beware ... the ad lists this as a three tape set.  Perhaps some of the sellers do offer that but many are selling the Japanese StarMaker  re-release, which has the entire series on ONE tape with the attendant loss of picture and sound fidelity.",1383782400,,1440,4.544747081712062

This is, by far, one of the best historical films of our time.  Ashame that it has almost fallen into history as one of the films that truly deserves a 3 disc DVD treatment.  Maybe HD or Blu-Ray possibly, now that we are in the HiDef Age?

First saw the film, in World Civ. class, in 1990. I thank my teacher, Mr Thompson, for showing it to us. This was the one that got me interested in Russian history.  Read the book, by Massie.  Loved it as well, but be warned- it is very engrossing; take your time.  As the movie goes, the cast is a delight, in portrayal of the characters.  We see a young Peter grow from boy to man to Tsar.  We see him banish his half-sister (Sophia), dispise his arranged marriage wife (Eudoxia), and torture his son (Alexis) to death- all for his personal sacrifice to his land of mother Russia.  But, we also see tender moments with his mistress, Catherine, and love for his mother (Nataliya).  We watch him take his country from backward, and into the modern era (at that time).

A fantastic, wonderful series, with an allstar cast, this movie should be on everyone's list!",1205452800,6,1113,4.401960784313726
536716,5,6303019854,"I saw this television mini-series when I was young. What an astounding epic! It truly does justice to the life of Czar Peter, and the turbulent saga of Russian history itself! In this glorious narrative, see how Peter the Great, through the very force of his imperious will, dragged Russia into the modern age, and ultimately made his land a world power. witness his struggle with another great man, King Charles XII of Sweden, and the war they fought against each other to decide whose nation would dominate the Baltic region. It was a time when empires prevailed...or perished, in the great game of nations. Czar Peter was a man of great drive, intellect, and passion. In his contrasting character, he was harshly cruel and vengeful to those who opposed him, yet he was also kind and generous to those who earned his respect. He commited his share of atrocities, but his enemies would have done the same unto him if they could. He was a warrior-king, who possessed great paternal love for the soldiers and sailors of his army and navy, a force he built from the ground up. In fact, Peter the Great died of pneumonia, after an incident in which he dove into the freezing Baltic sea one winter, to rescue a foundering boat of his troops. This incident alone was an indicator of the true nature of the man. There were not many monarchs in history who would have done this for their fighting-men.
