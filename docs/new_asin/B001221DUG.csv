My teen daughter and I put this on the other night. I usually can give any move the benefit of the doubt and find something, anything worthwhile, but about half way through she says, ""Dad, this sucks."" She was right.

3071392,1,B001221DUG,"Pollyanna McIntosh has received cult-like credit for her awesome portrayal of a feral cannibal woman in the movie The Woman now available on Netflix.  She also showed her above-average acting ability in The 9 Lives of Mara, and other films that she has had bit parts in such as The Acid House.  The Russian operative character she portrays in this movie shows us that she can act even in a horrible movie, and yes, Bats is an awful film.  The idea of flesh-eating bats is not very interesting in itself, and when it is mixed with an unbelievable story line and script it is intolerable.  Shot on a shoestring budget, the military scenes are always cheezy and obviously shot by someone who has no knowledge of military operations.  Sometimes the characters are seen pointing their guns nonchalantly at a buddie's head, totally unaware of what they are doing and showing the director's ignorance of even the most basic gun safety rules.  The bats look like something from a Shrek movie, but are nowehere near as menacing or believable as say, the flying monkeys from The Wizard of Oz. The unforgivable sin is that the bats along with the storyline, characters and plot are flat out boring.  No movie can overcome that deadly combo.  Thank Heaven McIntosh has moved on to better things.",1339891200,,1283,4.747747747747748

3071394,2,B001221DUG,"This movie is very unrealistic, however I like this movie because it reminds me of Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare (not the bats the terrorists). This movie has a terrible story, Russian terrorists are using Bats as a weapon and America is sending in Spec Ops to stop them. This movie isn't completely terrible, the action scenes are moderately entertaining, I mean you won't die if you watch this movie. I've seen this movie twice and don't hate it, but am definitely not a die hard fan. This movie is on the sci-fi channel and if you've seen their movies you know what its like. The effects are just okay but the action scenes are pretty unrealistic.

Now the DVD

The DVD does not have too many extras, in fact all it has is a few deleted scenes. I don't recommend you buy the DVD without watching the movie. (It can be seen on the sci-fi channel).",1283990400,,849,4.367088607594937

The acting is so terrible it seemed the actors and actresses were reading the dialogues from a book! The special effects are like ... NO EFFECTS at all. There's no suspenseful or scary moment either.

It should be zero star. I regret renting this.",1211587200,3,346,4.580645161290323

8243514,5,B001221DUG,"I like science fiction and this provides a good adventure/suspense story, too. Genetically engineered bats are controlled by a mad scientist who used his own blood to create his monsters. Lots of blood, shooting, and some language. Of course, the protagonist is a lone wolf sort of military officer; always in trouble, but brave, handsome, and competent. Survival is the goal, but revenge is second on the menu.",1465344000,,411,5.0588235294117645

8243516,3,B001221DUG,"Released to TV in 2007, Bats: Human Harvest chronicles events after info is uncovered in an Alqueda camp in Iraq on the location of an important weapons specialist, American Dr. Walsh (Tomas Arana). It turns out the doctor has found an alternative funding source and sets up a new research facility deep in the mysterious Belzan forest in Chechnya, Russia, where he is developing weapons and selling them to Chechnyan rebels. A Delta team is sent on a covert mission to retrieve the doctor and his technology before the Russians find him and his lab. What the team soon discovers is that the doctors latest weapon is a flock of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically altered to desire human flesh. The Delta team includes characters played by David Chokachi, Michael Jace and Melissa De Sousa with help by a Russian biyatch played by Pollyanna McIntosh.

This is a sequel-in-name-only to 1999s Bats, which was a conventional nature-runs-amok flick about government-funded mutated bats that escape and harass the citizens of a West Texas town. You have to give credit to Bats: Human Harvest for trying something different. Practically the entire movie takes place in or near the supposedly cursed Russian forest with the various militaristic groups fighting each other and the mutated bats. So theres a lot of action, albeit in a comic booky manner a la Rambo: First Blood Part II. Speaking of the bats, they're more menacing here and there are some close-ups, but they're still a relatively weak monster.

Thankfully, the movie is well made for what it is, a made-for-TV creature feature, and there are plenty of stunning visuals in the forest, the bats, etc. And the soundtrack rocks. Unfortunately, the babe factor is almost zero. Dont get me wrong, De Sousa is an exotic curvy beauty, but shes clothed in military fatigues the entire flick. As for McIntosh, shes definitely an interesting character, but she lacks sex appeal (for me, anyway). Lastly, whereas theres a lot of action and cool visuals the story generally fails to pull the viewer into the events. That said, I DID care when a certain character buys the farm.

The film runs 87 minutes and was shot in Sofia, Bulgaria.

8243519,4,B001221DUG,Another good B movie. This one takes place in an old Soviet Bloc and of course its the Delta Force that saves the day. The ending suggests that there could have been a sequel. I think it never happened because the agent for the bats didn't like the deal.,1433980800,,254,4.204081632653061
8243520,2,B001221DUG,"Russo (David Chokachi) is a loose cannon in Delta Force. Their mission is to go into the forest of no return in Chechnya and capture a US WMD scientist (Tomas Arana). Oh yea. There are daytime flying bats who feed off human flesh and blood. Can you guess the connection? Boy I didn't see that coming.

Made for TV and it shows rather badly.",1428451200,,340,4.3125
