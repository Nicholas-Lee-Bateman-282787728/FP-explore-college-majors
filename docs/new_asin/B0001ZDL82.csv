2046353,5,B0001ZDL82,"IT'S A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY, FULL OF ROMANCE AND A COUPLE (JONATHAN CAKE AND JOELY COLLINS) WITH A GREAT CHEMISTRY.

THE LOVE SCENE IS SO PASSIONATE AND AT THE SAME TIME VERY BEAUTIFUL.

THIS MOVIE DESERVES TO BE SEEING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

IN FACT I LOST HOW MANY TIMES I SAW IT.",1118620800,13,281,4.264150943396227
2046354,5,B0001ZDL82,"The passion between the ""lovebirds"" is so well portrayed that one forgets they are actually acting.. I highly recommend this movie not only because you actually see Jonathan Cake(Regan Montana) with his shirt off (WOW!) but because of the charming cast that worked in this movie. The dialogue is great and the plot is enticing...",1116028800,4,329,5.0
2046355,5,B0001ZDL82,"Claire Barnard has been working as a paralegal for Denny Montana for four years (a playboy lawyer) and caters to his every whim, but he just sees her as reliable Claire. Until one day Dennys older brother (tall, dark) Regan appears in the office, determined to oversee the sale of the Montana Napa Hills vineyard. Regan immediately notices the fact that Claire is the driving force of his brothers' law firm, transforms Claire into a welldressed beauty (what some makeup and a new hairstyle can do!) and tells Claire of his plan to bring her and Denny together. For him it is business - he needs Denny distracted from estate agent Margot so he can convince Denny of his own ideas regarding the vineyard deal - but soon Regan is attracted to Claire himself.

I really liked this romantic movie. It is based on a Diana Palmer movie, but is actually quite different from the book. I believe some DP-fans were outaged about it, but hey, it is a 1998 movie and the book is an oldfashioned 80's romance novel with the overbearing hero and the little mouse/secretary heroine. I for one am happy they made Claire a paralegal with a mind of her own. She is no little mouse, has humor and I liked the chemistry between Joely Collins (Claire) and Regan (a yummy Jonathan Cake). This is romance as you read it in a romance novel, so I recommend it to all romantics. It is a 'Harlequin presents' movie, and I think this one is the best!",1112400000,48,1423,4.494208494208494
2046356,5,B0001ZDL82,"From the very beginning, you pretty much know who's going to end up with who. The older brother is very tall dark and sexy. His indecision, and inability to pick what he wants till the very end makes the tention rise, as he falls for his brothers secratery, who he has agreed to set up with his brother. When his brother and she finaly do get together, he runs in an a jealous rage, BUT STILL DOSEN'T TAKE THE GIRL. It takes some suave moves, alot of romance, and a very HOTT love scene to finally ger the Hero and Heroine together, but You'll love the ride, and never forget the feeling of warmth this movie will leave you with. SERIOUSLY its GREAT!!! Buy it now, Thats an order!!!",1106784000,11,682,4.294573643410852
2046357,5,B0001ZDL82,A feel good movie that has laughter and heart touching moments.  Any lover of romance novels will adore this movie.  Two good looking brothers fight over a smart strong willed woman.  She transforms from plain and frumpy to a ravishing beauty that starts a competition between the brothers.  A movie that can be seen over and over again.,1105228800,7,337,4.758620689655173
2046358,5,B0001ZDL82,I am a faithful reader of Harlequin Romance and this was one of the first movies I saw on TV and I enjoyed it very much and hope that more romance books will be adapted for TV.,1100131200,5,176,3.7837837837837838

8018884,3,B0001ZDL82,The quality of the cd itself was okay.  The movie was consistant with the time period. It was slow at parts but not hard to follow.  Very consistatant and predictable of  movies made by harlequin.  Recommended for thoses looking for a movie with a little romance but looking to keep it light.,1401840000,,292,4.5576923076923075
8018885,1,B0001ZDL82,"What a waste of time.
This book by Diana Palmer is one of my favorites. I loved the characters and how they developed during the course of the book.
This 'movie' didn't do the book justice.
1. They changed the surname from Cole to Montana. WHY? Montana sounds cheesy.
2. Jonathan Cake was fake and over acted the part. The intimate scenes between him and the lead woman looked down right uncomfortable.
3. They changed the heroines name from Kenna to Claire? WHY?
4. Denny and Margo weren't good together. She looked a hell of a lot older than Denny. Their scenes together looked forced and just weird.
5. The dad is dead and in the book he's not.
6. The only parts of the book in the movie is when Regan takes 'Claire' for a make over and the rather uncomfortable 'attraction' between Claire and Denny.

I loved this book and the people who made this book totally butchered it in their adaptation.",1391040000,,898,4.475609756097561
8018886,4,B0001ZDL82,I loveeeeeeeee this movie so much it never gets old a good watch if your that die hard romantic type.,1218672000,2,101,4.1
8018887,5,B0001ZDL82,This movie was the first I've ever purchased from the Harlequin series and I loved it.  The characters and very likeable and the story line is entertaining and romantic.  I can't wait to see what other movies from the Harlequin series I can fall in the love with.,1208908800,,263,4.458333333333333
8018888,3,B0001ZDL82,"Diana Palmer's dismal and dated novel ""Diamond Girl"" is given a new lease on life in a filmed adaptation from Harlequin. About the only thing retained is the first names of a couple characters (the book is set in Atlanta; movie in San Francisco and Napa - but actually filmed in Toronto and South Africa of all places). ""Diamond Girl"" is actually a cute and somewhat romantic movie, but never rises to stellar status.

Claire Bernard (Kenna Dean in the book) is the reliable secretary of lazy lawyer Denny Montana (Cole in the book). She is the obvious brains behind the operation, and when older brother Regan returns from London to assist in the sale of the family's Napa Vineyard, sees an ally in Claire, and hopes to hook her up with his brother so he can concentrate on the sale without Denny's sexy realtor girlfriend getting in the way. But first, she needs a makeover. Of course once Claire's makeover is complete, Regan is finding that he can't keep his hands off her. Featuring Dyan Cannon in the worst wig and more make up than a drag queen, the movie has some great one liners and bantering between the co-stars. That is when Regan is not so sanctimonious.",1186617600,4,1168,4.588516746411483
8018889,5,B0001ZDL82,"What a wonderful movie about a paralegal who does everything for her boss, is taken for granted but finds love with his brother.

For all you romantic women out there looking for a good movie that puts you in the mood for love, here is a DVD perfect for your collection.  How can you resist the story of a woman being swept off her feet by a man who knows what he wants and goes after it - the passion is so subtle that it almost takes your breath away.  This a movie that makes you hunger for the next Harlequin DVD you can get your hands on.

Trust me, if you enjoy romantic movies, if you want see romance on screen or if you just want to be apart of that romantic thrill of seeing, wanting and then having . . . try this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.",1182988800,3,757,4.02
8018890,5,B0001ZDL82,"Finally, I watched a Harlequin turned TV movie that was pretty cute and romantic!! Let me just say that I found out VERY VERY late that the Harlequin series was turned into TV movies. They had the ""Shades of Love"" series done in the late 80's and of course the Harlequin series for the 90's. I watched one of the Shades of Love series, and it was OK, but unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to enjoy it the Shades of Love titles so much anymore. I guess it seems pretty old to me now. (I'm 26) I still have two more 80's tapes coming that I ordered so who knows I might change my mind on the Shades of Love series. Then I watched one of the Harlequin series (A Matter of Marriage and Broken Lullaby) which I also reviewed. They were both alright, but I wasn't really that impressed - yet. Now DIAMOND GIRL. This DVD I actually bought (along with So Hard to Forget which I shall watch later this week!) because I liked the plot and I saw it got good reviews. Well, if you are a Harlequin romance lover, you like hunky men and like cute plots, then you will love Diamond Girl! First off, Regan is EXTREMELY hunky and cute. GREAT body. I thought he personified the mean sorta arrogant (but lovable later) hero type VERY well. Claire is definitely cute in her own way and she I think the actress gave the Claire character justice. She was spunky, perky and a bit sarcastic - which was cute! A definite great match to Regan. Now Denny, the playboy brother - yup - he was perfect too. The way he talked was a bit too, smarmy or syrupy - cant find the perfect word to describe but the Denny actor definitely looked and acted the part. As for the story it was VERY cute. Just like in a romance novel ya know? There were no boring parts, and the sceneries looked great. All in all I RECOMMEND this movie. If your a sappy romance lover, this one is for you!",1143417600,6,1853,4.207865168539326
8018891,3,B0001ZDL82,"The plot is ludicrious and the dialogue far from stellar, but that is not why one watches this sort of thing, is it?

Naturally, beneath her dowdy clothes, glasses and hair in a bun, the young assistant is revealed to be a startling beauty with a figure and face to die for.  While the male lead, one of the most impossibly handsome men alive, is naturally (she says with deep sarcasm) too timid to simply ask her out and instead engages in a series of silly machinations to be in her company.

All in all a nice distraction for an hour or so, but one who wants to see superb romance onscreen might want to rent Casablanca.",1130198400,2,623,4.3076923076923075
8018892,2,B0001ZDL82,"The movie was entertaining but nothing spectacular.  The girl playing the lead was good but the lead male didn't exactly fit my image of a harlequin hero though he wasn't bad as an actor. The movie was suppose to take place in California but was filmed in South Africa which was a poor double for California. if you can get past that, you'll be entertained. Its actually one of the better Harlequin movies I've seen.",1120435200,,416,4.546666666666667
