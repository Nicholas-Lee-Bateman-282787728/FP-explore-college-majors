They are taking pre orders and is more expensive but what will the value of this be in a few years or if you are a die hard fan as I am, will pay.  I grew up with Emergency! and this show help guided me into my future in the fire service.  Enjoy!  Ken",1134777600,6,334,3.7142857142857144
2459989,5,B000CELOV8,"If you watched the Season One boxed set, you might have had a few thoughts.  Do Johnny and Roy look a little rough around the edges on rescues?  Do the staff at Rampart General Hospital seem a little out of place from time to time?  Do most of the characters seem to sound a lot like Jack Webb?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, rest assured, from this point on, the cast and crew of 'Emergency!' will be shown during a period where they hit their stride.  Everyone seems smoother and more comfortable with their roles.  The rescues seem less awkward, and more natural, more like those of rescue workers who rescue people on a daily basis.

The drama is better too!  In the first episode, ""Problem"", Roy must confront his own feelings regarding a patient he feels he loses on the way to the hospital - something I too felt while working as am EMT - wondering what other steps, if at all possible, could he have taken to prevent the patient from dying.

Other episodes deal with the introduction of new paramedics into the program, and the certification they must go through to be allowed to treat the general public.

Emergency! was a great television show, one that has yet to be matched for realism and drama.  Knowing that all of these rescues came from the log books of the Los Angeles County Fire department, and that there was a LACoFD advisor on the set who was to ensure that all of the actions being taken on each rescue were done as it would have been done in real life, Emergency was as close to ""reality TV"" as you could get in the 1970s!",1134259200,,1564,4.377162629757786

2460072,5,B000CELOV8,"I vaguely remember this show as a kid, mostly by its title, though I certainly didn't remember specific episodes, being knee high to a grasshopper, so everything that's old is new again, as they say.  And surprise, surprise!  There's action, never a dull moment, genuine peril (seemingly with the actors as well, who seem to do their own stunts more than expected), and a touch of humor.  And, wow, John Travolta as a teen, Deidre Hall (""Days of Our Lives"") as a nurse, and the cameos keep coming!  Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe click as firefighters/paramedics (and as what could be construed as one of TV's earliest bromances), as well as the rest of the cast, and they make you care about them and their extraordinary day-to-day lives.  If you've never seen the show, ""Emergency! Season Two"" is most recommended because you get the most minutes of content for your money, more than any other season, not to mention an excellent DVD transfer.  Highly recommended, especially for fellow old-schoolers!",1399680000,3,1006,4.923076923076923

Although I watched this series as a kid, I had forgotten how many serious issues were tackled by this show and was impressed by how realistically they were handled.  It made me think about how watching this as a young kid influenced the decisions I made later as a teen.  Also made me think that maybe if we had more shows on like this now or had in the past 10 years, maybe some of our teens would be making better decisions now.",1396051200,3,526,4.24

I love this show a lot and would recommend it to anyone who loves classic shows. The only bad thing is the double sided discs I was worried about getting fingerprints all over them, and scratching it,  but I can live with it, and just be careful. I haven't had any disc issues yet so fingers crossed I won't have any issues. Can't wait to own the other seasons!!! Station 51 10-4 KMG 365. :)",1391299200,3,627,4.131147540983607
2460080,3,B000CELOV8,"When lives are on the line, the Emergency! team is there and ready for action. Reunite with Squad 51 and the heroic staff of Rampart Hospital in all 21 gripping Season 2 episodes of this pioneering series that was the first to show the real-life drama of being an EMT.

From mysterious widespread viruses to dangerous overdoses to a treacherous gas explosion, there's no crisis too tough for brave Los Angeles County Fire Dept. paramedics Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) and Johnny Gage (Randolph Mantooth). With their trademark wit and humor, they're always ready to race to the scene of LA's most dire situations.

Along for the ride are some of TV's most popular stars, including Dick Van Patten, John Travolta (Welcome Back Kotter), Deidre Hall and many more. From legendary producer Jack Webb alias Sgt. Joe Friday on DRAGNET comes the incredible second season of EMERGENCY! - the TV show that broke new ground for all action series to come.

2460083,2,B000CELOV8,"I am not sure how to rate this. As far as Emergency! is concerned, of course it gets 5 stars, but, the quality of the discs? I couldn't even watch disc two. It skips, it stops, and it just doesn't play. The other discs work well, just not the second disc. I almost sent the whole thing back, but, after reading a lot of reviews, I realized I might not have any better luck with another one, and since only one disc was bad, I counted by blessings. I really would love to be able to watch the episodes on that second disc, and am keeping my hopes up that I might get a VCR, or computer, one day that will play it.",1386547200,,612,3.983739837398374

2460128,5,B000CELOV8,"There are so many shows I loved as a kid.  I have revisited many of these shows years later and found myself scratching my head in dismay that I could have EVER actually liked that!

Then you have EMERGENCY!

I was in grade school when I loved this show.  I watched it religiously.  Now fast forward 40 years into the future.  I haven't watched EMERGENCY since the 1970's when it first came out.  I have forgotten all the episodes and story lines.  It's like I'm watching them all again for the first time.

I was a big fan of ER.  You would think after ER with all its quality and realism, EMERGENCY, a spin-off show from ADAM 12 (Remember THAT???) wouldn't even remotely compare.  That's what I thought.

Ok, granted, the show is dated.  You can't get around this fact.  There were no computers then, or cell phones.  Digital did not exist.  Everything takes longer.  Even the phones are DIAL phones, not even the button variety.  The cars all look like boats--it's laughable.  The first season the ambulances look like white hearses.  The hair styles...everyone looks like they just emerged from a hair salon--the men too.  The nurses are all female with the funny paper hats, and most of them obviously wearing false eyelashes.  There is no swearing.  In the first season not one single person dies.  The dialog is laughable in some places.  And yet....

One thing that's cool about EMERGENCY--you're looking at real fires.  Some of the scenes are actually quite amazing when you consider when this show was filmed.  EMERGENCY simply WAS the ""ER"" of its day.  It was the best television could offer, and in my view, ahead of its time.

By Season Two we see a bit more modern style vehicles.  The ambulances look more like they do today, and so do the fire trucks.  But people die sometimes.  You have that little bit of added realism.

Strengths that carry through every season I've watches so far-- EMERGENCY is character driven.  I defy anyone to try to watch this show and not fall in love with firemen paramedics Johnny and Roy, or laugh at Chet Desoto's practical jokes, or feel along with the head nurse Dixey. McCall.

ER was great, but EMERGENCY did it first.  ER probably wouldn't have been what it was without this founding show which demonstrates the importance of strong, multi-faceted, FEELING characters.

You will be transported back in time in EMERGENCY.  After you get through Season Two you will be used to the outdated styles of clothing, cars, technology and mentality.  In a way Emergency is a time capsule in that respect.  The 1970's get to live again.  And though every now and then you'll be brought up short (when it comes to the attitudes/portrayal of women back then especially), much of the time you will forget the outdatedness of the show because you will be so caught up in the STORY.

I am again, to Season Four and so far not one story hasn't been exciting, funny, interesting, moving.  EMERGENCY has still got it.  If you loved ER, you need to experience this show that came first.

As for the quality of the DVDs--they are bar none.  I feel, for the most part, like I'm watching them new again on TV.  Season two, if I recall, has one episode that suffered a little deterioration in its quality--but that was the one exception I have seen so far.

Very HIGHLY recommend.  I'm still a big fan of this show.  I'm guessing now I'll always be.",1354665600,4,3379,4.604377104377105

2460134,5,B000CELOV8,"""Emergency!"" appeared on Saturday nights on NBC for much of the 1970s, and this DVD set contains the 21 episodes that were originally aired from September 1972 to April 1973 during Season Two.

The series follows Los Angeles Squad 51 firefighters John Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy Desoto (Kevin Tighe), as well as nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London) and doctors Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller) and Joe Early (Bobby Troup).  The five are called upon to handle a wide range of emergency situations over the course of the season.

A comment in one of the episodes suggests that paramedics were not widely respected then, but this show demonstrated to the country just how skilled EMT workers are and the wide range of skills that they have.  The show also offered a couple of gentle safety tips for everyday situations without being preachy, and shows how much that doctors, nurses, and paramedics accomplished with the relatively primitive equipment available nearly 40 years ago.

The show attempted to show just how hectic the paramedics' job can be--it tried to portray real life in that they usually had to make multiple emergency runs per episode.  Being a paramedic is a stressful job that involves some ethical decisions, and the characters are shown to struggle with wondering whether they did the right thing and made the right call.  ""Emergency!"" is entertaining and a reminder of how much society can be thankful for the brave people who are willing to serve as paramedics, nurses, and doctors.",1341100800,2,1504,4.992

2460148,4,B000CELOV8,"In the first full season of the series, fireman-paramedics Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) and Johnny Gage (Randolph Mantooth) find themselves faced with a variety of challenges that range from an accusation that they stole $700 from the wallet of an unconscious patient to the problem of extracting a nun and several children from a bus that has gone over the side of a cliff to a ""cooking-challenged"" woman who keeps having silly accidents.  There's always plenty of suspense--medical and otherwise--in these episodes, and humor too, often at the expense of Johnny, who sweats his way through an IRS audit and spars with mustachioed joker Chet Kelly at every turn.  We also learn that Johnny is at least part Indian and was ""raised on a ranch"" and spent a lot of time on the Reservation.  Meanwhile Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller) has become a passionate advocate for the paramedic system and a staunch ally to the guys when they're in trouble.  As Roy and Johnny ""rescue the perishing,"" Brackett and his team, headed by Nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London) and Dr. Joe Early (Bobby Troup), cope with problems of their own, ranging from a man with an array of puzzling symptoms to an explosion and fire in a detached wing of their hospital.  Episodes not infrequently have a topical bent, as when a rather stridently liberationist female reporter comes to the station to follow its personnel through a typical day and immediately makes herself unpopular.  Guest stars range from Dick Van Patten to Jophn Travolta, the latter in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him role as a downed hiker.  Both exciting and fun, this set maintains the promise of the first season.",1306800000,,1650,4.935018050541516
2460149,5,B000CELOV8,I love these episodes.  I will own all of them when it is all said and done.  I watched them when I was smaller and it is what got me into becoming a Paramedic in the 80s.  Don't miss a single episode of a show that started it all!,1295049600,,231,3.673469387755102
2460150,5,B000CELOV8,"The TV show ""Emergency!"" has a special place in my heart for two reasons: the first one being that it was a show I enjoyed watching when I was a little kid.  The second one being that at the same time this show was airing, my father was also a volunteer firefighter, so watching this on TV was sort of a way for me to see what it was my dad did whenever he got called out to go and fight a fire.

Watching this show as an adult, I love it even more!  It's like visual comfort food.

I love the fact that Emergency! was always about people doing their jobs and not about people in the medical and public service professions obsessing about and navel gazing over the goings on in their personal lives.  It would be nice to have a show on the air currently that focuses on these people doing their jobs.  The time capsule angle is also something I get a kick out of, particularly because I'm old enough to remember a lot of this stuff (i.e. when nurses still wore caps and white uniforms, no VCR's, cell phones, personal computers, scanners at the grocery store, leaded gasoline, glass thermometers, etc). I also like how there is enough humor to balance out the seriousness of the rescues.  And I really like the fact that the cast seems to be very tight and they work well together.

The RTV channel airs Emergency! on Monday through Friday, and that is what led me to start purchasing each season on DVD.

I give this series five stars because of the episodes and the acting.  The only nitpicks I have are with the DVD's themselves and how Universal decided to put them out.  I wish Universal would have cleaned up the master copy of the film before transferring it to DVD.  I also am not a fan of the double sided disc (but I am happy that subsequent box sets stopped doing this).  My biggest nit pick, though, is the lack of extras.  I hope that Universal is listening and if they decide to put out the final season of two hour movies, that they also give us extras.  There are so many things that they could have extras about (interviews with the cast and crew, the history of the paramedic program, outtakes, etc).",1274140800,4,2118,4.326582278481013

It's become quite the family event in our house, with both the kids curling up to watch an episode before bedtime.  The other nice thing is that as a young kid, I didn't really get a lot of the story line, so while I may have watched these many times over as a kid and recognize quite a few of the episodes, there's quite a bit of material that's actually ""fresh"" to me.  Randy Mantooth, if you're out there, thanks for the memories -- I'm almost embarassed to say my very first crush as a little girl was on Johnny Gage at the tender age of 4 ;-)  Nicely packaged, DVD is crisp and clear, and NO COMMERCIALS during the episodes, which is a vast improvement over watching them on TV as a kid.  If you enjoyed Emergency during it's initial run in the 70s, treat yourself to the DVDs.  You'll enjoy them all over again.",1201132800,2,962,4.258241758241758

2460192,5,B000CELOV8,"Years ago, we bought some of the Emergency Tapes and I hate lugging them around every time we move.  When I realized we could get DVDs I was thrilled.  Almost everyone I talk to about the set says, ""Oh, I remember that show!  That's what made me want to be a nurse (or firefighter/paramedic)  I didn't know they had it on DVD!""  Of course, part of the enjoyment of watching is the nostalgia factor, but I can't discount the show itself.  As soon as we finished this season, the first thing out of my husband's mouth was ""too bad we don't have any more to watch.""  Looks like I'll be checking into Season Three and hope more seasons come out soon.",1169078400,2,646,4.289256198347108

These are great and I highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of Emergency!",1168905600,2,340,4.074626865671642

2460219,5,B000CELOV8,"The good TV series are the ones that stand up over time. I think ""Emergency"" does this pretty well. Like many series, it ran a season or two over its useful life (after a while, they had done every kind of rescue, and the doctors had treated every kind of ailment). But this DVD, Season 2, finds the series hitting its stride. The characters interact very well, the stories are good -- just a solid action-drama, with some humor sprinkled in.

One more thing: The alert tone that preceded the dispatcher's words was the greatest single sound effect in TV history. I use it for my cell phone ring tone.",1164412800,11,601,4.463636363636364

2460225,4,B000CELOV8,"I have always had a special place for this show while growing-up, especially with my father being a fire fighter. It doesn't hold up to today's medical drama's such as ER, House, Third Watch etc., but you have to realize that for the time frame it was produced in, it was pretty cut edge.  This was the beginning of the paramedics.  The antics of John Gage (Randolf Mantooth) will keep you laughing.  His partner, Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) helped keep John's feet on the ground.  It's also fun seeing all the old cars, trucks and styles of the 70's again.",1154304000,4,554,4.51

You can really see the series and characters mature from season 1 to 2 and I'm on pins and needles just waiting for season 3 (and all the rest) to be released.  If you loved the series the first time, or if you want to see what good, fun TV from the 70's is all about, then order these DVD's!",1153094400,6,543,3.909090909090909

2460230,5,B000CELOV8,"I just love this series. I couldn't believe my eyes when I found Emergency Season 1 and a few months later found Emergency Season 2 were available on DVD. I live in Australia and it isn't available on Region 4.  I quickly checked my DVD player and thankfully it is Region 1 compatable. When the discs arrived, I rang work and said I was sick (shhh don't tell anyone.... hahaha) just so I could stay home and watch them straight away.

It is fantastic to be able to watch a televison show that is serious when it has to be and still has light hearted moments that make you laugh. The characters are well developed and the comaradarie between all the characters is so refreshing.

With all the modern TV programs that are on at the moment that mimic reality too much (such as all the Law and Order series, CSI etc) AND with too many reality TV programs (such as Big Brother, Backyard Blitz, etc), it is great to be able to turn on the DVD player and flip in an episode or two of pure nostalgia that doesn't take itself too seriously.

It is because of this show that I used to watch as a kid that I have become an Emergency Nurse. I can't wait for season 3 to add to my collection! Does anyone know when it is going to be released???

Do yourself a favour and buy this DVD.  To sum up this show in two words: Emergency Rocks!",1147651200,6,1323,4.188976377952756
2460231,5,B000CELOV8,I'm somewhat old fashion and I enjoyed seeing the old shows again.  It has the warmth that is missing from the new shows of today -- glad I purchased it so I can watch it over and over.  The only thing I do not like about it is the double sided disk -- Prefer one sided with the title on the other side.  Maybe when they come out with Season Three they will think about it.  Highly recommended for those folks who like the old times....,1147219200,5,436,4.034883720930233

After watching, I couldn't help but recall fond memories of Saturday nights as a kid, enduring an hour of Lawrence Welk just so I could watch Emergency.  I still get goosebumps everytime I hear the theme music and the ever famous "" Station 51 10-4 KMG365""  The video and audio quality are excellent and I like how there is a synopsis for each episode.  The content of each episode is very plausible.  It's dramatic, yet realistic.  A show way ahead of it's time, I feel it helped set the standard for modern day TV dramas.",1142208000,10,587,4.490566037735849

2460237,3,B000CELOV8,"5 stars for the show; 1 star for Universal's disc quality = 3 stars for this set.

I loved this show when I watched it on a B&W (my parents didn't get color until about 1980) TV as a 12 y/o. I still enjoy it today. It's proof that entertainment doesn't have to be profane and sexual to be thoroughly entertaining. It's amazing how far we've sunk in 30 year.

Unfortunately, this set suffers from poor Universal DVD quality. I've yet to meet a Universal TV DVD set in which all of the discs worked properly. Two of my three discs show no visible defects, but hack up in the middle in most machines. Interestingly, only my laptop computer's DVD player can handle them. I've tried them in several others and they hack up in the same place. It's some sort of very tiny defect that is not visible to my 47 y/o presbyopic eyes.",1141862400,4,821,4.290322580645161
2460238,5,B000CELOV8,"As a fan of Emergency from when it first hit the airwaves, I'm thrilled to be able to own the first two seasons on DVD.  Season two is just as good as I remember it.  It's great fun to see who will pop up in an episode as a guest star or even as a minor extra: John Travolta as an injured hiker; Kevin Dobson as a police officer; Ronnie Troup (Bobby's daughter) as an accident victim.

Now if we could just get some extras for the next DVD releases.  I would love some episode commentary by the actors, directors, writers, etc!  Or how about a documentary on changes in the profession of the paramedic/EMT from the time of Emergency to the present.

UPDATE ON SEASON THREE!!!
I just read a news item that announced the release date for season three.  On February 13, 2007 season three will be released as a 5 disc single-sided box set.  It looks like Universal listed to the fans on this one, since it is switching from the double-sided discs.",1140566400,,943,4.318181818181818
2460239,5,B000CELOV8,"Definitely worth purchasing. Season 2 has many great episodes, and the quality  control on this season seems to be far better than Season 1 (Universal put out many season 1 sets with unplayable episodes). Universal could still do a MUCH better job with the DVDs from this series -- it's absolutely awful that Universal has no extras on this set, despite three of the principal actors and many of the supporting actors still being around. Five + stars for the shows on this DVD, however, not as great on the actual quality, as these are the awful 2-sided disks with no disk art or extra features. Despite these faults, it's still a must-have for fans of the series. Buy this today!!!",1139875200,3,682,4.636363636363637
2460240,5,B000CELOV8,"I was so pleased when Season 2 finally came out that I went out and bought it immeditialy.

2460241,5,B000CELOV8,I just received my Season 2 Emergency on DVD. I am very satisfied. I can't say enough GREAT things about this wonderful show from the seventies. As I stated in my first review on Season 1 it is very family and kid friendly. I just enjoy watching Johnny and Roy and the whole gang. This is a must see for all Emergency Fans. DVD quality is wonderful. Can't wait for Season 3 to come out.,1139443200,5,386,4.16
2460242,5,B000CELOV8,"Well, no playable issues here as was/is with Season One; so far.  I'm still disappointed with Universal's choice of double-sided, non-picture discs but a better choice of packaging with the slim-line cases.

Automatic 5 stars for the series, no question there.  You never know when a fledgling actor (at the time) may pop up.  Anybody spot John Travolta as the injured hiker?

Update: EMERGENCY FIX!
Sadly I've come to my viewing of the last episode of Season 2.  Gleefully, it appears Universal has fixed the freeze-ups with nice clean transfers with very little artifactual trash; and only one Universal graphics intro.  Good job Universal!  Lets hope they keep em coming.  We're over due for more WEBB TV, as in  Season 2 of ADAM-12 and Dragnet.  Sure glad to see that Season 3 of EMERGENCY is on its way!",1139356800,38,808,4.782608695652174
2460243,5,B000CELOV8,"Emergency!, the action show about firemen/paramedics which starred Robert Fuller (formerly of Wagon Train), Julie London, Bobby Troup (author of the song ''Route 66''), Kevin Tighe and Randolph Mantooth debuted in January, 1972 and had its share of kinks. The characters were sometimes too stiff and the scripts too one-dimensional. So in Season 1, you get your share of classic episodes like ''Botulism'' (which deals with food poisoning and a race to save the victims) and ''Brushfire'' (which has some of the series' best fire scenes), but also clunkers like ''Nurses Wild'' (which wouldn't air today because of its chauvinism) and ''Weird Wednesday'' (an entertaining piece on strange things happening in one day, but a theme that wears itself out quickly).

Season 2 is much stronger and offers the following episodes:

Problem

Kids

Show Biz

Virus (one of the series' best as a deadly disease threatens the lives of both Brackett and Gage!)

Peace Pipe (one of the silliest episodes and again too politically incorrect to air today)

Saddled

Fuzz Lady

Trainee (maybe the best episode in the series as Gage and DeSoto must work with Ed Marlowe, a former Vietnam medic on an ego trip)

Women

Dinner Date

Musical Mania

Helpful

Drivers

School Days

The Professor

Syndrome

Honest

Seance

Boot

Rip-Off (an excellent piece where Johnny and Roy are accused of stealing)

Audit

As far as storylines are concerned, this is the season that introduces Captain Stanley (Mike Norell), who gradually becomes one of the stronger characters in the series. We get a ton of great guest stars like Dick Van Patten, Deidre Hall, Melissa Gilbert, Robert Pratt, Robert Alda, Charles Aidman, Jackie Coogan, Lloyd Bochner and many others as the series' TV ratings get stronger, particularly among children.

You get more episodes in this collection than Season 1 and to this point the technical difficulties which hampered the first season DVD sets appear to be resolved.

For kids, this series is a great learning device about firemen, paramedics, hospitals, rescue and safety. For adults, it's a great action show, which should bring back a lot of memories.

In all, a must-have for your video collection.",1139270400,41,2202,5.098039215686274
2460244,5,B000CELOV8,"Like other Emergency! and Randy Mantooth fans I'm thrilled that the series is finally out on DVD. Those of us who grew up loving the show no longer just have our memories to keep us warm. Now we can enjoy it anytime we want. I have to agree that Emergency! was and still is one of the best series on tv. I'll take it over ER any day of the week. I'll also take Randy Mantooth over George Clooney any day of the week too. If you want to see Randy in a great love scene with Delta Burke, you have to get ""The Seekers: The Kent Family Chronicles"" VHS. For all of you who have wondered what kind of a kisser Randy is, this is the show where you'll see it and that is worth the price of the video alone.
