2927155,2,B000UYN9TA,I was very disappointed. Many episodes skipped all over the place. One disc skipped the entire disc. Really sucked!,1407369600,2,115,5.105263157894737
2927156,5,B000UYN9TA,"Well, I got lucky, the discs were indeed scratched like everyone says they are, but mine had very light scratches and after some research on the internet, a bottle of windex and a microfiber cloth I was able to clean them up enough to watch all ten seasons without a single episode having any issues with skipping/freezing. The packaging is atrocious and its almost unfathomable that Amazon continues to allow this to happen to their valued customers... what a violation!!",1405123200,9,472,4.9125
2927157,1,B000UYN9TA,Several were scratched interrupting the ability to play episodes. Seasons 1 - 5 were the ones that were affected the most.,1402963200,5,122,4.857142857142857
8215641,1,B000UYN9TA,"I love this series but about 30% of my disks were scratched upon delivery.  This is due to the packaging.  They use card board sleeves with multiple disks per sheet.  Obviously little to no quality control, and considering the reviews you think they would try to fix it.",1444176000,,270,4.583333333333333

8215646,4,B000UYN9TA,"This is a great series! But I am sure many other reviews can tell you that. The sound and picture quality is, well, variable, but is what can be expected considering when this series was produced. With that in mind, I've no problems with any of it. The on-disc content is great!

So let us talk about this Complete Series Collection set specifically.

The outer box is fantastic! If you have the shelf room for it, it has a wonderful presence to it. It is a rich golden color with embossed celestial patterns all over it, and then we have the Stargate! The gate itself is plastic and fully three dimensional, and the ""water"" effect inside is a clear plastic bubble under which is a lenticular plate to give it a nice multi-dimensional effect. Outstanding and very durable!

Alas, once you open the outer box, you find ugliness inside. Contained within are two giant cardboard inner boxes. Each box holds half of the discs in very tight cardboard sleeves which are quite likely to scratch your discs with repeated use. (Indeed, some other reviews here for this product have reported discs scratched upon receipt... So check your discs carefully when you get them!)

These boxes themselves have no information printed upon them about what is contained on the discs they hold. The set does have a nice booklet to do this job, however.

Still, who wants a giant boxed set that is likely to destroy the discs contained within? Well, the set IS salvageable! The outer box happens to be just big enough to hold 27 slim plastic DVD cases and the aforementioned booklet. The set contains 54 discs. 54  2 = 27, so if you can get your hands on 27 2-disc slim cases, you can transfer the discs to those and still hold them in the outer box. For my own use, I even designed cover art to put in to the cases. (Nothing too fancy, but looks nice enough and gets the job done.)

With this done, I love my set and find it to be excellent! If this was how the set came, I'd have no trouble giving it five stars. But with all of the extra work I had to put into it to make the set (with regards to how it stores the discs) practically functional, I have to knock a star off. And even though my discs are fine, knowing (from other reviews I have read) that it is possible that the packaging can damage the discs prior to when you receive it, and thus before you even have a chance to take steps to fix this yourself.... Well, that knocks off another star.

Frankly, if you don't care about the packaging so much, go for the individual seasons. Based on the prices I see at the time of this writing, the cost for the ten individual seasons is about the same if not much cheaper then the Complete Series Collection. But if you do want this awesome looking box on your shelf... go for it! Just be ready with those 27 replacement cases. And don't dawdle on checking the discs for faults. And make sure you either buy from Amazon itself, or from a reputable third party seller with a liberal exchange policy.",1412380800,2,2982,4.399274047186933
