8091512,5,B000BRMXWU,"We saw this show when it was shown on television a long time ago. We adored her work and through the years tried to find a copy of it. Thank you, Amazon.com. We were thrilled to find it. She gave one of the finest performances, or should I say several performances in the world. See it if you can. I'm happy to say that she is still going strong. This show and her performance in Young Frankenstein are gems!",1173312000,,408,4.177215189873418
