8295590,1,B001DZOCIW,"While as the previous reviewer mentioned, the video quality is better, this re-packaged version of Kickboxing Academy has also been inexplicably edited, losing at least one hilarious scene.  By hilarious, I mean hilariously bad.  Kickboxing Academy is a masterpiece of ineptitude.  However, this version should be avoided as it is not intact.  Hunt down the original DVD, it's worth it.",1250726400,4,386,5.383333333333334
8295591,2,B001DZOCIW,"A re-release of the really bad 1997 movie Kick-Boxing Academy as an attempt to capitalize on the recent incestuous themed controversy that surrounds the movie due to Chyler Leigh playing the love-interest of her real-life brother Chris. The new notoriety is due largely to Chyler landing a high profile role as a cast member of the popular TV show Grey's Anatomy.

Really no difference from the original that I can tell (no added footage nor bonus features) but the video quality is noticeably better, though still not great for a DVD. The often embarrassing B-movie (Chyler won't even put it on her resume) deserves 1 star, but gave it 2 for the improvement in video quality.",1238889600,4,676,4.827586206896552
