2419814,1,B000BITVF6,This is the worse movie I have ever seen. The Actor's have no talent. A big waste of time. WARNING!!! Don't rent this movie. You will waste your money. They should pay you to  watch it.,1167782400,2,185,4.138888888888889
8087313,4,B000BITVF6,"Not bad! People obviously don't appreciate real low budget cinema like this, i have the original vhs copy of granny but decided one day to order the dvd to see if there was more added to it mostly tho to see the special features with extras to this film. However i found it to be down right enjoyable...just a typical horror film made by people i never heard of before this day.",1501977600,,378,4.263888888888889
8087314,4,B000BITVF6,"You have to know what you're getting into with movies like this. For us who love these no budget films, Granny is gold! I loved every second of it. Plus, the granny mask is quite creepy!  Get ready for piss poor acting and cheese!!!!",1458864000,,233,4.295454545454546
8087315,1,B000BITVF6,"This movie sucks. The audio only works in one speaker, the movie didn't make any sense. And besides it was all a joke once again. If I wanted  that I would have watched April Fools Day. Terrible movie.",1443225600,,201,4.2894736842105265
8087316,1,B000BITVF6,This is NOT the movie with Shannon Whirry I saw so many years ago. This is some really bad movie with people in a cabin.,1403222400,3,120,3.84
8087317,1,B000BITVF6,"GRANNY is about eight friends (4 guys, and 4 girls) in a house talking, and talking, AND talllkking! They also drink alcohol and talk some more. After a while (aka: an eternity) one of them decides to put on a ""horror skit"". He makes the rest of the group leave for an hour. When they return, they talk again. Then, the terror begins. GRANNY arrives w/ her big axe, and the bodies start to fall! Blessedly, people start dying in horrible ways. GRANNY is another silly, low-low budget slasher film. At a mere 59 minutes in length, it seems much longer, due to its intrinsic mega-boredom factor! And all that mindless talking! It's off to the wrinkle-ranch for GRANNY...",1392681600,,668,4.621848739495798
8087318,5,B000BITVF6,"i have finally watched this movie and watched it more then once i love it!!!!!!! now anyone who says this movie is bad is wrong this is not a bad movie at all the actors and actresses do well in they're roles even katie dugan who plays michelle. yes there is a scene where they talk and conversate and its not boring at all its very entertaining and the way natalie argues with tom and nick was soo funny and still is. Now ive watched this movie several times already and its a very DAMN good independent film the actings real sounding which is perfect the granny from the cover scary at what she does and the scares are just spooky, and alot of gore the characters are likeable and there is a scene where a girl monica goes in the bathroom and its a long scene but it grew on me and now i love it, I would love to see these people act in more movies the makeup on the bodys and faces spot on too!!!! a very nice glow. anyways if your a budget fan and wanna see a true gem and like it for being what it is then you will love it, as i always say if you see a movie and you see a cover like the one granny then simple DO NOT watch it then complain low bs are very easy to spot, and the music is awesome too great job on this film guys id like to see you guys in more movies and in makeup and wardrobe good luck on your careers granny ROCKS and with a twisted sad ending now i know someone said they're wondering who the woman in the car is in one of they're reviews im trying to figure that out too. definitely a must have for any budget fan!!!!!!!",1379808000,,1546,3.9424920127795526
8087319,1,B000BITVF6,"After ordering this movie and receiving it some time back, I was really looking forward to watching it however, after loading it into the DVD player I turned it on in order to watch it but 1 whole channel of sound did not work on the DVD. I was not going to go through all the trouble of packing it up & sending it back as I will just reorder it soon!",1366588800,,351,3.888888888888889
8087320,4,B000BITVF6,"This is a decent indie slasher movie. It includes a sharp original music score. It is the product of mainly 3 people: Boris Pavlovsky, Tomi, and Sava Popovic. The movie centers around a group of college students getting together and having a few drinks. They have some long, boring, almost realistic conversations that fill up too much of the movie, but does give you clues so you can figure out what is going on. It hit me about the third murder. The acting is so-so because the dialouge is  written as an attempt to be clever. For many of the actors, this is their only film credit.

When they talk about their fears, Tom does more than talk about his fear as his is manifested in a slasher in a Granny's mask. There is plenty of blood, but not much gore. Low budget, a worthy effort, a good film for those who appreciate the indie aspect of the film.

Rare F-bomb, no sex, no nudity",1313971200,,885,4.351515151515152
8087321,1,B000BITVF6,this movie was a waste of time and money its too bad that they don't let u view it before u buy it. i don't reccomend it.,1267315200,3,121,3.5185185185185186
8087322,3,B000BITVF6,"There are many scenes that seem completely pointless.  Fortunately, this movie is only 58 minutes long so you don't waste a lot of time on it if you don't like it.  The element of a surprise ending doesn't exist.  The dialogue in the beginning of the movie pretty much spells everything out for you.  If you like horrible horror movies, you may enjoy. Otherwise, don't waste your time if you can't find the humor in it.",1224720000,3,419,4.473684210526316
