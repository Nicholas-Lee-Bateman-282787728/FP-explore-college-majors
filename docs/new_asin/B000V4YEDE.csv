The  mom yoga poses shown are so brief and there are not many to begin with. You will not feel like you got a work out at all. These can be used as a quick boost, but not at all what the title suggests.

The majority of the video is introduction about her other programs. The yoga poses for babies are good, but that was supposed to be the bonus, not the focus of the video. I do like her Itsy Bitsy books for practicing yoga for babies, but do not recommend this video at all to any mother who wants a work out. Instead, I recommend Leisa Hart's FitMama Post Natal workout. Great workout and does not deceive anyone that these are exercises that incorporate babies.

Spend your money elsewhere if you want a good mommy workout.",1226620800,6,840,4.30379746835443
