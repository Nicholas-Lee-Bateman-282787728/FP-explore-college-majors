8322763,5,B001N0LEG0,"We have been living with my son's severe nut allergy for about 6 years so we thought we knew everything.  This documentary started out kinda 101, but it then share some issues we did not consider; good take-aways.  So for use, it was time well spent.",1425859200,,250,4.413043478260869
8322764,2,B001N0LEG0,"Nice, but slow and not too informative.  Nice just for encouragement to parents of young children with allergies.  My teenager with allergies couldn't sit through it.  Nothing bad;  I had just hoped for more.",1409097600,,208,5.029411764705882
8322765,5,B001N0LEG0,"As a mother of a child with anaphylaxis to peanuts, I found this film to be a wealth of information.  I have shared it with family members, and friends.  I highly encourage everyone in the food industry to view it as well.",1366329600,,222,4.261904761904762
8322766,5,B001N0LEG0,"I have a child with some severe allergies and this documentary explians things in a way that makes sense.  It was also helpfulto be able to give it to family and say, ""see! I'm not kidding about this.""  I highly suggest watching/buying if you know a child with allergies.",1250208000,2,271,4.510204081632653
8322767,5,B001N0LEG0,"I just finished watching Kevin J. Lindenmuth's new documentary, ""I'm Not Nuts"": Living With Food Allergies. Am I allowed to make this required viewing for every childcare worker and educator in the country? Because I'd like to. This film clearly and carefully lays out the basics of what it's like to be food allergic and/or to have a food-allergic child. Visual mediums are so powerful--I think this will touch people who don't know much about food allergies in a way that written stories cannot. The videotape footage of a one-year old, egg-allergic girl scratching her hands at her first birthday party because she was allergic to the eggs in the cake made me weep. (Her parents didn't know about her allergy at the time, of course.)

For those who do live with food allergies, the information here is nothing new, or at least not very much of it. But the feeling is one of a support group meeting and allergist's visit right in your own living room. I found myself nodding my head in agreement and talking to the screen. ""Yes! This is what it's like.""

Full of interviews with the food allergic and their families, as well as interviews with allergy experts such as Terry Furlong, co-founder of FAAN, Scott Sicherer, M.D., researcher in the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at Mount Sinai, and Harvey Leo, M.D. and Ben Song, M.D., of Allergy and Immunology Associates of Ann Arbor, MI, I think this documentary is a great resource.",1231200000,4,1431,4.766129032258065
