6203117,3,B00HSJ279I,"Was a little hard to follow the sequence of events and plot line, but once I figured out what was going on, I was glued.  The story is dark - not a Hollywood happy-ending movie.  The two lead actors are excellent, but Cory Monteith steals each of his scenes.",1392940800,4,258,4.244897959183674
6203118,4,B00HSJ279I,"On the surface, McCanick is a simple story of a cop going after an ex-con who he has a history with. As the film progresses, the lines begin to blur, leaving the audience to question who is really the good guy and who is actually the bad guy? This film is notable, as it is the last thing Glee star Cory Monteith worked on before he died, and it was a definite change in direction for the young star. The story starts on Eugene Wellington McCanick's birthday, a happy day that should mark a reunion with his son, but instead marks a day where he learns that the biggest bust of his career, acquiesced killer Simon Wells (Cory Monteith) had been paroled. McCanick is ordered to leave the situation alone, but he can't rest while this man is on the street and McCanick goes looking for trouble. This is a very dark and methodical drama that really seems to have no depth whatsoever, until you see both sides of the story presented in flashbacks. David Morse stars as your typical tough loner cop, whose life is all about the job. The kind of cop that takes his job personally and will do whatever it takes to bust the people he sees as a threat to his city. When I think tough guy, David Morse is not the first person who comes to mind, but he has a history of playing both the good and the bad guy, making the role of Eugene McCanick perfect for him. He's paired with Cory Monteith, who as a teen heartthrob, has never really been seen as more than a sweet, loveable guy. Simon Wells is anything but sweet an loveable, as he's been severally damaged by a life on the streets, but the question becomes just how bad a guy is he? McCanick is the kind of film where everything seems to be laid right out in front of you, the kind of film where you're not expecting a surprise, but that's the whole premise of the film. The whole purpose of the film is to make you question everything you believe and it really turns into to something very unique and special. McCanick doesn't have a cast or a preview that screams out to you, many people are just going to skip it, but if you do, you'll  be missing that special kind of movie that leaves you thinking about it long after it's over.",1414281600,,2176,4.281553398058253

6203121,1,B00HSJ279I,"I gave this 1 star not because I didn't like the movie. From what I COULD watch of it, it seemed pretty good. It was at the most climactic part of the movie, however, when the movie began to skip, then freeze, then it would go back to the main menu. Thinking it was just a faulty disc, I ordered the movie again. I got the second movie yesterday and the exact same thing happened! I guess for $8 you get what you pay for. I have purchased this movie from a different company and have returned the two faulty ones. Again, nothing wrong with the movie itself. I am a Glee fan and Corey Monteith was my favorite on the show. I was saddened to hear of his passing, so when I learned he had made this movie just before his death, I wanted to check it out. Can't wait to watch the remainder of the film once I get a working copy.",1411257600,,823,4.024390243902439
6203122,1,B00HSJ279I,Before I purchase a movie I usually read what it's about and technically it is accurate but at the end of the day it's not the cops and robbers thriller I was looking for. I was actually very disappointed and saw what my eyes did not want to see David Morse do. I don't recommend this movie if your looking for a cop who's trying to find justice. It's a twisted story.,1410393600,,368,4.125

6203126,3,B00HSJ279I,"McCanick is an odd movie.  It is neither great nor bad, it's just ""eh"".  David Morse to some is from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/St-Elsewhere/dp/B000MPOJK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">St. Elsewhere</a>.  Since I've never watched the program, to me he's always been a cop.  Whether he was a good or bad cop depended on the situation.

In McCanick, Morse, playing the title character is obsessed with putting away Simon Weeks (Cory Monteith) after his release from prison.  So obsessed with doing that, McCanick accidently shoots his partner Floyd (Mike Vogel of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Dome-HD/dp/B00DOWMH1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Dome [HD</a>] fame) and eventually blames Weeks for the shooting.

McCanick's boss, Jerry Quinn (Ciaran Hinds Caesar of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome/dp/B006GLMZPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome</a>&nbsp;fame) has issues with McCanick's fixation on putting Weeks away.

In some ways it's a thought providing movie.  There's some action but mostly it just moves along at its own pace.",1407196800,5,1185,7.467625899280575

6203131,2,B00HSJ279I,"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie from the trailers that i saw, great cast and also Cory Monteith's
last movie. The ist part was interesting as to why  he had to round up this guy who just got out of jail.
As the movie moved along i suddenly found myself not enjoying it. Maybe, i just watched it on a bad
day or maybe the movie was not that good after all. I enjoy David Morse as an actor but  this movie
just lost it's fizz along the way.

6203132,1,B00HSJ279I,"Wow what a waste of time.  And I like David Morse in some other things, but this movie is just beyond stupid.  No time wasted writing dialog for this one; they just throw in the big F when they have nothing to say.  Boo-hiss!",1403827200,2,225,4.068181818181818

6203134,2,B00HSJ279I,"I really wanted to like this movie, I love thrillers and police thrillers even better and I've been a fan of David Morse for as long as he's been acting....so to see him in a lead was exciting for me.

Sadly, other than his performance, this movie is a mess and a boring mess at that.  The title of my review refers to a line said to our protagonist  Eugene McCanick after a pathetic one man stand..... and it's obviously a reference to ""The French Connection"" which in the making of the film makers claim is an inspiration.  Let me get this on the record, comparing this film to ""The French Connection"" is like comparing the Albuquerque Dukes to the New York Yankees!

As a script/story goes, this never really raises to the level of interesting and the numerous flashbacks only underscore the weakness of same.  As far as the film itself, it looks amateurish..... flat contrast and featuring a distinct yellow/green cast in some sort of attempt to hide the cheap stock I suppose or be artsy.... ultimately it looks as bad as the script. There is a reason that this script sat in a drawer for over a decade ... it isn't good, original or in any way interesting or involving.

I am not a Glee fan so I can't compare the gentleman who had a smaller role or relate his performance to his more well known role... I know he's passed away and that he may be more of interest to folks than this movie and it may be a curiosity for that alone. He was fine in his performance but given the overall ""who cares"" script .. his talent was wasted as was Mr Morse.  They were surrounded for the most part by amateurish actors.... this thing just stinks.  As I paid only ten bucks for the blu ray I can't give it a 1 star.... but please don't waste your money....",1401321600,6,1748,4.337423312883436

6203137,4,B00HSJ279I,A very solid performance by Cory Monteith and he delivers a twist that you didn't see coming. The best scenes are whenever David Morse and Cory Monteith are on screen together. Really wished Ciaran Hinds was utilized more....,1393545600,11,225,4.947368421052632

8635446,4,B00HSJ279I,"A stronger-than-expected story of a cop on the edge of functionality makes you work to follow the plot--which is a big plus for this type of movie.  It kept me guessing as to who was doing what and why. David Morse is as outstanding as usual as the cop. Mike Vogel is so appealing as his son that his story line has that much more punch, while Cory Monteith seems too large and capable for the type of street hustler intended. More of Trevor Morgan as a wannabe cocaine dealer would have made the movie that much better. I'll be watching this again to savor the ambiguity.",1468627200,,572,4.345794392523365

8635453,2,B00HSJ279I,"David Morse plays Eugene ""Mac"" McCannick.  It's Mac's 59th birthday and although Mac seems respected, he seems - to put it mildly - like more than a bit of a dick.  He yells at his boss.  He snarks at his partner. He is estranged from his family. His life is his job, and though he seems to have done alright there, his lack of social skills has clearly kept him from ""the bars on his chest"" that his father told him were the only thing worth having.

Then, Cory Monteith is released from prison and Mac goes on a one-man dragnet to find this guy, who was obviously framed. For those of you who may not know it, Monteith is the late actor who played a homosexual character on Glee.  The homosexual angle becomes important in this movie as we watch Mac work male prostitutes to locate Monteith's character - who has a very small role in this flick. Eventually, we learn that the reason for Mac's obsession is that Monteith's character knows his secret, although we are maybe thirty minutes ahead of guessing what the ""secret"" might be.

There are several problems with the movie. First, Mac is an unlikeable person doing unlikeable things for unlikeable reasons. That trinity is largely a death-spell for caring about a character or a movie.  Second, the movie is forced along by odd, random, unexplained plot developments.  For example, out of nowhere we find Morse and his boss, Ciaran Hinds, who is woefully underused in this movie, sitting in Hinds' car discussing a major plot reveal. How did he get to the car? Doesn't matter because we needed that plot reveal at that time or the movie would have collapsed under its own weight. Third, other weirdness - do we really expect young, black ghetto thugs to be comparing a Philadelphia cop to ""Popeye Doyle"" of ""The French Connection""? I'm twice their age and The French Connection is shortly before my time.

David Morse did a good job of acting, albeit he seemed to be channeling an anger problem, undoubtedly because of his homophobic hypocrisy, if I am to intuit the moral of the movie.",1414886400,,2041,4.616022099447513
