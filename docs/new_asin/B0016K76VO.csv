-4 stars for the package/ publisher
Total 1 star.
I live in Japan and love this classic old tv show. Here it is held in much higher esteem than the movie of the same name (long available in the US). I was very happy when I found out about the recently released US edition, as my Old Japanese comprehension is not that great.  I ordered Vols 1-3.

However when my order arrived several (half?) of the discs were loose in their box and horribly scratched, unreadable by my player. I have ordered plenty of dvds off amazon to Japan w/no previous problems so it is probably a Tokyo Shock problem.  The episodes I was able to see were excellent as expected, and it was great being able to understand the complex plots better w/subtitles.  I really want to order the rest of the series, however will not do so until I firgure out how to get a refund/ exchange my scratched copies for good ones and get assurance that the boxes have been improved.

The stories are great, the actor is apparently a classically trained Kabuki actor famous in Japan, and he brings a great prasence to the part (unlike the movie actor, apparently).  I highly recommend this TV show. 5 stars for all episodes. However Tokyo Shock and the dvd boxes they used rate -4 stars for a total of 1 star.

PS the price is less than 1/4 of the Japanese domestic dvd of the tv series (someone was complaining about the price).",1231286400,,1407,4.388461538461539
8262764,5,B0016K76VO,"This is an excellent TV series, not as bloody as the films but it is more faithful to the original Manga books.
My biggest criticism is that Media Blasters are only putting two episodes per disc. Apart from the cost, that's an AWFUL lot of DVD's taking up shelf space.
The good news is that there will be a box set, the bad news is it could be some time coming.
Even though I have bought the first two releases (and enjoyed them enormously) I think I'll wait for the Box Set.",1215561600,2,475,4.173913043478261
