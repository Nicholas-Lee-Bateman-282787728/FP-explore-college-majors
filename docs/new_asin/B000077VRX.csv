1801673,5,B000077VRX,"I found this unassuming little film, depicting one long Thanksgiving weekend in New York City, to be absolutely delightful.  Oscar, a precocious fifteen year old prep school student who quotes Voltaire and speaks French, is far, far too sophisticated to be bothered by the girls his age. Rather, his heart is focused on his step-mother, played by Sigourney Weaver.  He is a charmer, but completely unable to see the naivete of his youth.  His efforts to be adult -- gluing on fake sideburns and spouting philosophy to any willing audience are right on.  He seems to think that there is no reason he cannot be a serious contender for his step-mother's affections, and he courts her (his true intentions unbeknownst to her) by bringing her lunch at work, calling the terminology of her work (cardiological research) poetry, and playing tennis with her.  John Ritter plays the clueless history-professor-Dad to a tee.  I really liked this film -- from the title screen (where letters flitter across the screen in the shape of a tadpole) to the end, where Oscar is finally able to see the attractiveness of a girl his own age.  Surprisingly good!",1045267200,,1142,4.8860103626943
1801674,3,B000077VRX,"""Tadpole"" is a fairly interesting film.  In the era of abstinence, it assumes a permissive attitude about teen sex.  Aaron Stanford who will soon play Pyro in ""X2"" gives an edgy performance as the teen Oscar Grubman who loves Voltaire and pines for his father's wife.  John Ritter as dad Stanley does a nice job of being fatherly and out-of-touch.  Sigourney Weaver's Eve is a brilliant cardiologist who is the apple of Oscar's eye.  Their scene where they try to substitute another organ, the ""liver,"" for ""heart"" is humorous, ""you set my heart aquiver, you broke my liver"" (or whatever the dialogue was).  The best moments in the film belong to Bebe Neuwirth as the cradle-robbing Diane who is a free spirit.  She has a fling with the wonderfully obtuse Phil played by Adam Le Fever, but doesn't let that get in the way of a little midnight fun with Oscar.  She urges her friend Eve to put a little spice in her life and consider an affair with a 15-year old.  Being as she makes this sound even remotely reasonable, she ought to gain special recognition.  Robert Iler as Charlie does a nice job as well.  I wanted to see this movie in the theatre & missed it; so I was surprised about 3 weeks later to find the DVD.  The digital video shooting was distracting for me.  Combined with some of the soap opera dialogue, I felt like I was watching television rather than a feature film.  Still, it's reasonably entertaining.  The restaurant scene with Diane sticking her foot in Osacar's crotch while he's busy trying to impress Eve and Stanley is oblivious is highly entertaining.  So despite its shortcomings, you might as well zip it up and try Tadpole for a one-nighter.  Enjoy!",1044403200,4,1680,4.621621621621622
1801675,3,B000077VRX,"""Tadpole"" is a slight little comedy that tries and fails to be more than it is. Its director, Gary Winick, won the Director's Award at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. Miramax then paid the producers of this independent project several million dollars for it. Who will ever understand the business of Hollywood?
The movie tells the story of a bright, privileged, fifteen-year old New Yorker named Oscar [Aaron Stanford] who is in love with his stepmother, Eve [Sigourney Weaver]. He comes home from prep school for Thanksgiving determined to let her know. His plan is easier thought up than done. The house is crowded with friends and family, his loving father [John Ritter] is always in the way, and attractive girls his age keep popping up at the wrong times. Frustrated, he goes out and gets drunk one night and ends up at Diane's [Bebe Neuwirth] house. They make love, which complicates matters because Diane is Eve's best friend. The kid may have had his affair with an older woman, but not only is she the wrong woman, she also has a hard time keeping a secret.
The cast is fun and makes the most of the script, which has moments of great wit but doesn't seem entirely fleshed out, especially with its ..., cop-out ending. I personally had a problem with Stanford's role. He is a fine actor, one to keep an eye on. He was twenty-four when he made the movie, and, through no fault of his own, his Oscar has the look and body language of someone in his twenties, rather than someone who is fifteen. [I didn't know Stanford's age when I watched the movie.] Consequently, much of what is supposed to be shockingly fresh and funny gets watered down. Did the filmmakers cast it this way on purpose, perhaps fearing that some people in this oh so politically correct world would not be amused by the premise?",1044144000,2,1807,4.614906832298137
1801676,3,B000077VRX,"This is a charming little film with some very nice performances. Bebe Neuwirth in particular is very, very funny.  Her scenes with Stanford are what make this one sizzle. Extremely short (77 minutes)so if you blink you may miss something, but those minimal minutes are certainly entertaining. Watch for the restaurant scene - you will laugh and squirm at the same time.",1043712000,,369,4.951612903225806
1801677,3,B000077VRX,"There are a lot of things to like about this movie. The acting is excellent. The script is well written and there are more than a few laugh-out-loud funny scenes in it.
The reason I am only giving it 3 stars is because I feel it never really ""moved"" me. After watching it, I felt as though I had watched a good movie, but nothing about it is really original or mind blowing. It's just a small quirky movie, and at only 77 minutes I was disappointed with the abrumpt ending.
Having said that, Tadpole is certainly worth seeing and is 100 times better than most of the ""Blockbusters"" that go on to gross hundreds of millions.",1043280000,3,623,4.333333333333333
1801678,4,B000077VRX,"I attended a college prep school, but don't remember anything like what happens in the comedy TADPOLE. Perhaps I should have read more of the French philosophers.
Aaron Stanford has his debut acting role as Oscar Grubman, a 15-year-old boarding school student returning to his father's NYC home for the Thanksgiving holiday. Oscar's (divorced) mother is French, so he speaks the language and is heavily into French literature, especially Voltaire. Oscar isn't interested in girls his own age, and a peer remarks that Oscar is a  40-year-old trapped in a teenager's body. Oscar carries a heavy weight - he's got a serious crush on his 40-something stepmom, Eve (Sigourney Weaver). Though Oscar has eyes only for Mrs. Grubman, his mental maturity combined with boyish enthusiasm attracts Eve's female friends, who press their phone numbers on him - and more. Eve's best friend, Diane (Bebe Neuwirth), seduces him one evening after finding him wandering drunk and lovesick (for Eve) on the street. The morning after, Oscar is horrified.
This was Stanford's first role after graduating from Rutgers University where he studied theater. Simply put, he's terrific. Neuwirth is positively delicious as the mischievous Diane who toys with the lad as a cat with a mouse. (Any teenage boy should be so lucky!) There's one scene after Oscar's one-night tryst where Oscar, Diane, Eve, and Oscar's father Stanley (John Ritter) go out to a restaurant dinner, and which had the audience almost rolling in the aisles. It alone was worth the price of admission.
Sigourney Weaver is radiant as the unsuspecting Eve, and one can understand why Oscar is attracted. I know I was. John Ritter does well enough as Oscar's college professor father, though my opinion is undoubtedly unfairly skewed towards the negative by the fact that I've never gotten over the actor's relentlessly obnoxious character in television's THREE'S COMPANY.
TADPOLE is short at 77 minutes, and I was left slightly dissatisfied as the film rolled into the credits after what I thought was a too abrupt ending. Perhaps it's because the Diane/Oscar relationship was so richly humorous and fraught with awkward possibilities, and I wanted more of it. However, that said, this is a delightful, must-see movie.",1042243200,2,2259,5.155313351498638
1801699,5,B000077VRX,"At 77 minutes this film really packs a wallop---hilarious most of the way through, but also poignant and incisive at turns.

I rented this film mainly because I absolutely love both Sigourney Weaver and Bebe Neuwirth but I had low expectations, thinking it was probably going to be another ""The Graduate"" knockoff with the sort of pretentious deadness of ""Rushmore.""

Instead I was pleasantly surprised: while ""Tadpole"" does make a couple of self-conscious and coy allusions to ""The Graduate"" (one of my all-time favorites that I've seen dozens of times) it definitely has its own unique style and flavor.  Aaron Stanford is no Dustin Hoffman but is more than up to the role, portraying the super-bright, gawky teenager very adroitly.  Weaver and Neuwirth put in excellent performances as is their norm, Neuwirth especially packs an ungodly amount of devastating sexual magnetism in every scene, with every glance and gesture and word---ay yi yi, I kept wanting to kick Stanford for not being elated to have HER fall into his lap!

The other really side-splitting supplier of comic relief here is John Ritter, who plays the brainy but clueless college professor with delightful aplomb...I didn't even realize he was John Ritter until the credits!

All in all this is a light film but utterly delightful, it's too bad it's not at least an extra 30 minutes longer.

Some reviewers have complained about the digital camera picture often being washed out but I found it perfectly fine, my only objection was a bit of excessive camera movement during the first 15 minutes of the movie.  Otherwise everything comes together marvelously: the strong script and cast, score, camera work, film editing, etc.  For the 2 weeks of filming and shoestring $150,000 budget they really put together a very high quality piece of work.  How refreshing to see a film that dares to do whatever the hell it wants however it wants, without boring the audience to tears!",1111622400,8,1946,4.978395061728395
1801700,3,B000077VRX,"This independent film is about a fifteen year old boy who is in love with his 40 year old stepmother Eve, played by Weaver. Neuwirth plays Eve's sexually charged friend Diane, and Ritter is the boy's father. While home on school break, the boy plans to reveal his love to his stepmother. But before he can, he has a one night stand with Diane while drunk. She is very casual about the sex, but he is overwrought with the possibility that Eve might find out. In the best scene of the movie, Diane drops hints about the affair while the four of them are eating in a restaurant together. Afterward, the boy confesses his love for his stepmother, and she is obviously conflicted, allowing him to kiss her. Ultimately, she rejects him and he moves on to a healthier interest in girls his own age. The movie returns often to a theme of Oscar's enthusiasm for life, which is the key to his attractiveness to older women, who are surrounded by bored people. Eve herself is a rare individual who has maintained the spark of youth into her adulthood. All of the adult actors do a serviceable job, although Neuwirth outshines Weaver, and Ritter outshines them both. The boy who plays Oscar is fine, except for scenes in which he is comically uncomfortable, which he plays too broadly. The movie is fine for what it is, but somehow seemed too thin to sustain its running length. There is a lack of subplots, and the conflict is fairly muted, with not much risk of loss for any of the characters. The most potent conflict would be between Oscar and his father, but Ritter's character remains blissfully ignorant. As it is, we are sympathetic toward Oscar's plight, but don't really feel emotionally involved in the outcome. Instead, we have a prurient interest in who will sleep with Oscar.",1104796800,,1777,4.6265822784810124
1801701,5,B000077VRX,Tadpole Was Shot On A Sony PD150(PAL) And Is A Great Film To Study If you are a filmmaker like me. because i own a pd150(NTSC) i saw that you can make funny and cinematic films in DV. I Love This Movie For DV Studying.,1103760000,,218,3.8666666666666667
1801702,4,B000077VRX,"I finally got to view Tadpole---a few days after the most recent presidential election.  The film has nothing directly to do with politics, but inadvertently it reminds one why the Democrats were crushed last Tuesday.  Aaron Stanford aptly portrays fifteen year old Oscar Grubman, the son of a Columbia University historian (the late John Ritter) and stepson of a heart disease researcher (Signourney Weaver).  This is an liberal elitist family living in Manhattan.  Needless to add, their nonchalant attitudes toward sexuality, especially pertaining to older adults enjoying sex with young teenagers is considered disgraceful by the majority of citizens living in the red states.

We observe the precocious Oscar wrestling (often in French) with his existential and romantic challenges.  Eventually he beds a woman in her forties (Bebe Neuwrath).  This event is not reported to the police.  On the contrary, nobody wishes to be judgmental. A teenage boy is supposedly nature enough to enter into such relationships.  The United States is indeed split apart by a cultural war. Red and blue staters are barely able to comprehend the world view of each other.  Tadpole will remind you just how serious are the differences.  This movie is ironically important in a manner which would likely surprise director Gary Winick.  You need to see it.  This is especially true if you wish to take a peek at our national political future.",1099785600,,1425,5.170305676855895
1801703,3,B000077VRX,"A cute, though ultimately flawed, film.  Excellent performances from the luminous Sigourney Weaver (who never seems to age!), the hysterical John Ritter (RIP), and the SEXY Bebe Neuwirth (who has yet to disappoint me in any of her work).  The story is a little weird, a boy with a crush on his step mom, and yet completely believable.  In Oscar, Aaron Grubman has found a quirky character that any precocious teenage male (such as myself) can relate to.",1099180800,,453,4.782051282051282
1801704,3,B000077VRX,"This enjoyable comedy (shot on digital video) with a refreshingly brief running time (approx 75 minutes) won Writer/Director Gary Winick the Best Director award at the Sundance Festival.
Aaron Stanford plays Oscar Grubman (nicknamed Tadpole), a 15 year old who has no interest in girls his own age.  By his own admission he feels like a 40 year old trapped in a teen's body.  Tadpole's preference for older women reaches the point of chaos when he develop a crush on his stunning stepmother Eve (Sigourney Weaver).
But his attentions are also focused on the equalling sexy Diane (Bebe Neuwirth) whom he meets during an under-aged drinking session in a local bar.  An affair soon starts between them and Oscar must try and keep the romance secret from his Dad (the late John Ritter) while wrestling with his feelings for Eve.
Basically TADPOLE is a romantic comedy that merges the classic romantic triangle with a dash of the classic Oedipus syndrome.  The resulting movie is an enjoyable time-killer that manages to be both light in tone but with more complexity below the surface than you would expect. While it sounds like some sex comedy you've seen a million times before TADPOLE manages to consistently surprise the viewer without insulting their intelligence (obviously this is an independent movie).
This is one of those rare movies that will appeal to just about any audience.  Guys are especially advised to rent this if their girlfriends want them to watch something with them.  The brief running time you may be able to talk her into watching an action movie after this has finished!  While not hugely memorable, the movie has heart, sincerity and intelligence (Uh-oh! Here comes my feminine side!) as well as all round good performances.  The DVD I watched had no special features, but the movie is still worth a look.  If you're a romantic comedy buff you'll easily give this movie a higher rating than the three stars I've given it.  Which leads us to THE BIG QUESTION: Why is Oscar nicknamed ""Tadpole""?  Do the math: One 15 year old boy with raging hormones plus two sexy older women.  Put that together and close your eyes.  What do you see?  I see the opening credits to LOOK WHO'S TALKING....
Perhaps I'd be wise to stop my review here.  Maybe this IS meant to be a movie to watch with the missus! If that's the case insert this into your DVD player, pop some popcorn, pop some Viagra and Bob's your uncle.  Viola! There's your night planned!",1090195200,2,2460,4.7665094339622645
1801705,5,B000077VRX,"Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford) arrives in New York City by train as he has a short vacation from Chauncey Academy where he attends high school.  Oscar is to celebrate Thanksgiving with his father Stanley (John Ritter) and stepmother Eve (Sigourney Weaver), but it is about to be a peculiar experience for Oscar since he has fallen deeply in love with his stepmother.  The love that Oscar has for Eve causes friction between him and his dad who attempts to make it an enjoyable break for his son.  By a coincidence Oscar ends up in bed with Eve's best friend Diane (Bebe Neuwirth), which causes some additional awkwardness for Oscar as he spends his break in New York.  Tadpole is an excellent drama about coming of age and the youthful discovery of love that can sometimes be misunderstood.  The story unfolds with remarkable ease as it displays the misfortunes and tragedies that can be connected with love, leaving the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience.",1089417600,2,968,4.878048780487805

There's some comedy here. They did nothing with this. I guess they played it as a serious offering. I have a feeling that movie screenwriters are second rate TV people. You can't make a good comedy with dialogue alone. You must set up funny SITUATIONS. (I am a situational comedy writer.)",1089158400,,442,4.67948717948718
1801707,5,B000077VRX,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thoroughly enjoyed this little film, which I came across entirely by accident. The premise is intriguing with a cast - Sigourney Weaver, John Ritter, Bebe Neuwirth - guaranteed to provide real acting, although young Aaron Stanford easily steals the show (Bebe gives him a good run for the money though). The script is articulate and witty (quite rare qualities these days) and intelligence is displayed in all other departments. Apart from Bebe Neuwirth's vampish turns, it is not a laugh out loud comedy - but you find yourself smiling a lot while watching it.
My wife and I repeatedly commented during the film about how much it reminded us of one of Francois Truffaut's films - particularly the Antoine Doinel stories. The similarities between Oscar and Antoine are truly striking and the overall French flavour of the piece is surely not accidental. Other reviewers have complained about the directorial style and look of Tadpole, but this a large part of its charm. In fact, the Truffaut influence is what really endeared the film to us.
Yes, the running time is somewhat short but you still feel satisfied at the end. Tadpole is a film for anyone who appreciates something a little bit different.",1088121600,2,1240,4.90952380952381
1801708,1,B000077VRX,I like the Idea of the film&it's cool from that perspective but the acting&direction of the film never fully get to the point of where it should.it takes on more than it can muster.a waste of John Ritter's Talent in this film.,1087603200,,226,4.404761904761905
1801718,5,B000077VRX,"I consider the women in this movie just props:  the real humor is about the weird interactions between a fifteen-year-old intellectual master of Voltaire and anyone who would expect a kid to have relationships which would be appropriate for that age.  The kid's eagerness to apply his knowledge to everything that could happen in a Thanksgiving weekend is challenged by the movie's knack for putting him in situations that he never expected.  The literary side of this movie is the thoughts of Voltaire in quoted sentences that show up on the screen more often than I expected.  The funniest thing about Voltaire is that anybody can read this stuff, but no one ever expects it to pop up like this.  Everything this movie says about sideburns is funny.  Forty minus fifteen is only twenty-five years ago, long after Elvis got out of the army and got his sideburns back.  There are so many ways an ingenious teenager can get sideburns in a hurry in our society, it is great to see a kid in a hurry solve such practical problems.",1085961600,,1026,4.666666666666667
1801719,5,B000077VRX,"What a surprise. It's too bad the movie trailers made the film look like a sex fest because this film is actually a very touching account of the adolescent struggle. Although Aaron Stanford, the 15 year old anti-hero, was completely oogy and gross, Bebe Neuwirth & Sigourney Weaver were able to be completely believable as the objects of his affection. And, despite his general unattractiveness there was a delicious energy throughout the whole film...I found myself experiencing the same feelings I had when reading Catcher in the Rye (although this movie is about a poseur who just wants to bag his stepmother and not on the level of intellect as that great work!).",1085529600,2,667,4.911504424778761
1801720,2,B000077VRX,"This could have been an interesting little movie had it not focused on a pretentious, unlikeable poser. I knew in the first 5 minutes (after Oscar has criticized a young woman's *hands* for lacking wit and experience (!)) that I was not going to like this guy....and moreover, I couldn't understand what made him such a chick magnet. I'm a 35 year old woman and didn't understand the appeal of such a transparently self-obsessed, self-important boy.
I also found his interactions with his father unreal - and I'm the daughter of an academic, so I know how academics are. But if I lived in NYC (or anywhere else, really) and my 15-year-old son disappeared into the night, never came home, and didn't call as to his whereabouts, you can bet I wouldn't be all nonchalant about it in the morning. Oscar's obvious disrespect towards his dad really bugged me - he fancied himself as the great sophisticate, but he was just a whiny spoiled brat underneath the French trappings. Just once I would've liked to see a character put him in his place, like during the excruciating dinner at the French restaurant, and no one raised an eyebrow at Diane's announcement that ""Oscar and I are lovers."" (Father's reaction: ""Well, Oscar is an adult now...."" Aren't we all incredibly enlightened and civilized!) Hello? Parent much?
Other (very small) gripe: Sigourney Weaver was 53 when this movie was made, not 40. I love her and think she looks great, but I couldn't help but be distracted by ""Isn't Sigourney Weaver closer to 50?!""
The best thing in this movie was Bebe Neuwith...but she couldn't save Tadpole for me.",1056326400,9,1600,4.7797833935018055
1801721,4,B000077VRX,"Oscar is a young man with a problem.  Mature beyond his fifteen years, he's enthralled with his stepmother Eve (subtlety played by Sigourney Weaver).  He dreams of long philosophical talks and more with her, while rejecting the more appropriate options of the girls his own age.  While his obsession goes unnoticed by his father (John Ritter) and Eve, his latent charms do attract the attention of Sigourney's best friend (the ever-so-sultry Bebe Newirth), who is more than happy to seduce and exploit the young innocent.
If you haven't spotted the conundrum behind all of this, let me spell it out more distinctly.  How can a responsible adult (a classification that probably excludes me) enjoy a movie built on the premise of a forty year old seducing a fifteen year old?  If the adult were a man and the teenager was female, there would have been a ton of protests about the exploitation and lack of consequences.  It's a reverse Lolita.  But despite that critical flaw, Tadpole is an extremely literate movie.  The dialogue could have been written by Noel Coward, the cast is polished and the pacing is near-perfect.
In one hilarious scene, Oscar is about to exit Bebe's apartment after their overnight encounter.  But he encounters her boyfriend who immediately assumes that Oscar is one of her chiropractic patients.  Remarks like ""doesn't she just turn you inside/out?"" are delivered with therapeutic concern but received as being sexual inquisition, resulting in one very confused teenager, until he realizes that the friend is completely unaware of what had transpired over the last few hours.
I can't help but wonder if the subject matter caused one or two scenes to be left on the cutting room floor, as the movie is incredibly short by today's standards.  But if that is the case, it was a justifiable decision as Tadpole overcomes some substantial moral concerns to deliver a charming story.",1054512000,2,1904,4.974763406940063

As the titular tadpole, Oscar, newcomer Aaron Stanford is sweetly sincere as a passionate, intelligent, and very serious teenage boy in love with his stepmother (Weaver) and seduced by her best friend (Neuwirth).

Stanford's film debut is auspicious-I expect we will see good things in the future from this actor.
John Ritter is effective as the oblivious father; I didn't even recognize him behind the beard.  I was never a big John Ritter fan, but here he is quite effective.  Sigourney Weaver is beautiful and sexy as the stepmother (she should be the poster child for ""aging gracefully""!).  Bebe Neuwirth is hysterical and wonderful as Diane, the older woman who introduces Oscar to the joys of sex.

Tadpole's main problem is Aaron Stanford, who not only looks too old to be a high school sophomore but plays Oscar as very gay while still trying to be a ladies' man. Gender confusion might be a worthy subject for a black comedy, but that's not the issue here.

But Aaron Stanford is the star and deserves more credit than Ritter.",1319932800,,432,4.773333333333333

Got that movie coz of Sigourney Weaver as I usually like her movies.
The first thing what comes in mind when the movie starts, that it has low quality. I guess the director used his home video camera!!!  The video quality is poor. It has the quality of an ""adult movie"" :-)

I am amazed that great actors such as Weaver, Bebe Neuwirth and Ritter among some others non main casts, were participating in this movie.
It really has  p..rn quality. And I don't know if they were aware of it when doing this movie.
If not those actors would be in the movie, I would have turned off the movie right away due to thinking of that kind of movie as mentioned above.

That is quite disappointing about this movie, the ""look like a bad video quality and thinking of an adult movie""",1317772800,,795,4.273333333333333
7974160,3,B000077VRX,"I really don't believe Tadpole is a comedy, unless there's a subtle dark or serious element of humor underneath the entire plot.

It's about a super intelligent teenage boy who doesn't have any interest in girls his own age, but rather, women in their 40's. The dilemma he's going through is that he's attracted to two middle aged women at the same time, and the storyline is based around which one he wants to be with more. Personally I would have gone with the brunette back massager, lol.

Throughout the movie, there's a noticeable vibe of unusualness concerning the decisions the boy makes. You'll know what I mean when you watch the movie- everything's suspiciously quiet, like a lingering feeling that you're not supposed to fall in love with someone more than twice your age.  This vibe is the reason I fail to see a comedic style appeal.

None of this really qualifies as humor from my point of view, but perhaps others would disagree. I wasn't laughing with one exception- a dinner table scene involving his father (John Ritter's character) and the two women the boy's attracted to sitting together at the table with him, leading to a few frustrating and embarrassing scenes.

Overall, it's an alright movie, but at only 70 minutes, it should have been longer because as it is, it feels like a film that was never given the proper amount of attention it deserved.",1310947200,,1373,4.7280334728033475
7974161,4,B000077VRX,"There is something about `Tadpole' that is so nerdy charming I can't help but recall it with affectionate memories.  It is far from perfect, and yet the little imperfections that plague it only seem to make it better for me.  It's not the type of wildly engaging comedy that can be watched over and over again but it is the type of smartly comedic film that you will remember for a long while, even after a solitary viewing.

Watching the film on a total whim, I was surprised by how witty and devilishly sophisticated it wound up being.

The film tells the story of Oscar, a young man with quite the conundrum.  He is, unfortunately, in love with his step-mother Eve.  The fact that Eve is married to Oscar's father really doesn't deter him much from attempting to make his feelings known.  He takes the Thanksgiving break (and subsequent visit home from school) to find a way to expose his feelings only to have romantic entanglements get in the way.  Before he knows it he is being followed (quite accidentally) by a fellow schoolmate with a crush, pushed on a neighbor with which he shares no interest and thrust into sexual debauchery with Eve's best friend, Diane.  All of these `road-blocks' make it more and more difficult for Oscar to just tell Eve how he feels.

But then again, does it really matter?

The cast is flawless, especially Bebe Neuwirth who just sizzles in every scene with comedic delights and snarky charm that just floods the screen.  She is a star and the star of this film whenever the light is cast her way.  Sigourney Weaver is a tad frumpy here, but I think that was the point (casting a more mature light on Oscar's infatuation) and the late John Ritter is certainly up to the task and making his character shine.  Aaron Stanford understands the muted arrogance needed to create Oscar and keep the audience interested in him.  He rides the cuff of unlikable and engaging, which helps carry the film.

Sadly, the strengths of the script and cast seem to fall through the directors hands.  The film needed some crisper, more attentive direction that could have really embellished the already strong material.  Instead, the muted brushstrokes of Gary Winick (the man behind '13 Going on 30' and `Bride Wars') can create a dullish tone to the film.  Hey, this is Winick's best film to date, but it may be his least imaginative directorial effort.

Still, this is a must see; a film I highly recommend!",1296604800,,2429,4.644028103044496

7974164,3,B000077VRX,"Shot in less than two weeks on digital video, this charming, lightweight 2002 comedy indeed has the murky look of a home movie complete with shaky camera shots and orange-tinted graininess. If you can overlook that, you will see some smart performances by an unusually high-profile cast and clever writing by Heather McGowan & Niels Mueller in this coming-of-age concoction from director Gary Winick. The plot focuses on Oscar Grubman, a Voltaire-quoting fifteen year old who overanalyzes the world around him like a pubescent Woody Allen, so naturally he is not interested in girls his own age but his attractive stepmother Eve, a medical researcher who can wax poetically about the heart. However, things get even more complicated when he falls into a drunken one-night stand with Eve's best friend, Diane, a free-spirited massage therapist who doesn't come across so much as a hedonist but rather sensible about the ways of love. Naturally Oscar's father Stanley is completely ignorant of what's going on, as is Eve until Oscar confesses his love for her.

At a running time of only 77 minutes, this all speeds by quickly thanks to Winick's overly efficient pacing, and except for Oscar, the characters aren't given much time to be fully drawn out. Aaron Stanford, a 25-year old playing a decade younger, portrays Oscar expertly, updating a younger version of Benjamin Braddock from ""The Graduate"" for the new millennium. And fortunately, Winick recruited the still-luminous Sigourney Weaver as Eve, as she plays her role with a deadpan sincerity befitting the preoccupied stepmother. The late John Ritter plays Stanley without condescending to his befuddled character, but the best performance comes from Bebe Neuwirth, sexy and frisky as Diane. The restaurant scene with the four of them dodging and ultimately discovering the truth of Oscar and Diane's tryst is very well-played out with Neuwirth particularly funny in her insouciance. Even Robert Iler, Tony Jr. from ""The Sopranos"", shows up as Oscar's best friend Charlie, whose down-to-earth doofus provides a nice contrast to Oscar's often pretentious intellect. This is hardly a cinematic milestone, and frankly it makes a case for using the digital video medium sparingly. But it does provide quiet laughs and insightful if rather predictable observations.",1117238400,3,2318,5.281842818428184
