8390777,5,B000055ZHN,"This is one of my favorite films. A suprisingly candid, though often surreal, look into 1970s Mexico and the lives of indigenous people forced into the cities to look for work. That is not the half of it. The two interlaced stories, taking place in different time periods (in different dimensions--the real and imagined) is mind-blowing. With a script by Carlos Fuentes, based on a story by Juan Rulfo, directed by Francois Reichenbach and with a score by Vangelis (VANGELIS!) and filmed in Mexico with an amazing cast. I wish this were available on DVD!",1354320000,,554,4.842105263157895
