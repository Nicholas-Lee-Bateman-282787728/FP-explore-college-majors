8162485,4,B000LP50DG,"I don't want to be bullied to death by the undeserving awful people around me.  Unfortunately, Yoon Ling Yuk's films are mostly about bullying without any justice - it always ends in tragedy.  That's unacceptable.

A year after this film, the actress was reported to have committed suicide due to rumormongering and attacks by the press.  I hope this was just a cover story to get her out of Shanghai because she was working with filmmakers in Occupied Shanghai who were intent on producing films that hinted at what was really going on in that Japanese controlled city.  Given the story of what happened to to Wu Deep (Butterfly) not at the hands of a CHINESE warlord but Japanese military, it's not unlikely that the Japanese were interested in making one of THEIR typical fims using a very popular if not the most popular actress at the time who happened to be in Shanghai and therefore under their control.

This is a very good movie in its restored form.  Given the different editions and the fact of Chinese bootlegs, I would wait for it to air on Turner Classic Movies again rather than buying it without testing the quality of the dvd.

This is a very sophisticated story and somehow captures great details including skin texture so I am very surprised.  It does not feel dated but it does communicate the heavy heart of invaded China even though the Japanese are not mentioned because everything coming out of Shanghai was censored by the Japanese.

This film was made two years after the bombing of Shanghai and Peach Girl was completed on the eve of the Japanese invasion so somehow Yoon Ling Yuk's short career and life was a part of the Chinese experience with the Japanese invasion.  Very tiring, very frightening, very debilitating, very costly.  It hangs over this film like a heavy shadow and reminds me of how postwar China knew of  and loved Vivien Leigh primarily from Waterloo Bridge also about a wartime prostitute.

It's interesting that TCM chose to air this film followed by two Japanese films about prostitutes and infidelity.  The difference is fundamental.  Yoon Ling Yu's character openly dislikes the attentions of a rich wastrel who if she had faked pleasure at his company could have made her life easier.",1383523200,,2237,4.771428571428571
8162486,5,B000LP50DG,"A silent film in 1934 in China, when the rest of the world had moved to talkies in 1930, that's surprising. But this film is probably a masterpiece. And yet the subject is simple. A prostitute wants to provide her son with an education. The film is about the difficulties she meets on the way to this objective.

First of all her pimp is stealing her money all the time. Then the slandering rumors and then protest letters of other parents in the name of the reputation of their children. The headmaster of the school is ready to concentrate on his mission, which is to educate the child and not consider the mother. But he has to resign and the others get rid of the kid.

Then the mother wants to leave the city where they are known but she finds out her pimp has stolen her money one more time. She confronts him and finally attacks him with a bottle. The court of justice to which she is brought will not look for extenuating circumstances and will send her to prison for twelve years and the child to some special education school.

But then the headmaster who had resigned for the child decides to visit her and get her authorization to take care of the child and provide him with the education he deserves. She agrees and the end is an angelic dream of the mother about the happy future of her son.

This scenario is very typical of its period but it has little in common with what the west was doing at the time or even before. There is no excessive expressivity, no images overloaded with symbolic meaning. The actors play as if they were able to speak, in the most natural way. This acting gives to the argument a believable power that makes it just plain real. It is pure and true truth and nothing else.

The second argument is that the situation and the discourse is possible, believable and serious. No artificial body language, no excessive posturing and contortions, no overdone facial expressiveness. That increases the power of the story and we just accept it as being what may happen everyday around us, if we opened our eyes enough to see it. The film then becomes extremely significant.

But the divine, angelic or idyllic end is surprising in 1934 when the whole world is sinking in the worst crisis ever and when military aggressiveness is growing in all countries or nearly. But the great advantage is that it makes it possible to avoid any kind of easy ideological discourse, like the republican reformism of the Kuomintang or that of the Communist Party of Mao Zedong. And that enables the film to become universal.

8162487,5,B000LP50DG,"The sensitive performance of China's Ruan Ling-yu as a woman forced by society to support her illegitimate son on the streets so he can have a better life is one of the finest in silent cinema. This was the debut film of director Wu Yonggang, who also oversaw the story. Made in 1934, a year before the lovely Ruan would take her own life, the mirroring of her personal life and onscreen persona was already becoming blurred. Gossip and society's injustices play a tragically destructive role in The Goddess. Ruan's performance remains as fresh today as it was over seven decades ago, an added poignancy stemming from our knowledge that her voice would be silenced forever in 1935.

The film opens in 1934 Shanghai, Wu using his lens to explore the inhumanity of society by placing the spotlight on a nameless young woman of the streets. It is a time when an unwed mother in such circumstance had few choices in China, and even fewer options. Ruan is tender and sad as she cares for her son by day and does what she must on the streets of Shanghai by night. A chance encounter while running from the police puts her in the sights of a lazy gambler (Zhang Zhizhi) who inserts himself into the young mother's life. Ruan is helpless to stop this invasion on her sanctuary because he knows of her life now. An attempt to break free only fails when he not only finds her again, but holds harm to her son over her head.

Ruan makes the most of her circumstances by finding a hiding place for cash, using it to send her boy to school so he can have the chance for happiness that she does not. Ruan Ling-yu marvelously captures the joy over her son's opportunity, and desperation not to let it unravel when gossip about his parents threaten destroy it all. A sympathetic principal who believes society has a responsibility to her son, and is understanding of Ruan's great sacrifice, cannot dissuade the others, however. He holds firm, resigning in protest when his arguments fail, and they decide against her. The hope and joy she felt each time she picked her son up at school is shattered, and she know they must try somewhere else. When her secret stash of money is found by Zhang, a confrontation will lead to a further slide for Ruan. The caring principal will come see her one last time, offering a solution as kind as it is heartbreaking, but one which will allow Ruan to at least live in her dreams.

Wu's story is touchingly realized by Ruan Ling-yu in a subtle performance of bittersweeet sacrifice demanded by society. Gossip and expectations in conflict with human kindness and understanding were themes that would haunt Ruan's private life as well. So much did she mean to young women in her country, that among the miles of mourners who made the trek to pay their respects, three chose to join her. The Goddess is a tender reminder of a great talent lost, but always remembered through her films. Only prints of this Lianhua Film Company production taken from the China Film Archive are complete, and in good shape. Tracking one of these down may be difficult, but preferable to other prints, such as listed here. The one I viewed is region free, with music by Kevin Purrone. A must see for silent film fans.",1303430400,3,3214,4.586086956521739
8162488,2,B000LP50DG,"I was asked if I wanted to write a review on The Goddess 1934 (silent). Yes I do want to write a review...but it is difficult for me to do, because I saw this wonderful film on TCM and liked it very much. I wanted to share it with my family, so I bought the DVD on Amazon. I saw the movie with my family, but it was not exactly the same as the one I saw earlier. The film quality was poor and the subtitles were not in sync., very often. I think there were some missing parts in the DVD version. Amazon was kind enough to replace it, but the one I received in its place, was the same as the first DVD.

So...the good is...I liked the movie very much and it is well worth seeing...the bad is... it was not well duplicated from the original I had seen...the ugly is...well, the DVD version was kind of a mess!

Amazon customer service was very good!
