8237705,5,B0010DYK0C,"A bittersweet, honest, intimate look at the members of a resilient farm family as they cope with the nearly impossible consequences of change.",1519862400,,142,5.217391304347826
8237706,3,B0010DYK0C,"Director James Spione interviews his cousin Langdon ""Lanny"" Ames and Lanny's extended family. You won't learn much about dairy farming or the pressures farmers face in this film. Nothing is said about what type of cows they have, where they sell their milk, the prices being paid by milk processors, cost of equipment, caring for dairy cows, or agricultural politics. You will get to watch Lanny pull a newborn calf from its mother with a rope around its feet and then drag it across the floor by a rope around its neck.

What you will learn about is the Ames family, their internal squabbles, the personalities, how one son joined the Marines to get away, how another rejected his family to do the will of Jesus, how the daughters worked in the house and the sons worked in the barn, their holiday get togethers, etc.

The problem, it seems, is that managing Lanny's dairy farm in New York is backbreaking work, and none of Lanny's children wants to take up the burden. Lanny may have to sell the farm that's been in his family for five generations. The film should have been named ""Ames, An American Farmer.""",1296864000,,1110,4.629441624365482
8237707,3,B0010DYK0C,"The demise of the American Farm is a compelling subject.  How did we go from a 40% agrarian to 2% society in less than two generations?

However, there is a lot of gabbing by the interviewees that evoke small lives rather than the big picture.

The poor video and editing quality is more like family videos rather than documentary material.

There were not enough cuts.  Not enough juxtapositions.

Too much unmediated talking by people who just know their own lives and do not see themselves as part of a pattern (perhaps some pointed questions would have provoked them to give better answers).  There should have been narration or some attempt to place this family in a larger context and a historical timeline, census figures or economic trends.

A MUCH better farm documentary is Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern.  That interspersed the family within broader trends.",1296518400,,869,4.979166666666667
8237708,5,B0010DYK0C,Very interesting real life documentary on a dairy farm. Dairy farmers are some of the hardest working people on earth. We enjoyed this very much and will watch it over many times. Well worth the money.,1266192000,3,201,4.611111111111111
8237709,5,B0010DYK0C,"This is one of the best, and least known, documentaries of the last few years, a personal and poignant exploration of an American farm family's struggle to hold onto their legacy.  The director is cousin to many of the people he interviewed, and he manages to elicit some strikingly honest and at times profoundly moving testimony from his extended clan.  Spanning a hundred years of rural history, ""American Farm"" explores the increasing difficulty of holding onto tradition in the modern world. A haunting and heartfelt elegy for a way of life that is rapidly vanishing in this country.  Not to be missed.",1207180800,9,607,4.931372549019608
8237710,5,B0010DYK0C,"This film takes you back to a time--no, make that a vanishing moment in our very own time.  I challenge you to swap one day of your rushed, grasping existence for one day on this dairy farm, where the land, animals, and a family have mutual supported each other for eleven decades in Upstate New York. And if you spend that day, you might just choose it for life.  It would depend on the day you arrived.  It might be a day all gold and green in May, or a day all gold and brown in October.  Arrive in August, the crops are gold, and you must gather every bit of that gold into the barn.  Arrive in February, and your life depends on whatever gold is left in the haymow.

Robert Frost told us that ""nothing gold can stay.""  And sadly, that is true of the family farms of America.  This video captures a family in the aching process of letting go. The film captures the convergence of the end of a way of life--happening to hundreds of thousands of families--and the dynamics of one particular family. You will be astonished by the honesty.  You'll be enchanted by the vistas of Upstate New York, where some of the country's least known natural beauty lies.  The music will linger on your mind.  American Farm is a treasure.",1202601600,15,1223,4.343612334801762
