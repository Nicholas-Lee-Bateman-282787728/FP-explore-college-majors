8525559,4,B0085EG5YS,"While I'm happy I purchased this set, I felt the price was a bit salty. I recall this was offered at a lower price previously. However, if you enjoy the genre, particularly actors, George Zucco and Lionel Atwill, these films will entertain. The quality of the movies is good, but I would've liked to have subtitles included.",1486944000,2,324,4.701754385964913

8525561,5,B0085EG5YS,"For years I have been hoping for some of these B thrillers to be released on DVD. These films can be bought separately or as part of this 5 discs set exclusive to Universal with limited distribution. Please note that the films are half the price when purchasing the set. While some younger viewers may not really get excited over such films, old Universal Horror fans will certainly remember Lionel Atwill starring in a string of these atmospheric thrillers.

1) Murder in the Zoo - 4 stars
2) House of Horrors - 4 stars
3) The Mad Ghoul - 3 1/2 stars
4) The Mad Doctor of Market Street - 3 1/2 stars
5) The Strange Case of Doctor RX - 3 stars

The print here looks very good and Universal has included some extras including lots of stills, lobby cards, posters and some on screen trivia about the film. I doubt these films will see a general release, so if you're interested in owning them, you can buy this directly from Universal for $50 buck!......I know, OUCH! I grew up watching this stuff, so I had to have them. I will say that the quality is excellent and despite what some have stated, I found the packaging to be pretty nice, but you'll have to be careful with the brittle type plastic spindles...... Come on Universal open the vaults and release more of your B stock horror films!",1399420800,3,1292,4.401673640167364
8525562,3,B0085EG5YS,"As a huge fan and completeist of all things related to the classic Universal horror films, I had to purchase this box set. However, it is a very mixed bag of titles, there are three Lional Atwill vehicles including the great MURDERS IN THE ZOO, a George Zucco starrer and one with Rando Hatton as the creeper, the forgettable HOUSE OF HORRORS. THE MAD DOCTOR OF MARKET STREET (with Atwill) directed by Joseph H. Lewis is OK, THE MAD GHOUL forgettable and THE STRANGE CASE OD DOCTOR RX (Atwill has a cameo) is a dud and not even a horror movie, but a silly and dull mystery.",1336694400,2,573,4.364485981308412
8525563,3,B0085EG5YS,"This collection of B to B- Universal films is a good addition for a collector of Universal Horror but not, I think, for the casual viewer.  Most are not true horror films but fall more in the Thriller category.  One interesting thing about the collection is all but Murders in the Zoo (one of the better films in the collection) were made during WWII.  In general horror films were not made during the war as they were thought to be demoralizing and not an uplifting experience for a War weary audience.

The ""extras"" are merely short text pieces about the films.  There are no commentaries and no subtitles or closed captioning.  You can actually see on the burnt side of the disk that about 1/3 or less of the surface has been used.  There facts add to my opinion the the disk set is way overpriced.

One last curious thing.  The Motion Picture Production Code which censored movies according to their moral standards from 1930 to 1968 was in full swing when House of Horrors was made in 1946.  If you have the film take a look at the model that is used by the painter in the film.  It seems they skipped a couple things.  I was quite surprised as the movies would not see that again until the 70's.",1314316800,2,1201,4.384615384615385

8525565,3,B0085EG5YS,"This set of Universal ""B"" horror movies is really for die-hard fans of Universal horror who have a desire to complete their collections. No one would buy these films expecting these movies to be in a league with the studios best classic horror films. I purchased this set from TCM (actually another site they use to sell their DVDs). The movies, most of which I had never seen, met my expectations. They were well made despite low budgets and mediocre scripts. The set is almost a Lionel Atwill tribute as he appears in the majority of the films (most of them in the twilight of his career). I chose to buy the complete set rather than the individual films because it was a much better bargain. The cheesy foldout cardboard packaging started to fall apart almost immediately. This really annoyed me as I had paid over $65 for the set. I sent a few emails to TCM offering to purchase the plastic DVD cases that the individual releases come in (I would have even been happy to get just the printed inserts!) but needless to say they never even gave me the courtesy of a response. TCM is really diluting their brand by offering inferior products. The stars are for the films only the packaging deserves no stars.",1294963200,3,1209,4.5504587155963305
8525566,5,B0085EG5YS,"This long awaited offbeat collection of horror/mystery pictures from Paramout and Universal is most enjoyable.  My primary gripe, aside from the omission of SUPERNATURAL and ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, is that Universal makes it available exclusively through Turner Classic Movies.  I prefer buying all my CDs and DVDs on Amazon . . . which allows fast browsing and swift ordering.  Universal has been doing this with other significant collections but I hope they break the trend soon and sell through Amazon as well else I may just have to pass on certain titles.

And while I'm about it, I'm begging Universal to make available through Amazon the balance of the Mae West and W. C. Fields films, THE KING OF JAZZ, and rarities such as Paramount's HONEY from 1929 and THE PHANTOM PRESIDENT with George M. Cohan..  All of the West and Fields films are available abroad, and I dislike being denied access to our own, home grown, film heritage.",1292371200,,935,4.81875
8525567,1,B0085EG5YS,"A collection of good films, certainly not great, but good and enjoyable.  Though,I do say, that Murders in the Zoo is a great film!  Yet, the price for this collection is outlandish and terrible!  This collection is also available on the Turner Classic Films website, for less than half this price, as it is a TCM release.  I believe their price is too much, as well, though far more affordable than the Amazon.com price. Someone is trying to rip you off, and hope you don't realize that TCM offers it, as well.  Be warned!",1287446400,24,523,4.5212765957446805
