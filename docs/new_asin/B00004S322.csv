1345770,5,B00004S322,"I've been a fan of Peake since the late 80's when I finally was able to find the books at a book store, something of a feat in the USA during the 80's. In the UK, Peake is up there with the greats, stuff you read in high school. In the USA, you mention Gormenghast you generally get puzzled looks. I have to thank the British Singer Robin Hitchcock for my entree into the series, which he listed as his favorite bit of literature in a Q & A I read about him long ago.
The dramatization is fantastic. The Steerpike character is just as powerful a manipulator in the movie as he is in the book. Although he might have something of a sympathetic background, he is truely evil incarnate!
As a therapist I love all the charactarizations for the layers of neurotic and psychotic behaviors they all display!
I recommend the books, and this DVD to darn near everyone. Enjoy!",994982400,3,866,4.351851851851852
1345771,1,B00004S322,"I was REALLY looking forward to this mini-series.  Then, I actually saw it.  Perhaps it was better in the wide-screen version, as suggested by another reviewer, but surely it couldn't be any WORSE an adaptation!
Where is the Hall of Bright Carvings?  Why does a 14 yr.old look 28?  Why are scenes there that do not exist in Peake's writings??  (Steerpike ""dropping in"" on Titus' naming ceremony, for instance.)
Christopher Lee was the best thing about it.
If you HAVEN'T read the novels and enjoy fantasy, you will probably enjoy this video/DVD.  If you know the works, steer clear of this one.  :(",994896000,9,598,4.747572815533981
1345772,5,B00004S322,"After seeing this movie on PBS, I was astounded, intriuged...nothing modern has held my attention quite like Gormenghast did.  You could see the thoughts running through the actors heads as if they were the actual characters, but you were left guessing as if they were too complex to possibly analyze.  Until the final point in the movie, you never completely understand any character.  There was quite a bit of overacting, but it meshes well, as everything was overdone.  But it fits well, as Gormenghast seems a world full of overdone, extrodinary, bizzare and twisted creatures.  Don't let that throw you off from enjoying this movie.",994723200,,637,5.0285714285714285
1345773,1,B00004S322,"No film of a book will ever, ever match up to what images have been conjured in ones imagination, with this in mind I was prepared for the let down. However, no matter how much I have tried I cannot get myself to like it. Prunesquallor for one seems more serious than in the novel, his annoying laughs are missed. Another thing, the dialogue seems so cheesy on film, it is unwatchable at times. To be fair this isn't the worst adaption of a great work of literature, some performances (Steerpike's for one) are not bad. I just think that this could have been great, if only Terry Gilliam had got to it first. A dark trilogy turned into a light comic drama, if you like that sort of thing and haven't read the books then you might like it, if you have read them then try not to allow your memory to be tainted.",994032000,6,809,4.225806451612903

1345775,5,B00004S322,"Watching this movie for the first time one tends to be overwhelmed, but Gormenghast does tend to do just that but in a very intoxicating way.  Every character has their own unique charms beautifully brought to light by a fantastic cast.  This cast is very diverse from veteran actors Christopher Lee (Mr. Flay, dedicated manservant of the Lord) and Ian Richardson (ritual bound and not so mentally sound, Lord Sepulchure Groan)to less well knowns like Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Steerpike, Kitchen boy driven by revenge). I first watched Gormenghast to see Jonathan Rhys Meyers performance and was very pleased with all I saw including visually stunning sets and costumes, actors that really seemed to take on their roles and a good plot from beginning to end. Gormenghast does not disappoint.",993945600,9,788,5.10077519379845
1345776,5,B00004S322,"This has to be one of the best fantasy movies without magic that there has ever been.  I adored Jonathan Rhys Meyers' portrayal of Steerpike, and he seemed to be made for the part.  Not to mention he's bloody gorgeous.  But, as for Titus, Andrew Robertson plays the part well.  He seems to understand the pressures of a ritualized life as if he has lived it himself.  All the actors and actresses do every part they play a justice that is rare in a movie based on a literary masterpiece.  The scenary and sets make you believe that you are actually in a place called Gormenghast, that it is more real and alive than just a fictional place in a book. If you have read the Gormenghast trilogy, or just fell in love with the idea of it, watch this movie!  It is the ultimate escape from reality with a handsome, powerhungry kitchenboy, a romantic, lonely dreamer, and a strong, spirited heir.",993945600,3,889,4.450617283950617
1345777,4,B00004S322,"I've seen this in England, and I can faithfully vouch for the fact that yes, the first two volumes of Mervyn Peake's masterpiece trilogy have finally been accorded their due on the screen. I should start by warning fans of the novels that the Gormenghast realized here is much prettier than you would expect; perhaps the film's producers were worried that a vision of the giant castle and its environs as decayed and yellowed as Peake imagined might be too offputting to anyone but fans of the novels? As a result, Gormenghast is slightly too pretty at times to convey the sense of Gothic dissolution Peake intended: even the campsite of the carvers seems gussied up in pretty green decor. And in the central role of Steerpike Jonathan Rhys-Meyers looks smashing and works hard, but fails to turn in the truly bravura performance the part requires (in part because he lacks tremendous physical presence, despite his sneering beauty).

On the other hand, so much is given to us in this version that it would be churlish to complain. Celia Imrie steals the show as the brutally abstract and terrifyingly towering Countess of Groan: she has both the presence and the ability to play the role. The great Fiona Shaw transforms herself exactly into Peake's sketches of Irma Prunesquallor, and Zoe Wanamaker and Lynsey Baxter do something very original and believable as Titus's half-witted and murderous aunts. The special effects are at times jawdropping, and at times the director allows for the off-kilter camera angles--and yes, even the Gothic atmnosphere otherwise missing--that brings you back to Peake's original vision (the library sequence is particularly smashing). This is the kind of adaptation that, even with its few flaws, one would never have dared hope to have seen.",992217600,153,1778,5.027118644067796
1345778,5,B00004S322,"I first heard about Gormenghast when I was watching Red Dwarf on BBC America.  During the commercials, they played a long trailer which showed elaborate costumes, interesting backgrounds (some obviously computer generated), and an odd assortment of characters.  I got the impression that it was some sort of fairy tale.  Best of all, it boasted two of my favorite actors, Christopher Lee and Stephen Fry.
The show came on every Saturday, and I watched each hour or so segment every week.  The story revolves around an old castle called Gormenghast.  The people themselves are born into caste systems, and adhere to the strict rules and rituals of the Kingdom.  Nothing changes; the culture won't let it.  That is, until Steerpike, a young kitchen hand, grows tired of the kitchen life and denounces his caste.  His goal, to seek for better things, and for him better things can only mean greater power.
Now, after the reading the books, I was all the more impresed with the BBC rendition.  While the series had to cut out a lot of scenes, as the trilogy itself is huge, they were very prudent with their cuts.  While they couldn't capture the absurdity and creative flair in its entirety, they also didn't rehash Mervyn Peake (the author's) tendency towards pointless, self-indulgent waste (i.e. cliche romance scenes/dialogue), and occasional repitition (i.e. conversations and thoughts of characters).  However, the acting was superb, the costumes elegant, and the plot as unique as ever.  Above all is Jonathan Rhys-Meyer (Steerpike), and Christopher Lee (Flay).  Also, Zoe Wanamaker and Lynsey Baxter did a superb job playing the mad twin sisters(and stroke victims) Cora and Clarice Groan.  Gormenghast runs miles around anything America produces (i.e. Noah's Ark, The Tenth Kingdom), and deserves, despite its minor flaws (even those from nitpicky Peake fans), nothing short of 5 stars.",989971200,85,1892,5.160655737704918
1345779,4,B00004S322,"The film begins with the birth of the 77th Earl of Gormenghast, which is currently ruled by the 76th Earl. Gormenghast is a large and impressive castle, in which resides the royal Groan family.
Little do they know, someone is trying to bring them down.  A lowly kitchen boy who charms his way up the ranks within the castle walls.
Funny at times and moving at others, Gormenghast is a great film brought to life by the exotic characters which help it move at an easy-to-follow pace. The movie goes without special effects, in hopes to keep it believable.
Not your everyday movie, but then again what is 'every day' these days? Grab a few bags of popcorn, as it is rather a long film (in its entirety), and sit back and enjoy the new name in fantasy; Gormenghast.",986688000,3,762,4.482014388489208

I did not read the books, but I purchased this based on reviews by people who had read the books.  It was an interesting story, but not the calibre film I expected.

1345797,5,B00004S322,"I have to admit I am somewhat taken aback by all the negative reviews I'm reading of this film from Mervyn Peake's fans. I thought the BBC cast and crew did a fantastic job of bringing these books to life - something I have not seen done well since The Princess Bride made the jump from page to screen. I tend to be very critical of book-to-film projects, but this one was handled beautifully. Of course they had to cut things, and of course it's not identical to the books. To expect that would be unrealisitic. But they did an amazing job considering what an immensely difficult task it is to ever do these well. I for one love to watch this film repeatedly.

I also have several friends who are just not quite up to the daunting task of reading Mervyn Peake's writing. One has to admit that reading his style is work - it's dense, thick, rich and bombastic, which, before anyone gets defensive, is WHY I love it. I read it to relax, in fact. It's comfort food for my mind. I adore his writing. But most people I've spoken to about it find it harder to read than the Silmarillion, which is infamously unreadable even to diehard Tolkien fans. Peake's brilliant and convoluted technique puts his work beyond the reach of the common man, which is a tragedy, because he is clearly a master of both plot and style. Putting it on film has made Peake's imagination accessible to the common man, which I can only see as a good thing. It was done with love and reverence for the original format, and this is obvious in every costume and prop.

I would like to grow extra arms (or at least extra hands) so I could give this a thousand thumbs up!",1416355200,2,1637,4.34640522875817

1345805,3,B00004S322,"It's ironic that the very people who are most likely to want to watch this mini-series --those who have read the Gormenghast books -- will be the very same people who will be most likely to be disappointed. Mervyn Peake's books are among those which are appreciated for the way the story is told perhaps even more than for the details of the story; thus, it would be impossible for a film maker to duplicate the experience the books provide. Most readers will realize these limitations and are prepared to forgive much creative license, but....

For a book-to film transition to be effective for readers of the book, at least the tone must be consistent, and the film should have at least a fairly close duplication of the plot. This offering did a reasonable job with the plot, but the tone was entirely wrong, and it changed the whole feel of the story.

It all starts going off-kelter with the appearance of the castle, which is not a crumbling Gothic ruin, but a sort of fanciful combination from The Arabian Nights and Cinderella. Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast books have the tone and feel of Charles Dickens at his very darkest and even the Brothers Grimm; this presentation has a much different tone, ranging from early Walt Disney  to Tim Burton. At no time does the villain Steerpike, as portrayed by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, become convincing as a sociopathic megalomaniac. The supporting characters, who in the novels are indeed darkly humorous and grotesque, are portrayed more as broadly comedic. It just all felt wrong.

I lack proper judgment about how someone who has not read the books will perceive the film;  I suspect they will be captivated, because the plot itself is fascinating, and this rendition has a style all its own. I speak only to those who love the books; I suspect you will be disappointed.",1396742400,2,1818,4.758730158730159

1345809,3,B00004S322,"The BBC's four part adaptation aired in 2000. Mervyn Peake's wonderful gothic novels (of the three, only the first two are covered by the series) describe a gothic, labyrinthine and deeply immersive world of Dickensian characters, Macciavellian schemings and dark, dark humour. To bring this masterpiece to the screen was always going to be a tough ask and Malcolm McKay and Andy Wilson nearly pull it off. Nearly.

It suffers from a number of handicaps and faults... Whatever the budget was, it could never have been enough to convey the rambling, shambolic, oppressive castle that Peake built for his characters. But what we get looks more Disneyland than anything else, especially in the wide-shot scenes. Gormenghast was grey and heavy, not light, colourful and airy. The interior scenes do much better with a rich yet dusty and neglected baroque feel.

The all-star casting is certainly impressive and possibly the series' high point. Almost all of the characters look and act much as I'd imagined them from the book. Christopher Lee's Flay, June Brown's Nannie Slagg, Imrie's Lady Groan are all excellent and I especially enjoyed Prunesquallor (John Sessions) and Zoe Wanamaker and Lynsey Baxter as the two sisters Cora and Clarice. Then there's Titus' professors; the inimitable Stephen Fry is supported by Mark Williams, Martin Clunes, Steve Pemberton and Phil Cornwell with a charming (and brief) appearance by Spike Milligan (his last performance) as Headmaster De'Ath. I could go on... but all this hard thespianism is badly let down by probably the two central characters. Although he looks the part, Jonathan Rhys Meyers overacts theatrically as Steerpike and Neve Mackintosh's Lady Fuschia (why in god's name was Lady Fuschia played by an adult?) is barely any better . They play their parts as if it were a Broadway Musical production and I honestly expected them to break into Phantom of the Opera-esque song at several points.

The two books (Titus Groan and Gormenghast) are not short and one can imagine the difficulties in shoehorning the story into a four hour mini-series (arguably they deserved at least six). McKay manages the task well enough; although the screenplay is ludicrously telescoped in places, the sense of the plot is not lost and a modicum of pace is retained. Perhaps the nuances of Peake's storytelling go astray but one can't have it all I suppose.

In the round, this IS an enjoyable and relatively faithful adaptation of a true classic buoyed by some inspired casting and equally inspired acting. If it didn't get the pre- and post-production attention garnered by TV adaptations of more populist classics (Pride and Prejudice, for instance) then perhaps that is only to be expected.",1387411200,2,2726,5.105381165919282

1345819,3,B00004S322,"The birth of Titus Groan, heir to the vast castle of Gormenghast, is a time of great joy and happiness for the inhabitants. However, it also marks the beginnings of the rise to power of Steerpike, an ambitious boy from the kitchens who uses his ruthless schemes to secure a position of power and influence. As Titus grows to manhood, increasingly doubtful of his place in a castle steeped in tradition and ritual, so Steerpike's ambition, power and greed grows as well.

Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast Trilogy is one of the defining and most important works of the modern fantasy genre, a densely-written work of tremendous atmosphere and power. On a surface read it is also quite unfilmable, with much of the action in the book motivated by conflicts that are internalised within the characters and much of the storyline and characters being too offbeat, weird or surreal to be commercially viable.

This is probably why only the BBC - a public-service broadcaster which cares little about commercial success but has access to large budgets - could have even attempted a faithful adaptation of the series to television. This four-episode mini-series covers the first two books of the series, Titus Groan and Gormenghast. The third book, Titus Alone, was not attempted due to its significant budgetary requirements, time constraints and it being far too strange even by the standards of the rest of the trilogy.

To bring the books to the screen, the BBC spent a considerable amount of money. Filmed in 1999 and broadcast the following year, the serial has certainly dated (particularly the sections where greenscreen was obviously used) in respect to its composite work, but otherwise has held up well in terms of production values. The sets are highly impressive (especially when the castle is flooded during a downpour) and the costumes are superb. The effects work (by itself) is decent, although the matte paintings and CGI versions of the castle proved controversial amongst fans of the books. The BBC version of Gormenghast is arguably much more colourful than Peake's grey, crumbling ruin, with the TV version taking more overt inspiration from China's Forbidden City (Peake spent most of his first eleven years in China, where his parents were missionaries).

The casting is mostly excellent, with what feels like very British actor and comic of note at the time recruited for the project. Ian Richardson plays the increasingly befuddled Earl of Gormenghast, whilst Celia Imrie - better known for his comic roles - plays his wife, the cold, austere and commanding Lady Gertrude with a steely presence. The series features a very early appearance by Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Henry VIII in The Tudors) as Steerpike in a performance which veers between the convincingly conniving and threatening to painful over-acting at times (especially towards the end of the mini-series). Dominating the cast with his presence, gravitas and of course voice is Christopher Lee as Mr. Flay, the Earl's manservant who falls into disgrace and then appoints himself Steerpike's nemesis. Richard Griffiths is also notable as the head cook, Swelter, whose feud with Flay dominates the first half of the serial. Zoe Wanamaker and Lynsey Baxter also do great work as the isolated and confused Groan sisters, Cora and Clarice. Particularly impressive is Neve McIntosh as Fuschia, who plays a difficult character with conviction and succeeds in making her likable, despite her many moments of selfishness. Stephen Fry makes for a splendid Professor Bellgrove, and the mini-series is notable for one of the last appearances of the legendary Spike Milligan before his passing. Less successful is Andrew Robertson as the grown-up Titus, who lacks charisma and suffers the most from his internal conflicts not being readily accessible to the viewer.

So the production values are good and the cast - mostly - excellent. How does the mini-series fare overall? Well, it's okay. It's not brilliant, mainly due to the jarring tonal shifts. The Gormenghast novels move between comedy, farce, surrealism, gothic grotesquerie and powerful drama with ease, sometimes within the same scene. The TV show is much less successful in handling these movements, with the writing not often being up to the job (the TV show's tendency to use un-Peake-like swearing to punctuate moments of drama or comedy is obvious and dull). The comic moments tend to descend into bad farce with ease, not helped by a miscast John Sessions as Dr. Prunesquallor (he does his best and is occasionally even effective, but most of the time irritates). The compression of two 400-page novels into just four hours also sees entire storylines handled badly. There simply isn't enough time to handle the storyline of Keda and her baby and it should really have been exorcised entirely rather than shrunk into a few, highly confusing scenes. Elsewhere, Bellgrove's romance with Prunesquallor's sister may be taken from the book but it does feel like a large and unnecessary divergence from the central matters of Steerpike and Titus, and perhaps should have been condensed (to give the Keda storyline more time, as it impacts on Titus much more directly).

At the same time, when the serial does work, it works brilliantly. The flooding of Gormenghast, a highly evocative scene in the novels and one that you'd assume would not be possible to depict on a TV budget, is actually successful. Christopher Lee is awesome every time he's on the screen, and Neve McIntosh's excellent performance as Fuschia gives her character's storyline even more pathos and tragedy than in the novel (heresy!). Jonathan Rhys Meyers also seems to raise his game when in scenes with either of them, or with Celia Imrie. Gertrude is a highly unpleasant character, but Imrie plays her with total conviction and her single-minded ruthlessness, which makes her unlikable for much of the serial, suddenly becomes rather admirable when she uses it to remorselessly hunt down Steerpike.

Ultimately, the BBC version of Gormenghast (***) is unable to capture the full power of Peake's novels (no adaptation ever could), though some of the author's genius is successfully captured in fleeting moments. The excellent casting, solid production values and those scenes which really work certainly make the series worth watching, although a strong degree of teeth-grinding patience may be necessary to make it through the less successful moments (and much of the first episode, which is all over the place in quality before it starts to settle down).

1345827,4,B00004S322,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this tv series is best viewed after reading TITUS GROAN and GORMENGHAST (I'd skip the third book in the trilogy--TITUS ALONE as it isn't anywhere near the standard of the first two books and the minseries doesn't cover it anyway). Watching the tv adaptation after reading the books was like listening to a series of in-jokes that I was in on because I'd read the books. It was intriguing and entertaining.

I only had two problems with it: 1) I wish they'd had the budget to truly do the setting justice. As it was, the sets felt like the background in those BBC Shakespeare play adaptations they make you watch in high school. And Titus Groan and Gormenghast were all about the setting. I remember feeling vertigo reading about the teacup rolling off the trunk of the tree growing out of side of the castle and falling hundreds of feet to the ground. That scene didn't work at all on tv. The tree looked fake.

2) Steerpike. I'm at a loss to understand why the powers-that-be cast such a conventional-looking actor long past his adolescence to play the 17-year old Steerpike. Steerpike, who, in a world of grotesquely ugly people is the most fantastically ugly of all. You only have to look at Peake's illustrations (Along with being a writer, he was one of the most successful professional illustrators of his day) to realize why Steerpike has such a chip on his shoulder. If you looked like that, you would too. His high, bony forehead, his narrow hunched shoulders that looked almost deformed. There's none of that in the Steerpike of the miniseries--they didn't even attempt to make him look ugly. Also, Steerpike is the driving force of the books. He's brilliant and ambitious and for most of the books, he's the most alive character in them. Not so with the miniseries. The actor didn't have the spark that made Steerpike such a compelling character. He looked too old and too normal to even hope to pull it off.",1246406400,6,1954,4.6773255813953485

As I watched the long (240 minutes) dvd over the course of several evenings, I glimpsed fragments of the book I remembered, but suspected, as other reviewers have pointed out, that some deviations, both in plot and flavor have been made.  Same issue that fans of the Trilogy had when they apprehensively stepped up to see it.  Had they ruined the classic?
In any case, it's an interesting dvd, worth looking at if you enjoy surrealistic fantasy. Actually, it's more like Dickens on acid directed by Dali.
The ending seems like a quick rap-up after a lengthy prologue (kind of like Dune did).  Steerpike does Les Miserables, then a cheesy Phantom of the Opera transformation, Fushia does Ophelia from Hamlet, and Lady Gertrude does her turn as Queen Elizabeth.  Who knows what Titus does?  Parsifal, Jim Bridger, Tarzan?  All of which I didn't remember, so I'll have to read the books again.",1239148800,4,1073,4.767567567567568

Important aspects of many character's attitudes are changed or completely reversed, dialogues exactly opposite to those in the book are inserted at will, events are truncated and/or changed from something that had unique atmosphere and dimension in the book into brief trivialized escapades, such as Steerpike's escape from the room Flay locks him in early on, etc.  The pity is that I assume the producer/writer/director think they are reworking the story without creating a total farce of the original book.  It should be done again by a protege of Orson Welles a la THE TRIAL, with scenes in black and white alternating with those in color.

1345831,4,B00004S322,"I ordered ""Gormenghast"" on the basis of the favorable reviews offered by other Amazonian viewers. Having only ""perused"" the Peake novels, I came into the Groan's world as a newbie, with no real expectations of liking, loving, or disliking the mini-series.

I was pleasantly surprised with the vigor and boldness of the direction. The wide camera angles, the purposely muted colors of all of the characters' clothing, all added to the trippy-dippy feel that is the daily life of Gormenghast.

It was interesting to see the huge view of the castle from the opening scenes (and throughout the film), then gain an almost claustrophobic feeling in the quite small bedrooms of the main characters. Metaphorically, it shows that although one may live in this large, open space, our inner sanctums are what's most important; the veritable fishbowl of life.

Zoe Wanamaker and Lynsey Baxter do a superb rendition of the ""simple sisters,"" Ladies Clariss and Cora. Christopher Lee can do no wrong in any role he tackles (although for me, he is the quintessential Saruman of the LOTR trilogy). Although I do agree with an earlier reviewer that Neve McIntosh was a *touch* too mature to play Lady Fuchsia in parts 1 and 2, she's a welcome part of acts 3 and 4. Celia Imrie (who was fantastic in CALENDAR GIRLS) was virtually unrecognizable in her puffy suit. Even underneath all of that unattractive veneer, she gives an impressive performance. The young actors playing Titus convey a potent sense of loneliness and frustration over his lack of options in life.

This miniseries belongs to 2 actors though: John Sessions as Dr. Prunesquallor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Steerpike. Sessions' Prunesquallor is equal parts absurdity and calculating wisdom. But young JRM is a marvel (as always). Not overdoing it, chomping scenery, his Steerpike is a grasping, sucking, social climber, whom will let nothing (nor anyone) get in his way. This is possibly Rhys Meyers' strongest performance to date.

If you're a fan of sci-fi, this is an interesting work to pick up and view. Reading of the Peake novels isn't a prerequisite to enjoying ""Gormenghast.""",1214179200,6,2134,5.016949152542373

The dialog in Gormenghast novels is muted, brief, and obscure.  All of which make producing a nomal-looking movie rather difficult. The explication of the thoughts of the characters is rather more accessible, but is hard to do in a movie unless you want a constant murmer of voice unders.

From the opening ""montage"" (really the best way to describe it), ""Gormenghast"" delivered NONE of the excellent mood and feel of the novel (remember those opening pages, describing a bleak castle and the tenaments which had recently sprung up due to the peculiar holiday? Somehow, this became almost a musical opening in the television version!). I finally gave up on it, after suffering through the incredibly poor casting of Steerpike.

The series is absolutely dripping with symbolism (as the original)--from the name of the feudal family, Groan, to the absurd daily rituals, to the very (ehem) feminine opening that lets young Titus out of the castle walls.  Though it is possible to  enjoy the series in a superficial way for the sheer spectacle, I feel now that I want to read some literary criticism of Peake's work to find out exactly which government he was poking fun at and why.

It combines fantasy elements with a story of court intrigue and ambition, played by a cast of oddball characters that simply has to be seen. This isn't just a low-budget way to fill a few hours of air time, it's a comical costume drama of the finest sort.

We start with Swelter, the rotund, ruddy cook, a stereotype and caricature of the kitchen master. Below-stairs, he pursues a vicious rivalry against Flay, the personal and bizarrely inarticulate servant of Lord Sepulchrave, Lord of Groan. By now, you should be ready for other characters' names: obsequious Prunesquallor, ditzy lady Fuschia, and grasping Steerpike. Ornate costuming brings these cartoon-like characters to life, or something larger than life. The actors, too, do an over-the-top job with a script that demands all the over-acting, over-emoting, and over-everything that they can manage.

1345843,5,B00004S322,"This is miniseries is an adaptation of the Gormenghast series  of books by  Peake.

There is nothing quite like  the Gormenghast trilogy and the BBC did a spectacular job  putting Gormenghast  on the screen. The genre  of these story is fantasy but the story oozes with social commentary about human relations, power and the British class system.

The BBC seemed to spare no expense  in bringing these books to life with opulent costumes and sets.

Gormenghast is a mythical kingdom steeped in tradition. It is so steeped in tradition it is causing a decay from within  and  is as crumbling and Byzantine as Gormenghast castle itself. The kingdom  is dying of entropy  and the royal family  each has their own specific  type of madness and shortsightedness.

Through out most of the picture, aided much by its pacing, the viewer  feels a great sense of foreboding.

The magnificent camera  work shows  the world of Gormenghast  as at times  sparklingly  hyper crisp to atmospheric and moody.

In Gormenghast every one is born to a station in life each having its own rigid code of conduct. The ruling family of Gormenghast is the family Groan ( all of the  names of the characters are somewhat tongue in check and very appropriate to the characters). There is some detail paid to he family tree as it becomes an important part of the story.

In the midst of the society of the aging kingdom is a kitchen helper named Steerpike. He hates his position in life and schemes to get himself  out of the kitchen and  rise to a position of power. Through careful manipulation and creating convenient disasters (such as setting the  kingdom's library ablaze to make himself a hero to rescue a member of the royal family) he makes himself in the eyes of the kingdom  an indispensable person. He pits members of the royal family Groan against each other until  he is  courting the King  daughter and finally  put  almost on par  with the heir apparent himself, Titus Groan.

The characters are over the top caricatures and are bizarre and surreal. All of them are strange  but to give a sense of them, thereby trying to give a sense of the movie, I will list a few here.

The King, Lord Groan, is played by Ian Richardson. He is a rigid but an indecisive figure  who for the most part hides in his library. When the library is burned he looses  his mind.
His wife Gertrude, is an enormous woman (the actress who plays Gertrude wears a preposterous fat suit for her role), who when not domineering  lavishes  her attention on her cats while being distant with her children.
The ""twins"" are two middle aged women, sisters of the King who are  ridiculously dim witted and Steerpike finds them easy to manipulate. They act as they are of one mind as if they were Siamese twins.
Steerpike himself is a complex  character. He is a handsome young man  and though mostly he is  the embodiment of evil and blind ambition there is initially something heroic about his desire to better himself. In most stories he might  be cast as a hero but his cruelty and treachery know no bounds.
Other  absurd character include the cook named Swelter. Swelter is a special effect unto himself. He is a huge man, always boiling  with sweat, with strange looking protruding teeth that give him the appearance  of a  crazed wild boar. When not going about his  cooking chores he is maniacally sharpening knives and attempting to kill anyone who crosses him.

I recommend you to enter the strange world of Gormenghast as presented in this brilliant film. It is a movie that you will stick with you and that you will want to see again and again.",1117670400,14,3607,4.621835443037975
1345844,1,B00004S322,"I read so many of the reviews both for the Gormenghast books and the DVD prior to purchasing this DVD.  To be quite honest, I wanted the books in hard cover but since they're so expensive on the used book market I thought I'd sample the DVD first to be sure I'd be buying books I'd like to read more than once.

Now, that being said, you must understand I am an ardent fantasy-a-holic.  I have been reading fantasy since my introduction to the genre in 1977 (the hobbit) and still after all these years simply adore a good fantasy novel.  Robert Jordan, Robin Hobb, Raymond Feist, David Eddings, Stephen Donaldson, Ursala LeGuin, Patricia McKillip, Melanie Rawn, the list goes on and on ... I listed some of the authors I enjoy so you would have a feel for the type of books I enjoy!  Fantasy doesn't have to be the old ""Dungeon & Dragons"" stereotypical junk.

It was my hope after reading so many glowing reviews that this series by Mr. Peake would be an enjoyable adult fantasy novel set with incredible character development, well thought out plot line, believable world, and edge of the seat enjoyment - be it political, action, romance, etc.

What I found was the absolute worst ... aargh.  Words fail me.  The characters were unbelievably moronic (I wanted to use the word ""insane"" ... but you might miss my meaning since they clearly ARE insane in the books).  The premise of a castle as large as gormenghast is absurd.  The characters were one dimensional.  Only Steerpike was in any way mildly interesting - I was rooting for him to kill the whole darn batch of other characters off after about 15 mintues of viewing time.

Two sisters mirror each other ... finishing each others sentences ... what little dialog the have is nonsensical.  The King's servant can't make full sentences - ever.  The Cook is an idiot.  The nurse is constantly crying and clearly so decrepid she can't function.  Our villan (Steerpike) is devious, always in the right place at the convenient right time, never caught doing wrong, and completely unbelievable.

How can this be?  This set was compared to Tolkien?!?!?!  Was the reviewer as insane as Groan?

The DVD set is a two disk set with approx 4 hours of viewing time.  The first viewing I managed to force myself to watch about 1 hour of video.  The next day I forced myself to try for another 1/2 hour.  I finally gave up when Groan was attacked by owls.  Oh, for goodness sake.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.  Anything else.  Truely anything.  Anything but Gormenghast.

1345845,5,B00004S322,"Based on the wonderful fantasy novels of Mervyn Peake, this adaptation manages to capture the wonder and otherness of Gormenghast.  The basic story line has been described by others, so suffice it to say that we are introduced to a world where nothing has changed for at least 77 generations.  We meet the ruling family, a sad, meek earl, his wife (who utters the wonderful line -- when shown the newborn son -- ""Take him away and bring him back when he is 6!""), his flighty, desperate for attention daughter, Fuscia, etc. The kitchen boy who wants advancement at the sacrifice of everyone else, Steerpike.  All these characters are so finely drawn.  And the language in the books is just so florid and unlike anything else I can think of (Peake describes one character as having a ""tropical head"").  I loved the story, I loved the writing, but I also loved this film adaptation.  It is just marvelous.  The acting was so good.  I agree that the actress who plays Fuschia was perhaps too old for the initial scenes -- but she managed perfectly.  And the actor who plays Steerpike did an outstanding job.  I have always felt such pity for this miserable, evil character.  It always seemed to me that there could have been a different path for him if he had only had some kindness in his life.  But I especially have praise for the actor who played the doctor, John Sessions, and also for the always grand Christopher Lee, playing Flay.  Finally, one must mention the earl's sisters and their fine characterization.  And also, the actor that played the truly dispicable ""Swelter"" (with all its intimations of child abuse) did a good job.  I recommend this as a must see!",1101686400,12,1668,4.645051194539249
1345846,4,B00004S322,"Yes, it is very different to the books - the ""Hamlet-style"" redrafting of Steerpike can be a problem, particularly when it comes to the artificially-enhanced Steerpike/Fuchsia love story...and yet, somehow, that doesn't stop Gormenghast from being a triumph for all concerned:

1) The handful of people who expected Gormenghast to be gothic horror, with the castle looking like Dracula's abode, haven't been paying enough attention to the book - or to Peake's drawings.

2) The new Steerpike is more attractive than the old - having been converted from pure-evil power-crazed manipulator to rebel-warrior taking revenge on the ruling class for the way they condemned him to sexual abuse at the hands of Swelter (something hinted at vaguely in the film and rather more strongly in the book).

3) Neve McIntosh really shouldn't have been playing the adolescent Fuchsia in the first two episodes - but in the second two episodes she's almost ideal - almost because you could argue she's too beautiful to play Fuchsia (who is ""in a sense, rather ugly..."").

3) The real stars of this particular show - Ian Richardson, Christopher Lee, Celia Imrie and the Cooper/Wanamaker double-act, for inhabiting some of the most difficult characters in modern literature.  Particular kudos to Imrie for her portrayal of the not-as-dumb-as-you-think countess, not easy whilst struggling with all that artificial fat on her face and in her dress!  And to Richardson's descent into madness after the library incident, especially when he becomes the owl-man.

In summation, then - It's certainly not a substitute for the books, but it's a valid alternative-perspective on them. Worth five-ish hours of anyone's time.",1101600000,10,1695,5.2555555555555555
1345847,5,B00004S322,"Being familiar with the Gormenghast trilogy but having missed the dramatisation of it on television I bought this pair of videos thinking that they would cover the story of the first two books. I was not expecting the third, in which Prince Titus flees Gormenghast into the modern world outside, and which is a different story, indeed a different type of story, altogether. Not so, in the event. This film takes us a certain way into the second book, but it leaves the narrative suspended in a way that suggests that we are to expect more. Whether this expectation is valid I have no idea at all.

I certainly hope it is, because I give this production very high marks indeed. It seems to me far better than some of the critical comment suggested at the time. It gets the `feel' of the story for me quite brilliantly. The plot-line is `strange' up to a point because its author, though inspired and original, had more than a few screws loose in the top storey. However the strangeness seems to me to have been greatly overstated, I believe because of the very self-conscious and affected style of writing at the start of the first book. In fact this relaxes into a fairly normal idiom after a few pages, much as the initial harmonic style of Wagner's Tristan only lasts a few bars. The Gormenghast trilogy is fantasy of a fairly familiar type. It depicts the ambience of a huge castle that is a world on its own. It has been there for a thousand years, one gathers, but how it got built, where it might be, how its economy sustains itself and how it manages to avoid contact with the world outside are things one simply does not ask. It is a living museum, dedicated to tradition. Its inmates are a weird harlequinade certainly, but still recognisable human beings, sometimes caricatures, sometimes very realistic indeed, never in my view totally incredible. I don't read it as any kind of allegory, and the satirical elements are random and not focused around any particular theme. I detect no political stance, either in the depiction of traditionalism to the nth degree or in the socialistic views expressed by Steerpike - he was a villain indeed but the author is fairly neutral towards him and of course it would be completely illegitimate to assume that he actually meant what he was saying.

That is my reading of the books, and that is the way this film comes over to me. The casting is nothing short of superlative. Peake was also an artist (a very talented one) and we have his own pictures of some of the dramatis personae. Miss Prunesquallor here is almost Peake's drawing to the life. It would have been more or less impossible, I suppose, to find an actor who looked like Peake's Steerpike, but Jonathan Rhys Meyers carries off the part with aplomb and with a lot of the suggestion of Peake's narrative despite being handsome and personable. The casting of Warren Mitchell as Barquentine is sheer genius. The Countess herself has the right suggestion of a woman with a powerful brain who turns it on and off as the situation requires, Princess Fuchsia is a wonderful piece of enactment of a teenage girl, and I want to put in a special word for the quite marvellous performance turned in by June Brown (familiar to British soap-opera watchers as Dot Cotton of East Enders) as Nanny Slagg. I could go on. Maybe Stephen Fry is on the young side as professor Bellgrove, but my goodness he has style, and I hardly need comment on what to expect from the likes of Christopher Lee and Ian Richardson.

They can't leave it hanging like this - can they? It may be that having covered the contents of one-and-a-half books they are now faced with the problem (which I wouldn't like to try and solve) of how to combine the rest of the second book with the third, which as I say is a horse of another colour. One oddity in such a careful and professional production - my edition of the books, and the sleeve of my videos, know how to spell `Fuchsia', whereas the princess herself doesn't. I have a definite suspicion that none of them did.",1101340800,7,4041,4.571034482758621
1345848,5,B00004S322,"From its bizzare sense of humor to its deranged social structure, Mervyn Peake's masterpiece translates superbly in film. This is a wonderful satirical and poignant look at the narrow world of a dying hierarchy. Nothing is sacred, except honor. Christopher Lee's Flay enforces the great code with protective conviction. Pay close attention to the furious mutterings of Barqentine. He fires off some of the best curse-spitting tirades ever uttered. Celia Imrie's Gertrude is the epitomy of aloof negligence. Though every character is something of a caricature, each is portrayed with great attention to the affection and intention of the novel's author.",1098316800,6,652,5.465346534653466
1345849,4,B00004S322,"The books flesh this production out. Having once seen part of it while walking behind the couch to and from my office while working I would catch glimpses of this strange world on the TV while my wife watched. It was intriguing enough that I chose to buy it and watch the whole thing at my convinience. That done it made clear to me that Peake was going to be worth the read and it has. Enjoy the little offered to view on amazon and read enough to order the set. Friends remember them from years ago and are glad to hear they are available in a new edition. I read comparisons with Tolkien and would agree to some extent. It would be an intriguing thesis to compare fiction of this period in light of the Great War and the impact it had on the British consciousness. Contrast that with Continental Europeans like Mann. Are there any comparisons?

But what about the DVD? The production demonstrates things that can be communicated via film media that are not possible using books and imagination. The artist effort in creating a dress, the luck in finding a white rook that could be trained to do the part, the right mix of actors and parts -- could we really not imagine anyone else doing these roles? All of that adds something to the books that communicates a message about the medium itself. The movie is not the book. The book is not the movie. There is something wonderful that each bring to story telling and imagination that the other lacks. Having both is better than just one or the other alone.",1095811200,7,1506,4.436823104693141
1345850,5,B00004S322,"""Gormenghast"" is an odd series, a little too odd at first glance.  I have never read the books, and didn't even know that a ""Gormenghast"" series existed when I watched it.  I just thought it looked like an interesting fantasy series, so I gave it a try.
It was very surprising, and I had to watch the first episode twice before I got a feel for the series and could get captivated by its peculiar meter and character.  However, when you get sucked in it is as complete a world as ""Labyrinth,"" ""Legend"" or any other such darkly gothic fairy tale kingdoms.  The endless rituals, the conflicting costumes, the affected accents and speeches all combine to create a disturbing reality of crumbling decadence and a society that has run its course, aching for change and new blood.
The amazing actors in this series, many with an impressive fantasy film pedigree, are what pull you in, and force you to believe in the topsy-turvy kingdom.  Christopher Lee (""Lord of the Rings""/""Star Wars""/""Dracula""/Too many to name...) brings you home right away as the brutish but loyal Flay.  It is interesting to see him play such a sympathetic and nobel character, after watching him is so many villain roles.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (""Bend it Like Beckam,"" ""Titus"") is perfect as the charming anarchist Steerpike. who plays a necessary role as a bloody catalyst for change.  Zoe Wanamaker (""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"") and her sister Lynsey Baxter play the bizarre twins perfectly, with an unsettling atmosphere each time they are on screen. Ian Richardson, who comes with an impressive Shakespear resume, portrays the descent into madness of the Earl of Gormenghast, as crumbling as his realm.
The BBC again proves that they know how to make quality programs, allowing for a slow wicked pace and a weird mood along with bright costumes and talented actors.  I highly recomend ""Gormneghast,"" but give yourself some time to get into it.  You might have to watch the first episode twice like I did.",1085616000,60,1988,4.87240356083086
1345851,4,B00004S322,"I haven't read the book, so I can't say how faithful it is to the book or comment on the plot or whatever. As a production, the TV series succeeded in making Gormenghast seem like a huge, isolated, crumbling, bewildering place full of rituals and social hierarchy. The beginning looks like ""Labryinth"", with colourful, fantasy-looking scenery. The castle seems to be made of old painted mud, not brick or stone.
The weird mix of clothing and technology made the series seem even more odd. The ladies wear medieval dress, SteerPike the villian wears regency/victorian dress, and the guards wear world war era uniforms. Towards the end of the series, the medieval wizard-like offices of the secretary look like fascist headquarters, complete with filing units built into the wall. The boats seem like Venetian gondolas, they have modern black umbrellas, yet the Countess and her women look like they're from Elizabeth I's court (to my common layman's eye).
Everybody is weird, and there is no one to like until Titus grows up. The kitchen boy seems like a nice person at first,as we follow his adventures through the castle, but then he becomes a bitter, ruthless murderer. The young daughter, Lady Fushia, is a spoilt, selfish shallow girl. And everyone else is worse. Even the nursemaid, an outcast from her own people, is kind to the baby Titus, but tries to subvert him to take care of her own daughter. The characters are all very weird.
When Titus grows up, he becomes a good man, someone I can finally like in the very long TV series. But then he starts making out with his foster sister. Ew, gross. In Canada, at least, foster-, step-, adopted- and related-by-marriage-sisters are treated the same as blood sisters when it comes to marital law, so the fact that he can want to kiss his foster sister is supremely icky to me. But then, I get grossed out by blood cousins getting married in Jane Austen's novels, so maybe it's just me.
I liked the ending, the scenery (even if bewildering), and I'm really glad I watched the TV series instead of trying to read the novel as some of the characters are really weird and annoying.
I'm rating this 4 stars because if the books have such weird scenery, characters and atmosphere, the BBC did a fantastic job bringing it to the small screen.",1085011200,3,2289,4.739348370927318

Just goes to show that if you want to get really out there with anything you have to go to England (the only exemption in many years being Lord of the Rings). Hollywood feels too much of a need to explain things.

1345854,5,B00004S322,"I feel a little guilty for watching ""Gormenghast."" I own a copy of Mervyn Peake's epic tale but have yet to read it. The length of the novel is part of the problem; at well over 1000 pages, one does not assume the responsibility of this tome lightly. It would take me roughly a week to read it if ""War and Peace"" is any indication (I read that novel in about eight days). I want to read the novel at some point, but I will delight myself with the memories of this colorful adaptation from the nice folks at the BBC in the interim. English television dramas, at least the few I have seen, tend to be much better than American efforts. Apparently, British audiences want their multipart productions to have canyon deep character development and expansive storylines not easily resolved within a few hours. I couldn't agree more, as I hate most of what I see on American television (with a few exceptions). Anyway, since I did not read the book before diving into this program, I came into the whole thing with little expectation of what I would see. I should not have worried. ""Gormenghast"" is an amazing imaginative flight, full of lush scenery, hilarious and intriguing characters, and complex plot lines. This production clocks in at four plus hours.
Where to start? Well, Gormenghast is a sprawling city/state presided over by the Groan dynasty. The royal house of Gormenghast is an ancient, decaying line stretching back into the dim recesses of time. The city and its monarchy are so old that no one remembers what any of the rituals of rule mean anymore. The current occupant of the throne is the doddering Lord Groan, a leader weary of the endless drudgery associated with his duties. Every minute of every day requires a host of arcane rites that saps his soul. But the birth of a new heir named Titus means that the lineage will continue through the veins of a new leader. All residents of Gormenghast must prepare for the eventual transfer of power; an amusing thing indeed considering the ascension of a new Groan will mean little overall change. Even as the new heir begins the long process of grooming, an ominous threat arises within the byzantine Gormenghast, a threat that, if unchecked, could well topple the Groans forever.
This threat to the very essence of Gormenghast is the wily Steerpike, a lowly soul who begins his climb to power as a lackey in the vast kitchens of the city. Through a combination of fawning subservience and ruthless calculation, Steerpike manages to move out of the kitchens into a series of increasingly important posts. As Titus Groan grows into a man Steerpike gets closer and closer to what he perceives is his true destiny: the destruction of the Groan dynasty and the installation of himself as ruler of the city. And not a soul will stand in his way, not the elder Lord Groan, not the conniving sisters Clarice and Cora Groan, and certainly not the man who keeps track of all of Gormenghast's various rituals. It is to this post that Steerpike eventually rises, a position only a few inches away from the seat of real power. Inevitably, a showdown between Titus Groan and Steerpike will decide the very fate of this ancient city as well as pave the way for Titus Groan to make his own decisions about what he wishes to do regarding his onerous heritage.
""Gormenghast"" is stunning in every sense of the word. The set pieces, the costumes, the performances, the expansive plot, and the humor all contribute mightily to this majestic piece of entertainment. I don't know what I was expecting when I popped this DVD into my player, but it definitely wasn't the images that flowed across the screen. I had always heard Peake's novel delves into some very bleak and dark places. I also heard that the book emphasizes the idea of a monarchy in decline, thereby drawing--perhaps appropriately--parallels to the English royal family. ""Gormenghast"" the film is not moody and dark but rather a brightly lit, almost garish collection of odd buildings and just as odd characters. Moreover, the movie stresses class struggle between the thousands of employees toiling away in the city and the strange family that rules them, with Steerpike often speaking in language reminiscent of a Marxist rabble-rouser.
The best element of the movie isn't the issue of class or the lurid scenery; it is the warped characters and the actors who breathe life into them. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers turns the scheming Steerpike into one of cinema's great villains. You learn to loathe his character and cannot wait to see him get his comeuppance. Celia Imrie and Ian Richardson do wonderful turns as Lord and Lady Groan, Neve McIntosh marvels as the lovelorn Lady Fuschia, and Christopher Lee turns up in the crucial role of Flay, one of the household servants who sees Steerpike for what he is but can initially do little to stop him. My personal favorites, however, were John Sessions as the hilarious Dr. Prunesquallor, Fiona Shaw as his excitable wife Irma, and Stephen Fry as the absentminded Professor Bellgrove. I might as well just paste the entire cast list here, write ""excellent"" beside it, and leave it at that. Everyone here is that good. How does the BBC manage to put together such amazing casts? I may feel guilty about not reading the novel before watching the movie, but I think I will get over that sensation quite nicely!",1074470400,16,5354,4.770474137931035
1345855,4,B00004S322,"Gormenghast (Andy Wilson, 2000)
It is likely that the first thing anyone notices about this gorgeous, sprawling BBC miniseries is the incredible cast, perhaps the most high-powered to be found since The Thorn Birds some twenty years ago. Headed by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (b. Monkey, Titus) as Steerpike and the venerable Christoper Lee (The Lord of the Rings, the most recent series of Star Wars movies, and well over an hundred others)who are also teaming up next Christmas for an adaptation of Peter S. Beagles The Last Unicornthe cast also includes such grand lights as Celia Imrie (Bridget Jones Diary, Star Wars Ep I), Ian Richardson (Strange, Dark City), Richard Griffiths (Sleepy Hollow, the Harry Potter films), John Sessions (Gangs of New York), Zoe Wanamaker (Adrian Mole), Lynsey Baxter (Psychos), Stephen Fry (every movie made since 1994), and many, many more. Starpower would be something of an understatement.
Everyone else is likely to be captivated by the stunning cinematography. It comes out not only in the wide, sweeping panoramas (the scene with Rhys-Meyers straddling the west wing roof and looking out over Gormenghast is justifiably famous), but also in the small details (how the colors of everything, from clothes to rocks to people) is just off enough to keep an undercurrent of disturbance running throughout the four hours of the miniseries.
The plot, what there is of it, is simply summed up: Gormenghast has stood for seventy-six generations, with the current Lord Groan (Richardson) at its head for a good number of years already. The story opens with the simultaneous birth of Lord Groan and Lady Gertrude (Imrie)s son Titus, the seventy-seventh Earl of Groan, and the seeming revolt of Steerpike (Rhys-Meyers), who, in a fit of pique, escapes from the kitchens and manipulates his way into the lives of the Groans. The basic plot has to do with whether Steerpikes masterful manipulations can bring not only the Groans, but their whole earldom, to their knees. It is the underlying twists and turns, and the savagery of the satire on British upperclass life in the first part of the twentieth century, however, that makes this such a truly superb piece of work. Think of it as Upstairs, Downstairs on a very bad acid trip.
Where the miniseries fails is only where the source material fails, in most cases, and one cant count points off for that. However, trying to cram the whole thousand-plus pages of Gormenghast into four hours led to a few too many cuts; it would have been nice to see a six- or eight-hour production, which would have put it at just about the same length as the theatrical release of The Lord of the Rings and would have left in more of the subtleties of the text. As it stands, it seems at the opening of episode four that one of the major plotlines was just abandoned, with the resolution of it thrown in a bit farther down the pike to tie up the loose ends; the major scene dealing with the fate of Lord Groan is so ambiguous that only those with the DVD or who have the first novel fresh in their minds are likely to figure out what it really means; things like that. Perhaps little, but still telling.
For what it is, though, Gormenghast is a rich and wonderful tale, certainly one that should be sought out by those who feel the Lord of the Rings is the pinnacle of British twentieth-century fantastic literature; Peakes work is on a par with Tolkeins, and Andy Wilsons wonderful production does it at least as much justice as Peter Jackson does Tolkein (on a fraction of the budget, no less). ****",1052092800,5,3557,4.785365853658536
1345856,4,B00004S322,"Gormenghast was a set of videos I checked out of the library on a whim.  It turned out to be an exellent choice - Gormenghast is a rich, imaginative and passionately acted movie and well worth the investment of 4 hours to absorb.
Although I never read the books, I am now determined to.  The movie was excellent, the casting superb and the costumes rich in a ""Romeo and Juliette"", Franco Zeffirelli fashion.  I think some American movie goers might laugh at some of the blue-screen outdoor shots, which is the only technical point on which I could find any fault, but the backdrops were beautiful and the props detailed.
The acting is what really makes this movie superb, however.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as Steerpike was Clockwork Orange superb.  He brought a brilliant, angry, slightly psychotic presence to the movie that would have made it fasinating without a supporting cast.  Combine his performance with a host of comic and dramatic big name actors, not the least of which are Christopher Lee, John Sessions, Ian Richardson, Eric Sykes and at least 12 others, and you have a film rich in pure talent and passionate execution in every area - a rarely acheived feat.
There are many excellent web sites and web rings devoted to the author, Mervyn Peake, with information about him, his work, and excerpts of the book that are worth checking out in relationship with this movie.  Although much of the story was left out in the film, so the book readers say, they seem as happy with it as I was.
Gormenghast gives you a sometimes comical, sometimes groteque, look at the aristrocracy, and at the hearts and motivations of just about every kind of person.  It's easy to sink into, the actor's being so over the top in their performances, and when the yanks come at your own feelings, you fall into them with a willingness to explore.  An excellent film, worthy of a laugh and a cheer - and consideration of the different faces you may wear and wish to celebrate or change.",1047427200,6,1972,4.676300578034682
1345857,4,B00004S322,"This is an ambitious BBC production of one of my favorite ""fantasy"" trilogies, Mervin Peake's Gormenghast. I thoroughly enjoyed this imaginative realization which employs a virtual who's who of british actors.  This film is so well cast that in some cases it's difficult to think of anyone who could've played the part so well. This is particularaly true of Ian Richardson's portrayal of the 76th Earl of Groan. He looks the part, pale and bird-like. When he descends into madness, it is as dreadful and grotesque to witness as it was in the books . Jonathan Rhys Meyers pulls out all the stops as the books villain, Steerpike. At first I thought him too good looking for the part, but he's a talented enough actor that the gaunt ugliness of the torured soul within transformed his outward appearance into that sociopathic creature we love to hate. Fiona Shaw was dead on perfect as the man crazed Irma Prunsqallor, providing some of the more humorous moments in this dark tale and although he played down his manic character (I forget the actor's name,), I liked the performance of Dr Prune as well. Stephen Fry seemed too young and good looking to be Bellgrove, but he 's such a delight, i soon forgot about my pre conceptions. The countess was spot on. So was Swelter. And special mention must be made of Christopher Lee's Flay.  Just as in with Tolkien material, it is obvious here that he has a great love and understanding of the books and his character, and is a pleasure to watch. Lee is really enjoying a great period late in his career.

Preconceptions are always a problem with adaptations of beloved books. This one even has Peakes drawings to be compared to. The look of Gormenghast here is too airy and pretty. Looks more Potter than Peake. Where were the craggy turrets, the dark endless maze of crumbling parapets and towers? That was a disappointment. However, some of the sets were  appropriately lavishly decaying, the library being one of the best.

This film can be read as allegory,  a story of  adolescent  growing pains and rebellion against timeworn ritual and all that restricts freedom and blossoming of the individual,  Steerpike's rise a symbol of proletariat rage against the reigning aristocracy.

It is all these things and more: like all good fantasy, it takes us into another reality, one with its own rules and laws, not of any time or place we know, yet strangely familiar, a slightly skewed and twisted parallel world worth visiting again and again.

Still, one hopes that one day Peake's unique vision will be given the big screen
royal treatment it truly deserves. But don't hold your breath; I doubt the eccentric world of Gormenghast will ever be deemed commercially viable enough to warrant a big budget production. But with a cast as fine as this, we really don't have too much to complain about",1043798400,16,2838,4.759674134419552
1345858,5,B00004S322,"Gormenghast was a trilogy of fantasy novels written by an Englishman shortly after WWII. It is a work of fiction often overlooked and neglected, not as popular or heard of as Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings or for that matter, C. S. Lewis' Chronicles Of Narnia. But if you take a good look at the film version, (originally presented on BBC television in England, later aired on PBS) you can equate the terrific novels as the equal of the great fantasy classics. Like Tolkien and Lewis, these novels take the reader on a journey that is larger than life, a plot reveals multidimensional characters and the mood of the novel is many layred. It is anachronistic, comic, dark and lavish, nearly Shakespearean, with a dominant allegorical style.
Gormenghast is an allegory for England, more than likely the England that the author was familiar with and the monarchy of its past. Tolkien and Lewis were also English and made it clear that certain locations, if not the entire fantasy world they wrote about, was England (i.e. in Lord of the Rings, Hobbitown is England Hobbits are English folk). There are many striking elements about Gormenghast and I will try to outline them without giving too much away. The largest character is that of Steerpike, an orphan boy who was raised as a kitchen boy in the royal household. Steerpike's bitterness becomes deep hatred and ambition to raise above those he considered his opressors. He begins to forge a plan to destroy the royal family. Assuming a powerful court position, Steerpike moves forward on his revenge, in a nearly Shakespearean determination for vengeance (we may recall Hamlet in this aspect. Note: Gormenghast has many Shakesperean elements. Steerpikes uses two inseperable twins, both girls, who want to acquire powerful court influence...The King is a bookphile, a once wise, efficient ruler but who in his old age becomes slow-witted and finally, insane....The King's daughter, Fushia, is evidently a parody of Ophelia from Hamlet, a lonely, imaginative, poetic soul, a young woman with naivete and a deep love for Steerpike...The unassuming, humble, adventuresome Prince Titus...Titus has no desire to continue the legacy of his father and rule as king...
An allegory of a monarch system ? Most likely. Perhaps the author was pointing out its flaws, its nuances, and he does so in a fantastic tapestry of locations and characters. There are times when the film borders on Gothic romanticism. This DVD is worth the price and it is clearly a remarkable collection for those who love fantasy film. In my personal opinion, and I say this with conviction, Gormenghast takes its place and makes its creed with Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles Of Narnia.",1041724800,5,2704,4.984513274336283
1345859,4,B00004S322,"The first thing any viewer is going to struggle with through this series is its length. At four hours, it can only afford to touch down briefly on many key points in the novel and as such it is hard to linger on keen political insights or laugh at little in-jokes before being swept along with the main storyline.
Overall, however, the adaption was excellent. Gormenghast is here represented in a brighter, more bustling, and definately more colourful way than Peake's haunted, crumbling castle of the books; yet it works, for we travel from rooms that are well-lit and populous, with lights and taps and carpets, to hallways shrouded in dust and decay. It certainly helps set Gormenghast as a place rather outside space and time.
The characters here are brilliantly portrayed for the most part; although they are not all exactly as I had invisioned them, the actors easily bring to vivid life the strange, quirky persons of Peake's tale, particularily Lady Groan, Flay, and the Prunesquallers. Fiona Shaw is to be commended for undertaking such an undesireable and ignorant character as Irma Prunesquallor and turning in a performance so spot-on and comically brilliant that it alone is almost worth the price of the DVDs.
There are some weird hitches in the film which make the story rather confusing- for instance, the role of the Wild Girl; but she springs from Peake's eccentric pen and is no fault of the film maker's. Flay and Swelter's rivalry is not plumbed deeply enough for a viewer ignorant of Peake's work to understand the nature of their hatred. Perhaps most crucially, Steerpike's character and his relationship with Fuchsia is altered rather dramatically.
Instead of being a demonically clever villain in the style of Shakespeare's Richard the Third, the hunchbacked, insidious Steerpike of the novels becomes the film's passionate, flagrant, innovative anti-hero, excellently potrayed by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who cannot help that the character was so adapted.
The books force us to admire Steerpike, even as we detest him. We admire his wit, his brain, his smooth calculation and his impeccable attention to detail and control. In spite of his ugliness and our total lack of empathy for his actions, he is a fascinating character.
Rhys Meyer's Steerpike is almost sympathetic at times; his is more brilliant innovation than cold calculation, and we are given more of a look into his tragic upbringing, again tugging on the heartstrings of the viewer. (Maybe it's just because he is so darn goodlooking!) Although his actions are just as deplorable, we see the emotion behind them. He is also not scarred as hideously by the fire than in the book; he is still, at least in profile, the handesome Rhys Meyers, and Fuchsia's reaction to his ugliness seems odd considering she did not mind it in the book. The movie does not suffer for it; but book-lovers will note the change and some may not enjoy it.
Steerpike's relationship with Fuchsia is also a bit altered; their meetings are switched around and a growing love between them is emphasized more strongly here than in the books; Rhys Meyer's Steerpike seems to actually love Fuchsia, while the Steerpike of the book has no intentions beyond seducing and controlling her. This adds to the touching tragedy of Fuchsia's scenes, and again, the movie doesn't suffer.
All in all, the adaption is well done, if a bit confusing for non-readers. I would have liked it to be longer. I would have been interested in seeing what they might have done with a more true-to-form villainous Steerpike. Some scenes are uncomfortable to watch, as the actors are so clearly over-exagerating their emoitons; but the speeches of Mervyn Peake's books are actually quite absurd when read aloud, and the actors do their best to portray larger-than-life characters. By choosing not to do the third book in the series, Titus Alone, the film wisely sticks to the characters that were wildly popular amonsgt Peake's readers and does not venture out into the strange and wholly different world of Titus' life in later years. If a non-reader would be confused by the Gormenghast peoples, a film version of the third book would be simply impossible to believe.",1031702400,,4199,4.965909090909091

This movie did everything right.  The sets were wonderful, and all the actors were perfect for their parts.  What really struck me though was the wit of the script--even though it was a tragedy, I thought the dialogue was both ironic and hilarious.
I haven't read the Gormenghast trilogy (though this movie prompted me to buy the audio books), so I don't know how it compares to the books, but I thought the movie was deep as well as entertaining (lots of commentary on class struggle and too many Hamlet references to be coincidence).

1345862,4,B00004S322,"as a devoted fan of the novels i'm having a bit of a problem to give it 5 stars.  It's not that it's  a bad or  a careless adaptation of the book, and in most parts it sticks with the narrative of the books, but i felt that there has been some changes and maybe even some injustice with some of the characters. Those characters , such as Flay, Fuchsia, Irma, and professor Bellgrove, that demands long time to get used to their strange ways, to  fully understad and love them, suffer a great deal from the harsh editing the scriptwriters did to this vast detailed books in order to fit them into a 4 episode mini series.
However, that injustice is somewhat repaired by the wonderfull casting and espeacily the actress who portrays Fuchsia ( the most loved Gormenghast figeure ) Neve Macintosh.
To every peake's fan who'se maybe reluctent to watch  the movie in fear it might spoil the book for him i say go for it if only for the sake of watching her performance. Whenever i think of Fuchsia - it's her i see.
There'se also a delightfull apppearrance ( as always ) by stephen fry as professor Bellgrove and of course- develishly handsome Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the devious Steerpike.
 I think the meddling with steerpike's character and the attempt to make him seem more human and volnurable is in bitter contradiction with his description in the books but never the less, he gives a great performance.
To conclude - i think the sworn fans of the books will find this
series to be enjoyable since the  design of the production is very beautifull and imaganetive, and i think it does justice with peake's vision of the world of Gormenghast.
Those who have not read the books, i think will love it even more because it is a good movie and it has many moment of suspense and horror and loughter, and as i said before, the best actors England could offer and a spectacular production.
To those who will watch and like it  i can only recommend also reading the books, wich are immensely better.",1018137600,4,1990,4.4930747922437675
1345863,4,B00004S322,"Mervyn Peake's Dickensian fantasy of courtly mayhem gets the royal BBC treatment in a production that sometimes enchants, sometime frustrates, but always holds your interest.  The film chronicles the wicked career of the kitchen boy, Steerpike and his attempts to gain the earldom of Gormenghast for his own.  In direct contrast, is the young Earl of Groan, Titus, who would rather be free from his blood obligation to rule his lands.  Added to this are characters that would be at home in Alice's Wonderland or Charles Dickens' London.  They range from the daffy twin sisters of the previous earl, the flighty sister of Titus, a senile nanny, a cavernous and loyal servant, to a crabby dwarf with an obsession with ritual.  Richly mounted, the production is a treat for the ear and eye with such British film vets such as Fiona Shaw, Chistopher Lee, Zoe Wannamaker and Neve McIntosh providing wonderful moments.
However, this is not a perfect show by any means.  The screenplay tends to gloss over much of the deeper characterizations, and many of the characters are not all that sympathetic....or even likable.  Even the hero, Titus, comes across as a bit of pill.  Only Christopher Lee's loyal Flay and John Session's quirky Dr. Prunesqualler succeed in capturing our empathy.  Also, for a film which covers about 17 years, only a couple of characters seem to age!!!!  While Titus, Flay and the twins show the wear and tear of time, the rest of the characters seem stuck in a time-warp.
However, despite its obvious flaws,  this production does succeed in capturing our attention with its rich detail, intricate plot and rather broad characters.  If you like something very unique, GORMENGHAST is a series that I would definitely recommend.",1016582400,5,1743,4.972413793103448

Una novela como Gormenghast no es una novela facil, sin embargo, la sensacion que tanto ha maravillado a sus lectores ha sido fielmente (casi fielmente, mejor dicho) atrapada por esta miniserie, sorprendente, hermosa y totalmente alejada de los canones del cine comercial fantastico. Gormenhast muestra un mundo fantastico coeherente y creible dentro de su marco: un gigantesco castillo, hogar y prision de la famila noble Groan, un verdadero laberinto de calles de piedra, un mundo sorprendente de tejados interminables y cielos multicolor donde la critica social hacia la sociedad inglesa llega a transformarse en un drama tremendo sobre la naturaleza humana, el amor, el desamor y la busqueda de la libertad mas alla de nosotros mismos, de nuestras fronteras.
Gormenhast es un gigantesco castillo, hogar de la noble familia Rohan. Su heredero, Titus, ha nacido y tiene por delante el destino seguro de convertirse en el nuevo amo de Gormenhast. Pero un extranio chico, escapado de las profundas cavernas del castillo, inteligente y carismatico, transformado por una infancia de carencias en un ser lleno de sombras, triztezas y locura, comienza a infiltrarse en la familia de Titus, sembrando el odio y la discordia, convertiendose en el nemesis numero uno del heredero y en un hombre de influencia y poder en la corte. Sera este pues el verdugo de Titus o la salvacion del alma de este futuro heredero.
Gormenghast es algo que nunca has visto. Lo que gastes en esta pelicula lo recuperaras con creces, porque no solo te llevaras una pelicula excelente. Te llevaras una obra de arte, una miniserie de cuatro horas destinada a convertirse en un una pelicula de culto.
Si hablas espaniol, la pelicula no tiene subtitulos en ingles ni en espaniol, pero cuenta con Close Caption (los subtitulos para la gente sorda en ingles). Si no eres muy bueno para el ingles, te advierto de una vez que no es una pelicula facil de entender, de leer tampoco...aun asi sigue valiendo la pena",1011830400,3,2251,4.926315789473684

The tendency of directors to ""adapt"" the story line for the on screen version can often leave a bad taste in people's mouths.  Luckily, Andy Wilson did a fantastic job staying true to the text.  With no real story line changes and only a handful of noticeable omissions for the sake of time--remember it often takes Peake 50 pages to describe a 2 minute sequence--I think Peake would have been pleased.
The cast did an excellent job and I was thrilled by the performance of the actors.  Steerpike, the Countess and Prunesqualler all shine in their depiction of the characters.  The immensity of Gormenghast is wonderfully portrayed through the use of special effects.

1345874,5,B00004S322,"I have no novels to compare this film series to and am glad of it.  This is a tour de force of UK acting talent.  A Who's Who of casting takes over every role in this mythical tale of the kingdom of Gormenghast.  It is ruled over by an elderly earl, who has just had a young son born to inherit the crown.  However, he is plotted against by a young man who works in the kitchen, called Steerpike, who keeps steadily advancing himself by undermining one and all.  Steerpike is brilliantly played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.  He is the villain of the piece but in a strange way, also its hero, as you follow no one as intensely as you follow him and his attempt to break out of the rigid class system of Gormenghast (obviously patterned on the UK's own aristocracy). Everyone in the cast is similarly wonderful. Ian Richardson plays the elderly ruler, who is driven mad by Steerpike's destroying his library.  Richardson's portrayal of an owl, what he thinks he is, nails an owl dead-on. Stephen Fry and Fiona Shaw as the romancing couple of Headmaster and Spinster almost steal the show with their high comic portrayls.  This will take you at least two nights to view and you will enjoy it thoroughly as hubby and I both did.

Everything was overdone (in a good way), and each character represented something bigger in the world (i.e. communist, romantic, intillectual, etc.) The story was awesome, and the characters were hilarious, in a dark sort of way.

1345878,4,B00004S322,"... I first read them when I was a moody teenager myself and they carried an impact I still feel 30 years later. There are very few books that have an impact that lasts a lifetime. It is a shame the video could not capture the languid atmosphere of the books but I suppose it can't be helped given the limitations of video. I was concerned that the presentation would contradict my own visualization of the characters, but to the contrary the presentation was dead-on. Rather than contradict the books, watching the video was more like seeing the same story but from a different perspective, focusing more on the characters and less on the environment.
My main criticism is that the screenwriter (or director or producer, whoever controlled the script) didn't really understand one of the main messages of the books. This comes through in the mishandling of the key character of the Master of Ritual, called the Secretary in the video. Changing the title was a mistake. And so was the change in the character. In the books the first Master of Ritual is old, quiet Sourdust, who helps set the eliagic mood before Steerpike starts to interfere. Steerpike then kills him (accidentally) in the library fire (this is why Steerpike in his later delirium says the sisters make 5 -- Sourdust, Nanny Slagg, Cora, Clarice, Barquentine. Steerpike did not know what happened to Sepulchrave or Swelter, only Flay knew). Steerpike's fire brings nasty, cussing Barquentine into the book, and that is what first causes the mood to change. But in the video, it is nasty Barquentine from the start (although because he isn't named until much later, you think at first it is supposed to be Sourdust). Sourdust is simply deleted. The result is that in the video you always have the nasty element, and Steerpike has no responsibility for it. I should have thought the screenwriter would be more careful about cutting Steerpike's first murder. The author, Peake, knew what he was doing by starting with Sourdust and having Steerpike kill him.
The title of Master of Ritual is important for another reason. It is such an important point: in that castle, Ritual is master, so the Master of Ritual is the true master of the castle. Steerpike wanted to be Master of Ritual because he knew that in that role he could control the law; it was where the real power was. As Master of Ritual he could surreptitiously change the rituals, because no one else could understand their intricacies, and set everyone dancing to his commands. The Groans were puppets of the Master of Ritual. In the books ritual is all-powerful. Recall that in the video Barquentine complained that Sepulchrave's breakfast was not part of the ritual. The meeting in the library came about only because of the breakfast, wherein Sepulchrave defied the control of ritual, to plan an act (the breakfast) intended to show his love for his son. Yet that led to the burning and Sepulchrave's madness and death. Sepulchrave's penalty for defying ritual was terrible. Steerpike wanted to marry Fushia and thus combine in himself both the control of the ritual, and be the central player in the ritual. But the dedication of the loyal servant of ritual, Barquentine (who burned Steerpike and made him mad) and the loyal servant of nobility, Flay (who relentlessly tracked him) along with the goodhearted, intelligent Prunesquallor and the heir, Titus, defeated him, preserved the ruling family, and thus preserved the ritual. Then Titus, having preserved the ritual, flees it, because he knows it is too powerful to defeat. I think a more understanding screenwriter would have developed these themes more clearly and still had a compelling drama.
Lastly, I was disappointed in the flooding sequence and the hunt for Steerpike, which was very compressed in time and visual scope; this should have been developed with sweep and steadily-building tension. I would have preferred they cut or compress the Bellgrove/professor sequences entirely to devote the time to a really powerful climactic flood/hunt sequence.",997401600,3,4044,4.974889217134416

Wilson's directing, throughout, must have consisted of ""Fine, next scene, please,"" because everyone is chewing scenery, even those quite capable of nuanced, moving performances, such as Ian Richardson, June Brown, and Zoe Wanamaker.

The Horrible things in this movie:
Steerpike's mask-what in the world were they thinking of, Phantom of the Opera? Ugh.
Steerpike's fake burn scars-Looked like they stuck cheap clay all over his face...not really all that, ""White and Scarlett"", was it?
Fuchsia-Neve McIntosh, the actress who played Fuchsia, was abominable. What the script done to Fuchsia was abominable. It took a wonderful,complex,artistic,loving,and fascinating character and made her into a spoiled,hysterical,slightly ditzy brat. And oh my god, Neve McIntosh is one of the worst actresses I have seen in years...
The Castle-Mervyn Peake describes the castle as being old and crumbling and gigantic. A large gothic castle. In the series it looks more like a small town, very pastel and pretty and small.
Useless and sometimes just plain horrible things they added in-The ""why don't you take that mask off!"" bedroom scene between Fuchsia and steerpike, and the scene near the end where Steerpike comes to Fuchsia for help when hes a fugitive, both scenes which make Fuchsia look bad.
Trying to make Steerpike more sympathetic and trying to turn him into a Hamlet like character.
Fuchsia's suicide-Gee, I guess next time I dive into the swimming pool I'll die on contact like Fuchsia did? Not only did they do a horrible thing in changing the manner of Fuchsia's death, but they also had to do it in a completely unrealistic and ridiculous way.
Turning an imaginative,dark,beautiful story into a light sometimes silly comedy.
Some very bad overacting(not going to name names here...besides Neve, and she was so terrible I just HAD to mention her)
The scene in the first episdoe with Steerpike clowning around for Fuchsia in her attic-This scene is so horrible and embarrassing I just had to mention it. JRM(who is usually an excellent actor)is very cringe worthy in this scene, and of course Neve is her usual talentless self. Its a very very very bad scene *shudders*
Now onto the good things about this movie:
Stephen Fry was in it and made a wonderful Bellgrove.
Jonathan Rhys Meyers-This is a purely shallow good thing. JRM is one of the most bloody gorgeous actors in the world. I would have *liked* to have seen Steerpike played by someone who resembled the Steerpike in the books but JRM is so goodlooking that I just can't bring myself to complain. His talented acting,good looks, and charisma is one of the best things about this movie and what keeps me watching it.
Celia Imrie, Fiona Shaw, Zoe Wannamaker, Lynsey Baxter-All fantastic and do really good jobs with their roles. Irma getting ready for her party always makes me chuckle.
The script has a nice light, surreal imaginative,fairytale feel to it. So if you are a great lover of the books and are expecting a good adaption, you're not going to find it here. But if you just feel like watching an original well done movie, well, here it is.",996537600,7,3168,4.890334572490707
1345884,1,B00004S322,"For the [price] you pay for the DVD you could buy (at least) the first two, and most satisfying, books of the trilogy in hardback and own one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. As small screen entertainment, Ghormenghast fails to capture any of the scale and drama of the Peake masterpiece and you'll watch it once (if that) and wish you hadn't.
This really is dross...",995587200,9,383,4.565217391304348
1345885,5,B00004S322,"....recently awakened from a dream."" Those are lyrics from the Broadway musical ""Titanic"", but they ring true for this innovative piece of storytelling. Thanks to great special effects, costuming, sets, and CGI it's baffling at times, awash in sounds, imagery, and a general existance of characters and objects that won't make sense if you don't completely give yourself up to the fact that this is another world and this is a modern fairy tale. The story is perfectly sane, and is just told in a very weird and colorful blend.
I found this to be a bit extreme, but thouroughly entertaining. The story was a bit hard to follow once in a while, and I found it dragged now and then. I've never read the books so I don't know how close it stayed to the actual storyline. Neverthless, it got it's point across and I loved it.
Great movie, PBS has truly outdone itself yet again.",995414400,2,874,4.573248407643312
1345886,4,B00004S322,"I watched this straight through without interruption. The very beginning, the introduction to the characters (with one exception) was tedious and fussy-funny in a slightly irritating way. Once the tale begins to unfold, I was hooked. The one exception is Steerpike's entry into the film: Jonathan Rhys-Myers takes over from his first appearance. The physicality and feline qualities he brings to his portrayal make his naturally  elegant, distilled evil seductive and intelligently existential. Yet one never misses the rage underneath the grace. Quite a performance. The movie (really mini-series) is really about such things as honor, loyalty, self-knowledge and responsibility, ossification of institutions, renewal, all comprehensible in contemporary ways, thus quite relevant. Yet it revolves around the bad guy for whom we almost cheer. There is also a self-defeating love story which adds poignancy to the film's resolution. The settings and costumes are not fixed in time......anachronisms abound......but they are arresting, sumptuous, and contribute to the timelessness of the themes the story addresses.  Some backdrops are obvious and make you wish they had done something with a computer.... the final ride into the sun is a bit cheesy. Put up with the slow start and some isolated instances of the not-very-funny-broad-English-humor (to me in America anyway). This film is worth it. I know I will watch it again. I've never read the novel.",995068800,2,1453,5.511210762331839

7921691,5,B00004S322,"Splendidly grotesque & visually sumptuous, this BBC version of Mervyn Peake's brilliant but dense trilogy is not quite the masterpiece it might have been, but is nevertheless a fascinating surreal fantasy epic that serves as an excellent introduction to the books.

Great cast, wonderful production values, eye-poppong sets & costumes & even beautifully-rendered CGI effects (and I normally dislike CGI). The script is exceptional, considering that it has to condense the three big books of the trilogy. The story is the very dark but also very droll chronicle of the rise of the malevolent & treacherous Steerpike, from a lowly urchin to the dizzying heights of Gormenghast, the great fantasy city-state of the trilogy. The series is brilliantly directed, rendering Peake's lurid imagery into some truly unforgettable scenes.

The acting is of course first-rate, especially from Ian Richardson, who brings real depth & heart to what might have been just a clever fantasy, and also Christopher Lee, who makes the absolute most of his inscrutable & inarticulate character, Flay. Rhys-Meyers & Zo Wanamaker also shine. Plus a host of richly-drawn character actors who populate the strange, dreamlike landscape of Gormenghast.

Only problem here is that the production feels a bit pared-down for the screen. Four hours are barely adequate to portray this vast, darkly absurd allegory of ruthless ambition, deceit, betrayal & madness. As a result, the strange, often bizarre saga can seem a tad obscure to those unfamiliar with the books & may feel slightly disconcerting at times for people unused to such outr fare,

But despite its minor imperfections, Gormenghast is infused with wry British wit that more than makes up for them.",1505001600,,1729,5.276363636363636

7921693,5,B00004S322,A campy version with some excellent wit and amazing castb of actors that just ham it up. Some didn't appreciate the humor but I felt it was done well.  You can't please everyone I guess.,1489881600,,186,4.314285714285714
7921694,4,B00004S322,"Not sure why I'm not getting the Verified Purchase tag on this but I purchased this DVD on January 15, 2002, from Amazon for a price of $29.99, FYI.

I saw this film when it aired on PBS in 2001 (I think) and thought it was bizarre but interesting. The production values of the film were outrageously beautiful, with a steampunk quality  I remember the clock with Steerpike image mostly. Costumes, makeup, voices, etc.  all of it  over the top and excessive. But it was an artistic masterpiece in the visual sense.

The film is so much better than the books, which dragged on and on and were sometimes frustrating and boring as heck. I think the film only covers the first two books but I'm not the authority on that as I couldn't finish the books they were THAT bad. I have to give a lot of credit to the director, writers and creative team for making this into something unique considering the slop the book is.

Anyway, the film is weird and bizarre but it's one of those things that once you start watching, you can't turn away from.  I guess you could call this fantasy. You could maybe call it gothic (maybe). But it is definitely unforgettable.

The main character, Steerpike, is a servant for the Groan family - a dynasty of sorts.  It is his doings that become the undoing of the Groan family. Played by the very pretty Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Steerpike causes upheaval in his attempt to rise in station and gain a position of power through unscrupulous plotting and deception. It's worth a viewing if you are interested in Rhys Meyers or in the novels.

I would definitely see the film as opposed to reading the novel. Take it from someone who knows.",1476403200,,1658,4.496666666666667
7921695,4,B00004S322,"My only complaint is

My only concern is I had imagined Gormengast to be grander with more areas displaying different times and building styles. All of the inhabitants of Gormenghast seem to be real perhaps based on folk the author knew well.
I thought Jonathan Rys Meyers was much too pretty to be the lead character.........However he as usual delivers a performance making him appear to be the person the author invented the character for. Mr. Meyers takes you on an intense whirlwind of emotions that is horrifying as well as sympathetic who has so much depth and longing..........",1470355200,3,585,4.909090909090909
