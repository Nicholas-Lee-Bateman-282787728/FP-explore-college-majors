8028481,2,B0002KQNKO,"It Lives Again (Larry Cohen, 1978)

It certainly shouldn't have, but it did, in fact, live again, four years after the original film. A lot of people with otherwise impressive resumes must have all needed money at the same time, for they got together and made this el-cheapo slasher sequel to the cult hit. Same basic idea, slasher baby, except that now there are three of them. (Remember the final line in the original movie?) Trite, predictable, and as silly as anything that ever came out of the Herschell Gordon Lewis factory; only worth seeing for completist purposes. *

It's Alive III: Island of the Alive (Larry Cohen, 1987)

While the second It's Alive movie is basically worthless exploitation of the cult status of the first one, Island of the Alive is actually kinda-sorta worth watching. Much of this has to do with Michael Moriarty, who was, at the time, one of those great B-list actors who no one paid anywhere near enough attention to, despite having been so good in Pale Rider a couple of years previous. (Cohen and Moriarty were actually making two different films for the studio simultaneously--Island of the Alive and A Return to 'Salem's Lot, both of which are cheese-fests of the highest order.) Moriarty, not surprisingly, plays the father here, and his character follows the exact same formula as the fathers form the first two films. He gets Karen Black as a wife, though, so it's not all wet nappies and blood.

In this installment, the government has sent all the murderous cannibal babies to a deserted island, which is now considered a fabulous vacation spot for highly illegal hunting expeditions. As well, the existence of the kids has caused a media exploitation frenzy, and so an activist, with a team of scientists and a concerned pair of parents (Moriarty and Black), set off for the island with differing ulterior agendas.

Yeah, it's low-budget schlock exploitation horror, but that sort of thing can work marvelously if you've got pieces of the whole that rise above the norm; all you have to do for evidence of this is look at the first movie in the franchise. In this case, the piece that rises above is the acting. Moriarty and Black head up a stable of talent that is not inconsiderable, including the final screen appearance of great character actor Macdonald Carey, as well as a number of other character actors you'll probably recognize, as long as you're old enough. Cohen wisely kept to formula on this one while still varying things enough to make it interesting (one of the main failings of the second movie), and throws in the kind of plot twist that just makes you wonder what everyone involved with the film in its conceptual stages was smoking. It's dumb, but it's a lot of fun, as well. ** ",1248739200,,2752,4.732776617954071

8028483,4,B0002KQNKO,"In ""It Lives Again"", two years after the events of the first movie a happy couple called the Scotts (Fredric Forrest and Kathleen Lloyd) are about to expect a baby. However Frank Davis (John P. Ryan) the father of the original mutant monster warns them about their upcoming unborn child being a creature and now there are three abominations that must be studied to see if they can be domesicated but can they be trusted?. Then in ""It's Alive III: Island of the Alive"", the murderous toddlers are being rounded up to a secluded island where they grow up as even more dangerous and can reproduce but can the father (Michael Morarity) of the beast tame it or will it's clan devour humanity?

""It Lives Again"" and ""It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive"" are both nice sequels to the 1974 Larry Cohen cult classic, if the first one dealed with the theme of how radioation can affect an unborn child then these two sequels deal with the theme of pro-life and how the mutations of infants can affect society. Larry Cohen has written, produced and directed these two sequels and Rick Baker who did the make-up and creature effects for the original movie has done the other killer infants for ""It Lives Again"" and ""It's Alive 3"" co-stars Karen Black and Gerrit Graham.

The DVD contains decent picture on both movies especially sound and contains theatrical trailers with audio commentaries by Larry Cohen. Even though these two movies aren't nearly as good as the classic original but are still worth watching if your a Larry Cohen fan.",1191974400,,1524,4.682835820895522
8028484,4,B0002KQNKO,"In my review of 'It's Alive' I noted that that film was surprisingly serious and low-key for a film about murderous mutant babies.  The same cannot be said for these two movies.  However, they're highly entertaining, so between the 3 of them we get a bit of everything.  This is some very entertaining schlock horror right here.  Can't imagine why it isn't more popular.

'It Lives Again' is the better of the two here, and probably the best of the series.  This is a direct sequel, as the killer baby epidemic is spreading and the government has resorted to immediate execution.  Frank Davis is back with a number of sympathetic doctors and scientists, and is working to save the children.  This time there are 3 babies, and there is a whole lot more baby mayhem.  Though they're still occasionally conspicously absent from the frame, you see a whole lot more of the kids this time around.  Obviously, they are rarely at all convincing but I think they look neat and seeing the babies maul someone is always a treat.  There's still quite a bit of downtime, but Frank is still entertaining to watch, so it doesn't hurt it all too much.  He's getting pretty obsessive and nutty by now, but I still sympathize with him.  This time around the whole thing seems a lot wackier.  Now they've got whole legions of cops waiting for the babies, and watching them search the hillside and lengthily discuss baby-hunting strategy is just very amusing.  The film is hurt by the fact that the ending is a bit to reiterative of the original.  Seems a little lazy this way, but it doesn't matter too much.

Grade: B

'Island of the Alive' is easily the weakest of the series, but it's still entertaining and deserves some credit for trying something new.  It starts Michael Moriarty as Jarvis, an actor who fathers a mutant child, and fights to have them saved.  After a hilarious and awesome courtroom scene involving a stop-motion animated baby it is decided that the killer babies will be banished to some jungle island.  The film focuses on a few years later where there is an expedition to see how the babies have grown.  This points to the central problem-- The babies are all grown up throughout the climax of the film, so they're basically just monster people.  That is much less appealing.  Still, there's quite a bit of baby action at the beginning, and it's the best stuff of the series.  There's a sequence where a pack of hired guns go out to wipe out the babies shortly after they're placed on the island which is absolutley priceless, culmnating in the final survivor fleeing in the helicopter only to find that, dear God!, there's a baby already inside which leaps on him from behind.  Also, then the helicopter explodes, for no apparent reason.  As with all the Cohen monster films I've seen this movie has got a lotta talking, focusing largely on Moriarty's wacky, twitchy and crazy performance.  I find him fairly amusing, but he's definitely on display too much.  The film is also helped by a fair bit of gore, but the overall relative absence of the babies reduces the charm of the film substantially.

Grade: C+

Yeah, this disc is definitely worth at least a rental.  At this low of a price I'm sure I'll pick it up sooner or later, actually, but ya certainly oughta see it at least once.",1142380800,4,3295,4.617900172117039
8028485,3,B0002KQNKO,"You gotta hand it to Larry Cohen. If you don't know who he is, he's the chap responsible for some of the more ludicrous horror and exploitation films made in the last thirty or so years. You probably heard about a little film called ""The Stuff"" where a greedy corporation markets a mysterious organic substance as the latest low fat sensation only to discover later that the tasty snack turns people into gelatinous mounds of goo. What, you never heard about it? O.k., then you at least know a thing or two about ""God Told Me To,"" a strange movie that takes as its starting point a string of grisly murders but ends up morphing into your run of the mill alien abduction/return of the Son of God picture. No way! You aren't familiar with this film either? Don't tell me you've spent most of your life working, taking care of your kids, or other such meaningless activities? You're starting to make me angry. Do you mean to tell me you never heard about any of these classic schlock films? Pathetic. Well, it's off to your room for a few fun filled hours with Larry Cohen's ""It's Alive"" trilogy.

The DVD company that released Cohen's trilogy wisely put parts two and three on a single disc. Why? Because this much pure schlock is best confined to one place. As schlocky as ""It's Alive"" is, that installment pales in comparison to the ridiculous, over the top shenanigans you'll witness on this platter. ""It's Alive 2"" fades in a year or two after the first film ended, and introduces us to funky '70s couple Eugene and Jody Scott (Frederic Forrest and Kathleen Lloyd respectively) as the two celebrate the impending birth of their first child in a home that drips shag carpeting and clashing color schemes. In the corner sits Frank Davies (John P. Ryan), the father from the first film, patiently waiting for the moment when he can talk to our soon to be parents. To make a long story short, it turns out that Frank now works with a couple of doctors to rescue the mutant babies from the fascist grip of the federal government, specifically from a Mr. Mallory (John Marley). Mallory, who has his own story to tell about demonic spawn, has dedicated his life to eradicating this plague. The rest of the film involves the battle to keep three of these evil kids alive long enough to see what they'll do when they grow up. Of course, Gene and Jody struggle with accepting their horrific child while the kids murder numerous people.

""It's Alive III: Island of the Alive"" reaches for the heights of inanity by giving up none other than the grating Michael Moriarty as Stephen Jarvis, a low rent actor who had a mutant baby with a blonde chick named Ellen (Karen Black). The movie opens in a courtroom as Jarvis tries to save his baby from a death sentence. He partially succeeds when the judge sends the kid, along with other demon spawn, to a remote island. Flash forward a bunch of years to a time when a group of scientists wish to study the babies to see how they've grown. The whole gang, with the now aging Lieutenant Perkins (James Dixon) from the first and second entries along for security, sets sail for the island. We're treated to numerous groan inducing scenes as Moriarty hams it up unmercifully on the boat, singing sea shanties and generally making a real dope of himself. Predictably, disaster strikes when the crew reaches the island and runs smack dab into the now full-grown mutants, who have lost none of their appetite for human flesh. Moriarty ends up sailing these kids to Florida, finds himself stranded in Cuba, and reappears in America in time to reunite kiddie and mommy. Egads!

What's good and what's bad? Well, seeing John Ryan reprise his role from the first film in the second installment certainly helps more than it hurts. Also lending assistance to the watchability of these two films is a higher gore content, especially in the third entry. Arms torn from sockets, eye gouging, arteries spraying, and gallons of sauce certainly make up for the lack of the red stuff we saw in the first film. But the bad, or I should say ridiculous, eclipses the good. The presence of the insufferable Moriarty, who decides to act weirder than Crispin Glover, really drags the third installment down. I've never liked Moriarty as an actor, and I like him even less in any of his appearances in Larry Cohen's films. And speaking of leads in these two films, let's not forget Frederic Forrest's turn in ""It's Alive 2."" What's up with the whole Gordon Lightfoot look? I kept waiting for him to break into a lively rendition of ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald."" Then there are the special effects for the killer kids, created by none other than Rick Baker. They aren't too bad all things considered, but the stop motion trick and the adult sized demons in the third film elicit more laughs than shrieks. Finally, Cohen tries to work in a lot of themes in both films--pharmaceutical recklessness, pollution--and then does nothing with them. Why bother?

Extras on the disc include a Cohen commentary for both films and trailers for both movies. Yawn. I've come to the conclusion that I don't really care for Larry Cohen's films. I like a few of them in a sort of disinterested way, but I can't think of any beyond ""God Told Me To"" that I would watch again. I might watch these movies if nothing else appealed on the television late at night, but that's the best I can say for them. Oh well. Fans of exploitation should still give Cohen's catalogue a once over just to say they've seen his work.",1123200000,,5508,4.611620795107034
8028486,1,B0002KQNKO,"It's ALive 3: Island of the Alive is down right hilarious. Nothing is better than watching mutant babies grow up and eat people. I mean seriously. My personal favorite scene was the court room scene with the ""baby"" in the cage. Good laughs.

In this flick, Michael Moriarity portrays a father of a mutant ""baby."" The government decides to put the lil' suckers (theres five or so now) on an uncharted island. Five years later, they decide they need to get ""fluid samples"" off the creatures for scientific research. Michael Moriarity goes along for the ride. Well the ""babies"" have grown into five year old ""adults."" And one of them has had a baby of their own. Yes indeed, Moriarity is a Pappy. All is well until they all die. Except Moriarity. The monsters want to get back to civilization and Moriarity gets stuck with the job of taking them there. Somewhere along the journey, they chuck him out into the ocean, Cuba picks him up, he gets back to the states, bla bla bla. All in all, this is a funny movie that deserves a four star rating on a B-movie scale. Watching this movie alone is like getting beat to death by golf clubs, but watching it with a bunch of B-movie lovers is a riot.

If you liked ""Island of the Alive"" I recomend: the awesomely bad movie ""Creature,"" it's sci-fi on drugs and totally funny.

8028488,3,B0002KQNKO,"Writer, producer and director Larry Cohen completes his cannibal mutant baby trilogy with the last two films, It's Lives Again (1978) aka It's Alive II and It's Alive III: Island of the Alive (1987), both available here on one DVD.

It Lives Again stars Fredric Forrest (Apocalypse Now) and Kathleen Lloyd (The Car) as Eugene and Jody Scott, a young couple expecting their first baby.  What they don't know is the gooberment has been keeping tabs on them, as test results, provided by their doctor, indicate their pregnancy may result in the same sort of freakish horror experienced by the Davis couple of the first film, an experience shared by a growing number of couples.  The official reaction is to put the babies down at birth, but an underground movement has developed, one intended to save these babies, as to study and learn from them.  Are they truly the next step in human evolution, as some think, or are they the result of some strange, unforeseen side effect to various over the counter drugs used by millions of people everyday?  Returning from the first film is John P. Ryan as Frank Davis, father of the first freaky infant, and deeply involved with the underground movement to save the babies, Andrew Duggan as Dr. Perry (I'm unsure if he's actually reviving his role from the first film as in that one his character was credited just as `The Professor'), and James Dixon (the only actor to appear in all three films) as Detective Perkins.  Also appearing is John Mallory (The Godfather) as Mr. Mallory, a man working with the gooberment as he has a personal interest in seeing these nasty creatures put down.

In It's Alive III: Island of the Alive, the story continues, this time on a much larger scale, as now the case of the freaky babies goes to court, as the gooberment tries to justify its' policy of killing these creatures at birth, while Stephen Jarvis (Hey, it's Michael Moriarty from TV's Law & Order...and he's got a full head of hair, to boot...actually Moriarty seemed a Larry Cohen favorite who, along with Dixon, appeared in Cohen's other films like Q: The Winged Serpent and The Stuff), father to one of the creepy crawlers tries to save his young son's life.  His impassioned plea ultimately results in a stay of execution for his son and others, but on the condition that the abhorrent children are exiled to a secluded, uninhabited island where they shall live out the rest of their natural lives, a threat to no one, that is until a small group, including Jarvis, decide to travel to the island, finding that, due to an accelerated growth rate, the babies are now adults...reproductive adults.  Also appearing in the film is B movie fan favorite Karen Black (Trilogy of Terror...remember that wacky Zuni doll?  I sure do...nothing sez loving like a Zuni in the oven).

One thing I noticed about both these films is that Cohen, not seeming content to churn out more of the same, really put an effort into expanding the original story, to which I think he did to some degree of success, although neither of the following films was able to, in my opinion, really revive the shock value of the first.  In It Lives Again, Cohen does manage to import some of the wonderful qualities of the first film, helped greatly by the inclusion of a number of returning characters.  Also, I thought Forrest and Lloyd did very well in their parts showing the stresses and strain having a freakishly hideous mutant cannibal baby can have on a marriage.  I really enjoyed the notion of two factions, one being the gooberment intent on putting these creatures down on sight, and the other, and underground movement designed to save, protect, and learn from these creatures (to their ultimate folly).  The film got a little bogged down near the end, but still came through as a suitable, and enjoyable, successor to the first.  In It's Alive III: Island of the Alive, I thought the film started out strong, but then deviated in some very strange directions, figuratively and literally...at one point, Jarvis is thrown overboard after his mutant son commandeers the ship which Jarvis and his group travel to the Island with, and Jarvis ends up in Cuba...it was certainly weird, but kinda funny...actually, I perceived the character of Jarvis to take on a sort of Odysseus (of Homer's The Iliad) quality as his journey was long and fraught with curious peril.  The movie, made some 13 years after the first, has the best production values of the three, but seemingly the least amount of heart, which was sad, but not entirely unexpected, as often the more sequels there are to a film, the more diluted and strained the original concept becomes (look at the Police Academy films for a prime example of this).  Keep in mind, as with the first, the horror elements in these two films are less of the visceral kind, despite the advertising, (there's minimal blood in all three, but what there is, is used effectively). We rarely get to see the creatures in any of the films (except maybe the third, as the `adults' run around a bit, looking kinda goofy in their rubber suits).  Also, the special effects are of the minimal kind (shoddy...the third film does feature some stop motion work, but it's not that great), which, I think is part of the reason we see so little of the creatures, but more so as to create a real sense of suspense and fear, always keeping them sort of in our peripheral vision.

Both films are presented in widescreen format, with It's Alive III sporting the better quality print.  It Lives Again looks good, but there's white speckling present (probably due to age deterioration), and the audio is very soft in some spots.  Both films feature their original theatrical trailers and a commentary track by Cohen.

8028489,3,B0002KQNKO,"Larry Cohen is a fabulous writer whose stories are unique and thrilling, not to mention at times hilarious.  I'm real pleased that his recent films (Phone Booth and its ironic mirror image Cellular) has brought him back into the public eye.

It's Alive 3 is the culmination of the trilogy, which in its way mirrors the evolution of the Romero ""Dead"" movies.  As the films progress, the mutant births are more and more prevalent, and we're seeing more of how the general public reacts to them.

The film starts strong with a woman giving birth in a cab and a cop helping in the delivery.  As he realizes the baby is ""one of them"", he pulls out his revolver and starts shooting between the woman's legs.

There's a great sequence with Cohen regular Michael Moriarity in court, pleading for custody of his mutant son.  Gerritt Graham (remember him) is great as the opposing attorney who suggests that if Moriarity loves his son so much, he should take it out of the steel cage he is currently imprisoned...and hold it.

Unfortunately, that's where the film just falls apart.  We flash to some time later where we learn that the babies grow at an accelerated (or ""speeded-up"") rate on an uncharted island they have been imprisoned on.  Great idea...if it wasn't for the fact that the grown up babies look like giant six-foot tall babies, giant fang-faced heads and everything.  There's more than a passing resemblance to one of Rick Baker's first jobs, Octaman.  Tragic and laughable.

Well worth the time till about halfway in, and a good end to a strong trilogy.",1096934400,,1560,4.712177121771218
