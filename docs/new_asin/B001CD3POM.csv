3508676,4,B001CD3POM,"I am fortunate enough to have this on laser disc and while it may not be up to new DVD standards, the quality is still far better than VHS. I would definitely buy a restored DVD issue when it becomes available. I loved this version. I just watched the newer BBC version on PBS. Overall it was very well done but I thought it did a poor job explaining the ""mystery"" at the conclusion. We had friends that could not figure out who was related to whom at the end, and I have heard that PBS received tons of e-mails asking for clarification. It almost came across as if Arthur and Amy were step brother and sister.",1240963200,7,610,4.222222222222222
3508677,5,B001CD3POM,"When this film (or should I say films) came out in 1988, the New York City art house theatre that was showing it did something unusual.  You could buy tickets for either movie (and see them on separate days) or you could buy tickets for both (at a discounted price) and watch the whole story in one day.  I opted for the one-day marathon.  Part 1 ran from 10:00am - 1:00.  You then had an hour and a half to go out and grab a bite of lunch.  Part 2 started at 2:30 - 5:30pm.  As other reviewers have stated, this is a beautifully filmed, detailed and magnificently acted story.  Since there is a great deal going on it does require your full attention to detail and storyline.  One wonders if they could get away with making a film like this today.  At 6 hours in length, they were only able to have one showing a day.  It certainly wouldn't be a moneymaker!",1238716800,6,858,4.208588957055214
3508678,5,B001CD3POM,"This is a miracle of film adaptation and fine performance - not only Alec Guinness but Derek Jacobi, Miriam Margolyese, Cyril Cusack, Joan Greenwood, Max Wall, Patricia Hayes, Roshan Seth, Bill Fraser & Eleanor Bron, in supremely fine and memorable performances. In some cases, sadly, also their last. This is THE Dickens adaptation, lacking a little in staging, but definitive in concept, story telling and character realisation. The use of Verdi's music throughout is perfectly done. One of the very few such works that will still be viewed in 100 years, I believe. One of Guinness' greatest roles, almost at the end of his career.",1428364800,3,633,5.038095238095238
3508679,5,B001CD3POM,This is the best adaptation even though it leaves out certain sub-plots that are very entertaining in the book. The performance of Alec Guinness and those of everyone else are superb. The overall mood and the ambiance perfectly capture Dickens' story. It's difficult to mix the pathos and humor of Dickens' creation in film but this version succeeds.,1424649600,,350,5.051724137931035
3508680,4,B001CD3POM,"I loved the 2009 BBC version of Little Dorrit and then bought VHS in order to be able to see this 1987 version, which I also like a great deal and which is very clever way of dealing with the book.  Nonetheless, the telling of the story is a very different experience than one has in reading the book, so for me there is a bit of ""oddity"" about this version.  I prefer 2009.

I bought this DVD from Amazon about a year ago, since it was labeled universal and claimed to play on any machine.  It definitely does not, and Amazon has since changed the labeling.  Like the prior reviewer, I found it would play on my computer but not on my DVD Region 1 player.  I have since acquired a universal player and assume that it will play on that so I can get rid of all those tapes.",1417132800,3,772,4.079470198675497

3508684,5,B001CD3POM,"It's something Wilkie Collins might have done--to Dickens' initial disapproval but eventual admiration. The story of Little Dorrit is told first from the perspective of her hero and in the end her husband. The it is retold from Dorrit's perspective. Both versions of the story are superbly told, but what a difference. Truth, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder!

I can't recommend this marvelous production too highly. It's just unfortunate that it's only available in PAL, so I had to watch it on my laptop. Perhaps someday it will be released with a universal (0) coding for everyone to enjoy.",1381881600,2,603,4.854368932038835

3508686,5,B001CD3POM,don't be put off by the dark photography and mumbling British.  I had to put on earphones to catch the wonderful nuances of this brilliant story.  I watched in piecemeal for a few days until I finally couldn't stop.,1328313600,2,215,4.487179487179487
3508687,5,B001CD3POM,"I went to see this (these) film(s) in the theatre when they were first released in the US. I went with great anticipation to see part one with the prospect of an incredible ""event"" forthcoming. During wading through part one, I was very disappointed and sure that I was not going to force myself to sit-through part two. All I could think was ""NOTHING'S HAPPENING! MY GOD, DO SOMETHING! THIS IS SO BORING! NOTHING BUT EXPOSITION! THERE'S NO WAY I'M SITTING THROUGH PART 2!"" And then...in the last two (?) minutes of the movie, with the final tag ""Now, see the story through Dorrit's eyes"" (or something like that), I was like ""What? WHAT?"" And HAD to come back the next week to see part 2. I was then treated to three solid hours of complete payoff! Three hours of ""Oh, my god! She never knew!"", etc. I've never had a more surprisingly enjoyable experience in the cinema! I've only had the chance to see these movies once, way back in 1994, and I still refer to them at least once a month in some conversation. I so look forward to these films ever being released on DVD or (I can dream) Blu-Ray! Marvelous!!!",1288483200,4,1109,4.4411764705882355

8286810,5,B001CD3POM,"We have loved this for years on VHS and finally got a DVD player that will play it. It's a good transfer. Some people don't like this version of the story because leaving out some characters it isn't true to the book. But told as it is here, it is the book's basic story and is delightful. Everything that makes a good movie is here, cast, acting, direction, camera work, lighting, sound, music, everything. Do try to see it.",1484784000,,425,4.3924050632911396
8286811,4,B001CD3POM,"Actually, I love this film version of Little Dorrit.  However, the discs that I received DO NOT play!  Period!  Even though it says ""Universal Suitable for All"" on the DVD holder.  Since I had already seen this film many times over the years, I didn't watch it on this DVD right away.  Now, months later, I tried to play it and the screen says ""Disc error"".  Neither disc will play.  I'm very upset and disappointed with the seller.  Money wasted that I didn't have to waste.  This was a rare gift"" to myself.  Irony!",1481155200,,517,4.404255319148936

8286817,5,B001CD3POM,"One of the most satisfying dramatic adaptations of a Dickens novel I've ever seen.

Alec Guiness's performance as William Dorrit, imprisoned for debt for over a quarter century, was Oscar-nominated (and probably deserved to win), as was the script by director Christine Edzard.

One of the particular treats of the film is the set design.  It is simply a pleasure to look at this film.

The film (actually two films) takes an unusual approach to the story.  Rather than simply adapt the novel straightforwardly, the two films tell the same story twice, the first from the point of view of the hero, William Clennam (Derek Jacobi), and the second from the point of view of the heroine, Amy Dorrit, the daughter of William, and the titular ""Little Dorrit"" (Sarah Pickering in what is, as far as I can tell, her only screen role).  Since there are many scenes in which only one of the characters are present, each film contains considerable material that is not in the other, and the shared material is seen from two different perspectives.

However, as a consequence of, to a degree, telling the same story twice, large parts of the novel, and, despite the huge cast, many important characters, are eliminated from the screenplay.  Characters like Tattycoram and Miss Wade get short shrift, and the ruthless criminal Rigaud (aka Blandois and Lagnier) is completely absent.

While the structure of the film(s) is interesting, it probably would have been better to adapt the first half of the book in the first film and the second half of the book in the second film in order to make a more complete narrative.",1431216000,8,1606,4.810909090909091
8286818,5,B001CD3POM,"The DVD version I got directly from Sand Films is all region PAL. The gotcha is the PAL encoding (instead of NTSC). I was surprised that my region 1 Blu-ray player refused to play it. It played okay on my Mac, which apparently understands PAL, but is still set up for region 1. It also played fine in my all region Blu-ray player that I bought just for such occasions.

Now being available in widescreen is great, though I never thought I would have to ride the volume control on a Dickens movie. The crowd scenes and music are much louder than some of the dialog. This version of Little Dorrit focuses mostly on the main characters, where the 2008 version includes more about the secondary characters, mainly for comic relief. The rating is for the content, not the playback issues.",1430438400,4,783,4.553191489361702
