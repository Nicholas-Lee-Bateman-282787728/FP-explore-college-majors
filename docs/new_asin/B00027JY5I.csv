2065258,5,B00027JY5I,"This is not Tales of the Plains, which was a compilation only availabe on VHS.  This is Lonesone Dove - The Series (DVD), and a heck of a deal.  I took a chance and ordered it, hoping it was the later, and was right.  It's obviously mispriced as well, because it's about $40 everywhere else.  Buy it while you can!",1102550400,15,314,4.183333333333334
2065259,5,B00027JY5I,i love westerns and try to see as many as i can. i loved the various lonesome dove miniseries but i never knew there was a tv series until i came across the dvd sets and picked them up. the first season is very different from the second season but this entire show is addictive viewing. i started with the first season a few weeks ago and i'm currently making my way through the outlaw years. season one contains 21 episodes and takes place immediately following return to lonesome dove as newt rides off to find his own dream and comes to the town of curtis wells. captain woodrow call also makes an appearance in season one. the second season is the outlaw years and it contains 22 episodes that reminded me of the grimness of the streets of laredo book and movie and it greatly captures the grit of the old west. the events that transpire at the end of season one and continue into season two are gut wrenching. as a lifelong western fan i'm very pleased with the dvd sets of both seasons of this series.,1099440000,52,1007,4.333333333333333
2065260,5,B00027JY5I,I would have gotten my set of Lonesome Dove: The Series from Amazon but I couldn't find it on here. How odd! They have the sequel series. Western fan: When it wasn't on here I went to Best Buy and got it. It's a great series and great DVD set!,1097798400,6,243,3.88
2065261,4,B00027JY5I,"First there was Lonesome Dove the miniseries. Then came Return To Lonesome Dove the miniseries. Then came Lonesome Dove: The Series which was followed by the Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years. There was also another Lonesome Dove sequel miniseries Streets of Laredo as well as a prequel miniseries Dead Man's Walk.

The DVD sold on this page is just the first three episodes of Lonesome Dove: The Series. I like those episodes but there is a set of all 21 episodes of that show available on DVD which is a far better buy for fans of the show. Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years has also been released in a 22 episode DVD set. Both The Series and The Outlaw Years were great programs and deserve a four star rating. You'd really be better off buying those full season sets instead of the DVD sold on this page since the Tales of the Plains DVD on this page only has three episodes of Lonesome Dove: The Series on it.",1097193600,34,910,4.416666666666667

2065286,1,B00027JY5I,"Loathsome Dog would be a better title for this politically correct version of Gunsmoke.  Insipid plots, overacting, underacting, loose ends left dangling, and I can't for the life of me figure out what this series has to do with the original mini-series, which was the best western ever made for cinema or tv.  And it's like the writers couldn't decide who the bad guys in the story were going to be.  Ex rebel soldiers?  Nah.  Indians, yes, we'll make them the bad guys.  Oh, wait a minute, that's politically incorrect, let's' make 'em the good guys instead.  Let's have a bunch of gunfights, fistfights, a romance and ever other plot that's been used in the last 50 years 500 times over.  Borrrrrrring.",1415145600,,705,4.721311475409836

2065289,5,B00027JY5I,"The Mrs. and I are true Lonesome Dove fans. We have everything, including the prequel movies. While browsing a discount retailer I found this brand new for a measly $5.00. Which we didn't even know existed. We were thrilled and once we ""adjusted"" to the idea of Newt being on his own and apart from the more Lonesome Dove ""aura"" we really enjoyed it.

We see a young, idealistic Newt settling into a livery job, his courtship and claiming a bride, building a house and becoming his own character so to speak. The adventures you would expect come his way. Scouting. Outlaws, Indians and becoming, initially, a part time deputy sheriff. The Series will not disappoint you - it pretty much follows the Lonesome Dove formula with toughness, cunning, tragedy and a certain wholesomeness and leaves us stricken with the loss of Newt's wife. We would love to acquire the Outlaw Years but the pricing is ridiculous - I saw it a local used cd/dvd shop for $45 and to me - even, that seems expensive. I hope somehow the price of the Outlaw Years can be brought down as we look forward to seeing it.",1405900800,,1088,4.551020408163265

2065291,4,B00027JY5I,"Considering I am such a hardcore LD fan, have read most of McMurtry's series, I can't believe that I didn't know this series existed! It must have either gone straight to synidcation or was unavailable on any current cable format in my area. I purchased this set from Amazon, and while it took a few episodes to 'get rolling' I found that the actors and 'feel' of the show manages to hit its stride by the fourth episode. Lead SCOTT BAIRSTOW at first seems kind of bland, but manages to grow on you in subtle ways. I've never been a fan of Diahann Carroll either, but she really turns in a fine series of charming, thoughtful performances. Robert Culp adds fine flavor to early episodes. Billy D Williams also turns up, but his character seems like an afterthought. The series highpoint though, may be DENNIS WEAVER in the part of Buffalo Bill Cody. He seems to be having a blast as he sings, charms and parades through the series in a wonderful characterization unlike anything I've seen. I'm only on the fourth disc, but I highly recommend this series. Look for later episodes directed by STUART MARGOLIN, as he contributes what may be the best material in this premier season!",1402185600,2,1179,4.619047619047619
2065292,5,B00027JY5I,"And who can complain?

I saw Lonesome Dove when it first came out, years ago. This Fall, I noticed it on the video shelf at the public library, so I watched it again and was overwhelmed enough to read the book and to watch the three latter additions to the story line -- two prequels (""Dead Man's Walk,"" and ""Comanche Moon""), and one sequel (""The Streets of Laredo""). I quickly  read the books as well! This secondary television series that was apparently created without the approval or input of author, Larry McMurtry, sat on the library shelf during all that time, and I never felt called to take it home, unitl curiosity finally won out. I fully expected it to suck bigtime (as they say).

This is not Lonesome Dove, but it is well-written, well-casted, well filmed, generally exciting, sometimes inspiring, and overall interesting enough to rate five stars, and I am not much of a television fan.  This series is not Lonesome Dove despite the fact that its main character is cast as Newt... despite the fact that in the REAL story line, Newt died shortly after Captain Call left Montana, when the Hell Bitch horse reared up and fell back on him, crushing his rib cage and heart with the saddle horn. So this dude sure as heck ain't Newt. But he is a wonderful protagonist. You'll probably come to like and admire him.

There's another reason why this series is not Lonesome Dove. The four real Lonesome Dove stories hold together as an embodiment of Larry McMurtry's unique philosophy and form a conglomerate expression of his unequaled  style. That's lacking here (of course). Also, the video versions of the four real LD stories were all stand-alone, novel-length tales, while here we have a purposely made-for-television series, albeit one with its component episodes strung together nicely enough to warrant watching all the way through, in order.

There are a few (what you might call) ""easter eggs"" stuffed into the series here and there. On especially intense occasions you're liable to hear snatches of the original Lonesome Dove soundtrack (it must be said that the new ""Series"" soundtrack does fit well it and may grow on you). Then there's a surprise visit by a Captain Woodrow, or somebody at least purporting to be that man. Another nice little touch is what the new owner of the town's hotel paints atop its rounded false front.

If ""Lonesome Dove: the Series"" had been made on its own account, and named something else, I suspect that most of its detractors would have enjoyed it more and might even have admired it. As television series go, this is one of the best! Even viewers who are not big on Westerns will find many reasons to delight in it.

One things that delighted me (sad as it was) is that just when I had become really tired of the Western genres oldest and stodgiest tricks - the sholder shot clean through... the hero ""only grazed"" once again for the upteenth time on his noggin... the durn burn outlaw that keeps shooting holes in the brims of his co-star's cowboy hats - the makers of this Series decided to break out of their box and do something really realistic - something really daring - something that, unfortunately does happen from time to time in real life (and something that happens all the time in the novels of Larry McMurtry): they kill off one of the most important characters, in the final episode of the season.

You'll notice a touch of political correctness in ""Lonesome Dove: the Series,"" but, on many occasions this show also illustrates very well, the fact that free people must be armed, and disarmed people are either slaves or they wear the badge of servitude. In fact, if garden variety political correctness allowed all the firearms bearing and gunplay that you'll see in ""Lonesome Dove: the Series,"" I don't suppose that most of us would dispise political correctness as much as we do!

Yep, you'll like ""Newt;"" and you'll admire his pretty and headstrong wife Hannah. Personally, my favorite character is Colonel Clay Mosby, veteran of the recent War Between the States. Keeping with the rest of the set up here, this is not Colonel John Singleton Mosby (Gray Ghost of the Confederacy), but he is one hell of a man, and he practices the kind of honor that is commonly lacking today, and which, if valued and practiced by enough of us again, would transform our down-at-the-heels and oft of late completely despicable excuse of a nation into everything that it might be and everything that it was meant to be.

I understand that this Series continued after its first year. If so, I intend to see what followed!",1385683200,2,4576,4.720551378446116

2065330,5,B00027JY5I,"I liked the Lonesome Dove movie series so much that I read the books as well.  It also caused me to read many of the classic western novels, Zane Grey, Louis Lamour, Terry C. Johnston and others.  I now consider myself a knowledgeable novice on the subject of westerns.

I rated the TV series highly, although I have not yet seen them all, largely because there are so few westerns being made now.  For the serious western movie buff, this series has good and bad points.  The good points are that it is a western and the guns appear to be correct for the times.  Some of the bad points are:  one, the stories are short for the one hour TV format and do not really build (although many of the characters are there for each show) as they did the movies.  Second, everyone is too clean, even when camping.  The battles with the bad guys are a bit unrealistic - not at all like the battle with Blue Duck in the movies.  Lastly, the series seems to be primarily a love story set in the late 1800's.  This is not the theme I am looking for when I watch westerns.

But, if you like westerns, and I do, this series is far better than most of the old TV westerns and better in many respects than the old classic western movies.  You can't go wrong to buy this one.",1196035200,3,1256,4.183333333333334
