7957005,5,B00005YREP,"Aside from the horendus acting, inane filming, absurd plot, and a usless director, this movie is RAAAAAADDD!!!!  At times the directer of this F-Movie must have been on drugs. This is evident due to the films overall lack of a little thing called a plot.  In this movie the story follows wang, a complete master of fighting. He is hired to protect the governments money but is ambushed then saved by a mysterious man.  The man is really an evil conspiratist, waiting for his chance to take the govenments property. He kills wang and steels his daugter but lets his son go.  The son is raised in the wilderness and seeks training from an old geezer with a muschdash.  After his training is complete the goes to face the evil kil( the man who murdured his father).
He goes about his buisness by sending kil threatening letters, as he makes his move he meets another man that shares his apperance and his mission.  They kick, punch, and fly through hords of kils minnions.  Finaly one dragon dies but the other lives on. He faces kil and his deadly hair, eventually killing him.  Then kil meets his father who was suposed to be dead and kils daughter who was realy Dragons sister. They walk off into the forest a family once again.........genus.",1055894400,,1242,4.588235294117647
