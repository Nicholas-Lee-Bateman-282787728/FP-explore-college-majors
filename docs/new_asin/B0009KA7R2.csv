8062531,3,B0009KA7R2,"This movie runs about 90 mins, was released around 2004, has original English as well as dubbed Spanish audio, a couple of trailers, and a music video.

The story involves familiar archtypes for the Mexican/Latino culture including deep religious faith, gang culture/violence, and making tough choices between your homies/barrio and taking a different direction in life.

Although boxing is brought up and hovers around as a theme, no one even steps into the ring to spar. The ""training"" here is to actually strengthen the main characters fight in life.

There is also a young woman that plays a writer and her character comes across(for me) a bit snobby and know-it-all""ish"". But she is an important piece of the puzzle for the struggling young shot-caller who is looking to transform his thug lifestyle.

Having grown up around Los Angeles, I am familiar with the Latino street culture and found the language/dialog, clothing, and manerisms of the actors consistent with how things are out here in the City of Angels.

The ending is particularly bloody and violent and the movie overall is unflinching in it's brutality. I gave it three stars because certain scenes dragged a bit and the movie has a low-budget feel to it. But overall I still enjoyed it and recommend it for those interested in this niche genre of Latino street culture.",1336867200,,1339,4.959821428571429
8062532,1,B0009KA7R2,"I enjoy corny Hispanic gangster movies because it reminds me of the people I grew up with. Blood In, Blood Out- overdramatic and laughable! American Me- sad, but the ""you've never been with a woman before scene"" will always be a joke among my friends. 187 Shadow Lane- so bad I couldn't finish watching it. I didn't even want to laugh at how bad it was. Bad, bad, bad.",1255046400,,368,4.3478260869565215
8062533,5,B0009KA7R2,"Amigo Film's latest release, 187 Shadow Lane, is simply said - an untouched gem. This film features oscar-worthy acting, a soundtrack featuring Frank Sonatra and Enrique Iglesias, fighting choreography by John Woo, and special effects by Mo Warren. All this combines to feature an epic story of a man named Abraham.

The story is about a man named Shadow who trains to become a world-class fighter. This movie rivals that of Rocky and Ali. Danny Romo stars as The Old Man who trains Shadow. The Old Man is the Mexican version of Mr. Miyagi (Karate Kid, 1988). The drama is intense between the two, even resulting in heartstopping fight scenes among the Master and the Padawan.

The film quality is amazing. The video features THX-certified, remastered footage that features scenes that are so crisp clear that I could see the mole on Shadow's back.

The acting is incredible. Pablo Francisco's acting in this film rivals that of the Godfather series. He is the next Al Capone in my eyes. His mastery of the F-word and the body motions of a Mexican gangster is superb. If Pablo didn't steal the show, Danny Romo stole the audience. One scene features him crying over his family. This was one of the most emotionally charged scenes I have ever seen in my life. I was drawn to tears as I heard him wailing. God Bless the Old Man. I still cry when I go to sleep when I think of that scene.

If you are interested in a fighting or boxing flick and are tired of low-quality productions or tired of watching Rocky fight five times, this movie is for you. A mix of high quality acting, fighting, and music make this the best fighting film of the decade. I don't know why more people have not seen or rated this movie. I think it is because they do not get much publicity; Amigo films is located in Pablo, New Mexico, so it is somewhat far from Hollywood. Watch this film and tell your friends to see the magic of 187 Shadow Lane.",1242518400,3,1921,4.495702005730659
8062534,3,B0009KA7R2,"don't judge this movie by it's cover... i bought it cuase of the title and a lil for the story. it sounded good, and the title, well, pretty much anything w/ 187 in it, usually implies a gangsta movie, right?

not so in this case... i mean, it's gangster, but it centers around one thug named Shadow, who's confused. He's in charge of a gang, and is kinda going soft. He meets an old man who wants to train him as a 'boxer' so he says... Shadow goes to learn 'boxing', but he's not really learning how to box, he's learning how to be a man and let go of the gang life... and get a good life.

Of course, as he's trying to get out and go straight, his gang life interferes w/ that.. accidents happen, ppl lose their lives, closes ones of shadow and some of the gangstaz too...

it's one of those type movies.... it's good entertainment... good for a watch... take my advice, and rent it... or buy it cheap.",1205020800,12,905,4.189655172413793
