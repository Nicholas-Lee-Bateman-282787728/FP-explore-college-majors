5721947,3,B00CG6IUR6,"Nine Things About the Movie Post Tenebras Lux

1. This is one of the most abstract films I've seen in a long time.

2. The director, Carlos Reygadas, made this film based partly on things that happened to him in his life.

3. The movie is really not much more than a random collection of scenes from a man's life in the hills of Mexico, mixed with a contemplation of desire and fantasy.

4.  So we have scenes of a girl wandering in a field, a demon moving into a house, a rugby match, a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, a sex spa, and other disconnected events.

5. Reygadas said he wanted to make a movie where you feel life experiences more than understand them rationally. That's an understatement. Not very many scenes in the movie make much sense or seem to have a point.

6. Reygadas is onto something; there are some individual scenes that are very well done, and fascinating to watch. They touch on such deep life truths that you can only stare in awe.

7. But then there are other scenes that are pretty damn boring.

8. The movie is so ""artistic"" that it almost implodes. It is filmed in a 4:3 aspect ratio, like an old-fashioned TV. There is also a distortion effect around the edges of the screen, like you're looking through a window or something.

9. In the end, the only person that can really relate to what's going on is probably the director himself. And he's not explaining anything.",1387756800,7,1403,4.4453125
5721948,5,B00CG6IUR6,"Don't try to analyze this film rationally.  It is a mystery, it probes very deeply, and it is beautiful.  It comes from a long, profound, to me very interesting tradition of making art.  It's not trying to confuse you, so don't get angry at it.  But it does find reality confusing and complex, and to treat it otherwise impossible, if not dishonest.  The films of Bresson, Ruiz, Bunuel, come to mind, but there are many others.  Don't try to define ""what it is."" Just relax. Keep watching and asking ""what is it?""  If you prefer a ""what-it-is"" kind of film, there are plenty of good ones out there and you should enjoy them.

5721949,5,B00CG6IUR6,"One way to travel through a foreign country is to hire a tour guide. Sit in a bus and look on as the sights pass you by; occasionally disembark and follow someone around who explains what you're seeing, and then, in a few ""safe"" places wander around freely to shop. When you're done you've seen something, but remain yourself, essentially untouched and unchanged. Another way is to throw yourself in, hope to find your way, maybe get lost, or get drunk in a local dive and wake up not knowing where you've been.

Most films compare to the first approach to tourism. You get to look on, concerned, from a safe distance, as lives unfold on the window in front of you. You walk out, throw away the popcorn box, and you're done with it. Just a pleasant memory, or a vague sense of dissatisfaction, or an eagerness to take the ride again. Post Tenebras Lux (latin for ""after darkness, light"") is more like the other approach. If you try and make sense of it all together as it unfolds, it won't work. There's no clear distinction between what's real and fantasy, dream and waking life, past and present, possibility and actuality. Yet you get a feel for a place and a time, and a set of tensions between rich and poor, between rural and urban Mexico, between the longing to be decent and the longing to feel something. I don't think you can walk away unchanged. I think it's only afterwards, in the aftermath, that you can really assess the experience and begin to say what it was.

As far as plot goes, it is, primarily, an impressionistic depiction of two men who are fighting their own demons, that hints at the impact on their wives and children, and at their impact on each other. There is Juan, married to the beautiful Natalia, with two lovely children played by the director's own kids. For reasons unknown, they moved away from their extended family, into a gorgeous rural setting where they live much larger than the locals, but on a much smaller scale than the opulent lifestyle they'd obviously grown up in. He can't quite see what he has, he wants something else, and has a rage inside of him he pretends is not such a big deal but that he can't quite deal with. Then there is Siete, a proud but impoverished man, a man whose hatred for his father and whose struggles with addiction led to the loss of his family. He makes ends meet by taking on odd jobs, some not so savory.

The images are intensely lovely. They shot them somehow so that there is a kind of fisheye distortion at the edges combined with a double exposure - and that might seem like a gimmick but it works here and the impact is almost magical. (Like the ""vertigo"" shot that Hitchcock made famous: it works but maybe only in one film, and when the filmmakers know precisely the impact aimed for.) It makes the whole seem like a dream. (I think for full impact you should only watch this on a very large screen and in a darkened room. Don't even think of watching this on a phone.) It opens on a shot of a child, Rut, wandering a wet field with cows and horses and dogs running around her, and as the sky darkens we hear thunder and see lightning. I won't say more about the imagery except that there are some of the most astonishing cinematic images here I've ever encountered. For that alone, and for the beauty of the landscape (contrasted with the darkness of souls to create a feeling of the sublime in the classical Romantic sense) this is worth watching.

The scenes are not quite chronological, as there are flashbacks and flash forwards and dreamscapes that aren't sharply differentiated from the ""real"" moments -- and some of the flash forwards suggest possible rather than actual futures, as they seem to be incompatible with events that apparently unfold in the ""present"" of the film. The effect is not so much to tell a story as to deliver an experience - a feeling for a tension between different ways of being, and especially for different ways of being detached, unhinged from the wonder all around. There's a magical scene in which Juan seems to see this for the first time, to wonder at the beauty of his children, to long for the moments of possibility when as a child he was untouched by and unaware of the pain felt by the grownups around him. His wife, Natalia, is at the piano, playing Neil Young's incredible ode to childhood, to a hopeful past that may have never been: ""it's a dream, it's only a dream ... and it's fading now, fading away, it's only a dream, just a memory without anywhere to stay."" This film may seem something more like a nightmare -- it is dark -- but there is light. I found it to be quite an astonishing experience, and one of the most affecting films I've seen in a very long time.",1380326400,9,4705,4.461091753774681
5721950,4,B00CG6IUR6,"...just a memory without anywhere to stay."" This refrain from a song by Neil Young (and the only song in the film) just about sums up Post Tenebras Lux. Time goes backwards, forwards, through dreams and memories and fantasies, with little anchor. The film opens with Rut, the toddler-sister, in a kind of Eden which offers the lush visuals you expect from Reygadas. Later, in an absolutely transformative scene, Natalia, the mother, goes from being the object of ritual sex to the bearer of birth pains in so short a time and with no definable cut that one feels entertained by a magician. Juan, the father, and Eleazar, the son, get jumbled up as generations roll on making it impossible to place a protagonist. The Devil is a wild card I dare not touch. But, the Wealthy and the Poor, all these players, their obsessions and addictions, for what they are worth, all pale and quickly fade beside the exquisite beauty and simple power of nature. Juan's last speech seems to be the only human sighting of light, catching the brilliance of life.

Far less startling, and certainly not cathartic like his masterpiece Silent Light, Reygadas' story-telling style in Post Tenebras Lux is more in keeping with his earlier films. Shot in Mexico, and in parts of Europe, with many scenes photographed with a dizzying, distortion effect at the edges, one feels caught in a core sample of international films and in a dream. And considering the coda, I can understand a little why people booed at the screening at Cannes. A playing field crumbling to the elements is perhaps not a ruined Cathedral cradling the Russian countryside as in Nostalghia. But, the visual poetry is there along with the camera's patience to see things as they are. I'm happy to say that because of Reygadas and a few others, cinema did not die with Tarkovsky.",1377561600,3,1824,4.772151898734177

5721959,4,B00CG6IUR6,"I enjoyed Carlos Reygadas last film, Luz Silenciosa (Silent Light), though much more in the week following its screening than in the theatre itself. With hindsight, I believe I judged it harshly in my review.

I wonder whether Im about to do the same thing again.

Reygadas output is industrial-strength art-house: You need to pack a soft cushion, an imaginative frame of mind, and to have put your disbelief in colloidal suspension. You must stand ready to invent, apply and discard as many narrative hypotheses as it takes to find one which will help you make sense of what you're seeing.

With Luz Silenciosa, a film about a love triangle in a Mennonite community, I found one, if late in the piece: the idea that the camera itself is an intruder in the private world of the drama, necessarily intervening with what goes on. This was conveyed through continual reminders of the presence of a lens throughout the film, through rain-spots, sun flares, window frames and, on one occasion during a highway storm seen through a windscreen, all three.

The very act of observation irreparably changes the dynamic of the situation: only when someone is there to hear it, does a tree falling in a forest make a sound.

In Post Tenebras Lux (After Shadows, Light) we are, again, permanently aware of the camera, this time because Reygadas has, selected an almost insolently square aspect ratio and applied a lens which refracts, blurs and distorts the fringes of the picture. We feel as if we are inside a box brownie, or perhaps inside a dream.

A dream: Now theres a narrative hypothesis that might help.

A fashionable term for this screenplay is non-linear; another way of describing it is all over the place. We open with a toddler happily chasing cows and dogs around a wet football field at dusk as a brutal storm rolls in. It is quite an opening scene (as striking as, yet as different as could possibly be from, the sublime opener of Luz Silenciosa). The film principally concerns a couple and their two children, Rut and Eleazar (played by Reygadas own children), whom we meet at several points during their childhood. Much of it is spent in remote Mexican woodland country, where the family has an uneasy relationship with each other, their animals, and labourers who steal, drink, smoke pot, vandalise trees and convene AA meetings in a corrugated iron shed.

Wait  falling trees! As if to validate my tentative theory, we see labourers maliciously sabotaging trees, deep in the Mexican rainforest, hacking part way through their trunks, only for them to fall, later, when no-one but the all-seeing, fish-eyed camera lens is there. It sees, and hears, so we do. We change everything. George Berkeley would be pleased.

Beyond the Mexican bush, the scenes seem wilfully disconnected. Wealthy city folk at a Christmas party argue the toss between Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. At a distance, the family gambols in the surf, and mid-scene, the children regress ten years to toddlers. A couple of scenes take place, apropos absolutely nothing, on a rugby field in England. There is a long orgy scene in a French Sauna which manages to be faintly comical and decidedly menacing at the same time.

I don't pretend to have fathomed this film at all. But some impressions are forming, and by the end of the week I might have a theory about it. For the time being these ideas coalesce, like dream sequences in a box brownie:

There are threats all around us, natural, man-made and self-made. They thunder from the heavens and rise up from the ground. They emanate equally from our servants and our masters. Our own view is necessarily purblind; we are boxed in, constrained to see the world in terms dictated by our biology and our own distorted preconceptions. Yet, amongst all this, we remain exuberant, and confident, and out of angst, pain and loss comes vitality, love and advancement. Even as it ends, life goes on.

This may all be summarised in a passage from War and Peace, quoted rather obnoxiously at that dinner party:

""Pierre had learned, not with his mind, but with his whole being, his life, that man is created for happiness, that happiness is within him, in the satisfying of natural human needs, and that all unhappiness comes not from lack, but from superfluity.""

Im not sure. This time next week, I may have figured it all out.

5721960,2,B00CG6IUR6,"Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental and cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the DVD produced by Strand Releasing.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

First let me say that my two star rating has nothing to do with the technical qualities of the film or of the filmmakers.  The production behind the film is excellent, and the visuals are often beautiful - this is not a film that was poorly put together, or made for exploitation or entertainment purposes so much as it is personal vision from the director.  In this way it reminds me slightly of Alejandro Jodorowsky's films, or of Herzog's early, early efforts, or even of David Lynch's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eraserhead/dp/B00A5IXYR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eraserhead</a>, in that these films resist easy interpretation and are better suited to reach the viewer as an 'experience' (perhaps even a transcendental one) rather than as a coherent storyline.  My two star rating reflects the fact that, films as tenuous and surreal as these often fail to have much of an impact on me in any discernible way.  POST TENBRAS LUX actually put me to sleep more than once, no matter how hard I tried to fight it.

But the blurbs for this film give little warning - I get that this is a difficult film to describe, but the only prep I read for the film was a two sentence description of an upscale Mexican family who move to the countryside but whose idyllic surroundings ""belie a disturbing existence where violence and suffering are commonplace and light and darkness struggle to eliminate one another.""  That could mean anything, I suppose, but the words 'demanding', difficult', or 'non-linear' (or some variation thereof) would have been a great help.  Chances are I would still have watched the film - I often do tackle films out of the mainstream, even though my track record with them is iffy; occasionally I stumble onto something so outlandish and bizarre, it leaves an imprint despite its relative incoherence.  Unfortunately, aside from its lush visuals of the Mexican countryside, POST TENEBRAS LUX did not.

Any 'story' that the audience gleans from the film will need to be picked up by inference only - no backstory is provided, the film cuts to different time periods without clueing in the viewer, and dreams, visions, and supernatural elements appear within linear events with no explanation.  If you detest the obviousness of most filmmaking techniques, then POST TENEBRAS LUX may provide the alternative kind of film you are looking for - I believe it simply goes too far in its refusal to bridge the gap between the audience and the screen.  In fact, I'm inclined to see it as self-indulgent, and the director unconcerned with whether or not he communicated with the audience at all.

The film begins with what appears to be a toddler's dream, a young girl wandering through a muddy, rain-soaked field while a pack of farm dogs lope about, nipping at a herd of cows.  This long sequence of imagery may very well be a good indicator of who will enjoy the film and who will not - for the first few minutes, I was open to it, but as it seemed to go on and on, I could feel my interest level slipping away.  While the very next scene certainly woke me out of my reverie (and I won't spoil it), the rest of film continued to see-saw between moments that captured my attention and those which simply dragged.

Viewers who appreciate raw and challenging films, films that are often dismissed as 'art-house', should probably make an effort to see POST TENEBRAS LUX - there will doubtlessly be legitimate fans of it.  But, although I've seen many films that defy straightforward analysis, I do enjoy the ones that leave a lingering, visceral image in my mind.  That, I think, is the greatest failing of POST TENEBRAS LUX - it uses an odd and disjointed structure to deliver its themes, but rather than maximizing the effects, only manages to strike a rather glancing blow.",1393372800,3,4048,4.883211678832117

8581525,5,B00CG6IUR6,"""Post Tenebras Lux"" is an almost surreal visual masterpiece, laden with rich imagery and depicting a visual, familial and cultural allegory of life in rural Mexico. The film is shot in many parts with a selective-focus, which I can only interpret as an attempt to recreate what the eye actually sees, or perhaps what the mind's eye sees, when recalling a memory. The film examines a sharp class war, where even with the best intentions, strife and despair lurk in every corner. It is also about trust, desire, love and nature; both human nature and natural beauty. It is a film about how we seek to exploit our desires in unusual places and celebrate life in its never-ending circle of birth, existence, love, betrayal, death and redemption. ""Post Tenebras Lux"" is non-linear in form, yet rich in style to the point where we can almost smell the rain-forest and experience life there with its natural beauty and integral sounds. This is not a film for people who lack artistic vision and have little sense of aesthetics, but if you do appreciate an artistic rendering of other cultures and sentiments, it is a treat for the eyes, ears and mind.
