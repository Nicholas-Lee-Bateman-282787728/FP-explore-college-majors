8591080,5,B00DAG1ZUU,"There are two audio tracks on this blu ray. the first is in german - this is a German product released for a German audience who speak GERMAN. Now if you use the language select option on your REMOTE CONTROL (hint hint to above reviewer) you can choose ENGLISh HD Master Audio 5.1  This blu ray, by the way, is region free, making it a more reasonable alternative to the $100 you can expect to pay for the Japanese release (Japan uses the same signal as us, making their DVDs, blu rays and even jolly old VHS region compatible).  Now, to address the misunderstanding made by the other reviewer who gave this wonderful release one star - anything that says DER FILM usually means it's a film, Der Film being German for, guess what? On on, take a really wild guess? Still not got it? Okay, I'll tell you: The Film.  hence, Twin peaks Der Film means Twin peaks The Film, Not Twin Peaks The TV Series. Oh, and this is not the TV film, my poor confused friend. This is FIRE WALK WITH ME - the film, or Der Film of Twin Peaks. Now, if it's the TV movie you want, you should buy the series, as it's included there. This is far far too scary for television - that's why it was released in theaters back in the day, not on television. All clear now? So this is Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me on a region free blu ray from those nice people over in germany, completely uncut with English Audio in 1080p 16 x 9 widescreen with a run time of 1.35 minutes. And with no region A blu ray on the horizon, a steal at 32 bucks plus shipping.",1401062400,11,1522,4.170068027210885
8591081,1,B00DAG1ZUU,"I bought this Blueray thinking it was for the TV series whereas it actually is for the ""made for TV"" movie produced years later.  The product description is very deceptive in that respect.  There's no indication it's a movie - no mention of that movie's name (""Fire Walk With Me"").  Furthermore there is a link to this Blueray from the DVD for the TV series (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UX6THK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  Of course, they may remove the link after they read this review.

When I tried to get a simple refund from the seller, they gave me a whole song and dance.  There's no way to get a refund from this seller.  So I forgot about them and simply went through MasterCard to get the refund.  Avoid this vendor!",1395273600,2,750,4.991935483870968
8591082,1,B00DAG1ZUU,"This item is in German. There was nothing easily visible that indicated that it was in anything other than English.
The packaging does not indicate what to do to return it.",1389571200,3,172,4.580645161290323
