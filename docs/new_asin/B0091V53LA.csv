8534448,5,B0091V53LA,"Probably the best putting resource you can find - but only if you like going straight back and straight through......or you are open to changing your arced putting stroke.  Not that Geoff says it has to be exactly straight but certainly not a deeply arced stroke.  I've done some training here in the UK with the only guy who made the trip to learn directly from Geoff - John Eyre up in Huddersfield - you have to like your golf to do the 6 hours of driving the car that trip took!  Here on this DVD is Geoff doing his thing - nerdy - but nice.  Geoff has obsessed over putting for twenty years so you get an awful lot of information and facts (rather than nostrums and myths) - and you get Geoff's thoughts on what's right and wrong.  Now there is a bit of wiggle room with Geoff's methodology - but you really can only learn that from a teacher - I'm not going out on a limb here and now and suggest what's fixed, what's good to have, and what's a suggestion.  That's for you to work out - wtach the DVD, go to a trained pro in Geoff's techniques.

 It's not another version of Stockton, Uttley, Mickleson, or whoever; it's Geoff Mangum talking about what Geoff believes.

Get yourself a 24"" steel ruler, a putting mirror, some string and a couple of tent pegs to hold the string, and a DIY $2 spirit level - those are the only tools you'll need.  Geoff's approach is all about the work, not clever golf-branded gizmos - $25 max should do it for that list I gave you (and that's including a proper golf mirror!).  Watch, learn, go do!",1493424000,,1536,4.2620689655172415
8534449,5,B0091V53LA,Undoubtedly the most valuable putting resource I have ever used.  Complete theory and how to apply it.  Even more valuable when used together with Geoff's web site and You Tube videos.,1483228800,,184,4.903225806451613
8534450,5,B0091V53LA,Highly recommended,1468713600,,18,8.5
8534451,5,B0091V53LA,"The best DVD you will find on putting. Very, Very good. Exactly what I wanted.",1438646400,,78,4.266666666666667
8534452,4,B0091V53LA,good video on how to read greens,1409443200,,32,3.7142857142857144
8534453,3,B0091V53LA,He is very long winded. The DVD could easily be shortened to maybe 30 minutes. If you get through a bunch of the fluff there are some good nuggets in there. In other words I wise it was a bit more scripted and got quickly to the points.,1409011200,,236,3.9375
8534454,5,B0091V53LA,Finally I have a method to help me read greens. I refer to it all the time. Really helps on those putts where you can't figure out the break. I  three putt much less and lags have greatly improved.,1372032000,,197,4.051282051282051
8534455,5,B0091V53LA,This putting video is over two hours long. It is fabulous and covers most anything you can think about putting. The PuttingZone is great as well.,1360454400,,145,4.615384615384615
