2243358,5,B0007TKOU0,"I bought the ""Learn to Play Acoustic Beginner"" by House of Blues along with the Guitar World Acoustic Rock DVD; do yourself and your wallet a favor and just get the former. In fact, it may be the best one I have. There is a small book showing you the tabs, strumming patterns, and how to follow along. It also includes links to download a tuner, metronome, and background tracks to practice along to. If you have an acoustic and are teaching yourself, this is the one to get for chords.

The instructor is easy to follow, unlike others where you end up trying to play catch-up.  A note for beginners, when you are shown the chords, sit down and practice for 10-15 minutes before trying to play along.  That's the way this is intended to work.  And if you have a steel string acoustic guitar, you will need to practice a couple of weeks (two to four) before your fingers can handle the pain of learning acoustic.",1241049600,29,911,4.404761904761905
2243359,5,B0007TKOU0,"I've been trying to learn on and off for a few months now and I would say this was a great place to begin looking. This DVD was very helpful and it goes along with a booklet you receive which makes tremendously easy to follow. You learn a lot of basic aspects of guitar playing (rhythm, strumming, finger picking etc.) You can certainly play a few songs by the end of this DVD.

You should try it at your own pace and refer back to the DVD for guidance. I'd recommend it!",1213488000,12,471,4.119565217391305
2243360,5,B0007TKOU0,"There are lots of self-teaching DVD's out there, but this one is really great and easy to follow along.",1210204800,4,103,4.473684210526316
2243361,4,B0007TKOU0,"Although I just started playing (about 6 months ago ), this was (is) very helpfull. What you see on the Dvd is also in the booklet. I suggest to start with this one.",1206662400,10,165,4.03030303030303
2243362,2,B0007TKOU0,"I was looking for an instructional DVD that showed me how to play the guitar with step by step illustration for chords, finger picking, etc., but it didn't have any of that.  I also tried to access the online help and it was not available.",1206403200,19,239,4.311111111111111

2243364,5,B0007TKOU0,This DVD is well worth the purchase if you want to learn how to play the guitar. It has easy to follow instructions.,1181520000,14,116,4.086956521739131
2243365,5,B0007TKOU0,"The greatest thing about this dvd is that the teacher, teaches you how to play modern styles.  I haven't checked out many beginner acoustic dvds, but i have looked threw many beginner guitar books.  I think these modern ideas are much better than playing ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" and ""Old Mc Donald"".  With added booklet and online refrences you can advance more.  Although you may want to get a few others books a dvd is important too I think.  Well worth the money!",1163289600,61,467,4.511904761904762
2243366,5,B0007TKOU0,"The DVD is beyond my expectations. Really excellent for beginning Acoustic guitars (From Scratch that is)

The instructor is very impressive and cool. One day I'll be better than him... I hope so",1152748800,37,195,4.909090909090909
2243367,5,B0007TKOU0,"THIS IS THE BEST TEACHING DVD ON THE MARKET, THAT WE HAVE FOUND YET! WE HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS FROM DAY ONE .

2243388,5,B0007TKOU0,I really like this program! With more discipline I might actually be good again! LOL,1433203200,,84,4.666666666666667
2243389,5,B0007TKOU0,"As a first time player I wanted a guide that would help me lay a good foundation this book is it. And it is fun! John starts with a very easy chord change, but quickly escalates into a variety of major chords and finger exercise and my favorite the blues riff in the early lessons. However, as someone else has noted here, you don't just merrily go through lesson by lesson and learn guitar. Between each concise progressive lesson there needs to be some significant practice. But I got exactly what I was looking for as a first time beginner.",1431648000,3,543,4.44

2243392,5,B0007TKOU0,Love it!,1419379200,,8,3.5
2243393,5,B0007TKOU0,Finally a DVD that teaches beginners to play the guitar with songs that will hold their interest and not make them feel like they are in nursery school!  This is perfect for teens or adults that want to learn to play the guitar.  The price of this DVD is less than the price of one half hour lesson... and you can go back and review what you are learning as many times as you want whenever you want!  Great idea - and great product!,1418342400,,432,4.119047619047619

2243396,5,B0007TKOU0,"I love this DVD, it's very, very good about showing close ups of all the aspects of playing a guitar. I would recommend it to all aspiring guitarist.",1396137600,,149,4.357142857142857
2243397,4,B0007TKOU0,Very good and exciting but goes alittle fast for a true beginner like me.  I need to learn alittle more before I can enjoy this.,1395446400,,128,4.12
2243408,4,B0007TKOU0,"I bought this for my 10 year old nephew, who is trying to learn on his own with no teacher.  Although the DVD does a pretty good job, an accompanying chord book would have been even better, so that he could see more clearly the strings, fret positions and fingers to be used for each chord, and study at his own pace.",1394409600,,317,4.112903225806452
2243409,4,B0007TKOU0,"Is a great tape but I've had to learn a few things about guitar before using it.  It is my example of where I want to go to.
Very exciting and sets my goals!",1392163200,,157,3.6176470588235294
2243410,1,B0007TKOU0,"My Main reason for order this DVD was for the 28 page Lesson Book,  I order this product twice and both time it came without the book, I was very upset that I had too return item and re-order so I can  get the book,  I send an emal too the company that sold the DVD but they had not respond.  DVD might be okay but to learn how to play the Blues on a guitar is more easy by book where I can see/read what too do,  I VERY DISAPPOINTED that the package didn't have this lesson book,  (I not going to re-order again,  to much time spent too ship/back and to make sure I get credit refund back too my credit card account)",1386979200,2,617,3.888
2243411,2,B0007TKOU0,I bought this product for my dad for christmas. He enjoys blues music and is beginning to play the guitar. The description CLEARLY states that it comes with a 29 page booklet. All I got was the DVD. I want to send it back but I do not have the time since christmas is right around the corner and this is one of two gifts I have for him. I have not played the DVD so who knows it if even works....What a piss poor company to advertise something and not include it. They must not want any customers ever again. DO NOT BUY!!!,1355961600,4,522,4.028846153846154
2243412,4,B0007TKOU0,"Good for beginners! Just make sure you take your time practicing each part away from the lessons, you have to set aside time to actually learn!",1354838400,2,143,4.538461538461538
2243413,5,B0007TKOU0,"I just received this DVD in the mail today and was very excited to get started. My daughter and I grabbed our guitars and turned it on. First thing I wanted to note though - I expected a booklet to go along with it. I was confused searching the box for a book but nothing. Further turning on the dvd I found out that the booklet is a printable book. You have to open this on your computer, go into the dvd and extract it in an adobe reader and print it out if you want to. It was easy enough and I had just bought ink so I was ok with that. You can also just read it on your computer but I am one who likes printed out things.

So the DVD is very nice. So far I am only on the beginning lessons because he told me to practice the first two chords and that is what I am going to do. Stop here and practice them. I was VERY pleased with the ease and careful way he explained things in the first lessons. Parts of the guitar, reading a chord chart, how to hold the guitar, pick, How to tune it, How to play the two chords and exactly how to put your fingers. Basic, slow and so far very encouraging that I might indeed be able to learn this stuff.

I would recommend this dvd.",1330041600,4,1173,3.8833333333333333
2243414,1,B0007TKOU0,"When I order this DVD it said it came with a book, I never got a book. For starters the DVD has very little info and is way to fast paced for beginners. I do NOT recommend this to anyone. It was nothing more then a waste of money!",1324252800,3,230,3.7142857142857144
2243415,5,B0007TKOU0,Wanted so badly to learn the guitar but my arthritis kept me from learning.... so I got rid of all of the materials I purchased to learn. I DID watch the dvd though and it was VERY informative and seemed to be a great learning tool.,1284076800,,232,4.065217391304348
2243416,5,B0007TKOU0,"I first watched this DVD after renting it from the library, and I absolutely loved it. The lessons are easy to understand and presented in a way that keeps your interested. I'm more of a visual guy and I learn better from people than books. I've had countless beginner books on how to play guitar, but I never stuck with them since they couldn't keep my interest and felt too ""slow"" for my learning style. While this DVD is not a magic pill fast track that will make you better overnight, it will keep your interest and make you feel like you're actually making progress with your playing.

I've been playing guitar for a couple of years, but I've been self taught; I didn't know much more than basic chords. Even though I watched the DVD with at least some experience, I still found it very helpful. I also like that it's not entirely restricted to just acoustic guitar: I played an electric guitar at the time and still found it helpful. And now I have an acoustic, which makes it sound even better.

So if you're a beginner and want to learn how to play, or someone who's strummed Green Day's ""Time of Your Life"" thousands of times over but never went farther beyond, I highly recommend this DVD. I plan on buying the beginner's electric guitar DVD made by the same guy, since I loved his lessons here so much.",1263772800,11,1313,4.421487603305785
2243417,4,B0007TKOU0,"Fairly easy to follow and great instructors. This makes learning the guitar ""cool"" by learning in your own home and a heck of a lot cheaper too than taking lessons!",1252195200,4,164,4.5
8051598,1,B0007TKOU0,"Just received my order, and as in the previous review, no booklet. Definitely not as advertised. If it weren't so cheap I'd return it, but I definitely would not wasting your money buying this product. I very seriously question the integrity of this seller not receiving what was advertised. Doesn't even a single star. Buyer beware!!!!",1515110400,,336,5.017857142857143

8051601,5,B0007TKOU0,"Hi!  John makes learning easy.

Learning to play Acoustic guitar.  Lots to learn for sure!  Purchased ""Play Guitar in 10 Easy Lessons"" by Jon Buck.  The book covers so many details but some things just didn't ""click"".  Seeing John McCarthy, in this DVD, explain everything in great detail is what was needed to make everything ""click"".  Plus you don't get tired of him as you play sections over and over until you can ""get it""!  Making progress every day!

Also, ""Steven Adler's Getting Started on Rock Drumming"" DVD explains counting very well, in my opinion.",1490140800,,560,4.810526315789474
