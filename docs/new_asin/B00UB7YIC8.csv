8705143,4,B00UB7YIC8,"This tells part of the story of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force and their involvement in World War II. A mine sweeping unit are up in the snowy mountains of Italy when they think they are under attack from the Germans, and most of the unit do a runner. The few that remain decide that they will take out a mined road that has stalled the American advance. Along the way they encounter an Italian who has deserted and then a German who is `keine Nazi'and they unite in their fight in what at first seems like an unholy alliance.

This is not an action fest but there is some action, it is more of a psychological study as the narrator recounts what he will write to his father and how he feels, this involves acknowledgment of cowardice as well as the uncertainty that war brings. The materiel all looks good too and I did not spot any CGI, the acting is all solid and the setting and locations look authentic too - being filmed in Italy.

The cover art is as ever very misleading as I did not see any planes in this, there are some tanks, but as stated earlier this is far from being an actioner. Original title is `A Estrada 47', which is the name of the mined road they go out to tackle, and it is in Portuguese, German and Italian with good sub titles. All in all a very watchable and well thought out war film that I find easy to recommend.",1446249600,3,1346,4.233463035019455
