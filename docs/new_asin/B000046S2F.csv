1338561,5,B000046S2F,"This eighth installment in the Twilight Zone DVD collection is all about To Serve Man, as far as I'm concerned.  That is the episode that I most remember from when I watched this series as a kid (not in the sixties, I saw the repeats and the annual marathon on the Sci-Fi Channel).  I remember that those tall aliens scared the cr*p out of me!  I used to ""see"" them in my room while lying in bed at night (which sucked if I had to go to the bathroom, seeing as I was too scared to move).  And yet, this was always my favorite episode.  The plot is just so cool!  Aliens come to Earth to ""help"" humans, they teach us to efficient ways to farm and things like that.  They even take some of us back to their home planet (as dinner guests perhaps?-ha ha).  A couple of U.S. code breakers get a hold of one of the aliens' books and try to crack the code.  They figure out the title ""To Serve Man"" (which they naturally assume means to help man, since that's what the aliens appear to be doing), but can't figure out the rest.  Until one of them decides to go on one of the many trips to the aliens' home planet.  Just as he's getting on the spaceship, his partner figures out the meaning of the book...  God!  Now that is television!
Oh yeah, the rest of the episodes are great(as Twilight Zones episodes all tend to be).  ""Shelter"" is another one that I can remember watching as a kid.  It's about this family who obviously has a bomb shelter, and when a UFO invasion seems eminent, the whole neighborhood is fighting to get in.  (This was also spoofed by the Simpson's.)  The other two are also very good and definitely deserve a place in this collection, but aren't ""classics"".
The DVD is great, too.  The picture is of course great, but it also has a cool extra.  It has commentary on each season, information on the brilliant Rod Serling, and reviews of each episode.
If you like these Twilight Zone collections, I suggest that you also get the movie Requiem for a Heavyweight.  It was written by Rod Serling and stars TZ regular Jack Klugman and Jackie Gleason, and is about a washed up boxer.",1012867200,6,2094,4.30690537084399
1338562,5,B000046S2F,"Aliens abound but appearance can be deceiving, as we learn in the two of the episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" on Volume 8 in this DVD series.  The other two visits both have to do with the end of the world as we know it.  Three of the episodes found here are well above average and one of those is an outright classic (although I do not think it is the best episode of the four), which is good enough to make this one of the better volumes in this 40-plus volume set of DVDs collecting all of Rod Serling's classic television anthology series:

Episode 14, ""Third From the Sun"" (Adapted by Rod Serling from Richard Matheson's short story, First aired January 8, 1960), tells of scientist William Sturka (Fritz Weaver), who is convinced the world is about to end in a nuclear war. Along with test pilot Jerry Riden (Joe Maross), they escape with their families in a stolen experimental spaceship to a new planet.  This is a rather pedestrian episode, where you have to get to the twist at the end to realize you are in the ""Zone.""  In the familiar face department this one has Edward Andrews as Carling, a government type who tries to keep the characters from stealing the rocket ship.

Episode 89, ""To Serve Man (Adapted by Rod Serling from Damon Knight's short story, First aired March 2, 1962), is one of the most famous ""Zone"" episodes with its ""Soylent Green"" ending (although it predates that Charlton Heston film by a decade). A Kanamit (Richard Kiel) has come to earth to create a golden age with the advanced technology of his race. Michael Chambers (Lloyd Bochner), a government decoding expert, learns to learn the true meaning of the title of the book left by the Kanamit.  Is it just me or getting to a second edition of ""To Serve Man"" going to prove to be impossible once the cat is out of the bag?  Just wondering.

Episode 90, ""The Fugitive"" (Written by Charles Beaumont, First aired March 9, 1962), features J. Pat O'Malley as Old Ben, an alien who befriends a lovely little girl named Jenny (Susan Gordon).  As the opening narration of the episode points out, this one combines science fiction and fantasy.  Old Ben has the ability to turn into anything from a mouse to a monster, which comes in handy since he is being pursued by a pair of men.  But Jenny wears a leg brace and Ben wants to do something about that before he leaves the little girl who does not want to be left behind.

Episode 68, ""The Shelter"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired September 29, 1961), is my favorite and the best episode on the disc.  This is one of Serling's ""preachy"" scripts where he hits the mark perfectly. The neighborhood is gathering for a surprise party for Doc Stockton (Larry Gates), when the radio announces radar has detected what appears to be incoming missiles. Doc, his wife and young son go to the shelter he has built in his basement. His unprepared neighbors beg to be let it, but there is not enough room or supplies. That is when things get ugly. Some people consider ""The Shelter"" to be melodramatic, but I always found it rather chilling since it suggests that civilization will end before the bombs actually go off.",990489600,20,3141,4.536283185840708
1338593,5,B000046S2F,"Having just read Exo-Vaticana, the episode ""To Serve Man"" makes Rod Serling seem almost prophetic. As the Chinese curse states, 'May you live in interesting times.'",1377561600,,164,5.346153846153846
1338594,5,B000046S2F,"I loved these old shows. They show the naivete of the fifties and sixties, and a view of a future that will never be. I have heard many people make fun of the so-called special effects, but that is just the technology. Some of the acting is outstanding and the plots are just as timely today.",1372291200,,292,4.232142857142857
1338595,5,B000046S2F,"There's only a few volumes...2 and 11 being the others, that every episode I consider to be first rate or even classic. Vol. 8 is such. To Serve Man is one of the epic episodes, Third from the Sun is very well written and filmed in the noir style that was popular a few years earlier. The dialogue really makes it so great. The Shelter is above average. And The Fugitive is a neat little tale. I especially love it because I have a 9 year old daughter and The Fugitive is sorta like Twilight Zone meets Nickelodeon. Still true to the Twilight Zone twists, but totally appropriate to any age. The ending is one of my favorites.",1298851200,,626,4.313559322033898
1338596,5,B000046S2F,"One of the best CDs of the old, ""Twilight Zone,"" episodes. Survival fans should be especially interested in one episode titled,""The Shelter.""
See how so-called friends and neighboors try to raid a single-family bomb shelter. What they would not do to get inside. Even kill. The others episodes on this CD are great too!",1244246400,,319,4.925925925925926
1338597,5,B000046S2F,"Susan Gordon got sick on the set of ""The Fugitive"" and they had to film the remaining footage for this episode, the opening ballpark scenes, a week later under a separate production number and with a diffrent (uncredited) director. ""To Serve Man"" was filmed twice and then the best footage from both films blended together to fit the episode we see now. That is why the flashback scenes and tons of stock footage ripped off from three separate films. ""Third From the Sun"" is one of the most creative films produced in the first season. The painting hanging above the phone after the opening scenes was hanging on the wall in ""A World fo Difference"" and ""The Four of Us Are Dying."" The car, not being the planet Earth, features jet engines and is a custom made by George Barris, originally conceived for THE TIME MACHINE.

Trivia above supplied not from the DVD, but from the book, ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun. Both are available on Amazon.",1222214400,,1188,4.6571428571428575
1338598,4,B000046S2F,"This is a beautiful compilation. This is back when rod stirling was in charge, i.e. the best time. This is the top of the top when it comes to science fiction, and proud to own it.

Now for the bad stuff,

The intro menu stinks. That eye that blinks and points to choices is a nice touch, but is unresponsive at times. Though the theme is good, it gets fairly annoying after a while, also that sound the eye makes when it choses something DUNNNNNAAANNNNN sound, is really really irritating.

Plus it being in black and white, and not really noticeably polished, i'd have hoped for more episodes shoved onto a dvd.

but still this is worth the money to get.",1182816000,,656,4.396694214876033
1338599,5,B000046S2F,Rod Serling was amazing! I can't think of a Twilight Zone that wasn't worth watching.,1129507200,2,85,4.733333333333333
1338600,5,B000046S2F,"Twilight Zone is one of those productions that is quite literally timeless. Although there were numerous not-so-good episodes in the series, Volume 8 contains four pretty good episodes, including my favorite, the superb ""Third from the Sun.""

""Third from the Sun"" is a mindblower, even if it is somewhat dated by its notion that there are other planets within the solar system that can support intelligent life.  This is excellent science fiction (no spoilers here) and this episode is guaranteed to make a memorable impression if you have never seen it.  This one, in fact, happens to be my favorite Zone episode ever, although opinions may differ.

The other three episodes are quite good, some serious and some not.  ""The Shelter"" is a real classic.  ""To Serve Man"" is funny with a touch of scariness.  ""The Fugitive"" is quite watchable and a little on the cute side.

The DVD is a fine value, and I have repeatedly enjoyed watching these episodes.",1114992000,13,951,4.863354037267081
1338601,5,B000046S2F,"Volume 8 of the twilight zone dvd series is one of the best. Four great episodes, cool special features, and it's not that expensive. Let's start with Third From the Sun. William Sturka, played by Fritz Weaver, is a scientist. A fellow scientist, Carling,  tells him that th large nucular war that is about to happen will happen in 48 hours. So, William and a friend get ther familes steal a spacecraft and fly into space. A nice twist of an ending but I shouldn't tell you it. Next, The Shelter. When it seems there is going to be a alien invasion a neighborhood of friends get crazy over one family's bomb shelter. Next, To Serve Man. This is one of the Twilight Zone shows that are great, chilling, and have a shocking twist at the end. It all starts with aliens landing on earth. One of the aliens, played by my faviorite actor Richard Kiel tells everyone thre purpose on earth is to serve man. The twist comes when they find out that they misinterpretated the phrase to serve man. Finally, The Fugitive. This one is very awesome but very confusing and you have to see it for your self. ...",1021939200,5,1094,4.415841584158416

7919699,5,B000046S2F,"I purchased volume eight in 2007 specifically for the episode ""to serve Man."" I remember seeing this as a rerun in the early 70s and practically running to my mother to explain the episode to her and how it had upset me (in a science-fiction manner). My mom laughed at my distress. Needless to say this must have been memorable if I could remember the title of the episode and ordered this specific volume. The other stories are equally phenomenal as they bring social issues to mind and how we are constantly evolving. I know you will enjoy this volume so don't hesitate to get it soon. Enjoy!",1422576000,,594,4.5092592592592595

7919701,4,B000046S2F,"With volume 8 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series you get some of the best stories the Show at to offer. A couple of them could be considered classic but all the stories are first rate in this edition.

First up on the disc is ""Third From the Sun"". A scientist and a test pilot, played by Fritz Weaver and Joe Maross, are convinced the world is about to end from nuclear war. They make plans for them and their families to steal an experimental spaceship the two of them had been working on and head to a distant planet and start life over there. Problem is there is a government agent, played by Edward Andrews, keeping a close eye on them convinced they are up to something. What will happen...?

""To Serve Man"" is rightly classified as one of the true classics from the ""Twilight Zone"".  Earth is visited by a Kanamit, played by Richard Kiel, who tells a gathering of government officials from around the world that the Kanamits are here to help mankind. They show man better ways to grow food and help create world peace making war a thing of the past. They also give a book to Earth but it is written in their language. U.S. agents lead by Lloyd Bochner are trying to figure out the language to know what the book says. Wonder what it says?

""The Fugitive"" stars J Pat O'Malley as an alien on earth known to everyone as Old Ben. Old Ben is a favorite with the kids in the neighborhood because he can change himself into anything. So why is he on Earth? Well there are a couple of aliens looking for him so he is hiding out on Earth. But like the old saying goes ""you can run but you can't hide"" becomes true for Old Ben. But he doesn't want to leave until he helps his friend Jenny who has a bad leg. What can he do?

Last on the DVD is ""The Shelter"". First shown in 1961 this was definitely an episode that was a produce of its time when the cold war was boiling and many Americans were building bomb shelters to run to if nuclear war ever broke out. Doc Stockton is one of those people who built a bomb shelter for his family. Then one night with neighbors over to celebrate Stockton's birthday, played by Larry Gates, when the radio broadcasts that missiles have been spotted on the radar. Everyone panics except for Doc Stockton. He takes his family down to the shelter where they will be safe. All the neighbors at the party wants to go in with him but there is a problem. There is only enough room in the shelter for the Doc and his wife and child. Becoming upset that Stockton won't let them in before you know it all these neighbors who are such close friends turn on each other as they are trying to break down the door to the shelter Doc Stockton and his family are in. Then another radio announcement brings everything to a halt and fear is replaced with reality. And what of the Neighbors?

If you have been collecting volumes rom the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series this is one to consider getting. I would rate this volume one of the best in the series.",1403222400,,2965,4.276292335115865
7919702,5,B000046S2F,"""Third from the Sun"" written by Rod Serling and directed by Richard Bare and with Fritz Weaver, Joe Maross, Edward Andrews, Denise Alexander, Lori March is very suspenseful as two families plot and plan to leave the planet via spaceship to escape an apocalyptic war.

""To Serve Man"" written by Rod Serling and very well directed by Richard Bare with Lloyd Bochner and Richard Kiel is a nightmarish tale of alien visitors with a horrific conclusion. This is one of the best episodes of the entire series.

""The Shelter"" written by Rod Serling and directed by Lamount Johnson with Larry Gates, Peggy Stewart, Michael Burne and  Jack Albertson is a study in human nature where neighbor will turn against friend and neighbor in a selfish frenzy for survival. Animal instincts are a curious thing when a bomb shelter designed for only one family may be the only hope for survival. Again, this is one of the best episodes of the entire series.

""The Fugitive"" written by Charles Beaumont and directed by Richard L. Bare featuring J. Pat O'Malley, Susan Gordon, Nancy Kulp, Wesley Lau, Paul Tripp, Stephen Talbot, Johnny Eiman, Russ Bender is a tender story of an alien fugitive named Old Ben who comes to the planet to help a crippled little girl. This is writer Charles Beaumont's kind of story. It is a good one.",1379116800,,1308,4.748898678414097
