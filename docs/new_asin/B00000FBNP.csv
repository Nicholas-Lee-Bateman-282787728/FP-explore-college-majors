7908045,5,B00000FBNP,A first class science documentary ...a great presentation of the wonders of our universe and the brilliant physicists and astronomers that have enabled a better understanding of it.,1424563200,,181,5.5
7908046,5,B00000FBNP,"I wish I could find this on DVD for under $20 though, but it's probably the best intro-to-modern-science documentary ever made. I've seen Cosmos and many of the other science shows on Discovery, History Channel, H2 and others but this one that first aired on PBS back in the 90's has them all beat. It's part of a larger set of 2-hrs documentaries that are just brilliant and not too watered down and not way too ""laymen"" terms were the analogies begins to obscure the truth.

I Love This Series!",1405382400,,496,4.511111111111111
7908047,5,B00000FBNP,"This is one of the best physics /  cosmology films I have ever seen. I would recommend this to any lay person who is interested in these fields. The narrator and the experts are excellent at keeping up the tempo and explaining the science. Additionally, the order in which the topics are discussed is brilliant. The discussion of Heisenberg Uncertainty is particularly excellent (an often poorly covered topic).",1195084800,5,411,5.044117647058823
7908048,5,B00000FBNP,"This two part program chronicles the quest to unify the particles and forces in physics, and the quest to understand the origin and fate of the universe.

The physics part showed that quarks were introduced to make sense of the myriads of fundamental particles observed in particle collisions, and that string theory with its advanced mathematics may one day unite all the forces of nature.

The astronomy part revolved around the big bang theory and showed how the universe started from a single point. Although I'm not with or against this theory, I'm still keeping an open mind to all possibilities, check (UNIVERSE-The Cosmology Quest) for an alternative discussion.",1151539200,14,670,5.137614678899083
