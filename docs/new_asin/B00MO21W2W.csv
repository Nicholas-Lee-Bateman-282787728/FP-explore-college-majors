6590707,3,B00MO21W2W,"Well oh Dear when Asylum makes a war movie you know half of it will be fake and horribly CGI - and it is! Film is opening with one US tank destroyer in far too close combat with a Russian T-34? - and yes you heard me. but that is still better than all the fake and very poorly CGI tanks they surround it with, But I will be nice and ignore the all the facts of WW2 and try to buy into it the story, ignoring the bad acting, stereotypical story line and the complete lack of WW2 knowledge on behalf of those who wrote this film. Obviously they wanted to make a film to jump on Brad Pitts wagon with Fury too bad they did not have anybody there who knows anything about war and military tactics then they could at least have made a good action film. But all the fake gun fire kills that dead. (I know I said I would be nice and I am)
One small highlight that makes it somewhat watchable is the bad guy the German SS Major (played by Tino Struckmann) he actually does a really good job acting, sadly he is drowned out by all the poor acting and over acting by everybody else. It seems he was the only real actor they could afford and surrounded him with extras just to fill the uniforms (and dress). The lead Americans were over acting to the point one would think they were trying to act out every GI clich ever seen, not to mention the lead lady horribly acting never found her character she could not even do her Portuguese accent (yes once again you heard me that is what she is playing, knowing she could just have gone home to neutral Portugal is one of the silly things that makes us smile) They did have a few tanks and a half track too bad they did not use it right, some of the shots were ok some of the editing so so but it always comes back to poor storytelling, bad writing by somebody who know nothing of this topic and too much bad CGI
So the advice here have a few drinks and have a shot when the same repeat words are used or at the silly things, the wrong way to hold a gun and the laughable CGI and be entertained by that, its a movie its supposed to entertaining, so laugh at its dumb side  you will be wasted at the end but had some good laugh",1413936000,25,2161,4.025581395348837
6590708,4,B00MO21W2W,"I'm a war movie buff and this one did not disappoint me. I hate spoilers, so I won't give away the plot, but there is a nice twist at the end (along with a great fight scene). I thought the cinematography was excellent and the and the soundtrack meshed perfectly with each scene. Tom Stedham gives a gritty performance as Sergeant Duncan and Tino Struckmann's portrayal of Major Zeller was excellent. Watch for these rising stars. I thought the rest of the cast was absolutely solid. Yes, there were parts that were computer enhanced. This isn't 1960 anymore. The days of warehouses full of WW2 military surplus sitting around are long gone. We were spoiled by the old war movies, due in a large part to the stockpiles of heavy artillery and big budgets the filmmakers had at their disposal. I read an earlier review where someone (evidently quite knowledgeable of the weapons of the era) ripped this independent film company for not being authentic enough. I thought that was sad, but its just a sign of the times. Everyone's a critic and no one takes into account how difficult it is to compete with the big boys. Makes you wonder what ever happened to the Golden Rule. I love independent films and I will continue to support them.",1413763200,12,1233,4.634703196347032
6590709,1,B00MO21W2W,"That little voice in the back of my head was screaming ""NOOOO"" when I picked this up. I didn't listen. Should have. The front cover says that this movie is based on true events. Well, WWII was a true event. I'm not sure what other event about this was true, except that it was a complete waste of money. The back cover says this is set during the Battle of the Bulge. A little hint to the movie makers: the Battle of the Bulge was fought in WINTER! Of course, making the movie in summer is more comfortable for the actors I suppose. The acting was bad to mediocre. The German accents were, well, I'm not sure what they were. The dialogue must have come from comic books. At almost every turn there was a firefight. There were lots of tanks, almost all computer generated as were the tank guns firing and the explosions. The one real American ""tank"" is an M36 tank destroyer. They were apparently afraid of getting it dirty. It mostly sat still although it did drive really slow down a forest track briefly. Images of the M36 maneuvering were computer generated. Apparently, they used the real thing for crew close ups only,. When the M36 runs out of gas, they come under attack by German infantry. For some reason, they don't use the M36's weapons until after they refill the gas tank. I'm not sure what the gas tank has to do with its weapons. Eventually most of the Americans take off to save children leaving 3 men with the M36, one of whom gets captured and tortured to death. When the computer Tiger tanks attack, there are only two men on the M36 (another hint to the movie makers: Tiger I's were irrelevant during the Bulge). During the fight, one man loads the gun while the other stands in the turret leaning on the gun breach while he yells fire. 1. I'm not sure who was doing the firing as there was no third man to sit in the gunner's seat. 2. Leaning on the gun's breach while firing--how stupid are these people!? As for the German tanks, the only real tank wasn't even German. They didn't even make an effort to create a mock up. It was a Russian T-34. They did have a German Hetzer tank destroyer that was shown briefly but parked. The beginning scene is a computer generated tank battle that is just silly. The afore mentioned M36's crew dismounts to pick up German hand grenades with which to knock out the ""German"" T-34 which was only yards away. The final scenes show the M-36 driving into an American assembly area but which looked an awful lot like an open air museum. Another hint to the movie makers: the U.S. Army was segregated during WWII. I could write a book on the nonsense in this film. Suffice it to say that the Germans were child murdering thugs and the Americans were true heroes every one.",1413417600,13,2725,4.408730158730159

I really thought the woman and the orphanage theme were a bit much, as I would have stayed with the original mission orders. However, I think ""the good American GI theme"" was a noble one, none the less.

First off, I've never seen cleaner tanks (look freshly painted loaners from a museum or collection) like they can't get them dirty for the film.  Same goes for the clothing and weapons, must be loaned out from a collection somewhere.  Mixed with fake computer generated scenes from a game somewhere.  Totally stiff and fake action scenes (like soldiers standing in the middle of an area firing their weapons).  Not even close to reality where soldiers are filthy dirty, scrambling around in the muck to stay out of the way of a bullet.  Usually firing and moving etc.  Bombs seems to be puff balls of powder sprayed with compressed gas, no black dirty smoke lingering, just a white puff.

I agree with most of the reviews saying that this was bad acting, inconsistent history scenarios, and very near impossible situations (hand-to-hand fighting in front of a tank that can still maneuver and shoot?  not bloody likely).  I love tank/war movies (Fury, Battle of the Bulge, Patton, Midway, The Great Escape, etc.), but this was so cheesy and had such poor acting that I couldn't take another minute of it.  So much for another good tank movie.",1483488000,,524,4.602150537634409
6590745,2,B00MO21W2W,"Some amazing weaponry shown, with a good deal of help from reenactors. But, I personally thought the acting was poorly done.  Worse perhaps, was the technical advisement for the film.  For example, this one Sherman tank takes out three German tank coming up the same road... With direct frontal shots where armour is thickest!  This is notoriously inaccurate.  Same is true of firefights take place with everyone standing straight up, with no one diving far cover.  I suppose that gets your face in the film, but it certainly reflect WW2 training or battle experience.

Likewise where a couple of the Germans show SS markings, the really nasty officer did not.  Similarly, the refueling of the Sherman with only 10 gallons of salvaged gas, wouldn't have taken it very far at all.

If the technical aspects had been more accurate, it might have earned another star.

BTW, the ""Ardennes"" was a heavily Forrester area; this was filmed in America, on southern farmland (if I got the credits right), with minimal forrest and lots of farm grassy fields.",1483401600,,1047,4.903409090909091

6590748,3,B00MO21W2W,"Standard WWII plot that is predictable.  I suspect this was an attempted take off on Fury which I haven't seen.  First thing I noted is that the Battle of the Bulge was fought in the Ardennes in December in bitter cold weather.  This movie showed it to be a much more pleasurable climate.  If you're looking for realistic WWII battle story I suspect this won't fit the bill - too much arguing with the commander which I don't believe would be tolerated in actual combat (at least I hope not?).  Special effects were different but interesting.  The entire presentation gave the impression of a documentary/recreation that was fairly well done, for a documentary.

Remember the big studio blockbuster movie Pearl Harbor? During the attack there were several shots of American destroyers being bombed. Now of those ships had hull numbers. Do you know why? Decommissioned ships have their hull numbers removed. What were decommished destroyers doing at 1941 Pearl Harbor? More than likely you can come up with a snappy answer. Well, answer this one, All of the decommissioned destroyers had very sharp bow lines. Know why? Because they were Spruance class destroyers. Spruance class destroyers did not enter the active U.S.Navy fleet until the 1970's. All of you little Roger Everts put that in your pipes and smoke it.",1469491200,,950,4.627218934911243

Their armor is too thin to survive a hit, therefore their main roll is to sit back at a range of 1000-2000 yards (10-20 football fields), shoot, then move to another position before they are discovered and try again. 2nd, American tanks and tank destroyers could not penetrate the frontal armor of a German tiger tank (the big blocky German tank), therefore none  of the hits shown destroying those German tanks would have done so. 3rd, America had segregated units in World War 2, therefore you would never see black and white soldiers in the same tank together. While I disagree with segregation and racism in general, incorporating a black soldier in an otherwise white unit would not have happened at the time and is a sorry attempt to add additional tension to the movie by playing on racial stereotypes and racism encountered by black soldiers at the time. 4th, and my favorite, the Germans would NEVER have used RUSSIAN T-34 TANKS AGAINST AMERICANS!! Germany was at war with Russia and would not have access to those tanks, as well as access to enough of the ammunition needed to fire that tank's gun to justify moving it from the Russian front to the Ardennes even if they were using one they had captured.",1459296000,2,1579,4.7765567765567765

6591383,4,B00MO21W2W,"First off, I'm a military history and war movie buff.  I have book/ DVD libraries filled with technical details on tanks, guns, and  battles of WW2.  Did the opening battle against a T-34 (Russian) tank bother me?  No, in fact, maybe the Germans brought it back from Kursk to use on the Western Front.  Why not?  Did the CG Tiger tanks ruin it for me?  Not really, I thought they were pretty well rendered, but tactically wasted.  How about the gray painted German machines that should have been yellow at this stage of the war?  The explosions too small? Naw, artistic licence.  Besides, some things the film makers did get right, like the M1 Garrand rifles and a late MG 42 machine gun.  These, like most aspects of this low budget flick were a matter of ...budget.
Once past the initial battle the film is an ensemble piece that emphasizes the characters in the US squad and their ""sister"" whom they are helping.  The acting is solid enough, the Nazi villains do a nice job without going over the top.  There are short battle sequences that are very well done and quite realistic.  Thomas Stedham gives a grizzled ""Sgt. Rock"" performance and the rest of the squad establish their characters well enough.

After all is said and done, this is very much a classic comic book type story  (think GI Combat! if you are old enough to remember that) brought to
life.  It's not pretentious and it kept my interest which is saying a lot, and in my opinion in its own way was as good as the recently over inflated ""Fury"" with Brad Pitt.",1423440000,,1528,4.498181818181818

6591388,1,B00MO21W2W,"Wed thrown ourselves down the rabbit hole on a quest to find the worst movie on Netflix, and we may have found the Holy Grail with this one. Oh, where to beginfirst, this movie should be cited for excessive use of a smoke machine. That aside, the only thing this movie was truly missing was a riff track by Joel (or Mike), Tom Servo and Crow. But thats OK, we provided our own.
A guide to watching this movie. STEP ONE: find something better to watch. But if you're such a masochist that youve decided you're sticking with it, we recommend a continuous infusion of alcohol to make it more tolerable. STEP TWO: immediately discard any expectations for realistic depiction of the Ardennes or even WWII. For example: one of the guys is carrying a Vietnam-era rifle (note to the historically impaired: the Vietnam war began place 15+ years after WWII ended); the Battle of the Bulge, during which the battles took place in the Ardennes, took place in Winter, but the forest in this movie was spring- or summer-time green and in Alabama (totally different foliage); reference to distance in klicks, another Vietnam-era reference (see previous parenthetical note). WWII buffs will undoubtedly spend their entire movie-watching time finding more inaccuracies, so it can be fun to watch them yell at the TV in the same way my Dad yells his rebuttal to the State of the Union address. STEP THREE: discard any grandiose expectations of seeing any quality acting. The best acting was performed by a teddy bear cast aside when his owner was killed. STEP FOUR: Loudly yell  Murica! every time they do something remotely brave, kill someone, or do something redneck. Trust me, its fun. Turn it into a drinking game, and boo-yah, youve got an entertaining evening. STEP FIVE: Envy the people whod been burned to deaththeir exposure to this movie was mercifully short, when youve still got an hour or so of suffering to go. STEP SIX: Remark how much the hostage woman looks like Severus Snape from Harry Potter, then loudly exclaim, Thats Sgt Schultzs sister! when she tells the German officer, I know nothing! STEP SEVEN: Make fun of the German officers complete lack of German accent  even a poorly faked one  as well as his permanently-crooked hat. STEP EIGHT: watch the credits, and look for the acknowledgement of the Waffle House, Whataburger, and Cracker Barrel restaurants. No, were not kidding.

6591410,1,B00MO21W2W,"This movie is Garbage.  The computer generated scenes are worse than than in a mediocre video game.  The characters belong in a cartoon.  The movie is extremely unrealistic.  The Sherman tank could not take a Tiger tank head on.  The superior optics and the long range and accurate gun of the Tiger tank meant that, in an open field, Tiger tanks could start hitting Sherman tanks well before Sherman tanks could return effective fire.

As other have pointed out, the armor in the front of the Tiger was too thick for a standard Sherman to penetrate.  (This excludes a less common version of the tank modified to use a larger gun by the British and named the Sherman Firefly.)  To destroy a Tiger tank a Sherman had to outmaneuver the Tiger and hit the Tiger's thinner armor in its rear.

Most anti tank rounds were solid shot.  They did not explode on impact.  Tanks had fuel and explosives inside which could ignite or explode if struck by a penetrating round.  If a tank's armor was penetrated and the tank caught on fire or exploded it was from the inside out, not the outside in.

I would give this movie zero stars if I could.  I could not watch more than 6 minutes of it.  I could have ignored the lack of realism and watched more if I liked the characters.  I did not.

However I did not watch this movie to critique the accurate use of heavy and light firearms, I wanted to be entertained and was entertained. To me this movie had the same basic undertones of the 1940 to 1950 cowboy movie of bad guy taking advantage of the weak and helpless, when in rides the good guy to help and ""make things right"". The only difference that I see is the good guys portrayed more realistic responses to helping out the helpless. In the old classics of Roy Rogers and Hoppy, they never gave a second thought to riding into a hail of bullets to save the ""wronged"".
I particularly like the notion of asking is ""it really worth it"". In the end these American Soldiers did the right thing even though they asked the question, and that makes an entertaining story to me.",1420848000,,981,4.366120218579235

6591418,4,B00MO21W2W,"Look, don't watch this movie to see authentic WWII action dramatized. Nor watch this movie to see great actors delivering well written lines, though the acting is suitable as are the lines of the screenplay. Fulfilling those two things is not really the purpose this movie serves. Then why even watch it? you may ask. This is merely a fun movie to watch. It's entertainment. If you want war history dramatized go see another WWII movie. But wait! Don't turn away from this movie merely by what is said up to this point. The movie conveys not that bad of a story. Expect no character development, however. That effect is not formulated into this kind of movie. It serves not that purpose. Many reviewers do disagree. Yet present in this movie are the ingredients of a good story. Good and bad guys are present. A lot of action occurs. Included are moments of its interspersed absence that heightens effect. Often guns are shot, meaning gun battles occur with frequency. Bombs explode, things blow up. But that's not to say elements of human interest are absent. This movie is a simplistic (as in simple) study of a human interest about two important aspects of being human. Scoff at that many reviewers might. Looking over what has been written about the movie in Amazon are some reviews bringing attention to the presence of inaccuracies in the movie. Now knowledge of WWII stuff is not in this instance claimed as many reviewers claim of their own knowledge. A lack of WWII hardware knowledge did not prevent noticing the presence of inaccuracies and improbabilities. Most glaring inaccuracy is the presence of an African-American among a predominately White-American military unit which at that time did not occur. Segregation was the norm. But it doesn't matter. For this movie a WWII setting serves as a means with which to portray another story. Summed up in a few words this movie conveys a story about determination and survival and a struggle between good and bad. Determination is evident by both the German officer and the American Sargent and the men under his command. Of the German officer it can be said he relentlessly pursues the Sargent's small group of men, and they are merely patrol size at best, nothing significant. So fixated on this group of  American soldiers is this German officer one might ask why? Might there be more pressing matters for him to focus on amid the war in which he is involved? About that perhaps some would say that's one weakness of the story. So improbable of someone some might say. Or on the other hand is the German's fixation a revealing of an aspect of  his character? Most evident to most would be the German officer's sinister manner, very unlikable this guy. And at movie's end a sadistic side of him surfaces. Along with him in the story is the small detachment of  American soldiers, not to be forgotten in this writing. Equally determined in their pursuit are both members of the American detachment and their Sargent.  An opportunity for that quality to be revealed occurs as a happenstance meeting of a woman initiates a decision. That decision launches the unit of men on a rescue mission, taking them away from their prior assigned official goal. Amid surrounding carnage and mayhem the unit sets out on the rescue mission putting themselves at great risk. Despite the rescue mission, about the American unit of men it might be said survival is their number one goal. Always they are having to be on the alert. Extraordinary challenges to their survival constantly dog them. One predicament after another confronts them. A presence of this produces a bit of a tautness in the story line.  In many predicaments confronting them is the unexpected occurrences of death to particular characters, characters figured not to be so expendable. For each occurrence affects surprise in the viewer. Approaching the movie's conclusion is a scene where still pursued by the German officer the American Sargent, out gunned and clearly disadvantaged, fights on with maniacal verve. In the end American and German combat each other in a life and death struggle. Ops spoiler! Not to be overly concerned dear reader. A lot of details are here absent in writing. All of this said culminates in regarding this movie as just good clean fun: No swearing, not even the presence of smoking of cigarettes. Recommended is to look passed the CGI effects many reviewers either complain about or draw attention to. Accept the movie on its own merits. And it has some. This movie conveys, in a sense, a comic book like story. In this case that's a good thing. The purpose this movie serves is to entertain.

6591455,5,B00MO21W2W,Ardennes Fury is  one  of  the  new war movies  that  is  being  produced  today  with  the  help  of re-enactors.  The  American  Hellcat Tank destroyer  is genuine  as is a lot  of the  other equipment used  in the  film. Unfortunately a mistake  was made in  that  the World War  II Army  was  segregated  and thus  there  would  have  been no  African American  member of the crew. Still  he  gave  an excellant performance. There  was at least  a really silly moment  when a Tiger Tank  pushes  two  destroyed  Tiger I aside like they  were  made of  tin. Not going to happen.  But  it  was  enjoyible to  watch even with its flaws.,1416787200,5,637,4.36697247706422
6591456,1,B00MO21W2W,"The film opens with some actual WWII footage and then we go right into a CG tank battle with no character introduction. We get to know them on the fly. A tank caught behind enemy lines opt to rescues an orphanage before meeting up with their unit because ""it is the right thing to do.""

We discover ""Germans execute"" and we ""take them out."" Also German tanks can't shoot straight. Do WWII planes normally have double smoke trails behind them?

The film creates internal faux drama and faux tension. This must have been the only white group that had an African-American sergeant as part of the group over some whites. It also uses cliche lines. The acting and dialogue was well below par. Very difficult to sit through.

Another Asylum mockbuster.

8673395,1,B00MO21W2W,"This was a poorly researched, a poorly scripted and poorly directed movie. To me the ""gold standard"" of the Ardennes campaign is the 1949 movie ""Battleground"" starring Van Johnson, John Hodiak and James Whitmore. The movie ""Ardennes Fury"" lacked the severe winter environment that American troops had to fight in, that same winter environment that denied the Americans tactical air support during the early stages of the campaign. The use of tank destroyers as tanks was cringe worthy, tank destroyers are thinly armored, they were never designed to go head to head with tanks or be employed as tanks. Tank destroyers were designed to essentially ambush enemy tanks. The black soldier in an integrated unit did not occur that aspect of the movie was contrived. However, the movie could have depicted the historically accurate fact that number of the black combat units, tank, tank destroyer and field artillery battalions fought in and around Bastogne;  one of the battalions the the black 969th Field Artillery was awarded the Distinguish Unit Citation by the 101st Airborne Division Commander. This movie lacked technical realism on all levels, I seriously doubt the
director or anyone else opened a history book or sought  the advice of a military technical adviser. My advice if you want to see the most realistic movie of the Ardennes Campaign, watch the 1949 classic ""Battleground"".",1526169600,,1388,5.164444444444444

The re-enactors that replace professional actors in this production are even worse than before. There is NO SNOW during the movie, which is ridiculous considering Ardennes took place during the late fall/early winter with snow permanently on the ground. Most egregious of all was the depiction of black men fighting on the front lines as American troops. NEVER HAPPENED. This movie is one I really wanted to like, because there are  no good depictions of Americans fighting in the Battle of the Bulge (with the exception of a few episodes of HBOs BoB a decade ago). Horrible movie, cheap gimmicks, low production value, uninspired writing, ugly special effects, inaccurate depiction of tank doctrine/usage. Ugh, I can go on.
