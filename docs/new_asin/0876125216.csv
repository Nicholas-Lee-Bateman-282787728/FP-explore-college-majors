Otherwise, what I heard deserves 5 Stars.  I liked what heard from Brother Anandamoy & his wittiness.
I would recommend this DVD to those who don't have hearing issues.",1444953600,2,362,4.640625

Brother Anandamoy put it simple but it is a very dense and inebriant subject.",1419897600,3,152,4.884615384615385
