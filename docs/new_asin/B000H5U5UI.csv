2626828,2,B000H5U5UI,"I was really looking forward to getting this series, but it was a let down. The information on the ancient battles is great and the narrator Matthew Settle (Band of Brothers) is fine but the computer graphics to detail the battles is dull and repetitive. The CGI effects make all the soldiers look the same and their movments look like swarms of bee's rather than anything specific to the battle. If you don't like the graphics (which I didn't), then you're pretty much 'done' with the series because they are the major tool used to bring the stories alive.",1210032000,21,557,4.636363636363637
2626829,4,B000H5U5UI,"""Decisive Battles"" is a series that details some of the most famous military engagements of the ancient world.  The battles include the Third Servile War (Spartacus's Rebellion), the massacre of Roman legions by Germanic tribes at the Teutonberg Forest, Attila's defeat at Chalons, Alexander the Great's triumph over Persia at Gaugamalea, and others. The individual programs are fairly short and the epic computerized battle scenes certainly enhance the viewing and give the viewer a better sense of the scale of a battle than a small group of reenactors would.  Overall, an interesting series that I would recommend to those interested in ancient military history.",1207526400,6,665,5.384615384615385
2626830,5,B000H5U5UI,"When I saw this set advertised, I was very excited to get it.  But when I read that the battles were presented using computer simulations, I was very skeptical.  It just sounded so cheesy.  Well, I bought the series and viewed with an open mind.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The simulations will fool no one, but they're good enough for their purpose--to show the ENTIRE battlefield, which in some cases will cover several miles, and not just a couple guys in hand-to-hand combat.  You just can't get several thousand Greek and Roman, etc. reenactors together for this type of documentary.  This format is a very good way of doing it.
What about the material itself? All is very good.  The information is presented in a lively manner and is satisfying for the viewer.  I learned a lot and have watched several episodes more than once.  All in all, this is a good set and has set a trend for documentaries of the future.  Get this if you are interested in the ancient world, warfare, or history in general.  You won't be disappointed.",1198368000,63,1034,4.6208791208791204
2626831,4,B000H5U5UI,"I really enjoyed this series. The overall production was superb. the battle scenes were not as clear as they could have been, but the background narrative and the expert commentary was informative and entertaining. Having played the Rome: Total War game that they used to create the battle simulations I felt that they shortchanged themselves in several areas. They used the same scenes over and over again and generated very little variety in the troop skins. They could have added a lot more variety to the battle scenes, but overall it was worth what I paid for it.",1197504000,4,568,4.8061224489795915
2626832,4,B000H5U5UI,"It's entertaining and informative. The computer graphic does help viewers see the formations of the battles clearer. However, it's not as exciting as dramatized scenes played by human beings. History channel should have used both of these means in making these DVDs.

Another problem is they don't have subtitles. As a result, there were many times I did not know how to spell the name of a person or a location mentioned by the narrator. I had to search for them on the Internet and in history books.

They are still worth watching. I own them.",1195516800,12,545,4.666666666666667
2626833,2,B000H5U5UI,"When I purchased this DVD set I had high hopes.  Unfortunately the episodes are ruined by the video/computer game graphics that are supposed to enhance understanding for the viewer.  Instead, they completely annoyed me after only one episode, and I had to force myself to watch the rest since I shelled out the cash for the set.  The movements of the troops are too repetitive, robotic, take up too much on-screen time, and are just plain corny.  I really would have enjoyed this set had it not been for the computer game graphics (and by computer game graphics, we're not talking X-Box 360 here, maybe early playstation 2).

2626835,4,B000H5U5UI,"Using the pc game Rome:Total War's  graphic engine Decisive Battles is better able to convey how battle played out than a few reenacters. On the other hand if you are familiar with the game as I was, the effect is slightly disappointing. As each episode is only about 22 minutes long there not much depth here, but I would still recommend this as a solid introduction to ancient battles.",1181347200,33,387,4.608695652173913
2626836,4,B000H5U5UI,"Decisive Battles is a great collection for the average historian, its episodes last 20 minutes each and involve a retelling of the introduction, fighting and aftermath of major battles from The Persian Wars up to the fall of the Roman Empire.

It uses the game engine from Rome: Total War, this is a fresh tool for battle documentaries as they often use short glimpses of a small group of actors (often not resembling the characters they're supposed to be) involved in repetitous, choreographed melee. This gives some design to the armies and the scale allows for a greater clash and experience.

Included in the documentaries are historians familiar with the topics proving extra information and emphasis to the battles. They do seem restricted sometimes and edited for time, but they do add excitement as the story develops.

This will not satisfy some historians, but overall its an educational show with a short timeslot, its excellent for introductions to the battles for people who don't want to read the accounts from ancient sources. Great for kids as its not to violent, short and action packed.

Also Im Australian and was worried about the regional coding on the dvd, its absolutely no problem, don't let it deter you from buying what should be an addition to the dvd collection.",1179100800,77,1290,4.9308755760368665

The ""game system technology"" is from Total War, and while it is a little simplified regarding details, it provides an excellent visual representation of the battle formations and tactics used.

2626848,2,B000H5U5UI,"I would have given this DVD only one star but the accuracy and completeness of these battles where very good.

But I did not expect stick figures one step removed from Pak-Man. Yes the animation is that BAD! Save your money and do not buy this piece of junk. This is 2012 not 1980.

2626863,5,B000H5U5UI,"For about the past year, my kids (10 and 7) and I read a chapter of Gombrich's ""A Little History of the World"" each week, and watched a video covering related material.  Our review of ""decisive battles"" stems from that purpose.  Check out the website in my profile to find out more about our project, including a complete listing of suggested videos.

We got this dvd from our library at the last minute after a delivery snafu meant that we did not have the 60-minute National Geographic ""Beyond the Movie- Alexander"" video available.  I was initially disappointed to settle for this substitute.  However, Decisive Battles - Alexander at Gaugamela turned out to be a huge success with both kids.  They loved the video game re-enactments.  The short clip (about 20-30 min) easily kept them engaged the whole episode, and left them wanting more - a rare event with most history documentary videos.  In addition to the battle itself, the episode did provide a background overview of Alexander, including a quick description of his growing up and his full adventure.  This provided a new target for level of video to aim for our audience, and I have included several other ""decisive battles"" episodes in my recommeded list of history dvds for kids.

Through live modern images of the lands and ruins where these battles took place, and interviews with highly knowledgable scholars on the subject, and great computer simulations that show you the incredible scope... tactics and carnage of these key battles... you are put right in the middle of the scene.

2626866,5,B000H5U5UI,"The Good.  The 13 battles which are selected as truly decisive battles, not just for the people who fought them, but for Western Civilization.  The battles of Marathon, Gaugamela, and Thermopylae, to name a few, molded our world and made us what we are today.  The use of Rome: Total War to help explain and explore the battles is really brilliant.  Instead of six or seven reactors, wearing the wrong equipment, fighting in the fog you get to see the huge formations fighting over a landscape designed to look like the real environment at the time the battle was fought.  Some of the camera angles are pretty well thought out - sometimes you get a bird's point of view and sometimes the camera seems to be peeking over the shoulder of a soldier, giving you the view from the front lines.  Mathew Settle is even placed in some of the battles, his scaled down body standing next to the marching computer troops as he describes their equipment, abilities and skills.  And as for the milling around action that many complain about?  Well, that did happen in combat.  Troops who are trapped, without leadership or direction, can become confused and scared.  And they panic.

The Bad.  In some of the battles, instead of the video game scenes aiding us in understanding the action it sometimes makes things worse.  Example,  in the episode called Ramses II, the Egyptians trap some of the Hittite's chariots within their camp.  The Egyptian bowmen start to open fire on the milling enemy.  Suddenly we have a scene where the Hittite chariots are all in neat, well ordered lines and as the arrows come down they die in neat, nice, well ordered lines.  Not only the crew and the horses, but the chariots too!  When a unit dies the wheels fall off, making for a very silly death scene.  Yet seconds before they were a confused mob of chariots trapped by tents and Egyptian ground troops.  It just took away from the moment.
In another battle, in the episode Hail Caesar!, we have Caesar and Pompey fighting each other.  One of the points made during the episode was that both sides had to have passwords, because they couldn't tell each other apart - one of the problems in fighting a Civil War in which everybody used the same equipment.  But in the battle shown, both armies had different COLORS!  No doubt the game would not allow both sides to each wear red, but it still is seemed a tad strange.

The Very Good.  I really did enjoy the extras.  One is Foot Soldier: The Greeks, hosted by Richard Karn.  While some scenes seem a tad silly, the overall information given about Greek soldiers was very interesting and, in some cases when dealing with camp followers and battle medicine, very mature.  I would even suggest watching this special before you watch any of the episodes on Greek warfare.  I plan, in fact, to try to find this series, to see what they say about the Romans, Egyptians and other soldiers of history.
The other special, Ancient Mysteries: The Secret Life of King Ramses II, was also very useful in that it helped us understand the true importance of the battle in which he stopped the Hittites from expanding south.  It does a very good job in explaining his life, goals, and skills as a leader.  Hosted by Leonard Nimoy.

If you want more details on ancient warfare, I would suggest the following books.

The battles are ""fought"" using the game engine of Rome:Total War, which was probably pretty impressive when this was first released. However, the graphics now look dated, with the different armies looking pretty darn similar, just with differently colored uniforms (you have the Roman template, the barbarian template, and the middle eastern/asian template). The animations do a good job of showing the tactics involved, and the narrator and historians do a good job of explaining motivations and the events of the battles, leading to an overall solid series. Just don't expect to be impressed with the animation graphics.",1262995200,,716,5.401785714285714
2626868,5,B000H5U5UI,"Might makes right, but might and brains don't always go together and ""fortune rules all things; she raises to eminence or buries in oblivion from caprice rather than principle."" (Sallust)

If you don't believe that, you should check out Decisive Battles of the Ancient World from the History Channel. This fantastic documentary covers thirteen major battles ranging from Ramses II fighting the Hittites for control of Syria to the Spartans standing off the Persians at Thermopylae to the Gothic invasion of Rome and Boudicca's revolt in Britain. ""Chance rules all,"" according to Virgil, but after watching Decisive Battles, I'd change that to ""chance, hubris, ambition, greed and stupidity.""

Most of these battles were epochal to one degree or another, shaping the future development of the entire Western world, and the West as we know it might not even exist if they'd turned out differently. So it's unnerving (and comical) to realize how contingent history really is--how much of it is determined by random combinations of personality and circumstance, the fate of nations hanging on the quirks of strutting egos and a roll of the dice.

The video covers each battle in a twenty-minute episode, featuring lots of maps, background material, onsite footage and interviews with classical scholars like Victor Davis Hanson--expert on Hoplite warfare and author of the great book ""A War Like No Other,"" a history of the Peloponnesian War. The battles themselves are presented using a beta version of the video game Rome: Total War, using computer graphics to animate the formations and maneuvers. This is a lot more effective than using re-enactors since it provides an aerial view of the battles and a sense of their scale.

Some of these fights are stories of epic courage like the last stand of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, while others are chaotic and insane--bloody massacres doomed from the start. Some of the commanders were geniuses like Caesar, Paulinus and Alexander the Great. Others were less brilliant, to say the least, marching their armies into death traps like Varus and Crassus. In any case, this is ""Big Man"" history--a story of High Glory and Major Screwups--and it's mind-boggling how small some of these Big Men really were.

Great stuff. Highly recommended.

You see individual warriors running and turning to nowhere.  Like they're looking for a fight, but don't know where to go.

Besides that, I think the series is well made from a historical point of view.  It would have been better if each episode was an hour instead of a half, as there is really too much to cover.

Best episodes: Birth of the Roman Empire, Battle of Carrhae, Battle of Cannae.

To pad out the third DVD, Richard Karn (Al from Home Improvement) hosts a half hour of life as a Greek hoplite.  Not too serious, take it for what its worth.

2626871,5,B000H5U5UI,"Up until the successor, Medieval II Total War, Rome Total War was my favorite video game ever.  Almost totally modifiable, and the most accurate depiction of ancient warfare, along with the capabilities of fielding thousands of individual units on the field at once for top-notch accuracy and combat.

And as is done in many ""battle replays"" and historical battles, the best way to put this to use educationally is put to use in this series, ""Decisive Battles"", which uses this video game technology to display what previously could only be done with huge film budgets and thousands of extras.

One of the best parts is that every bit of video game footage is actual game footage.  The graphics aren't perfect, and all the troops within a unit look identical, but it's arguably the best portrayal of the sheer size and scope of ancient battles in a documentary, with the game footage churning out TENS of thousands of units on the field, far beyond that which the game could even allow on one side.

The documentaries also feature the use of the in-game music, composed by Jeff van Dyck, and the traditional use of historians and the like speaking about the historical subjects, my favorite of which being Steven Pressfield for the episodes on Marathon and Thermopylae.

The scope of the battles cover some of the more commonly known, such as the battle of Marathon, Thermopylae, Cannae, Teutoberg Forest, and Gaugamela, but I'm also delighted at the inclusion of such battles as the battle of Cynocephalae (the first decisive battle of the Macedonian Wars between Rome and Macedon), the battle of Kadesh (the oldest known recorded battle in history, between the Egyptians and the Hittites), the battle of Adrianople, the battle of Watling Street, and so on and so on.

Perhaps the game content would make it impossible, but if they either hired the modteam for ""Europa Barbarorum II"" or designed units themselves, I could easily see this series becoming far more impressive and astounding if it were re-made (or simply done with the base game's Medieval units) using ""Medieval II Total War"" for a new set of ""Decisive Battles"" documentaries.  It would be phenomenal, with the inclusion of non-cloned armies, grit, and blood.

Another set of documentaries were produced by BBC, using Rome Total War, called ""Time Commanders"", which features simultaneously two groups of people re-creating historical battles and fighting them out themselves, alongside and following with descriptions of the actual battles.  I find it even more impressive for including some not very well known battles, such as the battle of Leuctra (in which the Theban Sacred Band destroyed the Spartans using innovative new weapons and tactics).",1233532800,7,2715,5.053691275167785

More and more I see history being re-written, by the liberal left in everything from movies to classroom textbooks and lectures.",1406505600,,346,4.931034482758621

8136399,3,B000H5U5UI,"This DVD presents a conflict:It probably works well for the intended audiences,but falls short for more serious students of history. When I saw this program on the History Channel several years ago,the game platform format was a turn off for me being somehat older than the intended younger audience. But used as an entre to the study of history, this DVD can interest a teenager used to the game platform graphics,a doorway to more intensive study. Good of the type,if one keeps the limitations in mind and not expect more depth in the program. The copy I purchased was given to a interested eleven year old.",1383264000,,609,4.754716981132075
