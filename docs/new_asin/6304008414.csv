7858586,3,6304008414,"A very very stylized, starkly minimalistic, risky vision of the idea of life without birth, a la Frankenstein, involving a military funded operation to build the perfect soldier with the use of body parts from eighty-eight individuals. The ""Stitch Project"" initially appears to be a success until the creation begins to remember those who he was and those who he loved. A more ""thinking/talking"" than ""doing/action"" piece (until the last few scenes). Intriguing and weird at the same time. Definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea.

Rutger Hauer is the ""Dr. Frankenstein"" and Wil Wheaton (Wesley Crusher from Star Trek The Next Generation) is the creation (the actor who plays the supporting role of the General - whose name I am happy to say I don't know - should have his SAG card revoked and instead be a card carrying member of BAA: Bad Acting Anonymous).

Ron Perlman has a small role, told in flashback, of a doctor who was initially involved in the creation process and ends up becoming literally a part of it after he is killed trying to stop the military from subverting his work. He has some beautifully sweet romantic moments with love interest/co-worker Nia Peeples.

Favorite line(s): ""Without choice you can be alive but you wouldn't be living."" ""Music is like poetry or fiction only put to sound."" ""If you believe it in your heart than follow it otherwise don't be so eager to concur with the opinions of others.""",1104278400,4,1429,4.8244897959183675

This movie is seriously underatted. The concepts are well presented and thought provoking, although some may be a little controversial. As a concept artist myself, I am envious of the level of imagination put into this movie.

I would only recomend this movie to those seeking a true sci-fi brilliance as oppossed to someone seeking an action packed blockbuster. If you are looking for something to really make you think then definatly check this out.",1103155200,6,668,4.6525423728813555
7858588,5,6304008414,"To me, Roger Avary's Mr. Stitch is one of the most underrated movies ever. Yes, it's sparse special fx and some sets may look cheap, but hell, this isn't what Mr. Stitch is all about, in the same way as Gene Roddenberry's ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" isn't about science fiction.
If you're looking for great fx or hollywood style entertainment, then you'd be ill-advised with Mr. Stitch, this is not the kind of movie to watch with friends at a video party. It's the fusion of utterly brilliant, thought provoking dialogues with truly magnificent music (by tomandandy) where this piece of art excels. Mr. Stitch has a timeless quality to it and if watched alone and without any distraction (recommended) it creates a unique, almost hypnotic mood. I especially like the beautiful night sky scene.
As so often, it's all a matter of taste, but by no means should Mr. Stitch be called a failure as it definately succeeds in transporting it's message to those inclined to listen carefully enough.
If you prefer ""Last Light"" to ""Dead Man Walking"", ""Dark City"" to ""Matrix"", ""Supernova"" to ""Star Wars"", ""Sweet November"" to ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""Blade Runner"" to ""Minority Report"", then, I guess, you're compatible with Mr. Stitch and there's a very good chance that you'll love it.
Personally, I'd pay nearly any price if this little gem came out on DVD.",1048896000,11,1355,4.844827586206897
7858589,3,6304008414,"I must say I was totally glued to the screen during the first 40 minutes of the movie. While a number of old ingredients were present in the story, some twists of modern science were carefully applied. The vast potential of the mix was immensely evident, and unfolding suspense carefully adminstered to the viewer.
Many movies seem to be released in pairs (such as Volcano & Dante's Peak, Deep Impact & Armageddon...), and such was the case with this one too: it explores some elements akin to the film Powder.
Unfortunately, as the movie went on, the story solved itself towards the ending in a very predictable, traditional way. Which is sad, since this film had all the possibilities to be something truly unique. While a lot of the film was artistically extremely high-brow, a few ugly bits here and there damaged the effect.
The soundtrack was similar to the movie itself: something very interesting and potential was on the works by ""Tomandandy"", but a number of searing flaws ruined the whole.",975110400,4,1000,4.819767441860465
