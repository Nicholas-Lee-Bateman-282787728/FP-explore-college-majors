8679904,3,B00NSIQA1E,Such a waste of good talent. Did they really have to make this film at all?  No wonder it has not received distribution!,1444262400,,120,4.217391304347826
8679905,5,B00NSIQA1E,"My wife and I both enjoyed this Disney movie. (I don't know why it hasn't been released in the U.S.A.) Since we have region-free players, we have no problem playing DVDs from other parts of the world.",1437177600,2,200,4.4324324324324325
8679906,4,B00NSIQA1E,"Esio Trot is a plain, sweet, endearing movie built on the simple story line of the book by Roald Dahl. And it takes two great actors to make it so. Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench are simply the characters, believable, human and appealing. It's wonderful to see a movie without sex, violence and rip-roaring special effects. Lovely entertainment.",1434758400,3,344,4.948275862068965
