8601662,5,B00E60M1DE,"If your are interested in English Royal history this DVD is compelling in the understanding of the current Queen Elizabeth. She has been just like her Father George V1 and Grandfather George V devoted to her role as Queen of England.
You feel some sympathy for her as she goes about her business considering her children had some complaints years before not now. It helps one to understand where her devotion came from. How King George V and Queen Mary assisted & prepared her for her Royal duties to come",1480291200,,505,4.622222222222222

8601665,5,B00E60M1DE,"The item arrived promptly and it was packaged well.  What a great movie about King George and Queen Mary.  I enjoyed seeing the old photos and vintage film footage.  The first hour was dedicated to King George and the second hour to Queen Mary.  I don't know if they rescued the monarchy, but they made changes to make the monarchy more accesible to their subjects; and changed the family name to reflect a more English heritage.",1401062400,2,429,4.605263157894737
