5878651,3,B00DYC6N20,"Enjoyed Bing singing, of course.  My children lost interest because it wasn't flashy enough... I enjoyed it though.  Hadn't expected to see Bob Newhart... I'm guessing it was one of his earliest gigs.",1387065600,,200,5.03030303030303
5878652,4,B00DYC6N20,"My husband and I were just reminiscing about the Christmas Specials we watched growing up;  Bing Crosby, Perry Cuomo, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra and Andy Williams just to mention a few.  I was so excited to see Bing Crosby's Christmas Special when browsing through Amazon Prime Instant Video.  The show was really great, made us laugh and brought back so many wonderful memories.  My only disappointment was the quality of the video itself:  and I am not sure if it was because of my set up using the Wii, or the video itself.  The show would freeze for a couple seconds and then continue but it did this every 30 seconds throughout the video.  While we were very disappointed, it did not stop us from enjoying the special.  That is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars.",1386979200,,771,4.536231884057971
5878653,4,B00DYC6N20,Very nostalgic for my 91 year old father. Of course B&W and low resolution but nice music with Kate Smith and Crosby's family. You'll have to be into nostalgia or a Crosby/Kate Smith fan to appreciate it because it is pretty old.,1383955200,,229,4.476190476190476
5878654,5,B00DYC6N20,"Loved it. Brought back so many childhood memories of Christmas with my family, many who have passed on. Some great times .",1383868800,,122,4.590909090909091
5878655,5,B00DYC6N20,"Great classic clips; Bing Crosby is a terrific MC. His humor, the decency and timing is great. He has a lovely family who are brought out through the special.  I do wish that the streaming was little more crisp, but that could also be my HI-Def TV over pixilation . In any event if you like classic Hollywood you will love this Christmas special.",1383782400,,346,4.40625
5878656,5,B00DYC6N20,"I loved watching this episode of The Hollywood Palace.  The copy was as nice as I've seen for this series in a long time.  I only wish you would release all of the episodes of ""The Hollywood Palace"" on Amazon's Instant Video.  There is a new generation who was not around to appreciate the talents of Bing and his many guests.",1382140800,3,326,4.311475409836065

5878695,3,B00DYC6N20,"If Your of a Certain Age, you remember the Hollywood Palace. Saturday night, almost Live, the best Imitation Sullivan show ever. Bing Crosby was a semi-permanent host, and hosted every Christmas. Not the best show, in glorious black and white,  it does represent the 60s. Cyd Charrise dances, Kate Smith sings, a dog act, high wire act.  Kitschy but fun",1419292800,,353,4.866666666666666
5878696,3,B00DYC6N20,"Many of you will probably find this show boring. However, if you lived in the 1960s and want to revisit this Christmas special, you will find what you need in this complete Christmas show episode. Bing Crosby's children are young and cute and participate in the show along with his wife Mary. If you are a student of the history of television, you will find this show educational.",1418688000,,380,4.602941176470588

5878710,5,B00DYC6N20,A good example of variety shows from the sixties. 60 minutes of great entertainment and enough of Bing to make it worthwhile to collectors. My wife loved it especially the dog act.,1392768000,,180,4.65625

5878712,5,B00DYC6N20,I have always lived Bing Crosby. Watching this reminded me of all of those star studded Christmas specials that I watched as a child. This is recommended for all ages.,1389398400,3,167,4.6

5878714,3,B00DYC6N20,"I enjoy White Christmas and many other movies of his, but Bing Crosby moments with his family feel artificial. The acts have nothing to do with the holiday. Basically, I was bored.",1389225600,,180,4.65625

5878716,4,B00DYC6N20,I grew up watching these Christmas programs . It was always a special time around the holidays for the family to be together and enjoy this multi-star entertainment format.  I recommend it.,1389052800,,189,4.90625
5878717,1,B00DYC6N20,This is the most NON-Christmas Christmas special ever.  The only good song was by Kate Smith.  Watch Andy Williams instead.,1388707200,,123,5.1

5878719,1,B00DYC6N20,The quality was poor and it was transferred to dvd in black and white when I know the original was in color. There was no description of the dvd but I assumed also that it was the show with the Lennon Sisters and Glen Campbell. It was a waste of my money.,1388707200,,255,3.923076923076923
5878720,2,B00DYC6N20,I was looking for the show where he sings with David Bowie.  This episode was not that show and it was nothing special,1388534400,,118,4.130434782608695

5878722,5,B00DYC6N20,Oh come on - it's Bing - it's Christmas - this was a great 'ol show to watch early Christmas morning when we got home from Church & wanted to relax & see what Christmas Eve was way back in the day ...,1388361600,,200,3.6744186046511627
5878723,5,B00DYC6N20,"I actually remember seeing this when it originally aired. It brought back a lot of memories of times past. One of the best parts was seeing Cyd Charisse in her prime looking wonderful.

I'm sure younger adults will fall asleep in the first five minutes, but if you remember the Hollywood Palace series you'll enjoy this video.",1388275200,,326,4.719298245614035
5878724,1,B00DYC6N20,"What a waste of money, seemed more like the Ed Sullivan show on any given Sunday.
Animal acts?  Trapeze artists?  Lousy Christmas show by Bing and company.",1388275200,,155,4.703703703703703

5878726,5,B00DYC6N20,"This is a great way to remember how simple entertainment was during early television.  A tight rope walker with dramatic drum rolls and cymbal crashes complete the throwback!  I swear I saw that guy on an American Pickers episode.

Can't beat Bing.  The only thing better would be if they left the commercials in.  It's a great way to get away from today and relax.",1388188800,2,365,4.553846153846154

5878731,3,B00DYC6N20,"I remember watching the Big Crosby Christmas specials as a child.  Variety Christmas shows are no longer done, and I must say that I miss them.  The performers on the show were really good, and fun to watch. The film quality however is very grainy and at times it is difficult to see.  A fun show however to remember how we celebrated Christmas in the past.",1387756800,4,357,4.378787878787879
5878732,3,B00DYC6N20,"We always had a black & white tv, so I was surprised to find the Hollywood Palace was televised in b&w instead of color. I somewhat remember this episode, more from the Bing Crosby family and Kate Smith segments.  Overall for nostalgia I recommend this.",1387670400,,253,4.622222222222222
5878733,5,B00DYC6N20,"Watching this program with my parents and the excitement of Christmas Day and celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.

5878735,5,B00DYC6N20,Excellent classic Christmas show. It has good clean family fun that we no longer get on our tv's in this day and age. The show also has a couple of the great singers sharing their voices.,1387497600,,187,4.222222222222222
5878736,1,B00DYC6N20,This is an old Bing Crosby Christmas show and not one of the better ones.  A more current show would be better.,1387065600,,111,4.045454545454546
