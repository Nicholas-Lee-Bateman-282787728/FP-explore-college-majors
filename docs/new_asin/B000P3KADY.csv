8188734,4,B000P3KADY,"MDK and Bachchan teamed up in 1977 with 2 blockbusters AAA and PARVARISH The same year MDK had 2 other blockbusters DHARAM VEER and CHACHA BHATIJA

Surprisingly Bachchan and Vinod starred in AAA and PARVARISH in diverse roles( In PARVARISH Amitabh played the lawkeeper and the lawbreaker in AAA while Vinod played the cop in AAA and the lawbreaker in PARVARISH)

The movie is a family drama and a complete commercial film with many subplots too

Nothing new though but well handled by MDK

The film is entertaining and keeps you involved The first half is well handled and Vinod's revelation to Bachchan is done brilliantly with the bhai bhai hotel used The second half too keeps you involved with Bachchan's blindness act and till the end the film involves you

Direction by MDK is good Music is good too

Amongst actors Amitabh and Vinod Khanna were a g8 pair and it shows they have done diverse roles in many films like ZAMEER(1975), HERA PHERI(1976) till their last film together MUQADDAR KA SIKANDAR(1978) Amitabh handles his role perfectly, cop roles suited him and he excels in drama too Vinod Khanna too is very good in his part Amjad Khan excels in his role, which he played in SUHAAG too Kader Khan is okay Shammi Kapoor started his first character role with this film and was good Neetu and Shabana(again repeated in AAA) did a good job in their parts",1306281600,,1362,4.677824267782427
