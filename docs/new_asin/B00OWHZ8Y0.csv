It has so many cute/funny moments it's definitely enjoyable to re-watch.  I'm glad I've got the series in my anime collection!",1437177600,,261,4.886363636363637

Every character have their own light, their own strenght in this plot, and united with the history's simplicity worked very well to delivered a powerfull comedy.

6775702,4,B00OWHZ8Y0,"Hilarious and amazingly cute show. It's a shame this one didn't get a dub to make it a bit more accessible to newer anime fans though.

Only other complaint is the compression seems to cause some nasty artifacting whenever there are large areas of white, like on background windows and such. For a blu-ray it could have looked a lot cleaner, maybe if they had lowered the compression and put it on 2 discs with 6 eps each?",1426636800,4,422,4.410256410256411
6775703,5,B00OWHZ8Y0,"Absolutely one of my most favorite shows. Even the wife who doesn't like anime sat and watched this one and was impressed at the comedy, and how the relationships evolved. One of the greatest parts is at the end when Kobeni goes to find the brother and sister. I loved  the music when I watched it on the computer, but here the words of the song is shown and it has truly touching lyrics. I can only hope that they will put out more seasons as there are tons of avenues they can develop. If they do, then I will spend my money to buy them it is that good.",1423958400,8,555,4.045454545454546
6775704,4,B00OWHZ8Y0,"Kobeni Yonomori is your typical high school girl, with good grades and good homemaking skills. Unbeknownst to her however, is that she has a fiance, Hakuya Mitsumine, which her grandfather arranged a few years back, who is moving into her household along with his younger sister Mashiro. Faced with this new reality Kobeni struggles to adapt to the new situation she finds herself in, especially since she supposedly met him when they were children but doesn't remember a thing about him.

I enjoyed this show on crunchyroll. It has an interesting mix of drama, high school slice of life, romance, and especially comedy. Though the central plot is supposed to be with Kobeni and Hakuya, I found it a bit boring, especially as Hakuya isn't a very interesting character due to not talking much, and barely interacting with other characters aside from Kobeni and Mashiro.

Fortunately Benio's obsession with Mashiro helps to carry the slower parts of the show. While the romance element is often downplayed, the comedy is fairly consistent throughout.

Definitely worth at least one viewing, and this could also be a series that you end up watching from time to time.",1414627200,17,1164,4.989690721649485
8685175,2,B00OWHZ8Y0,"Might have minor spoilers.

If you're scrolling through Crunchyroll and are in the mood for a totally bland, boring series, then you've hit the jackpot! Engaged to the Unidentified is a bad series. It's boring, unfunny, not romantic and after finishing the series you're unlikely to remember any scenes or moments from this monitinous drag of an anime.

The story centers around a generic 16 year old high schooler, like countless other anime heroines, who is to marry a mysterious person from her past. I'll just spoil the twist since it doesn't really matter and the series never uses the premise in any interesting manners. So the person that anime girl is engaged to is like a dog person. Or something like that. Cool, right? Not really, since this character is beyond boring and hardly ever speaks. If you think you're going to get a charming anime romcom; look elsewhere. The two leads have zero chemistry.

There are of course, the whacky side characters such as dog person's annoying little sister (Who is clearly there to be the OMG Kawai! character) and anime girl's older sister, who has a little sister... fetish? And is the best character in the show; although she does get tedious at times. There are other characters as well, but none are particularly important nor memorable.

The show tries to add some supernatural elements to the standard slice of life romcom anime but does so poorly. The fact that anime girl is engaged to a shapeshifting dog person is never explored in detail. Nor does the anime use that for comedic purposes. If the show never utilizes the bizarre nature of the situation, then what's the point? It just becomes an anime about a girl and a boy who can also shapshift, but never does. That's extreamly entertaining. Throughout the series the two leads never bond aside from dog person constantly saying he loves anime girl, but that's just lazy writing.

I don't think this the worst anime of all time or anything but it certainly is not good. The show is just so generic and run of the mill without any outstanding personality that I can not in good faith recommend this anime. If you are looking for a similar anime that does a romcom far better than this, then I'd recommend School Rumble.",1482451200,,2232,4.727506426735219

8685182,4,B00OWHZ8Y0,"What's more astounding, mystical ancient creatures taking human form to live among us, or an arranged marriage? Why the arranged marriage of course! Who does that anymore? We may never find out what exactly the demi-human characters are but then it would have to be called ""Engaged to the Identified"". It only gets better when one of the characters becomes obsessed with cryptids when she her self could be considered one. The irony is strong. But the main focus of the story isn't on the true identities of these characters but their sudden intrusion into the life of an average teenage girl who suddenly finds out she's been officially engaged to one of them, approved by their grandfather. Her mysterious fiance tries his best to earn her love when he already has her promised to him, and she has no idea how to feel about all of it. There's many funny moments in every episode and the youngest girl (pictured center on the cover) often steals every scene with her precocious attempts to be a proper lady. It's hard to compare this series to any other because, while it's composed mostly of motifs and tropes the viewer is already familiar with, they're combined in a new way that makes they whole concept very entertaining. Throw in a bit of slapstick and I found myself re-watching it immediately after finishing it.",1452384000,3,1321,4.747826086956522
