8568679,5,B00BHRTWGI,"Someone murders a prominent physician. The police lieutenant narrows the suspect down to a girl who had been dating the doctor. When he interviews the girl, he finds out she has an identical twin. The girls are uncooperative, he cant tell the difference, and his investigation fails. Great acting here and a great script. Olivia de Havilland convincingly plays  dual roles as the twin sisters. This film is a suspenseful, first-rate whodunit. For mastery fans or those who simply like a good movie, this is must see  viewing.",1519516800,,525,4.954545454545454
