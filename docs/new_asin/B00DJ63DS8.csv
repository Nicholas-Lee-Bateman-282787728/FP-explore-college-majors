5819410,4,B00DJ63DS8,"A very good movie or play and entertaining.  I like Christians movies and I look for them to look at for me to feel the spirit of the movie and hope that they carried GOds spirit all thru the movie.

There were some mishaps in the flow of the movie. Scenes did not flow well and several left us hanging because the scene did not finish out, and this one particular scene was powerful and they just let it drop and went to the 30 member choir singing when at choir rehearsal that was never more than 5 or 6 member rehearsing in the choir. 2 powerful moments of this movie was when the janitor came marching in with his minister robe on, all were surprised and as he spoke, it became powerful. He was a homeless pastor from Katrina/New Orleans. Buy they did not allow that scene and sermon continue, bec the next powerful scene was when the young man came walking in with his New Testament, holding it up to them and walking toward the pastor. And when he got there he should have been able to tell his testimony that the New Testament save his life from a bullet and it was logged in the bible. That never happened-scene played out and to let the young man give his FULL testimony.  Letting the church embrace him and pray over him and the janitor, who tried to stop him from going is now the pastor preaching. They let it all fall off. All that choir singing could have been out of the scene taking up scene time for the true story to be revealed. they switch from one scene to another with no flow.",1422835200,,1499,4.234265734265734
