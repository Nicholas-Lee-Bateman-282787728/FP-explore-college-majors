7909532,4,B00000I1WC,"There is actually a reason I gave this 4 stars, I'm not going to spew ""oh yay gore! 5 stars!"" or say ""I don't understand gore so this sucks 0/5"" I'm going to give you  straight up review of this single installment of the series. If you REALLY want to know what you're getting on this tape keep reading. WARNING SPOILERS!!!

YES! There's real gore. If you're reading this review you're probably new to ""death films"" or ""mondos""/""shockumentaries"" and the other spooky gross titles in this subsection of horror that only the most vile of gorehounds venture into (otherwise, you know what TOD is and I have no clue why you're reading this)... So if that's what you want in a film you'll find probably the best of it in the Traces of Death series. At least, you'll find MORE of it here than any other death-series.

I haven't seen (as I write this review) any other installments in the series YET so i don't know how well they compare but as far as this part goes it was about 40% human gore and then about 60% animal gore/animal fights/non-lethal accidents/circumcisions. As far as gore what do you need? You see people mangled and dismembered, it's grainy and sometimes hard to make out. You see some wonky autopsy footage, dead kids, the aftermath of a death squad, some supposed footage of the death-squad in action (though the cameraman has NO IDEA how to hold a camera straight so this footage is lame). The most memorable part was the aftermath of the death squad, mostly because it left a lot of morbid imagery to the imagination.

Then of course animal gore/fights. You see dog fights, you see poachers kill dolphins and make a mountain of their corpses, bull fights, chicken fights, and of course slaughter houses... The dolphins were the saddest part, but if you aren't prepared to be a little saddened then you probably wouldn't be reading this review. The animal gore wasn't what I came for though and that's why it deters me a bit. I came for human gore but animals take up a large chunk. After the animals we return to humans and witness about 10+ minutes worth of accidents at car/motorcycle races that are NOT lethal OR gory. In fact many of these clips look like Bob Sagget could be narrating them on America's Funniest Home Videos. I'm not saying people don't get hurt, but I don't think I saw a single death in that segment. Regardless, that was my favorite segment anyway, it was definitely the most intense as there was a lot of suspense seeing it for the first time and wondering who would be able to get up after flying off their motorcycle.

Then my least favorite part because it was SO LONG and SO IRRELEVANT. At LEAST 20+ minutes of male/female circumcision in a third world country. It's not gory, no one's life is in danger, it's long, there's nothing interesting about it. After about the 5th male circumcision I fast forwarded only to find another segment of female circumcision. I watched 1-2 of those and fast forwarded further trying to get back to what I paid for.

There were two other scenes that were lame and irrelevant but were so short I can't really complain too much... One was a press conference of sorts that was pushing a ban on pit bulls because a man was mauled by stray pit bulls. Being a dog lover and understanding the importance of training animals properly this part  mostly just made me mad. The other scene was a group of men with what seemed to be skeletal deformities playing kick-the-can and being very happy. It was actually a pretty happy scene seeing people with major handicaps being happy and such...

As far as the narrating goes there were some scenes where it was nice to have SOME context but you never get much. A few comments here and there. This isn't a traditional documentary, you're not going to learn too much, if anything.

Soundtrack: 1000/5 stars. I'm not even a big death/grind fan but I don't think I heard a single bad track on this movie. Plus the exclusive title-track by MORTICIAN is killer. I'd give this 3 stars but for the film but the soundtrack earns it another star so 4/5.

Conclusion:
If you want to see grainy stock footage of some gore, accidents and then some weird stuff while jamming out to an excellent soundtrack or are perhaps looking for a weird conversation piece or just something to gross yourself/friends out then pick this up. It's like five bucks so I'd say it's worth a risk. I'm just throwing it out there though, this is extremely dated, You can find better gore at this point in time on your average news station, youtube, or really any image sharing website that isn't made for kids. Still, I'll probably pick up more installments from this series just for the novelty factor.",1428883200,,4683,4.584229390681004
7909533,3,B00000I1WC,"I received my Vol. 3 tape Saturday, the video was ok. I watched it all the way through.  I felt sorry for the victums...  It's difficult to actually realize that things like that, do go on like that in the world.  But watching the video, (I don't want to sound morbid), but I didn't get the feeling, that I just couldn't bare watching anymore. Perhaps, thats due -to- not really getting emotionally into the video. Alot of the scenes went by pretty quick, and then it was onto another torture, or topic. I know I usually cry at sad movies, but then some movies bring you right into them, as though you were there, or knew the person.  I believe (in my opinion) the (?) music, or sounds in the background, although ear-ee, was sort of a  distraction. But it was ok..",1032134400,,765,4.359154929577465
