8248941,4,B00133KFNK,"I love the band and enjoy the direction and must be honest the show is in an akward place, Poland.  The audience only come alive near the end yet musicians are alive and enjoyable.

Any lover of Genesis, Marillion and Galahad will enjoy this band, and here I will include Tiles to be given a listen to.",1264550400,,302,4.280701754385965
8248942,5,B00133KFNK,"I'm like a kid in a candy store with all these great DVDs that I have. This one has some incredible performances including Ghostdances, Warriors and the classic Queen of the Deep. The whole band rocks and progs but special mention goes out to Niall Mathewson on guitar. He flat smoked his guitar on this night. This is the same venue of the Galahad concert. Metal Mind has been putting out some great DVDs.",1209168000,,406,4.5
