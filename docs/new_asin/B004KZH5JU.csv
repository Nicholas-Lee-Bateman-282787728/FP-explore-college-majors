8433627,5,B004KZH5JU,I received the dvd and it is just what I remember it as. This show was produced in the early fifties and early television. It is a bit corny and it is no star trek. For me I still enjoyed it.,1485820800,,191,3.682926829268293
8433628,3,B004KZH5JU,Some episodes unclear picture or very dark. Final episode a disappointment.,1419811200,,75,5.909090909090909
8433629,4,B004KZH5JU,Good story and special effects better than normal for the time period.  Just plain fun.,1410739200,,87,4.8
8433630,4,B004KZH5JU,"I opened the package and played the disc, made certain it contained the four episodes listed on the box: DEATH IN THE NEGATIVE, THE BREATH OF DEATH, THE LURE OF LIGHT and THE PLANET OF DEATH. The episodes indicated on the case are on the disc.

All three volumes put together by Alpha Home Entertainment contains four different episodes, regardless of what other reviewers have stated. If your DVD set duplicates, then you have duds.

The audio and video quality of the transferred discs and original, TV production values are *okay*, but the price is right. The stories are entertaining, and that's what counts. The series has nostalgic charm, and the humor is sometimes unintentional. The DVD's are somewhat rare, though, and these transfers will be difficult to find someday. I like the attractive packaging, too.",1399593600,,816,4.992647058823529
8433631,3,B004KZH5JU,"There were four episodes: Death in the Negative, The Breath of Death, The Lure of Light, and The Planet of Death.  But these episodes were available on other DVDs.  What about the rest of the 39 episode season?  I'd like to see all the episodes even if they are mangled.",1313366400,6,270,4.36
8433632,1,B004KZH5JU,"OK FLASH - one for you, 0 for me.  this volume 3 is the exact same chapters as volume 2.  How is that for getting ripped off?  Of course I forgive - but I won't forget.  Old Flash won't dup me again.  Like the saying goes,,, buyer beware.",1306108800,6,238,3.875
