5295740,2,B009A9BF5G,"LOVE LOVE Coldplay.  I went to their San Jose concert back in April.  The concert in this bluray was amazing and brings back memories when I saw them.

However, the bluray quality SUCKS.  The video looks grainy.  This is isn't bits and pieces, but the entire video on the bluray looks bad.  Here I was thinking it was going to look absolutely fantastic in HD, but instead it's a huge let down.  That and sometimes it sounds like they muted, or lowered the sound of the audience.  That's so disappointing.  The audience is part of the experience, no idea why they think it was beneficial to lower the sound of the audience.

Also, there's a lot of lights flashing everywhere and video fades.  If only the video could have focused more on the band itself playing and no so much on flashy lights and audience shots.  Oh and what's weird is that the bluray cover says ""Violet Hill"" is only on DVD, yet it's on the bluray?  Maybe they added the video last minute?

I wish I could give it 5 stars, but unfortunately I can't :(",1353283200,5,1020,4.385026737967914
5295743,2,B009A9BF5G,"Out of 500+ concerts, this year's tour by Coldplay blew me away and jumped into my top 5 immediately.  I flew to Dallas to see the show and then to Tampa, it was just so amazing and I am not the world's biggest Coldplay fan.  I cannot explain the euphoric feeling that was at these shows, especially with the lit up wristbands.

The Blu Ray is a complete let down.  I do not understand why people make concert films now that don't focus on one frame more than 2 seconds.  This Blu Ray could cause a seizure, as it basically snapshots of 2 seconds of different angles, audience shots and fireworks chained together for the length of the film.  I wanted to see the band play and I do like seeing the audience reaction, along with the stage show.  There were some amazing effects on this tour, and sadly you get to see tiny little clips here and there.  There's just no sense of cohesion to this ""film"".  I cannot get engaged with the band on stage because of the fast edits, nor can I get into the vibe of the audience for the same reason.

It's a shame, because this is probably one of the best ours that will ever grace a stadium.  It could have been spectacular.  I was wondering why this wasn't a 3D film as well because of the Stage Show and the Xylobands, but now I know.  It would cause people to vomit if it was in 3D.

The CD that comes with it is very good which is why I even gave it two stars.  Hopefully someday an actual cut of the concert that hasn't been butchered will appear somewhere.",1353283200,100,1501,4.199300699300699
5295745,5,B009A9BF5G,"This was the best concert that I had ever been to! I recieved the blu ray early from their main site along with the lithograph and I was more than excited to see the disc. It is not just a concert but also a documentary. It is very well arrange as the intermissions are played in between every 3 songs or so. The band talks about their experience with this tour and what they wanted to deliver to the audience. The concert and the intermissions are beautiful. It hits an emotional spot and reminds me why I was sad when there concert ended when I saw them in Dallas. I love the wrist band idea. It really does make the audience feel as if they are a part of the show and giving their own contribution to it. I find Coldplay to be very inspirational and I do hope that they will continue forever, if that were possible. This band has made a big impact on me and has a special place in my life. Be rebellious and get your spray cans everyone!",1353110400,,940,4.14207650273224
5295747,5,B009A9BF5G,"I saw the film tonight in a pre-release special event Coldplay held around the world at different movie theaters. Anyone could go, but only for this one night. It's the best concert film I've seen. Great pacing. Awesome setlist. Direction is perfect. Much variety. And the behind-the-scenes conversations are very thoughtful and surprisingly inspiring. I got teary eyed during ""Fix You."" I was wowed by the computer-controlled light-up bracelets during ""Charlie Brown."" Fascinating to hear how Chris Martin tries to look in the eyes of about 1,000 people during any concert, and how the band has a manager/fifth member (news to me) who studies rock history, including concert production history, and guides the band with advice about why the best bands in the world were the best when they were, what pitfalls to avoid, etc. Any Coldplay fan will LOVE THIS!!!",1352764800,14,859,5.099290780141844
5295748,1,B009A9BF5G,"Just arrived via UPS and it went right into PS3 and I am literally dumbfounded how bad this is. I have Glastonbury recorded to my DVR and NONE of this footage even comes close to HD footage, in fact it is worse than some home movies I have seen. Very grainy and the video is jumping all over the place. What in the world were they thinking when they produced this with the video jumping all over the place every second, it is nauseating. The music is probably the biggest disappointment considering this is BluRay and it should sound exceptional. Why in the world did you turn down all the backround noise from the live audience? Not only that you turned it down so much that the lead singers voice is not even clear it is muffled. Another thing I noticed was some of the footage was not synced correctly, in other words the video was not matched up with the audio and you could tell by reading lips. Then during the Glastonbury footage the music is not the same as what happened in the concert, it is different from the HD video I have recorded from PaladiaHD. This is a gigantic embarrassment for such a good band that has such great sounding live music to try and sell such a piece of garbage like this. Do yourself a favor and record the Glastonbury footage in HD and pass on this junk. Attempting to pass this off as something a professional produced is just laughable. I  also tried the CD which is ok I guess but still would be better with no modification at all and replayed as if it were live. Returning ASAP.",1352419200,11,1518,4.345070422535211

The audio mix is flat, muddy, unexciting and once again reminds me of a bad VHS recording (but without the hiss thankfully).  Absolutely incomprehensible as to why this is the look and sound that the producers actually aimed to achieve.

It was very disappointing (and pretty miserable due to the rain going to, and leaving Soldier Field) but what we did get to experience was really wonderful. My husband gave this DVD to me for my birthday and it's really well done, not only in terms of the concert performances, but the history and behind the scenes of what goes into their concerts from small venues to the huge stadium shows. If you are a fan, you will definitely enjoy this, and included is a CD of their music, so you can't go wrong. We have thoroughly enjoyed watching it several times over.",1475884800,2,717,4.318518518518519

5295801,5,B009A9BF5G,"This is a fantastic concert film! I had the privilege of attending a date on this tour and the show Coldplay put on was remarkable in the truest sense of the word. I've never seen anything like it nor have I ever been as engaged at a concert. The stages they put together for the shows say it all. I sat in the back of the arena, out of view only to realize a song or two in that the stage was circular. Just as I did, Chris Martin is in front of us with his back to the rest of the arena asking us if we're alright and thanking us for coming and putting up with being behind the stage. The attention they give to the fans is brilliant. The show was even better and the atmosphere was buzzing and glowing with Xylobands and the excitement. It's definitely a great feeling to be surrounded by 20,000 other people who are belting out Yellow with the band.

That feeling is translated so well onto film here. And the Bluray is even better. It looks crisp, the sound is clear and just how I remember it. There is a lot of grain in the filming and that might be the choice of the director or the result of filming in low-light, but it doesn't impact the quality of this release.

I think the best moment from this tour is when the Xylobands start to go off and all 20,000 people seem to be standing and waving their arms. It must have been quite a spectacle for the band and it's made to be quite a spectacle in this film. I highly encourage a viewing.",1422489600,2,1447,4.109540636042403

Coldplay are so amazing in concert, I watched this hoping to relieve the concert I was lucky enough to attend on the Mylo Xyloto tour.  Unfortunately the video manages to overshadow the music with incessant cutting to different views and angles during songs that left me a little dizzy.  It seems that no camera angle is held for more than a second before jumping to another.  Guess I will have to wait until the next tour for an enjoyable recent concert video from one of my favorite bands.

Even running the my best video processors, the what-I-assume to be intentionally grainy picture makes the concert very difficult to watch on my 60"" HD flatscreen pushed via an OPPO BD player and thru a Marantz AV processor.

Having seen previous Coldplay concerts in glorious HD back in 2007 on HDNet, what made them brilliant was the stage production captured by crystal clear camerawork. With the Coldplay: Live 2012 BD I find myself removing my glasses to soften the effect of the grainy picture.

What about the band? What do you feel when all is said and done? And the answer is, with all its flaws, the CD/DVD brings to the forefront the emotional power of this unique band.  The way they connect with audiences is amazing; bands like Rush come to mind.  The people who come to Coldplay concerts feel almost a religious transformation.  I know that all the tech heads, including myself, wish that audio/video decisions would be smarter, less gratuitous,and perhaps better chosen, but let's face it; this is obviously what the band felt comfortable releasing to their fans.

You never get the sense that you're there, or that you know what the concerts are like.  It's just these blurry, grainy action shots with splashes of weird neon texts at points.  Further, the audio is very poorly mixed.  You can barely hear any of the vocals on any of the songs.  The instruments come through extremely clear, but even this to me was a downside, because it didn't feel like I was watching a concert.  It sounded like it was a studio mix with some audience noise thrown in afterwards.

The artist ""interviews"" (soliloquys) between songs also rubbed me the wrong way.  The last thing I want to hear between this poor audio and video is how much these guys made on tour and how great they have it.

This DVD is neither a good rock concert or a good documentary.  Also, the quality of the picture is awfull.  I bought at the same time Led Zeppelin Celebration Day, it's a million time better.  I was at Coldplay concert in Montreal July 27th and that DVD doesn't capture the essence of this show which was one of the top 5 show I've ever seen.  So disapointing!  Hopefully, the band will reconsider and release the full show instead.  What would be great would be a package with the 3 type of shows (stadium = Stade de France, arena = Bell Centre & small venue = la Cigale).  Coldplay announced that they will take a 3 year break, hopefully they will fufill my wish by the time of the next tour.  The only reason to buy that DVD is the audio CD, but even that it is missing some song.

I've been spending the past hour downloading different blu ray media players. I thought it was all these players and it's a real shame that I won't be able to complain about the bad shots, cinematography and etc because I will not watch a blu-ray in what appears to be even less than the DVD standards of today.

I will keep this for the live CD, but this is the biggest disappointment as a Coldplay fan right next to the awful performance at this years Grammys, and the soon to be released MX comic series(looks plain stupid).

I do not recommend getting the blu-ray version(nor the DVD) and just get the live CD version. Though if grain is not a problem and you don't usually notice the mediocrity in capturing and encoding in what is supposed to be high-quality video then go for it.",1353456000,14,919,4.524096385542169

5295936,3,B009A9BF5G,"With this being their first major concert video release in almost ten years, I was expecting greatness.  I was disappointed.  The blu ray disc would not play on one of my machines that is three years old, but it did play on another that is one year old.  The crappy video and audio production could not disguise the fact that it's a recording of one of the greatest rock bands of their generation.  As such, this DVD will probably be good enough for their millions of fans around the world.  Sadly, on the global scale of concert videos, it's pretty poor.  The video editing is junk, with just a bunch of quick takes of the flashiest particular moment, and no artistry.  The audio quality is okay, but not exceptional.  For comparison, I would consider the audio quality on John Mayer's ""Where the Light Is"" to be exceptional.  This DVD doesn't even come close to that.  So for die hard Coldplay fans, might as well go ahead and buy it.  It's a documentary of a great band at the height of their musical powers.  If you're not an avid Coldplay fan, this set isn't likely to turn you into one.  The thirty dollars would be better spent on three of their audio CD's - doesn't matter which, that's up to your personal taste.  X&Y was my favorite.",1353369600,6,1243,4.442477876106195
5295937,4,B009A9BF5G,"Coldplay's first new live release since the Sidney, Australia, 2003 DVD is a welcome one, albeit a completely different type of live release. Where ""Live 2003"" was the entire night of an Australian show on the Rush of Blood to the Head tour, ""Coldplay Live 2012"" was shot at several venues and incorporates elements of a film/documentary instead, with five insightful interviews with the band members dotted throughout the ""set list"" as ""intermissions"".

High marks for the Blu-ray, which was released in scope format and will have black bars at the top and bottom of your screen even if you're watching on a 16:9 widescreen HDTV. This IS normal, no need to try and adjust your set. Coldplay released this in the cinemas for a short engagement and that is likely the reason behind the aspect ratio choice, although I would have welcomed it being released re-cut to 16:9 for home video release given that it is a concert film and no real loss would have occurred unlike what can happen with movies or TV shows. The cover incorrectly lists the aspect ratio as 16:9, but it is actually 2.39:1. Picture quality was stable throughout and it wasn't until the credits that I noticed a strange anomaly with some blurring. Luckily it's redundant as you don't really care about this part of the Blu-ray. The entire program looks good outside of this. Some Alexa cameras were used in the Stade footage which looks particularly clean, there is obviously a mix of different cameras used which means you'll see some grain here and there from the ones being shot on film. Thankfully EMI chose not to scrub this out with over-zealous digital noise reduction which would have further reduced the high frequency detail Blu-ray is capable of resolving.

The 5.1 dts-HD Master Audio track throughout is very capable, fidelity is great and the sound of a live venue is accurately captured through the ambience of the rear speakers. The running time of a Coldplay show is likely a little longer given that they usually take the stage at 9pm and play until 11pm. It's a shame they couldn't include a full evening's worth of songs on here as a special ""director's cut"".  For example, looking up the setlist for the Montreal show featured in the program shows that 21 songs were played that night. With the dual layer 50GB Blu-ray they used for this release they could have easily fit more songs on to give a full tour, or included the ones they didn't want to use in the film as extras. There are only two extra songs included in the ""Extras"" section, where are the rest of the songs they played on this tour? It was in the extras watching ""The Scientist"" (note the extra two songs don't offer 5.1 surround options) that I noticed some pixelation during the lighting which is quite busy. Perhaps they could have used some additional passes in the encoding?

My favorite of the new Coldplay tracks from Mylo Xyloto is here, Major Minus. This song reminds me most of Coldplay around the Rush of Blood days, with a little influence from ""The Verve"". Coldplay are on good form here, every song is exciting to listen to but what really pushed this release to the 4-star mark for me, overcoming the lack of sheer concert footage included, were the excellent intermissions giving a candid look at the band on the road. The 1st intermission was my favorite, with Martin describing what it's like just before you go on stage and what gets him motivated and excited for every single performance. The other intermissions are also well worth watching of course, as usually you only get to hear Chris Martin predominantly in Coldplay interviews. Here each member gets their own intermission segment before a final one again with Martin. I really enjoyed hearing Guy talk as he's the one you usually hear the least from. The wristband segment was really fun to watch and looks amazing on this Blu-ray. One of the biggest flaws of this is how busy the camera shots can be during certain songs. You want to pay attention to what's going on but the director decides you need to ""feel"" the busy parts of the song by going to quick scene shots. When you're at the concert, do you start darting your eyes from left to right about the stage, panning around to quickly look at the audience, back to Guy, quickly to Will, Chris, back to audience? If not then why would people include this as a style? It's bad enough in the movies, it should be intolerable in a concert release. Coldplay are not The Prodigy. Fortunately there are songs in here that don't suffer as badly. I though God Put A Smile was one of the worst. Also, you can shut the picture off and just enjoy the 24-bit/48kHz dts-HD Master Audio surround mix with your eyes closed, luckily they don't pan the surround mix like they do the picture, as you would in a movie. Wouldn't that make you vomit?

The CD's unfortunately don't fare well with audio quality like the Blu-ray did. The Blu-ray is thankfully free of egregious dynamic range compression, otherwise known as the ""loudness wars"". You can enjoy this dynamic performance in your home theater and turn it up. The CD's are already cranked and the dynamic range has been strongly reduced. If you can find a way to extract the 24-bit PCM stereo track from the Blu-ray and dither it to 16-bits and 44.1kHz sampling rate and burn that to CD it will sound much better than the included CD. Still, you're buying this for the Blu-ray and thus it's still a 4-star release.

This is a good Blu-ray release, good set list, great performance and has above average audio and video. I'd recommend it to new and old fans of the band.",1353369600,33,5594,4.6454545454545455
5295938,3,B009A9BF5G,"After two complete viewings, I wondered for a while if I'd received the SD-DVD version by mistake.  I don't buy very many Blu-ray discs, but I do know what to expect in terms of quality with those I have purchased. I was immediately struck with the ""graininess"" that pervades this production.  After assuring myself that I had everything set right, I came to realize that what I was seeing is apparently a conscious, production choice.  The actual camera work with the unbelievable angles they pull off is stunning.  It just seems to be an odd mix with this throw-back, 8mm home-movie camera video motif.  They do call it a ""film"" after all, so if a 1960's film effect is what the director was after, they succeeded.

The audio production comes closer to living up to what I'd expect from a Dolby 5.1 Blu-ray disc.  Keeping in mind that this isn't a pure ""concert"" video, expect some heavy-handedness in the audio mixing.  At times the ""live"" concert sounds purely balanced, but other times it's clear that there's some production assistance being rendered.  Coldplay is known for its liberal use of backing tracks in concerts and it seems like there's even more post-production manipulation of the backing track components in Live 2012.  The net result actually sounds better than what I heard live when I saw Coldplay in concert during this tour, where the bass and percussion were predominant in the house mix.  On the other hand, it didn't sound as ""live"" as Coldplay's Live 2003 DVD.

The band's performances on this film are generally good and at times exceptional.  The highlight performances are Hurts Like Heaven, Yellow (primarily because of its baroque-ish opening), Up in Flames (this band works subtle wonders in alternative unplugged sets), Us Against the World (best harmonies I've heard between Will and Chris... Will actually finishes the final two solo verses of this song showing an incredible tonal range), Fix You is the best live version of the song I've ever heard because the band stays more faithful to the character of the song and you can hear each of their contributions to the 4-part harmony in the final two choruses.  The ""Extra"" versions of Don't Let it Break Your Heart and The Scientist are also stellar moments.  It's too bad that there's not a way to patch them into the film where they belong in the setlist.

Each band member has an intermission in which they share their musings about the current state of the band.  There's nothing really heavy-hitting there, but it does give the observer a better look at the personalities of Chris, Guy, Jonny, and Will.  There's also some delightful ""airy"" versions of Coldplay songs that play in the background during these monologues.  I would love to have had these airy versions of all the songs played as an audio bonus.  These intermissions were vital in helping sell this production as a sort of documentary film rather than a pure concert video.

A few other random notes in closing; I'm not a fan of 'The Princess of China', but the version included in this film from Paris actually made the song tolerable.  The percussion is usually so heavily distorted that it dominates the song, but it's more in balance here.  It also doesn't hurt that Rihanna makes an in the flesh appearance, tastefully donned in fitting attire, for her part in the song.  There's an interesting bit of chemistry taking place between Rihanna and Chris as the song winds down, with Chris finally having to deflect Rihanna's exploring hand, while not rebuffing here strongly enough to break the interlocked microphone intimacy they shared for the closing moments.  Clocks is my favorite song of all time, but I'd have to say that this is the weakest version of Clocks I've ever seen or heard Coldplay perform.  The Live 2003 version runs circles around it. I don't like the oddly distorted instrumental break in the middle, versus the pared-down reprise of the haunting piano intro of the 2003 Live and studio versions. It also sounds like they prematurely bail out on the wind-down of Clocks. It loses so much of its character in that it doesn't reach its deserved conclusion, IMO.

Finally, I was disappointed to learn that my favorite song from the MX Tour concert I saw - Warning Sign - is not part of the package, nor is the satellite stage acoustic version of Speed of Sound.  These two songs help show the versatility of the band and it's surprising to see that they didn't make the cut.  Even with the grainy quality of the video, I'd be close to awarding the disc 5 stars if they'd had included Warning Sign and SOS.",1353369600,4,4584,4.767088607594936
