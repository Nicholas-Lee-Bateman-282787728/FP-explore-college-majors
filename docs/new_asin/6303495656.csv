8324252,2,6303495656,"while I do like the movie and all the books the asking price here for a used copy of this movie is ridiculous. I'm not going to spend almost 900 dollars for a movie that shouldn't cost more than 40 dollars. regardless of where the movie is being sold from, an asking price of almost 900 dollars is too much for anyone to spend on a movie.",1265587200,3,338,4.059701492537314
8324253,5,6303495656,"A 6 yr old ""highly energetic"" boy and a 9 year old ""sophisticated"" girl were both riveted by this beautiful film. Unique adventures, sympathetic characters and a fabulous location make this  faithful rendering of Arthur Ransome's book a joy to watch. But be warned:  I know kids who have been seriously inspired by this story!",954720000,8,326,4.909090909090909
