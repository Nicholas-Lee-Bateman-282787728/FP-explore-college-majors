8066484,5,B0009TSF2M,"This is an excellent account of the man that is Star Trek! The Great Bird of the Gallaxy was and still is Gene Roddenberry! A lot of Star Trek fans know that he created the show that became a franchise. This account tells of the man himself. Pilot in World War II and for an airline. Police officer for Los Angeles. Writer of other shows before Star Trek.

A must see for any fan of the show. A chance to know the man himself. I'm very happy to own this document of a man who was more than the one who dreamt of a better future! This account also tells of the beginnings of Star Trek! Star Trek Lives! There is no ending.",1282694400,,621,4.048780487804878
