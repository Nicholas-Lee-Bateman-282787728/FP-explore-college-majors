7866959,5,6304288875,"Our daughter loved this video from the time she was eight months old.  At that time she responded to the music and the movements.  Now at 18 months she pipes up ""lello"" and ""pink"" during the approriate  sections.  Our son knew all his colors before he was three--in part because  of this engaging video.  I won't belabor the educational value of this  video (and the others in the series), but it's a lot better than mindless  cartoons.  And I even found that I didn't mind watching it with the kids  myself, talking about the different colors and shapes.",944870400,9,555,4.571428571428571
