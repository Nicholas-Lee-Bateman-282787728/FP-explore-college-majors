8523577,3,B00807308O,"I think certain episodes of this cartoon are funny and amusing. My grandkids (who are less picky) love them all. Overall, I find the writing witty and the animation bearable. My grandson was very happy with this dvd as part of his birthday present. He loves anything to do with a super hero!",1370736000,,291,4.509433962264151
8523578,5,B00807308O,"Okay so first off I should say that this DVD was watched by my 4 and 5 year old sons.  They don't care (or realize) it was a teleevsion series so it didn't matter to them that the order or that this was the final chapters of the series.  They watch it because they love Super Heroes and this DVD features more bubbly and kid-friendly Super Heroes.  The Heroes are not thin comic-book animation but rather bright and small versions, you have to see it to understand.  I think they are cute, my boys think they are hysterical.  The episodes do feature fighting and bad guys but nothing scary or really in-appropriate for young kids.  They are Super Heroes too so they are saving the day in each episode!  Overall, this is a cute series and keeps my boys entertained.",1344988800,4,764,4.414285714285715
8523579,3,B00807308O,"I have been enjoying this funny and colorful series, which is odd because I do not even like super heroes. The plot has finally reached its climax, and I have enjoyed every second of the funny episodes. The last two episodes however, were plain confusing and did not make much sense. I think they were trying a little too hard to come up with corny jokes and did not really focus on the ending. Even with the last few episodes not making much sense, the rest were top notch in comedy and action. I just can not stand how the entire series was almost ruined for me when I could not figure out the end.",1341964800,,600,4.226086956521739
