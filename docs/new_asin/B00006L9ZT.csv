But as other reviewers have pointed out, often the acting is poor, just meandering around stage. This is especially a problem for the Siegfried. Still, given a choice between this Metropolitan production and the kinky Centenary Ring from Bayreuth, I would take this one without hesitation.

1783990,5,B00006L9ZT,"Many Wagner snobs may decry the traditional staging - but what use is modern new wave stagings unless you have seen the orginal first.  is it helpful for a first time Ring viewer to see Valkyries on bicycles for example.  As most people will not have seen the ring on stage this traditional version must be welcome.
I loved Levines thoughtful reflective reading on the music score.  The singer is as good as it can be - all the big Wagner stars were in this production.  It may not compare with the great cast ensembled for Solti landmark audio recording but what can?
For those of us who cannot understand German the subtitle is a godsend).  My understanding of Wagner has made a quantum leap!  The importance of subtitles cannot be underestimated for this work because the total integration of words and music.  In fact even if you can follow German I think that you would understand it better with the subtitles (in German).
The sound is superb esp in DTS - better then the CDs of either Barenboim or Solti.  One other great thing about DVD and Wagner is that only two DVD are needed for each opera.  So you can listen to your favorite bits without the hassle of changing DVD
After the release of this DVD I do not think I will ever listen to my CDs again.  I probably want even bother seeing the Ring again on stage!
Highly recommened",1037145600,57,1338,4.44672131147541
1783991,2,B00006L9ZT,"Given the paucity of dvds for Wagner's Ring cycle, this release of the complete Metropolitan Opera production should theoretically be welcomed, especially for lovers of traditional staging. Indeed, the staging is a naturalistic one which no only is rather loyal to Wagner's original intentions but can also highlight the universality of this epic drama.
Unfortunately, while I like the setting for the operas, the direction itself is quite unimaginative. At times, the singers are left all on their own such that they have to resort to repeating some stock operatic gestures. Some may consider the result to be dramatically pallid and even boring at times. Traditional productions certainly aren't mean't to be static or stylised!
Actually, the most disappointing facet of the production is in the performance. While no one should expect that any present-day casting of the Ring cycle can reach the lofty standards of yester-years, the singing is often merely adequate. This is not helped by the wooden acting of some of the performers. James Morris's Wotan is in splendid voice, but his acting is sketchy. Christa Ludwig is past her prime as Fricka, but her performance still possess great authority. Gary Lakes is a rough Siegmund while Jessye Norman is a vocally gorgeous but stage-wise unconvincing Sieglinde. Siegfried Jerusalem is probably as good as one can get for Siegfried these days, his singing full of sensitivity and poise even though he is not a heldentenor in the traditional mould. Hildgard Behrens, sorely taxed by the music of Brunnhilde, is a big disappointment, for her voice sounds threatbare at times, especially in the middle and lower registers and she is unable to ride the big vocal climaxes with ease.
The Orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera produces great sounds in the pit and every section deserves the greatest of praise. Levine, of course, is their admirable conductor, although I sometimes find the forward momentum sagging a little from time to time, especially in Siegfried and Gotterdammerung.
As I tend to focus more on the singers than the orchestra in opera, I must say that I'm quite disappointed by what I hear on this dvd set. Although I still think that the set is worth getting (every release of a complete Ring cycle is an event), I can't help feeling that the production has been let down by the singers as well as some stolid stage direction.",1036627200,47,2390,5.0226700251889165

1783995,2,B00006L9ZT,"The singing is mixed with some very good and some sub-par soloists.  The orchestral playing is superb.  The stage direction is from hell.  I sat through this production at the Met a few times some 10-20 years ago.  It took me a while to get into Levine's slow pacing.  But after a while it clicked and made sense.  He stays just clear of indulgence, and I appreciate his taking a risk here.  Ultimately, to me, the staging makes this unbearable.  I remember being dumbfounded of how pedantic it felt.  I was waiting for a miniature train to suddenly appear and roar through the landscape.  Rheingold was the worst.  A dimly lit fish tank.  Altogether, a Disney version of the Ring that strives for some pedestrian notion of authenticity, totally missing the point that authenticity means something deeper than following Wagner's staging instructions by the letter.  The staging sucked oxygen out of the Ring the way Christo managed to suck oxygen out of Central Park with his orange gates.

1783996,5,B00006L9ZT,"I saw this production of the Ring when it showed on PBS in 1990, and Ive owned the videotape edition for some years. Finally breaking down and acquiring the DVD, with superior picture and sound, inspired me to write a review.
Logically, it would seem strange that an opera production based on the composers precise and detailed stage directions should be viewed as controversial, But that was the case with this Met Ring, filmed in 1990. As we all learned in Music History, Wagners artistic ideal, especially in the Ring, was the Gesamtkunstwerk, the total work of art, with all elements blending into a greater whole. His stage directions were considered as important as the words and music. But since World War II is has been a rare director that paid any attention to what Wagner wrote. Some productions were worthwhile - for example the one mounted by Wagners grandson Wieland for the reopening of the Bayreuth Festival in 1951. It replaced a traditional representative staging with an abstract one, featuring measured, almost ritualistic movement and a very innovative use of lighting, without violating the spirit of the original.. But what we mostly got was directors who made the wrong assumption that they were creative, rather than re-creative, artists, and used Wagner as a vehicle to foist upon us their own psychological, sexual, and political hangups. Part of the problem was that most had little or no musical training. I know from personal experience that a director who is not a musician cannot comprehend how music functions in an opera, articulating and interpreting what happens on stage. Unfortunately, the critics jumped on the bandwagon to support this directorial self-indulgence. Especially in Europe a production without a concept is ridiculed. I have a very sad book about the 1983 Bayreuth Festival, for which the great English director Peter Hall set out to mount a representational Ring, using technology borrowed from the film industry to realize Wagners effects. He was obstructed by the administration and savaged by the critics, and neither he nor conductor Georg Solti returned to the festival. The English writer Barry Millington, an alleged Wagner expert, noted that this Met production is of interest only to those for whom the theater is not a cerebral activity. Well, it seems to me that  its more of a cerebral activity to see what an author wrote and interpret it oneself than to be beaten over the head with some directors half-baked idea of what it all means.
Be all this as it may, this production takes Wagners stage directions seriously and realizes them through beautiful, representational designs in a thoroughly Romantic style. For me, it works beautifully. Every time the curtain rose I thought Thats precisely what Ive been reading in the score and seeing in my minds eye for years.
Fortunately, the production is musically excellent as well. James Levine has never been my idea of a great Wagner conductor; he seems more comfortable in Italian opera.. His Ring could charitably be described as eclectic - he takes Soltis tempo here, Furtwnglers in another place, Karajans in another. And he consistently seems to equate increased speed with excitement, a mistake seldom made by the older Wagner conductors. But he does nothing objectionable, he supports his singers sympathetically, and he draws beautiful playing from the Met orchestra. And he rises to the challenge of the most difficult operas, Siegfried and Gtterdmmerung with effective pacing and good control of the long structural line. The cast is about the best that could have been assembled at the time and is consistently excellent. Hildegard Behrens was a legitimate Brnnhilde in vocal terms, and, unlike many of her predecessors, was a fine actress and looked young and attractive on stage. Siegfried was sung by the appropriately-named Siegfried Jerusalem. He sang the role only for a short time, and it would be silly to compare him to Melchior or even Suthaus or Windgassen. But his voice had the right color and still had a youthful bloom; he was also a sensitive, intelligent musician, and his stamina was most impressive. He also doubled as an effective Loge in Das Rheingold. James Morris was a fine Wotan, looking the part and singing powerfully and intelligently. Ekkehard Wlaschiha was a fine Alberich, singing rather than barking the music and creating a thoroughly evil character - as did Matti Salminen as Hagen. Jessye Norman sang gloriously as Sieglinde and was more into the character on stage than in her earlier audio recording. Gary Lakes was not a great Siegmund, but he sang the music reasonably well and was large enough to partner Norman convincingly. It was good to see the veteran Christa Ludwig, still singing and acting well, as Fricka and Waltraute. Kurt Moll was a definitive Hunding and Heinz Zednik a brilliant Mime.
If you want a Ring that presents something close to what Wagner intended, this one is recommended.
The only other video Ring Ive seen is the Bayreuth Centennial production of 1976, staged by Patrice Chereau and conducted by Pierre Boulez. Chereau had the interesting idea of setting the Ring at the time it was written, the mid-nineteenth century, which allowed him to emphasize the social and political subtext. Not that this was anything new; in the 1890s Bernard Shaw published a little book called The Perfect Wagnerite, in which he brilliantly analyzed the Ring in terms of radical politics. Chereaus problems are with the detail. He show himself as another non-musician director who makes hash of Wagners stagecraft. He seems unwilling or unable to hear what the music clearly tells us, and he consistently misses obvious musical cues. He is not helped by his proclivity for filling the stage with people, whether justified or not. The cast is no great shakes, either, and the better performances are more notable for acting than singing. There are some good moments, usually when Chereau leaves the singers alone and allows them to use their skills. For example, Gwyneth Jones and Donald McIntyre make the end of Die Walkre a beautiful and moving scene, abetted by a particularly felicitous stage setting. But these moments are usually overshadowed by the general ineptitude of the production.
The conducting is also problematic. As much as I admire Boulez as a musician, Wagner was never his metier. He announced before this production that he planned to cleanse the Ring of bad old tradition. But old tradition is not necessarily bad, and Boulez tends to throw the baby out with the bathwater. To his credit, he induces a less-than-great orchestra to play with remarkable precision and tonal beauty. But his light, clear, swift performance robs the music of its power and grandeur; he positively races through the big moments, as though embarrassed by them.",1451001600,22,6831,5.050487156775908

1784015,5,B00006L9ZT,"While not the best Ring ever recorded (for those, go to the two live 1953 cycles conducted respectively by Joseph Keiberth and Clemens Krauss, with Martha Moedl and Astrid Varnay as the respective Bruennhildes; the Krauss/Varany has received much more press and circulation, but I prefer Keilberth/Moedl), it is far and away the best-sung and best-staged Ring on DVD.  Thankfully, no Eurotrash or Regietheater staging here -- just beautifully rendered, totally realistic sets by master designer Otto Schenck.  If not quite a Golden Age cast vocally, it is a very fine one -- real singing, no Sprechgesang and barking.  James Morris a bit dry-voiced as Wotan, but still authoritative.  Hildegard Behrens is stretched to her limits as Bruennhilde, but she manages to get through it all creditably.  Gary Lakes and Jessye Norman make a fine and stalwart (if not absolutely electrifying) pair of twins.  It's wonderful to have a tenor of the caliber of Siegfried Jerusalem as Loge and the two Siegfrieds (and one look actually looks the latter part), even if he does tire by the latter part of Act III of his eponymous opera.  Heinz Zednik does not match Paul Kuen at Bayreuth in the 1950s, but is a reasonably effective Mime.  Ekkehard Wlaschiha has a coarser voice than did Gustav Neidlinger, but is a potent Alberich.  Matti Salminen and Kurt Moll excel in the villainous bass roles they assume.  Even in the twilight years of her career, Christa Ludwig is a splendid vocal presence as Fricka and Waltraute.  All the smaller roles are well taken.  Levine's conducting is slow at times, though not so much as, say, Knappertsbusch, and he deserves credit for making the Met orchestra into a real professional ensemble instead of a scrappy pit band.

As for the complainers here -- what, in all seriousness, do they suggest for an alternative on DVD?  I've seen pretty much every other one, and both singing and staging in those are grossly, even laughably, inferior to what is offered here.

PS: For a hilarious goof not able to be edited out, watch in Act II of Goetterdaemmerung for the point where Siegfried Jerusalem loses the ring off his finger when it gets snagged in Hildegard Behrens' dress.  You'll see Jerusalem's hand without the ring on it, and then he sidles up to Behrens and digs in the folds of her dress to get the ring back on his finger while still singing his lines without missing a beat.

The Alberich, Mime, and Hunding are exceptional and would rate with any performer of the past.  And the other cast members are all more than adequate.  But for a traditional staging on video, this is not merely the BEST version, it is the ONLY version out there.  It's the closest by far to what the composer would have expected.  And the conducting is particularly excellent.

I would like to bring up the frequently mentioned topic of tempo.  Other reviewers have asserted that Levine's tempi are too slow.  Out of the whole Ring cycle I noticed very few places that were markedly slower than other mainstream recordings.  One example offhand would be the entrance of the giants in Rheingold.  Even there the tempo seemed musically and dramatically correct to me.  On the other hand, Levine was a bit brisk elsewhere.  The entire Wintersturm scene (to end of Walkure Act I) was almost too fast to recognize.  Compare to the benchmark Bruno Walter 1933 recording with Melchior (I don't mean compare voices, just compare tempo).  Where are these slow tempos?

Minor quibbles aside, I have loved this performance since taping it from PBS in 1990.  Very happy to have replaced those worn-out tapes with new DVDs :)  Sure, I enjoy Solti, Bohm, and Furtwangler audio, but would not want any but a traditional production on video.

1784028,5,B00006L9ZT,"Starting with the general: If I could own only one copy of the Ring Cycle, it would be this one. Why? It's the one most true to Wagner's original intent, which is not to say that it's perfect. It does have some less than perfect moments. The good and the bad are, in some respects, intertwined and from the same causes.
  The stage scenery makes excellent use of technology, while remaining true to realistic representations of the era and area.
  Because this rendition is so true to Wagner's original, it eschews the glitzy types of special effects, while still using current technology, to improve the representations and moods Wagner was trying to present. Could it have made better and/or more frequent use of technology, while still remaining true to the author's intent? Yes.
  Let's dissect the opera, using examples, from each of its parts.
  In Das Rheingold, technology is used, very effectively, to represent the underwater environment of the Rhine Maidens, as well as the caves of the Neibelung and the depiction of Valhalla, without compromising the story line or its effective representation.
  When we get to Die Walkre, technology is properly used, in some instances, such as:
  1) to provide realistic, yet true-to-form, representations of Hunding's hearth,
  2) detailed scenery, for the battle scene, between Hunding and Siegmund and
  3) the firewall, surrounding Brnnhilde's mountaintop banishment stead.
  My first reaction, upon seeing Hildegard Behrens, in the part of Brnnhilde, was that she did not have the physical stature to pull it off. Was I mistaken! While she is not of Amazonian stature, her acting more than made the role believable and she carried it off, without a hitch.
  Technology could, also, have been better used, to represent ""the ride,"" more in concert with Wagner's vision of the Valkyries' ethereal and high-energy movements. In that travesty version of The Ring Cycle (you know, the one with the ""moving fingers wall""), the one positive aspect was the vision applied to ""the ride,"" which gave it a sense of forward movement and charging steeds. The best ""ride,"" however, is still the one in which the Valkyries are mounted, on steeds, then projected, ghost-like, on the screen, as a semi-transparent overlay. That version, in my opinion, provides the nearest thing to Wagner's true intent, although the technology of his day didn't and couldn't provide that view. That technology was used, with much less impact, in Siegfried, to represent Erda, when she was reawakened, by Wotan. Why not use it in ""the ride?""
  Moving on, to Siegfried, the depiction of Mime's cave is a good use of technology, while technology seems to have been completely forgotten, when we get to the depiction of Fafner, as a dragon. That dragon looked more like a genetic cross, between a spider and a crab, with a tail.
  Lastly, we've arrived at Gtterdmmerung. It was performed almost flawlessly. The scene of Siegfried's murder, his wake and funeral were excellently portrayed, as was Hagen's unmasking, as the ultimate culprit and schemer. The only thing, which I think could have made it better, would have been to see Brnnhilde ride into Siegfried's funeral pyre, mounted on Grane, rather than jumping into it.
  Just as an aside: I find it ironic that James Levine should become the most potent and accurate interpreter, within the last 100 years, of the music of a virulently anti-Semite, such as was Wagner.",1381795200,8,3440,5.022927689594356

1784030,5,B00006L9ZT,"From the opening desperate scenes to the closing trumpets blaring, Part One of Wagner's Ring, ""Das Rheingold"" shines with music, majesty, masculinity, and monstrosities.  This opera is soaring when it needs to soar, is subdued when it needs to be subdued and is mezzo-fortissimo when it needs to be mezzo-fortissimo.  The singing is perfect and profound while the costumes and scenery are lavish and likeable.  The whole production is earthy with plenty of raw emotion and yet other-worldly with much spiritual angst.  Although there are female roles in this opera, the overall tone reverberates with dark, brooding, manly Teutonic energy.  The offstage singing chorus gives the end of ""Das Rheingold"" a warm and angelic feel that is quite endearing as both heroine and hero walk off toward a distant rainbow.  With its emphasis on universalism rather than strictly German nationalism, ""Das Rheingold"" is both operatic prologue and template for the remaining three parts to the Ring which reaches its apotheosis only when human foibles come squarely up against the petulant whims of the supernatural.  This Wagner Ring production by the Metropolitan Opera is boldly original and sweepingly imaginative and will likely be cherished as an operatic classic.

Frenetic orchestral music as only Wagner could compose begins Part 2 of his Ring Cycle, ""Die Walkure."" In this production, the singing is both flawless and finicky and serious and sublime. The costumes and setting are ruggedly rustic and ruthlessly retrograde.  The Promethean sounds of ""Ride of the Valkyries"" permeate Act 2 in this opera that reaches heights of grandiose greatness and depths of subterranean sublimity.  The whole production is important both subconsciously and subcutaneously as both mind and body become awash in this operatic opium.  Swords and spears figure prominently in this production as symbols of male, and sometimes female, power, leading to both ecstasy and joy in Act 1 and frustration and forlornness in Act 2.  The spear symbol dominates the conclusion of Act 2 as the lead characters confront each other with them, leading to the death of one after a struggle. Act 3 concludes with a return of the lusty ""Ride of the Valkyries"" and a lusty onstage tryst followed by an all-consuming fire.

For these who grew up with the culture of classics -operas and operettas, is Der Ring des Nibelungen an gift from heaven.
It saddens me that this kind of culture is still privileged only to so called upper class in America.
I am German and we were raised in this culture from childhood on. We have also "" Kinder Operas "" ( for children. )
It would be helpful for today's youth be educated in that direction.

I have to admit that I taped those performaces and have watched them several times since then.  Alas!  VHS tapes degrade woefully over 20 years.  I thoroughly enjoyed these performances then and I thoroughly enjoy them now.

I am not an opera wonk so I am sure that there are lots of refinements that escape me as to these performances, or any other for that matter.  But I find these to be wonderful productions. These are not in the least ""quirky"" like some I have seen.  Throughout the voices are solid, as actors the performers are engaging, their voices are as good as any I have heard in these roles, and the costuming and staging are both imaginative and effective.  Maestro Levine gets a rich and energetic performance out of his orchestra - especially important with Wagner, in my opinion.

The recordings are very good.  Captioning is available in English, German, and French.  I have watched it with the English captions and with the German captions - not that I understand German but I like to be able to see the actual words as they are being sung.  One minor glitch:  On the disc for Das Rheingold there seems to be a repetition of one part of a scene of a ""conversation"" between Wotan and Loge.

1784048,4,B00006L9ZT,"If I had to choose an opera that I consider to be my personal favorite, it would have to be Richard Wagner's Der Ring Des Nibelungen (or The Ring Cycle for short). Some people may be put off by its incredibly long length (a total of fourteen to fifteen hours worth of music), but I can listen from beginning to end without feeling bored. I've only seen a few theatrical productions, however, and some of the more avant-garde renditions are almost preposterous to look at. The Bicentennial Bayreuth production by Patrice Chereau looks uninspiring and very bland. The Harry Kupfer Bayreuth production from the early 90's, on the other hand, is a spectacular light show, and has a very fascinating futuristic look. I've only seen a few snippets of the more recent productions from the 2000's, and they range from decent to questionable to just plain laughable. Traditional, straightforward productions are few, but they are indeed appropriate for those who are NOT looking for sci-fi aliens holding baseball bats, or crummy 1990's apartment buildings, or giants wearing Italian business suits. The most famous one of all created by the Metropolitan Opera, with Otto Schenk and Gnter Schneider-Siemssen. This is probably the most traditional stage production that we'll ever get. No weird light effects, no factory mechanics, no basketball cheerleaders whatsoever. This is what Wagner has originally intended: a pre-medieval setting with gods and goddesses, valkyries, giants, dwarves, and mere mortals.  But does that mean that this production is perfect? Not really. Let's break it all down:

CONDUCTOR:
James Levine is the sole conductor for this production, and he doesn't seem to be the perfect man for this sort of work. I'm not saying that he's a bad conductor. Granted, he knows how to emphasize the beauty of Wagner's music. But sometimes, I wish he would pick up the pace when he's conducting. At least ninety percent of the time, the music feels very ponderous, resulting in a not-so exciting-interpretation that feels almost under-rehearsed. There are several moments in which it's just too dull to listen to, such as when Hagen summons his vassals, or when Wotan bids farewell to Brunnhilde before she is confined in a deep sleep. At the same time, however, he does bring out many details that are rarely heard in both live and studio recordings (whether it's either mono or stereo), and manages to balance each class of instruments almost perfectly: brass, woodwinds, percussion, and strings. There are indeed some very beautiful moments here and there, most notably when Erda and the three Norns appear on stage. The famous ""Ride of the Valykries"" in Die Walkure is very lively, while the Rhine Journey in Gotterdammerung can be best described as marvelous. Unfortunately, the 15-hour performance as a whole is filled with plodding tempi: not enough intensity or energy when it's needed elsewhere. If Marek Janowski or Franz Welser-Most were available, I'm sure they would have presented a better understanding of the score.

ORCHESTRA:
While Levine may not be an excellent conductor, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra may very well be one of the greatest. Although I still prefer the Staatskapelle Dresden from the RCA studio recording, this orchestra is the most beautiful-sounding for the Ring Cycle. The brass are heavy and clear, the woodwinds are appropriately light and refined, the percussion are almost flawless, and the strings are mellow and, without any doubt, very elegant. I especially admire the players during the Forest Murmurs and the orchestral transitions in both Siegfried and Gotterdammerung. The orchestra overall is able to overcome Levine's lethargic conducting and perform superbly during all four operas. They save this from being a completely dull presentation.

STAGING:
This Ring production defines ""traditional."" There are no traces of avant-garde costumes or sets anywhere. The characters look as if they really ARE from Norse/Germanic mythology. As for the sets, the trees look like real trees. The interior homes look appropriately medieval. Even the sky in the background is devoid of any distracting, or impressionistic, props. The ""fire"" from the Magic Fire sequence doesn't look very spectacular, but I don't think it should be, anyway. All in all, it's a very good break from all of the hideous modernistic productions that are taking place right now in the 21st century.

SINGING/PERFORMANCES:
I wouldn't call James Morris as the ultimate Wotan (Theo Adam takes that place), but he stands on his own with his smooth, intelligent voice. Ekkehard Wlaschiha is a brilliant Alberich, while Heinz Zednik makes a very convincing Mime. Gary Lakes does a good job playing Siegmund, even if he doesn't really have the perfect voice for the character. Hildegard Behrens presents a mightily-sung Brunnhilde, though her low notes sound very awkward. Kurt Moll as Hunding, as well as Matti Salminen doubling as Fafner and Hagen, remain authoritative with their respective roles. Siegfried Jerusalem sings as Siegfried with a stellar voice, but he seems miscast as the cunning trickster Loge (Zednik or Peter Schreier could have done much better). Birgitta Svenden is a lovely Erda who sounds almost hypnotic. Jessye Norman has a very heavy voice, which would explain why she is NOT the right choice as Sieglinde. Sieglinde is an innocent and almost fragile woman, not a high-and-mighty valkyr. Norman would have done a much better job as Brunnhilde rather than Sieglinde. The rest of the cast do a good job, no question about that.

CONCLUSION:
This is not an excellent production, but it's a very good one, nonetheless. The orchestra sounds beautiful, the sets and costumes are refreshingly old-fashioned, and the vocalists are wonderful. But the slow (and sometimes uninspiring) conducting and a few questionable casting choices prevent me from grading this at least a 7 out of 10. If you're new to Wagner, however, then get this DVD set right now. Wagner's original intentions to the Ring Cycle are good for beginners.

1784049,3,B00006L9ZT,"I agree with the many reviewers here who have praised the conducting, the orchestra, and the singers, and I also agree that if you want a so-called traditional production, this is the one to get.  The acting isn't always very dynamic, but I've certainly seen worse in other opera DVDs, and I don't agree with those who complain that the production is boring or too unimaginative. It's traditional, but it's not boring.

My problem with this set is that the video quality is substandard when viewed on an HDTV.  The production dates from the late 1980s, and the DVD was issued in 1990.  It was not shot in widescreen, which isn't a big problem in and of itself, but the image is very fuzzy and lacks depth and clarity, even when viewed with a Blu-Ray player that upscales the DVD image.  This becomes especially apparent during scenes that are dark (and in the Ring, this includes a lot of scenes).  It looks like an early VHS tape.  I never really noticed a problem when viewing it on my CRT 4:3 TV, but I certainly do on my HDTV.  I hope that this will be cleaned up as much as possible and given a new video transfer on Blu-Ray.  It's in desperate need of a remastering.

Another problem with the video is that the subtitles are much larger than they need to be, and they intrude on the already murky image.  This is something that could easily be fixed in a remastered version.

The audio, especially the DTS track, is quite good, which only makes the video look all the more outdated. My DVD set has several audio dropouts (at least on the DTS track), but there aren't many and they only last a second or two.  I bought this set when it was first issued, and the dropouts may have been resolved with subsequent pressings.  Even though the DTS is very good, I'd like to hear what they could do if they upgraded it to one of the newer HD audio formats available on Blu-Ray

So, 5 stars for the performances and staging, 2 points for the video, 4 points for the audio, and an overall score of 3 stars.  I hope that DG will remaster this classic performance and give it the video quality that it deserves.",1293062400,16,2105,4.38659793814433
1784050,4,B00006L9ZT,"Most reviewers tend to either reccomend the Solti, Boehm, or even Karajan Ring Cycles to new inductees into the world of Wagner. Ones who don't tend to do so on a strictly ""I hate (whoever) so they automatically suck"" platform. I, however, highly recommend this Cycle.

No it does not have the power (or cast) of Solti, Boehm, Keilberth, Knappertsbusch, or even Karajan, but it more than makes up for it in terms of overall production. Compared to other Ring Cycles on the market, this version actually follows Wagner's directions quite closely.

The Gods are definately Nordic/Teutonic in design, the Rhinemaidens are definately aquatic creatures, Mime and Alberich looks like actual dwarfs, Walhalla is a large stone fortress, the Rainbow bridge is actually featured, the Valyries look authentic (they don't have the stereotypic winged helmets, but their headgear here looks much better), the settings are realistic, and everything is clearly lifted from the original Bayreuth designs. The Gold's resting place exactly matches the original 1876 design

There are some minor changes, though: Grane is invisible as usual, the dragon looks, well, unusual to say the least, and during the redemption theme at the end, a slight change is made to what happens on stage (it's actually pretty much the same, just more uplifting than some other productions).

While the production may not be that innovative or given more thought than ""Wagner's way,"" I feel that in order to understand the Ring Cycle, people must be see it as closely as ""originally intended"" as possible.

Overall, I do prefer Chereau's 1976 version in terms of how innovative and original it is, as well as how beautifully Boulez carries the score, but people unfamiliar with the Ring will be bamboozled by how it takes place in the 19th Century.

Musically, however, is where this cycle falls a bit. Levine is often criticized for being too slow, even during the more upbeat sections of music. I find that he tends to start plodding here and there, but there are times when he flows nicely, and especially during the more dramatic sections, he is in tune with the emotions of the music. He may not have Furtwaengler's sensuality (who is also criticized for being too slow) but I find that he avoids being tepid and lethargic. People who prefer more upbeat tempos, however, should look at Boulez's Ring. I have note heard Barenboim's, but I hear he has the best control over the orchestra.

The cast is also terrific, and an improvement over Levine's contemporary studio recording (I have only heard parts of it, but enough to know about the changes). The changes are small, a different Waltraute, different Fafner, different Norns, and a few other smaller roles. Ludwig plays only Fricka in the studio, but Waltruate here as well to everyone's delight, and Salminen takes up Fafner in addition to Hagen, roles he quite possibly the best at. The biggest change in cast, the role of Siegfried, is what makes this recording a zillion times better. Reiner Goldberg did a horrible job in role in the studio (probably why he is not here) and Siegfried Jerusalem is absolutely fantastic here, playing Loge as well. He gave a better performance for Haitink (more energetic), but he owns the role completely.

The rest of the cast, James Morris as Wotan, Heinz Zednik as Mime, Ekkehard Wlaschiha as Alberich, Jessye Norman as Sieglinde, and Gary Lakes as Siegmund are absolutely fantastic as well, with kudos given to Behrens who (despite her voice being too light in my opinion) is an absolute delight on stage as everyone's favorite Valkyrie Bruennhilde.

I highly recommend this recording to anyone interested in Wagner, or to those who already have other recordings of the Cycle, as it truly helps you appreciate the drama of the Ring since seeing what happens is better than hearing obtrusive sound effects for a theatre of the mind (Culshaw did do a good job though, except for the gold stacking) for those who do not know the stage action.",1289347200,6,4000,4.931649331352155
1784051,4,B00006L9ZT,"Whatever Robert Lepage puts on the Met stage in 2010-12 (as I write, the first installment, DAS RHEINGOLD, is but weeks away), whether the reception is rapturous, scornful, or a mixture, one can expect nostalgia for Otto Schenk's now-retired production, sets by Gnther Schneider-Siemssen. This was unveiled at high noon of the Reagan era and was taped for broadcast when still relatively new (1989-1990). It held up sturdily and pleased crowds through the first decade of our present century. By no means the most probing or intellectually stimulating RING staging of its day, nor even as scrupulously faithful and traditional as its adherents would have you believe, it comes closer than anything else on DVD to something Wagner would have recognized. The composer may even have approved of long stretches. The stage pictures are often quite beautiful in their Romantic calendar-art fashion (example: the gods' entrance to Valhalla, rainbow bridge and all, at the conclusion of RHEINGOLD), and from time to time Schenk's orthodox notions combine with the Met's impressive technical and monetary resources in stirring ways (the zealous realization of Wagner's stage directions in the final five minutes of GTTERDMMERUNG, singled out by Jon Alan Conrad in his excellent Met Guide review).

There are performances upon which one could scarcely improve. James Morris's Wotan/Wanderer is vocally Golden Age stuff. It would be churlish to complain that his expressive work is not the equal of his singing.  He meets any reasonable standard, and he looks the part (this being 1989-90, we can pass lightly over the mullet). Heinz Zednik's Mime is master-class material, as expertly sung as in the earlier, more radical Boulez/Chreau/Bayreuth staging (also on DG DVD), but acted and made up in a more conventionally grotesque way, no longer the Victorian nebbish. The great bass Kurt Moll's Hunding all but walks away with the first act of WALKRE: voice for miles and a shaded characterization to go with it. Matti Salminen, once the Hunding for Chreau, contributes a creepy Hagen to GTTERDMMERUNG (watch him observing Brnnhilde before their scene together, like a sinister black-voiced bird of prey). Earlier in the cycle, Salminen and Jan-Hendrik Rootering had effectively partnered as the giants.

Christa Ludwig, as Fricka and Waltraute (roles she had recorded 20 to 25 years earlier in various segments of two classic audio cycles, Solti/Decca and Karajan/DG), sounds near retirement and is a mite old-fashioned in stage deportment, but recognizable as a sovereign artist. It is a fine farewell/souvenir. Perhaps the nicest surprise is Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegfried in the final two installments. One despairs of ever hearing and seeing a Siegfried who has it all, and like most modern ones, Jerusalem is modest-scaled to undersized in the face of this role's punishments. But he is more pleasing of timbre and more likeable than most of the competition (both from 1990 and from the two decades on either side). Dawn Upshaw makes a lovely Forest Bird, but one doesn't often hear a bad one.

Ekkehard Wlaschiha's work as Alberich might have been better experienced on an audio recording. The character's monster-movie getup seems to me one of the production's miscalculations. The same holds true for the reptilian Loge (Jerusalem again; luxury casting); for the gorgeously intoned but non-acted Sieglinde of Jessye Norman; and for the less gorgeously intoned but diligent Siegmund of Gary Lakes. (The Wlsung twins seem to be operating in their own costumed concert performance; it's up to their foil, Moll's Hunding, to supply what dramatic juice there is in that act of WALKRE.)

The strength and weakness of the casting is Hildegard Behrens's Brnnhilde. This estimable artist gives an effort worthy of her role's heroic stature, and she is never less than dramatically engaged and artistic in turn of phrase. She benefits from the concentrated nature of this undertaking, suggesting the character's through-line from first entrance to immolation. But one must overlook unsolved problems in all three relevant chapters. She is vocally best suited to the WALKRE Brnnhilde, but the Halloween-costume battle armor and the compact sizing of her voice conspire to make her seem diminutive (it is difficult to get Dame Gwyneth Jones's stunning warrior-goddess in the Bayreuth staging out of one's mind's eye). In the SIEGFRIED Brnnhilde, the shortest assignment of the three but the one with the most demanding tessitura, Behrens sounds uncomfortably near the limit of her resources throughout. GTTERDMMERUNG begins well, but something goes wrong during the Waltraute scene and stays wrong -- I have never heard a commercial release in which the singer of a major role sounded so *hoarse*. The performance is not a total loss, and Behrens even gets some expressive utility out of her froggy sound in the ugly ensuing scene with ""Gunther""/Siegfried, sounding terrified and vulnerable and achieving great pathos. But at no point in this long opera's final two-thirds is she easy on the ears.

By 1990, Maestro James Levine had gone most of the way toward transforming the Met Opera Orchestra into the world-class ensemble it is today. The playing as such -- especially at the level of texture -- is glorious. Unfortunately, here, Levine the musician is not the equal of Levine the orchestra trainer and technician. He seems to have been influenced by the records of a certain breed/generation of Wagner conductor, and his Met Wagner (*all* of it, including later videos of TRISTAN, MEISTERSINGER, and PARSIFAL) is a glutinous, secondhand homage to what he heard in his formative years. Certain interwar and postwar German Kapellmeisters might have led Wagner performances as slow as Levine's (this is saying a great deal), but those men had an idiomatic sensitivity to the minute adjustments that enliven long, gradually unfurling movements. Levine knows where he wants to end up, and how quickly he wants to get there, but details of the old route elude him and he will not pursue his own. In Wagner, he has spent a career trying to recreate a product without being in touch with the process that gave it internal consistency. I have not a doubt in my mind that Levine loves this music as much as anyone alive does, and as much as it is possible to love music. But he never shows an inclination to do more than ""savor"" it, and his sweaty embraces squeeze the life from it.

Levine does have one card up his sleeve, and he plays it often: Following an especially uninflected, buffed-into-somnolence passage, he tends to punch out a motto with rude, exaggerated force and volume, especially in the brass. There is a prime example of this Soltian impulse near the end of WALKRE, when we've had the Wotan/Brnnhilde ""Trance"" intermezzo for a bit, and the ""Fate"" and ""Spear"" mottos suddenly break the mood, returning in succession. A strong dynamic shift is built in, of course, but Levine is as heavy-handed in rousing us as he was in putting us in the state from which we need rousing. One supposes this is to pass for ""contrast."" The maestro also comes up short purely as an accompanist, his singers often fighting both to sustain and to be audible (poor Gary Lakes, forced to hold those notes in ""Wlse! Wlse!"" for so long that one fears he may keel over). I miss the different side of Levine one hears in such documents as the 1983 video of Berlioz's LES TROYENS (Troyanos, Norman, Domingo). His ultra-expansive approach to Wagner is fractionally better suited (or less debilitating) to the later two RING operas than to the earlier two (RHEINGOLD, especially), but his leadership is the biggest impediment to remaining upright through 941 minutes of a generally attractive and persuasive memento of its time and place.",1284508800,9,7811,5.102423768569195

1784053,5,B00006L9ZT,"This is a classy 1980's performance of Wagner's titanic Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring) by James Levine and a superb Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. I am not speaking to those who have an acute understanding of the Wagnerian literature, are opera buffs of very long standing, are technically versed in the complexities of music or have seen many different productions of The Ring. This is a report only for those who like opera with subtitles, want to see it in some approximation of how Wagner intended it to be, and are not going to  sit for three plus hours (even broken by their own intermissions) to see any two-disc opera in the series of four.
For those who are, more or less, the average viewer, there is a real treat here. The singing ranges from fine to outstanding. The acting, for opera, is much above average. Standouts in one or more of the operas in The Ring, who sing and emote in great style are, James Morris and Matti Salminen, two stalwarts of stature, Siegfried Jerusalem, a tenor hero, who handles himself well on stage, Heinz Zednik and Ekkehard Wlaschima, who are in the tradition of supporting players who light up the stage; then there is the heroine, played and sung with vigor, pathos and rage, by Hildegard Behrens, Christa Ludwig, an old pro of considerable talent, makes a number of important appearances, and, well, let me leave it at that, though I omit such prominent names as Kurt Moll and Dawn Upshaw, who deserve mention in any more thorough review.
Then there is the production and video staff who deserve the highest praise for providing we average viewers with scenic, visual and audio design which, probably, conveys something of what Wagner would recognize as what he intended, while keeping it fresh and vivid to modern viewers.
Then, there is the Orchestra, playing with a verve and splendor that provides foundation not competition with the singers. No doubt James Levine, their conductor and leader of the Mets team effort, has every reason to be proud of his players, and proud of what everyone did to make this the DVD experience it is.
As I say, I cannot compare it with other full productions, nor would I seek another Melchior or Flagstadt, whom I heard and saw on occasion in the forties, they were forces of nature, but, as with all performers, of their time and place. What I would say is, everyone should see and hear The Ring (at least once) for it is one of the musical gems of opera. Levine sees to it that we hear it so as to appreciate Wagner's achievement. The remainder of the creative and technical group, as well as the performers, see to it that we see an approximation of the work that Wagner put together to go with the music. I don't think you can go wrong with this set.",1273881600,5,2740,4.614754098360656
1784054,5,B00006L9ZT,"As an opera fan and an audio fan I was very excited to see the audio options on this set of recordings; especially the DTS 5.1 option. Having a home theater designed primarily for music I am always appreciative when a recording provides some really good audio options; this one most assuredly does!

I have been a fan of Wagnerian opera since I was a teen-ager, and that was many years ago. My first record collection included excerpts from Siegfried on a set of 78 RPM records that felt as heavy as lead. I simply loved Siegfried's singing of the forging of Notung in ""Notung! Notung! Neidliches Schwert;"" this was one of those melodies that never left my head even though I had not heard it again for many decades.  When I got this set the first thing I did was find this scene in Siegfried and play it. It was food for my soul to finally hear the music again in glorious surround sound and actually get to watch the forging of the sword as staged by the Met.

One of the things I had not previously had available was a complete libretto to the opera; as some of the other reviewers have pointed out; it's all about the music. This DVD set offers English translations of the libretto; I have from time to time played the music with the English translation added. I must confess that sometimes the words are so trite and innocuous that I decided to forget the translation and just go with the music; I think I have come out the winner with that arrangement.

The first opera ""Das Rheingold"" is on one DVD. The album includes two booklets, one on the entire series of four operas and one on just the opera. The second, ""Die Walkure"" includes two DVDs and a booklet on the opera; as do the third, ""Siegfried"" and the fourth ""Gotterdammerung""

Wagner is not for everyone, but for those who appreciate his beautiful and inspiring music this set is very gratifying. I'm pleased to have it in my collection and can recommend it for any serious fan of grand opera. The icing on the cake is the fabulous audio options provided!

As an aside for lovers of Wagner's music I will mention a CD of excerpts from Gotterdammerung and Siegfried recorded by Arturo Toscanini with Lauritz Melchior and Helen Traubel as ""Volume 53"" of the Arturo Toscanini Collection. Brunnhilde's Immolation, bands 8-12 of this recording features Helen Traubel in the role of Brunnhilde. Although it is a mono recording from February of 1941, the beauty and elegance of her performance is timeless and this particular recording was digitally remastered and presents the vocal qualities of Ms. Traubel in a convincing manner.

This recording is available from Amazon.",1272240000,,2632,4.635193133047211
1784055,5,B00006L9ZT,"In a period in which writers all over Europe were trying, again, to make genuine art out of tragedy, Wagner realized this could only be done musically. By creating a new mitology, Wagner seeked to achieve some level of cultural cohesion, which writers in the XIX believed to have been lost. We were all gifted by such and extraordinary ambition.

1784058,4,B00006L9ZT,"I bought this because I wanted a traditional production of a work that I think is betrayed by most modern directors, and for the excellent Wotan of James Morris.  He does not disappoint, nor does the production.  The greatest Wotan since Hotter, gifted with perhaps a more beautiful voice, and a handsome and eloquent actor, Morris looks and sounds like a god, and makes the transition from the young and brash character into the older and defeated one most creditable.  He sings the way you dream he should.  Also outstanding is Christa Ludwig as Fricka and Waltraute, and Jesseye Norman, as Sieglinde (though you have to suspend disbelief as to her being either a child of Wotan or Siegmund's sister).  Hildegard Behrens, while she never quite sounds like a goddess, and is not a Nilsson, a Varnay or a Flagstad, at least surmounts the vocal challenges of the role, and looks the part of the warrior heroine.  So with Siegfried Jerusalem, who acts well and does look like a believable Siegfried.  He sounds quite good at moments, and a bit less so at others, but again, surmounts the role, though not without effort.  Gary Lakes (Siegmund) and others do a creditable job. James Levine is a wonderful conductor throughout, and the images are quite evocative.  Sound is excellent.",1259280000,3,1280,4.834862385321101
1784059,3,B00006L9ZT,"I video-taped the broadcast of this production the year it was on PBS and have not seen the commercial dvds.  I do have this cycle on cd which is a much better set of performances than you'll see here on film.

I like traditional productions, I also like innovative new 'takes' on these old war horses, though most regietheatre geniuses simply mutilate Wagner's masterpieces to suit their personal vanity.  The only 'modern' version I've liked (and actually purchased) was the Pierre Audi/Hartmut Haenchen cycle from Amsterdam.  Audi does not twist and torture the story into some modern socio-political parable but expresses the mythology of Wagner's vision in a highly creative and visually beautiful and fascinating way.

This Levine/Otto Schenk film is the only 'traditional' production on dvd.  We are currently at the receiving end of an onslaught of trendy, childish mediocrities being poured forth onto film from Europe.  They are all, the Audi being the exception, utter rubbish.  Which is more shameful because some of them feature some fine singing and orchestral/conducting work.

James Levine is not my favorite Wagnerian.  He often lapses into a musical coma and takes his audience with him, his recording of 'Der fliegende Hollnder' being a case in point.  I've noted that he always performs with far more energy and insight when working at Bayreuth than he does at the Metropolitan Opera.

The Schenk production is, as one other reviewer said, Blah.  It's as if Schenk had a brilliant vision but couldn't quite realize it in the material world.  The result is like lovely wallpaper.  The direction of the singers seems non-existent and they are left to their own various levels of competence to characterize as best they can.  Few have succeeded in this show.

The pluses:  The orchestra.  They play beautifully, technically perfect and slightly soulless, which is not uncommon with the American way of training musicians.  Technique is ALL and if you are able to convey something deeper, all to the good.
James Morris is a very fine Wotan, though he's better for Sawallisch on the EMI recordings.  But he can't act.  Siegfried Jerusalem is ideal as Loge and stretched as Siegfried, though he's far better than his other filmed counterparts, and he looks great which is a major advantage in a film.

Matti Salminen is one of the two GREAT performers here.  His Hagen is terrifying vocally and histrionically.  A major milestone in recorded Wagner singing.  The other great performer is Ekkehard Wlaschiha's Alberich.  Both these singers take hold of the reins and soar to the greatest heights of dramatic and vocal interpretation.

On a slightly lower but still high level is the ethereal Erda of Birgitta Svendn.  We are lucky Levine cottoned on to this gorgeous voice and we have her beautiful self preserved for posterity.  She is also Barenboim's Erda and First Norn and sings even more gloriously for his filmed version.  Heinz Zednik was always an outstanding Mime and he is at his peak in this cycle.  Kurt Moll is good too but he's hardly on stage long enough to balance the overall mediocrity of the balance of the cast.

I might almost say that the rest of the cast goes for dross, but that wouldn't be entirely true, but almost.  Gary Lakes and Jessye Norman are better heard than seen, though the cd of Walkre were the least successful of the four operas on the DG audio releases.  There is something constipated about that recording that this live action film counteracts simply because people are moving around, even if their movements are stylized and stodgy, as they are here.  And Norman sings much more beautifully on the old Janowski set, with a young, virile Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegmund.  A fine, under-rated Ring cycle recording.

The Gunther and Gutrune are indeed awful.  It's no surprise that no one had ever heard of Hanna Lisowska before and, now, after this production was filmed.  Her Gunther is just as big a non-entity, and I've forgotten his name..
Philip Joll was it?  Who cares?

Freia is okay, Froh and Donner fade into the scenery.  Hildegard Behrens started her career late, singing her first Brnnhilde at Bayreuth for Solti in 1983, she was already mid-40s at the time.  It was a spectacular debut in this role and should be released on cd.  She soon after recorded the part for Sawallisch on EMI, to much better results than she achieves in New York.  I can't stand watching her sing, as her veins and eyeballs are popping out of her head and her voice takes on a constricted, strangled sound that nullifies the great silvery beauty of her top voice.  Her low notes are gutteral, almost barked out.  NOT a good Brnnhilde, I'm afraid.  Recorded too late in her career.  And Christa Ludwig was way beyond her sing-by date.  It seems churlish to diss this great singer for this performance but it was not an advisable way to bow out of her recording career with a vocally vinegary, visually elderly Fricka and Waltraute.

The Valkyries are a typical raucous bunch that only the Met can scrape up (the cd recording valkyries are much better).
The Norns, beside Mignon Dunn's performance, are nothing to write home about either.

All in all, the hoop-la over this film seems unjustified.  But as most people only recognize James Levine and the Metropolitan Opera on the cover they assume it HAS to be great.  Typical provincial jingoism.

We still await an excellent 'traditional' Ring cycle, which I don't think I will see in my lifetime, given the penchant of all those geniuses in Europe to regurgitate their vapid visions onto the stages and screens of the operatic world.

I'd skip this film, and if you are still young, hope for something better in the future.  For now, I highly recommend that, if you are not averse to non-traditional productions, you investigate the Pierre Audi/Hartmut Haenchen cycle.  It is the most successful of the 'modern' productions on film, and though the cast isn't perfect there are no vocal land minds and ditches to be encountered like there are in the Levine/Schenk show.",1258588800,7,6064,4.8824681684622915
1784060,5,B00006L9ZT,"This is Der Ring Des Nibelugen the way Wagner meant it to be.  Otto Schenk based his stage directions on Wagner's stage directions.  This brilliant production has the gods, giants, humans, and dwarfs in their proper environments.  This is the production against which all the new ""clever"" productions should be judged. I'm not an expert on opera, but to me the singing and music were fantastic.  I loved Hildergard Behrens and thought she did a great job singing and acting.  James Morris was fantastic.  Siegfried Jerusalem was great as both Logi and Siegfried .  Ekkehard Wlaschiha and Heinz Zedick were excellent, too.  In fact, I enjoyed all the actors/singers.  Levine did a great job conducting.  I have recently seen live postmodern versions of the first three operas of this opera cycle, and that has made me appreciate this traditional production even more.  It is a shame the Met has retired this production, and I'll never get to see it live.",1254873600,8,953,4.89375

1784068,5,B00006L9ZT,"This is definitely the best Ring DVD set by far.  Why?  Because in this production, the Gibichungs are Gibichungs.  Which is to say that in this production, the Gibichungs are a wild tribe of the Rhine Valley.  They don't wear suits or tuxedos, as in other DVD versions. Another definite plus is that this Wotan is actually a Norse god, and not a fat slob in sweatpants with plumber's crack. Finaly, it is wonderful to have a Ring NOT directed by some mewling-puking commie scum.

But am I the only one who noticed that in the opening scene of ""Rhinegold,"" at the bottom of the Rhine River, the Rhinegold sits at the top of a projecting rock in the middle of the scene.  And, together, this rock and Rhinegold sure look like a gigantic weiner.  (You know what I mean.)  This had to be intentional.

Also, Fricka is great when she gets out the rolling pin in ""Valkyrie,"" forcing Wotan to allow the incestous Siegmund to be slain by Hunding.

In sum, this is a great DVD.",1243036800,,969,4.423728813559322

A must for devotees of Wagner's monumental 4 opera story steeped in mthyology and memorable characters.

A big ""thumbs up"" for these DVD's that capture the live performances.",1241654400,4,498,5.30379746835443
1784070,4,B00006L9ZT,"The task of performing The Niebelung's Ring in its entirety is probably the most difficult for any opera house. An enormous cast is required, over fifteen hours of music, very difficult passages in the orchestra... not to mention a conductor who knows the score front to back. On top of all that the stage and costumes need to be pristine.

There will never be a ""perfect"" production of The Ring. There will always be stars who the audience loves, there will always be those few performers who people won't like. There will always be someone who misses ""that note"" and there will always be someone in the orchestra who cracks. There will always be a time when the conductor goes too fast or too slow to someone's taste. These are all inevitable to any show, especially if there's over 15 hours of music involved, and also because as much as we praise and borderline worship these performers: this team is still built entirely of human beings like us; perfection is impossible, but being delighted is not.

The first thing most will notice is Otto Schenk's incredible detail in scenery. It is in my opinion the most accurate design to the story in every detail; even Wotan's costume includes raven feathers. The production itself was obviously not rushed - it seemed to me like there was plenty of rehearsal time; there are certain moments that simply cannot be looked at once and then moved on to the next bit.

Every detail to the score and set was heeded to. It is the best that this team could do. After all: that's all that anyone can do. I listened to this when I was very new to opera. Now after studying it for a few more years and nearing the completion of my undergraduate degree in music, looking at it again I'm still just as impressed and pleased. In these four massive operas we will never find perfection no matter how much we search, but we can find people who do their best. That is all the audience want really, and I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in seeing the entire cycle.",1236384000,9,2011,4.5497237569060776

The singers are sometimes light for their roles, but they are still decent enough. I think most opera lovers would enjoy this, if they have never seen it before.",1231200000,3,485,4.46067415730337
1784072,5,B00006L9ZT,"This is the best 'authentic' Wagner 'Ring' on DVD.  It follows, very closely, Wagner's own staging instructions and is a wonderful representation of the Norse gods mythology.  It definitely is the first 'Ring' for everyone to own--after all, the set of 4 operas is about the Norse gods and Norse mythology, not about modern power dams!  My quibbles with it are few;  however, the following are worth mentioning:
1. It doesn't have Fricka arriving in 'Die Walkre', Act 2, Scene 1, in a cart (or wagon) drawn by two rams.  Brnnhilde sings about this when she warns Wotan that Fricka is approaching (and, Fricka is a very mad wife--she doesn't appear as irritated as she is without the cart).
2. 'Die Walkre', Act 3, Scene 2, has no horses for the Valkyries.
3. 'Gtterdmmerung', Act 3, Scene 3 (the final scene), Brnnhilde does not have her horse 'Grane' when she rides into the flames.
In regards 1 above--it is just a pity this was not done per Wagner's stage instructions which are in the libretto.
In regards 2 above--it is another pity that Wagner's stage instructions were not followed.  The Seattle Opera, a few years ago, managed to have flying horses complete with Valkyries upon them.  If the Seattle Opera can manage to do this sort of thing, so can the Met!
In regards 3 above--it is yet again another pity that Wagner's stage instructions were not followed.  These instructions state: 'Brnnhilde jumps on her horse (Grane) and with one bound leaps into the burning pyre (Sigfried's funeral pyre').  I realize there are certain problems with having a live horse on stage;  mostly problems with the horse dropping little gifts on stage or wetting up the stage.  However, these problems could easily be solved by having a mannequin horse animated by two members of the ballet troupe as was done in the Komiche Opera's 1984 Berlin production of Handel's Giustino.  (This was spectacular, with Jochen Kowalski in one of his greatest performances.  It was released on LD, but has not yet, to my knowledge been released on DVD.)",1229731200,4,2031,4.801724137931035

1784075,5,B00006L9ZT,"This is an epic performance of the most epic of operas.  The Met brings all of its awesome technical capabilities to bear in creating a splendid, if traditional, visual presentation, very nearly matched by sumptuous and passionate vocal and theatrical performances.  James Morris is one of the best Wotans of the past generation.  Siegfried Jerusalem is a thrilling Siegfried (and a surprisingly good Loge).  Hildegarde Behrens does not fit the usual physical type for a Walkure and is not Birgit Nilssen, but still sings and acts a vital and exciting Brunnhilde.  Christa Ludwig and Jessye Norman both are perhaps a little past their primes, but do very well in filling their rolls as Fricka and Sieglinde.  Etc., etc. all the way through the impressive and large cast.  Levine's conducting is never boring and often electrifying.  I was very pleased with this DVD set, especially after being very disappointed in the Met's static and boring Tristan.",1206748800,2,951,5.090322580645161
1784076,5,B00006L9ZT,"As a veteran of 25+ live ""Ring"" cycles, this Met production remains my favorite. Reviewers giving this production 3 stars have evidently not suffered through such ""Ring"" abominations as those recently done in Vienna and Stuttgart, or the godawful Kirov ""Ring"" at the Met this summer.
Siegfried Jerusalem is a fantastic Siegfried, warm, likeable(which is difficult), nuanced, I could go on and on. It is hard to describe how many trainwreck ""Siegfried""s I have seen, this one is pretty near perfect.
Any live production of ""The Ring"" is never going to be exactly what you have in mind. Actually, James Levine's conducting and innate understanding of ""The Ring"" IS what I have in mind...this is the best DVD of ""The Ring"" available.",1185840000,23,730,4.991803278688525
1784077,5,B00006L9ZT,"This Ring Cycle does *not* deserve three-and-a-half stars, so I'm trying to up the average--I'd prefer to give it four-and-a-half, but there we go.

There are minor quibbles which have been mentioned: no horses, the fact that the twins aren't very, well, twin-like--they're all true, but not enough to take a star off, that's for sure. All the problems with it are so minor I hardly noticed.

James Morris' Wotan is truly amazing, and Hildegard Behrens, though not perfect, is a decent enough Brunnhilde. But Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegfried troubled me (I think I've been spoiled by Alberto Remedios--listen to the ENO Ring Cycle recording of ""Siegfried"" after this and you'll get my point). Matti Salminen is a wonderful Hagen/Fafner, and the music is of course excellent. The voices range from fair to awe-inspiring. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves opera, or legends, or (like me) both.",1182297600,12,896,5.047297297297297
1784078,5,B00006L9ZT,"Wagner's Ring is perhaps the greatest work of art ever, certainly the most brilliant accomplishment in the field of musical drama. I found this Met broadcast to be an entirely satisfying interpretation. I understand that some ""Ringies"" are disappointed with the straightforward approach, the lack of symbolism, but there is already enough symbolism in the story, the characters and the music for a month of Sundays. Don't get me wrong, I like abstract interpretations of the Ring(see my review of the Barcelona production), but sometimes you just want to sit back and enjoy the Ring on its own terms, without any frills, just be immersed in the mythological images and, most of all, the glorious music, and this Met production is perfect for that type of Ring experience. Otto Schenk's vision is appropriately cinematic, literally capturing Wagner's mythological world as the composer probably envisioned it, uncluttered by any modernist touches. And the results are often stunning. The gods' introduction to Valhalla at the end of Das Rheingold is one example, Wotan and company standing in the foreground, with a gorgeous rainbow spanning the gorge between them and their new home, a castle as grim and foreboding as it is beautiful. The conclusion of Gotterdammerung is equally impressive, with Schenck taking the term twilight of the gods quite literally as the whole stage crumbles to ruin against the backdrop of the Rhinemaidens retrieving their lost gold just before humanity arrives on the scene to look on in awe at the dethroned immortals. Only a few scenes are visually disappointing, including a pedestrian Ride of the Valkyries(sans horses) and uminspiring special effects to back up Wagner's very inspiring Magic Fire Music.

Musically, this is a grand performance. There are too many singers involved in the Ring to mention everyone, so I'll focus on the majors. James Morris is Wotan, and his experience in the role is invaluable to this performance. His deep and haunting voice conveys both introspection and compassion, and anger when necessary, although the viewer gets the feeling that with this Wotan, anger is seldom more than an affectation, he is more of a noble and thoughtful character than a god of fury. His scene with Brunnhilde at the end of Die Walkure is earthshattering. The appropriately named Siegfried Jerusalem is an ideal Siegfriend, dashing, energetic, brash, immature and passionate, with a voice capable of being both stentorian and lyrical. Hildegard Behrens' Brunnhilde didn't overwhelm me initially, but by the Immolation Scene in Gotterdammerung I was completely sold. Though she sings beautifully, and with a lot of passion, she isn't the most strong-voiced Brunnhilde you will ever hear, and if this were merely a sound recording it might have bothered me. But she is as much a physical actress as a vocal one, and you aren't likely to see anyone get into the character of Wotan's valiant lovechild as deeply as she does. Finally, Matti Salminen is Matti Salminen. Among contemporary basses, he owns the character of the half-Nibelung half-human Hagen, possibly my favorite character in the whole cycle, a fascinating study of a personality bred toward evil. No one else's voice, or face, is so perfect for projecting Hagen's unique form of tortured menace. It makes we want to see him as King Phillip in Don Carlo, so someone please get around to releasing one of those productions on DVD!

Finally, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra under James Levine is outstanding. I sometimes find Levine's conducting of Wagner(as well as Puccini) to be too slow, but here there are very few moments where I felt he was dwelling on the profundity of the music at the expense of the drama, he achieves a nearly perfect balance of these two qualities. All the motifs are explored to the fullest extent, and the result is a soundworld unlike any other.

Buying a complete Ring Cycle is a big investment, so it really depends on what you're looking for. I'm a huge fan of these Met releases, so I may be a bit prejudiced, but I would recommend this one over others(bearing in mind that the only other one I've seen is the Barcelong Ring which is also quite good, though totally different). For me, this one is a perfect fusion of image and music. The Ring is a long listening and viewing experience, sometimes even in the best hands this can lead to some awkward and, let's face it, tiresome stretches, but especially if the music and visuals aren't on track. Here, though, Levine and Schenk and company have achieved something magical, appropriately enough, more than that they have created a Ring that FLOWS, logically, dramatically, from beginning to end. My praise couldn't be any higher.",1182297600,41,4724,5.0229591836734695

1784082,5,B00006L9ZT,"I have been to several Rings -- 2 in San Francisco, 4 in Seattle and even the 1990 Met production on this DVD. I have also seen several versions of the Ring on DVD, including Stuttgard and Bayreuth productions. Of all the Rings I have seen this Met production is the only one that meets Wagner's standard as he wrote it -- with the visuals true to his directions. It is this version of the Ring that I show to my local opera group, and the only one I recommend as an introduction to the greatness and immensity of the Ring itself. The other versions, though excellent productions in themselves, are not produced the way Wagner wrote it, as Nordic mythology, but as a contemporary interpretation of this amazing work.

This production is as good as any opera you would expect from the Met. Because the Met has all the latest equipment and technology available to them to really put on an incredible show you should expect nothing less but breathtaking -- and all the special effects are there (no horses, however). The most disappointing character, however, was the dragon. It was pitiful! (We call it a crab or Dungeness dragon at our house!) Shame on the Met for not having more imagination and giving us a truly awesome dragon. They certainly have the talent to pull it off much better than they did. Seattle's dragon was the best I have ever seen -- and they were able to keep it a secret from the audience up until its amazing debut. Kudos to them! The Fire Music at the end of Die Walkure is breathtaking, and you are left with the feeling you have truly seen the best there is. Siegfried was a lot of fun to watch. Mime was fabulous and with all his antics it was hard to remember that he is a good tenor in his own right. The only frustrating thing was in the third act, Siegfried's ring kept mysteriously switching from one hand to the other and it became distracting. I actually counted eight times the ring switched hands -- my suspicion was that it was two takes that were spliced together. But why Siegfried can't remember which hand he had originally put the ring is beyond me.

I was at the 1990 Met production and got to see the Immolation Scene at the end of Gotterdammerung from the back of the orchestra section. It was truly stupendous! I kept poking my mother saying, ""They really pulled it off! Wow!"" The DVD version was less spectacular, however, with the camera intent on getting close-ups instead of just backing up to a full stage and letting the special effects run their course. You lost the continuity of the staging, suddenly finding yourself underwater with the Rhinemaidens, and not knowing how you got there. It's a shame that they didn't duplicate the experience I saw being in the audience. It's hard to describe to anyone watching the DVD.

The singing, though not really spectacular except for the brilliance of James Morris, Matti Salminen and perhaps Jessye Norman, was more than adequate. Although the singing took a back seat to the ""Dream Team"" of Kirsten Flagstad, Lauritz Melchior and Frederich Schorr, the singers were always on key and certainly gave it their best professional performance. Hildegarde Behrens will never be another Birgit Nilsson, but she certainly made up for it in her exquisite acting ability, her loveliness and her physical agility. She was a believable Brunnhilde, and that's hard to find in today's buxom bunch. The close-ups of her facial expressions and body language were truly hypnotic. Siegfried Jerusalem was also very believable as his name-sake, superbly pulling off his role, though you could see how increasingly tired he was getting by the end of Gotterdammerung. He acted the true teenage brat and jumped over logs in the forest with ease. Matti Salminen was a sinister Hagen. Not only was his deep voice magnificent, but his acting was also wonderful. In the dream sequence with Alberich he did not blink once, but just stared straight ahead. It was riveting.

James Levine is still the master of conducting The Ring. His orchestra was in top form and was rich and exciting. In the Solti recording, however, they used real alpen horns in Gotterdammerung, making the vassal scene a bit more realistic.

In general, other than some minor criticisms, this is a superb ""traditional"" production and should be shown before you see any other contemporary interpretation. As they said in Seattle, ""Sometimes you just want to see 'it' and not an interpretation of 'it.'"" This is really a wonderful production and Wagner himself would have been proud. My opera group loved it and couldn't stop talking about it, and I guess that's the real proof.",1178841600,28,4618,4.73167701863354

I was at once stunned and overcome by the great attention to detail and production of this epic presentation.  From the time the curtain goes up, and we are introduced to the Rhein Maidens in their glory, to the thrilling conclusion of The Twilight of the Gods, the stage is illuminated in an other-worldly glow, almost as though we have been transported to a different dimension.  I won't elaborate on the numerous plot twists.  Anyone familiar with The Ring is aware of its ""novela""-esque dramatic complications (everything from incest to hari-kari is covered here).  The performances in this production are amazing!  Especially notable are Jessye Norman, Siegfried Jerusalem and Hildegaard Behrens.  Also, conductor James Levine is at his best.

Be that as it may, this production doesn't care about politics one bit. It's old-fashioned in more than one sense of the word, and in fact may just be the single greatest anachronism early 21st-century theatre has to offer. (It's still playing at the Met.) ""Liking"" it or not, therefore, has nothing to do with taste and all to do with the fundamental opinion each of us has of what theatre is all about.

So, given the fact most of the reviewers here seem to believe opera should be a museum of the past, what really astonishes me is that not one of them even mentions the director's name.

James Morris and Matti Salminen might as well be dipped in bronze and set on top of Bayreuth!  Mr. Morris, or 'Butters' as I like to call him is so amazing that it isn't fair...  He is the reason that this DVD and CD set are at the level they are.  He develops the character, Wotan, to be a little more human than his predecessors and has a touch more legato in his phrasing, which heightens the music...  although people have criticized him for this.  Well, they do this because, he is better than what they are used to and, in order to justify their auditory inadequacies, defile and defy what is simply better (or should I say Butter).  Tempos are perfect...  A little slow on the entry of the giants (Rheingold), but that's my only complaint.  Great sound quality and Brian Large makes it an experience, rather than a task.  I can't say enough about this ring...  It brought me to tears multiple times. Years of fun await the owner of this great masterpiece of human accomplishment!

If you aren't familiar with Wagner's Ring cycle, or you know the music but haven't seen it, this box set is definintely your best bet.  It doesn't have any political or artistic agenda - it mostly follows what was called for originally.  My impression in the audience was that this is what it would have looked like if you saw Nordic mythology taking place.  And Nordic mythology is the ostensible topic of these operas, you can decide for yourself whether you're interested in possible subtexts.  None of this is to say that this production doesn't have depth or subtlety, or that it's ""stodgy.""  Staging the Ring is a big undertaking, and this was a fantastic realization of that endeavor, with great attention to detail.

1784104,5,B00006L9ZT,"Most of the reviewers of this DVD set of Wagner's ""Ring"" are seasoned Wagnerites.  Thus we get some quibbling about this or that stage effect, high or low note, and the like.  I'm writing as a Wagner neophyte.

The lasting impression these DVDs made on me was that the only way to learn to appreciate Wagner is to actually visualize his operas in a dramatic performance. One can then turn to the CD versions with a proper sense of the music. This may sound so obvious as to be simple-minded.  Yet there is a difference between Wagner's ""musical dramas"" and such works as Madame Butterfly, Carmen,, etc.  One can listen to the latter and learn to enjoy the musical arias without ever seeing the operas performed.  This is not true with Wagner. His operas do not contain arias - grand songs that are set pieces separated by recitative.

Since live performances of The Ring are scarce and actually non-existent where I live this DVD set is invaluable.  I've listened to CDs of The Ring while reading the libretto, read interpretive books, and listened to CDs expounding the meaning of the leitmotifs. Yet the full impact and meaning of the Cycle was not comprehended until watching these DVDs.

Having praised Levine's DVD production so highly I must make one quibble.  Although I'm relatively new to Wagner, I'm not new to classical music or opera in general.  To my eyes and ears Hildegard Behrens as Brunnhilde is the only flaw of note in this production.  I get the feeling that she is past her prime and although she gives it a mighty effort the power and the drama are just not there.  But this is not enough of a quibble to deduct a star.",1157328000,18,1642,4.582191780821918

1784106,4,B00006L9ZT,"Many reviewers are very negative about this production but I do not think their objections are clearly thought through.  To begin with the plot of the ring is a mythological fantasy and much of it is clearly absurd. Updating it only makes the absurdities more ludicrous.  For all his musical genius, Wagner clearly needed a librettist (like Arrigo Boito, perhaps) or at least an editor.  So often there is too much music separating a statement and its response.  This does not allow for anything like realistic acting.  The cast in this performance was certainly chosen for visual appearance as well as vocal ability given the fact that there would be many closeups.  It is also noteworthy that there are hardly any big wobbley voice in evidence which so often happens with larger voices who can easily ride above all that orchestral sound.  Nobody can quibble with Morris's Wotan.  He has a beautiful sound and acts well enough.  Behrens never had what I would call a beautiful voice and it is not large.  The chest voice is certainly not pleasant but she uses it as needed.  The fact that she gets through the role attests to her knowledge of how to sing, even if the result is not always satisfying.  She looks the part more than other singers I can think of.  (Some like Gwyneth Jones as Brunhilde but that wobble is a liabilty)  Jerusalem is awkward as Siegfried but he is trying to be vital and boyish and athletic but the music does not support his efforts.  This is a killer role and a more beefy tenor would not be able to be as bouyant as he is.  Late in his life Wagner conceded that he wrote his tenor parts too high.  We have to admire that Jerusalem does as well as he does.  Ludwig has always been a favorite singer of mine but again, her acting is hampered by too much music.  What can these characters do but stand there and sing and then wait for a while until their next line comes by?  Seeing things on film makes us much more demanding in what we expect of acting while singing.  Wagner might have been nonplussed by the amount of acting going on nowadays in productions of this cycle.  Wagner set out to creat a total work of theater but I think failed in part from a seeming lack of understanding of dramatic timing.  Everything goes on far too long...and then following section tells all about what happened in the previous part.  Of course, it is the music which keeps us coming back to the work.  For grandeur, orchestral color and originality there is nothing like it in all of music.  But we have to be realitic about the inhuman demands that the composer placed upon his singers.  Those that look like the characters in the story rarely have the large bodies that would produce the heroic sounds that the music demands.

1784110,3,B00006L9ZT,"It's a sign of our modern temperament that a production that hovers, more or less, around what Wagner dramaturgically envisioned is the subject of so much harsh criticism, precisely for being ""traditional.""  Whatever.  Anyway, because this production is visually so not-distracting, the music is more - oh, I don't know - *available*.  But by making the music more available, the focus of this production becomes the musicians, and here, that proves to be a mixed blessing at best.

The worst part of this DVD set is the casting.  There is some fine music-making here, don't get me wrong.  But by bringing the music to the forefront here, both the virtues and the faults of the musicians are more glaring.  Behrens's Brynhilde and Jerusalem's Siegfried (although not his Loge) are the biggest problems and that makes for a pretty serious problem considering the importance of their respective roles - which shaved two big stars off a presumed five from this reviewer.

So, what's good about it? James Morris's Wotan justifies the almost universal critical approval that came his way, and makes even the god's boring bits near erotic with musical precision and the natural creaminess of his voice (compare Morris's weak Hans Sachs in the Met's Meistersinger now available on DVD).  Matti Salminen is darker than dark as, respectively, Fafner in Rhinegold and Hagen in Gotterdammerung.  In fact, Salminen  completely dominates every scene he's in, most effectively in Hagen's Watch, the summoning of the regiment prior to Gunther's return with Brynilde in tow, and the Vengeance Trio in Gotterdammerung.  One can't praise him enough.  Christa Ludwig is noteworthy as Fricka in Rhinegold and Walkyre, and Waltraute in Gotterdammerung, although her voice had thinned out by the time this was recorded.  Siegfried Jerusalem's Loge is quite satisfying, which makes his failure as Siegfried more pathetic.  Jessye Norman and Gary Lakes as the doomed Sieglinde & Siegmund make lovely music but are hard to watch.  Still, I count this casting as one of the stronger points of this set, if only for the voluptuous force-of-nature which is Norman's inimitable voice;  Lakes is also very pleasant to listen to.  The problems, of course are their physical enormity - both singers are massive - and the unfortunate fact that it takes a mighty big suspension of disbelief to imagine these two as Nordic twins.

And speaking of forces of nature the Met orchestra and James Levine's use of it to shape the musical foundation of this production is, by far, the best reason to buy these DVD's.  Wagner's orchestra is a major player in all of his operas, but most demandingly here. It functions as a kind of Greek chorus, continuously commenting on the drama as it unfolds, giving us insight into the drama by it's use of big musical motif's. Such insight is doubly important here in light of this performance's awkward casting and relative dearth of dramatic ideas.

Now, all that said, we now turn to Behrens and Jerusalem.  (Anthony Raffell and Hanna Lisowska's Gunther and Gutrune are terrible - perhaps appropriately terrible for their smarmy brother/sister act - but that's nothing compared to the stunning failures of this Brynhilde and Siegfried.) Behrens used to have a remarkably beautiful voice, but she's not a natural Brynhilde.  The music is too big for her and she's worn out long before her almost excruciating Immolation Scene. Similarly, Siegfried Jerusalem, so fine as Loge in Das Rhinegold, is way, way, way overtaxed as Seigfried. Moreover, these two singers never found the theatrical motivations of their characters - Behrens is vague and almost embarassed, it seems, especially during the first scene she's in in Act 2 of Walkyre where she has to cavort around the stage with James Morris's dramatically stiff Wotan; Jerusalem is already barking out his lines in the first act of Siegfried and he never finds the hero's center of gravity; hence his constant, breathy overstatment of the music.  By the immolation scene, Siegfried has been (gratefully) dispatched and Behrens' Brynhilde has lost so much authority (what authority it had to begin with) that the musical hugeness of her character, never having gotten off the ground in the first place here, is painfully exhausted.

In the end, the blessings of this set are mixed, as are virtually all productions of virtually everything. Great work muscially from the orchestra, Morris, Salminen and to a lesser extent Norman and Lakes (who, despite his awkward girth, would have made for a better Siegfried than Jerusalm had he the stamina - which is a big if that I don't know the answer to).  Add to this the excellent music making of the Rhinemaidens, Norns, Erda and the incomperable Met chorus, and you have a Ring that's hard to dismiss, even for its glaring faults.",1114905600,79,4826,5.03140703517588
1784111,5,B00006L9ZT,"The Met's now classic Ring has been lauded to the heavens and criticized for its lack of innovation.  It's a personal thing, I believe, and I believe this is a Ring to stand the test of time.

Traditional doesn't need to be a bad word, and this Ring resounds with glorious performances from the opening of Das Rheingold through the destruction of Valhalla and the flooding of the Rhine.  It's a glorious, operatic adventure of a lifetime.

Some may quibble that Hildegard Behrens isn't a true dramatic soprano, but her fierce will, and often lovely voice, combined with an intensity that is electrifying make this a Brunhilde to treasure.

James Morris's Wotan, Christa Ludwig's Fricka, Matti Salminen, and the rest of the cast offer big committed performances under James Levine's baton.  The production values are not stinted on here and we really get a sense of Wagner's ""gesamtkunstwerk"" or ""total work of art.""

1784135,4,B00006L9ZT,"This has all the makings of a classic but ultimately it falls short; unlike a ring it is not perfik.

Firstly, I would like to say that I am delighted to be able to see a proper traditional staging of the Ring of the Nibelung instead of the usual half-baked, unintelligent modern productions I am treated to at my local opera house. Who wants to see Wotan as a mob leader and the Rhinemaidens as lap dancers!?! In what sense do such interpretations conform to Wagner's ideology that his operas, layden in symbolism as they are, portray worlds that exist outside space and time and hence outside any historical period. To impose a contemporary setting on a Wagner opera is to show a complete lack of understanding as to how these operas can be produced.

Anyway, it certainly makes a difference having such a traditional renditon of 'der Ring des Nibelungen' and there is no doubt that there are moments in this opera when I do feel drawn 'outside space and time'.

Now for some gripes.

I have perused many of the reviews of this DVD box set and I am in agreement that there have been some miscastings. I suppose over four operas it is almost inevitable that one or other of the lead performers is not going to be ideal or is not going to be to everyone's liking and I am willing to accept that the challenge of Wagner's staging and acting/singing requirements are unlikely to be ever completly met to my liking. Nevertheless, I feel that above all Siegfried Jerusalem, whilst excellent as Loge in 'das Rheingold', doesn't convince as his namesake in operas 3 and 4. Firstly, he is about twenty years too old which really does detract from credibility. Secondly, his acting is overly hammy; i know that Siegfried is something of a caricature but I think such an enthusiastic and grinning performance would be more commensurate with a tenor in his early twenties. Jerusalem also lacks the stature of a Siegfried-esque hero. He needs to be more upright and arrogant, in sum more gravitas needed.

I think Hildegard Behrens is another who doesn't quite fit the bill. The basic problem is that she seems too feeble to be Brunnhilde. She lacks power in her presence and also in her voice and is also devoid of a nymphish arrogance so important to the lead Valkyrie. In her defence I would say that her essence of vulnerability contrasts well with the authorative performance of James Morris as Wotan particularly in the culminating scene of Act 3 of 'die Walkure' which is excellent.

These are the most essential problems.

Other lesser gripes include:

Lack of stage action during 'ride of the Valkyries' to synchronise with the power of the music.

Dodgy acting by Gary Lakes as Siegmund in 'die Walkure' - his eyes are all over the place presumably looking at the conductor, which is very distracting.

Obvious lack of physical resemblance between Siegmund and Sieglinde.

Gripes aside I think there are many positives about this production.

The performances by those playing the parts of Wotan (as mentioned), Alberich, Mime, Sieglinde, Gunther, Hagen, Erda and the Rhinemaidens are all very good I thought, in terms of both singing and acting which are frankly of equal importance. The staging is generally top notch with a particularly spectacular finale in Gotterdamerung and a beautifully ethereal Valhalla, not to mention a well used apparent holographic effect on Erda and the Norns.

I disagree with a popular opinion amongst reviewers here that there is a lack of movement and energy on the set. I don't think serious Wagner operas generally require a lot of running around and pointless animation but when it was required there were good dynamics e.g. the relationship between Siegfried and Mime, Loge's character. I don't really want to see Wotan running around in circles after Brunnhilde or Fricke frankly. I also thought Levine did a good job of conducting and I much preferred his interpretation of the pivotal 'Siegfried's funeral march' to the typically brass drowned Solti version.

So all in all, this is certainly a worthwhile purchase and for serious Wagner fans to be preferred over any pretentious and paradoxically trivial modern staged version. With the exception of some cast changes I think this version is about as good a version of 'the Ring' as you're going to get though I think an animated version would be a very interesting idea as mentioned by another reviewer here.

Ultimately, no one version of the Ring is going to be to everyone's liking. Nothing is perfik, not even my spelling.",1097366400,15,4519,4.827943078913325

At least some negative reviewers are honest enough to admit that maybe Wagner is just ""not their cup of tea"" (it is certainly understandable that his grandiose gestures are not for everybody).
Let me put it this way, when one considers all the elements that it takes to bring off a successful realization of Wagner's massive conception--and to do it in the original Romantic spirit that Wagner intended (not some space age reinterpretation)--there has never been a better version of the Ring on ""video"" (or DVD, in this case)...nor is their likely to be, anytime soon. I would normally give this set four-and-a-half stars, but I am giving it five stars to ""bring up the average"" a little, since a three-and-a-half star average review is simply not acceptable--or accurate--imho.",1084665600,38,1347,5.0675675675675675

Unfortunately, I'm rather disappointed by what I see, as the performance is quite lifeless. I suppose the stage director is to blame, for he has failed to ignite much fire and passion on the stage despite all those high drama inherent to the work.
This is not helped by the indifferent acting and singing of the cast. I admire the Met's orchestra, though, who is captured here on top form. Yet, Levine's ponderous musical direction is not at all to my taste.

1784141,5,B00006L9ZT,"I can't begin to say how much this production of Der Ring des Nibelungen has meant to me.  I first saw it when it aired on TV back in 1990.  I was eight years old, and was hooked.  My parents were somewhat surprised that I was so into it - and although it's certainly an impressive thing to be interested in at eight, I wasn't allowed to stay up late to watch the endings!  The whole collection of operas, the beautiful music and the magical stories had me completely captivated.  It started my whole love of opera, and made me a Wagner fan for life.
I was so glad that they finally released this version on DVD.  Frankly, I didn't want to see any other - it was this one that meant so much to me.  Hildegard Behrens has a voice from the heavens, and I for one was not surprised when she was acclaimed ""The greatest living Brunnhilde.""  She deserves it.  Apart from an amazing voice, she has the face and figure to carry off the role, and does a beautiful job.  However the one who stole the show for me was Siegfried Jerusalem.  He takes on two roles here: Loge and Siegfried, and brings such a youthful energy to the part - he IS Siegfried.  I can't imagine anyone doing a better job.
Some reviewers have commented on this bogging down at times and being slow-paced.  Remember folks, we're talking about 15 hours of Wagner.  You'd have to be crazy to try and watch it all at once.  But if it could keep an eight-year-old perfectly still for four nights in a row - that definately says something.  Lavine's conducting is respectful to the music, and doesn't rush it.  The first American-born conductor at the Met to tackle Wagner's Ring does a first-class job.  True, there are parts that tend to drag - but that's unavoidable.  They are few and far between.  The stories of the operas and the fabulous music is top-notch.  I can't recommend this set more.",1055808000,156,1857,4.387096774193548

It's great to have a production with traditional sets, in particular as we're often nowadays treated to so many stupid productions with all those irrelevant ""up-dates"". Unfortunately, the stage direction here is insufficiently lively and often unimaginative, thus making several of the scenes fall flat.
On the musical side, there are a number of flaws in the casting with several singers either past their prime or are physically unconvincing in their roles. The orchestra of the Met does a great job, but the effort is marred by Levine's rather stodgy conducting.

1784155,4,B00006L9ZT,"TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY Der Ring des Nibelungen, and which one to buy: Met or Bayreuth? Der Ring des Nibelungen is arguably the greatest work of art ever created by a single individual. If you know about and love music enough to be reading this, then you have no choice but to buy one. Like other reviewers, I recommend the Met version to start, because it is most faithful to Wagner's stage directions, so you get a better idea about the work's original conceptualization. However, I would expect that you would want to follow up later with the purchase of the Bayreuth Chreau Ring :o) I own and have listened to both many times.

Overall, the Met Ring is very satisfying. The first two acts of Die Walkre were the least effective of the entire set of four operas, in my opinion. Despite some great singing, I just did not feel the chemistry that must occur between Siegmund and Sieglinde. For me, these two acts in the Chreau production (including Gwyneth Jones' Brnhilde) are worth the price of the entire Bayreuth set. However, the poignant and powerful third act farewell scene between Wotan and Brnhilde in the Met production more than makes up for the first two acts. Also notably powerful in the Met performance (besides Matti Salminen's astounding Hagen) was the scene of the swearing of the oath on the spear by Brnhilde and Siegfried in Gtterdamerung, which Behrens -- as a relatively light and clear voiced Brnhilde -- sings with great dramatic intensity.

To those of you who are uncertain if you want to invest the time, money, and emotional energy in exploring this work through the available DVDs, I agree with many of the harshest critical reviews, at a technical level. However, DO NOT let any reported shortcomings of either set stop you from purchasing one or the other! The tone of most of these criticisms suggests that they come from people who are passionate about the Ring, but for whom the reality of the performances captured on DVD simply does not measure up to the Ring they have idealized.

The point is this fellow Music Lover: the Ring is worth learning about and experiencing. But guess what? There will NEVER be a flawless live performance of a complete cycle. What's more, people will never completely agree on the impact and quality of any given element of any given performance. Both the Met and Bayreuth sets have strengths that overwhelm and weaknesses that you can overlook: overlook because flawed performances, however objectively or subjectively perceived and evaluated, are simply all that can be expected from flawed human beings striving toward an ideal. ""True Wagnerites"" :) should appreciate this point as one the Ring itself makes overwhelmingly.

Bottom line, the Met Ring is my recommendation for starters. However, if you are new to Wagner, before laying down your money, here is a way to ease into the Ring that lets you bail out if it is just not your cup of tea:

-- FIRST read the Thomas & Kane or Russell et al. comic book version to understand the basic story.

-- SECOND, listen to the Met Opera CD set of four lectures, ""Talking About the Ring,"" to understand how the story is represented musically.

-- FINALLY, read Bryan Magee's, ""The Tristan Chord: Wagner and Philosophy,"" to understand why the story is what it is, and something about why it has such power to move us.

After experiencing the Met Ring, get the Bayreuth Chreau Ring, if for no other reason, but to glory in the stunningly memorable and moving performances of the great Jeannine Altmeyer and Peter Hoffman as Sieglinde and Siegmund in Walkre!",1053907200,41,3569,4.754442649434572
1784156,4,B00006L9ZT,"The praise and criticism of the two DVD Ring cycles make for interesting reading, but I would recommend the Met recording for the majority of mainstream opera listeners, particularly those who have not previously seen a live production. The staging and set design conform reasonably to Wagner's original descriptions (and he was quite explicit about these details), and the vocal and acting performances are satisfactory. Matti Salminen's Hagen was a singular performance highlight for me. The Met orchestra plays splendidly throughout with tighter miking which allows details of quieter passages to be heard more easily. I found myself frequently adjusting the volume of the Bayreuth set as the dynamics varied; but that orchestra performs brilliantly as well, and Boulez does generally move things along more briskly than Levine. I honestly think that both readings are acceptable interpretations of the score's dynamics. Those who have seen ""traditional"" Rings may prefer the novelty of Chereau's Bayreuth sets; but for me, the industrial settings drain the mythological feel of the work in an annoyingly distracting way. The Bayreuth vocal and acting performances are superb, so I did come to tolerate it; but seeing Hagen and the vassals carrying spears while wearing coats and ties ultimately seems rather silly. One can hope that the best features of both sets will be combined for an ""ultimate"" 5-star DVD Ring in the future.

1784157,5,B00006L9ZT,"Technically, I'd prefer to give this 4 1/2 stars. This rendition is not perfect, but it is far better than some of my fellow reviewers would have you believe. I own Rheingold and Walkre in DVD, and have seen Siegfried and Gtterdmmerung on VHS. I'll be adding the latter two to my collection as money permits. I have watched the entire cycle now twice. I would like to see the Bayreuth/Boulez production, but no library around my home area has them.
About the only criticisms I agree are (1) Behrens sometimes seems under-powered for the role; (2) the acting is sometimes less than dramatically powerful. I was also initially disappointed that there are no real horses in the Ride of the Valkyries, or the conclusion of Gtterdmmerung. (There is a local Christian theater that uses live animals on its stage; why wouldn't the greatest opera house in the world be able to do it?)
In defense of Behrens, at least she isn't fat or ugly. She convincingly protrays a beautiful warrior-maid who surrenders herself to human love only to be betrayed. I could go on at length about the artistic virtues of each of the other major characters; suffice it to say that they are all world-class. Morris as Wotan and Hagen (sorry, don't have the actor's name at hand) are especially powerful and convincing; Jerusalem as Loge and Siegfried is almost as good. Contrary to at least one other reviewer, Act I of Walkre (the meeting and elopement of Sieglinde and Siegmund) is well-done by Norman and Lake, respectively.
The dramatic flaws are more than made up for by the intimacy allowed by television: the good-bye between Wotan and Brnnhilde (end of Walkre) is over-whelming; the reforging of Notung, the double oath sworn on Hagen's spear by Brnnhilde and Siegfried, and their love scene at the end of Siegfried, are just some of the highlights that come to mind as powerful, moving...(add your favorite adverb of artistic excellence).
Whatever the virtues of the Bayreuth DVD production, I think that any person who wants to enjoy, appreciate, and understand Wagner's Ring owes it to himself/herself to see a traditional production. I will continue to enjoy the Met Ring for years to come.",1052870400,22,2174,4.846774193548387

Unfortunately, this set does not live up to expectations. One of the major reasons is that the performances captured here have been very unevely cast. Some of the singers are distinctly below their best and some (like Behrens's Brunnhilde) shouldn't have been singing their roles at all.
Another reason for my disappointment arises from the conducting of Levine, which I found to be lethargic and dramatically stunted. The orchestra performed very well, though. But as an interpretation, it lacks fire and drama.
The production loses much of its grandeur when viewed through a home TV (unless one has a very large and wide-screen TV set), and the stage direction is merely dutiful. Some of the stage effects are also too much subdued.
I'll award this set 2 stars.",1049328000,15,976,4.9573170731707314

That said, the vocal performance still disappoints in several respects. The Brunnhilde is frankly inadequate as her voice is not heroic enough and there are bad patches of singing in the lower register. Some of the singers are past their prime, sounding worn and tired (like Ludwig's Fricka) and some, while singing gorgeously are simply not convincing in their parts (Norman's Sieglinde leaps to the mind). Others (like the Wotan and Rhinemaidens) are hampered by poor stage direction, and the standard of acting is not too remarkable. Although the orchestra of the Metropolitan orchestra performs extremely well, Levine plodding tempo impedes the forward flow of the drama and severely tested some of the singers. The stage direction is merely adequate and there are some grave disappointments just like the whole of Rheingold and the ending of Gotterdammerung.

1784161,5,B00006L9ZT,"According to the liner notes that accompany this seven-DVD set of Wagner's ""Der Ring des Nibelungen,"" the composer had no time for critics, especially those who liked to point out a certain lack of logic in his musical dramas.
(Take that, Anna Russell! - Entire careers have been based on making fun of the Ring Cycle's plot.)
This Met version of the Ring under the direction of James Levine might be called 'traditional' by some and 'stodgy' by others.  There are no Siegfrieds in space suits or Rhine Maidens cavorting in front of a hydroelectric dam.  Special effects have been kept to a minimum--a rather tame dragon (although wonderfully sung by Matti Salminen who also is a great, brooding hulk of a Hagen), no goat-drawn chariots, no flying horses.  In fact there are no horses at all, which makes for a slightly surreal funeral scene in 'Gtterdmmerung' where Brnnhilde is supposed to sing to her horse, Grane, then ride him into the flames of Siegfried's funeral pyre.
However, the Ring isn't about special effects or acting.  It's about Wagner's glorious music.  I've only seen one other Ring Cycle--Patrice Chreau's 1976 Bayreuth production (also out on DVD)--and he (incorrectly, I think) emphasized the stage drama rather than the music.  He also ignored Wagner's mythical setting and tried to turn the Ring into a statement about nineteenth-century robber-barons.
Levine's version, stodgy though it may appear, emphasizes the music.  This is the Ring Cycle you want to start with.  It reflects the spirit of Wagner's intentions (if not quite the actual staging), and the singing is excellent.  This is not the dream cast from the golden age of Wagnerian singers, but wait till you hear Jessye Norman as Sieglinde, ringing out her ""Oh hehrstes Wunder!"" just after her whole world comes crashing down around her.  If this unearthly cry doesn't send chills down your spine, maybe Wagner isn't for you.  One of the other reviewers felt that Norman was too loud for the other singers, but I think just the opposite is true.  James Morris is a complex, ultimately tragic Wotan.  Hildegard Behrens is a brilliant, intuitive Brnnhilde. Their final scene together in 'Die Wlkre,' as Wotan puts his daughter to sleep within a ring of fire is one of the high points of this Ring.  But the one truly Wagnerian voice in this production belongs to Jessye Norman.

Even the presence of the biggest stars cannot guarantee that the evening is a success, either because of production flaws or that the singers are below their best.
I'm afraid this is the case for this Ring production. Watching it live on the stage, one may overlook some, but not all, of its defects, having been overwhelmed by Wagner's great music dramas and also the sense of occasion. However, the weaknesses of this production are all exposed on DVD when one views it at home.
The production is a boring one - the direction is unimaginative and in quite a few instances leave one distinctly underwhelmed. The singing is also ordinary. Some of the singers are below their best or have past their prime. Some are over-stretched by their roles while some have little charm in terms of stage presence and acting. It is a very uneven production and enjoyable episodes are separated by bland and tedious moments.

1784163,5,B00006L9ZT,"German romanticism, as well as opera itself, reached a zenith when Richard Wagner composed the four part opera cycle, Ring Of The Nibelung. It was his most ambitious and his most innovative opera. Wagner spent many years working on the score and libretto, changing the course of opera's history. Opposed to the traditional bel canto and grand opera styles that dominated the opera world in the late 19th century, Wagner composed what he considered music of the future, ""music dramas."" The focus was not so much the brilliant singing, nor the lavish spectacle, but the music engaging the audience with the drama unfolding on the stage. Drama and music combined created a tremendous power like audiences had never before seen. Wagner's professional jealousy of other composers, and the frustration that some Europeans disliked his new art, lead him to misunderstanding and belittliing Jewish composers such as Giacomo Meyerbeer. When his friend, the German existentialist philosopher Nietzche approved of Carmen and took a strong disliking to Wagner's operas, their friendship was broken. Wagner was a man whose tastes and ideas were radical at the time. Some of his music was even shocking, much like rock stars of late project themselves. Wagner created the motif, a theme that represents a character or part of the story, such as romance, jealousy, a curse, etc. He woved those themes delicately and combined them to fit high drama. Never is this more accurate then with Ring of the Nibelung. The great operas have influenced psychologists, fiction writers and epic filmmakers. The motif has been used by John Williams (music composer of such films as Indiana Jones and the Star Wars Trilogy) and there has to have been some influence over the fantasy writers J.R.R. Tolkien, whose ""ring of doom"" forged by Sauron and Frodo's task to destroy it, seems to be similar to the ring on the Wagner operas.
Taken from the Norse legends, the opera Rhinegold begins when Albrecht, a hideous dwarf, proposes sexualand romantic encounters with the mermaid Rhinemaidens, who guard the Rhinegold. When they mock him and tease him with the magic gold, Albrecht is tempted to steal the gold for himself. Even if he never finds love, he will have the greatest power in the universe. Stealing the gold, the problems that ensue are the tragedy of the opera- mankind's greed and thirst for power. In Valhalla, the home of the gods, Odin has problems of his own. His wife Freya has been promised to be sold to the giants who constructed Valhalla castle. The complicated first opera ends with the curse of the ring.
The second opera, The Valkyrie, introduces the characters of Siegmund and Sieglende, parents of the later hero, Siegfried. Their love is forbidden, and this angers Freja who convinces her husband Odin to have them killed. Odin sends his right hand Valkyrie, his own daughter Brunhilde, to do the job. Brunhilde is the archetypical, stereotypical opera heroine, with the horned helmet, breastplate and spear, as she is a divine warrior who gathers the fallen Norsemen to Valhalla. Her catchy operatic cries are ""Hojotoho Hia!"" which she repeats ad nauseum with the rest of the Valkyries during the famous ""Ride of the Valkyries."" Brunhilde sympathizes with the lovers Siegmund and Sieglende (who is now pregnant with Siegfried). She spares their lives. But when Odin hears of her defiance and disobediance, he casts a dark spell upon Brunhilde. She is to sleep surrounded in fire until a hero awakens her with a kiss.
That hero is Siegfried, who is the title hero of the third opera. In the story, Siegfried forges his father's sword Nothung from a tree. He defeats the dragon Falfner. With the dragon's blood, he is able to commune with nature. Siegfried then brakes through the mystic fire and awakens Brunhilde with a kiss. The two are married and live happily along the banks of the Rhine river. In the final opera, Twilight of The Gods, Siegfried longs for adventure again after marital peace, and journeys down the river Rhine. But he falls into enemy hands, the Gibechung giants, who kill him. When Brunhilde hears of this, she become so grief stricken that she immolates herself in Siegfried's funeral pyre. The world comes to an end through fire and flood, Valhalla burns, the Rhine river overfloods. The ring, the symbol of power and greed again comes into the hands of the Rhinemaidens. The romantic, serene strings in the orchestra seem to say that true love (Brunhilde's love for Siegfried) has triumphed, and a new world order will begin as fresh and new as the first day of creation.",1042761600,13,4593,4.950777202072539

Ludwig, late in her career at the time of this production, disappoints as Fricka. Behrens is simply over-parted as Brunnhilde. Morris is an adequate Wotan and Jerusalem a pleasing Siegfried.

 Avoiding a director's natural tendency to become a bit of a prima donna by trying to put one's own stamp on a production, James Levine rises higher, and presents a faithful, authentic production of the Ring. As most folks eventually come to learn, there are invariably compromises in any production. One has better staging, one has better singing, better acting, better lighting, and so forth. This MET production has pretty high scores in all areas.
 One of the more outstanding aspects of operatic works on dvd is the added dimension afforded by subtitles. The English subtitles help viewers get so much more out of the Ring, and for those with some understanding of German, switching to German subtitles will help them understand more of the precise meanings of this musical dramatic representation.
 James Morris,exhibiting grace and majesty as well as excellent singing, may well be the Wotan of the century. Hildegard Behrens dispels the ""fat lady"" stereotype of a Valkry, as she portrays a young, energetic, warrior-daughter of Wotan. Heinz Zednik is a splendid Loge, who seems to inquire of the audience if they can see the implications which present actions will have on future situations. Matti Salminen is the ultimate Hagen, exuding evil from his singing and his cold-blooded stares. I do find I must agree with other reviewers who have suggested that Jessye Norman and Gary Lakes do not make a credible pair of young Walsung twins, even for those who are adept at ""suspension of disbelief.""
 Levine and the MET orchestra play superbly. Staging and scenery are traditional and very well-done. Gil Wechsler deserves all his acclaim for his brillance in lighting direction: who can forget Wotan's aria, ""Diesen Augen, leuchtendes paar...?""
It would be easy to watch ""The Ring,"" again and again, learning more about it, and about life, with each viewing.
 All in all, people who like opera, especially opera with a storyline, grand drama, and an invitation to think philosophically about the meaning of life--such individuals will likely find this Metropolitan Opera performance of Wagner's Ring, a delightful addition to their lives.",1040601600,24,2344,5.107049608355092

The outrageous scenic demands, the fantasy elements, the horrific demands on the singers make it almost impossible to fully realize Wagner's vision.

Granted, many critics and opera affecianatos have hated this production.  They have called it ""too lush,"" ""too old fashioned"" or ""too easy.""  But it is these elements which will make the opera comprehensible to the newcomer.  Some of the more modern productions have been visually interesting, and indeed made the viewer rethink the story and its meaning to contemporary audiences.  But too often they zero in on one aspect or meaning to the expense of others.  Chereau's Industrial Ring was a fascinating production, but after awhile I couldn't get past some jarring inconsistencies, especially the clash between the fantasy elements and the gritty ""real world"" in which it was set.  Why would Alberich want to control a magic ring, when he could organize a union or lead a workers' revolt?  How is it that the world could progress into the Industrial Age but not understand the concept of money?  Does taking an elevator really convey the descent into the underground caverns of the dwarves?  And so on --  a mechanical dragon, the forging scene all seem even more silly when forced into ""reality.""  Other staged productions fare no better... watching the laser show of another production brings to mind a late night stoner session watching Pink Floyd.  Others have twisted the story so much that characters show up at inappropriate (and unscripted) times, new endings are tacked on, and so forth... all in the name of making the operas ""relevant.""  Herein lies the strength of the Met's production - it tries to bring Wagner's vision to life, not that of some ambitious director.  Set in a fantasy world of gods, heroes, and magic, the story flows more naturally and the elements have broader resonance.  The sets, lighting, and presentation of the opera are particular strengths of this DVD.  I doubt if the Rhineland has ever come to life in such a brilliant, visually stunning way, and those who fell under the spell of the recent ""Lord of the Rings"" movies should find many similarities here.  The singing is not quite the caliber of the ""golden age"" but is generally fine.  Levine and the orchestra are in tip-top form here... rarely do opera's sound this good!  The acting is not this production's greatest strength, but several performers do quite well.  Ludwig, Morris, Beherns are quite good, an Jerusalem is one of the better Siegfrieds around.  Sure, viewers can ultimately move on to more complex productions, but this is the best place to start for those hoping to make that first plunge into Wagner's Ring.",1038873600,228,3070,4.960861056751468
1784170,4,B00006L9ZT,"First and foremost the question must be asked if you could live with this performance of the Ring on DVD. Most assuredly yes, for though the production is not without its flaws, it is an entertaining evening, or evenings, well spent. Since these are live broadcasts and not studio bound, you will have some vocal frailties come forth. Jerusalem is vocally spent by the third act of Siegfried but admirably holds his own agianst a fresh voiced Behrens. Morris is a noble Wotan and was starting to get the full measure of the role, from the youthful power hungry god in Rheingold to the world weary wanderer in Siegfried. Heinz Zednik and Ekkehard Waschiha play the villinous Mime and Alberic perfectly, Zednik relying less on his usual comic camp than in previous productions. Finally kudos must be given to Matti Salminen who is evil incarnate in the role of Hagan. His black bass and imposing characterization are a pleasure to hear and watch. On the negative there is Jessye Norman who possesses a voice which is simply too powerful for the role of Seglinde. Also her acting ability, along with Gary Lakes as Sigmund, leaves much to be desired...you felt no passion between the two which is essential in understanding their parts. While James Levine does not take the quick tempos of Bohm's justly praised Bayreuth performance, he is not as dull as many believe,and the pacing and drama in the second act of Gotterdammerung is the highlight of this Ring. The costumes (no space suits or tuxedoes here) and sets are not a distraction, and that's a compliment, considering so many produtions rely on visual eye candy to hide other inadequecies in the performance. It was no small fact that many Europeans came to the MET to see this Ring because they were tired of the pseudo new age productions that proliferated in their homelands.
So, since there will not be a truckload of alternate Ring cycle's flooding the market, I suggest you not hesitate in purchasing this fine adaption. Recommended, with minor reservations.",1038614400,30,2019,4.855072463768116
1784171,2,B00006L9ZT,"I'm afraid this production doesn't making very enjoyable viewing/listening as the performances get gradually worse as the cycle progresses.
Rheingold proves to be a promising start, but the tension begins to sag a bit in Walkure. A big decline in performance standards greets the viewer/listener in Siegfried whereas Gotterdammerung provides an anti-climatic end through some lifeless tempos and inadequate singing.
I'm OK with the staging but it isn't much help to the performance as a whole. I've no regret buying the set, but I'm indeed quite disappointed by the performances.",1038096000,10,579,5.444444444444445
1784172,2,B00006L9ZT,"I must disagree with anyone who suggests that Levine's conducting is no good. I find his interpretation in this cycle absolutely astounding! Few conductors, past or present, is able to have such a complete mastery of this difficult score, and Levine has it in his blood. He is here supported by the Met's orchestra in top form. What more can one ask?
However, I must voice my dissatisfaction with 2 aspects of this production. The first is the bland direction. I like traditional stagings. But traditional stagings don't mean that the stage directions have to be as unimaginative and static as what we see here. The same can be said of the sets, which are a little too rigid from a visual perspective.
But it's the singing that is most disappointing. No one would reasonably expect that the singing here can compare with the best of the past. Yet, much of the singing here is uninspiring and, in one crucial role, less than competent. I'm referring here to the inadequate Brunnhilde of Hildegard Behrens. While her silvery top register do give pleasure, her patchy voice often ruins Brunnhilde's phrases. In my view, she's overparted. Siegfried Jerusalem, though slightly past his prime, is much more satisfactory. However, Lakes and Norman disappoint as the Walsung twins, as they're not that suitable for the parts, both physically and vocally. Morris is, by contrast, a commanding Wotan.
On the whole, I can give this set only 2 stars, most of it being earned by Levin and the orchestra. The other aspects of this production is, honestly, not that up to standard.",1037836800,20,1566,4.868913857677903

7971140,5,B00006L9ZT,"This in my opinion is a classic presentation of Wagner's Ring. It is very traditional with great voices and acting. While Wagner puts philosophy to music, it often repels some listeners. Nevertheless if you want to enjoy 18-hours of Wagner's vanity, this is the best. Why watch other production with abstract sets - better to read a philosophy book than endure hours of Wagner's perverted thinking. One cannot deny the great genius of Wagner's music and it reminds you of the ancient Vikings.",1514764800,,492,4.9397590361445785
