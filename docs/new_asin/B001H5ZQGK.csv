8308005,4,B001H5ZQGK,"The only complaint I really have about this DVD is it is hard to follow the moving tab in the ""play along"" portion.  It can't be slowed down which is something I like to be able to do when learning a new song.  I think it would also be nice to have written tab included in the booklet so you could follow along more easily and practice without having to run the DVD.

Other than that this DVD rocks!  Robbie is one of my favorite bassists!  I would love to play like that!",1264204800,,472,4.032258064516129
