The DVD comes in a slim case packaging, and the movie seemed very blurry and dark. So the rendition of this dvd is bad.
But the movie itself is far worse (in my opinion). If you are a religious hindu and would like to learn about Sati Anusuya or the birth of Data Treya, then go read a book about it. You'll learn more.

If you still want to buy this dvd, then I suggest that you first watch clips of it on youtube or anyother site, or rent it if you possible can, and then think about buying. Im sure you can use your money wisely elsewhere.",1344729600,,587,3.9661016949152543
