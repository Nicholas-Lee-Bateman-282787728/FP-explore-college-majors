This video has an incredible amount of information.  I have used it in conjunction with working with a professional trainer.  I have literally been studying this DVD and taking notes.  It has REALLY helped me.  It is long and often dry, since it is a lot of info.  But there is a lot of good visual demonstration.  It is well worth your patience.  Better to invest the time and money now to get your dog and your family off to the right start than pay later in more dramatic and expensive ways.",1251590400,21,661,4.441666666666666

To me it seemed more cold reinforment meaning in the video owners seemed to have less connection with their dogs and seemed more like a job for the puppies to listen to commands. The only thing I took from this video was treats are super important with training other then that other parts if the trainning were a bit ridiculous. As for telling someone to purchase it for the price they have it here I would say no it's not worth it, it's to expensive and really not that helpful at all I have a gsd myself as well and I can tell you I really didn't get much from this video at all honestly YouTube has good pointers for trainning and are a lot better then this video",1401667200,3,720,4.113475177304965

8252113,2,B0013LSRUK,"Fair at very best. You can't argue with the results he achieves, but some of his techniques are slightly unrealistic for me personally.

8252118,2,B0013LSRUK,"This DVD does have some useful information, but nothing to justify the 40$ price tag. The information, however, isn't anything you couldn't get from the website for free--or most other credible websites dealing with dogs or pets--and it isn't much help if you're really looking for practical training advice. Regarding the price, I feel a bit cheated here. There isn't a whole lot of practical training information, and just when it seems like you'll get something substantive, the DVD just directs you to their other products.  Feels a bit like bait and switch marketing.  I'll also mention that if you don't have the resources available to you that Leerburg does--i.e. large tracts of rural land and seemingly total commitment of your time--you might find this product a bit off-putting.  There is no mention of raising a dog in an urban landscape, in an apartment, etc. It might also be helpful to know that Leerburg, according to this DVD at least, trains German Shepherds, and he has worked with them in law enforcement. This definitely comes through in the attitudes and atmosphere of this DVD.  If you're looking for that type of discipline, you might be interested in their other products.  If not, I'd go with the Monks of New Skete instead.",1423353600,6,1250,4.9052132701421804
8252119,5,B0013LSRUK,By far best Puppy DVD. Highly recommend this DVD. I'm noticing a lot of low stars due to people thinking Ed is trying to up sell or because people don't like to do so much of the work and maybe because it involves food. Puppy training is a lot of work and should be all positive. It's all about micro managing your pup and setting them up to succeed. Puppies need to be puppies! with emphasis on creating great habits. This is exactly what the video teaches. Follow this dvd and don't push your dog too far and let your puppy be a puppy and you'll create nothing but great habits and then you'll naturally move onto some of his more advanced recall dvd's when your puppy is ready for them. The video clearly gives you all the information you'll need for a puppy that is up to 8 months old.,1417392000,,789,4.231788079470198
