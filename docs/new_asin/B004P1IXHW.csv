4442249,4,B004P1IXHW,Much better than what you would expect from the poor Rotten Tomatoes reviews. For an action film this movie delivers.  Highly stylized but without getting too 'Scott Pilgrim' and lots of action but without getting gratuitous like Hobo with a Shotgun.  The story is a pretty basic revenge/rediscovery story but the familiarity makes it easy to absorb the films stylistic elements.  The performances were decent and Kate Bosworth brought a lot of energy to her role.  If you like Clint Eastwoood westerns and enjoy Akira Kurosawa films like The Seven Samurai but with some steam punk and 'Crouching Tiger' elements you'll enjoy this movie.,1309651200,103,637,5.096153846153846
4442250,3,B004P1IXHW,"Its not that thick on the drama(HmmPH! It used to be called story development but guess I'm just old). The movie still has some fun action moments but its not an all out action freak adrenaline rush(sorry junkies go watch Bleach or something). It has a good mix of actors including the guy who played the captain of the black pearl in the first Pirates of the Caribbean(Captain Barbossa). Look, its ninjas in a circus gone mad wild-wild west let your self get into it and have fun.",1309478400,9,481,4.4772727272727275
4442251,2,B004P1IXHW,Turn down the volumne and wait for the action scenes and click to advance. Most of the movie is silly waste of time. I am sorely disappointed. I am surprized that someone bothered to make this film.,1309305600,,198,4.378378378378378

4442273,2,B004P1IXHW,"The movie tried too hard to be too many things- a western, a comedy, a love story, an action movie, and a martial arts movie( see what I mean?). Oh, and threw in a cute baby just in case nothing else worked- but even the baby could not save this one. I would say children may like it as it is pretty silly and harmless, but parents should be aware there are a couple of suggestive sexual scenes they may have to explain. I like Kate Bosworth and can not imagine why she took on this movie but hey, we all make mistakes. Do not waste your time or money.",1486512000,,552,4.027272727272727

4442330,4,B004P1IXHW,"This movie had a mix a influences that made it fun to watch. The plot has nothing new to offer but the filming was all about the ambiance and the choreography. I saw a bit a David Lynch (Twin Peaks feel with the ""freaks"" from the circus), but also some standard Chinese balletic action scenes. The lighting was quite interesting (overloaded colors or the opposite, depending) and the story was nicely paced. Good performance by the actors, but I would say the main interest was the way the movie was filmed.",1476662400,,507,4.582417582417582

4442346,5,B004P1IXHW,"Let's face it.  This is a guilty pleasure that calls back to the spaghetti westerns of old.  The hero drifts into town...saves it..( sort of) and then walks off into the sunset.  Poetic!  Romantic!  Funny!  And very, very bloody!  If you are a fan of Clint Eastwood....and Ninjas!

Very unique as far as I have seen but then again I might not be so hip into the Shogun/Westerns, is this really a genre? Some great western steampunk action going on, best was the machine guns, that's right steampunk machine guns with outlaws and ninja's lol. I liked it because it had a complete storyline as far fetched as it was and also the production was very clean. If you like Fantasy/Western/Ninja movies this is right up your alley as it combines them all with a solid dose of steampunk attire.",1474156800,,615,4.4035087719298245

All the CG, cliche, cheese, and storyline you come to expect, and at least it's done almost to perfection. Enough decent actors and actresses that keep it interesting. Think Disney, Kill Bill, and Kung Fu all at the same time. There are some slow spots and it gets a little corny sometimes but overall not that bad.

I like movies that are non conventional and filled with high contrast visual effects, something along the line of Frank Miller's creations, like Sin City or 300. On these movies you are not going to find any glamour, just crude and on your face altered reality. The Warriors Way is full of fantasy fight scenes and a straightforward story line.

I believe it is an homage to Akira Kurosawa and his beautiful movies, the so called spaghetti westerners and the old kung fu theatre on tv. Kate Bosworth is at her most beautiful and appealing, although her accent in somewhat less than impressive. The ninja/samurai/gun fighter violence is fun and very stylized without being excessively gory. The main character is the classic man of few to no words and scowling gaze.

4442778,4,B004P1IXHW,"It's not clear why this movie gets the hate it does. Rottentomatoes give it a 29%, it's much better than that. The cinematography alone is worth seeing this film, the movie is filled with very creative and quite beautiful scenes.  The camera work is excellent. The story is a little clich and predicable but name me an action film that isn't. Jang Dong Gun, as Yang the lead, has few lines, but he has a strong presence on the screen and the fight sequences are well done. The rest of the cast does capable work, and Danny Huston as The Colonel makes a worthy villain and Kate Bosworth looks great and look convincing in her sword training. Geoffrey Rush does a fine job as the narrator.

Don't be dissuaded by the haters, give it a chance. If you want an enjoyable ninja meets the old west meets Chinese fantasy, meets the circus, this film will not disappoint.",1471305600,,862,4.484076433121019

The combination of an eastern ninja/samurai movie (not sure which in this case) with a western was unique and well-executed.

4442839,4,B004P1IXHW,"Part Lone Wolf and Cub, part Jet Lis Hero, and part Three Men and A Baby (!) this movie involves one of the worlds greatest assassins/killers who stops short of killing a rivals child, a little girl, and saves her.  Thus begins his journey to save the girl and himself from his clan and he travels to the American west to hide out with an old friend.  While hes a superior fighter he is a master swordsman, but this is also a problem for him for if he draws his special blade his compatriots will be able to sense it and track him down.  Thus he is somewhat limited.  This doesnt stop him from kicking heinies and such and as he settles down and finds a kindred soul in Lynne, a young woman who has lost her family, he begins to make a family with the abducted child and Lynne.  The main characters are likable and help to keep the revenge narrative light, as do the exaggerated townsfolk our hero comes across.  Circus folk!  Our hero not only has to have various showdowns with his former clan seeking revenge but he also ends up protecting his newly adopted town from a renegade band of lawless law men.  Theres been a bit made out of the films visual style, and it certainly has one.  There are some slight visual aesthetics drawn from movies like The Quick and the Dead and Duel To the Death but much moreso from a movie like Hero which uses washes of vibrant, bursting colors against drab earth tones.  Though the budget is constrained by comparison the hyper-rendered sets, which feel bigger than they are because of the scarcity of what they contain and most obviously felt in the main abandoned western circus town which feels like it solidified out of an oil painting caught between two worlds, frequently catch us off guard as they call attention to themselves.  The locales are as much a part of the story as the revenge and self-redemption narrative is a part of the story.  What we are tempted, or maybe meant, to see in the dusty and broken down town of Lode on the edge of nowhere is slow death, unravelling, dunes of sand blasting away color and covering what was old.  But Lode hides its life in its death and is haven to the unfortunates and outcasts who populate its creaking and cracked buildings.  So too does our hero, seeking to stave off death but seemingly needing to die, find his life amidst the simplicities of Lode.  The last half hour of this film with its showdown between the townspeople and the malicious Colonels band of brigands is a bloody stylized love letter to movies like The Wild Bunch and The Magnificent Seven.  It all comes off excitingly and funny, and you really do feel warmth for the hero and the derelicts.",1435708800,,2656,4.467908902691511
4442840,1,B004P1IXHW,"My response to seeing the trailer for this movie was something along the lines of: ""Oh my gosh that looks awesome! I want to see it so badly!"", then I saw it and was horribly disappointed. This may just be the worst movie I have ever seen, not because I disliked it or didn't understand it but because of several gaping plot holes and over-all bad story. Probably the worst of them was the time jump from Warring states Era Japan to Wild West which was a really terrible idea seeing as the early to mid 1800s when the Wild West was closest to how it was portrayed in the movie takes place long after the Meiji Revolution, more than three hundred years after the Warring States Era. Its as if this story was written by a twelve year old boy who just wanted to see a movie with cowboys and ninja. Under no circumstances would I recommend this movie to anyone and I strongly advise you not to waste your money on this movie. If you want to see cowboys, go watch the original Lone Ranger.

It is, as stated in other reviews a western eastern samurai-style love story. A highly trained best of ghis kind assassin either has or gets a heart when he must kill a child to complete his mission for his family amd he cannot.  He gives love to the child and gets love and respect from those he tries to hide with after all his former family members and members of his profession set about to try to kill him becasue he chose to let an emotion - love take precidence over his family and training.  It also has shades of the Bourne Identity... series in that he is the best and is pursued by his former associates.  Good acting, a really nice story, great scenery, good music, some spectacular special effects.  A LOT if killing, midway between gore and bla.  Death by blood splatters.

The contest is silly. The Deaths are beyond count. But it is SO PRETTY!

The cool thing about this movie was more the fact that he just left and tried making his own way. Of course like all movies the new comer is immediately noticed and a special girl or group keeps interacting with them ""totally not real life"" but is how movies are portrayed. Funny element I notice with all movies is there's always some available hot girl, who for some reason hasn't already been claimed, and she's interested in you.. LOL, as all of you know any hot girl especially in the desert would be claimed by force if need be.

Two minor things that stood out to me which I think is beginning to get really old is the portrayal of white people as racists, and always being the antagonizer to a minority race. Give me a break and quit bringing that stuff back up as if it was an epidemic, white people have done far more for this world then any disaster they brought on it, hey even invented movies, wow!

Secondly, the star is an asian male, and for whatever reason he ends up not being sexual or asserting his interest in a female gender. It's pretty ongoing for most asian male stars for whatever strange reason. Let them get some too lol...",1428192000,,1263,4.370212765957447

I watched it out of sheer desperation for want of a good kick-ass session, even though all of movie review sites gave it fairly low marks.  What I wasn't prepared for was a great action film bundled together with a well performed story of love (father to adopted daughter, and man to woman) and redemption.

A little bit too silly to be taken seriously, and pretty campy, with an infallible and apparently invincible lead that makes it hard to worry about the conflict at hand.  It has its moments, it's just too bad there weren't more of them.  The concept is great, but this was a mediocre execution.  Danny Huston's role as the Colonel stands out as the only well-acted part in the movie, and every moment he was on screen was enjoyable.",1422057600,,454,4.5

From start to finish it delivers what we want....action packed fight scenes with amazing moves we could only see in a movie like this!  And Jang Dong Gun was on point in his portrayal of the warrior.  if you can't appreciate true great, classic martial arts movies and appreciate them for what they are, then pass on this (it will be your loss), but if you want to be entertained and get lost for a while in a good movie, then pop the corn and catch the couch because this one delivers the action!",1420243200,,665,4.296

The movie is more about an ""adopted father's"" love for his ""daughter"", never mind that the ""daughter"" was the sole survivor of a rival clan annihilated by the ""father"". This movie delves into a few deep corners.

The action is pretty decent. There are a few moments when the viewer can see the ""near misses"" that count as his, but for the most part unless you sit there and watch for them you'll not notice. There are a couple other continuity goofs but nothing so blatantly bad that warrants bringing them up.

Here is another example of the far eastern mind being so superior to most of the so called talent we have in Hollywood. Just simply a film clinic put on as you see how to take a regular film of sorts and make it into a piece of art.
The story is simply the classic battle between good and evil with some of the best special affects you can ask for. NOT FOR CHILDREN as it's too violent even though it's mythical in nature, but I'd never let kids watch things like this.
Excellent lesson in how to make a great film I think....just like Hollywood did at one time in the 1930's and 40's. They still do today but it's ever so rare.",1415750400,,754,4.026666666666666
4443198,4,B004P1IXHW,"An excellent, but underappreciated kung fu-western movie that bridges simultaneous activities in Asia and the western United States in the late 1800s. In Japan, a samurai warrior who broke his code by not killing the last of his victims flees to the USA, fearing he will be tracked by a determined band of Ninjas. Once in the USA, he has some very serious local problems to clear up, plus dealing with his  livelihood, the child in tow, and a budding friendship with Kate Bosworth's quirky character. Using an elaborate set and stunning camera and stunt work, director Lee Sngmoo (sic), ratchets up the tension with some great 'wire fu' action, showdowns, and fight sequences throughout the movie. The final action amid the carnival scenes is flat-out amazing movie-making. Starring martial art star Dong-Gun Jang who is an effective but stoic actor, Kate Bosworth, Danny Huston, Tony Cox, and Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush in another unusual role, this cast is mesmerizing.

4443228,5,B004P1IXHW,"It was Sunday afternoon, I was bored and felt like being both lazy and unproductive.  The 1TB of games I own seemed drab, nothing grabbing my interest (I should write a book on wise investments).  What was I to do? God forbid I spend Sunday afternoon shortening my list of things needing to get done.

So I hopped onto Netflix and started browsing their selection, again nothing jumped out at me.  Starting to feel at a loss for an afternoon's entertainment I desperately turned to Itunes.  Maybe if I were willing to purchase a movie instead of streaming it for (almost) free I'd find something entertaining.  Then I recalled the sad reality- I live in the middle of a forest, and my DSL connection would require all night just to download any movie I purchased.

My quest then seemed lost, there was no hope.  I was doomed to an afternoon of productivity.  Winterizing my home, cleaning and sealing the roof so it won't leak come the first snowfall, getting the shovels out, getting the snow blower out, splitting kindling to keep warm, making sure the chicken coop will handle the feet of snow that'll come to rest upon it's roof, covering the boat and making sure it's supplies won't be bested by the merciless cold that was inbound...

And then, as if by some miracle, I remember my Amazon Prime membership.  I rushed to this website and frantically made a last ditch effort to seek my afternoon's entertainment.  That is when I stumbled upon ""The Warrior's Way"".  That is when I found my afternoon's devourer.",1414281600,,1515,4.6716981132075475

The scoped sniper rifle from the movie 'The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean' with Paul Newman?
The gunfighter sniper came from 'Cat Ballou', where Lee Marvin played the drunken gunny.

If grading on a letter scale, I'd give it the symbol which caused the DOT to refuse to issue Prince a driver's license. Yes, it's THAT bad! The only places this movie would make sense are the states where marijuana is legal, and that's only if the users were also on LSD, engine fumes and had been licking poison dart frogs just before viewing it. A Prime example of why Amazon needs to allow negative star ratings. Should be paid by Amazon (and the producer, and the director, and anyone who approved the release of this pile of steaming anguish) for the suffering caused by awful mental images of ever having seen this piece of offal. Cream did not float to the top; here, something else did. And some nut thought it would be worth making in HD?

I think that the animated movie Rango, which I DO NOT recommend, probably took some of its ""atmosphere"" from The Warriors Way. This one is a mix of reality and unreality. There is a residue of people who have stayed in what is essentially a ghost town. The buildings are so dilapidated that you can see daylight between each board, except for the hotel which you see at the end. It is brand new plush on the inside. Why would you find anyone in a place like this. There is a circus troupe, some of whom were there when the town was alive, who plan to bring it back to life somehow.

For reality when the bad guys come to town and the good guys defend themselves by blowing up dynamite that they have strategically cached, men AND HORSES are shown lying dead or injured.

4443380,4,B004P1IXHW,"The Warriors Way is what I had hoped Ninja Assassins would have been. Don't let the cover deceive you, this movie is an action comedy than a serious action drama. The characters are extremely likeable, the action is outrageous, the humor hits the mark, and overall it's an extremely fun movie.

My biggest gripe with this movie is the over reliance on CGI. There was way too much green screen and use of 3d models and animations that had the video game fake quality to them. Though it was used in clever ways like having a disembodied head come flying towards the screen, it really looked awful in other parts. Scenes involving the bamboo forest and the ferris wheel were one of the worst and most fake looking scenes I had ever seen. It wasn't Ultraviolet bad, but it was getting there.

Also, the story is very bland. It's extremely predictable and isn't going to give you too many surprises.

HOWEVER!

What the movie does well is that it actually doesn't follow the usual tropes. The plot maybe clich but the characters go against the typical tropes.

Lynne is a wonderful, strong female protagonist who has her own motivations and sets out to accomplish them with or without anyone's help. She does briefly become a damsel in distress, but it's only for a scene. For the most part, Lynne sets out to do what she wants. If she wants to get a man, she will do it and nothing is going to stop her. Kate Bosworth makes her a lot of fun to watch and you can't help but find her endearing. Even the Colonel who plays her nemesis is just a hell of a lot of fun to watch. He's not too over-the-top which actors like to do, he just has the right amount of theatrics and demeanor to really make you enjoy watching his screen presence.

But our quiet protagonist is the star of the show. Yang is one heck of a character! At first you think he's going to be boring, stoic, mr. badass whose sole purpose is to look good slicing people. But Yang is more than that. He has emotions that he can convey without uttering a single word. You can see the guilt in his eyes, the empathy, the compassion, the warmth, just by body language alone. Another review said they could have watched this movie without him speaking, I agree. Yang was well acted and was not a two dimensional character. He may not speak or reveal his emotions to others, but you know what he's thinking by his actions and by the look in his eyes.

In fact, it is through these great characters that the movie is so fun to watch. It may be a shallow action flick, but it has its funny moments, over the top set pieces, and characters who you can watch with a smile. If I had to equate this to any other movies, I'd probably compare it to Big Trouble in Little China with more CGI and less 80's.

(As a side note: I understand why Geoffrey Rush was given top billing but... he's really not featured that much in this movie. His character is interesting too, but he doesn't start unfolding until the very end of the movie.)

If you feel like turning off your brain and having a fun movie to watch. This one won't disappoint.",1408492800,,3076,4.363636363636363

Kate Bosworth (who is stunning with auburn hair), Tony Cox, Danny Huston, Dong-gun Lee & Geoffrey Rush did the heavy lifting in a film that could have been so much better. It seems to me my problems with the film are with its writer & Director: Sngmoo Lee. My irritation with this film starts at the very beginning, with the voice over narration. The informal language doesn't fit the genre. This film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It struck me as a mash up of ""Sin City"", ""Kill Bill 2"" & ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" with a little Federico Fellini thrown in.

The Warriors Way is, as other reviews will point out, highly stylized.  It doesn't lean too hard on any one gimmick, and many of the visuals benefit a great deal from being more artistic than straight action.  The plot is somewhat thin, but that's not the draw; the performances and writing are both incredibly charming.  The leads play well together, and - in what I expected to be a rather cheesy movie - the film goes out of its way to waltz around stereotypes and predictable writing.

I can't say how many times I hyena-laughed, but it was always with the film and not at it.  This has instantly become one of my favorite movies.  Well-executed, beautiful, and just plain charming.",1405209600,,859,4.496774193548387

It reminded me of the spaghetti westerns I grew up with as a kid that my dad loved, but had a quirky story line that matched it's circus characters.  I liked the quiet serious acting of handsome Jang Dong Gun, I felt his look was comparable to old old westerns, maybe not as furrowed as Eastwood, but still very serious. I would have like to seen more complicated sword play and real martial arts action instead of just slash and kill. This is forgivable because the character is the best warrior in the world and he kills you before you can left your sword to protect yourself. I simply enjoyed this movie, it was fun.",1404345600,,667,4.379032258064516
4443584,1,B004P1IXHW,"A horrible plot that makes no sense. Pretty much none of the character's actions are believable. A circus in the middle of nowhere with no one to preform for? Why aren't they starving? An over the top bad guy that wastes time there? There's no money and it's the same people he harassed before! Bad-ass ninjas forgo their homeland, traveling across the Pacific, only to kill the crew BEFORE they arrive? Who docked the ship!?

4443587,4,B004P1IXHW,"I do love the occasional action flick. This one was very good. A man is trained from childhood to be an assassin. His teacher tells him that his only flaw is that he has a heart. Later, he has wiped out the entire enemy clan with one exception, a girl baby. He raises his sword to kill her, and she laughs at him, and he is lost. The heart takes over.

He cannot kill the baby and the rest of the film is devoted to the assassin trying to elude other assassins, including his mentor, trying to keep the baby safe, and learning the ways of the old west in America, where he runs to hide.

Lots of action, swordplay, and for info, there is an extreme amount of blood and gore. This movie may be a bit too graphic for kids under about 13. For the rest of us, I think the plot is useful, and would watch this again.",1404259200,,811,4.031055900621118

4443596,4,B004P1IXHW,"This was very good, although it's general concept of killing those who you love is a bit flawed.  He killed his master, who he loved for what he taught him, but why would he kill the women and the child who he loved but all be it in an indirect way of him sticking around and drawing more of his enemy toward them; so that is why he had to leave.  Yet the women he loved learned a great from him to protect herself and the baby, I suppose he projected his staying to be too risky given the extraordinary skills of his enemy.  It does make sense in that way, yet it does not in that if he truly had to destroy those he loved, he would have killed the woman and the child.  By leaving her he showed that not be the case, in which he would not have killed his master who he loved, or perhaps he did not for teaching him to kill those he loved, so he grew to despise him for that curse and chose to defy it by only killing those he hated which he had decided among those to be his master; so by killing him from changing what he was taught there would be no contradiction by the actions he chose.  Given that it does make sense but most viewers would not make all these considerations so that is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.  Besides, the direction, acting, and editing was very good, it was not excellent to deserve a 5 star rating.",1404086400,,1333,3.992481203007519

I don't want to let slip any of the plot line, and it is near impossible to be specific about what makes this film enjoyable without doing so.

Expect a lot of CG effects, outrageous costumes, over the top tongue-in-cheek performances but by accepting the premise of the plot and a detachment from reality, they combine to give the gritty old west feel to this morality tale expressed with guns and swords.  There are a lot of laughs and smiles for the viewer in there too.  It is uniquely satisfying, entertaining and definitely not a waste of time.  There is a lot of violence and gore, so you may want to wait until the kids are in bed before watching this.  The kids will no doubt be playing a game that has even more gore and violence than this movie (basic training for control of a battle droid in an army of droids that will comprise our future US army where there is no compassion or fear, but single minded lust for winning-SORRY that comment is for the review of an upcoming scifi movie so disregard that comment).",1403740800,,956,4.44

4443628,5,B004P1IXHW,"I don't even know where to start there were so many great things to talk about.  So I'll write first about the things that weren't so great.  From a martial arts perspective, I missed seeing the training aspect.  I like to see the struggle to go from nothing to master.  It is just something I never get tired of.  Much of the martial arts action was simply guys getting cut up by Dong-gun, not really ""fighting.""  There was some good martial arts though, and all the martial arts action was graceful, dramatic and entertaining.

If you are looking for some plausible scenario, or something that relates to real life, then this isn't it.  There are some pretty serious logic gaps in the story line too.  The primary setting is strange, and the people are even stranger.  This is a movie you have to be willing to give some artistic license to.  I did, and it paid off big for me.  After watching the movie, I was totally shocked that I had not heard of it before.  Anyway, on to the good...

Martial arts, action, violence, blood and gore all in large but prudent amounts.  I don't recall seeing Dong-gun Jang in anything before, but I really enjoyed him in this role.  I still don't know if he can act or not as the role was somber/quiet/brooding for most of the film (not much dimension).  However, he really looks the part of the martial arts action hero.  I am not surprised guys just fell apart in front of him ;-)  He has a great voice too.  For example, Tony Jaa is great, but he has a squeaky little voice that doesn't fit well with his roles.  Anyway, Dong-gun has (for me) all the goods needed to be a top film action star assuming he can add some dimension to a character if required.  I'll definitely be watching for him in the future.

Danny Huston was a great villain.  He was mean, nasty and evil, just awesome.  My favorite line of the movie ""I'll meet you in hell, wear something nasty"", lol.  Kate did what she needed to do.  It was a fine enough job but somehow she never really pulled me in, but at least she didn't take anything away either.  Tony Cox did an excellent job and added both fun and dimension to a cast that might have fallen short without him (not a pun).

To sum things up, this show was highly entertaining and action packed.  It was filled with good characters and that crazy place turned out to facilitate the action in the final showdown.  It was such a surprise and so much fun, I watched it again right after watching it the first time.  Sure it had a few flaws, but they were overshadowed by all the great things about the movie.

4443669,5,B004P1IXHW,The storyline wasn't complicated.  The movie did not try to do or explain too much and bombard the viewer.  The main character stayed true to his virtue and didn't flip and start acting conflicted about choices made and then do the classic Hollywood 180.  The casting was great too.  There is the depiction of blood and scenes elude to rape so I do not recommend this for very young audiences.,1402617600,,393,4.571428571428571

You never care about the people and there's killing and dying aplenty. Apparently ninjas don't do well against western technology like Gatling guns despite their ability to defy physics.

The movie had an interesting visual style combining animation stark sets with live action.

I found the hyper violent content unnecessary.  Again, the blunt story line was simply a thin framework for hanging poorly choreographed fight scenes. Since the martial arts sequences were cartoonish in character, and the story was not compelling, the action was more annoying than dramatic.",1402012800,,530,5.5875

4443690,3,B004P1IXHW,"It has its stunningly beautiful scenes to look at as eye candy, and some neat little action scenes. I felt like it didn't have an identity though; that it attempted to be one way and another and failed both. It's original, and it's entertaining. I gave it three stars for trying to break the mold and slightly succeeding, as well as being able to hold attention throughout the movie. Some scenes were wildly out there and needed to be reeled in, but that's part of the charm of the movie.

Should really not read reviews for this one and try it yourself, I don't think any review could accurately capture this movie.",1402012800,,616,4.5

Shocked that I wasted almost 2 hours of my life on this, shocked at the ridiculous level of blood-spattering death and dismemberment, shocked at the lack of character development, the silliness (just one of a dozen examples: he taught her to focus in one lesson? Blindfolded? At least Luke Skywalker took some time, and he was Jedi material.), shocked that so many people (adolescent teen boys?) rated this film so highly.

4443693,5,B004P1IXHW,"When I watched the trailer at first I thought should I watch it, but I did and was surprised it was good.  The trailers are short and they pick out pieces of the movie that they feel will get your attention in hopes you will watch it.  I felt the story line was very good, man (with baby) who doesn't know how to love then, meets women who shows him about love, his heart changes and in the end you can see his feelings toward the women. The martial arts in this movie were awesome it was choreographed very good, especially the sword scenes.

4443708,4,B004P1IXHW,"What bothered me most about the movie is that Dong Gun Jang was the headlining star (male lead) yet Amazon doesn't mention him at all, not even as a supporting actor!  That's a disgrace - he deserves top billing!  Yes, the story was pretty much boiler plate tragic assassin turned hero who can't keep the girl & who's past won't leave him alone.  There were some slow spots & the flower garden was just too fake to be believed, BUT the fight choreography was fun & some of the scene framing was just amazing!  Gorgeous visuals - backdrops, costuming, contrasts, colors, etc!  It was artistically beautiful & made a nice contrast to the blood & guts (My favorite was when the sword went flying inches from his head & then as it passes by you see the hand (only) attached to it as it falls followed by a few body parts & a hat!  Then there's a scene where they show the analogy between dancing & sword practice routines (forgot the word for that) that was put to music which emphasized that analogy.  It was upbeat (which was kinda weird) but fun.  The circus characters were a strangely nice addition to the 'typical' town folk & gave it a surreal feel.  Their costumes were great (especially what they wore during their fight scene) & the sad clown who got terrorized by the bad guy's gang was priceless.  The secondary plot of the female lead & her journey to become strong & get revenge was pretty cool too.  I loved a scene towards the end when he (Dong Gun Jang) stepped aside & let her fight the villain from her past.  It was pretty brutal.  He never assisted, just watched & she got the crap beat out of her but in the end she got the evil creep.  That was refreshingly different & rewarding from a female point of view.  If you're looking for a deep, dramatic film, this isn't it.  But, it is a stylized, weird, sometimes funny, kick ass, western/martial arts film that I, at least, enjoyed watching.  Hate those types of endings (lone hero walks off into the sunset - literally), but that's pretty much obligatory for the genres.  There were enough really cool things & weird combinations of them & breathtaking photography which over all overcame any shortcomings for me!",1401667200,,2181,4.506361323155216

In all honesty this movie reminded me of ""The Three Amigos"" with the same idea of a small western town that gets attacked by bad guys and the villagers defend it. This movie even shares it's humorous and lighthearted mood at times. Having said that, this is not a kids movie, evident in the body parts flying through the air and the blood stains on pretty much everything. Though this is not a problem for those who are as desensitized as I am. Enjoy!",1401148800,,831,4.396103896103896

It leaves me feeling sad for days.  Maybe I've become immune over time, but this time I just enjoyed the entire movie and didn't really feel terribly sad about anybody dying.

I loved watching the main character grow, from someone who kills for the sake of killing, to someone who kills to protect that which is most precious to him. The circus characters at first were annoying, but as things progressed, I started to really like their contributions, and was genuinely sad when things didn't go their way. A bit gratuitous with the violence, but much better than something like Kill Bill. All in all, I greatly enjoyed this movie.",1400716800,26,631,4.851851851851852

The movie mixes the marital arts/ninja movie theme with the wild west in a very entertaining and engaging manner.  All the fun of both themes mashed into one movie.  The movie has several Hollywood named actors and a story that is engaging and slightly humorous throughout the movie.

A lot of attention is given to the setting of the scenes, the role of the music, the colors, the dialog... the word that keeps coming to mind for me is ""stylized"".  In some ways, the backgrounds reminded me of an original Star Trek episode where they go down to a planet.... the scenes are stark, but yet just enough detail for what is needed without anything more.  Wonderful.  Colors... the way colors are used in this movie are really neat.

I used to be amazed, when watching a far fetched Spaghetti Western, when the characters would stop to reload their guns, after six shots they needed to reload but this never happened, they kept on shooting as if they had a hundred shots left, and the time when one could never understand how did the man killed three bad guys with one single shot, that's all you could hear, it was odd and as I said really far fetched but entertaining, totally comical, and I love it. Same thing with The Warrior's Way, however instead of guns we're using swords, beautiful ninja swords, as beautiful as the gun slingers' colt 45, and the speed the used it was impressive.

4443803,5,B004P1IXHW,"It quit a simple movie including the plot, but is great for anyone who loves martial arts. It's fast paced and in your face actions keeps watchers on the edge of their seats. I wish it would have ended different but I understand why it couldn't.",1355788800,6,245,4.3478260869565215
4443804,4,B004P1IXHW,"Enjoyed the movie, it's along the lines of a Sin City crossed with ninjas. Not quite sure why Jang Dong-gun is listed as a supporting actor? I realise he doesn't have the name recognition of say Kate Bosworth (coughcough)in the US but I think we can all agree that he is that main actor!",1351900800,,287,4.333333333333333

4443808,1,B004P1IXHW,"You know how you can only watch a porno with thte sound off to make it a good movie?  Same goes for this, if you watch it with the sound off it looks pretty cool.  If you watch it with the sound on, it's f***ing hilariously bad.",1339372800,,228,3.8297872340425534

4443812,5,B004P1IXHW,"Ninja! Samurai! Cowboys! Oh my... Let the explosions fly! Awesome Action!

Academy Award Winner Geoffrey Rush, Kate Bosworth, Danny Huston and International sensation Jang Dong Gun star in this boldly original film that blends intense martial arts action with a dazzling visual style. After a lifetime of training in swordsmanship and hand-to-hand combat, the world's most dangerous fighter (Jang) flees his homeland to start a new life in the American West. But soon the hunter becomes the hunted, and now the legendary warrior must wage a fierce, all-out battle against a renegade gang of outlaws and a pack of murderous assassins from his own past.",1327795200,,651,5.2
4443813,5,B004P1IXHW,"This movie is a cross between wire foo and western, so it already had an interesting fusion of styles IMO. The movie itself is really quite visually stunning. The darkness and death is represented with greys and black for the most part, while the things signifying beauty and life were lush and colorful. In fact, this is what made the movie special for me. The set pieces were almost shocking in their detail and attention to how it interacts with the story. There is some definite eastern philosophy going on here. The acting was....okay. Nothing too terribly awesome, but it worked well within the fold of the story. The fighting was really cool i thought. However, i find myself going back to the sets and the amazing images when i think upon this flick. It was a truly beautiful movie depicting blood and gore. Quite the dichotomy. I think this would have benefited from an indie release rather than trying for a big market audience straight away like it did. It's a film that needed to build momentum. Anyway, i won't discuss the actual story here, but i think you should give it a viewing with an open mind and then think about how the movie made you feel afterwards. Some people won't appreciate it, but i think if you go in expecting the fighting to simply be a nuance of a larger story about the soul and the journey through life, you will enjoy it as much as i did.

Enjoy!",1326067200,41,1384,4.492063492063492
4443814,4,B004P1IXHW,Throw away any preconceived notions on what an Asian or Western should be because this movie mixes it all up in a great way.  Have fun watching and make up your own mind instead of depending on what all the reviews say.  The ending is pretty badass too.,1320364800,11,253,4.25

4443816,1,B004P1IXHW,This is probably the worse movie in the history of film making............. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star but it is required.,1316131200,,128,4.375
4443817,4,B004P1IXHW,"If someone had to have told me that the film was a warrior/ninja/spaghetti western that contained clowns, an assassin, a circus, a sword master, a town drowning in sand, outlaws, and visually stunning shots involving flowers, blood, and severed body parts... I wouldn't have paid money to see the film. This film is worth the rent for people who don't mind mixed concept films. Its neither totally a western nor is it totally a martial arts/sword/ samurai. I think the film could have benefited from being shot out in a natural environment instead of on a set. The way it's shot is less like Hero and like a graphic novel film like 300. I thought the main problem with this one would be with the script. The main problem with the film is that it feels a bit overwrought and strangled at times by it's efforts to be novel or cool. For me that is how a lot of the smarter and more cooler aspects of the film are lost. What was up with the words floating in the air in the first scene(NOT A SPOILER: You will have to see the film to understand what I'm talking about)? It didn't work in Wanted and it didn't work in this film. It's intrusive, unimaginative and not novel. Watch this film after you've had some sleep and are interested in something that is not quite like the type of film that the image of the film posted on Amazon suggests. Yes it is a film about a warrior ... it's just not the kind of warrior film your used to.",1312588800,,1428,4.312267657992565

I was not watching wirelessly.  So do I need a higher DSL speed or does amazon need to fix its servers?  Someone please let me know. You may be disappointed. I bought over 100 instant videos for rent and purchase but maybe I should go to vudu.com instead may I can actually watch it there. Oh yeah, no refund, lol!",1312243200,,466,4.261363636363637
4443819,3,B004P1IXHW,I was all tucked out on the couch watching this on a rainy day with nothing to do. The movie was very enjoyable. It didn't require a lot of brain power and allowed me to just veg out. Perfect for those type of afternoons.,1310515200,6,221,4.045454545454546

8437389,4,B004P1IXHW,"Good story and while some of it was expected, there was enough that surprised me that I am pleasantly pleased.  The movie, while having a bulk of the scenes in the US Old West, has a definite Eastern vibe to it.  For American audiences, that means that the ending isn't cut and dried.  The hero doesn't necessarily get the girl, or at least it isn't clear. And I think that is why I'm not as perfectly pleased with the movie as I hoped.  My expectations had it being a Western masquerading as an enigmatic Asian romp, but it was deeper than that.  Anyways, I enjoyed the movie and I think you will too, as long as you go in with proper expectations.  if you want a Michael Bay flick, there is a lot of explosions and fighting but it isn't the focus of the film.  Be safe and have fun.",1516838400,,784,4.1866666666666665
