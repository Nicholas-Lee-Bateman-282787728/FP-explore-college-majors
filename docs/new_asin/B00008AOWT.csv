1832781,2,B00008AOWT,"I found the narraration terrible and boring.  It seemed like he was lip sinking and his words did not match his mouth movement.  I would have liked to see more performances and less of him.  Also most of the performances seemed to be Judy Garland.  I was amazed that there she was again and again, not that I don't like her but its not a Judy documentary.  I was also disapointed that they ended with ""Annie Get Your Gun"".  There was absolutely nothing about the great musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein like where was ""Oklahoma"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""My Fair Lady"", ""Music Man"", ""King and I""? These are some of the best musicals ever yet they were left off which I think is sad.  Hopefully htey will have a part two where these musicals are covered.",1081209600,14,753,4.452554744525547

1832783,3,B00008AOWT,"i agree with most of horiuchi's review except i found feinstein's narration to be irritating. he's too earnest and has a rather plastic smile, and i found myself fervently wishing that they had replaced his performances (of which there are too many, esp in the second section) with real footage. the pacing is a little rushed b/c of the large amount of territory covered, and a bit confusing in the way the film jumps back and forth between composers b/c everything is presented chronologically. clips are generally great, but ultimately disappointing because usually they just show the verse and the first chorus and then sometimes they skip to the finale, i.e. less than 1/2 of the actual song. in other words, all in all it's good as an introduction to this genre, but for many of these you'll want to see the movies the clips are from.",1069027200,23,839,4.714285714285714

A big plus is that the entire musical numbers are shown, but not just short clips.  If you love great American songs, this DVD is for you.  Highly recommended.",1053734400,37,375,4.920634920634921
1832785,5,B00008AOWT,"The Great American Songbook is one of the best recent Documentaries about the songwriters and the music of America. Short Bio's of Porter, Berlin, Gershwin and a slew of others. The best parts of this program are the clips of stars Like Bing Crosby and Ethel Merman singing ""Anything Goes"", Ray Bolger, Fred Astaire, Sophie Tucker singing ""Some Of These Days"" from (Broadway Melody Of 1938) My favorite clips were of Judy Garland performing with Mickey Rooney ""I Wish I Were In Love Again"" from (Words And Music) ""Easter Parade"" with Fred Astaire and Singing ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" to little Margaret O'Brien in (Meet Me In St. Louis) special feature includes Judy's 1942 appearance in the MGM short film ""We Must Have Music""
It was only disappointing that Deanna Durbin, Betty Grable and Marilyn Monroe were not featured as they sang songs from these great songwriters. also featured was Mel Torme, Dinah Shore, Ann Sothern, And the list is endless. Michael Fienstein hosts this 176 minute program. It is truly the best re-telling account of American popular song and the music EVERYONE loves.",1051833600,38,1112,4.983870967741935

1832792,3,B00008AOWT,"This is a fine visual and musical sweep though the development of American 19th - 20th century American music. Unfortunately the narration is so politically correct it makes you want to gag. Almost all white music incorporating black themes and visuals is labeled ""racist"" (time and again). Applying 21st century values to 19th and early 20th century norms is as problematic at best and betrays not only an arrogance but an ignorance of the historical context of those times. The producers would have done much better to have left the social commentary out of this and to have stuck to musical analysis. Therefore only the 3 stars.",1453593600,7,631,4.906542056074766

There are clips from a number of movies and shows a number of big -time stars with some of their signature songs.  You don't have Fannie Brice doing the whole interpretation of her signature song ""My Man"" but you do have most of the song.  There are a lot of songs by their original singer in their entirety and it is a joy to see performers such as Paul Robson, Kate Smith and Sophie Tucker to name just a few.  You have Irving Berlin performing one of his own compositions. The narrative is very illuminating and one can learn quite a lot.

1832799,4,B00008AOWT,"This is a unique DVD and we can be grateful to Michael Feinstein for his interest/promotion/preservation of this music but a really good narrative explaining the roots of American Popular music, punctuated with great talents such as Alice Faye, Al Jolson, Ethel Waters, Kate Smith etc singing the songs, deteriorates into an MGM/Judy Garland sing-a-long with far too much of Feinstein's contrived and soulless cabaret singing and his plastic smile (the mouth is in the shape of a smile, that is.)  I enjoyed Part 1 much more than Part 2.

After I watched the program and got fed up with Feinstein, I started on the extras and partly revised my response. There is an MGM short film from 1941 promoting their product with an emphasis on the musical output of that year and there are some excellent behind-the-scenes glimpses of the studio product. Then there is a commentary on the film itself and this turned out to be a really delightful surprise. I find Feinstein much easier to listen to as a speaker than as a singer. His delivery is clear and pleasant. He carefully explains how the project which produced this DVD evolved, the difficult selection of clips, information on the clips themselves etc. Correctly, he summarises that this would have been too much for the story itself so the commentary makes a really valuable supplement.

The production values of the whole package are first rate and the insertion of the clips perfect. This is a really worthwhile project and given Feinstein produced it with a colleague, it is fair enough he should take centre stage. I just don't happen to like him when he performs.",1421452800,,1619,4.837545126353791

1832807,4,B00008AOWT,"Michael Feinstein, ever the pompous one, hosts this look at American Music from its roots.  There is nothing in this retrospective that is not to like or understand with the exception of Feinstein's input.  He is annoying at best...his input and descriptions are those reserved for students of musical theory, writers and musicians rather than listeners, which we all are.  When you hear him describe which elements of music went into many of these selections you'll understand my one issue with this and you'll be just as confused as I was during his self-serving statements. While many of us realize he is the guardian of the Gershwin library of music he really needed to speak to the people who would be watching this presentation and not song writers or composers!  Just ignore him and buy the Songbook...it's terrific!",1401148800,,823,4.942028985507246

For those of you who enjoy Classic Arts Showcase, you could be disappointed as this documentary doesn't give full on-screen written credit when a clip is shown. Also, the title of this program is slightly misleading as the emphasis is on the music of the first half of the 20th century, particularly musicals that were made into films. Those are my only caveats; I highly recommend this DVD if you are interested! Excellent investment for a middle school or high school music program as well!",1310342400,,598,4.704761904761905

1832846,5,B00008AOWT,"I came of age in the rock music scene and also have had a long time interest in folk, blues and country. In contrast, the classic songs of stage and film have never been of much interest to me. But this excellent documentary really brought that music to life and allowed me to learn about an entirely different aspect of American culture.

Pianist Michael Feinstein serves as the narraror and provides fascinating commentary on great lyricists and composers such as Ira and George Gershwin, Lorez Hart and Oscar Hammerstein. The doc begins with America's first popular song, ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"", and continues through the 19th century, the Jazz Age, big band era and up until the emergence of rock and roll in the 1950's. Much of the music is drawn from Broadway and Hollywood musicals, with some great film clips and other footage from the historical archives. Other featured performers include Al Jolson, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rodgers, Judy Garland and Frank Sinatra. For me this was a tremendously educational and entertaining journey into a musical world that I knew little about. Highly recommended!",1237161600,,1105,5.038251366120218

1832848,5,B00008AOWT,"This film accomplished exactly what it was meant to -- it made me want to learn more about these intensely talented songwriters. Michael Feinstein is a very capable guide. You never get the feeling that these songs represent old-timey ""kitsch"" to him. He respects the music, and in turn, he infuses our viewing experience with that same respect. My only complaint is that we are never told what movies these songs appeared in. We learn in Feinstein's commentary that he and his co-producer felt that the viewers would be bombarded with too much information if they were to see both the film title, and the songwriter credit on the screen at the same time. Not so. In an age of MTV-style quick edits, and ever-changing graphics, I believe today's consumer is sophisticated enough to take in a few basic pieces of information on the clips that are presented. I immediately wanted to go out and rent some of the movies that appeared in the film, but without film credits, that will be a bigger challenge than it should be. For that, I could have removed one star, but I couldn't bear to. In every other way, this presentation is a delightful, informative cornucopia of movie-going pleasure. I will definitely be purchasing a copy to experience this masterpiece at a level that can only come from repeated viewings.",1213228800,4,1311,4.779735682819383

1832859,4,B00008AOWT,"America can claim very little things for itself. Because of immigration, many of the things we claim as our own is truly the product of other nations. However, we have jazz, and can claim the bouncy music as our own. This documentary showcases jazz and the music that came before and after, concentrating on the era between the influx of immigration and the advent of rock and roll. We learn about well known composers like George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, and Rogers and Hart, as well as lesser remembered names like Jule Styne and Harry Warren. We also hear from famous singers ranging from Al Jolson and Fanny Brice to Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy to Betty Hutton and Frank Sinatra.

The content is presented quickly but thoroughly.

The major flaw here is the choice of Michael Fienstein as host. His love of classic music possibly got him the job, but he proved to be less than desirable. His personality is cloying to say the least. It would have been nice to see film clips used to demonstrate all of the songs; hearing him sing was bad enough, but having him look into the camera while doing so is uncomfortable. He came off like a Vegas showman instead of a piece of Americana.",1190678400,3,1197,4.588785046728972
1832860,5,B00008AOWT,"I smiled all the way through it, and who couldn't use a little more of that these days? The nostalgia was warm, breath-taking, a slice of Americana as it once was. We will never see those days again. True, every chapter of history has its corruption and ne'er do wells, but this was the idealism and art and culture that could have made America great - if only.

But forget about if-only for the few hours that it takes to get lost in the rhapsody and pageantry and the history of American music. For me, it evoked memories of times I wasn't even there for, but my parents and grandparents knew the songs and I watch old movies. For younger generations, watching actors and singers we've only seen as old, sick or dead when they were young, beautiful and at the peak of their game is a must have experience! It will warm your heart and, just perhaps, evoke some of that die-hard American spirit!

I enjoyed it immensely, and the  choice of Michael Feinstein to do the narrating was excellent.  I would have liked to have more of the lyrics sung to some of the songs, but in the interest of time this wasn't possible even though the program is nearly three hours long.  On the other hand many of the songs I enjoyed hearing did have more of the lyrics than I expected.  The great songwriters are all here.  It's not necessary for me to mention all the names, but George M. Cohan, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Richard Rogers, Larry Hart, Oscar Hammerstein, and several others are all here.

1832864,3,B00008AOWT,"I don't know why is happens, but whenever these documentaries are made, you get TONS of Judy Garland and hardly any Doris Day.  Miss Day, almost single-handedly, saved the movie musical in the 1950s.  She also saved Warner Brothers from becoming non-existant.  When she became a star with her first film, ""Romance on the High Seas,"" she rose to become the #1 musical star in films.

Perhaps the people who produce these films are from the ""I must hate Doris Day"" era.  There was a time when the mere mention of Day's name drew ire from many uninformed people, some were even critics.  What they don't want to admit is that Doris Day is one of the most popular and talented singer/actresses in the history of motion pictures. That's a crime, in my opinion.  Forget the fact that she remains, to this day, the top female boxoffice star of all time.

Certainly, she deserves more screen time in these documentaries, since there is so much material from which to choose.  She made 17 films in 7 years while at Warner Brothers alone, most of them musicals.

Most of the people who get the star treatment in these documentaries were never as big as Day, and like Garland, didn't have the crossover appeal to the Top 40 charts, as Doris did.

Until Doris gets her due, I won't buy these documentaries.",1114732800,11,1294,4.582608695652174

In a period when most movies are made for 14-year old boys, this is a treat for those of us who love movies and music. Having a Cosmopolitan while watching is definitely advised.",1088294400,6,440,4.7272727272727275
1832867,5,B00008AOWT,Mi primer contacto con los musicales fue con las peliculas Thats Entertainment 1 y 2 de 1974 y 1976.  Desde entonces surge mi fascinacin por los musicales americanos.  Tengo ambas en VHS (no estan disponibles en DVD.)  En 1998 agregu a mi coleccin Thats entertainment 3.  Compr The great American SongBook y a lo largo de sus casi 3 horas vi muy pocas escenas repetidas de los resumenes aparecidos en la serie Thats entertainment.  O sea que se complementa muy bien.  La verdad quede muy satisfecho aunque es cierto que el seor Feinstein aparece demasiado y ese tiempo debio utilizarse para mostrarnos mas de los numeros musicales. Para una persona que va a entrar en contacto por primera vez con este tipo de presentaciones no creo que sea conveniente esta introduccin.  Se dejan por fuera muchas escenas memorables  y  muchos cantantes.  Pero son pocas las opciones para escoger y el esfuerzo me parece excelente aunque pudo haber estado mejor.,1087430400,6,946,4.8930817610062896

7981020,5,B00008AOWT,"This can easily be a school class aid. And the presenter musical historian Michael Feinstein brings every song to life by giving its history in context.

We get a lot of good video complimenting the singing in chronological order.

You may want to take a break halfway through to catch your breath and be able to concentrate on the second half.

This presentation had to make sacrifices to select the top of each type of music. There is lots of music missing but you cannot put everyone in the presentation as it is only 2 hrs. and 22 minutes.

Looks like I missed a few movies and need to re-watch others.

You may find it useful to apply the subtitles  they do not appear on the videos, just the narration sections; so the subtitles seem sporatic.",1508198400,,749,4.470588235294118
