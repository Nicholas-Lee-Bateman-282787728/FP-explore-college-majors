7900960,4,832081605X,"In 1939, Bette Davis provided one of her greatest performances as Queen Elizabeth the 1st in the Technicolor MGM drama ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"". She sacrificed for the role, to the extent of shaving her eyebrows plus two inches from her hairline to resemble the aged monarch. So when Twentieth Century Fox went forward with THE VIRGIN QUEEN sixteen years later, it made sense for Bette Davis to once again ascend the throne. Though it does pale dramatically when compared to the earlier film, Bette Davis' regal performance keeps it on a smooth path.

Queen Elizabeth (Bette Davis) falls in love with the younger Sir Walter Raleigh (Richard Todd), despite the scheming of a catty rival, Beth Throgmorton (Joan Collins). Though historically, THE VIRGIN QUEEN often plays fast and loose with the truth; Joan Collins (a Fox contract player of the period) creates some fireworks as the ""Other Woman""--and her scenes with Davis are fun. Richard Todd and Bette Davis also have an enjoyable rapport, despite Henry Koster's often pedestrian direction.

If you enjoyed ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"", you will most certainly appreciate THE VIRGIN QUEEN. How often does an actor get the chance to revisit a role and get to use their newfound maturity and insight to create a deeper characterisation the second time around?

Highly-recommended for Bette Davis fans.",1242172800,,1384,5.0881057268722465
