151394,5,0792841409,"This flawless masterpiece was far ahead of its time and is the work of genius.  The fact that it was banned in France for decades speaks for itself: Kubrick hit an exposed nerve with his stunning realism and searing  indictment of military discipline sacrificed to professional and political  ambition.
As the First World War passes out of living memory, it is on  the way to becoming a ""forgotten war.""  _Paths of Glory_ captures  the horror and futility of that war, which included the self-inflicted  savagery of brutal military discipline, particularly (though by no means  exclusively) in the French Army.  Set in 1916 on the Western Front, when  slaughter had become the order of the day, this film chronicles a doomed  infantry assault and the French practice of ""decimation"" of  disgraced units.
The infantry assault on an impregnable German position  known as ""the Ant Hill,"" pre-dates by decades Spielberg's  [justly] acclaimed Omaha Beach landing scene in _Saving Private Ryan_, and  is every bit as horrifying as the French ""poilus"" are ripped and  blown apart by artillery and machinegun fire.  And throughout this film,  one never even sees a German soldier.  The French never make it beyond  their own barbed wire.
The subsequent court martial of three soldiers  chosen at random to be tried for ""cowardice in the face of the  enemy"" is a mockery, the hopelessness of which parallels the failed  attack.  Kubrick's focus on the last night of the condemned and their march  to execution is sickeningly realistic.
Every scene in the film is  effective as Kubrick explores the meaning of heroism and cowardice, both  physical and moral, through the lives and deaths of soldiers.  While  brutal, the film is also filled with subtlety, social commentary and  several compelling subplots.
I have shown this film in the course I teach  on Military Justice.  Beyond the reaction of horror at the doomed infantry  assault and indignation over the injustice of the executions, I have  discerned some muttered gratitude for the Uniform Code of Military  Justice.
Filmed in black and white, this stark, lean film is superior  even to Kubrick's excellent _Full Metal Jacket_.  It should be required  viewing for every Officer Candidate, and it deserves considered viewing by  any who truly aspire to the title of ""citizen.""  What Kubrick  reflects, here, has been the implicit cost of nationalism in this century.",916272000,4,2415,5.089743589743589
151395,5,0792841409,"It's a bold claim, I know, but this has to be one of the best, if not THE best war film ever made.  A shattering account of military and class politics during WWI, this film will leave you speechless (and emotionally  drained) by the its conclusion.  Kubrick is utterly relentless is this  brutual examination of the court-martial of 3 innocent men.  And this is  based on a true story!  A truly terrifying film; once you see it, you'll  never need to watch another war film again.  For what it's worth, your  humble reviewer is a combat vet.",912556800,,542,4.494845360824742

151487,3,0792841409,"The film does a good job showing the insanity of war and a little of what it must've been like to be in a trench during WW I. Kirk Douglas, always watchable, plays a colonel in the French army who's ordered to lead a suicide mission. As the soldiers scramble across the barbed wire and rocky terrain, I was reminded of ants. Then, I remembered their objective was to take Anthill - we're all insects here. As if to drive the point home, a soldier squashes a cockroach.

The main problem is that Kirk Douglas alone wears a white hat while all the surrounding officers wear black hats. There seems to be no in-betweens. The two officers in charge are depicted as slimy and less-than-human. At one point, Douglas accuses Adolphe Menjou of being a sadistic, old man. The kangaroo court doesn't fare well either. We're meant to hate these people in power, who eat nice dinners and go off to their luxurious parties. Yes, there probably were officers like these, but were all of them? For this reason, the film, while making a strong statement about the absurdity and cruelty of war, falls short because of its simplistic characterizations.",1513728000,,1134,4.67

151489,5,0792841409,"...as on the military hierarchy, at least in the French Army during World War One. A high-ranking French general is seeking further promotion, and he sees an opportunity to do so by having his regiment take a German position known as ""The Anthill"". Trouble is, he normally spends his time way behind the lines, and when he makes a front-line inspection of his troops, it is clear he lack a real understanding of what life is like for them.

He orders the attack anyway, despite the warnings from the officers below him, and the enemy repulses the initial attackers so quickly, the remaining infantry mutiny and refuse to press the attack. The frustrated general finds three scapegoat soldiers to court-martial, and though they are represented by an officer who is a real lawyer, he is helpless to save them.

We see the emotional damage the incompetent general has put others through-not for the glory of France, but for his own purposes. He might eventually be brought down, but his evil lives after him.",1510444800,,1005,4.803468208092486

151492,5,0792841409,"This is a fact-based war drama about the insane actions of a general.  A slight weakness is that it is not clear why his position suddenly changes from saying the planned attack ""is impossible"" and the troops are the best, to approving the attack, trying to use artillery against his own soldiers, and actually executing 3 of his own soldiers for cowardice.

151679,5,0792841409,"I just treated myself to watching, quite possibly, the greatest, most worthwhile double feature of movies ever:  PATHS OF GLORY and Dr. Strangelove both directed by Stanley Kubrick.
PATHS OF GLORY is agreed by many to be the greatest anti-war movie ever filmed.  It looks like a documentary (especially the battlefield and stunning 'bunker' footage) while also acted with top-tier professionalism.  PATHS OF GLORY is one of those rare, ahead of its time movies that is/was made so well and is so realized that (you) forget it was released in 1957.  It just feels modern and improves upon seeing again.

This film is so anti-war and so damaging to the hierarchy of the French military that they banned PATHS OF GLORY from their own viewing public for over a decade.
The extras contain many interviews from the 2 minute audio by recluse Kubrick; to the British talk show half-an-hour interview with Kirk Douglass himself via 1979.  He is a very proud nice guy.  Kirk really is; adding some effective comments about being an artist such as ""If you want to tell the truth ... write a novel ... if you want to lie ... write an autobiography ...""  Laughs seem genuine from studio audience.
There is also a well done essay booklet in this fine Criterion Collection of PATHS OF GLORY.
Within this detailed booklet I learned the German girl who is forced to sing to the rowdy French soldiers (WW1) became Stanley Kubrick's wife (Christiane Kubrick also gives ""extras"" interview).  The song she sang in the pub that turned the rowdy soldiers into the solemn reminder that war is not where they want to be is ""The Faithful Hussar"", a Napoleonic-era song which states ""Oh please mother bring a light/ My sweetheart is going to die.""  Amen French soldiers drink up and leave the poor German girl alone.
This is truly classic Kubrick cinema and World War history - as well as movie history - at its best.
If a fan of Kubrick you NEED to see this one too.",1473638400,7,1940,4.6627565982404695

Kirk Douglas gives a great performance, and the music captures the mood brilliantly. I do have my quibbles, though.

151934,4,0792841409,"This being a classic and renowned film starring the great Kirk Douglas, I was surprised to find that I experienced it as a less great film than I expected, mainly because of what I thought were technical flaws.  I did find the story and the film itself deeply affecting from an emotional point of view, and I think it is well worth seeing.

There is irony in the title, since the movie does not really glorify war but shows the horror of it.  Perhaps it points, however, to ""paths of glory"" in the honorable characters of the few military leaders, especially Colonel Dak, who stood for moral choices against those opposite types who cared nothing for the lives of their own soldiers.

While I thought that the photography was dramatically fine as PHOTOGRAPHY, the choppy movement from one tableau to another caused me to feel that the cinematography, if that is the right term for the PROGRESSION of scenes, was primitive.  The film seemed not to flow smoothly, but maybe Kubrick deliberately intended to convey a staccato effect suited to the subject of war and combat.  Because of the overall sketchy, amateur, and crude feeling (for me) of the film, if I hadnt known it came out circa 1960, Id have guessed that it was made in the late 1930s or early 1940s.  One reviewer made the point that Kubrick intentionally focused in this film upon just the depiction of event rather than character development and plot, which, if so, may have caused what I saw as shallow characterization and inadequate plot development, which I thought of as weaknesses.

The movie was based on a true story which viewers were perhaps expected to know all about (and I didn't know).  The film failed to provide enough information for me about these disgraceful events of WWI to fully understand the motivations of those who played major roles in the actual historical events.  If was difficult for me to comprehend through the film alone why the two generals and their court prosecutors behaved like despicable megalomaniacal monsters, actually taking delight in the deaths of their own French service men whom they veritably murdered as scape-goats.  I also had a hard time understanding during the film what was going on among the fighting men as individuals and as a group. (But this was probably partly due to poor audio that obscured some of the dialogue.)

The good musical score, although chiefly loud and disturbing in nature, was appropriate to the events depicted in the movie.  The quiet, innocent song sung in German by the utterly harmless German girl toward the end of the story provided an unexpected transformational glimpse of the serving men as they went from rude beasts to sentimental family men.  I wondered if the words of her song somehow alluded with meaningful significance to the events of the story.

The acting of Kirk Douglas was as great and outstanding as any viewer could hope to experience.  From earliest views of him, his character came across clearly as strong, courageous, and heroic.  Other leading actors also played their characters well.  In the sense that the generals and their power milieu versus Colonel Dak came across as extreme examples of men who were very clearly evil versus one who was very clearly a soldier of integrity, these three clear characterizations (although not very subtle or deep) were melodramatic, as was the over-all telling of a story that was portrayed through emotion-shaking EXTREMES of good-and-evil behavior and event.

I didn't realize until I thought about the movie in retrospect that the climactic scene toward which the story progressed invited a comparison with Calvary.  Knowing that now, I think it would probably be interesting to view the movie again (with better audio) and pick out the earlier details of action and conversation which may have pointed that way.

What I saw was an old VHS version of the movie and Ive read some other reviewers here on Amazon who indicate that the recent Criterion Collection edition of the movie has much improved audio and video quality.  Anybody who likes to collect great movies probably would want to consider spending more for that edition; however, some reviewers say that the DVD version is excellent enough and that theres no need to invest in the Criterion Collection with its interviews and extraneous written material.  Both these new presentations of the movie may make it look more modern and sophisticated technically than the VHS version of it did.",1446940800,,4463,4.913448735019974

I gained little from the text accompanying this one. I need to look deeper into it at re screen for comments.  Douglas was probably unkind to Kubrick in his memoirs and that bit is clear. MacReady and the supporting cast are terrific.  I read that the cowardly officer played by Ralph Meeker was a real war hero.  His career never got much beyond this film but he does a great job as does Adolph Menjou and some of Kubrick's stock company types. He brought out their best.

151986,5,0792841409,"It's interesting to think of ""Paths of Glory"" in the context of another great Kubrick move, ""Dr. Strangelove.""  Both are ""anti-war"" movies, but the latter is much more to the point in making a case about modern war, while ""Paths of Glory"" harks back to earlier, often satirical, treatments of war by writers like Siegfried Sassoon and Erich Maria Remarque.  The focus of the critique here is on the difference between the men in the trenches and the general staff giving orders that are absurd, given the reality of the military situation on the ground.  Add to that, the fact that the non-combatant senior staff are all too ready to employ patriotic rhetoric to urge fighting men to do what they will never have to do themselves, and the idea of the moral emptiness of those giving the orders becomes clear -- and all the more when we learn, as we do early in this movie, that ambitions for promotion at ranks far beyond those of the fighting men are what drive the upper echelons of officers to demand suicidal efforts from the troops that they command from such a comfortable distance.

Kubrick has a great eye for that distance in ""Paths of Glory.""  The chateau in which the upper echelons are housed seems untouched by war and to have maintained its pre-war elegance.  There's even a dress ball late in the movie, which goes off in the context of an impending execution of three men accused of cowardice, and it's clear that the consciences of all of the general staff are quite untroubled by the executions, which have been ordered not because these particular men are guilty of anything but merely as an example -- ""pour encourager les autres,"" as it were.  The representatives of the general staff here are Major-General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) and Brigadier-General Mireau (George Macready), and their conversations make clear the blend of vanity, venality, and short-sightedness that makes them cheerfully send men to their deaths, whether by firing squad or by by giving orders that will prove fatal to the men carrying them out.  Between such figures and the men in the trenches is Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), very much in the fight when the absurd orders are put into practice, but also trying to mediate between the enlisted men and the generals, with an eye to doing the best for his men.

Standing in clear symbolic opposition to the chateau in the movie are the trenches themselves and the no-man's land into which the men in the trenches are expected to venture.  The visual attention paid to both environments makes clear the moral dynamic of the movie, and the camera dwells just long enough on individual scenes to make them hauntingly real.  It's a simple opposition, but it's in keeping with simple, humane, moral structure of the movie.  As Corporal Paris, one of the men condemned to be executed, Ralph Meeker represents the basic dignity of the ordinary soldier without coming across as impossibly courageous or saintly.  It's a moving performance.  The scenes of the court-martial and the lead-up to the firing squad are staged very simply but to great visual effect, which I'll leave readers to experience for themselves without further comment.

The basic moral simplicity of the movie's structure generally avoids sentimentality -- and Kirk Douglas's stoical, quite understated performance goes a long way to establishing that.  Only at the very end, where a German girl, ""washed up by the tides of war,"" is called on to entertain a roomful of war-weary men who know that the next day might be their last, does the tone perhaps slip . . . but judge for yourself.  It's a striking scene, but by that point in the movie, I thought a harder edge was called for.  All in all, though, it's a very effective movie -- very well shot in black-and-white, and paced to perfection.  It comes in at around 90 minutes, and you don't feel that it needed to be any longer.

""Dr. Strangelove"" is a critique of a totally different military situation, one that viewers of both movies would understand as the kind of movie that a modern war required.  But both feature and send up patriotic rhetoric, the ideology that undergirds it (much more explicit in ""Strangelove""), and the distance from ordinary people's lives of the decision-makers.  The chateau has become an underground bunker -- but the point is similar.",1436486400,2,4329,4.821621621621621

152084,5,0792841409,"The film ""Paths Of Glory"" directed by Stanley Kubrick is a powerful movie with a strong anti-war message behind it that becomes all the more powerful when you realize that the story, based on a novel by Humphrey Cobb, is based on an actual incident that occurred during the first world war. French troops by 1915 were bogged down in trenches against German troops located on the other side of no man's land. Neither side could gain ground and hold it for long before the counterattack from the other side would take back what had been lost. As both sides mired down for the duration life in the trenches became a filthy, bloody, rat infested misery for the soldiers with moments of terror as they would periodically be ordered to go over the top and advance on the enemy that would lead to no fruitful results. Meanwhile for the officers far behind the lines and the fighting the opulent lifestyles they had let them enjoy the comforts of life. While for the soldiers the war was a matter of life and death for the generals the war was an opportunity to move up in rank which would allow more prestige and power for themselves. ""Paths Of Glory"" is an excellent example of that.

The French Generals in the movie, played by George Macready and Adolphe Menjou, are prime examples of this. General Broulard, played by Menjou, wants an attack on a German fortification called the ""Ant Hill"" to keep French moral high. It is just about hopeless the attack would succeed but that is not important, the attack must happen. Broulard goes to see General Mireau, Macready, to tell him he has been chosen to arrange the attack. General Mireau is not keen at first in wanting to lead this attack but General Broulard plays on his ego telling him there is a promotion for him if the attack takes place regardless of the outcome.

Once he agrees to the attack General Mireau goes to see Colonel Dax, played excellently by Kirk Douglas, to tell him he and his 701st division will take the charge against the ""Ant Hill"". Colonel Dax knows the outcome will not be successful but he can't refuse the order. Long story short the attack the next day is a failure. German machinegun fire doesn't allow the French troops to advance any further then their own barbwire before they retreat. Some of the troops don't even make it out of their trenches which incenses General Mireau. The General orders their artillery to open fire on their own troops. When the officer 3 times refuses to obey the order without a written paperwork from the General stating he is giving the order to fire on their own troops  the General has the officer relieved of duty. The entire charge on the ""Ant Hill"" is a total disaster and General Mireau is furious. He wants 100 of his soldiers put up for court marshal but finally agrees to have one soldier from each of the three units face court marshal. The three who are chosen will face the firing squad if they are found guilty.

The actions of the Generals in this film is unbelievable as they set about finding scapegoats to take the blame for their foolish orders. Everyone knows the advance on the German stronghold is impossible to carry out yet the General expect the soldiers to do just that. The conceit and egos of the Generals will not let them accept the truth that it is foolhardy to attempt such action. Both Macready and Menjou play the part of the two Generals very well. Kirk Douglas meanwhile provides the voice of reason as Colonel Dax who knows the trial is stacked against the three unfortunate soldiers takes on the position as their defense lawyer since that was his occupation before the war started. He knows the odds are stacked against him but somebody has got to stand up for the three soldiers fighting for their lives. Douglas made this movie early on in his career. With all the excellent acting jobs he has done over the years this performance might still be his best work.

In addition to the acting and directing the writing is outstanding as well as the cinematography. Shot in black and white it helps to give a stark reality to the events taking place on the screen. If this movie had been shot in color it would have ruined the feel for the movie. The remastering of both the picture and the soundtrack really helps to make the story come alive especially during the scenes in the battlefield.

Over the past century there has been a few good films made with a strong anti-war theme to it. ""All Quiet On The Western Front"", ""Red Badge OF Courage"", ""Johnny Got His Gun"", ""Catch 22"" and ""J'Accuse"" are some of the better ones. But ""Paths Of Glory just might be the best of them all. This is one movie everyone should see at least once. It has a powerful message to it and important one. It is certainly one film that any film buff would want to add to their video collection.",1427673600,,4817,4.537399309551208

An interesting way to grade a film is to read bios of each actor - the bios for the actors who played in this film often make the point that Paths of Glory was one of the most important films in the actor's career - Kirk Douglas's head explodes.

The film is in black and white - In my youth I had a short-hand way of evaluating films: black and white meant serious, deep, real; color meant shallow, exploitative, sentimental, spectacle.  This film is real.  I have watched it many times in my life, and I hope to many times more.

The ending made me squirmy and deeply uncomfortable in 1958.  Since then, I sing and weep along with the French soldiers.

My favorite scene in the movie:  Sgt. Boulanger (Bert Freed) enters the condemned men's cell and greets Cpl. Paris (Ralph Meeker).  I think it is one of the best-played, best-written scenes ever filmed.  In the context of the drama - three lines I  often hear in my mind:  ""I don't want to die.""  ""Act like a man.""  ""I don't want to die.""  ""This is the last decision you'll have a chance to make on earth.""

I previously reviewed ""The Killing"", which is also directed by Mr. Kubrick, and you can find my review on that in ""The Killing"". From Kirk Douglas' performance as the sincere Colonel Dax, to its emotionally crippling final scene, it embedded itself as a classic that will remain relevant in the generations to come. As I had previously mentioned in my review of ""The Killing"", I will not go into broader detail about this movie for two reasons: it's brilliant on its own accord, and it defeats the purpose of watching it. But I will review my experience with The Criterion Collection, the company who distributed this beautiful restoration.

This is my second Blu-Ray I own that came from The CC (the first was ""The Killing"") and since I live in the upstate region of NY, at the time of its delivery it became the victim of delays from the ""snowstorm"". But I'll keep going on about The CC. Since I have a small HD television, the picture aspect was perfect for me. The restoration is, as always with the CC, beautiful. I'll give The CC an A+ for the movie. As for the goodies that came along with the movie, there are some pretty interesting interviews from the cast and crew, from Hollywood powerhouse Kirk Douglas, to an excerpted audio interview with the legendary Mr. Kubrick himself (you'll be surprised by what he actually sounds like, even though he had lived in England for the rest of his life), to an essay by a film scholar, this collection is truly a keeper.

152312,5,0792841409,"Stanley Kubrick, making deft use of a deeply ironic script written by Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson based on the book by Humphrey Cobb, the cinematographic artistry of Georg Krause, and the acting talents of Kirk Douglas, Ralph Meeker, George MacCready and Adolphe Menjou, crafted a masterful examination and denunciation of decisions made by military officers regarding the value of the lives of those who serve.  In several relatively brief and beautifully considered scenes, Kubrick depicts the moral degeneration of the officers - and indirectly, the politicians they serve - who drove men to slaughter in World War I.

The setting is the stalemated trench warfare of the western front in 1916.  We initially observe the futility of the situation on that front, with barbed wire, the artillery-pounded no-man's land between the enemies lines, the ever-present artillery and the certainty of the machine guns on the other side.  The fear is conveyed by men who are shell-shocked and driven to the bottle.  Men are fraying, such as Lieutenant Roget whose command of a night patrol ends in a cowardly cover-up of a murder, and by those who have become shell-shocked - and are punished by the arrogant and self-serving General Mireau.

One more futile charge to conquer an impregnable and likely irrelevant German-held bastion is ordered by the General staff and is held out as a bauble for General Mireau's promotion.  He orders the all-out attack over the objections of the loyal and courageous but insightful and compassionate Colonel Dax (Douglas).  The attack fails, with massive casualties and some soldiers are so pinned-down that they do not emerge from the trenches.  General Mireau orders an artillery fusillade on his own men, and though it does not transpire, this order, unknown to Dax, is later useful in argument for other men's lives.

General Mireau decides to hold one man from each company in the regiment responsible for what he sees as cowardice by the entire regiment.  They are chosen by lot and by prejudice, and the last half of the movie concerns the fate of these three men:  their trial (with Dax defending them), their considerations of life and death in the magnificent jailroom scene, their execution and the aftermath when Dax confronts Mireau's superior (played with steely French dispassion by Menjou) with proof of Mireau's decision to hammer his own men with artillery.  This second half is a deeply contemplated presentation of the reality of death and the value of life from various perspectives during a horrendous war, when thousands died every month.  Who is to decide when and why men should die, and how many ways do men conceive to justify the stealing of lives, one or many?

The very last section is eloquent and graceful, portraying both the lascivious and the tender nature of the common soldier who has endured the unspeakable, and is a marvelous capstone to a cinematic gem.

152338,5,0792841409,"Oh the insanity of war!  Paths of Glory exclaims and underlines that the settlement of differences by means of violent actions has nothing to do with glory.  In this well done movie depicting the sad separation of the privileged and ruling class as opposed to the common slug barely making through the travails of life we see a sad symphony played out in all too real detail.

 The plot of the movie revolves around the depiction of the French Army fighting in the fields of Flanders stalemated in the trenches of the third year of the Great War.  The main characters in this movie revolve around Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) and General Mireau (George Macready.)

 At this time in the war each side was trying to gain any advantage possible to advance forward and break the interminable stalemate.  With this in mind General Broulard approaches General Mireau and orders him to attack the well-fortified German position labeled the Anthill.  Mireau selects his best regimental commander Colonel Dax to attack and overtake the Anthill.

 As Colonel Dax receives his orders he sends out a patrol to assess the situation and the next morning goes over the top in leading his men across no mans land in the assault of the 701st Regiment on the Anthill.  Subsequent withering indirect and direct fire completely disseminates the regiment and the retreat begins.  The impossible cannot be done and the attack fails to capture the cherished objective.

 During the attack General Mireau witnesses the retreat and is angered by the defeat and immediately orders artillery to fire upon the retreating 701st Regiment.  Mireau declares the retreating soldiers are cowards of which he has no use for.  According to the General these men failed in their mission only because of cowardice.  As a rear echelon General officer he has deemed that it was through cowardice that caused the failure to achieve defeating the Germans on the Anthill.

 Hence Mireau decides that this failure was not his fault in ordering this absurd operation and demands retribution in court-martialing random soldier to stand trial for cowardice.  Upon this decision he orders Colonel Dax to select three men to face the court martial and subsequent death by a firing squad.  Retribution will be taken on a select few as opposed to all who survived this unfortunate debacle.

 Suffice to say, Colonel Dax who in civilian life is a very successful lawyer takes up the defense in the already fixed court martial.  Known to all the men are condemned to death in this rather disgusting display of hubris of the power elite.  The basis of the thesis for all this is that all wars are controlled from those in power and the rules of these conflicts emanate from the top and those who are among the servitude must abide by the rules.  The modus operandi applies to all participants of the game we call war.  Such is the message of Paths of Glory.

 At the end of the movie came a very moving scene in which in a French Caf attended by Daxs men of the 701st Regiment finds a very young German fraulein brought forth to sing a song.  Among the jeers of the men she still sings a very moving German song which quells the jeering and brings the soldiers to hum along to a very moving and passionate song which ends the movie. The significance of this touching scene is that in the end Germans and the French are indeed the same and that in this life war signifies the wants of the elite rulers and not that of the common person.

During WWI, French troops are ordered to take ""the anthill,"" a superior vantage point than the trenches which is heavily fortified by the Germans. Running into the guns, man after man is slaughtered and the troops naturally begin to retreat, with some never leaving the trenches. Three men are chosen as examples of cowardice and are court-martialed. Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) is an attorney who requests to represent the defense. He sees that the men are innocent and that the army is using their lives to take more on the battlefield. However, there is no justice for these men.

This film has a definitely modern feel and Kubrick's in-your-face photography makes the uncompromising situation of war all the more personal and uncomfortable.

Literally everything about this film is perfect. Like many of Kubrick's early films, it is all very economical and tight. It's short, clocking in at just under 90 minutes. The narrative is lean and focused, telling a small story of a few men. The plot is predictable, and the films is over before you know it.

And yet, it is one of the most touching, moving, and haunting films ever made.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kirk-Douglas/dp/B00170F0MK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kirk Douglas</a>&nbsp;gives his finest performance ever as Colonel Dax, the commanding officer of a platoon of men sent on a suicide mission. When the idiotic French leaders fail miserably in planning, and the attack goes terribly awry, they cover their tracks by sentencing three innocent men to death for cowardice in the face of the enemy.

Set the stage for the greatest anti-war films in cinema. The entire cast gives phenomenal performances. Kirk Douglas is fiery and electrifying as the one soldier with a conscience in all of France. George Macready oozes polished evil as the heartless, ice-water-for-blood General Mireau. The soldiers on trial are played brilliantly and with heartbreaking aplomb by Joe Turkel, Ralph Meeker, and Timothy Carey; achingly human and tragically sympathetic.

The cinematography is up to Kubrick's usual peerless standards. This is some of the finest black-and-white ever made, and the shots are beautifully framed and executed. Did we really expect any less? The famous one-shot action scene is the most accurate depiction of trench warfare ever filmed: muddy, bloody, messy, dirty, gritty hell on earth. The boredom and intersperesed terror of the trenches mixes with the polished life of ease of the commanding officers to make a powerful statement.

This is a portrait of the human side of war; the true side of the soldiers who fought it. A tense, riveting, brilliantly acted, lean anti-war film with sharp dialogue, heartbreaking human drama, and a haunting finale. Paths of Glory might not be as well known as 2001: A Space Odyssey, or The Shining, but this is one of Kubrick's finest masterpieces: a caustic look at glory, greed, power, loyalty, and humanity in the worst places on earth.

  For one thing, it's a restoration in widescreen.  One major production company's DVD edition--at least, the one I know of--is full-screen, and the cover implies that the 1:33:1 aspect ratio is the original theatrical format.  Once I found out that this was not true, and I discovered the Criterion disc, I bought it immediately.  The restoration is visually clean.  And the sound!  The sound is amazingly clear, especially for a 1957 film.
  The movie is a powerful advocation of the rights of the individual in a military context.  All of the performances in this important film are perfect.  For me, the stand-outs are George Macready as General Mireau, always out-of-breath and anxious about promotion; Ralph Meeker as Corporal Paris, ready to face the reality of the court-martial's verdict but at the same time hoping for a chance for acquittal; and Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, a self-made idiot without a clue as to the gravity of situations until he's face-to-face with them.
  This motion picture makes such a good case for the rights of the soldier that I wouldn't be surprised if it were shown as a training film today for junior officers of my country's army, even though the movie involves the French Army during World War I.

The French Army really did mutiny at the regimental level, in 1916, and soldiers were shot, as shown in this film.

We Americans find that hard to believe, given our times and our idea of military service, but times were different then, and the enemy was in their country.

But the Germans were so close to exhaustion themselves, that they didn't even notice that whole French units had walked off the front line.

In response, the British took over many more miles of the Western Front.

152403,5,0792841409,"It is an unfortunate fact of humanity that few things seem to stimulate it more than watching hundreds of thousands die in war, no matter the enemy and no matter the necessity.  But it is equally true that war has been commented upon time immemorial on the big screen, sometimes with utter jingoism being involved (as with most John Wayne war films), but usually with a ""Man's inhumanity to Man"" comment involved.  The latter is clearly true of director Stanley Kubrick's 1957 film PATHS OF GLORY, set against the horrible backdrop of World War I and involving a criminal court-martial that, just on the basis of the charges being leveled, can be considered even more horrible than the war itself.

Based on Humphrey Cobb's novel of the same name, PATHS OF GLORY involves a French army regiment's charge against a heavily fortified German ant hill on the Western Front, instigated by an ambitious general (George Macready) who has been promised a promotion by his superior (Adolphe Menjou) should it succeed.  Needless to say, despite the efforts of most of the men, the withering mortar fire of the Germans causes the attack to be a crippling disaster; and Macready, looking for someone to blame for an attack that was clearly pointless, orders that three men (Timothy Carey; Ralph Meeker; Joe Turkel) who could not advance far out of the trenches be put on trial for cowardice, a charge that carries with it execution by firing squad.  Kirk Douglas, in one of his best roles ever, is the men's commander in the trenches, and, given his background as a lawyer in civilian life, is given the unenviable task of defending his men against charges that, just on face value alone, are extremely ludicrous, but he is prevented by the General Staff and the prosecutors (including Richard Anderson) from presenting exculpatory evidence.  As a result, not even three days after the Ant Hill attack, the three men are executed.  Douglas, however, uncovers evidence of Macready's complicity in the attack and the fact that he ordered other French troops to fire on the men for their failed efforts.  He also confronts Menjou with Menjou's own complicity in that whole sick incident.

Having achieved a great early standing with his 1956 crime film THE KILLING, Kubrick became internationally known on the basis of this masterful and scathing combination of war and courtroom drama that, as would be the pattern of many of his films, was also the source of controversy.  Its depiction of the behavior of French commanding officers attracted a lot of scorn in France, so much so that PATHS OF GLORY was not shown there until the late 1970s; and several US bases in other countries in Europe weren't allowed to show it either until the early 1970s.  As with so many detractors of Kubrick's films, however, the French and American military censors missed the point.  The film does not dishonor the men who actually did the fighting in the war, but it does severely scrutinize the commanders who sit behind their desks in sheltered chateaus and prosecute wars and trials as if they were marks of manhood, and destroy those who won't follow the most ludicrous of orders, without having a clue as to what their decisions will mean in the end.  This can be said not only of World War I, but also of almost every military conflict that has come in its wake, from World War II to Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.  What is equally important is how Kubrick, often criticized in his career as a cold director, is able to depict the best of humanity (in Douglas and the three men he has to defend) against both the inhumanity of the kind of trench warfare that World War I was, and the basic inhuman military bureaucracy represented by Macready, Menjou, and Anderson.  PATHS OF GLORY, much like the similar Lewis Milestone classic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, is a hard-hitting look at what war does; and unlike so many jingoistic films of the war genre, it shows how it damages soldiers and also how it absolutely corrupts commanders.

Kubrick shot most of this film in the countryside outside of Munich, West Germany, and he gets the most out of his actors, including Douglas (in one of his most powerful and humane performances), while Menjou and Macready accurately depict the toadying commanders who plan and decide with only glory in their minds (but as the old saying goes, ""the paths of glory lead but to the grave"").  The end result in PATHS OF GLORY was a milestone film for Kubrick as a director, and a signpost for Hollywood that it could no longer depict war as merely a flag-waving, patriotic venture or grist for political propaganda.  It is a masterpiece of the highest order.",1355443200,3,4676,4.780397022332506

152427,5,0792841409,"""Paths of Glory"" is one of the greatest anti-war films ever made. It's also the first Stanley Kubrick film that truly can be called a masterpiece. Kubrick had begun with ""Fear and Desire,"" but had withdrawn that film from circulation due to his embarrassment over it (although in autumn 2012 it is being released on DVD and Blu-ray). He followed that picture with ""Killer's Kiss,"" a short but engaging piece of film noir about a boxer and a dancer. Then came ""The Killing,"" a VERY good film about a racetrack heist.

And then ""Paths of Glory."" This is the film in which Kubrick makes the transition to a great filmmaker from a merely good one. The plot, the pacing, the camera work, the acting by Kirk Douglas and a fine supporting cast -- every element was in place. World War I was an especially brutal war for soldiers, and Kubrick's shots of the trenches bring out the horror they must have faced.

So what's the difference between this film and Kubrick's 1987 film, ""Full Metal Jacket""? Chiefly, it's this: ""Paths of Glory"" is an anti-war film, whereas ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a war film. That is, ""Paths"" clearly is condemnatory, while ""Full Metal Jacket"" simply observes. Yet even ""Jacket"" has the power to horrify the viewer, being unsparing in its depiction of war.

152432,4,0792841409,"Stanley Kubrick is regarded as one of the greatest auteurs of cinema; one of the single greatest directors of all time, and I happen to wholeheartedly agree with that assessment.  The way that he crafts various pictures is laced with such marvelous skill and style.  He was able to build a personal attachment to such a wide range of films, never pigeonholing himself with regurgitated themes but allowing his personal feelings and opinions to infiltrate many subjects.  Whether he is tackling violence, horror, sci-fi, political satire, sex or war, Kubrick brought his all to the set.

`Paths of Glory' was a glaring omission on my part, for it was one of those films that I knew I needed to see not just because of my admiration for Kubrick but because it is largely considered one of the greatest films ever made.

It's not THAT good.

As an early Kubrick, there is a roughness present here that takes down some of the film's impact.  The editing is abrupt in scenes and the performance level of some of the actors is a tad green and underdeveloped (Timothy Carey is a particular sore spot).  The film's outset is littered with small scenes that don't always play out quite right because of the awkwardness of the delivery of dialog (the scene where one soldier confronts another about a murder is particularly stiff).  Some of the clich&eacute;s on certain characters, in particular George Macready's character, are off-putting, but I blame that on the generic way in which he was played.

With those flaws in mind, the pluses to this film are certainly highs that outweigh those lows to a degree.

Kirk Douglas and Adolphe Menjou are particularly outstanding in their respective roles, and I found the screenplay's ability to be quick and concise a total bonus.  The way that the material is briskly handled is nice considering that it could have easily lagged in parts had the film delved into the self-indulgent.  That is also something I rather enjoyed about this film.  Kubrick is accused by his naysayers as having been pretentious and self-indulgent in his filmmaking, but there isn't an ounce of that here.  While he certainly crafts a visual marvel (the cinematography is absolutely STUNNING) and inserts his expected depth of humanity (the final scene, with his wife, is a marvelous end note that completely shifts perspective on the film), the film itself cuts the fat and delivers a very `to the point' exercise, and the material benefits because of it.  The anti-war sentiments and the depiction of corrupted `justice' are given the perfect amount of breathing room without becoming burdensome.  I also really appreciated the court room scene and Douglas's monologue.  In many courtroom films those closing `words' can become overwhelming and preposterous in their obvious `manipulating'.  Douglas handles it with class, and the screenplay was pitch perfect in creating a `moment' without going overboard.

In the end, I am a fan.  This is a great film and a perfect jump-off for anything interested in delving into Kubrick's impressive filmography.  His 1986 masterpiece `Full Metal Jacket' makes a bolder anti-war statement and ends with a complimentary moment of unexpected depth (albeit far more brutal in tone), but that doesn't make `Paths of Glory' any less impactful.",1341446400,4,3292,5.012867647058823
152433,5,0792841409,"This is a horrifying and nearly perfect masterpiece about murder committed by stupid and brutal old men, enacted through the merciless, relentless apparatus of government and despite the revulsion of humans compelled to the service of that institution. But the subject is not the art.

The brilliance of this film is Kubrick's refusal to edit. Three innocent men walk slowly with a priest to their deaths. One cries, one is silent and one is gravely wounded. There are no cut-scenes of cheesy grimaces, no falsely protracted or contracted time and there is no hope or mercy. The firing squad aims and shoots and the men are dead.

The subject is murder. The art is so good that we are sickened.",1340496000,,694,4.775
152434,4,0792841409,"Despite its many virtues, and manifest greatness, Paths Of Glory did not get even a single Academy Award nomination, and was banned from many European film festivals, due to French protests. That the film was released just shortly after David Lean's first epic, The Bridge On The River Kwai, no doubt was part of the reason, for that film- a widescreen Cinemascope blockbuster, in color, from a major studio- is also a great war film, albeit from a wholly different end of the spectrum. Which returns me to my earlier point, that Paths Of Glory is not merely a war film nor an anti-war film. It is both, and revels in such. As French filmmaker Francois Truffaut aptly noted, all war films hold a power that makes calling them anti-war ridiculous. We can not be fully realized human beings without acknowledging that we love war and killing, and war films indulge this, even if they sometimes slip anti-war messages within them. The thrilling shots of Dax leading his men in No Man's Land prove this.

  Of course, there are always people and critics who will whiff on even the greatest works of art. Bosley Crowther, the ridiculously bad film critic for the New York Times, wrote:

  We feel that Mr. Kubrick--and Mr. Douglas--have made a damaging mistake in playing it in colloquial English, with American accents and attitudes, while studiously making it look as much as possible like a document of the French Army in World War I. The illusion of reality is blown completely whenever anybody talks.

  This sort of comment, by Crowther, is akin to those many bad critics make in defense of subtitling over dubbing foreign films. Anyone who is hung up on the American accents of an American made film, wherever it is set, simply is invalidating their worth as a critic of note.

  Paths Of Glory is a great film, made by a great director at the start of a career that is nonpareil in American cinema. The Criterion Collection has also don eon eof its best jobs, in recent years, of restoring this classic, and surrounding it with features that are worthy of the art they comment upon. War may be hell, but this release is Kubrickian heaven. If you've never seen the film before, or merely want to see it again, this is the release to engage.",1339027200,,2242,4.66243654822335
152435,3,0792841409,"I eagerly unwrapped this Blu-ray disc and popped it into the new Samsung.  The titles were crisp and clear- perfect.  The first indoor shot, though, was alarming grainy.  After checking the HDMI cable (analog-era habit), I was dismayed at the grain in the film stock- most obvious in bright scenes and dark scenes in the first half of the film. My 25-year-old Criterion LaserDisc of this film is superior: it's like the difference between Panatomic X and Tri X. And, yes, I did look at both on the same screen (a 42-inch Panasonic plasma).  The sound on the Blu-ray disc is better, but the graininess is a major disappointment.
As for the movie- what can one say that's new?  Superb tracking shots.  Hair-raising battle.  Outrageous trial and execution.  Great visual storytelling: a flare reveals the bodies in No-Man's Land that we hadn't seen in the darkness.  The gleaming light in the places of power juxtaposed with the smoke and mud of the front.  The march to the place of execution- an evocation of Calvary.  The cast is terrific- Kirk Douglas in all his righteousness, whether terse or overt.  George Macready as the villainous, volcanic general.  The underrated Ralph Meeker as the embodiment of a doomed generation. Timothy Carey in all his pathetic glory. Wayne Morris as a weasel. And then there is the final blow- the only German we see in the film is a frightened girl (the future Mrs. Kubrick) singing a sentimental song that brings the French soldiers to tears.
Altogether, arguably the best anti-war film ever.  It's just too bad that the Criterion Blu-ray's visual quality is such a disappointment.",1330473600,4,1618,4.8791208791208796

152458,5,0792841409,"This movie is worth seeing on so many levels. First, it's a film about war and the circumstances that often occur when mistakes are made during it. Many have described it as anti-war, but I view it as an example of abuse of power during war. He is saying in the film that we should always remember that it's the soldiers who actually fight, not the generals. It reminds us that, paraphrasing William Tecumseh Sherman, it good that war is so brutal, lest we become too fond of it.

This film would not have been made without Douglas, who pushed for its production. Douglas was and is a treasure for any one who appreciates the film industry and it's contribution to the world.

Second, as with ""List of Adrian Messenger"", it shows Douglas' acting versatility, and is worth seeing just for that. Stanley Kubrick directed, and I feel it's one of his best. There are many great performances in this film, but your attention is always riveted on Douglas.

The attack fails and the remnants of Dax's regiment retreat, a fact which so infuriates the French high command that three soldiers are pulled from the ranks, supposedly at random, to be shot for cowardice.

This isn't fiction; it's based on an actual WW1 incident that historians have verified.

The defence of the three condemned troops falls on Colonel Dax, who, in civilian life, is one of France's leading criminal lawyers.

The end result is brilliant. This film has timeless things to say about war, physical and moral courage, the internal machinations of bureaucracies and the atrocities that can result from venal and totally amoral people being put in positions of authority.

152462,3,0792841409,"I am not a Stanley Kubrick fan.  Of all the ""great"" directors, he is my least favorite.  I find most of his movies to very carefully crafted and visually interesting...but cold and sterile as well.  Kubrick doesn't seem to know how real people behave and thus his movies are usually full of cardboard caricatures or absurdly over-the-top creations.  I can admire the craftsmanship.  I can appreciate the breakthrough work he brought us with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and yet be bored to tears by the movie, whose most human character is a computer named HAL.  I can admire his guts in taking on a daring story like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, yet wonder why he insisted on making the whole thing so stylistically in-your-face that any emotional heft is blunted.  But that's my opinion...clearly others love Kubrick and I have no problem with that.  As long as we're not trapped in a room together with no other topic to discuss!

PATHS OF GLORY, an early Kubrick film, suffers from many of the same problems.  Yet to some extent, it does work.  I've heard it called ""shattering""...but with so many ""brutality of war"" scenes having come since its 1957 release (such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), it really doesn't have the ability to shock.  It tells the story of a group of French soldiers in the trenches of WWI, who have been ordered to take a German fortification...no matter the cost.  When the troops get only halfway there, and have already been nearly decimated, they turn back.  In fury at having been denied a political helpful victory, their general demands a court martial.  Three men are randomly selected to stand trial (as ""examples"" to others) for cowardice.

Our central character is Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) the highest ranking officer in the trenches, who must actually lead the attack.  He's shown as a stolid, loyal soldier who also cares about the price in blood his men must pay.  He will loyally engage in the attack (and will, in fact, be first out of the trenches)...but you know he hates it all because he sees the futility.  Before the war, he was a lawyer, so he also ends up serving as the defender for the three unlucky men forced to face a court martial whose outcome is already determined.

Kubrick shows us the contrast between the generals, who headquarter in luxury palaces, and the troops who hunker in bunkers with artillery blasting around them.  There is no subtlety to the story.  The entire war seems to simply be a toy for the generals to play with.  We never even see the enemy...because they are scarcely as bad as the leaders who clearly have no problems with using men as cannon fodder.  Douglas is our navigator through both worlds...he straddles the line.

The story itself is gripping if simplistic.  It is based on true events, which helps.  Certainly it raises intellectual indignation.  But it raises no emotional ire.  My mind was gripped but my heart was mostly on the sidelines.  There are a few moments as the 3 unlucky soldiers prepare to face justice where they break with understandable fear and emotion...but I stood distant and observe.  Kubrick doesn't want our empathy.  In much the way Bertholt Brecht wrote scripts that were meant to discourage emotion but encourage intellectual outrage...Kubrick's films stir curiosity, an appreciation of black humor and admiration for his carefully and lovingly constructed shots (there are several excellent tracking shots in PATHS OF GLORY).  The film is great to look at (I saw the Criterion BluRay...excellent black and white...the lighting design is particularly effectively shown).

Everyone in the film is supposed to be French, but everyone either has an American or British accent (in fact, is there anyone more ""American"" than the young Kirk Douglas?).  Normally, we accept this kind of thing without trouble...but so many of the characters, particularly Dax and Ralph Meeker's Corporal Paris just seem so very American.  Upright, stoic, wry humor and a keen sense of injustice.  Meeker is handsome (he looks like a young, CITIZEN KANE era Orson Welles) and Douglas is in his prime.  Perhaps this is all quibbling...but I understand that Douglas was a driving force behind getting the film made, and of course, a star capable of selling it at the box office.  That doesn't change the fact that I think he was miscast.  He is too ""straightforward"" of an actor...there is little room for subtlety.  And because PATHS OF GLORY already takes such clear-cut sides and wears its point-of-view all to plainly on its sleeve, a little subtlety might have been welcome.

What was welcome was a surprisingly spry performance from Adolph Menjou as the general who is really in charge of it all.  He manipulates those around him with great cheer.  He sees all and understands it and uses it to his advantage.  He'll promote someone or stab them in the back with the same zeal and good-nature.  At first, his character seemed utterly like a caricature...but slyly the script allowed him to be the most fun and ultimately the most chilling character.

If you're fan of beautifully constructed black and white moving images, PATHS OF GLORY is particularly splendid.  Kubrick was a photographer first, and his sensibilities are evident.  He film is artistically and carefully constructed.

While I can't call this a must see, it is still, despite all my general objections, interesting and fast paced (only 88 minutes).  It is never boring.

The Criterion Blu-Ray is excellent, of course.  I wish the commentary (which fawns over Kubrick) had included another point of view...I think for a director who is as controversial as Kubrick a pro and con commentary (or two commentaries) would have shown great foresight from Criterion.  The video extras are good, including a rather nice little interview with Kubrick's wife Christiane, who makes a brief but memorable appearance late in PATHS OF GLORY.  And there's a nice 1979 TV interview with Douglas.  All-in-all a fine Criterion product.",1311984000,10,5967,4.923847695390782

Human beings love to think the human race has advanced from the dark corners of ancient civilizations, but has it? I mean has anything really changed at all since the dawn of mankind? These are the questions Paths of Glory asks. The tough questions that most care not to think about. That was the power and value of legendary director Stanley Kubrick. This movie is a scathing expos on the distorted mechanics of war. The central story takes place on the French front lines during World War I. The Generals want results and rally for promotions. The chain of command is so out of control that no one has to take responsibility for anything that goes wrong, only for what goes right. If something goes wrong it is promptly blamed on the troops. The result of this system is one bloody massacre after the next. In this story the soldiers are put on an impossible mission only to get charged as cowards after they refuse to run into a direct hail of bullets. In a frustrated rage the General attempts to fire a bomb attack on his own men for refusing to charge into certain destruction. Military bureaucracy ensues. This film was banned in France for many years. The reason? The argument put forth is so well calculated and expressed that even the most dim minded individual could be driven to deep contemplation after viewing it. Paths of Glory uncomfortably plays out more like an episode of The Twilight Zone then an actual historical document. The unfairness, tactics, and red tape used by the military command in this film will most likely upset you. That is precisely the point. The legendary Kirk Douglas defines lead role and Stanly Kubrick displays directorial genius.

General Broulard: It would be a pity to lose your promotion before you get it. A promotion you have so very carefully planned for.
Colonel Dax: Sir, would you like me to suggest what you can do with that promotion?",1310083200,,1959,4.678260869565217

I've seen this film around 8 times, and I just don't tire of it. Douglass powerful lead performance, arguably the best role he's ever had, as an officer fighting the military muscle at the top that uses scapegoats at the bottom for why a hopeless mission fails. But he's a complex man as well, and this movie though harsh on war is more attack on bureaucratic ranglings and abuse of power than an attack on war itself. It's a great film, from the wonderful cinematography during the major battle scene to the many scenes of riveting, though hopeless, debate, to the final beautiful scene so poignant and real.

I have seen all of Kubrick's films with the exception of Spartacus, Killer's Kiss and Fear and Desire. What strikes me is how varied his films are. Science fiction, comedy, period drama, crime, historical epic and psychological drama. I have to admit that I don't like everything he's been involved with, but I admire the way he told a story.

If I could choose a Kubrick film for a Criterion release, Paths of Glory wouldn't be it. The Shining, 2001 and Dr. Strangelove are all more deserving, but each already has a good quality release.

The film is about war, or rather the hypocrisy and futility of war. It's set in France in WW1. A group of soldiers is given the task of capturing the Anthill; a strategically important piece of land held by the German army. With 8,000 people in the unit, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) is told to expect more than half of the men under his command to die.

He leads the attack and it fails, with many of the men never even leaving the trench due to the heavy gunfire.

The result is that three men are selected to represent the unit and are charged with cowardice in the face of the enemy. Dax is chosen to defend the men in a court martial and failure would result in a firing squad for the three.

It's an interesting tale; part war film, part psychological drama and part trial.

Douglas gives a strong performance. The 88 minutes pass very quickly. I'm surprised that Kubrick made no attempt to make the accents sound authentic. There are no subtitles. Some of the characters sound English and others American. There's not a French accent to be heard anywhere.

Shot in black and white, this is a bleak film. The trenches are muddy and wet, everything looks gray and there aren't many uplifting moments.

The message is clear. War is futile and honor is not always preserved.

I hope this release leads to more Kubrick titles getting the Criterion treatment. The Killing appears to be next in line.",1303689600,,2090,4.634146341463414

I'm adding another 5 star, because the movie is different, engaging and helps me see things in my life in a new way. The description of the leaders, and the bureaucracy of the military, is depicted in a way that i instantly recognize. These leaders are interested only in victory, victory that enhances their reputation and ladder climbing. They have little interest in the soldiers who die for the 'cause'.  Kubrick's screenplay is a work of beauty. Each scene describes the characters brilliantly, without the dialog.  There are multiple scenes of the leaders walking through the trenches. The hypocritical general walks away from the battle (quickly), while stopping occasionally to ask a soldier ""Ready to kill some Germans?""  The general then asks a soldier ""Do you have a wife?"" The soldier says ""Yes, and 2 children"". The general replies ""O well, i'm sure your mother is proud of you anyway"". (Meaning, the general isn't listening to the response, he's just quacking pre-thought out statements).  He meets another soldier, ""Ready to kill some Germans?"" The man starts babbling, and another soldier says ""He has shell shock sir."" The general is instantly angry ""Nonsense! There is no such thing as shell-shock"" and slaps the soldier for his cowardice.
That's just the first 20 min. So much in this film.  Kirk Douglas is masterful, but Kubrick's artistry is really the star of this movie.",1292716800,5,1461,4.995884773662551
152492,4,0792841409,"Politics may lead to war but when war becomes little more than political ploy to protect those in charge the average soldier ends up as the victim sacrificed to ego. Stanley Kubrick's first masterpiece ""Paths of Glory"" focuses on a colonel (Kirk Douglas) who defends his men on the charges of cowardice when they fail at carrying out a mission that his superiors knew to be impossible. Douglas gives one of his finest performances in Kubrick's film and the top notch supporting cast includes Ralph Meeker, Adolphe Menjou, Richard Anderson, and George Macready.

Kubrick's film is a study in the hypocrisy and gap that exists between waging war and the politics of war, it's impact on our humanity and the often absurd lengths that those in charge will go to as a means of keeping the their world neat and tidy. Based on the novel by Humphrey Cobb and written for the screen by Calder Willingham (the earliest drafts), Kubirck and Jim Thompson (who rewrote the script adding despite Willingham later claim about 50% new material to the script), Kubrick already demonstrates his expertise at setting up and executing complex sequences just as well as his smaller intimate moments of character conflict.

The Criterion edition of the film (this review is for the Blu-ray)is the ultimate edition. It has the correct aspect ratio. The transfer has been lovingly restored from the best elements available and detail, depth and blacks are remarkable throughout the presentation. This is a huge step up from the original DVD. ""Paths of Glory"" is beautifully rendered on Blu-ray. The mono audio sounds quite good with dialogue quite clear.

Be aware however that there is a jump cut in this restoration where a few frames are missing and UCLA/MGM which restored the film were unable to find adequate source for that footage. It lasts only a second at about 56:04.

As with all Criterion films this comes with a book featuring an essay on the making of the film by film critic/scholar James Naermore, a 1966 audio interview with Kubrick about the making of the film (a bit of trivia--Kubrick ""suggested"" a less bleak ending in hopes that he could keep the dark ending that is IN the film much as Hitchcock used to bluff the Hayes commission by putting things in his script and sometimes film that he KNEW he would never end up using in the final product), a 1979 interview with star Douglas and new interviews with producer Jan Harlan and James B. Harris as well as actress Christiane Kubrick. We also get a vintage French TV special on the inspiration for the film as well as the original theatrical trailer. The audio commentary by Gary Giddins is quite good providing insight into the filmmaking process as well as themes later elaborated in other Kubrick films.

As with all of Criterion latest Blu-ray releases (and their latest DVD releases as well), this is a top notch highly recommended version of the film. Yes, it is expensive but if you don't want to pay the full retail price wait for a two-for-one Criterion sale (as I did).

While Kubrick directed noteworthy films before ""Paths of Glory"" this film provided him with the opportunity to step up to bigger, more elaborate productions and demonstrated the themes that would preoccupy for the remainder of his career as a film director.

152494,4,0792841409,"Any war will have its stories of injustice told by people on both sides.  For the French, 1915, the year of the very much publicized military injustice during World War I in which French soldiers, exhausted of fighting and were demoralized against their battle against the Germans and when the soldiers were ordered to seize a location held by the Germans, with so many of their men dying, the soldiers in the trenches refused.  Knowing they had no chance.

Disgusted by the soldiers disobedience, the General ordered for a trial of six corporals and 18 enlisted men and wanted to use them as an example of what happens when soldiers show cowardice to the enemy.  The punishment is death.

This true and controversial story was then made to a novel by Humphrey Cobb in 1935, later adapted for the stage by Sidney Howard and later received a film adaptation in 1957 by filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who co-wrote the screenplay with Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson.

VIDEO:

""Paths of Glory"" is presented in black and white (1:66:1 aspect ratio).  Previous to watching the Criterion Collection version of ""Paths of Glory"", I had a chance to do some screen comparisons with the previous 1999 MGM version that was presented in standard definition.  With that being said, the Criterion Collection of ""Paths of Glory"" is the better looking version.  You can see the detail of the clothing, the detail on the clothing and the skin and I'm sure on Blu-ray the detail is even more well-defined.  While the previous version by MGM seemed as if it went through digital noise reduction and looks a bit blurry compared to this Criterion version because not only is there no grain, detail was subdued and picture quality was blurry.

So, you're definitely getting a much better looking version of the film from the Criterion Collection and granted, the MGM DVD release was 12-years ago and released during the infancy of DVD.

According to the Criterion Collection, Stanley Kubrick's technical assistant Leon Vitali supervised this new high-definition digital transfer, which was created on an HD Spirit 2K from a 35mm fine-grain master positive from UCLA film archivist Robert Gitt's collection.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system.

AUDIO:

""Paths of Glory - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #538"" is presented in monaural.  According to the Criterion Collection, the monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from Robert Gitt's 35mm monaural magnetic track.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.

Dialogue and every sound effect was quite clear and the musical score by Gerald Fried sounds good on DVD as well.  Granted, I'm sure the lossless soundtrack for the Blu-ray version is the best audio out there for the film but the DVD still sounds great and I detected no audio anomalies whatsoever.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH (optional).  For those who are wondering if there is a French soundtrack, while the MGM version did come with a French soundtrack, the Criterion Collection release only has the English monaural soundtrack.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Paths of Glory - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #538"" comes with the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Path of Glory"" was definitely a bold film at its time.  While many war films were seen as patriotic, this independently produced American film was anything but.

But this was a film that was the synergy that director Stanley Kubrick needed and definitely led to him directing even larger films (after ""Paths of Glory"", Kubrick followed up with ""Spartacus"" (1960), ""Lolita"" (1962), ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" (1964), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and many more films).

As a filmmaker, ""Paths of Glory"" showcased wonderful cinematography from Georg Krause, especially the film's longer shots and soldiers dying at war and how it was wonderfully directed by Kubrick.  The chaos on the battlefield required a smooth, orchestral fluidity and it was captured amazingly well on screen.

As for the film, it was enjoyable from beginning to end, but I often remember the criticism that filmmaker Francois Truffaut had with ""Paths of Glory"" and that was a technical error of Col. Dax saluting without his hat on and his main focus was General Mireau was not believable as a ""villain"".

And the more I thought about this, I think back on other war/anti-war films such as Oliver Stone's 1986 film ""Platoon"" and how the character of Sgt. Barnes (played by Tom Berenger) was a very cold man, fighting on the side of the American military but also a man willing to have his own soldiers killed.  Sgt. Barnes was seen as evil because he had no compassion for anyone.  You can't help but dislike him.

With ""Paths of Glory"", I can see what Truffaut was saying about a lack of psychological credibility in General Mireau's behavior.  Although there was personal ambition involved, the fact was that was how the upper staff was as well as we see with General George Broulard and eventually the confrontation between Col. Dax and General Broulard.  There is no ""villain"" but the military was corrupt in the fact that they valued nothing about the soldier's below them but their own success.

Would we be enjoying ""Paths of Glory"" much more if Mireau's order to kill his own troops moved forward?  Would our feelings have changed if 100 men were to be executed?  I didn't see Mireau as evil but just an extension of politics and its corruption.  Call it ""evil"" or just how things are with politics/military tied to politicians, I do feel that ""Paths of Glory"" had no need for a psychological villain because it was business as usual for the higher up in command and doing whatever they can to please whoever they kowtow to...and those I see as corrupt.  Of course, modern sensibilities by general public is much different now than it was back in the beginning of the Century, especially with World War I, as many of these military leaders were considered as national heroes and respected by their countrymen and were literally seen like how rock/pop stars are today.

If anything, ""Paths of Glory"" was a film that probably opened up an old wound of soldiers that never healed back in 1957.  The fact is that war brings out the worse in everyone and in this case, innocents being tried for a crime despite how much they served the military and their country and being executed by the luck of the draw.

As for the DVD, this is the best version of the film out on DVD today.  Compared to the 1999 MGM release, the Criterion Collection looks absolutely wonderful.  There is no DNR and you can see the detail and grain much more in this release.  Also, what I love about this DVD Release are its special features.  The inclusion of the 1979 interview with Kirk Douglas, the 1997 featurette on Theophile Maupas (one of the real-life corporals that was executed) and other lengthy and enjoyable special features that the Criterion Collection is known for.  Once again, magnificent additions to this already wonderful DVD release. Of course, if you have a Blu-ray player and want the definitive version, then definitely get the Blu-ray version of this film.

Overall, ""Paths of Glory"" is a wonderful film, a well-acted film that really showcases Kirk Douglas talent as an actor, Kubrick as a writer but most importantly, a film that established a then, new American director, Stanley Kubrick.  It's an important film that deserves being included in your own personal Criterion Collection.

I've satisfied myself with the vanilla disc offered by MGM.  I was elated when I heard Criterion was releasing a version with supplements.  I don't know if this is one the best DVD packages ever released or one of the best films finally being graced with long coming extras.  I will not bore you with a rehash of the film because I'm assuming you've either seen the film or, if you haven't, why should I ruin it for you.  What I got by accessing the supplements is a snapshot of director Stanley Kubrick at a certain juncture of his career.  In a sense what you come to understand is that life imitated art in the making of ""Paths of Glory"".  Much like the military machinations portrayed in the film Kubrick and his partner, James B. Harris, had to negotiate their own minefields in getting their vision to the screen.  Fresh off the critical sucess of ""The Killing"", Kubrick and Harris had to make certain compromises.  They needed an established star for their picture.  Kirk Douglas was committed to the project but his years as a leading man also carried a degree of ego.  There was also wrangling over the script which was worked over by not only Kubrick but pulp-novelist Jim Thompson and Calder Willingham (""The Graduate"").  Though largely an independent film Kubrick and Harris also had to satisfy their distributor, United Artists, whose main concern was it's commercial viability not only in the States but in Europe where it's themes may hit a raw nerve.  There is a lot of mythology surrounding Kubrick notably that he was a megalomaniacal hermit who ensconced himself in England committed to a singular artistic vision.  What comes through here is that he was a generous artist who welcomed others input if it served the better good of the film.  With his experiences on this film you begin to understand why he sought more autonomy.  Most enlightening here is the commentary by Kubrick scholar Gary Giddins and interviews with Harris, Kubrick's producer Jan Harlan, and his widow, Christiane.  There's an interview with Kirk Douglas from 1979 that's intriguing enough that only perfunctorily mentions ""Paths of Glory"" but serves more as an overview of Douglas' career.

the exhaustive amounts of supplementary material included with every film.

This BR disc has been given the signature Criterion Collection treatment with wonderful results.

As long as the menu screen is up,  Col. Dax will perpetually walk the endless miles of trenches and pass the countless faces of the mud covered soldiers...
very poetic and creative use of menu design.

152507,5,0792841409,"The negative portrayal of the French Army in this fine film, based on a true incident that became a still-powerful novel by Humphrey Cobb, so outraged the French Government that they would not give any help in the making of this film, even though 54 exhausted divisions of the French Army mutinied in 1917 against any further futile attacks against the Germans. So Kubrick and Douglas ironically shot the film near Munich Germany, with many off-duty Munich police playing Franch poilu in a 5000 yard German pasture expertly transformed into a WWI battlefield. The ""French"" chateau was Schleissheim palace near Dachau Concentration Camp. As a result of French pique the film was not shown in France until 1975.

However the most ironic touch was to give the role of the drunken, cowardly Lt. Roget to real-life actor/WWII hero Wayne Morris, who left Hollywood in 1942 to join the U.S. Naval Reserve. As a USNR combat pilot assigned to the U.S.S. Essex, he shot down 7 Japanese planes and was awarded 4 DFC's and 2 Air Medals for helping sink 5 Japanese ships.

Kirk Douglas stars as a French Army officer in the WW1 drama, serving under General George Macready, who, when a suicide mission he has ordered fails, demands that three soldiers be chosen at random and tried for cowardice.  Appalled at that turn of events, Douglas decides to defend the three doomed men in a court-martial whose outcome has already been decided.

PATHS OF GLORY, adapted from a novel based on fact by Humphrey Cobb, is a stunning black-and-white film that seems to become even more meaningful as time goes by.  Directed by Stanley Kubrick, it co-stars Adolphe Menjou, Ralph Meeker and Wayne Morris.

This new restored edition from The Criterion Collection features a wealth of extras, including audio commentary by critic Gary Giddins, an excerpt from a 1966 audio interview by Kubrick, a 1979 television interview with Douglas,  a French television piece about the actual incident that inspired the book, plus new interviews with Kubrick associates Jan Harlan, James B. Harris and widow Christiane Kubrick.  Additionally, the set has a booklet containing an essay by film scholar James Naremore.

152512,5,0792841409,"Stanley Kubrick's work is distinguished in many ways, but he rarely gets enough credit for the fact that he made *two* of the best anti-war films ever made. While most people are familiar with Full Metal Jacket, it is criminal that Paths Of Glory is not better known. It is probably the closest thing to a genuinely flawless film that Kubrick ever made. Everything from production design to camera motion to dialogue to actor performance is spot on in this picture. And that's leaving aside the adamantine philosophical message presented here, one that Kubrick often returned to in his movies: The Absurdity of Humanity's Brutality On Itself. Although most of his films address this theme, in Paths Of Glory we see it as the central motif, and it is played beautifully and tragically. One can appreciate the folly of war generally, and the utter stupidity of The Great War specifically, from this film as well as any history text or documentary.

Here Kubrick made his first extensive use of what was to become his signature camera motion: the corridor tracking shot. We see General Mireau and Colonel Dax survey their men in the trenches via this device early in the film, and later watch the condemned men trudge toward their execution through a corridor of fellow fusiliers--clearly a device meant to pose the question, ""Where is the real danger? From the machineries of war, or from ourselves?"" Kubrick also portrays the action here as though it is in the form of a chess game, as he does in a number of other films (see The Killing). Chessboards of sorts abound here (the floor of the inquest room and other places in the palace come to mind), and the characters are shown moving in chess-like fashion as befits their rank. Watching this film from a technical standpoint, one can truly understand why he earned the nickname ""The Master."" He was.

Though most of Stanley Kubrick's work has received several releases and upgrades on modern formats, his earlier pictures (and Barry Lyndon, still, if memory serves) have not received their due. It is heartening to see that Criterion has secured the rights to release this wonderfully deserving film in a new transfer; having seen what they've done with Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai, I am excited to see the results of this, one of my top 3 Kubrick films. The currently available DVD is satisfactory from an image quality standpoint, but I have no doubt the upcoming Criterion release will represent a quantum leap of an upgrade. The extra features alone warrant another purchase.

152513,4,0792841409,"When I think of this film, I find it incredibly powerful because of the indignation of Kirk Douglas's character in regard to his superiors. I don't think of it as a war film at all - for me, Kubrick's films aren't about their settings so much, they are all about the way we see humans interact, trying to interact and/or failing to interact.

That theme is repeated in most of his films and for some it may be the reason that they are hard to watch.
Many of his films are technically perfect or close to it, but the actors in them seem strange, frustrated or hard to understand, their motivations unclear. They may be scared of some unknown thing or feel powerless to act. To me, that sounds like real life.
Perhaps I am being pessimistic here, but the more I think about Kubrick and the way he presents the human race, I realise I cannot escape this conclusion.
May I suggest you watch the film, which is great in its own right, but not as a war film - but keeping in mind the aspects mentioned above. I hope I've been helpful in some way.",1274572800,,1040,4.279187817258883

Yes, it is anti-war, but it is not so much anti-war as it is an indictment of the aloof, faulty and utterly incompetent politicians and generals of the armies who are so willing to blame their failings on scapegoat underlings, which caused this war (WWI) to go on year after year in a stalemate of unprecedented bloodletting, and which led to this war being optimistically described as ""The War to End All Wars"" in its aftermath.  In light of the injustices meted out to the three ""heroes"" of the story earlier in the movie, one can only feel hope for the French soldiers enjoying their last moments of revelry in the beer hall in the movie's final minutes that the same won't happen to them.

I think this film is as weak as ""Full Metal Jacket"" which also has a limited plot. Kirk Douglas and all the actors make this an entertaining film, but the plot limits the film to where one would not need to watch it more than once. I consider this a companion to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", which is another film about World War I. The difference is though that the latter film has a very strong plot pushing the story. We can feel for those characters. I was also disappointed in ""Full Metal Jacket"" due to the sparce plot.

152527,5,0792841409,"Paths of Glory is a masterpiece. It's one of the greatest anti-war films of all time. It shows a grim and disturbingly violent reality that, at the time, many other war films never dared to enter. Stanley Kubrick and Kirk Douglas achieved this task, and they have done an extraordinary job with it.

There are few heroes and many cowards. These men that have fought against German artillery are rarely think of victory over the enemy. They mostly think of themselves, their families, their girlfriends, and their parents. So when they have been chosen to take the Ant Hill, many of them retreat without hesitation. As a result, Generals Mireau & Broulard order three men from each company to be brought to a court-martial. This ultimately leads to all three men being sentenced to death. Colonel Dax (Douglas), however, is not giving up on his own men, and he finds ways to give them their own reprieves. But will the solutions be enough?

I have been a fan of Kubrick ever since I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey on VHS. Five of his films are among my favorites: 2001, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Dr. Strangelove, and Paths of Glory. Paths of Glory was immediately added right after I saw this movie on DVD. This shows his masterful directing at an early age. The way he portrays war in a much negative light is something that has probably now been imitated ever since it was released in theaters. It's an almost flawless film, with great performances from Douglas, Menjou, Macready, Meeker, Anderson, Turkel, and others. Not to mention the unforgettable tearjerker ending. I'm glad that I discovered this film.

When Roman armies were unsuccessful, as in the early campaigns against Spartacus, the commanders could ""decimate"" the troops.  Each group of 10 soldiers in the legion would draw lots and pick one soldier.  This soldier would be beaten to death with clubs to atone for the legions's lack of courage and success.  Since lots were drawn, the sacrifice may have the best soldier or the worst, it didn't matter.
And this is the essence of ""The Paths of Glory"".  10 were requested, but three would suffice.  It is a simple decimation of the troops.  It is a powerful movie now because of the absurdity of the idea.",1247616000,,662,4.559322033898305
152529,5,0792841409,"Paths of Glory (Stanley Kubrick, 1957)

I spent most of my life running Stanley Kubrick down. Until 2008, I'd only seen two and a half Kubrick movies I actually liked: Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, and the first forty-five minutes if Full Metal Jacket. Problem was, I hadn't seen Kubrick's entire oeuvre, and I basically extrapolated from the movies I'd seem that I simply couldn't stand. But a friend whose judgment I implicitly trust kept telling me I absolutely had to see The Killing, and I eventually broke down and did so. He was right, as he almost always is (thanks, Niall!), and so I started tracking down the Kubrick movies I hadn't seen before, especially the early ones (after all, The Killing was made in 1957, Lolita in 1962; I figured the farther back I went, the more likely I was to like a random Kubrick flick). While Paths of Glory does have some of the same hammer-to-the-face unsubtlety that would mar later Kubrick work like the second half of Full Metal Jacket, there's no denying that Paths of Glory is an undoubtedly powerful film, and must be counted a success.

The film centers around Dax (Kirk Douglas), a colonel during World War I who is ordered by his superior General Mireau (George MacReady), who's mad as a hatter, to take the Ant Hill, a German fortification that's long been considered impregnable. Still, Dax and his squad, the 701st, are considered the bets in the business, the guys who will never back down, no matter the odds, and so Dax comes up with one of those out-of-the-box plans that's actually crazy enough that it might work. Come dawn, the strike commences, and despite Dax's excellent strategy and the bravery of the troops, they're pummelled. After some of the men, having seen the massacre of the first wave, refuse to leave the trenches, Mireau and his ambitious colleague Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) order Dax to fire on the trenches. Dax unequivocally refuses. Why am I telling you all this? Because this is all the setup. The real bulk of the movie comes after the strike on the Ant Hill. This is not so much a war movie as it is a trial movie, and despite Kubrick's stunning depictions of the battle itself, what takes Paths of Glory out of the general category of the war movie and makes it transcendent is the trial. It's where all the suspense in the movie lies, and it's also the portion of the film that contains the performances that have made this movie a classic and gotten it on IMDB's list of the top 250 films of all time (as I write this, it's sitting at #43).

Trial flicks, or trial scenes in other flicks, are great places for top-notch actors to do their best work. Think about the trial scene at the climax of M, which turned Peter Lorre from a character actor into one of the greatest stars of the forties. For that matter, just tune into one of TNT's ubiquitous Law and Order marathons, where some of the best obscure actors of our generation have done some of their finest work. Never has that been truer than it is in Paths of Glory. Kirk Douglas ruled the silver-screen roost for a lot of years, to be sure, but you want to see his awe-inspiring acting chops distilled into one great speech? Rent Paths of Glory. And while Douglas was the obvious draw when the movie was released, a number of the supporting cast turn in performances as impressive, perhaps more so. The incredible Menjou (King of the Turf) is just the epitome of evil in this flick, but not in that superhero-movie type sense; this is the evil of bureaucracy, as it was personified in the Nuremberg Trials, so fresh in the memories of those who saw this movie when it came out in the late fifties--""I was just doing my job."" But in this case, there's no one around to call him to task. He's a tin-pot dictator who actually has the power to do what he wants, and revels in it, but he thinks he's constrained by procedure. It's a fascinating, complex character, and Menjou brings it to life. Contrast MacReady, who's just as ambitious, but has no pretension of constraint; he just doesn't care, thanks to his mental derangement. (I have a strong urge here to compare the two to Pinky and the Brain....) On the other side of the coin are Dax's three underlings who have been picked out as examples, all of whom are scripted differently, and all of whom are played by actors who are more than capable of bringing those differences out and working them over.

And yeah, as I mentioned way back at the beginning of this, one thing you certainly won't get from this movie, as you never do with Kubrick, is subtlety. As he does in so many films, Kubrick takes his anti-war message and batters you over the head with it, wanting to subdue you in the same way the Germans in the Ant Hill want to subdue their French assailants. While the pronounced lack of subtlety that was such a hallmark of Kubrick's works in some cases (in a heist flick like The Killing, subtlety would be about as appropriate as horns on a cow, or however that expression goes), it does mar some of the scenes in this film as we get closer to the climax. Every once in a very, very great while, however, an actor can overcome a script's lack of subtlety and work what would otherwise be a boring message speech into a work of art. (Witness Willem Dafoe's sermon on the mount in The Last Temptation of Christ, for example.) And to me, what propels this film from the ranks of the great into the ranks of the immortal is the way Kirk Douglas' speech does this. A lesser actor, it seems to me, could very easily have botched the material. I've no idea how many takes Douglas went through before getting it as good as it is (Kubrick being the notorious perfectionist that he was), but the take they finally settled on was perfect, and I am not using that word in any hyperbolic sense. As a trial speech, it ranks right up there with the Lorre scene from M I mentioned before, but where Lorre ensured his place in film history by completely losing his cool, Douglas ensures his with that quiet, deadly anger that telegraphs that if he could, he'd leap over the table and rip out the trbunal's throats with his bare hands--but he's considered the possibility and rejected it because he thinks this approach would be more effective. For lack of a better term, that's just awesome. It's one of those scenes that will stay with you for a long, long time after you've watched the film.

Absolutely stunning. A must-see movie, even if you're not a Kubrick fan. Take it from me, I should know. **** ",1243814400,2,6495,4.5187074829931975
152530,5,0792841409,"This is not only of Stanley Kubrick's greatest films, it's also one of the greatest war films ever made, still startlingly in its depiction of war and the stupidity of war.  Even though I have seen it numerous times, it still has the same impact as the first time.

The film was Kubrick's fourth feature (counting two independent films, neither of which were very good), but this was his 2nd ""professional"" picture, and he shows his mastery of the medium.  All the Kubrick trademarks are there.  Long, fluid tracking shots, bleak surroundings, memorable performances and dialogue, and a dark viewpoint of the folly of man.  The film was based on a real case in WWI whereas 3 French soldiers were executed for cowardice in a time of war.  The 3 soldiers were scapegoats for the fools running the war.  It's a true story, and the film was banned in France for many years because the soldiers were French.  The film could have been made about any group of soldiers, any country.  Eventually, the ban was lifted in 1974 (or around there).

The film is so tight and perfectly edited and shot that you couldn't cut a frame out of it without damaging its flow and substance.  It's a remarkable piece of work, especially for a young director, and it's a film with a grim, sad, depressing message about war.

Kirk Douglas gives a towering performance as Colonel Dax, the colonel who has to fight in a battle that he knows he'll lose, but he fights anyway.  He then tries to defend the three men who are eventually executed, but the trial is a kangaroo court, and the men's fate had been decided before the trial began.  All of the performances here are fabulous, especially Adolph Menjou (in one of his last films) as a general who orders the attack and the killing of the three soldiers.

If it wasn't for Kirk Douglas, this film would have never been made.  Kirk was a huge star at the time, and when Kubrick (and his producer James B. Harris) went to Douglas with the script, he famously said ""the film won't make a nickel.  But we have to make it."".  Douglas got the film made under his production company.  Douglas also kept the original ending of the script.  One day Kubrick wrote a new ending for the film, a happy ending where the 3 men are reprieved from their execution.  He showed it to Douglas, who was flabbergasted by this, and he asked Stanley why in God's name would he want to do this.  Kubrick replied ""to make it commercial.  I want to make money."".  Luckily, Douglas said no (he was, after all, the star and producer), and the film went on as originally scripted.  Granted, Kubrick was still young, and he was also living on loans from his partner Harris.  A little known fact about Kubrick is that he didn't make a dime from The Killing or Paths of Glory.  He worked on deferred salary until the films came into profit.  James B. Harris loaned him money to live on.  Kubrick may have been growing tired of this arrangement.  Regardless, the decision was Kirk's, and it was the best one.  Kirk also offered Kubrick the job to direct Spartacus.  Kubrick hadn't directed a film in nearly 3 years, and Kirk came to his rescue.  It was also a real paying gig.  Kubrick and Kirk had a falling out over Spartacus, but Douglas helped Kubrick a lot in his early career, and he deserves full credit for that.

Another point of debate about this film is the ending.  Some say it's a copout, and others say it's incredibly moving.  I go with the latter.  After the mock trial and real execution, the film goes to a pub where the soldiers are being entertained by a frightened singer (played by Susanne Christian, who went on to be the 3rd Mrs. Stanley Kubrick, and the woman he spent the rest of his life with).  The soldiers are screaming and hollering at her, scaring her even more.  When she finally starts singing, the men quiet down and are stunned by her beauty and her golden voice.  They start singing along with her, and most of them tear up as the song goes on.  It's arguably the most moving scene in any of Kubrick's work, one that makes me tear up as well.  Even though I've seen that scene over and over again, I am always moved by it.  It's one of the most touching, beautiful endings I've ever seen on a film.

Paths of Glory is a brilliant, complex film, one of Kubrick's greatest achievements, and one of the most shattering war films ever made.  Miss it at your peril.",1242518400,4,4388,4.469773299748111
152531,5,0792841409,"This is an amazing, classic war film taken from the French perspective.  As far as I am concerned this film easily rivals All Quiet on the Western Front in portraying a compelling portrait of the ""unseemly side of war"".  The movie begins by informing the viewer that we are seeing France in 1916.  By then, the landscape had been reduced to a pock-marked, naked battlefield, littered with wrecks, both human and machine.  The view then changes to an exterior shot of a beautiful European Chateau, where inside the French army officers are apparently living in luxury.  The Corps Commander, General Broulard, proposes a plan to take an impregnable position called Ant Hill.  The General easily manipulates division General Mireau, depicted as a scar faced evil looking man, into accepting his proposal.  Mireau is convinced that he will be considered for a promotion if successful and Ant Hill is taken.  ""Nothing is beyond those men once their fighting spirit is aroused"".
Mireau then goes to Colonel Dax, to inform him of the plan.  They meet at Dax's trench shelter for the meeting.  Mireau appeals to Dax's patriotism, but Dax is shocked and dazed, knowing that this attack would never succeed.  (What we the audience are witnessing is the effect of a bad plan moving its way down the ranks, finally ending up with the end user, the ones who will pay for its folly with their lives)  Of course Dax ultimately agrees.
An eerie night recon scene follows with three men moving trench to trench, guided by flares.  We stare at some tangled wreckage for a few moments before it is illuminated to become a crashed plane, bodies, and some kind of low bunker.  The flare's light makes for a very haunting and memorable scene.  The lieutenant then orders one of the men to take a closer look.  When he does not return quickly, the lieutenant, panics, throws a grenade in the direction of the wreck, and runs away.  We see that he has blown up his own man during his cowardly act of running away.  The third man makes it back to the trench where he encounters the lieutenant and says, ""You are a booze-guzzling, yellow-bellied rat with a bottle for a brain!""
The next scene takes place the following morning.  We see Dax striding confidently down the long trench.  His men are standing next to the walls with bayonets fixed in place, preparing to go over the wall.  The camera work is fantastic as it follows a grim faced Dax, walking unfazed as bombs and machine-gun fire go off all around him.  He reaches his position, a ladder, and amidst all the noise of the bombs and gun fire, blows a very weak sounding whistle.  I am sure it was the director's intention to have a barely audible and pathetic sounding whistle signal this fruitless attack.  The men follow Dax with a roar.
The attacking force is cut to shreds.  The men are stumbling over their fallen comrades only to be killed a few steps later.  Chaos rules and the men retreat.  One group never makes it out of the trenches due to heavy fire, this is seen by Mireau.  An enraged Mireau orders his battery commander to open fire on the French troops still in the trench.  Three times the battery commander refuses saying that he must have written proof of the order.  The commander is relived of duty and ordered to be under arrest for his failure to follow orders.
Dax runs back to the trench and finds the cowardly lieutenant and commands him to attack.  ""It's impossible sir, all the men are falling back"".  With that Dax climbs the ladder only to be hit by a dead soldier falling back into the trench.  An angry Mireau announces ""if those little sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll face French ones!""
Mireau calls for a court-martial and wants at least one hundred men to stand trial for ""cowardess in the face of the enemy"".  General Broulard finally haggles Mireau down to three men, selected by each company commander.  Mireau corners Dax on a stairway inside the Chateau and says, ""Broulard seemed to think you were funny.  I don't.  I'll break you; I'll ruin you, for showing such little loyalty to your commanding officer.""
Dax is selected to be the defense attorney for the selected men.  Dax meets the doomed men in prison and commands the men to ""act like what you are, soldiers!""
The trial is held in the Chateau without the slightest hint of justice.  Dax is incapable of even having the indictment read into the record, and further, no stenographer was present.  Each of the three soldiers is hammered by the prosecutor, and each time Dax defends the soldiers he is ignored.  The prosecutor sums up by saying that this ""attack was a stain on the flag of France.""  A clearly enraged Dax counters with, ""There are times when I am ashamed to be a member of the human race, and this is one such occasion!""  Still, ultimately, Dax is ignored.
The execution scene builds with a crescendo of uniformed men surrounding the gallows.  Three posts are standing vertically with three caskets visible nearby.  One of the men is unconscious, being carried on a stretcher, while another hangs whimperingly on a priest.  I hoped that Dax's last minute effort (with Broulard, to convince him to let the men off due to Mireau's order to open fire on his own troops) would pay off, but the end was inevitable.  The men are summarily shot.
The final scene will stay with me for a long time, I hope.  The war weary soldiers are in a nearby tavern, getting drunk following the execution.  Dax hears the men whistling lecherously inside and looks in the door to see a blonde German girl being paraded on stage.  The men are catcalling the innocent girl who is standing on the stage crying.  When encouraged to sing by the emcee, she begins in a frightened little voice, barely audible over the din.  The soldiers quiet a bit and begin to hear her sing.  The hooting soldiers are transformed back into men, some crying, some looking off into space, obviously thinking of home and family and not the war.  In a very humanizing way the film brings us back from this grotesque journey of inane battles, deaths, trials, and executions, and reveals that even in the face of ultimate depravity, we have a propensity for kindness.",1235347200,,6180,4.662661737523106

152533,5,0792841409,"This is an oft-times overlooked film in the Kubrick canon, and that's something that is unfortunate.  At the base, the story is a satire on injustice in the military / injustice in war.  It takes on a number of themes all at once, and does so gracefully without ending up looking like a rudderless plot.

Kirk Douglas plays a French colonel (Dax) in World War I.  He is one of the few officers in the film who has genuine integrity.  As such, he finds himself in conflict with the nefarious actions of his superior officers nearly as much as he is fighting with the Germans.  Douglas delivers a fabulous performance as an officer who is torn between duty and honor (always a dubious thing when these two traits clash).

Dax must cope with generals who who are perfectly content to send young men (by the thousands!) to their death in order to secure a promotion & add decorations to their dress uniform.  As such, they use their warfighters like pawns on a Chessboard with an utter dis-regard for the safety of the men under their command.

The film also details cowardice and brave men unjustly punished for it.  Even worse, using the Roman Legion model of decimation, the French army gives 3 men the facade a courts-martial where the outcome has already been decided.  The film is not short on the corruption of power!

This is a film that is as relevant today as it was 50 yrs ago, and is one that every general & admiral should watch - especially if they're on their way to a combat zone.  It is a sobering reminder of what happens when officers get too big for their britches.",1226966400,,1581,4.486013986013986
152534,5,0792841409,"I'm not a Stanley Kubrick fan, nor do I particularly care for Hollywood films.  So I was surprised and delighted to discover what a gem of a film ""Paths of Glory"" is.  Well directed, for the most part well acted, well directed, and conveying a great message:  what more could one ask for?

The title is ironic. The plot revolves around a failed because impossible military assault on the German trenches in 1916.  An oily, egoistic French general, superbly played by George Macready, orders the assault to further his career.  When it fails, he furiously orders three men from the decimated 701st Regiment that attempted the assault to be selected as examples, charged with cowardice, and court-martialed.  Their colonel, Dax, an attorney in peacetime, defends them, but the fix is already in.  The general staff won't take the blame for the disastrous assault.  So the dog soldiers must.  The three are executed, and Colonel Dax's native cynicism about martial ""paths of glory"" is only reinforced.  War is l'infamie.

In addition to Macready's great performance, Kirk Douglas outdoes himself as Dax, as does Adolphe Menjou as a general staff officer.  The battle scene in which the doomed 701 launches its hopeless assault is one of the most terrifying ones I've ever seen, totally outclassing Spielberg's opening scene in the overrated ""Saving Private Ryan.""

It took only a few minutes to get over the dissonance of an all-American cast playing French soldiers and officers.  Actually, I think the film's anti-war message was enhanced by getting it across in a ""foreign"" setting.

Dax is an French officer in the most pointless war, but most portentous war, of the Twentieth Century.  His men are ordered to take an impregnable German position.  Many men in the front ranks don't even get fully out of their trenches before they are slaughtered by an impenetrable hail of German lead and steel.  The surviving rear ranks cower in the trenches rather than face inevitable death.  The French General, who had pictured himself covered with medals, orders his artillery to shell his own lines.  The artillery officer refuses to take verbal orders and demands them in writing.  The General, who is more cowardly than the men he sent to death, refuses to put it in writing.

The General has a better idea--decimation.  It's an ancient Roman custom.  Should your army fail, execute every tenth man.  Col. Dax, at the risk of his life and own reputation, refuses to obey such an incredible order.  He can't, however, prevent it entirely.  Three men--men dripping with combat medals--are to be shot for cowardice.  Men who'd shown themselves to be heros in previous battles are shot as cowards.

Kirk Douglas is great.  His character literally seethes with indignation and anger.  The telling moment, however, comes at the end of the film.  A terrified but lovely German girl--a captive of the French--is forced to sing in front of leering, jeering French soldiers.  She sings a song of home.  The words are German but every man understands.  The ribald shouting dies down and rugged warriors openly weep.  They are all truly the same and they're murdering one another.  No one knows how to stop.

152546,3,0792841409,"Just now got to watching this oldie Pro-War movie of the 50s. It wasn't as good as I had heard, but the pro-war stance makes me want to go back to serve.  Kirk's colonel Dax makes all officers proud of wartime service. Enlisted soldiers all could do much worse than Dax. You can tell he cares so much for this men, that it almost physically hurts him to follow through with absurd orders from up top.  While this movie showcases the sometime ridiculous choices higher ups make in the name of wartime offense, it also more than makes up for it by making Dax the hero that populates the armoed forces.

This Pro-War movie of the 50s is labled as antiw-war, but there is no hiding the values and honorable service of the soldiers and officers portrayed in the movie. While it does give little screen time to the generals in the back, the real story highlightes the selfless, duty-bound service of the troops in the trenches. The 3 unlucky soldiers who get randomly picked to make up for the failed attack, are the usual sympathetic duty-bound conscripts of the time.  They all don't like being there, but they are because of their patriotism and love for their country. Even if this is France, that country can be pround it had people like Dax and the 3 who are eventually punished.  The pro-war aspect of this movie makes it all the more gung-hoie.  Duty, honor, and comraderie are the top themes highlighted in this feature.  I especially liked Dax's committment to his men and to the chain of command.  He does an excellent job of following the rules and still coming out on top and alive.  Overall, one of the greats of the PRO-WAR movie of the 50s.  Worth a look, at least once, to showcase patriotism and duty to country.",1214092800,,1724,4.514469453376206
152547,4,0792841409,"This is an absorbing anti-war movie about the French army on the Western Front in WWI.  There are moments of complete brilliance.  The shot of Kirk Douglas as the attacking French colonel walking the length of the trench before going ""over the top"" and the reactions of his regiment as he passes them is one of the best and most moving pieces of film making I've ever seen.  The firing squad scene and the bar scene at the end of the movie are also simply perfect.

Douglas is excellent in his role, as is the supporting cast.

I deduct one star for the lack of subtlety in portraying the French generals.  Yes, generals in WWI were out of touch and were even criminally negligent in their tactics.  But Kubrick does not attempt to portray the generals' point of view as having any legitimacy.

The film is shot in black & white, which captures the dirt and lack of romance of the battles fought at the time.

I highly recommend this great film.",1211500800,4,945,4.4476744186046515
152548,5,0792841409,"A film with a strong message requires a skillful presentation in order not to become overbearing. Paths of Glory, while having a strong anti-war theme, rises to the top due to the exceptional photography, editing, and straightforward narrative structure coupled with the tension that arises from social injustice and poor leadership. Kubrick treats the story as a parable, allow us to see a range of actions under a shared experience. We see front line solders at their best and worst and we also see the French officers under similar but a bit more sophisticated situations.

Paths of Glory is probably based on an event in World War I during the French Nivelle Offensive whereby the men on the front lines were pushed to remain on the offensive and overtake points of no strategic worth while losing considerable lives. The offensive objective here is tellingly called ""The Ant Hill"".  The men refused to attack but remained on the offensive in the trenches. The French officers fired thier artillery upon their own men. This incredible historic event lays the groundwork for this fictitious film.

Wisely the film narrows down the number of characters to basic types and individual concerns and conflicts. Thus we have careerist incompetent leadership negligently wasting the lives of their men on poorly developed plans and objectives. The film is tragic in that after the men refused to attack, men were selected at random to be executed for cowardice and executed before the troops as examples and to encourage more enthusiasm in the future.

Kirk Douglas plays the moral center for the film, playing Colonel Dax, a public prosecutor who joined the army. He defends the three men selected to represent the troops in a military judicial kangaroo court. Douglas is in top form and top shape. His performance is powerful and made more powerful by the subtle performances of his canny superior officers and the simple basic emotional responses of the men under his command.

Kubrick's film-making is superb and the careful photography of interiors reveals his early mastery of this art form. Kubrick recognized the ability of the context of action to cradle the narrative and give added dimension. Thus his shots of the trenches with long twisting tracking shots give one of the best impressions of World War I front line. The scenes of the court martial are high drama, revealing a stage with all the high drama of Greek tragedy. The execution scene is perfectly developed, revealing how the symetry of the troops in a geometric courtyard contrasts against the injustice that is about to occur. The scene of a captured German girl singing in a cafe is a bit overplayed but makes its point about the amazing manner in which men can be swayed from wrong to right and back again for in the end we are vastly limited.",1210982400,2,2816,4.92

Running a scant 86 minutes, the movie wastes no time in showing the exploitation of military ranks by the French General Staff to participate in a suicide mission on the western front. The objective is to take over ""Ant Hill"", a German stronghold of no strategic importance to the French except to the ambitious General Mireau, who is given the incentive of a promotion if the attack is successful. It's oblivious from the outset that the chances of success are practically nil since the men in the trenches are battered and weak from a number of successful advancements into enemy territory. The conscientious Colonel Dax is handed the responsibility of leading the men, but it turns completely fatal due initially to the blunder of one commanding officer's orders and the dominant German forces. Desperate to avoid humiliation, Mireau transfers blame for the failure to the soldiers and accuses them of cowardice.

If Mireau had his way, one hundred men would have been publicly executed, but he is ordered to identify three men to be to be executed exemplarily to satisfy the blood thirst of the military command. Dax defends the three men at the court-martial hearing but appears doomed to failure by a kangaroo court. The rest of the story plays out in aching detail until the shattering conclusion.

With his distinctive facial scar, George Macready plays the fanatical Mireau with uncompromising fury, while Adolphe Menjou, in one of the last roles of a long career, plays the blatantly immoral General Broulard with a slyly sinister panache.

152552,5,0792841409,"I just saw ""Paths of Glory"" for the first time. I was channel surfing and ran across it during the huge battle scene when the order was ultimately given that served as the basis for the movie. I never heard of this movie, but was drawn in by the fact that a young, Kirk Douglas was featured.

I began thinking that this movie's message was arguably just as powerful as ""Platoon"" or ""Saving Private Ryan."" As I watched, it reminded me of a verse in Pink Floyd's ""Us and Them"":

Forward he cried from the rear
  And the front rank died.
And the general sat and the lines on the map
  Moved from side to side.

I also drew a connection between this movie and contemporary, corporate culture. Rank and file workers treated as mere commodities and often aimlessly sacrificed as scapegoats for irrational, greedy and damaging decisions of upper management.

Lastly, this movie eloquently shows that no matter how absurd a charge is, the verdict is always in question. Even in matters of life and death... and how the pending deaths of others are perceived by those (mis)placed in command. Even 51 years later, this movie still makes very valid and timely statements.

Masterful directing and superb acting.  It's a movie that I want my children (18, 21 & 22) to view. I easily gave ""Paths of Glory"" 5 stars.",1209254400,,1301,4.593073593073593
152553,5,0792841409,"With one hundred and ten reviews posted at this time, there seems little else that can be said to shed new light on this classic antiwar movie. Yes Kubrick demonstrates, even at this early stage of his career his deft hand at detail and dramatic effect. And Kirk Douglas, perhaps the greatest living American film actor delivers a performance of unparaelled depth and intensity. Finally we have the superlative performances of veteran actors George McReady, Ralph Meeker and Adolf Menjou, each providing stalworth supporting roles.

But all of this has been exhustively chronicled by other Amazon reviewers. So what do I offer here that has not been said before? What startles me the most each time I view Paths Of Glory, (and I've watched it more than a dozen times) is the ending. We know that Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) is set on a collision course with General Mireau (George McReady). This has been orchestrated by Commander Broulard (Adolf Menjou) in the scene where he entices Dax to accept a promotion in order to initiate an inquiry of Marshall Mireau's decision to fire upon his own troops. This marks the climax of the hypocricy of war, as it is played out by the lofty Generals and their foot soliders, who are mere pawns in their unholy game of war.

However, the movie avoids this conforntation and abrumptly turns torward a much simplier, but more humane theme. Colonel Dax walks across a coutyard and hears the roar of soliders, amused and diverting their attention away from the trenches. They're enjoying a little RR at the local bistro. The MC is offering a rufugee fraulion to provide entertainment to the exhusted troops. Naturally she is greeted at first with jeers and ridicule. But as she sings her song the soliders slowly begin to respond with a rare display of emotion and humanity that is totally unexpected.

It is this final scene that I find the most intriguing and poinant moment in the entire film. Here are men who have suffered unbearable horrors by both the enemy and their own commanders. They have lost countless troops and whitnessed three of their own senselessly destroyed to justify the blunder of an ambitious General. Yet they still have the capacity to respond, when their emotions are touched by the sweet, young, innocent voice of the beautiful German girl forced to sing to the enemy.

I have seen this film countless times, and it has not only held up to time, but is as relevant today as it was when it was first released. There was a program called 'BATTLE CRY' when I was a kid, and I remember first seeing this on the television with my father. I had 7 great uncles who faught in France during WWI [one was KIA] and two of them died before I was old enough to talk to them about this war. The last surviving one, who was severly wounded at the Argonne Forest, died in 1996 [at the age of 98] This film reminds me of all of them. The story's narrative deals with military incompetence and the implications that are about to befall three men whose actions are deemed as cowardice in the face of the enemy.

General Mireau (George MacReady) is insistant that the latest failure of his troops to advance further into the German strongholds must be dealt with in a severe fashion. He wants men selected for summary execution for cowardice. MacReady does an excellent portrayal of the French General who cannot accept the reality that the war is a stalemate. Neither side can enroach on the other, and the casualties are horrendous. When Gen. Mireau demands that the 'Ant Hill' be taken [an important military objective] He is warned by Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) that it is impossible. Not willing to listen to reason, Gen. Mireau orders his troops to take the hill.

The hill is neither taken, nor is there any good news about the condition of the men on the mission. Many have been killed and wounded, and advancement is no longer a priority with the men, as they retreat back to their trenches. As a result, Gen. Mireau order executions of those who returned to the trenches. A problems exists however, as everyone [officers included] retreated due to the impossible conditions of the battle. When Colonel Dax is told that three men are to be selected for courts-martial, [and execution if found guilty] he decides to defend them. As council for defense he brings to light many inconsistencies and errors of judgment on the part of Gen. Mireau. This film is great.

In Kubrick's second major film, he demonstrates a profoundly keen sense of timing-----pausing here and there to great dramatic effect.

152588,5,0792841409,"A 29 year old Stanley Kubrick already renowned for his skillful directorial talent firmly cemented his reputation with the haunting wartime classic ""Paths of Glory"".  Kubrick adroitly depicted the abject dehumanization brought by war in this still important flick.  The film is set in 1916 France where German and French forces are stalemated in the ultimately fruitless butchery of trench warfare.

Kirk Douglas in one of his finest acting performances as sensitive and humane French Colonel Dax is in command of the 701st regiment.  In a decision propagated by French generals Broulard and Mireau played magnificently bt Adolphe Menjou and George Macready, the 70lst is ordered on a suicide attack on a highly fortified German position known as ""The Ant Hill"". While cozily nestled in a lavish chateau behind the front lines the generals in effect will insert some 8000 men, mired in muddy fortified trenches into a meat grinder of artillery and machine gun fire.

Led by Douglas in the attack into withering fire the offensive fails miserably as a large portion of the troops fail to leave the trenches and join the attack.  The incensed Macready observing the failure demands justice for the cowardice displayed by his troops.  To assuage his lofty ego he demands that 3 men from Douglas' regiment be court martialed for cowardice.

Douglas who in civilian life was an eminent criminal attorney, defends the men in a court martial empaneled to find them guilty.
Ironically three innocent men must stand charges to cover for the poor miltary planning of the general staff.

152589,3,0792841409,"The film opens on an army camp in 1916 France. It tells how trench warfare created a stalemate. Now there is a new plan to capture a German stronghold, but there is a problem. Colonel Dax inspects the soldiers and the trenches. A small group will reconnoiter the German lines at night. [We see problems in the command structure.] The next morning the attack begins over the top and across the shell holes. The rolling barrage advances. One company did not leave their trenches as ordered; General Mireau orders their position shelled! The attack fails, the troops fall back. General Mireau wants to shoot ten men from every company for their failure. Plea bargaining cuts the number down to three men. [Does shifting the blame to those who followed orders remind you of ""Dilbert Land""?] Do the actions of the General suggest senility or megalomania? Whatever the reason for the selection, the accused have no excuses.

The accused are questioned by the court, but can say nothing. The trial seems to be fixed to arrive at a foregone conclusion. Defense attorney Colonel Dax protests the failure to follow the rules. He pleads for mercy for the men. It is useless. A priest comes to console the men. We see the characters of the condemned. The Colonel learns that criticism of the General Staff and the Government may have created a need for an attack, even if hopeless. Even with the depositions of the Artillery Commander it has no effect. And so the events continue to its conclusion.

The top General dines with General Mireau, and tells of an inquiry into his actions (ordering the shelling of his troops). Colonel refuses a promotion to General. The ending shows the troops being entertained by a singer of a German sentimental song. Then they are ordered back to the front. This imagined story is dramatic, but implausible in parts. The offer of a promotion reminds me of Ibsen's ""An Enemy of the People"". Events are rigged for dramatic effect. But in a few short years we learn of the U-2 incident, where a pilot who follows orders gets blamed for being shot down! Life imitating art? Read a history book to get the real facts about the 1917 mutinies in France, or the 1918 mutinies in Germany that ended The Great War.

Not the least bit corny, this film has held up well over time. Several great performances punctuate the story of an officer who confronts his superiors when an unjust order provokes him. The contrast between the high command and the soldiers suffering in the trenches underscores the way that generals lost touch with the troops they were responsible for. Kirk Douglas is very strong in this and it may be one of his best performances.

152592,3,0792841409,"I really am not sure what I think of this movie. It's incalculably more subtle than the far more famous Dr Strangelove, but it still is over the edge in some ways. It's portrayal of the military is more than a bit jaded. Dax is the only man shown as a reasonable, unstereotyped man. All the others are various categories of caricature: drunks, errant cowards, sycophantic yes men, 'careerists', connivers and back stabbers.

On the flip side the movies cinematography and directing our truly outstanding. It's amazing that Kubrick was only about 28 when he made this movie with more deft directorial strokes than most directors manage when they are twice that age and have done a hundred films. The casting really is another high point on the film.

Filmed on glorious black and white, Kubrick's direction is absolutely brilliant as you would expect from the master, and on the other side of the camera, Douglas is equal to the task. The rest of the characters were brilliantly cast with each carefully crafted for impact. Atmosphere is second to none with Kubrick's pioneering use of the roaming camera during the quickly-paced trench walking scenes.....a groundbreaking moment in motion picture photography for its day and still looks fresh and clean. Paths of Glory takes a sobering look into the reality of a soldiers World War I army life, a forgoton Hollywood war with the exception of Sam Peckinpa's Cross of Iron.

152606,5,0792841409,"How well I remember the audience of 1958 sitting in stunned silence as the daring iconoclasm of the film washed over us like a bucket of cold water at a snoozer's convention. Post-war generations had seen nothing like its brutal honesty before. Instead, Hollywood had taught us that soldiers don't bawl like babies before being shot, that chaplains aren't part of a murderous war machine, that military justice really is about justice, and that generals however far removed are ultimately good and honorable men, (and that cameras always look away from execution scenes). Sure, the movie was not about our army, but the power of its message could not be missed, and no one from that era, having seen it, could again accept Hollywood's platitudes at face value.

Now, fifty years later, the film is still timely, having lost none of its power to illuminate. Thanks be to Kirk Douglas for taking a chance on an unproven Stanley Kubrick and getting Allied Artists to finance what was so clearly a non-commercial project. I suspect too, that it was at AA's insistance that Hollywood veterans be cast, even though the movie was shot to great advantage amidst the majestic settings of old Europe. Given the film's message, I think Kubrick would have preferred  no-name principals, but then, who could have surpassed the oily charm of Adolphe Menjou's diabolical general, or the pathetic repulsiveness of Timothy Carey's sacrificial dog-face. (It's ironic that the part of the cowardly lieutenant went to an authentic war-hero, naval air-ace Wayne Morris, then only two years away from an untimely death.) This many decades later, I still have mixed feelings about the celebrated final scene. On one hand, it's so clearly manipulative (someone once called it a ""male weepie""), that I try to steel myself against its undeniable force; on the other, it's so superbly well done that the humming chorus of universal brotherhood never fails to move me, even after this many viewings.

Researchers digging into origins of 60's counter-culture should check out themes and characterizations of the screen-play, particularly Timothy Carey's social outcast and Fred Bell's absolutely stunning thirty seconds of emotional break-down. For this is one of the few films from the conformist Eisenhower era to cast a shadow forward in time and serve as a reference point for future generations. The film's abundant cynicism may no longer be as revealing as it once was, thanks to Vietnam. Yet the emotional honesty remains as fresh and compelling as ever in its search for a gut-level depiction of real human anguish. Above all, Kubrick's anti-war classic points toward a more civilized potential amidst the barbarities and passions of combat, whether French or American, and given present political realities, still has many lessons to offer.",1119916800,10,2820,5.139433551198257
152607,5,0792841409,"When you are the one who gets to decide who lives and who dies, what are the criteria that the rest of us should buy into before giving our consent? If a general, or a CEO for that matter, asks the impossible, how far must men go in following their orders before disobedience is permissible? When is it ok for a cog in the machine to stop being a machine and start being a human being? This film suggests that the Ant Hill could only have been taken by live soldiers, and if all the soldiers were being slaughtered in the attempt to cross no mans land, the few survivors should naturally turn back, and live to fight another day. Under these circumstances, taking the Hill would have been impossible.

Ah, but that was an embarrasment for the general who ordered the attack. His judgement could not have been wrong, so, therefore, the men must be cowards. The role of Reason, the nature of absurdity, courage, and cowardice are all examined in this simple story, and the implication is clear that it is better to die bravely in front of a firing squad than to grow comfortable with mendacity and cower before the truth. The real cowards in the story were those who ordered these men to their deaths on the battlefield, because they were afraid to say no and risk their reputations for daring, and also those who ordered their deaths in front of a firing squad, and also those who concealed the truth out of fear of the consequences. Again, it is better to die bravely than live in cowardice. And the bravest of them all was the colonel played by Kirk Douglas, who fought for reason, justice, truth, and against the enemy on every side, even when the enemy was his superior officer. Yes, the enemy can be found in your own ranks, even among your commanding officers.

In the end they are all ordered back to the front. However, the next to the last scene in the cafe, is one of the most astonishing moments in cinematic history.

The soldiers, young and old, are making sport of a pretty young German girl who is being put forward by the proprietor for their entertainment. She has no talent, save for a little 'natural talent' he says, gesturing along the length of her body. ""She cannot dance, she cannot tell jokes, but she has a golden throat, she sings like a bird"", he tells them. They are laughing and taunting her, and she is nervous and intimidated, and begins to sing, haltingly, but plaintively, and one by one, the men grow silent. The camera moves from face to face, young, old, battle weary, her voice reminds them of all that is delicate and sweet, all that is not brutal and meaningless and horrible. And they all can remember a time, long ago, when they were not fighting and killing and struggling to keep alive, and slowly, one by one, they begin wiping away the tears, then picking up her melody and gradually joining in. Kirk Douglas peers in through the window when the sargeant comes up with their orders to return to the front. ""Give them a few more minutes,"" he says, and turns heel. It is a devastating moment. This is a film with a clear and powerful message. But it is not an anti-war movie. It is anti-mendacity, anti-authoritarian, and anti-injustice. The war setting is just a timless trope to carry the weight of these more significant issues.",1116979200,102,3274,4.527027027027027
152608,5,0792841409,"Anyone who has even cursorily studied Stanley Kubrick's career knows that he was one of the most powerful anti-war voices in the history of cinema. Although his total output was actually rather small, he produced three truly great anti-war classics: PATHS OF GLORY, DR. STRANGELOVE, and FULL METAL JACKET. But of these three, it was PATHS OF GLORY that most fully and vividly expressed the horror and stupidity of war. DR. STRANGELOVE distanced itself somewhat from its subject matter by its humor, while FULL METAL JACKET was emotionally detached from its characters. In most of his films, Kubrick preferred to be coolly disconnected, recording the events. But there is no detachment, no distancing of the camera from the action in this film. There is a visceral involvement at every point, whether following the French soldiers out of their trenches or detailing the steps taken by the French military to exonerate the officers by trying three random soldiers for treason or following the three soldiers through their final hours. This is a gut wrenching movie, and one can only watch it with a sense of horror at the multiple tragedies it depicts. So powerful, in fact, is the film that it was banned in several European nations following its release, including France and Spain, and way delayed in Germany out of fear that it would offend France.

But the true target of this film is not France or Germany or Spain or Britain or the United States, but any nation that would deliberately wage war. The theme is intended to be universal, not particular to one nation or one war, but any nation and all wars. Kubrick is criticizing upper class elites who send average men into battle to die for no good reason; aloof elites that value their own reputation more than human life; the fundamental stupidity of the entire enterprise of waging war and the military classes whose job it is to fight. The title of the novel was taken from Thomas Gray's """"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,"" the full line of which reads ""The paths of glory lead but to the grave."" But Kubrick is not merely saying that the problem with war is that the undeserving die: he is wanting to confront the entire war-making machine.

Few directors in the history of film have been so careful with detail as Kubrick, but rarely to so much effect in this one. There is an extraordinary richness to this film that comes out in nearly every aspect of it, from the vividly awful battlefields where the soldiers fight and die, to the sumptuous castles where the remote generals reside. Many scenes required dozens of retakes before they achieved the perfection that Kubrick demanded.

The virtually all-male cast-incredibly rare in the 1950s, where it was always imagined that romantic interests must be injected into every film-is exceptional, not just the major performers, but the group of familiar and unfamiliar supporting performers. This is probably my favorite Kirk Douglas film. In most of his roles he was asked to project brash cynicism, but here he is morally serious from beginning to end. He proves to be both the best intentioned and most nave individual in the film, striving desperately to see that justice is served, and only reluctantly realizing that the entire trial of the three token deserters is a sham and a joke. Ralph Meeker was a capable actor who rarely found roles equal to his talent, but here, in what was his finest role, he is splendid as the good soldier who is wrongly selected to stand trial for desertion. We feel his plight more than the other soldiers because we know him to be a good man dedicated to doing his duty. George Macready enjoyed a long screen career, but he had only a few truly great roles, the two best known being Rita Hayworth's husband in GILDA and in this film as General Mireau, the true villain in the failed battle and in the tragedy of trying the soldiers for cowardice. Adolph Menjou-who off screen was best known for being one of the best dressed men in the world and for his staunch anti-Communism and brutal verbal attacks on those he imagined to be too sympathetic to leftists (his political stance actually hurt his career-contrary to the understanding of many, attacks on supposed communists hurt the accusers as much as the accused, limiting the careers of folks like Menjou and Robert Taylor)-is exceptional as the smooth, plotting, incredibly cynical and self-preserving General Broulard. Macready and Menjou contrast marvelously in their coldness and cruelty with the humane compassion of Kirk Douglas's Col. Dax.

For many years PATHS OF GLORY was rarely shown even in the United States, in particular during the sixties and the Vietnamese War. In the decades that have followed, however, the film has rightfully gained a larger audience, and it is now acknowledge for the masterpiece that it is. In my own opinion, this is one of Kubrick's greatest films, the equal of such films as 2001 and DR. STRANGELOVE and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and better than any of his others. It is also arguably the most powerful expression of the idiocy of war in the history of cinema.",1116460800,5,5106,4.832
152609,5,0792841409,"It is very difficult to write about this film and fully do it justice. But I think that simplicity is its  greatest singular accomplishment,  while depicting military folly, ambition, politics,  courage and humanity. They couldn't be more effectively mixed together in this 1957 classic. All the actors gave top-notch performances, where the final soul-touching scene becomes one of cinema history's most moving and unforgettable moments.

Here, in his second feature film, the great director Stanley Kubrick begins a series of brilliant exploration of the dark side of human nature. Set in the trenches of 1916 France, Kirk Douglas as French Colonel Dax, has high principles in the world already gone mad. His unit is ordered to attack and take the heavily fortified Ant Hill by vainglorious Gen. Paul Mireau (George Macready). Col. Dax voices his disapproval of the mission but after being threatened with reassignment, decides to lead the charge himself. But as expected, the hill is very well defended and they come under murderous heavy fire. The situation becomes hopeless.

When they turn around, the crooked and glory-seeking  General, angered by his troops' unwillingness to sacrifice themselves, orders the French  artillery to fire upon them. When the artillery detachment refuses without a signed authorization from the general, the rest of the film shows military politics at work and reveals the evil and lack of remorse for human life for the sake of glory in the battlefield. The General is embarrassed and orders examples must be made in the form of three innocent French soldiers selected at random for a court martial for cowardice. They are sentenced to death by a kangaroo court.

The movie's pacing is more powerful and ironic than the preceding one, building to a shattering climax. Composer Gerald Fried created two main title themes for the movie. Most prints of the film features his arrangement of the French national anthem, ""Marseillaise,"" while another version opened with an original composition by Fried also. Subsequently, the title 'Paths of Glory' (taken from Thomas Grey's ""Elegy Written in a Country Church-Yard"") was created for select European markets since it might take offense at the anthem's use in a film so critical of France's military leadership during WWl.

Though the battlefield scene is in France, Kubrick chose to shoot the film in and around Munich, Germany. The attention to the meticulous composition of his shots reflects his background as a still photographer and foreshadows his other great films to come. Most interior scenes were filmed at Bavaria's Geiselgasteig Studios, and the court-martial scenes were shot in nearby Schleissheim Castle, an 18th-century structure serving then as a national museum. During WWII the factories near Schleissheim were hit by an air raid. Some bombs fell on the old castle during WWll, causing heavy damage. The ruins surrounding Col. Dax's headquarters were not studio sets since they were actual damage from WWll.

The film is not especially violent and blood splattered compared to the war movies of today, but it still could not diminish the stunningly surrealistic effect of a First World War battlefield night attack. And the complete absence of showing the Germans is thought provoking, since the  enemy is truly within!  It is said that over a ton of explosives were discharged in the first week of filming alone. Special effects director, Erwin Lange had to appear before a special German government commission to get permission for acquiring the huge number of explosives needed for the battle scenes.

Generally considered Director Stanley Kubrick's (""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Full Metal Jacket"")  best work, it does not only deliver a  powerful message, where it satirizes war and army politics, but also shows great insight into human nature. It was banned in France for its negative portrayal of the French army until 1975. In turn, the film was not allowed to be shown for a couple of years in Germany after its release...to avoid dislocating the still rickety relations with France. The third country to censor the film was Spain under Franco's dictatorship for its anti-military message. It was not released there until 1986, 11 years after Franco's death.

You may not like B&W films--but you must make an exception to this one. Astounding visuals from a variety of incisive angles are standard. The mobile wide-angle shots moving through the squalid  trenches as the battle begins (without cutting), the suspense and tension prior to a battle, up to the deadly oblivion of no-man's land are top-notch...not to mention the acting (Kubrick must have molded the actors into their roles). And see the final scene...perhaps the most  moving and unforgettable moment in cinema history! The only woman in the film, Christiane Kubrick, then Christiane Harlan, the director's future wife (they were married in 1958 and remained so until the director's death in 1999), as a captured German waif forced to sing in front of French troops. When she comes on stage, the soldiers begin to jeer and make charged statements that demean her nationality because she is German. She begins to sing a German song ""The Faithful Hussar"". Though the soldiers do not know German, they become emotionally touched and absorbed by the song, and overwhelmed by the melancholic and haunting beauty of the melody, they begin to hum along. They realized that humanity is not automatically, by default cruel and ruthless and corrupt all of the time. It is images like these that makes the many imperfections committed by Hollywood and the modern motion picture industry tolerable--even forgiveable.",1111276800,10,5671,5.199561403508772

152613,5,0792841409,"Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"" is the best war movie -- or, rather, the best anti-war movie -- ever made, and that includes ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and ""Grand Illusion"". Based on a novel by Humphey Cobb (which in turn was based on a real event), the story follows the fates of three French soldiers accused of cowardice in 1916. ""Paths of Glory"" was not exactly a box office smash when it was released in 1957; and evidently it completely puzzled the Academy -- though, strangely enough, an anti-war epic, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", was chosen 1957's Best Picture, but that fine film was in color and wide-screen. (I knew an ex-Marine who was horrified by ""Paths of Glory"", though he basked in the CinemaScope sentimentality of 1955's ""Battle Cry"".) Directed by Kubrick when he was only 28 from a screenplay written by himself, Jim Thompson, and the shamefully under-rated novelist Calder Willingham, the film's plot hinges on its first scene, a meeting between two French generals, expertly played by Adolphe Menjou and George Macready, the latter's facial scar emphasized by overhead lighting. Menjou has come to Macready to discuss the absolute importance of Macready's men capturing a strategic (and impregnable) German outpost -- mentioning, en passant, that Macready is up for a promotion, provided. Macready's character is one of those paragons of impatience who speaks of troops as though they were matriel. During the harrowing and unsuccessful attack on the enemy's bastion, he is so infuriated by the lack of advance he commands his battery to turn their guns on their own men, an astonishing order that plays an important part in the plot's outcome. Menjou's character is more mysterious: it's difficult to tell if he tempting people or testing them. The star of the movie is Kirk Douglas as the humane Colonel Dax, commander of the regiment ordered to take the ""ant hill"". It's a strong performance of restrained idealism; only near the end is Douglas allowed one of the big outbursts for which he was noted. It is he who must act as defense lawyer when Macready insists that three men of the Colonel's regiment -- one man from each battalion -- be placed before court martial, charged with cowardice in the face of the enemy. The three actors Ralph Meeker, Timothy Carey, and Joseph Turkel are excellent, playing three very different soldiers, all of them facing a French firing squad. The supporting cast includes Wayne Morris, who played College Joe types in the Thirties, giving a subtle portrayal of a weak alcoholic, and Richard Anderson, Mr Nice Guy at Metro, thoroughly unlikeable here as the court martial's prosecutor. ""Paths of Glory"" was photographed by George Krause with an eye for the atmosphere of the Great War; the only thing lacking is sepia. There's an exciting cut in the film's second half. Colonel Dax is in his quarters, tired and depressed, when a battery commander enters, saying he has information which may have a bearing on the court martial. Dax immediately perks up and says ""Come in"". Then the camera cuts, not to the commander but to a smiling, somewhat oily retainer crossing a ballroom floor to the strains of ""The Emperor Waltz"". It's a stunning depiction of the contrast between trench life and the luxury in the upper ranks on the Western Front. Nothing about ""Paths of Glory"" presents war as anything like la gloire idealized by the French, and the mood of the entire movie, including the climatic scene, is summed up in the title, when one realizes it is taken from a poem by Thomas Gray: ""The paths of glory lead but to the grave"".",1092700800,2,3603,4.860162601626016

152615,5,0792841409,"In 1916 France Commander Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) wants General Mireau (George Macready) to have his battered division take the ""Ant Hill"", an impregnable German fortress, promising Mireau a promotion and another story if he succeeds.  Mireau orders Dax (Kirk Douglas) to lead the charge, which is a complete failure.  When soldiers are pinned down by German artillery and machine gun fire Mireau orders his own artillery to fire on their own trenches, screaming, ""If those sweethearts won't face German bullets, they'll take French ones!""

""Paths of Glory"" has a deserved reputation as a great anti-war film but I think that director Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Humphrey Cobb's 1935 semi-fictional novel is a rather specific indictment of both a particular military and a particular war.  The suicidal attack in the first act of the film was loosely based upon the battle for Fort Douamont during the Battle of Verdun, where over 300,000 French soldiers lost their lives.  The assault, doomed to fail before it began, is ordered by French generals more concerned with prestige and promotions than the lives of their troops or the actual prospects for success.  In the wake of the disaster three men are selected to be tried and then executed for cowardice.  They are defended in court by their commander, Colonel Dax, the lone voice of reason speaking out against the insanity of what has happened.

This film was banned for almost twenty years in France and it is an indictment of the French military on a par with those films that have touched on the infamous Dreyfus case.  I have trouble extending this indictment beyond these French generals, not only because in cinematic history there is this sense of this being standard practice for the French military but also because hypocritically sending troops to such senseless death is rare in American military history.  John Bell Hood sending Confederate troops in a series of useless charges to teach them a lesson at the Battle of Franklin comes to mind, but I remember most American generals as taking blame and responsibility for such slaughters (e.g., Ambrose Burnside at Fredericksburg, Robert E. Lee after Pickett's Charge, Ulysses S. Grant with regard to the final assault at Cold Harbor).

But there is also a sense in which we identify this sort of waste of young soldiers with World War I.  In cinematic terms the obvious comparison is to ""Gallipoli,"" where British troops are having tea on the beaches while Australian troops are gunned down in a needless charge ordered by stubborn British generals (another category of military leaders easy treat with disdain given how they are portrayed in the movies).  The Civil War has provided amble evidence that troops charging entrenched or fortified positions was horribly futile and yet fifty years later European armies were still sending thousands of men against machine guns (the iconic weapon of the first World War).  As the opening narration explains, ""Successful attacks were measured in hundreds of yards - and paid for in lives by hundreds of thousands.""

The title of the book/film comes from a line in Thomas Gray's ""Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,"" where the poet writes, ""The paths of glory lead but to the grave.""  This might be an anti-war film but it still shows the heroism of the troops as Kubrick uses a tracking shot to follow the Dax and his soldiers across No Man's Land against the German fort.  After all, these men are fighting an army that has invaded their country, so there is a sense in which the title is inappropriate simply because these men are not involved in a quest for glory.

The film was shot in Germany and cinematographer Georg Krause provides one of the sharpest black & white films you have ever seen.  The clarity is almost daunting and it is impossible not to think that it is not but another part of Kubrick's grand design.  As for the performance by Douglas I would agree with the general consensus that this is his finest performance, even over what he would provide for Kubrick three years later in ""Spartacus.""

In the end Kubrick makes a final argument for the universality of human experience when a German singer (Susanne Christian, who was Christiane Kubrick wife of the director) is forced to sing a song for the French troops whose jeers turn to tears.  There are, relatively speaking compared to other wars, relatively few films about the First World War.  But it is rather impressive when you start listing the ones that immediately come to mind (""Wings,"" ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" ""Sgt. York,"" ""Gallipoli"") how good they tend to be and how many of them are, at their essence, anti-war films.  For that, I think the credit for linking that particular war with the idea of the futility of war clearly belongs to Erich Maria Remarque, author of ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""",1088726400,154,4865,4.904878048780488
152626,4,0792841409,"First of all I want to say that I enjoyed this film completely.  The problem is I enjoyed the film mostly because I agreed with it and not because it was necessarily an amazing film.  I'll try to make that more clear.  Films often times have a political or personal message to its audience.  I have no problem with this, but I believe a great and successful film is one that leaves a certain ambiguity to its premise.  I love a film that allows me to make my own views and provides for an arena of open dialogue.  This film is heavy handed.  The good guys are good and always good, the bad guys are bad and always bad.  War is always bad and the military is always evil.  The problem is life, and nothing in it, is ever that simple.  It would have been better for the audience to be allowed their own thoughts.  The truth is I have strong feelings against warfare and have yet to study about a single war that was necessary.  Certainly the war presented here, World War I, could have been avoided.  Yet that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone who was responsible for it was a cold hearted sadist twisting their mustache hair hatching a plan to end the world.  That I am against war is why I liked it, but I did not like it in terms of aesthetic criteria, complicated story lines and deep layered characters.  These elements were lacking because Kubrick was too focussed on making a message.  Unfortunately the only ones who will accept this message are ones who already believe in it.  In terms of anti-war, Full Metal Jacket is a far superior and more mature film because it presented itself simply and let the audience come up with their own opinions.  Paths of Glory straight up tells you want to think and how to think about it.  What dissapoints me about this, is that this type of heavy handed style is common in Speilberg, a director I loathe.  To see it in Kubrick makes me wish desperately that he would have done something else with this film.  It is much easier to see why this narrative is flawed when you watch a film that you disagree with.  I think of the film Just Cause.  It's a movie that not only supports capital punishment but also police brutality and reinforces stereotypes of the black criminal.  I couldn't have hated it more, mostly because of its heavy handed nature.  It's just better to let the audience make up their minds rather than handing them their opinions with overly melodramtic scenes and drastically exaggerated story lines.  A director should never have the message and theme of the movie in mind when he or she sets out to make it. Motifs and ideologies emerge from a piece naturally through the course of its creation.  I can't give it five stars because it only ammounts to preaching to the choir, but I give it four because after all I am in the choir.",1083456000,4,2801,4.4411764705882355
152627,5,0792841409,"Two years into the First World War close to the French-German front in a well-kept chteau used as head quarters, General Paul Mireau (George Macready) receives an order to attack the Ant Hill at all costs.  At first General Mireau resists the order as he knows it will costs a large amount of lives, but he gives in as General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) gives him a choice of dishonorably accepting another post together with one more star.  General Mireau visits the front where he informs Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) about the upcoming assault.  General Mireau puts Colonel Dax under a similar stressful situation as he was put in the previous evening.  Consequently, Dax confirms that he is ready for the assault, which ends up in a suicidal massacre.  However, General Mireau views the failure as an result of cowardly behavior and wants to set an example by executing a few chosen men from the battalion.

Paths of Glory is an anti-war film that depicts a cold atmosphere experienced by men at war where officers are deciding the value of life and emotion is deemed as weakness.  The officers arrogant and neglectful attitude stands out in several scenes throughout the film.  For example, the initial scene where two Generals enter a magnificent room one of the General displays his preoccupation with self-importance and pride while men are dying on the front.  Another example is how the officers address the death of a few men by saying, ""They died well."", which displays their own arrogant beliefs.  Overall, Paths of Glory is a brilliantly directed film as it presents logical reasoning supported with strong visual examples that are enhanced by great performances from the cast.",1083024000,2,1688,4.953900709219858
152628,5,0792841409,"I saw this film in a college course on film and I realize why.  It is one of the best directed films ever made.  The black and white works to perfection.
This is my favorite Kirk Douglas film about the French military during WWI.  A group of French soldiers are sent on an impossible mission.  When they obviously fail, the General afraid of losing face for a stupid decision, decides to court martial some of the soldiers as a punishment.  Three soldiers are singled out.  One obviously fought very bravely and another was hit on the head and knocked unconcious during the battle.  Their stories are futile against the kangaroo French military court.  Douglas tries valiently to act as their legal council and present their defense in vain.
From what I understand this film is still banned in France!  I guess the humiliating loss during WWII did nothing to sway the French military from its self-conceived notion of being a great military power!",1077148800,,947,4.7607361963190185
152629,5,0792841409,"Is this Stanley Kubrick's best film? Absolutely.
This director has some good and some bad films. He also has some very poor ones and some really great ones. He is overrated as a whole, but if you can find his better films then they certainly do stand out among the rest for their respective genres. Here he is the Lord of filmmakers. There is no question that this film has everything that makes the director's status as the cream of the crop.
This film was made in 1957, but just might as well have been made in 2004. The acting mostly resembles that clich 1950s type acting where the actors are somewhat aware of the camera but that does not matter and after ten minutes this common acting production problem is certainly consumed by the weight of the plot, technical direction and the outstanding performances of all concerned. When the camera does those long and timeless tracking shots down the trenches you can only be mesmerized by the sheer boldness of its originality and massive undertaking.
This is the film that launched Kubrick's career and put him on the Path of Grandeur. This is akin to saying that it is Stephen Speilberg's Jaws, Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, James Cameron's The Terminator or Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. It defined the director and is THAT important on his list of films that you should see. Sadly this film by Kubrick has been eclipsed by ""Spartacus"" because it was made three years before that film with the exact same star. Unfortunately this means that whenever we hear the words ""Kubrick"" and ""Douglas"" together we think of Rome and Gladiators. In truth we should be thinking France and World War I.
Based on the book by Humphrey Cobb this is part war film / part military courtroom drama. It is about the wastes of war as a somewhat young lawyer (Douglas) plays the French Colonel Dax who is on the Western Front with his army. Most of the very realistic war scenes take place in the trenches and some on the battle field. Colonel Dax is ordered to capture the German enemy who are awaiting them on the other side with more firepower than they can handle. Under intense and often stupid political orders Colonel Dax is in a crises of his command. On one hand he must show his strength as a leader to his seniors and on the other he must defend his troops from the exploitation of absolute corrupt bureaucracy. This same theme was played out in the more recent movie ""The Thin Red Line"". The later part of this film is about soldiers who are made whipping boys for the legion's failures and losses. The Colonel, as a lawyer (and their battlefield leader), acts as representation for these men. The film poses many questions and answers important issue that are very relevant for our time.
*As a note Kubrick's wife, up until his death, is the woman singing at the end of this film. The film was also banned in France for its portrayal of the French army.*
This is simply one of the best war dramas you will ever likely see, not to mention one of the best courtroom dramas too. Both worlds melt perfectly together as one in this great, provocative, cerebral and touching motion picture film. Vote no one into government who has not seen this film, period. It should be mandatory viewing for all political science professionals and is certainly the most important dissertation about conflict since Sun-Tzu's ""The Art of War"".

152631,5,0792841409,"According to Roger Ebert, French New-Waver Francois Truffaut said it was hard to make an antiwar film because war was exciting even if you were against it. That's why ""Paths of Glory"" isn't an antiwar movie.
Yet, it IS a masterful work. Why? Kubrick has been criticized for not being an ""actor's director"", that he was more concerned with composition and lighting than performance. Here, we benefit from early Kubrick, (before he became STANLEY KUBRICK) when perhaps inexperience and youth permitted the actors to bring their own artistry to his film. Because this film is ultimately about the people, not the warfare.
Here Kubrick shows us what happens when people collide in such violent, chaotic and absurd circumstances, when one man's reach for glory becomes other men's destruction, when honor and duty fail to bring an iota of good to the world. Despite all of that, the characters remain very human, sins and all.
Warfare is not a ""thing"", it's a collection of individual actions, the sum of which almost always is bleak, painful and unjust, made all the more horrible when we remember that all glory is fleeting.",1068508800,,1121,4.936507936507937
152632,5,0792841409,"Behind French lines in World War I, army generals are dissatisfied with their soldiers' lack of progress.  The vain, scar-faced General Mireau (George Macready) is tempted with a promotion and taunted into ordering his men into a suicidal attack on a small German outpost, said to be of great significance to the war effort.  Mireau in turn bullies his honorable lawyer-turned-corporal, Dax (Kirk Douglas) into carrying out the objective, even though the estimated casualties will be 65% of the regiment.  Due to heavy German artillery, but more importantly, to poor communications behind their own lines, the objective is not taken.  A furious Mireau wants 100 soldiers court-martialed,  executed for cowardice.  Dax bargains him down to three, and is confident that his criminal-defense prowess will save even those men.  But what can he do, when the court-martial is a sham, without even a stenographer present?
Although dated from a technical standpoint, ""Paths of Glory"" is still a film of exceptional power.  The final hour of the movie is staged like a play: characters conceived well before the ironic-small-talk revolution of the late 20th century speak to each other in weighty, dramatic soliloquies.  But before that, there's a tightly-photographed, cacophonous fight sequence, masterfully set up by Kubrick and rivalling the authenticity of the opening reel of ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Kubrick's film cameras prowl the trenches until you feel the claustrophobia.
The script doesn't have a single ounce of fat.  Even though it's a war film set in the trenches, we don't see a single German combatant.  Dax's regiment has more than just the German army to contend with, you see.  The names are all significant: the first soldier killed in combat is named Lejeune, and the innocent corporal court-martialed to satisfy Mireau's bloodlust is named Paris.  The objective for which the regiment must sustain 65% casualties is nothing less monumental than ""the Ant Hill"".  And when the film's lone German finally appears, the French soldiers are, to a man, moved to tears.
87 minutes in length, ""Paths of Glory"" is half the size of ""Pearl Harbor"".  There is something to be learned from that.  Unfortunately, the DVD is just 25% the size of the ""Pearl Harbor"" box set.  The only extra feature here is the original trailer.  There is a ""4-page booklet"" accompanying the disc, but only two of those pages contain trivia.  At least one of the facts in the booklet is clearly wrong, informing us that Wayne Morris's character is ""killed early in the film"".  This is not so.",1065225600,,2572,5.090692124105012

It becomes clear that these guys never did anything expect do their jobs.  They do have one last chance and if they lose a death sentence awaits them.
My Impression-I liked this movie a great deal.  It remined me of an Australian movie ""Breaker Morant"".  That movie like this one really makes you think about both the hypocrisy of those in charge and the total callousness of the system.
I mean is it worth playing with the lives of three people just to prove a point?
Is it wrong for the guys at the top to even contemplate an attack even when they know that the attack has no chance of working in the first place?
How do you deal with death even when you don't deserve it?

152634,5,0792841409,"Kirk Douglas argued long and hard to get this film made.  The studio felt it would not be profitable and it was not, but in retrospect, it turned out to be one of Douglas's finest performances and one of Stanley Kubrick's greatest achievements.  This film was made almost fifty years ago, but time has not diminished its power and relevance.  It is a classic!
Kirk Douglas plays the role of Colonel Dax, a French regimental commander in World War I who is given a suicide mission to attack a German position, ""the Ant Hill.""  The attack is a failure and a fiasco, with many soldiers losing their lives senselessly.  The attack had no chance of success.  Even so, the high command orders that three men from the regiment be selected by their officers and tried for cowardice in the face of the enemy.  Dax is to be the officer who defends them.
The trial is a sham and Dax, a brilliant lawyer, realizes that he has little chance of saving the lives of his men.  Even so, he perseveres and demonstrates the absurdity of the trial and the criminal intent of the French high command.  The men are condemned to death by firing squad.  None of this will come as any surprise to the viewer, who early on realizes the stupidity, ineptness, and evil intentions of the high command.
For the high command war (and the lives of the ordinary soldiers who must participate in its ultimate absurdity) is a game and the business of the generals is to get good press and enhance their reputations.  Colonel Dax stands for all good people of courage and conviction who speak out at risk to themselves against lies and criminal behavior.  Unflinchingly, he confronts Adolph Menjou, the commanding general, listens to his nonsense, and condemns him for the misguided fool that he is.  All to no avail.  The order stands and the condemned men die on public display for the troops and general staff to witness.
If the movie ended with the executions, it would stand as one of the darkest portraits of fallen human nature yet filmed.  But one final scene remains.  Dax goes back to his headquarters after the executions and on the way he observes his men in a tavern shouting derisively at a young German woman who stands on stage as an object of ridicule and scorn.  Then she starts to sing and her song transfixes and then transforms the men who begin to accompany her as she sings.  Her song moves them to tears.  Kubrick shows us that common soldiers are not animals whose lives are expendable, but human beings who are debased by war and uplifted by simple acts of human dignity and kindness.  This final scene is one of the unforgettable moments in the history of cinema.  Few viewers will ever forget it.",1062028800,9,2688,4.581589958158996

The impactful moments of treachery and defence of justice in the face of tyranny were more genuinely human than the more typical emotional distancing of Kubricks more celebrated works. Kirk Douglas turns in one of his strongest performances as the tough and gutsy commander Dax who knows as much at how to make an impact in a military board meeting as on the battlefield. He is the voice of compassion and reason in what is a very dark and cynical film about the politics of war. Some of the posturing of the evil French officials might seem over the top and cartoonish, but it works somehow because of the odd interplay of politeness mixed with the cavalier willingness to trade outrageously on human lives to score morale points with the men.",1061078400,,847,4.6158940397351
152646,5,0792841409,"It has been almost 50 years since this anti-war film appeared, one which was banned in France until 1970. It is based on Humphrey Cobb's novel. Directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Kirk Douglas who also produced it, the film examines a fictional (but nonetheless wholly believable) situation during World War One when French troops are ordered to achieve an impossible military objective: Climb and secure the ""Ant Hill,"" a heavily-fortified German position. Of course the troops are decimated. Whom to blame? General Broulard (Adolph Menjou) who gave the order? The troops' general, General Mireau (George MacReady), whose career ambitions overcame his doubts about the order? The officer (Colonel Dax) who led the attack? General Broulard gives a second order: Select three of the survivors, charge them with cowardice, give them a perfunctory military trial, and then execute them. Their commanding officer is Colonel Dax (Douglas) who had been an attorney in civilian life. He is ordered to be the defense counsel. After the inevitable verdict, the three representatives are executed by a firing squad.

Kubrick presents all this on film as if it were a documentary of actual events. Appropriately, he filmed it in black-and-white, in part to dramatize the obvious juxtapositions of right and wrong, good and evil, justice and injustice, etc. The battlefield carnage is extensive but not gratuitous. For me, the insensitivity, indeed inhumanity of the two generals -- far removed from combat in luxurious comfort -- is far more upsetting than the assault on the ""Ant Hill."" The men who followed orders and lost their lives or their limbs may have died in vain but at least died with honor, if not glory. Kubrick leaves absolutely no doubt about the generals who sent them into battle. Colonel Dax understands the need for military discipline. Orders must be followed. He eventually realizes that no matter how logical and eloquent his defense, the three men are doomed as were so many of their comrades were while climbing the ""Ant Hill."" Dax also realizes Broulard and Mireau will never be held accountable for the order nor for denying any responsibility for its tragic consequences. Dante reserved the worst ring in hell for those who, in a moral crisis, preserved their neutrality. Kubrick ensures that Menju and MacReady portray Broulard and Mireau not as neutral accomplices but as agents of evil: a more dangerous adversary than the one their troops face in battle.

With regard to Dax, he did everything he could to save the three men. He leaves absolutely no doubt in the minds of Generals Broulard and Mireau what he thinks of them, both as officers and as human beings. However, they are his military superiors and the war continues after the executions. I mention all this by way of suggesting a context for my opinion that the final scene in the cafe has a very important purpose: to communicate Kubrick's reassurance to those who see his film that even amidst war's death and mutilation, the very best of human instincts somehow prevail. They cannot be defeated by the ""Ant Hill,"" nor by Broulard and Mireau and their obscene abuse of military justice. In my opinion, that is what Dax realizes in the cafe as he and other soldiers listen to a terrified girl sing. And that is the final ""message"" which Kubrick seems determined to leave with his audience.",1057017600,54,3376,4.994671403197158

Would American fighting men have put up with this behavior?  I don't think so today, and this movie helps to educate why soldiers should not blindly follow orders.

152649,4,0792841409,"Pretty good film with excellent scenes and photography, great acting, and great drama.

I hope this film is used as an entertaining instructional film for officer candidates.  It's great at showing the hypocrisy, egotism, and unchecked evil that can seep into a unit's leadership when the wrong personalities are present.

This was based on a work of fiction, but truth is stranger than fiction, so I'm certain situations like the one this film is about have occured at some point, or some side or another, in the Great War.

I don't get why everyone says it's an anti-war movie.  There were no pacifist speeches or overt debates about the morals of fighting.  Instead, it just focused on a massive abortion of justice and the terrible leaders the men of the 701st regiment had.

In any army, or unit, be it a corporation or a rifle company, there are always going to be 'stupid' orders the grunts have to follow.  But men will instinctively know when something is total BS or not, but morale and leadership have to be pretty damn low for guys to outright refuse orders, which, by the way, none of the guys in the trial did.

When troops refuse orders en masse, it's usually not because they're cowards, but they lack the proper leadership.  That was apparent in this movie, when the general orders a single battle-weary, understrength regiment to take an entire hill in broad daylight without sufficient artillery prep, reinforcements, or even a smoke screen to hide their approach along a clear field of fire for dozens of Boche machine guns.  Hell, these guys wanted to fight the war, but no one wants to die for no reason at all.  If you're sitting in a trench and you know that an advance is completely futile, why would you use yourself as target practice for the enemy machine gunners?

In any case, the French generals were a little bit over the top.  Other than that, it was a good idea to just speak English without attempting a silly French accent.  Also, the lack of blood and guts ala some modern war movies allowed one to concentrate on the drama of the story.  All around a decent 4-star movie.

152651,5,0792841409,"If it were made today, ""Paths of Glory"" would be a two-and-a-half hour long epic, loaded with self-importance and chest thumping.  It would contain scene after scene of Oscar-baiting speeches performed by American actors with phony French accents, a soaring Hans Zimmer (or, most likely, John Williams) score meant to tug at the heartstrings, and more splattered blood than vampire's day at the Red Cross.  But it wasn't made today.  It was made in 1957.  And not by some Hollywood hack, looking forward to awards season.  But by Stanley Kubrick, a young director ready to burst through the doors of cinema history.  ""Paths of Glory"" announces his presence, and oh what a wonderful noise it does make.
The film is set in France, 1916.  World War I is in full swing, and the French front is stabilized.  Trench warfare is prevalent, and though battle lines changed very little, the casualties used to make those changes are astronomical.  General Mireau, a seemingly pragmatic man at the film's onset, is given an important task by General Broulard: take 'The Anthill"", a highly important strategic position, currently in the hands of the Germans.  Mireau knows it can't be done, for his troops' numbers are already depleted, but the promise of an extra star on his chest sways him.  It is this moment that typifies the themes of the film: the glory of one is put ahead of the safety of many.
This opening scene between Mireau and Broulard establishes Kubrick's camera work from the get-go.  It moves fluidly around the room, following the two men in conversation while capturing the posh luxury they live in.  The camera appears to be doing figure eights.  This highly stylized movement is maintained throughout the rest of the film.  Most notable in this regard are the trench scenes.  A series of long tracking shots, single takes all, establish the size and terror to be found in the trenches.  It helps contrast the conditions in the trenches with the ornateness of the general's quarters, allowing the audience to almost understand why Mireau would do anything to maintain his position.
Kubrick's camera is on fire here, giving a stylized but relevant look to the film's court martial scene.  It circles endlessly around the judges, the prosecution, the defense, and the accused, unifying them all in the grand room bathed in soft sunlight (the whole film is a textbook example of how light -- and shadow -- should be used to set the mood of a scene).
Kirk Douglas, whose star-wattage helped Kubrick and Co. get the film made, is an imposing presence.  Besides the fact that his pompadour never looks ruffled, even during the battle scenes, Douglas' Colonel Dax has credibility and power to spare.  Once the ""foremost criminal lawyer in all of France"", Dax leads the platoon charged with the impossible mission.  Although he sees the folly in it, he's enough of an army man to not go against orders.  But he does make his views known.  A liberal pragmatist, Dax is sharp of tongue and doesn't suffer fools gladly, enough so that when Mireau gives the order, Dax can't help quoting Samuel Johnson under his breath: ""Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel"".  Douglas plays all sides of the man with skill and grace.  He's at his best during the court marshal scene, where his anger nearly overtakes him, and his passion is palpable.
The supporting cast is, for the most part, fairly good, led by the three actors who played the condemned men.  Timothy Carey previously worked with Kubrick in ""The Killing"".  Carey is a weird on-screen presence, not much of an actor, but he's perfect for the nervous ""social undesirable"" that is Private Ferol.  Joe Turkel, who would later play the bartender in ""The Shining"", looks tiny and unintimidating.  But his small role as Private Arnaud calls for him to show a cool demeanor and then wield terrible anger.  Turkel does well on both counts.  Ralph Meeker is probably the soul of the film, as the doomed Corporal Paris.  A man of principle and character, Paris is caught in a tough situation when a commanding officer, a former schoolmate who he doesn't respect in the slightest, bribes him into compliance with a cover-up scandal.  Paris is the kind of soldier every army would die for, if said army wasn't awash in self-serving egotism.  Meeker plays this dignified man perfectly.
There are some dubious performances here, most notably by George Macready and Wayne Morris.  Macready, as Colonel Mireau, is little more than a cardboard villain.  A crowded theatre would boo and hiss every time he comes on screen, his villainy is so one-sided.  Macready is probably to blame, playing every scene with over-the-top hamminess.  Morris, a real life war hero, is cast against type as the drunken buffoon, Lieutenant Roget.  Although his amateurness works well in some scenes, it undermines the character in others.  How could a man this foolhardy ever rise to such a position?  We never see Roget as anything less than incompetent, and it hurts his credibility.  Still, these minor quibbles don't tarnish the fine work of the entire cast.
""Paths of Glory"" can be a frustrating film to watch, especially for those aghast at inequities caused by hubris and the hunt for glory.  The court marshal scene, in which Douglas' Dax is set back at every turn, had me nearly screaming at my TV, as it became apparent that the officers were fully prepared to be selfish, and ruin the lives of a few innocent men.  ""There are few things more fundamentally encouraging and stimulating than seeing someone else die,"" says General Broulard at one point, with a beatific smile on his face.  He thinks that his addressee, a subordinate, will accept his words as stated.  Thankfully Colonel Dax, and Kubrick's remarkably compact film (running a taut 84 minutes), doesn't.",1027382400,18,5800,4.878447395301328
152652,5,0792841409,"Stanley Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY is one of the most gripping war movies ever filmed.  Its power does nor come from an impressive body count.  THE LONGEST DAY and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN have higher counts but what makes this movie so special is the battle that goes on in the courtroom.  Kirk Douglas plays Colonel Dax of the French army, a man of bravery and impeccable integrity.  When he is given an order to attack, he will obey it since he assumes that the order is a rational one that fits into the larger scheme of winning a battle.  His commanding officer, played with sublime officiousness by Adolphe Menjou, orders a suicide attack on a heavily defended German position with predictable results.  Dax's men are beaten back with ruinous losses.  The general seeks a scapegoat for the defeat since if he has none, then he must shoulder responsibility.  He chooses to blame his regiment for cowardice, and randomly chooses three soldiers for a courts-martial.  It is Dax's job to defend them.  It is during the trial that Kubrick raises some tough questions about the morality of war and the need to obey all orders, regardless of their surface illogic.  Despite a solid defense, Dax realizes that the verdict was in even before the trial began, and the three unlucky soldiers are shot by firing squad.  As Dax grows to understand the nature of the beast called war, so does the audience.  In war, top commanders often regard their armies of men as little more than chess pieces, to be placed here and there on whim.  Losses are expected and uncried over.  Dax shakes up the entire French High Command by demanding that someone in a high place owes it to the dead to cry over them, even if he is the only one willing to do so.  Whatever illusions about fair play in military justice that remain after the guilty verdict is in vanish when he speaks to the commander of the general who ordered the attack in the first place.  This general tells Dax that the offending general has been relieved of command.  However, he also tells Dax that despite knowing the idiocy of the attacking order and the equal idiocy of demanding the guilty verdict, he still insists that it was more important to safeguard the holiness of obedience to orders than to safeguard the well-being of the men attempting to carry out those orders.  It is this closing scene of disillusionment that teaches Dax that though war may be inherently chaotic, human beings must not be so.  The events of the war following this war teach us that some lessons humanity will probably never learn.",1025568000,20,2557,4.665178571428571
152653,5,0792841409,"Kubrick was always criticized for being a 'cold' director, but if one examines his films closely, they will realize he had more heart than his reputation.  'Paths of Glory' is probably the best war movie ever made. The story is about an crazed general who wants his soldiers to conquer and anthill. The mission is ridiculous and the soldiers know it. Nontheless, they proceed and it is disasterous. Three soldiers are going to be executed for ""cowardice"" on the battlefield. Kirk Douglas' mission is to stop the execution. Kubrick makes some strong points about the stupidity and absurdities of war and the people who govern them. No doubt, it is one of the best war films ever made.",1024358400,,683,4.788135593220339
152654,5,0792841409,"One of Stanley Kubrick's earliest films, and one of his finest, ""Paths of Glory"" stars Kirk Douglas as a French colonel who must defend three soldiers against trumped-up charges of cowardice.  Within that simple framework, and with an amazingly short running time (just under 90 minutes), Kubrick and company create a powerful, universal story about the abuse of power, the horrors of war and the indomitability of the human spirit, and its possible redemption.

""Paths"" draws a lot of its power from some amazing, naturalistic performances by its supporting cast.  Ralph Meeker, Joseph Turkel and the hulking Timothy Carey (one weird-looking guy) portray the accused, three very different men with sharply delineated reactions to their shared predicament.  Their final scenes have the feel of a Arthur Miller play, tragic and vital.  Wayne Morris, himself a real-life war hero, is exceptional as a cowardly officer.  George Macready ably limns a self-righteous general, with support from film legend Adolphe Menjou as his wily superior.  And star Kirk Douglas delivers one of his typically impassioned performances; few have ever matched his ability to dynamically combine physicality and intellect with strong idealism.

Some criticize Kubrick for giving into sentimentality during the scene in which French soldiers torment a captured German girl, then hum along with her as she sings, while Douglas' character listens and draws strength.  I would argue that this is actually more daring than Kubrick's later detachment.  Starting with his brilliant ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and continuing through his final film, ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" Kubrick often kept the viewer separate from the subjects; almost like watching lab experiments in a refrigerator.  It's easy to feel superior when you keep everything at arm's length, smugly observing behaviors alien to yourself.  It's easy to assign undesirable actions to freaks like Alex, from ""A Clockwork Orange,"" or Jack Torrance in ""The Shining"" without having to feel uneasy about one's own tendency towards violence, or whatever behavior Kubrick chose to film, criticize, or satirize.

Actually, we are like these soldiers, and frequently, we are the victimizers ourselves, just as vain and self-justifying as Macready's hypocritical general.  ""Paths,"" then, can be seen as a challenge to the viewer, and it gains authority from its unwillingness to excuse us for our flaws, even as it embraces these battered men.  Okay, so it's overt humanism... but it's heartfelt and honest.  And true.

Altogether, this is one of Kubrick's most human films.  From the rat-infested trenches and the slaughterhouse floor of No Man's Land (the combat scenes, while fairly brief, remain some of the most visceral ever filmed) to the glacial elegance of the general's chateau, Kubrick takes us down all the paths to glory and the grave.",1023148800,13,2857,5.367713004484305
152655,5,0792841409,"In my opinion, this is Stanley Kubrick's least acknowledged masterpiece. Not many people are familiar with this film and I don't know why not? I am convinced that any film about World War I will be excellenet, simply because the fact that the three I can think of off the top of my head: ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Grand Illusion"", and ""Paths of Glory"" are all superbly brilliant films.
No fan of war movies should miss this outstanding film! It won't thrill you with glorified heroism, but will rather make you detest and reel from the beaurocracy of the military machine. It is unpatriotic and anti-Nationalistic and that is why it is such an important work. If more of our world would educate everyone by portraying the hypocracy of warfare as realistically as this film does, then perhaps there might be alot less less wars altogether?
The DVD is a good, sharp print and fits neatly into your Stanley Kubrick DVD collection. In fact, no collection of Kubrick films (as well as movies about war) would be complete without it!",1016582400,3,1036,4.697802197802198
152674,5,0792841409,"Stanley Kubrick didn't make this a violent film. There's a charge or two, and a bit of reloading here and there, but all in all weapons aren't the stars of this film like most war movies these days, the people are.
""Paths of Glory"" is an interesting and superb in that it gets to the point faster and more unclicheed than any other war film I've ever seen. And the point is that human life is important, not the brutality of war or the crookedness of politics, not to say they aren't clearly represented in this film, but Kubrick makes it clear that what we're dealing with is life and death. and he does it in splendid style.
The movie is short, around 1 hour and 45 minutes, and it's simple,  no elaborate special effects, sets, costumes, or cinematography. It's bleak looking, but it fills the screen because it's real. And it surprises you, you experience a saddening and partly depressing yet intriguing and exciting film, and then they give you a strange victory and an ending that is thoroughly uplifting and beautiful. It's trying to portay rather than meticulously copy, and in striving to portray and relate to a theme, it achieves a higher level than even the best modern war films. It doesn't try to outdo or out speak or out blow things up- it stays simple.
Here are some examples: Take the cinematography.  Kubrick was a photographer so he knew how to set up his shots to maximum effect with as little palabra. There's very spartan use of music, so at one of the most moving moments in the film that is a direct on screen use of music, it becomes one of the greatest moments in film history. Dialogue written by a collaboration of authors is not cliche or sappy, attempts at sentimental soldier speak are rough but to the point and sound fresh. The actors are portraying Frenchmen, but come in an assortment of authentic American and British accents which have very little in common with fluid and lovely French dialects, but the actors reach the base humanity needed to run the film and the go with it.
This is a superior war film not because of its use of special effects, it's blood and gore, or even it's amazing factual representation, but because of it's awareness of humanity in the face of adversity. It cares about real human emotions not recycled Hollywood ones they got out of the back lot. I'm not saying those aren't important, or that they're useless, not at all. But there are times when the fireworks can get old, but people never do.",1013385600,3,2464,4.5598194130925505

152676,3,0792841409,"This film is clearly based on the 1917 mutiny of French troops during the Nivelle Offensives. What happened was that the French troops tired of advancing against well prepared German positions in badly thought out offensives spat the dummy and said no more. They would defend but not attack. The French general staff shelled their own troops to try to get them going.
This film is reasonably simple in structure. A poorly planned attack is carried out and fails. The French generals want to execute some randomly chosen men to encourage the rest to be more enthusiastic next time. A trial is held which is of course simply a joke and the men are executed. Kirk Douglas plays an officer who leads the original attack and then defends the men in what is a Kangaroo court.
Kubrick's main problem as a director is the lack of complexity of his characters and the fact that he was a rather heavy handed director.
This story which is basically a simple anti war tract is one of his better films as there are really no characters. He is talking about an event. The portrait of the French generals is something of a crude charactature rather than being realistic. Still it was necessary to show his notion of the idiocy of war to attack them as being remote.
Kubrick's strong points are his photography and the construction of his scences. All of that is well done and it creates a series of powerful tableaus.",1011398400,8,1402,4.612
152677,4,0792841409,"Yes, this is beautifully shot and well-directed.  Unfortunately, the script is also extremely talky and very strident in its anti-war message.  Not that strident anti-war messages are  necessarily a bad thing, it's just not exactly something you have to pound in with a sledge, which is what Kubrick does here, and I have to admit, his trademark coldness doesn't help much for me.
Don't be fooled; this isn't a war film, it's a courtroom drama about how war is very, very bad, children.  The problem is there's no real suspense, humor, anything; it feels like one long lecture.  I can't help but feel ""The Grand Illusion"" overshadows this film very strongly.  That film got its message across rather subtly while demonstrating considerably more warmth, not to mention being more thrilling.
Still, as overshadowings go, ""The Grand Illusion"" is a great shadow to be in.  ""Paths of Glory"" is a very well-acted, well-directed film, and you can't beat the price, especially if you're a film nut.

Kirk Douglas and Stanley Kubrick paired up for the first time here, with astounding results. Powerful and intelligent, this film is the story of corruption and decadence among the French general staff and of innocent men killed to satisfy the ego of the leaders, which is what war is anyway. Colonel Dax is ordered on an impossible charge, then his men are put on trial by such ""legal"" methods as drawing lots or because a commanding officer didn't like them. The trial scenes are poignant, and show what happens in a society where pride is the only thing that matters and an objective pondrance of the facts is forgone in favor of making examples and flying a flag.

152679,5,0792841409,"General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) appoints General Paul Mireau (George Macready) to plan an attack on ""The Anthill"": An important German position that has been heavily fortified and deemed impregnable. The Regiment chosen to attack is the 701st, lead by Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas). Though it has been estimated that more than half of Dax's men will be killed, the 701st should be able to take and hold the Anthill until reinforcements arrive. A day later, the attack begins. After a light bombardment, the first wave charges toward the Hill. However it is found to be merely a suicide charge. Many of the troops are either killed or wounded. The bombardment is so intense that some of the soldiers never even leave the trenches. General Mireau (Who was observing the battle from afar) deems the men cowards and orders a court martial with a sentence of death if the men are convicted.
Paths of Glory is a bold and powerful statement against the self-serving officers of all armies. General Mireau did not capture the Anthill. So, although the charge was impossible, he court-martialed and had killed some of the ""cowards"" who made him look ""ridiculous"". These Generals, although they must be geniuses to have risen to such high rank, also have no clue what some of these soldiers go through. They live and work and dine and drink in their spacious, nice, clean mansions while the soldiers who do the fighting and win the wars live in cramped, ugly, dirty trenches under the constant fear of death and disease. In one scene, as General Mireau inspects the trenches, he comes across a shell-shocked soldier. In a scene reminiscent of Patton, he hits the soldier who he then claims is a Baby. Maybe if he had been in the first wave of the attack on the anthill, he might have respected the men rather than court-marital them. I will not talk much about the court martial, for there is not much to talk about. It is also more of a kangaroo court; The outcome has already been pre-determined and the defense is futile. The three men court-martialed are Private Paris (Ralph Meeker), selected because his unit commander has a personal grudge against him (The film shows why), Private Ferol (Timothy Carey), chosen because his commander finds him to be physically unattractive and Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), elected to be court-martialed just because he drew a slip of paper marked with an X. Paths of Glory has often been renowned as one of Stanley Kubrick's best films. However, despite wide critical acclaim, it was not a commercial success and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences denied it even a single Oscar nomination.

152680,4,0792841409,"'Paths of Glory' has much that is undeniably brilliant, and that points to the three great Kubrick masterpieces, '2001', 'Barry Lyndon' and 'The Shining' - the ambiguity that arises from a camera whose movement is synonymous with those in power (watch the anthill attack, where the men's literal immobility (i.e. death) is contrasted with the camera's inexorable momentum); the playing with audience's emotions, promising Hollywood respite, and always undercutting it; the astonishing use of interior space; the use of Enlightenment values to record the debasement of the Enlightenment; the recreation of history to satirise Kubrick's own society.
But, unlike those three timeless, eternal works, 'Paths' is bound by its time.  Its philosophy is rooted in an outmoded, but than fashionable, existentialism and Absurdism; it feels the (uncharacteristic for Kubrick) need to assert humanist values in the form of the song and Kirk Douglas' integrity (although this is interrogated, especially during the climactic ritual).  Most disappointing is the one-sidedness of the debate.  Later, Kubrick would ask us to sympathise with moral monsters against a violent and repressive society, which isn't always easy; in 'Paths', how could we not side with men chose to die by lots?",998438400,,1271,5.507692307692308

General Mireau (George Macready) and his boot licker Maj. Saint-Auban (Richard Anderson) trod through the trenches as if they're out to sign autographs.  But these men aren't full of fanfare, they're merely aware of the chances they will ever see daylight again. Col. Dax, a battle wise leader, is only a token hand when General makes an order that will mean certain death to the men in Dax's command.  As the inevitably failure of the assault surfaces, a slice of Dax's men are held to trial, and subsequently death, for cowardice.

They accused don't lack bravery, despite what the kangaroo trial asserts.  No, these men are simply powerless to their fate and the courtroom proves to be just as futile as the battlefield.

Paths of Glory is a surprisingly conventional film in structure compared to most other Kubrick productions, but the moral and social complexities studied within the story are the likes we hardly see even in modern cinema.  Where Saving Private Ryan wants you to enjoy the battle, as if it were a ride at Disneyland, Paths of Glory shows the true story of war.  Much like in Seven Samurai, in the end, there is death and the ones who remain are lucky to be alive.

The Blu-Ray

Having cut my teeth in the darkroom with black and white Fuji Neopan, this high def presentation of a true black and white film is quite the experience.  The tracking portions of Dax in the trenches before the Ant Hill battle are simply three dimensional - no special glasses needed folks. Cigarette smoke wisps in the air as morning light strikes Kirk Douglas on the cheek - you can almost taste it.  Focus is tight and lighting is crisp.  This is one of the best black and white high def releases i've seen.  It isn't that the presentation is perfect - it isn't - but it feels appropriate to the source materials.  It is gritty, dark and full of dense blacks.  Grain is present, but it only adds to the life of the image.  Some of the overcast footage during the Ant Hill assault are among the grainiest of the film - probably having been pushed two stops in the processing.  The Blu-Ray shows this in all its glory.  It feels as if this one was photographed yesterday.

Yes, its a war film,  buts its really an anti-war film.  During the Vietnam War and after  anti-war films became quite popular in the US, Kubrick's Paths of Glory was  light years ahead of its time with the anti-war message.  Alls Quiet on the  Western Front gives the same message but a lot of people, myself included  can not sit through a movie that old.  Also having read the book so many  times, Paths of Glory is a different story with a similiar anti war  message.  WWI was one of the most tragic wars in that not only was the war  itself not necessary but its battles were so bloody that they wiped out an  entire generation of Europeans.
Kirk Douglas acts up a storm in this  movie.  And watch him in this and look at his son Michael.  They look so  much alike.

And these rules were doctored not  from Lean, or Lewis Milestone, or anyone one else who earned profit for  Sunset Boulevard, or Oscar bonus points, they were doctored in 1957 by the  greastest of all AWOL-Hollywood directors: Stanley Kubrick.

Sure, it's a good movie, but it's got nothing on Kubrick's  later Full Metal Jacket. The plot and characters in Paths of Glory are  painted with such a broad stroke, they become somewhat implausible and it  leaves you wondering just how much the novel really has in common with how  the French Army was commanded in WWI.
My point being, that the true  stories of WWI provide much more compelling, anti-war drama than this  fictional screenplay - even if based on fact. My personal feeling is that a  disservice is done when history is embellished to no point. If you want to  convince people war is a bad idea, the truth is by far the most potent  weapon (as a comparison between the first and last battle scenes of Saving  Private Ryan should demonstrate).",930096000,3,990,4.632183908045977

PATHS OF GLORY (war, 1957) France, 1916: During W.W.I Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) is ordered by General Meraud (George McReady) to advance the  enemy and take an important `ant hill'. The General's orders prove suicidal  as most of the advancing soldiers are killed. There is an inevitable  retreat. Seeing this as an act of insubordination by Colonel Dax and his  men he orders  3 men from each regiment be executed for mutiny. But Colonel  Dax is determined to defend the men in court.
Critique: Along with the  legendary `All Quiet on the western Front' this is considered as the most  important war film made. Both take place in the mud-laden maze of trench  warfare and deals with the inept attitudes of the military leaders. Whereas  `Western Front' deals more with the subject of innocent blood being taken  to their slaughter by uncompromising Generals, `Paths' delves into the  political aspects and moral issues associated with war. Director Stanley  Kubrick reveled in showing just how topsy-turvy authoritarian figures can  be especially in times of war where all common sense disappears. He would  take things to the absurd with `Dr. Strangelove' and completely destroy  social fabric with the pessimistic `Clockwork Orange'. Every major  Hollywood house initially turned down `Paths' until Kirk Douglas stepped in  and co-produced the project. The result was to prove Kubrick's first  masterpiece establishing him as a major director. The film's many symbolic  and outright topical points will remain important.
QUOTES: Gen. Meraud:  ""The men died wonderfully. There's always that chance that one of them will  do something that will leave everyone with a bad taste. This time you  couldn't ask for none better.""",923616000,6,1729,5.207272727272727

This film, made in 1957, portrays a French Army colonel (Kirk Douglas) given an impossible combat assignment in 1916 at the height of WW I in France. Since the film shows some fictional French generals and other staff officers in a negative light during the First World War, the French government refused to allow Kubrick to shoot the film on French territory. It was also banned from playing in French cinemas. Undeterred, the production company shot the film on location in Germany and hired 700 German border policemen as extras to play the French infantry troops. PATHS OF GLORY is a grim story with no happy ending, but it is  extremely well done as a  movie.

7792426,5,0792841409,"The sublime World War I antiwar drama Paths of Glory (1957) is Stanley Kubricks first absolute masterpiece and possibly his greatest film. The Killing (1956) had established the directors absolute command over the temporal aspects of film making in a dazzling mosaic of cross-cutting as we see the same events from a variety of different viewpoints as a gang mount a racetrack heist. Paths of Glory takes this temporal command and adds a spatial dimension which from now on will dominate Kubricks worldview. The Killing was all about story and time in the depiction of a relentless machine which at first the gangsters control, but which ends up controlling them. Paths of Glory is still about story and time, but the machine is subtly extended to include two diametrically opposing spaces which seem to be disconnected, but which actually closely reflect and comment on each other to make for one machine which is as much social as it is military, and which relentlessly chews everyone up regardless of class or rank.

As with The Killing all characters are cogs within a machine performing their function without conscience, but with the deeply human exception of Col. Dax (Kirk Douglas giving his best performance), a cog with a conscience who connects these two spaces and voices our outrage at the series of awful events that transpire in the narrative. He is very much an anomaly in Kubrick as until this point there hasn't been a really fully-rounded human character in his films. We do not enter any of the characters in Fear and Desire (1953) and everyone in both Killers Kiss (1955) and The Killing are cyphers as per the film noir remit. From Lolita (1960) onward human characters disappear as they become cogs in a machine either part of (or opposed to) the status quo in increasingly broader canvases. At all times Kubrick forces the spectator to observe his characters dispassionately, coldly, always making us study their surroundings, the spaces they inhabit defining them to an enormous extent. Possibly due to Douglass status as a movie star (his company Bryna Productions made the film possible in the first place), though Dax proves to be a cog in the machine who cannot actually do anything, he is a beacon of human reason and decency who throws a blanket of human warmth over a film which otherwise would be as icy-cold as any Kubrick film that comes after it. This warmth in the face of blistering irony and callous endeavor gives the film a throbbing heart which has prompted even Kubrick-haters to admire and love it. Broadly speaking, if you hate Kubrick you will probably love Paths of Glory. What follows is a thematic review which contains spoilers. Dont read if you haven't seen.

Kubricks machine is French society as it stood in 1916 at the moment of stalemate in the war against the Germans. The two spaces are an imposing 18th century French chteau where the upper class French general staff deliberate over how to fight the war, and the filthy trenches where lower class Frenchmen fight and die as a consequence. These spaces are isolated from one another and there is no indication of another world existing away from them. Living in his chteau and representing the upper class is Gen. Mireau (George Macready), an ambitious divisional commander who is visited one morning by his immediate superior Gen. Broulard (Adolphe Menjou). As will become a Kubrick trademark, polite language masks devilish intent as Broulard twists Mireaus arm into getting him to oversee a French attack on an impregnable German position known as the Ant Hill. Broulard knows hes asking for the impossible and that many lives will be lost, but also knows personally he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. Career soldiers advance by achieving the impossible. Should Mireau succeed, this would reflect well on Broulard and move him ever-upward in the social hierarchy. Should he fail, then he would take the blame and Broulard would remain untouched to go again with the next divisional commander. For Broulard its a smart move especially as he knows Mireau is as ambitious as he is and will certainly agree to order the attack.

Games of power and ambition preoccupying the upper class are subtly reflected as games of survival being played by the lower classes in the trenches. The scum or the children as the generals like to call them are represented by a ragbag of pour souls existing under cowardly drunks like Lt. Roget (Wayne Morris) who is ordered to go on night patrol with two privates under his command, one of them Pvt. Paris (Ralph Meeker) an old school friend who dislikes him intensely. Paris witnesses a drunk Roget breaking down and to shut him up Roget personally selects him later to be executed. The executions are the result of a court-martial ordered by Mireau to account for his divisions failure in the battle and the way the three victims are chosen one per company sums up the options facing the lower classes fighting in the trenches. They are either selected by lot (Pvt. Arnaud played by Joe Turkel), victimized for being socially undesirable (Pvt. Ferol played by Timothy Carey) or chosen politically (Paris). A biting parallel is drawn between the way Mireau saves face in front of the general staff by passing blame for the battle failure onto his own soldiers and the way Roget saves face in front of Dax by choosing Paris to be one of the victims.

Linking two halves of the machine with one foot planted in the chteau and one foot planted in the trenches is Dax. He offers the correct distance from which we can observe both the callous conniving old generals, and the piteous games of survival played by the men under him. He gets to call Broulard a degenerate, sadistic old man and to punish Roget by placing him in command of the execution squad wherein he will have to put a bullet in Pariss head. Dax offers the appropriate moral perspective and is an exceptional figure in Kubrick, but the proffered warmth is deceptive once we recognize how powerless and impotent he really is. Kubrick plays a vicious game on audience expectation by offering Dax up initially as the hero figure. In a conventional Hollywood film he would eventually negotiate the release of the 3 condemned men and we are led to believe that when he visits Broulard to blackmail him with the threat to make public the fact that during the battle Mireau had ordered his artillery to fire upon his own troops, the 3 men will be saved. But in the end Broulard uses the information to get rid of Mireau (his aim all along) rather than save the men who Dax simply watches being shot. Dax is left with nothing but angry words to fire at Broulard who is genuinely surprised when he rejects the offer of Mireaus job. The callous old general has nothing but pity for Daxs humanism when he sees his cynicism and ambition are not shared. Dax returns to his men an honorable figure at least by intention but he has actually achieved nothing, Kubrick leaving us under no doubt that however much he may be a beacon of human reason and decency, he takes his place as a cog alongside everyone else in the machine.

Much of the beauty of this film lies in the superbly wrought screenplay adapted from Humphrey Cobbs novel by Kubrick with Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson. The novel was in 3 parts consisting of the build-up to the battle, the battle itself and then the aftermath, but Kubrick and his collaborators condense it down into 2 parts which are deliberately designed to mirror each other. Each part starts with a meeting between senior officers at the chteau. In part 1 Mireau and Broulard meet to decide the attack on the Ant Hill while in part 2 Mireau, Broulard and Dax meet to decide what should be done after the failure of the attack. Each part pans out in a series of events which result from the decisions reached at these meetings. The battle and the execution are paralleled together as the final outcome of each part. Very deliberately the battle takes place in the world of the trenches while the execution takes place in the world of the chteau, with both depicted as equally shocking and appalling. Furthermore, the 2 parts are framed by a prologue and an epilogue, the first consisting of a voice-over given by the omniscient narrator familiar from The Killing who will appear again in Dr. Strangelove. The effect is to give the air of documentary to the film which Kubrick sustains remarkably throughout with no further recourse to the voice. As we listen we see Broulard arrives at the chteau and is given a guard of honor welcome. The epilogue consists of 2 scenes, the first the breakfast after the execution as Broulard disgraces Mireau in front of Dax, and the second the bistro scene as the troops listen to a German girl sing which generates an emotional meltdown. In both parts of the frame the 2 spaces featured in the narrative are clearly presented  the chteau at which Broulard arrives at the beginning and has breakfast at the end, and the trenches in the words of the bitter opening narration and in the concluding bistro which acts as an extension of the same.

Within this superbly balanced narrative structure, Kubrick achieves unprecedented complexity in the way his conceptual cinematography drives home his vision of mechanical men working the machine that defines their lives. The 2 narrative spaces are cleanly articulated in the screenplay, but in addition Kubrick shows the spaces reflecting and commenting on each other throughout with the repetition of situations and camera movements. Most revealing is the way the paths of glory for all the characters are clearly delineated with a constantly tracking camera. The first path is made at the beginning by the guard of honor lined up to welcome Broulard at the chteau. As the two generals talk we are aware of the hostility underlying the hospitality. Broulard congratulates Mireau on his taste for carpets and pictures while not having the slightest interest in either. Kubricks camera (operated by Georg Krause) follows them around a sumptuous drawing room decked out in 18th century furnishing and paintings which comment ironically on the callous planned manipulation of mens lives going on in front of them. Kubricks interest in (and distrust of) the 18th century age of enlightenment began here and will be continued through all his films until the 18th century costume drama Barry Lyndon clearly pinpoints that epoch as being the time when modern man was not only born, but man in toto started to go wrong. As the generals make their gentle way along the paths of an elegant room a connection is drawn between 18th century opulence begetting 20th century monstrosity. This point is made crystal clear in the following scene which has another scene of a superior officer visiting his subordinate, this time Mireau visiting Dax in his trench. As Mireaus hand slams into his fist as he says, We might just do it! Kubrick cuts to the same man walking down the trench, the Marseillaise on the soundtrack in the chteau exchanged for the sounds of artillery fire and explosions. Mireau is a fish out of water cutting a ridiculous figure as he marches down his path of glory offering false hope and inane encouragements to men who are clearly weary to the bone. One shell-shocked soldier (Fred Bell) is ordered away so as not to contaminate the rest. When Mireau enters Daxs quarters he says the same thing as Broulard did when entering the chteau, complementing the furnishings. The conversation has exactly the same pattern as the one with Broulard albeit with Daxs answers being more down to earth. Mireau reminds Dax of patriotism to which Dax quotes Samuel Johnson: Patriotism  the last refuge of a scoundrel. Dax is clever, the best criminal lawyer in France in fact, and is more skilled by far than Mireau, but social and military rank over-rides such subtleties and the conversation ends with Dax acceding to Mireaus request in the same way Mireau acceded to Broulard  Well take the Ant Hill. The following scene moves down the military scale another notch as Dax orders Roget to do his night patrol. Rogets path of glory accompanied by another tracking shot takes the 3 out into no-mans land and is ironically capped by the senior officer panicking and running away. His path to glory is actually a path to disgrace, but because the military machine places him higher than the privates he can fake a report and rely on Paris to keep quiet.

Having established the class divisions and the four clear tiers in the military machine (general-colonel-lieutenant-private) Kubrick now reaches the battle which shows how the machine breaks down. As Mireau takes his place to observe, arrogantly toasting victory for France with his subordinate Maj. Saint-Auban (Richard Anderson), Dax begins his famous walk down the trench. This is a celebrated sequence, and quite rightly so. Not only is it a superb technical achievement with a camera tracking down a trench lined with petrified soldiers on either side, but the track fits exactly into the scheme of the film. For the first time the camera assumes subjectivity as soldiers stare straight at it as Dax makes his way along. The reverse track focusing on Dax that follows seems to retain this subjectivity as he grimly passes along to impending doom. The atmosphere is terrifying especially when the camera plunges into mist caused by the deafening sound of artillery explosions above him, but we contrast Daxs supreme confidence, the fact that he is totally in command of his space in a way that Mireau walking down the same trench earlier certainly wasnt. We also contrast this command of space (of space defining the man as it will do repeatedly through all later Kubrick) with the battle about to occur in which this command is completely lost. One long studied tracking shot (actually 5 shots subtly intercut) gives way to a 3-minute tracking shot (actually taken with 7 cameras, 1 of which was handheld by Kubrick himself) of the carnage of the battle taking place on a God-forsaken blasted garbage heap. The sequence is one of cinemas greatest battle scenes and proves you don't need Peckinpah slow motion blood n guts to get across the sheer horror of war. The futility of it all is self-evident, but the horror even of this is out-trumped by Mireaus meltdown and command to fire on his own troops because they have failed to even get out of their trenches. When his order is disobeyed his monstrosity is capped with the line, If those little sweethearts won't face German bullets, theyll face French ones.

If the first half of the film demonstrates how the machine breaks down then the second half shows how the machine is repaired and the horror of the process is no less appalling than the battle. As Broulard, Mireau and Dax convene at the chteau to discuss what should be done we notice they walk through the rooms as a giant painting is moved in the opposite direction. Its a quick shot, but it shows how the harmony of the upper class general staff (of Mireaus home) has been disturbed. When they sit down we notice Mireau is isolated against a glaring white window while Dax and Broulard are captured together in the same frame. This tells us who must take the eventual blame, especially as the spectator knows what Dax and Broulard do not  that he ordered the artillery to fire on his own troops. It also tells us that Dax and Broulard are destined to be partners even if both misunderstand the others motives at this point. The selection of 3 victims to be court-martialed and executed as examples to be set to the whole division is a compromise (Mireau originally wants a larger number shot) and Daxs obvious siding with Broulard against his own commanding officer results both in angering Mireau and in Dax being appointed defense council for the accused. Broulard thinks Dax is angling for promotion and is thinking even at this stage of giving him Mireaus command, but Dax is a humanist only concerned with saving his own men. The paths of glory for each of these characters are fundamentally different and it remains for each one to discover where they lead.

Kubrick stresses these games of ambition by framing the characters within doorways, on steps and on checkered floors which deliberately connote a chessboard. Chess was announced in The Killers and will keep appearing throughout Kubricks films, but here it gets its greatest statement in the court-martial scene where the three prisoners are positioned like pawns on the checked floor (Kubricks high camera angles emphasize the connection) as Saint-Auban and Dax carry on the trial in front of the chief judge (Peter Capell) while Mireau sits to one side observing the kangaroo court whose verdict has already been decided. Kirk Douglas is given the chance to play to the gallery with his passionate plea for the noblest impulse in man and his underlining of the trial as being a stain on the honor of France (he does such a good job that France banned the showing of the film for 14 years!), but his heroic defense is constantly undercut by Kubricks subtle camera movements, especially sliding on a lateral track to frame Dax constantly behind the upright shadows of guards lining the arena. Daxs intentions are good, but in the final analysis he is impotent. We know the verdict even before the court begins  the pawns are to be sacrificed and the rest is a ritual all part of the machine-fixing process.

In this second half Kubrick constantly stresses the presence of the trenches even though the action takes place in the chteau throughout. Just as Mireau was ill at ease in the trench Dax sits nervously out of place with the two generals in the opening meeting. Mireau stresses the social difference between them by dressing down Dax on a stairway in a composition notable for turning the interior of the chteau into a trench-like series of arches leading down the stairway and into the distance. The next scene shows the condemned men in a dirty stable which is clearly an extension of the trench, just as the final bistro will be. The court-martial scene shows the presence of the trenches (the accused) in an ornate hall which is the same location used for a ball later on. The effect is hugely ironic for an arena once used to sentence 3 men to death is now being used as a ballroom as guests togged up in fine clothing dance Johann Strauss The Artists Life Waltz on the same chessboard floor. That the upper class can dance on the eve of such an unjust execution makes the scene even more horrific than the trial itself, the scene marking the appearance of Kubricks trademark ironic use of music (think Vera Lynn singing Well meet again as the world explodes in nuclear cataclysm at the end of Dr. Strangelove, or Moon-Watcher discovering his weapon to R. Strausss Also Sprach Zarathustra in 2001). The trenches make their most significant appearance at the chteau in the execution scene itself as the columns of men line up to make a path to glory which echoes the guard of honor formed for Broulard in the films opening scene, and also echoes the trench down which Dax marched before the battle. Here we have the second subjective camera track as we see the three stakes looming up from the viewpoint of the accused. We also see the callous officers (including Dax) standing aside looking down into the camera in the same way the soldiers looked into the camera as Dax passed them by in the trench. The horror of the shooting is carried over into the cruel sound of cutlery tinkling as Mireau and Broulard eat breakfast immediately afterwards with the former eulogizing the beautiful way the men died (!). The trenches enter the chteau for the last time as Dax arrives to witness Broulard tell Mireau about the impending inquiry into the order to fire on French troops in the battle. The conversation brilliantly echoes the previous conversation between Broulard and Dax in the library during the ball when Dax gave him the news, both starting with By the way Mireau gone, Broulard thinks Dax has earned the right to walk his path of glory and offers him Mireaus command, but for Dax the path of glory remains a fundamentally humanist one and he prefers to stay in the trenches where he really belongs.

The concluding sing-a-long in the bistro has been criticized by some as a betrayal of the films tone. Robert Phillip Kolker says, This sentimentality runs against the grain of the film. What had been a close and tight structure of brutality, false hope, and greater brutality now seems to be diminished by a conventional means to move an audience, communal tears. I would disagree with this. The scene emerges naturally out of the humanism voiced by Dax all the way through. Although his heart is in the right place (as we assume it is for the majority of these lower class trenchmen), it is sobering enough that we acknowledge they are all cogs in an inhuman machine from which they cant escape. There has to be hope somewhere and the fact that Kubrick allows the sun to penetrate if only partially gives Paths of Glory a magnificent heart which all his subsequent films lack. The icy-cold misanthropy of the later films may be a more brutally realistic view of the world and make for a more watertight intellectual argument to the point where from the point of view of Dr. Strangelove say or Barry Lyndon, Daxs humanism may be a blot, but Id argue that the warmth he gives makes the final emotional meltdown not only natural but essential. This is the one Kubrick film that moves me to tears when I see it, and what pray is wrong with that? I love later Kubrick, especially Dr. Strangelove, 2001 and Barry Lyndon, but I wouldnt change a single frame of Paths of Glory. It is a masterpiece.",1520467200,,21756,4.779106858054226
