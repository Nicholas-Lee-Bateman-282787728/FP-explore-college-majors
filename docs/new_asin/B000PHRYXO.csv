8191380,5,B000PHRYXO,"This is one of the best documentaries on Poe I have seen.  I especially like the dramatic scenes from ""The Cask of Amontillado"" and ""The Tell-Tale Heart.""  It is difficult to find decent Poe dramatizations that can be shown in the classroom.  I do wish this was available on DVD and that the director of the dramatic scenes, Joyce Chopra, had gone on to film all the Poe stories in full.",1289865600,6,387,4.422535211267606
