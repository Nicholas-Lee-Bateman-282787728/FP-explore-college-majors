3725295,5,B001O0TMAY,"Our two year old loves Thomas and we had borrowed this DVD from the Library first.  The pace is good and the songs are cute.  He even tries to ""sing"" along a little before he really could speak.",1366761600,,194,4.078947368421052
3725296,4,B001O0TMAY,"This Thomas dvd is refreshing since it's got a lot of songs. It's also neat how they do a bouncing ball over the words. When my two-year-old gets a little older, I can see that being a beginning-to-read aid.",1355097600,,207,4.333333333333333
3725297,5,B001O0TMAY,THIS VHS HAS THE BEST COLLECTION OF THE OLDER AND NEW THOMAS SONGS! I LIKE THAT IT INCLUDES THE OLDER VERSIONS TOO!,1355011200,,115,4.2727272727272725
3725298,5,B001O0TMAY,Both my 2 and 3 year old grandsons love Thomas.  This DVD was a hit. THey wanted to watch it over and over.  The songs had the words with it so I could sing along also.  In between the songs it did a roll call of engines showing the picture and their name.  I think this was their favortie part shouting out the engine's names as the flashed before them.,1339200000,,354,4.014285714285714
3725299,2,B001O0TMAY,"My 18 month old will not sit still to watch this one, and he loves most of the others. The music is very slow and boring and the picture is very dated. Use your money for one of the other DVD's.",1306195200,,194,3.7560975609756095
3725300,5,B001O0TMAY,"If the video plays and my kids like it, I like it!  Ergo; I'm happy with these three diverting, happy Thomas offerings as received from,

3725301,5,B001O0TMAY,My son who is autistic loves Thomas like so many other children.  This is by far his favorite dvd.  Thomas Sing Along is so fast and has such great songs.  I wish that they would make more Thomas dvds with ONLY SONGS!  I love watching this dvd with him.,1297814400,3,253,4.1020408163265305
3725302,5,B001O0TMAY,My son loves this DVD so much that we wore out the last one we had and had to get a new one.,1279584000,,92,3.0434782608695654
3725303,3,B001O0TMAY,"If you are buying this just for the DVD you will like it. However, if you are buying this specifically to add the Gold Thomas train that is pictured to a train collection, beware- the train is not the one pictured.  Instead of Gold Thomas, as is pictured, we got some Frank train instead.

Nevertheless, the Sing Along songs are great.  I like the Thomas and Friends DVDs that are ""song heavy"", since my child prefers the music to the stories.  We also own ""Songs from The Station"", and ""Trackside Tunes.""  Out of all three of the ""song heavy"" Thomas and Friends DVD's, this has the most mellow and gentle collection of songs, which is a nice contrast to the energy of the songs in Trackside Tunes and Songs from the Station.  It is nice to put on, particularly in the evening.  Furthermore, there are some stories and some interactive parts in the menu.  The stories and songs in the set appear to be the older and more ""classic"" ones as well.

Overall, a great purchase, particularly if you don't care what train you get.  But based on more recent reviews, it seems like the trains pictured in some of these packages are not as pictured, and in this case, it is highly likely you won't get Gold Thomas.",1253145600,7,1204,4.45662100456621
3725314,4,B001O0TMAY,My two grandsons age 3 and 4 enjoy watching and singing along with video.  The video keeps them entertained for quite a while.,1398816000,,126,4.478260869565218
3725315,5,B001O0TMAY,"Some reviews said it was low tempo. We think it's wonderful and the songs are very catchy, very catchy, very catchy...LOL",1396569600,,121,4.809523809523809

3725318,1,B001O0TMAY,this version is really boring. the people don't move.  Thomas doesn't have much expression.  3 years old was very disappointed after gramma lugged it all the way to Germany for him.,1392595200,,181,4.806451612903226
3725319,2,B001O0TMAY,My grandson wanted this because he loves trains and music. The songs are slow and in between songs did not keep his attention.,1391644800,,126,4.521739130434782
3725320,1,B001O0TMAY,I feel like i was ripped off! My 3 yr old son doesn't like the dvd because it is not the Thomas and Friends that he knows. It's the one they show in England. that should have been stated before i wasted my money.,1388707200,,212,3.840909090909091
3725321,5,B001O0TMAY,My son is 4 and loves this DVD.  It is his favorite thing to watch at bedtime!  We now own 2 copies one for grandma's house and one for ours.,1381968000,,141,3.6666666666666665
3725322,5,B001O0TMAY,I think all Thomas the tank engine shows should be recommended viewing for all small children. It is not only a great series but very educational as well. My only hope is that at some time very soon they start producing digital copies of the entire Thomas collection. With small children they tend to damage all the DVD's and then you have to make another purchase. PLease release digital copies for the original series shows !!,1374364800,,428,4.644736842105263
3725323,2,B001O0TMAY,Very disappointed by the songs on this video - very low energy.  The best thing about it is that it will put us all to sleep.,1369094400,,125,3.8076923076923075
