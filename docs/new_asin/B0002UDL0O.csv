8031978,5,B0002UDL0O,"The TV Movie Which Started It All For ""Hart To Hart"" On A Special Collector's Edition Video.

From The Notes On The Box:

When Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers tackled their first case as Jonathan and Jennifer Hart in this 1979 TV movie, they became part of that time-honored mystery tradition of husband-and-wife detective teams with alliterative first names. Dashiell Hammett had given us Nick and Nora Charles in The Thin Man (played in six MGM films by William Poweii and Myrna Loy), And even before Nick and Nora, Agatha Christie had created her clues-chasing couple, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford.

The Hart beat began in the mind of Sidney Sheldon, the author of such best-selling novels as The Other Side of Midnight and Bloodline. Sheidon concocted the story that became the pilot film for NBC's Hart to Hart series (1979-84), collaborating on the script with Tom Mankiewicz. Produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg (Charlie's Angels and Family), the TV movie introduces us to dashing Los Angeles millionaire Jonathan Hart His beautiful wife, Jennifer, is a freelance journalist. When a suspicious accident claims the life of a friend, Jonathan and Jennifer go undercover at a health farm run by two villainous doctors (Roddy McDowall and Stella Stevens).

With their chauffeur, Max (Hollywood veteran Lionel Stander), and their dog, Freeway, along for the giddy five-season ride, the jet-setting Harts continued their sleuthing ways for five seasons. In 1979, Wagner was married to Natalie Wood (who died in 1981 (.The supporting cast for the pilot includes the Wagners' close friend, Jill St. John. She would marry Robert Wagner in 1990.

Both Hart to Hart stars had starred in spy shows of the '60s: Wagner in ABC's To Catch a Thief, Powers in NBC's The Girl from U.N.C.L.E. And although the early '70s had been the era of the character cop (Cofumbo, Kojak, Cannon), Spelling, Sheldon and company gambled on viewers wanting their homicide served up with generous dashes of glamour. Wagner and Powers proved them right.
