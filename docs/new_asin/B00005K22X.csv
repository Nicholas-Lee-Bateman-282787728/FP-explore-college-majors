7942637,3,B00005K22X,"First of all, I want to note that this video was originally marketed without ""Pilates"" in the title; my cover simply says ""Core Essentials.""  I'm not sure why Pilates was added in--as others have said, this is definitely not a Pilates workout.  Rather, it is a full-body toning workout similar to the first half of one of Karen's early videos, Streamline Fitness.
The workout begins with a simple, 4 minute warm-up to get your body moving; this is followed by 8 minutes of standing strength moves.  The exercises consist of traditional squats and crunches, but Karen makes them unique by adding more movement.  Although her cuing is excellent, the variety of the moves is a little hard to follow upon first viewing of the tape, but you do get the hang of it.  One problem I had with this section is regarding how Karen uses the arms:  the arm movements often seem unnecessary and mismatched to the leg work.
The main body of this workout occurs on the floor.  Karen continues the legwork with extensions done both on all fours and on the side; she sometimes uses her weighted ""genie balls,"" but the moves are challenging enough without the added weight!  She also targets the arms with a tough push-ups sequence as well as several exercises with dumbbells.  Karen ends the workout with abs and back exercises followed by a 6 minute cool down.
As always, Karen offers meticulous tips on form throughout.  This was an average-to-good workout (I'd actually have given it 3 1/2 stars if I could), but I preferred Karen's Streamline Fitness, which offers additional arm work, a tougher abs section, and relaxing yoga moves as well.",1069632000,7,1626,4.775
7942638,2,B00005K22X,"I recently purchased this video along with Karen's Abdominals and Back.  I have tried them both.  Contrary to other reviews I found the instructions and moves easy to follow, but as a 55 year old women who works out an hour almost everyday - aerobics and strength training, I found these two tapes to be almost too easy.  I used the abs and back tape this AM and felt stretched afterward but sort of guilty - like I didn't work out.  These would be good for relieving stress as an end of the day workout - like yoga.  I have quite a few of The Firm tapes, Cardio Split, Super Cardio, Super Sculpting, Cardio Burn, all the ""Tough"" tapes and several of the ""Total Body"" tapes, which incorporate a lot of toning and pilates like core strengthening and I feel they do more for me when I only have an hour or so a day to devote to a workout.  The Firm tapes are good because as you improve you can add heavier weights, ankle weights and increase the challenge.
This tape would be good to develop smooth control on a lot of moves and help people who need back and ab strengthening and beginning toning as well as loosening up tight muscles, but for a person who regularly works out I'm sure they will find them ""whimpy"".",1043971200,4,1214,4.302631578947368
7942639,4,B00005K22X,"Karen really pours her creative energy into this workout. She teaches from a blue full moon type platform with a background of purple that is actually quite relaxing.  In her red outfit, the scene becomes rather interesting. I also liked the camera angles in this one. There is plenty of movement and you are never bored.

While you will recognize some of her signature moves, she has also incorporated some new variation. To optimize the results, she believes variety is key. She puts new twists on classic exercises. She has refined all the exercises so you don't waste energy. She has a way of focusing on fewer reps, but you get so much out of each lunge, squat, pushup and ab crunch.

Basically, you are using your own body weight in combination with light resistance. You will also focus on the essential muscles of your arms and legs. Karen has fused the teachings of Joseph Pilates, yoga and ballet with her own body-sculpting techniques.

You will need a pair of Green Genie balls, a set of 5lb. Hand weights, a yoga mat and a towel. One great feature is you don't need a ton of room to do the moves in this video. You can't really substitute a set of 3lb. hand weights for the Genie balls, just so you know. Once you order the video, there is a pamphlet that tells you were you can order the essential tools you need for her videos.

The workout starts with some simple standing stretches and moves into a warming sequence of lunges. If some of the choreography gets a bit much, just be patient. By the third or fourth time you use this tape you will have it down. The first part is the most intense and involves lots of bending at the knee. Gets your heart rate up. Compared to most workout videos, it is really such a short segment.

The workout then moves to ""Legs and Butt"", focusing on a floor routine, which is quite creative and inspiring. Karen makes sure she tells you what to watch for and gives pointers throughout so you keep concentrating on each exercise.

The ""Arms, Back and Torso"" segment includes pushups that are combined with yoga moves and I found them quite enjoyable for a change. Then you move into the Abdominal section, which is also a floor routine.

Finally, you ""Cool Down"" and stretch out. This segment could have been longer. I always want more ""stretching!""

40 minutes seems more like 20 for some reason. It is just plain fun and the music keeps you motivated!

7942640,5,B00005K22X,"I found this video a creative, fun, yet short workout.  One of the best so far, and I have alot of tapes. The tempo and explanation by Karen are easy to follow.  It has helped all major areas of the body, although arms are not as intense as butt and thighs.  The balls are pretty versatile, but I use dumbells too.  I would recommend this to beginners or intermediate exercisers.",1011916800,8,379,4.371428571428571
7942641,5,B00005K22X,"I have a TON of exercise videos, quite a few of Karen Voight's, and I have to tell you this one is my new favorite.  I did this workout after doing 25 minutes of cardio from Karen's Strong and Smooth Moves video and it worked out wonderfully.  Some of the moves (like for your butt) are pretty intense and others are a little lighter but you still feel them working.  It was a wonderful mix!  I felt so good when I finished this video!  Karen does a standing warm-up in which she works your legs, then she proceeds to floorwork which is along the lines of Pilates.  She uses the ""green genie"" balls (soft 3lb. weighted balls) or 5 lb. dumbbells for some exercises.  (I just bought my 3lb. balls at Wal-mart--they were much cheaper there and they are great to work with instead of the dumbbells!--definitely worth the investment if you like Karen, she uses them in many of her other videos)  The ab work was not overly intense but a nice change from endless crunches.  If you focus, you can get an intense burn going.  I definitely felt the butt and thigh work.  All in all, I have to say, this is a great workout.  I saw it had a bad review but I think if you are having difficulty getting some of the moves, all it would take would be watching or doing the video a few times.  They are really not that complex.  I absolutely recommend this video to all fitness levels!!",1011139200,14,1370,4.30078125
