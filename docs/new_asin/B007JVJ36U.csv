8518486,4,B007JVJ36U,It shows the star power and the great acting chops of the late Diana Sands who died too soon. There's a mystery about why it disappeared from the public. I tried for years to get a copy to no avail. Thank God for Amazon. And the fact Dr. Maya Angelou wrote this made it an important film and one that should be reexamined and critiqued today to give it a fair chance of getting it's just due. I also loved Dirk Benedict in this one. I felt the entire cast was perfect. BRAVO!,1400889600,6,475,4.118279569892473

Dirk was the proper 'eye-candy' for this part.  And Miss Minnie Gentry was the right combination of hatred, anger and vengeance.  The ending is totaling clever!  Bravo!!!",1361404800,5,315,4.362068965517241
