2772559,2,B000NO23WQ,"This video is outdated for anyone who is interested in seeing a variety of birth options.
The most helpful parts were the viewings of the developing fetus while the moms were ""doing their lives"" daily.  To me this gave a real sense of life growing while mom's life was happening.  I was disappointed in the actual birth scenes since all moms were lying on their backs in hospital beds, often being offered various interventions to ""help"" with pain.",1215129600,15,448,4.730769230769231
2772560,2,B000NO23WQ,"This DVD follow ten potential or pregnant mothers.  Babies are talked about, but I felt the content could have been better.  They show real births.  I am glad I am a man.  You ladies are great.",1213833600,,193,4.277777777777778
2772561,3,B000NO23WQ,"I warn you, I've only seen parts of it, but from what I have have seen I think it's it's fairly good. The graphics are wonderful. Diana: The US has ""high"" infant mortality rates due to the fact that in government statistics any death up to a year old is considered ""infant mortality"", other countries largely do not do this.",1193443200,17,324,4.416666666666667
2772562,1,B000NO23WQ,"Sadly, this was the Discovery Channel's video about conception and birth in the US and only in the hospital.  It includes images of one c-section, epidural injections, women laboring in pain while lying down and medical personnel only suggesting an epidural for pain relief, not a bath or meditation, doula or birth ball.  It also included wonderful, imaginative animation for conception and the growth of the fetus.  A more balanced film about birth in the US which includes both hospital and home birth is, ""Born in the U.S.A."" by PatchWork films.
Can the Discovery Channel please do more research and give us a video which includes the reason the USA has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world?",1192924800,15,713,4.87603305785124

2772585,4,B000NO23WQ,"I recently taught 2 first responder classes and tried several different versions of child birth vidios but the From Conception to birth was easy to understand for the people who were just starting in  emergency medical services, and the animation was easier on every one,  sometimes the actual child birth it's self is a little more than some can handel.  Thankyou Dale",1357084800,,369,4.919354838709677
2772586,5,B000NO23WQ,This book is fantastic!  I am a health teacher and this is a wonderful visual learning tool!  The book was still in great shape and was a steal for the price listed!,1336867200,,165,4.125

Wanted to ""educate"" and prevent though knowledge the process to prevente another ""careless"" accident though ignorance.  I enjoyed the presentation for its clarity and depth of coverage.  So far it has worked.",1297728000,,321,4.925925925925926
2772588,2,B000NO23WQ,"My husband and I both agree this movie was very scary- especially having our first child.  Also, the technology they talk so highly of in the beginning wasn't used as much as it should have been.  They focused on the lives of the 9 women far too much instead of focusing on the title of the movie- Conception to Birth.

If you are looking for a good movie with 3D/4D animations and images, try National Geographic's ""In the Womb"".  It is wonderful and extremley informative.  It truly portrays the miracle of life that a baby is.",1249344000,23,529,4.46875
2772589,4,B000NO23WQ,"It talks alot on the development of the fetus in the mother's womb and the process of labour. Computer animation plays a very big role in the success of a whole part of the video. Not much is touched on the conception part (the process of the union of the sperm and the egg) and the details of the sexual reproductive organs unlike the other DVDs I've bought. For those costumer who are based in Asia, I can assure you that you can play the video in this DVD via your computer's DVD drive using Media Classic Player program.",1243296000,,524,4.303030303030303
2772590,5,B000NO23WQ,"This product is a jewel is very educative and opened mind, it help every age to understand the process of life. I personally recommended. The only thing is that the DVD don't have closed caption or subtitle to help you understand better the worlds.  I hope that you enjoy it.",1236816000,,275,4.5
2772591,1,B000NO23WQ,"At 7 months pregnant with my second child, I enjoyed this movie until I got tired of how often they reiterated how painful, practically impossible, and scary pregnancy and childbirth are.  I mean, ""Childbirth is like trying to fit a softball down your throat?""  And they went on and on about how it should be physically impossible, how painful it is... all while showing moms in labor lying on their backs in hospital beds, hooked up to IVs and fetal monitors  not being offered any pain relief (like walking around or being massaged or having a shower or a bath or any other comfort measures) until they finally ""give in"" and have the epidural... It's another ridiculous example of how our media distorts birth and helps cause our high cesarean rates and poor fetal outcomes.  My young son was with me, and even he had the sense to say at the beginning, when they took a baby away from the mom immediately, ""hey! that baby wants to be with its mother.""  I do have to say the images of the babies in the moms' bellies while they walked around were pretty awesome.  But there was hardly any of that, unfortunately, and the rest of the video isn't worth watching to get to them.",1228953600,54,1176,4.497652582159624
2772592,2,B000NO23WQ,"I did to buy a dvd, and the picture of the women is feeling her  tummy. And I said ok I want to buy the dvd, and then it came it was different from the dvd on this site. It was just birth women saiding what they do you to make the mother feel comfortable during the labor and birth, I was very disapointed in it. And then the people I brought it from was trying to make me happy, if they want to do that make sure the dvd you put on this site is the same as what I want to buy from you. That all am saying.",1219190400,,506,3.6

8179636,5,B000NO23WQ,"""From Conception to Birth"" is a fascinating journey. This DVD tells the story of nine couples. Some lose their baby, some end up having a cesarean and one woman even tries to tough it out without an epidural.

The amazing computer generated animation shows exactly what is happening in the womb for the whole nine months. That alone makes it worth watching. Near the end there is more of a focus on the birthing process which to some might seem very scary. However the miracle of birth is such an emotional experience you may feel like crying because of the beauty of the whole experience.

I'd highly recommend this to every woman who is considering getting pregnant and even to those who are not. This DVD leaves no doubt that even at 8 weeks the fetus looks exactly like a baby. This DVD also explains that babies of 8 weeks have a sense of touch. I'm glad I watched this DVD and I think you will enjoy it.

8179637,5,B000NO23WQ,"I am a psychology teacher and this video is perfect for the life development unit. It explains in detail about conception, prenatal development and birth.

More About this Product

This fascinating program follows the physical development of a baby from conception to birth by following the pregnancies of a number of young women. Using enhanced computer animation made from ultrasound pictures and computer graphics this program illustrates and describes the development of a child from beginning through birth. For example, at four weeks the embryo is no bigger than a grain of rice, at eight weeks the size of walnut - all organs are developing, liver lungs brain and bones, at 26 weeks it can taste, squeeze hands, respond to light and sound, and might survive if born. These and many more interesting facts are explored.",1371168000,,690,4.991304347826087
