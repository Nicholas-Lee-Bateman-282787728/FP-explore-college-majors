8596696,4,B00DRKR27O,"Sophie Marceau was super cute in this movie, but I really love Marton Csokas, and he was great as usual. It was nice seeing him in this type of role. Movie was a bit far-fetched at times, but it was whimsical...and the spoken French was beautiful.",1431388800,,247,4.391304347826087

8596700,4,B00DRKR27O,"An introspective look at being an adult and how our childhoods truly affect us in both good and sad ways.  Comedic, touching, frustrating, romantic, French film starring some super actors including Sophie Marceau.

Ms. Marceau's character drives herself at a frantic pace to succeed.  The first part of the film moves in stressful bursts as we see how chaotic and unhappy Margaret's(aka Margarite)'great' life is.  On her work driven 40th birthday, she receives letters delivered by an aging man, apparently unknown to her, written by a 7 year old.  Reluctantly, Margaret starts opening the mail and soon is engulfed or obsessed with discovering what she really wants in life much to the chagrin of her equally driven fiance.

The movie flashes back and forth between her childhood and adulthood, gradually making sense to a hopeful mystery of rebirth or, should I say, second chances.  How will she change her life?  Will she stay with her successful job and fiance or follow after her past?  Each letter she reads brings a new revelation.

Well shot and acted with good subtitles(you'll need to watch them closely, especially, at the frantic beginning)- a little bit of English is thrown into the conversations.  Sophie Marceau does a convincing job as the self-centered but endearing woman who constantly needs to look at famous women's pictures, e.g., Liz Taylor, Ava Gardner, Margaret Thatcher to bolster her confidence in tough situations.

It's a fun movie, no nudity or violence, a couple French swear words, and they tie it up all nicely by the end.",1396656000,2,1558,5.019455252918288
8596701,5,B00DRKR27O,"Very happy et tres heureuse with the purchase of this obscure yet amusing movie by one of my favorite French actresses, Sophie Marceau.  The product could have been packaged a lot better since it arrived somewhat fragile and part of the packaging was tearing off.  Nevertheless, the quality of the movie itself is excellent and I am happy with the movie.  Merci!",1393804800,,362,4.806451612903226
8596702,1,B00DRKR27O,"If you are a feminist or modern woman (or a male advocate of such women) in any way, I would recommend you not spend money on this product for any reason.  It is pure crap.  I was disappointed, because I purchased it knowing Marton Csokas would be speaking in French (sexy!), but the story was just painful to watch.  It was completely pointless, and I'm not sure what I was supposed to have taken away from it...",1389398400,2,413,4.337662337662338
