8084286,4,B000BB19DU,"This is probably the second best documentary pertaining to bodybuilding that I've ever seen (the honor going to Pumping Iron); with the most impressive line-up of competitors Ive ever seen since Pumping Iron (which featured Arnold Schwarzenegger at his peak, in his six Olympia,  competing against such as Frank Colombo  who pioneered the way for lesser built competitors, and Lou Ferrigno, whose signature Most Muscular Post is still considered the best till this day) such as Jay Cutler, who, three weeks before competition appears just as massive as he does  during competition, with pronounced delts that lack posterior development, well developed if rather small biceps, great triceps that is characterized by deep cuts and is well defined, well developed pects if lacking in symmetry, well defined abs,  well developed thighs characterized by great separation and cuts, and well developed calves; Gunter Schlierkamp -  who possesses nice symmetry, and whose body appears aesthetically pleasing despite being massive, is well defined with deep cuts, who possesses great delts, a massive chest characterized by deep cuts, pronounced neck muscles, nice pects that is just slightly wanting in development, huge arms characterized by large and  well-shaped bicep, but lacks abdominal and thigh development; Kris Dim - who, by right, should have been the winner in the light weight category (with the heavy weight category and overall winner being Jay Cutler), and, as such, lacks the mass which impresses most layman audiences, great delts which, nevertheless, is not quite sufficiently developed, well developed pectorials that is slightly wanting in symmetry, well developed chest that is lacking in mass resultant of his petite stature, well developed triceps, biceps, calves and thighs - the latter of which is characterized by deep separation and cuts; Markus Ruhl and Troy Alves - whose limited number of poses presented during the enumeration of the results exhibit well developed delts, neck muscles, abs and thighs (for the former, which, in itself, does not constitute an in-depth analyses due to the sparscity of poses from which to judge), and the latter possessing nice symmetry that is aesthetically pleasing, with nice pectorials development, nice delts, good thigh development, but rather lacking in neck muscles, chest serration and abdominal development; whose placement that should have been had I been the judge is enumerated sequentially.

The Battle for Mr. Olympia IX 2004, while being one of the most fascinating documentaries covering the training leading up to the Olympia, lacks the competition round, which if it had been included, would have made it a better documentary.

Highly recommended.",1408406400,,2722,5.4336492890995265
