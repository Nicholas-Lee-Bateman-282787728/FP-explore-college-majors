I didn't care about the other 'star power'.  This movie shows that humans are pathetic, abuse-seeking creatures that look for power over others wherever they can get it.  Yuck.  Buy Day Break--that's actually worth buying and watching.",1518307200,,406,4.742857142857143

7896939,4,630589132X,"This isn't a bad movie. It is good to see how twisted and perverted people have become overall, especially in hollywood. The girls having to sell themselves makes me wonder if girls are still running to hollywood to be discovered.",1154563200,2,230,4.775
7896940,4,630589132X,"I do not agree with most of the reviewers here as they are looking for pulp fiction type movie and not real life on the street depiction as this movie is about. I find it moving and very involving involving many characters and the super hot Hillary Swank. She plays a hooker on the street and her acting make it very believeable OMG. Life is not exciting, it is grim for many and this movie shows that. It makes u feel fortunate that you are not walking on the streets of Hollywood or anywhere in your town.
I recommend this for a true life experiance.",1065830400,9,552,4.266666666666667
7896941,1,630589132X,"Let me count the ways:
Bad writing. At first I thought they were trying for a ""Pulp Fiction"" type of wittily semi-meaningless dialogue, then I gave up and decided it was just BAD. Translated from a German screenplay, but this wouldn't be any better auf Deutsch.
Bad direction. The action scenes look like an episode of ""Cops"", the sex scenes look like porn.
Bad acting. Chad Lowe's wall-pounding men's-room rant about some half-explained record company lawsuit is as bizarre as any I have ever seen. Hilary Swank's accent seems to change from Brooklynese in the first scene to Minnesotan in the finale.
Even the squealing guitar music is bad. ...Hilary Swank has come a LONG way from this swill to ""Boys Don't Cry.""",979776000,7,715,4.821138211382114
7896942,1,630589132X,"This was awful. All I can say is if you are a Hilary Swank fan, rent it so you can quit walking past it with curiousity in the video store. Just get  it out of the way and done with. Obviously it's only been released to make  a few bucks out of Swanks's breakthrough in Boys Don't Cry. Her only good  part in the movie is at the end. Chad Lowe is hideous in it, each part  dragged on and on- my fast forward button served me well. Jeez, what a  waste.",967680000,4,451,3.858695652173913
7896943,1,630589132X,"You can always count on some mercenary to take advantage of an actor's success by releasing one of his or her early roles in some worthless B movie.  `Quiet Days In Hollywood' is an abominable ensemble production  produced in 1997 and never released in theaters in the United States (it  saw a limited release in Germany).  It was just released to the video  market with Hilary Swank as the marketing hook.  Actually, despite the fact  that her picture and name dominate the package, Swank has only two limited  appearances in the film.
The film is a series of chain linked sex  vignettes.  Each character has sex with another character and then the  second character moves on to the next vignette and has sex with another who  moves on to another etc., until finally, the circle is complete and the  last character has sex with the first character.  The story has all the  substance of a porn movie, with banal, profanity-riddled dialogue serving  to bridge the gap between sex scenes.  Since the sex scenes were mostly  implied or obscured, even the prurient aspect was limited.
Hillary Swank  plays a hooker on the streets of Hollywood.  She is brash to the point of  stupidity, taunting and insulting dangerous people as if she has some sort  of death wish.  Her performance here is very amateurish and unpolished.  Natasha Gregson Wagner was the only other cast member worth mentioning.  She gave a reasonably good performance as a woman in an open marriage  having sex with one of her husband's employees (the husband knows).
There  is not really much more to say about this sham.  I rated it a 2/10.  Don't  get duped into seeing it as I did just because Swank is on the cover.",964569600,12,1684,4.687285223367698
