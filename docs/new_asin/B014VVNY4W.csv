7425163,5,B014VVNY4W,"An excellent production showcasing the life and values of a brilliant, easy to like and incredibly intelligent and interesting man. I have come away with a new appreciation of the bio sciences. I highly recommend for adult and young adult viewing. The film is beautifully done, education and downright so interesting.",1452124800,3,317,5.235294117647059
7425164,5,B014VVNY4W,"This is a thought-provoking summary of some of Prof. Wilson's ideas and views, and captures a little of his life, of interest to his career, as well.  I think that the visual impact of the various scenes, and the focus on certain ideas and things that he considers to be of particular importance, help one to understand his point of view better.  Some of his ideas about social evolution are subtle.  For example, I think that ""altruism"" gets ""hard-wired"" during a person's development.  This does seem to relate to a group, not just a gene or replicator, level of evolution.  However, I do not understand this well, nor does the film develop adequately some important subtleties.  The film  goes into very little depth, but because it is so focused on a number of very significant aspects of Prof. Wilson's thinking and biography, it is definitely worthwhile to view.",1451001600,3,868,4.824324324324325
7425165,5,B014VVNY4W,Quite simply one of the finest documentaries ever made. Period.  E O Wilson is a complex individual who made sense out of extraordinary human behavior and how it resembles ants.  To be compared with ants is deeply flattering  considering they dominate the earth along with humans. A controversial figure who demonstrates that ridicule is the burden of genius in inventing the field of sociobiology.  Your world will expand after watching this.  As did the world for anyone who worked with Dr. Wilson.,1450310400,2,500,5.048780487804878
7425166,5,B014VVNY4W,"Lovely in all respects.  If you know the name E.O. Wilson, then this is a perfect addition to your intellectual world.",1449878400,,118,4.619047619047619
7425167,5,B014VVNY4W,"The reviews already here express my exact feelings about this program and E.O. Wilson. I would only add that I plan to share this with others. Mmmm, my innate tendency towards cooperation, that sublime usocial capacity? I hope so.",1446595200,,230,4.923076923076923
7425168,5,B014VVNY4W,"Spectacular!  E.O. Wilson is one of the most gentle souls I've ever encountered, yet he's also incredibly smart, thoughtful and analytical.  His hypotheses about the similarities between ant societies and human beings is so well thought out.  This documentary, produced by PBS, is as good as any I've seen.  PBS continues to astound me with their ability to pump out the very best in television.  BRAVO!",1443830400,6,403,5.045454545454546
7425169,5,B014VVNY4W,"""Destroying rainforest for economic gain is like burning a Renaissance painting to cook a meal."" E.O.W.

Ed Wilson had to face violent opposition, demonstrations, lectures and classes picketed at Harvard University since Ed believes that there are general properties of the way that human mind develops and children acquire cultures; where preferences and biases are generally adopted by most people that do have biological nature. Communication gives humans the amazing capacity to cooperate and that is the mystery at the heart social behavior. We are part of the natural world. Our minds and emotions evolve in nature. To understand them, we have to understand that evolution happens right here in this Universe. Cooperation permeates our being. Everything we do, everything we love and find beautiful is the fruit of cooperation. Exclusion makes us suffer, inclusion makes us thrive. So WITHOUT NATURE, how we humans are suppose to be better off eventhough as human we are so capable of the deepest kind of behavior that can create incredible goodness 

One needs to watch 120 minutes of this documentary to relate to the thinking of Ed who has dedicated his life to the issue of humanity and nature. As Mahatma Gandhi used to say Live as you were to die tomorrow, learn as if you were to live forever. Thank you Mr. Wilson for what you have done for us, the human specie and this Blue Planet. Wish you well.",1443830400,11,1412,4.92436974789916

Five stars for sure",1443657600,4,40,3.1
7425171,5,B014VVNY4W,"AMAZING Program. Just watched it on PBS (LOVE PBS by the way) and was glued to the TV the whole time, which rarely happens to me. The documentary covers the concepts of evolution and more specifically natural selection in eusocial organisms. Wilson draws conclusions based on similarities between human and ant societies. Brilliant man and a gentle soul he is. Very engaging and well produced. More programs like this would benefit all of us.",1443571200,13,442,4.986486486486487

8732073,5,B014VVNY4W,"E.O. Wilson is an amazing scientist and entomologist. In this two-hour documentary, he talks about the insect world -- especially ants and their social system, which bears some resemblance to ours. Lots of insights here. While some of the themes are pretty complex, Wilson, with his easy charm, does a good job of making them understandable to the layman.",1503446400,,355,5.033898305084746
