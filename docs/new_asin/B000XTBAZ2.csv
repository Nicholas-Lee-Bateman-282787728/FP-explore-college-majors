Tony Leung Ka Fei is as smooth, oily, and studly as they come in the role of a millionaire mega-horny bad husband. Pauline Lau would not have been my first choice (as an international director!) but she does an adequate job. The story and technical filming are riveting until the third act where things go a bit wobberly, but, nevertheless, I get the idea. You can Not go wrong on this film. It is very different and well done. Chinese films are almost always beautifully made---this manages to be seamy, yet elegant, with desperate, yet smooth characters all around. Bai Ling is a hottie. I recommend this film.",1374278400,,776,4.589928057553957
8229637,2,B000XTBAZ2,"The reality is that this film is not a horror film, nor does it qualify as a thriller either. Its not a mystery certainly. Theres not any gore. No real shock value either compared to most truly shocking films I have seen. I don't really see much about this movie that should earn it any praise at all in fact. I think however they should have chosen a different title like Love and Cannibalism or maybe Sex and human flesh. Though well produced, its simply a sicko story about a woman who wants to look younger than she really is, and resorts to cannibalism to become more youthful after she learns of a retired doctor who has found the fountain of youth by consuming the flesh of aborted fetuses. The movie is not all that creepy like others have claimed, nor is it the least bit scary or horrifying. Its simply a well made chinese movie that doesnt have much to appreciate considering many other truly great films to come out of China over the past 30 years. This move isn't exactly worthless, but beyond some stylish film making there simply isn't much else to expect from this rather dull film.",1367625600,,1098,4.467661691542289
8229638,5,B000XTBAZ2,"Without spoiling the plot, a woman is losing her looks and is in a desperate search for a fountain of youth. Be careful what you wish for!!!

I would've rated this movie NC-17 for graphic depictions of unspeakably horrific acts.  The movie is unnerving and THAT is a gross understatement!

That said don't eat a heavy meal before watching this - one of the greatest foreign films I've ever seen",1317945600,,394,4.6
8229639,4,B000XTBAZ2,"This is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen.  Of course I suspect that it was the director's intention to disturb the audience, so with that assumption in mind, the effort was a resounding success!  I recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach (among other things it contains a clinically graphic depiction of an abortion) and an open mind.",1221868800,3,356,4.634920634920635
