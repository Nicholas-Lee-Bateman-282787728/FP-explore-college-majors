7983693,1,B00008G8PY,"We loved the first season so bought the next 4 seasons, the entire show, all at one time.  A $100 investment.  Season 2 was pretty good, but then they started getting into the weird realm and by season 4 it was just about unwatchable.  Weird vampire type people, etc.  It dragged on and on and never went anywhere.  We ended up just throwing all of it away because of its occultish leanings.  We learned a lesson:  buy one season at a time.  Liquorish",1389484800,3,451,4.349397590361446

7983695,5,B00008G8PY,"Realy great show but don't own this unless Amazon gets it in will not deal with any one else that sells this show, but a great show too watch and worth the wait for if or when Amazon gets it back in. tks",1168387200,,203,3.744186046511628
7983696,4,B00008G8PY,"How can there is not even an English subtitle? Though it doesn't quite stand in the way of my understanding, it still almost drove me mad while I was watching. Many of my friends, who are also hot EFC fans, withdrew their decision of buying it when they knew there wasn't a subtitle. Not everyone's(I mean people from non-English speaking countries like me)English is good enough to understand the show without any means of assistance.",1074470400,13,435,4.8133333333333335
7983697,5,B00008G8PY,"The Fourth Season sees a lot of changes in the show. We see the departure of show regular, Augur. Replacing him as the resident genius is J. Street. The conclusion of the season also sees the ""Final Conflict"" of the Taelon and Jaridian races and opens the way for the arrival of the Atavus race in Season 5. Complete with lots of pictures and extras, this DVD box set is a must for any fan of the show. Beware, allocate plenty of time to watch the whole 6 DVD set! This season ROCKS!!
