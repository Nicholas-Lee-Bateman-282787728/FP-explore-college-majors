7723602,4,B01DRXEP70,"The wuality is really good. I am giving it 4 stars, because we cannot play it in blue ray, only from the laptop, which we connect with the TV set",1469664000,,145,3.8666666666666667
7723603,5,B01DRXEP70,My kids LOVE this show.  Season 1 is on Netflix but I haven't been able to find a way to purchase season 2 in the US.  I was sick of watching season 1 so we ordered season 2 to get a break.  It took a while to get to us but it was worth every penny.  I would love to have a digital copy and blueray.,1467590400,,299,3.484848484848485
7723604,5,B01DRXEP70,"As described, these are English dubbed episodes of Mashable and the Bear (which my daughter absolutely LOVES for some reason). Perfect for what I needed (also so that she doesn't pick up too much Russian - she's already bilingual with English and Mandarin).  Disc shipped quickly.  Make sure you check to see if you need the NTSC (this disc) or PAL format for your DVD player.",1466812800,,376,4.681818181818182
7723605,5,B01DRXEP70,My grandchildren and I  have been watching Masha and the Bear on Netflix. We have watched them together so many times we know all the episodes by heart and never get tired of watching them over and over again :)  I was very happy to find and receive this DVD.  I will need to get PAL compatible devices to watch them on but it is well worth it -- I have not been able to find these DVD's anywhere else.  Seller was very helpful in explaining what PAL and NTSC means so I knew what type device to look for.  This was my first international purchase and I could not be  more satisfied with this seller's assistance and product.,1466035200,2,625,4.2100840336134455
