1784729,5,B00006LHB8,"Both films on this single disc come from the mid-forties when Bob Hope was moving up on Bing Crosby to take the title of top box office attraction. They are funny films cut to Bob's measurement; one out of the drawer labelled 'take-offs on Errol Flynn type films', the other from the one labelled 'Alan Ladd and other tough guys'.Neither makes any claim to significance nor has any objective other than to induce a sufficient quota of laughs. By this time in his career, the radio and film audiences expected nothing more from Bob than what these gave them, rapid fire verbal and physical gags, with a beautiful woman to play second banana. In his early forties, Hope could still convincingly play a young fellow who somehow  stumbles into difficulties but wins the girl in the end. I shouldn't think the absence of color will bother anyone; Hollywood professionals knew how to make it look good.
Admittedly, I have no idea how the growing number of young people who did not grow up with Hope and his style of comedy will take to these films created in a style popular more than 60 years ago. They are, after all, just good clean fun.",1285200000,,1134,4.586206896551724

1784731,4,B00006LHB8,"This double feature starring Bob Hope was a very pleasant surprise. Unlike most of the other Bob Hope double features this one has two very good features. Monsieur Beaucaire is certainly the more famous of the two but Where There's Life is just as good.

Monsieur Beaucaire takes place in 18th century France. Beaucaire (Bob Hope) is a barber to King Louis XV (Reginald Owen) of France. Beaucaire is coerced into taking the place of Duke Dechamps (Patric Knowles). It's not a case of mistaken identity, Dechamps is a playboy, not to mention France's greatest swordsman, & doesn't want to get married. The marriage is an arrangement to ensure peace between France & Spain. As Beaucaire, Dechamps (dressed as a barber) & Count D'Armand (Cecil Kellaway) are on their way to Spain they encounter the Princess that Dechamps is to marry though none of them realize it. Dechamps is more than attracted to the Princess & ends up saving her from kidnappers.

Don Francisco (Joseph Schildkraut) is the villain behind it all. He intends to kill Dechamps which doesn't happen. He finally learns than Dechamps is really Beaucaire & plans to expose this right after the marriage. He wants France & Spain to go to war. The cast also includes the lovely Joan Caulfield as Mimi, Beaucaire's ambitious & duplicitous girlfriend.

Where There's Life has Bob Hope at his cowardly wisecracking best. In fact, for the first 15 minutes, it feels like Hope is doing his script from a radio show (he is a radio announcer in the movie). Michael Valentine (Bob Hope) is set to marry his girlfriend Hazel O'Brien (Vera Marshe) of eight years. Her brother Victor (William Bendix) isn't happy with her decision. To make it all more complicated, an assassination attempt has been made on the King of Borovia & he's not expected to live. His only heir is Michael Valentine who isn't aware of his heritage. The king had traveled to America in 1915 & married his secretary, having Michael Valentine. The marriage was not recognized & the child stayed in America. Now that the king is about to die, Gen. Trina Grimovitch (Signe Hasso) & three ministers from Borovia go to get Valentine. All of this is done because the Mordia (a Black Hand type of organization) want to take over the country & are the ones behind the assassination attempt.

Bob Hope really wisecracks his way through this film. There's the traditional reference to Bing Crosby like in many Hope vehicles. The comedy & Hope are non-stop, the rest of the cast doesn't have a chance. I had never seen this film before (& I'm a major Hope fan!) & found it to be surprisingly good. This might be the best Hope Double Feature package; having two very good movies makes it an outstanding value.",1216512000,3,2719,4.754237288135593
1784732,3,B00006LHB8,"By the mid to late forties, Bob Hope's screen character was an established persona, the cowardly braggart who thinks (hopes) he is irresistable to woman and outwits the heavy by sheer luck.  The challenge for his writers was to come up with some new situation in which he could strut his stuff.

""Monsieur Beaucaire"" places Hope in the court of French King Louis as a barber who becomes embroiled in a scheme to marry a nobleman to Spanish royalty to avert war. Hope plays entirely in a 1940's idiom with topical references, even to Crosby.  This, of course, sounds absurd but it is in fact an hilarious send up of historical swashbucklers. Joan Caulfield is excellent as the object of his affection and the supporting cast are  outstanding. The production values are higher than usual for his films so this therefore becomes one of his best, a classy production in every way.

""Where There's Life"" is a send up of the spy genre of which Hope did a number, starting with ""My Favourite Blonde"". It is quite funny but Signe Hasse is wasted as a Ninotchka type and William Bendix blusters in his typical loud and unattractive way. The film is a lesser production in every way to ""Monsieur Beaucaire"".

The prints of the films are unrestored but just good enough. There are no extras except trailers and some liner notes.",1183248000,7,1317,4.67965367965368
1784733,5,B00006LHB8,"To be honest, I bought this dvd only because of ""Monsieur Beaucaire"", which ties with ""Ghost Breakers"" as my favorite Bob Hope movie. I'd never heard of ""Where There's Life"" & was surprised at how funny it was. Both of these are great classics that the whole family will enjoy. ""Monsieur Beaucaire"", based on the classic novel (of same name) by Booth Tarkington, has Hope playing a court barber, Monsieur Beaucaire, for King Louis XV. He's also hopelessly in love with Mimi (Joan Caulfield), a beautiful chambermaid. The King sentences Beaucaire to be beheaded after causing a ""marital dispute"" between the King & Queen. Mimi, meanwhile, is banished from France, also because of Beaucaire! He is luckily saved from death by the Duc de Chandre, played by Patrick Knowles, said to be one of Hollywood's finest swordsmen of the 30s & 40s. Beaucaire's problems are just beginning, however, as he gets himself into deeper trouble by posing as the Duc de Chandre. Mimi also causes him further trouble, but eventually she forgives him. This wonderful comedy ends with a hilarious swordfight & a cameo by ""George Washington""! ""Where There's Life"" has Hope playing Michael Valentine, a guy who's life is changed forever when it's discovered that he's a long-lost heir of a kingdom. Soon he has spies, assasins, & two women fighting over him! This movie has enough gags to keep virtually anyone entertained from start to finish. There's also great comic support from William Bendix, who plays his typical ""dumb cop"" character to perfection! If you're a fan of Bob Hope, then this dvd is a definite must!",1100131200,17,1593,4.925650557620818
1784734,5,B00006LHB8,"""Monsieur Beaucaire"" (1946), this is Bob Hope at a top performance for a Costume Comedy at the style of ""The princess & the pirate"". The action occurs in the courts of France and Spain, nations on the verge of war. Bob Hope is Monsieur Beaucaire, the King Louis XV's barber forced to impersonate a duc named Le Chandre, or lose his head. At the same time, in Madrid, the traitorus Don Francisco commander of the spanish Army, wants to prevent the upcoming marriage of Le Chandre with Maria (a Spanish princess) and plans eliminate a Bob Hope, in order to destabilize the crown, unleashing a war between the countries. At the end, we see a Bob avoid the homicidal plans with lots of comic situations and gags. Very very Funny!
""Where There's Life"" (1947), a year later Bob had a royal performance, when he is convinced by the General Katrina Grimovitch (Signe Hasso) that he is the heir of Barovia, and must ascend to the throne in order to let organized the fist democratic election in the country avoiding that an evil organization take the control. Of course this is a good excuse
for persecutions and gags of all kind. Very funny (only?).
This double feature disc represents a good value for Hope's fans and for all who want an inexpesive laugh now or later.",1059436800,18,1261,4.608888888888889
