4370983,5,B004FS5JK4,"Doodle-Baby is the good morning, feeding time, sleeping time and in between times of my baby.
I got it as a gift, It's with no Language, only wonderfull images and outstanding animation with beutifull pleasent music. My baby doesn't get tired of it, he keeps laughing and being fascinated by thius DVD. If you have a baby- it's a MUST!",1318982400,,335,4.6
4370984,3,B004FS5JK4,"My 1 yr old son loved the train animation posted on You Tube. So I bought this DVD thinking there would be more of the funny animations. Unfortunately it wasn't as much fun. I must say the animations are great. But do not really tell a 'story' like the train does. At first my son totally rejected this DVD but after watching a couple times, he pays attention. He does not like it but watches it for a while. I won't say this was a waste of money but isn't money's worth either - at least in my case.",1318550400,,500,4.0606060606060606
4370985,3,B004FS5JK4,"I had a a Doodle Baby traler from Youtube which my 1-year old daughter liked a lot. However, the rest of stuff didn't impress her, she got bored and didn't watch the DVD completely.",1317254400,,181,4.352941176470588
4370986,5,B004FS5JK4,"She could not stop looking and giggling....what else can I say?
She is the best critic if you know what I mean.
I actually found a few YouTube snippets of it before I got it.
A must have IMO.",1311552000,3,191,3.923076923076923
4370987,5,B004FS5JK4,"I brought this DVD after my baby absolutely loved watching the train clip on you tube.

At first I was a little disappointed as only a few of the animation clips are of this style, and my baby only liked a few of the clips. I brought this when my baby was 7 months old.

By the time my baby was 9 months he loved watching this DVD, it came in handy when I needed to wash dishes or something as he did not like me going further than a few meters from him, I would put him in the high chair watching the TV (I can see him from the kitchen)

It turned out to be a lifesaver as I had to start going to physical therapy 3 times a week. I took a little portable DVD player with me and he sat in the stroller and watched it intently. I did this for months.

I now take it with me when I have a dentist appointment etc. I do not play it often in the house and use it as an attention grabber for the times I really need it. He is now 16 months and still loves it. My neighbors little girl who is almost 2 also loves watching it.

Although it is quite a short runtime for the price, I think overall it is money worth spending.",1369267200,,1116,3.813852813852814
4370988,5,B004FS5JK4,"I have 4 month old grandson, and he loves watching this. It's almost hypnotict to little kids, check it out on youtube.",1368748800,,119,4.454545454545454
4370989,5,B004FS5JK4,"This DVD really lights up my daughter especially the song with the train, We found this on You tube and we decided to buy the DVD so we have the whole thing, absolutely worth it. It is best for infants, would be too simple for toddlers",1368230400,,235,4.130434782608695
4370990,5,B004FS5JK4,"This is the hands down favorite  (4-5 month old grand child).  It gets watched over and over and the child never seems to tired of it. I only wish the train video was longer or that there were more train videos (child's favorite).  Sorry for the generic reference. I don't wish to provide too much detail about my personal family.

I gave it five stars because its the best, not because I have any affection for it (their reference love it)

If you have babies, this is one video you need to consider for you personal collection. You will not regret purchasing this video for a baby to watch.",1365120000,,592,4.394495412844036
4370991,5,B004FS5JK4,My five month old son loves this! We watch it over and over again. Very stimulating for baby... catches and holds their attention!,1354060800,,130,4.695652173913044
4370992,4,B004FS5JK4,"I found the train animation on YouTube and my 10 months old daughter just loved it! She would giggle, dance, and just smile with it. So, I decided to buy the DVD. However, there are a bunch of animations that show animals been drawn that just don't catch her attention. I was looking for more cartoons like the train one but was disappointed to find only a few. Out of the entire DVD she likes three cartoons: the train ride, the birds, and the bumble bees one. So $12 for only three it's a high price in my opinion. Although I'm disappointed, hearing her giggle and watching how happy she gets with these three cartoons is worth the four starts.",1348185600,,646,4.391666666666667
4370993,2,B004FS5JK4,the trailer on u-tube was the catch. my grandson (17 months)loved the happy train picking up passengers and going on its way. I ordered the cd thinking it would have more of the same but found a sequence of dull sketches that left a lot to desire. My grandson ignored it completely at first and now just waits for the train portion which is at the very end of the cd and only last but a minute. I would have liked to ask for a refund but hate to go thru the trouble.,1347753600,,466,4.021505376344086
4370994,5,B004FS5JK4,"As grandparents of a 2 1/2 year old and a 6 month old, we picked up a copy of Doodle Baby at our library. Strangely, we found both kids become absolutely entranced by it whenever we turn it on. As an added bonus, the soundtrack is pleasant and peaceful. We bought three copies.",1343779200,,277,4.245283018867925
4370995,5,B004FS5JK4,"I tend to dislike most infants viedo clips - the loud music and crude graphics drives me mad.
It's rare to find quality content for this age, and this one's certainly a keeper!
My 10-months-old boy enjoys it tremendously, and at last I can watch it with him and enjoy as well, without wishing for him to get bored and go do something else...
If they make a sequel I'm sure to buy it as well - worth every cent.",1321142400,,410,4.1375
4370996,5,B004FS5JK4,"Wow!
The animation is great.
The look&feel and the flowing pace are unlike anything I've seen before - the perfect baby-material!
I loved the fact that it's not a story-telling video (That's MY job...), but still -
Itamar (1+3m) momentarily connected to the hearty, lovable characters.
(And I may have helped with some joint gigs we have, and a song we sing in the baby-elephant scene
:-)
A real gem!",1319846400,,400,4.728571428571429
8428256,5,B004FS5JK4,"I bought the Doodle Baby DVD when my oldest was a baby and it is surprisingly still a favorite in our house with both our 6 and 3 year old. Even my 6 year old still enjoys the calm music and slow pace. It often gives us a very soothing break when we've had a rough day. I'll put it on ""in the background"" and my very tired 3 year old will get sucked in an fall asleep on the couch. Doodle Baby has become the magic bullet of nap lullabies. THANK YOU DOODLE BABY!!!  We'd still love a second volume if it ever appears.",1489017600,,517,3.9238095238095236
8428257,5,B004FS5JK4,"Love it, so simple yet enchanting, my 10 month old grandson was mesmerized. Was able to rent for week I was with him and let him watch to calm him down, he loved it!",1440892800,,165,3.8823529411764706

8428261,3,B004FS5JK4,I didn't care for this too much and it didn't seem to grab my child's attention either,1405123200,,86,4.117647058823529
8428262,5,B004FS5JK4,"Baby likes it, very good cartoon for infanats. The part with the train is the best. The dvd has a special feature, drawing sheets can be printed.  Fast delivery",1381881600,,160,4.517241379310345

8428264,5,B004FS5JK4,This video is awesome! My four month old loves it! I give it 5 stars for sure! Its one of the only videos that can hold his attention.,1377734400,,134,3.8214285714285716
8428265,5,B004FS5JK4,"We love this DVD at my house. A babysitter discovered the clips of the train and the birds on YouTube, and our little guy loved them so much, we bought the DVD. I could wish the DVD included a couple more vignettes like the train and the birds, but this is still our favorite toddler DVD by far. Our two year old loves it and every grown-up who's seen it at our house (parents, grandparents, babysitters) likes it too. It's very pleasant to hear in the background while you're cooking dinner or attempting other chores. It's sweet but not cloying. Bright images, fun music, gentle pacing. I'm just disappointed to discover that there isn't a Volume 2! I hope it's in the works; we would buy it immediately.",1375833600,,706,4.5234375
