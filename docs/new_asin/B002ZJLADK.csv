4041004,1,B002ZJLADK,"First and foremost, this is NOT a Pink Floyd Produced Video!  Delicate Sound of Thunder was by far MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE VHS and could not wait for it to come out on DVD.  Well, it still has not come out on DVD.  It is a poor reproduction from some ramshackle opreation in South America.  I cannot remember where it was shipped from but I beleive it was Argentina or something like that.  All instructions are in spanish, and it would not play on the DVD on my computer, and froze up on the DVD player in my main living room console.  If you have seen the original...it is an exact reproduction, just very dark and not good quality.  The one positive is that I have a very high end audio system, and it did sound quite well, but the video itself was very poor.",1276473600,49,759,4.229166666666667
4041005,1,B002ZJLADK,If you are expecting to be viewing a dvd better than the VHS you will be disapointed.  This appears to be just a bad copy of the original VHS and a poor one at that.  The dvd has distortion in the recording and is darker than the VHS.  Check and see if you can find an actual release date for delicate sounds of thunder on dvd..i doubt you will find one.,1269043200,55,354,3.9577464788732395

4041037,1,B002ZJLADK,"Do NOT buy!

My VHS has better fidelity and picture quality.

VERY disappointed Amazon would carry such a product.

Not going to waste more original thought on this execration of a fine concert recording.",1373241600,,204,4.9411764705882355
4041038,5,B002ZJLADK,"The DVD was great. Some reviews complained about it being a poor copy,but if you watched the orignal video as many times as I have, you would know that the DVD was as good of quality as the viedo.",1368403200,,196,4.051282051282051
4041039,5,B002ZJLADK,"I love this concert, I can't comment on the DVD vs. VHS, I did watch the DVD and I enjoyed it. I have always been a Pink Floyd fan. My first Pink Floyd concert was Wish You Were Here after that I had to see all of their concerts They are the best and I was hooked. For all of you that loves Pink Floyd and miss their concerts go for it, nothing is like being there live at the concert, this is second and this is the only way you'll be able to see it again and as many times as you want. I am disappointed that there was on booklet with this DVD.",1368057600,,546,3.756521739130435
4041040,3,B002ZJLADK,This dvd played on my dvd player although the quality of the recording is poor. In 1990 I would like to think the technology would have recorded this better.,1367712000,,157,4.448275862068965
4041041,5,B002ZJLADK,"One of the most amazing concerts on DVD you'll ever see! The best editing of a concert that I know of, if you like Pink, this will blow you away! The greatest visual, and audio production of any of the Pink Floyd concerts... ever!",1366243200,,230,4.25
4041042,5,B002ZJLADK,This is my favorite concert by Pink Floyd. I listen to this every morning and now have all the floyd and Gilmour CD's,1364688000,,117,4.130434782608695

4041044,2,B002ZJLADK,overall quality of the production is poor  the start up screens language is not in English  and it doesn't hold my interest. If I had previewed this before purchasing it I would not have  purchased it .,1362787200,3,202,4.405405405405405
4041045,1,B002ZJLADK,The quality of the picture is very poor. It looked like a counterfeited DVD. I am upset because the DVD is one of my favorite. The title is Pink Floyd Live in Nassau New York 1990 (Delicate Sound of Thunder).,1359936000,2,208,4.225
4041076,1,B002ZJLADK,"Why paying for this bootleg if it can be downloaded for free?
I own the VHS and I'm sure my transfer to digital has a lot more quality than this.",1358812800,7,145,3.8666666666666667
4041077,4,B002ZJLADK,Good performance and good recording.  We are enjoying our boys very much.  We highly advise if you are a PF fan!,1358035200,,112,4.285714285714286
4041078,3,B002ZJLADK,Because this was one of the most brilliant concerts of all time - I expected much higher quality.  The picture was grainy/blurry and the sound quality was average.  No choice of Surround>.,1356825600,4,188,4.84375
4041079,5,B002ZJLADK,"I saw this concert live in Dallas in 1989, it it the best of Pink Floyd. Of course there's no Roger Waters here, but that's his loss. This is the best of Pink Floyd.",1356652800,,165,3.8823529411764706
4041080,5,B002ZJLADK,I have been looking for the Video for a long time. I am glad I finally found it. I first saw it years ago and I still enjoy it today.,1354060800,,133,3.466666666666667
4041081,2,B002ZJLADK,I saw the concert live and bought the VHS copy when it came out. I saw this Product for sale and assumed it would be of better quality I was wrong. Audio is not bad but Video is fuzzy and hard to make out. I wood not recomend this product instead try to find VHS if possible.,1347667200,,275,3.8421052631578947
4041082,1,B002ZJLADK,"I have been Amazon's customer for several years. It's the first time, ever, that I had a problem. The DVD is FAKE. It's not an original record. Looks like somebody tape it from a tv screen, with a camera. VERY DISAPOINTED!!!!!!",1344384000,5,227,4.560975609756097

Having lived for many years on a bootlegged DVD of this tour I was highly impressed by the excellent quality of sound and picture on this DVD. Images are sharp, colours deep and sound quality just top!

Can't wait to see how the ""Would you buy a ticket to this show"" compares.

If you are looking for an older Pink Floyd of high quality reproduction then go no further than here, it is a perfect partner for the later ""Pulse"" DVD release",1338768000,4,687,6.061855670103093
4041084,5,B002ZJLADK,"I have been searching 10 years for this concert which first came out on vhs. Glad i found this dvd copy on amazon well worth the price,took about 10 days  via mail. Thanks",1331596800,2,171,4.181818181818182
4041085,3,B002ZJLADK,"I already had this concert on VHS and was hoping for something higher in quality. The concert is the same; only in 2.1 sound, and the setup and case is in ??Spanish, from Peru, IIRC.",1310860800,19,182,4.228571428571429

8385111,5,B002ZJLADK,it's a pity we don't get a Higher resolution of this show. It brings me memories of the day of my ever first visit to New York where I went just to watch this show in August 1988,1417996800,,178,3.710526315789474

8385114,1,B002ZJLADK,"So that alone is reason to be suspicious, this is bootleg you should avoid.  (The Delicate Sound Of Thunder *was* shot there in 1988, but has not been officially released on DVD, only VHS and Laserdisc.)",1390608000,,203,4.638888888888889
8385115,4,B002ZJLADK,"My favorite Pink Floyd concert, but difficult to obtain in DVD format. This version has reasonably good sound quality and acceptable, but not particularly good video -- but the price was OK all things considered. Shipment from Argentina was delayed by problems beyond the control of the vendor, who was considerate enough to inform me of the problems and delays by email.",1389052800,,371,5.0
8385116,5,B002ZJLADK,"This DVD replaced an old VHS I had of this concert in a different venue. Quality of course is better & handier to use.
I love it & continue to love you guys as an extremely broad source for my music video desires.

NOTE I have what is showing as a delivered order, separate from this. It HAS NOT BEEN DELIVERED. I'll advise of details separately if I can wrestle thru your system.

8385117,5,B002ZJLADK,Ok Pink Floyd Fans - Delicate Sounds of Thunder is one of their best concert tours ever. This is a must have disc.,1379548800,,114,4.0
8385118,4,B002ZJLADK,This is an older concert from the tour they were on the last time I saw them live. THis is the 1st time I've found it on dvd so I was very pleased with it,1379203200,,154,3.4285714285714284
8385119,5,B002ZJLADK,"This DVD is a mere inkling of what was experience sitting in the seat at a Pink Floyd show. For manny, Pink Floyd is just an awesome musical hallucinatory experience.  For a few that really know what the secret message is, every song of Pink Floyd is connected strands to a story about a guitar player that sold his soul to the devil to be a rock star and tortures him self to death in a hotel room.  There's a kid who had a big hallucination. Making love to girls in magazines.  He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith.  Could anybody love him. Or is it just a crazy dream? And if I show you my dark side, Will you still hold me tonight? (From The Final Cut-The Final Cut/1983).  The Wall is its centerpiece.  Listen to the man who raves at his wall.  Making the shape of his question to Heaven (From Set the Controls to the Heart of the Sun-A Saucerful of Secrets/1968) Who calls the tune in the court room? (From Free Four-Obscured by Clouds/1972) ""Making a date for later by phone, and if your alone Ill come home. (From San TropezMeddle/1971: Surprise, surprise surprise!).  We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud.. Tomorrow brings another town and another girl like you. (From Summer 68-Atom Heart Mother/1970; Dirty Women).  Most think Pink Floyd is a drug oriented band. Well, you can trust them.  But, you have to pay VERY CLOSE attention to the lyrics to understand the secret message weaved throughout the songs connecting them into one story that climaxes with the wall.  What are they whispering in Julias Dream?  Why would they be whispering that? What did you dream, its alright we told you what to dream.",1376870400,,1647,4.508417508417509
