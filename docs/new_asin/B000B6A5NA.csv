8082275,5,B000B6A5NA,"Benise proves he is a talented musician. For anyone who has not experienced the raw talent of Mr. Benise, this is an introductory DVD.

Benise invites his audience to experience the romance, the passion, and beauty of Spanish Guitar.

Benise is accompanied by various artists from flamenco dancers to a Cirque du Soleil performer to join him in celebrating the true fire of Spanish music.

With a talented band, every song can be felt with the heart.

Roni Benise has the ability to touch an audience and that is clearly shown in this DVD. One can see audience members dancing and having the time of their lives.

I personally enjoyed this DVD and highly recommend to anyone who can appreciate true talent at its finest.

Roni Benise is here to stay!",1149724800,3,750,4.687022900763359
8082276,2,B000B6A5NA,"I bought a copy of this DVD from Amazon and I have the impression that it is a pirate copy.  The sound is very bad and the DVD itself looks like a copy made at home.  Even the label in the box is of poor quality, so you better look for this elsewhere, but not at Amazon.",1146614400,,270,3.719298245614035
8082277,4,B000B6A5NA,"I tripped across this performace on a Public Television special in the new year - couldn't turn the channel.  Love this type of latin guitar music and mood.  The sets, dancers, and music were a pleasure to watch and listen to...perhaps not for the hard-corps flaminco fan, but Benise's style and appeal reach a wide audience who normally wouldn't seek out this music.  Found it sexy and smart in the overall package of the performace and entertaining to watch.",1142553600,7,460,4.7974683544303796
8082278,2,B000B6A5NA,"Reminds me of a Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas, but nowhere near as good. Musicians will wince when they watch & hear Roni play, he just isn't a very good guitar player,
If you want a great Nouveau Flamenco dvd, this isn't it, I wouldnt even call it Nouveau Flamenco, try Strunz and Farah, Jesse Cook or Del Castillo, all incredible!

I see people say this is flamenco, Benise is flamenco music about as much as Pink Floyd is Hip Hop, real flamenco is Manitas De Plata, Sabicas, Melchor De Marchena, Carlos Montoya etc & today's great master Paco De Lucia not this!",1136160000,15,565,4.4326923076923075
