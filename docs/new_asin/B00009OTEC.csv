7992331,4,B00009OTEC,"I have to disagree with the earlier reviewer that this marionette version is a good introduction for kids. Don Giovanni is not for kids, plus Sir Peter Ustinov's annoying commentary includes numerous sexual innuendos, and finally, there are no subtitles. The last 2 is the reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. This DVD could have been a good introduction for grown-up novices, but again, the absence of subtitles defeats that purpose. So, what is it good for? To me, the value of this production lies in bringing visual dimension to a great performance, otherwise available only in audio format. After all, this is an opera, and needs to be seen, as well as listened to. In that regard, the DVD fulfills its purpose, and is highly enjoyable. The cuts are judiciously made, so that the music is still there.
Salzburg Marionette Theater produced 4 more Mozart operas, all available on DVD, separately or as a set. Counting this one, they are: Don Giovanni, Marriage of Figaro, Cosi fan Tutte, Magic Flute, and Abduction from the Seraglio. All are musically outstanding performances. Anyway, 4 out of 5 is not bad.

7992332,5,B00009OTEC,"This is an excellent version of Mozart's Don Giovanni.  The singing is wonderful, the Marionettes and their acting is stupendous.  The humor, often lacking in regular productions of Don Giovanni, is very amusing.  My father, an opera fan, showed it to my 5 year old son, who cannot get enough of it since then.  Not that he sees the whole opera from beginning to end, but has basically watched all of it already in parts, repeating some parts multiple times. It is excellent entertainment for both the refined opera fan and maybe the best introduction to opera for others, especially for children.  I would not have believed it until I witnessed it myself.  Cannot comment on Peter Ustinov's commentary, because I simply skimmed over it, but it is definitely only for adults (too complex, some slight sexual inuendos), which is fine.  An additional feature is an excellent short documentary on the Salzburg Marionette's which is very interesting.",1359504000,3,946,4.987261146496815
