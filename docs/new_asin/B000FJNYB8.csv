If you like movies that are so bad they're good, do yourself a favor and watch Solar Adventure. It's the best part anime, part live action South Korean Propaganda film about children in transformers-esque suits fighting the aliens helping the North Korean communists film ever made. The dub and animation are both hilariously awful. If what I've said hasn't convinced you to see this movie yet, maybe it isn't for you. Highly recommend to any fan of bad movies.",1426118400,,580,4.586538461538462

For the record, the description on the box has honestly nothing to do with the film. This is in some ways a failed attempt at a Korean anime. The dubbing is terrible and the animation quality falters all over the place. However, this film in my opinion is a great movie to watch with a couple of friends so you all can laugh your asses off. At no point should you ever take this movie seriously, or else you'll be disappointed. I would also like to add that, although I do not personally condone this, but watching this film under the influence of any sort of substance may be a gut busting extravaganza. So wrapping things up, I'll leave you with what I think sums up the hook for this movie that will make you want to grab it right away:

1. Giant Robots
2. Aliens
3. North Korean communist killing South Korean children

As long as you don't take this movie seriously, you'll have a great time. Also, the movie starts off with live action which turns out to be a big treat! Although the opening credits are a bit long to get through, but it is worth watching the whole thing. Like Monty Python and The Holy Grail's opening credits.",1345766400,,1292,4.31275720164609
