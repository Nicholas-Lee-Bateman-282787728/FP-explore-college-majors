4013257,4,B002YJKDAM,"This DVD didn't produce any ""Aha"" moments or have any compelling storyline.  It was a simple look at a pleasant connection between two disparate communities - low-tech aviation and farming.  The images were beautiful and the relationships were heartwarming, but there was nothing in the film that would cause me to watch it a second time.  I mailed it off to another flying friend when I was done.",1304208000,,397,4.8088235294117645
4013258,5,B002YJKDAM,"I worked with Andrew in years past, and bought this mainly to see what he's been up to. I thought the idea for the film was good, and wasn't disappointed. He brings back the flavor of the golden age of barnstorming and shows how you can still enjoy the remnants of it. Highly recommended for those who still feel the fun and romance of aviation.",1303948800,,345,4.323076923076923
4013259,4,B002YJKDAM,"Kids will love this because of the flying, I mean what kid doesn't love planes.  Adults will love it because of the story of friendship after a chance meeting.  Thumbs Up!",1287187200,,171,4.483870967741935
4013260,5,B002YJKDAM,"Barnstorming is a remarkable video full of wonderful characters and beautiful planes. Paul Glenshaw and Bryan Reichardt tell the true story of a group of barnstorming pilots and the people who flocked to fields to see them.

The film traces an accidental friendship that develops between two antique airplane pilots and an eastern Indiana farm family they literally dropped in on one day, back in 1999.  The farm family invites the pilots back and they took the family up on the invitation.  Their visit is now an eagerly anticipated annual event and party attended by a growing number of townspeople.

It is a wonderful and touching video.  I have watched it many times and see a different aspect every time. Great flying and pilot talk set in the Heartland of Indiana. If you haven't had a chance to view it - treat yourself.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flying-Boats-Spies/dp/0979085721/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flying Boats & Spies</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-Clipper-a-Nick-Grant-Adventure/dp/097908573X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China Clipper, a Nick Grant Adventure</a>",1286582400,,1176,6.464968152866242

8384244,4,B002YJKDAM,This movie made me want to go from town to town promoting the freedom and joy flying brings. I'd have to add my tailwheel endorsement first!,1451347200,,140,4.423076923076923
8384245,5,B002YJKDAM,"What a lovely film! I recorded it when a local PBS station was showing it, and must have watched it a dozen times over the past few years. And each time, it brought a lump to my throat and tears to my eyes. I want to keep this film around,  so I now have the DVD on order.

And I don't think you need to have any particular interest in airpcraft or aviation to enjoy it; in fact, it really is a first-rate slice of Americana and a loving look at a slowly vanishing way of life in America's heartland.

All the current offers for this DVD on Amazon are awfully pricey. So is this film worth it? Oh yes, absolutely!  But you could also check out its website (barnstormingmovie.com), where you can still buy it direct from its original producers for $9.99 plus S&H. That's what I did.",1437523200,,781,4.221476510067114

8384247,5,B002YJKDAM,"You will be unprepared for the sore muscles felt in your face the day after watching this documentary film as a direct result of the most continual smiling you will have done in recent memory.  This adventure is touching beyond the special bond shared by those associated with aviation, and should be enjoyed by all who watch it.  Many will even forget this is a recent film, instead they may actually feel that they have travelled back to a more memorable time reminiscent of  their own early life of cherished family values, that included a child's imagination.  If you do not have streaming capability( the DVD rarely is in stock) a simple Internet search will allow you to find a disc copy for sale. A film to truly cherish.",1394064000,,728,4.62015503875969
8384248,3,B002YJKDAM,"This is a good reminder of the great folks you meet when you land someplace new. I wish everyone could get that feeling but it really is something you have to learn first hand; a movie isn't quite going to do it.

It is a nice show about a lot of nice people.",1374883200,,259,3.8867924528301887
8384249,5,B002YJKDAM,"It's hard to watch this movie and not be charmed.  There's an elegant simplicity to this story about airplane pilots who unexpectedly appear out of the sky, land in a field, and end up becoming lasting friends with the surprised farmer and his family in the process.  The music is especially wonderful.",1363737600,,302,4.788461538461538
8384250,5,B002YJKDAM,"I know this story inside and out and will admit that I was part of the team that created it.  But even though I wrote the music for Barnstorming, I truly love this film and think we need more like it . Of all the projects I've been a part of, this one is my favorite. I NEVER got sick of watching the heart-warming scenes over and over while writing the score. The story of friendship forged, the salt of the earth people involved (whom I now know), and every moment is a joy to watch.  It's goodness and fun are inspirational and because of it I created some of the best music I've ever written. (Soundtrack is available on CD by the way! ; )",1337472000,,643,4.095238095238095
8384251,5,B002YJKDAM,"This film brought back many good memories of my high school years in Civil Air Patrol. The Piper Cub/J-3/L-16 was especially evocative, as I learned to fly in that basic, fun craft. We ran across this program on our local PBS station, and had to have it.

Thanks for bringing back memories:
Pottering along above the everyday world;
Storytelling with the old World War II and Korea vets;
Preparing tubs of food for fly-in guests;
Making hard calls on the bombing range;
Directing traffic around a crowded airfield.

You really can't know that world unless you've been there, but this comes close.",1309737600,,596,4.833333333333333
