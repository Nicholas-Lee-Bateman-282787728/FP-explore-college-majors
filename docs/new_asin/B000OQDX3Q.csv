2799117,3,B000OQDX3Q,"If you have an ardent appetite to see those legendary music hall revues from la belle epoque as staged in Paris, the musical capital of the world at that time, you can't miss this film. It is one spectacular revue after another with themes that go from ""Cinderella"" to ""orgies"", from Mexico to Spain to ""mad Paris"", from ""April's Fool"" to ""Christmas"" each revue more dynamic than the last, all deserving standing ovations. If you are only looking to see La Baker don't bother. She only has a small segment although the energy and passion she displays in her dancing might justify the price of this DVD. My main problem with ""Las Revues"" is three fold. 1) The boring throw-away story line that connects the musicals 2) The horrible rock-jazz-whatever soundtrack that has nothing to do with the visuals  3) The impresively amazing quality of all musicals which, after a while, becomes old hat. Yes, it might sound weird but the magnificence of each revue paired against each other becomes quite trying after a while. Maybe is the damned music, maybe too much glitter, maybe the tinted film... I can't place it but there's something crooked when it doesn't keep us interested or entertained from beginning to end. I dare venture that maybe if they had included more performances by the popular entertainers of the time it would had made all the difference. Imagine seeing the greats of the era like, Mistinguet, Chevalier, Raquel Meller, etc. and more of La Baker of course. It would have added a lot of personality to the proceedings. But if you can live with a bunch of nameless performers dancing their asses off in glitter costumes this could be your cup of tea. Drink it to your health.",1338249600,2,1688,4.741496598639456
2799118,4,B000OQDX3Q,"... but worth it.

The nominal story really just strings together a bunch of cabaret dance routines. I find them interesting mostly as historical artifacts, a look back in history at the styles of the 1920s - in particular, the body styles that of the dancers. That look emphasized soft curves and a sturdy figure, quite unlike the willowy shapes that predominate today.

That's not why I was interested in this movie. Josephine Baker was the real draw. She appears for only a few moments, though, in two solo routines. Short though they are, they're worth it. She was a magnificent athlete! And, if you think that break-dancing was a relatively recent innovation, dating back only to the 1980s or 1990s, this will be an eye-opener. She clearly shows that its roots go back more than fifty years.

I don't recall seeing Baker's work before. I'm going to see a lot more of it, I promise.

2799119,3,B000OQDX3Q,"The stunning visuals are ruined by the jarring and incongruent modern musical score which is dominated by droning rock rhythms that fail horribly to sync with the motion on screen. I recommend watching it with the sound turned OFF, or accompanied by a Jazz CD from the era of the film. It is hard to comprehend why anyone would choose to mar this classical footage by paring it with such an inappropriate soundtrack. Modern music could have worked beautifully if it had been done with any sensitivity to the piece itself, and written to accompany and support the segments of the film.",1215043200,4,584,4.735294117647059
2799120,3,B000OQDX3Q,"More interesting than engaging. Certainly the only ""silent"" musical I've ever seen. The title ""La Revue des Revues"" is quite accurate. It's really more a series of filmed musical numbers than an actual movie although as noted by others, it does have a nominal plot.  I found the modern jazz score disconcerting, but I suppose trying to match the dance routines to actual 20's music was too hard to attempt. The dance routines lack the flash and polish of the later Busby Berkely movies, a fair number of these folks would have been cut during the tryouts in ""42nd Street"", but many of the dance numbers remain fascinating to watch and some are fairly eccentric. And then, of course, there's the great Josephine Baker. Even though she is in only 2 numbers, she is indeed the primary reason to watch this film. Alas, none of her famous ""banana costume"" numbers, but she is infintely more alive than any other dancer in this film. It's not hard to understand how she captivated her European audience.",1181174400,17,997,4.7298850574712645
2799121,5,B000OQDX3Q,"""La Revue des Revues"" must surely count as one of the most unusual and perhaps unique films from the silent era, being more of a 1927 cabaret show than an actual traditional silent film.  In fact, you could well be excused for thinking that you are watching a contemporary albeit somewhat other-worldly music and dance show most of the time, thanks to the Pathe stencil technique used to colour the twenty or so revue scenes in this 100-minute film.  Coming just a few years after an entire full-length film was colourized in this time-consuming Pathe stencil process, namely for ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", the colourful dance scenes in ""La Revue des Revues"" are definitely the highlight of this film even today,  of a century later.  Unlike filming in colour using coloured filters, the stencil process gives the picture a soft, pastel tone like watercolour which is easy on the eye while also giving it a touch of the surreal.  This is especially notable in the gold and other shimmery metallic colours of some costumes and curtains.  There are opening title cards introducing the name of each revue as well as the names of the performers so that watching this film is really like stepping back into time to experience the famous (or infamous!) Jazz Age of `gay Paris' in its notorious nightclubs of 1927.  The modern-sounding original musical score is Jazz in many varying styles, and although not authentic from that period, is still quite well suited to the dances, setting and overall mood.  No doubt it will have varied reactions from viewers and might take some getting used to at first, especially when it accompanies the rest of the actual silent film, but it might become more acceptable when viewed as something of an historic time capsule capturing the essence of the nightclub shows in Paris 80 years ago.  Personal musical tastes aside, the many spectacular and colourful dance scenes, often with outrageous hats and costumes, are really something to see, as well as being an education in general, and surely also a treat especially for those interested in dance and entertainment.

One note of disappointment might be the misleading credits which give the impression that the highest paid music hall entertainer, Josephine Baker, features prominently in this film, while in fact she only appears in two rather short revues that appear over an hour into the film.  Even so, it is worth the wait to see what all the fuss was about, and why this long-legged, exotic dark beauty became such a huge star.  Some of her unusual dance moves are slightly reminiscent of Michael Jackson's `moonwalk'.  The main character in the actual film - which are the black & white scenes with intertitles - stars a blonde actress named Helene Hallier who plays the role of an average young woman working a dull job in a clothes factory but dreams of being on stage one day.  She gets her big break when her small feet are the right size for some Cinderella-style slippers, and just like the fairytale, she finds love and success thereafter, but not before a few little hiccups.  The actual story is rather short and superficial, and basically only serves as the foundation to present the many varied revue shows, long and short, exotic, bizarre and amusing, but always thoroughly entertaining and surely also fascinating for us in our day to see these shows pretty much as they were back in 1927.  It is for this reason, its unique nature and beautifully coloured `blast from the past' that I give this DVD 5 stars.",1179964800,26,3505,4.826377295492487
2799122,4,B000OQDX3Q,"...42ND STREET and Busby Berkeley, the Goldwyn Girls, and any other backstage musical on film that you can think of can be found in LA REVUE. What makes it so intriguing is that this is a SILENT musical. That may sound like an oxymoron but it really isn't. The lavish stagings and the incredible variety of costumes not to mention the performances of Josephine Baker, Stanislawa Welska, Lila Nikolska, and others were meant to be seen as well as heard.

This being a silent film, it's been provided with musical accompaniment, a brand new score by Taranta-Babu. Unfortunately I found the jazz style used too modern in tone which does not reflect the period and as a result I felt it detracted from the film as a whole but not enough to put me off and the quieter parts were quite effective. The plotline is your typical small time girl makes good although here they literally incorporate the story of CINDERELLA as the heroine gets her big break by winning ""the smallest foot in France"" contest which involves trying on a slipper. Helene Hallier is engaging as the chorus girl but the male lead Andre Luguel is stiff and colorless with too much makeup although to be fair that was typical of that type of part during this period.

As the title promises though LA REVUE DES REVUES is all about the stagings of which there are over a dozen. Scenes from the Moulin Rouge, the Palais and the Folies Bergere are captured on film for posterity reflecting the Art Deco style and the bizarre tastes of 1927 Paris (see The Orgies and The Golfer numbers). According to the liner notes it took 10 years and over 7 different prints to come up with this version which is tinted and features the Pathe' hand stencilled color process although a lot of it looks as if it were computer colored. As a historical document it's priceless (seeing rows of full figured showgirls going through their paces instead of today's stick figures would make Kate Winslet proud) but as entertainment it won't be everyone's cup of tea.

The love story is routine and parts of the film are badly paced but when the curtain goes up just sit back and enjoy the show. A must for fans of early musicals, silent films, and 1920s Paris but be warned. Although prominently displayed on the cover (in a costume she doesn't wear) Josephine Baker appears in only 2 numbers with a screen time of less than 7 minutes in an overall running time of 103 so don't buy it just for her.",1179532800,12,2434,4.552511415525114
8186296,5,B000OQDX3Q,"WOW!
I love this film! It is unique in cinema history. Is there another film that shows what stage reviews at the Moulon Rouge and other Parisian nightclubs actually looked like during the roaring twenties? This film does. The  amazing costumes and the great artists, including Josephine Baker are a delight to behold even if they are covered up a bit more than usual for the filming.
The print used for this video release was found after an extensive search through European film archives. The stencil printed colors are fresh and gorgeous.
This was a silent film and there is a long tradition of providing new music when there isn't an existing written score. The new music used here is experimental in flavor and does not immitate music of the era but it works in most of the film.
Surrounding the musical numbers is a paper thin plot to hold it all together but you can use the menu to go to your favorite numbers.
I love this film!",1497657600,,936,4.538461538461538
8186297,3,B000OQDX3Q,The background soundtrack through out the movie is very modern. Only a few scenes with Josephine baker but it's a nice glimpse of the past for a silent film in color.,1470614400,,166,4.387096774193548
8186298,4,B000OQDX3Q,"Interesting. I actually got this to see La Baker, alas she's only in two of many numbers. That said, the two make it clear she was an incredibly modern dancer, her presence and movement set her light years ahead. Pop&lock? Charleston? Vaudeville?  Owns em all.
The remaining dancers have do some wonderful moments, along with some grand costumes. The same problem that plagues any vintage dance footage is unfortunately present here; grainy film, odd color shifts and frustrating camera work.  That said, this isn't meant to be the ABT or Ballet Russe. ABTgood but required a fair bit of patience.
I absolutely agree with the other reviewers; mute the sound!",1453420800,,658,4.972727272727273
8186299,3,B000OQDX3Q,"This movie had a story to it but not about Josephine Baker - who was on the screen for a few dance numbers .The movie was in black and white and some sequences were colorized - but not too many - all in good taste. The music score which was part of this had a few bumps in it - that is when a few scenes showing industry in Paris, they played jazz - but more like fusion jazz. I had to turn down the volume for about four minutes of scenes. The music was much too chaotic for me.  All in all - I'll see it again.

8186300,3,B000OQDX3Q,"This is an amazing visual feast, a chance to observe beautifully photographed acts from a Parisian review. I love it for that reason, but deplore the unspeakably ugly modern-jazz score provided by Taranta-Bab. This is silent cinema, so something was needed, but I'm afraid that something should be in the musical style of the period, with at least some attempt to provide vocal sounds when people on stage are singing. With modern technology it's actually not hard to match up period recordings with the video, so as to have rhythmic coordination. The effect of the modern score is to distance one from the luxurious images passing so intoxicatingly across the screen. Otherwise this is a 5/5 DVD.",1421452800,,697,4.965811965811966
8186301,4,B000OQDX3Q,"This is restored beautifully, but as a movie, it is a little dull, even with so many big production numbers. And I agree with the other reviewers that the soundtrack is just not the right fit (had to take a star off for that). It could have been so much better. The plot, as other reviews have stated is thin and not very interesting; however, it is important to note something about it that is very interesting, and seems to have been overlooked (or just unknown by most people). The plot is based on the life of Gaby Deslys, the famous, international revue star of the previous generation (in regards to the time of this movie), who directly influenced revue performers (during her lifetime and up to today) and the style of revues. She was famous for having a multitude of lavish costume changes, an abundance of feathers on her elaborate costumes (Cecil Beaton called her ""a human aviary""), huge feather-bedecked hats and feather headdresses. She was constantly in the media, endorsed products, was parodied in other shows, etc. These groundbreaking devices were subsequently used in the Folies Bergere, Ziegfeld Follies, and she put the Casino de Paris on the map--again directly influencing Josephine Baker, and a rival performer, Mistinguett.

The plot definitely follows Gaby Deslys' life, with a few exceptions. The lead actress bears a physical resemblance to Gaby and her character even changes her name to ""Gaby Derys."" She was well-known for her pearl jewelry, as well, but much larger pearls and longer strands than what is shown in the movie! Gaby Deslys died at the height of her fame, at age 37 in 1920. Unfortunately, she is all but lost to history. In addition to performing on stages in Europe, England and across America, she made four silent movies, but those are lost as well. Fortunately, ""La Revue des Revues"" has surfaced, and gives us a small glimpse into her life and her influence. Another character based on her can be seen today, in the BBC TV show ""Selfridge,"" in the character ""Ellen Love."" Also, notable, Carole Lombard is costumed as Gaby Deslys (to a ""T"") for a costume party, in the movie ""Love Before Breakfast.""

Being a dancer, interested in early 20th century dance, I find the production numbers a great reference to have, especially since the quality is amazing and I love the hand-tinting. So, don't bank on this for being a riveting movie (unless you do like to collect interesting silent movies), but if you are interested in seeing early production numbers and costumes, it's a must for your library. And please take a look, a bit more closely, at the plot, for it's importance in the history of ""the revue,"" and also for the reason that it is here---it is a very important part of a movie about the revues of Paris. I purchased a biography about Gaby Deslys on Amazon last year, and it was fascinating, if anyone is interested!",1395446400,2,2875,4.771084337349397
8186302,2,B000OQDX3Q,"We rented this film hoping to catch a glimpse of the legendary Josephine Baker, but after watching a rather inane starlet flip around the screen for 30 minutes, there was no sighting of the star!  We even tried to fast forward with no luck.",1392940800,2,240,4.454545454545454
8186303,4,B000OQDX3Q,"The DVD arrived in a remarkably short time after ordering and in excellent order.  Although it was obviously  photographed in the late 1920s, the images were well restored. However my enjoyment was impaired by the added soundtrack music. I found this to be  intrusive and not at all appropriate to the times of the subject.",1389139200,,323,4.836363636363636

8186305,4,B000OQDX3Q,"The best part of the whole movie is of course the two dance scenes performed by Josephine Baker, She is adorable, witty and damn! she could scoot and boogie! Modern hip hop dancers could take notes from her, she is that wonderful! The rest of the dancers (?) if you can call them that were mainly relying on costumes, and...well...hand-waving and such. Josephine was the only one who really danced. I don't mean to judge this movie too harshly, after all it was in the 20s, but Josephine's style was very ahead of it's time and she could fit in with any dancer today.

The worst part of this movie by far and why I rated it four stars instead of five was the absolutely dreadful choice of background music! I put the movie on mute after the first five minutes of whatever the hell that was and put Edith Piaf on instead. I have to admit that was a much better soundtrack. I'll admit I didn't listen to any more of the ""music"" after the first five minutes, or so and maybe it got better, but I really doubted it. The only reason I didn't listen to Josephine's own music is because that cd was in the car and I didn't want to get my lazy butt up and get it, but Edith was a better choice. Really, would it have killed these people to at least come close to the time period. That modern jazz crap really sucked.

So, if Josephine wasn't in it, it wouldn't be that great, but it gives you a nice glimpse into silent movies and how far cinema has come.",1360281600,2,1447,4.2202166064981945
