1791258,4,B00006RJVD,"Fans of Blaxploitation will be more than satisfied with this DVD double feature. ""The Black Gestapo"" is a mean, nasty race-riot of a movie. A benevolent police group, the People's Army, attempts to aid the citizens of Watts, who are being terrorized by what appears to be a mob of bitter appliance salesmen. There's dissention in the army's ranks, however, and a splinter group made up of local criminals forms to run the white mob out of Watts (one wise guy is castrated in his bathtub, another is run off the road by a breast-baring Uschi Digart and shot up by the gang). The mob retreats, but this new People's Army takes their place, shaking down the citizens and having drunken orgies at their new compound (where Ms. Digart shows up again in the leader's bed). ""Gestapo"" is directed by R.L. (Lee) Frost, who directed such exploitation gems as ""The Defilers,"" ""The Pick-Up"" and ""Love Camp #7."" This one's not as stylish as his earlier roughies, but he keeps the story moving with brisk pacing and plenty of sex n' violence (though mostly violence). There's not a single one of ""The Black Gestapo""'s 88 minutes that's politically correct.

By comparison, ""The Black Six"" is an After School Special, focusing on a good-natured biker gang of six Viet Nam vets (all played by pro football players, including ""Mean"" Joe Green) who are riding across the U.S., doing odd jobs for weak-chinned farm women or terrifying bigots at a poorly constructed roadside cafe (our heroes literally bring down the clapboard restaurant while its owner--a part I'm sure was originally written for Shelley Winters--stands by the road shrieking). The beating death of one of the brothers' brother takes the guys back to a hick town to avenge his murder. By this point, you'll have heard the theme song about 12 times. You'll hear it 12 more times before the final credits. Bad acting, silly dialog and extreme afros all lead to a totally incomprehensible ending. All this hilarity is brought to us by director Matt Cimber, who later went on to direct the Pia Zadora potboiler ""Butterfly,"" which is, in view of ""The Black Six,"" an accomplished film.

No fan of Blaxploitation can afford not to see these movies. The entertainment value is double the cost of the DVD!",1057881600,15,2245,4.813471502590674
1791259,5,B00006RJVD,"Black Gestapo is a great social commentary. I would rank it with Animal Farm. It shows the dangerous of the black militant movement.  In the movie a black militant , but non-violent organization hires outside help for protection. They warant this unit unlike any other in the group to use force to push out the opperessing mafia. Unfortuneatly, they become more crooked than the mafia.  I love how the movie put extreme black radicalism in the same boat as the nazis movement. It was a wake - up call to me and many others.
The Black Six was a little lighter. It was about cool bikes and football player. It was good none the less.",1057795200,5,631,4.478260869565218

I am fortunate enough to have a copy however I would love to have viewed these features, especially The Black Gestapo in pristine print form, sadly this is not the case.  Both films are fine examples of the by gone era of Blaxploitation, certainly not on the same level of The Mack or Black Caesar or Coffy, but these films have heart an imagination on a shoestring budget that would not be enough to pay for lunch on a single day of any major movie set.  If you enjoy Blaxploitation you may want to pick this Double Feature up, just keep in mind the quality of the print is going to make you feel like you are watching an old VHS tape that was rented out once to many times from the neighborhood Video Store.",1364083200,6,869,4.286585365853658

It actually has a good theme to it a la Animal Farm, in which one group overcomes the oppression of another group, then eventually itself becomes the oppressor, and has to have someone else come in and clean up the mess Rambo style. I also enjoyed passing down Memory Lane especially with the older cars.",1330819200,,475,4.348314606741573
1791313,3,B00006RJVD,"I am interested in unusual, cult, or dated films of (almost) all genres that can expose and explain attitudes and cultural phenomena from times past, often better than a history book. I have seen many ""blaxploitation"" films which were largely made in the 1970's for urban audiences, and they are frequently interesting to watch from a cultural vantage point (1971's ""Shaft"" is the enduringly classic example of the genre.) They are also frequently imaginative and entertaining. This set from Alpha Video Classics contains two action films with largely black casts. I had heard of ""The Black Six,"" and wanted to see the intriguing casting of football stars. I had never heard of the outrageously titled ""The Black Gestapo"" before, and it's by far the weirder and more divisive of the two.

""The Black Gestapo"" is an angry film that starts with the setup of a black revolutionary group, ""The People's Army,"" led by General Ahmed (Rod Perry) who is fighting off white pushers in Watts. His second in command, Colonel Kojah (Charles Robinson) is a power grabber with fighting and malice in his heart. While Ahmed truly wants to help his people be independent and to overcome their problems, Kojah is simply a thug who seeks to replace the white pushers and criminals with his own. At the outset it appears that the entire film is nothing more than an endorsement of extremism, but Ahmed actually turns out to be a sympathetic character (despite the early 1940's jackboot imagery used.) The acting is quite poor and generally over the top, and this copy has poor quality sound and picture.

The concept is that under the effective control of Kojah, the People's Army descends to the level of the mob and puts out hits and the like: the attack on ""Vito"" (Phil Hoover; no stereotyping there...) in particular is appalling and will make males in the audience decidedly queasy. The fact that the group he founded has sunk to these depths revolts Ahmed, and a power battle erupts. One lesson is that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and that it's no better for the citizens of Watts to have the People's Army running extortion rackets and committing murders than it was for the mob to be doing so. The karate showdown between principals on a giant estate is the best action in the film, though the rally chants of ""They will all feel our vengeance!"" becomes tiresome quickly (although it does pretty much sum up the plot.)

After it becomes clear that corruption has ruined the revolution, it's obvious that the people of Watts are, if anything, worse off than when they started, and despite Ahmed's strict rules that he will not be involved in crime, nor will he permit it, the corruption is too deep in his organization to prevent destruction, and before long there are two sets of revolutionaries in two sets of uniforms fighting. Meanwhile, of course, it's the people who suffer, as the People's Army was given a $10,000 per week grant from the government to help the people of Watts. This change in direction will obviously void that. (I say obviously, but given California's proclivity for fiscal irresponsibility, who knows?)

Ultimately General Ahmed survives an assassination attempt and takes his black Ford Maverick on a stunning solo special ops mission to unseat Kojah. I won't reveal how it plays out, but will say that it takes approximately forever to unfold, there's a hilarious ruse involving an ""endurance run,"" and everything ends in a pool. This film is all over the place and features some genuinely terrible acting. It also features Uschi Digard as Kojah's girlfriend in a very unexpected piece of casting. The vitriol is loud and blatant here, and it's hard to be sympathetic to any cause that endorses crime and assassination to further personal goals. I found the second half of the movie more captivating because it transitioned from race-based exploitation fare to a genuine battle of good versus evil as personified by Ahmed and Kojah. I am glad I watched ""The Black Gestapo,"" but it was my least favorite of the two and I wouldn't seek it out, nor do I recommend it to anyone other than a blaxploitation completist.

""The Black Six"" could just as well have been titled ""Football and Motorcycles"" as it stars six football legends from the 1970's riding bikes and righting wrongs. Gene Washington of the San Francisco 49ers stars as Bubba Daniels, a military veteran and all-around good guy. He peacefully rides around the country with a group of fellow veterans doing odd jobs on occasion and generally staying out of trouble. He is joined on the road by Carl Eller (Minnesota Vikings,) Lem Barney (Detroit Lions,) Mercury Morris (Miami Dolphins,) Willie Lanier (Kansas City Chiefs,) and Mean Joe Greene (Pittsburgh Steelers.) The film starts on a farm where the six are throwing hay bales and petting a goat. The scene provides background, as over dinner (which is painfully acted) we learn about their status as Army veterans and bikers. The film also makes it quite clear that they are totally peaceful unless provoked. Remember that the stars are football players, not actors: that will be obvious from the performances, but in all truth I found the relative amateurishness of the cast to be endearing and not to detract from the film: it's easy to sympathize with their plight and their successes.

Bubba gets word that his younger brother Eddie (Robert Howard) was murdered and the gang starts its own investigation after local cops are ineffective. In spite of its technical shortcomings, the film is an excellent reminder of how truly ugly racism is, and is very effective in that regard. I found myself surprised at how much I appreciated the film for its exploration of the issue (another film I highly recommend that addresses the issue decisively, although as a tangent to the primary plot, is ""The Great Santini."") When they get to his hometown Bubba discovers that his brother was killed for dating a white girl, and after more digging finds iniquity pervading the town. His one true love is married to a weasel named Copperhead (Ron LeBrane) who is exploiting her by making her turn tricks. Bubba rescues her, and she helps them discover that it was Eddie's girlfriend's brother, Moose (John Isenbarger,) who killed Eddie because he couldn't accept her interracial relationship. Moose heads a huge biker gang with an (obviously deserved) bad reputation for trouble. It will come as no surprise that the film ends with an enormous melee of bikes that pits the forces of good versus evil in the stereotyped personas of Bubba versus Moose. The fight is a very lengthy knock-down, drag-out affair with plenty of action for anyone.

I am not especially a fan of biker films, but I thought Gene Washington and company did a good job depicting the triumph of good over evil, and despite the outdated slang, often ridiculous clothes, stilted dialogue, and unpolished acting, I recommend ""The Black Six"" to collectors of blaxploitation films, 1970's cult classics, football aficionados, and fans of B-movies everywhere.",1288569600,6,7047,4.921783010933558
1791314,2,B00006RJVD,"Unless you're a serious collector of blaxploitation films like I am, I suggest you skip this one. The Black Gestapo is predictable and boring. The fight scenes look like they were choreographed by those same people who did the corny Star Man fights (circa 1968). The Black Six has an ending so laughable, you'd think Laurel and Hardy must have written it.",1272240000,2,355,4.741935483870968

1791318,1,B00006RJVD,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
Having said that, ""The Black Six"" (a joke gift from a goofy friend), is fully enjoyable.
It looks like it was shot in a couple of days using bits and pieces of discarded scripts that had been haphazardly glued together.
The best part is watching these football legends (and they are legends, 4 of them are in the Hall of Fame) act.
Of particular interest is the hilarious method that Lem Barney uses to quell his opponents.  Lem (who I don't think had one line in the movie) practices a type of martial arts that can be described as ""Statue Fu"").
He leans forward and places his foot on the chest of an opponent.  That's it, and that seems to be enough to immobilize the opponent.
Other great awful scenes abound.
Of particular interest for Football fans is watching Carl eller in scenes where he is shirtless.  Eller was considered a big man at the time and at 6' 4"" and about 250, he is an impressive specimen.  But 30 years later, there are wide receivers with those measurements.  He would be about 80 pounds too light to make it in today's NFL.
Maybe the ""Black 6"" should have been chasing steroid dealers instead of southern racists.
Wonder if it's too late for a sequel?",1108944000,3,1217,4.439461883408072
1791319,1,B00006RJVD,"Football players don't always make great thespians, but sometimes players will try their hand at the big screen. In 1974, six of the biggest stars of the NFL appeared in ""The Black 6."" San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Gene Washington stars as Bubba Daniels, a Vietnam veteran home from his tour of duty, making up for lost time with his five closest friends from the Army. They are Jr. Bro Williams (Carl Eller), Bookie Garrett (Mercury Morris), Frenchy LaBoise (Lem Barney), Tommy Bunka (Willie Lanier), and Kevin Washington (Joe Greene). One day, after completing some work on a farm with his buddies, Bubba checks his general delivery box, and learns that his brother Eddie (Robert Howard) has been killed. Moose King (John Isenberger), the leader of a motorcycle gang in Bubba's home town, killed Eddie because Eddie became involved with Moose's sister, Jenny (Cynthia Daly).

Bubba comes home to get answers and justice. The police and most of the locals know that the motorcycle gang had some involvement, but nobody's willing to challenge the gang's alibi that they were out of town when Eddie died. The only people who are willing to help are an old barfly and Ceal (Rosalind Miles), Bubba's old girlfriend who started turning tricks when Bubba didn't come straight home from the service. With their help, Bubba goes to the biker bar where Moose and his gang frequent, and Jenny works as a waitress. Bubba and Moose nearly settle the score in the bar, but the police break up the confrontation and advise everyone to leave unless they want to get arrested. That gives Moose time to meet with Thor (Ben Davidson), the leader of another local motorcycle gang, for help in dealing with Bubba on a permanent basis. Bubba's friends, concerned for their friend's safety, come to town to provide muscle for Bubba. Thus, the stage is set for the predictable showdown between the gangs and the Black 6, with equally predictable results.

First, let me give you the bad news about ""The Black 6."" There isn't a single credible performance in this movie. In addition to The Black 6, Moose, and Thor, several other pro football players and baseball great Maury Wills make equally thankless appearances. Neither writer George Theakos nor director Matt Cimber try to give any dimension to any character besides Bubba. The music by David Moskoe is a poor imitation of Curtis Mayfield's ""Superfly"" score. The title song says the guys don't look for trouble, yet it also says they love ""ladies, bikes, and fighting."" That confusion never ends. The climactic fight scene is horribly lit, making it impossible to distinguish the good guys from the bad. When Moose's gang is killed by The Black 6, Thor's gang decides to burn them to death with road flares. The Black 6 throw them back with hits that cause bikers to burn, and their bikes to explode. The rest of the bikers get wiped out when their attempt to play kamikaze fails.

Now here's even worse news about the film. It's as dismissive of black people as it is of whites. Most blacks are dismissed as drunks, gamblers, and hustlers, and most whites are dismissed as hateful of non-whites. The more ""The Black 6"" dwelled on these traits, the more vile I found the film. Thankfully, I only had to endure this filth for only about 85 minutes. The only thing that trumps the ineptitude of the film in general is its misguided, misanthropic view of human beings. I had low expectations for this DVD, but I don't want my $4 curiosity investment to make me feel as repulsed as this movie did. The movie ends with this ominous warning: ""Hassle a brother...and the Black 6 will return.""

""The Black 6"" makes Fred Williamson films look like high art in comparison - and both cost the same price. ""The Black 6"" is one of the worst movie experiences I've ever had. Avoid this film, even at its cost. Nothing good will come of viewing it. This isn't just blaxploitation. This is total exploitation. Shame on the filmmakers.
