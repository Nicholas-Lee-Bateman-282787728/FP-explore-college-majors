1084762,5,6305830878,"I enjoyed this movie very much. The title needs some explanation. Long winded titles like this tend to turn off potential renters and buyers. The main charachter Barney Snow is the bumblebee flying anyway. The bumblebee  doesn""t know it cant fly because the laws of physics say it can't so  it does anyway. Barney has his memory erased so that he doesn't know he has  bone cancer, so he lives anyway without symptons. This concept is  fictional, yet it is correct that the basis for many diseases are mental  and emotionally based. One should practice control over ones thoghts  regularly with a form of meditation that observes the thought stream. The  movie uses hypnosis to build a wall around barney's thoughts and memories.  De-hypnosis by watching the thought stream may be a concept that can really  prevent disease. People walk around daily in a hypnotic compulsive state  already.  I really enjoyed Elijah  Wood . He is by far the best under 30  actor todaY. This movie is good for the whole family, no violence. I love  the touch with his girlfriend staying with him giving him the courage to  continue the research experiment. The last couple scenes in the movie are  beautiful emotional scenes.  Enjoy , Hope to see many more of these from  Elijah.",963360000,6,1260,4.78139534883721
1084763,2,6305830878,"If this movie worked for you, that's great!  It was a real disappointment to me although I love Elijah Wood's acting skills, and think Richard Cormier's books are fantastic to read.
Something was amiss with this  movie - the acting other than that of Elijah Wood, Janeane Garofalo, and  the young boy in the wheelchair, was stilted - they sounded as though they  were reading, not acting. The adaptation from the book by the same name  left out a lot, and the actors weren't able to relay that message very  well.
It may be an OK movie if you haven't read the book - but don't  watch it without reading the book, first!",962496000,,619,4.424778761061947
1084764,4,6305830878,"I admit I rented Bumblebee because Janeane Garafalo and Elijah Wood are in it. I wasn't sure what to expect, but was soon absorbed in the story of Barney Snow (Wood) a teenager with no memory who has agreed to participate  in experimental therapy administered by Garafalo and a group of doctors at  an Institute housing terminally ill young people. Barney is the only person  there who is not dying, but he is having haunting visions of being in a car  accident. He befriends a couple of the patients who turn out to be as  vitally important to Barney and the audience as Barney himself. We are  drawn in and held tight as this movie slowly opens doors for Barney and  reveals the truth about his past and his identity. I found the entire last  quarter of the film gripping and poignant. I am sorry I did not get to  experience this film in a theatre properly, but it translates well on video  nonetheless. It blew me away. My only complaint is Rachael Leigh Cook as  Barney's love interest and teh sister of a patient at the Institute. She  does not seem to have much to do with the story at all, which is mildly  annoying. I would have liked to see her character have more depth and  purpose especially since she interacts with Barney closely in the last half  of the film. Overall, The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is a sweet film that stays  with you long after the credits roll and I am going to purchase it as soon  as the price lowers from 100 dollars:)FYI: The title refers to the  bumblebee's ability to fly even though it should not be able to due to its  body size and tiny wing span.",959990400,19,1589,4.361774744027303
1084800,4,6305830878,"At the end of ""The Bumblebee Flies Anyway,"" I found myself wondering what the filmmakers had set out to accomplish when making the film.  It is still unclear to me.  Nevertheless, this movie is extremely touching, and worth watching.
Barney Snow is living in a hospital for terminally ill children, but is not near death...just amnesiac.  Barney is in despair.  All he can remember is his name and a few random facts.  The film follows his journey, as he meets his fellow patients and begins unraveling the real story as to why he is the way he is.  This is a film about life: how to appreciate and hold onto it.
Elijah Wood is excellent as Barney Snow, and quite reminiscent of Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker in ""Spider-Man.""  The boys who play his friends are also very good.  Rachael Leigh Cook and Janeane Garofalo's characters, however, are too stiff and one-dimensional.",1057795200,2,874,4.741721854304636

1084802,5,6305830878,"I'm from Germany and I have heared from Elijah Woods performance in this movie. As far I can say, he does an amazing job. I was absolutly touched after watching this movie. Couldn't stop crying. I read the Book ""The bumblebee flies anyway"" too. So I was able to go deeper into the story. It is really a great movie and worth to watch, especially for Elijah Woods-Fan and all who believe in this brilliant actor.",1052956800,,411,4.421052631578948
1084803,4,6305830878,"This film is about a Barney Snow (Elijah Wood) who's lost all his memory of his family and is currently living in sort of home for sick and handicapped children, under supervision by doctors and such. Rachel Leigh Cook co-stars as his love interest he meets through her brother, Burto, who is also at this hospital home. The story unwinds as Snow figures out exactly why he's lost his memory (and it's not at all predictable).
The pros in this film are the lead characters, all the children in the film are excellent (except for that little black kid, who can't act very well) and the story is unpredictable and pretty original. It's the type of soothing cute story which will leave you with a feeling of calmness after you've seen it, mostly because of all the locations the movie is in; a quiet, quaint, suburban town in the middle of autumn everyone dreams of growing up and living in.
The cons for one are the pace of the film; it's not for the impatient, because even though this movie is only about 1:30 hours long, it feels like a lot more simply because there is just too much dialog and quiet moments and the film just seems to move too slow. My g/f was bored watching it, it's almost as if they just threw a lot of stuff in to take up some more time. Jeanine Garofallo was obviously doing this one for the money, her character is not comedic in any aspect, she is flat and doesn't seem to be trying very hard in terms of acting abilities, if she was trying to showcase her dramatic side, she picked the wrong film.
So why did I give this film 4 out of 5 stars? Mostly because of the ending (mostly with the Burto character), even though it's kind of hard to grasp (I still don't really get it), it has a sense of fundemental beauty, whether it's the music, the 3 boys situation, or whatever, it just seemed to take me back to when I was a pre-teen and felt that the whole world was at my fingertips, and that there was hope for the future or anything for that matter. Sure the pacing is slow, and story is a bit proposterous, but underneath it all lies a beautiful film and concept, just a bit misdirected.",1044230400,9,2116,4.319095477386934
1084804,5,6305830878,"This is a spectacular movie which sadly most of the world will never get to see.  The acting was amazing, particularly Elijah Wood's portrayal of the terminally ill Barney Snow. The theme was spectacular.  While the story was not based on a real-life event, the entire concept is based on similar scientifically proved true happenings.  Hope, love, and friendship come together to change the usual perspective on what faith can do for a person's body and mind.  I would reccomend this movie for any person who wants to see a good uplifting film without the usual ""sex and violence"" cliche.  It is definately worth buying.",1043798400,2,621,4.876190476190477
1084805,1,6305830878,"There is a mystery at the heart of this movie, for sure -- what are well-regarded actors like Elijah Wood and Janeane Garofalo doing in such a terrible film?
It is so maudlin and poorly-written it verges on mocking the plight of terminally ill children. Ick.
I suspect many of the positive reviews here were written by young women smitten by Wood. And he is cute, and he is in every scene in this film. If I were still 15, I expect I'd feel the same.
But if you happen to be a grown up, don't bother with this one.",1041984000,4,514,4.15
1084806,3,6305830878,"Barney Snow is part of the Bumblebee Project.  He has volunteered to undergo a new type of therapy that will help him rediscover his past.  You see Barney has no memories of who he is, his family or his past.  He's hoping that Dr. Harriman (aka: The Handyman) can help him in his quest.  The therapy he must undergo takes place in a hospital for terminally ill patients.  While searching for his past, he finds that his present is much more interesting.  Having been told not to consort with the terminally ill patients, Barney finds he has more in common with them than he ever could have imagined.  Helping him deal with all of this are Dr. Harriman and his newly found friends Billy, Mike, Mazzo and Cassie.
Convincing performances by Elijah Wood as Barney, Janeane Garofalo as Dr. Harriman, Joseph Perrino as Mazzo, and Rachel Leigh Cook as Cassie.  Heart-wrenching story that you'll need plenty of Kleenex for.  Makes me want to rush out and buy the novel on which this movie is based.",1032134400,4,990,4.611428571428571
1084807,3,6305830878,"An enjoyable & romantic must-see film for fans of Elijah Wood and the very appealing Rachael Leigh cook, preposterous story line notwithstanding. In the hands of a less capable lead actor, Wood's role as amnesiac Barney Snow would have been a howler. The premise makes little sense, and when you finally figure out what's really going on, it makes even less. Think of it as a science fiction movie, and you'll find the whole-hog scientific leaps and stretches much less aggravating. Janeane Garofalo, an otherwise wonderful actress, is wasted on a very flat role here as a doctor fixated on ""detachment"". Still, I'd recommend it to any Elijah fans.",1031011200,3,648,4.954128440366972

For one we have the same name, and for two she's my favorite actress. This movie is my all time favorite one of Racheal's movies. I've only seen about three movies that can really make me cry. This one one of them. I loved the way Barney and Cassie showed their love for eachother. My favorite part is the very very end. I love that song Truthfully.

1084821,5,6305830878,"To be honest, I only saw this the first time with my friends because it had Elijah Wood in it. It immediately became my favourite movie (tied only with Lord of the Rings). What I love about it, is that it isn't an ordinary shoot-em-up, American terrorism movie like those that have become so popular lately. Instead, it is about life, and death, and love, and how the human spirit can triumph over greater odds. It's the sort of movie that makes you wonder what it would be like if the same thing were happening to you; if one day, you woke up and didn't know who you were, or where you were, or anything about your past. This movie is the only movie besides Lord of the Rings that has ever made me cry. The acting is amazing, the directing is beautiful, and there is no need for special effects, unlike most of today's films. An absolutely brilliant piece of work, and it's such a pity it's not better known- it deserves to be. It touches the heart and the mind, and is a definite must-see.",1024012800,7,991,4.304812834224599
1084822,5,6305830878,"To be honest, I only watched this the first time with my friend because it had Elijah Wood in it. Then I realized it was so much more than Elijah; it was a story of life, and death, and love, and how the human spirit can triumph over greater odds. Beautifully acted and directed, and unlike most modern movies, it is stunning without any computer graphics and explosions. Instead of being nothing but eye candy (unless you count Elijah of course!) it is a movie that touched my heart and made me think about what would be going through my mind if I were in his place. The music is also wonderfully done, it fits the mood and stayed with me for two weeks after I saw the movie. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is the only movie besides Lord of the Rings that has ever made me cry, and the only one that's made me cry three times in the space of an hour.

1084827,5,6305830878,"At first the only reason I saw this movie was because Elijah Wood was in it, I've had a crush on him since I was 9. I was flipping through channels when I saw this movie. It was amazing. All the actors and actresses were great. The only dissapointment was the perfomence by Rachel Leigh Cook. I thought she could have done better or she could have been in the movie more. She kind of had a small part and probably if they took her out the movie wouldn't change much. But I really think if she was going to be in this movie she should have had a larger role.
But overall it was a great movie. If you are thinking about seeing this you should see this one. It is a wonderful movie.",1016323200,,679,4.037037037037037
1084828,4,6305830878,"I have to say the first reason I thought of picking this movie up was Elijah Wood. As a performer myself, I realized his talent years ago when he starred as Huck Finn back in 1993. I knew then that his was a carreer to watch. I followed Elijah through the good movies and the bad until yesterday when I picked up ""Bumblebee."" What would you do if you had to literally forget your past in order to have a future. Barney Snow (Elijah Wood) is faced with exactly this decision in this heart tugging drama.
Barney snow wakes up in hospital for terminally ill youths, not remembering how he got there, or even what his name is. His only choice is to trust the information he is given by Dr. Herriman or ""The Handyman"" (Jeneane Garafolo). Along his journey, Barney meets and befriends several of the patients as well as one patients extremely good-looking sisters named Cassie (Rachel Leigh Cook). THe two develop a typical teen love at first sight relationship that will leave any teenage girl sobbing by the end. Of course, I sobbed at the end too, but not for the love story.
Elijah Wood's performance is yet again almost flawless. I felt for his character almost right from the start and his boyish features truly make you believe that this 20 year old man is actually a 15 year old boy.
Rachel Leigh Cook's role in this film was a little beefed up in promos for publicity reasons but nonetheless, her performance is excellent. She brings out the best in Barney, whether he knows it or not.
THe only dissapointment I had was this movie was Jenean Garafolo. I felt like she was reading her lines form a poster board and she really didn't feel like being there at all.
I lied, my other dissapontment with this film was the score. The music was too sporatic, to little and far between and altoghether wrong for this script.
For those two reasons I have givin this movie four stars. The performance of the actors makes this film better than its far fetched plot. If you are a fan of great acting, watch this film.",1012780800,15,2007,4.471389645776567
1084829,4,6305830878,"Kept me guessing what was really going on the first hour.  Elijah Wood was pretty compelling as a young man who has amnesia.  Surprise twist towards the end that made me sad, angry, and glad (kind of) at the same time.  Wish we could see more of the story though, because they leave you hanging in the end.",1011830400,,306,4.241379310344827
1084860,5,6305830878,"I must admit that I only turned this movie on because I recognized the name from the list of movies that Elijah Wood had been in; after all, I don't think that I heard anything about it when it came out. But I was pleasantly surprised. I missed the first few minutes, but the rest of the movie left me so happy that I will be watching the full movie as soon as I can. Although some of the ideas in the movie; ie; bone cancer being able to be put into remission by the power of the mind alone, are a bit hard to beleive, the actors, notably Wood, don't let that show through. They are entirely convincing in their performances, and that makes everything work. I loved the interaction between Barney and Cassie in the movie; it really captured the essence of two people who love eachother, but know that something else more important must be addressed, first. The last thirty minutes of the movie are the best, and Wood really shows the uncertainty in Barney. Even in the last few minutes, I didn't know what he was going to decide. To lose his past, or his future? I will not ruin it, but the ending is as good as it could be. It's a great family film, with great acting by almost all of those involved.

I was so excited.  As an almost obsessive Robert Cormier fan, I was dying to see this book in a different perspective-on a video.  However, I must say I was rather disappointed.  I have to admit that the plot is great, and so is the story idea, but the video is just so SLOW!  The whole 90-something minute is action-less and quite boring.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that I've already read the book and knew what would happen in the end.  All I saw was Barney wandering around the hospital, talking with Cassie and the other patients.  The spark between Barney and Cassie and many other parts of the story were crushed by the video-the book did too good of a job of expanding our imaginations.  So, a little suggestion: watch the video first!  The book would then give you a deeper and more touching side of the story afterwards.  Or, another solution would be to watch/read one, and not the other-let the book leave it to the imagination, or enjoy the movie and forget about the book.",993945600,,1151,4.433333333333334

7896758,4,6305830878,"I really liked this movie. BUT I can 100% understand why some people don't. It's... odd.

Unlike what the cover portrays, this is NOT a romance. In fact the romance is only a small portion of the story and not great. Mostly due to Rachel Cook. I've seen Cook in other projects, and she's adorable and incredibly likeable. Not so in this film. I hate pointing out one actor in particular, but Cassie was the only character I could never connect with. She never seemed real. She was always a character. I'm not sure if changing the actress would have made a difference, or simply changing the character. They made her so sophisticated that she came off as nothing but an act.

Anyways, back to why people might not like it: Firstly is the obvious. This film is about terminally ill children which might not be what people want to watch. It has quite a bit of humor and a little bit of romance, but it is a rather difficult film. It's slow, but the characters are incredibly likeable and make it worthwhile. It doesn't have a clear genre or even really a clear plot line until late in the film. It's kind of a jumbled ... not mess, but a jumbled story. Yes, the ending is bizarre and the boys can be crude. There is quite a bit of language. (I was generally surprised by how much in a film rated PG.)

But the movie is interesting and the ending (minus the bizarre part) is bittersweet and haunting. The more I think back on it, the more I like it despite its few flaws. If you like unique coming-of-age films, I would really recommend The Bumblebee Flies Anyway.",1436313600,,1560,4.391003460207613

If you watch the movie closely, there are some very artistic qualities about it, such as when Elijah Wood is bouncing the ball against the wall and there is a star of light shining between him and the wall. I enjoyed the acting, except (slightly)for Jeanene Garofolo.",1084665600,2,531,4.6
