8353847,4,B00270ZLVO,"Cornell Woolrich's (1903 --  1968)darkly noir novels and stories have been adapted for the screen more than the works of any other writer. Based upon a 1941 novel, ""The Black Curtain"", ""Street of Chance"" (1942) was among the first Woolrich-based films and an early example of film noir. This ""B"" film was produced by Paramount and directed by the relatively unknown Jack Hively. The film stars a young Burgess Meredith as Frank Thompson/Danny Nearing and Claire Trevor who later became known as the ""Queen of noir"" as Ruth Dillon.

The film centers upon the loss of identity by its main character. It opens when Thompson is hit by a falling object from a New York City building and suffers from amnesia as a result. Just before the accident, he knew himself as Danny Nearing, but when he regains consciousness he forgets this identity and remembers himself as Frank Thompson.  He goes to home of his former wife, Virginia Thompson (Louise Platt) whom he had abandoned a year earlier.

The plot soon becomes tangled and coincidence driven. Frank had taken the name Danny Nearing a year earlier when he was under suspicion for murder of a wealthy Long Island man, Bill Diedrich.  At that time, he was involved with a femme fatale, Ruth Dillion, who worked as a maid for Diedrich. When Frank meets up with Ruth by chance a week or so following the accident, Ruth takes him to Diedrich's mansion on her day off so that Frank can attempt to clear his name.

The film is well-acted with an unconvincing story. With its darkness, shadows, and modernistic angular photography by the German expressionist cinematographer Theodor Sparkhul the movie has a disturbing noir ambience. The strongest moments of the film are set in the New York streets, with views of crowds, old small storefronts, and the inside of bars. The film captures the claustrophobia of the streets as Frank wanders aimlessly trying to recover his memory.

Unfortunately, this film is no longer available on DVD, but it can be found and viewed with a little searching. The film has recently been restored in a new 35 mm print and has been shown at a number of festivals of film noir, including just this week ""Noir City DC"" at the American Film Institute. The film will be of most interest to devoted viewers of film noir and to admirers of Cornell Woolrich.
