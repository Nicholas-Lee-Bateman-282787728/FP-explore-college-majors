3131327,3,B0014FAIUC,"The first three seasons of Penn & Teller's foulmouthed, adults-only investigative news program offered a fresh, enlightening perspective on current events, as the two Vegas magicians deployed their wicked, unsparing sense of humor against their targets and themselves.  Maybe the show should have stopped there, but it didn't.  Now, in season 5, they've finally fallen prey to self-righteousness.  Penn Jillette's trademark tirades have grown angrier and more ideologically driven; in this season he often sounds like a libertarian Michael Savage (which is not a good thing).  Teller is as puckish as ever, but has relatively little to do.  The content of these programs is still intelligent, but for this season the hosts' presence feels more like an imposition than an asset.

Showtime has crammed the entire season on two DVDs.  Video and audio are adequate, extras are practically nonexistent.  Shows on the ADA, immigration and America's breast fixation are better than average.",1212364800,9,983,5.421052631578948

True, in a couple of episodes, the strength of their argument seemed to be sacrificed to some extent to sheer entertainment value, such as the lesbian road trip in the hybrid car episode.  But most of the episodes did a good job making their point, while also making fun of their opponents---something the show has always done.  The Wal-Mart episode, the immigration episode, the ADA episode, and the nuclear power episode were all very well done.  (Also, loved the gratuitous Ayn Rand plug in the anger management episode.)

And the exorcism episode was hilarious.",1236902400,2,795,5.124031007751938
3131348,3,B0014FAIUC,"I have been a long-time fan of Bullsh^t for all five (now six) years and, as a long-time fan, I am rather ambivalent about this latest season. I agree with the positive reviewers that Penn & Teller's show is still capable of packing a mighty wallop against insane ideas like exorcism and toxicity cleansing. On the other hand, I sympathize with the negative reviewers who note that the show has gone down hill, and what used to be an intellectual show with humor has turned into a humorous show with smatterings of intellectual argument.

I will start off with the better episodes: the episodes rebuking Americans with Disabilities Act, anti-immigration policies, and anti-Walmart stances were phenomenal! While some episodes in this season are intellectually ""light weight,"" these two were of ""first season quality."" The shows did a great job refuting the key arguments of the opposition, and showing the superiority of P&T's more libertarian approaches (capitalism is generally more efficient and cost-effective than coercion).

The episodes on exorcism and toxic cleansing were good for a different reason. These episodes were closer to those in the first and second season, where we were able to have a good laugh at some easy targets. Yes, P%T refute these notions, but they are easy targets to refute. Unlike the episodes noted in the previous paragraph, the fun of these two episodes was less in the argument than in the exposee.

A lot of the rest of these episodes, though, were less than good. Penn and Teller try to refute the use of hybrid cars by showing that they they are small and a bit slower than standard cars (that they are more energy efficient, P&T very quietly acknowledge). P&T try to refute the idea - that no one I know of actually holds - that the four presidents on Mount Rushmore were saints. These episodes seriously lacked intellectual argumenmt and even though I agree with P&T's position on most things, I still found myself spotting easy holes in arguments they made. (For instance, while they are against government regulation in many episodes, they are against anger management coaches, in part, because they are unregulated?!)

Overall, then, I give this set 3 of 5 stars. This is nowhere near the first two seasons' quality, but is a step up from some of the most recent seasons. Penn and Teller may be getting a little rusty with age, but they are still very watchable.",1234915200,6,2408,4.880195599022005

I don't have any problem with topics, politics, and complaints covered in the episodes, nor am I bothered by the language or nudity. What bothered me is the lack of content. Unlike previous seasons of B.S. this one is quite short (at only 10 episodes), and each episode is only about 25 minutes long. For the topics covered, 25 minutes is barely enough time to introduce the topic, let alone discuss it thoroughly and talk to supporters and detracters. Despite this, many episodes also feature a great deal of filler. Such as the Fat Guy Olympics in an episode about the diet industry, and a blind date sequence in an episode about alternative energy. Gone is the in-depth analysis of supporter`s positions and criticisms of why they are wrong. Instead you get a position, a statement that its wrong, maybe an expert`s input, some filler, and the episodes over just as it is starting to get interesting. Related to the lack of content, there are also two episodes that have summarys on the packaging and on the discs that list things covered in the episode THAT ARE NOT EVEN IN THE EPISODE. In addition, there aren't even any extras in the set, none. All this makes me wonder if the episodes got shortened for the DVD release, or if they intended to add additional content but ran out of time. Overall I gave this title 3 stars, but the 1st disc really only deserves 2.

The last few seasons though, more and more of their libertarian politics have been creeping, muscling out the commonsense they built the series on. With season five, I found most the episodes to be suffering from the same bulls**t that they claim their targets are full of.

Come on, when you're consulting a conservative BS 'think' tank like the Competitive Institute to add 'balance' to a sympathetic story about Wal-Mart, you're not even trying to be serious. P&T set up straw men, go to 'experts' on the other side that most have never heard of, and then knock them over by making them look foolish rather than answer most of their arguments. In the Wal-Mart episode, they promised to answer the charges make in 'Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Living', they even had the director of the film on, but barely talked to him, prefering to run man on the street interviews and a couple of amateur protesters who P&T could edit so they come off looking like crazy hippies.

The language has never bothered me, largely for reasons covered by their episode on profanity.

The one thing that did disappoint me with this season was that it really seemed shorter than the others to me--like there were fewer episodes than seasons 1 through 4.

8255447,1,B0014FAIUC,"I watched the first season of ""Penn & Teller: Bull**** on DVD and found it interesting. The quirky Vegas magicians turn an illusionist's eye on those who endeavor to dupe people for profit. (TV psychics, for instance.) Easy targets, yes, but entertaining nonetheless.

Later, I found out that ""Bull****"" had done an episode on The Americans with Disabilities Act., entitled ""Handicapped Parking"".

The first interview subject is Marianne Catrall, whose daughter is blind and has autism. She has taken it upon herself to photograph drivers who misuse disabled parking spaces. Penn argues that it is ""way easy"" to obtain a parking permit because all you have to do is get ""some doctor"" to sign it. To buttress this oh-so astute argument, Penn says that the ADA's definition of disability is very broad, noting that the criteria includes those who have trouble keeping track of money and those who have trouble using the telephone. (Does he mean the mentally disabled, who just so happen to use that accounting assistance to maintain a level of independence?) Actually, there is a little bit of the titular substance in whom the ADA classifies as disabled: Substance-Abusers, a fact completely unaddressed by Penn and Teller.

Penn asks whether police officers ""have better things to do"" than enforcing ""thoughtfulness."" Well, yes, that is precisely why the bulk of enforcement falls to deputized civilians. But, you can hardly argue the need for the space in the first place, can you?

Unfortunately, Penn does.

When an interviewee compares fight for accessibility to the civil rights movement, Penn denounces that as B.S. making the argument that Jim Crow Laws prevented black people from getting on the bus, whereas disabled people cannot board due to the Laws of Physics. Now, I have read how other people have dismissed this as the nonsense as it is, but I think we can learn something from following it to its logical conclusion, (if we can stomach it.)

So, in Penn's view, the wrongness of segregation did not lie in the discrimination against someone on the basis of the color of their skin, but rather that such behavior was sanctioned by The Big Bad Government. As such, if a business-owner chose to, he could post a Whites-Only sign in his window. Imagine the outcry if Showtime had aired an episode arguing that.

The above illustrates one of the biggest problems we face as disabled citizens: It is still OK to treat us as concepts-as problems to be solved- rather than human beings with needs. They used to solve the ""problem"" of disabled people by shoving us out of sight. We were warehoused in terrible institutions. It is because of the ADA and earlier legislation that we are granted access to our communities. Wasn't access the crux of the civil rights movement? Black people wanted access to the segregated schools, access to lunch counters, access to voting booths. Now we are not hidden away, but we fight against apathy and indifference, and those things do not lend themselves to being held up for public scorn. We must use the power of law because we have seen that only under threat of litigation do the changes get made.

Penn believes that business owners would make accommodations on their own because it is good for business, but sadly this is not the case. Take as a small example that a movie theater I attend is wonderfully accessible on the inside, but ask them for a door-opener and all you get is a polite nod. Businesses will only do what is required of them and nothing more.

In the course of the episode Penn manages to argue against handicapped parking, building/street accessibility, and adaptive public transit, citing cost concerns. What's left? Well, the episode begins with Penn in a wheelchair, navigating the obstacles around the set, and he remarks, ""Man, if I had to do this everyday, I'd never leave my one-story house."" This sounds like Penn's advice to those of us that do....

""Handicapped Parking"" appears on the 5th season DVD of Bull****

Side-note: I recently went on a trip to Vegas and because of this episode I boycotted Penn and Teller and chose David Copperfield instead. While searching for a seating chart, I Googled the venue and ""wheelchair"" It turns out that the MGM Grand had settled with the government over a claim that it was not in compliance with the ADA, during Janet Reno's tenure. I can tell you that the seating is now excellent and I can thank the ADA for improving my experience.",1254787200,5,4458,4.852631578947369
