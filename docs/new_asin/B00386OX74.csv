8391082,5,B00386OX74,"Many customers are justifiably upset with this DVD having just four episodes of the original TV series (and one bonus episode from the 2006 first season of Shaggy & ScoobyDoo Get a Clue!). Personally, I purchased this singledisc release years ago expressly to acquire Spooky Space Kook, which was a childhood favorite.

A Child of the Sixties, who grew up on ScoobyDoo, Ive always found entertainment in shows like Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Night Gallery, Amazing Stories, Tales from the Dark Side, XFiles, Buffy (thats right, I said it, the Vampire Slayer rocked) _ and more recently _ Eureka, Warehouse 13, Torchwood, Fringe, Grimm & Supernatural.

Last week, season 13 of Supernatural offered a wonderfully entertaining installment featuring the liveaction Winchester brothers (and Castiel) getting drawn into the animated mystery A Night of Fright is No Delight (1969). The creators produced a magnificent onehour show capturing both the flavor of the old cartoon & the spirit of the newer Supernatural. If you're a Scooby fan, you really should check it out.
