8219442,5,B000VMJHYM,We must get this movie back on DVD. It is ridiculous for it to be unavailable forever. How can we get it back? Amazon needs to look into this.,1380585600,6,142,3.9310344827586206

email directly - nickhudson@bellsouth.net  Thanks.

I am a major fan of Adrian Paul.

I have read multiple articles about this movie - all praising it.
Amazon says it is no longer available blah blah....",1215302400,9,272,4.510204081632653
8219444,5,B000VMJHYM,"A previous reviewer objected to (in his words)..""...adding gay content to draw a gay audience."" In reality, it was the reverse ! This movie was originally made for the gay television network, ""here-tv"" It was later edited of it's gay content for the general masses. The edited version is sold here at Amazon under the title, ""USS Poseidon: Phantom Below."", but not the original gay version titled, ""Tides of War"" that appeared on here-tv. There is also another movie made by here-tv called ""Too Cool For Christmas"" with a gay couple. Another version was filmed with an opposite sex couple, and with a different title.
This movie starring the Highlander's Adrian Paul may be a bit slow to some reviewers, but part of the story shows the love, respect, regards and devotion between two men (that just happen to be gay). More movies should be as matter-of-fact about this issue since gays and gay couples are a part of everyday life in this world.",1195776000,26,944,4.762195121951219
