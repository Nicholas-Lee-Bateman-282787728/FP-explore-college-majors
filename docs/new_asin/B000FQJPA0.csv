2582091,5,B000FQJPA0,"No words ever written in any language could describe the tenderness and beauty found in this most wonderful Korean film from director John H. Lee. Both romantic and sensitive, it captures that joy we feel upon finally finding that someone where our heart can rest, and the gut-wrenching pain of watching them slip away before our pleading eyes.

It begins as Kim Su-jin (Son Ye Jin) is trying to put her life back together after an embarrassing office affair with her married boss ends in heartbreak at a train station. She returns home to live with her family, her loving father understanding rather judgmental. His foreman, Choi Chul Soo (Jeong Woo Sung), a carpenter, meets her by chance at a mini-mart where she has forgotten the can of Coke she just purchased. When they meet again she is embarrassed, but when he comes to her rescue during a street robbery a sweet romance begins.

There is humor and a wonderful sweetness to the couple's courtship missing in many films. That sense of longing and happiness just out of reach so prominent in Korean dramas will only gradually come into play as little by little Su-jin begins forgetting more and more and realizes something is wrong. Spanish love songs create a romantic and playful atmosphere during the first half of the romance which finally gives way to the film's lovely refrain during the heartbreaking latter half.

Lee paints a very real love which makes this not only rise above tear-jerker status, but put it into the romantic masterpiece category. Son Ye Jin is both beautiful and wondrous in her performance, and in the latter portion, Jeong Woo Sung lends depth to a young man faced with a loss so great it might destroy his life. Their day-to-day hardships and romantic plans are intruded upon by a devastating illness one is not supposed to get at the age of twenty-seven.

Their love and happiness as she quits her job and he leaves notes and pictures all over their house to remind her of things is quite emotional, but in a quiet way which the director never allows to become maudlin. When she realizes in a moment of clarity that she is breaking his heart she makes a decision which changes both their lives. But this film is not over, and its beautiful conclusion will choke you up and lift you up at the same time.

This film is unforgettable, and will become a part of anyone who sees it. For any person with the capacity for love deeper than the surface, A Moment to Remember will touch your heart and spirit and never fade from memory. A must own film.",1225065600,20,2531,4.640625

2582093,5,B000FQJPA0,"Moment to remember is a Great Movie..and in some ways very typical Korean ..well written, great characters and development..and alas a sad but beautiful ending. I watched a lot of Asian cinema , but have focused on Korean recently because they are vastly superior to 95% that comes out of Hollywood. This movie along with sad movie, windstruck, my Sassy girl, 200 lb Beauty, Il Mare, and She's on Duty are all just excellent and enjoyable movies...",1187308800,7,448,4.8311688311688314

This is a movie with real romance and real heartbreak. So many other movies out there try to mimic what this movie naturally has. Great chemistry, perfect deliveries, and sensational writing.

2582096,5,B000FQJPA0,"I just watched this beautiful, yet tragic movie and I was blown away.  The story is rich and well written.  Unlike a typical Korean drama, this movie shows what is love really about and how much you are willing to maintain to that love with someone special in your life.  Girls be sure to have a tissue ready and guys be sure to rent or buy this movie to show how much you love that special somebody.  You won't regret it!",1152403200,13,422,4.172839506172839

Unfortunately, his love for her must endure her tragic condition.  The story is beautifully done, realistically portraying life unlike typical K-dramas...no love triangles and no super rich families.

It is beautiful, tragic and romantic.  But be sure to have tissues because it WILL make you cry.",1149811200,11,445,5.125

2582099,5,B000FQJPA0,"Chose to watch this by random while skimming titles in Hulu.  I generally am not very emotional, and rarely come to tears over a show or movie.  The exceptions being ""Psalm 151"" episode of Touched By An Angel which gets me everytime, and now this wonderful film.

Long movie that just grabs you from the opening funny scene and has you both in love with the characters and then feeling every bit of the pain as the movie progresses to its tragic ending but yet heartwarming ending.

I can not think of any movie I have enjoyed more and the subtitles were easy to follow for the most part and well done.

Kudos to a wonderful cast and wonderful director/producer.

Enjoy and have plenty of kleenex nearby... you WILL need them...",1365292800,4,728,4.519083969465649
2582100,5,B000FQJPA0,"This has to be one of the most wonderful, charming, and the saddest love story that I have ever seen. A man finally found the love of his life, but lost her to Alzheimer's disease. She couldn't remember who she is and all the wonderful memories that she had with the man that she love, still he loves her and stay by her side. It's such a heartfelt love story and teaches you what true love is all about. I gave this movie 5 stars because any time a movie can make me cry and feel for the character it is a movie that is well done, not to mention the acting (especially the lead actor Jung Woo Sung) is excellent. I wished I could buy this movie for everybody to see, it is that good and it will bring tears to you eyes too!!!",1358035200,4,726,4.0137931034482754
2582101,5,B000FQJPA0,"A Moment To Remember follows the relationship between Su Jin, a young, forgetful woman, and Chul Soo, a young man with a troubled past; the film emphasizes the importance of the relationship, and the struggles that accompany Alzheimer's disease. A Moment To Remember is a beautiful film that effectively captures happiness and pain.

A Moment To Remember is a drama with a very powerful story, although you may have seen some of these elements before. The story begins with the focus being on the relationship they develop; Chul Soo and Su Jin come from different worlds but develop an authentic relationship, a relationship that feels real. Son Ye-jin and Jung Woo-sung did an amazing job in this film; they have great chemistry on camera which is the main reason the film feels authentic, since they can hit all of the right emotions. The film then unleashes the tragic Alzheimer's disease it teases throughout. Before this, you see and even experience happiness with the characters, now you feel the pain and agony that arrives with Alzheimer's disease; and it continues to hurt until the end. This one of the films that can really make you emotional for the right reasons. The ending was great, as well, so I won't spoil it. The music was also amazing and matched the tone of the film.

Overall, A Moment To Remember is an effective drama thanks to the deep storyline and the superb performances. Another gem among the many from South Korea. As of 12/27/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is highly recommended.

A Moment To Remember has some blood and violence, no sex or nudity.",1357430400,3,1613,4.815884476534296
2582102,4,B000FQJPA0,"This movie might be awesome to a lot of people, and it was well done, so I'm giving it 4 stars.

But I don't like tear jerkers. Netflix didn't TELL me she was going to have Alzheimer's. This was Netflix's description:  ""A romance blossoms between a clothing designer and a cautious young man, but because the two have both been hurt in the past, it develops slowly"".

Just- no warning, you know?

Ok, I would never watch this again. Having said that, for those of you who don't mind feeling anguish when you watch a movie, I will say the acting is good most of the time, the movie is well done in general. The two actors are very believable as a couple in love. Made me so happy to watch them together until she came down with I'm-forgetting-my-awesome-husband-who-I've-only-been-able-to-enjoy-for-a-year syndrome.

I realize the general recipe for most successful stories involves some conflict- generates pathos and whatnot. I think a story can still be effective if the conflict is at the beginning and it is resolved over the course of the story. This movie starts out like that: conflict in the beginning, with each suffering from their past relationships, her dad getting mad over their new relationship, etc. Things were going really well when the two of them found each other and starting climbing up out of their personal abysses. The amount of joy and sweetness between the two of them was awesome to watch. Structurally the film would have worked just fine if they'd carried on and lived happily ever after. So I was bummed when it ended with...more conflict.

Dang it all. >:{

Anyway it's a pretty good movie. I promise I will never watch it again.",1348963200,,1661,4.746527777777778

If you are skeptical or uneasy about watching a foreign film, or if you, like myself, think the screenwriting of Hollywood is preeminent, your preconceptions and standards will be completely altered after you view this extraordinary film. In over twenty years of movie watching, I have never had the degree of beauty and tragedy imparted to me as was done from this movie. I literally cried for nearly two hours after watching this. If you want to know what love is...herein lies the definition. Your sense of empathy and love will be catapulted to heights you only vaguely dream about.

8125614,5,B000FQJPA0,"A Moment to Remember is a 2004 Korean classic on the level of French masterpiece A Man and A Woman. It is more than a great love story. It is a piece of art.

The film centers on a young woman of privilege Kim Su-jin (Son Ye Jin) whose turbulent 20s have culminated in a failed affair and subsequent botched elopement with her older boss. As the facts are clearly in front of everyone at home and at work, a humiliated Kim Su-jin moves back in with her family and returns to the office. Aware and ashamed at what she has done to herself and her family, she maintains an understated dignity and quietly tries to move forward with the help of her mothers acceptance and more importantly, a Dad who fights his cultural instincts by fully accepting and supporting a daughter who seems to have had a somewhat stormy and zany youth.

After a brief encounter with a man Choi Chul Soo (Jeong Woo Sung) at a convenience store (a man who tried to take the Coca-Cola she forgot at the counter), she stumbles upon Chul Soo soon after when she accompanies her dad to a job site. Chul Soo turns out to be her Dads head foreman and carpenter.

After a short series of chance meetings, Chul Soo and Su-jin begin dating. The sweetness, playfulness and pure joy of finding each other is vividly portrayed in Spanish music and footage. As class status is very important in Korea, Su-jins parents (especially her dad) do not approve of Chul Soo, an orphan with no family and little formal education. But when her Dad sees how deeply his daughter loves Chul Soo, he puts up little fight and approves of the marriage.

Chul Soo turns out to be very responsible, outrageously smart, a great husband and a rising star in his father-in-laws construction business. He passes the architect license exam on the first try. That is when life begins to change. Su-jin becomes increasingly forgetful. Finally seeking medical help, she learns that at age 27, she has Alzheimers Disease. Her condition deteriorates steadily and rapidly.

There are several aspects of this movie that make it a masterpiece of a love story, a classic. First, there is the depth, quality and unshakable commitment that Su-jin and Chul Soo have for one another. They confront emotionally wrenching memories and betrayals from Chul Soos childhood, not because they have to but because Su-jin knows it is the right thing to do. She seeks intimacy with her husband and she wants her husband to resolve conflicts that torment him. Second, the relationship, as portrayed on the screen, is rare in cinema. There is a sweet, sensitive and realistic look into the games, teasing, inside jokes, hopes and fears that define their marriage. Theirs is a happy home. They both are lucky to have found each other and they know it.

But it is the cinematic treatment of the onset and progression of Alzheimers that sets this film apart. Here is a remarkable couple (with every resource at their disposal) finding themselves powerless to control or reverse the devastation wrought by a disease that robs a person of their memory  and therefore, their soul. But in spite of the destruction and ultimate consequence of a disease, the film portrays a couple and family that rises to the occasion. Hardship does not destroy Su-jin and Chul Soo and the principle characters in the movie. Rather, it brings out the best in each friend and family member as they come together to realize Chul Soos wishes.

You will find the ending very inspiring. And more than likely, you will watch it again and again. Korean film from director, John H. Lee, has done a masterful job. A Moment to Remember is brilliant. I have never seen anything quite like it.",1461196800,,3668,4.693623639191291

8125618,5,B000FQJPA0,A MOMENT TO REMEMBER is one of the most stunning films I have ever seen from any country. The story begins conventionally enough as a 27 year old Korean woman is heartbroken when her married lover dumps her by failing to meet her at a crowded train station. Her father takes her to a construction site where she sees a tall handsome carpenter and she falls heavily and instantly in love. Their passion is mutual and overwhelming. But the problem here is not only that her father opposes the match but by midfilm she learns that she has Alzheimer's and her memories of life and her husband will soon vanish. There is tearful and truly heartbreaking tragedy as everyone foresees the inevitable but no one can prevent it. The moments in which the husband and wife face her looming loss of memory are a tender battle to keep somehow even a spark of remembrance alive. The wife is there physically but soon enough no longer remembers her husband. There are two scenes of riveting power. The first occurs when just enough of her mind lingers to enable her to write a letter of love and memory to him. She calls this fleeting moment a celebration that must be treasured since it is only too short lived. The second takes place at the end when she dimly knows that her husband is somewhere locked into her body if not in her mind. Such a movie as this is a triumphant celebration of the human spirit that succeeds in moving us even if the dreaded illness takes yet another victim away from her loved ones.,1402272000,,1497,4.487179487179487
8125619,5,B000FQJPA0,One of my favorite Korean movies! I thought their acting was just too perfect! The plot will take you through the life of a young woman and the hardships she faces. Such a beautiful movie to watch. The ending was so sweet. You can feel the love!,1396051200,,245,4.23404255319149
8125620,5,B000FQJPA0,"First, we recommend to purchase always from Amazon directly. If Amazon UK does not sell directly, you can look Amazon USA, or any EU countries. We always buy directly from AMAZON, for AMAZON never offer second class customer services. For quality and safety of purchase, we recommend always directly purchase from AMAZON. If you cannot find the item you want not sold by AMAZON directly, request AMAZON to stock it. More people buy from AMAZON directly, the better price we get. Buying from AMAZON is win-win situation for both consumers and AMAZON as well. We get best price from the most trusted Global seller.

Now this is the review. This movie can be view with family. There is no sex so its safe for all ages. This is not a Korean or ethnic movie. The original theme was in Japanese TV drama called Kimi-ga-Boku-wo-Wasure-temo ( Even though you forget me ). In the original Japanese drama, it tackles with a couple with child. The wife and mother whose memories starts to fade due to the onslaught of disease, starts to write to the child so that the child can read about what happened to the mother when the child grew up. Unfortunately this original Japanese drama is not available at AMAZON, and we earnestly wish that AMAZON stock this original Japanese drama.

In this Korean production, there is no child. The movie is very well acted with the main protagonists, both heroine and the hero. The man really deserves the title of hero, as he shows the essential quality that humanity has had been cherishing from the time immemorial, such as forgiveness, loyalty, faithfulness, devotion and genuine love.

We have several multi-ethnic friends gathered to watch to view this movie ( all from Western EU so no bias favouring the production country ). The choice of music, the expression of actors ( not flashy words, emotional cliche, overt expression of love ), and the scene ( beautifully set against greenery and modern city of Seoul ), all things done so well. There is nothing about ethnic or cultural about this movie. The value or questions this movie poses to the viewers is universal.

Do you really love? What is love? Is love for Eros only? Is your love selfless? If you vow to love someone, in front of Creator and the assembly of witness ( here we mean Matrimony ), do you, can you stand by your word? The love depicted in this drama, fantastically played by the hero and reciprocated by the heroine reminds us almost Wagnerian, or Verdian depiction of love. Such opera as Der Ring von Nibelungen, Aida depicts similar ephemeral Love, love interspersed with humanly as well as heavenly love.

The hero of this movie does not act like 90% of men who just say love in order to get something from women. The hero belongs to the 10 % of men, who had, have, shall represent the person of integirity. He reminds us a lone wolf, a spartan, a stern but deeply caring characters depicted such movies as SEVEN SAMURAI or THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN ( get these from AMAZON directly ).

Despite different social status, the man, almost Benjamin Franklin like industriousness, strive to become architect from the daily hard life of construction labourer ( and eventually becomes one ). The heroine, the daughter of wealthy father is fated to meet the hero when the film hit us in a very subtle way that something may be happening to her mind. From then, without any ostentatious or difficult concoction, on the contrary quite naturally, the hero and the heroine are being brought together by the Hand of Destiny.

The father of the heroine, though initially against the companionship, after witnessing the incident, changes his mind agrees for giving her to the hero. The couple starts to live a happy life, while slowly and surely the disease invade the heroine's mind.

Intertwined with the theme of seducer, broken family, struggle, the movie slowly unfolds to the grand climax. The heroine slowly makes the hero whole, by genuine feminine way. And the hero, when confronted with the heroine's family for filing divorce ( so that he can remarry ), refuses, shows the true character of man. Never says love, but acts love. There is no need for English subtitle. Just watching the expression makes us understand what is going on.

It is easy to love when things are good. But true love cannot be just when things are all right. The movie, very very well acted, and very well matched by La Palma and other great music, is an Oasis in the days where majority of movies are just gross, cheap, and vulgar.

If you were to take a vow, or planning to take a vow, before doing so, watch this movie. And see the expression of other half.

Just so moving movie, because deep in our hearts. we yearn for the love of such quality.",1394841600,,4722,4.683956574185766
