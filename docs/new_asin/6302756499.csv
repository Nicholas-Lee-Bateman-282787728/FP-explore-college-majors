He was wounded, went to Hollywood and ended up a prolific and hard edged director. It would seem fitting that Wellman's last film would be LAFAYETTE ESCADRILLE. Unfortunately Wellman's status as a director had greatly diminished in Hollywood and so was the budget allotted for this would-be epic. Wellman tries to put what style he can into the aerial sequences but essentially this becomes a standard wartime love story via Tab Hunter. The film still boasts good photography by Cinematographer William Clothier and a score by Composer Leonard Rosenman and has an excellent cast including Clint Eastwood, David Janssen, Paul Fix, Will Hutchins, Tom Laughlin, Bret Halsey and William Wellman Jr.",994204800,12,865,5.013888888888889
513306,2,6302756499,"This video was interesting in a couple of areas. It has early appearances  from Clint Eastwood, Tom Laughlin (Billy Jack), David Jansen.  Some of  the early training flights are interesting in their realism.  But, it is  not a movie for airplane buffs. Or WW1 historians. Or war movie fans.  It  is a love story based on a young American boy, who makes some mistakes,  fights with his father, and runs off to join the war. While there, he falls  in love, makes more mistakes, grows up, repents, etc.... everyone lives  happily ever after.  American Movie Classic buffs will enjoy it (once).  Airplane buffs will hate it (wrong airplanes). WW1 buffs will hate it (no  history here, except opening credits). War movie buffs will hate it (they  call that a battle scene?)  Two stars is all I can give.  END",904176000,40,803,4.669064748201439
513376,3,6302756499,"Slow moving film about bad rich kid that gets his act together bogs down in melodrama.  (This was the same problem that hurt  Wellman's Darby's Rangers.)  Original title C'est La Guerrre is more apt.

Early training with Bleriots is the best that this film has to offer.  Some other types are brought in as they transition to fighter squadrons.  Our deserter hero comes back in with the AEF and is assigned to Rickenbacker's squadron, though we don't meet him.  He is nearly shot down flying alone when his opponent's gun jams, though he is oblivious to it.  He lands at the Escadrille aerodrome and tags along with his old buddies on their patrol and makes good during last 10 minutes of film which has all of the dogfight action.

The original ending with our hero shot down is indicated in the narrative intro to the Escadrille members in their barracks, as most of them die in combat.  This would have made a sadder but more appropriate film.",1431129600,,946,4.610778443113772

Etchika Choureau is the love interest. The film also features David Janssen, Will Hutchins, Brett Halsey, Tom Laughlin, Paul Fix and Clint Eastwood. The score was composed by Leonard Rosenman. LAFAYETTE ESCADRILLE compared to William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman's other films may seem a bit superficial working from Albert Sidney Fleischman's screenplay. Wellman, Clothier and Rosenman do make up for a lot of this. William Clothier's aerial sequences were excellent. The viewer really had to juxtapose the thrill of those sequences against bland dialogue and an unimaginative love story. But as someone once said, living is racing (flying this case) and everything is waiting. If you can grasp that, you can see the greatness in LAFAYETTE ESCADRILLE.",1416009600,,1445,5.255411255411255

Tab Hunter is very serious as the main character running away from home problems. This is a story about some little known history, Americans going to France during World War one to get into the Air Force. You couldn't get me in one of those kite-like planes.

513384,2,6302756499,"Starring a young Paul Newman and, in his first major role, Clint Eastwood, director William Wellman returned to the theme of his Oscar-winning Wings and his own experiences as an American pilot flying for the French in World War One with 1958's epic Lafayette Escadrille, a fitting swansong for one of the great directors of the golden age - or at least that's what SHOULD have happened. Instead Jack Warner balked at the budget, insisted on casting Tab Hunter instead of the lesser-known actors (Eastwood's role went to David Janssen, leaving him in a small bit part), added a happier ending and cut the film to ribbons in post-production before changing the title to Hell Bent for Glory, with the bitterly disillusioned director never making another film. The scars are all too visible in the rushed pacing and jarring plotholes left by scenes that never made it to the final cut, the opening of the film in particular looking like someone attempted to crudely shoehorn 20 minutes of plot development from an already badly compromised script into five minutes of surviving footage that looks like it's been edited with a lawnmower.

Some moments do survive, but they're few and far between. The heroes' first night in their barracks moves from a flat comic scene to a quietly mournful one where Wellman's own narration identifies of the real-life pilots sleeping alongside them by name and describes their impending deaths, and its here that you see the kind of no-nonsense tribute to the friends he left behind that he so clearly wanted to make. Wellman himself is actually a supporting character in the film, played by his own son, while Tab Hunter's hero isn't a million miles away from the kind of troubled delinquent `Wild Bill' was himself, a spoiled brat running away from a hit-and-run accident (it's tempting to see Wellman's original ending that saw him die as a kind of survivor's guilt that so many who survived the Great War when `better' men died sometimes expressed).

Unfortunately the result is just a flat, Earthbound backlot melodrama with some variably staged service comedy that abandons the fledgling fliers at the halfway point as Hunter deserts to marry Etchika Choureau's hustler-turned-nice-girl. Choureau's a pretty girl and there's a nice sequence with her blowing on the sleeping Hunter's face to wake him up, but they never make a strong or convincing enough couple to make you regard their romance as anything but a distraction from what a film called Lafayette Escadrille should really be about. The film rarely gets off the ground and does little that's interesting when it does, becoming surprisingly dreary in the mid-section with Hunter hiding out in her apartment and making a furtive living trawling bars and persuading servicemen to visit one of the local brothels. Naturally his conscience gets the better of him when the film finally realises there's a war on (something there's very little sense of for most of the running time) and he rejoins the squadron, earns his wings and the film finally gets round to having some aerial footage and a dogfight in the last reel. This footage is often quite good, but it's too little too late, feeling arbitrarily slapped on. Worse, there's no real connection to or affection for the character to get you involved, something that would have been just as big a problem had the original ending where Hunter died and his sweetheart committed suicide been retained. All in all it's a sad swansong for a great director and a poor memorial to the pioneer air aces he flew alongside.

Still, Warner Home Video's extras-free manufactured-on-demand PAL DVD-R at least offers a very decent black and white widescreen transfer and Leonard Rosenman's score finds a better love theme for its main characters than the film probably deserves.",1399248000,4,3810,4.978021978021978
513385,4,6302756499,"This movie was made by Bill Wellman (WINGS) as his swan-song for Jack Warner and WARNER BROS Pictures.  It starred Tab Hunter as probably the third movie he made as 'contract-player' for WARNER BROS, who Wellman cast after Hunter had made ""Track of the Cat"" (1955).  It was based on Wellman's own experiences as an American, who volunteered to go to FRANCE, to fight as a 'pilot' in the 'first' World War I.
The biplanes used in the training sequences are really remarkable in their simple construction; followed by more sophisticated planes for the fight sequences.  They make you feel for the American boys flying those planes at that time.  Hunter's fellow cast members are interesting to see as they all emerged as successful actors in the following years.  (see if you can recognize them! in the back-grounds.)
Tab Hunter wrote a biography (published 2005) that goes into the making of the movie in which he described the original ending having Hunter shot down to crash on French soil, while his French 'girl-friend' jumps off a bridge to end her life, in ending the movie.  Finishing the movie, everyone went their own way, only to be called back together again after several months to reshoot the ending.  Jack Warner wanted a ""Happy-Ending""!  So Warner had to rent Paramount's French back-lot for Hunter and his mistress to run into each other's arms for . . .  F A D E - O U T !  THE END!",1390435200,2,1398,4.646341463414634

The tall handsome young man a few over in many scenes is the man Wellman wanted to star in the movie but the studio balked.... too bad because as anyone can tell it is Clint Eastwood.
