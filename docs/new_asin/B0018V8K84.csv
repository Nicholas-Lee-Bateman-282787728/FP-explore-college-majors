The best way to watch this movie is to snuggle up with your loved ones with hot choco and enough snacks to last the movie.
I love to use kruidnoten, which is a cinnamon spiced treat we eat around these days.

The title of this movie ""Alles is liefde"" means Everything is love",1351987200,2,458,4.193181818181818
