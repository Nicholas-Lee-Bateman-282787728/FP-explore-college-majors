8376134,5,B002OLT6ZI,"I got this DVD for watching with my homeschooled kids during our Ancient Greece unit and they found it very interesting. Not too long but had great information and graphics and descriptions. They all liked it very much. Explained some scientific principles with great demonstrations and showed great underwater finds and great ship models as well as navigation principles etc. Included info on Archimedes, Aristotle, Eratosthenes and more. Also great information on the Battle of Salamis. Great footage from Greece. It showed how smart the Ancient Greeks really were. The kids also enjoyed seeing the modern ships and equipment and all. I'll be checking out the other titles in this series - especially the one about Roman travel.",1270512000,2,730,5.194915254237288
