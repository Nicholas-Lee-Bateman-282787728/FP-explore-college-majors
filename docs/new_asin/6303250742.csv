636540,5,6303250742,"David Mamet made a brilliant try to reproduce and enhance the play, but I believe this is the best version. It has a wonderful minor - and yes, I do mean minor - performance by Robert Donat. For me, the central performance is that of the father who absolutely will not give up. His declining health and spirits are no bar to his determination to not let matters rest. When his son is accused of stealing, he stands by him no matter what the cost - and the cost is high. Cedric Hardwicke gives the performance of his life and he has not been equalled. If you have dry eyes at the end, then there is little hope for you. It is a film to be loved and adored.",1018569600,8,655,4.0852713178294575
636541,5,6303250742,"This is a marvelously acted English drama, typical of the genre for its time, but superior in its casting. Based upon the play by Terrence Rattigan, the film takes place in England during the early part of the twentieth century, before the advent of World War I. A thirteen year old Naval cadet is expelled for stealing a postal order. He claims he did not do it, despite seeming evidence to the contrary. His upstanding family stands behind him and supports him. After going to the Naval academy from which he was expelled, where their entreaties fall upon deaf ears, they decide to take the unprecedented step of suing the Crown.
The family retains the services of the well respected barrister, Sir Robert Morton, cooly played with dash by the ever wonderful Robert Donat, who agrees to represent the boy. The case becomes a cause celebre all over England, and Sir Morton's client becomes known as that Winslow boy, a notoriety that shakes the boy's very proper family to its core. While the case wends its way through the British legal system, tension between the boy's intelligent, bluestocking sistersister, beautifully played by the talented Margaret Leighton, and his barrister bubbles to the surface, and the sparks begin to fly.
The old time English courtroom scenes that follow will satisfy all legal beagles and lovers of courtroom drama. The resolution of the suit is somewhat predictable, but enhanced by the delicious wit of the dialogue and the wonderful performances by the entire cast. The movie ends on a note of romantic hope, as it does not lament what might have been between the barrister and the boy's sister, but, instead, augers what is surely to come.
All in all, this is a terrific movie with a stellar cast.",998524800,14,1735,4.845117845117845

Wonderful story line and acting on all parts.  Donat is brilliant as Sir Robert Morton, the lawyer engaged by Arthur Winslow to clear his son Ronald's name of theft from the naval academy.  His panache and dignity during the examination of Ronald and later speech in the House of Commons is worth watching again and again.  Margaret Leighton does a wonderful job portraying Kate, the sister who is steadfastly convinced of her brother's innocence and refuses to give up the case despite personal losses.

636743,5,6303250742,This 1948 movie has a cast of endearing characters. My favorite was Neil North who played the part of Ronnie Winslow and Robert Donat who played the part of Sir Robert Morton the British solicitor who took on the case of The Winslow Boy. This movie was an exciting progression of events from beginning to ending from Ronnie Winslow's expulsion from a young (12 and up) naval cadet college in England to his acquittal at the end of the movie (for stealing). I loved it,1404950400,,467,4.5058823529411764
636744,5,6303250742,"I watch this film for the always handsome, charming Donat (who doesnt appear until about 25 minutes in); but the entire ensemble is breathtaking. Cedric Hardwicke is a model of understated righteous rage: He never raises his voice, but his intensity vibrates off the screen. Marvelous Marie Lohr (mother to Leslie Howards Henry Higgins in Pygmalion) is perfection as the wife - I can easily imagine her as the wife of Thomas Moore in A Man for All Seasons. Jack Watling makes the slacker brother completely true and likeable. Exquisite, impossibly slender Margaret Leighton is lovely as the suffragette sister (and watching her, I finally realize whom Laura Linney has reminded me off all these years). Basil Radford for once is touching and dignified vs. amusingly ridiculous as the family solicitor (his WWI cheek scar visible in a number of scenes). Kathleen Harrison might at times seem overdone as the maid Violet, but she embodies the passionate nature so carefully guarded by the other Edwardian-era players here - plus her performance matches her delightful turn as Alastair Sims housekeeper in that other gold standard film Scrooge based on Dickens Christmas Carol. Neil North is the boy, and I understand he played the First Lord of the Admiralty in the Mamet film (need to watch that again). Frank Lawton as the faithless boy next door: Terrific in MGMs 1935 David Copperfield but I also know him from Cavalcade, semi-classic horror movie The Devil Doll and The Invisible Ray, recent discovery (for me) Went the Day Well? and of course the gold standard (overusing that - for this, should perhaps say platinum standard) version of the story of the Titanic A Night to Remember. Ernest Thesiger  Dr. Pretorius in The Bride of Frankenstein  makes a compelling appearance as alleged handwriting expert and horses ass witness Mr. Ridgely-Pierce. Mona Washbourne and Wilfrid Hyde-White also appear, but it is the brief music hall appearances of Stanley Holloway (Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady) and especially Cyril Ritchard (Captain Hook to Mary Martins Peter Pan) that completely delight. Holloways song Wait and See is also a sly nod to the films director: The title alludes to then Prime Minister Herbert Asquiths policies, and Asquith was the father of Anthony Asquith (who also directed Pygmalion).",1402185600,3,2311,5.094986807387863
636745,4,6303250742,"A charming old fashioned version of the play which is far superior to the remake. In this outing we actually see  both parliamentary debate and court procedure and get an explanation of what the phrase let right be done actually means.

 When young Ronnie Winslow is expelled from naval college for stealing five shillings, his family rallies around him in support of his innocence. While his elderly and newly retired father ruins his own health and nearly bankrupts the family pursuing justice in a court of law, his older sister, a suffragette, take his cause up on principle, sacrificing her marriage settlement and reputation in the process.

Soon their case is taken up by the elegant Sir Robert Morton who will challenge the Crown on the basis of a petition of right -and it is a marvel of Common Law that an ordinary citizen is permitted to do so.

Wonderful performances all around particularly by Cedric Hardwick and Robert Donat, and Margaret Leighton who is both strong minded  and feminine enough to wear the charming hats which attract Sir Robert -who admires both qualities.",1398902400,2,1089,4.891304347826087
636746,4,6303250742,"By comparison with today's more pacey films, Anthony Asquith's version of the Terence Rattigan classic might seem somewhat slow, with long shots focused on the protagonists' faces and frequent use of the shot/reverse shot technique.  As a piece of character-focused drama, however, the film could not be bettered.  Set just before the outbreak of World War I, the film concentrates on the trial of a thirteen-year-old boy (Neil North), wrongly accused of stealing a postal order.  His father (Cedric Hardwicke) is determined to fight the case, and engages top prosecuting counsel Sir Robert Morton (Robert Donat) to plead the case.  While the film works as a courtroom drama, its main focus is on characterization; those small facial gestures that appear to say so little but actually say a whole lot about the protagonists' preoccupations.  The Winslow family are concerned to maintain their English sang-froid, but that becomes very difficult as the case wears on.  Hardwicke is quite brilliant at showing how the case affects Mr. Winslow; his tired expression as the film unfolds is rapidly superseded by a small smile as he discovers the result and staggers outside to talk to the press.  Initially Donat appears as something of a cold fish, but he admits to Winslow's daughter Kate (Margaret Leighton) by the end that this is a facade constructed purely for public consumption.  The ending is quite unexpected for both of them.  For lovers of British variety of the mid-twentieth century, the film contains the added bonus of two performances by Cyril Ritchard and Stanley Holloway.",1398124800,,1587,5.143968871595331

He avows he is innocent, and his family supports him. The ensuing conflict puts a very heavy strain on the family, and shoves them into constant public notice.

The story is very dramatic and goes beyond a child accused of theft, to the proper role of government to do right.

The acting is excellent, and the role of Catherine has been strengthened so that she is the major advocate for her brother, which increases the interest of the best barrister in England, Sir Robert Morton, in pursuing a romantic relationship with her.

636848,4,6303250742,"One of my favorite films, ""The Winslow Boy"" is a showcase for Robert Donat, with his melancholy face and beautiful voice, and for the underused Margaret Leighton, who plays one of the rare women on film whose character is defined almost entirely by integrity.  One of the pleasures of the film is watching as these two perform the elaborate social pavanne of Edwardian London, moving by the most indirect steps imaginable towards a relationship.

Cedric Hardwicke is also especially good.

The real question is:  why on earth hasn't this movie been released on DVD in the US?",1264809600,,575,4.896907216494846
636849,5,6303250742,"Based on an actual event, playwright Terence Rattigan's The Winslow Boy had its London debut in 1946, opened on Broadway in 1947 and was released on film in 1948.  Directed by Anthony Asquith, the film stars the great Robert Donat as Sir Robert Morton KC, Cedric Hardwicke as Arthur Winslow, and Margaret Leighton as the radiant daughter, Catherine Winslow.

Set on the eve of the first World War, the  plot examines a comfortably middle class family whose tranquil existence is shattered when the youngest son, Ronnie, is accused of stealing a postal money order from another cadet at the Naval Academy he attends.  The expelled boy protests his innocence and his father begins a lengthy and costly battle to clear his name.  Ironically, this fight for right ends up extracting a personal toll from everyone involved except the accused.  Mr. Winslow engages the brilliant barrister Morton to defend his son, although Catherine is vehemently opposed to him on philosophical grounds and considers him ""a cold fish"" to boot.

The beautifully crafted movie alternates between intimate domestic settings to  public gatherings in the House of Commons and a courtroom. Much of the exposition is cleverly reported as newspaper headlines, overheard conversations, news boys cries, etc. The script follows the Roman stage convention of having much of the action happen off-stage and reported by the actors. The dramatic trial conclusion is actually delivered by the Winslow's maid Violet in her strident Cockney accent.

Sexual tension develops between Sir Robert and Catherine at their first meeting when he arrives at the Winslow home to decide whether to take the case. Expecting her fiance when she answers the door, when Sir Robert is standing there instead, she greets the seemingly supercilious man dismissively, ""Oh, I was expecting a friend"" but nonetheless he enters into her home and life. This viewer desperately wishes Rattigan had written a fourth act to explore the attraction between the conservative barrister and the contrary, cigarette-smoking suffragette.",1248652800,3,2066,5.293577981651376
636850,5,6303250742,"The plot is ever green, witness its many incarnations on stage
and screen. Terence Rattigan was the quintessential British
playwright of the '40s and '50s. Sometimes, as in this instance,
he used actual events to draw upon. The great British actor Robert Donat is the main reason to watch this film, his handsome face and
flawless diction. Hollywood kept trying to become his home, Hitchcock in particular wanted him. But he wasn't happy in La-La Land, so remained in Britain even through the war years. In demand for both stage and screen work, he husbanded his physical resources and did both. Afflicted with chronic asthma from childhood, his life was cut short at the age of 58. His signature role for Americans is Mr. Chips. Watch him in this film for the sublety and wit he brings to rather formal dialogue. The supporting cast is first rate, led by a very young Margaret Leighton.",1243987200,,887,4.766233766233766
636851,4,6303250742,"I love to watch movies with good remakes.  Such is the case with The Winslow Boy.  Both this and the 1999 remake are excellent.  Unfortunately, there appears to be no decent print of this version, and I reluctantly deduct one star.  But my copy, though mediocre, was not unwatchable on a small screen, and I was soon engrossed in the movie.

The treat of this version is to see two masters, Cedric Hardwicke and Robert Donat, at their peak.  I particularly enjoyed comparing Donat's portrayal of the lawyer with Jeremy Northam's portrayal in the later Mamet version.  Both are masters of insouciance.  The supporting cast is fine also, especially Neil North in the title role.  And then, there's the great director Anthony Asquith, who puts it all together.

This fascinating study, by Terence Rattigan, of the English version of due process leaves us wondering not only about the guilt or innocence of the Winslow boy but also whether there is something other than due process in the soul of the lawyer.  Ambivalence describes both our feelings about the Winslow boy and the lawyer's feelings about the Winslow ""girl"".  Interesting parallel.

The Mamet version has the advantage of looking wonderful, but don't let the poor print quality of this one put you off.  It's well worth the watch.",1228262400,,1291,4.889400921658986

636854,5,6303250742,"The Winslow Boy tells the story of a family's effort to prove that an English schoolboy has been unjustly expelled from school, on a false charge of taking a postal money order. In recent years, a well-done David Mamet film based on the Terence Rattigan play renewed interest in this work. The Robert Donat 1950 version uses most of the same material to tell the story with an entirely different shading. Donat is masterful as the barrister retained to defend the boy's honor--he is as accomplished in this role as in so many other roles he brought to life. Margaret Leighton, as the boy's elder sister, shimmers in this film, with a cinematic aura lost to actors in this more computer-generated age.

The Winslow Boy story holds the viewer's interest consistently, and the directorial touch here is light and deft. In contrast to the Mamet film, this earlier film is less self-conscious in its effort to tell the ""psychological story"" of the trauma that fighting for justice imposes upon a family, and more direct about telling a jaunty good tale. But make no mistake--this film tells a simple but effective story about the cost of doing the right thing that resonates fifty years later.

This movie is a grand bit of cinematic magic and a crackling good story. I highly recommend this video.",1096588800,13,1293,4.79372197309417
636855,3,6303250742,"This film adapts a play by Terence Rattigan, first staged in 1946. The author had a great story. An ordinary citizen battles the British government to gain a fair trial for his son, who has been expelled from a junior naval academy for the crime of stealing.
In the play, the father's crusade is important, but not the main dish. Rather, the focus is on the impact of the crusade on the boy's family circle, and how they respond. Every scene occurs within the home. The whole country may be arguing about the case, but the arguments we hear -- whether the boy is guilty; whether, even if innocent, his expulsion warrants so much fuss -- are made or quoted en famille.
This movie adaptation, on the contrary, moves out into the world where the public fight takes place: in the offices of naval officials, in the British House of Commons, and before the Lord Chief Justice. The approach is exciting, and makes it easy for the audience to follow the stages of the battle. A disadvantage is that it leaves less chance to experience what the play says about people and about life.
Usually, in dramas about battles for justice, a wrong has been done. The business of the action is to right the wrong. However, in Rattigan's play, it is never clear that a wrong has occurred. Although the play helps us believe that Ronnie Winslow did not cash a stolen money order as charged, at least one member of his family thinks he did, and no proof emerges that he did not.
If we assume he was innocent, did the degree of wrong to him warrant the battle waged, and the sacrifices it entailed? There is no indication of animus against Ronnie on the part of the academy, which had strong evidence for thinking him guilty. If their finding was incorrect, it seems a reasonable mistake. Moreover, the boy is happy in another school, and increasingly uninterested in the crusade. In these circumstances, how grave is the wrong? Does it justify the enormous public attention it receives, or the physical, social and financial costs to members of his family?
The play raises these questions stubbornly and extensively. That doesn't halt the action, which perseveres, as often in real life, toward a goal whose worth is uncertain. The movie, focused primarily on winning the battle, tends to pull away from the play's uncertainties. Nevertheless, in one respect it adds to them. When it takes us to court, it shows the family's lawyer running circles, fairly and unfairly, around the opposition. Is a battle for justice, unjustly waged, a battle for justice?
Robert Donat is very good as the family's forensic champion. I might have thought excellent, had I not been spoiled by Ian Richardson's superb (matchless? definitive?) performance of the role in a PBS broadcast of the intact play in 1988. As the father, Cedric Hardwicke is insufficiently forceful and expressive. Margaret Leighton as the daughter is pretty, but insubstantial. Neil North does well as the expelled boy. Cameo appearances by Cyril Ritchard and Stanley Holloway are fun.",1033344000,12,3019,4.8076923076923075

I had previously seen the 1970s version as well as the late 90s version by David Mamet, both of which I also loved.  Had been on the lookout for this 1948/50 version for quite some time and was so happy it just became available here on Amazon.com and I found out about it yesterday.

7845161,5,6303250742,"I liked this version of the play very much more than the 1999 version.  For some reason, this version felt more compelling, each character's personality is better displayed.  We see what a sop the elder son is, are shown the daughter's idealistic view of the world, and the mother's nonjudgmental acceptance of her children, just as they are.  The Father is portrayed as righteous, fairly unbending, and often disappointed.  As time  passes, we see he is a mere human realizing the cost of his ideals.  The accused-son states his story and innocence so that's it hard to know whether he's lying or telling the truth.  Actually, we are never given access to the truth--since guilt/innocence is not what this story is about. The boy's attorney is portrayed as mysterious, accusatory, and states pride in his own ability to separate ""justice"" from ""morals"" (right and wrong).
I suggest you hang in there with this movie, it can seem quiet, elitist, and overwhelmingly boring at it's beginning.  But that's simply due to the playwright wanting to portray a typically self-centered, upper-class family as it goes about its daily lifestyle.  It's also due to the players not overwhelming the parts they're given, allowing the story to become a sum of its parts.  Let this story quietly pull you in, you'll likely not forget it.
For such a very ""dry"" story, I have to admit that, while hearing Violet's tale of the trial's verdict, I put my hands over my face and cried.  I rarely do this at movies.  You'll have your own reasons, but for me, filling in the blanks of the verdict's aftermath brought me to tears.  Highly recommend spending some quiet moments watching this film.",1489190400,2,1671,4.841549295774648

This is a stuffy English movie based on a classic play. Excellent acting, interesting story, but I missed many details because the dialogue in this film is hard to hear clearly much of the time. The British English is spoken so quickly and in lowered tones at times I missed what was said. Nevertheless, its worth a look but not a necessity.",1483488000,,472,4.698795180722891
