The Chris Jericho-Nick Patrick match was a dumb waste of time and the same goes for the Sherri Martel-Col. Robert Parker match. The match between Jeff Jarrett & The Giant was not great but pretty good. The Harlem Heat-Amazing French-Canadians tag team bout was pretty hard-hitting & fun for a tag team match. The 3 way bout for World tag team titles was ok for a 3 way match. The 3-ring,60 man battle royal(aka World War 3) was a high-flying,hard-hitting,entertaining bout for a battle royal. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1280534400,,682,4.991228070175438

WORLD WAR 3

In 1995 World Championship Wrestling debuted a new pay-per-view with a cool little twist; it was like the WWF's Royal Rumble but with 30 more guys and 2 more rings. Still this was before WCW was on a roll but you could tell at the time it was on a come up.

1.[TV CHAMPIONSHIP]-JOHNNY B BAD VS DDP-the opening contest was not only for the TV title but also for the services of Kim [DDP's valet] this seemed like a usual story line for DDP. For those who do not know Johnny is none other than Marc Mero of WWF fame, just in case you did not know. This was a pretty good opening match especially for DDP in that time period, this was before he learned to play to the crowd as well as he did later on. They both on a good match with some good action and high impact moves, I would say both did a good job with this bout. Johnny goes on to win this match and win Kim retaining his title, but that did not last to long. 3.8/5

2.[TAPPED FIST MATCH]-BIG BUBBA VS JIM DUGGAN-this was a tapped fist match between two bigger guys so obviously this was going to be one big brawl, Big Bubba was The Big Boss Man in the WWF for those who need to know. This was one big fight full of fists and clotheslines and a lot of ""USA"" chanting, yes that would be Duggan starting all that. This is one giant brawl that goes from ring to ring for the entire match, as far as fights go this is a pretty good one. We get a little bit of drama going on when Duggan gets tapped to the ropes, Bubba wins the match after VK Wall Street  [IRS in the WWF] gives him a chain to hit Jim with. 3/5

3. CUTIE SUZUKI, MAYYUMI OZAKI VS BULL NAKANA, AKIRA HOKUTO-this was actually a very entertaining match, actually it is not surprising because these are women who are there because this is their craft [forget divas]. Bull and Akira are a very dominating and intimidating team, Bull in particular because I would not fight her. This is one of the best matches of the night and this is what women's wrestling should be, the closest thing we got is the Knockouts in TNA. Speaking of TNA a lot of the things that happen in this match are very much like the X Division, except this was long before TNA was thought of. The action in this bout is really good and really outshines a lot of the men that were in WCW at the time, think X Division in TNA and the cruiserweights in WCW now picture that with women. 4.5/5

4.[US CHAMPIONSHIP]-KENSUKI SASAKI VS CHRIS BENOIT-this is a great technical match up between these two as the go back and forth with great ring psychology. This is the type of match that WCW was known for amongst real wrestling fans who enjoyed great action, Benoit was really on point in this match as was Sasaki. Kensuki takes the win and retains his title after a devastating brain buster like move, compared to the rest of the event this may be the best match on the card. Excellent match between two great wrestlers, to bad about Chris. 5/5

5.""MACHO MAN"" RANDY SAVAGE VS LEX LUGER-this is a pretty good match and fits the story line perfectly, it sets up Macho's win in the battle royal. After a decent amount of action Luger ends up taking this one even though Savage should have one this one. This was a good match and worth seeing especially if you are a fan of either one of these guys. Sting plays a part in this towards the end of the match, actually right at the end. 3.8/5

6. STING VS RIC FLAIR-this is one of the better matches from the event as both of these guys go at it once more in their long standing feud. The action is good and has a back and forth flow to it, both come to win in this one. This is not their best match but like all the others it is not bad, in fact it is really good. Sting wins this match after applying a scorpion death lock. It was a little surprising that their was really no interference in this match, the Horsemen and Savage/Luger/Hogan stay out of it. 4.5/5

7. BATTLE ROYAL-this is the first of what would become a mainstay for the company and was WCW's answer to the WWF's Royal Rumble, I like this event and concept but the Royal Rumble is much better in my opinion. Still even though it is kinda hard to follow at times it is still a very interesting match. Like any special match like this you will enjoy it, this one comes down two Savage and Hogan. And even though Savage was going to win this any way of course they have to make Hogan look like he was cheated. Randy Savage has always been way beyond Hogan and in a whole other league, why can't they even just let him win. This gets five out of five because Savage wins the title and also because it is entertaining. 5/5

Over all this was a pretty good event and this show would get better over the years.",1233964800,,4707,4.1683168316831685
7856657,4,6303925537,"Another old WCW PPV I found in an old box.  To catch everyone up on what was going on during this time, Hulk Hogan lost the WCW Championship to Giant at Halloween Havoc when Jimmy Hart turned on Hogan costing him the championship due a technicality but WCW stripped Giant of the belt & held it up to the winner of the World War 3 Battle Royal (similar situation to setup the Royal Rumble match in '92).  Also Lex Luger revealed himself to be a member of the Dungeon Of Doom at Halloween Havoc & aided in a attack on Randy Savage & Hogan.  Ric Flair also turned on Sting at that PPV to reform the 4 Horsemen with Arn Anderson & Brian Pillman (Chris Benoit would join weeks later) to set up their revenge match.

WCW Television Champion Johnny B. Badd vs. Dallas Page - In addition to the TV Title being on the line, Badd gets the services of the Diamond Doll Kimberly if he wins the match.  Just like their previous Havoc match, they kicked this PPV off with a bang with good back & forth wrestling with plenty of close nearfalls to keep the crowd on it's toes.  Great match that saw Badd free the Diamond Doll from Page.

Taped Fist Match: Jim Duggan vs. Big Bubba - Just like you would expect from these two, this was just a wild brawl that went across all three rings & the ringside area before V.K. Wallstreet aided Big Bubba to victory.

Bull Nakano & Akira Hokuto vs. Mayumi Ozaki & Cutie Suzuki - This was a special womens wrestling match from New Japan Pro Wrestling as part of the working agreement WCW & NJPW had leading into the ""World Cup"" battle they had the next month at Starrcade.  Good womens wrestling match but nothing really noteworthy here.  As a side note, it's ironic that the two women who beat Madusa/Alundra Blaze for the womens championships in WWE (Nakano) & WCW (Hokuto) were teammates here.

United States Champion Kensuke Sasaki vs. Chris Benoit - This was Benoit's PPV debut in his most famous run in WCW along with his debut as a member of the 4 Horsemen.  This match heavily resembled the japanese ""stong stiff"" style of wrestling as these two had a good back & forth wrestling match.

Randy Savage vs. Lex Luger - Well, this match heavily resembled their Halloween Havoc match in that it was too short to really become something special but it was good for what it was in that small time & better than the Havoc match in the fact that this didn't come off as a filler.  The bigger story was what happened afterwards with Luger & Sting.

Sting vs. Ric Flair - This match doesn't come close to matching their more famous earlier encounters like the first Clash Of The Champions or Great American Bash '90 but it was better than some of their later matches like the last WCW Nitro & the unification title match in '94.  This was all about Sting looking for revenge for Flair turning on him as Sting was very aggressive towards Flair, who kept running into another ring whenever Sting was building momentum.  Flair eventually was able to start working on Sting's leg but it wasn't enough as Sting just overpowered Flair to victory.

World War 3 60 Man Battle Royal for the WCW Championship - Due to the circumstances surrounding Halloween Havoc, this battle royal would determine the new WCW Champion.  This was a three ring battle royal with 20 men in each ring with the gimmick of having a ""giant"" in each ring (Hogan, Yeti, Giant) & when a ring has 10 men left, those 10 men are to move over to ring one to finish the match.  With there being three seperate rings (each with their own announce team), this match was a big cluster which made it really hard to watch & keep up with everything going on in the beginning with the only highlight at that time being the Yeti being eliminated right at the start of the match.  The match was easy to follow when everyone got into ring one with various highlights being Luger & Savage fighting over the coarse of two rings, members of the Dungeon Of Doom fighting each other, and Hogan's ""elimination"" before Randy Savage won the match & crowned the new WCW Champion.

In the end, this PPV made up for the disappointing Halloween Havoc the previous month & delivered good to strong wrestling matches.  There are a few flaws but overall, pretty good overall event from WCW during this time that I would recommend for the tape collection at a REASONABLE price.",1218672000,2,4332,4.455696202531645
7856658,3,6303925537,"Yes this is actually World War 3 '95, but WCW didn't release the tape until early '96 and stupidly titled the release ""World War 3 '96. Go figure! This can't help anyone potentially interested in buying old wrestling videos who hasn't already seen them as it is very confusing to those not in the know. This was the first of these events and,if memory serves features one of Sabu's few WCW matches.",1117929600,,398,4.541666666666667
7856659,4,6303925537,"In November of 1995, the now-defunct WCW (owned by Ted Turner) took its first major PPV step in leaping past Vince McMahon's WWF for almost two years in the mid-to-late 1990's.

Watching this event, one could call it WCW's version of a WWF Royal Rumble pay-per-view where there are maybe five or six matches and then the main event battle royal.  Specifically, World War 3 has 60 (yes, 60) wrestlers battling each other at the same time.

Match # 1

T.V. Champion Johnny B. Badd (Marc Mero) vs. ""DDP"" Diamond Dallas Page: 3 1/2 stars .... I am tempted to call this match a poor man's effort at resembling the WWF's Savage vs. Steamboat series (circa 1987). In all fairness, though, Badd and Page set the event on a roll by displaying some great in-ring chemistry. Meanwhile, Page's valet/wife, Kimberly, is at ringside using the gimmick of holding up a score card whenever the obnoxious Page demands adulation. Unfortunately, Page isn't the one who scores a ""10,"" since he loses the match and finally, his valet, to Badd ending their lengthy feud.

Match # 2

Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs. the late Big Bubba Rogers (aka Big Bossman) in a taped fist match: 1 1/2 stars ..... Two ex-WWFers go at each other in a barely watchable slugfest.  Mike Rotundo (ex-I.R.S.) makes a cameo appearance to no avail.  Bobby Heenan's sarcastic commentary is the only plus.

Match # 3

Chris Benoit vs. U.S. Champion Kensuki Sasaki: 4 1/2 stars .... A youthful Benoit displays his awesome future potential against Sasaki in a losing effort. It is arguably the best singles match of the event because the ending isn't a foregone conclusion.

Match # 4

""Macho Man"" Randy Savage vs. Lex Luger: 3 stars .... Luger and an injured Savage viciously battle one another, as Savage initially takes the upper hand. Then, the devious Jimmy Hart intervenes on Luger's behalf to help defeat an overpowered ""Macho Man."" Overall, the match here is decent, but it is also a disappointment because of its short length.  Sting's brief presence provides an added bonus.

Match # 5

The Japanese women's tag team match is excellent and well worth watching. 4 1/2 stars

Match # 6

Sting vs. Ric Flair: 4 1/2 stars ..... Even though it seems like the one millionth time these two guys have faced off, their in-ring chemistry remains superb.  This time, Sting seeks vengeance on Flair for double-crossing him (once again) a few weeks earlier. Without the World Title at stake, it seems inevitable that Flair won't escape with the victory. Sting makes sure he doesn't.

Match # 7

60-Man, 3-Ring Battle Royal for the vacant WCW World Title: 5 stars ...... On paper, this concept must have sounded great, but the result is initially difficult to watch because of the awkward camera logistics.  Using a distracting split-screen view for all three rings, you have to peer very closely to see which wrestler is in which ring.  Once the final 25 or so participants are in one ring together, the match is a blast to watch!

Virtually every wrestler in WCW (including several major ex-WWFers from the mid-to late 1980's) participate in this one, although there are some rather dubious characters, such as  the ""Yeti"" and members of the Dungeon of Doom.

The finale has a battered Savage managing to survive to claim his first WCW World Title, but his moment of glory is somewhat spoiled by a confrontation with a jealous Hulk Hogan over the ""controversial"" finish.

7856661,5,6303925537,"This was one of WCW's all-time greatest events.  This was really World War 3 (1995) though.  Pretty much all the matches were great.  Johnny B. Badd vs. Diamond Dallas Page was a great match, with Kimberly leaving with the  Television Champion.  Big Bubba vs. Hacksaw Jim Duggan was pretty weak.  Chris Benoit vs. the US Champion (who was Japanese) was a great match.  Sting vs. Ric Flair was a good match.  Macho Man vs. Lex Lugar was okay,  though the loser became the NEW WCW World Heavyweight Champion that night.  And finally the MAIN Event (the 60-Man Battle Royal), World War 3, was  AWESOME.  It all came down to Hulk Hogan vs. Macho Man vs. the One Man Gang  vs. the GIANT vs. Sting vs. Lex Lugar vs. Ric Flair.  The winner became the  NEW WCW World Heavyweight Champion.
