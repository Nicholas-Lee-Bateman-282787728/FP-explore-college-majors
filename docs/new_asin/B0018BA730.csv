8269053,4,B0018BA730,I wish they did a 2nd movie.  This ending is kind of boring but it gets you excited to see the final product of handicaps the show they are working to get together and it's a let down when they get the cast and it ends.  I wish there was more.  And for other people that comment on hard to find.  You can find most movies by troma on there website,1458777600,,347,3.8450704225352115

8269056,5,B0018BA730,"This movie was hilarious.  I saw this movie in the theaters in New York City and I couldn't stop laughing.  Isaak James has brilliantly mastered the art of humor in a politically incorrect, satirical way, that ""you've just GOT to laugh"".  A very unique and entertaining movie that will be a great addition to anyone's comedy library.",1220313600,,333,4.807017543859649
