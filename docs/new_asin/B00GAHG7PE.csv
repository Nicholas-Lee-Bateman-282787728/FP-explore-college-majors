6068317,5,B00GAHG7PE,"Murder is rampant, and as mystifyingly delicious making it comparable to Poirot and Foyle's War.  DCI Barnaby (John Nettles) has taken on the fictional Midsomer County murder abundance, some call it massacre, since 1997 and this set offers 17 feature-length murder stories. Multiple killing chaos is the norm in Midsomer. But you'll be booking a flight to London (filming done in rural hamlets just outside London) to have tea with scones in the green of some village, excitedly waiting for the next bludgeoning murder (always solved).

Regulars, like loving wife Joyce (Jane Wymark), great cook, companion, and in charge of lightening the story with homespun gentleness, is offset with another, Barnaby's dialogue/murder solving companion, Troy (Daniel Casey), who adds comedy--YES I said comedy--to each episode with his expressions, statements, and unusual additions to crime scene clues.  He is eventually replaced during this box set's episodes by Sgt. Scott (John Hopkins) without detriment.

Show guest stars make this a fresh dynamic series each time. One of my favorite was Gemma Jones whom I come to love as ""The Duchess of Duke Street"" (highly recommended sets) who was cast in ""Ring Out Your Dead"", a bell tower murder, well actually 5 murders and one additional attempt, high volume even for Midsomer County.  With every episode, predicting Who Dun It? is impossible.  Just try!

Multiple murders in every episode are a trademark, intended from the very beginning, by the writers/producers to make Midsomer Murders unique. That it is!  And no swearing, but plenty of good family murder mystery--the murder almost never seen, just the moments up to the kill, and then of course the body. How many ways can a person be murdered? Midsomer keeps finding new ones. Part of the humor, actually, is the excessive number of murders in a lovely rural/village setting that could count dastardly deaths per sq. ft.  But the delightful setting, sets, scenic environment is enticing, drawing you into enjoyment of yet another murder.  The set is comparable to ""Foyles War: Series 1-5 Dunkirk to VE-Day"" (see my review) with comedy, scenery, and murder spoof replacing the home-front history famous in Foyle's murder mysteries.

""Ghosts of Christmas Past"" (originally aired Christmas Day '04) is no Dickens' story, but murder episode in a Christmas setting, well actually 2 deaths, with a delightful Christmas holiday theme complete with carols. Tiny Tim lived, but that was London, not Midsomer County. Big difference...fa ,la, la, la, la!

A Midsomer Murder is like a travelogue, but better.  You'll want to set yourself down in a town green, at a location like Badger's Wood, and sip tea in quality china, just waiting on a few body parts to drop from the sky. No the writers are much to cleaver for such a simple murder as that. This series was based on books by novelist Caroline Graham (bonus biography included in this set), but have gone beyond those book without loosing the flavor in the continuing filming of this series.  How will it ever end, if it will?  Barnaby discovering his own murder, killed twice?

The Bonus material (two separate discs--nothing, same as the murders, is single in Midsomer) provides much interesting documentary about the show's origin, intentions, stars, locations (this segment is as fantastic as any travel documentary), filmographies of dozens of stars, and the fun compilation of many of the imaginative, unique, murder forms used in the series. No subtitles but that does not KILL the enjoyment.

Get this ""Midsomer Murder: Barnaby's Casebook"" set. Then, like me, you'll want the earlier set, ""Midsomer Murders - The Early Cases Collection.""  Murder mayhem with a bang, jar, poke, slice, stab, pop, sip, choke, etc.",1259020800,17,3759,5.144499178981937
6068318,5,B00GAHG7PE,"An altogether excellent DVD set and well worth owning. Picture quality is fine, as is the audio. The only problem is that it feels like you are going to damage or break the DVDs when removing them from the cases - bad design.",1258848000,5,225,4.255813953488372
6068319,4,B00GAHG7PE,"Imagine Saint Mary Mead. Squared. Then add some extra blood and mayhem.

That about describes the setting of ""Midsomer Murders,"" a morbidly witty British mystery series based on Caroline Graham's novels. And ""Midsomer Murders: Barnaby's Casebook"" brings together the the next round of seventeen cases in this cozy, dark little county, drawing from the fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth seasons of the series. It's a great half'n'half combo of police procedural and cozy mystery.

Snotty society beauty Melissa Townsend is receiving some threatening letters, apparently because of the death of a tenant that stemmed from her neglect. Then she's found stabbed with a syringe filled with animal tranquilizers. Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) starts investigating the murder, especially the possible involvement of Melissa's best friend (and a bit more), a drunk driving case, and secret blackmail. And more murders, of course.

From there on, Barnaby and his assistant, Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey), are forced to investigate all sorts of crimes -- a group of bell-ringers that are being bumped off, a prestigious boarding school with a deadly secret, a farmer's wife's apparent suicide, a vibrant but obnoxious widow's murder, a bizarrely complex murder tied to a mental hospital, a dead body found during an art class, an investor found dead in a river, and an old-as-dirt feud between two halves of a Midsomer town, which may hold the key to a series of deaths on the set of new movie ""The House Of Satan.""

Then Troy receives a promotion, and does one last case with Barnaby: a gentle recluse in the woods is implicated in the murder of his late tormentor. Enter DS Scott (John Hopkins), a rather cocky new guy who arrives just in time for a deadly class reunion, a Celtic solstice ritual that turns deadly, the death of a barman, a pagan ritual involving a dead curate, and a literary festival disrupted by some seedy goings-on... including murder. Then there's the Christmas special, ""Ghosts of Christmas Past"" -- Barnaby's holidays are interrupted by a string of deaths in the Villiers family, nine years after aspiring magician Ferdy Villers killed himself.

Honestly, I think Miss Marple would feel right at home in Midsomer County -- such a pretty, homey, sunshiney place, full of kindly spinsters, farmers and aristocrats of varying stripes, from skanky to down-to-earth. The whole thing is set in the various villages in this county, which is picturesque, lush, and full of farms, cute little English villages, opulent manorhouses, and little brick cottages.

So of course, there are gruesome murders, plotting and tawdry secrets hidden in every corner; several spill out in every episode, and only some of them have to do with the main murder (some are red herrings, and some are side crimes). Every now and then they have a dud episode (such as the horrendously preachy ""Straw Woman""). But the writers keep a funny edge in the stories, such as Barnaby being confronted by an impending vacation (""Joyce, it looks as if these people are sitting on top of an elephant""), or and some clever dialogue (""Well, gettin' blown up's got to be a bit tragic"").

And these cops are pretty believable detectives. John Nettles is absolutely wonderful as the kindly, middle-aged cop with a brain like stainless steel, whose nice sedate family is a relief from all the Midsomer weirdos. And Daniel Casey is solid as his younger, brasher assistant -- and his departure from the show is handled in a believable but touching manner. Hopkins isn't quite as likable as Scott, mainly because Scott is kind of a jerk at first, but he starts fitting in a bit better soon.

Most of the villagers are played by excellent actors as well, no matter how weird their characters are. Slightly loopy historians, crazy old ladies and nasty little schoolboys are only a few, with actors such as Lucy Punch, Hugh Bonneville, Angela Thorne, Amanda Root, and ""Lost's"" Henry Ian Cusick as a slimy rich boy. And Jane Wymark and Laura Howard round off the cast as Barnaby's very understanding wife and daughter.

""Midsomer Murders: Barnaby's Casebook"" is a big, solidly-written chunk of British coziness, with murder and scandal in every episode, and some new transitions for the homicide division.",1254787200,55,4295,5.038028169014084

6068336,5,B00GAHG7PE,"As a long time Midsomer Murders fan, I Had been looking for a good British series. The entireity of the series is exceptionally good and entertaining. New characters are introduced, and it did not take long to welcome them. It made the last if the series a little more exciting. I was given this series from a pal in the UK

John Nettles is Barnaby and Daniel Casey is his DS. He is young with city experience and wonders if country life will suit him. However, he is more than willing to give it a try. Badgers Drift is the scene, and there seem to be more murders than necessary. The mysteries and murders continue. We meet some of the families if all involved.  All of the episodes are well done and entertaining. And the last episode, well..wait and see.

6068339,5,B00GAHG7PE,"Midsomer Murders has been a TV hit for over 20 years now.  One of my favorites since the first time I watched it on TV.  Some of the older DVDs are at the public library--but couldn't find the ones in this seasons shows.  Really enjoyed this set--took me back to the younger Inspector, his daughter and wife, Joyce.  Loved the little quaint villages that the murders take place in and learn so much about the history of the villages and customs and traditions of English village life.  A modern Agatha Christie feel about these.  This was Queen Elizabeth's favorite TV show and her favorite actor, John Nettles, stars.  She was disappointed when he announced he was retiring.  The show is still on with a new cast, and still very good, but not the same without the original actors.  These were shown on the A & E and Biography channels when they first came out.  The newer MIdsomer Murders is on PBS now.  17 mysteries on 17 DVDs and two bonus discs, approximately 28 hrs. Plus two bonus DVDs including interviews and a documentary about the show's first decade.  Previously released on DVD as Sets 4, 6, 7, & 8.  Acorn Media.  This was purchased as used, but found it to be in very good condition.  A little wear on the outside case but the DVDS were like new.",1487894400,5,1261,4.469298245614035

There are still so many episodes I haven't seen so I began to order them online.  I am thrilled that I did.  This box of episodes includes the transition from DS Gavin Troy (The Green Man) when he is promoted, to DS Dan Scott (Bad Tidings) making his debut.  All the murders are plotted out well and are never boring. This set includes Series 5 (three discs), 6 (three discs), and 7 (4 discs).  Each series is in it's own case, and the three cases are in an attractive box.  Series 6 includes production notes and a Midsomer map, and Series 7 includes an interview with John Nettles and the Midsomer map. Lots of quality entertainment.",1487462400,5,771,4.503597122302159

It is nice to know that  Barnaby has a family that he GOES home to at the end of the day, and that family is important enough to the story line to be included in the actual movie as a an integral part.  There are enough clues to keep the viewer busy watching.  If you step away to use the loo without pausing the film, you will miss something essential to the upcoming events!

Than I saw on Amazon that it was ""Midsomer"" and looked into the programs.  After reading reviews decided to try them and purchased the first series of several episodes.  I have since purchased the second series and we are enjoying them very much.  There is always some light humor in each episode, we have yet to figure out who the murdered is before the ending and we like that there is positive family life for the chief detective and he and his side-kick get along well.  When we want a mystery with less tension than most we watch one of these.  Another plus, the subtitles.  I am planning on purchasing the next series.",1410307200,,798,4.462068965517242

6068437,5,B00GAHG7PE,"""I've spent a lifetime trying to fathom the complexities of jungle ecosystems, but they are as nothing compared to the bizarre mechanizations of this village,"" a beleaguered Midsomer denizen declares in ""Tainted Fruit,"" by David Hoskins.

The music is inimitable, another character in this humorous danse macabre. ""The Straw Woman"" is a wonderful Halloween episode, adding yet another level of complexity and delightful darkness to the series. Sharp dialogue and humor make this collection a real treat. Don't assume this is lace doily stuff, no indeed! The Brits have knack for mixing classic stories with ghoulish humor and sharp observations of the flawed human character. Historically, penny-dreadfuls were published at Christmastime, as in Robert Louis Stevenson and Charles Dickens. Note that in the Christmas Special, campy horror flicks are being broadcast on Detective Scott's television, all part of the tradition. This is a delicious series, far more complex than I expected, a virtual escape to the dangerous environs of Midsomer county. Laura Howard is pitch-perfect as Barnaby's daughter Cully, and Jane Wymark is superb as his long-suffering wife.

Don't miss the wonderful DVD Extras: ""Super Sleuths"" documenting the show's first decade, and the visual treat of seeing the real villages where the series filmed in the delightful (catch Nettles' elfin skip at the end, and the comment that behind every successful man is a surprised woman"" on the special disk MAP OF MIDSOMER MURDERS. I made the mistake the first go-around thinking this was just another rendition of the Midsomer Maps under the usual specials menu of the episodes, but it's a virtual trip to the U.K., not to be missed!

The only drawback is that Detective Scott's (John Hopkins) role is fairly thankless, short on dialogue; no wonder Hopkins left. The writers later remedy this with the advent of his plucky successor, Jason Hughes as Detective Sergeant Ben Jones, who develops a wry and great relationship with Barnaby. John Nettles is perfection (as is the rest of the cast), depicting an irascible and deeply particular personality, aging with character, like a fine Ardbeg whisky. Note the badger emblem on the police cars. Enjoy!",1320883200,5,2218,5.259887005649717
6068438,5,B00GAHG7PE,"I miss great TV in the US. We used to have Columbo, Matlock and Murder She Wrote. Then TV stopped making great ""who done it's"" with some humor and interest. I have DVD sets 1-12 and it is such a joy to watch John Nettles with Daniel Casey. What a team! His second investigator thankfully didn't last more than one season- he was painful to watch. Ben Jones was a good choice for replacement. Can't wait for them to box the remaining John Nettles in his final years and purchase those.

When we watch episodes, we watch together which provides family bonding time for us.

I actually bought this set and was disappointed when I discovered I had the same titles in my individual volume sets.

When it comes to murder mysteries, no one does it as well as the Brits - and Midsome Murders is definitely at the acme in our books.  We highly recommend this series to anyone who likes well plotted mysteries.  We had fun saying ""Nope, those houses look lovely, but it is obviously dangerous to live in one of them.

6068452,5,B00GAHG7PE,"I, like many Americans, first started watching ""Midsomer Murders"" when it appeared on the A&E network.  The more I viewed of the series, the more I enjoyed the murder, mayhem, and subtle humor of this British import.  ""Barnaby's Casebook"" is recommended IF you haven't seen many of the episodes from 2001-2006. If you viewed the show regularly during the A&E run, I recommend you visit the website (...) and read summaries of each episode in this box set.  You might decide you are a little too familiar with many of the titles to spend the (...) plus for this package.

However, many of the episodes are a joy to revisit.  Great British character actors (and what ""characters"" they are!), good writing, and a solid John Nettles as the lead make each hour and forty minute program a entertaining way to pass time.

If you like ""Masterpiece Theatre"", ""Frost"", and other British imports I think you will love the 17 ""Midsomer Murders"" presented in ""Barnaby's Casebook"".",1268524800,,967,4.83030303030303

I have all 13 sets of the series and am waitng for 14 and 15.  As a Yank across the ocean I first saw this series on A&E years ago and never dreamed of owning any sets.  I love the cast and characters they portray.  The best part about the series is the characters come as they are; bad hair, bad teeth, bad cloths etc, no makeup, shoot outs, wild car chases, or mayhem.  So classy and oh so British and I especially thank you for the respect that characters show in the series. I am dazzled by the English countryside and the old estates.  Market for Murder was more up to date in its story especially the reading/investment club but wow, who would have thought it would lead to so many murders. And how about the sexy pool guy who was more than a pool guy. It is always exciting to see how all the characters will interact and what secrets they are hiding. Every actor and part they played fit together so well and I didn't want the story to end.  My husband and I have watched all 13 sets at least 5 times and have converted a good friend into a fanatical fan of DCI Barnaby.
