4162415,5,B003OIQYKK,"Camps, also known as the GULAG, the Russian front in World War II, the NKVD, If these terms mean little to the viewer then confusion will result.  The NAZI hatred for undesirables and the NAZI war quest for ""living space"" may also be unknown to a viewer.

A film like this touches many tender nerves.  Complainers of all kinds can have a good time.  But for me the many, many, odd scenes are not so strange.  War is full of strange  horrible things.

To me, the structure of the film tries to show many things but things people don't want to see.  It's almost insane.  War certainly is.

Not much humor here, It's a movie of bitter inhuman history.

The German panzer tanks and other motor equipment such as trucks and sidecar motorcycles may have phony vehicles made for movies.  Or they might be from the cokkection of original WWII armored vehicles of Mosfilm studios.  Last I knew the collection had about 225 armored vehicles of German and Russian make plus weapons and everthing such as uniforms/",1322265600,,1002,4.593220338983051
4162416,3,B003OIQYKK,"`Burnt by the Sun 2 - Exodus' is Nikita Mikhalkov's follow up to his Oscar winning `Burnt by the Sun'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burnt-by-the-Sun/dp/B00009MEKP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burnt by the Sun</a>. He produces, writes and stars in this as he did in the first part. You do not need to have seen the first part to get this, but it will help to contextualise. Mikhalkov plays Col/general Sergei Kotov, he has been caught up in one of Stalin's' many purges and we find him here being held as an article 58 political prisoner, it is 1941 and so five years on from when he last saw his daughter. This is played by ..... yes his real daughter, who did so in the earlier film too - Nadezhda Mikhalkov (she should now be thirteen but is in fact twenty three). He is about to be transferred to a criminal status of article 129, when as luck would have it the Germans attack in CGI planes and destroy the entire camp except for Kotov and his intellectually challenged son.

The story flits between his story and that of his daughter, who is now a `pioneer' who refuses to denounce her father and is approached by Stalin's henchman and former friend Arsentyev (Oleg Menshikov - in both films) and told her father is still alive. She meanwhile is evacuated from the camp as the Germans advance. In the confusion she gets herself into a number of tight spots which would be plot spoilers if I told you, but you do start to think that even as a cat her nine lives must be quite near to being up at one point. She is now trying to be reunited with her father and he keeps wanting to get back to her, so the scene is sort of set.

Meanwhile father and son have teamed up with a penal battalion (not actually formed until 1942) and take on the full might of the Germans in a very excellent battle sequence with no CGI and real actors, tanks etc.

There is an attempt to be balanced, except where Stalin is concerned, we have soldiers converting to Christianity and Islam, there are some reasonably un cardboard cut out Germans, but it does not hang together well in places. I was reminded of `Come and see'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Come-and-See/dp/B0000BWVCR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Come and See</a>at one point where we have a barn burning incident, but without the raw emotion evinced in that earlier film.

This was panned in Russia and bombed at the box office, despite this being one of the biggest production budgets ever for a film (think Pearl Harbor). It has been criticised for the historical inaccuracies, the painfully obvious plot holes and the lack of any form of subtlety (much in evidence in the slow but brooding `Burnt by the Sun').It has also been criticised for having a version of the war too close to the 'official' version.

It is sprawling, it is not really epic and I am a bit concerned that nowhere on the packaging in the Uk are we told about the first part, it is just called 'Exodus', at least in the US there is a nod towards authenticity. This may be an attempt to distance it from the previous work or sell it in the UK as a war film. It does have battle scenes, there is a lot of gore and some of it is well done, but you do have to suspend belief a bit, there is a woeful scene involving the Luftwaffe taking a frat type 'dump' on a red cross boat. If you can manage the suspension then there is a good 146 minute film. That said I quite enjoyed it, the ending is awkward and we are told `End of Part One'. Well it should be part two and judging by how this was received in Russia and America, I thought part 3 would not be made, but it is already out in the US and is called 'The Citadel'. Nearly four stars but probably three and a half, but for the sake of rating this is just OK.",1315872000,10,3805,4.548905109489051
4162417,2,B003OIQYKK,"I had high hopes for this movie. Famous and talented director, huge budget: everything was telling that we are finally going to get great modern movie about World War 2 in Russia. Yes movie is expensive, but it consists from some strange and long scenes.

One scene shows German pilot defecating on Russian ship, because he bet with his friends he can hit it. In another German soldier kills gypsies because he bothered by their music. Russian soldier mistakes German tank for a Russian tank and recognizes his mistake only after German tank crew presents him with Hitler's book. A girl swims on a mine for 15 minutes...

And in last scene Russian nurse shows her tits to a dying Russian soldier because it's his last wish. It suppose to be very touching scene but I cannot help to think about porn sequel. Wounded soldiers may have more sophisticated dreams you know...

Great disappointment",1305849600,7,892,4.779220779220779
4162418,1,B003OIQYKK,"One of the worst movies I have seen in a while. Attempting to make an 'epic' film about the Great Patriotic War (Russian for World War II), Mihalkov produces a disfigured creation without a logical storyline, full of historical inconsistencies and grotesque violence which is an insult to the Russian veterans of WWII. With the budget of $50 mil. it was a complete commercial flop and despite heavy Russian government support, as well as extensive promotional campaign, it only collected $7 mil in the theaters.

I have enjoyed Mihalkov's ""Burnt by the Sun"" and ""12"", but for the lack of better terms this film is trash.",1300579200,8,620,4.849056603773585
4162419,5,B003OIQYKK,"Mikhalkov does it again. Haunted by a century of Russian history, his approach is as striking as it is provocative. Wonderfully directed and acted with a particular stress on Oleg Menshikov's part, the film enjoys Mikhalkov's genuine creativity.

A Burnt By The Sun #3 is apparently in the making, announcing the continuation of a strong reconsideration of still heavily veiled history that is looking for its reconsideration in its eternal quest for the truth.
I rate this a 5 stars because it is definitely a must see in spite of the inherent unevenness due largely to the avidity of the author to confess all at once. A very warm human light is cast upon this complex and vibriting fresco of a daunting time in our lives.",1292889600,5,1057,5.412121212121212

8401650,5,B003OIQYKK,"Burnt by the Sun is one of the greatest movies ever made. It neither embellishes, nor over dramatizes the historical events and gives a very moving depiction of the early 20th century changes in Russia. Life is not black and white, nor is the movie. The characters are complex and beautifully built. It has a certain melancholy to it - the beautiful summer by the lake, when outside the world is falling to pieces. Some scenes are hard to watch, not because they are brutal, but because they are real. The movie reminds one that you can not close your eyes to history, and it is better to know the truth, no matter how painful. The problem is we never learn and keep making the same mistakes.",1409356800,,692,4.456692913385827
8401651,3,B003OIQYKK,"[The following review contains spoilers of the original Burnt by the Sun.]

Burnt by the Sun 2: Exodus is the first sequel to director Nikita Mikhalkovs Oscar-winning Burnt by the Sun made in 1994. (The second sequel Citadel is already made.) I don't know what made Mikhalkov turn his critically acclaimed original into a trilogy, with the two main characters that I thought were dead.

But they are not, and the film revolves around three characters: Kotov (Nikita Mikhalkov), who is really alive, and escapes from a Gulag when WW2 begins. His daughter Nadia, now grown-up, who believes that his father is not dead; Mitya (Oleg Menshikov), tired and disillusioned (but not dead, despite what we saw in the original), is ordered by Stalin to investigate the activities of Kotov. Unfortunately, the long film has little to add about the characters we really cared in the original.

Unlike the original Burnt by the Sun, the first sequel attempts to be a war epic. Reportedly the most costly movie in the history of Russian cinema, Burnt by the Sun 2: Exodus has a few combat scenes that, I think, are meant to show how ridiculous a war could be, with a German fighter pilot defecating on a Russian ship (and its bloody consequences).

Well, while the film is obviously inspired by one Steven Spielberg war film, Burnt by the Sun 2 is far more self-conscious, to the point of defeating its purpose  whatever the purpose may be. But somehow I didn't hate Mikhalkovs sprawling and bombastic war movie simply because it was not boring. But of course, that doesnt mean the film is good.",1399420800,2,1580,4.772893772893773
8401652,5,B003OIQYKK,Enjoyed it thoroughly. Very moving story and a different perspective on Russia and its history. I received this package very quickly. Buy with confidence.,1365638400,,154,5.458333333333333
8401653,5,B003OIQYKK,"The subtitles will not interere with the powerful story.  One quickly falls in love with both Col. Kotov and his precocious young daughter.  While I didn't see trouble coming when his wife's old lover arriived,  Kotov did and handled it masterfully.  From my study of Russia in the '30's, the farm scenes seem accurate and informative.  I hated the ending, but it was the most common solution--especially for heroes--during the Stalin purges  I couldn't wait until I could order Burnt by the Sun 2, and conclude the story.  I hung on to every scene in both and have played them several more times and will again--this story just will not leave your memory or your heart....",1354665600,4,673,4.75
8401654,5,B003OIQYKK,"A beautifully produced and Directed film. One of the most affecting movies my wife and I have seen in a long time. It shows, without you being aware, how unjust, sad and ultimately brutal Stalin's reign of terror really was. It is set in the summer of one loyal, patriotic family whose patriarch is a hero. A general from WW I. It is warm, funny but the pathos at the end makes one wonder how Russia survived. Don't miss it.
