8742774,5,B018RF03PQ,"Funny, funny, funny. I enjoyed this movie because it was full of comedy, good music, color, and it showed a man from another culture, another class, operating from his heart. Take it one step further, Akshay. Show Singh falling in love with a black woman from a humble life. Also, let the world know that not all Siks are white.",1455580800,3,328,4.483333333333333

8742776,4,B018RF03PQ,"So, I haven't watched the original movie all the way through but I'd say so far these are comparable films. They might have had a little less money for Bling but that could also have a lot to do with a move to digital film, which can have a way of making your movie look cheaper when it isn't. The film itself is pretty fun too. Broad 3 stooges humor, song and dance, and kung fu shenanigans are the main ingredients here. The extra something is Amy Jackson's shorts, bikinis, tank tops, etc. She comes off well for most likely not speaking the same language as Mr Kumar. She does a good job playing off of him. She jumps between over the top sassy or straight man with a good deal of ease. It's a hard act to do without being a total mentalist on screen and sometimes she has to do it within scenes while still appearing to be sweet. It helps that Kumar is on point as usual but I've seen plenty of Akshay Kumar films and plenty of actresses don't catch on the way Jackson does or can make up for their failings with a pair of cut offs.

It's worth picking up if you want essentially comfort food.",1452038400,,1098,4.179245283018868
8742777,1,B018RF03PQ,"I really enjoyed 2008's Singh is Kinng for what it was, a silly over-the-top Bollywood musical.  Fun songs, impressive locations, funny slapstick, it had everything I wanted, so I didn't hesitate to pick up Akshay Kumar's Singh is Bling thinking it would be more of the same.

It ain't.

First off, despite the name, it's unrelated to Singh is Kinng save that Kumar once again plays a Sikh character named Singh.

Raaftar Singh is a talented but lazy villager.  In order to avoid marriage he gets a job in a casino in Goa and promptly falls in love with a visiting mafia princess.  He doesn't speak English, she doesn't speak Hindi and hilarity ensues.  Yeah there's slapstick, there's dances, there's chases and it all ends with a big brawl in a European castle.

But somehow it all feels flat.  The slapstick isn't funny, the songs didn't grab me, and the plot is too contrived to take seriously but not contrived enough to make me laugh.  I like Bollywood films but this one did nothing for me.",1451520000,2,997,4.613636363636363
