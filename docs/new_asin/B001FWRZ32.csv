3589370,5,B001FWRZ32,"For those of us who haven't been able to see Sara Bareilles live, this is as good as it gets, and we are SO lucky to have this CD/DVD combo! If you already have ""Little Voice"" (in single or 2-CD form) you won't be disappointed as this is all new material!

Here you get BOTH the video (DVD) and audio (CD) of Sara's intimate July 12, 2008 concert at The Fillmore in San Francisco. On the high-quality CD/DVD she sings songs from her megahit CD ""Little Voice"" -- it's clear how much better she is live. Her voice has a lot of soul and passion, especially in her amazing cover of ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" and the opening number ""Bottle It Up."" The concert also has the following songs: Vegas, Morningside, Love on the Rocks, Between the Lines, Fairytale, August Moon, City, Love Song, Many the Miles, and Gravity.

The 2-hour DVD is beautifully produced and a treasure for Sara B fans. Watching Sara up close perform on the piano and sing is amazing. The concert is taped professionally and in between songs we get intimate moments of Sara and her band, backstage footage, and private acoustic performances of Sara playing/singing with friends on the Northern California coast. If you want to get technical, the concert DVD is presented in 5.1 surround sound (boy are we lucky!).

Also on the DVD are three music videos: Fairytale, Love Song and Bottle It Up.

By the way, if you like Sara B, check out Brooke Fraser's CD ""Albertine"" on Amazon! (Another amazing singer-songwriter who's better live just like Sara B!)

**Please note: There is also a DVD-only version of Sara's intimate July 12, 2008 concert at The Fillmore in San Francisco. Don't settle for just the video, when you can get the video PLUS the BONUS audio CD of the full-length concert! It's such a treat to own both so that you can listen to the concert in your car or on your mp3 player or iPod. The CD/DVD combo is available on Amazon and costs the SAME (at least the regular price is).",1225238400,15,1963,4.51830985915493

3589375,4,B001FWRZ32,"wonderful work. My hands down favorite on the disk however were the recordings of Sara on the houseboat. Only reason I thought I ought give this four instead of five was it didn't ring my heart as much as the Atlanta recording. That said, if you're a Sara fan, you will want this. And take the time to open up the houseboat videos.",1461456000,,331,4.26984126984127

3589377,5,B001FWRZ32,"Well-recorded beautiful music from a beautiful woman - this is one of the best concert DVDs I have experienced. Usually I am a stickler for Bu-Rays, but this DVD looks just fine. The audio and video recording and mastering are top-notch. The Fillmore is an attractive venue, with an intimate crowd in fairly close quarters, adding to the recording's realism and presence. Sara's personable small talk between songs brings the concert especially close to home.

And now more on Sara. Her vocal range and consistency is at times awe-inspiring, and the fact that she expresses it while playing piano makes it even more impressive. Most of the songs here sound as good or better on this recording as on the ""Little Voice"" studio album. Sara is clearly in her element here. As I have seen written elsewhere, she just makes it look so easy; and she appears to be having fun, which makes it more fun for the viewer. It is worth noting that her band is very good, too.

I have not seen Sara perform live, but I want to, and I have to imagine this is the next best thing.

I could not recommend this more highly. If you are a fan of Sara Bareilles, or of similar music, purchase this DVD/CD set immediately.",1454630400,2,1198,4.537037037037037

3589379,5,B001FWRZ32,"As an absolute music aficionado and a true fan of Saras music, Im gonna go ahead and say this is Saras best record to date. Take my word for it. If you're interested to know why I make such an assertion, please read on.

Sara has pushed out great music throughout the years, during which she has grown and tweaked and perfected her style (especially lyrics-wise). But <Little Voice>, her very first major label release, surprisingly remains the truest, rawest, smoothest and most engaging work to me, and <Live at the Fillmore> has implemented the music from <Little Voice> and taken it to an OTHERWORLDLY level. What really shines on <Little Voice> are the sparkly melodies fused with jazz and blues hints, the rock-y feels and textures, and the crisp yet powerful piano chords. <Live at the Fillmore> enhances and sublimes the entire music experience just bybeing live. Live productions and arrangements are naturally simpler and rock-ier than studio recordings, and that fits exactly right with this collection of music. One drum, one bass, one to two guitars, zero to one background keyboard and one piano, and thats it on <Live at the Fillmore>. Of course, plus Saras transcendental voice. Simply put, this live recordings liveliness, energy, power and beauty is just off the damn charts. The raw jazziness and blues-ness are yet to be found on her later works, which sparkles and buzzes electric on this live recording. This album will change your days and nights, and fill them with spectacular musical enjoyment.

And last but not least, please get the blu-ray. Watching this live recording is even more engaging than merely listening to it, and you deserve to enjoy it in full HD clarity and fully lossless audio.",1453852800,,1722,4.93448275862069
3589380,5,B001FWRZ32,"This live recording is simply perfect and plainly packed with raw liveliness. Live production (as opposed to studio production) is the best fit for Sara's piano-rock-Jazz-blues music style, and that's why her music sounds better live than studio-recorded. The band is professional and flawlessly choreographed. Every single song sounded perfectly energetic, sophisticated, emotional and beautiful with the simplest live production set (drum, guitar, bass, piano and keyboard), and better than their studio counterparts. As a all-time hardcore music fanatic, it has been some time since I'd fallen so hard for good music, and I'm enjoying every bit of it. Sara Bareilles is just an unbelievably talented and well-balanced artist, and this live album is a truly timeless piece of musical feat.",1451347200,3,791,5.545454545454546

3589383,5,B001FWRZ32,"I am a NEW fan of Sara Bareilles. I've only recently heard her music and I feel like I just crawled out from under a rock because of it. There are MANY GREAT Female singer's that I have the highest regards for, but I honestly think Sara is at the APEX of any of them. Everyone has they're own favorites and tastes of type's of singer's, I get it, BUT NO ONE and I mean NO ONE has a better voice than this beautiful song bird of a singer. I don't care WHO you come up with, at BEST they may could equal her singing talent, BUT NEVER exceed it and I honestly can't think of ANYONE I've EVER HEARD better!  I think personally she could upgrade Anyone's hit's but few could ever match her with one of HER HIT'S and I found her to have many. Sara Bareilles is MY new FAVORITE SINGER of ALL TIME!!!  I personally don't think anyone else is even in her ball park and Between the Lines will give you an excellent opportunity to both see her performance in a live concert and how she captivates her audience with her incredible talent and heart warming personality. If you don't fall in love with Sara after seeing and hearing her perform, that you must have a heart of stone. Plus included is a CD of the DVD performance you'll witness that you'll want to play over and over as I do. I feel like I FINALLY found the MOST impressive female singer of all time.

I had the privilege to go to her last concert (in 2014) here in Florida and I was amazed by her voice and talent besides her beauty and sense of humor. This dvd concert is really good and worth buying it. I don't understand why she is not more popular, there is a lot of non talent singers not even composers and everybody knows them, anyway just order this concert and do it in blu ray format, you won't regret !!!",1408406400,,488,4.147368421052631

3589400,5,B001FWRZ32,"I am a relatively new listener to Sara Bareilles and this DVD was not a disappointment.  The music, of course, was great and entertaining, but the insight into her personality and relationship with her band added the touch of humanity that is much needed in societies view of celebrities.",1395878400,,288,4.877551020408164

3589402,5,B001FWRZ32,"What more can I say?  I am always impressed when an artist sounds better on stage than in the studio.  This lady's talent is not the result of a lot of studio tricks.  She has a fantastic voice that is even more powerful when she is energized by a large, grateful crowd. And the great mind that came up with all those wonderful lyrics is evident in her quips she makes between songs.  And you can tell that she is really grateful for the fame she has achieved, and while she is wowing the crowd with her talent, she is constantly thanking them for her support.
Another nice thing is that you also get a CD of the concert.  It has quickly become my favorite Sara CD.",1391644800,,665,4.2047244094488185

3589408,5,B001FWRZ32,"I was very pleased with this concert video. The sound and picture were excellent for a live performance. I almost didn't buy this after reading some reviews saying that the video cut away to off stage/ behind the scenes shots. Actually, it did cut away, but to her performing the same song on a dock somewhere. The music flowed seamlessly, so don't know what the petty griping was about. The lady can sing, and sing exceptionally well, as well as play the piano. I like a wide variety of music, Classical to Heavy Metal, but wasn't sure if I'd like Sara, not a big fan of Pop type music. I liked her single's Love Song, and Gravity, so thought it'd be worth a listen. I honestly have to say, after Yes's Symphonic Live, this is my 2nd favorite concert video. If you're a fan of live music, you'll appreciate this one, a truely flawless performance.",1363219200,,848,4.47741935483871
3589409,4,B001FWRZ32,"Sarah Bareilles breaks new ground at the Fillmore. Her instrumental(piano) and vocal combinations provide a subtle ambiance for a soothing experience. At times, her direction in lyrics doesnt quite reach her capability as an artist, but in a few songs she does demonstrate a descent vocal range. In other songs, mass message marketing is overbearing and takes away from the piano vocal combination. Overall, I think she could produce a great albulm.",1359936000,,449,5.25
3589410,5,B001FWRZ32,I bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it. I also like the fact that it arrived in about a week.,1359331200,,123,3.5925925925925926
3589411,5,B001FWRZ32,"I didn't really get into Sara's first album, because Love Song sounded a little too Pop for my tastes, not that I don't like a lot of Pop. But, then one day, a friend showed me a video on YouTube of just her and her guitar player singing a version of Otis Reddings ""Sittin on the dock of the Bay"" and I was hooked. I started looking up all her stuff on YouTube and loved her on The Sing Off. So, I had to buy this cd. I was very happy to see there was a dvd/cd version and have watched the dvd many times over. I really recommend this dvd/cd!",1358467200,,542,3.891891891891892
3589412,3,B001FWRZ32,"Good quality and sound.  Music is good, but I didn't appreciate the F words, S words.  I know she wants to try and be cool but I guess she, like Adele could care less about it being a family DVD.  The DVD should indicate such.  I also wanted just the music.  I should have read that much of the Live at Filmore is about her life and not just music.  I have parties which I just want music for my guests, who can sit down and watch a couple of songs if they like.  This is not that type of DVD.  Lots of discussion in between...

For those who are interested in her ""The Person"" then this is a nice DVD.",1357603200,2,602,3.909090909090909
3589413,5,B001FWRZ32,"When I received the Sara Bareilles CD from Amazon, I couldn't wait to listen to her incredible voice.  Noticed the bonus DVD so watched it instead.  I felt like I was at the Fillmore.  I love it!",1347580800,,195,4.216216216216216

Great Job, Sara!",1332720000,,217,3.6739130434782608
3589415,4,B001FWRZ32,I bought this blu-ray as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. I was never really a fan of Sara Bareilles but after watching this with my g.f. I came to really appreciate some of her music. Overall this is a great sounding/looking HD blu-ray disc if not the absolute best.,1329523200,,277,4.245283018867925
3589416,5,B001FWRZ32,"When you first listen to Sara Bareilles at the surface you may come away with a pop-rock impression if you hear only certain songs and only hear her studio cuts. Don't let that fool you.  You see the real Sara when you see her live.  If you take the time to delve a little deeper you will find lyrical and musical depth that far supercedes her tender age and ""Pop"" status.  Tender is actually a great adjective for Sara, but also Soulful, illuminating, hilarious, charismatic, down to earth, happily plebian, glamourous, beautiful human being that will have you enamored if you are not careful. (Obviously, I was not...)  She is hints of Joss Stone, with spatterings of Janice Joplin, Etta James, Pink, Tori Amos, Joni Mitchel, Bessie Smith, Christina Aguilara, Norah Jones, and Elton John, but not like any of them.  She is completely unique and refreshing with lyrical content in spades. Sara's lyrics are incredibly relatable, and so transendent.  Experiencing her often chopped and twisting jazzy timings, harmonic note bending, soulfull, live performance is a bonafide spiritual experience.

Sara is currently touring Europe right this moment promoting her incredible 3rd album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaleidoscope-Heart/dp/B003NE65GI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaleidoscope Heart</a>&nbsp;which includes the her new hit single ""King of Anything"" and is available on this very site for the low low price of $7.99. Catch the ride before she blows up and goes uber mega big.  I sure hope that she will be able to keep her down to earth, pixieish, small town sensibilities in the big City.  She is living proof that a small town girl can strike out and make it big through relentless persistent hard work and constant striving and honing of her craft.  She may have been born with a talent but so are alot of us who never did or will do anything close to this magnitude.  It's her work ethic that set her apart. Meet her now. She's truely inspirational.  You can get a good start on that with this Concert. When you get to know her you will see that Sara in no way appears to be in it to get rich and forget her self, where she came from or what got her their.  She paid her dues in order to follow her dreams by living and sharing her art. She's amazing, especially live, and if you wait too long to discover that, when you inevitably really do want to see one of her live shows you'll be lucky to get a nose-bleed bleacher seat for $250 in an stadium show. If you act now, you may still have an opportunity to catch in her in a much more intimate venue.

The Fillmore Concert DVD is your chance right now to see her live for a full set.  It's incredible.  It's elite. Sara and her talented band really shine here. It's obvious it is her joy share her love and experiences through her amazing, complex, meticulous, jazzy, soulful music. You will have a good time too. She's infectious.  She and her fans bring a sense of community and warmth that is palapable and touching even on DVD. The closest thing I have seen to a Sara Bareilles crowd is perhaps U2 in regards to incredible acts and their fanatical, mesmerized, participative audiences making each show a truely shared and unique event. The audiences make the show and Sara is able to generate that and throw in a big heaping of personal openness, tenderness, and love.  In this performance you can actually feel the mutual love through the speakers and on the screen.  And as always when she comes out on the stage she truely puts herself out their and shares her heart and soul for all to experience in all it's facets without fear or shame or emberrassment, loves it, and it shows.

For the record I am a 39 year old hetero man who is a 17 year civil servant who was teethed on U2, The Police (eh kinda poppish, yeah but I was 8 when I got started on them), The Clash, The Sex Pistols, Pixies, The Cure, Metallica, , Van Halen, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin. I'm just trying to say, I'm not a wordy 15 year old girl, and I'm not a member of her paid PR team.  Sara is a bit of a departure for me in mood, tempo, pop culture status, and audience constituency, but I am so very happy I took her detour.  If you can truely appreciate music then this show and this girl are a must see.  You will not regret the time you spend getting to really know her and her music.  You can only do that by seeing her live.  You have that opportunity for the best deal you will probably ever find right here and right now.  This DVD packs all of that.  And they throw in a CD too?  How can you beat that?  Personally I bought the Blue Ray edition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Between-The-Lines-Sara-Bareilles-Live-At-The-Filmore-Blu-ray/dp/B001G788S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Between The Lines: Sara Bareilles Live At The Filmore [Blu-ray</a>] for a little over $22 bones.  I get to experience her in 1080P with Dolby TrueHD 5.1.

I couldn't recommend this DVD and exploring Sara's music any higher.",1296777600,8,5045,4.777649769585254
3589417,5,B001FWRZ32,"Sara Bareilles is the real deal.  I've seen her live multiple times and this live DVD proves why so many love her.  When you listen to Sara on this live DVD, you will find that she sounds exactly the same as her studio albums (Little Voice, Kaleidoscope Heart), if not better, which is rare for artists these days.  She sounds absolutely flawless and puts 110% into every song.  The emotions are clear on her face and there are even people in the audience brought to tears by her performances.  It's refreshing to hear a GREAT voice from someone who can actually sing rather than the auto-tuned nonsense that is popular today. A bonus - Sara has a bubbly personality and she is absolutely hilarious.  She is not afraid to be herself and talks to the crowd like you've known her for years.  I was left in awe and speechless after watching this DVD.

A MUST LISTEN/WATCH for all Sara fans and people who appreciate GREAT MUSIC!  This is one of the best live DVDs I've ever seen.  If you don't buy this, you will be missing out on a incredible opportunity to witness one of the best female vocalists of the generation.",1296259200,2,1115,4.475247524752476
3589418,5,B001FWRZ32,I am loving this concert dvd from my favorite artist Sara Bareilles. I've seen her live before but not as a headliner. This is a great concert experience to watch.,1288656000,,163,4.466666666666667
3589419,5,B001FWRZ32,"If you have an HD TV and a nice sound system, picking up the blu ray is well worth it. I own the standard copy and thought I would pick up the blu ray to see if I could notice any difference. First, I have a blu ray player which upconverts so the picture on the non blu ray version looked plenty good. But there is a very noticeable difference when playing the blue ray. It is so crystal clear. A concert is the perfect situation to get a blu ray as I don't always need movies to be this clear as I like a little production value. This is so well shot you won't regret getting the blu ray from a visual perspective.

Second is the sound. This blu ray comes with the choice of PCM and True HD when selecting the audio set up. I believe my receiver plays True HD as it has all the latest bells and whistles. I am not an audiophile but the sound is noticeably different with the blu ray. It is even more clear and crisp. You can hear every detail of all instruments playing simultaneously. And Sara's amazing voice is so crystal clear coming through the center channel speaker. The base seems a little more powerful on this HD version as well. Any Sara fan will be in true heaven listening to this blu ray version of the Filmore live concert.",1277164800,3,1239,4.1625
3589420,5,B001FWRZ32,"I find this DVD/CD presentation to be one of the best I own (I own many...).  Sara is extremely talented and has an incredible voice.  The production of this concert DVD took everything into account, including its audio and visual quality, its presentation and compilation as well as capturing Sara's amazing vocal talent.  It's extremely creative, fun and emotional.
The inclusion of the 'houseboat' performances is really a kick, as is the integration of these 'houseboat' performances into the concert footage.  The videos are really fun and creative.  Being able to listen to the concert in my car is really cool, thanks to the included CD.
I was, am and continue to be blown away by this particular concert DVD.  Nice job!!",1264550400,2,728,4.926229508196721
3589421,3,B001FWRZ32,"I thoroughly enjoyed the film style of the concerts, and audio and video quality of the Blu-Ray version. Rather than reiterate what many others have described so well, I only want to make one unfortunate comment that Sara drops an ""F"" bomb while speaking to the audience. Considering I watched this with little kids, I felt this was very inappropriate, and unnecessary to have not edited it out of the final production.",1261872000,4,419,4.833333333333333
3589422,5,B001FWRZ32,"Sara Bareilles has one of the best voices, if not the best voice live. I did not see her when she toured and after watching this DVD, I am sorry I did not.  Sara's interaction with the audience is also very entertaining.  A great performance, and a great performer! The CD that comes with the BD is a great bonus. BUY THIS DVD!",1257897600,,327,4.174603174603175
3589423,5,B001FWRZ32,"Sara shows her sassy side in this live CD/DVD -- her music is an easy listen, with a ton of lyrics which I can relate to.  Loved her cover of Sitting on The Dock Of The Bay.",1257638400,,173,3.675675675675676
3589424,5,B001FWRZ32,"Fantastic concert. Only negatives are some songs are interrupted by behind the scenes footage. Would've rather have had the actual concert only. The songs that are cut some are on the bonus sections of disc however.

The blu-ray image and audio are first rate. A must have for SB fans.",1255910400,,285,4.7
3589425,5,B001FWRZ32,"Sara Bareilles presents a refreshing new harmonious songs and lyrics, a pleasure to my ears and defiant to my brain.
My hope is that she would mature to continue and generate more extraordinary songs and lyrics in the years to come.",1255392000,,232,4.682926829268292
3589426,5,B001FWRZ32,"If you like Sara Bareilles you'll absolutely love this blu-ray. She so amazing to see live because shes so sweet and genuine and loves what she does and it shows. This is a great quality movie I watch fairly often and it looks incredible in HD. Get this movie, and get to one of her shows, especially if its one of these general admission shows.",1240444800,,345,4.323076923076923
3589427,5,B001FWRZ32,"For the Die hard Sara B fans this Is nothing short of Gold. The Video Quality is Amazing. I watched in 1080p, super Clear/crisp. sound was Amazing as well Ive Run it through both times and I can say that the 5.1 is very well done. you can hear the Crowd talking through the rear speakers as well as the slight Reverb from the rear of the Hall it all makes you feel like your in the front row watching.

The whole show is very fun, Sara Talks before almost every song and Explains where she Came up with the idea. She makes quite a few Jokes, most are very cute and quite funny. The show is filled with extras, some that you get to see while watching the Main concert such as the House Boat Performances. As such the houseboat performances are fantastic, they have a very warm and cozy feel to them.
one of the house boat performances you must watch is Many the miles, she forgets the words to the song and just rolls with it.

you also get 2 Performances of Sitting on the dock of the bay. One is Performed on the Piano solo while the other, At the Ending Credits is performed with Jaiver Dunn on the guitar and sara doing the singing.

If you Like her studio album, you will love this concert.

most Artists/bands sound worse live then they do behind the Studio glass. Sara is one of 2 artists I know that sound better Live then in studio.  ( I want to see her live, she is amazing)
she Puts a Little Twist on Each song. as such each song Is ever so slightly more ""Sara""",1238544000,10,1471,4.147368421052631
3589428,5,B001FWRZ32,"Just to confirm that this is a A, B and C region Blu-ray disc with a bonus CD of the concert. As of Dec 2008.

As someone who doesn't live in a Region A country, I got this Blu-ray base on the picture of the back cover. You can just make out the 3 region symbols next to the barcode.",1230076800,,283,3.716666666666667
3589429,5,B001FWRZ32,"Excellent Blu-Ray Disc.  Audio quality was excellent with LPCM, my receiver doesn't support TrueHD, but the 640kbps Dolby sounded as good as can be expected.  There were not any issues with the location in this final recording as mentioned by a previous reviewer.  Sarah is a very talented singer/songwriter and a lot of her personality comes out in her presentation--which kept me entertained!  Three of the songs are also recorded in 1080p as accoustic versions on a houseboat on the bay.  These made an excellent addition to the film!  Also included was a bonus Audio CD with the concert on it, I have not sampled it!",1228348800,3,620,4.80188679245283
3589430,4,B001FWRZ32,"I can only give a review based on the 720p resolution since my TV isn't 1080p. But from what I saw, this is a wonderfully produced Blu-ray disc of the Sara Bareilles concert. There weren't any noticeable artifacts at all during the concert as the picture was very clear. However, during some of the non-concert scenes, the picture does seem a little darker, but that may be a result of the lighting during these scenes or the video settings on my PS3 (this is the first blu-ray disc I've played on it, so I'm not really sure if there are any video settings on the PS3 or not yet). The audio sounded amazing in Dolby Digital 5.1.

Overall, this is a very good Blu-ray disc that any Sara Bareilles fan would be happy to own. My only gripe with the disc is that there are only 12 songs in the concert here. From what I understand, there were more songs that she performed at the actual concert than there is included in this disc. The bonus CD was also a nice little extra.",1228089600,5,970,4.300546448087432
3589431,4,B001FWRZ32,"This seller delivered very quickly. The product was at a great price. Both a CD and a DVD are actually included, you just have to know that the CD tray folds out to reveal the DVD inside. I loved this and listened to it recently on a long car ride with my family. The only problem is that Sara Bareilles seems to strain her voice a little at times, but nobody is perfect and the songs and performance are great, personal, good quality and unique in terms of their style. Think Aimee Mann, Bonnie Rait, Amy Winehouse and Joni Mitchell all combined. Thanks Caiman!!!",1227744000,,564,4.4326923076923075

8302874,3,B001FWRZ32,"Loved the concert and the materiel.  My issue is with the mix of the Blu-Ray audio.  I've done video and audio production and the producers of this Blu-Ray absolutely mixed in NO LFE (low frequency effects) or sub-woofer.  I have a large home theater system and was so disappointed that a Dolby True HD mix would have zero bass track.  Turned my sub-woofer all the way up and nothing is present.  For someone who  has a small system with satellite speakers it must sound horrible.  I listen to the CD recording that accompanies this set all the time and love the songs, the live concert vibe and of course on the CD there is nice deep bass......",1513728000,,645,4.461538461538462
