The Three Stooges in Orbit and Stop Look and Laugh do not even rate a true mentioning. Any othere that may exist, I do not believe I have seen.",1175731200,,344,4.0588235294117645
1860429,5,B00008R9MB,Believe me I enjoyed the Three Stooges films of the early 60's and this is one of the best! An hour and a half of good slapstick with a tale from one of the classics of all time. I laughed out loud at the misadventures of our boys. Go buy this you numbskul!,1174694400,,257,3.8679245283018866
1860430,5,B00008R9MB,"This is by far, my all-time-favorite Three Stooges movie.  A definate ""must own!""

Their parody of the famous 'around the world in 80 days' is perfectly sprinkled with the antics we've always loved -from the great classic one-liners right on down to the usual slap-stick antics.

I've worn 2 VHS tapes out, and will be giving the DVD a run for its' money :)

The one bundled with it is not a bad choice, either.  But then, I'm a bit biased since I've loved the 'stooges since I was a kid :)",1136073600,,490,4.282608695652174
1860431,1,B00008R9MB,This and all of the full length feature stooges films that include Joe De Rita and all the shorts that include Joe Besser stink! (In my Opinion) Give me Curly or give me DEATH! Now that's classic comedy....,1067990400,2,206,4.447368421052632
1860432,2,B00008R9MB,"My favorite Three Stooges film of the 1960s features deserves much better.
Columbia's DVD presents THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE in its original widescreen format.  But although it's advertised as ""remastered,"" the visual quality leaves much to be desired... grainy overall, with several low contrast moments.
Even though no classic Curly or Shemp short subject is included as a bonus, they advertised the DVD to include trailers.  BUT, they aren't Stooge trailers... just three trailers for other upcoming Columbia comedy discs.
Columbia dropped the retail price ...  It wasn't enough.  This DVD's presentation quality is not much better than some bargain basement pd vendors...
 Message to Columbia & Sony: between the Stooges' great legacy, and the profitable property they've been to you for the past 70 years... the fans and the Stooges deserve better!  Very disappointing DVD!!!",1053475200,19,902,5.316901408450704

1860451,4,B00008R9MB,"""The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze"" is a charmingly amusing Stooges excursion as it takes the boys to many exotic locales (although some of them are obviously within the confines of a studio). The opening credits even include an amusing apology to the original author, Jules Vern.
Phileas Fogg III (played with amiable optimism by Jay Sheffield) is challenged to bet his family fortune that he can't make the same journey his ancestor did--the catch being that he cannot spend one single shilling. Unbeknownst to Fogg, his rival is a notorious con artist who plans to frame Fogg for his criminal hi-jinks. So not only is Fogg racing against time to complete his journey in 80 days, he's dodging authorities at every turn.
The Stooges fit into this story as Fogg's faithful servants in London (even Moe has long sideburns at the start!). In spite of the usual Stooge bumblings, they manage to time breakfast, the morning paper & other agendas down to the last second to please their master.
Upon hearing of the bet, they insist on accompanying Fogg on his adventure, where in India, they rescue a kidnapped female (the obligatory leading lady & lovely Joan Freeman). There, the Stooges reprise the old ""Rajah"" routine--done better with the original Curly many shorts ago than Curly Joe here.
An earlier scene as stowaways on a ship provides some needed laughs as the Stooges cleverly steal food from the Chef, get caught, then turn the tables on their captors.
One of the best moments comes in satire: Held for interrogation by Chinese officials, their ""best head-shrinkers"" try to brainwash the Stooges. Instead, three Asian men emerge as dead ringers, poking eyes, slapping faces & creating chaos. The moral here: You cannot brainwash the Stooges; they have NO brains to wash!
In Tokyo (and San Francisco), the boys secure transportation by managing Curly Joe in fights against a behemoth of a Japanese wrestler. Again, another Stooges routine is dusted off as Curly Joe goes berserk every time Larry plays ""Pop Goes the Weasel""--once again done better by Curly in the early ""Punch Drunks"" short.
After some false starts riding inside a furniture truck (which takes them off-course to Canada) and finally held at gunpoint by the con artist in England, the boys discover a miscalculation in time; they have just minutes to meet the deadline. A wild ride in a paddy wagon climaxes the film with a crash through a wall and some welcome slaps from Moe to Larry & Curly. The End.
The problem here is that the film comes across too mild in places. The laughs are uneven and the reprising of old routines come across too lumbering & pale compared to the originals.
However, it's a pleasing film throughout. The two romantic leads are appealing. All-in-all, another fun Stooges caper that gives more chuckles than guffaws.",1201564800,4,2829,4.871369294605809
1860452,3,B00008R9MB,"Though my expectations for any film from the DeRita era are slim to none, this film did a pretty solid job at holding my interest in spite of some boring scenes and the excess length.  A modern adaptation of the Jules Verne classic 'Around the World in 80 Days,' the story starts in London and goes on to Turkey, India, China, Japan, California, Ontario, and finally full circle back to London.  Along the way are a couple of scenes that are (in my opinion kind of pale) reworkings of earlier classic routines, such as the near-sighted Maharajah and playing ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" in the boxing ring.  And while it does start out a bit slowly, after a promising early scene of the Stooges making Phileas Fogg III his breakfast and then getting him the steamer trunks for the journey, it does seem to get faster and better towards the end.  A feature-length film starring slapstick comedians should be more consistently fast-paced, with a lot more comedy instead of concentrating on a rather involved plot.  They just seem funnier in short subjects, when there's no time to waste with a complex plot and the funny stuff is packed in to the fullest extent.  While I didn't really laugh at all, in spite of maybe a dozen amusing scenes and moments, there are some pretty good scenes in it, such as the sumo wrestling match, the high-speed drive through the streets of London near the end, the scene with the Chinese interrogators, and the big fight in the dark with the bad guys in London.  It doesn't come anywhere close to matching their classic output from their golden era in the Thirties, Forties, and even early Fifties, but for one of their feature films, it is pretty decent, solid, and respectable considering it's from the DeRita era.  I didn't hate or dislike it, but I didn't love it or even really like it either.",1188345600,2,1822,4.6191950464396285
