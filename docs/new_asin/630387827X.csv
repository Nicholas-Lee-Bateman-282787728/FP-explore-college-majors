723968,4,630387827X,"This is an excellent movie that can't help but draw comparisons to the movie ""Mrs. Miniver"".  They both came out in 1942 with an England at war and pretty much going it alone.  They focus on the home front and show the quiet tenacity and sacrifice of the British citizen.  There are patriotic speeches in both movies unabashedly designed to stir the emotions of the English (and, presumeably, American) public.  Those speeches are fine with me because they are well done.  I think this point is worthy of comment because the films probably lack some of their punch with generations who already know how all of this turned out.  What is interesting and effective with ""In Which We Serve"" is how the film jumps around in time.  Only the ending is seen in its' proper place.  This enables us to witness how so many people are affected by the events that take place on the HMS Torrin.
I rated this film a ""4"" instead of a ""5"" (4.5 wasn't an option) because, oddly enough, I thought the acting of Noel Coward was too stiff.  He never limbered up in his role unlike the rest of the cast.  This is a movie worth seeing regardless of time and place.",1077408000,15,1141,4.4423076923076925
723969,5,630387827X,"well, maybe an overstatement. however, this film is an amazing dramatic achievement - all kudos to writer/director/lead actor noel coward.  a great movie about WW2 with none of the glossiness and sentimentality of MRS. MINIVER (again, a classic film in its own right).  this is a film about real people in very plausible situations not being ""heroic""; just trying to live during a war with compassion and sense of humor.  (not trying to diss MINIVER, but i never really could buy that nazi in the kitchen scene w/greer garson).  coward and team splice in some actual battle footage which works very well to create an overall production standard that ranks among the best of the period.  even now.  all the actors are great (especially john mills).",1064880000,5,747,4.888888888888889
723970,5,630387827X,"In Which We Serve is a superb film, though some younger people might think it is a little dated, is was made in 1942.
The names were changed but the Captain of the destroyer 'Torrens' is really Lord Louis Mountbatten and his ship, the HMS Kelly, sunk off Crete near Greece during the invasion of the island by the Germans in 1941.
All the speeches and talks the Captain gives to the crew are word for word what Lord Louis said at the time.
It is as close to being the most factual film ever made.
Its a film one can watch every so often and Noel's performance as Captain 'D' is very real and believable.
Highly reccomended.",1005436800,60,623,4.288135593220339

724054,5,630387827X,"""In Which We Serve"" is an excellent depiction of the battles and struggles of British Naval personnel during WWII. The portrayal of Noel Coward as Captain also gives an opportunity to see this outstanding director in the film's leading role. Historically, it is very important for those coming up who have no idea what wartime is like. The words and advice given to Navy wives rings true, and the Captain's relationship to his sailors is to be emulated. As this Captain depicts actual story and words of British Lord Louis Mountbatten, one has a glimpse of an ideal Naval officer in the British Navy. I think young people today would greatly benefit from the message it gives. It should be a part of students' required films for its historical documentation.  The nomination of an Oscar for ""Best Movie"" was well deserved.",1487462400,2,822,4.829787234042553

It was made at a time when the Brits were close to going under and I guess the home front needed some kind of morale boost. It's an interesting sample of how the British classes interacted although I suspect it glosses over some things. Overall I enjoyed it. There is some good Naval action in it.

724303,4,630387827X,"This is a very fine war film by Noel Coward, and perhaps his finest work.  Considering that it was produced while the war was still raging, hence was short of ""props and scenes"", this classic film is particularly noteworthy. It is the story of a British destroyer on service in the Mediterranean during 1939 or 1940, that is eventually sunk by German bombers with the loss of half the crew. The survivors, after a gritty rescue and difficult recuperation, is dispersed to replace other losses within the fleet, which is particularly hard on everyone after the harrowing misadventure and strong interpersonal bonds that were formed.  The film is head and shoulders above the typical propaganda fare that the Allies pumped out at the time, and even though overly ""stiff upper lip"", it is certain a collector's item from that era.",1475712000,,827,4.9

724624,5,630387827X,"(4.5)  Surprise entry into my top 30 films.  An outstanding film.  Harkens to a time long past of heroism, courage, and that quintessential British 'resolve' on display to almost excessive proportions.  Noel Coward is ingenious here creating something special from an otherwise unremarkable 'war story', with excellent characterization, entwined storylines and a dogged enemy. You will quickly be drawn into the world of the HMS Torrin and her crew and fall for each of them in turn, and even for the old ship herself.

Lots of nits to pick for those so inclined as it is a pre-CGI movie with marginal modeling etc (reason for the 1/2 star off).  Perhaps I simply chose to be absorbed in a world and a film where the effort was spent on plot and language not CPU.  And oh that language.  There are lovely examples throughout, but a high point is where Celia Johnson delivers a magnificent little speech that manages amusement and poignancy delivered with a precision and ease that seems remarkable now.  Nearly worth watching by itself.

Invest an hour and a half into these characters as Noel intended and you will be amply rewarded.  Perhaps Noel Coward's best.

Nice touch, but that alone does not a good movie make. Overall, it just does not ever hit the mark. This looks like a ""Critic's Choice"" type of war movie; the line of reasoning being as follows: since it was done by someone prominent, and they did try hard, then it must be a great film. Unfortunately, it just isn't so. Noel Coward was probably the major British star of the time. Most of his work is still held in high regard today.

725045,5,630387827X,"Based mostly on the experiences of Lord Mountbatten on HMS Kelly, IN WHICH WE SERVE is a classic British flag-waver from 1943, attesting to the bravery and sheer grit of captain and crew as they struggle to survive after their ship has been sunk by a German torpedo.  Structured as a series of flashbacks, the narrative focuses on different members of the crew from different socio-economic backgrounds: the bourgeois Captain Kinross (Noel Coward) leading a comfortable family life with his wife (Celia Johnson), and two children (Daniel Massey, Ann Stephens); the middle-class Chief Petty Officer Hardy (Bernard Miles), living with his wife (Joyce Carey) and her mother; and the working-class Ordinary Seaman Blake (John Mills) living in a modest terraced house with his family.  While the film is redolent of the class-consciousness characteristic of that period (there is little no possibility of anyone wanting to improve themselves), it depicts a changing world in which everyone pulls together, both on the battle-front and at home.  The loyalty and dedication of Kinross' crew is quite admirable, even under adverse circumstances: when one member (Richard Attenborough) steps out of line and neglects his duty, he is sternly admonished and never does it again.  On the Home Front the crew members' wives and families stoically endure the pain of separation, while realizing that such experiences have to be endured during wartime.  Even when Hardy loses his wife and mother (both victims of the Blitz), he vows to carry on at his post regardless.  As Kinross, Noel Coward is a model of rectitude, as he tries to do the best for his crew; yet from the clever use of close-up, we understand the depth of emotion lurking underneath that British reserve, especially at the end when he says goodbye to his crew-members.  IN WHICH WE SERVE is noticeably unsentimental in its approach: co-directors Coward and David Lean are not frightened to represent the seamier sides of life in World War II, while paying tribute to the bravery of everyone, whether on active service or remaining at home.

725200,5,630387827X,"In Which We Serve is a 1942 British patriotic war film directed by Nol Coward. Beautifully restored by DigicomTV. The audio and visual quality are excellent!

The screenplay by Coward was inspired by the exploits of Captain Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was in command of the destroyer HMS Kelly when it was sunk during the Battle of Crete.

The film opens with the narration: ""This is the story of a ship"" and the images of shipbuilding in a British dockyard. The action then moves forward in time showing the ship, HMS Torrin, engaging German transports in a night-time engagement during the Battle of Crete in 1941. However when dawn breaks, the destroyer comes under aerial attack from German bombers.

Eventually the little ship receives a critical hit following a low-level pass. The crew's company abandon ship as it rapidly capsizes. Some of the officers manage to find a Carley float as the survivors are intermittently strafed by passing German planes. From here, the story is told in flashback using the memories of the men on the float. The first person to reveal his thoughts is Captain Kinross (Coward), who thinks back to the summer of 1939 when the Royal Naval destroyer HMS Torrin is being rushed into commission as the possibility of war becomes a near certainty.

The ship's company spends a relatively quiet Christmas in the north of Scotland during the Phoney War. But by 1940, the Torrin is taking part in a naval battle off the coast of Norway. However during the action, a young terrified sailor (Attenborough) leaves his station, while another (Mills) returns to work his gun after its crew is knocked unconscious by a torpedo strike on the ship. With the Torrin damaged it is towed back to port, all the time being targeted by dive-bombers.

Safely back in harbor, Captain Kinross tells the assembled ship's company that during the battle nearly all the crew performed as he would expect; however one man didn't. But he tells everyone present they may be surprised to know that he let him off with a caution as he feels as Captain he failed to make the young man understand his duty.

The film then returns to the present as the survivors watch the capsized Torrin slowly take on water. It becomes clear that the badly damaged ship will sink. Once again, the raft is strafed by German planes. Some men are killed, and ""Shorty"" Blake (Mills) is wounded.

The Torrin participates in the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force, (portrayed in the film by the 5th Battalion of the Coldstream Guards). Meanwhile the nightly Blitz is taking its toll on British towns.

The flashback ends as the survivors on the life raft watch the capsized Torrin finally sink. Captain Kinross leads a final ""three cheers"" for the Torrin when suddenly another passing German plane rakes the raft with machine gun fire, killing and wounding more men. Soon after, a British destroyer appears and begins to rescue the men. On board, Captain Kinross talks to the survivors and collects addresses from the dying. He tells the young man who once left his post that he will write and tell the boy's parents that they can be proud that he did his duty; the critically injured young man smiles and dies peacefully.

From here, the stories run concurrently until the end of the film. Telegrams are sent to relatives informing them about the fate of their husbands, sons and fathers.

725201,5,630387827X,"In Which We Serve is a 1942 British patriotic war film directed by Nol Coward. Beautifully restored by DigicomTV. The audio and visual quality are excellent!

The screenplay by Coward was inspired by the exploits of Captain Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was in command of the destroyer HMS Kelly when it was sunk during the Battle of Crete.

The film opens with the narration: ""This is the story of a ship"" and the images of shipbuilding in a British dockyard. The action then moves forward in time showing the ship, HMS Torrin, engaging German transports in a night-time engagement during the Battle of Crete in 1941. However when dawn breaks, the destroyer comes under aerial attack from German bombers.

Eventually the little ship receives a critical hit following a low-level pass. The crew's company abandon ship as it rapidly capsizes. Some of the officers manage to find a Carley float as the survivors are intermittently strafed by passing German planes. From here, the story is told in flashback using the memories of the men on the float. The first person to reveal his thoughts is Captain Kinross (Coward), who thinks back to the summer of 1939 when the Royal Naval destroyer HMS Torrin is being rushed into commission as the possibility of war becomes a near certainty.

The ship's company spends a relatively quiet Christmas in the north of Scotland during the Phoney War. But by 1940, the Torrin is taking part in a naval battle off the coast of Norway. However during the action, a young terrified sailor (Attenborough) leaves his station, while another (Mills) returns to work his gun after its crew is knocked unconscious by a torpedo strike on the ship. With the Torrin damaged it is towed back to port, all the time being targeted by dive-bombers.

The scene in which the men from Dunkirk are unloaded at portside is one of the most moving scenes in film - we are reminded of what great film-making is all about - the craftsmanship, camera work, design, as well as performances and directing.

Navy wives were standing in for their men at home in taking on extra responsibilties for the home and family and being bombarded by air raids too. The men were busy sinking ships and taking it on the chin when they were sunk themselves. No-one panicked when under attack apart from the women who didn't go to the air raid shelter ... with tragic consequences. These are characters brimming with mettle and an overwelming desire to serve. Its the pride of a ships family; the ship that lead the fleet. It ends with that family being largely lost and the remaining men dispersed to fill gaps in other ship's crews. There are glimpses of what passed for family life in those times. Brief times ashore for the men. Its a story told largely in flashback after the ship has sunk and the memories of the survivors in a life raft, that too coming under fire. What struck me was how barbarous war is today just asit has always been.

The standout performance for me was Noel Coward as Captain Kinross. It is both understated and inspiring. I am told he modeled his character on his friend Lord Louis Mountbatten.

Considering the time period and the fact that the world was involved in a conflagration where millions died, the intent of the film was to boost morale and to reassure the masses whose loved ones were fighting and dying in all around the world that their loved ones died for all the right reasons. Hawks and Doves can battle it out in other forums as to the merits of this point of view. Those who lost a loved one wanted to know they didn't suffer and that they didn't die in vain.
As to the ""stiff upper lip"" attitude. My father in law during WW2 had 3 ships sunk out from under him on the ""Malta Run"" from England, to Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Egypt and then back to England. During this time his entire family was enduring the Siege of Malta. One ship had 2 survivors and another was lost with all hands (he was on shore searching for his family at the time). I've seen photos where he was on the bridge of the ship and a Stuka dive bomber was droping a bomb. The first photo shows the Stuka, the next one shows the bomb falling, and the last one shows the bomb hitting the stern of the ship. I asked him why he didn't duck. His reply was that there was no place to hide......my point being that there were some VERY brave men and women who did their duty and fought for freedom so guys like ""Sal Magnum"" could run off at the mouth about a subject (war) he has never experienced.
I found the movie to be as good and any of the type and it is based on the real life exploits of Lord Mountbatten. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1296172800,8,1698,4.211656441717792
725492,4,630387827X,"""In Which We Serve"" is a better than average film of naval combat in the Atlantic and Med. during the early and mid part of the War. Made while the issue was still in doubt you had to understand that by producing and starring in this film Noel Coward, author, playwrite and actor, felt he could contribute to the British War effort. A bit stodgy and firmly steeped in the pretension of the English caste system this film attempts to show the lives of men who fight on small ships in a wide and hostile sea.  Coward gives a wonderfully understated performance that epitomizes ""stiff upper lip"". Combine this with a wonderful supporting cast and even handed direction and you've a near classic. While I like this film I do not love it. It's clearly propaganda and I don't knock it for that, I much prefer a more realistic view of the conflict as found in ""The Cruel Sea"".  Jack Hawkins' portrayal of what naval combat does to a man is diametrically opposed to Coward's and to me, much more believeable. Still you could do much worse than this film.

725493,4,630387827X,"Among the films made in Hollywood and the United Kingdom during World War II -- many now dismissed as ""propaganda"" films aimed to increase morale on the home front  -- this is a fine production.  Its drama and characterizations make it so.  Here are reasons to watch it still:

--The focus on ""the ship"" from the time its keel was laid until it sinks beneath the waves after a bombing attack provides a thoughtful framework for the film.  Here, ""the ship"" is both the machine and the crew.

--Among film portrayals of naval leadership (by, say, Jack Hawkins in ""The Cruel Sea,"" or Russell Crowe in ""Master and Commander,"" or Charles Laughton, Trevor Howard, and Anthony Hopkins in the films on the Bounty mutiny) Noel Coward as ""Captain D"" presents another role model -- outwardly stiff, undemonstrative, and tightly self-disciplined, but caring for the crew on a ""happy and efficient"" ship.  Noel Coward modeled his performance after Lord Louis Mountbatten at the time that HMS Kelly was sunk off Crete in 1941.

--The scenes of Royal Navy gun crews, wardrooms and messes, signalmen, and crew coordination make up for the film's lack of special effects and modern action sequences.  This helps add color and texture to our understanding of the naval battles in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.

In a film with many future stars -- John Mills and Richard Attenborough, looking so young -- I found the portrayal of ""Chief Petty Officer Hardy"" by the British character actor Bernard Miles most affecting.

Noel Coward's energies, always remarkable, were redoubled during the second World War, and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism, which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing.  IN WHICH WE SERVE is still worth watching, but it's nowhere as appealing as either CAVALCADE or THIS HAPPY BREED, and its focus on the ""life and death of a ship"" (the HMS Torrin) is strangely monomaniacal, almost constructivist.  Over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away, symbols of brute strength like something from a Soviet film.  The ship goes up.  The ship goes down.  A new ship rises out of the water.  And in between Coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat, till our interest settles on three--Bernard Miles as Hardy, with his striking, long, hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it--he should have played Ichabod Crane--John Mills as Blake, a tiny little pipsqueak who's feisty in the standard Mickey Rooney-Jimmy Cagney manner, and Noel Coward himself as Captain Kinross, tranquil with class privilege and, in the background, his glamorous marriage to the ineffable Celia Johnson (so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums).

Hitchcok's LIFEBOAT had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical, but without Coward's complicated flashback structure.  Coward stalwarts Joyce Carey and Kay Walsh show up as the love interests for Miles and Mills respectively--Carey, in this movie and in BRIEF ENCOUNTER as well, treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth, nor good-looking in any way, who's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest.  She must have kissed the ground every time Noel Coward walked on it.  Who else would have written such roles for her?

The movie is trying indeed when it goes ""serious,"" and yet that's half the fun of it, seeing how often Coward plays the ""race"" card--""we are an island race"" indeed.  I teared up, of course I did, during the Blitz as the V-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on London households, leading to the death of several favorite characters, and again when Coward leads his naval boys into Dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half-nude British soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of Kool-Aid.  Outside of these scenes, however, the movie is marred by its agitprop and by David Lean's tiresomeness, in showing everything at such a glacial pace.

PS, the film was shot by Ronald Neame who later became a director himself and whose ""masterpiece,"" THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of IN WHICH WE SERVE.",1175299200,,2904,4.838383838383838

I find the flashback technique to tell that story contrived and by now a hopeless clich.  When the picture gets bleary for one more recalled memory, you may struggle to suppress a laugh or a groan--but, darn it, the movie works.  The ship emerges from the Scottish ship yard, goes to sea as war breaks out, and suffers casualties at sea, and, shockingly, ashore.  It takes a pretty hard heart not to shed a tear when Noel Coward says goodbye to his crew.  Made during wartime the film features fine performances by the young John Mills and the very young Richard Attenborough.  You recognize other British character actors.

English filmmakers had a prevailing direction to be more sensitive to the interplay of roles in wartime action...

Heroism was not the privilege of one man... With a common social understanding, working together, as the title of Nol Coward's and David Lean's ""In Which We Serve"" suggests...

The film, one of the finest wartime dramas to come out of Britain, tells the story of an English destroyer HMS Torrin, sunk in the Mediterranean Sea by the Germans, during the Battle of Crete...

As commander and crew keep close to the life raft, the screen fades gradually to take us back in active to the commission of the ship...

By concentrating on each member of the crew a different memory is relieved, and each flashback advances the story of the life of the ship and the men who served on her...

It is a magnificent film about courage and dedication, devotion and sacrifice... It is a tribute to the spirit of the western democracies but also to the spirit of the British people who would not admit defeat...

Too many films of the Second World War have the feel of modern times that just happen to be set in the past; and don't affect one viscerally to any significant extent.  1940s Britain, particularly when that island stood alone, is a hard mood to capture, but this film succeeds herein.  Contrary to some other reviewers here, this film isn't propagandistic (in the manner that that term is usually viewed).  It simply presents the gravity of the era (1939-1941) in which it was shot (1942) in almost real time; when Britain was hanging on precariously as the Royal Navy kept it afloat, so to speak.  Showing bravery, British mettle, and presenting British resistance against Hitler's Nazism is patriotic sure, but not propagandistic as well.  Sometimes issues are Black & White, contrary to those who desire to see shades of gray in everything as a matter of self-perceived personal intellectual superiority.  To show Britain fighting valiantly is not akin to Goebbels championing German braveness.  The night of long knives, the state-sanctioned racism, the holocaust, the brutality of the Germans in occupied lands do not have equivalents on the British side. Certainly not in relation to the Second War War.  ""In which we Serve"" is simply a fine film which captures an era & for anyone who wants to understand that era (viscerally even) one would be well served by giving it some of your time.

 Why so? Because all 3 were made at the start of the war (early 40's) when England stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt Hitler and aggresive facism. Invasion fears were rife, the war effort looked hopeless at times as in Europe, Hitler opposing country after country fell to the German aggressors (not to mention the rampage going on in Africa at the hands of Rommel  aided by the Italian forces under Mussolini's instruction).  England's small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed, starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day. It was quite possibly the darkest of times in English History and these three films capture the flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to survive and protect, with realistic perfection. In which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly, inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of British life.

 For a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made (1942), and I guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely Coward's plan.

 An absolute gem and a must see, I weep every time I watch it.",1117411200,23,1493,4.628787878787879
725586,5,630387827X,"For many years, it was almost impossible to see this ""classic"" from among the films produced in 1942, during some of England's darkest hours. According to most accounts, Noel Coward was determined to make his own contribution to the war effort. His objective was to improve morale by celebrating that which he believed the English people have traditionally cherished most: ""king and country,"" family, teamwork, human dignity, and courage. He wrote the screenplay, composed the musical score, and starred in a film whose leading character, Captain Kinross (played by Coward), was inspired by Lord Louis Mountbatten. The film's structure was significantly influenced by Citizen Kane, a film which Coward greatly admired. What a cast! In addition to Coward, others include John Mills, Celia Johnson, Richard Attenborough, Bernard Miles, Michael Wilding, and James Donald. Although identified as co-director, Coward entrusted most of the work to David Lean with whom he had carefully studied Welles' film before going into production. Here's the basic situation: Captain Kinross and a few survivors cling to life in a dinghy after their destroyer, H.M.S. Torrin, has been sunk by Luftwaffe dive-bombers. As the shipmates bob in the water, they reminisce about loved ones at home with whom they shared so many happy moments. And then....

In addition to assembling an outstanding cast, Coward also enlisted the superb talents of Ronald Neame (cinematographer) and Thelma Myers (editor). Those who have at least some familiarity with Coward's talents as a writer and performer should not be surprised that In Which We Serve has such a well-written screenplay and is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end. However, if they have not as yet seen this film, they may be surprised to learn that Coward displays none of the mannered sophistication which is so evident, for example, during his appearances on television, in other films, and in musical reviews on Broadway and (especially) in casinos at Las Vegas. Captain Kinross is the archetypical English naval officer, portrayed by Coward without glitz or glamor. His upper lip remains appropriately stiff until the final, unforgettable scene but there is no doubt whatsoever about his inherent decency. His love and respect for those under his command are obvious, as are theirs' for him. Recognizing the risk of misleading anyone who reads these brief remarks, I hasten to add that In Which We Serve also offers an abundance of riveting action as H.M.S. Torrin and her crew engage the enemy. To Coward, his cast, and his crew, well-done!",1094601600,95,2588,5.251207729468599
725587,4,630387827X,"As noted by P J Cosgrove - this is a docu/drama of Louis Mountbatten's action off Crete in HMS Kelly.  Noel Coward hero worshipped Mountbatten who was present for some of the filming.  By that stage of the (real) war it was well known that aircraft would sink anything still in sight in daylight.  Mountbatten stayed off Crete in daylight when he expressly knew he should not and paid the inevitable price.  In reality Mountbatten was NOT sent back to sea or given another sea command.

Historically the film is interesting for the close ups of real WWII desroyer weapons systems in action and some impressive action shots.

It is also interesting in the context of propaganda/morale raising of the period.  The home front scenes cut with the sea action gives context to both groups who endured the war.

However what is most significant is the portrayal of the social class system and how it is reflected aboard ship in the command structure.  While never intended at the time - it is an interesting vignette for those who are interested in the history of the period.

7854629,5,630387827X,"Nol Coward, renowned playwright, was most celebrated for his witty stage plays, but he's dabbled a time or two with cinema. In fact, whilst palling around with Winston Churchill, he expressed interest in contributing to England's war effort against Germany. Ergo, In Which We Serve, a grand 1942 propaganda film that he scored, starred in, co-directed (with David Lean), and for which script he wrote. He based the character he plays on the battle experiences of Captain Lord Louis Mountbatten, whose naval destroyer, H.M.S. Kelly, was sunk by Germans in early 1941.

The opening narration goes like this: ""This is the story of a ship."" Specifically, it's the story of the royal naval destroyer, the H.M.S. Torrin and its captain and its crew of 244 men. It's chronicled in semi-documentary fashion, which lends the thing a sense of stark realism. A huge chunk of it are flashback sequences that give us the background histories and domestic lives of certain of the crewmembers, particularly the Captain (Coward), the affable Chief Petty Officer Hardy (Bernard Miles), and everyman sailor Shorty Blake (John Mills).

There have been plenty of war pictures that have strived to depict hard-bit verisimilitude, and some of them have been sensational. In Which We Serve is one of the best at this. It doesn't at all try to be flashy, and this is appreciated. It's a character study, and that's okay. The performances are universally terrific, and it's telling that because the actors play their roles as real, down-to-earth men and women, their heroism and sacrifice mean that much more.

Coward undoubtedly wanted to articulate his people's resiliency and indomitable spirit and national fortitude, that famous stiff upper lip. And we sense all that, palpably, as the Torrin sails from one skirmish to the next, and lives are lost and the children and womenfolk back home are left to pray and to agonize. To quote some bloke in the film: ""Men must work, and women must weep.""

Truth to tell, some of the most poignant scenes revolve around the womenfolk, whether it's the Captain's wife Alix (Celia Johnson), CPO Hardy's beloved Kath (Joyce Carey), or young Shorty Blake's modest bride Freda (Dora Gregory). Some folks tout the Coward's farewell speech near the movie's end as the most rallying, but I say that, rather, it's Celia Johnson's remarkably moving toast to a blushing bride on behalf of ""all wretched naval wives.""

I wish YouTube had been around in the 1940s, because, then, the world would've been able to see more of Celia Johnson's works on display. She is so good, in this movie and in Brief Encounter, for which she received her one Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In Which We Serve was her big screen debut, her first of tragically not too many appearances in film. Celia Johnson was a stage actress, except that, in the 1940s, she couldn't commit to extended stage runs due to her service in the Women's Auxiliary Police Corps and her commitment to caring for her family. She turned to film and to radio as those mediums had the less time-consuming schedules. As mentioned, she still didn't make enough movies, not nearly enough.

In Which We Serve is a morale booster in a time when a bombed-away island nation desperately required such upliftment. It's the most classic illustration of wartime British cinema, the sort that adroitly expresses a people united in patriotism and in social accord and resolute in spitting in the face of an oncoming abomination. To quote Celia Johnson's closing words in that wonderful toast: ""God bless this ship and all who sail it."" See this movie.",1516060800,,3611,4.9504950495049505
7854630,5,630387827X,"Thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. The first scene, before the movie even started, brought back so many memories  the signed & initialed certification ""This is to certify that the British Board of Film Censors has Passed In Which We Serve for UNIVERSAL EXHIBITION. Produced MCMXLII. I haven't seen such certifications preceding a movie for decades & Im glad it was left in on this DVD version. The actors include Noel Coward (who also wrote the movie) Celia Johnson, Daniel Massey, John Mills, Richard Attenborough and of course Bernard Miles. Who could forget his characteristic bass voice? Followers of Richard Attenborough will be especially interested in that this was his film debut at just age 19. As mentioned in the certification, the movie was produced in 1942 and clearly went for authenticity at all levels of the ships company by having as naval advisors  not just a Leut. Commander and a Leutenant but also a lowly able seaman. It was a nice touch to have all three individually named in the credits.
The movie covers the life of a destroyer, HMS Torrin, from its construction (you don't often see riveting of steel plate any more) to its eventual sinking in the Mediterranean Sea and the lives of those manning her. The story is nicely told in flashback format. The lives both on board and ashore of various crew members are shown. Particularly poignant for me were the air raid scenes when the characters were back home on leave. My own parents were similarly subjected and it brought home to me just how devastating it was to be bombed and how random were the consequences.
It should not be forgotten that the movie was made in England during the Second World War at a time when the outcome was far from clear. It was made to bolster a country subjected to nightly bombing and suffering severe food rationing, yet the propaganda was not overbearingly. It was sufficient to simply relate the events as they were. Overall, an excellent movie and a collectable - a period piece in both story and production.",1515628800,2,2014,4.7844827586206895
