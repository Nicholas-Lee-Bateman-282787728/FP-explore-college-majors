5886508,5,B00E1RT7TS,"The Women of Homecoming, Vol 1 was a great purchase for me.  One of the highlights was seeing and listening to the very pretty Amy Grant sing and play her guitar.  Gaither guitarist Kevin W#illiams said, ""I've always wanted to play for 75 beautiful women,"" and now his wish has come true.  A truly fine production from Gaither.",1394668800,,327,4.603448275862069
5886509,5,B00E1RT7TS,We love Gaither Videos.  This is one of the best.  Well arranged...we would buy it again.  It's a great watch.,1391817600,,110,4.4
5886510,5,B00E1RT7TS,I've never gotten a Gaither DVD that did not arrive in perfect condition - and had everything that was promised - if I had one quibble it is that I wish there had been a way to identify a good many of the Women in the DVD - some of course were readily identifiable - other's not so much - but it surely did not take away from the wonderful music - the quality of the DVD - and I'm happy to have added this to my collection of (over) 75 Gaither DVD's,1390694400,,449,3.838709677419355
5886511,4,B00E1RT7TS,"As usewual, this homecoming video is wonderful, full of music and emotions. I baught this one because I have seen all of these female gospelsingers in other homecoming productions of Bill Gaither. Why only four stars? because I think it would have been even more deep if Gloria had done the presentation in stead off Bill.",1389398400,2,322,4.767857142857143
5886512,5,B00E1RT7TS,This too was/is a wonderful packed video full of women who know how to share through their gift of singing.,1388534400,,107,4.4
5886513,5,B00E1RT7TS,"The only thing I would have liked to see is the women playing instruments.  All of these women are very talented and can play variety of instruments.  The music is lovely.  I own many Gaither videos, I love the variety. The songs on this video are contemporary and many are original writings.",1388016000,,292,4.576923076923077

While the whole video is exciting, some of the younger artists are exceptionally exciting too.  I have been buying Amy Grant (her secular music) before this because of her musicality.  She does sincere, beautiful music with her guitar and small band.  Kristyn Getty (in Volume One) and her band mates were so worth the trip from Ireland for Homecoming.  They did a performance that has influenced my life.  I understand Natalie Grant sometimes provides worship for some large gatherings of Joyce Meyer Ministries. Her performance makes me want to see her for real at one of these events when she is chosen to lead again.  These younger artists, and the many other exceptional artists that sing in solo roles and that sing in chorus together really knock the musical ball out of park, in both Volumes of Women o f Homecoming (2013).
The enthusiasm of these performers, probably Angela Primm in ""Days of Elijah"" in Volume Two is one of the best examples, and even the enthusiasm that is visible in the candid faces of the women in the crowd, show people being moved by music (and by message).  These images say a lot, that for the right person, experiencing this music being performed like this can be a profound kind of experience and very entertaining as well.
But if you are not a Christian, but you like good female voices, and you like beautiful vocal music backed-up by a good small band, there is still a lot in these DVD's to find in this work that is very satisfactory.",1382400000,4,1819,5.592727272727273
5886515,4,B00E1RT7TS,"I am a huge fan of southern gospel music and I thoroughly enjoyed Volume One of the Women of Homecoming.  I felt like I was right there with the ladies, singing and harmonizing, laughing and shedding a tear.  Bill and Gloria Gaither hit on a great idea by bringing all these ladies together for an event.  I love the older gals of southern gospel, but we are to ""sing to the Lord a new song"" and these newer ladies have really hit the mark.  I've already ordered Volume Two.",1382313600,2,474,4.292134831460674
5886516,3,B00E1RT7TS,"Gaither dvds are always good. As a collector of nearly all of them and familiar with many faces, I was disappointed not to have names of women in the audience labeled as the camera passed over them. Veterans age and change as well as having work done to their faces and then their children, etc grow up and it is impossible to put them together. It would have been more like a homecoming if all had been identified.

The music/ singers was less than what it should have been with that much talent in the room. I expected more women of the homecoming videos than so many new ones and not as many religious songs.",1382227200,4,611,4.3130434782608695
5886517,5,B00E1RT7TS,My ladies group sings along with some of these wonderful songs when we meet as we watch portions of the DVD.  I love that there are women of various ages and music styles coming together to praise the Lord in song.,1423958400,,214,4.219512195121951

5886525,5,B00E1RT7TS,"My family and I love the Women of Homecoming.  We are watching it over and over.  We also purchased Vol 2 from our Christian Bookstore.  We would love to have heard from each lady in the choir, but we understand that would have taken many more DVDs and time.  Such a great idea to have the women get together!  We missed Lisa Williamson.  We would love to have heard just a little from Gordon Mote's wife, Debbie Tally to givie every lady a little time to minister.  We loved the ""Sisters"" trio and Sandy Patty with them.

We also purchased ""Celebration"".  Thanks for bringing it out of the ""vault""
