3960146,5,B002NTDXO6,Fantastic film - we are basing our summer program around the Vaquero - the forgotten Cowboy!  This will be a great addition to our program.  Beautiful scenery!,1338249600,2,159,4.851851851851852
3960147,2,B002NTDXO6,I bought this for my husband. It was OK. He was born and raised as a working cowboy. Wrong video for him.,1334534400,,105,3.8181818181818183
3960148,5,B002NTDXO6,"Beautiful short film just 30+ minutes long but always topnotch from IMAX. Packed with beautiful scenery and superb aerial shots from the Old & New World (present day Arabia, Spain, South America, Mexico, USA, Canada) of the modern riding horse. Also includes historical significance of the evolution of riding tack. Recommend it for all horse lovers!",1323388800,,350,5.267857142857143
3960149,5,B002NTDXO6,Showed this to my 9th grade World Geography class - they all loved it and they never love anything!  Great images.  Cool cultural connections!  My country-western kids loved it!  My horse-girls loved it!,1299024000,8,203,5.0606060606060606
3960150,5,B002NTDXO6,"The product has not been opened because it is a Christmas gift, but we were very happy that the DVD we received is what we ordered and it arrived very quickly.  We are pleased with our purchase through your company.",1280534400,2,215,4.375
3960151,5,B002NTDXO6,"Ride Around the World is a beautiful and facinating history of horses used to work, and play, in the management of livestock. In other words, the history of horses and their role in ranching. The scenery and the narration and the music are blended very well to make this a great watch. Anyone who is even slightly interested in horses, and especially those who like western disciplines, will absolutely love this DVD. I plan to purchase several copies for gifts.",1263859200,18,462,4.7875
3960152,4,B002NTDXO6,"I greatly enjoyed this movie.  The scenery, music and history provided are wonderful.  The only missing element is the lack of information on the ""Paniolo"" tradition in Hawaii.  Some of the best cowboys in history learned and worked their trade in the Hawaiian Islands.",1262476800,2,269,5.068181818181818

3960166,5,B002NTDXO6,"This documentary is about the history of cowboys and their horses from all over the world. It is a great IMAX video with beautiful scenery, I really enjoyed it. It also has a ""making of video"" which covers the American Quarter horse. If you are a cowboy or enjoy horses you will enjoy this video.",1405296000,,296,4.4
3960167,5,B002NTDXO6,Came fast and we all enjoy watching the beautiful settings. You all are going to cause me to not write reviews they don't have to be a novel to say what I think.  Judy,1401321600,,167,3.911764705882353
3960168,5,B002NTDXO6,"Very educational and my kids loved it.

I am not sure why it is required to write so much for a review. I liked it and that's it.",1392336000,,129,3.607142857142857

8375412,1,B002NTDXO6,"I'm a huge horse lover and avid equestrian. I was so disappointed by this video. Maybe in was fun to see in IMAX on the big screen, but only touched on a very small part of equestrian culture around the world. IMO leaving out some of the most important and significant riding styles, cultures and horses. It was also very short.",1449100800,,328,4.39344262295082
8375413,3,B002NTDXO6,I thought there would be more of a story.  It was ok but not great.,1441065600,,67,3.466666666666667

8375416,2,B002NTDXO6,not impressive. some good info but a lot of heroification of abusive horse hanxling such as horse tripping. Not worth the give away price I paid,1428883200,,144,4.576923076923077
