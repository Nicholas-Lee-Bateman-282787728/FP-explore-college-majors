It is honestly just a home video of two older Americans in search of a margarita and Tex-Mex food! They are just amazed that you can't get a margarita in Ibiza (Hello fools, this is SPAIN, not Mexico). Equally amazed that you can't get iced tea there, or Jenny Craigs lite ranch dressing.

Ibiza is a truly an amazing place. I have been there and bought this video just to show friends more about Ibiza. I am too embarassed to show anyone. This will go straight to the dumpster. Thank goodness it was cheap.",1149292800,,684,4.3858267716535435
