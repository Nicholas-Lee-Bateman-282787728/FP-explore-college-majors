8540037,5,B009D4GWBU,"Danny Glover does a really nice job of narrating this classic folktale, and the artwork is charming in its own way as well, but the thing that puts this over the top and makes it something just short of a masterpiece is the beautiful, peaceful, soothing music of Taj Mahal. I'm considering getting the soundtrack as well just to hear even more. Fantastic.",1487548800,,355,4.650793650793651
