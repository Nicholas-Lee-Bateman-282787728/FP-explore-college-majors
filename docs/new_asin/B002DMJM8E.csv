8365440,3,B002DMJM8E,"This item from amoebamusichollywood (only) is misrepresented!  The ad says it is a NOT RATED version, implying (though not saying) it could be a director's cut.  Further, there is no length specified, adding to that implication.

In fact, it is rated R, and is 154 minutes in length, just like the other BluRay and DVD listed.  Note also that the picture in the ad is the same as the picture on the DVD version, whereas the delivered BluRay has the same picure as the other BluRay listed.

More troubling is that the BluRay delivered has a sticker on it with the ""BestBuy"" tag logo and EXCLUSIVE on it, suggesting it was stolen from BestBuy. If it was legitimately purchased as a store closeout, etc., they should say so.",1340150400,,721,4.6015625
8365441,4,B002DMJM8E,"I've always loved this movie,  I'm glad to have it now in Blu-ray. I had been hoping it would come available for quite some time.",1317600000,,129,4.16
8365442,5,B002DMJM8E,"When I saw this movie many years ago I fell in love with both the simplicity and the complexity of the plot. Based on John Grisham's bestseller and being a person who loves the 'twist' in a story, this was captured beautifully in ""The Firm"". Excellent acting overall with a number of famous faces including Tom Cruise, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Gene Hackman to name a few. This has to be one of my favourite Cruise movies and is well worth purchasing if you haven't seen it before. The colour on the Blu-ray was superb with only a minor black blotching in one night scene - the rest was perfect. I would rate it 5/5 for picture clarity and 10/10 overall. Well worth buying.",1315267200,21,670,4.455284552845528
