8707513,5,B00UN7F91U,I've been watching episodes of this show on YouTube for a while. Now I can enjoy them even better with this 8 disc set. Every episode of this cult classic series is worth watching.,1485302400,,180,4.323529411764706

8707515,5,B00UN7F91U,I love this show it has good action and animation for it's time that more than make up for the dub being somewhat akward.,1460073600,,121,4.083333333333333
8707516,1,B00UN7F91U,Eastern Star / Discotek is a fake company without rights to squat.  Just thought you should know.  Ask Shelby to show you his filed copyright to any of his titles.  Can't,1459728000,2,170,4.419354838709677

8707518,1,B00UN7F91U,"I really didn't want this to happen. I loved this show back in the 90's and was excited about finally owning it on DVD. But then I got it on the release date with instant shipping and the problems started. It started out okay, but then halfway through the first disc, it started pausing and skipping and that got so bad I couldn't even finish the damn thing. I took a look at the back and it was all scratched up. So I got the disc cleaned at a nearby video store (which has fixed plenty of my scratched discs and they played great afterwards), and that still didn't fix the problem. So I returned it and bought the item again from RightStuff, but the same damn problems still happened! I actually tried putting in the second disc this time, and the skipping and pausing were still painfully present, so I sent it back again.

I know for a fact that it's not my DVD player to blame for this. The one I used to play this set was the same one the I watched all 152 episodes of Fist of the North Star, all 4 Saint Seiya movies, and all 27 episodes of Mega Man (all Discotek products) on without any problems. Yet I bought this set twice and the same problems popped up each time.

Shame on you Discotek, I used to be a huge fan of yours, but I don't plan to buy anything else of yours for a long time.",1443657600,8,1298,4.106299212598425
8707519,4,B00UN7F91U,Got here well before they said it would but it has some pixilation problems. Not the shippers problem but in manufacture. Still for something done in '90 anf full of bad animation it is OK.,1438646400,4,189,4.428571428571429
