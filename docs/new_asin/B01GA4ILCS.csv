7759277,5,B01GA4ILCS,"This brilliant drama, ""Les innocentes"" (English captions), was submitted by France and Poland for the 2016 Seattle International Film Festival. Our press screening audience was agreed: This is one of the best films of 2016 SIFF so far. This review was first published in the Spring of 2016, so some of you have seen it before.

Director Anne Fontaine (""Gemma Bovery"") working with a team of writers, brings us the upsetting tale of a young Red Cross worker dispatched to assist the survivors of the German invasion in 1945 Poland. She is called to help seven Benedictine nuns who are in an advanced stage of pregnancy. They had been raped by the Russian army who came to liberate them from the Germans. Therein lies our tale...

The cast:
  * Lou de Lage - Mathilde Beaulieu has her work cut out for her. She assists with surgery on wounded French soldiers, but is secretly called to help at a local cloister. Their secrets are not hers to tell...
  * Agata Kulesza is the Mother Abbess. It is her religious community that has been violated, but the vows her lambs took are the most important thing. They MUST NOT BREAK THEM.
  * Agata Buzek - Maria isn't as deeply traumatized as some of the others, but has to find a middle ground for her sisters. She can see the damage being done by Mother Abbess but has sworn to obey.
  * Joanna Kulig - Irena is torn between her vows and motherhood.
  * Vincent Macaigne - Samuel has to accept the loss of Mathilde when they go their separate ways, but first there is additional work to be done.

This memorable film addresses the quandaries for the women, from a social, philosophical, political and spiritual point of view. Or as one audience member put it, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly!""",1471046400,15,1734,4.554838709677419
7759278,5,B01GA4ILCS,"The Innocents (2016) takes you into world of cloistered nuns who have undergone mass rape by Russian liberators. The way the sisters deal with the after effects is astoundingly portrayed in this heroic drama about the greatest evil anyone can commit, namely to use another human being for sexual pleasure at the expense of that raped person's consent. When something is done to another person where there is absolutely no mutual consent, where the notions of reason based on justice, and in this film spirituality there is great evil. This film depicts such an evil in a way that is unforgettable.

Not to be missed.",1470700800,19,616,4.866666666666666

""The Innocents"" conveys hideous rapes and impregnation of women by Soviet soldiers in 1945 Poland.  In this case, the women happen to be cloistered nuns.  ""The Innocents"" takes a deeply disturbing look at the crimes against these nuns - as well as crimes against children (born and not yet born) - and assistance from young (Doctor/) Mathilde: ""the nuns way is respected and even ultimately affirmed. The sisters have lost a kind of innocence, but made room for another, and the dominant note in the end is hopeful and life-affirming"" (Steven Greydanus, National Catholic Register, 7/1/16).

""Mathilde"" is reported to be based on the real life experiences of Dr. Madelein Pauliac, recounted by her nephew, Philippe Maynial.  Because of the stereotypical nature of some characters, I have been eager to find out how factually the story follows Dr. Pauliac's experiences.  I have found it difficult to ascertain Dr. Pauliac's actual involvement in similar situations (cf., Arthur Herlin, The true story of Madeleine Pauliac, the heroine of the film ""The Innocent"", 2/20/2016 - via Google translate).",1469318400,30,1172,5.274193548387097
7759280,5,B01GA4ILCS,"Extraordinary. Not only is this film captivating in its beauty and grace, but it also presents human drama in all its greatness and tragedy, flaws and triumphs, hopes and terrors. The acting is exceptional, and the characters are full blooded and rich. There are villains, but they're mostly off-stage. The film focuses on its heroines - lots of them, women of tremendous courage and soul. Finally, this is a true religious film, a story of faith and doubt in the context of tremendous moral dilemmas that arise out of the Christian vows the nuns in the story have taken. They don't all choose the same; one of the many strengths of this film is it presents us with a number of different outcomes, leaving the viewer with many possibilities to mull.

7759288,5,B01GA4ILCS,"This is the kind of movie that embeds itself in your brain and stays there as a great one. On the pro side of the movie: the black and white photography, the habits against the white snow, the music perfectly chosen - not blaring, just there sandwiched in with the nuns' beautiful chants, the pace of the film, the interaction between all the characters, the minimum of dialogue.

I liked that it was difficult to distinguish between each nun - it was appropriate to their essence, a group of people dedicated to their calling - prayer. Imagine the dark night of their souls: they are mostly virgins; they find themselves viciously violated, the result of which is the most innocent of beings.

An angel in the form of a Red Cross worker is desperately called to help by the mother superior's second-in-command. The nuns are not to be touched or exposed. What a situation for a medical person! However Maria, (nurse, doctor, student?) balances the assistance she gives the women during childbirth between subtly examining them under a sheet and doing very little to them (except the breech birth) with the expectation that the mothers will give birth because they have no other choice.

On the con side: the viewer has to make some assumptions - what is Maria's level of expertise? What is her relationship with the sexy but also kind doctor? What is the main purpose of the convent that houses a large number of nuns in what seems to be the middle of nowhere?

Enough said. Watch it, think about it, discuss it, remember it.",1486857600,,1525,4.67910447761194

7759295,2,B01GA4ILCS,"The film is sold in a case that is one of those rare modern instances where function meets design. The disc fits snugly, yet, accessible with a simple light fingertip touch that does not force the disc down onto the plastic, saving the disc from scratches and even fingerprints. It is a shame not every DVD has such a housing.

The films sound and picture are clear and crisp on this DVD, running at 115 minutes in both Polish and French languages. This is not a film you are going to enjoy online without English subtitles because you will need these to follow the drama. As one reviewer for Salon alluded to in a review, the drama in this film is undemonstrative so youll need the language more so than the flickering images. As you would expect from a foreign film making the grade in Hollywood, this DVD has English subtitles. The direction and acting are fine for what is presented as story.

Where the film fails to live up to its promise, becoming a trite atheistic clich rather than an exploration of faith-based belief, is either the fault of the original idea by Philippe Maynial or (in collaboration with) the translation of his idea by screenwriters Sabrina B. Karine & Alice Vial. At this early stage in the story-making process, what could have been an engaging and complex unraveling that examines the human condition of behaviour founded on Gods love becomes a tepid love song to self-doubt scatted out by a jaded lover in a darkened windowless room. The whole film is built atop the Mother Superiors monstrous action, which examines public relations narrative control more than it explores any faith-based storyline to carry on and accept because God knows what He is doing. Had it done that, the caricatures of the Mother Superior and the Sisters would have been more than the two-dimensional roles the actors were forced to play. Exploring the nature of a relationship with God during times of great questioning, as one might reasonably expect occurs in a convent where the Sisters have been brutally raped by their wartime liberators, is not what this film is about. If any spiritual message is given it is an apologetic for an absent Father because of the faithlessness acts of His people. This was not satisfying.

In the end, everything can be explained as a Divine test of refinement, and those Sisters who do not make the grade are left to wander hitchhiking down  their darkened road alone. Their rape was a deserved punishment like Jonah deserved to be swallowed by a big fish. This is almost insulting. I was looking for a statement with more meaning than this when I viewed this film. I do not see what the hype is about this film unless it comes from reviewers who have watched too much afternoon television.

Was this meant to be the trite apologetic it is: a small story about personal drama revolving around the care of innocents borne from criminal/physical/spiritual violations? The back of the box does not sell it like that stating: the nuns increasingly turn to non-believer Mathilde as their beliefs and traditions clash with the harsh realities of a war-torn land. This pitch does not paint Mathilde as the Messianic figure she is in the film, rather, it colours her as an unbeliever or wolf within the henhouse. The test of faith upon the Sisters is not from Mathilde but from their leader: and this begs the question do the originators of the screenplay have any faith to explore? Ive seen more exploration of doubt in the epistolary of Thomas Moore or the comparative works of John Donne than what this film offers. I am left with the thought that the film would have been far more engaging, and its tableau far grander, if the writers had any faith in God with which to grapple.",1482883200,,3722,4.7024539877300615

I think the film respectfully maintains a balance between the sanctity of a cloistered convent and the real dilemmas shown throughout the story.

8762702,5,B01GA4ILCS,"A serious, unusual and poignant film dominated by a marvellous performance from the ever-charismatic Lou de Laage. It is set in late 1945.
The members of a convent has been repeatedly raped by occupying Russian forces, and a French medic tries to help them through the ensuing pregnancies and births under the cloak of discretion. It is nothing if not a film by a woman about women, and thoroughly welcome for that. The script does pretty well in polarising a range of attitudes - the medic's lover is another doctor, a Jew who is brought in to help out, notwithstanding his contempt for Poles and Russians. She too is raped by some Russian soldiers during the film, but the event, oddly, is quickly forgotten and not exploited from an affective or moral standpoint: and the angel-of-mercy ending introduces a saccahrine dimension to an otherwise sober, and agreeably understated presentation. The filming, poised between monochrome and colour, is dapper in the highest measure - a little too much so for its own good, I began to think. But this is mandatory viewing: buy it, see it!",1513555200,,1083,4.859459459459459

I don't want to spoil it for anyone.
I will however say that it makes one think about the awful things people do to other people whether out of
hate or evil intentions due to wartime/other stressors  or to supposedly be helpful (one of the nuns in the movie).
It is also about faith and one's ability to cope with horrible adversity. It also somewhat delves into how seemingly
good people (the above referenced nun) might not be in their right mind due to illness of their own and do shocking
things thinking it would help. We see that type of
thing all the time in the news So many things to think about that it might stay with you and make you think for a
very long time.",1493424000,3,780,4.2

8762710,5,B01GA4ILCS,"The Innocents is a phenomenal film that is gripping and deeply moving.  The film tells the story (based on her memoirs) of a young French doctor who served in Poland immediately after World War II (helping liberated POWs, I think) who was summoned to a cloistered convent of nuns to help with their deep, dark secret  that many of the younger nuns have become pregnant after repeated rapes by Russian soldiers as they fought through Poland in the wars last months.  The film paints a nuanced and absorbing portrait of the growing relationships between the young, atheist doctor and these deeply religious women as their individual conflicts unfold.  The Mother Superior struggles with her guilt and revulsion about this sinful blot on her convent; her assistant (played by Agata Buzek, who is superb) develops a strong friendship with the doctor, conveying her own conflicts about her faith and her choice to turn her back on her former life in the world; many of the other nuns and novices fear their pregnancies and what they mean in terms of the nuns own vows of chastity.  Its a deep, complex portrait of several interesting women, and an absorbing meditation on issues of faith and the complexity of each human life.  Not to be missed.",1493164800,2,1240,4.8254716981132075
