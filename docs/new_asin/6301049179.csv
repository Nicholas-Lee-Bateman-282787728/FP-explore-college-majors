2789753,2,6301049179,"The film is solid entertainment. Thanks to it's overall silliness, nifty mutant cat puppets, and classic horrible dialogue, it never approaches boring. It's well worth a purchase for b-movie fans, despite the vhs quality picture, lack of extras, and extremely shoddy cover (mine looked like it was printed on a home printer that was running out of color ink). The whole package feels like a bootleg.",1283472000,2,399,5.0606060606060606
2789754,4,6301049179,"I took me forever to find out the name of this film.  I saw when I was a kid late one night on TV and it stuck with me.  When I saw it was coming to DVD I pre-ordered it.  Everything about this movie is terrible yet great at the same time.  When I got it in the mail, I bought 2 six packs and invited a few friends over to watch it.  We had a great time watching it and making fun of it.  My friends still bring it up from time to time in idle conversation.
I'd give the film 5 stars if they would have kept the original VHS cover art.  The cover on the DVD is generic and the cat displayed looks nothing like the one in the movie.",1277251200,4,631,3.699248120300752
2789755,5,6301049179,"I was so excited when this finally hit dvd!!!  It's the only horror flick I know of that involves a killer, mutated, demonic cat!...well...there's two or three other horror flicks , 'The KISS', 'Church' from 'Pet Sematary', and 'Sleepwalkers'....wait...'Cat People' also.  Anyway, this has to be my favorite evil cat flick!!!  This movie is just CHEESY GOODNESS ALL THE WAY!!!  You'll love what comes outta this cat!  People on the boat aren't safe once this kitty gets on board!  You gotta see it to believe it!  There is also another dvd of this horror flick; it comes as a double feature with 'MUTANT', another 80's cheese-fest creature flick!  ENJOY!",1259798400,11,654,4.935779816513762
2789756,3,6301049179,"It's made for kicks, though the only good acting was from the cat, and the rest of the cast was laughably bored.  Though I admit I like this film for the simple fact I hate cats (even though there are specific, horrible horror cat movies, I mean killer cats? Willard (1971) worked and was convincing, but killer cats? Give me a rat).

It was a nice try and an original idea, but cheap effects and bad acting ruin the film.  Too bad they never made a sequel.  I wouldn't have rented it.

All I can say is, yes this film is very cheaply made, however, what do you expect when you rent a film about a killer cat with a rabid mutant in its mouth?",1257206400,7,642,4.104

2789772,3,6301049179,"THE UNINVITED is about a mutant cat (known as ST-618) that escapes from a secret lab, after killing several scientists. The ferocious feline has what appears to be a little demon cat living in its mouth! When provoked, out comes Tiny Paws! This cat's dynamite! Meanwhile, a criminal zillionaire named Walter and his cronies (George Kennedy and Clu Gulager) are out on his yacht, murdering a blackmailer. ST-618 hitches a ride w/ a couple of hillbillies, eats their faces, and forces them off a cliff. Unsurprisingly, the killer kitty finds its way on to Walter's yacht, by acting cute and getting itself adopted by two beautiful, bikini-clad women. Once on board, after what feels like an eternity, the hell-cat sabotages the boat, and finally kills Clu Gulager. Next, it eats George Kennedy's foot off! What this movie lacks in action, thrills, and a solid storyline, it more than makes up for w/ pure, unbridled idiocy! The poor cat looks bored most of the time, the bikini babes have a combined IQ of about 8, and the rest of the characters are so annoying that I was hoping the yacht would just sink! Still, the sheer stupidity of it all makes for a semi-enjoyable viewing experience...",1373760000,8,1190,4.809756097560975
2789773,5,6301049179,"Take one cute sweet orange striped cat + laboratory morons + DNA lab experaments etc on said cat = 1 hitman in a fur coat. This starts in a lab where cages full of animals that are being experamented on, the sweet little orange kitty is taken out of his cage and injected with something, kitty manages to escape. Chased found and cornered by some hazmat type guys one shoots him with a tranq dart, guy trys to pick the sleeping cat up, and surprise another cat creature that looks like ( Church ) the resurrected cat in ( Pet Semetary ) comes out of his mouth kills goes back inside the orange cat, then escapes again, eek, ultra creepy

Along the way he meets people, like the nice guy who gave him water to drink, robber beats and robs the guy takes the truck and splits but doesn't know he has a passenger the hiding cat who kills him. Later on he ends up on a yacht with gangsters and it turns into the trip from hell. They find out the hard way that darling kitty is toxically poisonous when he bites someone they die. At the same time he is continuously mutating becoming stronger. The part that really creeps you out is that before killer kitty kills it comes out of and afterward goes back inside of the orange cats body through his mouth, eek, and when he leaves the the orange cats virtually lifeless until it's return. This is why I call him a ( HITMAN IN A FUR COAT ) muwhahaha, creepy movie",1371600000,4,1403,4.254681647940075
2789774,4,6301049179,"movie wasn't that bad for low budget. you could tell that some times the boat was a toy boat in the bath tub and the evil cat didn't look right. 2 cute girls in it some bad actors too. they went over board with the meowing effect the real cats mouth would be closed yet you hear it meow. id watch it again.i didn't understand the different colored cat at the end on the beach tho?at least watch it to see the guy dancing with his hands in his pocket, he definately didn't like dancing. it funny.",1365724800,,495,4.11340206185567
2789775,5,6301049179,"There really isn't too many killer cat movies out there, and the one's they do have, pretty much all suck. This is the best one of the few they have, so I have to give it five stars till something else new comes out. It is really a good film, but the special effects could have been better, even for 1989. Look at Friday The 13th Part 8: Jason takes Manhattan. Those came out around the same time, so why couldn't this have special effects close to that movie. Also, the box art shows a black cat killing. The cat is orange. A black cat would have suited the film better. I would love to have this film on Blu-ray is it would become available.",1312502400,8,643,4.152

When I watched it on VHS, I had a cat that looked just like that creepy feline in this movie. I wouldn't go near him for weeks after seeing this, freaked out that an alien or whatever that thing was, would come out of him and kill me! All and all its one of those cheap movies that you could watch for a laugh or scare if you have a cat that looks like this one.",1302307200,8,450,3.902173913043478
2789777,1,6301049179,"Uninvited (Greydon Clark, 1988)

While Greydon Clark was primarily a director of bad action films, that never stopped him from dabbling in every genre he could get his hands on. He made the cult sci-fi classic The Return, a blaxploitation flick, a godawful dance movie, and a western here and there. But the genre to which he kept returning was horror. He never quite got it right, but most of his attempts in the genre are at least stupidly watchable. The sole exception is Uninvited, the only Greydon Clark film that was ever direct-to-video. Given  how bad Clark's theatrical releases were, that ought to tell you something. I have now seen it, and I'm here to inform you that it doesn't tell you nearly enough.

Plot: a genetically-mutated cat harboring a carnivorous beast that looks sort of like a wet beaver (again, if you've seen Greydon Clark movies, you'll know that symbolism is very much intended) escapes the lab and finds its way onto the luxury yacht of a couple of very nasty men, Walter Graham (Airwolf's Alex Cord) and Mike Harvey (the great George Kennedy, in his nadir as an actor). There's a lot of other stuff with some young-and-beautifuls Graham convinces to be on the boat, which isn't his, but the main point is that this cat...beaver...thing that east people is on the boat with them and they're out in the middle of the sea. Did I mention engine failure (yes, caused by the cat)?

It's terrible, terrible, terrible. While I haven't seen all of Clark's output (I'm not that much of a masochist), this is by far the worst of his movies I've seen. It's ludicrous through and through. The creature effects are hysterical, the script doubly so. The most impressive thing about the movie is that Clark managed to somehow wheedle Cord, Kennedy, and Clu Galager, who has a brief role as a drunk pilot, to appear in this monstrosity. (It was also an early role for Rob Estes, who would go on to superstardom in Melrose Place five years later.) About the only thing I can say about this movie to halfway recommend it is that it's unintentionally hilarious. ",1291161600,4,2075,4.68956043956044

8182800,1,6301049179,"A group of scientists accidentally let a cute cuddly cat escape from their lab. What's so scary about a cute feline that one could possibly see on LOLcats?? Well this cat has a smaller badder mutant cat living inside it's mouth that comes out to kill people. (and sometimes grows to be the size of a biggish dog) Now don't you feel silly for asking. Anyways, after the dastardly pussy escapes we catch up with two gals dressed in the most atrocious '80's garb being invited to a mafioso's yacht party along with three other jackasses as well as cat whom shows up unexpectedly trapped in a box. Then the fun starts...

Well maybe 'fun' isn't the right word, the idea is somewhat original, but a Chinese film by the name of ""Xiong mao"" or translated as Evil Cat came out a year before this and is light years better then this one in every way, shape and form. This film has nothing going for it at all other then genre great George Kennedy in a supporting role (he's still under used). I suggest looking up the film ""Evil Cat"" and leaving this one in the litter box.",1516406400,,1064,4.373737373737374

8182802,4,6301049179,"Without a doubt, this is a BAD movie. Don't attempt to watch it unless you enjoy cheesy trash... and even then, be aware that it's VERY slow to get started. The crazed mutant cat doesn't really start causing problems until 48 minutes into the movie. Before that, the audience is bombarded with long, dull scenes of ""character development."" There's also an interminably long yacht party dance sequence (that's accompanied by the most generic soundtrack ever). In retrospect, I ultimately found the film's padding tolerable, but only because the mutant cat scenes were super funny. The puppet and puppetry work was amazing (in a horrendous way).",1505174400,,643,5.133333333333334
