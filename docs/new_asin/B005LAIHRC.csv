4720064,2,B005LAIHRC,"The popular stage musical ""Rock of Ages"" is not fantastic by any means, but it is quite entertaining and the actors do well enough in their respective roles (and can actually sing well).  When I heard the musical was being adapted to the big screen I decided to check the movie out.  There have been terrific adaptations (""Chicago"") and a few good ones (""Rent"", ""The Phantom of the Opera"").  However ""Rock of Ages"" does not fall into either category.

One of the appealing points of the musical is that it does not take itself very seriously.  The problem with the film adaptation is it does take itself seriously and that takes away from the enjoyment of the film.  It in fact kills the enjoyment pretty much on its own.

In adaptations we inevitably see changes made from the source material.  A great example of that is the 1978 film adaptation of ""Grease"" which could not be more different from the musical.  However changes can work as they did with ""Grease"".  Not so much with ""Rock of Ages"".  A few characters who I enjoyed in the musical are not featured in the movie and are replaced by formulaic cliches that could not be more of a contrivance if you tried.  The villain of the musical is a German construction tycoon who is hell bent on tearing down The Burbon Room and it's surroundings for a new development much to the disdain of the tycoon's son.  In the movie these characters are removed and replaced by the Mayor of Hollywood (Bryan Cranston) and his nutcase wife (Academy Award winner Catherine Zeta-Jones.).  Both of these characters are just plan dull and loaded with formulaic plot devices (The husband is unfaithful.  The wife has a secret for her anger and hatred of ""The Devil's Music"".  Give me a break.).  The main characters of Sherrie and Diego have no chemistry whatsoever.  Alec Baldwin tries his best as Burbon Room owner Dennis Dupree, but I would not have cast him.  Speaking of cliches, Paul Giamatti's character of the manager who cares nothing about his clients and just cares about himself and money is something we have all seen many times over.

This review would not be complete without mentioning Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx.  The character had a very small part in the stage musical.  Here he is the center of the entire movie.  I wish the writers stuck with the musical's treatment of the character.  In the play Jaxx is a slimeball who's antics finally catch up with him in the end (and rightfully so).  In the movie he is played as a poor misguided soul who does not mean to be a dirtbag, he just turned out that way because of his evil manager.  I think this was done because we have to make poster boy Tom Cruise look good so the ladies will flock to see the movie.  This is too bad because Cruise has shown he can play the bad guy and play the part well as he did in 2004's ""Collateral"" (Which earned him his third Oscar nomination.)  Also, I would love to know why he whispers all his dialogue.  In all fairness he does a desent job of singing the only Bon Jovi song I can tolerate ""Wanted Dead or Alive.""

I would recommend you skip this movie and catch the musical instead.  The musical is not perfect by any means but it's a lot better than this misfire.",1340150400,2,3205,4.4835924006908465
4720065,5,B005LAIHRC,"I love the music of the 80's,  I love this movie.  Couldn't take my eyes off Tom Cruise.  Gotta own it.",1339977600,4,103,3.8095238095238093
4720066,5,B005LAIHRC,"such an amazing movie, you'll be singing the songs days after seeing it. i started singing and dancing, it was like being at a rock concert(:",1339977600,3,141,4.461538461538462
4720067,3,B005LAIHRC,"There seemed to be a certain amount of gloating in some of today's entertainment headlines as they branded Tom Cruise's latest movie a bomb.  Of course, that seems to be the way the media (and by extension, the public) handles our idols: build them up to impossible heights and then pull the rug out from under them and watch them fall.  It's a vicious game, but one that's been played out for as long as there have been celebrities, chroniclers, and an adoring public to worship both.

That being said, ""Rock of Ages"", which opened on Friday, is far from being Tom Cruise's best movie, or even a very good movie, for that matter.  It's not even really a ""Tom Cruise"" movie, although his character is one of several whose lives revolve around a glitzy rock nightclub on the Sunset Strip in the 1980's.  But, for all its shortcomings, what ""Rock of Ages"" manages to be is highly entertaining, in a campy, big hair, over-the-top sort of way, kind of like the illegitimate offspring of ""Hairspray"" and ""This Is Spinal Tap"" by way of Broadway (where it actually played).  Set against a soundtrack of Journey, Def Leppard, Poison, and a host of other 80's bands, ""Rock of Ages"" attempts to tell the story of Sherrie, an Oklahoma girl who heads to L.A. to find a new life.  Stepping off the bus with $17 in her purse, Sherrie meets a bar back named Drew, who works at the famous Bourbon nightclub and aspires to be a rock god like his idol, Stacee Jaxx.  After a thief steals Sherrie's belongings (including her record collection), Drew manages to get her a job at the Bourbon, ruled by aging hippie, Dennis Dupree, and his emcee/right arm, Lonny.  Dennis and Lonny have their own problems with the mayor  and his ultra-conservative wife who are trying to close the club for unpaid taxes, but soon they see salvation when no less than Stacee Jaxx, himself, agrees to perform at the club for free!

There's a slight love story between Sherrie and Drew but it gets lost in the big time rutting of Stacee Jax and the rock and roll crowd hanging around the club; and soon enough, there's a conflict that drives our young lovers apart, but do we care?  Of course not!  It's too much fun watching Tom Cruise puff out his chest and suck in his gut while strutting around uttering profound banalities in the role of rock god, Stacee Jaxx.  Cruise has often been a good actor in films and, at times, he's even great.  But, here he is guzzling booze, hamming it up in leather chaps and a glittery jockstrap, a cowboy hat and bandana, and having a grand old time, in much the same way that William Shatner was able to do when he successfully redeemed his career as Denny Crane in television's ""Boston Legal"".  Cruise is a hoot, and the screen is electric when he's on it.  He evens sounds like a rock star during his big numbers.

Also a lot of fun to watch is Alec Baldwin, as the Bourbon's proprietor, Dennis, a seen-it-all, heard-it-all type who looks like a sausage with long hair stuffed into his laid back rocker/hippie attire.  Ditto for comedian Russell Banks, who plays Lonny with a certain degree of panache.  The young lovers--""Dancing With the Stars"" Julianne Hough and newcomer Diego Boneta--do their best but are completely overshadowed by performances of the big-name cast.  That their romance is so blandly portrayed doesn't help matters, nor does the fact that Julianne Hough's voice is too wispy to belt out the heavier numbers required of her.  I was also rather disappointed in Catherine Zeta Jones, too seldom seen onscreen these days since her dynamic performance more than ten years ago in ""Chicago"".  Zeta Jones is an accomplished comedienne, as well as a decent singer and dancer, but she really seemed sort of wasted in the role of the mayor's holier-than-thou wife.  Bryan Cranston, Mary J. Blige and Malin Akerman do very well in smaller roles that are crucial to the script, and Paul Giamatti is realistically oozy as an unscrupulous band manager.  And just for good measure, there's a pet ape--I'm not sure what kind--who is genuinely amusing.

If you weren't a fan of the Big Hair Bands of the `80's chances are you're probably not going to much like ""Rock of Ages"".  It's slight, silly, affectionate, overlong, often funny, excessive, sexy, and big-budgeted, a fun, if forgettable, tribute to an over-the-top era.",1339891200,22,4328,4.682959048877146
4720068,5,B005LAIHRC,"This is a farce and should be viewed as it is. The acting is exaggerated and thet helped make it a great comedy. Many of the scenes were so funny the people in the theater laughed out loud. The singing was great and I have never liked that type of music. In fact, I ordered the audio CD. Catherine Zeta Jones, Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand  are wonderful as comedians. When I left the theater, everyone leaving with me had a smile on their face. I would see it again.",1339891200,6,467,4.188888888888889
4720069,4,B005LAIHRC,"Whether you're watching television's ""Glee"" or ""Rock of Ages"" where you have actors cover hit songs, there will be controversy.  This film will likely be no exception.  Many will like the fresh delivery.  Others will want to just stick with the original.  Based on the popular Broadway show, ""ROA"" ups the star power and the production value in this excellent rendition.  The flimsy premise isn't anything new.  A young wannabe singer (Julianne Hough, ""Footloose"") from Tulsa heads to Hollywood in 1987.  She meets up with an equally attractive bar-back (Diego Boneta, ""Mean Girls 2"") who's also a wannabe front-man in a rock band.  They make nice, make out and fall in love complete with appropriate falling-in-love scenes including the requisite visit to the giant HOLLYWOOD sign.

Put all that aside.  What's fun is the secondary performances of a large catalog of 80's ""big hair"" bands including Journey, Bon Jovi, Guns `n Roses, Styx, Twisted Sister, Poison and many others.  Not only are these well done, they are performed by some unlikely actors including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Russell Brand, Malin Akerman, Alec Baldwin and most importantly Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx.  They are all terrific and yes they can sing.

One of my favorite songs and scenes is when Sherri (Hough) quits her job at the famous Bourbon Club and must take a job at an upscale strip club headed by a sympathetic Mary J. Blige.  They harmonize on the great Quarterflash song, ""Harden My Heart.""  The real star here however is Cruise as Jaxx, certainly a take on Axl Rose and others.  If you thought you saw something special when Cruise played profane producer Les Grossman in ""Tropic Thunder,"" wait `til you see his perpetually stoned Jaxx.  And make no mistake, he's for real and can deliver a song.  I don't know if the Academy has the ability to remember back to June, but Cruise's supporting performance is worth a nod.  The movie's a blast.",1339891200,3,1926,4.888888888888889
4720070,5,B005LAIHRC,"""Rock Of Ages"" is great! This is how the story goes: Set in 1987 Los Angeles, Drew and Sherrie are two young people chasing their dreams in the big city. When they meet, it's love at first sight, though their romance will face a series of challenges.

The cast led by Julianne Hough (as Sherrie), Diego Boneta (as Drew), Tom Cruise (as Stacee Jaxx), Alec Baldwin (as Dennis Dupree), Russell Brand (as Lonny), Catherine Zeta-Jones (as Patricia Whitmore), Paul Giamatti (as Paul Gill), Bryan Cranston (as Mike Whitmore), Malin Akerman (as Constance Sack) & Mary J. Blige (as Justice) is great. The directing by Adam Shankman (who also produced) is great. The screenplay (based on the musical book by Chris D'Arienzo) by D'Arienzo, Justin Theroux & Allan Loeb is great.

The original score by Adam Anders & Peter Astrom is great. The music supervised by Matthew Rush Sullivan is great. The cinematography by Bojan Bazelli is great. The film editing by Emma E. Hickox is great. The casting by Juel Bestrop & Seth Yanklewitz is great. The production design by Jon Hutman is great. The set decoration by K.C. Fox is great. The costume design by Rita Ryack is great. The set dressing by Stephen P. Durante, Melissa Pamela Jones, Emilio Saez & Daniel Williams is great. The assistant art direction by Rosa Palomo is great.

This is a great adaptation (musical) of a Broadway musical. This is a fun, entertaining and well-made film that has terrific songs that are well-sung by the cast. This is also a great film for the summer season. This is another musical hit from the director of 2007's ""Hairspray"". Also, a great return to musicals for Catherine Zeta-Jones as well, since her Oscar-winning performance in 2002's Oscar-winner Best Picture ""Chicago"".",1339804800,2,1746,4.891891891891892
4720071,5,B005LAIHRC,"MOVIE REVIEW #38: "" Rock of Ages ""

The first thing I want to say is that this film is about the Music of the 80's! - Having been a young `whipper-snapper' at the time - what surprised me most about this film - was that it was FUNNY!. Laugh out loud funny. That alone, seems to take the entire audience I was with by surprise. So-much-so, that they applauded and laughed throughout the film out loud. Like me!

Hearing these songs done by Tom Cruise (Mission Impossible, Top Gun) singing Bon Jovi's classic ""Wanted Dead or Alive,"" (YES TOM SINGS AND VERY WELL TOO!) to Def Leppard's hit ""Pour Some Sugar On Me,"" and Guns `N Roses anthem ""Paradise City."" Along with Cruise then doing duets with Malin Akerman (The Proposal, Watchmen) on Foreigner's power ballad, ""I Want To Know What Love Is,"" and shares the mic with Julianne Hough (Footloose-2011, Burlesque) on The Scorpions' ""Rock You Like A Hurricane."" ...was a cinematic shock to me. As well as a hysterically performed, yet really heartfelt delivery, duet of my fav REO Speedwagon song  ""I Can't Fight This Feeling"" between charismatic Alec Baldwin (30 Rock, Beetlejuice) and  an off-the-wall Russell Brand (Arthur, Get Him To The Greek). (SPOILER: Yes, the song title tells it all!)

Based on the Broadway play - which premiered at the King King club in Hollywood, CA in 2005 transferred to the Vanguard theatre in Los Angeles, CA and finally went to the Broadway stage in 2009 - It was written by Justin Theroux (Iron Man 2, Tropic Thunder), Chris DArienzo (Hot, Barry Monday) and Allan Loeb (21, Just Go With It)  it tells the story of small town girl from Ohio,  Sherrie - played electrically and brilliantly by Julianne Hough and the L.A. city boy Drew, again played brilliantly by Diego Bonita (Mean Girls 2, 90210) who meet on the Sunset Strip while pursuing their Hollywood dreams. Their rock 'n' roll romance is told through other heart-pounding hits of Def Leppard, Joan Jett, Journey,  Night Ranger, Pat Benatar, Steve Perry, Twisted Sister, Poison and Whitesnake .

Director Adam Shankman (Hairspray, Bedtime Stories) did his best to make you tap your feet, sing along and - again - make you laugh out loud. He threaded the simple story using the dynamics of the performances and the clever `mashed' songs of the 80's. He definatle got the looks and hair styles of the time and even slams the popular `boy bands' of the time. Hysterically! From scene #1 - It's got dance, choreography and bright colors...even an adjusted LA Skyline for the times!

Tom Cruise, as Stacee Jaxx, gives another amazingly eclectic, strange, exotic (and sometime erotically suggestive) and funny performance. And I never knew he could sing. Amazing voice - yes it is him - and great musical `chops' to carry the film. Bravo Tom!

Another stand-out performance was Cathrine Zeta-Jone (Chicago, The Terminal) as the religious wife of the Mayor of Los Angeles on vengeful (and personal) vendetta again Tom Cruise character the rock star himself, Stacee Jaxx! She is spicy, passionate with dance and funny and boy she can sing her version of Pat Benatar's most popular hit ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"". Bravisimo Cathrine!

Also some other standout performances came from Paul Giamatti (Sideways, Saving Private Ryan) as the crummy musical agent, singer-songwriter Mary J Blige (Entourage, Ghost Whisperer) as the club manager who takes Sherrie under her wing and Malin Ackerman (The Hearbreak Kid, Catch .44) as the confused Rolling Stone Magazine Reporter. Included are hidden cameos of REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin and Debbie Gibson themselves!

My only concern is that if you were not familiar with these great songs of the 80's...will the newer generations of audiences get it? I hope so. I'm sure they will get the humor, but like me, will they be singing along out loud with the rest of the crowd - like first screenings audience I saw it with who remembers the time - way back when `Music Had Messages'?  (Kinda' of like my experience at the theatre with the film version of Mamma Mia...you couldn't help but sing along - out loud to the hits of ABBA!) This was a fun and - most importantly - funnier than I ever expected! Another good fun family (PG-13 for provocativeness)  film that tells its entire simple story - through its music! GO see it!",1339804800,82,4298,4.804878048780488

Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, and Russel Brand were very unforgettable in this movie. The soundtrack is amazing and I need to see it on Broadway pronto!",1339545600,18,294,4.462962962962963
4720073,4,B005LAIHRC,"I saw ""Rock of Ages"" in a sneak preview tonight, and was pleasantly surprised by the overall experience.  I had not seen the stage production, but I've seen some other stage musicals converted to movies, and have been generally disappointed, sometimes appalled (I'm looking at you, ""Mama Mia!"")

Set in 1987, the general plot involves a pair of newcomers to Hollywood, trying to become rock stars, but finding the closest they can get is working in the hottest rock & roll club on the Hollywood Strip.  From here, the story expands to include the owners of the club, a politician and his wife who are fighting the corrupting influence of rock music, and the biggest rock god on the planet, Stacee Jaxx, played by Tom Cruise.

The movie starts out pretty cheesy, and the first few numbers garnered some giggles from the crowd, but when Tom Cruise arrives, he kicks the entire show into high gear.  Say what you will about him off screen, the man is a star onscreen, and does a phenomenal job in this role.

The music was pretty solid, with the rock songs of the 80s performed by the actors.  In stark contrast to Mama Mia!, the songs here have been studio produced, and sound great, avoiding the bad karaoke effect such performances often have.  For the most part, the actors are not known for singing (who knew Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin could sing?  OK so maybe Baldwin wasn't the strongest singer, but still decent for his role...)  Julianne Hough was likeable enough as the female lead, but surprisingly (considering a music career), her singing wasn't as good as some others.

The movie got progressively better, and was quite funny.  But Tom Cruise carries this musical, and did so not only with very solid acting, but a shockingly decent rock and roll voice.  Without him, this would have been an unremarkable show.  With him, it is a fun movie that had people in the audience singing along with the film.",1339027200,138,1912,4.66865671641791
4720214,4,B005LAIHRC,"Let's make this simple. It's a musical. It's a collection of awesome 80's tunes. The actors are the singers.  It's tongue-in-cheek fun. Anyone who remembers the 80's or lived in or near that life-style might consider it...documentary.  The baboon ""Hey Man"" is worth the watch.  Especially Paul Giamatti's fear of the in-uniform monkey and for that matter, the interaction between him and Cruise's character. So for some funny lines, entertaining tunes, sex, rock 'n' roll (sans drugs) make it a fun romp. Be mindful. It's rated R and not for little kids.  So whether you sit and watch it or have it on in the background, enjoy the gratifying dose of degenerate ambiance.",1525651200,,670,4.902654867256637

What's with all the sticking their tongues into each other's ears and the ridiculous makeout scenes etc?  They could have made those scenes funny without being silly or even downright gross at times.  The movie was more of a parody of the 80s than a tribute, which perhaps was their whole point.  If they could do away with all that cheap humor and make it more about the story and the times, it would have been a much better movie.  I would also have preferred more of Tom Cruise in the movie.  He's half the reason I watched it in the first place, and he wasn't even in most of the movie.  I wish they had delved more into his character.",1506470400,,924,4.345029239766082

4720381,2,B005LAIHRC,"This movie is down right horrible. This is coming from a fan of the original Broadway show (which I saw twice). When I first heard this movie was coming out. I was excited don't get me wrong. But once I saw it. I was like, what is this? It's no where close to the original stage show's plot. And they leave out my top 2 favorite characters from the original musical. Some of the actors singing was bad. But the ones I did like and approved of were Russell Brand, Mary J. Blige, and Julianne Hough. I thought they did an excellent job. Especially Mary J. Blige.

But I will admit also that there was one change in the movie from the original stage show I liked. And that was the Stacee Jaxx's movie ending. I liked better than the Broadway version.

The other side that I liked from this movie. Was the cameos I was seeing from people in the original show. Constantine Maroulis (who is a personal favorite of mine) and Joel Hoekstra (again, another personal favorite), David Gibbs, and the producers of the original show Matt Weaver and Barry Habib. As well as rockstars Sebastain Bach, and Kevin Cronin. Just only for those few seconds they were in made me so happy and worth the $10 to see this in theaters. I kind of wish other members of the original show (like Amy Spanger, Wesley Taylor, or Mitchell Jarvis would've made a cameo.",1505088000,,1334,4.41869918699187

4721216,4,B005LAIHRC,"This movie is such a drastic departure from the Broadway musical that I honestly don't know why they didn't just make an entirely new movie about the 80's Strip era.  Aside from some of the same songs and some of the same characters, and a few similarities to the story line, this is nothing like the play.  Key characters were completely changed or taken out all together.  Plots were altered.  The ""big bad"" that our heroes were fighting was completely different.  The ending wasn't even the same.  Seriously, this movie has barely anything to do with the original play.

4721283,4,B005LAIHRC,"I have seen this movie a number of times and have enjoyed it. I love 80's music and I enjoy musicals so it was a given that I would like the movie even if it was cheesy - which it is. I will say this though before I go on. I rented the movie on Amazon after seeing it five or six times over the course of a few years and realized that I had been watching the extended version with some scenes cut out of the actual cinema release. The movie I saw tonight on Amazon was the cinema release and was missing those cut scenes and BOY did I miss them. One of the best scenes is completely cut out and that is when Tom Cruise's Stacee Jaxx goes into a bar where Julianne Hough's Sherrie is working and they sing ""Rock me Like a Hurricane"" together in the VIP room of the club. It's a great song and the scene is excellent. And you won't see it unless you see the extended or unedited version. It is on YouTube though. A few other scenes are missing as well but don't take much away from the final cut.

Having said that, this movie is a dramady. It tries to be funny and it works some of the time and it tries to be poignant and it works some of the time. The music is amazing for anyone who likes 80's rock songs and all the actors used their own voices for their songs including the star of the movie, Tom Cruise, who has a great voice and played the aging, nearly washed up rock star perfectly. I never thought I would believe that Tom Cruise was a drunken, long haired, 80's rock god but I did while I was watching this movie. He is hardly recognizable with his long hair and tattooed body and he has the entitled, out of control rock star shtick down pat. I don't think anyone could have done a better job. He is the best actor AND singer in the movie.

The other stars are all fine. Casting could have been better for some characters but they all add flavor to the movie. The movie is essentially a love story as well as an ode to rock and roll. The dialog is weak but the music makes up for it. Lots of well known stars are in this and all sing, some of whom do not sing at all in general and probably shouldn't again. Hello, I'm talking to you,. Russell Brand!

If you are looking for a serious film, this isn't it. If you're looking for a film that has songs sung in perfect tune by every cast member, this isn't it. But if you like a little cheese with your 80's rock, this movie is good fun. I really enjoy watching it. It goes from serious and touching to downright silly in a heartbeat but it's one of those films that just has to be watched with an open mind and enjoyed for the memories and the music.

The storylines are all over the place with many, many little subplots which make it interesting at every turn. If you can, try to catch the deleted ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" scene on YouTube or on the extended release because it's one of the better scenes in the movie, in my opinion. I suspect it didn't make the cut because it depicted the female lead, Sherrie, as not quite as innocent as she seemed and they wanted to keep her wide eyed and wholesome.

Don't blink during the last quarter of the film or you will miss seeing some very recognizable 80's rock stars in the crowd where the rock lovers and the naysayers clash and sing a mash up. Naturally they are on the side of the rock lovers..

The movie, made in 2012., isn't dated at all because it is set in 1987 so it will always be relevant as an era movie. Give it a chance. It grows on you. That's why I ended up watching it again tonight!",1482796800,4,3514,4.085507246376811

4721593,3,B005LAIHRC,"It took a while to get over the high-school-play-production movie intro, and people were laughing during serious scenes in the theatre when I first saw this movie. But I thoroughly enjoyed the song choices, and thought the actors did a good job with what they were given. It was fun re-watching a shirtless Tom Cruise swagger onto the screen, and I enjoyed learning that he sung his own numbers. I also found myself rooting for the nightclub owners, in part thanks to Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand's performances.

The things that underwhelmed were fake looking sets, main characters I struggled to root for, an okay plot, and a general lack of dance choreography--with the exception of Catherine Zeta Jone's number. Film can and should go above and beyond the limitations of theatre. A lot of Rock of Ages felt like watching a Broadway show without the fun of actually being in the audience. There was little to drive the plot, or any of the characters, forward in a meaningful way. And for people who say, ""It's just entertainment"": I think film musicals can entertain by being  ""good"" movies with exciting stories and characters (like Chicago for example).

Ultimately, Rock of Ages felt like ""Glee"" for grownups, without the heart and soul of the television series.",1472774400,,1270,4.897674418604651

Music of this era was dismal and mindless, but ""Journey"" salvaged it as one of the best bands of all time.  And what in the heck was Tom Cruise doing by being a part of this abomination?  Maybe to recapture his youth.  It was, by far, in my opinion, host worst performance ever.  Avoid this film.  Trust me...avoid this film.",1457913600,2,564,4.5049504950495045

4723628,1,B005LAIHRC,"Good god was this the one fly-covered compost heap of pig dung.  It's ironic as to how they went so far as to point out the unquestionable stereotypes that all the characters are on the front cover.  That alone is one self-depreciating move.  But that's what they are.  Tom Cruise plays a frequently drugged up, drunk, and oversexed washed up rock star attempting to make a comeback if only he can do so without being too wasted.  Sexy Julianne Hough is your stereotypical and overused Cinderella type smalltown chick who wishes to find fortune and fame in the big city, some actor named Diego Boneta plays her princely love interest, sexy Watchmen star Malin Akerman plays the reporter woman who interviews Tom Cruise's chraracter, who may or may not have good intentions, Alec Baldwin is some ridiculous club owner that tries to act younger than he is, Paul Giamatti plays a sleazy, control freak, money grubbing manager, beautiful soul singer Mary J. Blige plays some strip club owner that has a strong spirit, Russell Brand is some rock enthusiast who works along side Alec Baldwin, sexy Catherine Zeta-Jones plays an annoying rock music hating activist, and Bryan Cranston plays her polititian husband who's secretly having an S&M affair with some woman behind her back.  As for Hey Man the babboon, well he's just simply the only star in this movie who can act.  Ha! Famous actors outdone by a monkey.  That's pretty sad.

Even after all the horror stories that I have heard about how atrocious this movie was, I figured that as I grew up in the 80's and love the 80's very much, so I still soldiered on and watched it and damn was that a big mistake.

Other than the unbearably wooden stereotypes that every character is in this movie, there's also the painful disappointment I faced with the sad fact that there are absolutely no original songs of any kind in the soundtrack.  Every song in this soundtrack is a song that was famous in the 80's.  All except for ""More Than Words"" by Extreme which came out in 1991 and ergo didn't come out until 4 years after when this movie takes place.  Don't get me wrong the soundtrack features some great songs,  I don't like them all, but most of them, but, not only weren't there any original songs to look forward to, but not one of these songs had a damn thing to do with anything that was going in in the scenes.  Also, the actors were singing them very badly.  Give me a break, this just makes for some shamefully lazy film making on their part!  The dancing was also atrocious.  I especially hate that scene where Catherine Zeta-Jones is in a church with her other rock music hating activists, singing Pat Benatar's ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" while doing dreadfully bad renditions of Michael Jackson's dance moves, while sliding on the church benches doing the Billy Idol pose. WTF?!!!! It was also corny when Tom Cruise is seducing sexy Malin Akerman's reporter character while singing ""I Wanna Know What Love Is"" while she's attempting to sing with him while their french kissing.  What a painfully bad scene that truly was!  I also hated how in some scenes there would be one of the characters taking credit for having written one of the songs.  They weren't even playing the musicians that were involved in the real life bands.

No one puts in a good performance in this movie at all.  Tom Cruise in particular was dull and pretty much phoned it in.  It's a shame because most of the cast are some very talented people.  A side note: What kind of freakazoid rock star or otherwise would have a babboon for a pet, let alone give it a gun to shoot at people with.

In closing this was without a doubt hands down the worst movie I saw in 2012, the characters were all stock and dull, there wasn't much in the way of 80's references, like people at the arcade, music videos, MTV, VH-1, 80's expressions, New Wavers, Punkers, or Goths, Nintendo, Sega, Atari, VCR's, VHS's, videostores, or even 80's movies or tv shows.  All of those things(even if only shown briefly) would've made this movie much more interesting.  Overall, this is the most lazily made pile of crap and carries no charm with it, nor original songs, no real humor, and lots of predictability.  Forget about the title Rock of Ages, they should've changed the title to a more apt one, Crock of Ages. LOL!  In terms of a retro 80's movie that's actually enjoyable, this just can't hold a candle to The Wedding Singer.",1440806400,,4436,4.606870229007634

4723942,4,B005LAIHRC,"The late Roger Ebert liked to believe that it's not what plot you choose for your movie, it's what you do with it. Even if the story is as old as cinema itself the movie can still be good. That really applies to ROCK OF AGES. To be honest, there isn't anything particularly original as far as story is concerned. But this movie has some really amazing performances by a group of big-time Hollywood stars: Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Paul Giavanni, and Catherine Zeta Jones. Tom Cruise is especially good as the egotistical rock god Stacie Jaxx. Alec Baldwin proves that he is still a good actor as he was 20 years ago, playing the owner of the Bourbon Room club, while Russel Brand plays his business partner.

But the high point of this movie is the music. I grew up with these songs and I still love them. I recognized music by Quiet Riot, Pat Benatar, Bon Jovi, Poison, Guns-N-Roses, Journey, Def Leppard, Starship, and Twisted Sister. These bands had made some really AWESOME songs. And in this movie the musical scenes are 100% real. All the actors do their own singing, and are astonishing at how well they sing it. Tom Cruise had to take singing lessons and they had really paid off. And on top of that, Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin perform a song together that will come as a surprise to anybody, including themselves. Diego Boneta and Julianne Hough are also amazing in their musical performances. It comes as no surprise that Boneta is a Latin pop star, and Hough is a professional country singer.

Rock-n-roll has not been the same these days. The only band that I actually have listened to lately is Rammstein, and they only go back as far as 1998. But it was refreshing to see this film and to hear such talented actors actually performing these songs; most of the time as good as the original.",1433894400,6,1822,4.551829268292683

Its 1987 on the Sunset Strip. A small-town girl meets a city boy and they both pursue their Hollywood dreams. Based on the mega-hit stage musical.

What did I think?

Im a musical lover whos seen Rock of Ages on stage twice. My plus-one was a musical theatre cynic, whose only exposure to RoA was through the flicks publicity trail. But we both love the glam-rock 80s music scene and came to the same conclusion: the movie hit some marks and missed others.

It awkwardly straddles the line between comedy and drama, with some numbers that had me rocking out of my seat, and some that left me wanting more. But Tom Cruise, as rocker Stacee Jaxx, was a revelation. And I generally dislike Cruise, so thats saying something.

It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either. It was movie limbo. But its certainly not the stage show.",1431648000,,842,4.549668874172186

I watched this film for two reasons: 1) the cast was more than enticing.  Alec Baldwin and Tom Cruise in a musical?  How can you not watch it?

And 2) I love 1980's rock!  Def Leppard, Poison, Guns n Roses, etc.... so many songs were featured, and it was fun to see how these were mixed and matched, even in some songs simultaneously as duets, to propel and support the plot.

Was the story any good?  Nah.  Predictable.  It's a musical, so expect love happily ever after, redemption, success, and a bit of humor and irony.

I have not seen the stage production, but would love to!",1420934400,,610,4.366071428571429

That doesn't mean I actively disliked it.  Clearly a Tom Cruise indulgence on rock star dreams, I kept watching it, saying ""this movie is terrible"" but doing it laughing, so it stayed on all the way through.

I don't know how to feel about this movie.  Probably better if you went to concerts in the 80s and are having a major mid life crisis.  lol ;)

Julianne Hough, Russell Brand, Paul Giamatti, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mary J.

The 80's were the glory days of rock and metal music full of decadence, sin, and lust. This film is clearly a guilty pleasure with fun, laughs, sexy scenes, and enough partying to make you pass out!

4725843,4,B005LAIHRC,"This was very different from musicals I typically watch.  Although quite a bit raunchier than I tend to like, the music was great.  Julianne's and Tom's ... along with other supporting stars....performances were great!  I really did enjoy it when all was said and one. Did I mention, I LOVED the music!!!  This was my first step before seeing the show in Vegas...can't wait to see it live (Like I did Jersey Boys....saw twice and will see it again ...absolutely loved this one).",1412553600,,478,4.72289156626506
4725844,5,B005LAIHRC,"WOW!!!! This movie blew me away!!!! My only disappointment was that it took me so long to buy it!! I SHOULD have been enjoying this way before now!!! I was really surprised that a few of the actors (Tom & Alec) could actually sing!!! I immensely enjoyed Rock of Ages & will enjoy watching it repeatedly!!!!! And, the songs were AWESOME, I absolutely love each & every song in the movie!!!!!!",1412467200,,391,4.52112676056338

4725849,5,B005LAIHRC,Had a blast watching this movie.  We invited a group of friends and projected it in the back yard.  We ended up singing and dancing through the whole movie along with the cast.  Fun movie to watch in group setting.,1411430400,,214,4.3
4725850,3,B005LAIHRC,"Rock of Ages is a musical comedy that is an adaptation of the rock jukebox Broadway musical. It tells the story of  small town girl Sherrie and city boy Drew, who meet on the Sunset Strip while pursuing their Hollywood dreams. Their rock 'n' roll romance is told through the heart-pounding hits of many 80's music hits. While it may not have a plot going on,the music is obviously the star in this film. Whenever the characters are going through something, we get to see hear songs that provides great entertainment that viewers  will surely enjoy. No question that its ensemble cast made the film not to make a masterpiece but to have a great time reliving the music.",1411344000,,668,4.605042016806722

4726091,4,B005LAIHRC,Good movie.  Has good songs from the 70's or 80's.  People who grew up in that time will appreciate the movie.  Plot not that intriguing.  Boy meets girl.  Both meet aging rock star.  Misunderstanding leads to boy and girl separating.  Rock star and boy and girl all reconcile and live happily ever after.,1409875200,,305,4.6415094339622645

4726093,5,B005LAIHRC,I love 80s music and I like how the actors sing the songs in a fun and comical way. But the story line of the movie sucked balls! Even though having your balls sucked feels amazing. The story lined sucked in a none pleasurable way. The songs and because I love the 80s is the only reason why I bought the movie. Also Catherine Zeta Jones I mean just look at her do I need any other reason?,1409875200,,389,4.0

4726099,5,B005LAIHRC,"This is a great movie. I love all of the songs and the way they mesh some of them together. The actors are very talented with their voices. I can just imagine the 80's like this. I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good night time ""after the kids are in bed and having a glass of wine"" movie.",1409270400,,310,3.9365079365079363
4726160,2,B005LAIHRC,"There are movies that don't take themselves seriously, that know they are bad and become hilarious cult classics by embracing the fact . This is not one of those movies. Possibly the worst musical I've ever seen. The plot and dialogue are minimal - just enough to justify cramming as many 80's songs together as possible. This probably works on stage, where the choreography can be emphasized. The movie, however, chops up the dance numbers with frantic cuts to different camera angles and then spends WAY too much time on the nonexistent plot in between the songs. It probably deserves 1 star, but the occasional  laugh out loud one-liners earned it an extra star.",1409097600,,665,4.833333333333333

I was expecting Black Sabbath, Guns N Roses, etc.  Instead it was a bunch of pop rock.  I could have even swallowed a few pop rock songs but there was almost no good music in this movie.  On top of that Tom Cruise ruined a perfectly good character as usual.

I thought Tom Cruise did a good job, and I liked his simian sidekick. All in all, it was mindless fun and the music was good. I will never watch it again, but I'm glad I saw it this one time.

It was made to make you sing the songs and enjoy the setting from the 80s.  I am giving it five stars for the fun I had watching it.  Sometimes you need to watch a movie just for fun.  I thought the actors did a good job in this movie.  I saw some reviews that stated that Tom Cruise was not a good person to be in this movie.  I disagree.  He did a good job on this one.  He reminded me of some of the musicians I saw during the 80s on MTV and music awards shows.,1406332800,,580,3.727272727272727

4726658,5,B005LAIHRC,"When my husband, teenage daughter and I went to see Rock of Ages at the theater, we really didn't know anything about it. First of all, we had no idea it was a musical. When Julianne Hough's character broke out in song on the bus at the beginning of the movie, and then the other passengers joined in, we looked at each other and laughed. We each thought we had just wasted our money on a stupid movie. Boy were we wrong! We LOVE Rock of Ages! When it was released on DVD, I bought it right away for my daughter for her birthday, along with the soundtrack on CD. She was thrilled! Now, my husband and I get a kick out of listening her sing along to the rock songs we grew up with.

If you are a fan of Foreigner, Journey, Bon Jovi, Poison, Def Leppard, Scorpions, Quit Riot, and a host of other 80s rock bands, you will love this movie.",1402358400,5,836,4.097560975609756

That said, the chemistry between Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand was great. Tom Cruise was truly a surprise as Stacy Jaxx. Catherine Zeta Jones was fun as the long-repressed rocker chick married to a conservative politician, Paul Giamatti was great as the creepy dishonest agent and you can't forget Hey Man who made the movie a lot more fun. I don't know if it was Julianne Hough or Diego Boneta but I never bought the relationship - had that relationship worked, the movie bolstered by the music and Tom Cruise and his surprising ability to channel Stacy Jaxx would have been awesome.",1400976000,,691,4.7190082644628095

4726944,4,B005LAIHRC,"This movie is less about the lip syncing and more about the comedic value of watching some of you favorite stars pretend to be rock stars.  They are quite interesting and had me laughing quite a bit.  I felt like Julianne Hough was far too talented to be half naked most of the movie.  I feel like that was rather disrespectful toward her but if that's what she wanted to do then so be it.  She's hot.  On the other end of the spectrum it was hilarious to see Catherine Zeta Jones in a full suit rocking out and dancing to music, haha.  Also, Tom Cruise deserves some praise for some of those moves he was able to pull off.  I'd be scared to even try to attempt some of that, lol.  It's a good movie as long as you aren't after a decent script.  It's all about watching your favorite stars going wild.",1397260800,,801,4.14935064935065

4727103,5,B005LAIHRC,"I can't help but love this movie! As cheesy as it may be I really enjoyed it enough to purchase it so I can watch again and again. I saw the stage show a long time before the movie came out and love that too, but I really like the way they did the movie version better. It made Stacee Jax a more likeable character, and if you're going to have Tom Cruise play him then that pretty much is essential.
The theatrical release cut out a few scenes that were directly used from the stage play so I waited to get the extended edition so I could have those scenes back in the movie. Most of the things that were cut were Julianne Hough's dance numbers, which is odd because she is a better dancer than a singer. I guess the dancing was a little too racy for test audiences so they pulled it but I thought they were fun to watch and added more layers.
All in all its alot of fun, takes you back to big hair bands and spandex, and how can you not get reminiscent when you see Tower Records!
Great performance by Tom Cruise too, I love when he takes on a role that pushes the boundaries of him just being himself. He sold the 80's rocker to a tee and his singer wasn't that bad either. As I said, great fun!",1392940800,2,1197,4.033613445378151

I know it didn't get much press, but I think a lot of the media have it out for Tom Cruise. HE IS GREAT IN THIS MOVIE AS A WASHED UP ROCKER.

Who knew that straight-laced Tom Cruise could act like such a bad boy --- and make it work? All of the performers were really great, and Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand were a scream and made a ""cute couple"". The singing was over the top, and I really thought that Mary J. Blidge stole the show. I am going to buy this DVD and haul it out whenever I want to lose myself in the silly timewarp of the 1980's. Again, to watch Tom Cruise who is generally not one of my favorite actors in any role, break out as a boozy, arrogant, ultimately insecure little boy trapped by the excess of success and be redeemed by ""the one"", was a nice change from his usually one-dimensional performances.",1390780800,,795,4.342281879194631

Every song in this movie hits some emotional memory, and the production company chose all the great songs of the decade.  And if you're attentive enough, you will see some of the original artists in the movie itself.  I watched this movie just as I was going to bed a couple weeks ago and by the end of the movie I was so pumped that I couldn't sleep for several hours.  Yeah, it's weird to hear Tom Cruise sing and the movie did have some uninteresting/boring moments in it, but all the actors do a great job singing the songs with great honesty and high energy and the dancing was awesome.

Newcomer to watch is Diego Boneta who plays opposite Julianne Hough.  He is extremely talented and has a wonderful voice.  I have recently purchased several songs by him which he recorded before the movie.  Tom Cruise is incredible and very believable as an 80's rocker and Malin Ackerman as his love interest is beautiful and has a fantastic voice.  Especially enjoyed whenever Drew (Diego) and Sherrie (Julianne) sang together.  Enjoyed the banter between Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin and their ""discovery"".

I had already seen it in theaters but wanted my grandma to see it as I thought she would enjoy it. We started playing it and the audio was awful. If they were talking you could hear them fine. But the minute the music started it was almost like karaoke. The music was blaring and there was no words. And since about half the movie is singing it didn't work out. We will be returning it and either re ordering or ordering elsewhere.,1389657600,,557,4.027027027027027

4727308,2,B005LAIHRC,"Supposedly, Julianne Hough was dating Ryan Seacrest until 2013.  That seems about right; he would have just finished watching ""Rock of Ages"" and decided that it was probably time to move on.

OK; so that was a cheap joke, and perhaps even an ad hominem.  But there probably is some truth to it.  And to be completely truthful, I maybe just made it out of the first act of this rock-and-roll flop and decided to write a review.  In general, I wait until the credits roll to start writing, but in this case, I don't need to.

The film opens with Ms. Hough riding a bus, presumably in search of a city where she can become a rock and roll star.  She starts singing ""Sister Christian,"" and I had to laugh; I know someone who hates that song so much that she gets mad when she hears it.  Personally, I am not a fan of ""Sister Christian"" either, but it doesn't make me want to puke.  But it does make me cringe.

And what might make you cringe:  watching the rest of the people on the bus join in singing with Ms. Hough on this song-that-never-should-have-been.  Ugh.  And what I immediately thought:  wow, this is just like ""Glee,"" but with bad singers and a total lack of humor.  And I also thought that, while Ms. Hough is surely not a terrible singer -- she actually isn't half bad -- she's like Lea Michelle, if you took Ms. Michelle on the worst of days and gave her a really bad cold.  (To be fair, I think that Ms. Michelle is a unique talent so this isn't as much of a ""dis"" as one might think.)

But the tone of this musical-gone-wrong is all wrong itself.  It just doesn't feel right to me, and I should know; I was a metal head in the late 70s and early 80s.  It's as if they're trying to make a bunch of old hard-core rock-and-rollers ""Happy Happy,"" and that's just not their schtick.  Rock and roll guys are coolest when they're just plain mean.  And I cringed some more when I saw that Tom Cruise is in this thing, and they obviously stole some elements from ""Cocktail"" here at the beginning of the second act.

I may come back, after watching this film in its entirety, and change my review.  But I don't think so.  It's such schlock at the start that I'm sure that it will never recover.  I just hope that my ears will after listening to this drivel.",1389571200,,2261,4.251173708920188

4727311,4,B005LAIHRC,"Great Rock and Roll music combined with excellent performances by the principal actors, plus an entertaining script and story lines.  What else can you ask for?

The arrangements and vocals are excellent to my ear and taste.  The choreography is well designed and executed.  Seeing Catherine Zeta-Jones dancing in the church is worth the cost, not to mention Tom Cruise sliding around the stage and screen doing his imitation of Mick Jagger and Steve Tyler combined.

Just enough sexual sizzle without having to lock the kids in their bedrooms, unless you think Malin Akerman dancing in her underwear is a bit too risque.

Newcomers Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta deliver on sweet love, jealousy, reconciliation and ""Rock and Roll"" baby.

Paul Giamatti is perfect as the sleazy, conniving and parasitic agent.

Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand offer a quirkly counter with a surprising/amusing development towards the end....

We pushed through and at the end my husband said ""You'd better let me pick the next movie.""  Julianne Hough's voice is not suited to rock at all.  I didn't like the mash ups (combining 2 songs).

The story line is kind of sticky-sweet, but what do you expect from a rock musical?  Tom Cruz is the perfect 80's rock star, brilliant performance.  But the music is what I can't get enough of.

Julianne Hough is mousy and a little lost in her role, Diego Boneta tries so hard to make this his breakout movie, and Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Cruise overpower the rest of the cast.  It's the kind of movie that the stars in it will make fun of on a late night show 10 years from now, and not entirely out of shame because it's also the kind of cheesy, over-the-top, unstoppable flick that is destined to make it a cult favorite.

It was good to see Tom Cruise step outside his box.  He was very, very good.  Have to wonder if he was channeling Jim Morrison.  Boneta was a miscast.  He just didn't carry off the heavy metal look.  And Zeta-Jones?  Does she need money?  Is it that there just are no good parts being offered for her age group?
More importantly, I kept thinking there were so many ways they could go to give the movie some meaning.  For example, if Zeta-Jones had been the high-school sweetheart of the Stacie character and they interacted in some scene that would have shown how far apart they ended up.  Or if Stacie fell in love with Constance without the sex.  I could go on and on.  Suffice to say, I came away thinking that it was a waste of my time to watch this movie.

Now I've never been to the strip but I got a few buddies who've been and they say this is nothing like what it was like. I got a few solutions on how this movie coulda been better, but it starts and ends with more Kevin Nash. He should have at least given someone a big boot.

Not only the music which is just one song after another of fantastic rock and roll but the characters in the movie I thought were a perfect fit for there individual rolls.  (Just my opinion) But let me say this to the ladies who might read this review.  If you ever liked or disliked Tom Cruise this movie will absolutely change your mind.  He is the most sexy man alive as far as I am concerned and up until I saw this movie, I never gave much thought to how I felt about his past movies and of course the things we read about his real life.  I know he is not a Rock God, but man oh man he sure ROCKED MY WORLD!!!  I will never look at him the same again. And I think anyone who watches this will agree he just blows you completely away.

The audience got pretty rowdy toward the end of the show. I was prepared to dislike the movie. There are not too many movie adaptions of musical plays that I have enjoyed. In fact, I did not see it in the theater; however, I was looking for a movie to download to my Kindle Fire. I had read that Tom Cruise was quite amazing, and when I saw they had an extended version with extra scenes and background footage, I figured, ""Why not?""

I am so glad. I love the movie. It is not the stage show, but it is equally entertaining. All of the cast members do an excellent job. Even Alec Baldwin's awkwardness in his musical contributions is appealing, as he discovers some important truths about his life.

Catherine Zeta-Jones, still easy on the eyes, unfortunately in this film has the moves of a baby deer on ice.  And Tom Cruise, well his character seemed fit for his ego, no big stretch there.  Alec Baldwin singing, ears still ringing.  Russel Brant forgetable, and the rest of the cast follows along.  Couldn't watch the whole thing.  Some things are best left unchanged and not duplicatable, and ghat would be the eighties. Ill just keep listening to the albums.",1379462400,2,639,4.763636363636364

4727617,5,B005LAIHRC,"When I first heard of this movie I was, to say the least, skeptical. Then I saw a spot on TV with Alec Baldwin rocking out to a Poison song and my mind instantly said ""I must see this movie immediately."" I even convinced a friend to go see it with me and he was, like me, skeptical. However, two hours later, we were both laughing and singing the songs out loud. This is one of the best movie musicals in years and neither the cast nor soundtrack disappoint. Tom Cruise's Stacee Jaxx is a brilliant, if more than slightly jaded, rocker and his performance is just the tip of the iceberg. The chemistry between Diego Boneta and Julianne Hough is enjoyable, as is the over-the-top aging rockers portrayed by Baldwin and Russell Brand. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Paul Giamatti make great villains in the tale and Malin Akerman rounds it out with sex appeal and sultry pipes aplenty. The movie plays out as a believable love letter to the 80s rock scene and the film will have you rocking from beginning, featuring Guns & Roses' Paradise City, to the rousing finale of the appropriately placed Don't Stop Belivin'. I highly recommend this film to any movie lover, especially music lovers.",1378857600,,1182,4.633333333333334

4727676,1,B005LAIHRC,"This movie had so much hype to it and being a musician I was excited to watch it. I watched the entire thing thinking it has to get better with all the hype maybe its just a slow starter. Nope, it was horrible the entire way through. Now because I am a musician and and was around and legal during the Hair | Metal days I was able to find flaws right from the beginning of the movie. The dates did not coincide with the music in many cases, the songs were much older than the year they were being plugged as popular. Many of the songs were from the late 70's very early 80's and the movie begins as a time age of 1986. Not to mention all those late 70's early 80's songs were no Hair | Metal genre, they were Pop Rock on all mainstream radio. The movie was a parody at best but it lacked humor so if I could give no stars I would have.

You want a good idea of that era, with musicians from that era doing the performing or the vocals for the actors then watch ""Rock Star"" with Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. At least it is based on a true story of a wannabe that got to be and the basis was Judas Priest, Rob Halford and Tim ""Ripper"" Owens. That is a good movie. That has awesome musicians.

4727683,2,B005LAIHRC,"ROCK OF AGES practically telegraphs its trite, predictable, and formulaic story about two talented souls (the otherwise unknown Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta) going to LA in the Eighties to make music and subsequently get ""discovered"".  And of course after the mandatory fifteen lines of dialogue the duo suddenly bursts into song (Hough and Boneta do have some serious pipes, and it was good to hear several cover songs from long ago, yet the onslaught of the music rings numbingly hollow).  Meanwhile a tavern that launched so many musical careers (via its proprietor, played by Alec Baldwin, and his assistant, played by Russell Brand) teeters on the brink of economic collapse. . .unless it can convince former protge-turned-rock-legend Stacee Jaxx (a bored looking Tom Cruise) to perform onstage.  The luring of Jaxx brings about the vigorous opposition from a group bent on curtailing Jaxx's demonic brand of music, a group led by the mayor's wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  All the various subplots come (so predictably) together, culminating in the performance of a song composed by the Boneta character himself--an instant hit and chart topper.

Yet ROCK OF AGES never gains footing or momentum; the two supposed leads can't carry the freight, the Jaxx character is unlikable, the subplot surrounding the budding romance between the Baldwin and Brand characters unbelievable as well as damaging to digestion.  We all know how the Zeta-Jones character will evolve, with a collective yawn pertaining to the boy-meets-girl/loses-girl/reunites-with-girl predictable story, strongly signifying why ROCK OF AGES made its theatrical run with much prior fanfare, then limped to DVD status with a glossy haired whimper.

Cruise doesn't manage to summon anything to create what could have been another great wacky character part

He's flat and predictable and you could have cast almost anybody in the part.
Every body is fine.  The songs don't gain in anyway.
The best part of the film is Alec Baldwin's pairing with Russell Brand.
Their musical number is fantastic.

4727775,4,B005LAIHRC,"As a Tom Cruise fan, I remember being very excited for this film even though I managed to miss its release in Movie Theaters. If you love Musicals and Rock music this is the perfect duo! Some people may criticize the acting as it seems very scripted and cliche at times but the cast play off each other really well. And while the singing talents are not unrivaled there are some strong musical numbers with great choreography and you can tell the cast had a great time filming.

I'm sure most people are familiar with the story line from other reviews but for those who don't, here's a brief run-down. In this star-studded classic remake we see Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand as the managers of the infamous ""Bourbon Room"" in Los Angeles. Sherrie (Julianne Hough) and Drew (Diego Boneta) play the hopeless young romantic couple in search of fame through their musical talents. Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) is the Rock and Roll Legend that brings charisma to the screen; rocking out in spite of lust-fuelled social protest led by a former groupee (who is now the Mayor's wife) Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta Jones).  Stacee Jaxx's final gig at the Bourbon before his solo career is the highlight for me and for the rest...you'll just have to watch and find out.

I'm sure some people will prefer the stage show for the live music element but I love the soundtrack of the film too and would recommend it.

This only gets a 5.8 star rating on IMDB but I give it 4 out of 5 stars on Amazon. Easy to watch and entertaining too.",1373932800,,1517,4.545787545787546

Her ""American Idol-ish"" singing extra notes and syllables is the exact opposite of straight ahead 1980's rock.  Everyone else tries to stay out of the way and keep songs, sets, and costumes central.  Tom Cruise is surprisingly effective as a lonely Iggy Pop type.  Now: which band do I feel has aged the best???

Regardless, I loved this flick.  I think the reasoning is that the makers of the film recognized the irony in the songs without treating them like parodies.  This film reminded me of classic rock films like ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"" and ""Get Crazy"" movies that celebrated rock but also had a chaotic charm to them.  The actors are uniformly terrific from wholesome Julianne Hough to disheveled Alec Baldwin.  The best work is delivered by Tom Cruise as a burned out rock legend.  Cruise probably channeled Jim Morrison and any number of hedonistic rock stars and he seems to be having a lot of fun.  This movie had lukewarm box office probably because it couldn't expand beyond its post Boomer core audience.

4727898,5,B005LAIHRC,"I saw the previews for this film, and wanted to gag at the thought of Tom Cruise writhing on stage like Iggy Pop; turns out that the film is actually a lot more fun than I'd envisioned, as it goes through your typical Purple Rain sort of story, but in an LA rock setting in the late Eighties. A few genuine surprises (during the ""I Can't Fight This Feeling"" sequence), and some very cool rock club sequences as our heroes seriously get the lead out! The rock `n' roll weirdo scenes are pretty funny, if you think about it, and somehow the relatively sophisticated plot threads do come together fairly well in a not-necessarily-based-on-impossible-coincidences sorts of things happening. But hey, it's only rock `n' roll... and I like it!

On the negative side, it is a bit grueling listening to Tom Cruise singing ""Paradise City"" and other rock classics, and the girl vocalist's helium singing can be jarring at times. Still, you have to credit the film for really embracing Eighties rock, some of which hasn't aged well (Night Ranger, Pat Benatar) and putting it right up there on the pedestal.

Best line of the movie happens when the boy and the girl are comparing their misfortunes:

Girl: ""I mean, jeez - I'm a stripper.""

4728005,5,B005LAIHRC,"I didn't think this was going to be an Oscar-caliber movie, and it's not, but that doesn't mean it's not a fun movie. It's based on a very popular ""jukebox musical"" and tells the story of Sherrie and Drew, and their romance amid the hair metal glam of the Sunset Strip of the mid-80s. Set against the backdrop of the Bourbon Room, and featuring performances by Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Mary J. Blige, and, in a wierd casting move that somehow works for this movie, Tom Cruise as a washed-up rocker.

OK, it's not exactly a documentary on the music of the late 80s, but this type of musical was always intended to pay tribute to the music, not follow national events exactly as they were.  And it is a fun story: Sherrie and Drew meet when she comes to LA and gets a job at the Bourbon Room, a dive bar owned by a washed-up rocker. Stacee Jaxx is set to play a show there, his last with his band because he is so difficult to work with, and everyone is excited, except the mayor's wife, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who starts a crusade against Stacee and the bar, ostensibly to clean up the area, but also to be able to sell the land to developers. The night of the show, events conspire that end up breaking up Stacee and Drew and shocking Stacee out of his selfish stupor. Will they realize their rock and roll dreams or is it one last round at the Bourbon?

I can't help but like this movie, but maybe because I'm a fan of musical theatre, and I know how these tribute musicals work. It was fun for me to remember the songs that the writers used to enhance the story. And I enjoyed the performances.  Russell Brand was funny, in a way he usually is not. Julianne Hough was amazing, and the male lead was astoundingly attractive!  Mary J Blige as the owner of the strip club was wonderful in her role, and I have to say Tom Cruise, once you got over the shock that he is actually singing, was really good. It felt like we were remembering the best parts of the metal scene, looking back fondly 25 years out. And the version of ""Don't Stop Believing"" is incredible!

There is a lot of sexuality, so this is not a musical for children to watch, but I think, if you loved the 80s and that kind of music, this is a great, fun movie to watch.",1369008000,,2246,4.26056338028169

(Short version of review: just watch the Tom Cruise parts and skip EVERYTHING else)

Long version:
1. Rock of Ages--the ""Film""
2. The Awfulness of the 2 Leads
3. Tom Cruise Pours Some Sugar on Me
4. Everyone Else in 5 bullet points
5. Final Thoughts

1. Rock of Ages--the ""Film""
As a film, Rock of Ages is pretty terrible. With the exception of Stacee Jaxx, the other characters are flat, one-dimensional and while a few of them are given a moment (Baldwin, Brand, Blige--even Giamatti), these are more cardboard cutouts than fully realized characters.

Which is absolutely fine in a musical sometimes. The fun of musicals is watching people perform and bring a dimension to their characters through the music that may not necessarily be in the script. However, don't take that to mean that actors can slack off in musicals---because to really be able to convey emotion, that actor better be able not only to sing, but also act out emotions through face and body---without looking ridiculous. Even in a movie with a crappy script, truly talented actors can bring dimension to it through charisma and acting ability. Think Singin in the Rain---3 stock characters (lover/clown/ingenue) and a whole world of emotion was expressed in that movie, along with real critical commentary on Hollywood. No wonder everyone loves it.

This movie did not succeed in that regard. At all. Terrible pacing, inconsistent character moments thrown in more for shock value than coherency, and poor story structure.

2. The Awfulness of the 2 Leads
OK--I hated these 2 characters. I hated the actors' performances. And I actually saw the musical and really loved them in the musical! I think part of it is that the script takes a lot of the character development out by favoring whitewashing original plot elements. If you have seen the musical, you know what I mean. Specifically, Sherrie's ""indiscretion"" and how that really was the driving force for Drew's decisions and viewers understand why he diverged from his rock path. In the movie, he's just a mistrustful jerk.

Hough and Boneta can't elevate these characters either---they are just so...bland. Their voices are not special in anyway (like 2 chirping chipmunks is how I kept thinking about it). They have 0 chemistry. And I hate to say---there is nothing attractive physically about either of them. So everytime they are onscreen, I just zoned out and felt no investment in their storyline which is supposed to be the heart of the story.

Also, Hough is a good dancer---but she does no dancing in this movie! She just hangs off a stripper pole for a few seconds.

And was it kind of sad that when Constantine Maroulis gets to belt a couple of lines that I wished that he was cast as Drew instead? Say what you will about him, he truly was fantastic as Drew.

The problem with Boneta is that he looks like he belongs in a boyband---so when he puts on the duds, he is supposed to look really out of character. It's a problem when I thought he looked right at home in pastels and shoulderpads.

3. Tom Cruise Pours Some Sugar On Me
OK---I am no innocent---I am sure Cruise had a huge amount of influence on the Stacee Jaxx character. And make no mistake---this is NOT the same Stacee Jaxx from the musical. In the musical, Stacee is absolutely the villain. He does awful things--shockingly awful things.

But in this instance of character adaptation, it WORKS. Unlike our 2 boring and bland leads, Stacee Jaxx is a real character with real motivations and struggles---and Cruise does SO much with the character and looks like he's having a great time.

His duet with Malin Akerman was probably the sexiest thing I have ever seen Tom Cruise do. I loved the two of them together. Despite all his years of film, I have never once thought of Tom Cruise as sexy. Ever. But wow---the 2 of them singing I Want to Know What Love Is on top of that pool table was pretty off the charts. It made me forget Tom Cruise the nut---and think ooh..maybe I can throw a bra at my screen and he'll catch it!

But the centerpiece of the movie is without a doubt Pour Some Sugar on Me. I could not believe how AWESOME that scene was. Tom Cruise is always at his best when he goes balls-to-the-wall against his Tom Cruise bag of tricks and he is great in these smaller roles. Can he sing? Sure--he can carry a tune. But his physicality is on full display here. The body has aged (he sure is standing up straight) but he looks good. His age is perfect for the character. And his charisma leaps off the screen and you really do believe Stacee is an aging rock legend who once was great, got lost along the way and yearns to be great again. Urgh...now I have to find another bra to throw at my screen.

The Tom Cruise scenes all seem like they come from a completely different movie. Look how well the shots are composed, the lighting, the editing. All the effort seems to have gone into making these scenes work and even though they amount to just about 20% of the movie, it is without a doubt the only time this movie ever comes alive.

See the movie---but come back for Tom Cruise. Definitely one of my favorite performances from him. Ever.

4. Everyone Else in 5 Bullet Points
- Mary J. Blige is a LEGEND. And I have a real problem with modern musicals needing a sassy street-smart black woman (Hairspray, Chicago, Dreamgirls, etc). Mary is too good for this and is utterly wasted.
- Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand were cute. Nothing memorable but they seemed like they were having a great time and that shows.
- Bryan Cranston. Oh Walter White. Are mortgages and tuitions that expensive that you have to do this? Is meth no longer the path to financial freedom? You are SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!
- Paul Giammatti needs to work more too. Just not in a musical. Ever again. But he's great as the slimeball agent
- Catherine Zeta Jones tried very hard but her character is so unlikeable and the dance sequences are staged so badly that it just doesn't help her cause

5. Final Thoughts
This is a pretty terrible movie that may annoy you. But get it on blu ray so you can just skip to the Tom Cruise chapters. Oh--and this movie is not for kiddies---there is no nudity but a lot of extremely sexually suggestive material. I'm no prude but even I was a little surprised this was a PG-13.",1367193600,2,6474,4.59047619047619

4728180,4,B005LAIHRC,"First let me tell you that this is perfectly cast. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta in the lead parts are a great combination of youth, naivete, and guts. Paul Giamatti always seems to end up as the wise guy manager, but it's a great fit. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mary J. Blige, and Russell Brand were all entertaining. I have to say that Tom Cruise stole the show though. I thought that was his best performance since Magnolia. He just stepped into something you would NEVER think of him doing and made it real. And he sang too? Whoa! But wait! There's more. He was 49 years old when he did this! It doesn't show at all. He looked great.

After the opening first few minutes, I thought, ""Uh oh. I have chosen the wrong movie."" Like the title suggests, it's all about rock and roll. There is LOTS of singing late 80s and early 90s (mostly) rock music. If you don't like that, this will be a harder sell. If you love that and have good memories of those days, it will carry you back in a good way. The story and the way the music is expertly weaved and blended was very impressive. So even though I am not a rock fan, I could appreciate what was done with it.

If you are offended by sex, stay away. There is lots of T&A in this movie. One of the best scenes is Mary J Blige and Hough are in the strip club singing Shadows of the Night and Harden My Heart. The songs are good but the pole dancers are amazingly athletic. OMG! How strong and impressive those women are!

There are many laugh out loud moments. The singing, dancing, and acting are all great. There is lots to enjoy about Rock of Ages.",1366675200,,1594,4.2368421052631575

The main thing I didn't like about it is Alec Baldwin! That guy can't sing and is, in my opinion, a really lousy actor. They could've replaced him with any of a thousand other actors out there and the movie would've been better.",1365638400,,364,3.9324324324324325
4728186,3,B005LAIHRC,"If I were able I would probably give this film 3-1/2 stars, but as that's not possible I'll stick with a solid 3. Yes, it's cringeworthy in spots and yes, the hair and costuming is awful at times and yes, it's very cheesy and yes, it's still a damn good time all around. This is what satire is, guys. Face it, when you're making a movie that takes its cues from the music in it (and especially when that music is 80s hair metal), your plot is going to be EXTREMELY corny and pretty predictable. But when you're making a movie that takes its cues from 80s hair metal, it's obviously not all about the plot.

The musical numbers in Rock of Ages are performed with so much heart and soul that it makes me think these actors belong on the Broadway stage -- they pour everything into their parts, and that's half of what makes it such great fun. I was extremely impressed with Tom Cruise's vocal work; never knew he could sing like that! And I was so glad to see Catherine Zeta-Jones in a musical again because she's a great all-around performer -- the female Hugh Jackman equivalent without the nasal singing voice. In fact, I really thought the whole cast did well when it came to singing, even Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin (I have a notorious hatred for anything Baldwin does, so this was particularly impressive to me). Their subplot felt a bit rushed, but they played off each other so well that it was hilarious to watch how things unfolded. Russell probably stole the show, if there was anything left to steal after Cruise came through. I'm one of those people who still thinks Tom Cruise is a psycho after the whole jumping-on-Oprah's-couch thing; it made me lose so much respect for him as a professional (not to mention that it seems like a lot of the roles he plays anymore are still reaching for the stars of his Mission Impossible days). But Stacee Jaxx seemed to fit him like a glove -- or perhaps those leather pants. For his age, he's in great shape. And who honestly knew he could sing at all, let alone WELL? Color me impressed. Grudgingly so, but impressed.

The downfall in my eyes is the choreography. I don't go into movie musicals expecting a whole lot, but I do like to see solid choreography. The dance moves were so boring, and knowing that someone as renowned as Mia Michaels was the choreographer, I couldn't help but be disappointed there. I think it would've been better to not put so much emphasis on the structured style of choreography and keep it a bit more loose and flexible -- yes, this is based on a Broadway musical, where choreography runs rampant, but it's also an 80s homage. People should be able to just let loose and be wild.

In the end, this is definitely on my list of guilty pleasure movies -- not sure if I'd watch it again or just pick up the soundtrack to keep in my car. If you've got a sense of humor and love 80s music, you'll get a kick out of this one.",1365552000,,2906,4.387755102040816
4728187,5,B005LAIHRC,"As a child of the 80's, I knew I would like this movie.  Add in the fact that I absolutely adore musicals, it was a flat out winner for me.  It's a good thing that I didn't see this film in the theater cause I would have annoyed the crap out of fellow movie goers.  The only thing that could have made this movie better was a sing along version, but who are we kidding, we know all the songs by heart already!

I know Tom has made a dud here and there but this is just plain bad. He actually is the only thing I liked about the movie but what really ticked me off is a song performed in the beginning. Extreme's ""More Than Words"".... I LOVE THAT song but its not from the 80s! That song was number one hit in 1991. Thats such a big oversight and shows what carelessness was put into making this film. The director didn't seem to know whether he wanted to make a comedic parody or drama. I was really looking forward to seeing this because I love the hard rock music of the 80s but this was no tribute. I urge 80s rock fans to stay away from this film.",1365379200,3,795,4.2026143790849675

4728224,2,B005LAIHRC,"Performing over produced and cheesy renditions of popular songs isn't new, but it's become de rigueur thanks to that abysmal show American Idol and all of its unholy spawn, including Glee. Now we have this attempt to combine the familiarity of MTV's golden hair-band age with a Moulin Rouge twist.

This movie was not the most awful thing in the world, but to think that they'd make a movie that uses gag-inducing pop metal from the 80s to tell a clichd story of love and stardom is mind-boggling. Of all the eras and genres that this formula might've been applied to, the choice of schmaltzy Starship, Quarterflash, Extreme, et al seems curious to say the least. It isn't like I can't hear any of Journey's bigger hits in dozens of other movies (Adam Sandler must own the publishing rights), so why shove these rather generic songs at the public yet again?

There is a near-criminal misuse of some talented performers to boot. Giamatti, Zeta-Jones, and Baldwin try, but they're given so little to work with. Cruise hams it up as a jaded, drunken, leather-clad rocker, and seems grossly miscast, as does Baldwin as the nightclub owner.

The love story is tepid, the songs are memorable more for their cheese-factor than anything else, and the few surprises are forced and underwhelming. I had high hopes for Rock of Ages, but then again, I had high hopes for MTV, too...and look at how that mess turned out.  Jersey Shore any one?",1365206400,2,1430,4.730923694779117

I was a teenager in the 80s (graduated in 1987 in Northern California) and this didn't quite catch the mood, fashions, hair, songs, well hell, nearly everything about this was all wrong...Tom Cruise (often very funny in this role), Alec Baldwin and Paul Giacomo are OK, given what material they're working with.  Russell Brand irritates the hell out of me -there was an annoying monkey in the movie that was equally bad to have to sit through. With Brand, the camera stays on him as though everything he does is so precious (and it's not).

I liked the Tower Records scenes...wow that brought back memories!!!

Julianne Hough is ultra-cute but damn, her voice...so squeaky -grated on my nerves after the first scene -her singing is awful too. The role that she has relies on showing off her body and less on what she has to bring to the character of Sherrie.  She and ""Drew"" are really awful, there's ZERO chemistry between these two.

Mary J Blige shouldn't have been in here. I like the story line, the transition from rock into pop and the music industry. But the movie just doesn't work. Catherine Zeta-Jones is OK too.

This movie is just corny. Oh, and I'm no prude, but the exaggerated tongue-kissing is actually really gross...LOL

4728260,5,B005LAIHRC,"Note: I saw the PG-13 version in HD via XFinity On Demand.

The film Rock Of Ages is a terrific rock musical starring Julliane Hough, Diego Boneta, Malin Ackerman, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Bryan Cranston, Academy Award winner Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Cruise as Stacie Jaxx. The acting is top-notch and the songs are really good. My favourite songs are Paradise City (played in its entireity during the end credits), Sister Christian, I Want To Know What Love Is, Pour Some Sugar On Me, Any Way You Want It and Rock You Like A Hurricane (cut from the film, but partially heard during the latter portion of the end credits), Every Rose Has Its Thorn and Don't Stop Believin'. The choreography is outstanding. Tom Cruise literally disappears into the role, becoming Stacee Jaxx.

Biblically speaking, there's no actual nudity, but very suggestive dancing and sensual scenes take place throughout. Stacee's entrance in the film is particularly telling of the sexual content. There's also some mild-to-moderate profanity, with one use of the f-word, but thankfully, no profaning of God's Name (ie. combination of His Name with a mild curse word), and a kiss between two men at the end of a beautiful song by REO Speedwagon, which I think was poorly used here. I lowered my eyes when they were about to kiss, so I didn't see that part. I don't see why film-makers feel the need to insert the aforementioned erotic element between two men in a movie. Just implying it the way they did during the song was enough, in my opinion. That is taking something that God designed to be between a woman and a man & perverting it. God calleth that an abomination.

With a caution about the heavy sexual content, I recommend this movie.

Rated PG-13 (heavy sexual content throughout including suggestive dancing, some language, drinking and brief violence).",1364860800,,1846,4.888178913738019

4728265,1,B005LAIHRC,"Watching Rock of Ages one is quickly reminded of the old existential teaser which stipulates that if you put an infinite number of monkeys in front of an infinite number of typewriters eventually one of the eager little simeons will type Shakespeare. Or, more plausibly, if these same monkeys are subjected to a free screening of Rock of Ages they will eventually run amok, rise against their masters and fitfully create their own Planet of the Apes sequel in order to redress such unremitting cruelty.

Rock of Ages is not just a bad film, it is an excruciatingly bad film with a rationale for being made that in my present state of disbelief, I cannot even fathom. From the first frames, where a Greyhound busload of Midwestern farmers spontaneously break out into a chorus of Night Ranger's cloying anthem Sister Christian, my jaw never left the floor. Fast-forward through the hackneyed Def Leppard meets Oklahoma, girl meets boy homage to 1980' s Hair Bands and you have an MTV inspired clusterf__k of Rock Me Like a Hurricane proportions.

And finally, overlay this mess with an Oscar-caliber cast (Paul Giamatti, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta Jones, Bryan Cranston and a highly opiated Tom Cruise channeling Axl Rose) who all look like principals in a hostage video ready to fire their agents.

4728349,2,B005LAIHRC,"I love the 80's and was hoping for an experience with this film like that in 'Mama Mia,' which is fine silly feel-good bubblegum pop with a tissue-paper thin plot.  'Mama Mia' was mostly an excuse for enjoying ABBA again, because your hair's gray now and you don't care anymore that ABBA wasn't cool then and pretty much isn't cool now. I was disappointed in this film for a a number of reasons.  The young leads were fine and most enjoyable.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was tolerable as the moral-crusading former groupie of the mega popular rock star, Stacee Jaxx.  I always like Alec Baldwin and Paul Giamatti and they didn't disappoint as the club owner and the rock star's manager, respectively.  Stacee Jaxx was supposed to be, as I guess, a fusion of Axel Rose, David Lee Roth and Steve Tyler.  Tom Cruise did a fine job acting the part of the decadent decaying and brain-dead rocker.  His voice, however, wasn't there for the music.  To be fair, he sang remarkably well considering he doesn't do that for a living, and as far as I know hasn't ever done something like this.  It wasn't that the vocal delivery was bad.  The voice was just wasn't right.  He isn't a musician and being able to sing the notes doesn't make you one. He's also a highish tenor, which doesn't work with the music he was singing.  That's fine in Journey songs but not heavy metal anthems. The way I thought about his performance as Stacee Jaxx was similar to the way a lot of people who are serious musicians and singers felt about Anne Hathaway's perforance in Les Miserables: beautifully acted and sung with a lot of emotion, but didn't do justice to the music (if you really loved the music.)  Although it's not as common for rock singers to be given credit for having real musical chops, especially metal hair band rockers, the best ones really do have them and it's not an accident. Also the sight of almost-50-year-old Tom Cruise walking around very buffed out and shirtless pretty much the whole time was not as impressive at it might have been. At this point it's self-parodying in a way that I don't think it was meant to be, and made him look both dated and sad, when the emphasis was supposed to be on his being still viable as a hard-rocking sex god.  Trust me, the girls don't love Mick Jagger anymore because his looks are sexy (it's only because he's extremely rich.)  Axel Rose looks freakish since his facelift, David Lee Roth is old and balding.  Both are paunchy and plainly Past It.  Steve Tyler looks like a hairy pregnant pencil, with streaks of gray in his long thinning locks.  However, unlike the other two, he still 'has it.'  Pity Tom couldn't have emulated that quality, although I think that's what he was trying for.

4728353,2,B005LAIHRC,"When I heard that the musical ""Rock of Ages"" was being made into a film starring Tom Cruise, among other unlikely people such as Alec Baldwin and Catherine Zeta-Jones, I had to laugh. Watching it last night  didn't make me want to laugh, it made me want to vomit. The Tom Cruise character, Stacee Jaxx, was such a bad performance on his part, he made me cringe every time he grabbed a passing breast with that psycho look in his eyes and that odd head tilt. There are so many other actual rock artists that could have played that roll and been so much better. Cruise is just too wimpy to play a sex fiend rocker. It was just embarrassing to watch.

**Sorta Spoiler Alert**

The whole thing with Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand was ridiculous and laughable. Malin Akerman as the Rolling Stone reporter and her whole scene with Jaxx was both laughable and sad at the same time but not for the reasons that you would think, with them both being lonely. It was because Tom Cruise was just plain bad in that role. All his licking (""Open your mouth"") and groping and wierd spaced out looks were just too much. The whole movie just seemed contrived and thrown together to be the background to a great line-up of songs from the 80's.

To me, this movie is to rock and roll as Showgirls was to actual showgirls in Vegas. It was a waste of time that I'll never get back and just proves that Cruise tries way too hard to be a ""serious"" or ""comedic"" actor, which ever he was going for. Russell Brand I can watch any time in almost any of his movies, he's always a riot. In fact, skip this one and watch ""Get Him to the Greek"" instead. He plays a much better rock star than Cruise ever could.

Catherine Zeta-Jones just plays a bitch once again and way too good, kinda makes you wonder if it's a natural state or what. The love story between Hough and Boneta gets pushed to the back and it's way too sappy anyway. I say all this and I'm a female and love ""chick flix"". This did nothing for me but make me want to shower after it was over to wash away the feeling of slime.

Rock of Ages is on my list as one of the worst films in a long time. I can't get the image of Stacee Jaxx out of my head, he was just way too creepy and what was with his pet monkey, ""Hey Man""? A nod to Michael Jackson and Bubbles? The Bourbon Room was a poor imitation at best of the world famous Whiskey-A-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip. Having been there many times and seen some fantastic bands, this just made my skin crawl! Just my POV. I'll give it 2 stars because of the music.",1364083200,2,2540,4.194672131147541

4728357,4,B005LAIHRC,"Rock of Ages is a fantastic musical.  Well... admittedly it was pretty rough viewing material for the first hour- nothing really memorable occurs other than the music being performed of course.  But from a storyline point of view the first hour is pretty lackluster.

The truth is however, if you love 80's rock -especially the hair metal movement- you will unquestionably admire what Rock of Ages presents.  A few flaws appear occasionally such as everything Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand do together- horrendous writing that I don't even need to comment on, haha.  I like how the women -especially Julianne Hough and Catherine Zeta-Jones- are INCREDIBLY attractive!

Perhaps a little heavy on the Foreigner material, though the trading back and forth of ""Juke Box Hero"" and Joan Jets ""I Love Rock 'n Roll"" is a nice addition.  As is ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" starring Tom Cruise resembling Alice Cooper both personality and appearance-wise.  I imagine that's completely unintentional but I could be wrong.  A lot of the stuff in between all the singing and dancing is total fluff however, especially during the first hour.  It's not really a consistently compelling musical which separates it from, say, Grease.  Yes I know- Grease was released in the 70's and features an entirely different type of rock, but the singing and dancing is why I'm mainly comparing the two here.

Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the role of a leader protesting a movement against all the negatives associated with rock music.  This is a highlight.  However there's a couple lows that make me drag the overall rating down 1 star.  First, the boy band segment later on.  One of the rock stars (played by Diego Boneta) eventually sells out and joins a rock band.  This stuff has no real reason to be included in a movie that should most certainly be centered around rock and roll.  And the presence of a pet baboon is awkward and unnecessary.

Besides Foreigner, if you like Poison, Def Leppard, Guns 'n Roses, Journey, Pat Benatar and REO Speedwagon in particular, you can expect these bands to dominate the majority of hair metal acts featured in Rock of Ages.  Somewhat limited with just these selections I believe since the 80's presented a LOT more depth than this, but there you have it.  Also, I was inclined to think Rock of Ages would focus more on the heavier metal acts judging by the commercials, but not so much.

A good musica, some creative singing and dancing with a few songs (Pat Benatar's ""Shadows of the Night"" and ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" being highlights from a creative perspective) but expect the stuff in between the singing and dancing to feel tacky and sometimes boring.",1363996800,,2680,4.818380743982495

4728428,4,B005LAIHRC,"I notice this movie has garnered a broad variety of opinions and star ratings that run the gamut.

But seriously people, let's not take this movie too seriously.  If the viewer is searching for an intellectual or spiritual experience, a movie that inspires instrospection, or a movie that will stand the test of time, Rock of Ages is probably not what you're looking for (unless you're a child of the 80s and are still quoting lines from Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's).  However, it the viewer understands this movie doesn't offer elements of intellect, thereby having a more realistic expectation of the movie, then this is a downright fun flick to watch.  And if the viewer is a child of the 80s who grew up listening to the cassette tapes of some of the era's greatest Glam Rock Hair Bands, then this movie is nothing less than a grand trip down Memory Lane, singing along with great oldies (No Way!!  Oldies??  Say it isn't so!) from groups like Def Leppard, Journey, Foreigner, Joan Jett, Pat Benatar, REO Speedwagon, Guns 'N Roses, The Scorpions, and so much more.  And in addition to the music, the directors have mixed in some type of simple love story played out by characters with combined IQs of maybe a 100 - but that's okay, cuz this movie wasn't made for the story (or the intellectual viewer) - it's all about the MUSIC.

So be realistic about this movie and simply enjoy it for what it is - a 2 hour retreat from the world to the nostalgia of a great music era gone by.  Do that and you just might find yourself being simply entertained as you sing along to some great tunes that helped define the era.  Expect more than that, and you'll probably be disappointed.

P.S. Some of the lip syncing is pretty bad too, but just go with it!

P.S.S. Having said all that, in the interest of fairness across the generations I am obligated to report that my teens say this music makes their ears bleed...but what would they know, they're just teens - though they do seem to have all the answers to life's mysterious questions, or so they tell me, their stupid old man.

4728483,4,B005LAIHRC,"This pertains to the extended version of the film and not to the play:

I am not a huge fan of musicals, in general, but I do love 80s ""hair"" metal. Those who lived through the '80s know that serious things were happening in the world and in their own lives, yet they probably also remember turning to those songs featured in the film to cope with what was happening. This is what the movie focuses on--big dreams, glamor, escapism--the stuff of everyday life if you were a teenager during this time period. I love how the film captures the idea of reaching for one's dreams and seeing those dreams fail to materialize as you had hoped. The film captures perfectly the feeling that most young people had during this time of transcending one's current situation and becoming someone important and special. As I watched this film, I kept thinking of hopes and dreams of those featured in The Decline of Western Civilization, Part II.

While it is true that sometimes you don't know whether the scenes are meant ironically or seriously, this just further captures the feel of the late 1980s and the individuals involved in the scene on the Sunset Strip. The musicians took their music seriously--whether out of an artistic stance or out of the drive to achieve fame and money--usually  both. But inherent within the genre itself was a sense of playfulness and of blurring the line between reality and fantasy. Also evident is the power of record companies to shape and control everything about an artist's image. In 1987, several of the metal bands were struggling to make it, so you see this strange combination of seediness and glamor-- the reality of their situations versus where they aspired to be. The movie portrays this well.

The right songs were used in just the right places, and for the right characters, to convey the emotions of the characters in a given scene. People have complained about Julianne Hough's singing, saying she sounds too country, but the character is from Oklahoma, and, as anyone who was listening to the radio in a conservative rural area in this time period can attest, country stations outnumbered rock stations. Record and cassette collections were often the only way that kids could listen to their favorite bands; similarly, rural teens who were lucky enough to have cable television or a satellite feed could see their favorite bands on MTV, which did nothing to dispel the notion that the entire music scene was glitzy and alluring.

Like other reviewers, I agree that Cruise gives an amazing performance. He portrays depth and intelligence in a character that the audience could, otherwise, easily dismiss as a spoiled, hedonistic burnout. Plus, he is funny. The choreography is great, particularly the Venus Club dancers, the Cruise/Hough number, and Hough's number at the Hollywood sign. It's impressive that the cast themselves, including Alec Baldwin, sing.

I had seen the stage play (with Constantine Maroulis in the Diego Boneta's role--Constantine was better!), which I adored, so I was a bit skeptical when I heard they were making a film version.  OK, MORE than a bit skeptical, especially when I heard that Tom Cruise was playing Stacee Jaxx (I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan).  I have to say, he was INCREDIBLE.  Well done, Tom!  The film version of the story differs some from the stage version, but I didn't care.  SUPER fun movie!!!  I bought a blu-ray copy.

The only advice I have for you is this:  Wear ear plugs during Julianne Hough's singing.  She is as cute as a bug and quite believable as the Midwest Girl coming to Hollywood to find fame and fortune, but her voice is enough to shatter glass.  SO high that, if she'd sung one more note higher, only dogs would have heard it.  Grating...made my teeth hurt.",1362355200,,949,4.36

I had no idea who it was and I've never heard of her.  I had to look her up when the movie was finished to find out why someone in their right mind would have given this person a lead singing role.  Her name is Julianne Hough, whom I have never heard of ever before this and now I know why.  When she opened her mouth it was like breathy helium.  Her voice was teeny bopper high it reduced this movie to the level of High School Musical or Glee.  There are no other young actresses out there who can actually sing?  Luckily, what pushes this to getting an average of three stars is everybody else in the movie who walks on screen and steals it right back out of that lousy actress/singers hands with the super high voice.  These are gifted actors who are not singers, but are able to pull it off.  Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta Jones and Mary J. Blige.  Eli Roth and Deborah Gibson make a worthwhile cameo.  The real treat is a duet and sexy outlandish performance between Tom Cruise and Malin Akerman who plays a Rolling Stone editor. Her voice was incredible and I was wondering, ""Why is she not the lead actress instead of this other chick?""  Anyway, if you can past the horrible singing of this Julianne Hough character you might be able to get through this insane story set in the 80's rock era.

I'm not a huge 80's fan, but Rock of Ages made the music make sense through the interaction of the characters and the music. When the movie started I thought if the entire movie was a musical that would probably get too annoying, but it is not a musical completely as there is some talking. It is not a kids movie, but the sensual scenes are only implied but still probably for adult viewing as nothing is shown more than a bunch of suggestive intimate dancing with a lot of kissing assertively that is still probably suited more for adult viewing. In the beginning of the movie I thought what is this style of movie, then I was like it's kind of unique yet corny, then by the end of the movie I thought it was actually a pretty entertaining different type of movie and I was into it and ready to rock.

4728695,4,B005LAIHRC,"You go to watch a movie like ""Rock of Ages"" for the music, not for the story.  Those who have knocked the film for a shady story aren't entirely wrong, but I will contend that the story, while not being the strength of the film, does enough to make the film work.

You can't help but see that all of the performers from Tom Cruise to Paul Giamatti to Catherine Zeta-Jones to Alec Baldwin, had a blast making this film.  And why not?  They got to bring back the nostalgic time period, that many feel, was the last great decade of music.  The movie not only restores a number a quality 80s hits, but they do so in a way where the songs coincide with the story or moments in the story.

You can't make a movie about 80s music without understanding and capturing the 80s music culture.  I remember going to school during that time period and seeing kids with long hair, black rock band t-shirts, and looking like the rockers that they all obviously idolized.  Our parents thought they were crazy.  It's ironic how with each generation of music, the previous generation doesn't tend to care for it.  My parents hated the music of my time just as their parents hated the music of their time.  And, I have to honestly say, I can't stand most of the music today.  Go figure.

The story takes place on the Sunset Strip, a place on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood that was considered by the music world to be the mecca of rock music.  If you were anyone, you got your start here.  Bands from ""Def Leppard"" to ""Journey"" all fondly remember the days of sinking their teeth into the music scene by performing gigs at places like ""Whisky a Go-Go,"" ""Roxy,"" ""Pandora's Box,"" and the ""London Fog.""  Here ""Rock of Ages"" centers around ""The Bourbon"" (fictionalized locale used in place of ""Whisky a Go-Go"").

Enter Sherrie Christian (yeah, if you can't make any connections with THAT name, then you don't know hit 80s songs!), played by Julianne Hough.  She's a girl from Oklahoma who has a dream of being a rock singer.  She meets Drew played by singer Diego Boneta who also has aspirations of being a singer.  He works at ""The Bourbon"" and when unfortunate events quickly strike Sherrie, Drew helps her to land a waitressing job at the club she has dreamed of since she was little.

The Bourbon is in dire financial straits and club owner Dennis Dupree (wonderfully played by Alec Baldwin) is counting on legendary rock star, Stacee Jaxx's (Tom Cruise in yet another signature-defining role that will blow you away!) one-night-only performance to pull him out.  Of course, we have the underhanded agent, Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti) who has other ideas.
On the other side of the rock music fence you have Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the wife of the new Los Angeles mayor whose sole mission is to end rock music for good in Los Angeles.  People, not familiar with characters like this, have complained about the lack of authenticity of Whitmore, but  I remember people preaching against rock music, making claims that rock groups were Satanic and evil.

The performances in this film are all top-notch.  The standout is easily Tom Cruise's Stacee Jaxx who easily models the typical rocker of that era.  He dresses and acts the part perfectly.  Band members of Journey and Poison have said, ""that's how we were!  We had drugs, sex, and alcohol.  We were kings of the Sunset Strip!""  Everyone in the film does their own singing, and Cruise was no exception.  He practiced for 5 hours a day for 5 months, and even when band members of Def Leppard were brought on set to watch him, they were astounded at his music ability.  Cruise reportedly has a four-octave range, and while he obviously isn't Def Leppard, his rendition of ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" is pretty darn good!  One of the producers overheard a Def Leppard member say, ""Christ, he's better than we were!""  Not true, of course (which even the producer stated), but getting that type of feedback from members of one of the most popular bands of the 80s is high praise!

There are over 20 memorable hit songs scattered throughout the film.  I'll wager that nearly everyone knows them all.  Back to the 80s culture on-screen brings back the crazy hair-styles and outfits that were so popular and common back in the day...the tight spandex pants, the guys when looked at from behind, you thought were girls, and so forth.  In the extra features, many of the artists laugh at how they looked back then, but then, that was the culture.

The song and dance numbers are all fun, and I still remember some people in the theater audience clapping and singing right along.  It helps, of course, to have one of the world's best dancers in Julianne Hough who really did a job with her dance numbers.  Watch the extended version, as most of her dance numbers were edited out for the theatrical version.

Is the story somewhat cheesy and predictable?  Yes, but so what?  The point is that the story is fun, and it keeps and plays in time with the songs.  ""Rock of Ages"" is just a ton of fun and a good time.  I've even had people who weren't around, or were too young, to appreciate the music of that era say things like, ""why don't they do music like that anymore?""  ""Rock of Ages"" even goes so far as to poke fun at the next generation ""boy bands"" that basically replaced the power ballads and music of the 80s' bands.

So if you want nothing but a good time?  ""Rock of Ages"" is it!",1360281600,,5416,4.550155118924509

4728727,1,B005LAIHRC,"""Rock of Ages,"" based on a theatrical ""jukebox musical"" built on the songs of 1980s big-hair power-pop bands like Foreigner, Journey, Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, etc., is an appallingly bad movie. The plots (boy meets girl, boy loses girl due to a misunderstanding, etc.; beleaguered owners trying to save their Sunset Strip rock club from a back tax debt and religious culture warriors) are trite, the script is lame, and because you see the jokes coming a mile away, they're not funny.

Although my feelings about the songs in ""Rock of Ages"" range from indifference to active dislike, I did not hate ""Rock of Ages"" because I hate the genre or the milieu. I adore ""Almost Famous"" and enjoyed ""Get Him To the Greek."" This kind of music can make great kitschy fun when handled well. I like to lose myself in inspired silliness, having seen ""The Spongebob SquarePants Movie"" at least 12 times. On paper, I should have liked ""Rock of Ages.""  In this shockingly unimaginative, bloated, overlong execution, a fun idea wastes the talent involved.

The talent is considerable: Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Russell Brand. Julianne Hough and Diego Bioneta, the young leads, fit musical convention for ingenues with their sweetness and sincerity. Tom Cruise surprises as the wasted star Stacee Jaxx, whose performance is expected to save the struggling rock club. I don't think he's great--he's too compact, too bulked-up, too teeth-clenchingly Tom Cruise--to completely convince us that he's a Jim-Morrison-esque vocalist--but he throws himself into the role and, like the other actors, seems to enjoy himself. Unfortunately the cliche-ridden, limp script doesn't give any of these talented performers anything worthwhile to do.

The only people I expect would like this movie would be those for whom the songs rise to ""soundtrack of my life"" significance. The actors all do their own singing, and the arrangements of the songs are pretty true to the originals. I knew Catherine Zeta-Jones could sing from ""Chicago,"" but who knew Tom Cruise could sing? He does, and very well. There are plenty of songs ""Rock of Ages,""  many of them mash-ups, for example, Foreigner's ""Juke Box Hero"" mashed up with Joan Jett's ""I Love Rock and Roll."" Whether the songs arise naturally from the action is another question.

Infantile as ""Rock of Ages,"" may be, many parents will probably find the language and sexual suggestiveness inappropriate for their children.",1359936000,4,2457,5.13

4728768,3,B005LAIHRC,"My husband liked it quite well.  I was impressed at the actors doing their own singing.  All I knew of the movie was from the trailer, which had looked cute, and I didn't even know it was based on a Broadway musical.  If I had known, I would have ignored it, because I don't like musicals generally; that's why the relatively low rating.  That said, this one chose pretty good 80's music, and the performances are energetic.  There are quite a few special features on this Blu-ray (single disc), and it does come with an online copy.  The special features include comments from band members of the groups that made the songs popular, about the writing and their reaction to these performances; one on 80's hair-styles (!), and 80's clothing.

4729209,1,B005LAIHRC,The story is corny and predictable.  Acting doesn't rise up beyond the material except for Tom Cruise who takes his best stab at Axel Rose.

That being said, even my teenage daughter loved it. We also got the soundtrack for a road trip to the beach and we had a great time (and laugh) singing along.",1357862400,,480,3.715686274509804

4729452,5,B005LAIHRC,"This movie is INCREDIBLE - It's a musical - so please know- most of the movies are songs and music- all from the 80s- which I loved.

The actors and actresses were soo soo incredibly talented- I'm sure voice equilizer was used (which some people have criticized) but with/without that - their voices were amazing- I ended up buying the soundtrack as well.

It's fun to see the cosumes (also from the 80s) the way LA used to look and all of the fight and picketing that went along with that times.

The storyline/plot is also quick  moving, funny, and entertaining!

Growing up on '80s rock such as Poison, Twisted Sister, and Bon Jovi, I'm hesitant to hear my favorite songs sung by actors or anyone else other than the original singer(s).  The cast is competent, but it feels like karaoke night.

The more disappointing aspect is the lack of cameos from the real rock stars that built the foundation for this film and provided the music.",1357862400,,444,4.525

Just a warning, if you don't like musicals, you probably wouldn't like it.  However I love musicals so this was perfect for me.  As usual Tom Cruise poured his heart and soul into this role.  His voice was amazing as well.  Julianne Hough proved she is more than just a pretty face.  The music was amazing.  In fact I intend to purchase the soundtrack today.  If you want a fun movie with great music, I highly recommend this one.",1357516800,,566,4.314285714285714

This takes all the twisted sex/drugs/rock and roll craziness that was the 80's and flaunts it out for everyone and says 'Yeah, we were drunk, drugged and screwing anything we could nail, but DArN it, WE HAD FUN!!'  If you're looking for mindless entertainment and enjoyed the 80's music - check it out.  If you don't like 80's hair band music and don't like laughing at/making fun of what life was like back then (yes, I graduated high school mid 80's), then go rent/buy/see something else.",1357430400,,668,4.5966386554621845

Plus, if you are going to make a movie set in 1987, try a little harder to make it authentic! Julianne Hough's hair in the opening scene looks more like a cross between Farrah Fawcett and a modern-day style than remotely like anything I saw in 1987. In 1987 it was all about bad perms and big, fried, curled bangs. Not even CLOSE to what is in  this movie. Secondly, I distinctly heard ""I Remember You"" by Skid Row in the record-store scene. DID NOT COME OUT UNTIL 1989. Lazy, lazy, lazy. How this movie received the rave reviews it did is beyond me. Weak!",1357430400,6,694,4.464566929133858

The only downfall was it was a bit drawn out - could have ended it about 20 minutes earlier for a really awesome length movie (for what it was intended to be). Clearly, this movie is for those who want entertainment - NOT a thinking movie or something other than pure fun! I really enjoyed it! B+ at least! If you love the 80s and rock-n-roll, you'll love it :)

Being a huge fan of great ROCK music, I knew all the songs and sang along. I stopped signing the second Tom Cruise appeared as Stacee Jaxx. I am a former Cruise fan and I was shocked at how much I loved him in this film. He's greasy and slimey in all the right ways. He's every hot lead singer in any rock band plus a scuz bucket rolled into one. I obsessed with Tom and Stacee Jaxx. I listen to the soundtrack all the time!

This movie was so cheesy and painful to the ears, that I thought maybe they meant for it to be a parody of the broadway show. Russel Brandt and Alec Baldwin need to stick with comedy and stay out of the recording booth.

4730017,5,B005LAIHRC,Tom's musical talent definitely shined. The rock star attitude was unpleasant but understood. The addition of the musical talents of Diego and Julianna introduced my family to more musical options. Russell and Alec added an unexpected twist to the music.  All the actors blended naturally to portray a movie so entertaining and powerful you can watch it repeatedly with enjoyment,1356825600,,379,5.316666666666666

I wanted to like this movie so bad, but it was just plain weird at some points;and the acting was really corny. The music in the movie is really good, but the plot for this movie was just horrible. There were so many times when I just wanted to turn it off, but I was still enjoying the music.

4730021,5,B005LAIHRC,This movie is so funny and Tom Cruise's performance is over the top!  Julie ann Hough and the male lead are just delicious as the young and in love couple torn apart by a misunderstanding.  Catherine Zeta Jones is amazing as the anti-rock right wing mania.  You can't escape the feeling that Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin are having a riotous good time in their roles.  A very fun movie,1356739200,,387,4.485714285714286

4730103,4,B005LAIHRC,Have never seen the broadway musical but I enjoyed the movie.  The songs were great and Tom Cruise was perfect in the role of the aging rocker. Am not a big fan of Tom Cruise but he has made some good movies and he certainly showed his diversity in this one!!  Even if you are not from the 80's and can overlook some of the more raunchy scenes the movie can be a fun watch.,1356739200,,373,3.96
4730104,5,B005LAIHRC,"ahhhh.. I watched this three times during my rental period and I think I will buy the movie.  Grew up in this Era and loved the music.  Def Leppard and Journey were some of my all time favorites and still are!  When I first saw the movie, I thought it was a little corny, but I loved the music and by the end I wanted to see it again.  I thought the cast did a great job,  loved Tom Cruise, Julianne Hough and the new actor Diego were awesome.  They all did well and performed/sang well!  I was impressed with Tom Cruise and he did great!  His ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" number was awesome!  That was my favorite part of the movie.  I can't believe it got such low ratings.  I think once people see it, can appreciate the music and humor and give it a chance, they will think it is awesome too!",1356739200,,791,4.038709677419355

4730110,1,B005LAIHRC,"I may have been expecting too much...  I graduated in 1987 which is supposed to be the year this movie takes place but they were off on hair and clothes styles which was dissapointing.  A lot of songs by Pat Benatar, Journey and Foreigner came out in the early eighties so that was another inaccuracy.  I thought the casting was bad as well.  Why not cast Stacie Jaxx with someone younger and taller that looked more like he belopnged in a hair benad???  The actor who played Drew made the character seem like someone who would have gotten his butt kicked-he couldn't pull off the rocker tough act at all.

In the last scene at the concert, Sherrie's outfit was ridiculous!

This was a total waste of time and could have been done so much better!",1356652800,6,746,4.4411764705882355

4730201,2,B005LAIHRC,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie and was surprised at how well it started out. I didn't expect a musical but the beginning reminded me of a rock version of Xanadu. Since I like 80's rock music so well I enjoyed how it started.

Then came in Tom Cruise. I loved the music and the way he sang them was excellent. The acting and story line was just bad in my opinion. There wasn't enough depth in the characters and the storyline just seemed to be haphazard in getting the plot across.

My opinion is that if you like rock music from the 80's then you should rent the movie as cheaply as possible and buy the CD soundtrack. All of the actors and actresses deserve to be commended for how well they sang. Unfortunately the movie dragged on with no storyline and no real plot and it was too long. Julianne Hough was a bright spot in the movie and I was impressed with her singing, dancing and acting. The girl has talent!

I rate this movie 2 stars and the soundtrack as 4  to 5 stars.",1356480000,,992,4.178010471204188

4730364,4,B005LAIHRC,"I didn't know Julianne Hough before this movie, seems my wife did. Apparently Ms Hough is a former Dancing With the Stars standout, or something similar. Her dance performances in this movie are excellent, especially a fantasy scene where she is solo on a balcony. And she is excellent as a singer with a voice I enjoyed in spite of an overly nasal ""twang"" that seems less pronounced when she is speaking. I found her at her best singing duets, she has an ear for harmonizing.

I was shocked to discover that Tom Cruise sang his numbers. I watched the end music/song credits hoping to discover who had been his voice stand end. Then I watched some of the extras, one of which contained a featurette with Def Leopard on site at the movie set watching Cruise rehearse one of their rock anthems. They seemed genuinely Impressed. And so was I.

The movie's story line is cold, you have seen dozens of these pictures before. Small town girl/boy comes to the bright lights-big city looking for an opportunity to be in show business. Takes a job around show business, circumstance provides the big break with the hero or heroine being supplied needed support to get through it all by a love interest or patron. From ""Young Man with a Horn"" to ""Coyote Ugly"" the story has been done to death.

But the production set pieces, the music and dance, this is where you either like it or ...... And this one I liked. I'm a man of a certain age and the covers were terrific.",1356393600,,1458,4.494339622641509

4730422,3,B005LAIHRC,"Bring on the Cheese! Entertaining enough as long as your expectations aren't to high. Alec Baldwin is a weird choice for his role. Hough is a decent enough singer, but gets thoroughly blown away when Mary J. Blige starts singing.  Stealthy, but liberal auto tuner use makes the cast sound like better singers than they are.

The storyline is the stock ""naive Midwest girl moves to LA to become a star, falls for boy who becomes a star while greedy manager takes everyone until he gets his due in the end.""  The only different take is the cheesy incorporation of all your favorite 80's hits into the storyline and the chorus.  If you liked 80's music (any of the styles), then you'll probably enjoy this movie, even if you're not a fan of musicals.

My favorite of the movie was when Cruise did wanted dead or alive he was awsome. Great music from that time,1355875200,,339,4.059701492537314

4730714,5,B005LAIHRC,"I adore musicals, and I got a real kick out of the humor in this one. Tom Cruise does an outstanding job as the aging, sexy, lost rockstar. In my opinion, his performance is the best reason to watch this over and over again.",1355788800,,224,4.113636363636363
4730715,5,B005LAIHRC,"you have to remember all of these movies are being reviewed and written by me (lisa ) mastromonaco, i liked this one, i enjoy musicals, i didn't think this would be good ,but the music and the people ""rocked"" it, it will not let you down,, i like when a movie gives you an ending not like some of them movies that cut the ending and your like what? but this i would watch and  watch...",1355788800,,385,4.065789473684211
4730716,2,B005LAIHRC,The only good thing about this movie was the music which definately took me back to some fun times!  Tom Cruise so over-acted in this movie that it was almost comical.  The direction of the Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand characters was confusing and just not necessary.  This movie could have been so much better.,1355788800,,313,4.654545454545454
4730717,4,B005LAIHRC,"This filmed musical based on a musical play about a boy and a girl came to Hollywood to fulfill their dreams has an age old and slight story but filled with energetic performers and pop music from the 80's.  Credits must be given to Hollywood veterans like Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones, etc.  Without them, there is no movie.  Cruise in particular gave another his 100% and impresses us with his vocal ability.  If you like 80's music, you'll like this infectious musical.

4730827,4,B005LAIHRC,"Whoa!  You've never seen Tom Cruise like this!

The movie is totally worth it just to see Cruise's performance on stage.

Talk about raw energy! Talk about moves! Talk about a fantastic voice! The film came alive during his performances.  And he was sexy, and had more rock in him than anyone you've seen at the Grammy's.

Russell Brand and Alex Baldwin were great and helped ground the film. It's the first time I've seen Baldwin in something I've liked. Paul Beamonti (misspelled) is always good no matter what part he plays.  Too bad the romance between Julianne Hough and her boyfriend (name unknown because the font the film used for the credits was almost unreadable) brought the film down. It was way too long, cheesy, and boring, but the film is well worth seeing Cruise perform.  He deserves an Oscar.",1355443200,,810,4.702127659574468

4730829,5,B005LAIHRC,"It's fun - Cruise nailed it - there is definitely something about him that is extremely special - he knows the camera loves him and he knows how to move for it.  The movie isn't the best but the story is fun, music fun, Baldwin & Russell are very funny.  Rock on.",1355356800,,263,4.038461538461538

4730912,1,B005LAIHRC,I watched this movie just because Tom Cruise was appearing in it.  My wife and I wanted to turn it off after the first 5 mins.  We were thinking that this was going to be a movie similiar to Grease.  But it seemed like this movie was just a long music video. So we ended up finishing the movie by fast forwarding it to the parts with Cruise.  If this was the last movie on earth I would burn it just to entertain my self with the flames.,1355184000,2,437,3.9318181818181817

4730914,3,B005LAIHRC,"This is a musical, in case you didn't know.  It's not as good as you probably thought it was going to be and that comes from the top-to-bottom demograohic they are trying to appeal to in the casting.  The very weak part, depending on your age, I guess, is the two younger male and female leads.  They are nice people, but just too bland to push anything at you from the screen. I really doubt 12 year olds were flocking to see this movie, so I doubt they made any extra money by placing these two so centrally.  And it certainly did bring down the movie's critical ratings. Tom Cruise is the one you are going to be waiting for between lapses in his screen time. He leaves nothing left ungiven as usual. The one other detail that detracts from the fillm is the lipsync singing which sometimes works and sometimes flops. Zeta-Jones is good with the dance moves.",1355097600,,860,4.389937106918239

I'm not very easily offended.  I like crass, dark, even violent (sometimes) humor.  Sometimes things just aren't funny.  I got the impression from my mother that this movie was dumb, but worth watching.  I actually found myself wishing I could have that time back.  The last movie I remember feeling that way about was Ghost Rider...which was better...seriously.  Don't pay money to watch this.",1355097600,,571,4.905263157894737

4731013,4,B005LAIHRC,"If you take this movie seriously then there is something wrong with you. Tom Cruise is over the top and lets it all hang out. Not many actors have the guts to do that (well, Alec Baldwin does, too funny).

This is really a fun movie.  A small group of us went together and we laughed so hard I didn't know if we would make it to the end.  Now it is a great Christmas gift for member of that group. What a night to remember.",1355011200,,423,3.895348837209302

4731017,1,B005LAIHRC,"an astonishingly bad ""musical.""  The insipid young lovers could be expected, but the film holds no musical value and the actors struggle with bad dialogue.  The only amusing/interesting moment is the Baldwin-Brand number ""I Can't Fight the Feeling"" as comic relief.  Worst of all is the PG-13 rating which must have resulted from a bribe or intense studio pressure.  There is nothing PG-13 about face licking, adult spanking, and violent sex in a bathroom.",1355011200,,456,5.121621621621622

Cruise is over-the-top and, like the other characters, entertainingly superficial. The movie was better than I had anticipated it would be. As a musical movie, it is no ""Grease"" but is quirky and entertaining enough to be a fun view and definitely different than a lot of the other same old fare.",1355011200,,442,4.67948717948718

4731131,2,B005LAIHRC,"First, I should say that Tom Cruise is not my favorite guy/actor, whatever, in the world. I own only two of his movies. I think that his best performances have been only when he got the right director in charge. Well, all my theory went to the trash when I saw ""Rock of Ages"". The movie is a mediocre musical (and I love musicals), the director, Adam Shankman, dissapointed me with Hairspray and now he did it again. Oh boy, this guy doesn't understand that he is not the new Bob Fosse?. The cast is superb, all people who know about musicals, especially Catherine Zeta Jones. I really prefer to remember her wonderful performance in Chicago and forget she was in this movie. And I thought that Cruise was going to ruin the movie!! All the contrary, he saved it. I must admit. Also, I doubted he could sing, I really thought he was being dubbed until I checked the credits. Seeing is believing. Well, Tom, you saved this movie from sinking in the bottom of the ocean. He is the only actor that took his character seriously, did his work, learned to sing I suppose, and really transformed into a rock star sort of Steven Tyler meets Axel Rose. And he did well, he deserves a nomination to some award. All the rest of the film is pretty bad. If you want to colaborate with the profits of this film, don't buy the movie, just the buy the soundtrack.
And the 1980s was not the Age of Rock guys, that was the 60s and 70s. The 1980s was better known for its pop music. I should know, I come from the pop generation, and I'm very proud of. God save Madonna! (and the late Michael Jackson)",1354579200,2,1581,4.326599326599327

4731133,4,B005LAIHRC,"Rock of Ages had a limited release where I live. I think it was on the cinemas no more then 2 weekends, and I decided to go and see it mainly based on the soundtrack and also I tend to watch the movies Paul Giamatti is involved, I like his acting.

Let's start by saying this is a musical, and you can expect a lot of humor and a story that just barely makes sense. The movie is just truly simple in many ways. The movie tells a different story from the broadway musical, with a more lightened and positive ending, by telling a pretty straight forward love story. Not much of a surprise there.

But at the same time, it is truly enjoyable. The actors do an amazing job singing all those classic songs and Tom Cruise particularly delivers a very strong performance as a rock n roll legend.

I bought the DVD version, and there is not much to say about it. I give it 4 stars as I think the DVD was very much bare bones, there is almost no extras, and even the interviews are missing Tom Cruise.",1354579200,,992,4.15625

So we were really excited to see how it would be captured on film. The music was there but the magic and spark  was gone. I am not a hugh fan of Tom Cruise but I think he was ok with his part but some of my favorite actors were in this but, they just seemed to be miscast and just muddled thru it. There were one or two little segments that were a bit fun and that is why I gave it two stars instead one. We really wanted to enjoy the big guns of this movie but all it did for us was to shoot blanks",1354406400,2,647,3.7226277372262775
4731213,5,B005LAIHRC,I don't see any Academy Awards in this films future but it was fun and very entertaining. The music was a great. Tom Cruise' character was creepy and some of the kissing in this movie was oddly uncomfortable and again creepy creating uneasy chuckles but overall a movie I would recommend to friends and family.,1354406400,,310,4.654545454545454
4731214,1,B005LAIHRC,"Only watched the first 10-15 minutes. It quickly became apparent that this is not the type of ""entertainment"" my wife and I care to watch. Wish I could un-see the image of Tom Cruise's buttocks filling the screen. I was looking forward to this show from the positive comments I had heard about the sound-track. Unfortunately, some of the characters portrayed (at least in the first few minutes) were totally debased. I did not want them in my living-room. Only wish there was some way to get my money back.",1354406400,,506,4.633333333333334

4731216,1,B005LAIHRC,Really lame movie.  Great music is the only reason I watched it as long as I did. Don't waste your money.,1354406400,,105,4.0
4731217,5,B005LAIHRC,"This movie is awesome! It is loaded with so much star power it is unreal, Cruise, Zeta-Jones, Brand and plenty more, and one can't forget about the rocker cameos!

I have never seen the musical, but if it is anything like the movie, it has got to be an amazing experience. The songs flow so well within the movie, and just about every 80s mega hit is here, from We're not gonna take it, to Every rose has its thorns. You will find yourself singing along and playing air guitar more than once!

The story and acting were both top notch. Its rock and roll, with a little love story threw in, and some comedy to top it off. I believe this movie will turn out to be this generations Grease.

So what are you waiting on, order this movie and rock out like its 1980! Enjoy and hope this review helped out.",1354320000,,799,4.209150326797386
4731218,5,B005LAIHRC,"Rock of Ages is simply a lot of fun! Possibly it helps if you were a child in the 80s like me or were older to appreciate the music even more and just relive decent music again, and throw in the whole nostalgia factor too. I also can't imagine younger audiences who have embraced the TV show Glee and various karaoke style reality TV shows like no generation before with unknowns singing cover songs of classic songs won't love this too. There is no great detailed storyline in the plot, it's simply your basic girl who is a big fish in a small pond moves to the big city and bright lights where it isn't as simple to achieve her dreams as she thought. Nice city guy with similar dreams who's been working hard to make it himself and becomes interested in her, then throw in unethical evil type manager of big star whose let fame go to his head and doesn't want his cash cow put back on track no matter how it is obviously affecting that stars longevity.  Sure those story threads have been done time and time again but the actors in Rock of Ages do it again nicely.  Like with Glee and musicals turned into movies, yes you can tell they are lip syncing to studio recorded songs at times, maybe even more so than most in this one, but you've got to remember the original artists of the songs they are singing cover versions of, had obvious cheesy lip syncing going as well in the original song film clips so it is sort of paying homage to them in some way.  The actors do a pretty good job too (so much so that I bought the soundtrack), sure they might not do as good a job as the original artist in the 80s, and even sing the songs differently such as the way Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) sang Dead or Alive as a duet with Sherrie (Julianne Hough).  But I like that sort of thing, if you want it exactly the same you might as well just play the original artists and have them lip sync over that.

I must admit I was hesitant that Tom Cruise could one pass as young enough to be an 80s lead singer in a rock band, but he does pull the look of an almost washed up rock star well.  I also had concerns if he and others such as Baldwin, Brand and Jones could sing at all let alone good enough to do the classic songs of Guns N Roses, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and others that I was a favourite of well.  But he/they all do a great job, as I said good enough that I bought the soundtrack. I mean on the DVD you have a special feature called Def Leppard: Live At The Premiere which is basically that band playing Pour Some Sugar on Me on the red carpet.  Cruise had way more enthusiasm than the ageing Joe Elliot with the intro Hugh! line to the song in fact the whole song was done better. Granted Def Leppard aren't in their prime anymore (and I was a big fan of these guys) but I think critics of Cruise's performance should watch Jaxx's performance of Pour Some Sugar on me back to back with the DVD extra before passing judgement.

I had never heard of Julianne Hough or Diego Boneta who are the two main characters the plot revolves around but both did a great job in both singing and acting.  Julianne being smoking hot, as was the reporter and some characters didn't harm the whole enjoyment of watching factor either.

Visit Florida tourism commercial was a bit out of place as an extra, would have preferred to see something else on the DVD but I guess maybe they sponsored or were in investor in the film or something.

But definitely get this DVD, it's a lot of fun and a nice nostalgic trip for the two hours or so duration!",1354320000,2,3524,4.196745562130178

The movies charm is that it does not take itself to serious and allows you to do just the same. Realize that this is just some very talented singers/actors paying tribute to Rock and Roll and you will not be let down. It is very funny at times and told a classic rock and roll story.

Picture singing Journey and ending the song before ""and it goes on and on and on..."", or having half the songs butchered. I have been told that it is my generation that hates it and honestly that is not the case. When you want to see a musical you want it to have full songs and sing along with it.

The main story line (the love story between young boy and young girl) could have been removed completely, the supporting characters could have been developed more and I would have actually loved this movie.  Because they spent more time on this forgettable pairing a few of the supporting characters were neglected and they didn't make much sense in the movie for instance Catheine Zeta Jones and her husband would have been far more interesting to know more about.

I was torn between giving it 1 star and 2, but I went with 2 because some of the singing is very good.  The story is just a stupid as can be, though.  Tom Cruise does a good job of singing, although I don't think I saw any evidence of his supposed 5-octave range. There are some other good singers, too, although I didn't think the female lead had a very good voice. Overall a weird movie with a couple of redeeming qualities.",1353283200,,507,4.05

The characters are quite likeable. If you grew up in the 80s (as I did) you would relate to the Tower Record scene, hair spray, spandex, leg warmers, big hair, etc.  It's a trip to the past.
Do not take this as a movie but as a long video music clip instead. Nothing to be serious about, this is just a very good entertaiment to share with anyone who belonged to the 80's.

There is a funny parody to boy bands like NKB, lip synch, and RAP music.
This is definitely a purchase rather than a rental. I have watched ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" scene a thousand times and can't seem to have enough.",1353283200,,674,4.06015037593985

Beyond that, I found the plot vaguely uninspiring, the musical aspects ranging from somewhat amusing to fairly irritating, and the Russel Brand love story completely superfluous. Tom Cruise as Stacey Jaxx was a throwback to his Bob Seger Lip-Sync days albeit slightly more moody, and Diego Boneta ""writing"" and ""performing"" Don't Stop Believin' was... well... completely unbelievable. :-P

The DVD is great.  Only complaint is that the electronic copy requires a flixter account, and the account set-up was buggy (and undesired; I already have an UltraViolet account - why did it create a new one for me even when I told the page to use the one I already have?).

In fact, the cast was very good except for Diego Boneta (a major casting error). Boneta was so weak that he couldn't hold up his part to the standard of the heavy-weights around him (including the monkey).  Too bad they were all fighting a losing battle as the story, fun, structure, and music were gutted and mutated so far from the original and in the worst way.  Adam Shankman proves that he is an egotistical no talent hack (and honestly that is being overly kind).  It drives me crazy that this movie insult even exists as it is extremely doubtful that a decent version will ever be made.

I was especially surprised with Tom Cruises' abilities.  I even enjoyed the special features which explained alot about the rock scene during the 80's and was fascinated at how this movie was made in southern Florida.

This was poorly done, even for a musical, and then even for something in which Adam Shankman was involved. Mr. Shankman: please stick with 'So You Think You Can Dance' -- it's what you are suited to do. From the looks of ""Rock Of Ages""..... perhaps the only thing.

There is no surprise that this is the inevitable result when a production company gives Adam Shankman way too much money, and then tells him that he is a director.

I am currently online looking for knitting needles big enough to completely gouge out my eye sockets, they having witnessed the above and other bizarre acts in this decidedly Shankman video.

4733310,1,B005LAIHRC,"As a huge fan of the Broadway musical I had no idea what to expect when I watched this movie. I tried hard to keep an open mind. Sadly, I was hugely disappointed. The stage show was edgy, hilarious, and loaded with great tunes well-performed by a superbly talented cast. At its heart was the engaging love story between its two not-quite-so squeaky clean protagonists, Drew and Sherrie, which has some bumps along the way but ends happily (hey, it's a musical, right?)and keeps you entertained all the way to the end. You genuinely cared about the characters and what they go through during the course of the story. Unfortunately,  ""Rock of Ages"" the movie bears little relation to the delightful musical that garnered five Tony nominations. It has been gutted of all of its heart and emotion and what is left is a big empty shell in which dull minor characters are now the main focus and allowed to preen and strut at the expense of plot and character development. And humor and musical talent. I guess that's what happens when you feel you have to pad a picture with big names; Adam Shankman must have felt he needed to give them more screen time and thus sacrificed the story along the way. Stacee Jaxx, the character portrayed by Tom Cruise, was but a minor but pivotal character in the musical, but is now inexplicably thrust into center stage and has way too much screen time. Every time he was on screen I was bored out of my mind. He wasn't funny, his character was not interesting, and I found myself repeatedly looking at my watch waiting for the torture to end. If you have to bring in a monkey to try and add laughs you know you are in deep trouble.  Evidently to make room for so much Cruise screen time, Drew and Sherrie have been reduced to Disneyfied cutesy teens hanging around in the background, with no chemistry or talent in a love story that is now also equally uninteresting. The pivotal moment in the musical where their relationship has a significant turning point has been completely altered, into nonsense that the audience really couldn't care less about. Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin were also completely unfunny and their attempts at singing downright painful. Interestingly enough I found the most interesting role and best performance came from Catherine Zeta-Jones as the Christian rock music protestor, in a role that didn't exist in the stage play. She was funny and performed her role with an energy and gusto sorely lacking from the rest of the cast. It was a thrill to witness the delightful cameo by Constantine Maroulis, who had given such a terrific performance as Drew in the Broadway show. It's a good thing after all that he didn't get cast as Drew in this sorry excuse for a movie musical. I apologize for continuously referencing the musical but it just amazes me how such a wonderful Broadway show could be transformed into this dull, unfunny, uninteresting cinematic disaster that bears little relation to it. Don't waste your time on this movie. Go see the live musical!",1351900800,12,3020,4.69622641509434

Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand - perfect. Obviously, changes from the original Broadway Show story line and different songs performed/not performed. The ""mash-ups"" really worked.

I WAS WRONG.  Don't waste your time or money.  Parts of it were over the top cheesy which I appreciated, because I thought they were making fun of themselves and the 80's era; but then there were too many parts that felt serious, which then had me wondering if I'd misread the parody.

(The only musical I ever enjoyed on film was The King and I.) Hollywood is too slick. The people are too pretty. And far too often their personalities overwhelm characters they portray. I wasn't looking at the character Brand was supposed to be, I was looking at Russell Brand. He acted like the Russell Brand I see when David Letterman interviews him.

Yes, the storyline was cheesy and very basic as most musicals tend to be. But the cast do a great job with their individual caricatures of the various roles they each play. Tom Cruise, especially surprised me. His tongue-in-cheek impression of the egomaniac lead singer was hilarious and was worth the money itself.

Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Malin Akerman all do great caricatures of their various roles.

Enjoyed the music, particularly the Foreigner numbers. Some were a bit corny but ""Hit me with Your Best' by Zeta-Jones and the ""Juke Box Hero/I Love RocknRoll"" medley were highlights.

Julianne Hough was a surprise. A dancing Jennifer Aniston.

With that said, the way this woman loves musicals (especially exciting and well produced), this is an awesome start to making things better. She has had it for a week and a half and so far it hasn't left the DVD player apart from movies for my son. And when she's playing his movies she'll put Rock of Ages in her computer and watch it. She won't admit how much she REALLY likes it, but she hates watching movies more than a time or two right off the bat. She has watched it about 15-20 times in 10 days. She LOVES it... If your significant other likes musicals... This movie will put you on her good side... If I had any reason to take a star off of this, it's mainly because the fact that Tom Cruise is the main character. But, since he plays a part that I feel was typecast for him, it makes me feel better to see him as Stacee Jaxx. It's almost that they just got him really drunk and gave him a cowboy hat and told him to be himself and he just did. He might not of even known that the movie made it to theaters.

4733989,3,B005LAIHRC,"The movie is fun, in the ""stupid but funny"" way, kinda like Dumb and Dumber. Characters are over the top and do ridiculous things but it makes you laugh. What really hurts the movie is that it goes a little too hardcore. It may have worked better if it were more family-friendly. Instead we have strippers who don't show the goods. Female fans and groupies showing the goods but the camera not peeking. Men kissing each other. Seriously, this movie doesn't know what it wants to be. Either go full blown ""R"" and give the adults what they want, or soften it up and get the parents to buy tickets for their kids. Instead its just a tease and pisses everyone off.

Anyways, Tom Cruise steals the show with his Stacie Jaxx character, who really is the main player in the movie. Everyone and everything revolves around this character in the movie from the two main characters moving to LA, The survival of the club, etc. The two ""main stars"" of the movie (Julianne Hugh and Diego Bolenta) are basically there to show how Stacie Jaxx got so f'ed up and the poor decisions he made, so I see the importance of their parts. Other characters could be cut altogether and nobody would notice. The main problem with this movie is that its WAY too long. Over 2 hours? Really? First of all, we can get rid of the Mayor and Catherine Zeta Jones character completely. That would cut out a solid 15-20 minutes. Those story lines are not needed at all and waste time. Russell Brand isn't needed either. Im not even sure why he is there other than to give Alec Baldwin someone to talk to? Brand would have another 10 minutes or so cut from the film. That would take it to 90-100 minutes. More doable, and nothing would change!

Watch the movie for the cool soundtrack and Tom Cruise as Stacie Jaxx. If you have seen him in Tropic Thunder then you know how awesome Cruise can be in these over-the-top characters.",1351382400,,1891,4.46242774566474
4733990,3,B005LAIHRC,"Simply put, A for effort, A for cast, A for music, C for acting, F for substance.  So you have a C+ as your final tally.

Look, the catchy medley's and throwbacks to my generation of rock and roll was awesome.  Reminiscing over the tunes with my wife brought on a sense of euphoric nostalgia at a few sporadic moments.  But, let's get to the meat and potatoes.  It felt extremely forced, pretentious and downright (for the lack of a better term) cheesy at times.

When you are going to transform a popular musical into a motion picture (which in most instances, has not worked well) you are going to have to put some zing behind the screenplay, besides ""just"" a stellar cast.

It was obvious, the overall concept was thought out based off of the music (again, that was great) and star appeal (great cast, not so great acting).  But it attempted to lean on star appeal alone and that cannot be the defining success of a movie.  People are looking for something with more emotion and depth.  After the first half hour or so, it was very apparent that this missed that mark.

I really consider this a take it or leave.  If you have no options, this is a great time waster, just for the music alone.

The ending credits left me with that nagging feeling that the director, screenplay writer, and producers could have done a better job building this city of rock and roll.",1351296000,,1367,4.4417670682730925

4734115,3,B005LAIHRC,"This movie was pretty good, if you like musicals then this was worthwhile for a view. The music is fun and well done, the acting is good and Tom Cruise really does play himself well (lol).

That being said, there are some strange things about this movie. First off its conflicting themes. It's glorifying rock, which isn't bad except it's somewhat humorous when they mock boybands and pop yet use such heavy AutoTune for their music. It would be kind of like Glee mocking highschool musical. I just found it somewhat ironic.

Their message about fame is actually great. However the weird feel good ending doesn't fit at all with the message that this film was actually developing. They had something good going about fame, and what society does to the famous and then they just kind of threw it out.

A few other annoying things: the fundies. C'mon guys this is just so played out. The hypocritical Christians trying to put a stop to things, then surprise surprise surprise they end up with some humiliating event in their past they're angry about. It's just unoriginal. I feel like writers have completely ran out of ideas for bad guys. This film didn't NEED bad guys. If you can't write something original don't write at all.

I would have enjoyed this movie more without the autotune (like I said before). This style of music caters more to the mainstream (which... again goes against their theme, but ok). Other than the autotune though they didn't take extensive liberties with the songs, which was nice, there were some really great arrangements in this movie. It was entertaining, somewhat humorous, and only had a few unpleasant scenes.

It definitely stretches the limit of PG-13 so keep that in mind with younger audiences.",1351209600,,1733,4.802013422818792

I have to admit I do like musicals when they deal with musical subjects.  For instance: I hate the Les miserables (musical) because... C'mon... who the hell sings his or her heart out in the middle of a firefight? it just looks ridiculous!
On the other hand... A cynical piece full of sexy singing women like Chicago... what is not to like?
I thought Rock of Ages was going to be something similar sexy chicks singing 80s glam hits... After all... look at the posters!
I WAS TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY MISTAKEN
Yes, there are three beutiful sexy girls in the ensamble cast, but they sing the worst tunes of the 80s, the script for the movie is just... just lazy and the acting is... somehow (i really do not know how) worst!
Naive girl comes to the city with rock dreams in her head during the glam california era, she gets to work in the hottest club in town and meets a ""rock god"" that spawned from that particular club while romancing another employee of the club who is, obviously, also a talented underapreciated aspiring ""rock god""... Enter the cruel evil manager that tries to manipulate them all and... well you can fill in the blanks without even watching.
It is expected for the plot to be lame, but I sincerly thought this was a love piece for the  Montley Crues and Poisons and (dare I say it?) Warrants of the time... Instead we are stuck with... Journey?????? Ok, maybe I was to young to remember the 80s properly but Steve Perry don't come to mind when I think about the glam rockers of the time.  I know this is a brodway musical and probably the music selection came from there but... C'mon... They could have changed it to actually be relatable to... I don't know... Rock fans? After all this was supposed to be a blockbuster with a ginormous budget!

Now, as for the rest of the movie, I think I really enjoyed it because it struck a chord with me.  I was growing up/ a young adult in the 80's in Orange County in Southern California.  I remember driving up to LA and ""cruising"" on Sunset Blvd and some of my friends trying to sneak into the clubs with fake ID's.  The big hair in the movie didn't even look weird to me... it still looked good (ha ha ha).  So...

BUT if you like the 80s music of Foreigner, Journey, Pat Benatar, etc., and like the big names in this cast - Alex Baldwin, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Paul Giamotti - it is well worth it. And Tom Cruise is simply fantastic! I am not usually a Cruise fan, but personally I do like him in comic spoof roles (this role and his Tropic Thunder role are my favorites.) He's riveting here, and I loved it. It's a lot of fun - if you're a product of the 80s, you'll probably find yourself singing along - and there's plenty of laughs too. If you don't like this music, or Tom Cruise ever, than this movie is probably not for you, as that's pretty much what it's got going for it.

There is a number with Alec Baldwin & Russell Brand that tries to be campy but comes across as tired & pointless.  This has all been done before & done better.

4734601,5,B005LAIHRC,"Ok, I admit it.  I was an 80's party girl and loved the big hair metal bands of that era.  Lord, those were great times!!!  I had heard so many negative things about this movie that I didn't go to the theater to see it.  I primarily bought it when it came out on dvd because I DO love 80's music, brings back sooo many great memories.  I really had no high expectations where this movie was concerned, and I must admit I was curious how Tom Cruise would carry off the part of a Rock Star.  His character's look intrigued me enough that I thought, what the heck, I'll get the damn movie.  If it stinks, I can always donate it!

If you're expecting something along the lines of ""South Pacific"", ""Oklahoma"" or even ""Chicago"", keep looking, because this movie isn't it.  The story's been told before many times.  Small town girl heads to L.A. with stars in her eyes and big dreams in her head.  She loses her record collection, finds a job, loses her innocence, finds love, loses love, finds it again, etc., etc.  The Bourbon Club is under the threat of being shut down by religious fanatics for playing devil music, etc., etc.  It's the ol' overcoming challenges type of movie.  There is not a lot of substance to it.  But, you know what?.... That's OK, because this movie is so much FUN to watch!  I LOVED it for that reason alone.

I can take or leave Tom Cruise.  He's made some outstanding movies, but that's because they were really good movies, i.e., good plot, good cast, good special F/X, etc.  I was sooo riveted watching his performance as Stacee Jaxx.  He nailed it!  He was amazing.  I saw a sexuality to him I didn't think existed and I was blown away.  I didn't ""see"" Tom Cruise, I saw an aging rock star in an alcohol induced haze trying hard to stay on top.  His singing was actually quite good and he moved and danced around on stage as though he were an actual rock star putting on a concert.  He impressed the hell out of me in this movie.

While not a huge Alec Baldwin or Russell Brand fan, these two were delightful to watch as Dennis, the owner of The Bourbon and his right hand man Lonny.  Their duet is priceless!!  Who knew Alec Baldwin could sing?  Very passable.  The rest of the cast turned in laudable performances as well, Julianne Hough, Diego Boneta, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Paul Giamatti, Mary J. Blige.  Some of the songs were a blend of two different popular 80's songs sung at the same time, and and they were fabulous pairings. I really enjoyed ""dueling"" songs.

You know every song that's being sung, hell, you'll sing right along with them.  Come on, admit it, you even remember all of the air guitar riffs and licks, and the awesome air drum solos to all these songs! Because I do.  I think my husband thought I was having seizures at first due to my antics, but when he was assured that I did not in fact require medical attention, he sat down and enjoyed the movie too.  So, watch this movie for the sheer enjoyment of what's on the screen and the pleasurable walk down memory lane.  Watch it strictly for entertainment purposes only.  DO NOT try to find any deep, thought provoking, life changing or profound storytelling here, you'll be sadly disappointed.  So, park your brain at the door, crank up the volume, sing along, and just enjoy!

It's a guilty pleasure, so ROCK ON!!!  Now, where did I put that mousse and extra super hold hairspray?

4734602,2,B005LAIHRC,"Some great songs, sets and costuming that bring back lots of memories (dating myself here). However, this movie is tainted by horrible casting, some really terrible song choices that can barely be considered ""rock"", and acting that makes ""Glee"" look Oscar-caliber. Adam Shankman just really needs to stop trying to be a director and stick to choreography, which he is great at. For the age group he was shooting for, this was all wrong; the dialogue and direction was for tweens while the subject matter and cultural/historical references were clearly for 30-40 somethings.

Julianna Hough's nasally voice is more suited to country than rock and while I have the utmost respect for Mary J's voice, her character was just not necessary. Diego Boneta was far too ""pretty"" to work in this role and Tom Cruise was...Tom Cruise with fake tattoos.

Back to the movie. I cant believe it did not do better in the box office. I thought it was a great movie. The all star, and not so all star cast, were all put in there right places. Great music throughout. Some humor, little love story, so, good to watch with the girlfriend. Tom Cruise does a great job, as does the newer Juliane Hough.

It's got some feel good moments in the movie, that will have you singing along with some old rock and roll numbers.  It's a blast from the past that made me feel like you've stepped back through time.  Rock and roll will never die, it lives on in this musical movie.  I love Broadway musicals, because they tell a story that we can all remember them by.  And this one, will certainly be kept in my heart, even though it does contain some strong sexual content, it doesn't go too over the top.  But the music is what keeps the characters alive and strong as they sing all throughout the movie.  Adam Shankman (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's ""Once More, With Feeling,"" and ""Hairspray,"") directed another memorable movie that could be watched a numerous of times.  Tom Cruise really sings really well and as with the other cast members.  You never know who's gonna be the next Broadway star, in the movie business.  The songs touched the story in a way that could be remembered that in the age of rock of roll, does not change a person's personality for the turn of the worst, but for another generation of music.

I was drawn in just from the opening number, and it held me from there. Sure...it's a lot of 80s cheese and big hair...but if you enjoy the music from this era, and aren't looking for anything deep...you'll probably really enjoy this one. Some of the rock mixes were great. I loved how they combined some of the songs. All of the actors just looked like they were having a blast as well.

My only complaint is that I wish it had a LITTLE less of of the very clearly inferred sex (just the way it was done was really in your face), because I would have loved to share this with my 13 year old daughter who is super into music too. I get that the whole premise was rock and roll and sex...but when they several times have characters whipping down their pants, a chick spanking a man bent over a table, another one looking like she is...ahhh...kneeling in front of Tom Cruise's character, and more...it was kind of on the edge for PG13. The main female character ends up being an exotic dancer..yet even those (several) scenes were less in your face (and they had plenty of pole dancing) than some of the other scenes. Again, I do get why it was there..just a side mention of wishing maybe there wasn't quite so much and instead it would have been all the music to make it a tad more family friendly. Since it would be a fun movie to share with your kids to show them what we grew up with, music-wise. I thought the male lead actually had a really good voice, Tom Cruise did a great job, as did Alec Baldwin. I enjoyed the female character (Sherri) for the most part...her voice got on my nerves every once in a while.

But...bottom line, if you enjoy 80s music and want a no-brainer, don't expect anything at all deep, just fun hour and a half--give it a try. Well worth the rental price, in my opinion.",1349913600,9,1975,4.264

4734805,4,B005LAIHRC,"I thought this was a great musical - but you probably have to be a fan of the music genre to really appreciate it. The movie doesn't cater to everyone and that's what's great - there's sex, drugs, and of course R&R - and its a lighthearted throwback or homage to that time. The remixes of the songs are great: take two classic rock tracks and meld them together and the outcome is perfect for most of the songs.

The cast does a great job - especially Baldwin and Cruise.  I don't really care much for Russell Brand, but he was alright too.",1349827200,,540,4.233009708737864
4734806,3,B005LAIHRC,"I am trying to view this a second time before my rental expires, but am having a hard time. I love cheesy stuff but this is artery-blocking cheese of the highest magnitude. I am having a hard time telling the two blonde chicks apart, and the scene where Tom Cruise is singing to one of the blondes and starts singing into her granny panties, I just doubled over with laughter and had to pause it for quite awhile. Ok one blonde has a perm and abs, and the other has less curly hair and abs.
Though I have to say the 1980's classics do bring a smile to my face, even though most of them are wrecked by the stars in this flick.
The thing I liked best about this movie, and I don't think it's too spoilery, is the fact they savaged the dancing goofball boy band dudes.
The romance between Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin is a bit out of place in this period piece, but it does show the kids gay people existed before the 19990's.

4734807,2,B005LAIHRC,"I watched this movie because I was on a flight to India.  I actually expected it to be decent.  Not great, but ok.  It wasn't.  The music was distracting, it didn't add to the overall story.  I liked the songs, but they seemed to take away from the story, which was lackluster at best.  The two leads were annoying.  I love Alex Baldwin, but his bad wig was so ridiculous I couldn't take the role seriously. It was hard to tell if they were trying to make it a parity or trying to take themselves seriously.  The only good thing in the movie was Tom Cruise.  When he came on the screen and in all his scenes, he brought the movie to an all new level.  He is the only reason to watch this movie.  A good example of how a great actor can still be great in a really bad movie.",1349827200,5,773,4.019736842105263
4734808,3,B005LAIHRC,"""I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all."" Sherrie Christian (Hough) is a small town girl who took the midnight plane to LA. When she arrives she meets Drew who works in a smokey bar with the smell of wine and cheap cologne. They quickly fall in love and the path to fame is ahead of them. When Drew gets his big break opening for Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) their paths and relationships start to change, and not for the better. Before I start this (in case you don't already know) this is a musical so if you are not into musicals you can stop reading. On the other hand all the music is from 80's hair bands...so that is pretty rad. I will say that this movie is easily the most clichd musical I have ever seen. Girl lives in small town, moves to big city, instantly gets robbed but is helped by a boy who immediately gets her a job at the place she wanted and they fall in love...a misunderstanding causes a fight...yada yada yada. To be honest the movie is almost too cheesy to watch, but the music keeps you involved. The entire soundtrack is songs by 80's hair bands. Tom Cruise covering Wanted Dead or Alive is actually pretty sweet. Overall, a movie that really is only watchable because of the music, if you are not a fan of 80's hair bands do not watch this, if you are then you will probably like it as much as I did. I give it a B-",1349827200,,1348,4.168582375478927

For a smile they can share the night
And it goes on and on and on and on

A huge cast ensemble hams it up big time in this just-for-laughs musical about the big-haired decade of slammin' rock anthems.  Although totally cheesy, completely formulaic, and universally abhorred by critics everywhere, there are three reasons to watch this.

1. Rock anthems, ballads and combinations thereof (sung enthusiastically but horribly by everybody except Mary J.)  Any fan of `80s rock will be so totally immersed in the music that you won't notice that the performances give karaoke a bad name.

2. Vertically-challenged Tom Cruise strutting his leathers and furs like he's the biggest, baddest, raunchiest rock star that ever lived.

3. The costumes, the hair, the cell phones, those round black things sold at Tower Records, the promiscuity, and oh yes, the sugar-sappy-sweet romance story-line.

Forget the corny plot, Russell Brand's wig and the minor roles played by major talent and consider this a time capsule from the `80s that crash-landed on a DVD player near you.

4734942,3,B005LAIHRC,"Directed by Adam Shankman of ""Hairspray"" fame, ""Rock of Ages"" is a cinematic version of a Broadway musical of the same title. The film is a tribute to the '80s rock scene, the time of great Twisted Sister, but somehow lacks the power and energy of the same director's previous musical adaptation and its charming heroine Tracy.

Set in 1987, ""Rock of Ages"" starts with Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough), a girl from Oklahoma with a dream of becoming a singer. In LA she meets Drew Boley (Diego Boneta), an aspiring rock singer and song writer, working at a Hollywood club ""The Bourbon Room,"" owned by Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin). The young couple is both likable, and their songs are not bad, but the story is thin, and their characters are bland and hardly fleshed out.

Tom Cruise plays a washed-out rocker Stacee Jaxx. I was not impressed with the vamped-up version of a stereotypical rock star image itself, but Tom Cruise does it with an energy and zeal that is infectious. He steals not only scenes, but the entire film, relegating the romance and success story of the main characters to an unmemorable subplot. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand as the club's manager are also very good, generating some laughs with a few comical dialogues.

Paul Giamatti plays his sleazy manager Paul Gill. Malin kerman is an outspoken Rolling Stone reporter Constance Sack, a ""love interest"" of the legendary rock star. Catherine Zeta-Jones is overzealous Patricia Whitmore protesting against the rock (reference to the 1985 Senatorial hearings). They all turn in deliberately over-the-top performances that are apt for the film's setting, but not good enough to make the film a memorable one.

After all, we - or most of the target audience - still remember the passion and energy of the 80s rock, and the overlong and unfocused film simply does not have it. This is like listening to someone's cover songs when there is the original which is better.",1348963200,6,1942,4.875757575757576
4734943,2,B005LAIHRC,I purchased the movie (which I regret) due to the fact that I thought it was a movie about various bands yet also had good music and a large cast. It did have good music yet I also felt like I was watching Glee gone bad. I could not take myself to watch the entire thing I had to keep fast fowarding some of the songs. You can only take so many talk-sing moments.,1348876800,4,363,3.918918918918919
4734944,5,B005LAIHRC,"Loved this movie! I especially loved the music...I was born in '89 so I missed the whole 80's era but my parents made darn sure I listened and appreciated many old school songs. So this wasn't like the first time I've ever heard this music and I was very surprised (in a good way) that the cast was able to pull them all off so well. As soon as a get paid again I'm buying this soundtrack because I was that impressed.

This is one of those movies where you either love it or you don't, but I absolutely loved it! It was pure entertainment and it's nice to watch a movie and just enjoy instead of worrying about the plot or anything else. Plus, there was great music involved!

4735070,4,B005LAIHRC,"I watched this movie with 2 good girl friends of mine.  We honestly couldn't stop giggling throughout (some of it nervous, some just because and some, well, the dancing says it all). The opening part of the movie was probably the cheesiest; with the bus ride full of common folk and a chipmunk sounding, country girl crooning ""Sister Christian"". The movie abounds with 80's music. All you can pretty much sing along with because of the popularity of them.  Who doesn't know Foreigner, Journey, REO Speedwagon songs?
You've really got to watch it if you love 80's music.  There are some parts that a teen under 16 (IMO) shouldn't watch.  Not much flesh shown, but insinuations out of the wa-zoo. Could have done without a few other choice scenes (one involving Brand and Baldwin and the other with Cruise and Akerman).  Towards the end of the movie, the late 80's song scene throw-in was hil-a-ri-ous!!

Buy the songs by the original artists and skip this waste of time.  The music was the only reason I gave the movie 2 stars.

4735072,1,B005LAIHRC,"Oh boy! Where do I begin?

Honestly, WHERE do I begin? Well, let me say this. The only, and I mean ONLY reason I went to see this movie was because it's a musical. I am a HUGE fan of musicals, especially classics like Singin' in the Rain and An American in Paris. But that's neither here nor there. I've not seen the musical that this ""film"" was based on. But I can already make the judgment that it is a lot better. I heard rather poor reviews of this movie, but I went in the theater hoping to like it.

And.........(sigh) I want to be nice, but this is how nice I can be when summing up this movie.

WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER HAD MY EYES WITNESS!!!

Oh... God do I hate this movie. Now I have seen some bad movies in my lifetime. But as bad as they may be, they don't piss me off. This... piece of rat puke literally made me feel insulted. I'll try to sum up the ""story"" as best or worst that I can.

It's 1987. Dreams and hopes run high for many. Especially young Sherrie Christian (Sister Christian? Get it?)She dreams to be an upcoming singer in Hollywood. Along the way she gets her luggage stolen and a guy named Drew, played by a thankfully unknown and hopefully forgetful to my psyche Diego Boneta, meets her as he tries to get her luggage back. So in an instant, no really, like 30 seconds, they start to hit it off and fall in love. Another of the many subplots in this flick has Russell Brand and, yes, Alec Baldwin trying to pay the bills so their bar/club named The Bourbon won't go out of business. There's also a West Side Story kind of subplot with Catherine Zeta-Jones trying to shut down the bar, as well as protest against the rock star Stacee Jaxx, played by Tom Cruise.

Honestly, it pains me to write this review. I'm sure you're asking ""Then why write it?"" Well, I feel better just showing my pain and frustration through words from my laptop rather than scream my voice out in a boiling rage. As soon as the movie started, I knew that I was in trouble when Julianne Hough's character started to sing Sister Christian. After that, the movie went downhill...fast. Let me first talk about the performances. Julianne Hough is a decent actress and singer, but in terms of her singing, she sounds very nasally. And Sherrie, whom Miss Hough plays, is just your stereotypical supportive girlfriend/dreamer. God, I've seen more creative things done with Styrofoam than I have with her. In a nutshell, Sherrie is an ANNOYING character. Even worse is Diego Boneta as Drew. OH MY GOD! I HATE THIS GUY. Again, his character is the stereotypical boyfriend character who dreams for more in life. He makes the Disney Princesses look like good role models. He is a stupid, annoying, jack@#$! I hate his face, I hate his singing, I hate his character, I hate, hate, HATE him. I've heard things on the internet that girls swoon over Boneta. I don't think that he's that attractive. Bottom line; I LOATHE Diego Boneta's character and I can't stand Boneta himself.

The highlight of the movie is Tom Cruise. I thought that he was brilliant in Tropic Thunder because he manages to blend into the role wonderfully. Here, he does that too. While he isn't as mesmerizing as he was in Tropic Thunder, it's another role he gets lost in and he does a good job. He also has a monkey in the film. That was also a highlight.

Catherine Zeta-Jones is pretty darn bad in this movie. I've seen bits of her in Chicago and I thought she was quite good. Here, her talent is wasted. Just a bad performance, pure and simple. I really liked Russell Brand in this movie. Silly, but fun. I, like everybody else, couldn't take Alec Baldwin seriously in this movie. The moment he and Russell Brand started to sing into a hairbrush, I was done. Paul Giammati, however you say his name, is forgettable, Mary J Blige is wasted in this film, Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame is almost non-existent in this movie, the story is bland, the characters, aside from Tom Cruise's character, are bland, the versions of the songs done in the movie are making Glee look like The Beatles. The movie is just insulting. It's a cliched, formulaic, sloppy story. I should also note that in the beginning of the movie, as Sherrie arrives in Hollywood, I noticed that the filmmakers put the Roosevelt Hotel next to the Capitol Records building. They're insulting geography! I live over the hills from Hollywood, so I have been there so many times. So I managed to notice it instantly. There is also a scene in which Drew is shooting a very dated music video that looks like it was from the 90's. But the wardrobe they were is so laughable, it makes the costumes of Saved by the Bell look like something done by Hubert de Givency. Look him up on Wikipedia. He's a famous costume designer.

This movie hurt my soul. I was laughing, but unintentionally. I was crying inside after it ended because it hurt me to think that this is a movie. Overall, this movie may be the worst thing I have ever seen. If this movie doesn't get nominated for Razzies, then I have no hope or faith in humanity or mankind anymore. Avoid this piece of filth.",1346457600,18,5095,4.446466809421842
4735073,5,B005LAIHRC,"Below is my original review for Rock of Ages.  I just want to add one small note:  I bought the DVD and I also downloaded the movie to my Apple TV through iTunes.  The difference is that the DVD was just like the movie I saw in the theater.  The one I downloaded was the extended version (about 15 additional minutes).  (On iTunes you have both versions to choose from) Either way it's a great movie, but the extended version has 2 scenes that were left out of the theater version, along with several ""little"" things that weren't in the theaters.  The 2 main scenes were of Julianne Hough dancing in a ""dream"" sequence with Diego Boneta, and Julianne and Tom Cruise dancing and singing together.  The dancing actually is a little risqu, but I still think it is really great.  I definitely like the extended version the best.

I went to this movie last night for the 4th time.  I loved it the first time, and every time I see it I love it more than the time before!  I would go see it every day if I could.  Ever since I first heard about it over a year ago I've been counting the days until it came out, although I just couldn't wrap my mind around Tom Cruise as a rock star.  Well, he certainly is!!!  He was sensational as Stacie Jaxx.  Who knew Tom Cruise could, not just sing, but  PERFORM  like that?!?!  And Julianne Hough is amazing!  I've always been in awe of her dancing, and now we find out she can sing and act also!!!  Actually the whole cast was incredible!  I thought the character played by Paul Giamatti was somewhat despicable (I suppose someone had to be) so I could have done without that, but he did play the role really well.  And Russell Brand was hilarious!!!  As for Diego Boneta - I don't know where he came from, but I bet we'll be seeing, and hearing, a lot more of him!  He was GREAT!  Alec Baldwin, Malin Akerman, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mary J Blige, they were all magnificent - as was the movie as a whole!

I thought this movie was beyond GREAT!  The music was already great, but even greater in this movie since all the actors did their own singing!  It's a real ""feel good"" movie.  Not only is it hard to not just get up and dance and sing along while you're watching it, it has you dancing and singing out of the theater!  My mother (who will be 85 next month) even loved it!  She's seen it twice herself!  Everyone should see this movie!  As for the not-so-great reviews it's gotten, either the critics didn't actually see it, or they have a twisted idea of what is just plain ole make-you-feel-good, uplifting, fun - and funny - entertainment!  Believe it or not, there actually are a lot of people who would rather watch something as magnificent as Rock of Ages than a bunch of violence and gore!  I learned years ago not to listen to what critics say.  99% of the time they don't have a clue what they're talking about!

So to wrap it up, it was INCREDIBLE!!!  I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!!!",1344902400,9,2940,4.297445255474453
4735074,5,B005LAIHRC,"Rock of Ages shows Tom Cruise at his best. He completely has the 80s rock and roll persona down. When Tom's character, Stacee Jaxx is on stage, I believe he is a rock star. He has all the rock star moves and the rock star voice. I am so impressed with Tom's singing in this movie. Now whenever I hear Pour Some Sugar on Me, Wanted Dead or Alive, or Paradise City, I hear Tom's voice in my head, not Joe Elliot, Jon Bon Jovi, or Axl Rose. Tom has completely changed how people remember the 80s. Tom has brought 80s music back to the forefront. I have seen the movie four times and I never get sick of it.

His singing is awesome and he plays the overy the top performer so well (what a surprise). The music was great, I was downloading it from I-Tunes halfway through the movie.

4735098,2,B005LAIHRC,"Wow! I actually watched my youth destroyed tonight. Virtually every song I ever loved was butchered by a nasal Julianna Hough. Diego Boneta, a name I had never heard before tonight wasn't too bad. The scene with Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand singing, ""Candle in the Wind"" by REO Speedwagon was the final nail in my coffin. Although they were not half bad, it was disturbing. That song was an anthem of love for teen girls in the 80's. I don't think I will ever get that image out of my head. Tom Cruise's character Stacy Jaxx reminded me of what I think he would be like in real life, a total space cadet.

I had not idea it was a musical when I got there. I now understand it was a musical, but is there such a thing as too much music in a musical? I had to laugh or I would have cried. I am not sure if this was supposed to be a tribute to the 80's or if it was meant to mock everything that was fun about the 80's. At least my son and I had a good laugh. I plan to buy the dvd for people in my life that I want to ruin their youth too. I expect it to sell for less than a dollar.",1343088000,7,1083,3.8565022421524664
4735099,5,B005LAIHRC,"It's funny as I look at the reviews of Rock of Ages, both in Amazon and other venues.  I would venture to say anyone who hated it did not grow up in the 80s, and truthfully, the movie primarily meant for that audience, those who were in their teens and early 20s in the late 80s.  Basically, this movie is the soundtrack to my childhood, and that is the feeling it evokes.  I titled a review of this film elsewhere as a glorious celebration of decadence and excess, which is the perfect way to describe the hair metal 80s.  After rock went through its self-important phase (Music for the Elder, BOC, Pink Floyd, David Bowie and Led Zep imagery) and punk phases, they went straight to the self-indulgent phase, and that is what this film so gloriously depicts.  The music is wonderful, but you had to be a hair metal afficionado, and I would say those who hated the film did not like this type of music.  It really is associated with a bygone lifestyle that Cobain and the dirtballs of grunge (although I will admit, I DO like the music) brounght to an ignoble and untimely end.  This hearkens back to a more innocent, or at least less cynical, age when the greatest threat to rock n roll was the PMRC (If you don't know, look it up) and Jerry Falwell.  This is so obviously a charicature on an age that is a caricature of itself.  Tom Cruise is pefectly cast as a rock god so narcissistic, he is almost in love with himself.  Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are quite funny as the hapless owners of the hottest nightclub on the LA Strip (basically a thinly-veiled reference to the real Whiskey a Go Go) and Catherine Zeta Jones is great as the outraged crusader against the Satanic influence of rock.  Finally Paul Giamatti puts in his regular great performance as the sleazy record company guy.  Everyone is obviously having fun in this pic, and since it is a musical, its heightened unrealness just adds to the charm of a nostalgic look back in time.  If you can't take it tongue firmly planted in cheek, don't bother.  But otherwise, treat yourself.  It is a hoot.",1343088000,4,2066,4.457446808510638
4735100,1,B005LAIHRC,"I had pretty low expectations for ""Rock of Ages"" as it's based on a fairly insipid jukebox Broadway musical that I similarly found to be a waste of time.  The hair band rock of the 1980s is so easy to mock and ridicule that almost everyone has taken a shot at it; what more can you add?  The answer is not much.  The premise of ""Rock of Ages"" is as bland and predictable mix of sex, drugs, and rock n roll as well as hopes and dreams.  Sherrie Christian (Sister Christian anyone?) hails from Tulsa and hopes to break into the Hollywood music scene.  In a predictable and contrived scene barback Drew Boley tries to thwart a robber from stealing Sherrie's belongings and suddenly the two are together.  It almost sounds like a musical...oh wait...it is!  And it doesn't get better from there.  From there an endless array of characters are introduced which only serves to muddle things and at the same time plays into the whole predictability.  Club owners trying desperately to save their club, if only people could embrace rock, but curses, they need something new and innovative.  A famous rocker agrees to a performance to help wipe out his debts.  The complications and plot lines multiply from there and despite a fairly all-star cast they aren't given much to do and most seem to be either on autopilot or ridiculously overdoing it.  Oddly enough, the only person capable of reining in the crazy is Tom Cruise in the role of rocker Stacee Jaxx, who plays the role with aplomb yet keeps it from going over the top.  Clearly Cruise is trying to rehabilitate his box office poison image and goes a long ways towards that here, but even he can't help salvage this dud.  I'm not even going to both with the plot and how the movie unfolds except to say it defines by-the-numbers predictability right up to the finale which you could pretty much have guessed in the first 15 minutes of the film.  Even if you like 1980s hair band metal this movie is going to bore you as no one wants to pay to see actors essentially doing upscale karaoke, and bad karaoke at that.  Change the music and you could have had ""Golddiggers of 1933"" ""Singing in the Rain"" or ""A Chorus Line"".  I was bored stiff at the 30 minute mark and honestly, it didn't get better from there.  There is absolutely nothing about ""Rock of Ages"" I can recommend or which redeems it.  I should have taken the words of Dee Synder and said ""We're Not Gonna Take It!""",1343001600,10,2424,4.493150684931507

I use to work stage crew for a lot of rock stars and rock and roll bands and this movie nailed it as far as their life on the road. This movie was a lot of fun for me. Russell Brand was a perfect fit for his roll and the times!! Loved the newcomer (Diego Boneta) he is hot.,1341964800,,395,3.5517241379310347
4735102,5,B005LAIHRC,"Disclaimer: I loved Mamma Mia!

I was excited about this movie based on the music/era alone. I wasn't disappointed.

It's silly, funny, ridiculous, over-the-top, and goofy. And it's an absolute blast.

I was incredibly skeptical of Tom Cruise in this movie. But you know what? He. Was. Awesome. Made the movie for me (along with Hey Man LOL)

Can you believe I didn't know Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand were in it? Both of them were terrific as well, and did not disappoint.

I'm not overly familiar with Julianne Hough, outside of the Footloose remake, and I've never heard of Diego Boneta, but he was cute and I thought he did a good job.

I really liked this movie, so much so that I went back a week+ later and saw it again. I can't wait to buy it, so hurry up and release it, New Line Cinema!

Don't go into this expecting Oscar-worthy performances; you'll be disappointed. But if you go expecting fun and laughs? You're good. People need to chill out and not think every movie should be some life-changing experience. Sometimes stuff can be so bad it's great, and this is one of those things. Love it!",1341878400,8,1108,4.51
4735103,1,B005LAIHRC,"It started out pretty bad.  But every time I thought, ""Well, at least it can't get any worse,"" it managed to do just that.  With the exception of Tom Cruise (sorry, but I can't stand the sight of him), I like most of the actors and actresses in this movie.  However, there's a reason that most of the actors and actresses in this movie don't typically star in musicals -- they can't sing.  I winced.  I groaned.  I put my head back on the seat and closed my eyes.  I couldn't wait for the torture to end.  Fortunately, my friend spilled a large soda all over herself, and we had to leave about twenty minutes before it ended.

Personally, I can't figure why they'd cast Tom Cruise in the lead role in the first place.  Sebastian Bach or Jon Bon Jovi would have been better substitutes, IMO.  Sebastian Bach had the lead (stage) role in, ""Jesus Christ, Superstar"" for a while and Jon Bon Jovi has acted as a secondary character in many films -- they both can sing, they're both pretty hot, and they both were part of the 80's rock music era.  Tom Cruise?  80's rock star?  Really?  Ew.

I originally thought this would be like the movie, ""Rock Star"" with Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Anniston, which I kind of liked.  I thought it would be a movie with a kick-a$$ soundtrack of original recordings as opposed to covers by people who can't sing.  And EVEN IF the singing had been better, I still would have perceived the movie as a spoof, mocking the 80's music era.  What can I say, except that it was my friend's turn to choose -- I wanted to see, ""Brave.""",1341705600,13,1554,4.333333333333333
4735104,4,B005LAIHRC,"I just love this movie! At this time, it is still playing in the theater and I've seen it three times. I'm an 80's kid so, I guess it really speaks to me, but, besides that, the movie just has this energy that pulsates off the screen.

Like with all musicals, especially cheesy ones like this, there are some songs I like, and some I don't.

But Tom Cruise is wonderful as Stacee Jaxx, the aging heavy metal rock star. I also think the Rolling Stone reporter he falls in love with is absoluetly stunning. I just love her Glenn Close, Fatal Attraction, hair! God, she's hot!

Her duet, with Cruise ('I want to know what love is') is so campy, sexy and fun that it hurts! The first time I saw it, I thought it was okay, and rather corny, but the second time, it really grew on me. I got where the film makers were going. The third time, was definitely the charm! I love how the song builds, and their sexual excitement rises! ('Let's talk about...looove! I wanna feel it, too! Wanna feeeel it, toooo!') Yummy. And sort of naughty.

Catherine Zeta Jone's 'Hit me with your best shot!' number, set in a church..(!).. to Michael Jackson-style dancing..(!?) is so 'over-the-top' that, after watching it, I had to ask myself, 'Did that just really freakin' happen?' This scene stayed with me way after leaving the theater, causing me to rush back, the next day, to watch it again. I'm not kidding.

Jeeze! Holy cow, Batman! Not since 'Xanadu','Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club' 'Earth Girls are Easy' and, yes, 'From Justin to Kelly' has dancing and singing on the silver screen been so strange, and, well, sort of twisted. Almost at times, nightmarish. But, in a good way. Kinda.

The scenes with Mary J.Blige singing in her club while strippers dance and twirl on poles behind her to ,'Shadows of the Night' and 'Anyway you want it' has to be seen to believe. It's like a sexed-up circus performance. Two more scenes that had me running back to see it again.

The two young leads are so cute and sweet that you can almost smell the cotton candy. Maybe, taste it, too.

I just loooove Drew's hair! Sooo thick and wavy like chocolate frosting. And his 'Juxebox Hero' song, in the record store with Sherri, is just way cool and spunky! Love the star-framed shades, boy!

I also enjoyed their 'Waiting for a girl like you.' montage as they meet up for their first date behind the famous Hollywood sign. Oh, and Sherri spraying her 'big' hair with Aqua-Net while Drew sprays himself, down....there, with perfume, is pretty darn hot, in a cotton candy kind of way. Shades of 'Grease' come rolling like thunder during these scenes. (Summer Nights, Sandy, Hopelessly Devoted..)

The only big gripe I have, aside from the annoying scenes with Stacee Jax's manager, (those scenes really drag down the film's mojo, in my opinion) is, after listening to the movie's soundtrack, I discovered that the 'Rock you like a Hurricane' number, with Jax and Sherri..(!?)..has apparently been cut out of the film! Why!? 'Hurricane' is one of my all time favorite rock songs from the 80's. The song is just so, angry, and...alive! Why remove it from the film but yet have it on the soundtrack? Last minute tampering, no doubt.

By the way,is this the infamous scene where Sherri does a lap dance for Tom Cruise that was cut from the movie? And, if it was, where did it fit in with the rest of the story? Did Stacee come to the strip club where Sherri was working? Is it just a fantasy scene? Did it happen early on at The Bourbon Club?

Just like Drew shouts in the movie...'I wanna Rock!' 'I wanna know!' What is up with this deleted scene and if it is, the 'Rock you like a Hurricane' number. Is it in the original broadway production? I guess I have to look it up, and do a little research. Unless, someone out there knows and can fill me in. Any feedback on this missing scene, or any others, would be helpful. Thanx....

I read somewhere that it will be included on the director's DVD cut, and, well, that's just wrong. It smells like a gimmick to me. Just to make more money. 'Hey, if you want to see Sherri strip for Tom', you have to buy the DVD when it comes out. Boooo! That's pretty lame. Granted, I will be buying the DVD off Amazon when it comes out, it's just, watching the deleted scenes on TV, just isn't the same as watching it up on the big screen.

Also, it is a little disappointing that they didn't play the song 'Oh, Sherri' in the movie. (briefly playing the intro while Drew was thinking about Sherri,just didn't cut it for me.) Steve Perry's 'Oh, Sherri' is a song you just don't hear much anymore these days on the radio. It would've been refreshing to hear Drew sing it to his girl, somewhere, sometime in the movie, even if it was just part of the song.

Okay...I'm finished. For now. Until I start obsessing over the next poor movie that comes my way. And, I will. Being the movie freak that I am. Thanx for reading..........Kevin BriaN",1341446400,36,4937,4.488294314381271
4735105,5,B005LAIHRC,"Okay, there are two points to this review. The first is for everyone who HAS NOT SEEN IT: THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!
It is very fun to watch, and if you know any of the songs, don't be afraid to sing them aloud in the theater. Chances are someone else will join you/has already started. Its quite fun. The actors do a great job of singing, and I actually like some of the tracks done here more than the originals. I took my father to this, a teen-20s in the 80s, and he was SOOOO excited to go, and we've seen it twice, want to GO AGIAN, and we BOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK AS SOON AS WE LEFT the theater the first night.
I'm going to get this on blu-ray the day it comes out.
Just to warn some of you, IF YOU ARE CONSERVATIVE, be careful when you watch this movie. I personally thought the ""risque/racy"" scenes were hilarious, and I enjoyed them, however I know some people would think them innapropriate.

FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WRITE REVIEWS:
Seriously? Do you really have nothing better to do than point out what you think are ""flaws"" in this movie? So what if its an ""adaptation?"" DO YOU KNOW WHAT ADAPTATION MEANS? It means its NOT THE SAME.
I went to ERAGON the night of its premier. I had waited 2 YEARS to see it. I took a survey that night, and being a fan of the books, I wrote how excited I was, that the author was a genius, how I had waited two years, all my expectations...
Then I watched it.
And I was ROYALLY PISSED.
I could not believe how much they ruined it.
And I told them so. But later I realized that I should have watched it like it wasn't related. Because its an ""ADAPTATION.""

You should know before you go in that its 80s music. If you don't like the movie AS ITS OWN PRODUCTION, then you can say so. But separate the two.
The Sound of Music is remembered for Julie Andrews Edwards, not for it being a musical and a movie.
They are separate entities.

On a final note, I personally was not a fan of the female lead either, however, that's who they chose, they stuck with it, and it still turned out to be a FABULOUS movie.

********EDIT********
THIS IS FOR THE EXTENDED EDITION
For those of you who MUST HAVE everything ""EXTENDED EDITION"" then go ahead. There are some great extra scenes that would have been cool in the original cut. HOWEVER: this is not true of the entirety of the extended edition, in which you must watch THE ENTIRE COLLECTION of the extra scenes. MOST OF WHICH actually TAKE AWAY from the magic of the movie, and almost ruin it.
So be warned, watch the theatrical version first, and make sure it is the one you share with your friends.
The extended version is IMHO not worth the time, and brings less enjoyment than the theatrical version.",1341446400,5,2676,4.272189349112426
4735106,4,B005LAIHRC,"This has to be one of my favorite summers for movies in years. There has been such an amazing variety and now we have a Rock-N-Roll Musical amongst the superheroes, aliens and action stars.

""Rock of Ages"" is an adaption of a Broadway rock comedy musical that debuted as on off-Broadway production in 2008 but made its debut in Los Angeles 2005. Constantine Maroulis of American Idol fame played the lead character, Drew Boley, in the Broadway production and has a cameo role in the film. Diego Boneta takes on that role in the film. He is probably one of the lesser known of the cast that includes Julianne Hough, Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Mary J. Blige, Catherine Zeta Jones, Malin Ackerman and Tom Cruise as legendary rock god Stacee Jaxx, a role without question inspired by Guns-N-Roses front man Axel Rose.

The movie and the play are set back in the late 80's when Rock-N-Roll was decadent and king. Dennis Dupree (Baldwin), owns the rock club The Bourbon Room that I can only assume is based on the real rock club The Whiskey in Los Angeles. Sherrie Christian (Hough) is an Oklahoma girl who takes the bus to Los Angeles to pursue her Hollywood dreams. Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) is a legendary rock star who is lost in a sea of scotch, decadence and his own persona. Drew Boley (Boneta) is a bartender who is a rising star. All of these characters come together to form the story.

There is nothing unique about the storyline to the film. All of the stories that mold together are pretty clich and predictable. The romances that form and the dilemma's faced and dealt with have been seen and done before. Yet, the truth is, the movie isn't about the stories that are formed during the course of the movie by the actors. The movie is a love affair with a Rock-N-Roll age that ruled in the late 80's and has since been forgotten in an age of boy bands, studio-enhanced albums and conformity.

""Rock of Ages"" is a homage to the decadence and freedom of Rock-N-Roll. Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) embodies all of the things that defined a generation of rock stars and also make complete fun of it. The movie is fun, hilarious and had a guy like me, who graduated high school the very year that this movie takes place in, grinning throughout, remembering all of it and inside my head, singing along with all the unforgettable songs.

""Rock of Ages"" is similar in style to the television show ""Glee"", but with all of the seediness and debauchery of an age of music that got lost in the shuffle somewhere.",1341446400,2,2499,4.556792873051225
4735107,3,B005LAIHRC,"If you've been anywhere near a television this week, you have probably been inundated with previews for the newest Broadway-show-turned-flick Rock of Ages. You were probably either convinced or put off by the lead billing of Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx, so let's tackle that first. Cruise portrayed Jaxx as if he were the son of Lestat from Interview with the Vampire and Guns 'n' Roses lead singer, Axl Rose with twice the libido of both.

Cruise was unconvincing as Jaxx, and I wondered if real-life wife Katie Holmes had any qualms with the number of tongues that touched her husband's body during this film. Jaxx's costumes are outlandish and silly, particularly a certain codpiece, and I couldn't tear my eyes away from his tattoos. He is a typical rock star in that he is never fully conscious, and he enjoys wrecking things that don't belong to him. Also, he tends to drink...a lot. That being said, Jaxx does not carry the entire film, as the trailers might have you believe. If you are not a fan of Cruise's, there are plenty of other characters to entertain you. If you are a fan of his, then you will probably enjoy laughing at Jaxx's expense, which is what he also seems won't to do.

Now that we've got that out of the way, if you were a fan of hair bands, Pat Benetar and arena rock, then this is the musical for you. Rock of Ages is jam-packed with '80s music, and does mash-ups and mini-montages equally well. You'll hear tunes from such bands as Bon Jovi, Guns 'n' Roses, Def Leppard, Foreigner, Journey, Poison, Whitesnake, Night Ranger, Twisted Sister and REO Speedwagon, amongst others.

Rock of Ages tells the same story we've seen in Coyote Ugly and numerous other films in which the main character is a woman from a small town who flees to a bigger town with dreams of making it big, yadda, yadda, yadda. Along the way, she meets a guy and falls in love. Cue montage of happy moments. Then, some kind of misunderstanding breaks them up and they are both lost without each other, only to reunite at the end of the film. There is nothing in this plot that we haven't seen before. But then, in a film like this, plot is just the glue that holds the music together.

The appropriately named Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) is a blonde bombshell from Oklahoma who looks like a groupie but acts like a good girl. She, of course, dreams of making it big in Hollywood. She gets mugged on her first night in California, and the sexier-with-longer-hair Drew (Diego Boneta) is conveniently there to witness it. He attempts to help her to no avail, but feels equally bad for and attracted to her, so he offers her a job at ""The Bourbon Room"", the nightclub where he works. She eagerly accepts as a waitress, although she dreams of being a singer.

Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin) runs ""The Bourbon Room"" with Lonny (Russell Brand), and their presence reminded me of Empire Records if we had checked in on Joe and Lucas in ten years. One scene in particular between Baldwin and Brand was rather humorous and harkened back to the ""Hello"" scene in Harold and Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay. When all else fails, homosexual humor tends to deliver.

What follows is a typical love story that would occur in a film of this type, or even in an '80s film (maybe that was the point?). The wholly uninteresting subplot involves Catherine Zeta Jones as the tacky antagonist Patricia Whitmore, wife to Mayor Mike Whitmore (Bryan Cranston), who has a predictable agenda against Stacee Jaxx and his ""devil music"". She gathers some of the conservative women in town and they band together to picket ""The Bourbon Room"" and Jaxx.

Paul Giamatti as Paul Gill, Stacee's manager, turned in the best performance of the film. He was the most convincing and enjoyable in a sea of cheesiness, weak acting and mediocrity. And we certainly saw enough close-ups of Malin Ackerman's (Constance Sack) clothed naughty bits to last us a while. Mary J. Blige has a throwaway part as the manager of a strip club, which could have shaved off some of the two hour and three minute runtime.

All in, the performances were weak and cheesy, the dubbing did not quite match the lip syncing and the plot was nothing to write home to your mother about. But the love story drew me in, the music was entertaining and enjoyable and I wouldn't think twice about seeing this film again. When we think back on the '80s, we often squirm at memories of big hair, loud clothes and quirky music. If Rock of Ages wasn't cheesy, it wouldn't be doing its job.",1341273600,3,4517,4.60248447204969

4735168,5,B005LAIHRC,"I just saw this the other day and feel it will be worth the money.  Screen adaptations of Broadway shows are never the same as the stage version, so you have to keep it in mind.  It is a really great story, though told in a comical way(and sometimes slightly disturbing), with the core of it being true to yourself and never giving up on dreams.  That is what being an artist is about, and considering I am an actor and musician, I know.  I feel that this is an encouraging and uplifting story.  It actually reminded me of why I started writing music in the first place.  As far as the characters, they are brilliantly portrayed, but the absolute best portrayals are the two leads, played by Julianne Hough(who plays Sherri Christian) and Diego Boneta(who plays Drew).  Tom Cruise was ok in his performance, but I could have thought of better actors for that role.  Alec Baldwin was surprisingly good as the ex-rocker turned bar owner, and Russell Brand, who I rarely like, was actually quite good.  Paul Giamatti's portrayal of the sleaze ball manager just wanted to make me jump on the screen and knock him out.  Overall, this is a really great comedy musical.  While I know I will not likely get to see it on Broadway anytime soon, I know I will be going to the production on NCL's Norwegian Breakaway, since I am sold on the show now(top 3 favorite musicals of all time).",1341100800,2,1375,4.481927710843373

Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta star as the two wanna-be rock stars. Oh if they could just get their break....

The music is both the plus and minus side to the film. It comes across as a movie which upholds the standards of rock, but succumbs to the evils such as lip syncing and mistaking glam rock for heavy metal. I enjoyed the cliche filled predictable story. The seasoned veterans of the film seemed to have enjoyed making this production as it lacks any seriousness. I spent most of the movie waiting for the talking to get over and the next song to begin. My biggest problem with this film was believing the character of heavy metal rock star Stacee Jaxx which rhymes too much with Terry Jacks (Seasons in the Sun). The could have done better.

PARENTAL GUIDE: 1 f-bomb, no nudity other than butt cheeks. There are a number of suggestive/kinky scenes, such as a spanking, undressing, a near grope, stage dancing, and near or suggestive sex.

When I did see ""Rock of Ages"" I realized Tom was not the main lead, but he still stole every scene he was in and his voice was amazing. Probably unlike any role he's done before Tom saved the movie due to his acting and vocal ability, but the movie did become panned by critics and became a box office flop only making $33,000,000 as of June 26th, 2012 on a budget of $75,000,000.

 The script is far from original as Tom plays a singer who's parade and career is passing him by as he encounters a new up and coming singer who wants all the money and glamor fame can attain.

 There are some pretty big heavy-weights seen in other roles including Alex Baldwin and Mary J. Blidge who are really wasted.

 Still, see the film if you love Tom Cruise and '80's music.",1340668800,2,983,4.229946524064171
4735174,5,B005LAIHRC,Thought this was such a fun movie.  I think it is completely an opinion. If you go and see with that idea it will be fun.  Russell Brand had some funny spots.  Yes there was some really corny spots...but so what it was fun!,1340236800,,223,4.0227272727272725
4735175,5,B005LAIHRC,"Adam Shankman struck gold with the movie musical ""Hairspray"" some years ago, and now he has released his first movie musical since, the similarly star-driven, but completely different ""Rock of Ages"". This film, like ""Hairspray"", is based on a popular Broadway musical, but the big difference is that this is a jukebox musical, using songs made famous by big names from the 1980's glam metal scene, such as Journey, Foreigner, Def Leppard, Twisted Sister, Poison and Pat Benetar.  In my opinion, this film didn't feel as fresh as ""Hairspray"" did years ago, but it really didn't need to. It's decadent, beautiful, delightfully trashy, sentimental and heartfelt when it needs to be, exponentially silly and delightful the entire way through. The energy of its wonderful cast is inescapable and exuberant.

The storyline is all over the place - clearly disjointed and unorganized, but I don't go see musicals expecting a fantastic story, so that can be forgiven. The musical numbers are completely top notch. I had been against mash-ups in musical theater and film, since the American public will more than likely associate a mash-up with something trying to be ""Glee"" or trying to be a rip-off of that horrible TV show. It's important for me to mention right here that this show was on Broadway long before ""Glee"" became a thing. It was awesome then and it's awesome now.

The story follows the young and naive Sherrie (Julianne Hough) who moves to Los Angeles from some small town in the height of the hair/glam metal scene in 1987. She meets and falls in love with city boy Drew (Diego Boneta). She works with him at The Bourbon Room, which is basically a fictitious version of CBGB's. Dennis (Alec Baldwin) and Lonny (Russel Brand) own the club, which is getting alot of attention during rockstar Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise)'s band's last show. The uppity religious conservative wife of the mayor (Catherine Zeta Jones) wants to shut the club down. And a whole bunch of other stuff happens too. Like I said, the story isn't that organized.

Each actor of this ensemble displays irresistible energy, no matter how small or unimportant-seeming their role might be. For example, take Mary J Blige, who plays a character so small, I didn't catch her name. She's an R&B singer who took acting lessons for this film. Once her character is introduced more than halfway into the film, they use her terrific singing voice every chance they get. She had a lot of enthusiasm, and without the enthusiasm that the film's smaller actors provided, the final product of this film would not have been as satisfying as it was.

Julianne Hough from ""Dancing with the Stars"" and recent movie musicals ""Burlesque"" and ""Footloose"" does a fine job. She isn't anything incredible or revolutionary, but she does her job fairly well and she has good enthusiasm, even as an actress, not just a singer. Her love interest Drew, played by Diego Boneta is pretty extraordinary, however. He has top-notch singing abilities, and his character is immediately likable whenever the film begins. I'm quite glad they didn't use anyone from the Disney stock for this role, like Zac Efron or one of the Jonas brothers. It so easily could have been done wrong.

I'm not too fond of Tom Cruise, I think he's a highly overrated actor who in general isn't all that great. However, he does an excellent job as Stacee Jaxx, the fictitious ""rock god"" who has done some wonderful work in music years before, but doesn't know what to do with his life anymore. I'm not really sure which singer Cruise was channeling in this role, but he pretty much sums up what the decade meant for rock `n roll. Jaxx is a womanizing, heavy-drinking, lying, cheating sleazeball, like so many stars of that era were. But the surprising part is that Tom Cruise can really, and I mean really sing, particularly evidenced by his fantastic rendition of ""Wanted Dead or Alive"".

It's so great to see that after all of these years, Catherine Zeta-Jones is still Velma Kelly. As the film's main antagonist, she plays a great character to scowl at, however her singing abilities are a bit underused, as she only sings two songs in the film. Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand have alot of fun playing characters that might surprise you. I never really pictured either of them as a singer, but they somehow pull it off, and so does Malin Akerman, who also plays a smaller role, but does a nice job with what she has.

While the story of ""Rock of Ages"" leaves a bit to be desired, and the movie heavily differs from the play that inspired it, I found myself wanting to sing along to the music, and I was in awe of the choreography and vocal ranges of the fantastic cast. The story could have been strung together in a way that didn't suggest that it only existed so the selected songs could be sung, but that's about the only thing I found wrong with it, and with a musical that has a set list as fantastic as this one, it's easy to overlook. Just like the poster suggests, it really is ""nothin' but a good time""!

4735176,4,B005LAIHRC,"Julianne Hough (co-star of last year's ""Footloose"") plays a fresh-faced small town girl who puts her motor in and goes to the big city to find love.  Arriving there, she's befriended by Diego Bonata, a young hottie with aspirations as a singer/songwriter/rock star, who gets her a job as a waitress at the Bourbon Club.  Tom Cruise comes out of hibernation to play Stacee Jaxx, a rock legend whose reputation is eclipsed only by his ego.  Cruise is good, but at times seems to be in a different movie: his demeanor stays smolderingly dour, while everyone else's is resolutely chipper.  Alec Baldwin plays the owner of the on-the-skids Bourbon Club, which gave Stacee his first break, and Russell Brand plays himself (at which he is rather good).  Paul Giamatti plays  Stacee's slimy manager, and the other bad guy is Catherine Zeta-Jones, a Tipper Gore-like figure, who is leading a protest against music that ""rapes"" today's youngsters.  In the end, of course, the power of rock and roll proves the ultimate healer and unites friend and foe alike.

""Rock of Ages,"" is an equal opportunity offender; its targets include feminists, homophobes, and people with discerning musical taste.  Based on a musical, it does have very important messages about censorship, following your dream despite discouragement, etc., but they aren't hammered home, and you can just enjoy the music, and snicker at the Tonka Truck sized cells, abundance of acid wash and mousse abuse.  Mary J. Blige has a small role, too, and seems to be enjoying herself, although after hearing her, it's too bad that she's too old to play the Hough role.  In all, it's decent summer entertainment.",1340150400,,1660,4.956678700361011
