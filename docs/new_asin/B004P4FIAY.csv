8605124,5,B004P4FIAY,"This video delivers what it advertises.  The woman who is the main teacher is middle aged (as am I) and seems secure with that; she is in fantastic shape but doesn't find the need to wear skin tight clothing to show it. The other teachers and participants are everyday people as well.  The teachers show hooping techniques from different angles (side and front) and show the techniques without rushing through them.  The only ""needs improvement"" point I would mention would be the video itself's need for a better table of contents.  You have to fast forward,etc. through segments in the main menu if you don't want to watch them all or if you want to skip around.  I'm sure this would have added to the cost of the DVD, however, and, right now, it is perfectly priced.  I'm very glad I ordered it.",1372118400,4,798,4.545454545454546
