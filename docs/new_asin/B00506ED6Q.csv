8463315,3,B00506ED6Q,There are better DVDs to get. This had some interesting moments but overall it's not worth the price. There's not really that much by way of insight about the Choir and other DVD's have better performance footage. America's Choir documentary is more interesting (and that had it's dry moments).,1383696000,,294,5.020408163265306
