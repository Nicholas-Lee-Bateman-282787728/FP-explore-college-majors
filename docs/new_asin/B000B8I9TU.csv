8083404,4,B000B8I9TU,"So I've been a big fan of Area 88 ever since the original anime came out in the 80's. It had a gripping plotline, superb character development, and great combat scenes. Too bad they made only one of the three volumes into a DVD.

I was extremely elated at the news that ADV films was going to remake Area 88. After I watched the entire series, I must admit that I was a little disappointed, but found it still very entertaining to watch, and that's the reason why I still give it a 4.

There were a couple of things about the new series that I did not like. First of all, the original series was rated MA, meaning it was meant for the mature viewers. The blood, violence, nudity, and language all added to the dark, desperate tone of the original series. However, with the new Area 88 series, the rating was a TVPG. Not even a TV PG-13. Wow, this change took a lot out from what I believe the original creator had intended. I felt like it was a watered-down version of the original series.

Secondly, the new series had new characters and left out some of the old characters from the original series. I actually liked the new characters a lot. They added a lot to the plot and discreetly revealed some key elements about the main character, Shin Kazama. However, the mere fact that some of the original characters were taken out infuriated me. They had contributed so much in terms of character development and unfolding of some of the mysteries in the story.

Having said that, I do not want to judge this series in comparison to the original series. Instead, I rate it on its own at 4.

I still recommend watching this anime. It's a great series.",1150934400,2,1648,4.390163934426229
8083405,3,B000B8I9TU,"I think that Area 88 deserves some respect considering that it's the first anime to really go into the spectrum of modern (or near-modern) air combat.  The dogfighting sequences are fast paced, if not too unrealistic, and will satiate almost any aviation buff.  That being said, there are a few low points as well.

Being only 12 episodes long, the main plot is built very quickly, rushed actually, with time wasted in small single-show subplots, more especially early on.  It's not until disc 2 that you really learn what's going on, and disc 3 finally expands on that.  Disc 3 felt pretty much like 2 or 1; great air to air action certainly, but the plot forced into 12 episodes makes the viewer less empathetic with the main and supporting characters.

All in all, if you're a fighter jet fan and would like a show with that Top Gun feel to it, more luster; fast '60s and '70s-era planes blasting one another out of the sky, and less plot line, or less pronounced plot line, more correctly, than by all means, this is for you.  If you're more into plots and complex storylines, you might want to pass this one over.  If you're part of that later party, but have a real affection for fighter aircraft, you will probably still find a good deal of enjoyment in this show.",1137283200,,1271,4.5196506550218345
