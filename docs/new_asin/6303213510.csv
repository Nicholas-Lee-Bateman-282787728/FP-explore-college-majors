594005,3,6303213510,"I feel bad for rating this documentary 3 stars because it is really sad. I remember seeing this years ago on PBS and it really scared me, but made me aware of the effects from AIDS. These two men showed courage, humanity, humor and yes, love for one another.",1315353600,2,258,4.285714285714286
594006,5,6303213510,"As a gay man born in 1979, I grew up in the shadow of AIDS, but my generation was too young to experience firsthand the epidemic of illness and death that swept through the gay community in the '80s and early '90s. I've never had to watch a close friend or loved one get sick and wither away from this illness. In a sense, my generation of gay men is very fortunate. We know about safe sex, how to avoid HIV, and if we do become positive, there are life-saving treatments available. But on the other hand, because we didn't witness the epidemic of the '80s and '90s, many younger gay men have never had to face the realities of AIDS. AIDS is rarely a major news story in the American media anymore unless it concerns the African AIDS epidemic. We don't see images of AIDS sufferers. I watched this film because I wanted to see what AIDS really looks like.

The images in this film affected me more deeply than any film I've ever seen. It doesn't surprise me that this is a relatively unknown and obscure documentary; it's simply too real and too sad. It's one of the few films I've seen that dares to look directly at death. The men in this film were incredibly brave and noble souls who documented their suffering so that the world could see the effects of this disease. This film should be required viewing for any young gay man who thinks AIDS is ""over"" or that it is a ""manageable disease"".",1264723200,7,1394,4.361538461538461
594007,5,6303213510,"In the summer of 1993 I had just graduated high school from a small rural farming community and was deeply in the closet.  One July night I turned on PBS and caught Silverlake Life about 1/4 of the way through and watched through to the end.  I cried hard for so many reasons.  Until that point, I had never seen a loving gay relationship before in my sheltered existence.  I didn't even know that it was possible, yet here it was right in front of me.  For the first time I believed that maybe love was possible for me, and maybe there were options for me that I never knew existed.  That weight lifted off my heart owned half of the emotion I was feeling.  The other half was reserved for the fact of the inevitability of the situation at hand.  Experiencing the loss along with them, quite vividly at that, helped me come to an understanding of life's up and downs, and how it is meant to be lived no matter what the circumstances.  This move was also the first documentary I ever watched, and began a life-long obsession with good documentary films.  Definitely one to watch and own.",1241049600,6,1087,4.39
594008,5,6303213510,"This movie is the astoundingly real story of one couple's life and death with AIDS.  It is a raw, painful and heartbreakingly touching love story that everyone needs to see.",1228435200,2,173,4.766666666666667
594009,5,6303213510,"Being your basic ""guy"", I can remember the documentaries I've seen that have made me cry - there are maybe half a dozen.

This one made me bawl.  There's very little in the history of the moving image that can touch this treatment of love.

There's a simple, terrible trajectory here as these two men take us through the last days of their lives.  They are bright and funny, charming company - they are also two of the strongest men I've ever seen on film.

I kept wondering: ""What would I do?  If I was them...  If they were my loved ones...""

Sit down, hold someone close and watch.  It just may re-shape how you see love, liberation and loss.",1180051200,8,645,4.308333333333334
594010,5,6303213510,"I stumbled upon this documentary not too long ago on DVD and watched it this past weekend. It is a deeply moving story of Tom and Mark, two gay men who have been together for 22 years and are slowly dying of AIDS. Their lives are shown raw and uncensored. We see them for who they--two deeply caring and loving human beings just trying to cope, understand, and triumph in this mystery called Life. We also see how a horrible disease, such as AIDS, slowly ravages one's mind and body. But I think the most one can take from this documentary is the simple truth of Love, and, living the most of each day. You can not help but cry and realize how foolish we really all are with our materialistic obsessions of money, vainity, celebrities, and other nonsense. Interwoven with the lives of these two special men, we also see glimpses of such simple things--a walk in a garden, the inspiring beauty of a blooming flower, the sight of a humming bird in flight, the comfort found in their pet cat as Tom's mother seeks solace after seeing her son die. It is the simple and pure things in life, like Love and the beauty of Life, that matter. Thank you Tom and Mark for reminding us.",1076198400,30,1173,4.385321100917431
594011,5,6303213510,"One night I was up late flipping through stations when I found this playing on the Sundance channel. Like many of the reviewers before me, I was just going to watch a little until something better came on. However, after 5 minutes I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and my heart and emotions were 100% into this couple dealing with AIDS. At the end of this movie I cried as though these people were friends of mine. It touched me so much I have spent months trying to find its name. If you haven't seen it- BUY NOW! This documentary is a true life lesson for everyone- teaching the importance of living your life to the fullest, telling your loved ones how much you care for them every moment you can and for those who STILL do not believe there is such thing as true love in a ... relationship- this couple will show you a love that few people (straight or otherwise) will ever have.",1074816000,15,888,4.291666666666667
594012,5,6303213510,"As another reviewer mentioned, I saw this when it aired on PBS back in the early 90s. And also as another stated, I had no intention of watching the whole thing. But I found myself drawn into this documentary in a manner that I have never been before or since. I have rarely, if ever, had a movie touch me in the way this one has.
The movie makes no pretense or statement about living life with full-blown AIDS. It is poigniant in every respect, showing the simple realities of life, and death.
After watching this movie, I would also suggest taking time to view 'And The Band Played On' about the U.S. reaction to the AIDS epidemic in the mid-80s.",1038528000,10,648,4.363636363636363

7840799,5,6303213510,"This is a beautiful documentary done by a couple living with HIV/AIDS. They put the camera on their lives and don't shy away from the struggles and abject ugliness of the disease progression as well as the issues of living with the disese and the fear from the public and the subsequent shame caused by panicked public (swimming pool scene) It is heartbreaking in its honesty. It should be on the shelves of every LGBTQ person if for no other reason than it shows, like the documentary on the quilt,  an unflinching historical look at what AIDS was in the early days. Those who didn't live through ""The Plague"" really haven't a clue. This is just one story out of thousands. But it drives the reality of the time home.",1493596800,,718,4.523076923076923

7840801,5,6303213510,"This documentary follows the life of two lovers, Tom Joslin and Mark Massi. Both men are afflicted with AIDS, a fatal illness that compromises the immune system. This is a wonderful film to show what daily life with AIDS looks like. Tom & Mark showed nothing but love towards one another, especially towards the ending of the film. Tom was getting sicker and weaker, and Mark was there for Tom every step of the way. Close to the ending of the film, Tom passed away. Mark filmed his deceased body, but it was essential to show the severity of AIDS. Tom was cremated, and Mark put his ashes in an urn. About the last 10 or so minutes, you get to see how Mark dealt with life without Tom. I read that Mark passed away a year or two after Tom. Nevertheless, this is such a powerful film about love and compassion. One of the greatest films that I have ever seen in my life. Buy it.",1420588800,,878,4.263473053892215

7840803,5,6303213510,"Just watched this documentary. One of the best I've seen. Remarkable scene where the director's lover of 20+ years dances to the song, ""Take My Heart Away"". It's like in the midst of their illness, he gets lost in the music. He allows the music to take control of his body and forgets all the negatives that surround him. His partners decline in health and his own likely demise. Beautiful story with very candid and frank scenes that allow the view to see first hand the experience of someone living and dying of AIDS. I wish there were documentaries like this that display the beginning and the unfortunate ends of these victims. Im truly feel honored to be able to view this. I'm thankful that Tom Joslin had the courage to allow us to see his life and death. Thankful that Mark Massai was apart of the project and granted Tom's request to keep it going after his death. And lastly thankful that Peter Friedman continued the project and successfully completed it. It's a MUST WATCH!",1386374400,2,985,4.6022727272727275

7840806,5,6303213510,"Silverlake Life - The View from Here is a memorable, poignant and often sad documentary about two incredibly brave men who, after 22 years of living together as a gay couple, must face their mutual battles against full-blown AIDS. Tom Joslin, a film school professor, shot much of the footage on this DVD and his talent shows; the cinematography is brilliant and the interviews give us deep insight into what made Tom and his lover Mark Massi tick and how their struggle against AIDS was something no one should have to go through. Somehow, Tom and Mark managed to maintain a sense of humor whenever possible and their constant love for each other is so clearly presented; it's obvious that this truly was a marriage. Their story also points out the importance of living each day to the fullest. The story moves along well with credit going to Peter Friedman, who had to choose what footage made it into the finished film as Tom did not specifically detail how he wanted the film to be shown. I must say that all of the film is very well done.

I don't want to spoil it all for you; although this review may look long I'll mention just some of what you'll see. The film starts with Peter telling us that he had to go through all the footage to decide how to make the film with a coherent story that had a beginning, middle and an end. We also meet both Tom and his lover Mike Massi; they have been together for 22 years and they obviously love each other very much. Their affection for each other is both touching and sweet. Tragically, both men are diagnosed with AIDS and they face their battles with a remarkable amount of courage and mutual support. Their bravery and strength is all the more amazing when you consider that neither of them had any real support from any family members. Tom's parents can't understand Tom's being gay nor do they like it. Tom's parents go through the motions at what would be Tom's last Christmas with them and at one point they refuse to see their son when he practically begs them to come to California for moral support and comfort. As for Mike, he suffers a deep blow to his dignity and pride when a ""very nice"" lady who owns a motel where they're staying a few days demands that Mike wear a shirt in the pool so that the others ""don't freak out"" when they see his Kaposi's sarcoma. I just don't know how they managed to emotionally cope; true, they had a therapist to talk to but in and of itself that could never have been enough. I just can't tell you enough how brave these two men were.

The DVD comes with very well done extras. I really admired the fine epilogue with Peter Freidman and Elaine Mays using footage taken by Mays herself. I liked Freidman's filmmaker statement and ""Awards & Acclaim"" impressed me.

Overall, Silverlake Life - The View from Here is a must-have for anyone in the LGBTQ community; and people who appreciate excellent documentaries would do well to add this to their collections. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival; it deserved to win, too! I highly recommend this documentary.",1344556800,4,3085,4.505357142857143
7840807,5,6303213510,"I'm so glad I came about the SILVERLAKE LIFE THE VIEW FROM HERE DVD. I've never heard of this film, but it was listed in another Amazon customer's review so that brought me here.

This documentary is hard to describe with words. It makes you feel so many emotions from sadness to anger to joy to hopefulness to despair. It hits you like a brick and EVERY gay man should see it to get a better understanding of how HIV/AIDS devastated our community, particularly those who are too young to remember the onslaught of this insidious syndrome. And for all those who claim that same-sex relationships are not as valid or meaningful as their straight counterparts, they really need to see this movie. There is NOT a person out there who can convince me that this was not a MARRIAGE.

I wish I knew the exact time frame of the movie's film dates, but it spans decades, and includes footage of Joslin's first film that was done as a teenager, and still photographs of him and Massi at the beginning of their relationship. I believe SILVERLAKE LIFE was completed in 1993, but the actual filming takes place years before.

In it, Tom Joslin, a film professor, takes his camera and turns it on himself and his lover, Mark Massi, both have been diagnosed with HIV, which eventually leads to full blown AIDS. The camera never shies away as you watch both men begin deteriorating, while the disease takes hold ravaging their bodies. Eventually, Joslin becomes so sick and weakened that he is no longer able to care for himself and Massi must take over (even though he is also in failing health). The couple was together for nearly 22-years.

Although it is very difficult to watch, including images of Kaposi's Sarcoma and death, it must be seen.

The two subjects of the film, Tom Joslin and Mark Massi, were both incredibly brave to record this journey and put it out there for the world to see. And credit must also be given to teaching colleague Elaine Mays, who continued with filming after Joslin's death, focusing on Massi, and Joslin's former film student, Peter Friedman, who was left with the task of culling from what was probably hundreds of hours of video footage and creating a somewhat narrative film with a beginning, middle, and end. And what a film it is.

Quality of the film isn't bad, after all Joslin was a professor teaching movie-making, so the lighting is good, the subjects are in frame, etc., and given that this was all shot on analogue video, the transfer to DV is great.

You must continue watching the ""Epilogue Footage"" in the special features because it picks up where the film leaves off.

Epilogue -- 17:11-minutes
Continuation of the documentary with interviews with Elaine Mays and Peter Friedman. I don't know how long after the movie was completed that this segment was filmed (by Parvez Sharma), but it traces what happened to Massi, using Mays's footage. It also discusses the challenges that Friedman encounter when he took on the challenge of creating the film since Joslin never left specific instructions on how he wanted the movie to be presented.

Although I wouldn't necessarily call this the definitive documentary on HIV/AIDS, it's more of a documentary on the love shared between two people, it does provide witness to the horrors of this illness. Unfortunately, Joslin and Massi were not unique in the way they died from this syndrome, as many more died in similar fashion. And though I'm glad that people who test positive for HIV now can live long and healthy lives, UNTIL THERE IS A CURE we should all be hyper-vigilant in preventing the spread of it.

I highly recommend SILVERLAKE LIFE THE VIEW FROM HERE DVD.",1340150400,,4084,4.782361308677098
