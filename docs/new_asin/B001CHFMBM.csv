8287705,5,B001CHFMBM,"First off I have to say I am a huge fan of 80's teen comedies. This was a movie I have never heard about or saw when I was younger, but I saw it for sale on Amazon a while ago and took a chance with it. I am glad I did. It was a really fun and sexy movie. The acting was alright, the music was good (for the 80's) and the chicks were hot!!! The story follows 4 guys who decide to make a pact to get laid before the summer is over, so that they can go back to high school as men and not boys. Pretty simple plot, but it worked great. So if you are looking for a fun movie that takes you back to a simpler time when guys would go out cruising for chicks and actually had to talk face to face with them, since there were no cell phones, and no texting. Then this is the one. Enjoy!",1289865600,5,778,3.6927710843373496
8287706,3,B001CHFMBM,"I have seen this movie before so it was a blind buy for me...When I did get around to watching it, I though it was funny compared to the more recent teen movies. I find it funny when the full sized guy in the movie goes to some girls house he just met (a waitress) and saw a teddy bear in the house that looks just like him then the house is set on fire...The movie has many laughs but it does have some scenes that it can do without.",1272067200,2,434,3.8333333333333335
8287707,2,B001CHFMBM,"Hot Moves was released in Dolby Stereo, back when not every movie got a stereo soundtrack (The Terminator, released a few months before this, was in mono because the budget didn't allow for both a stereo mix and the visual effects they wanted.)  I have the old Vestron VHS tape which preserves the great stereo mix of this movie with the cheesy 80s music spread across the front and rear channels; I even transferred it to DVD a while back when I thought there was no hope of it getting a legitimate release.  It had been on my top 10 most-wanted DVD list for quite some time.

Well, we finally get a DVD release with a 16x9 transfer, but the sound is in MONO!  It's 2-channel Dolby Digital, but all the sound stays in the center channel.  What a huge disappointment.  Picture quality isn't gorgeous either, but probably close to how the original prints looked and I'll take that over something that's been cleaned up too much.  There's NO excuse for the mono sound however when the VHS was in stereo (it was never released on laserdisc so these are the highest-quality releases we're probably ever going to get.)

Haven't listened to the commentary yet but hopefully that will make the purchase price a little more worth it.  I checked out the extras (which ironically sound like they were recorded with a camcorder's stereo microphone) and you get to see what star Adam Silbar looks like now- he's got gray hair.  No recent footage of Jill Schoelen but I'm afraid to know what she looks like now.

Hot Moves is one of the best of the 80s sex comedies and belongs in everyone's collection, but I'll still be watching my VHS tape unless someone out there is dedicated enough to give this yet another DVD release with the proper sound.",1239494400,6,1734,4.561290322580645
