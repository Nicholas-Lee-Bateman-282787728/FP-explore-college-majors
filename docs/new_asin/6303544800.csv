7850588,5,6303544800,"I have to admit, I was skeptical at first about buying this video..being a big time Brady fan...I  am glad I did..will buy more..wish they had this on dvd...like some shows have a whole season...someone needs to do that with this classic show!",1055203200,3,243,4.651162790697675
7850589,5,6303544800,"I grew up with the Brady Bunch. I have seen every episode at least three times. I have seen some episodes more than that. I hope to get this tape for Christmas. I love the episode Law & Disorder. It has always been one of my favorite episodes. I also love the Tattletale episode. It's so funny when Greg is making a face at Cindy in the beginning of the Tattletale episode.
If you haven't seen this show I suggest either buying this tape or watching it on TV Land or on Nick At Nite. You won't be sorry if you do.",1036540800,,513,4.03921568627451
7850590,5,6303544800,"This video contains two of the best episodes involving the two youngest children, Cindy and Bobby.  In the first episode, ""The Tattletale"", Cindy does what she does best:  snitching.  She drives  the rest of the family crazy with her tattling.  The second episode,  ""Law and Disorder"", features Bobby, who wants to be the best hall  monitor in school.  However, he brings his job home with him and rats on  all of his siblings.
These are two great episodes, especially for fans of  the younger Bradys.",963446400,5,501,4.788235294117647
7850591,5,6303544800,"These episodes were really good, particulary because Cindy is my favorite character, and ""The Tattletale"" is focused around Cindy. In ""Law and Disorder"", Bobby wants to be a good safety monitor, but  becomes really bossy at school and at home. He goes too far, but then he  saves a girl's cat, and in doing so, he breaks a rule and rethinks the  concept of rules. ""The Tattletale"" is about Cindy tattling on  other people so much that the Brady kids start avoiding her. Then she tries  to stop tattling so much that she almost loses something that is important  to Alice.",961113600,4,571,4.603960396039604
