6076438,5,B00GHP8SH4,"Tim is somewhat nonchalantly telling someone about the murder he committed a little over a year ago.  This film will keep you guessing until the end about to whom Tim is telling his story, who Tim is, and who Tim killed (also how, where, and why).

Tim is a puzzle.  He is a very pretty senior at university with many girlfriends and yet he is attracted to men who are strong and silent.  He attended a public school (private) in England and yet he has a rather large and ornate tattoo on one of his arms.  Did Tim get this tattoo in prison?  Apparently, Tim does not work and does not need to work.  Where does Tim get the money he keeps stashing away in a book with a secret compartment?  Does Tim have sex for money?

Is Tim being haunted or is he losing it because of the murder?  Is a man with blond hair stalking Tim?  Why?  What does he want?

This film is well-written, well-acted, well-directed, well-edited, and well-photographed/filmed.

It is one of those rare films that I want to watch again.",1396224000,3,1006,4.367567567567567
6076439,5,B00GHP8SH4,"Yes this was a surprise thriller, this was nothing like your typical gay love story boy meets boy, boys breakup boys get back together it's true love.  No this has everything else in it and I was hooked, I say at this price it was worth more then my 19.00 dollar film ez loved it:-)",1395446400,73,282,4.127272727272727
6076440,5,B00GHP8SH4,"I ordered this on a lark. It was cheap, and completed an order, to put it over the $35 threshold. So, I was surprised to find it much more sophisticated than I had expected.

There are no good guys in the movie. The main character is psychologically flawed. He has a mesmerizing effect on other people, and gets off on getting them, whether male or female, to fall in love with him. As soon as they do, he moves on. He finally meets a guy, goes through his routine, but them finds that the guy is as obsessive about keeping him as he is to leave. As can be anticipated, violence is the result. I won't ruin it by telling the end of the story. However, I will warn you that there are no happy endings in this movie. It is emotionally dark, right through the end. The only variation is the level of revulsion I felt for each of the characters.

There is  one violent scene and some brief sexual content, both same-sex and opposite-sex, with male nudity, mostly from behind and in the dark. This movie isn't pornographic, but it also isn't appropriate for children.",1395187200,223,1062,4.380710659898477
6076441,4,B00GHP8SH4,"This is a somewhat obscure made for TV movie produced in Canada and based on the book by Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine. I would have never known of the movie's existence, but I caught it on Logo TV a few years ago and found it immediately interesting. I then had to read the book. Of course in true fashion, the televised version lacks something of the book's intrigue, but still.  It's sexy, and the portrayals by Lee Williams and Marc Warren definitely make you wonder what truly drives the characters' actions.  While both can be definitely unlikable in thier own way, something about them still makes you feel like something in their past is the key to their dysfunctional relationship.  The DVD is great, only recently available as a region 1 release.  There are no special features and I personally could have done with some subtitles.  I had a hard time deciphering some of the confrontation between Ivo and Isabelle late in the movie, but the picture is clear and since the Logo version cut not only the sex and nudity, but also other content for time, it's good to have the unedited version in my collection.",1395014400,7,1124,4.628140703517588
6076442,5,B00GHP8SH4,"There are some parts of this movie that are dreamy because the main character, Tim is hallucinating. This made it confusing, especially the ending. But his relationship with the professor, Ivo is intense and sexy. Tim is unwell and doesn't seem to know right from wrong. At one point, he has a fight with Ivo and thinks he he killed him for a whole year. Then Ivo shows up unexpectedly and it shocks Tim. It's an interesting movie but confusing. Both of the leading men are sexy. It's a turn-on so it was worth it.",1394755200,14,514,4.421052631578948

I had my suspicions for the end but thought that would be too farfetched and found out that is where it went. At first you start to really take the side of the main character, but then realize that may be he's not all what he appears. I'll say this... WATCH IT!",1392508800,2,333,4.138461538461539
6076444,4,B00GHP8SH4,"A first-rate production of a well-crafted tale of obsessions and murderous results, with enough twists and turns to keep you wondering.  A fine-looking piece of work, too -- not least of all the intriguing main characters -- even more curious because not a single one of the characters is especially ""likeable.""  At times it seems a bit all-over-the-place;  but then, in true genre fashion, it seems to all come back together in the conclusion.  Well worth your attention!",1392336000,5,472,5.012820512820513

6076481,1,B00GHP8SH4,"Imagine if a high school senior saw Joe Orton's play ""Entertaining Mr. Sloane"" and then read Patricia Highsmith's ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" and then thought they could do better - you'd have a pretty good idea of what ""No Night is Too Long"" is about. This dated, stilted, boring, nonsensical story is not worth the two hours of your life that you have to give away to watch it. It's a throwback to those old - ""gays must die"" school of thought. It also suggest that gay male relationships are based purely on adversarial violence. Lee Williams is so horrible and boring in this piece that when his character is raped, its hard not to cheer for his rapist. I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch this repulsive, regressive, juvenile nonsense that was dated even when it came in 2002.  Bisexuals should be particularly offended. Even the pretty vistas of Canada, substituting for Alaska - as well as the pretty vistas of the male leads' facades - cannot make this watchable. If you ever need 2 hours to feel like 10 - this is the movie for you.",1515888000,2,1046,4.534391534391534

6076483,5,B00GHP8SH4,"Typical Ruth Rendell mystery, and that is a great compliment. You basically don't know all the facts until the very end that makes for a good story. It would be very tempting for a typical director to turn this into a 'all gays are doomed' movie, but each character is both complex and has black/white aspects - nobody is a goody goody. Acting is fantastic, as are the filming and locations. Highly recommended for Rendell fans and anyone who likes romance in a realistic, human story that is also a good crime thriller.",1513555200,2,520,4.602150537634409

It seemed to drag on at parts though perhaps that was intentional.

6076489,4,B00GHP8SH4,"I saw this years before this DVD came out, it aired on TV once without fanfare.  So comparing the slightly cut version (for television broadcast) with this full version, I can say there is nudity and sex scenes included in the DVD version.
The story itself is rather complex but controversial.  A man who appears attracted to women becomes attracted to a man, they enter into a serious relationship until one man says to another ""I love you.""
The lead character is interesting as everyone seems to be attracted to him, and he returns the attraction until the word LOVE is said. So that forecasts a break in the relationship as the young man now becomes attracted to a woman.  But is this because he truly loves or because she is married and therefore unavailable?  Psychologically this might be more complicated than some viewers want to put up with.  There are also some twists that make this even more complicated, but that is also the fun of it.
Very intense, all round, however very few actors on-screen, but one lead - the female, oddly - is miscast, she comes across as a mother figure or much older sister, so don't know if that was a director's choice to complicate things even more. If you're wanting to read the novel in order to clarify things, it won't.  This is a fairly well conceived interpretation.
Also, as a major plus, is the gorgeous Alaskan scenery that is on hand here.",1511395200,,1391,4.588709677419355

6076491,5,B00GHP8SH4,"This one is well done.  Intense from start to finish and a surprise given the lack of famous names associated with it.

6076505,4,B00GHP8SH4,"It's certainly a descent into hell, and one that seems to admit of no end.  But it's beautifully told and well played and not so much darker than real life as to be easily dismissed.  Some might say the main character is seriously flawed, but all the beautiful mornings of the world end in darkness, yet we don't say they too are flawed.  Light comes, as does love, and no one knows, and no one can say, where it will take us and what comes at the end of day.

With an attractive cast, beautiful locations and some very good story telling this movie had me from the get go and now on video it has not lost a beat.  Tim is handsome and charming to both men and women and finds himself instantly drawn to the equally appealing Ivo and now that they have met they are a combustible combination where frustration and secrets follow.

Without giving anything away I did not want the movie to end.... I wanted Tim to open the door I didn't know where it would go but I wanted him to open the door and after watching this a second time I still wish he had done so.

If you like intrigue and suspense with a small cast who does so much with so little watch this movie.",1504224000,4,874,4.221556886227545

6076511,4,B00GHP8SH4,"I think of this film as a film noir. The two main characters are very unlovable, but the story holds up well. I enjoyed all the twists and turns and unexpected happenings which make up the genre. I had seen the film before and when I saw it was available at Amazon for such a ridiculously low price I had to have it to add to my DVD collection. Well worth the investment.

6076514,5,B00GHP8SH4,"This movie is brilliant, stunning. Yes, it's 'Hitchcockian' in the best way but also reminiscent of other vintage thrillers. I won't give spoilers, but that final scene, where he performs his first ever selfless act....left me breathless.

6076517,5,B00GHP8SH4,"Wow! This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time! My initial thought was that I did not want to watch a movie of this type - gay; but, ironically enough it is NOT that type of film. I'd encourage anyone to watch this movie and see it through to the end. I promise the ending is not what you would expect. I'll absolutely watch it again with family.",1500854400,2,365,3.945945945945946
6076518,5,B00GHP8SH4,"Wow.  Great suspense movie.  Nice to see this is not a gay movie; it's a movie with a normal dramatic thriller story, but it just so happens that there are gay and bi-sexual characters.  Glad this is not another coming of age movie about being gay.  You could have replaced the characters with a female & male relationship, and it would have worked.

Taking place in England, a young university student who is a bit of a playboy with the ladies ends up crossing paths with a male university professor.  The two experiences attractions.  As an audience we later find out that the university student once experienced a short lived relationship as a choir boy with a more senior choir boy and thus, had a gay experience in the past.  The university professor falls in love with the young man, but the young man isn't sure of his own feelings even though at first he was crazy about the professor.  From an earlier request by the young man, the professor invites him on a lecture cruise trip together to Alaska.  By the time of the trip, the young man lost interest with the professor and falls for another woman he meets there.  However, the woman has to leave Alaska to return to her home in Vancouver.  The young man's feelings for the woman becomes so strong he can't help himself, but to find her again.  At this point, the movie gets suspenseful and the relationship between all the characters get muddled into this amazing intrigue while the young man explains his story of a murder mystery.  The movie takes you back in time to all the events until it comes back to the present time.  In the end, you learn who the murderer is, and how the young man reacts to his present time reality, still with a suspense of what will happen next.

This movie would be above rated R as there are sexual scenes and frontal and backside nudity.  You do need to be someone with a liberal mind to watch this film.  Definitely not for the conservatives.",1500854400,5,1938,4.488571428571428

The cast is excellent, the psychologically twisting story is well-executed and mostly credible. The one big lapse in believability occurs when Ivo confronts a character in the presence of someone who SHOULD do something, but that someone does nothing and allows the violent confrontation to continue. These are well-defined characters and the mystery of how they meet and the circumstances in which they interact, is exciting.

6076542,1,B00GHP8SH4,"Boring and made little sense.  The first hour could have been cut from the film because it added very little.  They over did it with the sex scenes which added nothing to the story.  Story?  There isn't one.  A creepy psycho boyfriend who is a control freak falls for some mixed-up kid who looks like he could be sixteen years old.  I had no idea what the time period was until the end.  The cell phone gave that away.

Nothing in this movie makes any sense especially these letters the main character kept receiving.  The first time I watched it I turned it off after about twenty minutes because it was so dull.  Then I decided to try to watch it again.  Personally I do not like movies where the characters have a thick British accent like the main character has.  I couldn't understand most of what he said which is probably why I didn't learn his name until after an hour into the movie.

Like other recent movies that I've seen, there were too many transitions from one time period to another so it was difficult to follow where we are in the story.  It takes a long time before anything happens--at least an hour.  The near death scene on the island was unrealistic especially when the victim escaped out of story.  Obviously a scene cut from this already boring film.  From that point on it started to get interesting which had me wondering why all the worthless filler at the beginning that took up most of the movie.

The entire movie could have been cut down to thirty minutes including commercials.  That's about all that is worth seeing of it without falling asleep.",1494115200,2,1579,4.47719298245614

The acting is top notch and ones sympathies are drawn all over the place. There are some rather near the knuckle scenes in it but it is amazingly well handled and well worth the blushing, if watching it in front of friends or relatives! These scenes actually make the whole thing more real and more believable because of their realism. I have watched it several times already whenever I have people staying and, like 'Dial M for murder' I shall never get tired of it, as a lot of the subsequent enjoyment comes from the gasps of the other viewers as the plot twists and turns.",1437004800,,814,4.2243589743589745

Kind of similar to, although not as masterful as, ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (one of my top ten films of all time).

6076658,5,B00GHP8SH4,"Intriguing, suspenseful, unpredictable and surprising.  This is not the type of film I would usually select to watch or enjoy, but I loved this movie.

It was suspenseful in a somewhat subtle, not jarring way, which made it all the more watchable and entertaining.  All the characters are wonderfully flawed and psychologically damaged and therefore i was always anticipating what came next.  I was neither correct or bored with what came next.m the twists and turns of the plot were just enough and never too much.  So many films like this have storylines that box the entire film into a totally ridiculous corner at the end.  No Night Is Too Long ended on a more subtle note.

Unlike so many suspense fills that simply try to outdo other suspense films, this film was unique, while telling the story of passions unleashed and obsessions running wild.",1426896000,2,852,4.834482758620689

6076668,3,B00GHP8SH4,"This is a review that spoils the movie, if you haven't seen it.  But here is my review, so read it if you don't mind the spoils...  Initially, I thought this an excellent movie.  I really loved the sex scenes, very graphic, and I enjoyed watching them.  Five Star Caliber so far,  But toward the end, way too many twists!  Too many.  There must have been at least four or five twists at the end, maybe more.  I have to see it again, and count them.  I personally like a stable movie with a happy ending.  As clever as this movie tried to be, at the end, robbed the audience of so very many possible good and happy endings, all within reach, but all taken away.  There could have been several happy endings.  It was as if the people producing the movie were desparate to be clever and win awards for their cleverness.  I was disappointed.  Specifics:  Tim is the main character.  Falls in love with another man, Ivo, then loses interest in him and falls in love with a woman instead. After a fight with Ivo, Tim thinks he killed him.  Then Tim pursues the womam he fell in love with. But Ivo comes back, and at the end of the movie, there is a possibility that Tim will hook up with him again?  Tim started to feel passion for Ivo again.  You could tell something sparked and rekindled.  Could this take off again?  Not.  Ivo gets murdered.  By who? Well, there is this drifter on heavy drug addiction who Tim meets in Vancouver on a one night stand, ends up in England somehow,  And, kills Tim's lover Ivo. Twist. How does a cocaine/crack junkee get the money and motivation to fly from Vancouver to a small town in England to meet someone he had a one night stand???  I could think of more better ways the drifter could spend his money, like more drugs to satisfy his cravings.  But not here.  This drug addict gets the money to fly to England to kill Tim's original lover??  Brilliant, now where do we go from here?  But wait, there is more.  Tim finds out that the woman he fell in love with was Ivo's sister.  Yes, we find out that his second lover is related to his first lover. What a coincidence.  Tim has a more passionate love for her than he had for Ivo.  And you thought Tim was gay, and that this was a gay movie.  Twist.  Then after Ivo dies, she shows up at Tim's door step in England and rings the bell, only to have Tim not answer the door when after all these years, he searched desparately for her.  Another twist.  The movie ends in an avalanche of possibilities that could happen, and the movie just falls short.  Nothing happens.  Too many twists and disappointments.  Because of this, I took this from 5 stars to 3.  The movie producers tried to be too clever.  I was disappointed.",1423872000,3,2703,4.302788844621514

6076673,5,B00GHP8SH4,"First, I loved ""the talented Mr. Ripley"" this wasn't exactly the same but for me it had a similar feel to it. LOVED it. Tim Cornish(Lee Williams) likes women until he meets Ivo(Marc Warren) sparks fly and for these 2 men they are literal poison to each other. They have a very flawed relationship and then Tim meets Isabel and falls in love with her. Tim wants to be free, Ivo literally covets Tim and will not let him go, Isabel has some secrets of her own. I just loved the story, the pacing, the direction, the scenery (Newfoundland, I believe) and most of all I loved the performances by all involved especially Lee Williams and Marc Warren...BRAVO! I have somewhat simplified the telling only because there are so many undertones and I will not divulge them.

The price of this DVD underestimates the gold lining of the script and characters. Fine acting, great background music
from Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier. Melodic and tragic.",1418860800,2,297,5.1875
6076692,5,B00GHP8SH4,"As a long-time fan of Ruth Rendell (aka Barbara Vine), I have been excited about seeing this particular film as it happens to be my favorite novel of hers. I finally located the film on YouTube and later on the Logo network but the quality was not up to par and the Logo version was edited and full of commercials. I was pleasantly surprised to see the DVD finally offered on Amazon (and at $3.77, how can you go wrong?)

It turns out the quality of the DVD is fantastic and the film itself is very well-done and effectively captures the dark, psychological spirit of the novel. The atmospheric story, which takes place in England sea-side town and the Pacific Northwest, centers on Tim Cornish, a bi-sexual who falls in and out of love very easily and encounters complications when his current boyfriend doesn't want to give him up. That is a simple synopsis to a quite complicated and intense story.

This is a film that would have made Hitchcock proud - indeed a key sequence that takes place on an Alaskan cruise is expertly edited, creating great tension and accompanied by an excellent score.

At first, I was disappointed when I saw the actors. I did not think they matched their descriptions in the novel. However, I quickly changed my mind when I realized how good they are. Both Lee Williams and Marc Warren do a fantastic job. Marc Warren is especially sexy and menacing. Their chemistry is great and the sex scenes are hot.

The only quibble I have with the entire movie is the fact the gay characters are unfortunately stereotypical. However, the film is so well-done, I can overlook that.",1418601600,5,1602,4.630281690140845

The premise is an interesting one and I like that most of the story is set in Alaska.  Lee Williams is gorgeous, and very good actor.  Marc Warren reminds me of a young Malcolm McDowell and is also a fine actor.  The chemistry between the two guys is really incredible and the love scenes are nice and very convincing.

6076701,5,B00GHP8SH4,"Often a challenge are movies that deliver on their promise - ""No Night is Too Long"" packs a punch and lived up to my expectations.  With a plethora of unexpected twists and turns, I doubt many will see the end coming by a long shot!  Just when it spins you in one direction, it adds yet another unexpected twist.  The production was high quality and the actors and ensemble cast were strong and believable.  Considering this was not a big budget major studio release, that says a lot for the production team.

I won't repeat the film description or summary, but if you like dark romantic plots, this will fit the bill.

The film runs about 2 hours, and I'm okay they didn't edit it to make it shorter.  I've seen films that were 90 minutes and needed editing - this one didn't.

6076720,5,B00GHP8SH4,"I am a gay autistic man as such I like watching good movies with well developed gay characters in lead roles.  It does not take much to please me when it comes to gay themed movies.  An interesting plot with likable characters and I will give you a solid nice review.  No Night Is Too Long  was so much more than I expected in an average gay themed movie.  I can't actually use terms like weird or strange to define No Night Is Too Long because; such simple words are wholly inadequate to the task of sharing the unusual intensity and plot twists that make No Night Is Too Long one of the best gay themed movies I've ever seen.

No Night Is Too Long is by no way shape or means your typical gay themed movie.  No Night Is Too Long  is not about pretty boys hanging out in gay cruise bars, doing crystal meth or anything stereotypically ""gay"".  Yet do not let yourself be fooled this IS A GAY THEMED MOVIE where soft core gay sex is shown in very good taste.  This movie is not all about the sex.  These are fully fleshed out people who just happen to be gay.  Well one of the teo main characters is is sort-of gay since he seems to be a deeply conflicted bisexual fighting gay urges.

The video quality is first rate some sections are dark but it adds to the moody brooding nature of the pacing and action.  The guys are for the most part good looking.  There is one down right ugly man in No Night Is Too Long  but luckily you don't have to look at him too long. What makes No Night Is Too Long  great is that the plot takes the most indirect route to its conclusions.  The plot is almost predictable because; the plot develops its characters to the degree they feel like real people.  Every gay man has likely met dudes like this if they have lived long enough.  I am autistic, gay and my social life is almost non-existant but even I have met or seen men like those in No Night Is Too Long.

The sound quality is excellent too matter of fact their were no technical issues with my copy of No Night Is Too Long.  I had put this movie on the shelf because; I honestly did not think it would be that good.  I was ShOcKeD Outta My Socks when I watched No Night Is Too Long become one of the best movies I've ever watched gay straight or otherwise.  This movie took simple themes and made them very real very complex yet still painfully simple.  No Night Is Too Long  took me on an emotional roolercoaster ride I will personally never forget.  I watched No Night Is Too Long twice in a row just because; it woke up lines of thought in my own life I had never explored.  I could say No Night Is Too Long is essentially about a toxic relationship gone tragically wrong but it is about so much more than just that.  This is a must have in my collection movie no matter if I were gay or straight No Night Is Too Long is a total keeper. PERIOD!",1413244800,13,2837,4.135283363802559

6076723,4,B00GHP8SH4,"It's been a while since I have come across a really good thriller; the last one was STOKER. But this isn't just a good thriller, it's simply a really good movie all around: the acting, script, directing, cinematography, sound - All of it excellent! And to think I almost didn't buy it.

This little gem begins in a small, English coastline village where a young man and his girlfriend are making out. Then the boyfriend spies an older man, late twenties/early thirties, watching the young lovers. The older man is blond, mysterious, good-looking. The boyfriend becomes intrigued, and for a moment, forgets the girl. The boyfriend grows even more interested when he begins seeing the older man everywhere he goes; on their college campus, in an elevator, outside a window. So the young man follows the older, into an elevator one day, just barely making the lift, so enthralled is he. He follows the older man to an office, where he discovers the man to be one of the Professors of their college, a bio-something Professor who travels across the globe every six months to do lectures on...something boring and I couldn't care less. But whatever, the guy is hot and he's got that leather thing going on. So pretty quickly, the young boyfriend and the old Professor are hooking up and it's good. The boyfriend can't get enough of the Professor - or so he says, whining, begging, complaining. When the Professor announces he has to go to Alaska for a month, the young boyfriend flips out, breaks down, crying his heart out, ""I need you!"" It's heartfelt and totally believable. Until the Professor confesses his love of the boyfriend.

I have actually met people like this in my own life, and let me tell you, when I walked away from them, the last thing I felt was empathy but here; the dialogue and acting were so sublime, I actually forgot I was watching a movie! Seriously, I thought I was watching Investigation ID or something. And I did feel empathetic toward the young boyfriend. How horrible would it be to feel as though you couldn't possibly live without someone and then, BAM! Feel that sensation vanish on the wind. You don't know if what you felt was real or not, and now it's too late. To live in such confusion, and regret.

I won't give the ending away but let's just say that all the players of this magnificent piece of art will not soon be forgot. Once you watch, you too will be ensnared within their web.",1412035200,7,2421,4.625581395348838

6076747,5,B00GHP8SH4,"This is a surprisingly forgotten about film. I had never even heard of it until I came across the DVD and decided to give it a chance and was I forever shocked and utterly amazed at how extraordinary this film is. It never occurred to me where it was going as I was watching and when the final credits rolled I was dumbfounded at how great this dark mysterious film was.

Superb acting, awesome direction and a phenomenal story. The characters are flawlessly acted through many wonderful ways that grab the viewer and basically puts them in the scenarios taking place. I can't believe that I had never even heard of this movie or even knew it existed until by fluke I came across it. I am so shocked that I have not heard this spoken about or mentioned or even shared on review sites or spoken about on movie blogs. This is one of those diamonds hidden. This is one of those treasures that can be found but so many are not even looking because they don't know about it. I hope I can spread the word and make people seek this out.

This is actually a TV movie that the BBC brought out but it plays like a regular mainstream feature film, that's how good it is. Tons of nudity, sex and mystery. It does not remind you of a TV movie. This is based on No Night Is Too Long (novel) by Ruth Rendell. A wonderful cast of characters and emotions makeup this somewhat haunting tale of a young creative writing student named Tim. Tim leads a lifestyle of one night stands with countless women until he comes across a professor at the university Dr. Ivo Steadman who is a man. There he falls for the Dr. He sees him everywhere. His dreams and his desire cloud up with the image and lust for the Dr.

This is a fantastic crime, drama, thriller that weaves itself into many genres of film. Tim has a secret that you find out right away and then he begins his story telling you of the nature of his deed, his crime his ultimate haunting nightmare.

Tim is played wonderful by Lee Williams and Ivo is played flawless and mysterious by Marc Warren. Both actors chemistry is perfect as they play off each other. The love affair and puppy dog affection and ultimate lustful playground of each other's bodies become a main focus. Soon that lustful desire inside Tim fades as the remark is made, I love you by Ivo. The term is like a shield or a painful experience that changes everything.

There is a problem however, Tim is self-centered and Ivo is the jealous type. One day Ivo says the three fatal words that have always made Tim lose interest the sex partner of the moment and those words are ""I Love You""  They are to Tim what toe jam is to everybody else.  Ivo does lectures on an Alaskan cruise every year and takes Tim with him.  Tim has lost interest.  Ivo has to replace another professor on an earlier cruise and while Tim waits for him in Juno, he meets a woman - the ""true"" love of his life - and tells Ivo he wants to leave him.

The movie has themes of betrayal and obsession, and though there are a few sex scenes, that is not the dominant part of this movie. The psychology of the main character is complex, though we only get brief windows into how past experiences made him who he is as we see him.

The acting was excellent and the overall filming very good. The movie isn't slow, but it unfolds at a graduated pace, and you're never quite sure where it's heading. The movie has its share of drama, intrigue, anticipation, and closure, making for a well-rounded piece.

However, I still don't understand why the DVD is so CHEAP!

As well as being  recently filmed - the DVD is of 2014 release -  it has very high production and location standards as well as being an intriguing, very original story, with  pristine 2.35:1 Widescreen image and great sound.

The completely unexpected twists add to the drama, and the location work, particularly that with the views on the Island where the ""deed"" is carried out, is great, as is the spectacular piece of photography of the island as it recedes away in the mist, while viewed from the stern of the Cruiser as it returns to base over  the heavy seas.

The acting of all concerned is of a  high standard too, so another copy is being bought for a friend - who certainly won't be told how  ridiculously cheap the DVD  was.

NO NIGHT IS TOO LONG really appears to have been done as a  quality Major Studio production.

And, in that regard, it was, being a production of  BBC CANADA and released on DVD thru Echo Bridge home Entertainment.

Certainly a film worth watching, although for me, the ""hero"" of the film annoys me quite a lot - it's difficult to go along with such a mixed-up dude.",1399593600,2,305,4.0
6076799,5,B00GHP8SH4,"I'm a passionate film buff, but I hadn't even heard of this film until recently.  And I don't mind admitting I've seen more than enough thrillers to be somewhat jaded (loads of Hitchcock, Chabrol and the other masters of the genre).  It's fairly unusual for a film to keep me guessing, much less surprise me with its plot twists, but this one did just that.  It pulled me into Tim's world and his affair with Ivo almost from the first frame, and it never let go of me.  Screenwriter Kevin Elyot is a master at delineating the darker and more problematic sides of modern gay life.  His CLAPHAM JUNCTION is quite a masterpiece, and I'm happy to endorse NO NIGHT IS TOO LONG as taking its place side-by-side with it.  Lee Williams and Marc Warren give subtle, nuanced performances, and Tom  Shankland's direction is absolutely razor-sharp.  I can't recommend this film any more enthusiastically.",1398902400,110,892,4.746753246753247
6076800,5,B00GHP8SH4,This movie is Awsome! I wasn't sure when i bought it. I had never heard of this movie before now. The actors are attractive and seem to play there rolls well. This movie made me feel something from  start to finnish. I felt like the storyline kept me interested. The big twist twords the end was a great way to end the movie. I was sitting with my mouth wide open. If you like to watch movies that involve gay themes you will love this movie. I did!,1398384000,2,449,4.1022727272727275
6076801,4,B00GHP8SH4,"This is a pretty good film. VERY good price $.

An interesting tale of gay love, confusion & murder. I felt like the guys in this had found themselves a worthy/tasteful relationship UNTIL one of them decides to have a stronger connection to the other guy's sister.

Good scenery in this film. I would consider it DRAMA and a little creepy, difficult to follow on the first view but is all understood after completion. It's too bad their relationship went in the sour direction it did, they made a good couple.

Strong recommendation to check out this film! Might as well, it's only like $4.",1398211200,,590,4.6
6076802,1,B00GHP8SH4,"Most of the positive reviews are based on the lead actor being attractive; however, let's address the actual storyline--personally, I am incredibly tired of portrayals of bisexual men whose relationship with a gay man is portrayed as abusive, and the boyfriend, a homosexual demon in the flesh. Suddenly, a heterosexual woman arrives on the scene and her feminine wiles illumine the bisexual man to all that is true love and passion. Let us not forget that this same woman knowingly betrayed her brother by sleeping with his boyfriend. This movie reinforces the concept of ""melo-trauma"" as a cinematic negative stereotype. The main character's gay relationship was ""the traumatic experimentation"" and the woman, ""the cure"". If cinematic depictions of gay men portrayed as deranged deviants are your cup of tea, then this is the movie for you.",1397260800,32,842,5.198529411764706
6076803,5,B00GHP8SH4,"I originally read about the movie from looking into the actors from other movies I had seen. Marc Warren and Lee Williams were incredibly strong in their rolls. As the story progressed, all my thoughts of what were going to happen went right out the window. I was impressed by the actors and by the storyline. Great movie.",1396828800,2,322,4.568965517241379

First saw it on LOGO years ago and since then been watching a blurry youtube version.  Nice to see it in almost bluray quality.  Have no idea why it is so inexpensive.  Will have to buy a couple in case it's a short release.  Truly a classic in gay films.  Netflix shows it as ""saved"" so not available yet.  Just buy it.  You won't be disappointed.",1396396800,23,445,4.2023809523809526
