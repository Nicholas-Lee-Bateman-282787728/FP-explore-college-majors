5793108,5,B00DDT0JB0,"I bought this set to replace Murphy's Romance and Steel Magnolias that I recorded from TV many years ago.  Those two movies were great.  I watched the other 2, but I probably won't watch them again.  Places in the Heart was a powerful movie but also very sad.  The ending was beautiful, but there was lots of misery leading up to that ending.  I find it hard to believe that it is included in a Date Night Collection.  My Best Friend's Wedding was interesting, but I found the plot changes back and forth at the end not entertaining.",1519948800,,533,4.387755102040816

They are 4 favorites of mine and it was a lot cheaper to buy all 4 like this, then pay to watch them  on Netflix or Comcast or from a video store.""Murphys Romance,"" I was young like Sally Field and I thought James Garner was so old  in the movie. Now I am the  age he was. LOL Great romance and fun movie...""Places in the Heart"" was the beginning of careers for some of the actors in it, and you will recognize them. It is a depression movie from the south that tears at your heart strings. A great watch and a decent film. "" Steel Magnolias"" was I think Julia Roberts 1st movie and with an all star cast giving her great support ,she had it made. Sally Field as always was magnificent, so have Kleenex ready. ""My Best Friends Wedding"" was good  and, for the first time in a Julia Roberts movie, you will find you aren't sure if you love her or hate Julia Roberts in this one, which is rare.  You can tell it has aged a bit, with the ""phones"" being considered new.  Back when this movie was new you left the theatre wanting to own such a marvel as their own portable phones they were using.

5793346,4,B00DDT0JB0,"Yes, well.  It's been a longish time since I had a ""date night,"" which I guess is some kind of coded message that these are four chick flicks.  Truth to tell, I got this dvd because Murphy's Romance is on it and for reasons I don't altogether understand, Murphy's Romance is hard to get one's hands on.  It's not a Great Film, but it's a good romantic comedy and both Sally Field and James Garner are nice to look at in it.  Since it's a May and December romance story, I'm not sure it's a chick flick.  Unless, of course, chicks fantasize about getting together with a charming guy teetering on the edge of the geriatric abyss.  At the price, it's an economical addition to a collection, and suggests that it's never too late.  Which is horsefeathers, of course, but it's nice to pretend for a couple of hours.",1421798400,3,811,4.402684563758389

5793351,5,B00DDT0JB0,"I purchased this for my father, as he's a big fan of ""Murphy's Romance"", which we had on VCR when I was younger.  It's a great film from 1985, about a woman (Sally Field) who, in the aftermath of a divorce with her worthless husband, comes to a small town in Arizona to start a horse-training operation.  She befriends the town's druggist, Murphy Brown (the great James Garner), but a blossoming May-December romance is threatened by her ex-husband's return.  Many of the film's best lines come from the deadpan Murphy, but my personal favorite is his disgusted reaction to ""Friday the Thirteenth"": ""I worked in a slaughterhouse one summer.  Don't need to pay money to see it onscreen.""  ""Murphy's Romance"" a mostly forgotten gem of a film, which is a shame-Ebert liked it well enough to give it three stars.
This collection is reasonably priced just for one movie, and the three others were an appreciated bonus.",1420848000,10,913,4.789808917197452

5793447,5,B00DDT0JB0,Great Field movies and who doesn't love her acting?  Murphy's Romance with beloved James Garner makes us miss him more...Places in the Heart brings us to tears.  Steel Magnolias is one of my three favorite movies of all times--we cry..we laugh.. We are mesmerized by this story!!  Field and her cast of friends at their best.  My Best Friend's Wedding was not a fav although Julie Robertson is one of my fav!!!,1408147200,,410,4.652777777777778

5793451,3,B00DDT0JB0,"Good set of movies with what we consider a glaring fault:  Best Friend's Wedding is not the PG version as listed on the packaging.  Its opening on screen clearly says that it is PG-13.  This is the version in which Julia Roberts uses the ""F"" word.  The word is totally unnecessary except for the possibility that someone wanted to raise the rating to attract a different age group.  A few minutes later in the film, her fellow actor uses a carefully constructed euphemism to describe the act which goes over well.  Surrounded by grandchildren...although we really enjoy the movie...we find that this version has no place in our collection.  We know that the other version exists because we viewed it on an airplane flight.",1406851200,5,722,4.774193548387097

5793466,5,B00DDT0JB0,"Murphy's Romance is one of those movies I like to pull out when I'm feeling a little pensive but wanting a feel-good ending.
I love this movie. Two great characters, 2 great actors.
Places In The Heart is yet another movie that shows Sally Field's strength as an actor. Her character is determined and has the perserverence to make her struggles in life pay off. A tour de force for Sally.
Steel Magnolias is one of those bittersweet stories that portrays the humor and the trials of a group of southern belles. This movie has an interesting blend of characters who, although very different, come together in harmony. Colorful canvas.
My Best Friend's Wedding showcases Julia Roberts with Sally having a minor role. If you haven't seen this movie, I won't spoil it.
This is a must-have compilation if you're a Sally fan. And if you're not, she will surprise you.",1399420800,5,862,4.71523178807947

5793472,5,B00DDT0JB0,"This movie is a must have for the fans of Sally Field and James Gardner.  It's a fun look at an older man in love with a younger woman.  Sally is excellent in the role of Emma, a recently divorced woman who is also trying to make it alone as a rancher.  Murphy (played by James) is the older gentlemen who is attracted to Emma when she arrives in town with her son.  When Emma's ex shows up the two men vie for Emma which results in some funny situations.  I would rate this movie PG-13 because of the mild sexual content. Great chick flick with a terrific cast.",1394236800,13,562,4.1192660550458715
