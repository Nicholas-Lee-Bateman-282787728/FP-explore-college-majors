3455174,1,B001ANQY7Y,I waited so long for a seq. to lost boys and this is the best they could come up with?. I don't want to ruin what little plot there is for people that want to see it. I will say it had some good blood and gore in some scenes. My best advice is not to buy it but to rent.,1217289600,3,270,3.442622950819672
3455175,3,B001ANQY7Y,"In the end credits, it clearly says ""Alan Frog  Jamison Newlander""...??? So where is he? If he wasn't in the movie, he would not be in the credits, but having watched it twice, I cannot find the guy. Anybody know what the deal is with this?",1217116800,,240,4.217391304347826
3455176,5,B001ANQY7Y,"Actually pretty darn good.  The look of the film is way better than a DTV movie, and the acting was great.  The script had some problems... but big whoop.  The vamp action was cool, it was funny, Edgar Frog was back in perfect form, and the soundtrack wasn't bad.",1217030400,6,263,4.326530612244898
3455177,3,B001ANQY7Y,"I didn't hate it.  I went into it expecting nothing better than an on-screen fanfic with more nudity, or something along the lines of some of Feldman's bad 90's movies, so I was fairly surprised.  It had holes and a generic plot line, and I didn't like the cover of Cry Little Sister, but besides that...

The gore was so over the top it was funny (I laughed anyway), none of the acting was cringe worthy.  Some of the writing was iffy, but it wasn't terrible.  Feldman played Edgar *exactly* as he did in 1986--there's a character with zero growth.  He even had the same hair and red bandanna.  (He cleaned up really well, not his usual scruffy, sleazy self.)  I liked the soundtrack, the sets weren't bad.  The bike tricks were pretty cool.

Yes, it plays homage to the original A LOT.  They even stole a chunk of memorable dialogue.  The sex scene isn't nearly as well shot as in the original.

It's not a good movie, but it's not terrible either.  If you go in hating it, you will.  If you go in with a sense of humor and low expectations, it might surprise you.  It was written as a love letter to the original.  It wasn't trying to be its own movie, and it wasn't trying to be better.  If you're a fan you will love it or hate it, it all depends on your attitude.  If you're not a fan, well, there are many worse vampire movies out there.",1216944000,32,1344,4.241106719367589
3455178,2,B001ANQY7Y,"no where near as good, funny, goofy, creativ as origianl but i liked it caus you see people you haven't seen in amovie in years, faces you may of heard of or not seen since the  early  90s etc it had its moments, but plot wise the first wasy way better but again it had its moments",1216857600,,281,3.912280701754386

3455180,1,B001ANQY7Y,"the original Lost boys was a tongue in cheek horror movie that was quirky , intelligent, and gave as many laughs as it did frights. surely anybody attempting a sequel would build on the formula that made the orginal a world wide hit?
Sadly , despite the occasional nice touch ,the lost boys :the tribe plays it straight and dull with little to lighten the mood, from the first very nasty pre-credits death to the intriguing but largley meaningless tag scene featuring Corey Haim , this film is a flat dull slog. its great to see Edgar Frog back in action but you just wish he was in a better Film and with his MIA brother Alan Frog along for the ride.",1216857600,4,651,4.344262295081967

3455210,2,B001ANQY7Y,"T'd it a star and a half, actually.
It lacked pretty much everything that the first film had and what made it so unique.
There was no clever jokes or any dark humor. No interesting characters, other than Feldman who was under developed. There was actually nothing that made you even like a particular character. Shane did have something seductive about him whether it be his mannerisms or voice. The gore was ridiculous and unnecessary in comparison to Lost Boys which didn't need any of that nor did it need the nudity.
Not that I'm against either but it was random and almost put in to be some sort of redeeming factor to make up for the horrible script and lack of memorable characters. It was not tastefully done.
 It lacked the romanticism that you typically associate with vampires and failed to create any sort of mood.
The action sequence on the bikes and skateboards, that was supposed to be some sort of ""initiation"" (like in the first when they hung from the rafters under the train tracks then let go), was silly.
It was VERY predictable as well. There were no twists & turns. No mystery as to who the ""head vampire"" was.
Also the rest of Shane's boys were like neanderthal's. Yelling and acting worse than 12 year old's. It failed to be humorous or entertaining at all.. actually an annoyance.
 All of this made actually miss the atmospheric first one. It was original, fun & sexy. Which none of this one was. Even standing alone, with no comparison, it was lame.",1423958400,,1476,4.587121212121212

It's not that bad at all, and I have found that this has become my favorite Lost Boys movie. It's a great movie! I wish it would have focused a little more on Edgar, but it didn't, and that's okay.

I loved seeing Feldman again. As Frog, he is perfectly named. I do agree with those that say the first one was funnier. It had more opportunity since it was offering everything new. In this one, we know what to expect. I think it was this one that started out cursing a blue streak. I don't remember it being so prevalent in the original. It seemed excessive here.

Now although he wasn't like this big super vampire (and this goes out to the fans who always think the head vampire has to be like Terminator 2 vampire WHY? That's what I mean 2 by picky if they can play the vampire well, then we don't need super-charged Terminator Vampire) I liked how Edgar was a Surfboard shaper and vampire Hunter....and that shot where he knocked that one vampire girl out with the surfboard was pretty cool.....and I wish Edgar would've had that Tribal (George Clooney Dusk till Dawn tat in the next one, cause that was sexy! They had some great weapons 2....dug the blood....but I only REALLY hated one thing....the girl vampires brother....why is this guy an actor? I just hate him....So much I  fact I'm going to go thru all the scenes I hate with him in it. 1st off, after his sister drinks the blood he keeps saying in this whiney voice....you're just drunk....shut up...shut up shut up! 2nd and I know Edgar has to help him as a vampire Hunter but Why? I wouldn't help this guy...he's being a complete ass! So let's call him Vongeek like the Reality show guy in the next guy in the 3rd movie. AND THANK GOD! Edgar and this guy aren't friends because I swear I really hate him! He yells about the comics when they would help if he'd shut up for 2 seconds.... he doesn't know what any of the weapons are including a garlic Bolo (I've known that and every other Slaying weapon and I trained myself how to fight cause I always thought it was so cool.

....I dug the lost boys theme remake, and the special Corey Feldman does on how to destroy all vampires was just SO awesome, I think they could've used  it in The Thirst just with that movie (it's on utube all the time 2 so check it out....just put in Edgar Frog's Guide to Hunting Vampires....well that's my latest review and even though it's early....Happy Halloween!",1380499200,,2651,4.4979253112033195

To say this movie sucks would be a understatement, this movie was so boring and so stupid that i think i would of rather watched Blue's Clues or Barney than this garbage!. The vampire makeup is WAY too over the top and a little exaggerated. This movie should of NEVER even been made! especially since they waited until 2008 to do a sequel.

3455236,1,B001ANQY7Y,"It amazes me that it took a whole TWENTY-ONE years for Hollywood to churn out a rotten sequel to the classic 1980s vampire movie, ""The Lost Boys.""

But they did. God help us, they did.

And ""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" frankly feels less like a sequel to the original movie than it does a generic half-baked vampire romance with a single ""Lost Boys"" character shoehorned in -- lots of sex, nudity, pointless gore, and a teen girl being romanced by a tousle-haired vampire. It doesn't help that the acting is almost uniformly wretched, led by a spectacularly unspectacular role by Angus Sutherland.

After the death of their parents, ex-surfer Chris Emerson (Tad Hilgenbrink) and his younger sister Nicole (Autumn Reeser) move in with their aunt. On their first night, they go to a party thrown by another ex-surfer, Shane Powers (Angus Sutherland), and his ""tribe"" of equally likable followers. It isn't really a spoiler to say that they're vampires, and Shane slips Nicole a bit of his blood, which starts her transformation into a full-blown bloodsucker.

Fortunately, surfboard shaper/vampire hunter Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) shows up to help Chris, announcing that Nicole can be saved if Chris can kill Shane. But Shane has his eye on Chris as the next member of his tribe, and Chris immediately wants the eternal youth and life that the vampires have to offer. Will Chris save himself and his sister? Do I even want him to?

Suffice to say, ""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" is not as good as the original ""Lost Boys."" This is a vampire movie for people who like ""Twilight,"" but want more sex, boobs and gore. The only real remnant of the first movie is the presence of Edgar Frog, and frankly he seems more like an extended cameo. He pops up occasionally, then vanishes for several scenes at a time.

But this movie isn't just a bad sequel. It's a bad vampire movie overall -- a witless, meandering mess of bad dialogue (""Do you know what it's like for me to want to drink blood?... I'm a vegetarian!""), unfunny ""humor"" (the vampires like to stab and eviscerate each other for fun) and awful romance. I do not want to see a sensitive tousle-haired boy vampire taking his girlfriend on a nighttime motorcycle ride, okay? If I want that sort of thing, I will watch ""Twilight.""

It doesn't help that I hated all the characters except Edgar. Emerson is only memorable for looking slightly like Seann William Scott, and his character is a misogynistic horndog who is too stupid to figure out that DERP! being a vampire means KILLING PEOPLE. Autumn Reeser does nothing but whine and screech, and is completely ruled by her hormones. Hmm, becoming a vampire? That's okay if she gets a hot boyfriend!

But the cherry on the bad-acting sundae is Sutherland, who was clearly hired only because he's Kiefer Sutherland's brother. This guy has the acting ability of a lump of concrete, but less charisma -- he just stands around smirking and mumbling in a monotone, like a blond male version of Kristen Stewart.

""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" is not just a bad sequel, but a wretchedly stupid vampire movie in its own right. Avoid at all costs, fan of the first movie or no.",1363305600,3,3144,4.712204007285974

(That was, insidentally, before I became a hipster and matured, and now I've once again matured and become an aging hipster. Ha ha ha ...)  And I went in with the hopes that this would be the great experience for the next generation (or two) since that the original was for me and no doubt many of my peer group.  But ... No dice.

The story is the same save for a few minor changes : two brothers move to a small town (theirs following the death of their parents, the original's following their parents' divorce), and find out rather quickly that there are some strange goings on in their new home.  In particular, there are vampires around them.  Corey Haim was supposed to have a small role, but he showed up on the set far too high to give a cognizant performance.  Corey Feldman has a small part in it, advising the new transplants to keep their eyes open for somethin somethin.

This movie attempted to ""remake"" certain aspects of the original film and throw in Edger Frog (Corey Feldman) in a cameo role. The problem here is that Edger and Sam (Corey Haim) should have been the leads in this film.

As a Lost Boys movie, this movie fails, and only deserves 2.5/5 stars. I gave it an extra half because of Feldman reprising his role as Edger. He did a great job and had some good one liners.

Whats confusing is once&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Boys-The-Thirst/dp/B003W5TO7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Boys: The Thirst</a>&nbsp;was released it seemed to ignore SOME aspects of this film, while keeping other aspects of it, making it confusing as to if this is a direct sequel to 1 or 2...

Also, Corey Haim is only in the movie for 2 minutes at the end, after the credits start rolling. It sucks that he didn't get a bigger part. Its rumored (via The Two Corey's show) that he had started taking drugs again and his role was made smaller, and a lot of his other stuff cut from the film (which some you can see on the DVD's special features.) He really should have been one of the leads in the film, or at least he should have been the person who took the kids in - not some unknown aunt.

To those of you who absolutely hated this movie, give it another shot or two. I hated it with a passion on my first viewing and then a few months later gave it another try and knowing what to expect in it I didn't find it all that bad...as a standalone film.

3455255,1,B001ANQY7Y,"I have never written a review for a DVD before, but this one was so bad that I feel compelled to warn people about it. The only reason anyone should watch Lost Boys: The Tribe is as a lesson in film-making, to see all of the ways in which a sequel can be utterly ruined beyond any hope of salvage.

It is an apt (though unintended) metaphor for the film that it begins with Tom Savini, the legendary make-up and special effects man for countless horror films who has a cameo here, getting his head cut off in the opening sequence, thus eliminating the only person who knows anything about how horror films should be made from the rest of the movie.

Here is a list of everything that went wrong with this movie:

(1) None of the talented people who were behind the original Lost Boys had anything to do with the writing, producing or directing of this wretched sequel. The writing for Tribe is so awful it's hard to believe anyone thought it should be made into a movie. Hans Rodionoff should hereafter be limited to writing menus for fast-food chains. Bad fast-food chains. The directing is so emotionless and disjointed that P.J. Pesce should never be let near a director's chair again unless it's as a gofer to bring the chair to someone who actually knows how to direct a film.

(2) Everything that made the original Lost Boys work is missing from the sequel, most particularly originality and humor. Tribe has not even the tiniest spark of originality and is utterly devoid of the humor that made the original so much fun. The handful of jokes fall utterly flat. A good example of the difference is in the family members the main characters move in with. The original had Bernard Hughes as Grandpa, and he was genuinely funny and engaging in his role. The Tribe has an aunt who is never anything but annoying. Even Corey Feldman, who is genuinely gifted at being funny while playing the roles straight as he did in the original, is left struggling here with the banal dialogue the leaden script has saddled him with, half of which seems to be word-for-word repeats of his dialogue in the first movie.

(3) They're all too old to be ""boys"". In the original Lost Boys, the main characters were meant to be teenagers and they looked it as the actors playing the parts were all between 15 and 21, except for the youngest one - ""Laddie"" - who was 10.  In The Tribe, the ""lost boys"" don't look the part at all because all of the actors are too old, the youngest being 26 and the oldest being 30!

(4) Bad casting. Tad Hilgenbrink and Autumn Reeser, who play the two main characters, are a big part of why this film doesn't work. If nothing else, they deserve Razzies for Worst Brother-Sister Portrayal Of 2008. If there is an absolute minimum that an actor can put of themselves into a role, both Hilgenbrink and Reeser fall short of that minimum. There is never any chemistry between the two of them or between either of them and any of the other actors in the film. And most of the rest of the actors never rise above bland genericness.

(5) Bad editing.  Most particularly with the fact that Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) keeps making references to his brother Alan but Alan Frog (Jamison Newlander) does not make a single appearance in the movie! All of Newlander's scenes were in fact deleted from the final cut, so the repeated references to him stand out like so many sore thumbs. The only place he shows up is in the two alternate endings provided on the DVD, where he is only seen briefly, from behind, where it could have been anyone.

(6) Corey Haim. Corey Haim is arguably the scariest thing about this movie, even though he, like Jamison Newlander, does not actually appear in the movie itself, only in a brief scene inserted in the ending credits and in the two alternate endings. What's scary is that he's almost unrecognizeable - like someone spent the last 20 years beating him with an ugly stick - and all of the talent and promise he showed as a young actor is completely gone. In his brief scenes, he acts and sounds like he showed up late, spent all of ten minutes prepping for his role, stumbled through it and then grabbed his check and ran.

On the plus side, I would mention three of the actors:

Corey Feldman deserves credit for being a professional and putting himself totally into his performance. He's almost the only actor in this movie who seems to actually be trying to make it work, but even he cannot overcome the bad writing and directing.  I've heard there is a Lost Boys 3 in the works in which he will again be appearing. I can only hope that this time around he'll have better luck. He deserves it.

Angus Sutherland was a perfect choice for this movie. He has the talent and is both reminiscent of Kiefer Sutherland in appearance and manner but at the same time distinctly different. You can see enough of him in his scenes to realize how good he could have been. With a decent script and direction, he could have made a memorable vampire successor to the original's David. As it was, however, the leaden script and direction killed any chances he had of doing something with the role.

Monica Delain is incredibly hot and can actually act as well. They could have done a lot more with her in this movie - she was the only decent vampire besides Angus Sutherland - but unfortunately she gets killed off fairly quickly in a completely predictable while at the same time no-I'm-not-buying-this way. Another victim of the bad writing and directing.

Do not waste your money on this movie. If by chance someone gives you a copy for free and you can fast-foward through most of it, then just watch the few bits worth seeing and avoid the rest.",1263686400,2,5675,4.505836575875486

3455260,4,B001ANQY7Y,"Pleae note that the four star review is for anyone buying this DVD and expecting a mindless time waster. If you are expecting a great movie that you can give to your friends and get excited about, forget it. Buy the original cult hit. But if you are expecting a pleasant diversion that reminds you enough of the old movie to hit your nostalgia pleasure centers and moves along at an even clip, this is the movie for you.

Of course, it's still got it's annoying dopiness. Corey Feldman is a truly terrible actor. But at least he's instantly recognizeable as Corey Feldman. I think he looks the same as the old days, but he's also been solidly in the C-List with Howard Stern appearances and those Surreal Life episodes (where somehow he beat out Hammer, Emmanuel Lewis, Vince Neal and the Survivor chicks in order to obtain the designation as ""the annoying one""). When Corey Haim shows up for his requisite cameo, he looks really different from his childhood version. I had to go to IMDB to find out who he was in order to get the joke. But really, Corey Feldman has one acting decision to make and that's to growl like Christian Bale in the Bat Suit. Oh and at one point he drops his voice when he has to mention a family member becoming a vampire.

Thankfully the rest of the cast is a little better, but a lot of the scenes are tailor made to make you remember and appreciate the original. There's the death by antler scene, the sunglasses in the daytime bit, the ""here drink some vampire blood thinking it's wine"" scene and the mysterious woman at the party who learns the guy in. And of course, the main vampire is a very cool longhaired blond dude with facial stubble. He definitely doesn't have the smoldering intensity of Keiffer Sutherland. And for stunt casting and irony, the girl he's trying to seduce is played by Keiffer Sutherland's daughter. And she's actually pretty good.

So all in all, some funny scenes. Some pretty good lines and no real horror. But how many horror movies are that scary? The original is better, but it's not like you need to be told that.",1249344000,3,2078,4.506631299734748

3455267,3,B001ANQY7Y,"My first glimpse of this film was a number of months back when they released it in a very nice package. So, I saw it recently in a terrible package, and decided to buy it anyway.

The first five minutes of LOST BOYS The Tribe basically lead you on, since it is done more along the lines of what the original film did, as well as having Tom Savini's cameo as the victim Vampire,it appears to be  a sequel. Its not to say that the film is not watch-able, just that its not in the same league as the original LOST BOYS, and so its kind of sad to see the brilliant franchise brought back for some wanna-be BLADE vampire seconds. The big plus is Edgar Frog; Corey Feldman reprises his original role in a fairly neat way that really deserved an exposition scene as in ""how I got here from there"" sort of thing. We get plenty of character from Corey in his role, but the director seems so obsessed with showing that Vampires would be Extreme Sport fans with enough cash to use an expensive Hacienda as a play pen, but still stick to Edgars Vampire rules and sleep in a decaying hovel, that it kind of stretches the character element. There are the elements here that could have saved this film, but unfortunately someone forgot to ask for a re-write. Other than that is kind of fun, but if you are expecting LOST BOYS part 2, then do not.

THE DVD: No Commentary at all. The ""Action Junkies"" feature is no biggie to the point of being, WHY?? Its a waste of time, and only a few minutes at that, since it explains very little. Edgar Frog's Guide to Surviving is great, and shows why Corey does such a cool job in the film. The alternate endings are a tad better than the one squeezed in at the finish, and look like it was the basis for a re-shoot ( i.e. someone at the studio decided that this was not going anywhere but direct to video).",1234569600,3,1831,4.240687679083095

There've even been some outstanding horror remakes like John Carpenter's ""The thing"" and also ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" But that's it. These days, when you watch a sequel or a remake of some grand old classic, you get junk. This is a prime example. The movie is so low-budgeted, it would barely make a showing on the Sci-Fi Channel, notorious for its wretched line-up of originals. In this movie, there's no suspense, as there was in the first, as to who the vampires of. In the original, we were teased and treated like intelligent movie buffs. In this one, it's just thrown into your face. We're asked to believe that even vampires go around butchering their buddies, for fun, since we all know they can regenerate themselves.

But to splice open the chest of a fellow cohort and then stagger around whooping and laughing as the victim grunts and curses and then he somehow reforms himself. The brother and sister are totally unlikable for their idiocy. We're asked to believe that the hero is so erotically turned on by this skanky, sluttish girl that he makes out with her--knowing that she's a vampire. And of course, he becomes one. And then his sister becomes one.

It's like the people behind this sequel geared it for the mentally retarded or the very young male, in his early teens, who might dig all this sluttish rolling around.

Oh, for the days, when we were given occasional brilliant sequels and remakes of our old favorites.  The original creators of ""Lost Boys"" are probably rolling around in their graves if they're still alive.

This could have been a winner--instead, it's strictly for the brain dead.",1230854400,,1788,4.773462783171521

The film fails to make you care about any of the characters.  The production values are good, and the acting is decent, but the story is not at all engaging.

3455277,1,B001ANQY7Y,"Like many of you I'm a huge fan of the first Lost Boys movie from 1987. And it proved quite the fond childhood memory for me and always will! But this piece of trash just won't fly! I mean you're joking right?! Unfortunately this movie was ""TOTALLY SCREWED"" from the getgo!! In the first Lost Boys they did the right thing by  makeing it a mystery as to who the vampires were. As if it wasn't bad enough that the surfer characters including Angus Sutherland were talking obscure trash to one another they just had to give away the fact that they were all vampires way too early in the movie!! All I liked about the beginning is that for the first time in 12 years we get to see Tom""Sex Machine""Savini play a vampire again! The problem is not only was it too brief a cameo but for some confusing reason Angus's character Shane and the rest of his vampires got into altercations with him and they ""KILL A FELLOW VAMPIRE!!! His half-brother Keifer's vampire character David wouldn't have done that. And yes Tom's small appearance was the only cool moment in this complete compost heap of a movie!! I mean the script was just dreadful, the acting was even more dreadful(to say nothing of all the performances being completely wooden), they completely wrote off the other Frog brother, Michael, Star, Lucy, and the other Corey was given a cheap, unneccessary and just plain CORNY small appearance at the end credits part. I mean you just can't write off everybody's favorite characters and ever hope to make it just as enjoyable as the first! SORRY!! What's worse is Corey Feldman's acting was not only embarrasing to the max and just didn't have one line that even remotely passed as funny but he was talking with that same stupid gravelly voice that he spoke with in ""The Puppetmaster Vs. The Demonic Toys!! WTF was he attempting a Stallone impression?! 'Cause if so he shouldn't give up his day job!! And even worse his character(Edgar Frog) kept on half bringing up this story about him having lost his brother Alan Frog somehow, but he neither goes into any real detail about it nor is there ever even a flashback. HUH?!! And in general the cast that they do work with are so bad that I hope they never act again. In particular Angus Sutherland is  every bit as handsome as Keifer but he neither possesses his talent nor Donald's either! LOL!! All that was good about this movie was the nudity that's it. Even though it was very cheesey the way it was presented. What I really hated was the surfer vampires first wanting to keep a low-profile only to tease and taunt the cops while one delivers a cheesey attempt to rip-off that famous line from ""The Warriors""! And also it was unbelievable stupid and disgusting when the vampires would for no apparent reason mutilate eachother just for fun. How SICK!! And why was there no explanation as to how they could later regenerate!! I just couldn't make any sense out of why no two vampires ever seem to die the same way either. Let's see we impale one on deerhorns and she turns to what looked like hail stones. And another after having a stake go through him is chundering blood and oozing what looks like shaving cream. And when shane gets killed we see a cheesey/fake looking special effect of him on fire?! Wait a minute I saw that vampire death the first time when it happened in the Blade movies!! And as for the deerhorns death well not only did that kind of death already get used in Silent Night,Deadly Night but also in the first Lost Boys! How Original!! LOL. And the soundtrack forget about it!! There were no impressive songs in the soundtrack at all!! All I'm saying is if you love the first Lost Boys as much as I did than definitly steer clear of this garbage all together! PS They also want to make a Goonies sequel and well considering how bad this sh** was ""let's hope they never do""!!!",1226016000,4,3850,4.522238163558106

Well i watched it last night and...it was not as bad. The acting for the most part was really good and the movie was pretty ok. The worst acting, i think, was from Angus Sutherland. Perhaps his father Donald should teach him one or two things about acting :)
 But some things raised my mind every now and again. First, are Chris and Nicole Emerson the children of Mikael and Star (from the first movie?)  we are never told.  Second, in the mine scenes, a vampire tells Edgar Frog that his brother is here, but i didn't see him ??? confused.

After seeing the T.V. series ""The Two Coreys"" I was not surprised though. Haim was so messed up he could not get the lines right. It is always so hard to see good actors loose their edge!

Feldman overacts, as usual. BUT, that's to be expected... after all, Lost Boys is kinda campy. However, I was impressed with Angus Sutherland.

3455287,2,B001ANQY7Y,"I read the reviews prior to purchasing this video.  I title this review disappointed because I am disappointed in myself for not paying attention to the other reviewers; they were spot on.

Second comings never live up to their predecessors...we know this, but usually it is because the story can't be retold any better.  There is no reason to add to that a group of people that can't act.

So the opening scene is where the guys are getting their boards and jumping the fence...the producers didn't even try to make it sound like they were actually there; the actors were in the studio reading the script.  This tells you just how bad this movie is going to be from the very beginning.

Forget the fact that the vampires are surfers...the first Lost Boys were motorcycle riders...so what.

I am disappointed in the atrocious acting.  The actors didn't really seem like they cared about the movie...why should I?

Ok and why is this movie ""starring"" Corey Haim?  His part is minimal and thrown in at the end.  Corey Feldman...dude...learn to act.

The only thing I liked about this movie is that it explained that all you have to do is pierce the heart to kill the vampire.  Thus explaining the deer antler killing.  This was never explained in the first one and it always bugged me.  Now I know that if I ever encounter a vampire I don't have to reach for my wooden stake; I can simply throw them at my antlers hanging on the wall.

I would recommend seeing this movie simply because I subscribe to the theory that misery loves company.

Now I have to watch the first one just to get these awful visions out of my head.

By the way, I am not a professional movie critic...I just had to throw my two cents in.",1221523200,,1709,4.458064516129032
3455288,3,B001ANQY7Y,"Lost Boys injected a perfect blend of fun campiness with bloodsucking mayhem, and now in the wake of so many copycats and twenty one long years, Lost Boys the Tribe can only hope to equal the competition's fervor. And The Tribe does just that, equals but never rivals it's competitors. It's hard enough knowing that you're making a sequel to such a time honored coming of age as a vampire film. When you tack on the time frame since the original and some amazingly terrific vampire outings in other films, your job as a filmmaker begins to look like a more daunting task than being the next president elect. Still, The Tribe has some great moments with a much gorier band of blood hounds in search of their next victims and it's just not gonna be any good if we can't have our vampire hunter Frog on the case once again. Feldman does inject some of the film's best personality and keeps the frenetic action in check with his tongue in cheek please-take-me-seriously earnest belief that there are indeed vampires that need his services of a wood, metal and new carbon fiber stake wielding, holy water balloon cannon carrying vampire hunter. That's not to say there aren't other moments of humor thrust on the shoulders of the other actors. They are there, but sparse, as it should be. If you're looking for a ride as thrilling as you'll get in a vampire movie, see the original Lost Boys. There's also a cameo appearance from Corey Haim, so watch for that.

No one was fooled by the stock surfing footage or the overcast skies of Southwestern BC. Angus Sutherland did not come through. He was just not eerie enough like his older half brother, Keifer Sutherland was in the first, and his quick demise at the end was ridiculous! If the writers had any sense they would have dropped the whole ""lets do the same sort of story again but with better effects and some nudity"" and focused on a story true Lost Boys fans (and probably a whole new generation) would have actually liked--perhaps developing one of the alternate endings which had definite potential--we all would have had a great time!

3455297,2,B001ANQY7Y,"""The Lost Boys; The Tribe"" Directed by P.J. Pesce

Chris Emerson (Tad Hilgenbrink) is on a down hill slide. Chris was set to take over the pro surfing circuit but after an altercation with another surfer Chris's bad reputation has gotten him kicked off the tour. To top that off, Chris's parents have been killed in a car wreck and Chris is left to care for his 17 year old sister Nicole (Autumn Reeser). Chris and Nicole land in Luna Bay California where an aunt had agreed to let them stay...for $650 a month. Things aren't looking all down though, Chris is discovered by Shane Powers (Angus Sutherland) a former pro surfer who for some unknown reason left pro surfing and wasn't heard from again. Shane wants Chris to come to a party later that night...

""Lost Boys; The Tribe"" is pretty much what you are expecting. ""The Tribe"" is a bad B movie sequel which was made far too late to retain any of its star power but is still trying to ride off of its predecessor's name. It does appear that it worked a little though as I was compelled to see it even though I knew what I was going to get and I don't seem to be the only one.

The Good: Its predecessor and I have to admit it was kind of cool to see Corey and Corey on screen again even if it was just for a second and in a terrible movie.

The Bad: Pretty much all the things you expect. A terrible script with a ludicrous plot and ""Buffy Like"" special effects (Which were fine for Buffy but not for this). The action sequences all felt inserted and forced. The plot itself felt tumbled together and rushed and the character development is extremely weak. Feldman seemed to be trying to Play Edward Frog as saltier version of the character which was pretty funny even though it wasn't intended to be.

Overall: Many will have to see this movie just because of what it is. That being the case, go in with low expectations and you won't be disappointed.",1219536000,,1906,4.342696629213483
3455298,2,B001ANQY7Y,"I thought, ""Wow, this is either going to be REALLY okay or a solid awful."" It was really okay.
Straight-to-video horror has this motif where gory or crazy scenes are sped up. It looks dumb, but for some reason it's done here, as well. Strike one.
The script was awful. There are so many nods to the first one that the movie begins to feel like a cheap knock-off rather than a sequel. The big scene in the credits was cool but made little sense. And the Allan Frog scenes were deleted. Strike two.
Strike three would have been weak characters, but I remembered that, like the first one, the characters reflect what passes for cool at the time. So it ulimately makes sense that the vampires are interchangeable party animals with no depth, or that the head vampire, a surprisingly good character, dresses like he's off to some vamp club. By faulting the movie for that would be a social commentary, not so much the writers' faults here.
Feldman's scenes are the best, as others here have stated. If you are, like me, a fan of the first one and need to kill your curiousity, go ahead and see it. But trust me, you already know what to expect without these reviews to tell you.",1219536000,,1173,4.435185185185185

The acting was HORRIBLE, had exact same story as the 1st, 1 sibling fighting for the other, a crazy relative saying random stuff. Honestly, I'm embarrased maybe was it made to be a joke or were they serious. Feldman had the same lines as he did in the 1st one and whats his name Angus had the same lines kiefer used in the 1st one. Ive never laughed so hard and I'm kinda pissed.

3455303,1,B001ANQY7Y,"Oh My God. This movie was AWFUL.
First of all, the plot is confusing and has more holes than swiss cheese. The two main characters are Chris and Nicole Emerson, brother and sister,  and have the same last name as Michael and Sam in the first movie, and they say their parents were killed in a car crash, but they never mention who the parents are. One has to assume they are the children of Michael and Star. They arrive to live with a wacky aunt, who's character is a lame attempt to recapture the eccentric Grandfather in the first film. She is their aunt, but who is she related to? Is she Star's sister? Or is she a great aunt and related to Lucy (the mother in the first film?). And where is Lucy? Is she dead? What about the Grandfather? And what happened to Laddie, the young boy from the first film?
The two main actors are awful, but not as awful as Angus Sutherland, the main vampire character Shane Powers.  He looks like a WalMart version of Tom Cruise's Lestat , with long blond hair and billowy shirts. He speaks like Keanu Reeves, sounding stoned the entire time. He is not intimidating at all. He completely lacks any kind of menace.
And because he is a Sutherland, albeit the half brother of Kiefer, his performance has to be compared.  But he reminds me of Bill and Ted Become Vampires more than the evil that was David in the first film.
The film is unintentionally funny at moments and overly gory, in an obvious attempt to out do the tame gore of the 1980s and also make up for the horrible script. The camera effects are lame, in an attempt to make you feel like you're on an acid trip that fails.
And please in the name of all that is decent in this world someone STOP Corey Feldman from ever acting again. His reprisal of his role as Edgar Frog is the perhaps the worst performance of the decade. He uses a fake throaty voice that makes Christian Bale's Batman sound like a soprano singer.",1219190400,3,1913,4.337988826815643

Other than that it was kinda a remake.  The acting was great and the script was solid save the nostalgic tag lines from the 80s movie.  I wish the they didn't do that and simply built upon Cory's character.  Also it would have been nice to mention the other characters from the first movie.  If Edgar got a package from Mike in the mail or something, it would have been nice.  All in all it seemed like a remake of the old movie and that's what annoys me the most.  I feel really bad for all the actors, set designers, sound people etc. that obviously worked really hard.  A chain is only as strong as the weakest link and in this case it was the writer.

3455310,2,B001ANQY7Y,"I should start off by saying,  this was not a bad movie.  It does however fall short of the original.  This in regards to make up, plot and script.  The first movie was scary and funny at the same time seemingly without trying.  This was in thanks to not only to  the frog brothers but also to grandpa played by Barnard Hughes.  There was a potential for Gabrielle Rose to fill that void in her role as Aunt Jillian but unfortunately this was not taken advantage of. Who can forget grandpa cracking open a nice cold root beer as he remarks ""One thing about living in Santa Carla I never could stomach... all the damn vampires."" Also the twist with Edward Herrmann (great casting) as Max being the lead vampire. I was expecting something like that with the tribe,  but alas there was nothing - and it just seemed like the whole vampire clan went down with out much of a fight.

The first movie was far superior without the additional nudity and gore.  Lost boys the tribe - Its worth a rent,  but not a buy.",1218326400,2,1006,4.32620320855615
3455311,2,B001ANQY7Y,"The first movie was made on a shoestring budget and not expected to do very well.  Well it did and given its popularity and status as a ""cult classic"" one would think Warner Bros. would've put more thought behind the creation of a sequel.  Obviously whoever was in charge of that particular department was asleep on the job because this movie stunk.  It's not even good enough to be deemed a remake or stand alone title.
  The plot was shallow, the acting was so-so (Feldman over-acted big time), and the story generally stunk.  J. Schumacher was right; this movie should never have been made.  Also, Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves for making it.",1218240000,2,660,4.6869565217391305
3455312,1,B001ANQY7Y,"You would think with 20 years to work on it, and a dedicated fanbase, that Warners could come up with something better than this crap, especially since original director Joel Shumacher wanted to make a sequel called ""The Lost Girls"". Obviously they went for the quick buck and a direct to DVD waste of time. Basically, take the entire plot from the first film and replace real actors with a bunch of emo kids. And who told Queefer Sutherland's brother he could act? Corey Feldman also turns in an awful performance, trying to sound like the new Batman when he speaks, because he's so actory. And relegating Corey Haim to the deleted scenes and post credits, who thought that was a good idea? Half the reason people wanted to see this travesty was to see the two Coreys reunite as their most popular characters. Yeah, I know Haim had a drug meltdown on the set, but it's not like it made his ""acting"" that much worse. This garbage has the production quality of a bad Sci-Fi Channel movie, sans any interesting characters, plot, sets, budget, humor, or even camp for that manner.

3455313,3,B001ANQY7Y,"I went into this DVD thinking of it as a ""retelling"" instead of a sequel, and honestly it wasn't that bad.  The story was solid, character development was decent, and the FX were damn good for another no-budget, straight to DVD horror movie. It was a difficult task for the filmmakers to take on a classic like Lost Boys, but they definitely tried.  I think it would have been a much better movie if they would have stayed away from the ""Lost Boys"" title and just let it stand on it's own.  But I would say that it's worth the rental price if you like good bloody vampire films, with some good comic relief.  Of course it had the usual uncalled for and frequent nudity seen in all low budget horror nowadays, but that's no surprise.  What was a surprise was the single thing that really got me laughing... they quoted The Big Lebowski twice in the first 20 minutes!!!  Any movie that does that is alright in my book!

3455314,2,B001ANQY7Y,"Having never been much of a fan of the original Lost Boys (give me Near Dark any day of the week), I didn't expect much out of Lost Boys: The Tribe, a direct to DVD sequel that is about as good as it can be.  Most notably about the film is that Corey Feldman returns as vampire hunter Edgar Frog, who is duking it out with a new tribe of vamps led by Shane (Angus Sutherland) who soon sets his sights on Emerson cousins Chris (Tad Hilgenbrink) and Nicole (Autumn Reeser).  Featuring a surprising amount of gore and an even more surprisingly good performance from Feldman, Lost Boys: The Tribe is marred mainly by the performances from the rest of the cast and some sloppy direction (mainly during fight sequences) to go along with some bad editing to boot.  It's a shame considering this actually could have been decent at best, but it is what it is, and chances are you know what you'll be getting here.  For die hard fans of the original Lost Boys, you may find a degree of enjoyment out of Lost Boys: The Tribe regardless, and if you do, make sure to stick around after the credits.",1218067200,2,1085,4.356435643564357
3455315,1,B001ANQY7Y,"When I first heard that they were making a sequel to the 1987 hit ""The Lost Boys,"" I was floored. Why would they do such a dumb thing? I wondered. Supposedly, a script for a sequel floated around Hollywood for years before it finally fell through, and after watching ""Lost Boys: The Tribe,"" I see why the legitimate Hollywood gave up on it.

Forget the fact that there isn't one single original idea in the script. Forget that, even after 21 years, the special effects in the original film are far better than ""Tribe."" Forget that there is a lot more nudity, gore, and foul language in ""Tribe"" than there ever was in the original. Forget all of that. This film is just plain bad. It sucks, if you'll pardon the pun.

If you have seen ""The Lost Boys,"" then you've pretty much seen a vastly superior version of ""Lost Boys: The Tribe."" In my opinion, a great horror movie must have several things...a really good script, characters you actually care about, superb actors to bring those characters to life, some humor, and decent special effects. ""The Lost Boys"" had all of that, and more, whereas ""Lost Boys: The Tribe,"" only wishes it had 1/10th of what its predecessor had.

The story is the same...siblings move to a crappy little coastal town where the missing person population is staggering and jobs are hard to come by. This time, it's Chris & Nicole Emerson (any relation to Mike & Sam from the first film? Apparently, the writers were too lazy to come up with a different last name.) Their parents are dead (instead of divorced, as in the first film; Mike & Sam show up at Grandpa's house with mom,) so they are forced to rent a house owned by their aunt.

They go to a party. Nicole (Autumn Reeser) catches the eye of obvious head vampire Shane (Angus Sutherland, who definitely does NOT have brother Kiefer's talent at all.) She drinks from a flask, which obviously has more than booze in it, and voila! She becomes a half-vampire, much to the shock and dismay of her brother, Chris (Tad Hilgenbrink.) Enter Corey Feldman as Edgar Frog, the only returning original cast member that has any decent screen time. He's still getting ideas from the comic books, slaying vampires, and is still a complete weirdo. Feldman is LONG past his prime here. What worked for him as a teenager definitely does not work in his mid-30s. His character, who makes it clear that he lost a loved one to the vamps a while ago, should be more darker, and have more of an edge. The childish, home-made gadgets should be left behind, but they're still in use. I would have liked to see Jamison Newlander reprise his role as Allen Frog, because that may have made the film slightly more tolerable, but instead, we only see him in the 2 alternate endings that are included on the DVD. Don't get me started on Corey Haim showing up as a vampire during the end credits. That made no sense at all, and the 2 alternate endings he's in (as a human) make no sense. It was nice to see them on screen together, but Haim is not the cute kid he once was, and Feldman just looks pissed that he's even there to begin with.

As far as the other vampires go, they were all annoying, obnoxious adrenaline junkies (think ""Point Break"" meets ""The Lost Boys,"" & you'll get the idea.) They surf, skate, ride motorcycles, and take great joy in stabbing each other for fun. They videotape their kills, and go ""whoooooo hooooooo"" a lot. They are nowhere near as evil or menacing as the original 4 vamps from the first film (Kiefer Sutherland, Alex Winter, Brooke McCarter, & Billy Wirth.) Kiefer Sutherland, as nice a man as he may be, has the most evil, menacing face and voice that I've ever seen & heard on film, and he was absolutely perfect in the original. He really should give his brother, Angus, some serious acting lessons. Apparently, the filmmakers thought that casting a Sutherland boy would give the film an air of credibility, which, sad to say, it did not. Kiefer's David in the first film had an evil, menacing seductiveness about him, whereas Angus' Shane only has plain seductiveness, without any real evil or menace, and even the seductiveness isn't that convincing.

The amount of gore, nudity, & unnecessary foul language in the film is substantial, as well as the serious lack of creativity (in one scene, dialogue from the first film is recited, word for word; it's Edgar talking about the various ways a vampire will ""buy it...it's never a pretty sight. Some yell & scream, some go quietly. Some explode, some implode. But all will try to take you with them."") I was flabbergasted. It's one thing to recite a famous line, like Bruce Willis does in the ""Die Hard"" films (""Yippee-ki-ay, motherf***er,) but to recite dialogue, verbatim, from an earlier film...it only goes to prove how hard ""Tribe"" tries to be like the original ""Lost Boys.""  They even went so far as to put the tag line from the original film in as dialogue. All I could do is shake my head in amazement. What little humor it has seems forced, as well.

I must say, however, that I did chuckle a couple of times at some of the fresh one-liners. I already forgot what they were, but they were funny. And most important, they weren't ripped right out of the original film. I also like the remix of ""Cry Little Sister,"" Gerard McMann's theme to ""The Lost Boys."" The video for this remix is included on the DVD, although it's not on the official soundtrack to ""Tribe."" There is another cover of ""Cry Little Sister"" (done by another band) that is on the soundtrack, though; you can hear it when you're at the main menu.

Also, I must say this about the Coreys. They are more than their past mistakes. If Hollywood were as forgiving back in the 80's as it is today, I feel they would still have very strong careers. They are both very talented actors; all one has to do is watch films like ""Stand By Me,"" ""Lucas,"" ""Silver Bullet,"" or ""The Goonies"" to see that. Hopefully, they will both realize that what worked for them when they were younger won't work for them today. They don't have to be a Hollywood joke or stuck in an A&E reality show for the rest of their lives. Even though my teenage crush on both of them ended years ago, I still like them as actors. They just need better parts (and, apparently, better agents.)

""The Lost Boys"" had a great story, a strong cast, characters I actually gave a crap about, just the right amount of humor, and great special effects for its time. ""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" tries in vain to be all of these things, but it only achieves one thing...being a truly disappointing and forgettable piece of trash that deservedly went straight to video. The magic that was ""The Lost Boys"" was left back in 1987, and even though this film tries in vain to recapture that magic with nearly identical characters, storylines, and a ""stunned-look"" ending, it only succeeds in gloriously failing to do so. Perhaps the makers knew all along that it would be a failure that never should have happened. Now, I must cleanse myself of the memories of this film. I'm going to watch ""The Lost Boys."" 100 viewings should do it.",1218067200,22,7085,4.5498039215686275
3455316,1,B001ANQY7Y,"This Movie ""The Lost Boys-The Tribe"" has about No connection with the Original ""The Lost Boys"".  This ""Lost Boys-The Tribe"" is like an old 'Early Movie Cheapie'.  The Original ""The Lost Boys"" is pretty good; but this new unconnected one is crummy.  No wonder Amazon hasn't 'pushed' it.",1218067200,,285,4.895833333333333
3455317,1,B001ANQY7Y,"First of all, I'm whacking myself for not only buying this, but spending the extra bucks to get it on Blu-Ray, which my High Def TV proved to show Just How Bad this straight to DVD is.  I've never even seen a standard DVD show up as fuzzy as this alleged Blu-Ray did.

On to the DVD, though discussing the sheer vileness of the Blu-Ray quality is much more entertaining than reviewing this movie.  I know it sounds like a bad pun, but it sucks.  It sucks bad.  It sucks big.  It sucks beyond human or vampire belief.  There was more of a plot in the occasional speculation about WHAT the plot of the movie would be than there actually was in the actual movie.

For example, the orphaned Emerson siblings - how are they related to the original Emersons?  First I heard they were supposed to be Michael and Star's children, then I heard they were some random cousins.  Regardless, it is never, ever brought up in the movie.  They might as well be, and apparently are, people who coincidentally have the same last name as the original name.  Certainly Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) has absolutely no recognition or acknowledgement of them being in any way related to the Emerson's he knew, even in a surprise scene hidden in the credits and a deleted scene available in the extras which show him interacting with the late, unlamented Corey Haim reprising Sam Emerson.

And, yes, I know that Haim isn't dead.  I just can't help but notice in those two brief scenes not actually in the movie that there was all the plot you needed for a really interesting and decent movie.  Judging from the massive bad press revolving around Haim, his 'issues', and his self-declared war with Feldman - well, knowing that most of his stuff in the film was not filmed and the bit that was filmed was tossed; I can only blame Haim for the massive mess leftover and the massive mess certainly is why the movie didn't make it to the theatres.  In short, Haim's killed himself and his career for good this time, I'd say, and took down a bunch of other innocent people in the bargain.

Moving along, the other massively unused potential plot-builder was the fact that the master vampire in this film is played by Keifer Sutherland's young half-brother.  Angus Sutherland's resemblance is close enough to have actually made use of that connection - his character of Shane could very well have been the brother of Keifer's David.  Unfortunately, like the Emerson connection was utterly ignored as a potential plot point, so was the use of the Sutherland brothers.

There were a few blink and you missed it moments, such as the muscular, oily saxaphone player from the first movie now playing sax on the corner, in the daylight, still oiled, still pretty muscular, still long-haired, but with a beer gut like a Green Bay Packer fan.  Tom Savini, one of the masters of horror prosthetics and special effects (who is oddly showing up in a lot of movies for the sake of being dismembered, if Planet Terror is any indication), is a master vampire taken down by Shane and his crew in the beginning of the film.  When the Emerson's take a drive up to the Frog Brother's surfboard shaping shop, there is a sign that is briefly glimpsed which states essentially 'no one is invited in.'  If you don't get that reference, sorry, I'm not explaining it.

The only occasional glimpses of fun is when Edgar Frog is on the scene.  He's mostly doing a re-run, but there are a few fun elements such as him becoming an ordained priest online so he can make his own holy water, which he does over many water balloons as part of his arsenal.  He only occasionally references the absent Frog brother, but the full story is in the deleted scene.

Every other attempt to make this a worthwhile sequel is full of downfalls.  In the original you had the quirky grandfather who delivers the famous last line in the movie, ""The one thing I always hated about Santa Clara is all the damned vampires.""  In this movie you have an aunt whose quirkyness manifests in barefisted greed (she's charging her orphaned nephew and niece $600 a month for a hut) and total cluelessness (having won the battle against the vampires, the Emerson siblings, covered in blood and gore and drinking beers despite at least one of them being underage, have their front door slammed in as their aunt rails about knowing exactly what's going on and it had better stop or she'll turn them in - yes, that's essentially the last line in the movie, her accusing them of being potheads and stating ""zero tolerance!"").

The extras are pathetic, no commentary to explain why this is so horrible, the deleted scene which shows what kind of movie it COULD have been (ironically with Haim at one point telling Feldman that he needs to grow up and take a realistic view on things), and about half a dozen music videos that really aren't worth watching.

Now I have to go email some friends and hopefully warn them against buying this abomination.",1217980800,8,4951,4.604783599088838

3455320,1,B001ANQY7Y,"I had high hopes for this film (although the clue should have been that it went straight to DVD) because I remember FONDLY the original. I mean I actually drove to Blockbuster, even though I have become a ""by demand"" junkie. Never having to leave the house and clicking ""buy"" while sitting on your sofa. How easy can renting a video get? I kept seeing the advertisements and was too impatient to wait. Anyway, while I was driving, I thought ""how bad could it be"" with a Sutherland (Keifer played in the original along with Jami Gertz and Corey Haim)? It is my opinion that Lost Boys II is really, really bad. I mean, you would think that with a better budget and better special effects, it should have been a decent film, or at least as good, if not better than the original.

Ex-surfer with issues turned guardian (Chris) and his sister (Nicole) move to Luna Bay (renting from their aunt) where people ""mysteriously disappear"" all the time. Coincidence? Probably not! On top of that, Chris wants to protect his little sister from the sexy but slightly weird, ex-surfer, Shane (played by Angus Sutherland, Keifer's younger brother), who left the surfing circuit mysteriously.  Where has Shane been and what has he been up to? Soon, Chris begins to suspect that the strange occurrences in Luna Bay may be related to the mysterious Shane and his group of followers, who are all adrenalin junkie/video playing pranksters (they jokingly eviscerate each other). Anyway, the story is pretty predictable...boy meets girl; boy decides he wants girl for an eternity; boy (who is secretly a vampire) tricks girl into drinking his blood, thus partially turning her; brother of girl knows something strange is going on in this small town and has a dislike for the bad boy; brother feels a duty to protect sister and prevent her from becoming the undead by taking a life; boy decides to embrace (only partially) the dark side; vampire hunter schools boy on the basic vamp tricks and terminology; brother along with vampire hunter, Edgar Frog (whose voice goes with his name) attempt to locate the nest of the vamps; and finally a big showdown between bad boy vamp and brother where sister must decide whose side she is on.

Why then, if the movie was so bad did I give it a star? (1) Because I really liked the remake of the theme song; (2) Angus Sutherland was ok and I do see potential; and (3) because I loved the original.",1217894400,3,2413,4.672941176470588

Hell, Clint Eastwoods voice gets on my nerve but I will still pay to see him in a movie. If you are hesitating to see this movie because it went straight to dvd, don't.

3455322,2,B001ANQY7Y,"As an avid ""Lost Boys"" fan, I was sadly disappointed in ""Lost Boys:  The Tribe.""  I have waited 21 years for this?  The 1987 blockbuster is my all time favorite vampire flick.  I am a big horror DVD collector, sporting some 300 plus horror genre DVDs; therefore, I have a lot of vampire related DVDs.  But, wow, what a huge let down with this new flick.  The beginning looked intriguing.  I was hopeful.  Those hopes were quickly dashed.  There were spells of drought in this movie where the storyline just dragged.  The storyline was very familiar being that it was a twist and turn away from the original ""Lost Boys"" storyline.  My biggest disappointment with this film is that it never mentioned Sam Emerson.  I mean, Chris and Nicole Emerson were the main characters who came to rent a house from their aunt.  The teens parents had died.  Who were their parents?  I had read reviews before the DVD was released that the character of Chris Emerson was Sam's nephew.  However, this was never solidified,  And I would have thought that if Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) knew what Chris' last name was, that he would be inquistive if it was his old pal, from the original movie, relative. And, if Chris is Sam's nephew, does that mean that Chris and Nicole's parents were Michael Emerson and spouse??  I did enjoy seeing Corey Feldman reprise his role of one of the vampire slashing Frog brothers, but there wasn't enough of him. AND MY MOST DISAPPOINTING part of this movie was the way Sam Emerson's character was treated.  For goodness sake, a brief cameo is all Corey Haim got???  That is a true shame!  Corey Haim's character was one of my favorite, if not my favorite character from the original film.  Okay, Haim has had some personal problems in his life, but who the heck hasn't?  This is no reason to cheat the fans on what could have been a great film.  Sam Emerson and Edgar Frog should have been partners for all these years.  I mean, good grief, mention Michael Emerson or his mother. And yes, Sam could have still been a vampire, but maybe a good one.  Oh well, I could be here for days venting about this but to what avail?  We were cheated as loyal fans to the original cult classic.  There were simply too many questions left unanswered from the first film.  If they were going to reprise the character of Edgar Frog, then at least make mention of a few of the other key players from the first film.",1217894400,2,2412,4.505773672055427
3455323,1,B001ANQY7Y,"Turned this off half way through, this movie isn't a patch on the first.  Many like myself looked forward to this sequel because of the lively style and the fresh feel of the first (the first was actually entertaining).  Why would the producers of this one think we want to watch something so different.  This was not a 'Lost Boys' sequel, this was a miserable dark, gratuitously violent, over sexualized (for time filler I suspect) movie trying to get success using the name and setting of the first.  I wish I had rented it first, then I would not feel so bad having wasted my money on the dvd. This gets a generous one reluctant star rating from me, and the one star belongs to Corey Feldman, without whom this movie would not have any rateable merit.  That is my opinion anyway.",1217808000,2,782,4.47887323943662
3455324,1,B001ANQY7Y,"Although I am a big fan of the original ""Lost Boys"", I went into this movie with a VERY open mind and with no real expectations. I just hoped that the film was, at the very least, watchable. Well let me just say, BARELY. This movie isn't good. Period. It's poorly executed - sequel or no sequel. The pacing is off. The direction is amateurish - like ""The Grudge"" or ""Pulse"" meets a bad MTV video. The movie uses gratuitous nudity and language to try and make up for the fact that it sucks, yet it brings out the film's flaws even that much more. The original ""Lost Boys"" didn't need extreme gore or nudity because it was relying on other things like a good story and good acting. This story is just a rehash of the first ""Lost Boys"" with a few things switched around. The movie even incorporates lines from the first film, which may have been cool if the movie was good, but since it's not, it comes off as more of an insult.

In the movie, there is a love scene between Reeser and Sutherland that is shot like the Michael/Star scene in the original with the same ""Lost Boys"" theme song playing. However, the love scene is emotionless. Any vampire could see it's just a bloodless imitation of the thirst-quenching original (sorry, I couldn't resist using some vampy adjectives there). Also, the film's vampire death lore is inconsistent. For example, sometimes when a vampire is killed, it turns to stone. Other times it explodes, turns to dust, vomits gallons of blood -- WTF? Edgar Frog, (played by Corey Feldman) addresses it with the same line from the first film: ""No two bloodsuckers go the same way. Some yell and scream, some go quietly, some explode, some implode, but all will try to take you with them"". That kind of explains it but no vampires turned to stone or dust in the first one. Since this is a sequel, shouldn't they have stuck to the original? ""Death by stereo"", anyone? I don't know it just seemed like an excuse to use some CGI.

As for the acting -- the lead actor, Tad Hilgenbrink (who plays Chris Emerson) is horrible -- please don't act again, dude. PLEASE!!! This guy may look like Jason Patrick but he has zero acting skills. Autumn Reeser who plays Nicole Emerson is not much better and is pretty forgettable. Angus Sutherland, who plays the main vamp, Shane, falls really far from his family tree. He possesses none of the skills of his famous father, Donald, or his half-brother Kiefer. What's up with his accent? He's like half-surfer, half-Brit? Very strange. So acting-wise, this movie gets like an F+. That excludes, Corey Feldman, of course, the only ray of hope in the whole mess. Jamison Newlander (Alan Frog) was cut out of the entire film and Corey Haim (Sam Emerson) appears in a 20-30 second cameo in the end credits. Why would they cut Alan Frog out of the story? Jamison Newlander filmed several scenes for this movie and all were cut. Why? He could have been a great addition. In fact, they should have just scrapped the two leads and made the entire movie with Haim, Feldman, and Newlander. In fact, if you like ""Lost Boys"" (which I'm guessing you do since you're reading this), check out the four comic mini-series, ""Lost Boys: Reign Of The Frogs"". It tells the story of the original gang between the end of first film and the beginning of this one. It's far more enjoyable than ""The Tribe"".

Out of everything in this disaster of a movie, I enjoyed Corey Feldman and the Haim cameo at the end. I also liked the alternate endings available on the DVD's special features. Other than that, this movie was a complete letdown and ruined what could have been a successful franchise theatrically or on home video.",1217808000,53,3655,4.560121765601218

This B movie was nothing more than a thrown together mish-mosh just to give Angus Sutherland some face time on the big screen.

The acting was ridiculous. The effects were amature. The story was just plain boring.

Comparing this to the original Lost Boys is like comparing Bram Stoker's Dracula to Kung Fu Vampire.

3455329,3,B001ANQY7Y,"Okay i loved the new Lost Boys, though honestly the leader, Angus Sutherland, I would have picked soemone else or made his character personality different. I think the director/writer whoever was trying to make an updated Keifer and it didn't work with this guy. He looked tooooo much like a surfer guy and I just wasn't believing him. If they made him moreso a ""Twilight"" kinda guy and had him indifferent about vampires killing people then that might have worked but then again, that's not a leader type dude right? The effects were suprisingly good (minus the blood stuff)The other vampires were great.

As far as the movie

Pros: Corey FELDMAN!!! Wow he doesn't age! He made the movie hot. If he wasn't in it this movie would have gotten an F- from me. The part about him being a minister, MADE SENSE!!! So Props to script for that and his weapons were cool, the bandana was cool.

Nudity was a plus!!! Not dumb, kinda realistic and good right.

The aunt was a plus. I cracked up at all of her scenes. That was a plus for the script.
Cons: Unless my hearing is bad, the cast sometimes needed to redo their lines in the studio b/c i couldn't understand some of them. Was it just me? I turned on the subtitles.

Script: wayyyy too many holes in the script. Like at the party when one of the vamps stabbed the other one, did the guests get that or were they all vampires (specifically the girl)

Ummm the scene with them vs the cops? didn't get that.

The weird kid that liked Lisa? Why say be safe and then go walking at night by yourself?? the lines should have been rewritten somewhere!!! I thought he knew there were vampires in town.

The storyline with Lisa sometimes didn't work. She struggled then she didn't. Sometimes I was thinking wow re do the script. I liked her voice though very trademarky so I'm sure she'll get more roles!

Vampire look- i know usually getting different directors you'll get different looks. I don't get though why there were several versions of Vampires in it. i know people were inspired by Buffy's makeup. So nothing new.

Others from the original movie should have been in this film, like in the movie, none of that in the credits or alternate ending stuff. that was crap and  a letdown.

Last con about the movie- the Frog extra feature. I pretty much got everything from watching the movie. If Corey had been Corey and talked about the weapons and maybe behind the scenes, I could have dugged that. If the comic books were real (which i doubt) I would have gone to go buy them, i know there'sa comic out so I'll go buy that

Like I said Corey Feldman made this movie decent. The promotion was great and I liked the music!!!! (i know some people didn't but i liked it) I got through the movie, I didn't turn it off early so that was a plus but I was expecting more.... I still say watch it/rent it but man this didn't come close to the original. And wasn't the best as far as remakes of stuff.

3455336,2,B001ANQY7Y,"Let me break it down in the good and bad. The GOOD: More Gen-X attitude - Raw nudity, wrecklessness and youtube generation, the pre-initiation scene with the local police,the beach party massacre, rock remake of cry little sister, Edgar Frog 80's cliche character. And now the BAD: Predictable plot ( girl doesn't listen to brother, girl falls in love with bad guy, girl becomes victim ), the love scene wasn't as passionate as original, it had different circumstances and should not have tried to be duplicated, too much blood and gore except the beach fire massacre, the vamp gang acting like immature brats than cool, no real back story of the original the characters last name emerson just like the original what ties do they truly have ( Sam <Corey Haim> should have been in it more, drugs or not ), where the hell is the other Frog brother ?, should have kept the original music as well as the new, the lost boys were made the life of the party when they were actually outcast in the original, am surprised any feminist groups didn't boycott this movie like they do others, because the women were made to look as sex objects and just victims, again it is ""lost boys"", besides the song, where does sister come in anyway ?

Things they should have changed: The gang killed another vampire in the beginning but the writers didn't capitalize on that, that would have been a good direction, more members in the group which have led to more action, not party boys - outcast, misfits, no sister act, more corey haim, character back story, and wheres the other Frog ( deleted scene )?!

As a die hard fan of the original, I was dissappointed in the finished product, but mainly because of the name sake, and the plot line. This movie was OK, just should have been released under another title as just another vampire movie, NOT LOST BOYS!!",1217635200,,1837,4.597560975609756
3455337,3,B001ANQY7Y,"After watching LOST BOYS 2: THE TRIBE a lot of things came to mind. First of all, the quality of the production is better than I thought it would be. The creators took the movie in different directions, apart from just mimicing the original. The GORE level was ampted up. The Vampire scenes were fast, furious and effective. Not to mention, the effects and makeup were top notch.

Ultimately, LOST BOYS 2 had a lot going for it. Yet, when it came down to it... storywise... the most interesting thing to happen was crammed within the credits. That's right... a scene inside the credits brought back Sam Emerson (Corey Haim) sporting fangs and a back story encounter with Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman). It was the only time in the entire movie that I had an ""Oh man"" moment and as soon as it started... it was over.

What, was Corey Haim too wacked out on drugs to play a bigger part in the film? If so... it's a shame because the mood, effects, and production value were put to waste with a less than interesting storyline.

Otherwise, the movie was pretty good. It just could have been better.",1217635200,9,1091,4.5
3455338,4,B001ANQY7Y,"When I put this movie into my dvd player I was expecting to be dissapointed. Honestly I wasn't. This movie kept me intrested form the opening scene to the end credits. The dialouge and acting were not bad for a direct to dvd movie and were better than some recent theatre releases, and the special effects were fairly well done. Most of the characters were basically clones of the original movie. The biggest standout was obviously Feldmann whom I feel stole the movie. Honestly I like the Edgar Frog part more in this movie than I did in the original. I think the final showdown was a bit rushed and dosent comare with the original's. Also the 2nd alternate ending should have been this movies ending as it ties up some loose ends and its honestly pretty cool. Overall this isn't a bad movie for what it is. Just don't go in expecting to much and bring a sense of humour.",1217635200,2,872,4.422360248447205

Both of us are big fans of the first...and from what it looks like reading the reviews, who isn't? About a month ago I saw that this was coming out...read a few things about it...and was really looking forward to it.
While it wasn't bad...it wasn't really that good either I'm sorry to say. We just got done watching it...I had read that it had the same kind of humor/comedy as the first...I missed it...the humor was pretty dry, there were a few parts that made me laugh but I was missing the feel of the first.
Now for the acting...one of the first thing that my husband and I noticed was Corey Feldman's voice, which was obviously for the movie...too overdone for my taste...again just didn't have the same feel as the first.
As for Angus Sutherland...I can only hope if he does another movie that he's better...granted he has a lot to live up to...no one can do a better head vampire than Kiefer!!! Kiefer was the sexy, bad guy...Angus was the one that THOUGHT he was sexy and bad...but was just bad, and not in a good way.
There was a LOT MORE gore and sex...we were pretty surprised by that...I can understand where the porn comments come from...
The special effects weren't all that great either... : (
Again this is simply my opinion...but I'm actually kindof sorry that I bought it and didn't just rent it...it might be nice to have the two but I will probably never watch this one again...

It seems that the directors think they have to always show off the lovely female anatomy to get any rankings on any movie. WHAT GIVES??? I personally didn't think this matched up at all. Granted Angus Sutherland is a great actor, but it is too bad the movie itself stunk. I think making part II to 99% of original movies is always a disappointment",1217548800,2,445,4.309523809523809
3455341,1,B001ANQY7Y,"I watched the original Lost Boys over & over & over.  I still watch it when it comes on, and when I heard a second would be out, I ordered it hoping that our advances in technology and both Coreys, Donald's son, both Frog brothers would really make this one even more interesting; the first one had a true storyline and fantastic characters! Diane Weist, Barnard Hughes (what a geat grandfather!), even the sax player Tim Capello was thrilling to watch.  But woe am I.  I found it interesting to see what a gorgeous son Donald has, it was good to see Corey Feldman finally grown up, and for the two minutes Corey Haim had at the tail of the movie it was OK, still arguing which I think was hype for the movie.  But no real story line, nothing really interesting, lots of squirting blood, some cute bike tricks but not like the chase to the edge of the cliff or hanging from the train tracks!  It just doesn't come up to snuff, and I was completely disappointed!  They could've made the oscar winner of the year if the writer had a clue how to write.  Don't waste your time or money.

3455342,4,B001ANQY7Y,"Personally, I think people are ripping on this movie a little too harshly..
On some points I will agree, however:
Is this film as good as the original? No, it's not...But then, few sequels ever are.
Does this film borrow heavily from the original screenplay? Yes it does. However, there IS a reason why...

The synopsis on the back of the case refers to the film as ""a modern reimagining of the original"", so naturally there will be similarities. That being said, I suppose it's not so much ""Lost Boys 2"" as it is ""Lost Boys Redux"".
Now, I may not be as high brow as some. When I look for a vampire film, I base my decision on three factors:
1. Special Effects
2. Babe Factor (Sex)
3. Action
I really don't need a deeply engrossing script to be entertained. It's a vampire flick, how deep does it have to be? But I digress...

I really wasn't expecting too much from The Tribe... and I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprized. For a straight to DVD release, it's not all that bad. Were there flaws? Sure.
But at least it wasn't ""From Dusk Til Dawn 2(or 3)""...

All in all. I enjoyed this movie... You might too.

Now.. To all the nay-sayers:
Sure, I would have loved to see a ""Lost Boys 2"" film about 15-20 years ago too.
But when ya really think about it...
How bad would it have probably sucked?",1217548800,5,1304,4.288617886178862
3455343,5,B001ANQY7Y,This wasn't bad for a sequel.  Though I would have like to have seen more/any of Corey Haim and the Frog bro.  I'm gald I bought it---the way Corey Feldman's character's voice is insane!,1217462400,4,186,4.4411764705882355
3455344,3,B001ANQY7Y,"After waiting 21 years I finally saw the sequel to my favorite movie of all time.  It's weird thinking there are people of drinking age who weren't even born when the original came out.  As we all know, this was a straight-to-DVD release; so, from the start, I didn't have much hope.  Though, to be fair, some of the best horror films in recent history, like Session 9, have been straight-to-DVD.  Once I heard Kiefer Southerland's half-brother was playing the lead vampire role I had a glimmer of hope (a sense of continuity).  Then once Feldman was cast I knew it would at least be watchable (for nostalgia if nothing else).

I cautiously awaited its release.

  I sat down expecting the worst; this is a vampire film after all, and most modern vampire films suck a**, not blood.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, it felt like a true sequel.  There's nothing I hate more than when a sequel has none of the feel of the original -- a sequel in name only.  In contrast, Lost Boys: The Tribe opens up EXACTLY like the original, at least style-wise.  The camera shots, music montage, etc., all reflect the original.  Good start.  I was dreading the standard quick-cut/choppy editing that plagues so many modern horror films.  Surprisingly, it wasn't there -- total 1987 style film making.  It was if the director actually made the effort to make it fit with the original (imagine that).  In fact, some scenes were eerily similar to the original, stylistically, that is.  The tone, pacing, even the jokes were in the spirit of the original.  The use of classic songs from the original like, ""Cry Little Sister"" made it really feel like one was watching ""a Lost Boys movie"".  The movie is FULL of subtle in-jokes only the super-fans will pick up on.

*spoiler alert*  Though I'll try to be very vague.

  Onto the vampires:  Angus Sutherland did a great job as the head vampire.  Granted he has only a fraction of his step-brother's charisma and intensity, but it still worked.  After all, he plays a surfer, not a punk-rock biker, like David.  Therefore, he has a more laid back and casual persona, common with most surfers.  Now, the surfer thing sounds totally lame -- I know -- but if I was a vampire in Northern California, hell, I'd probably surf too.  Why not?  What else are you going to do for kicks when you're forever young?  The shots of full moon surfing were actually kind of cool looking.  In fact, I wish there had been more, or perhaps surfing more dangerously (since they can't die).  The other vampires had personality and weren't cardboard cut-outs.  They even had lines! (unlike the one or zero lines given the vampires in the original).  While the in-the-background/brooding attitude of the original Lost Boys made them a bit scarier, it also made them rather one dimensional.  There is a vampire girl in this one who is totally unneeded (pretty much there just for eye-candy).  Though they did learn from the first movie's mistakes -- no vampire kids!  Thank god.  The ridiculous character of ""Laddie"" in the original has always bugged me.  The vampires were updated to the current ""underground"" look (whatever that is), which makes sense.  As much as I love the look of the original gang, the mid-80s headbanger hair would just look silly now.

  On to Feldman -- Edgar Frog:  Honestly, when he first shows up it seemed like he didn't really fit.  As much as I wanted Edgar Frog in this movie, I'm not sure it was such a good idea after all.  Yes, he's the link to the original, but he really looked out of place with the rest of the film.  Part of it was because he looked EXACTLY like he did 21 years ago (right down to the red bandanna).  I think they should have updated his look to reflect the times a bit -- maybe some facial hair.  But then again, if they had, I'd probably complain about ""Where's the bandana and camo?"".  So you can never make fans 100% happy.  After a while he started to mesh better with the film and had a few funny one-liners, much like the original.

  No Haim:  At first I was disappointed Corey Haim was cut from the cast.  Now, all I can say is, ""Thank god!"".  If he had been in the movie it would have just turned into ""The Two Coreys: The Movie"".  Haim does appear in the outtakes and alternate endings.  He looks terrible and can't act worth a damn.  He needs to stick to reality TV.  I'm glad some producer somewhere put his/her foot down and cut that walking train-wreck from the project.

The Extras: Not even worth mentioning unless you like low budget music videos.

Final analysis:  The acting was fine -- about on par with the original.  However, the film doesn't have nearly the same energy and atmosphere as the original, nor the darkness, but it makes a good effort.  I wouldn't want a carbon copy anyway.  Some scenes were wrapped up far too quickly making it somewhat anti-climactic.  There were also a few camera techniques I didn't care for, like the sped-up movement of the vampires.  There were other moments where I could definitely, and unfortunately, sense how the ever-influential Buffy the Vampire Slayer had left its mark, like the vampire make-up, for example.

  I could go on, but I don't want to give away too many specific details.  So over all I would say it was a pleasant surprise.  It's slightly above average, so I'd give it a solid C+.  Who knows, maybe if I watched Lost Boys II as a 12 year old (as I did the original) it would've had a far more powerful impact on me.  I'll probably buy it.

3455346,4,B001ANQY7Y,"When a championship surfer and his sister move to the village of Luna Bay, they meet up with a group of thrill-crazed vampires. Soon, dark secrets erupt and fear begins to take hold. Enter Edgar Frog, surfer & vampire hunter, who helps in the fight to take them down. Taken on it's own merits, as a vampire flick, Lost Boys: The Tribe succeeds admirably with plenty of hard-rockin tunes, action and gore(alot more than was on the original, anyways). The story, although quite familiar, is riveting and interesting. As a sequel to the original Lost Boys movie from the 80s, however, it sadly fails to generate the same look and feel that made that movie such a hit. I'm all for continuing the saga of the Frog Brothers. I did get the movie, after all. But, if you're going to call this a 'modern reimagining of The Lost Boys'(as it says on the DVD box), for chrissakes-make it a 'reimagining' after all. That, in itself, might be what makes Lost Boys: The Tribe fail to be embraced by ""Lost Boys"" fans.

Directed by P.J. Pesce, the movie stars: Angus Sutherland, Corey Feldman, Autumn Reeser, and Tad Hilgenbrinck. Horrormeister Tom Savini & fellow Lost Boys Alumni Corey Haim makes cameos(both storylines hinting at a third movie to follow). Special features include Alternate endings, 4 music videos, and the Edgar Frog's guide to coming back alive/Lost Boys: The Tribe Action-Junkies featurettes.

My personal take on the movie, though, I really enjoyed it myself. For a vampire movie, it kept me interested the whole time through. I especially liked the videos for Yeah Whatever's Downfall and Hell is Full. It's a good addition to my vampire movie collection. I highly recommend it. Just don't put too much emphasis on the fact that it is a Lost Boys movie and you'll like it just fine.",1217462400,4,1790,4.752411575562701
3455347,3,B001ANQY7Y,"The original Lost Boys is an amazing movie, it's just so well done, and when I hear a sequel is being made 21 years after the original, I can not help but be a little nonplussed about it. Sounds like someone is trying to cash in on a name to me. But for some reason, I still pre-ordered it, for $10 mind you. Then the early reviews starting rolling in, and they basically called it a disaster. My expectations went from low to nonexistent in a heartbeat. So it comes in the mail and I watch it, here's the formula: Take the original Lost Boys, keep this one pretty much the same, but add more gore and sex. Next, take out the really cool soundtrack and replace it with a really bad one. Then replace the cool vampires with really lame Buffy vampires who play too many video games and emulate Jackass. Sprinkle in some bad acting and a borderline annoying female lead, and you have Lost Boys: The Tribe. All that being said, it really wasn't that bad, calling it an average movie is being a little generous but I will leave it as such. It's insulting to have this movie bear the Lost Boys name, because it does not have nearly the same heart or atmosphere. But as a vampire movie, you're looking at a mediocre horror version of Laguna Beach, or the OC or some other equally horrible show. I can not solidly recommend it, but I can say that it does have some nice gore and Corey Feldman does a nice job as Edgar Frog. Remember how he was in the original? Cheesy and fun? Same thing here, good job Corey. And revealing anything else would be a spoiler. This is definitely not worth the full retail price, even at $10 I feel a little ripped off, but for half that, I would feel as if I got my money's worth.",1217462400,4,1703,4.243076923076923

I was so excited about a sequel to the Lost Boys...one of my fave horror movies of all time....I was greatly dissapointed!!!

If the movie was called ""Bloodthirsty Surfer Extreme Sports Dudes Gone Wild""....that would sum up this 2 hour lesson in self-torture.

In a nutshell, there are no salvageable aspects of the movie.  Acting was flat, plot...oh wait...there wasn't one...and even the makeup was not engaging or believable.  The actors just feel like fillers...nothing special
about them...their backstories are pointless and do nothing to move the story along.

This movie could have been soo much better!  I mean..they got Tom Welling for the friggin Fog remake...they could have spruced it up for a theatrical release...but instead, Warner Brothers threw it together without any real entertainment value other than the fact that this film shares the same name as the first movie.

3455350,3,B001ANQY7Y,"So I must admit, that as everyone knows that a sequeal rarely lives up to the original - so in saying that, take this movie as is.  Its a vampire movie that tried to capture the essense and vibe of the original, but also tried to bleed new life (excuse the pun) and new ideas from today into a tale that was perfect in the 80's.

Frankly, this movie is not going to win any major awards.  But should you still watch it?  Sure.  Its a great, entertaining movie as far as that is concerned, but it does not provide the realistic and cinematic ground work that the original was able to produce.

It felt to me like a great, made for tv movie - which it pretty much is.  But it still should be watched, and will probably be appreciated by fans of the original and cherished as an amusing movie by others who are not fans of the original.

So in closing, this movie is not the original - very true.  We know that going into it - its a new story, rehashing old ideas and blending new and modern ideas into a classic tale that audiences have loved since they first viewed the original Lost Boys movie back in 80's.  Corey Feldman's performance as an older, yet not as yet fully matured Edgar Frog was likeable, yet comical and almost cartoonish.  But that was his character in the original - so take this movie for what it is and what it offers - a decent escape for 90 mins.",1217376000,3,1368,4.183206106870229
3455351,1,B001ANQY7Y,"I cannot believe I waited 20 years for this.

I loved the original ""Lost Boys"". I saw it in the theater several times and have had several incarnations of the home video versions (VHS, DVD, 2 DVD set, and now the wonderful Blu-Ray). I was very excited to hear that a sequel was being done, and even though they were not my favorites in the original, I was pleased to hear that Haim, Feldman, and Newlander were going to return for the sequel.

I found the original ""Lost Boys"" to be a great genre film for several reasons...the wonderful direction of Joel Schumacher, the acting by the entire cast (they even snagged an Oscar winning actress with Dianne Weist!), the classy look of the film, and the fact that it managed to be a horror movie in the 80's that went against what so many horror films of the era were known for...there was no nudity, no sex (only a harmless implied scene), very little bad language, and the shocks didn't rely on gratuitous gore.

Twenty years later...""Lost Boys: The Tribe"" gives us as much sex & nudity as ""Showgirls"", over the top gore, about a dozen uses of the F-word before the opening credits even roll, lesbian make-out sessions, horrible direction, terrible acting, ridiculous script....I could go on, but why bother?  This was an insult to the original and I am sorry that I ever watched this mess.

This was clearly done to make quick $$$...I wish they'd never done it...",1217376000,10,1412,4.587301587301587
3455352,2,B001ANQY7Y,"I CANNOT believe I was excited for this. I figured it would be so bad that it would be good, it's not, it's just BAD. Not only is Haim, not in it (except for the last minute or two at the end credits) but they also say Jamison is in it, but he's nowhere to be found. But what took the frosting flowers on top of the 'cake'was titling it the lost boys..hardly anything resembles the first one...except feldman and the chubby old guy playing the trumpet in the beginning.

I started being disappointed within the first minute, and it just got stupider from there...constant swearing, pointless sex scenes and pointless gore (apparently vampires now like to stab each other until intestines fall out)...the new writer wasn't even able to capture the essence of sarcastic humor; also, if I was Edgar Frog I'd wonder how I kept ending up in vampire infested towns.

Acting was, it was sub-par; feldman's raspier-than-normal voice was very annoying, but he was the ONLY one that carried the show. I thought it was cool that they had Keifer's half-brother in it, kind of a nice choice.

All in all, this movie is barely worth the $3.50 rental fee(the reasoning for the 2 stars..? 1 for feldman, 3/4 for haim and the remaining 1/4 just for having jamison's name).

If I was the original writer, I'd slap the new writer upside the head for butchering my idea.",1217376000,3,1350,4.589211618257261
3455353,3,B001ANQY7Y,"Well most of us here were probably huge Lost Boys fans, I know I was when I was in college. And I have to admit, I wanted this movie to be as good as the original. But it just is not as good as the original. However, with that said, it was not that bad. There were some funny scenes and the music was not bad. There was more gore and nudity than the original, but considering it was 20 years ago, that's to be expected.

They tried to match some of the things of the original movie, some of it worked and some did not. There was no classic line like in the original, ""I knew it Michael, your a vampire. You wait till mom finds out."" LOL, still cracks me up. I know the line they were trying to make as the classic line and it was funny (I won't give it away for those who have not seen the movie yet), but it did not have the same commedy level as the original.

All in all, it was not the original movie. But it was an ok movie, hence the 3 stars. It was not terrible, there were vampires, hot chicks, semi-cool music (even a hot vampire chick!)- so it can't be that bad, right?",1217376000,3,1079,3.944954128440367
3455354,5,B001ANQY7Y,"Never compare sequels to the original because they are going to have  a completlely different feel to them. However PJ Reece and the cast were able to keep a little bit of that original feel alive. I didn't know how I was going to like the movie yet I watched it with an open mind and I have to say that this movie is fun,funny at times, entertaining, and sexy. The most entertaining horror films in years.",1217376000,2,406,4.2727272727272725

EVERYTHING FROM THE LAME PLOT TO THE TERRIBLE ACTING!! IF I WAS COREY FELDMAN I WOULD NOT WANT MY NAME ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE AND YOU THINK HE WOULD OF SAW THAT IN THE SCRIPT!!

3455356,4,B001ANQY7Y,"First thing I wanna say is stick around during the credits as there's a brief scene; now with that out of the way onto the review.

There's a lot of hype surrounding Lost Boys: The Tribe and fans of the original have been waiting 21-years for a follow up. There were plot ideas thrown around, but the movie never came to be until now. The original Lost Boys I personally don't know if I'd call it a classic movie, but is a cult classic and the movie is so fun and entertaining that it elevates the movie to almost greatness. The Lost Boys is a cult classic for a reason and now with Lost Boys: The Tribe expectations might be a little high.

Simply put Lost Boys: The Tribe isn't as good as the original, which I think most people would assume going into the movie, but with that said Lost Boys 2 is actually a surprisingly fun ride. I didn't really expect much, but hoped for at least a fairly decent flick, but it actually turned out a lot better than I thought it would; like the original Lost Boys: The Tribe is campy and a bit silly, but it does step up on the gore and nudity.

The screenplay by Hans Rodionoff wasn't bad, but it's never as fun and creative as the original movie and the characters are entertaining, but lack the depth like the characters from the original. But overall the screenplay was a lot better written than I thought it would be. There's some funny and creative moments and very much plays out like a homage to the original. Overall the script isn't without flaws, but works on an entertaining level like the original. The biggest problem is it relies too much on the original screenplay. If not for mentions of the first film this could actually pass as a remake.

Director P.J. Pesce does a solid job with the movie and gets the best out of all the scenes for the most part, around the hour mark the pacing does start to drag in some spots and while it never gets bad I thought it might just start to fall a part, but it quickly gets back on track. Even when the pacing lags its still an entertaining movie just doesn't fully work. There are some good vampire action and fun action movies. While his directing credits may not be anything to write home about he does show some talent and makes an entertaining film.

Angus Sutherland as Shane is the head vampire and his character isn't nearly as cool or as mysterious as David played by his brother Kiefer. That's actually the biggest flaw with the movie. Shane feels like a poor mans David and while a fun character he just doesn't really shine as much as he could have due to the writing making him too much like David. Angus Sutherland gives a fairly good performance, but he's still early in his career and has potential and seeing as his brother is Kiefer Sutherland and his father is Donald Sutherland I'm quite sure he'll be fine as his career goes on.

The rest of the characters are a bit mixed; the vampires are alright, but aren't nearly as fun as those in the original and like Shane, the vampires are too much a clone of the original vampires and they don't work as well. They were fun, but could have been stronger. Tad Hilgenbrink as Chris Emerson gives a fun performance and his character was pretty good as well. Autumn Reeser as Nicole Emerson was a fun character and steals the show early on.

About the only complaints I have with their characters is the same as I did with Shane's; Chris is pretty much a take on Sam and Nicole is a take on Michael. But both characters at least get a little more than just playing a new version of Sam and Michael, but a bit more could have been done, but regardless both characters work well overall.

Corey Feldman reprises his role as Edgar Frog and bottom line is Corey Feldman is what elevates the movie. His character is the same as the original only older. Any scene with Edgar was highly entertaining and like the original Feldman plays it straight, which makes it so funny since both movies are a bit silly. But that's the whole point on both his performances. I've always liked Feldman and it's great to see him back. Even though Lost Boys: The Tribe is direct to video it's still a high profile movie and its great seeing Feldman in a solid role rather than some of the movies he's done the last decade. Lost Boys: The Tribe may not lead to bigger things, but it's a step up and Corey knocks it out of the park.

Lost Boys: The Tribe is rather gory at times and it's a mixture of practical and CGI. But both really look excellent for a DTV movie and I have no complaints on the F/X and it's always good to see the red stuff shooting out.

Overall Lost Boys: The Tribe is a surprisingly fun and very entertaining, while some parts of the movie does drag in spots it always remains mostly fun. It's not as good as the original, but that should be expected. Like the original it works on a campy level even if not as good. Fans of the original should enjoy this on some level as long as you don't expect too much you won't be let down. And if anything the movie is very much worth watching due to Feldman who really delivers a great performance.

The DVD features 2 alternate endings both feature Corey Haim and Jamison Newlander. Newlander is listed in the credits, but his scenes aren't in the movie itself. Also Tom Savini makes a cameo in the opening scene.",1217289600,31,5307,4.350505050505051
3455357,1,B001ANQY7Y,"this movie is nothing like the first. just from the first five minutes you will realize how bad this movie is. I am a huge fan of the first, its a great movie just all around. this is poorly a lost boys film.",1217289600,2,208,3.86046511627907
3455358,2,B001ANQY7Y,"Lost Boys 2 doesn't bring anything new to the table. You have 2 teens that move in with their some-what looney aunt, instead of a nutty Grandfather. The teen sister who we'll just call a Hilary Duff look alike falls in with a bad crowd who just happen to be vampires. Her protective older brother who we'll just call a James Marsden look alike tries to save her before she makes her first kill and is a vampire forever. He gets help from Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) who knows a thing or 2 about killing vampires, hell he's now a complete vampire slayer.

  The formula is the same but there's so little talent in the movie that Corey Feldman is the only actor worth actually watching the movie for. I know, now that's sad lol. Look for Corey Haim in the two alternate endings. He tries to look cool but he's still a dork lol. Still , they should have kept his scene in the movie because sadly, it's better than anything in the movie.

  The gore in the movie is over-done and stupid. While the lead vampire looks like he just got done doing a photo shoot. He's not scary and is certainly no Kiefer Sutherland....even though he's his younger brother in real life. I should also mention that the sex scene is also done to same music as the sex scene from the original movie. It's a lot less sexy, especially since you have shots of the head vampire making faces of pleasure. Which is another reason why I didn't take him that seriously lol.

  The best thing about the movie is it's sense of humor when it actually has one. It's not a big laugh, but I did get a kick out of a fat guy with a pony tale shirtless with the same instrument and look as the buff concert star in the beginning of the original film. Maybe, years later it's even the same guy and he let himself go lol. You also have a scene where the Aunt wants to sit down and watch Goonies.  She says something like ""I can't believe you haven't seen Goonies, it's a must see"". It is a childhood favorite of mine but still I wonder if Corey Feldman wrote that line...lol. I also got a small chuckle out of the very end even if it's not as funny and smart as the ending of the original. Still though, it's sad that Lost Boys 2 is nothing but a made for dvd sequel. With more effort, a better cast, director and a theater release a sequel was always promising.",1217289600,,2315,4.240909090909091
3455359,4,B001ANQY7Y,"This movie is gonna catch alot of flack regardless. It's unfortunate, but true. Because really this movie is not bad at all.  The story was originally supposed to follow Alan's personal struggle with becoming the thing he most hated, and Edgar's pain in losing his partner/brother. That was scrapped and thus all Alan's scenes were cut last minute.

Luckily, there is a 4 piece comic out called 'The Reign of Frogs' which covers what plot elements occured between the two films. I have read this and it does fill in some questionable gaps.

'Tribe' is not a progression in the story and character arch such as T2 was to the original Terminator. What you do get is a film that pays alot of homage to the original. It looks and feels way better than the majority of straight to video films. The acting is suprisingly good, bringing in Kiefer Sutherland's real life brother, Angus was a nice touch!

As a huge fan of the original film this didn't dissapoint me at all.",1217289600,2,965,4.593023255813954
3455360,4,B001ANQY7Y,"I must admit, it was actually good.  There have been a lot of nay sayers, but the movie was an exciting and scary ride. Cory Feldman was awesome, I hope that his performance in this movie helps to revive his film career. He was as iconic and memorable as he was in the original, kicking serious vampire butt and taking no prisoners.

The Lost Boys 2 isn't just all nostalgia, though. Newcomers Tad Hilgenbrink and Autumn Reeser round out the stellar cast, breathing new life into this ageless coming-of-age story.

Bottom line, the movie is 94 minutes of awesome. The special effects were somewhat cheesy, but that made it fun, it also has a great soundtrack. Overall, the movie has everything you remember and love about the first one but with a new twist, not leaving any viewer disapointed. Autumn Reeser is sexy, Cory is awesome, and there is enough gore and exploding heads to make everyone happy.

All I'm going to say is that I hope it gets the response it deserves to pave the way for one more.",1217289600,,1002,4.55
