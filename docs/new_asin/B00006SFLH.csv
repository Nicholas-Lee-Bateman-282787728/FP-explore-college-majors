7973115,5,B00006SFLH,"Okay, if you are like me and freaked out over this insane price than do what I did :) I went to ebay and got this whole season and season 4 only paying 77$ total.

Pokemon is part of my childhood but this price is ridiculous, go to Ebay. That's the only time Ebay is better than amazon. Other than that Amazon rules ;)",1308355200,8,318,3.96875
7973116,5,B00006SFLH,"BUY THIS!
It includes a Gym Battle, Ash finally catching the bug menace Beedrill, Team Rocket showing their talents for radio shows, how to defeat a Miltank's Rollout - this is useful as in the game Rollout often takes down all of your Pokemon - and much more!
Buy this with the DVDs Flying Ace and Buggy Boogie for a real Gym Leader battle bonanza!",1045353600,4,349,4.384615384615385
7973117,5,B00006SFLH,"Ok, I know Pokemon is this big craze, even thought it has calmed down, but what are they doing? I mean, first off, they are jumping the DVD's around like crazy with their releases, and now, they are making it better! I mean, I never wanted to spend 25 plus odd dollars on one DVD that only had three episodes, but now they are putting 7 on an episode? The orange league season has 12/13 episodes per DVD. Will they be doing this for all the old episodes (going back to #1, putting more then THREE EPSIODES PER DVD!!!...) If anyone knows this respond back...but don't go out buying the old DVD's...save yourself some sanity! (But buy these ones of cource, cuz Orange Islands is basically the best season...although they took away my Brock :( )",1038960000,11,742,4.463235294117647
7973118,4,B00006SFLH,"Pioneer has finally gone back to releasing Pokemon episodes in order, this time exclusively on DVD, where they belong. This latest volume contains the first seven episodes of Season 4. They are:
401 - A Goldenrod Opportunity: Ash attemps to win his third Johto League badge, but Gym Leader Whitney's Miltank is unbeatable!
402 - A Dairy Tale Ending: Ash and company visits Whitney and her uncle at their dairy farm, where Ash discovers a way to topple Miltank!
403 - Air Time!: After winning the Plain Badge, Ash is interviewed on DJ Mary's radio show. But after Team Rocket accidentally destroys the afternoon radio drama reel, everyone has to pitch in and perform the drama live! And with Jessie's constant story sabatoging, who knows what will happen!
404 - The Bug Stops Here: The crew meets up with Casey and her Chikorita again, as they all compete in a Bug Catching contest!
405 - Type Casting: Ash encounters scientists and fishermen all with one goal... to capture a Sudowoodo!
406 - Fossil Fools: Ash meets up with Professor Oak and another researcher who has uncovered a huge secret!
407 - Carrying On: The kids find a family operated carrier Pidgey mail service, and Team Rocket plans on capturing them all!
The first three episodes are the best of the DVD, especially the third one, when the medival radio drama the kids and Team Rocket perform gets wildly out of hand and somehow transformed into a futuristic space thriller, thanks to Jessie's improv. The latter four are only mildly amusing as filler episodes.
The sound quality is great, as expected from a Pioneer title. The video quality has a few grainy spots here and there, but the colors and overall picture are good. The menus are very plain and static, with a couple of stills from the featured episodes. The text for each individual episode's chapter (each has 4 parts) is very small and hard to read. Extras include subtitles for the hearing impared and a trailer for Pokemon 4Ever.
The episodes themselves are basically unchanged from the network airings. The opening is still played before the title card of every episode, though the abrupt third commercial break at the end of the first three episodes have been removed. The break still remains in the other four. The end credits are also tagged onto the end of each episode.
Overall, I'm glad Pioneer has gotten back to releasing Pokemon episodes in order. This is a very good buy for Pokemon fans.",1033948800,30,2429,4.771971496437055
