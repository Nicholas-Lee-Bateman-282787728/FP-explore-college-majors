5000618,5,B006KH6CHW,"Being a huge Linda Hamilton fan, I had to order this movie as soon as it became available. It did not disappoint. She does a great job as the downtrodden wife who finally has all she can take and fights back. Horrified at what she has done, she drives around looking for somewhere she can truly find Refuge and meets up with an interesting young man, to say the least. Their interaction is what gives this movie its heart and made it very enjoyable for me.",1328659200,9,456,4.313953488372093
5000619,5,B006KH6CHW,"Linda Hamilton, as usual, gives an excellent performance, this time as Amelia, a hospice nurse who also happens to be in a loveless marriage to Jack (Christopher McDonald), an abusive husband and drug addict.  Without giving away the plot, even though she finds herself in a nightmarish and impossible personal situation, she still truly cares for those she meets, encouraging them to change and become better persons.  Amelia's developing relationship with Daryl (Christ Payne Gilbert), a high school teacher and failed novelist running away from his fianc and life, makes you care about both of them and worry about the decisions they soon have to make.  An unusual but interesting story line, quirky and humorous but dramatic as well, giving us real life lessons.  I wanted the movie to be longer, wanted more of the story -- it ended too quickly for me, thus the reason you will want to watch it again.  I read that the movie was made in over 100 degree weather with no letup.  Amazing resilience of all involved.  It may be a low budget, made-for-tv type movie, but it is well worth owning.  If you like Linda Hamilton, you will enjoy her outstanding performance in Refuge.",1328486400,7,1178,4.825870646766169
5000620,5,B006KH6CHW,"I watched this the other night. Although there was a lot of humor in the movie, I found the relationship between the two main characters really moving.  You care what happens to these people.  Really well acted all around.  Watch it!",1328227200,2,233,4.634146341463414

5000626,4,B006KH6CHW,This movie was alright but I think that I will only watch it rarely as it was slow moving related to action.,1401840000,,108,3.9545454545454546
5000627,4,B006KH6CHW,"Most of us just think of Linda Hamilton as the ingenue in that silly TV show, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. But, like the late Farrah Fawsett before her, Hamilton has grown into her roles and is capable of far more intensity and range than one might have thought. She is a powerhouse in this film, which is an unusual indy with real staying power. If you like suspenseful dramas that have real characters and are actually about something, I recommend it.",1394409600,,446,4.518518518518518
5000628,5,B006KH6CHW,"This movie accomplished what many don't even attempt, a blend of drama and humor.  Real life is full of drama spiced with humor, so to experience  this in a movie is always a wonderful surprise.  I've always found stories  that blend the two to be the most realistic and poignant.

The acting was superb.  Christopher McDonald put a little bad boy in his butt-head this time, and as always he does a great job.  Linda Hamilton was excellent.  She has the ability to express the depth of her character's lifetime with one expression.  Her character development is astonishing.  Chris Payne Gilbert was excellent.  The other characters are a blend of quirky, driven, humorous and corrupt people that you meet every day which is refreshing amidst the sea of stereotypes Hollywood films throw at us.  Great movie all around, very refreshing.",1361059200,2,837,4.9
5000629,5,B006KH6CHW,"Linda Hamilton and you won't be disappointed. I am admittedly a biased Linda Hamilton admirer;] She has had few directors who really did well by her.  This is one of her most balanced, natural performances. The story is full. Her co-star is a very good actor.  Their chemistry is rich. Who doesn't love a ""road film"". The beginning was engaging, leading to a solid middle story, and a satisfying conclusion.  Another ""little"" film that goes under the radar of big budget features.  Watch this for a well-written, well-acted, emotionally moving film. Oh, yes and for the always lovely, always talented, always watchable Linda Hamilton.",1342915200,3,634,5.0673076923076925

8500144,4,B006KH6CHW,"An honest film.  I'm just imagining, but I am imagining that whoever made this film had a story to tell.  If that's the case, then they did.  And its a pretty good story.",1505433600,,170,4.090909090909091
