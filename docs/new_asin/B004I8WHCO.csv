4384302,5,B004I8WHCO,It brought back so many memories of my childhood. The moment I put it on for Elijah he was transfixed. He loves music and I could play this all day without getting tired of it,1360886400,,175,4.0285714285714285

4384304,2,B004I8WHCO,"Chances are that if you're looking to purchase Fantasia, you already know what it's about.  It's a great movie, and I have loved it since I was young.  I wanted to share the film with my boyfriend, so I purchased it on blu-ray.  We watched it on his PS3, and we have never before had problems watching any type of movie on this player.  Immediately, the film warned us that we would be subject to long pauses in which the video would load.

Unfortunately, this held true, and there was at least 1 pause in every track.  The pause would last quite a while (I would estimate up to 2 minutes at a time), and the track would skip ahead to bring us in to ""real time"" - so there were several parts of the track that we would miss.  When we went back, we could not recapture those moments, as it would immediately being the pause to load again.  The same parts were skipped each time.  In fact, we could barely watch the second-to-last track because we were missing vital sections of music.  We could not watch the last track at all, as the whole thing was paused to load.  It was quite disconcerting to find these difficulties in a movie we had just opened.

In terms of content, it was the same movie that I grew up with.  The content that actually played was wonderful.

I would highly recommend Fantasia; however, I cannot in good faith recommend this blu-ray version.  At some point, we will attempt to play it with a different player and I will return to edit the review if I am able.  In the meantime,  I would explore other options to enjoy this classic film.  While the movie deserves 5 stars, the platform deserves 1.",1360540800,2,1620,4.343333333333334
4384305,4,B004I8WHCO,"Fuelled with the noble ambition of bringing classical music to a wider audience, especially children, Fantasia succeeds and fails in equal amounts. Some of it works, some it bores. It could have made a perfect 85 minute movie if the crap was cut out.

The first segment is enough to put you off completely. We have to suffer blips and bloops twinkling across the screen as acid-trip visuals match the music that is being played (Toccata and Fugue in D Minor). Kind of like turning on the spirograph-like visuals on Windows Media Player. This is a bad way to introduce the film and it's techniques. I can only imagine the audience of the time watching it and thinking 'What the hell is this?' The good segments in the movie are the story of the Dinosaurs to the music of The Rite of Spring, the over publicized Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Nutcracker Suite and A Night on Bald Mountain. All effect a wonderful atmosphere that is so lacking in modern animation.

Segments featuring dancing Alligators romancing fat hippos (The Pastoral Symphony) or the 'meet the soundtrack' interstitial are yawnfests with pretty much nothing happening at all, I'm sorry to say. The animation is always top-notch however and very vivid as Disney cartoons of this vintage usually are. But ultimately, Fantasia is a mixed bag that not a lot of people will like or appreciate. Still worth checking out though.

As for Fantasia 2000, top quality animation and a sense of humor could have made this sequel/add-on a formidable animated movie in its own right. The running time of 74 minutes kills this potential though, especially when you consider that 6 of those are end credits and another 10 are recycled from The Sorcerers Apprentice, meaning there's not even an hour's worth of new footage. A bit of a rip-off.

But my favorite segments is the one with Donald Duck (Pomp and Circumstance) and the one with the volcano (Firebird Suite). The music matches the story perfectly and it has some truly beautiful animation. Far superior to the ugly CGI crap we get these days. The TV show-style introductions were more watchable than the dubbed Deems Taylor segments in the original, but the sequel loses many points for not being ambitious enough.

This was the first animated movie to be made for IMAX screens and the digital picture is amazing. See this preferably on an IMAX screen, which I guess will be limited to attractions as Disney Theme Parks.

Both movies look lovely on Blu-ray in their respective 1.33:1 and 1.78:1 aspect ratios with DTS HD-MA 7.1 sound. There are quite a lot of extras, but this BD has not been spared Disney's habit of cramming in a thousand upfront promos, meaning you'll spend about 5 minutes trying to get to the top menu.",1360108800,2,2731,4.7876857749469215

4384308,5,B004I8WHCO,Fantasia and Pinocchio are the pinnacle of animation excellence; I cannot add to the encomia. The first blu-ray discs I purchased for my new HD TV were LOTR and Fantasia. I want to have a word about this being the UK version. UK DVDs will not play on std American & Canadian sets because they use the PAL standard. US & Canada use NTSC.

4384381,5,B004I8WHCO,"Probably Disney's most ambitious Animated film gets a nice treatment, but still has the altered centaur sequence. OK,OK already, I hate censorship as much as anybody, but I probably saw the sequence once in my lifetime, in a theater, as a kid. While I wish Disney would release both versions of the film (and the others that have been altered)include full screen and widescreen versions if they were presented in a theater that way, it's probably not going to happen, so since I intend on enjoying the films, I'll buy them regardless of these fairly minor issues. Life is short folks!

What bothers me most about the edits are where do we draw the line? I'm of Italian/German decent, so maybe I'm offended by Stromboli from Pinocchio? or the way German's are continuously portrayed as Nazis??! If we look hard enough we can find offense in anything. I understand the need to keep the little ones away from some images to a point, but I think we're doing them a great disservice by sugar coating everything and try to sweep history under a rug. The solution would be to release both versions of the film. This goes for all Disney animated films that have been altered and let the purchaser watch the version they want to. Haven't we given Disney enough money buying these films over and over again? Its high time they started to listen to the majority and give customers what they want. The most accurate, informative and restored editions of these classic films so we can enjoy them for years to come. I suppose that would go against Disneys practice of having everyone buy a new edition every 5 years or so. This isn't really the case as there are millions of new children that parents want to introduce to Disney films, so they will still sell a ton regardless of actually releasing a definitive edition.

Ok enough ranting.

Fantasia Disney's 3rd effort gets a first class treatment here looking and sounding remarkable! The film has been restored to 125 minutes and is an important landmark in film and Disney's career. Personally I think Children will be bored to tears with this film, but that is for you to decide. I own the 4 discs 2 film Blu Ray/DVD edition but still had to keep my previous 3 disc DVD set because Disney has another irritating practice of leaving out bonus material from previous releases. These negatives aside, this is the version to own, but hold on to the DVD box set if you appreciate features as there is enough missing to keep it in your collection, especially for such an important film in the history of Disney and animation in general.

The new bonus material is very good especially the cross bio of Salvador Dali and Walt Disney, it's a little over an hour long and I found it extremely interesting. There are other new features that are short but very good and if the old bonus material had been included on this new set of discs (not BD live!) this set would get a 4.9 with the edit being the sole blemish.

Again, Im reviewing the Fantasia/Fantastia 2000 double feather edition. The two films look spectacular on Blu ray and really jump off the screen. The sound is also much improved. It's a shame that Fantasia 2000 isn't the groundbreaking film it should have been. It's actually very good, but having multiple persons introduce the selections wasn't a great idea, it makes the film feel disjointed and more like a documentary. The Sorcerer's Apprentice shouldn't have been part of this new continuation either. When Walt Disney envisioned this being an on going ever changing thing, he didn't have home video in mind. No one wants to watch these films back to back and see the same segments twice? What I find odd is the original Fantasia is 60 years older, but the animation seems much better and groundbreaking even in these times. I think they should have pushed the envelop a little further for Fantasia 2000, it should have been longer and the Salvador Dali piece should have been inserted replacing of The Sorcerer's Apprentice repeat.

Overall this is still a wonderful Blu Ray set and a must have for fans of Disney animated films.",1423699200,4,4085,4.666666666666667

4384398,5,B004I8WHCO,"Haven't seen the new Blu-Ray FANTASIA, but have been reading reviews to see if I want to purchase it.
However, many of these reviews are more concerned about the ""edited"" version of the film, than they are about the quality of the Blu-Ray release.
As someone who is well familiar with the cut scenes, I can attest that they probably deserve cutting, though I would want them included in a ""deleted scenes"" extra. I saw the film in its re-issues in 1956, and later in 1964, when it was ""wide-screen,"" several times, enough to remember what was cut. Contrary to what one person says above, the black centaurette, ""Sunflower,"" does make another appearance, when she is dusting off the throne for Bacchus, shortly before his drunken arrival. She disappears from the picture shortly after that, when he collides with the throne, sending her out of camera frame.
If you can believe this, at the time, this character's presence in the ""Pastoral Symphony"" sequence was meant to be comic relief, even when a white centaurette gives Sunflower a dirty look. Such was the temper of the times. Even by the time I saw the film in later re-releases, this character was out of place in the story, adding only a note of discomfiture. So it's just as well she was excised.
However, the way the Disney people did it was just butchery. I also saw the 1970 re-issue, when the film was advertised with so-called ""psychedelic"" artwork, to appeal to the hippie crowd, at which point everything with Sunflower was simply cut from the film resulting in jumps in the music, not to mention the continuity. During the later DVD release, I noticed that some of the sequences were re-edited, to concentrate on other characters in the same scene, or even to show the red carpet Sunflower originally unrolled, to be mysteriously unrolling by itself, as if by magic. In this case, it was quite apparent that Sunflower had been ""disappeared"" from the scene. Which is also jarring, in another way.
Disney cartoons, particularly in the 30's, are rife with racial, ethnic, and even gay, stereotypes, which were typical humor for the time. Disney's product was not alone in this, as films from the other major studios also contained such humor. (See the Warner Brothers cartoon, ""Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs."")
However, the Disney people continue to, you'll pardon the expression, whitewash their product for consumption in later decades. Hence, numerous examples of outright elimination from many of their films. (See in another review how BAMBI has been censored), not to mention other things, like eliminating the whole sequence of ""The Hatfields and the Coys,"" from MAKE MINE MUSIC. Or erasing the habitual cigarette, dangling from the mouth of ""Pecos Bill."" The list goes on and on....
As for SONG OF THE SOUTH, as someone who saw it in both its 1956 and 1973, I think, re-issues, the black characters are the only sensible people in the whole picture. Apart from the white children, all the other white characters are depicted more or less as foolish and self-centered. The animation, on the other hand, is glorious, as are the songs. It's certainly worth a video release, even though the Disney management is terrified of it.
So, I guess I'll probably get this Blu-Ray, all things considered.
But I do wish these reviews would concern themselves more with the specific product they're supposed to review.",1419033600,3,3376,4.883275261324042

You have to sit there holding the remote, waiting for the previews to begin so you can skip them and go to the menu. I'm pretty sure that Disney forces it to check in to the slowest servers on Earth every time you try to load the disc. Fantasia is beautiful, but Disney uses the load time of these disks to remind you of how much disdain they have for their customers before they let you watch it.
  So 5 stars for Fantasia, -3 for the abuse of the format. It's time to move this over to streaming. Disney's disk privileges are hereby revoked.",1414454400,3,782,4.312925170068027

FILM FACT: Walt Disney on the widescreen release of FANTASIA in 1956: ""I wanted a special show just like Cinerama plays today ... I had FANTASIA set for a wide screen. I had dimensional sound ... To get that wide screen I had the projector running sideways ... I had the double frame. But I didn't get to building my cameras or my projectors because the money problem came in ... The compromise was that it finally went out standard with dimensional sound. I think if I'd had the money and I could have gone ahead I'd have a really sensational show at that time."" FANTASIA is timeless. It may run 10, 20 or 30 years. It may run after I'm gone. Fantasia is an idea in itself. I can never build another FANTASIA. I can improve. I can elaborate. That's all.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Filmed with a 60 years gap 'FANTASIA' and 'FANTASIA 2000' has completely different looks, but each one appears magnificent in these 1080p restorations. Walt Disney's loving care for its classics is evident here. These faithful presentations leave us with an image that is, by far, the best they've ever looked. Though today it is recognized worldwide as a brand, the Disney name once belonged to a visionary. Walt Disney was a man who pushed the limits of what art could do. Anyone who thinks otherwise should look no further than 1940's FANTASIA. A project near and dear to his heart, FANTASIA combined two of Walt Disney's passions: art and music. While his expertise lied in visual mediums and he was no musician, Walt Disney still possessed a keen sense of what an aural experience could provide.

A marriage of classical notes and images, FANTASIA took feature animation to places it had never before been. As you know, Fantasia is not a traditional animated film. Titled ""The Concert Feature"" at one point, this experience has no central protagonist or antagonist, no overarching plot, and not even any dialogue save for linking segments. Instead, it takes various pieces of classical music and marries them to animation to create a unique form of entertainment. The compositions included in the program are as follows: Johann Sebastian Bach's ""Toccata and Fugue in D Minor"" using abstract imagery, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ""The Nutcracker Suite"" with the theme of seasonal changes, Paul Dukas' ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" starring Mickey Mouse as an apprentice whose magic spins out of control, Igor Stravinsky's ""The Rite of Spring"" set to the evolution of the world, Ludwig van Beethoven's ""The Pastoral Symphony"" using Mount Olympus characters of Greek myths, Amilcare Ponchielli's ""Dance of the Hours"" as performed by different animals to demonstrate the times of day, Modest Mussorgsky's ""Night on Bald Mountain"" with the theme of evil and supernatural creatures, and finally Franz Schubert's ""Ave Maria"" in which a forest is transformed into a natural chapel. Each of these pieces is conducted by the legendary Leopold Stokowski and hosted by noted music critic and historian Deems Taylor.

The conjunction of classical music and animation is brilliant. Every nuance in the orchestration can be fully visualised in a manner that would be too confining in live-action. Animation allows for a fantastical and surreal approach where the sky is the limit. It helps that the film never limits itself to one single style. Here we get everything from realism (""The Rite of Spring"") and impressionism (""Toccata and Fugue"") to horror (""Night on Bald Mountain"") and farce (""Dance of the Hours""). There's really something for everyone to connect with. Not every segment works as well as others. ""The Rite of Spring"" is an endurance test, to say the least and other sequences like ""Toccata and Fugue"" and ""The Nutcracker"" have their share of lulls. Personally, I appreciate this film much more as an adult than I did as a child, but there are moments where the program drags and almost becomes self-indulgent. One thing is certain, however: even when it's not exactly stimulating, Fantasia is still a work of art.

The two standout sequences for me perhaps speak volumes about my own tastes as they're the most whimsical pieces in the film: ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" and ""Dance of the Hours."" Some film snobs may say that these are the two most popular sequences because they're the most childish and the least artsy. That's rubbish. ""Dance of the Hours"" may enthral smaller children more than, say, ""Ave Maria,"" but adults can clearly see that this is about more than dancing hippos. It's a spoof of pretentious ballets that purport to be more than what they truly are. ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" may not seem as biting, but it's a triumph in staging and design. There's a reason Sorcerer Mickey has become a corporate symbol; his exploits are the most creative and inspiring the character has ever experienced and are likely to remain so.

As is often the case for art works considered ahead of their time, Walt Disney's dream project unfortunately failed to win over audiences. World War II didn't help, cutting off international markets at this time. While it was undoubtedly a major blow for him, Walt's concept of fusing music and image didn't fade away. It was brought back in the simpler, more modern approaches of Make Mine Music and Melody Time. Fantasia continuations were considered throughout the years as the project was always intended to be an ever-changing attraction. Those intentions finally came to fruition at the turn of the century (millennium) with FANTASIA 2000.

Headed by Walt Disney's nephew Roy E. Disney, FANTASIA 2000 sought to provide a new experience that emphasized varying musical and animation styles more directly. It more or less follows the same pattern started by the original, but this time with different celebrity hosts introducing each segment rather than one unifying commentator. Among these are comedian Steve Martin, conductor Itzhak Perlman, composer Quincy Jones, Bette Midler, James Earl Jones, magicians Penn and Teller, conductor James Levine, and Angela Lansbury.

There are eight segments in total, though one of them is ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" is recycled from the original. The new segments include Ludwig van Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 5"" using abstract butterflies, Ottorino Respighi's ""Pines of Rome"" with flying whales in the Arctic, George Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" about intertwining New York city residents in the style of Al Hirschfeld, Hans Christian Andersen's story ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" set to Dmitri Shostakovich's ""Piano Concerto No. 2, Allegro, Opus 102"", Camille Saint-Sans' ""Carnival of the Animals, Finale"" using an oddball flamingo and his yo-yo, Edward Elgar's ""Pomp and Circumstance, Marches No. 1, 2, 3 and 4"" starring Donald Duck as an assistant on Noah's Ark, and Igor Stravinsky's ""Firebird Suite - 1919 Version"" set against the death and rebirth of a forest.

Many critics of FANTASIA 2000 find it's not weighty enough to sit alongside the original FANTASIA. Condemning this instalment as a poor man's concert feature is very unfair, as I think FANTASIA 2000 is a brilliant companion. The two films have different goals. The 1940 one is more experimental in nature. It staunchly sticks to the idea of making the music and images one inseparable experience. FANTASIA 2000, on the other hand, is a little looser is its conjunction of aural and visual delights. It is also more concerned with entertaining its audience. One major thing in the newer film's favour is how vastly different its musical choices are. While the visual presentations of the original are distinct from one another, the classical compositions chosen don't seem terribly unique from one another to those who aren't versed in the musical arts. FANTASIA 2000' choices are easier to distinguish and that gives each piece more of an identity.

Technology, of course, changed in the sixty-year gap between the movies and the animation reflects that. We see computer animation in ""Symphony No. 5"", hand-drawn animation in ""Pomp and Circumstance"", and everything in between with pieces like ""Piano Concerto No. 2."" Even the techniques within these differ. ""Rhapsody in Blue"" is traditionally animated but digitally painted whereas ""Carnival of the Animals"" is done with watercolours. The entire film gives a nice sampling of different styles and mediums to achieve the intended effect.

The two standout sequences from the newer film, ""Piano Concerto No. 2"" and ""Rhapsody in Blue"" both tell involving stories without betraying the purpose of the project. The Walt Disney Organisation always prided itself in the way they tell their tales and their interpretation of ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" feels distinctly them, a classic tale told in a timeless manner. ""Rhapsody in Blue"" predates films like Crash and Babel in how we see several independent storylines weaving in and out of each other. We feel for the characters of the piece and relate to how melancholic and humdrum their lives are, making the resolution of each arc all the more satisfying.

Excepting some restoration work done on the print to clean it up, ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" remains identical in every way to its original incarnation. The filmmakers did not re-score the segment with a newly-recorded version of Paul Dukas' ""L'apprenti Sorcier"". We still hear the original, featuring the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. For the other seven episodes, James Levine conducts the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

No matter what you prefer, however, there's something for everyone in these two complementary animation films. One sets out to accomplish a lengthy, serious experiment while the other aims to please in a brisk, light-hearted manner. It's almost worth watching them back to back to get one well-rounded experience. Their mesmerising artwork and spirited orchestrations inspire and motivate the senses in a way only Walt Disney can achieve.

Blu-ray Video Quality  With black vertical pillar boxing either side of the image, the Blu-ray preserves of FANTASIA is kept in its original Academy Aspect Ratio of about 1.33:1. Disney has yet to drop the ball when it comes to their animated canon on Blu-ray, and this film is yet another amazing restoration effort. Narrow aspect ratio aside, Fantasia just by its very nature demands to be a demonstration disc. There's a wildly varied palette of colours on display, and they all pop off the screen on a regular basis. The image is immaculate in its cleanliness and sharpness, allowing the viewer to see background textures and even cell shadows. The live action bits also impress; somehow they're scrubbed as clean as the animation without a waxy loss of detail. Other than some very minor colour banding in some of the orchestration spotlights, this restoration is perfect. Being transferred directly from the digital source, there's no excuse for FANTASIA 2000 to look anything less than flawless. Thankfully, it meets those expectations in the 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio. That ratio is a happy medium, presenting more visual information than either of its theatrical exhibitions but not quite the full open matte image. Both the live-action and animated segments are razor-sharp and burst with vivid colours. Some of the hues used in this film are even brighter than the original's, but there's never any noise or other digital defects. Once again, the hand-crafted work can be appreciated in full as we see everything from painterly brushstrokes to finely tuned outlines. This is a top-notch transfer.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  FANTASIA has been given a new 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track that's shocking in its clarity. Music is obviously the driving force of this feature, and it comes as a relief to hear so many different layers and elements to the orchestrations. Walt Disney originally released the film in what was called stereophonic sound, a precursor to modern day surround sound. That original mix is no longer in existence, but this new one does an excellent job of carrying on that idea, filling the entire field with wall-to-wall sound. The orchestrations are separated as they would be in a live orchestra, and the richness and clarity of the audio almost makes it sound as it's been re-recorded, which was curiously done back in 1982 by Irwin Kostal. This is not only the best the film has ever sounded, but it's the best track for any Golden Era film on the format. The FATASIA 2000' 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is likewise stunning, though it's also less surprising given its age. Because the live-action bits often move the speaker around the screen via stylish windows, the audio follows them around to create a directional experience. The music is the important aspect, however, and that's been replicated beautifully. Every instrument comes in crystal clear and has a definite live feeling. It's not overblown or painfully loud, but natural and inviting. It's reference quality to be sure. Similar thoughts can be attributed to the included inferior DVD versions of both features. The pictures, of course, do not reveal some of the finer details that the HD 1080p counterparts do, but they're strong for the format. Gone are the speckles and hairs found on Fantasia's previous DVD, as are the compression artefacts from Fantasia 2000's original release. Audio for the latter is pretty similar, though the audio for the original is a leap in quality from the 60th Anniversary disc. It's comforting to know that even though they tout Blu-ray front and centre, Disney hasn't neglected their DVD transfers in the way other studios have.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: The Special Features for this set are spread across the two discs. Some may notice that the making of features didn't find their way onto these discs. While that's annoying, they are available on the BD-Live feature included on the 'FANTASIA 2000' disc. You can watch both making of documentaries if you go there, but people with slow or no internet connections for their Blu-ray players will find this to be more of a nuisance. There's also no telling how long those features will actually be available. At least if they were on the disc you'd know they're staying around and that you own them. Sadly, going online is the only way you can revisit these features with this set.

Special Feature: FANTASIA DisneyView Presentation [1080p] Viewers can watch FANTASIA in its original aspect ratio 1.33:1 presentation or with optional DisneyView, a feature that fills the black bars on either side of the image with custom paintings by visual-effects artists and designer Harrison Ellenshaw.

Special Feature: FANTASIA: Disney Family Museum [1080p] [4:00] Walt Disney's daughter, Diane Disney Miller, offers us a brief glimpse of the Disney Family Museum that's located in San Francisco. They talk about how the museum was set up and what you can find there if you plan on going.

FANTASIA Audio Commentaries: There are three amazing and informative audio commentaries for 'FANTASIA.'

FANTASIA Audio Commentary: With this first particular audio commentary, we have Walt Disney historian Brian Sibley gives an informative, but seemingly scripted, commentary. Sibley goes in-depth on how Walt Disney came up with the idea of 'FANTASIA' and how he was going to create an animation film where people would be able to see sound. This is a commentary for all of those that want to know the ideas and thought that Walt put into 'FANTASIA.' For people interested in Disney history, Sibley's smooth commentary is a must listen.

FANTASIA Audio Commentary: With this second audio commentary is an amalgamation of sorts. Roy Disney offers an introduction. Animation historian John Canemaker hosts it. We also hear from Walt Disney himself as he gives notes and ideas about the different segments. Listening to Walt talk, he's so matter-of-fact about the animation, and makes it sounds so easy to create a movie as complex as this. As with the Brian Sibley commentary, fans of Walt Disney history will definitely want to listen to this. The recordings of Walt Disney that you hear played are wonderfully clear and intelligible.

FANTASIA Audio Commentary: With this third audio commentary is from the original DVD commentary and is a crowded affair with Roy E. Disney being joined by conductor James Levine, John Canemaker, and film restoration manager Scott MacQueen. Roy Disney gives introductions for all of the participants of the commentary and gives their connections to Walt Disney and why they were needed for the commentary. John Canemaker is a wonderful addition because he's able to delve into the animation and the techniques that were used. Levine does a spot on job about describing and talking about the music that was used in the animation film. Perhaps the most interesting bit of the commentary comes from Scott MacQueen who talks about the restoration process. Interesting titbits: where they had to re-dub much of the introduction scenes with Deems Taylor because the original recordings of his dialogue weren't kept. They had the original script so they had to hire a voice actor to go over the lines again. There is a wealth of information buried in this commentary. Yes, you'll have to listen to this one too.

FANTASIA: Interactive Art Gallery [1080p] Take your time here and scroll through all the stills from the animation film as the music plays. This interactive art gallery allows you to explore animation and art work from 'FANTASIA' and 'FANTASIA' 2000.'

FANTASIA: The Schultheis Notebook: A Disney Treasure [1080p] [14:00] This special feature is one of the most interesting on this Disney Fantasia disc, I wish it were longer. It talks about a notebook found by the people at Disney that belonged to Herman Schuletheis, one of the animators that worked on the film. Herman Schuletheis' book describes, in detail the great lengths they had to go to and the rigs they had to invent to get the shots that they wanted. Think ' FANTASIA ' was just drawn on paper? Think again. This is a wonderful look at the intricate, inner-workings of what made ' FANTASIA' actually work as an animated feature.

FANTASIA 2000: Dal&iacute; and Disney: A Date with 'Destino' [2010] [1080p] [82:00] This is an insightful documentary about the collaboration of Walt Disney and Salvador Dal&iacute; on the film 'Destino.' Roy Disney talks about how odd it was that these two guys wanted to get together to make something. ""Walt with his fairies Dal&iacute; with his nightmares."" This is a thorough look for anyone who has wanted to see the special film 'Destino.' Contributors to this special feature are Dawn Ades, Montse Aguer, Michael Barrier, Baker Bloodworth, David Bossert, John Canemaker, John Culhane, Salvador Dal&iacute; (archive footage), Roy Edward Disney (archive footage), Walt Disney (archive footage), Neal Gabler, John Hench (archive footage), Bob Hope (archive footage), Leonard Maltin, Paula Sigman, Dave Smith, Lella Smith and Julie Taymor. Directed by Ted Nicolaou. Produced by Barbara Toennies. Screenplay by Ted Nicolaou.

FANTASIA 2000: 'Destino' [2003] [1080p] [6:00] To a song of love lost and rediscovered, a woman sees and undergoes surreal transformations. Her lover's face melts off, she dons a dress from the shadow of a bell and becomes a dandelion, and ants crawl out of a hand and become Frenchmen riding bicycles. Not to mention the turtles with faces on their backs that collides to form a ballerina, or the bizarre baseball game. From the melting clocks and hourglass sand, to the figure rendered in strips, to the character covered in eyeballs, the style and themes of Salvador Dal&iacute; are clearly recognisable throughout. See the entire collaboration of Walt Disney and Salvador Dali in their short film 'Destino.' You just need to watch it to experience it and be totally amazed. Cast: Jennifer Esposito (Rebecca Drummond) (voice) and Dora Luz (Singing voice). Directed by Dominique Monfery. Produced by Baker Bloodworth, Baker Bloodworth and Roy Edward Disney. Screenplay by John Hench and Salvador Dal&iacute;. Music by Joel McNeely.

Musicana [1080p] [9:00] Here we have a look at the long development of a potential FANTASIA sequel that never came to fruition in Musicana. The idea that Walt Disney wanted FANTASIA to be an ongoing feature that kept changing with different segments, but after a lacklustre box office that dream couldn't become a  reality. 'Musicana' was the idea to make a continuation of FANTASIA which was Walt Disney's vision.

FANTASIA 2000: Disney's Virtual Vault [480i] [304 minutes] This is where you can go to access the making of features from the previously released inferior DVD editions of FANTASIA and FANTASIA 2000. Just be ready to wait for video buffering and all that annoying stuff that comes along with internet special features. All of it can be found and viewed via this handy BD-Live portal, primed for fans and aimed at completest. In it, you'll find five hours of documentaries, featurettes and other making-of materials that are well worth pursuing.

Finally, FANTASIA and FANTASIA 2000 may not seem like everyone's cup of tea at first, but both provide enough variety to ensure that you walk away having latched onto something. Each feature offers a different side to the same coin and are somehow stronger together than apart, each one making up for the other's shortcomings. Those with an affinity for animation and/or classical music will certainly find a wealth of art here. Despite the current popular notion of the Walt Disney brand name, the studio is capable of providing sophisticated and ground-breaking entertainment. One needs look no further than these two features to realise that. The Blu-ray discs present the films with outstanding picture and sound. The new supplements are well-made, but the value lies in the Virtual Vault contents. Had those features been easily accessible, this would be a near perfect release. Although the overall quality of Fantasia 2000 is considerably more variable than that of Fantasia, certain aspects of the experience are the same - namely, the ability to sit in a theatre and listen to great music while being presented with a choreographed visual accompaniment. In between the segments, we are forced to endure distracting introductions, given by Steve Martin, Penn & Teller, James Earl Jones, and others, that are intended to be light, amusing, and occasionally informative. The best thing about most of them, however, is that they are short. Now only time will tell whether a FANTASIA series will be developed in the pattern of Walt Disney's initial vision, or whether these two films will stand as lone representatives of a unique motion picture sub-genre. While the Original FANTASIA has fantastic animation quality, FANTASIA 2000 has just that little bit better flow with more energetic sequences, a much more bearable running time and of course the very funny celebrity narrations. Also, I just like the individual segments of FANTASIA 2000 better. Both movies have contrasting styles, but FANTASIA 2000 is just clearly slightly superior in every way and as double-feature releases go, this one excels and fans of FANTASIA amination film genre and especially its sequel FANTASIA 2000 will certainly get their money's worth. Very Highly Recommended!

4384412,4,B004I8WHCO,"Exceptional color in Blu-ray. Sound is good also. Disney has not done a release of Fantasia/Fantasia 2000 in Blu ray in the U.S. yet; this release came from the UK, so unfortunately you can't use your Disney movie rewards in the U.S. However, the movies more than make up for this minor glitch.",1405814400,,294,4.566037735849057
4384413,4,B004I8WHCO,"This is a great collection of Blue Ray to have. It is clear visually and have great sound. The thing is the package originates in the UK. For many of us who like to take advantage of the Disney Movie Rewards or use the coupons and offers in the box, your out of luck if you live in the USA.

I bought the product for the movie, so still very happy with the purchase, and overall a great movie collection.",1402617600,,404,4.05
4384414,5,B004I8WHCO,"Aloha. Im so glad I purchased this as its Outstanding and can watch it anytime I want. Though I studied middle easter music, I love all music and espically enjoy cvlassical music. So this is a find and I recommend you to buy it if you can. Its a masterpiece. so say the very least.

4384415,1,B004I8WHCO,"Unfortunately the Fantasia Blu Ray won't play on anything we own, Blue Ray Player (3) or computers (3).  Even worse, I was a few days past the return date when I discovered this.  Sad...buyer beware!",1400716800,,199,4.6571428571428575
4384416,4,B004I8WHCO,"A quick warning: if you register your Disney movies to get the reward points and free streaming, the US and UK systems are different so this registration number won't work on the US system.
Luckily the movie plays fine on my US region HTPC with anydvd, albeit with the several minutes of worthless menus, warnings, and ads before you can actually get to the movie that are typical of Disney releases.",1399939200,,400,4.647887323943662
4384417,5,B004I8WHCO,My 3 year old liked it! She loved the music and different characters. It looks great in blue ray. Good gift,1398816000,,107,4.142857142857143
4384418,5,B004I8WHCO,The bluray is in great condition on the copy I received and I am excited to be able to watch this many more years to come.,1397520000,,122,3.730769230769231
4384419,5,B004I8WHCO,The package I got had both Fantasia and Fantasia 2000. The first Fantasia was done before digital effects were around. I think it is amazing how good it looks.,1396483200,,159,4.517241379310345
4384420,4,B004I8WHCO,"This is the UK version of these movies, hence the reason that it's available. The US version is much more expensive. I can only play this version on the PS4 - my Blu-Ray player won't play this region code. Be sure that your player or console will play the UK region code before purchasing - I got off lucky on this one, but it was my own fault for not reading the description more closely. The first movie alone is worth the price of this combination pack. Fantasia 2000 is forgettable, but you can't beat the original classic.",1396396800,2,527,4.387755102040816
4384421,5,B004I8WHCO,Was fantastic.  Couldn't beat the price two disney movies for the price of one.  My family enjoyed the movies for movie nights,1396396800,,126,4.681818181818182
4384422,4,B004I8WHCO,"Here is the thing. I personally did not mind the editing. I know that this is a hot topic here, but the edited version has been out for so long, and it is such a minuscule thing when compared to the brilliance of both films that it's like, really not an issue at all. There is about 5 seconds or less of a repeat scene during the horses short film, but that is fine.

Both films are great but I wish that the original had been expanded to widescreen, and I know that is not possible or whatever but the difference between the first and the sequel on a big screen, because of the widescreen option, is immense. Still great though.",1395878400,3,629,4.198347107438017
4384423,4,B004I8WHCO,Fun movie for all ages. Many funny scenes with great music. If you love Disney then this is a must for your collection.,1395619200,,119,4.217391304347826
4384424,1,B004I8WHCO,I am so glad I took the time to read about the destruction of fantasia before I decided to buy.  I like the ORIGINAL when I purchase...  I do not want what some one has decided.  I can and will wait for some one to come to their collective sences!!!  J.K.B.,1394755200,,257,3.980392156862745
4384425,5,B004I8WHCO,Sound and picture are top-notch with this Blu-Ray release.  Fanatasia 2000 has just as many great sequences as the original Fantasia.  My daughters can watch both over and over without tiring of the animations and music.,1394236800,,220,5.083333333333333
4384426,5,B004I8WHCO,These films are the best of Disney animation. Perfect execution. Works of moving art. Fantasia was groundbreaking animation and sound. Fantasia 2000 continues the tradition.,1394064000,,173,5.96
4384427,1,B004I8WHCO,"I did not feel informed that this was for a different zone. I cannot even watch this with it being zoned for Europe. I feel cheated and upset with this purchase. Is there any way to be refunded, or the situation corrected?",1390348800,,222,4.309523809523809
4384428,1,B004I8WHCO,Really upset that this disk won't play in my sons DVD player. Something is wrong with the region. Why would I want a disk that will only play in my computer. When I bought this it never said anything about regions issues.,1390262400,,221,4.285714285714286
4384429,5,B004I8WHCO,I had these movies when I was young and I bought these for my son because he loves music and they entertains him so much.,1389139200,,121,3.88

4384431,5,B004I8WHCO,Mr Disney cartoon are so great. I saw this when I was about 5 years old. It bought back a lot of memories.,1388361600,,106,3.652173913043478
4384432,1,B004I8WHCO,I do not recall seeing any indication that this version was for the UK only. I am stuck with this DVD and out the money I paid. Terrible!!!,1388275200,,139,4.0
4384433,5,B004I8WHCO,This came as combo pack with the original fantasia and the new fantasia 2000. It was very inexpensive compared to buying the pack at best buy! I loved these movies when I was growing up so I was very excited to get them for my son!,1388188800,,231,4.043478260869565
4384434,5,B004I8WHCO,"The family has always like this movie and we hatched it on VHS for years.  Since we almost wore out the tape, having it on DVD is better.",1388102400,,137,3.892857142857143
4384435,5,B004I8WHCO,"Disney knows how to get the best Blu-Ray quality even for their older pictures. I am trying to add as many classic Disney animation movies to my collection as possible, but of course their titles are usually in limited distribution, why they do this is beyond me. When the movie goes out of print, prices get extremely high when buying from third party. Why does Disney restrict the sales?

Fantasia is the wonderful classic animation movie and the sequel done in 2000 is quite different but also beautiful. I don't think they should have repeated the Mickey Mouse Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence, it would have been better to have another new animation, but that was their choice. The first movie is small screen format, but the second is full widescreen. Picture and sound quality is magnificent on both films. I crank up the 5.1 sound, sit back and am dazzled.",1387324800,3,862,4.785234899328859
4384436,1,B004I8WHCO,I was very excited to get this movie but when i put it in to watch it did not work! Very upset :((,1387324800,,98,3.3043478260869565
4384437,5,B004I8WHCO,"A little confused about why they censored Sunflower out but not the other, adult black centaurs who were obviously from the jungle.... But otherwise it is jut as I remember it from my childhood, except clearer and more vibrant. These movies are timeless classics and an essential addition to any Disney lover's collection.",1386374400,,322,5.09433962264151
4384438,5,B004I8WHCO,So glad to have this in my collection. Brings back many childhood memories. A very good way to introduce children to classical music.,1383696000,,133,4.826086956521739
4384439,5,B004I8WHCO,"Usually not a fan of the Disneyfication of stories, and suspicious of the first Fantasia, the viewing of Fantasia 2000 has redeemed the Disney folks.  In particular the Hirschfeld-like drawings coupled with Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue marry visual and aural with such style that the whole package is worth the price.  Any family needs to own this set, and you need to watch it with your kids of all ages.  Even one at a time it is a visual delight.",1382745600,,448,4.575
