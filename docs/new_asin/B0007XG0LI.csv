8323976,5,B0007XG0LI,This is my favorite workout for flexibility and re adjusting my hips. I would definitely recommend it for post natal women and for overall hip and lower back workouts. It is not a cardio workout in any way so I Would also suggest this as a great healthy lifestyles starter for those of us looking to get back in shape. It will help loosen up and strengthen all the necessary joints and muscles used for most regular exercises.,1460160000,,426,4.4743589743589745
