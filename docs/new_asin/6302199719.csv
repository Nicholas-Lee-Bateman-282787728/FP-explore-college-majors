434738,5,6302199719,"Lillie Langtry was, in some ways, the first modern superstar celebrity, as famous for her off-stage life as her on-stage achievements, and this sumptuous - and that may be too mild a word - Masterpiece Theatre offering depicts that tumultous life in loving detail.  Francesca Annis is first-rate as Lillie - a role she originally essayed several years before in ""Edward the King"", another Masterpiece Theatre miniseries - and supported by an equally excellent cast. The costuming and sets are truly gorgeous.  My only complaint is that there's no subtitling on the DVD's.",1104278400,7,571,5.129032258064516

434740,5,6302199719,"Born Emilie Le Breton in 1853 on the Channel Island of Jersey, Lillie Langtry went on to become one of the most famous women of the late 19th century, and this 1978 series (consisting of thirteen 50-minute episodes) does an admirable job of chronicling her fascinating life.
Lillie was gifted with exceptional beauty, and although she and her new husband Edward Langtry (played by Anton Rogers (May to December, Fresh Fields)) were people of very modest means when they moved to London, it didn't take long for Lillie to become noticed. Indeed, Lillie craved London society and did all she could to secure herself a place therein. Becoming a Professional Beauty (the 19th century equivalent of a Supermodel) certainly helped for soon her portraits and photographs were everywhere. (Her friendships, by the way, included the artists Millais and Whistler and the playwright Oscar Wilde (played to absolute perfection by Peter Egan)). It was, however, her relationship as one of the mistresses of Bertie, the Prince of Wales, that really sealed Lillie's position in society. Society, however, failed to hold Lillie's interest for long, and she soon embarked upon a career as an actress, a decision that was to bring Lillie international attention and acclaim--to such an extent that a town in Texas was even named after her!
In this series, Lillie is portrayed by the stunningly beautiful Francesca Annis who, at least in my opinion, is simply splendid as Lillie; indeed, so perfect is her portrayal that I cannot possibly imagine anyone else in the role. Having seen pictures of the real Lillie Langtry, both my mother and I have often remarked on how Lillie's beauty pales by comparison with Francesca's--evidence, no doubt, that beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder, and that which one society considers to be perfection is often very different from that which is considered to be so by another!
In conclusion, this is an engaging and entertaining story of a woman who led a very interesting and atypical life. It is perfectly cast and extremely well-acted, and I highly recommend it to anyone with a love for either period drama or historical biography. For those interested in delving even deeper into this fascinating woman's life, I highly recommend Laura Beatty's highly acclaimed biography entitled Lillie Langtry--Manners, Masks and Morals (a 1999 UK publication).",1072656000,54,2377,5.097435897435897

Lillie is the story of Lillie Langtry, notorious actress and Mistress to the king.
Okay, I admit it, this era of history has never particularly interested me before, but if you can get past the first forty-five minutes, you'll really be hooked.  The life and times of Lillie, is, quite simply a fascinating time period. Seeing Lillie change over time from an upstanding and morally upright daughter of a preacher to become the mistress of several wealthy and influential men was an interesting study on the consequences  of too much power and wealth.
Lillie's friendship with Oscar Wilde was well portrayed, and I was saddened at the end when Lillie passed away alone and forgotten.  Overall, a gripping, thrilling, series sure to delight!",1054771200,16,767,5.063492063492063

434745,4,6302199719,"This thirteen part Masterpiece Theatre series, which first aired in 1979, is certainly worth watching as it is quite entertaining and well done. Detailing the life and loves of the notorious Lillie Langtry, the Victorian era superstar, it gives the viewer a taste of an era gone by. Well acted by a stellar cast, the production suffers only from the unfortunate lighting used in the nineteen seventies, giving the sets and actors a somewhat washed out and flat appearance. That being said, it is still a series well worth watching.
Born on the British isle of Jersey to a womanizing clergyman and his wife, Lillie grew up as a tomboy with a rare beauty. At an early age, she married Edward Langtry, a purportedly wealthy yachtsman from a shipping family, who takes her to live in Southampton. There, she finds life not to her liking. She soon discovers that her husband has sold her a bill of goods, as his wealth has been spent. After a bout with a serious illness, she contrives a move to London, where she is exposed to a taste of high society. After a false start, she gets noticed by the local swells and becomes a reknowned beauty, sought after by all. Now, a fashionable society woman, she finds herself with her name on everyone's lips. Lillie eventually comes to the attention of the married Prince of Wales and becomes his mistress.
Trapped in her loveless marriage with the hapless and alcoholic Edward Langtry, Lillie goes on to have numerous love affairs with some of the most socially prominent and wealthy men of her day and eventually has a love child. Courted by all, her beauty and need for money brings her to stage, where she becomes an actress with her own company. Her fame by now has spanned the ocean and made her a celebrity in America, as well as in Europe.
Lillie certainly knew the value of marketing, as she endorsed numerous products with her name. A woman ahead of her time, who marched to the beat of her own drum, she still went to great pains to avoid scandal, though it was never far from her doorstep. Alas, in the end, her fame and beauty decimated by age, her lovers dead or gone, Lillie, no longer the toast of two continents, ends up nothing more than a lonely old lady.
The cast for this production is stellar and the costumes are first rate. Francesca Annis is beautiful and certainly gives a  good performance as the notorious Lillie. Though her performance is acclaimed, however, one cannot help wondering why such a fuss was ever made over Lillie, as she comes across as supremely shallow and vapid. Perhaps, it is because  Ms. Annis' portrayal of Lillie is somewhat one dimensional and rather flat. Peter Egan, on the other hand, is ssuperb as Oscar Wilde and, as far as I am concerned, steals the show. Filled with much social intrigue and witty repartee, the series will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.
Those who like period pieces and historical dramas will most certainly enjoy this one.",1011657600,23,2944,4.637931034482759

434790,5,6302199719,"I was very lucky to find this DVD set in my local library, and promptly checked all four discs out! The story follows the fortunes and travails of Lillie Langtry. Most well-known for having been the mistress of the Prince of Wales, Lillie as portrayed by Francesca Annis appears to be a strong, courageous woman who is not afraid to follow her own path in order to find some measure of happiness & success in her life. Definitely not conventional, she challenges the traditional role society imposes upon the women of her time, and breaks free of those conventions to make a lasting mark. As the blurb on the DVD goes ""Lillie Langtry played by a new set of rules. Her own."" Francesca Annis brings tremendous depth to her role as Lillie, lending an air of vulnerability tempered with a strong will. Her other performance that I was impressed by was in another period drama ""Madame Bovary"".",1176854400,6,888,4.662420382165605
