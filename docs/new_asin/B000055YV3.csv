1394403,5,B000055YV3,"A man and a woman meet - perhaps through an ad, perhaps on the internet - and set aside some time weekly to indulge in a *fantasy*.  They keep it completely impersonal by not disclosing names nor personal details, concentrating merely on the ""affaire pornographique"".
Unfortunately for them, fate has another way of determining what direction this rendezvous is heading. From their first cafe meeting, there is a spark between the two, a connection that they both felt but were equally adept at concealing until it was too late.
Without disclosing too much of the plot, suffice to say that true love wins and loses at the end.  Yes, they indulge their mutual fantasy and even foray into the world of one-on-one fantasy-esque sex, but is this enough for a relationship to be formed? Will they both want the same thing at the same thing and take a step forward in admitting this to each other?

1394404,5,B000055YV3,"I really, really liked this film. It is modern, stylish, and quintissentially French. The actors have a depth and range, and convey their emotions flawlessly.
The premise is simple: a woman puts an ad in a magazine advertising a sexual fantasy she has that she wants to act out. Her intent is to have a purely sexual affair, no names, no details of every day life, no mess. A man answers her ad, shows up to meet her at a cafe, and they decide to go forward to this mysterious place they will create together, alone.
They begin to meet weekly at a hotel, and sometimes first at the cafe. They stumble over emotions which crop up here and there, and have trouble deciding whether or not to stay in each other's company for a drink after their liasions, whether to let Him drive Her home. They have the drink. She opts for the Metro. They do this dance of uncomfortable union around each otber.
I give this movie Five stars for really incredible acting, as well as nice use of color and style (ie: deep, dark reds (for the hallway in the hotel), subdued blues (for the room, which we don't get to see at first, but which becomes open more and more to us as the couple's relationship progresses), nice shots of the cafe, the streets in the rain, etc). I found both stars highly magnetic and attractive, and very, very expressive. The man carried his heart in his eyes, and they reflected the joy he felt with her, the intense sorrow, the restless erotic anticipation. In turn, the woman's mannerisms and movements seemed to reflect the stages of their relationship.
This film is a must-see for fans of modern World Cinema. It played at the Seattle International film festival, where Nathalie Baye won an award for Best Actress.",981849600,46,1724,4.546623794212219
1394405,4,B000055YV3,"Originally released in North America as ""A Pornographic Affair"",this tri-national production (Belgian director,Spanish actor, French actress)is a highly intelligent and thoroughly adult exploration into the complex and often disappointing world of romantic relationships. Operating very much in the same dynamic as ""Last Tango In Paris"" in which Marlon Brando's character insisted on not revealing his identitiy as a way of creating a new one,""An Affair Of Love"" finds two Parisians without names connecting through an ad in a magazine and pursuing a thoroughly physical interaction. Most interesting is that the entire relationship is actually a flashback as the two characters relate their experiences to an off-screen interviewer creating a wonderfully semi-documentary feel to the film. While the relationship of the two begins as purely sexual (in fact the very first line of the film begins with the woman discussing sex) it soon develops into a larger exploration on the nature of love and relationships thereby underscoring the irony of the original title of the film. French screen legend Nathalie Baye, at 52, conveys an irrestable allure both sexually and sensually and while the characters of the film do not escape sadness, the ideas and sensibilities of ""An Affair of Love"" credit both its creators and their audience.

She, single and unattached, places an ad seeking a partner to play out a sexual fantasy.  He sees the ad and responds.  They meet once a week at a caf and move on to a hotel. They share no personal information, not even each other's names.  It's the perfect relationship until they fall in love.  Uh oh.  Now what?  Suddenly, they must decide whether to take the affair into their everyday lives.  Duh!

1394417,4,B000055YV3,"The Bottom Line:

The quasi-documentary style (the characters are interviewed by an unseen narrator after their relationship is over) in An Affair of Love makes for an interesting film about a couple, as we're privy to what each of them thought during crucial moments and understand what went on beneath the surface of their affair; at under 80 minutes An Affair of Love is short but it is by no means slight.

This wonderful movie maps the development of a relationship from an original plan for uninhibited and uncomplicated sexual encounters. Clearly both come to enjoy their interactions and their encounters, yet something still holds both back from the full spectrum of an intimate relationship - is it the shadow of the original intent; a fear of commitment; or the possibility of rejection.

This movie has a great message for everyone - talk and open your heart to another person. This is an excellent movie, superbly acted and well worth purchasing.",1213228800,2,615,5.14
1394421,4,B000055YV3,"Sex without love morphs into sex with love and then peters out into neither sex nor love.  ""An Affair of Love"" reverses the usual chronology of attraction and affection leading to consummation.  The protagonists immediately round home plate and then later experiment with touching first base, second and third.  The pattern of anonymous sex in a regular private space sealed off from the world evoked to me a sense of ""Last Tango in Paris,"" without the rough play.

Nathalie Bay and Sergei Lopez are excellent - erotically charged despite the evident age difference -- and although the plot could make you feel claustrophobic if you heard the synopsis, it never feels this way.  Most all the action occurs in a street side caf and in a hotel room.  A steamy take on ""Afternoon Delight""!

Can carnal passion offer a solid foundation for a lasting relationship?  How can that connection be fueled if (when) the fires of passion cool?  Will peeking behind the cloak of anonymity let the air out of the romantic balloon?  Interesting questions hinted at by this adroit film!

1394422,5,B000055YV3,"This DVD rental was such a surprise delight.  Frederic Fonteyne has directed ""Gillie's Wife,"" but I've never focused on him as a director.  The premise is fairly simple: a man and woman answer each other's personal ad.  They meet strictly for sex.  While I have only seen the U.S. DVD, it certainly is not ""pornographic,"" as the French title might suggest.  There is nearly no nudity in the film.  The cinematic tension comes as Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez, who both won Best Actor awards at the Venice Film Festival for their work, steam the screen with their emotional tension and desire.  Free from the encumbrances of the outside world, the couple focuses solely on each other: their needs, desires and pleasure.  In this aspect, the film seems uniquely French.  Both actors are celebrated in Europe.  Baye won four Cesar Awards in France including ""Le Petit Lieutenant"" in 2006.  Lopez won the Cesar for ""Harry un ami qui vous veut du bien,"" or as it was titled in one English release ""Harry, He's Here to Help.""  There is a beauiful cameo by Sylvie Van den Elsen as Madame Lignaux.  The couple meet her as her husband runs into them at the hotel and dies of an apparent heart attack.  In his dying scene, he tells them that he can't stand his wife and has left her.  Van den Elsen seems self-controlled as they converse in a cafe.  Later, they read of her suicide.  The film speaks volumes to me about the relationship between men and women.  ""You can't live with them, can't live without them.""  Ultimately, the success or failure of relationships is facilitated or doomed by the quality and honesty of their communication on physical, intellectual and value levels.  Had this been a Hollywood picture, corporate would have insisted the couple get together in the final frame.  This is a picture that is well done with two stunning performances by Lopez and Baye.

1394424,5,B000055YV3,"Frederic Fonteyne's Une Liaison Pornographique (US title, An Affair of Love) is an unusual love story, insofar as it unfolds ""in reverse.""  Every Thursday, at the same hotel, at the same caf, ""He"" and ""She"" (they are totally anonymous) meet in order to satisfy their sexual phantasm.  Their anonymity is not without recalling Alain Renais' characters in Hiroshima Mon Amour (1958) or Last Year at Marienbad (1961).  But here the ordeal is not that of the memory nor of the bomb, but that of a trite story of two people who do not know how to love and communicate.

""She"" (Nathalie Baye), a mid-fortyish, confident, unattached woman, felt the need to realize a sexual phantasm.  To this end, she placed a classified ad in a pornographic journal (or was it on the internet?).  ""He"" (Sergi Lopez), a handsome man, ten years her junior, answered it.  Now sitting at two different locations, they recall their adventure to an unseen man, answering his questions, as the camera goes back and forth between the two characters.  Their descriptions of the circumstances which lead to their first meeting are remarkable by their lack of consistency.  But, if their recollections of specific facts have grown vague, the strong emotions engendered by their love for each other and their tragic break-up are still very much alive.  The rest of the story is presented in a series of flashbacks, interspersed with the characters' comments to the interviewer.

In spite of their national origins, young Belgium director Frederic Fonteyne and Iranian scenarist Philippe Blasband have managed to create the quintessential French film: a film created for adults, with a theme to match, unusual maybe, but still taken out of ""real"" life, psychological, philosophical and challenging to the viewer.  Fonteyne, in spite of his young age (he was born in 1968), speaks about love and feelings with great maturity.  He mystifies the viewer with his approach to modern sexuality.  No longer is it about a budding love implicating sexuality, but about sexuality implicating love, the latter being reconsidered by the urban individualism and a fear of commitment prevalent in our modern society.

Blasband's scenario presents his love story ""upside-down.""  Starting from a fantasy, which will eventually end up in love, he surrounds the slow but inevitable drift of the protagonists' feelings for each other.  Refined, with simple and subtle dialogue, he facilitated enormously the director's work.  For these two protagonists, it is not even a question of a ""love at first sight"" incident which leads to an immediate sexual encounter, and which, with time, gives birth to romantic love.  In this story, they meet, not having even seen each other (although ""She"" first states that he had sent her his picture, but she seems to contradict herself later on, and ""He"" says he had not sent a picture) for the only purpose of satisfying a very particular fantasy that she has proposed in her ad and that ""He"" had, at one point, obviously considered himself.  It could have been a complete mismatch of personality, physicality, mentality, and emotionality.  As it turned out, however, there seemed by some stroke of fate to be some mutual attraction right from the start.

The two characters recount to a third party, with emotion and an air of propriety, the passion that they were unable either to control or to really confess to each other.  We know that their experiment was a failure, because from the outset, their testimonies indicate that they are apart. But the way each talks about ""the other"" makes us want to discover this ""other.""  We would like to get involved in their story, know their pasts, their presents, and understand why they speak about the ""other"" with so much nostalgia.  They will never know each other's names, their ages, professions, what they do after their trysts, and we'll never know, either.

The rhythm and content of the story is controlled by the two protagonists who refuse to disclose the nature of their fantasy, allowing the director to impose upon the viewer the role of voyeur by limiting the viewer's space to that of the fantasy never revealed.  Actually, the word ""pornographique"" in the original title, Une Affaire Pornographique, is a joke, as there is nothing pornographic about this film.  Unfortunately, the distributor's arbitrary change of the original film title for the distribution in the United States, in order to conform to its apparent puritanism, denies Fonteyne's intention to fully condition, right from the start, the viewer's state of mind.  Each time the camera in the red hotel hallway bumps against the closed door of room 118 (red is the color of a phantasm that remains a secret), it renews and heightens the voyeur-viewer's interest.  This contrasts sharply with the only time the camera penetrates in the lovers' blue room to witness a banal love scene, which in fact leaves the viewer even more bewildered as to the nature of the fantasy.

The success of this film rests entirely on the flawless acting of Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez.  In this film, these two actors developed chemistry, which is the undeniable sign of mature actors.  Their interaction is totally genuine in their exchanges, both verbal and unspoken.  We can read on her face the birth of her love for ""He"": she wants to be happy next to this man, this one and none other.  ""He"" drinks cognac and dips sugar cubes into it while undressing her with his eyes.  We can tell that this man knows how to love women, mixing tenderness with desire.  There are also their gestures: ""Her"" expressing herself with her hands, admitting her need to always talk, even during love-making.  ""He"" is reserved, observant, always answering her many questions.

The original film score is some electronic music, unfortunately up to now unavailable on CD, by Andre Dziezuk, Marc Mergen, and Jeannot Sanavia.  There is a Rachel's track, ""Lloyd's Register,"" which is available on their album, ""The Sea and the Bells.""  When the credits are rolling, one hears a downtempo/trip-hop, drum and bass music, which recalls Funki Porcini.  It all fits perfectly with this unreal situation.

The shooting of the film took place in Paris, more exactly on the Avenue Kleber, which runs between the Place Charles de Gaulle and Place du Trocadero, right at the metro stop, Boissiere, where the cafe is located.  However, the hotel which in the story is just nearby the cafe is in fact physically located near Pigalle.

The main theme of this film is boundaries and their perilous crossings.  At the beginning of the film, ""She"" is within her own world, inside her own boundary.  This is symbolically represented during the opening as a crowd of pedestrians seen from her point of view, out of focus.  ""She"" has a sexual fantasy, but in order to satisfy it, she will have to cross the first boundary, one set by society.  Her fantasy cannot be fulfilled with members of her own entourage, husband, or intimate friends.  For this, ""She"" must look beyond the boundaries of sociially accepted behavior, to a stranger.  As both meet, they will be beyond society's boundaries in their fantasy world.  This accomplished, they breach another boundary when feelings develop: the boundary fixed by love.  A whole new world appears to them, a totally unexpected world.  Finally, there are the boundaries of understanding and commitment, which they are unable to cross.  At the very end of the film, we see again a crowd of pedestrians out of focus: she is back within the confines of her own boundary.

As a result, Fonteyne shows us a modern society where sex is no longer taboo, but love is becoming such.  He never moralizes or resolves these apparent contradictions, but instead brings them into harmony as never done before him: the modern world denying love and the Judeo-Christian world negating sexuality.  In the process, Fonteyne destroys the actuation of the phantasm and reinstates it in the secret, in the intimacy, both personal and private of the viewer.

Finally, the film tackles another great theme in the relationship between man and woman: the incommunicability.  The fears that each feels: the fear of love, the fear of confessing this love one bears for the other to the other, the fear of appearing ridiculous, the fear that the feeling may not be reciprocated or has not progressed as rapidly in the other.  The final scene at the caf reveals and underscores a cruel, intense moment, the like of which I do not remember having ever witnessed in any film before.  Very little is actually said, as most of the dialogue is in individual voice-overs.  All the walls come crashing down on one woman and one man who, by all accounts, we judge were meant to be united for life.  And this failure in a relationship which we were starting to take for granted is due to their incapacity to communicate.",1157414400,28,8879,4.940700808625337

This one does leave some mystery as to exactly what they did or did not do but you find yourself ok with the ending instead of being frustrated (like many French Films can leave you feeling....think ""Irreversible"", for one).

 An Affair of Love is  for people who like a lot of dialogue and who are into Foreign Films with depth so it is not for everyone.

They start sleeping with each other on a regular basis, but they refuse to learn any intimate details of each others lives.  Ultimately they fall in love, but neither is willing to admit it, either to themselves or each other.  In the end, both want to have a more enduring relationship, but each thinks the other is not interested, so they go their separate ways.  There is a heavy sense of melancholy over this film, and the director tried very hard to tell the story of a love that `might have been'.  In the end though, I found that two lovers who were so intimate for months, but who had no capacity to really talk to each other, not to really be in love, and the sense of melancholy misplaced.  This total lack of communciation made their entire (purely sexual) love affair, in the end, shallow and trite (although perhaps this is the tragedy).  They never made their connection:  how could they really have been in love if they couldn't connect better?  The acting is good, if not uniquely memorable.  The initial scene is particularly compelling, however, as both actors make a convincing performance of the uncertainties and hesitations surrounding two total strangers meeting for sex.  Overall, this is a solid, if not outstanding, performance by Nathalie Baye.  A solid performance by Sergio Lopez as well, although I found his character to be annoying, he looks and in some ways acts in this film like a thirty-five year old guy who is still living in the basement of his parent's house.

1394440,4,B000055YV3,"""An Affair of Love"" (numbskull translation from the French, ""Une Liason Pornographique"") poses the question: How do you avoid falling in love with someone you make love to once a week for six months?

The protagonists coyly named (or not named, really) Her (Nathalie Baye, luminous and oozing with humanity) and Him (Sergi Lopez, slightly menacing, slit-eyed, friendly) meet each other through an ad for the sole purpose of having sex once a week. Very Adult, Very French, Very Non- Committed: they go into the affair with their eyes open, their bodies available and willing and their hearts closed.

The affair is conducted very much like a fencing match: each one advancing, looking for a reaction and retreating when there is none or not the one they want. It is very apparent to us that they are in love about half way through the film even though they do not know each other's name or anything about each other's life. Is this possible, does this make sense? Oh yes. Loved played at this kind of level is what Her calls: Ivory Tower Love. Love of the highest, though not the deepest order.

Director Frederic Fonteyne's mise en scene is bursting with the beauty of the Eiffel Tower area of Paris: cars buzzing by, caf's busy with customers drinking espresso and red burgundies and eating plates of cheese and sausages and he throws Him and Her into all of this with the see-all camerawork style of cinema verite'.

""An Affair of Love"" ends with a huge sigh: not of relief but a sigh of lost chances and wasted opportunities: it is thoughtful, it is real, it is ultimately full of sorrow and regret.",1105920000,22,1603,4.673758865248227

Naturally they end up falling in love and destroying their relationship at the very moment when it seems that it has a future.

That what could have been yet another Tango in Paris actually works is down to the strength of the performances - refreshingly, not once does Lopez resort to some of his more overused mannerism - and the fact that both characters prove somewhat unreliable narrators in Phillippe Blasband's script.

The always wonderful Spanish actor Sergei Lopez (With a Friend Like Harry) and the beautiful Nathalie Bay (Catch Me if You Can), star as two unnamed strangers who meet weekly to fulfill their fantasy for ""a pornographic affair"".

The film has all the elements that attract the intellectual European movie goer, and all that is rejected by the typical American viewer. It is a love story with only two characters, and almost everything happens in just two locations (a restaurant and a hotel room). The drama is based on character development, rather than cheesy dialogue, and the eroticism is all but explicit. It is a love story, but it departs from the usual romantic comedy pattern and escapes the cheap predictable happy ending that spoils many American movies.
In the end, we are left with a simple story of un-realized love that is intense, beautiful, and poetic. This is a wonderful film, recommended to anyone who dares to try something different.

It has an innocence and viewpoint that had it been an American film, would have been entirely different.  Also the age of the actors is refreshing that they are not in their 20s.  These are mature adults.  This is something I like in foreign films.  Here in the US, youth dominates the movies scene.  You almost forget there is life after 30.
This movie is done as an interview after the fact and through flashbacks.  It is about a man and a woman that meet anonymously through an ad in a magazine.  The woman had placed an ad, in order to fulfill a fantasy.  They meet over several months and over time a relationship develops.
Through this interview, you begin to realize that they have developed a certain regard for one another, but the oddity of their relationship and never even sharing their names puts a certain restriction on their taking the relationship farther.
However, through a shared tragedy, they realize their feelings are not so easily ignored.
The actors are perfect in this story.  The one scene with the two in bed where they opt for ""normal sex"" is so innocent, that you forget these are two strangers who have met for sex at that time for over 6 months.  It is touching and cute in a way.

7931299,2,B000055YV3,"There are other reviews here which describe the plot, so I won't repeat it. I found this a disappointing and unsatisfying film, for two reasons. First, I just didn't identify or empathise with the characters - I found them rather immature. Second, there are many unexplained things in the film, like who is interviewing them after their affair is over, and why. Also, why do they both place ads for a casual sex hookup, when they are both clearly sensitive people, not sex addict types? The atmosphere is very sad and melancholic, with no happy ending (but that's no bad thing). It's a great idea, exploring modern society where sex is easy to get but love is hard to find, but somehow this film is too swamped in melancholia, and the characters are too teenagerish, to make its point well. A shame. I know some people love it, but I didn't.",1314489600,3,841,4.576158940397351

It show the emotional transformation without turning into a chick-flick. It's quite smart and thought provoking.",1296172800,2,242,5.230769230769231
