Is this stuff new?  No, it is scientific facts that have been given to man since the beginning of time  but it has most definitely been  suppressed.  I am not a Christian in fact I am a Muslim but his truths resonated with my soul.  The Holy Quran says ""truth stands out clear from error"".  Please I urge any one who is sick or suffering check out this DVD and get the book.
After reading Horowitz works continue to search for truths you will find them. Ask yourself soulful questions and God  will give you  answers I guarantee on anything you want to know.",1183507200,8,718,4.412213740458015
8126123,1,B000FS2WMG,"When I read the title Healing Celebrations I thought I would hear

wonderful stories of people who had been healed of illness.  The

description led me to believe I was going to gain additional insight  about natural and spiritual healing.  This DVD is a political treatise about the medical system in the US at the present time and during the last

90 years.  Dr. Leonard Horowitz is passionate and angry.  Since I invested the $90. I have been watching the DVDs.  It is emotionally upsetting to listen to Dr. Horowitz' anger at the medical and political system

and an event which happened to his family. He has a right to his

anger but we should not have to listen to it. This DVD is fear

provoking.  If you are ill, you could become even more ill by

succumbing to the fear he arouses when describing the medical system.

It is extremely important that we do not fall into victimization while

listening to the DVDs.  Anyone who is in the need of healing needs to

believe they have the power and the positive energy to heal.

Dr. Horowitz does not stay within the realm of the medical system and

healing.  He talks at great length about the Illuminati and politics.  He spends considerable time talking about the disturbing art at the Denver

Airport.  This does not contribute to the healing process.

In my opinion this product should not be considered a DVD on healing. It it a political DVD and a disturbing one at that. Perhaps it is important for us to learn what he has to say but we should be given the opportunity to choose whether we want to watch something that is deeply disturbing when we are looking for information about healing.

I am a minister and a healer.  When people are in the process of healing they need to surround themselves with positive energy and information.

The power of positive thinking is old and wise advice. I feel the primary focus of this DVD is to arouse fear.  The passion and anger with which

Dr. Horowitz speaks has had a negative affect on my body.  I feel as

though my stomach is tied in a huge knot after listening  to the first

two and one half DVDs of the 4 DVD set. I feel the description on

the package was completely deceptive.  As I mentioned it may be

important for us to learn this information but the packaging should

be honest.  His presentation is deeply disturbing.  It would be better

to learn this political information from someone who is not as angry.  $90. is a tremendous amount of money to have spent on something which

has literally made me feel physically ill due to the anger and content

of the presentation.  It would be much better to seek out a soothing

and meditative presentation with positive thoughts and ideas.

He should not have been allowed to use the title and descriptive

words he used in his packaging.  I feel he is taking advantage of

unsuspecting people who may be ill, people who need to feel the

presence of love and support.

Anger and fear can can make any health situation much much

worse.  How can I believe his political views when I feel

deceived by the advertising he used on his product.

Dr. Horowitz talks a great deal about scripture.  I believe

it is important to remember that Jesus' message is love.

He used love to heal.  Jesus NEVER evoked fear or anger.",1168560000,11,3283,4.501706484641638
