1827842,5,B000087EYL,"My mother bought this video for my 2-1/2 year old Bob the Builder lover on the day it was released.  He watched it SIX times throughout that day!  He quotes from it!  Really love that it is feature length instead of a few different episodes in one.  Love all the new characters, too.  First time the've ever showed child ""characters"" to my knowledge.  My son loves the part when Spud goes to the library!!  I hear Bob's brother is his twin -- can't wait for that one!  I agree, probably the best Bob video to date...",1048204800,6,516,4.302083333333333
1827843,5,B000087EYL,"Okay, so we are big ""Bob"" fans. We have many of the videos,
and toys and computer software... so it was likely that we
would enjoy this too. But I have to say that this video might
be the BEST Bob-the-Builder video yet. We love that it is one
long story, rather than the usual several short unrelated stories
on a tape or DVD. My son (age 3) was so excited to see Bob's Dad,
and thinks it is so funny that he and his father have the same name, and
the ""Dad-Bob"" calles the ""Real-Bob"" by the
name ""Bobby""! If you already love Bob and the Gang I know you will love this one.
We can't wait for the one with Bob's brother... due out in October 2003. (I hear it also has Elton John!)",1047945600,7,678,3.9926470588235294
1827844,5,B000087EYL,"The kids & I really enjoyed the DVD. My only complaint about the DVD is the lack of chapter selection. This means you can't go to any specific section of the movie, you have to fast forward to the part you want to watch. Also there is no menu, so you always have to watch the movie trailers at the beginning. They should have spent the time adding chapter selection to this product; otherwise, this movie is very enjoyable.",1047859200,8,423,4.367088607594937
1827845,5,B000087EYL,Great movie.,1253836800,,12,5.5
1827846,5,B000087EYL,"I've bought it for my son because he loves the farm tractors. The tractors that he has watched in that cartoon are splendid. They are very real and all the characters,as well. Also I think the story of this cartoon movie is really interesting and fun. I'm Italian but I'm trying to teach English to my son. A cartoon like this is very useful",1219104000,,341,4.34375
1827847,1,B000087EYL,"I was very frustrated when I put this DVD in.  You cannot navigate it at all, and it forces you to sit through 10 minutes of advertisements for other HIT products before the show begins.  If you know what it is like to have your child whine in a grocery store for candy and gum displayed prominently at child eye-level in the check-out line, you know the feeling.

This reason alone makes it totally unsuitable for repeat viewing.  I give it the lowest rating.",1211673600,,460,4.440476190476191
1827848,5,B000087EYL,"Bob the builder gives us in each film a classy lesson on how one should treat family, friends and associates. I make sure to watch his movies with my kids. Bob the Builder can be insightful and motivated for all age groups. An excellent example is this movie I'm reviewing. Bob has been most gracious with his father, did not want to to hurt his feelings although the father has been interfering with Bob's core responsibilities. Even when the father informed the guest that he was Bob the Builder, Bob did not say anything but at the right moment he confronted his father gently and corrected the situation. We all should learn from Bob the Builder how to be kinder, gentler and more gracious.",1173312000,,694,4.604838709677419
1827849,5,B000087EYL,"My two boys love Bob the Builder and this is by far their favorite Bob the Builder DVD.  They can watch it every day.

I sat through it once and enjoyed it myself.  Especially interesting to me was the rather adult issue of what happens when parents of their adult children will not acknowledge that their children are now adults and end up treating their adult offspring as if they were still children.  Been there; done that.

The characters are well designed; the story moves fast; the colors are very nice on a good television, and the message is positive.

If you or your children like Bob the Builder at all, this is a must for your DVD collection.",1145404800,,654,4.453781512605042
1827850,2,B000087EYL,"This was our first Bob DVD and maybe I just chose wrong. My son waited for the theme song the whole time and it never played. Maybe that is the norm...

This whole thing is kinda strange. My son likes it but doesn't love it.

I simply should have researched more.",1118361600,,263,4.137254901960785
1827851,5,B000087EYL,"We have 6 or 7 BTB DVDs and this along with The Big Game are some of the better ones.  Very nice full length movie style episode about Bob and the Gang, and a castle visit.  Has a story line to appeal to the grown-ups as well, with some tension over Bob not being treated like an independent adult by his visiting father(also Bob).",1074124800,4,331,4.15625
1827852,5,B000087EYL,"Bob the builder is great fun.  My two boys are big fans, and even I get a kick out of Bob, Wendy, and all his talking equipment.  This is longer than most of the Bob the Builder shorts, but the kids watch just as intently.  Bob's dad (and near the end his Mom) are a great addition to the Bob family of characters, and this episode even has a little suspense...though nothing to upset the little ones.",1063756800,11,401,4.181818181818182
1827853,1,B000087EYL,"If you are used to watching BTB of the BBC 1998 series you will be extremely disappointed. Bob and his gang's voice have changed & so is their favorite line to 'can we dig it'. There should be options for English,American English & others.",1051142400,6,239,4.454545454545454
1827854,2,B000087EYL,"Bob the builder had lots of adventures, & this one is the best!
Bob & his gang have to mend an old castle. That's right! A old spooky castle! Luckily, there are no badies so young children will enjoy it too! Young kids find it easy to get scared. This shall be a great video for children who get haunted. Did you know that you can see Skip, a new character, in the background?
I must not say any more or I might spoil it for you!",1049846400,4,429,3.942528735632184

7979293,1,B000087EYL,This is not the tape that arrived at my home.  I got some other tape that I had not ordered but It is such a hassle to return an item that I don't bother.  I was never able to get the film that I wanted so I was disappointed.,1385078400,,225,3.5714285714285716
