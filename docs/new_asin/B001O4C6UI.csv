8329423,2,B001O4C6UI,"Alpha Video retains their reputation for putting out bad quality on cheap discs. A lot of people forgive the quality because of the price, but in this case, like many of their releases, you get what you paid for. The only saving grace that allowed me to give two stars instead of one was the fact that they put out ""Sundown on the Prairie"" which is not widely in circulation. I have a print from fifteen years ago on VHS that is better picture quality than Alpha's version, which promotes it being a ""lost"" movie and that isn't so. For years Alpha has been posting their logo on the corner of the screen, and even freeze-framing the opening and closing credits. But now, having viewed their version of ""Where the Buffalo Roam,"" they are adding sound effects to the sound track! During the bar room brawls, you can hear the sound added. If you want cheap products and don't care about the quality, then this is for you. But if you know the difference between a ""restoration"" and an ""alteration,"" be prepared for alterations. For me, it was a waste of money. Course, I'd pay fifteen bucks for a gorgeous print of ""Where the Buffalo Roam,"" unaltered.",1296086400,2,1147,4.545893719806763
