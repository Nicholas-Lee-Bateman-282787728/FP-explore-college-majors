8052470,5,B0007VZ8RC,I remembered this story as a child.  I wanted to share it with my little ones.  This is a cute short story to share with your kiddos.,1382572800,,133,3.888888888888889
8052471,5,B0007VZ8RC,"I'm a MS & HS German teacher and I think these DVDs are cute and the closest school-appropriate, non-disney Grimm's fairy tales I've seen yet. Each feature runs about 25 mins. and there are 2 on every DVD which is cool. I also like how they pair a known story with an unknown, so it's new to the kids. A great German-related movie to show (also great for standardized testing days!). The two-pack of these DVDs is great, but even the individual DVDs are a deal!",1210982400,,461,4.372093023255814
