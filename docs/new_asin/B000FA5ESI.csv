so quite upset",1184198400,,85,4.3125
2558036,2,B000FA5ESI,"Ahmeds show could hardly be heard, sound all muffled. It got a little better half way threw. hardly made it worth the 24.95 paid for it. I would never recomend this.",1178496000,3,165,4.354838709677419
2558037,5,B000FA5ESI,"This product was an excellent buy. The only feeling of dismay and doubt was towards the rather high price. Other competative websites offered a discounted price, and this option staggered in my head for quite a while. I, however, decided to purchase from Amazon because it provided the security the I am comfortable with. Furthermore, the product was brand new and in excellent condition. The DVD came within the provided arrival expectancy. Lastly, the DVD was hilarious!",1154995200,,472,5.142857142857143
2558038,4,B000FA5ESI,"I thought these comics were hysterical. They share a lot about themselves and are very likeable on an individual basis. Dean's impersonation of George W. Bush is the best I have seen. I am still laughing out loud.

The only glitch is that the sound is not that good for the first comic, Ahmed Ahmed. But they seem to have worked out the bugs after him.",1147478400,5,352,4.333333333333333

8119728,1,B000FA5ESI,"I've seen Ahmed Ahmed live and on ""The Axis of Evil"" comedy tour DVD.  He is a very good comedian, but the production of this DVD is just so bad.  The audio is amaturish and the Videography is just terrible.  I also didn't think that Ahmed was into this show either.  He seemed slow and hesitant.  I was expecting another exceptional show, but it just didn't materialize.  The other two comedians were hampered by the same production flaws, this just isn't a good DVD.",1259798400,,468,4.511904761904762
8119729,1,B000FA5ESI,"I'm a fan of Axil of Evil Tour. So I had high hopes when I ordered this item. ABSOLUTE LET-DOWN!
No criticism of the comedians. Just the production values. I have to strain to hear what the performer is saying without any success. The video feels like they got their cousin to come in and shoot it like an amateur home video.
I blame the producers for trying to make a fast buck from the Axis of Evil fame.",1230163200,,406,4.151898734177215
8119730,2,B000FA5ESI,"the production of this dvd was very low, could hardly hear what the comedians where saying on stage without having a very high volume on my sound system.

great comedians, but the quality of the dvd pulled down the enjoyment of it all unfortunantly.",1222905600,,249,4.659090909090909
8119731,5,B000FA5ESI,"Axis of Comedy is a must for all cultures. I first heard it on KLOS the Mark and Bryan show doing an interview with one of the comedians. I had to pull over from laughing so hard and my eyes tearing. For the 15 minutes of interview and a few clips from their DVD, I immediatly found it on Amazon.com at Movielink at the best price in town. I ordered it the same day and received it in nine days. After watching it with my wife, I rolled up in stitches. For those of you who remember Don Rickels, he was a night club comedian who's jokes were most always picking on another race, culture, and religion (in a good and clean way). At the end of every performace, Don would appoligize to any and everyone who may have been offended by his humor. He said you have to laugh at yourself before you can laugh at each other. To this day in his 70's, he is still doing his act and he started in the 60's. It was his way of showing in times of war and racism, you can have fun making fun at others and relating this kind of humor to himself. This is what Axis of Comedy has done. Don was using his american Jewish culture and Axis is using their Arab, american humor to make the world see that they were not the cause of 911 as Don was not the cause of the Koren war. With comedy that works like this, I would hope it could spread around the world and maybe it could help even if in the smallest way, to lay down the anger everywhere, and use comedy to fight back. I am an american jew. When 911 happened, my thoughts of all Arab countries, people, (even americans with a dark tan), did leave me to wonder how much hate and anger that was stored up in me. With this DVD, I realize it is not color, race, creed or religion, it is people who use their built up anger to vent it on others who have more or are different in the ways they were and continue to be taught. Sorry to get off on a tangent, I think I was just trying to promote laughter and comedy as a way of taking my anger out on anyone. I personally can not laugh and cry the same time. You also can't love and hate the same time.
Thumbs up for the Axis of Comedy team. Hopefully you can break the barrier between good and bad with your comedy act. You just did it for me.

8119732,4,B000FA5ESI,"I had seen the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour and the PBS program on Middle Eastern comedians and enjoyed these a lot, so, I decided to buy this DVD and enjoyed it very much.  It was not as organized or as well recorded as the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour, but I enjoyed the comedic view of life from the eyes of the men and women who have been hit by 9/11 twice-as an American and as people of Middle Eastern descent!  Having friends and family from that part of the earth myself, it's good to have a program using humor to get people in and out of the family talking openly about these issues.  Really a great way to open your eyes and get to know ""your world""!",1213228800,,653,4.046511627906977
8119733,3,B000FA5ESI,"This dvd comes before Axis of Evil. The begining is a little shacky and the audio is not very good. The dvd doesn't look like it was shot by a professional.  The contents are funny, but the Axis of Evil is better quality. On this video there is one lady comedian and she is great. I did enjoy this DVD to a point.",1210464000,,313,3.9682539682539684
8119734,3,B000FA5ESI,"It was funny. A lot of repeated material from the Axis of Evil comedy tour, but lots of new matierlal, especially the girl at the end. It was great - my only complaint was the sound quality. You had to turn up the volume very loud to hear some parts, and you still missed other parts because of the sound quality.",1205798400,,313,4.147540983606557
8119735,5,B000FA5ESI,"Give this DVD more publicity. It should be seen by all those people out there who are unfamiliar with Muslims in America, who think they are all terrorists. It isn't enough for those of us who are curious about our fellow man, and therefore search for knowledge, to see these commedians. The DVD might change a few mindsets at least.  The commedians have probably been on late night TV talk shows, but they need to be on Oprah or Ellen if they haven't been.",1203120000,,457,4.440476190476191
