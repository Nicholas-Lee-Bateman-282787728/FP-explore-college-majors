2874844,5,B000RSIWVO,"I had seen bits & pieces of this in the past. I decided to buy the whole set. It was advertised as 9 DVDs, 7 DVDs and 2 bonus discs. Only 7 discs arrived. I called Amazon & they sent out a new set, with also only 7 discs. They then checked and said the the supplier only sent them 7 disc sets & told me to return it, instead I kept the 7 discs and was given a discount, Now I see that they're advertising it as a 7 disc set. Anyway, here's my review: Each disc run about 50 minutes to an hour. It was recorded in 2007, so it is full screen, not wide screen, but the quality is good. There is a lot of talking, which I actually like, which makes it different. The premise is a group of ""oldies"" acts, many of them 1 or 2 hit wonders, sitting in a studio, and all telling stories about what it was like to record, tour, etc. in the 50s & early 60s. Some stories are really fun to hear. There is a moderator to keep things organized. There is a band & 3 backup singers, and the moderator will say, why don't you get up & do your song. Most of the performances are very good. Some of the artists (you may not know the names, but if you're from that era, you know the songs) are Jimmy Clanton, Jay Procter of Jay & The Techniques, Otis Williams of the Charms, Ketty Lester, Dee Dee Sharp, Len Barry, Frankie Ford, Ray Peterson, Jewel Akens, Dave Sommerville of The Diamonds, Dodi Stevens, Carl Gardner of The Coasters, Denny Lane of The Moody Blues, Mary Wilson of The Supremes and quite a few  more. It's sad how many of these artists have passed away since the show was made. If you like this music, it's something unique. I believe one of the bonus DVDs is the music performances without the discussions. My only complaint is the packaging. It isn't necessary to put 7 1 hour shows on 7 DVDs, each in its own case.  Being a collector, my space is limited ans they could have put 2 shows on one disc, or even 3 without losing any quality, and made this a 3 DVD set. They also have packaging that will hold up to 4 DVDs, in the same space as 1 DVD case. All in all, I'm happy I bought it.",1464307200,3,2084,4.031400966183575
2874845,5,B000RSIWVO,"For those still enchanted with the music this IS- without question- one of the best videos available. As artists from that stupendous era of 50's/60's  pop rock dwindle off to that great recording studio beyond, this is THE video to own.. Not many concerts, not many vocal ranges exist so our alternative is video. Rock & Roll Graffiti is very unique in several ways.. Numerous one hit wonders showcased  rekindle the mood and each performance shines with unmatched exhilaration. What's more, among their own peers, ALL of them are having one helllofa good time. It's sort of ""on the inside-looking in""- reflected in their admiration for one another.  Quite possibly, these artists finally absorb the impact of one another- and just how potent their songs remain. All done in a town hall kind of setting with about 35 of them seated semi circle.  When the kazoo from ""Johnny Get Angry"" sends faint giggles thru the assemblage to The Browns' ""Three Bells"" meriting a standing ovation--what's that tell you?  Considered by some as the epitome of bubblegum, ""Sugar Shack"" and ""Dizzy"" will have one thumpin' along with the rest of the group- as if YOU were present. ""Go Now,"" from Denny Lane, and ""Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye"" are tentacles which seemed to never let go of us. Both selections will grab you, just as that first heart throb did. It's all good in Rock & Roll Graffiti.  Very Good.  A nod to the center ""shoop shoop"" gal with the afro hair- she's naturally marvelous! Although I have yet to receive my order I've no doubt that the ""backstage pass"" segment. and. in the  deluxe edition. the audio discs will earn a hallmark in my mediocre collection of various forms enshrining the greatest music ever laid down. For a sample-""search"" Rock & Roll Graffiti and click on Frankie [Sea Cruise] Ford's thundering rendition of Ferlin Husy's ""Gone.""  If that don't move you- perhaps your pacemaker needs to be re-routed to your soul.  Dabbling in over 40yrs of ""pop-phobia""- an entire wall of 45's, jukeboxes, videos and books on top 40 radio and recording studios-I highly recommend Rock & Roll Graffiti as a must have.",1443657600,3,2122,4.804945054945055
2874846,4,B000RSIWVO,what was on the video was great but important songs were left off the video.i saw the original on u tube so I know for a fact that a lot of songs didn't get on the video-not good,1399420800,6,178,3.710526315789474
2874847,5,B000RSIWVO,"This is one of the best - and most important - Rock and Roll DVDs I've ever watched. Producer/DJ Larry Black gathered 37 R&R legends from ther late 50s to early 60s together in a studio in 1999 for a few days and let them sing and tell stories (and what amazing stories). The seven-hour, seven DVD set preserves it all. There are artists here, for who I'm sure no other footage exists of them singing and talking. Names like Carl Dobkins Jr., Ketty Lester, Dave Sommerville (of the Diamonds) and the amazing Gary Paxton (Skip and Flip, Hollywood Argyles). Where else are you going to see Mary Wilson (Supremes) singing Diana Ross's lead vocals with Nedra Ross (Ronettes) singing Mary's back up part? I can't rave about this set enough.

The problem is that legitimate new copies are not available on Amazon. (Not sure why). But you can get it direct from Black at (...). (This is the site where you can also find Black's Country Family Reunion DVS, which I've also begun to review here on Amazon.

8202447,1,B000RSIWVO,"Absolutely the WORST music collection I ever purchased. I opened disc 1, listened to half of the first song and turned it off forever.

I guess it's my bad for not reading the ""venue"" information. This is a collection of lead singers, etc. from old bands, but they're performing with some group of studio musicians. The first cut was Danny, from Danny and the Juniors, singing ""Rock and Roll is Here to Stay"" and I can't believe the musicians had ever even heard the song - it was awful!",1493078400,,487,4.47191011235955

8202451,5,B000RSIWVO,"I first saw a shortened version of this on PBS sometime between 1999 and 2000.  It was recorded around February 1st, 1999.  I ordered the 3 VHS set  with my pledge to the local PBS affiliate, and have enjoyed watching the extended, however contacted Larry Black after DVDs became popular.  He informed me that they were working an even more expanded compilation would be released in the future.  Forgot about it, and after seeing the VHS in my cabinet, searched Amazon and found this.  The DVD set was copyrighted 2007.
This set has so much more than the VHS, and I'm like a kid in a candy store.  What a wonderful time this must have been for the performers.  So many have passed just in this past year, I'll treasure this collection.",1467158400,,735,4.515151515151516
