7844362,5,6303343775,"I've had and used this video for what, 15 years now? I bought it when it first came out and pray the tape holds out until it is released on DVD.
(maybe it has been and I just haven't found it yet? )

To increase the intensity I use handweights. It is still one of my favorite videos when I have a full hour to work out.
I love Gin, love the music, love the movements, love it!
I feel completely worked out when finished.
Keep moving, it is good for your body and your brain!",1259884800,,474,3.9375
7844363,5,6303343775,"I like this workout so much I have 2 copies of it. It is a combination of step moves and aerobic dance, I myself would rate it intermediate. I consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser and there are some moves that may take a couple tries to get, but it isn't hard to follow at all. Lots of fun combinations and fun moves, there are ponies, mambos, a fun one that Gin calls ""The Caveman"", then you have your basic, turn steps, A steps, over the tops etc. I like Gin as an instructor, she seems to be having fun in this workout as do the background exercisers. Not a hard workout, some might even think it is way too easy for them, but I always seem to get a good workout from it. Get yourself a copy if you can find one. I just wish it was on DVD.",1103932800,2,753,3.993377483443709
7844364,4,6303343775,"This video is the fourth I've tried from the Reebok series.  Like the others, I found this workout easy to follow and I was able to complete all the moves the first time I popped it in my VCR with no problems.  ""Aerostep"" is advertised as being ""a unique combination of step training and aerobic dance,"" but the moves are really no different from other step videos I have (basic step, over-the-top, L-step, grapevines, lunges, etc.).
The workout is divided into the following parts: Warm-up, Tribal Fire-Up, Rhythmic Blues, Rock Stop Pyramid, Vibrant Jazz Medley, Total Groove Plateau, and Cool-Down/Stretch.  The first four parts are about 8 minutes each while the last three are a little shorter.  When I read the workout breakdown, I was really excited, but they sound cooler than they are.  The movements don't really resemble the high profile titles they are given (except that you do an ""A"" step movement in part 4 which kind of resembles a pyramid).  The music also does not change much through the different segments.  The changes are rather subtle.  The movements are pretty basic and, whereas Gin Miller's cueing isn't quite as sharp on this video as it is on her other tapes, the workout is very easy to follow.  I think this is a beginners' workout that is even easier than Reebok: The Video.  Basic arm movements are used and there is very little propulsion added by Miller and cast.  It is 45 minutes and is over before you know it. While not as fun as the other Reebok videos, Aerostep is a good beginners' video and a nice ""lighter"" workout for those who are more advanced.",1042070400,7,1589,4.679856115107913
7844365,5,6303343775,"this workout is awesome. I love how it keeps changing sequences, but then puts all of them together at the end. To me, a woman who has been stepping for 8 years, I see this as a multi-level workout. It's not too difficult as an introduction (it touches on all basic steps), but not too rudimentary for seasoned steppers as she puts the moves together in a new way. It's all what you put into it. Sometimes I do this tape with weights or do extra power moves or do it as is. Gin Miller is a great instructor and the background is well-lit (something I prefer). Of the 4 Gin Miller workouts I own, this is my favorite and one that I always keep handy.",1018310400,5,649,4.158730158730159
7844366,5,6303343775,"I know I've already written a review for this video and gave it 4 stars, but after doing it yesterday, I realize that this video deserved 5 stars!!  I did it yesterday for the first time in probably about a month, and it was so much fun!!  The routines were fun and all different, so it never got boring. This time around, her cueing was fine (I must've been distracted last time), and I just enjoyed every single part of it. This is one of my favorite workout videos and one of my favorite step videos!!  The music is great, the setting is gorgeous, and Gin Miller does a great job of instructing (as always). I just hope Reebok and Miller keep making videos!",994723200,3,660,4.306451612903226
7844367,4,6303343775,"No matter how much you may love to exercise, there are just those days when you find yourself less-than-enthusiastic about dragging out your step. THIS is the video for those days -- a good, solid, fun workout that doesn't leave you exhausted and ready to climb back into bed. Gin Miller's cueing and instruction are top notch, the music is funky and the set is fun in a way that is relaxing rather than distracting. The moves are varied and easy to follow so they keep your attention. I own all of the videos in the Step Reebok series and this is still one of my favorites. Give yourself a break from high intensity step routines and enjoy this workout guilt- and dread-free!",982886400,8,676,4.504065040650406
7844368,4,6303343775,"Gin Miller and Reebok have created the best step videos around.  This is not my favorite, but it's a good solid workout with plenty of moves.  I did not get bored easily (which is my complaint with other videos like Kathy Smith).  In fact, I was so frustrated with this one when I first saw it that I put it away for a month before attempting it again.  After I tried it again and got the moves down pat, it's now one I do at least once a week with my others.  Gin uses the floor as much as she uses the step, but it's still a good solid 45 min. workout.  A nice addition to Reebock's step videos.....",981676800,2,601,4.008403361344538
7844369,2,6303343775,"The only gripe I have about this video is that the music was very slow.  The choreography was interesting, the cueing was very good...and the transitions between combinations was very smooth.  The music just wasn't  inspiring or fast enough for my personal tastes...but I did sweat and was  sore the next day..  Anyone familiar with step could do this video.",948326400,8,358,4.9
