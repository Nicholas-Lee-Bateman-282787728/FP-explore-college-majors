666279,5,630350986X,This movie breaks my heart. But it's such a good movie. I feel so many things whenever I watch it. I absolutely HATE the way the main characters think. They see each other the way they WANT to see them and to me that simply pushes them into thinking they are that way. Each of them takes advantage of the other and feeds off each other. Remus character is the one that gets me the most...I feel sorry for him but hate him at the same time. It's so difficult for me to see the actor anymore cause all I see is Remy. But to me that's a sign of they did such a great job in their roles. The movie seems so much more...relevant...now more than ever cause this is how it is these days. It makes me sick,1505433600,,697,3.9857142857142858

Privilege truly has a way of blinding folks.  I do, however, believe the story offers many the opportunity to examine the lives/experiences of others.  It provides food for thought which has the potential to become a powerful place from which deep, meaningful, and lasting conversations can take place.  I know...I (African-American) had many a conversation with my then (former) college roommate about these experiences around the time this movie was originally released in the 1990's.  Twenty years later, we still talk about those experiences and how they have informed both our lives and subsequent understandings of how we interact with others today...",1409097600,2,838,5.415384615384616

666774,4,630350986X,"Higher Learning is a very bold film, that shows the paths of 3 college freshman and how they develop socially during their first semester in college. They start out as a group of naive kids, who don't even understand themselves, and develop into different personas that fit the group of friends they choose to fall in with. It's really interesting to see how 3 people, who are all in the same boat, wind up on such different paths, simply as a result of who they choose to spend their time with. I can't really say much more, but eventually their paths will cross with some very interesting results!",1361664000,,599,4.555555555555555

The black characters are made to look like they're so cool and that they are still prisoners living in the ""white mans country"". Its ridiculous that people still think like today. This movie is just making people dumber and misinformed. I also hated how the white cops are shown to be so racist against blacks. Seriously john singleton??

666870,1,630350986X,"Lord almighty how many films is America supposed to be subjugated to the endless race or sex riots from Hollywood? I swear we should figure that opinions on race one way or another is brought up 100x more in our media and movies than in real life. They attempt to portray both history and the present yet each time they including Omar Epps seemed leaching to a fetish of good guy and bad guy culture wars! The true culture wars are in Hollywood and Washington.
In real life whites, blacks, women, everybody has their fair share of problems and issues. These movies portray a one sided and two dimensioned part of a world, like college, really is like. College and life is not a world that is sliced up into cliques that define by race or sex.
The world is divided between one idea; those that believe they are better than the rest. Behind every group whether it be the KKK or the NAACP pride pulses in their cores.
What are we supposed to do with movies like this? And what about the constant stream hypocritical or self riceous material coming from Hollywood? Each one tries to portray what America is like when it's obvious to some of us that they have no clue. Each release seems a lot like their own instructions to us on morality. It's like gimmie a break. They give us sterotypical images of sexually assaulted women, young black males, or socially outcast young white males, the same kind every time. This does truly contradict whatever illusion of good group vs. bad group message they attempt. In this movie every character in one group was good and thoughtful and victimized while another group were dramatic enemies. As wonderful a conflict story this may seem movies like this are made from and made with folks that have never lived or witnessed conflict of this kind ever. A preppy college divided by gender, race, and background. In the world we live colleges are divided by a hundred more things than that! The ironic thing in truth, groups separated by those things are the ones that get along the best with everyone. It's really no different than high school. You have the jocks, the preps, the poor, the rich.

Again, what are we supposed to do with this film. In the end there is one majority and one minority. Those who know the truth vs. those who do not.",1255219200,2,2276,4.5512195121951216

666873,4,630350986X,"Higher Learning came and went in theaters due to its nature and content. Movies that focus on issues of race will always get mixed reviews. So the masses either slept on it or allowed WASP-owned publications like Jive...oops I meant Vibe ragazine and countless other ragazines to persuade their opinions. So it fell on deaf ears and John Singleton was forced to make MTV-style fodder like 2 Fast 2 Furious, Baby Boy and Illegal Tender. Had this movie been accepted with all its flaws, I believe that Singleton would have still made movies with substance.

Higher Learning is centered around 3 people: Kristen(Kristy Swanson), Malik Williams(Omar Epps) and Remy(Michael Rapaport). Kristen  has trouble fitting in and after getting raped she befriends an female activist(played by Jennifer Connelly) and joins her movement. Malik Williams is a track star that has to deal with a stern professor named Maurice Phipps(Laurence Fishburne) and a track coach that has no time for tardiness from Malik. He has problems in class as well as problems on the track and he befriends Fudge(Ice Cube) as well as an attractive female track runner named Deja(Tyra Banks). Remy is from Idaho and has problems adjusting to college life. He ends up making friends with skinheads whose wrongheaded advice and racial bias change him for the worst.

Higher Learning has its flaws: the pacing is meandering, Scott's(the leader of the skinheads in this movie) goons are unconvincing and Busta Rhymes is so out of place in this movie that you unintentionally laugh at him when he is on screen. Omar Epps does a good job as the well-intentioned but somewhat naive Malik. Michael Rapaport does as well as the confused Remy. Fudge is probably Ice Cube's best performance on screen. He dropped jewels in this movie that the sheep that watched it have yet to pick up. Laurence Fishburne fared well as Professor Phipps. Tyra Banks did okay as Deja even though Tyra is not known for her acting abilities. I thought it was a good attempt at showing a subject that people would rather dodge than face head on(Racism). While not perfect, Higher Learning is one of the last movies of substance(Rosewood is the last) that John Singleton made before he started to pander to the MTV crowd. The fact that Baby Boy was accepted more than Higher Learning is a reason not to take these snooty critics seriously. This movie is recommended to people that like movies that deal with serious issues and can handle them. To anybody else why waste your time?",1228176000,6,2508,4.882629107981221

Where neo-nazis and the black panthers go to recruit new members.  Where interracial and homosexual couples have to fear being attacked.  Where campus shootings are bound to happen.

A movie about reace relations in college was a great idea and there are good performances from the leads in the film.  The movie made some great points about students needing to appreciate the opportunities college brings them and taking responsibility for their own lives.  However it also puts the characters at such extremes that it makes a totally unrealistic portrayal of college life.  If this is what the writer went through in college than the university should be ashamed.",1222560000,2,796,5.304
666875,5,630350986X,"When released back in 1995 Higher Learning painted a potrait of how colleage really is. As someone who is from the east coast and goes to colleage in the south I'm could easily relateo everything that Malik experienced. You watch this film, and think, oh, college was never like this when I was in it. True, however, John Singlton likes to make films that many other directors can not make, thus because their imagination of things needs to focus on the basics in life. What excaly does that mean? Well, the story is based on one very hard and evil thing:racism. It's in the world, and some people go around there lives, the word racist doesn't even cross their mind. Singlton just makes films that are gut wrenching, and he so does not fail with Higher Learning. There are three main characters: Malik, Remy, and Kristen. Malik, is played by Omar Epps, (love and basketball), he's on the school's running team, and if he doesn't start paying, he can say bye, bye, bye, to the team. Remy, is a shy person, he tries to make good grades, like a normal person. About halfway through the film, he falls in with a bunch of skin-heads, and they decide to get even with the school. Kristen, is played by Kristy Swanson (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and she ends up raped about 20-30 minutes into the film. Her roomate, whom is black, finds out, and they turn to her friends, including Ice Cube, and they of course, find the guy, and try to beat the living crap out of him, only to be stopped by police on the campus. The whole film is not based on black verses white, it takes a look into people, their fears, hopes, and dreams. Kristen goes to a support group, run by a girl named Taryn (Jennifer Connelly), whom finds herself, uh, attracted to Kristen. The story finally ends in a bang litterally above all great film great story great ending nine out of ten stars one of Singltons best do not miss the terrific film",1221350400,3,1909,4.472779369627507

666910,3,630350986X,"Singleton lightens up on the militantism and anti-establishment attitude that plagued so much of Boyz N Da Hood. Boyz was a microscopic view of the world, while Higher Learning is a macroscopic view.

My favorite storyline was Kristy Swanson's. While watching an HBO special of this years ago, Singleton said he wanted a ""REAL"" white girl to play the role of Kristen. He proceeded to tell the story about how on one day he was wearing a Malcolm X shirt and Kristy Swanson asked him was that himself on the shirt. She got the role. She should have gotten poked in the eye instead, but anyway...

Tyra Banks is good in this and so is Michael Rappaport.

Ice Cube spits knowledge about the enslavement and oppression of blacks, yet he comes off more as a bully than a deep thinker and distributor of wisdom. He gets off intimidating his white neighbors by purposely playing his music too loudly, then acts threateningly when confronted about it, or about anything. Busta Rhymes is here to utter ""white boy!"" a few times and to whip a little ""white boy"" butt. Other than that, he's useless. And this is my one big complaint about the film: the behavior and thoughts of the black characters are at times just as bigoted and reprehensible as the white characters' yet, Singleton makes it clear they should not be judged as problematic or troubling, but as misunderstood or justified actions and thoughts of angry black people who have a right to bully people just because the world isn't fair to them.

The film doesn't deliver on everything it sets out to do, but its heart is in the right place.",1149206400,4,1591,4.631205673758865

667024,3,630350986X,"Higher Learning had the potential to be a really great movie portraying college life, identity crisis, and social conflict during one's freshman year at a university. Director John Singleton assembled a talented cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Omar Epps, Kristi Swanson, Jennifer Connelly, Ice Cube, Tyra Banks and Michael Rappaport. Unfortunately, Higher Learning does not live up to its potential.

Why doesn't Higher Learning live it up to its promise? Because John Singleton couldn't decide on what kind of movie he wanted to make. The first hour of Higher Learning is the movie's strong point. Here we watch students arrive for their first day on campus, move in, decorate their walls, and adjust to life away from home. Anyone who has ever lived in a dormitory can relate to this experience. It is also during the first hour where Singleton brings up issues relating to racial conflict, sexual assault, money problems, alienation, and the struggles of balancing school work with a job and social life - all issues that anyone attending a college or university must contend with.

However, Singleton loses focuses in the second half of the film. What began as a fairly decent social drama quickly descends into an adrenaline-pumping action film/thriller. While the film remains engaging throughout the second half, you can't help but feel that Higher Learning is essentially two different movies.

Here is what would have made higher learning a top notch film. First, add an extra hour of movie time. A truly insightful drama regarding the complexities of college life needs to be three hours in length. Second, scrap the whole Malik vs. Remy subplot and instead focus on the character development of each man and each's adjustment to university life. Third, what the hell ever happened to Krista in the second half of the film? Her character goes from being one of the key elements during the first half of the film, but then she becomes only a minor player in the second half. Krista clearly came from an affluent white area of southern California, while her black roommate came from an entirely different social world. The film hints that both were stunned at first at the prospect of being each other's roommate. I would have liked to have seen Singleton devote time to develop the transformation of the two girls' relationship to that of close friends.

Singleton's best film remains Boyz N The Hood. It would have been nice to see Singleton take Higher Learning more seriously and treat the film as a serious social drama on college life, like he did regarding gang violence with Boyz N The Hood. Having criticized the movie, however, I must admit that I do like Higher Learning and could personally relate to a lot of the subject matter contained in the film. During my junior year of college, a white supremacist organization had announced its plans to appear on campus in March to protest its opposition to a specific, unspecified group of people. Tensions mounted on campus, and fear circulated among students as to who might be the targeted group (Blacks? Latinos? Asians? Gays?). Like Higher Learning, a multicultural festival was hastily commissioned by the university to provide an illusion of campus unity.

As a male, I can't speak with much authority on date rape and sexual assault on campus. However, there certainly is a racial/ethnic divide that exists on America's campuses as evidenced by the rise in hate-based activities over the past decade. In the two universities that I have attended, the student population consists primarily of white students who come from either suburban middle-class or rural backgrounds, and a smaller number of blacks and Latinos who come from Philadelphia. For many students, college is the first time they have any real contact with people who are unlike themselves. This can, and often does, result in escalating tensions and cultural clash...such as what is depicted within higher learning.",1114387200,18,3955,5.050535987748852
667025,5,630350986X,"Higher learning is a great film that a college person can relate to easy. I really enjoy this film alot, can't stop watching it.  John singleton is at his best with this movie",1109030400,,175,4.303030303030303
667026,3,630350986X,"Being a freshman in college myself, I was able to relate to a lot of the issues that are addressed in Higher Learning.  John Singleton does a good job of pointing them out, though he falters some on really examining them which keeps this film from really succeeding.  The movie follows three main characters: Remy, a white male from the not-so-diverse Idaho, Malik, a bad-ass Black male with an attitude and Kristen, an innocent White female.  The story revolves around these freshman and how they adjust to the diverse surroundings of Columbus University.  Along the way, a number of other colorful characters crop up - almost too many - that move the story along into a very intense and somewhat unrealistic climax.

Malik almost instantly finds solace with the school's group of angry Black folk, who seem to constantly talk about Black Power and how the White man is always keeping them down.  Kristen chooses to hang out with a couple of girls who really aren't the best of friends and ends up in the bed of a guy she doesn't want to be with.  Later she meets Taryn, a lesbian feminist who helps her cope with the rape and who inadvertantly makes Kristen question her own sexuality.  And Remy, poor Remy, just can't seem to fit in with anybody.  Try as he might, no one wants to include him until he meets up with the local gang of Neo-nazi skinheads who quickly make him feel at home.  Also present in the movie is Fudge, played by Ice Cube who is the Black clique's mentor and Busta Rymes, who does little more than spout out lines that all seem to include the phrase, ""White boy.""

John Singleton does a good job creating the problems and issues these students face as first time freshman, but beyond that, little is done to explore them and no conclusion is really reached.  The Black Power guys have a understandable dislike of the campus police officers and White people in general, but Singleton focuses so much on making their discontent justified that he never shows any sort of closure at the end of the movie.  Literally, Jennifer Connelly's character (Taryn) and Fudge (Ice Cube) and Kristen's boyfriend Wayne just drop out of sight the last bit of the movie.  You never see them, with the exception of a 2 second clip of Ice Cube, after the climax of the film.  What happened to them?  We'll never know.

There's some overacting at some parts, particularly with Busta Rymes and some of the scenes with the police officers are just ridiculous.  That's my biggest complaint about the movie is this totally unrealistic and biased portrayal of police.  They are all racist, White guys who exist only to rag on the Blacks and let the Whites get away with murder (literally).  The best parts of the movie are the scenes with the skinheads.  Cole Hauser, who plays the skinhead leader Scott, is simultaneously likable and scary.  He was the most interesting character to watch, as Hauser really acts the part out with a lot of charisma and fervor.  Of course, the movie wouldn't be complete with the Blacks and skinheads getting into a rumble and the skinheads getting their asses kicked.  For some reason I have this feeling Ice Cube had a lot to do with how that part of the movie played out.

This movie really doesn't compare to other dramas about racism and diversity, like American History X or Boyz n the Hood (aother John Singleton film) but it does offer some food for thought.  It gives you a glimpse of what might happen on a campus where the love of diversity is preached but not practiced and how multi-culturism can make a person isolated and alone.  I'm sure there's a lot of people who will find themselve's identifying with Remy throughout the movie, as his character is the one that generates the most sympathy.  So give the movie a watch, you may or may not like it, but it's definitely one that shouldn't be ignored, not during times like these.",1108339200,6,3876,4.618978102189781

A film this preachy is best viewed on a monitor sitting on a pulpit.  Second of all, it's not the envelope-pushing commentary it thinks it is.  In addressing various issues (sexual identity and racism in particular) Singleton creates very obvious targets and resorts to cliched, one-dimensional characters.

667076,4,630350986X,"'Higher Learning' is one of those rare college movies that actually has a lot to say and doesn't come across as pompous, schmaltzy or boring.  It focuses on several students from different backgrounds who have all come to Columbus university with different expectations of what uni life will be like.  First of all there's Epps, a scholar who has to use his spare time on the track to fund his tuition fees and who gradually finds himself involved in a race war on campus.  There's also Swanson as a pretty white girl who, after being date raped, finds herself palling up with Connelly, the college feminist and a lesbian.  However, perhaps the most powerful performance of all comes from Rapaport as a lonely kid who finds himself falling in with some neo-Nazis.
The emphasis here seems to be on the conflict between wanting to be your own person but still craving conformity and acceptance from others.  The racial friction is handled with a sensitivity and intelligence which unfortunately seems abnormal in many films, not just teen ones.  It's also a mercy that such stunning actors were given the roles, with both Epps and Rappoport bringing real sympathy to their roles.  This is some feat considering Rappoport becomes a neo-Nazi towards the end.  The fact that the director shows such sensitivity to such obnoxious characters speaks volumes of the quality of the movie.
If there's any quibbles it's over the stereotyping of Connelly's role, as it comes over that her lesbianity must breed a hatred towards men.  This is something that Connelly should not be given, as she is an incredible actress in her own right.  Apart from that though, this really is a very good film indeed that will really make you care for its characters, especially because even their most heinous actions are shown to have a reason.

These characters actually got along and found a way to live with eachother and even become friends despite the chaos around them.
John Singleton, in trying to incoroporate every problem on college campuses today (date rape, drained financial resources) shortsights many of them.  Instead, the movie principally becomes about Micheal Rappaport, and his journey from small-town insecure guy to violent racist.  It's in this character that the movie is strongest.  Rappaport's acting is suberb -- he captures Remy's insecurities and slide towards self-destruction wonderfully.

What I don't understand is  why he felt the need to portray such radical extremes in his characters,  thereby isolating real life experience from his over-inflated film. If his  goal was to produce a thought-provoking movie, what is the point of making  the final showdown a battle between blacks and skinheads? I am not  ""learning"" anything new by viewing cinematic tension between  these two groups. It isn't a new development that Nazism is built on  fundamentals of racism, ergo the film's climatic sequence is far from  interesting.
The director relied too heavily on college stereotypes to  bring anything fresh to the feature. Even the talented Omar Epps and  Michael Rappaport couldn't save a film that cast them in such limited  roles. Laurence Fishburne serves as the director's voice (complete with  goofy accent and oral fixation), and there is no sense of subtlety  surrounding his message. On many college campuses, especially in the  cravenly Politically Correct 1990's, racism is more apt to take on the form  of glances, whispers, quiet jokes and invisible battle lines rather than  loud slurs and gun-swinging farm boys in Doc Martens. An enemy that is  harder to see is the where attention needs to be drawn.
Furthermore,  Singleton attempted a portrayal of women's issues as a movement that is  also split between racial lines. White women's issues were completely  isolated from black women's issues. This was the most compelling aspect of  the film, but the director did not seem to move towards resolation of this  split. This issue he was content to leave as is while following through  with the over-dramatized plot line.
