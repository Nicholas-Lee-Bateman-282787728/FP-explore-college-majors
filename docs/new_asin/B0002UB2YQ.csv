2120299,2,B0002UB2YQ,"This movie started off interesting enough.  A man murders the gang that raped his girlfriend and is placed in the electric chair.  When the voltage fails to kill him, he is given the option to live or to be fried again.  He chooses life.  Enter storyline #2.  He is put into what seems to be a ""Cube"" type experiment: locked in a metal room with a psychotic man who claims to have also escaped The Chair.  It appears some government scientists are testing how long it will take these two to kill each other.  But that's not it.  Enter storyline #3.  A beautiful woman appears to the men.  It seems she is the host for an alien entity that her father contracted from eating a baboon that visited a spaceship in the jungle (Oh, how I wish I were making that up!).  The remainder of the film is a mess of Hell images, Kung-fu showdowns with cloned super-soldiers, and random shootings that make no earthly sense.  Someone should have read the script for ""Alive"" and pronounced this film D.O.A. instead.",1107648000,11,999,4.488888888888889
8031986,3,B0002UB2YQ,Awesome movie and has nice set design. Story isn't all that but if you are a fan of Japanese scifi it is worth checking out. The commentary on here is one of the best I've ever listened to. Very informative and the crew really seem to be enjoy doing the commentary.,1524787200,,265,4.215686274509804
8031987,5,B0002UB2YQ,Great Movie. Glad to finally own a copy of it.,1405036800,,46,3.7
8031988,2,B0002UB2YQ,"Tenshu (Hideo Sakaki) killed the 6 rapists of his girlfriend. He survives the electric chair and gets to choose between death and what is behind door number one. He finds himself  in a modernistic prison as part of an experiment. He is paired with a slightly deranged serial killer necrophiliac who also has a long list of misdemeanors.  The goal of the experiment is to have one of the guys kill the other for a reason that is later exposed at about the same time as that alien thing called the ""Isomer.""

The film is way too long. There are flashbacks to make the rape/murder more complex. The control room drama was bizarre and added needlessly to the length of the film, whose plot wasn't that overpowering considering the manner in which it was presented. Interesting concept made boring.

1 f-bomb in English subscripts. No sex or nudity.",1403395200,,844,4.6824324324324325
8031989,2,B0002UB2YQ,"The film has action and violence, (very japanese style), but the story goes from good to weird, i really expected more, yet is good for japanese movies fans",1262131200,,156,4.607142857142857
8031990,2,B0002UB2YQ,"** 2002. Written and directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. Based on a comic book. Tenshu Yashiro, after having been condemned to the electric chair, is given a second chance to live. He's locked in a room with another prisoner and their reactions are observed by scientists. Although the first 15 minutes are interesting because we don't know what the movie is really about, ALIVE disappoints very quickly. The director mixes an alien entity, weird flashbacks that don't bring anything to the storyline, mean politicians who don't hesitate to slaughter nice scientists and so on. Ryuhei Kitamira doesn't have anything to say to his audience. Already forgotten.",1215302400,,651,5.20952380952381
8031991,2,B0002UB2YQ,"After watching the brilliance that was director Ryuhei Kitamura's Versus, my first move was to instantly seek out and watch all of his other films released here in the states.  Enter Alive, the next feature length film that Kitamura released.  Much like Versus, it features the similarly bizarre plot elements, ultra slick and stylish direction, moments of brash violence, and even Tak Sakaguchi in a minor role.  Unfortunately though, where Versus featured a near unrelenting amount of violence that gave way to a few moments of exposition and plotting, Alive plays it completely the opposite way, with a near unrelenting amount of exposition and buildup with very few moments of actual action.  The film follows two prisoners, who after surviving their death sentence by electrocution, are given the choice to live but only as part of a government experiment... that's when things get really strange.  Turns out there is an ""entity"" that inhabits a person with the greatest urge to kill and gives them almost limitless powers, of course the military wants to harness this power through the surviving inmate.  Sounds pretty cool right?  Don't be fooled like I was, this is anything but cool.  Instead it's a slow-moving mess of a movie that isn't helped at all by it's 2 hour runtime (where in Versus you never wanted it to end, you'll find yourself watching the timer on the DVD player more than the actual movie here)and anyone who enjoyed (or loved like myself)Versus would be better served skipping this and seeking out either Aragami or Azumi for more familiar stylized and violent entertainment.  For fans of the film (both of you), Tokyo Shock has delivered a very nice 2 disc special director's cut of the film with some decent bonus features (Making Of Alive featurette, cast and director interviews, and trailers galore).  With Versus, it seemed like director Kitamura had found a cure for Narcolepsy (the condition of falling asleep spontaneously and unwillingly)with his kinetic, ""don't blink or you'll miss something"" delivery... well with Alive he's cured another sleep condition, Insomnia.",1200787200,6,2105,5.110787172011662
8031992,3,B0002UB2YQ,it went nowhere after that. it had decent special fx but the story was so so..Could have been better..,1157414400,,102,4.421052631578948
8031993,4,B0002UB2YQ,"Some movies can be compared to other movies but this stands alone. This runs along the lines of a pure thriller, a poke into the human mind, ""how much can you take?"" If your looking for somthing along the lines of ""The Cell"" and ""Se7en"" rent this before you buy it!",1123372800,2,265,4.215686274509804
8031994,3,B0002UB2YQ,"Alive is a film based on a Manga and, as any anime fan will tell you, Manga doesnt always translate to other mediums smoothly.  The film asks the viewer to accept an ever increasingly surreal set of circumstances so that, by the end, you are eseentially watching a cartoon.  Many people will be automatically thrown out of their comfort zones when the more sci-fi/fantasy elements are introduced, but by the time they arrive you're pretty much willing to go with it just to see what happens.

I liked following the main charecter, a man who has essentially done nothing morally ""wrong"" but is still punishing himself not for what he did as much as for what he couldn't do.  They contrast the charecter nicely with the more up-front insanity of his cell mate and the cold indifference of the scientists and government officials running the experiment.

By the time the end of the movie comes about, all bets are off, and you're just in it for the fun of watching two powerful creatures duke it out.  The film is extremely well shot with an interesting look.  The directors cut features a solidly different visual experiance than the theatrical cut (also offered)and is a real treat to watch.

The Japanese sensibility in filmaking is vastly different than the American idea, so there is a period of adjustment before you can get into any Japanese film.  IF you can master this shift theough, you are in for a real treat with this film",1117497600,7,1433,4.677290836653387
8031995,2,B0002UB2YQ,... this movie started out with an interesting story but falls apart after the girl is introduced as stated by the previous reviewer. Very good start but falls to pieces by the end. On the positive side the effects are amazing. Blows away anything you'll see in any Matrix film. The cinematography is also top notch! With a strong enough plot this would have made an amazing movie.,1108080000,3,381,4.617647058823529
