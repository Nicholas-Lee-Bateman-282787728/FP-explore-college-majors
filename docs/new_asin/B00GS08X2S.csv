6104952,5,B00GS08X2S,"Bradford has not changed one bit, and England neither, even in Yorkshire. At least it has changed since the early 1990s when I visited it regularly. I guess it is not exactly what Oscar Wilde might have imagined though, but we can forget about the nuclear power station: it is not from Wilde's time.

The film is so strong that we just can't believe some one has actually tried to produce and direct it. And I am not speaking of the accent. I am speaking of the human relations among the people there in front of our eyes.

You have those you hardly ever see. The teachers and school officials who are absolutely locked up in their authority game and in there syllabus targets and their official pedagogy that means detention hall every day, if possible, and humiliation any time you can, till you kick the kids you do not like out of the school for good because you just don't know how to deal with the world the way it is and it is not that gentle and pink sweet.

Then you have the coppers and the few times you can catch a glimpse of them, they are very nice, polite, nearly submissive. Do they really do their job of protecting people against danger? Probably not. They protect society against dangerous people, probably, though it looks more like protecting the normal people we never see in the film, those from the good neighborhoods, against the totally marginalized asocial - so they say in the good plush neighborhoods - people of the socially devastated and dilapidated areas of the city. Don't expect to see the cinema, the cathedral, the city hall, the wool exchange of Bradford and I was surprised we had a glimpse at the Queen Victoria Hotel.

So what is the interest of the film?

To center on kids, boys exclusively, out of primary school and in secondary or comprehensive school, and how they do not want to be treated like children, to be taken to doctors and fed all kinds of drugs to make them play the game of overgrown children. They want to live, to be independent and autonomous. They want to earn a living, in any way possible, even if dishonest. So far so good. These children are not treated, including of course by their fathers, when they have one that is mentionable, the way they should and they are made psychotic more than anything else.

The worst part of it though is that from a little theft to a big one there is only one connection to find, and in this case it is a salvage yard managed by someone who is accused of being a Romani, a gypsy if your prefer. He gives them good money for the metal they bring, even if far from what he should give them, and he rips them off and f*** them up or exploits them in all possible ways. But yet he does not hold them, the kids I mean, only with money. He owns horses and he holds them like that: he lends them a draught horse and a cart for their scavenging in the day time and he has a racing horse he entrust to one of the young kids.

That magic connection with the horses is what really matters.

The end then is absolutely tragic because you cannot steal live copper electric cable if you are not equipped properly. But the best part is after this tragic ending, the way two mothers can manage to salvage the survivor, how the dead kid's mother salvages the survivor. That is so human, so strong that it saves the film, it salvages our disbelief. Yes somewhere on this earth, not very far from us there are children who live that kind of hell on earth and they, some of them at least, manage to survive and grow up into adulthood. Girls have prostitution. Boys have the survival of the fittest and the death of the softest.

Such fates are stronger and more powerful than all the possible philosophies of this world, including Buddhism actually.

6104953,5,B00GS08X2S,"This is described as a contemporary fable and yes it is but it is a whole lot more. Set in northern England we meet Arbor, he has to take medication to control his temper, his father has left and his older brother is a drug addict who feeds his habit through petty crime. At school Arbor has a best mate in `Swifty', he comes from an impoverished background where he has numerous siblings and a loser father who spends every penny and is even reduced to selling his own furniture, but his mum sees Swifty's potential.

After an incident at school Arbor gets `excluded' or expelled as we used to call it. Swifty, who he was standing up for, gets excluded but only for a few days. With nothing or `nowt' to do they decide to make some money by working for a dodgy scrap dealer with Romany leanings. This is the strangely named `Kitten'.  He is happy dealing in stolen metal and cable and even shows the kids how to avoid the Smartwater that is used as a security device. Swifty has a natural affinity with horses and loves being with them so the rag and bone horse and cart are right up his street. Little Arbor on the other hand just wants to be the next Kitten. As things get ever more desperate on the home, front for both lads, they up the ante on the work almost unaware of the dangers.

This is simply an excellent film, director Clio Bernard - `The Arbor', has made a British realist drama with a heart and soul. The young lads who are the leads are both amazing. At times it feels unscripted or more accurately `natural' and that adds to the realism. The horses or ponies all look beautiful. There is a lot of profanity and some scenes that animal lovers may be upset by, due to  how the horses are treated but that should in no way detract from what is a stunning piece of cinema. It was part of the official selection at Cannes and I think deservedly so. So for a piece of realist British cinema that is bursting with emotion you could do a lot worse than giving this a go - I absolutely recommend.",1391126400,6,2006,4.284960422163588

6104955,5,B00GS08X2S,"When there is nothing else beautiful or redeeming in life. This movie is a portrait of a bleak, hard existence warmed through with the connection between two young boys who count on each other above all others, even though they are radically different in temperament and personality. The one apparent thing they have in common is how outcast they are and their determination to help their desperate mothers by taking on the work of men, as they are left with no other options. In its roughest form and manifestation, they are trying to be the head of household their fathers are not. Watching this struggle is heartbreaking, portrayed in a story that is both poetic and painful. As in many classic portrayals depicting coming of age, the bond between humans and animals, in this case horses, is expressed and symbolized as the one thing that brings both pride and love while showing how both child and beast are exploited by all who have failed them.
This is a film that will sit within you on a lasting level.",1388361600,4,1010,4.679775280898877

6104968,4,B00GS08X2S,"While not audacious and brave in it's style as Barnard's smashing debut ""The Arbor"", it explores much of the same territory  poverty in northern England. But this time Barnard uses a more neo-realist bent that recalls the films of Ken Loach, among others. And after two viewings, while I missed the wild rule-breaking she did in her first film, I felt she had made a film of gritty honest and emotional force.

The story centers on two young teens (very well played by non-pros). Diminutive Arbor is hyperactive, angry, and so on the edge he can be frightening and simultaneously heartbreaking -- Arbor needs meds just to allow him to be calm enough to function. And there's Swifty, his best friend who is introvert to Arbor's extreme extrovert. Swifty is willing to go along with Arbor's schemes to a point, but he also wants to honor his mother's wish that he get an education, and try to move up and out of poverty.

The two begin collecting (and sometimes stealing) scrap metal to sell to a tough local junk metal dealer, Kitten. This is a man who is capable of being almost a father figure one moment, and stomping you into the ground the next. A sort of modern Fagan, using the boys to do his bidding (although, to be fair, the boys come to him).

A dark, moody and ultimately deeply disturbing film, that refuses to let us or society off lightly when it comes to kids growing up in the cycle of poverty.",1410134400,,1410,4.517647058823529
6104969,4,B00GS08X2S,"But heavy. Why did I get the idea that this was a cute little story about two British kids who learn about selling scrap metal?  It was a very well acted and filmed movie, but don't be expecting a light comedy.",1403222400,,210,4.121951219512195
6104970,4,B00GS08X2S,"SOME PEOPLE LEARN LIFE LESSONS THE HARD WAY, that being said., our main hero Arbor (emotionally challenged teen) lives in a pathologically deprived environment of rural England.  He does not like school nor authority. Arbor has one friend named Swifty with whom he constantly gets into trouble and consequently gets thrown out of school.  Arbor and Swifty turn into collecting and selling scrap metal to a local merchant who also deals with horse-racing (that is where Swifty comes in).  The two boys bond really close, and stick up for each other until...the expected happens.

While watching this movie I could not shake off the impression that England was considered a developed country...The Selfish Giant (2013) surely shatters the image of that wealthy and prosperous James Bond's homeland.  Another thing that might strike viewers, is the profound and excess use of profanity (I myself was not surprised for English crime movies are well known for its startling use of language) but here we have tween actors aging between 12-13 using the word f...as if it was their first spoken word before daddy and mommy.

6104972,4,B00GS08X2S,"The story goes that a giant who was away for seven years returns home to his castle to find that the garden outside his home had become a playscape for the neighborhood children.  Being the selfish beast that he was, he scared the children away and put up a wall and a sign, prohibiting them from returning.  The garden itself was saddened by the loss of these children, and so Spring refused to return and the giant was left in total wintery isolation until the children snuck back into the garden the play, and Spring returned at last.  The giant realized his selfish ways and knocked down the wall he had built and welcomed the children back, including a young boy trapped in a tree who just so happened to be Jesus, and because of that kind act, this selfish giant is redeemed his sins and welcomed into Paradise.

At least, thats the way that Oscar Wilde wrote it.

Clio Barnards story is a little different.

There are some films that are so well conceived they tap into a part of ourselves we aren't used to addressing.  They ask really difficult questions and demand answers from us that we aren't too keen on actually giving.  The Selfish Giant feels like one of those films, and while it isn't as successful in parts as it is in whole, the film delivers a crushing blow that pulls everything together and lingers in the viewer long after the film has ended.

Barnards film tells the story if two young boys, Arbor and Swifty.  Arbor has some serious temperamental problems (for which he is supposed to take medication) and Swifty is soft.  Together they make an odd yet complimentary pair.  Swifty is loyal and Arbor is ambitious and together they find themselves expelled from school and on the road to making some good money for a local scrapper who entrusts his illegal activities to minors.  Sadly, things begin to shift for the two boys when Kitten, the scrapper, begins to favor Swifty and his horse-whispering ways.  Arbors ambition and reckless behavior catches up for him and soon things take a tragic twist that leaves the pair divided (in more ways than one) and their lives forever changed.

Finding the giant in this particular story is harder than you may think, because the possibilities are endless.  According to Barnard, her idea of the giant was the society itself (mainly the school system) that cast out these two young boys and left them to squander their lives, but there are many giants to be found in this story, including Kitten and, most interestingly, Arbor himself.

For me, The Selfish Giant kind of lives in Barnards direction.  There are some moments that could feel stilted or redundant and yet the way she crafts her scenes really engages and keeps the audience glued to each moment, and the way she handles the big moment in the end (so sudden, so muted) really shows the strength in her talent.  I cant wait to see where she goes from here.  She also managed to draw out some sensational performances from her two young leads, as well as the supporting cast around her.  Conner Chapman anchors the film as the unstable Arbor, deliver such an infectious and dynamic performance, but for me it was Shaun Thomas who really stole the film for me.  His facial expressions alone are so imbedded, so honest.

If you like the thought of watching desperately poor children in a slummy English backwater live out their Hobbesian lives, with no greater point, by all means enjoy. If you sit around most evenings thinking ""I know there are people in desperate straits living in terrible conditions -- if only I could spend a few hours watching life grind them down"",  then this is your movie.  I managed to make it through the film and regretted it.  However, I'm giving it 3 whopping stars because, for the most part, the cast (and presumably the director) did excellent work with preposterously, relentlessly bleak material.
