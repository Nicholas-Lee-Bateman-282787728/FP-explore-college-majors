1019448,5,6305334730,"After all these years I've finally obtained a copy of Jess Franco's wonderful and erotic 'Vampyros Lesbo'. This is one his best films and well worth the wait. Vampires out in the sun lounging in beautiful Spain is  something that is extreme and original from our contemporary vampire films.  The Cinemaphotography is great, as with the sets, lighting and atmosphere.  The music is just great and really merges with the film and its setting in  the early 70's. This is an intelligent film and not for those who enjoy  predictable Hollywood horrors. Also note that this was the beautiful  Soledad Miranda's last film and read the literature that comes with the DVD  before veiwing the film. This is a film that I know I'll watch more than  once!",948240000,16,743,4.75
1019449,3,6305334730,"This is the long awaited classic Jess Franco film, so the question is was it worth the wait?  A very qualified yes.  The print used for the transfer is far from perfect but it is more than likely the best print available and  it is not only servicable but probably the best this movie has looked since  it was released.
This is the longer GERMAN dub of the film and not the  original Spanish so the extra sensual material is present but the dubbing  is evident.
Okay technical considerations aside is the movie any good.  As fun as it is to see this legendary movie it is slow and somewhat  confusing, but the surprise is that it is a very academic movie, and lends  itself far too quickly to a lit-crit analysis.
I enjoied and it is not  bad but I will be honest I did have more fun listening to the CD of the  wicky wicky music",947203200,14,829,4.1835443037974684

1019602,3,6305334730,"""Vampyros Lesbos""(1970) is directed by Jess Franco. This movie in many ways echos Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula"", but has replaced the male vampire (Dracula) with a female vampire, Countess Nadine Carody (Saledad Miranda). And a character such as Jonathan Harker, has been replaced by Linda Westinghouse (Ewa Stromberg). In this movie women are lured to an island where the Countess romances them before feeding. The film was partially filmed in Istanbul, but it also appears that the island scenes were filmed on the same location as another Franco film, ""Eugenie,the Story of her Journey into Perversion""(1970), which was located off of the coast of Cartagena, Spain. This film is unmistakably a film from the 1970s with its psychedelic soundtrack, as well as the abstract quality of some of the imagery, and a recurring vocal track that sounds something like that of astronauts speaking in a alien dialect. The movie has a very hip and experimental feel to it, which tends to be upbeat and lively, rather than scary or horrific.

This is the German language version of the film with English subtitles. This German version was preferred by Franco over a Spanish version which had different music and some voice overs at the beginning which tended to make that film more conventional, and less abstract than this German version. This disc is region A,B, or C.

The blu-ray looks gorgeous for the most part as it appears to have been remastered and cleaned up. Special features include an interview with Jess Franco, another with Soledad Miranda historian Amy Brown, and one with Stephen Thrower, who wrote the book ""Murderous Passions: The Delirious Cinema of Jess Franco"". For another vampire film by Jess Franco which has a totally different look to it perhaps check out ""Female Vampire""(1973), in which Franco's next muse, Lina Romay, portrays a vampire.",1454112000,,1857,5.065359477124183

1019765,4,6305334730,"I'm not sure how this film did when it was released...but all these years later, it serves as a great example of early erotic horror, art film and alternative music.

Shot in Istanbul, Turkey, the story basically takes the original DRACULA and recasts it with hot women.  Soledad Miranda makes an alluring vampire, even as she's laying out getting a sun tan in a white bikini.  The other women all look good naked and the filmmakers think of lots of reasons to get naked.  ""Welcome, thank you for coming to my business meeting...let's go for a naked swim.""

From what I've read, the soundtrack was released on CD in 1996 and made it to the top of the British Alternative Music charts.

The early 1970's was a boom for really hot erotic vampire films.  The Roger Corman-produced THE VELVET VAMPIRE was just as lyrical and artistic as this film (with Celeste Yarnall seducing both the boy and girl in that film).  Britain's THE VAMPIRE LOVERS, COUNTESS DRACULA and LUST FOR A VAMPIRE just about cornered the market for hot naked vampire babes.  And definitely add 1975's VAMPYRES for even more wild, naked girl vampire scenes.

If you go into this movie expecting a bloodbath you will be disappointed, but if you like a movie that challenges your mind then this a good one to watch. Most of the reviews on here criticize it for being too cheezy or campy or just plain bad and I only can say that you are all wrong. It was a good film and obviously not made on a super high budget, so you get what you pay for.

1019769,2,6305334730,"Vampyros [censored for Amazon consumption] (Jess Franco, 1971)

Why oh why do I keep watching Jess Franco films? Well, I do know the answer in this single case: Soledad Miranda. A stunningly beautiful woman, easily on a par with any of today's ""supermodels"", cut short in her prime. While she made quite a few movies, you can't find too many of them in domestic release on DVD, so you take what you can get, and you're thankful for it. Unfortunately, most of them are Jess Franco films. Ah, well.

Miranda here plays Nadine Carody, a Transylvianian countess who has inherited everything owned by the last of the Dracula family. She, too, is a vampire (though it would be tough to recognize this by the general conventions of the genre; she has, among other things, quite a passion for [censored for Amazon consumption] sunbathing). Unlike most female vampires (at least, those about whom movies have been made), she hates men thanks to a childhood traumatic event, thus the title of the movie. Pretty obvious, huh? Ewa Stromberg, another of Franco's regulars (she and Miranda had previously teamed up in The Devil Came from Akasava) plays a lawyer who is tasked to execute Count Dracula's will. While on her way to the island where the reclusive (when she's not dancing in a strip club, anyway) Nadine lives, she is accosted by an odd little man at her hotel (played by Franco himself-- who looks for all the world like my father-in-law, which didn't help matters much) who warns her to stay away from the Island, for ""death reigns there."" Ah, wonderful horror movie foreshadowing! She gets to the island, finds out that Nadine is the woman she's been seeing in her dreams, and that Nadine has a lot more to discuss with her than some musty old artifacts that have been left to her-- and that much of the discussion must be [censored for Amazon consumption]...

Yeah, the plot is thin as paper, as is the case with many of Franco's movies, and is only there to provide a framework for all the really attractive [censored for Amazon consumption] people slithering around all over one another. And maybe I'm not a typical male, but you know, really attractive [censored for Amazon consumption] people slithering around all over one another can only take a movie so far. Franco's a competent enough director when he puts his mind to it, and his mind was to it here, but the awful script, the pathetic attempts at symbolism (oh, the poor scorpion!), the terrible pacing, the garish set design... it's a tough movie to watch when Soledad Miranda's not on the screen. Still, to get a Soledad Miranda fix, I'm sure many, many people have done much, much worse. **",1203379200,4,2656,4.719827586206897
1019770,5,6305334730,"Un film superbe,

Soledad Miranda est purement magnifique, ses yeux noirs nous hypnotisent, son visage expressif, sa sensualit crvent l'cran  chaque apparition et que dire de cette voix chaude... Dfinitivement, elle est une vampire redoutable qui sait user de ses charmes pour attendrir ses victimes!

Franco nous offre un univers fantastique color,  la photographie fort intressante (notamment pour les passages avec le psychiatre bidon), de dcor dlirant (Quelle merveille ces mches de laine rouge qui pendouillent du plafond! comme des gouttes de sang gantes!) et envelopp d'un trame sonore psychdlique exceptionnelle (et cela est presque un euphmisme)

1019870,5,6305334730,"i love the symbolism here--everytime nadine wants to make a strike, the camera zooms in on a scorpion walking the premises of her castle.  the stripshow performance is also very classy--where the countess much like her actions outside of the club controls the movements of her victims--and switches clothing with them (becomes one with the ones she loves).  very tastefully done, and hypnotic to watch-and the two main characters are exquisitely beautiful women--where they complement each other perfectly--the vampire is dark, and her victim white.  wonderful.",1191542400,2,561,5.5

  I knew I would have to use subtitles on this, so what?  The movie was stupid, acctually stupid makes it sound better than it is.

  There were vapires in the bright daylight; Ok, that wasn't so bed, but they were drinking stuff that looked like Kool-Aid and saying it was blood.  The few fight sciens that are in the movie are poorly done; I could do a better fight sciene.

  The lesbian sex sciense were so bad that I think I could make a better one; and I'm a guy.

1019872,1,6305334730,"This movie is a great example of how a bad film becomes tagged with the ""cult classic"" label. I think that this happened because when it came out in 1970 it was kind of risque, kind of psychedelic, and kind of cool in a trippy, arthouse hippy way. In 1970. But it's 2005 now, and this kind of film, and the school of film making that this came out of is unbearable to our changed sensibilities. People probably were impressed with the gorgeous Soledad Miranda - totally understandable. With her beauty being the only exception, the rest of this movie is extremely poorly done.

Other reviewers make comments about the ""thin plot"" or how this movie is cerebral, or literary. Baloney! There is no plot - things happen and a moment later it's as if what just happened, didn't.

There's an abundance of pans of ships in Istanbul harbor - shots of a scorpion, shots of a kite, blood dripping down a window - all to the effect that you're watching an amateurish cliche-fest.

The much hyped eroticism in this movie is barely there. The actresses seem like they were not at all interested in touching each other. There's lots of long, silent staring at each other, though. I guess to those who may enjoy taking drugs to enhance their movie watching experience, this may seem very ""erotic.""

I can't convey enough how poor this movie truly is, but here's one example; Nadine's (the vampire) henchman Morpho shoots his gun at two people on the other side of a set of French doors. French doors that have glass panes. The two guys duck for cover. Yet, they have nothing to worry about, as Morpho's bullets don't break the glass. Maybe he was just a really bad shot, or maybe this is a good example of the shoddy film-making.

Don't fall victim to the reviews that praise this as artsy, intellectual cinema. It's not. It's just bad.",1111795200,34,1821,4.57361963190184
1019873,5,6305334730,"Jesus ""Jess"" Franco is a director that's sort of a secret amongst serious horror film fans. If you're the type of casual fan of the genre who thinks that ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Halloween,"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" are the best films the horror industry ever made, you have never heard of Jess Franco. If you think the ""Leprechaun"" franchise constitutes the apogee of the horror genre, you have never heard of Jess Franco. If you think collecting Wes Craven and John Carpenter films are as far as you need to go to balance out your DVD collection, you have never heard of Jess Franco. I don't mean to give the impression that Franco is the best directorial talent ever seen in the field, because he definitely isn't, but I have found that knowledge about some of this man's films is one of the best ways to distinguish the novices from the veterans. His best known film remains ""Vampyros Lesbos,"" a fascinating take on the age-old vampire legend. This movie isn't for everyone, so look for something milder like ""The Blood of Fu Manchu,"" ""Faceless,"" or ""Ilsa, The Wicked Warden"" if you wish to adapt to his style by degrees. Whatever you decide to do, Jess Franco might just surprise you.

""Vampyros Lesbos"" is an amazing film in ways not initially obvious. The plot is as thin as a communion wafer, and on the surface about as interesting as one. Linda Westinghouse (Ewa Stromberg), a beautiful blonde, heads to Turkey to assist the enigmatic Countess Nadine Carody (Soledad Miranda) clear up some paperwork about an inheritance. That the inheritance has something to do with a Count Dracula never impresses itself on Westinghouse's mind. Weird things start happening shortly after the affable Linda turns up; she starts having strange dreams about Nadine, and her meetings with Carody take on a decidedly sensual subtext. As for the Countess, she spends her free time performing erotic dance routines at a local club. It takes awhile to get around to specific plot points, but when the movie does ""Vampyros Lesbos"" takes off. We learn that Carody is, of course, an ancient vampire, and we also learn she has designs on the clueless Linda. Recall how nearly every vampire movie you've ever seen has a male bloodsucker preying on women? Well, Franco was one of the few who turned that archaic formula on its head by having a female vampire seek female companionship. Without coming right out and saying it, you do know what I mean, right? Look at the title of the movie again. Yep, you got it.

As the movie progresses, we see Linda rapidly falling under the spell of Countess Carody. The two women spend an inordinate amount of time frolicking together before Linda heads off to an asylum. Her husband Omar (Andres Monales) arrives on the scene and sees what's happening, so he enlists the aid of the asylum's doctors to figure out what his wife is up to. One of the shrinks, Doctor Seward, seems to know more about vampires than any reasonable person should. It turns out that Seward and Carody know each other, but the doctor has had enough of the Countess and tries to destroy her in order to free Linda. Confused? Yeah, you should be. The plot IS convoluted. Jess Franco even shows up in a strange minor role as Memmet, some weird killer that lives in a basement abducting women. But don't worry; the film does make sense as you watch it, and is in fact a fairly dutiful adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. See if you can match the characters in the movie with the characters in the novel. That ought to help. But ""Vampyros Lesbos"" differs from Stoker's novel in fundamental ways. Miranda's vampire sunbathes, and religious iconography almost never appears in the film. Even the way to slay a vampire differs from nearly all other film versions of the Dracula legend.

I think the obtuseness of the film, and it can be obtuse when it wants to be, is due to the dreamlike quality of the production. Franco relies heavily on symbolism, hazy cinematography, zoom shots, and the sun blasted atmosphere of Turkey to realize a beautifully complex film. The best aspect of the movie will always be the luscious Soledad Miranda. This is one beautiful woman, and it's quite tragic that she perished in a car accident shortly after production wrapped on this film. I suspect if all vampires looked like the Countess Carody, there would be a rush of male suitors willing to bare their necks at the drop of a hat. Aside from the wondrous Miranda, and the abundant nudity in nearly every scene of the film, the music usually draws many comments. I didn't think the organ heavy psychedelic score was that spectacular, which surprised me because I'm a big fan of organ heavy psychedelic music, but I began losing enthusiasm for it after the same pieces kept playing over and over.

I would like to personally thank Synapse for putting this film out on DVD. The version here is in German with English subtitles, and although the quality looks bad thanks to a lot of jumping around every time a scene changes, that's more the fault of the source material than it is of the company that put this film on disc. Unfortunately, this DVD edition contains only a trailer as an extra. Hopefully, a new edition will contain interviews with Franco and some other much needed goodies. I really liked ""Vampyros Lesbos."" It's a strange film that intrigues viewers who watch it with the right frame of mind. Don't go into this expecting a bloodbath because you will be disappointed. Instead, look for something more cerebral and you should have a good time.",1097020800,39,5534,4.713842975206612

Finally, with the advent of DVD, movies previously difficult to obtain on VHS are now on sale down at Best Buy! Oh hooray for mass market American culture.
In VAMPYROS LESBOS, director Jess Franco inverts the story so that all the male characters are female and has all the action take place in broad daylight. Perhaps the best example of this is is when Linda Westinghouse (Ewa Stromberg as the Harker character) meets Countess Carody for the first time--it's Soledad Miranda, the mysterious, exotic and doomed Portugese beauty in all her resplendent glory: tanned, moist and clad in a white bikini, her depthless eyes shielded by huge sunglasses. A vampire sunbathing! How cool. Of course they promptly head to a secluded beach for some nude frolicking. Delightful!
Along with the well-known soundtrack, VAMPYROS LESBOS offers lots of funny arthouse satire, and a fairly efficient plotline. But the real reason to watch this film is for the one and only Soledad Miranda, who across thirty years still has the power to captivate viewers. With those surreal, dreamy sequences of her dancing with a mannequin, and her frequent nude scenes, you too will find her clouding your mind.

Filmed during the peak of his ""classic"" period (late 60s/early 70s)which can be rougly bookended by ""Succubus"" and ""Exorcism,"" ""Vampyros Lesbos"" stands as a classic in the genres of exploitation, erotica, and camp (I mean this in a non-derogatory way.)
Some of the Franco trademarks to be found would include:
1. A beautiful female lead, in this case Soledad Miranda (and Ewa Stromberg doesn't look too bad, either, so whether you prefer slender brunettes or curvy blondes, both bases are covered).
2. The director himself in a role--a creepy hotel worker who likes to take women down into the basement.  Granted, his role is not as extensive as the one he has in ""Exorcism,"" but he gets more screen time than he had in ""Two Angels Undercover.""
3. A less than linear plot.  The film has a plot, but the groovy '60s ambience is the main thing.
4. Groovy music, similar to the tracks found on ""She Killed In Ecstasy.""  In fact, during the striptease, a song plays where the word ""Ecstasy"" is spoken.

5. Photography/editing which ranges from the brilliant (such as a seduction scene which cuts to the image of a flying kite at just the right moment) to the questionable (Franco's overreliance on the crash zoom).
6. A virtual hodgepodge of cultures: filmed in Turkey, credits in French, filmed in Spanish, dubbed in German, English subtitles, actors from more countries than the United Nations.
7. The immortal line, ""Morpho!""
In summary, ""Vampyros Lesbos"" is the jewel in the crown for its director, and a must-own DVD.",1018915200,,1714,4.836177474402731
1019879,5,6305334730,"... If alien anthropologists came to earth to study us in our natural habitat during the late sixties/early seventies, what would their version of a Discovery Channel Special look like?
Well wonder no more!  As it turns out, a director named Jess Franco answered that question in 1971 with the release of his Vampyros Lesbos.
Vampyros Lesbos starts out much like the Disney Nature films of that era, except this time, human beings are the lemmings being driven over the cliff to make some sort of nefarious artistic point.
The film begins with the camera pointing at the sun rising over a ship at sea.  Or it could be of the setting sun.  We [the viewer] don't know because we are not told what direction we're facing.  An alien anthropologist starts narrating something, probably something like ""As the sun rises (or sets) over the Mediterranean, the Vampyro Lesbo rises from her lair to dress and then consume her prey.""
Most of the time, the camera just tells the story with the alien anthropologist narrator probably interjecting expository information as he/it feels is needed for his/its intended audience.  While the subject of this documentary seems to primarily be the vampyros lesbos, every so often other inhabitants of this great planet of ours is discussed/shown, including that mightiest of birds of prey:  the mighty kite.
From the human point of view, the movie is highly disturbing.  It has the paper-thin plot, as one might expect, as well as the explicit nudity/erotic scenes to propel that paper-thin plot along.  But all the while the thought nags:  What if it isn't nature show, but a cooking show?  Is our beloved earth the equivalent of an intergalactic four-star restaurant or just another fast-food drive-thru?
The DVD has a nice picture quality but is thin on the extras.  The movie is in German with English subtitles and there's a trailer that is in German with no subtitles.  The thing I would like most as an extra for this kind of film would be a commentary track by a Jess Franco super fan and/or a short bio on the key players or some sort of trivia.
But overall, I feel this is a very good buy and I will probably be thinking about this film weeks from now.  Or, at least days.",1015113600,8,2212,4.714285714285714
1019980,4,6305334730,"Don't be fooled by the title of the film. This is one of the more mainstream of Jess Franco's film, you could probably show it to your religious grandmother. It's erotic but not in that sleazy perverse way like Ilsa-The Wicked Warden or Female Vampire with one scene as a exception where Jess Franco himself plays a sadist who loves torturing women that he captures. But still it's sexy and elegant much thanks to the two beautiful female leads Soledad Miranda and Ewa Stroemberg. Miranda plays the lesbian vampire seducing Stroemberg. Dennis Price is the doctor who studies vampires cause he wants to be one himself and be immortal. The weird music is also one of the highlights, it gives the film a psychedelic atmosphere. And watch the film with the german dubbing, it makes the film even weirder. I give this film ""just"" 4 stars since it lacks the outrageous perverse atmosphere that many other of Franco's films have. But still it's gold worth and a must in your filmcollection.",986515200,4,983,4.754385964912281
1019981,4,6305334730,"As I haven't seen the DVD I can't comment on the quality of this edition but I would like to make a few comments about the film.  This is a good example of a certain kind of modernist European film that flourished during the 60's and 70's and whose echoes can still be seen in movies like The Ninth Gate and Eyes Wide Shut (more the latter than the former). Moody, atmospheric, often cryptic of plot, these works delivered a more cerebral experience even as they delved in heapings of eroticism.  In many ways these films, although thoroughly imbedded in the imagery of their times, hearken back to the early modernist cinema of the 20's.  As I was watching Vampyros Lesbos, I couldn't but help think of Nosferatu.  It is clear that Franco must have emulated that film from the plot, to the use of locations to the mise-en-scene, to the associative links between characters occupying spaces many miles apart.  In fact, this is the only vampire film I've seen that sucessfully captures the moodiness of Murnau's piece.  Franco also makes great use of split-edits to overlap the dialogue from one scene onto the visuals of the next.  He also uses an elliptical narrative that often disorients the viewer by blurring the identities of two characters and the subjective/objective relationship of various scenes (dream vs. reality).  In addition he makes a fair use (sometimes overuse, e.g. scorpion) of associative cutting which in the case of the red kite add an odd leitmotiv to the film (watch for the use of other red flowy things -- scarves, flags, etc.) These effects plus others, plus the wonderful funk/psychedelic score, all add to the trippy, meditative feel of the movie.  This is a very simple film (one is tempted to think a remake could be easily done for very little money) but a very effective, and oddly touching one.",984960000,6,1830,4.765822784810126
1019982,5,6305334730,"What can you (not) say about this movie: Mad trancendental set design, a hypnotic soundtrack and (a rare time-capsule)to the most wicked sick women ever to grace the high concept film genere. Soledad Miranda by herself sells the DVD! But the DVD also includes stunning Ewa Stromberg and bedroom eyed Heidrum Kussin.
 But this high concept ""Adult Fantasy"" is not just a cavalcade of Spanish and German beauties..NO SIR! With it's brash ""1970 's style"" hallucinogenic sets, idilic setting in Istanbul, Turkey (Precariously nestled between islands and the Black Sea) and an idea that still breathes full of life 30 years after it's release. Even though the DVD has slight distortions, blips and mild scratches,it does nothing but perhaps to serve as character for this film. This film screams 70's chic and I find it only appropiate that it look as such.
 The storyline is definitely one of the more abstract and twisted ones that I can remember. Even though the plot can become somewhat convoluted in parts, the movie still stands up visually, conceptually and phonically. In the years following this movie: Pink Flamingos, Gummo, Baxter and a few others have captured the same visionary outlook. But ""Vampyros Lesbos"" I  think takes the cake.  Originally shot in Spanish, the DVD version uses the uncut German language version - more risque content. The German dubbing adds to the feel of the feature, it helps in a way to make the film more erotic, with German being such a strong, forceful, yet pleasing and sensual language.
 Another intriguing aspect of the film is the lamentable sub-plot of tragic star Soledad Miranda (explained on the inside cover/leaflet) and the long uphill climb it took to get this movie to the U.S (also in leaflet that comes with DVD).
 In ending,  THIS IS A CAN'T MISS DVD!!! If you love high art or if it is just pure beauty you crave-Do yourself a favor-Don't let this one pass you by-Who knows how long this copy will be available or even around?.?..
 P.S. The movie does have a high degree of tasteful, artistic and some playful nudity--But don't be afraid to buy this movie, astonish your friends with your cult movie prowess. But don't fret-your not buying something x rated--it's not a porn--perhaps a hard R rating--with more erotic, tense situations that seem more forbidden-Thus the dirtier it seems. Thanks for reading!

1019983,5,6305334730,"If you're familiar with Jess Franco's work, then you know that all of his films were truly collaborative efforts. By that, I mean that it was the culmination of music, acting, post-60s psychedelia and early eroticism that made them 'classics' of the genre...and why we're still interested in them today.
This film IS brilliant simply because it takes you back to a time when the world was a much simpler place, albeit a sexier and certainly psychedelic one.  Shot in Hungary and Turkey, recorded in Spanish, dubbed in German with French titling is enough to make this release intriguing, certainly for it's language history!  Soledad Miranda is astonishing, and the jerky zooms and pans, mixed with bright colorations and simple techniques only accentuate how much can be said, without actually saying a great deal.
And if it's plot you're looking for? Well, it's certainly here.  Do any of the 'horror' or 'vampire' films of today have much more of a plot?  Not really; and consider the slew of flicks that are released each year whose ONLY redeeming qualities are a pair of silicone that everyone's seen before...Not here baby; ain't nothin' like the real thing.
So, to sum up this work, if you dig 1970, if you've heard the music (or know what true 'sexadelic dance music sounds like) and if you can appreciate a period piece that showcases the mediocrity of minimalist film-making techniques (including beautiful girls and fab color/sound) then this DVD is for you.
And on a technical note...the remastering for this film is terrific.  There are few glitches in the transfer (aside from a few scratches and 'greyed' scenes) and the MONO soundtrack (though suffering from some bad tape-edits) is clear and effective.
So sit back, take a trip, and put yourself in 1970...and be on the lookout for Vampyros Lesbos!",981936000,9,1815,4.937704918032787

It's 90 minutes of frustration and irritation... So folks, read reviews and CAVEAT EMPTOR! Well, gotta go watch Battlefield Earth again.

1019985,4,6305334730,"In the early 70s, some filmmakers did a lot more experimenting with sexuality and art than happens these days. Many of them combined the psychadelia movement of the time with the laissez-faire sexual attitude in their movie expression. You can see this in many of the ""midnight movies"" of the 70s.
Vampyros Lesbos certainly is a midnight movie, but unlike many midnight movies this one seems to click together a lot more. The scenes may be overpretentious at times but there are times when the film works, in its erotic-acid-trip imagination. Part of the reason for this is the tape-loop accented psychedelic-bachelor-pad score, which adds a lot to the mood and seperates this film from some of Jess Franco's other efforts.
I wouldn't call this a ""good"" film but it is a very effective ""genre"" film. This is one of the better examples of midnight arthouse out there.
The DVD gets one higher star than I'd assign to the movie itself, because the movie picture quality looks much better than I've ever seen it before.",976752000,,1015,4.805714285714286
