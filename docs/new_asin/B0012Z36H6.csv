8248381,5,B0012Z36H6,Excellent cartoon about God's plan for us as individuals and about accepting what we are not good at and embracing what we are good at.,1389916800,,135,4.44
8248382,5,B0012Z36H6,"I bought these for my daughter who is now 7 when she was 18 months old. I was so sick with my second pregnancy that all I could do was sit on the couch with her and watch movies or read. She has always loved these and I enjoy them too! I now have a second daughter who loves them too. I hope they make more of them. These are so cute and they teach little ones about God and good values. We have many mainstream kid videos, but I love that I never have to worry about them picking up on adult humor in these movies (and other Christian children shows) and they are not about falling in love and getting married! Not that falling in love and getting married is a bad thing, but I don't want it to be the main focus or goal for my girls. I want a relationship with the Lord to be first. I'm not depending on movies to teach my girls about God, the movies are just a nice little bonus.",1350432000,,882,3.9329608938547485
8248383,5,B0012Z36H6,"I was concerned about all the princess stuff out there and my girls growing up thinking they're entitled, spoiled little princesses and that everything should end happily ever after.  On the advice of a friend I checked this DVD out from the library. It was an instant hit!  My girls loved the pink, girly, princess-ness of it. And the fact that it has such a positive Christian message about true friendship, caring for others and being a princess because they are daughters of the Most High King made it an instant hit with me too.  We now own most of the DVDs and hope to see new ones coming out regularly.",1286323200,2,609,4.468468468468468
