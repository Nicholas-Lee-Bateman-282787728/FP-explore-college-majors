7272199,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"There are some disjointed or confusing scenes (likely created by earlier scenes that were cut out during editing) but the heart of the movie, Frankie and Nicolette's relationship, is very believable. Natalie Knepp and Diana DeGarmo are terrific leads and I'd love to see Diana in particular pursue more indie film roles. I do think the director tried to do too many storylines for an hour and 40 minute film but it was still a fun movie and very much worth the purchase.",1439856000,10,470,4.674698795180723
7272200,4,B00Z9HSFY2,"This is a light, enjoyable, comedy, romance with a happy ending.

Frankie Del Vecchio is in a rock band, has a boy friend and is close to her family.  Through a twist of fate she becomes involved with the ""Mob"" and meets Nicolette Bellafusco.  The story is about them eventually finding love while dealing with the complications of their families. the ""Mob"" and their expectations.

This is an independent film with fun characters.  It's a bit disjointed at times, but never distracting, and builds the relationship between the two leads over the course of the film.  Definitely worth a watch.",1439337600,21,593,4.88
7272201,5,B00Z9HSFY2,I thoroughly enjoyed watching this feel good movie... the love story was wonderful as well as all that surrounded it... coming from Queens/Bklyn I was able to totally identify with it as well... recommend this to all!,1514419200,,217,4.891891891891892

7272203,5,B00Z9HSFY2,Cute and funny movie about life as itlalin. This movie plays on different stereotypes and makes fun of them. Its a fluff ball of a romp where girl meets girl and girl meets mob life that she didn't know about.,1512950400,,209,4.25

7272206,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"Funny, fun film with the complexities of modern day issues bridging ethnic cultural traditions with an intriguing twisting plot.  Too often a film that rubs against the grain ends tragically but this ends in a familial, almost religious, way.  This is not a movie to expose the naughty deeds and naked acts of caring people.  It pleasantly surprises with great acting and direction.",1508630400,,382,5.031746031746032

7272209,5,B00Z9HSFY2,I enjoyed this film. I really enjoy movies and independent films and have watched so so many since i was a kid. This film hits every emotion and the cast was so well put together. Everyone really flowed with each other (as if they knew each other for years)! I found myself giggling and laughing out loud throughout the film. Well done!,1504656000,,336,4.435483870967742
7272210,5,B00Z9HSFY2,Great movie. Seen it multiple times and love it. Its very lighthearted!,1502841600,,71,5.0

7272212,2,B00Z9HSFY2,"this movie was set in NEW JERSEY and with a Italian family, one of grown up girls started a rock n roll band called ""altos""
hence the name of the movie , she play at different places, because her band is not made it big yet,
this family is all about watching a popular TV show on TV back than called mob hits,
and most of them want to be one of them and they act like mobsters as well, so they can say they are part of them'
come to find out there are some of the actors and actresses that live in the area too,
the girl is out playing her music one night and she is singing at a dark club and her eyes happen to meet with a sexy young lady in the crowd
that young lady ends up trying get her a gig to play for the show mob hits
she is also engaged already to a nice young Italian guy, , so this lady from the crowd try and try to get the alto band to sing for the
mob hits and she decides not too,but her and the lady trying to book the band decides not too
she gets very cozy with the lady trying to book the band and finds out  earlier her dreams of being a big time band
is not the same from her fiance, he wants to start a frozen food company and can care less about her band
so she keeps playing gigs and one day the lady trying to book her . lands a big juicy kiss on her lips ,
from that she decides  she would dable and see where this goes, and she wants to keep her dream alive
so without giving away the ending, do you see how the story line jumps around so much?
its really hard to stay with it as well, every time you think you have it figured out something new starts
this is suppose to be a lesbian story, in a way it is and another its a story in a story and its really confusing!
this could have been a really good show",1499644800,,1736,3.7534246575342465
7272213,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"This was a very well made movie, nothing like anything I have see before. It still got the main point across that the main character is struggling with her identity while still adding humor to the situation. It takes a great cast and a great script to pull this off and you did!",1498694400,,278,4.264150943396227

7272217,2,B00Z9HSFY2,"Good story, terrible writing, and my god the acting was KILLING me. I wanted to like this movie but it was hard to sit through it. I did though, suffer through it, only because I wanted to give it a chance.",1495584000,,206,4.048780487804878
7272218,1,B00Z9HSFY2,A muddled story; unfunny and tedious to watch.. Alto must have sat on a shelf for quite awhile because the hair and wardrobe of the leads are really dated for a 2015 movie. Inexplicable from end to end. Don't waste your time.,1494806400,,225,4.380952380952381
7272219,5,B00Z9HSFY2,This movie was GREAT. I laughed the entire movie. Definitely a must watch. I only rented the movie but I'm definitely going to buy it.,1492387200,,134,4.4
7272220,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"A taste of Italian heart and soul in Brooklyn.  It's' a romcom, so yes, what is shown of ""the life"" is relatively tame and light-hearted.  It's meant to be, as we're meant to empathize with and laugh with the characters as, from their various perspectives, they, um, ""figure things out.""  And while the principal relationship develops between two women, it's done very tastefully.  It's not exploited for the sake of wanton attention.

I found this to be a first rate, smaller independent film.  I've seen so many good but *serious* things, recently.  Just couldn't take any more of that.  And this evening, this little gem I'd added to my Prime watchlist just took me away for a couple of hours and showed me a place with hope and heart.  Brava.",1491868800,2,746,4.676923076923077

7272224,3,B00Z9HSFY2,Actresses need to be more convincing... you say all the right things to each other but the audience needs to feel it. Thought it was a clever and cool story line.,1485043200,,162,4.258064516129032

7272229,4,B00Z9HSFY2,"Girl engaged to guy; girl meets girl; girl can't get girl out of her mind.  You know the rest.  But this fun film locates the story in an Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn and the other girl (not the one who's engaged) is the daughter of a mob boss.  The story plays with both the Italian stereotype and the pushback against that stereotype.  I haven't seen the film in festivals or anywhere but if you've seen a lot of the usual lesbian films and are looking for something new, this one is worth the rental.",1482883200,4,507,4.361702127659575
7272230,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"I love Indie cinema because you'll only see the same ol same ol with mainstream films, and this is anything but.  Alto asks, ""so what if two women fell for each other and their families were in the mafia?""  It's not The Godfather meets the L-Word, nor is it trying to be.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a good thing.  It's lighthearted & quirky, with sincere performances from the lead actors.  Worth a watch!",1482192000,,426,4.48051948051948

7272239,5,B00Z9HSFY2,Alto is a fun movie which does a good job regarding Italian culture. I've used the same language all of my life. The two leads were very credible as women in love. I hope more movies like Alto will be offered in the near future.,1474848000,,228,4.088888888888889

7272244,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"Terrific movie. Have seen it three times and enjoy it more each time.  There is so much to absorb and understand about all the relationships in this movie.  Mikki Delmonico is a great writer and director.  The actors were excellent and the music a very enjoyable treat!  This is a  movie that deals with relationships in a very warm and pleasant way and brings you into the soul of the characters.  I loved it!

7272247,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"Ok, I'm biased.  I grew up in Brooklyn.  I had friends whose entire homes were furnished with things that ""fell off a truck.""  Maybe that's why I love this charming film.  It depicts a real place with the kind of wonderful, funny-sad-happy-weird nice people that we meet everyday -- but it takes a real artist to truly ""see.""

Well paced, funny, touching.  I look forward to more from Mikki Del Monaco -- who has a real ""eye"" and a sense of humor.",1470960000,2,447,4.390243902439025

7272250,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"I had the pleasure of seeing the film in a movie theater, and it was really fun to watch it in that setting.  It's got something for everyone, and everyone in the audience completely enjoyed the experience.  I am getting it for my collection because it's a film I know I will watch more than one time. Two thumbs up from this armchair critic!",1470873600,,342,4.328125
7272251,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"I loved it!!  So well written.  So well directed and the acting was outstanding.  It was a delightful romantic comedy.  It made me laugh....it made me cry...

7272252,3,B00Z9HSFY2,"It's a fun movie to watch in general. It looked like they had some editing problems. The story is a bit far fetched, but again, just fun. You can defiantly tell this is a first time director, but everyone has to start somewhere. Unfortunately, this movie does not contain a love scene or it was edited out. It's difficult when one of the lines is,""So you're sleeping with my daughter?"", and the viewer is thinking what? when did that happen? It would have made the audience buy into the two main characters much better.",1469923200,4,519,4.531914893617022

I didn't expect much from Diana DeGarmo (I wasn't aware of her musical theater experience so I expected no acting chops), but I was pleasantly surprised. Good chemistry between the two leads (DeGarmo and Natalie Knepp) and the supporting cast, especially Melanie Minichino and Toni D'Antonio, were strong and entertaining as hell.

7272292,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"This is a movie that  I will admit, sometimes gets a little too busy , but overall I loved it. The premise is unique and interesting  It isn't even close to the traditional lesbian film we're always stuck with. It's charming, it's funny, it has an actual plot where one isn't dying tossed into some great torment. And there's a harp in it. Irrelevant I know, but I liked it.

7272330,5,B00Z9HSFY2,"This is a fantastic movie and has an absolutely wonderful storyline. It is not just a lesbian story and is instead a story of discovery, romance and the mob. ALTO is not a shoot-in up and bloody story and instead tells it all as a romantic comedy. Frankie is in a band (ALTO) who discovers a body in the band's rental car. A mob hit. Her sister drags her to the wake and she meets Nicolette who is an openly gay woman (to everyone except her father the Don). Nicolette becomes interested and inserts herself into Frankie's life. Frankie who is happily engaged discovers she might not be as happy as she thought. She likes Nicolette and can't get her out of her head. I won't go into that more as it would be a spoiler. Now we have the mob. The FBI thinks she know something and puts her in danger when she is seen with them. Now the mob is interested. Her sister is intrigued by the mob, her father has secrets, her mother has secrets and so does her sister. Now the movie is discovery and finding out who they all are. This is treated as a comedy though, so don't forget that fact. The movie keeps you interested with the desire were it all ends. By the way, there are absolutely wonderful music performed by the actors throughout. ALL I can say, sit back and enjoy.",1442966400,5,1267,4.283333333333333

Degarmo's feistiness and acting abilities were a happy surprise and Knepp..well Knepp is amazing as usual. I've wondered if she flies under the radar on purpose because she has the presence and acting chops of a major star. And she's particularly good in this.

I'm not sure why this doesn't have an LGBT shelving here on Amazon... the lesbian romance is certainly central to the plot.  And it's certainly as crappy as most of our flicks. There were some familiar faces in the cast, so I had some high hopes for the story.  But when your blueprint is so weak and the leads lack chemistry... not much is going to save it.

This is basically about Frankie Del Vecchio (Diana DeGarmo), lead singer in a band called The Altos, who stumbles upon some criminal activity by the Italian mob.  Frankie's sister is obsessed with the popular show Mob Hit and convinces her sister they should look into things a bit more.  This leads Frankie into Nicolette Bellafusco's (Natalie Knepp) world.... hot Italian daughter of the new mafia don.

It's love at first sight for Nicolette.  Frankie, however, is very straight and has a serious boyfriend.  This doesn't stop Nicolette from pursuing her and the two eventually get something started.

Meanwhile, I was mostly wondering what the hell was going on with the other subplots... but I just couldn't bring myself to care enough to clarify or rewind. I even fell asleep during the movie and had to finish it later... it got a bit dull.  There's a load of Italian guys up to some activity, but I was never quite sure what.  In pursuit of the mob is a goofy FBI agent or two... again, not really sure what they were after or if they ever got it or just gave up or what. The backstories and threads are just kind of incomplete and disorganized.  Poor editing.

Other weirdness is that Nicolette is in love at first sight, but she acts like a total skank going after other women at the same time.  I didn't get the attraction between these two.  Seems like more should have happened between them other than... eh... magic?  I wish they'd done more than touched upon their cultural differences.  That could have given the story more depth and some legitimacy in terms of their attraction and connection. The actress who played Frankie (American Idol fame from 2004) is actually very pretty and very talented as an actress and a singer... but I'm sorry... I could only register straight species, lol. She had zero gay vibe and I wasn't buying anything between these two.  No chemistry.  Loved Frankie's sister, though... fun character.

Not the worst lez-themed movie I've ever seen... but the script killed it.  Acting, overall, was so-so.  I think they probably just forced a lot of scenes for Diana Degarmo's talent rather than focusing on a more honest story.  She'd be great in some other movies, but I don't think playing lesbian is one of her talents.  As for Natalie Knepp... come hither... :P

I think there was only kissing here.  Nothing graphic.",1440115200,23,2734,4.677148846960168
