7967362,1,B00006DXX6,"I'm wasn't sure if this movie was a joke or politically incorrect... This movie had the most preposterous story line I have ever saw.. Anytime I refer to a bad movie.. ""It a Playaz Court movie""...Anyone who has time to watch this movie! Just remember YOU WILL NEVER GET THAT 1 1/2 BACK OF YOUR LIFE..... I give it 4 thumbs down.. 2 from me and 2 from the man above....",1426118400,,368,4.197183098591549
7967363,5,B00006DXX6,"I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was well written. It is a time capsule of it's era. Tupac would've been a better selection for the lead character, but I think had passed away by this point.",1374278400,,192,4.216216216216216
7967364,3,B00006DXX6,"I love Arlen's work and I was interested in seeing his debut film, so I figured I'd buy it. Not only was it kind of sardonic and comedic when it wasn't supposed to be, this story had so many holes in it. It was entertaining to watch, but seriously, this could have been way better. The director, Greg Morgan, edited this on his laptop computer, for God's sake. I understand low-budget, but this was ultra-low-budget -- and that is saying something seeing that I watch a lot of low-budget, indie films.

As I stated before, predictable storyline, interesting ending. Sometimes you have to enjoy the B films because you get performances like the one Escarpeta gave in this. It was so great to watch him calmly take on such a challenging role of Reggie (the story's villain). If you are a fan of hood movies, then this will more than likely be a new one to pick.

You would be better off trying to find this on Netflix or if you can buy it from a third-party seller like I did, by all means do so. It is a B-film to watch either when you're bored or just need to blow time.",1318550400,,1070,4.292079207920792
7967365,1,B00006DXX6,"I have been wanting to purchase this movie for a while.
I kept hesitating to order it. Now i know why.
The whole entire movie was a real drag. It's what you would
call a low budget film. The casting, acting, and scenory was poor and
it took place in one location the gym. Also ""Sticky Fingaz"" is the
first one to die. This movie should be off the market. WACKKKKKKKKKK!!!",1269907200,,371,4.23943661971831
7967366,5,B00006DXX6,"The Playaz Court is a movie dat is off the hook, for real.  It shows u what life is really like in da hood, even how violent it can get just cuz of a bball game.  The storyline to this movie is unforgettable and the ending is off the chain.  See, there are a bunch of black guys that decide to go play some ball at the local gym.  On their way there, they come across these two gangstas who they no, and they eventually come to play to.  One of the two hoods, played by Sticky Fingaz, gets killed in the bathroom at the beginning and so the white guy they were playing bball with of course is the first to be accused of the murder cuz they had been arguing with each other the whole time.  After that, they basically just sit in the gym and have a ""court"" debating whether or not they should pop the white boy and if hes guilty.  The ending is kinda confusing, but if u mostly understand it, its the roc.  Go out and rent it and find out for urself.",1085270400,2,949,3.984126984126984
7967367,5,B00006DXX6,"Talk about some drama; This is it; When this local young thug gets killed at the local community center after shooting some hoops with his ""homies"", they insist that it is the white man that he had beef with previously on the court; Thus begins a ""kangaroo court"" with a lawyer who happens to be there as well as the people who try to piece together what happens; As time goes on and the truth comes to light, time begins to run out for all concerned; Very good drama; will keep you interested and riveted to the end;",1074556800,,517,4.285714285714286
7967368,3,B00006DXX6,"I recently saw a post on [web address] about this movie by a fellow member on the board (I am a writer as well). And I wanted to show my support and went out and bought a copy. This movie is really good. I didn't get bored like I do in a lot of films that aren't big time productions. I loved the movie, the plot, the dialogue was excellent. I would recommend this to anyone. This is how you make a movie. You don't need all the flash and cash. Great actors, great director, but above all, a great script is all you need. Wonderful movie. Looking forward to seeing more!",1040860800,2,570,4.098214285714286
7967369,1,B00006DXX6,"Minus the music, this is ""School House Rock"" for urban youth in the new millenium.  Today's lesson, I mean the film's lesson, is about the court process.  As if students from low-income schools don't have debate teams.  The characters have a mock trial on a basketball court while their cousin lies in a bathroom shot: quite realistic.  I love the way the film shows black actors of both genders and all ages.  It was cool to see Mack from ""Night Court"" and ""Set It Off"" again.  One character uses the phrases ""chicken-lickin'"" to dismiss some others and that phrase had me laughing for healthy minutes.  Still, the back cover of this movie cassette sounded far more interesting than the film actually was.  And talk about unrealistic:  a man gets shot but he has the strength to defend himself in a mock court without bleeding to death or going into shock.  This movie is dressed up as a ""New Jack"" film, but really it's a cheesy morality play.  I wonder if the ABA is using this to encourage urban youth to go to law school.",1036195200,3,1026,4.521739130434782
7967370,5,B00006DXX6,I enjoyed this movie very much. The story was very interesting and kept you involved until the end. All of the actors in this movie did an excellent job. Their characters were beleivable and interesting. You are able to understand their backgrounds very quickly. A well told story.  I highly recommend this movie. I'm very happy to have this dvd in my collection.,1034812800,3,363,4.761904761904762
