7076453,5,B00V4TU43Y,This is a very good independent gem. It is very appealing visually and has a very interesting story. It was well conceived and well put together and worth a watch.,1436745600,3,163,4.466666666666667
7076454,5,B00V4TU43Y,This is a great indie film. It's dark and weird with quality special effects. This is one of the better indie films of 2015 and it is sure to become a Classic. And it has worldwide movie streaming distribution which most indie films fail to get. Coming to Comcast Cable TV On Demand as well. I really love this movie.,1436745600,2,317,4.3
7076455,1,B00V4TU43Y,"Miska (Michaela Rexova) is a theoretical physicist in a sun dress. Her and her friend (Akay Karaazmak) travel to Cesme, Turkey where she has calculated the magnetic pull of the planets will cause a black hole phenomena. On screen it appears we are watching someone else's bad acid trip with a lousy soundtrack. A pathetic piano? Seriously?

This is supposed to be based on ""science"" and is basically the same weird science we saw in ""Interstellar"" when he was in the event horizon of a black hole and was rearranging his library both light years and decades back in time. Now exactly how this phenomenon will play out in reality, provided someone could survive in it, is a guess. This is an artsy film for people who hate acting, dialogue, and sound.

Some use of F-bomb. No sex or nudity in the first half (Sorry my FF button stuck at that point and I went to make a sandwich)

Afterwards I felt like a character in an old Cheech & Chong routine:
Kid ""Hey Hippie. Wanna buy a watch?""
Hippie: ""I'm not into time.""

Nothing like making science boring. This film made ""Primer"" look like Oscar material.",1434153600,2,1100,4.568527918781726

7076471,3,B00V4TU43Y,"I call this movie haunted beach with black hole time warp.  Watch in sections between chores.  This is a great movie that goes on forever.  Don't expect to get wrapped up by it, yet it works if you like low budget un-intrusive movies.",1459036800,,234,4.395348837209302
7076472,1,B00V4TU43Y,"I think this is the worst movie i ever seen before and this is the first time i said that. There is no story, the music is terrible and the movie is so slow is painful.",1458345600,,168,3.6944444444444446
7076473,2,B00V4TU43Y,"To summarize without providing too many spoilers, this was a movie about a Slovokian couple who go to a secluded beach somewhere near Turkey because it's going to be ground-zero for some manner of dimensional cross-rift.  How do they know this?  Because the woman draws circles on paper.  Maybe she's a physicist.  Maybe she just visits Reddit a lot.  We're never given a lot of backstory on the couple, which is one of the film's first major sins against time, space, and the audience; it never gives us any reason to identify with or care about the protagonists.

After establishing this premise, we get many attempts at artistic shots.  A few work.  Several are passable.  Many, like a strobe light on a 'spooky' tree, just seem silly, random, and mildly pretentious.  They slowly attempt to crank up the suspense, having the couple see multiple versions of one another (one version even drops a shoe - terribly spooky,) the introduction of Spooky Mask Guy in what was possibly one of the least effective jump scares I've ever witnessed (if you need a binoculars to make out the character on-screen, it's not a jump scare.)

We now enter what it supposed to be high gear.  They see zombie versions of themselves.  Their food vanishes and really apathetic people give them a ride into town.  One of (what I presume was) their mothers shows up and jumps into the sea.  Horror effects are borrowed from better films,  there's a mummy and an extra scary fashion photographer.  Why are there zombies, mummies and scary photographers in other dimensions?  Is the other dimension Hell or trademarked by George Romero?  Hard to say, really.  We're not even certain they're IN another dimension as every time things are about to get terribly spooky, the characters jolt awake, or comes to lying on the beach, or simply cuts to another scene.

This, I think, is the central flaw of this film.  Is it horror?  Science fiction suspense?  Pretentious art piece?  We don't know. Like the characters, there's no definition, motivation, or developmental arc; the movie is simply THERE and you have to either accept it or turn it off.  All things considered, I wish I'd picked the latter.",1456012800,,2174,4.808108108108108

I usually feel obligated to watch the whole movie, but couldn't make it past about 40 minutes of this one.  I'm not too picky about quirky horror/sci-fi movies because they don't usually get more than 2+ stars.  This one doesn't deserve one star, but I can't seem to post a 0 star review.",1448582400,,513,4.56043956043956

7076483,1,B00V4TU43Y,"OK, i can, and have been pretty brutal and mean-spirited in past reviews. I'm working on a kinder/gentler Deev49. But, God help me- this ranks among the top of the worst pieces of crap I've ever attempted to endure. By ""attempted"", I mean i did not make it past the first half hour and that took every ounce of my will-power.
I pride myself in the fact that I will sit through even the most miserable attempts at film making; hoping to find some redeeming quality. This one beat me. I had to bailout. Seemingly endless footage (from the viewers' point of view) of the white-line as you are driving a dark highway (watch the trailer-then play it back for 5 minutes), along with more of the same showing the sand and gravel at your feet as you run down a beach, is just two examples of the total boredom I personally experienced. It just gets worse from there......The actors do speak English, but you need bat-hearing to understand them.
 I have often watched movies that are so bad, they're good. You die-hard Sci-Fi buffs know the genre. Unfortunately, as I did not view the film in it's entirety, it may in fact posses that redeeming quality. I'll never know......it beat be!",1448064000,3,1177,4.55188679245283

That said, if this is not the worst movie I've ever watched, it has to be second by a very, very narrow margin. This ""movie"" lacks any scrap of entertainment or meaning whatsoever. If I were a movie producer, director or actor, I would never want my name and reputation to be associated with this horrific waste of time, effort and money. If its goal was to be ""esoteric,"" it failed horribly.
