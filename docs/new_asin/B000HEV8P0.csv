8139115,4,B000HEV8P0,"In what would have to be the first adult film where i stayed for the plot driven sequences, Kaylani Lei stars as Sonya Chao, a woman who undergoes a cornea transplant to regain her sight after being blind for the last five years.  Upon regaining her sight, Sonya is beset by visions that seem to be coming from the woman who was the donor for her new corneas.  Without going too much further into plot details or spoilers, i actually found it more entertaining than the Jessica Alba remake of the Korean horror classic The Eye and by a slight stretch, almost as good as the Madeleine Stowe/Aidan Quinn film ""Blink"".  Of course there is the likelihood that i am being too generous on account of how ridiculously beautiful the lead performer in this film happens to be, but if you are inclined to give something like this a try, you won't be disappointed. 5 stars for overall heat, 5 for the soundtrack, 3 and a half for the overall acting and i kind of have to take one away on account of Evan Stone looking rather gargoyle-like whenever he was on camera, so in all, i give it 4 Stars.",1262044800,4,1084,4.383084577114428
