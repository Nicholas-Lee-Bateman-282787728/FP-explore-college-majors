8611329,5,B00F1BG1SS,"Saw this on Netflix and loved it!!!! So I ordered it for my mother for Christmas since she doesn't have access to Netflix. She loves documentaries especially about animals, and this is PERFECT! So interesting!!",1418774400,,210,5.0285714285714285
8611330,3,B00F1BG1SS,The picture quality is only average and the subtitles are poorly organised. They do not come on screen at quite the right moment and frequently stay far too briefly. The sound is clear but the descriptive option does not really work. This disc is OK but not worth the full price on my view. The disc is A locked,1392768000,2,311,4.288135593220339
8611331,5,B00F1BG1SS,"I used this in my ecology class, since it was Valentines Day after all!  Students enjoyed it, asked lots of questions about animal behavior, intelligence and emotion.  Useful in class, good flow and humor, beautiful photography.",1392681600,2,228,5.305555555555555
8611332,5,B00F1BG1SS,Puts human emotional terms and descriptions into the mouths of the animals. If that's what you want it's great. I wanted that. But not sure it's what I'd teach my children.,1391904000,2,172,4.580645161290323
