3057553,5,B0010ZE19K,I gave this as a gift to my friends 3yr old...well he had to watch it 6 times in the first day. He loves the movie. Now all he talks about is the Blue Angels : ),1360022400,,161,3.3783783783783785
3057554,5,B0010ZE19K,We ordered this as a Christmas gift for my son who is 19 months and LOVES airplanes.  Couldn't ask for a better movie for him.,1356566400,,126,4.04
3057555,5,B0010ZE19K,Great kids video. Our son is fascinated by airplanes and this video is perfect for him. He loved the music and the airplanes. Wish I could buy more of these!,1339459200,,157,4.266666666666667
3057556,5,B0010ZE19K,Andy's Airplanes is an amazing animated adventure that captured the imagination of our then 5 year old son.  He had to make his own airplane out of cardboard boxes after watching Andy.  Pretty cool because we are fortunate enough to live in a community that has an annual airshow that often features the Blue Angels!  Made seeing them again all the more exciting!,1337558400,,363,4.73015873015873
3057557,5,B0010ZE19K,"Really good! kid watched it like 10 times first day. Still watches this movie very often. Not violence, not silly baby talk, educative too without being boring.",1314230400,,160,4.962962962962963
3057558,5,B0010ZE19K,My son is obsessed with this video. Daddy & I love it to because Daddy is a pilot. We are just bummed that there are no other adventures in the series as Andy promises:(!!,1309996800,,171,4.0588235294117645
3057559,5,B0010ZE19K,"I actually don't mind watching this 3 or 4 times a day with my 3 year old. He loves this, and it teaches a lot of interesting facts about the airplanes and the aircraft carrier. We actually have to listen to all the music even through the credits. The characters are a little bug-eyed, but he likes it. Where is the next DVD installment?",1220572800,2,337,4.28125
3057560,4,B0010ZE19K,My family have watched this movie three times already and my grandkids adored the characters. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone with children. Great animation and easy for kids to follow. Hope to see more stories with Andy..,1207699200,,229,4.897435897435898
3057561,5,B0010ZE19K,I'm a little biased because I was the director of production on this show but I really do think it is well done.  I also spent a fair bit of time making the DVD nice and interactive.  Yaygrr's looping animation in the menu and. . . there are even a few hidden bloopers on there!  Yay!  Those are always fun to find.,1205798400,,315,4.032258064516129
3057562,5,B0010ZE19K,"Andy's airplanes is incredible! We have two kids, 9 and 11 yrs old. They love the animation, which is like full-blown cinema, the music and the storyline. What child hasn't dreamed of flying an airplane? In fact, my husband even sits with the kids to watch; I think he's reliving his childhood dreams of flying.

The best part for us was the educational aspects of the video. We haven't seen a good educational video that was also entertaining in quite some time. Andy captures the imagination that children so often display. If your children are like ours ... they'll fall right into the story and get some education at the same time.

Sorry if this sounds salesy ... but it's true; we've been buying for family and friends. It's that good.",1197504000,3,741,4.648854961832061

He talks about it so much, so we teased him the other night and said that Andy was really him and he LOVED IT!!!!!! This little is a hit!!!! Great price and delivered on time!

8239672,5,B0010ZE19K,"I saw the whole thing on youtube.  The description ends with ""Please keep telling your friends about this great show and help us make more.""  The full episode was posted on their youtube channel back in 2011.  Their website is gone, and the facebook page only has 117 likes.  I loved watching the show and thought there would be more episodes, I was crushed when I found out that its been 6 years since they made this pilot and still no more episodes.  It's fun to watch, accurate, informative, educational, and they do an awesome job of animating.",1382400000,6,548,4.551020408163265

A very cool story for boys and girls.  If you have plane loving kids, this is one you should get them.  Wish there was Andy 2 and 3.  But alas, just this one.",1375228800,,333,4.306451612903226
