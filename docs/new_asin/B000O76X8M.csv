2791531,5,B000O76X8M,I can't believe this is not on DVD. I watched this every week when it was on tv and I can't believe they canceled it! ( Maybe it was meant to be since Adrien then went on to Heroes which I also love) I think at least to honor the viewers..PUT IT ON DVD!!!!!!I'll Be the first to place my order!!,1200960000,22,295,3.8524590163934427
2791532,5,B000O76X8M,"So many television shows out on DVD, and this one isn't yet -- I have vivid memories of scenes from the episodes -- Adrian Pasdar did a fabulous acting job.  I would buy this one the minute it was released!",1197676800,5,206,4.15
2791533,5,B000O76X8M,"UK viewers are lucky enough to have re-runs of Mysterious Ways currently showing on our SciFi Channel. I missed it first time round and only started watching this time because I had got to know Adrian Pasdar from Heroes, but he couldn't be playing a more different character in Mysterious Ways.
Declan Dunn is a joy - sweet, enthusiastic, untidy, wire-framed spectacles askew, he somehow seems to attract the strange and bizarre but faces it with courage, empathy and integrity.
I also adore the character of his assistant Miranda, a dysfunctional academic whose obsession is discovering the truth through scientific method.
This is one of those great, gentle family shows which takes a step beyond everyday reality to make us think about what is really important in life.
I can't wait for it to be released on DVD.",1185580800,28,815,4.913043478260869
2791534,5,B000O76X8M,"I absolutely LOVED this TV show and it's a darn shame they didn't give it the chance it deserved. I can not wait for this to come out on DVD - I've been waiting for years. I have most of them taped on old VHS tapes but a DVD would be so much better. This series to me was a cross between Touched by an Angel (but not so corny) and The X-Files (without the conspiracy theories and violence). It was a great show for those of us who have strong Christian faith but like a little Sci-Fi with our TV. And yes I know those things don't always go hand in hand but this show did it the best. It's a shame they didn't give it the chance it deserved because I think it would have done so much better now. The actors were great, the writing was good without being corny, and the story lines were believable.

It was a show about how some things just can't be explained by science and that yes miracles happen everyday. And God just might have a hand in it all. What a concept ... God in our lives working miracles everyday. Who would have thought? :)",1178668800,48,1040,4.073170731707317
2791555,4,B000O76X8M,"Don't judge this movie by its cover.  It looks dark and brooding.  It is not.  It is a very colorful movie of good quality (I am not a high tech person) but it appeared colorful and fun on my screen.  This movie is based on a true story.  I have shared this dvd with other home school families in my neighborhood.  As you watch it, you cheer on the main characters.  I read some negative reviews about this movie on other sites.  I am glad I purchased it anyway.  The negative reviews said that home schoolers don't have to move to the boonies and eat frogs.  I would just like to point out that this was based on a true story.  This is what one family did in real life.  The movie never states that ALL home schoolers must do what they did.  When you watch the movie, you will see why they drastically changed their lives the way they did.  You also learn that the father always wanted to live a life like they were living in the second half of the movie.",1312675200,5,956,4.125
2791556,5,B000O76X8M,"I always loved this Tv show me and my mom always used to watch them together and I still watch reruns whenever I see them on so I really hope they make a complete series DVD set. They make so many other series out there, so why not this one! I have even seen shows that only made it one season that have a copy so its possible I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",1289260800,3,358,3.9178082191780823
2791557,1,B000O76X8M,"As a Christian and a person who has home schooled, I would like to say how very disappointed I was in this movie. I think movies like this give Christians a bad reputation. I thought the boy was very disrespectful to the teacher and his Grandfather. This is not pleasing to the Lord. You can take a stand for what you believe without being rude, disrespectful or snobby. I am personally all for home schooling but I am not for treating others around you like you are so much better than them, which I feel the whole family displayed. There were many opportunities for the family to show the Love of Christ to these people, share the plan of salvation and pray for them. I did not see any of that. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1288742400,,740,4.330935251798561
2791558,5,B000O76X8M,"This was one of the best TV shows in recent memory.  In fact, a PERFECT series in my opinion: that elusive blend of top-notch acting, writing and directing that only comes along maybe a few times per decade.  We fans of this show have been waiting patiently for its DVD release, but our patience is wearing thin.  RELEASE IT NOW, PLEASE!!",1257984000,3,338,4.508196721311475
2791559,5,B000O76X8M,"My family really enjoyed this movie.  I pre-viewed it for any controversial items that we wouldn't want our children to see.  I was very pleased with the movie.  It has serious moments that are well balanced out with bits of humor.  It created several prompts for discussion in our own family with our children...standing up for what you believe in, lying (which was covered well in the special features), family relationships, socialization, and character just to name a few.

I also found it challenging for parents...how far would you go, how much discomfort are you willing to endure for your family?  I love watching how natually conflicts are resloved.  No special couseling, therapy, group sessions...just time.  Even Grandpa came around.  : )

I would reccommend this movie to anyone, homeschooling or not.",1235174400,,814,5.098484848484849
2791560,5,B000O76X8M,"I'm lucky enough to have a lot of these episodes taped on VHS, so at least I can re-watch them from time to time.  But tapes wear out and I love this show enough to pay whatever the full price of a DVD set would be, and I think a lot of others would agree.  That being said, what's the hold-up on putting it out in a digital format?  I've seen shows that were cancelled after 8 episodes that are now available on DVD.  This show lasted a lot longer and was broadcast on both the PAX network as well as on one of the major networks (CBS, I believe).  Come on guys, put out the DVD's before my tapes wear out!",1232064000,12,607,3.942622950819672
2791561,5,B000O76X8M,Mysterious Ways is one of the best series I've ever seen on TV on many years and it's really hard to believe that so far it hasn't been released on DVD for the enjoyment of its fans all over the world. I've written a couple of times to the studio requesting (in fact almost begging) them to launch it. There are a number of annoying and boring series that very soon are launched on DVD boxes while the amazing Mysterious Ways it's still waiting it's chance to come to stores. Hope they realise very soon the market opportunity they're wasting because I'm also one of the first ones to purchase it on the moment it becomes available.,1227398400,10,632,4.410256410256411
2791562,5,B000O76X8M,"If I can ever find a petition or anything that will get this show to be a DVD I'll do it! I watched it whenever it was on. It was so creative, interesting, and amazing. You can't stop watching it till the end, it's so intriguing. They need to make DVDs or both seasons!!",1219104000,7,270,4.018518518518518
2791563,3,B000O76X8M,"It is difficult to review overtly Christian movies because, while the message may be commendable, the acting and general production qualities are generally way below normal Hollywood standards.  Such is the case with this movie.  Also, I'd say the story is relatively weak here as well.  A good drama needs a serious obstacle where it is unclear if it will be overcome or not.  Of course, it is expected that there will be success.  In this movie we have a family where the young son is suspended for unwisely expressing his Christian beliefs in a school class.  One does not accomplish much for the cause of Christianity by sassing the teacher, or anyone else for that matter.  A great movie would have been if Buddy had tried to respectfully stand up for his Christian beliefs, been shut down unjustly, and fought through the legal system to force the school to allow expression of Christian beliefs as well as the pro-abortion posters.

Instead of facing their problems within the system, this family first tries to home school Buddy, then when the child protective services starts harassing them for how they are raising their children, instead of fighting for their rights through the legal system, they sell their house and take their kids out of state to live in a rural location.  I won't give away how the movie ends, but for me it was very unsettling.  Although the suggestion is that finally everything is okay, it seemed to me that they'd just successfully run away from their former problems.  But, what will they do when they have another problem to face - run away again and create a whole new life again?

One incident that needs to be pointed out is at the end of the movie, after the grandfather had talked to the new social worker.  When his daughter asked who had been at the door, he clearly lies to her about it.  To me, it is okay to depict lying in a Christian movie, but never without either some negative consequence or regret and repentance.

I would suggest that the new generation of Christian movie makers would do well to apprentice with Michael Landon Jr. or Julia Kwan (Eve & the Firehorse) to move up to expected Hollywood quality.  Also, this movie, like so many Christian movies, suffers from the use of inexperienced actors that are not trained in visually expressing appropriate emotions.  I'd suggest that no more that 10-20% of the actors should be inexperienced actors.

One quality I did like is that it doesn't overly push Christianity.  On the other hand, they seemed to make radical changes in their lives with no apparent prayer or seeking spiritual leaders to be sure they were making the changes for the right reasons. The movie is worth buying, however, to help support Christian-theme movies.  With the exception of the lie, there is nothing that would be objectionable to Protestant families",1208476800,2,2842,4.761224489795918
2791564,5,B000O76X8M,"Mysterious Ways is a wonderful movie that you can enjoy together and learn together as well. It follows a family through trials and decisions that impact their lives tremendously. It is a movie about building family relationships as well.

Provided with the DVD are questions for the whole family to discuss and some lessons in film making. What an opportunity to take a glimpse behind the scenes and the intricate details necessary to organize a movie production. The movie re-affirms beliefs, shows the works of God, understands that the family is important and highlights homeschool in a awesome light.

Watch the Christian film world for more wonderful flicks from Manny Edwards.",1207958400,,683,5.1441441441441444
8183356,1,B000O76X8M,Adrian Pasdar fans beware! The reviews for this movie create the illusion that it is the show Mysterious Ways that ran from 2000-2002. It is not! Amazon has been advised but has not yet corrected the issue.,1500076800,,206,4.594594594594595
8183357,5,B000O76X8M,We really enjoyed this movie. I don't know how we didn't know about it until recently. Not too many movies out there about homeschooling families.,1430697600,,146,4.88
8183358,5,B000O76X8M,Be careful that you don't accidently order something else named MYSTERIOUS WAYS.  I ordered what I thought were 2 seasons of the Adrian Pasdar show (which I loved! LOVED!) and got 2 movies about God moves in mysterious ways.  They may be okay-haven't watched yet-but they were NOT what I wanted.,1384646400,2,295,4.764705882352941
8183359,5,B000O76X8M,"I still remember watching this show as a kid and being so thoroughly compelled and intrigued by it. There was nothing else like it on the air then and there still isn't today. It always made a point to explore scientific explanations of odd events, but sometimes things just weren't explainable. That is still such a simple yet profound premise for a show. The nice thing about the writing was the upbeat angle on so many things, even death and fate. The endings weren't always happy, but they *did* always make you sit back and think. Sometimes, only the fun of the chase kept characters going, but even that was enough to change (or challenge) someone's perspective by the end of the episode. This show features quite a lot of philosophy as well, but it doesn't have a shred of condescension or pretentiousness. The mood is that of curious explorers, not look-down-your-nose academics. What a marvelous blend of science, theology, and mystery! In a world with a sea of depressing ""what's the point in living"" shows, here was one that dared to stand up and say ""HERE'S why! We live for THIS!"" It didn't matter that they were proven wrong sometimes. The thrill was in asking the questions, not finding all the answers.

At this point, I would even settle for a digital download version. PLEASE release this show!!!!!!",1372550400,4,1317,4.751091703056769
8183360,5,B000O76X8M,"I had never heard of Mysterious Ways when it was airing. I was also a lot younger than I am now, and probably wouldn't have watched it anyway. However, I recently started to watch some of Adrian Padar's work, and stumbled upon this show on Youtube. Let me tell you now, if you have never seen this show, you're missing out! It may be 2013, but this show doesn't lose it's quality. It's not as cheesy or dated as you'd think it would be, but something that anyone can watch at any time. It's hilarious, it's touching, it's intelligent, and it was ended all too soon. Adrian Pasdar is brilliant as Declan Dunn, and the two supporting female actresses (whose real names sadly escape me right now, but are known as Peggy and Miranda on the show) are equally as talented as the devastatingly handsome Pasdar. I can't recommend this show enough! As soon as it hits DVD, if ever, I'll be fighting the other fans to be first in line!",1357603200,,925,4.415204678362573
8183361,5,B000O76X8M,"OH MY! OH MY! I've been waiting for this show to be released FOREVER!!!! It's too bad they didn't do a few more seasons, or AT LEAST a TV movie to end the show properly. Whenever this is released I'm jumping on it. It was such a good TV show, it was carrying good messages (hope, truth, kindness, friendship etc...)it was funny, and moving and the characters were awesome. I don't understand it didn't work out!!",1345680000,3,412,4.434210526315789
8183362,5,B000O76X8M,"Please -- at least make this show available ""on demand,"" the way you did Starman. It's one of my all-time favorites. I have a feeling it would sell well.",1338854400,3,153,4.310344827586207
8183363,5,B000O76X8M,This is one TV series I recall from the past that I wish they would bring back for us to see again. To remember some of the episodes 20+ years later speaks for iteself. It was just a great show that helped you think outside the box. Please bring it back for us baby boomers and their children that really enjoyed sharing the show together as the kids were growing up.,1333756800,2,367,4.183098591549296
8183364,5,B000O76X8M,"This show originally aired on NBC before heading over to PAX TV which later became Ion Television. It lasted only two seasons but was truely a quality program and it was very sad to find out it had been cancelled. Some theorised it was because the show was not Christian enough for the audience demographic that PAX TV was aiming for with other programs such as DOC starring Billy Ray Cyrus and syndicating ""Touched By An Angel"". Ultimately, it was budget cuts to the production and plans to move the show from it's filming site in Canada to Australia and the resulting protests from both cast and crew that did the show in. For fans this was hard to take but none the less understandable considering star Adrian Pasdar had recently become a daddy and did not want to be seperated from his family to the other side of the world for several months out of the year.

The plot of this show was exciting to follow. Adrian Pasdar played Decland Dunn, a Cultural Anthropology professor at a state college. Decland had a near-death experience a few years prior to the point in the story where the show starts. This prompted a fascination with investigating reported miracles like the one he believes he experienced. Decland's friendship with Dr. Peggy Fowler, a Psychologist at the local hospital, was compared more than once to Mulder and Scully from ""The X-Files"" because Peggy would do her best to debunk the claims of miracles and paranormal phenomena that Decland had picked up on and ran with. Making this duo into a trio was an introverted, goth-girl type student at Decland's campus, Miranda, who is gifted with anything that concerns science. The trio sometimes turned into a foursome with Decland's trusted pooch, Mole.

Peggy's angle on the mind combined with Miranda's scientific knowledge gave Decland more than one approach to the claims he investigated while trying not to let his ""hobby"", as Miranda would refer to it, get him into trouble at the university and make the head honchos think he was neglecting his teaching duties. The story lines explored topics ranging from ghost activity, a woman who granted good luck to anyone she touched, a local chef who had premenitions, the sought-after shroud of a holy man that could heal any ill person that it touched, the prescence of angels and ripples in time. The pilot episode featured Adiran's wife, Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks, singing the Chirstmas time classic ""Silent Night"" and another featured Adrian's real life sister playing Decland's sister.

This show was a good combination of mystery, drama and pleanty of comedy and it is truely a shame this is still not on DVD after years of devoted fans waiting for it's release. Hopefully that will soon change with enough petition sign-ups, 5-star reviews and ""Likes"" from devoted fans like you and me. I will without hesitation buy this complete series the very day it is released.",1322956800,12,2901,4.832997987927565
8183365,5,B000O76X8M,"This is one show that needs to go to DVD. Mysterious Ways was a very defining show. I loved every moment watching it.  If they can put out shows that are truly dumb as all get out, then you can put out one that stands next to Touched by an Angel and Highway to Heaven.  You should also put out Twice in a Lifetime.  That one came on after Mysterious Ways.  That to me was a perfect night to watch those two shows.",1316044800,3,413,3.9397590361445785
