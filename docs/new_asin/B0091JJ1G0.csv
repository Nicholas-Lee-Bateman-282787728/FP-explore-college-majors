8534275,1,B0091JJ1G0,This was SO disappointing! This documentary IS NOT endorsed by anyone who knows Justin Beiber! The interviews are with people who nobody knows and most of the info presented is stuff from youtube and other media sources that have already been released. The interviews are generic and do not even directly pertain to Justin. I would return this if I could! I bought it for my niece and my family watched it on Christmas and I was SO embarrassed that I bought her such a bad gift. I ended up buying her another present to make up for such a terrible gift and we donated the DVDs to a thrift store!,1356912000,7,595,4.36936936936937
