8039414,5,B00066TBEE,Good guide for a novice camper. I haven't been camping in years and wanted a refresher course. This was a good DVD. I liked the host he was funny.,1404000000,,146,4.068965517241379
8039415,4,B00066TBEE,"This DVD holds true to its title.  The beginners guide to camping offers the most basic information for those who have never been before.  I have camped  many times before, and found this to be informative on the basics.  If your looking to go into bear country, you may want to look elsewhere. But if your looking to be filled in on the absolute basics, this may be for you...",1323475200,,377,4.3428571428571425
8039416,4,B00066TBEE,"I purchased the Beginners Guide to Camping not expecting much but it turned out to be a valuable resource.  For instance, our campsite was on a little bit of a down slope in which the top part of the slope was facing our picnic table and car.  Had we not reviewed the video we would have pitch our tent to face what we perceived to be the front but instead pitched it the opposite way so that rain would not get in the tent.  Little details such as that really make the difference between being prepared and not having to re-engineer or think through issues as they occur.  We also found the checklist to be very valuable as we were equipped to handle pretty much everything.",1254873600,,675,4.333333333333333
8039417,4,B00066TBEE,"This is a very basic video, explaining basic gear and do's and don'ts of camping. Easy to follow and brief, it is helpful for the first time camper.",1240358400,,148,4.321428571428571
8039418,5,B00066TBEE,"I just watched this camping video, downloaded the checklist,and I went on the wesite camping links you have. I wanted to tell you  this  video is perfect! It is funny and very organized. We are going to be taking our 4year old son camping this summer,and I wanted to make sure with him we are prepared. I have never went camping before,so I did not know where to start,and where to get info. This video has it all! I will reccommend this video to everyone I know. I am in Moms club and there are a lot of 1st time camper families like us. This is everything they will need to know. Camping is not a worry for me now. Thank You!

8039419,5,B00066TBEE,"I received ""The Beginner's Guide to Camping"" for Christmas along with a lot of other camping equipment. I wasn't planning on watching it until we were ready to go camping. Then I heard the kids giggling in the other room. They were watching it, so I sat down and joined them. It was very amusing, and very informative. I expecially liked the tip on keeping some of the ice in the cooler in a Ziploc bag to keep it clean for drinks. I'm sure I'll watch it again before our trip this summer, but now I actually think we're going to do it right and have a good time.",1136160000,6,563,4.174311926605505
8039420,1,B00066TBEE,"Well I bought this DVD, and I have to say when they said it was for a 'beginner' they REALLY meant it.

I have been camping maybe 2 times in my life (using tent, etc.).  Both of those times were in my youth, so I was curious as to some new techniques for camping.

This DVD did not add any new information to my already very limited knowledge about camping.  The length was very short, and the topics covered were so completely simplified their information was useless...

Their advice about ""cold weather"" camping  (Check into a hotel, sleep in your car, or wear heavy clothing in your sleeping bag!)

Their advice about ""bad weather"" camping (Put on a raincoat and play frisbee! Go to a movie in a nearby town!)

They covered important topics...Describing the intricate composition of ""Smores"" (Gram-Cracker + Chocolate + Marshmellow).

Seriously people... If you have an IQ over 75 there is not a single idea in here that you already do not know, or could find-out in a very simple search online or speaking to someone at a camping store.

Do not waste your money on this DVD.",1135209600,7,1079,4.572916666666667
8039421,5,B00066TBEE,I have never been camping before and always wanted to try it but don't really know how.  This DVD really helped me figure out where to start and I think we're going to try it this summer.  It is also very funny and entertaining.  The tips and tricks were great.,1107820800,3,261,4.18
