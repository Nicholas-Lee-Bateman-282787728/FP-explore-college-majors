8543232,4,B009NRQU3C,"Full disclosure  I love everything about Ireland, so I am bias. I like the programs, they are bite short, but over all well done. They give you a belief undering of Irish culture during mid-evil times. If you want some good Irish history look to this series to Bbc Story of Ireland. I wish they made more stuff on Ireland.",1427414400,2,322,4.366666666666666
