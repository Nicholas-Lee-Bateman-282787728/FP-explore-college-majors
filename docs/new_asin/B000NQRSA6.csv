2780300,4,B000NQRSA6,"This salsa/exercise video was very difficult.  Not exactly in terms of intensity (although it is very fast-paced) but there wasn't proper instruction.  I spent more time trying to learn the steps than actually exercising.  I have taken salsa for about 2 years, and I would call myself a high beginner.  I am a little rusty, but usually I can pick up steps pretty quickly with proper instruction.
These were the problems that I had with the video.
1.  The explanation of steps video's were very hard to follow.  She didn't really explain steps, or what leg to use.  I had to watch cha-cha about 5 times before I could somewhat do the steps.  It would have helped tremendously if she had counted out the steps for this segment, and explained which foot to use and which way to turn.  After going ahead and doing the cha-cha segment, I will still need to go back and watch the explanation to steps.  The arm movements were difficult as well because she didn't even mention what to do with them.

2.  The warm up was a mess! It was really faced paced, so much so that it was hard to even pick up any of the more complicated movements.  At one point I just started to modify what she was doing in order to continue on.  I will probably have to ""practice"" the warm up many times before I can understand it and do it properly.  Again there was no communication, just music that she may or may not be dancing to herself.

3.  What I did not understand about the dance segment itself was that it is clear that she is giving directions and cues, but the music was playing over her.  Please let me know if anyone has found a way to hear her voice???  Even though I had somewhat figured out the steps by the time I put on the Cha-Cha segment, her cues were almost impossible to read.  Again I had to replay the video a few times, and still had trouble.  The energy level was not difficult.

4.  Finally I would suggest not to go barefoot or with sneakers when dancing to this video, it is very hard to swivel, turn and slide.  I would suggest ballet slippers or jazz shoes.

For all my complaints, I still enjoyed this video once I got the hang of it, and will enjoy it more once I can completely do all the movements at the right time.  I would say that exercise should be a secondary motive for purchasing this dvd, and that building up body memory should be the primary reason.",1228780800,4,2368,4.312925170068027
2780301,5,B000NQRSA6,"If this DVD doesn't get you up off the couch and into a regular exercise routine - nothing will! I actually look forward to doing this every day. This is not for wimps - plan to work out and work out hard! It's a fun and addictive way to lose those extra pounds and tone yourself up. Your outcome will depend on your level of input, so the more you ""work it"" the better the results. Denise is a breath of fresh air. She really knows her stuff and you feel GREAT accomplishment after learning the steps and  keeping up with her throughout each routine. (They may seem hard at first, but she breaks each dance number down so you can follow along. Keep with it - you will get them.) Warm ups and cool downs included. Cha-Cha and Merenge are my favorites, but truly, they are ALL good! The best DVD purchase I've ever made! Thank you, Denise!",1223078400,,838,4.270440251572327
2780302,5,B000NQRSA6,"I've been using this DVD for the past three months and I still haven't gotten bored. The dance routines are relatively challenging and you might stumble through them a couple of times before you've really got them down. (However, once you've perfected one of them, the rest will be easier.) Make sure to watch the tutorials before you start. Even the warm-up's more challenging than most low-impact aerobic videos. (The cool-down always feels awkward to me and instead of doing the yoga movements, I usually just do some other forms of stretching.) The different styles of dance work for whatever mood you're in at the moment. High energy? Try the salsa or cha-cha. Don't really feel like getting up off the couch? Try the rhumba. This DVD's flexible and accessible.",1208304000,5,766,4.9
2780303,2,B000NQRSA6,"First the good-I like her teaching style.  You learn a move and a new one is added on until you have a whole routine.
The bad-The warm up is way too fast for a warm up.  The cool down has yoga moves in it which are not appropriate for this video.
Finally, each dance routine starts with the same warm up and ends with the same cool down and I always have to fast forward thru each one to continue dancing at the aerobic pace until I am ready to cool down.",1208131200,2,455,3.9347826086956523
2780304,4,B000NQRSA6,"This was the first DVD I've ever tried that was actually dance.  I've done workouts that were dance STYLE, but I really feel like I'm learning new dances here.

I watched the ""how-to"" on the steps when I first got this DVD a month or so ago, and it intimidated me so much that I haven't even tried doing any part of the dancing, until today.  It's a great workout!  I'm only learning one dance until I get it down, then I'm moving on to the next dance.  I love it!  This is exactly the type of thing I need to keep me motivated to exercise, because I get to learn how to do something I've never done, I get to dance (which I love to do), and I can always improve on my own personal style.

This is difficult and definitely not for the faint-hearted beginner.  But if you're up for a challenge and willing to look really silly for a while until you catch on, go for it!",1206662400,2,868,4.064705882352941
2780305,3,B000NQRSA6,"If you're just starting out with your fitness goals, you may want to try something a bit less challenging.",1202860800,4,106,4.631578947368421
2780306,5,B000NQRSA6,"There's so many things I like about this DVD. I like that the instruction is separate, so you can just focus on the workout. To me, that saves a lot of time because you don't have to slow down for each change (and after you've seen a DVD 3 or 4 times, that becomes annoying).

The pace is definitely fast. I would rate it at intermediate rather than advanced because it's low-impact. I'm not in the best of shape myself, but I've found that if you need to slow down, you can just step-touch until you're ready to jump back in.

The music has an authentic sound (versus the classic canned-and-bland aerobic studio tracks) with a heavy drumbeat that's easy to follow. I like the enthusiasm of Lisa and her dancers, but I'll agree with other reviewers that you have to stay focused and concentrate in order to keep up.

If you're in reasonably good aerobic shape, can focus well for longer periods of time (say, 20 minutes versus 10), and can follow dance steps without getting too lost, you'll enjoy this DVD. This is NOT for you if you're very out of shape and haven't exercised in a long while, if you like a mellow workout where you can 'zone out' a bit from time to time, or if you find dancing a bit challenging to begin with.

All in all, a new favorite of mine.",1201305600,14,1266,4.329113924050633
2780307,4,B000NQRSA6,"Well, if you like to dance this might be a fun one to try.  I have Lisa's other two Salsa videos and they are in weekly rotation at my house.  The 5 day latin dance system is another great addition to her other videos.  She teaches you dance routines in the same building-block style, starting at full tempo, with the instruction segments always included on a separate portion of the disk.  This I like very much.  I can learn the routine in the instruction segment, but once I have it I'm not slowed down with having to go slowly through the first steps when all I really want is my work out.  The cool down and warmup are the same in all 5 segments, which is fine.  The warm up is good, if not extremly fast paced.  I wasn't crazy about the stretch afterward, just because I felt it was a little awkward to do a hamstring stretch and then go into a down dog (from yoga).  This I feel is much safer to do with a sticky mat and when you are in the proper alignment.  Other than that I really enjoyed the video.  My favorite segments were the Cha-cha and Salsa, which were the most fast-paced.  The Rhumba section is much slower and that one I would probably do in combination with a fast-paced segment on a a easier work out day.

I find Lisa's cuing is excellent, as are her dancers, who have shown up on other videos of hers.  The set is minimal and the music is good.  Lisa's form is what you can expect from a world-champion dancer and even after you master the moves you can look to Lisa and her dancers for the best alignment and really start to perfect your form. I enjoy making my own work-out combinations or practicing all the segments together in the extras section.

If you enjoy your cardio with a little Latin flair, give it a go, it is fun and before you know it your workout is done!",1199664000,21,1799,4.216374269005848
2780308,5,B000NQRSA6,The is a fun and effective workout.  I use it everyday now for 2 weeks.  I fully enjoy it.  The instruction is good and well organized.  You can view only the instruction part then go to the dance/exercise part.  I really think it is well worth the $15.,1196121600,5,253,4.1875
2780309,4,B000NQRSA6,"Level = advanced
style = USA aerobics with some latin styling.

This is more like a very long exercise class. Very few cues. You would have to watch the screen all the time.

There is no instruction on the steps during the sections except at the steps explained section.

It is a very good exercise dvd. At over 2 hours it is great value for money.
I did find some of the steps boring esp the non latin steps.

I did not really enjoy the warm ups or cool down sections. I thought these could have be better done.

I did not like how the dvd was divided into sections as I would of liked to skip the warm up sections.

But overall it is an enjoyable exercise dvd.",1192147200,18,662,4.093023255813954

8181097,2,B000NQRSA6,Very difficult to follow along the dance routines unless you already know the dances. I have had this a while and it is collecting dust. Truly disappointed as I love to dance and was hoping this would teach me some Latin moves.,1442707200,,227,4.428571428571429
8181098,5,B000NQRSA6,"In a sea of 'dance fitness' dvd's, this is the best I've found. Lisa's energy is
infectious- the workout flew by because i was actually having FUN. I liked
everything about this program, including the music.

Best of all, this great cardio routine helped me drop 10 pounds in the first
month. Try it...Well worth the price.",1399593600,,323,4.666666666666667

8181101,1,B000NQRSA6,The quality of this DVD is pretty bad. Don't buy! I am very disappointed as i have been waiting for the DVD to arrive to try on the dance. Extremely upset with this,1349654400,,164,4.0
8181102,5,B000NQRSA6,"I really like this DVD!  The music is just okay, but the rest is excellent.  My money was well spent on this purchase.

I have not had any experience at dancing, and so I wondered how I would do with this DVD.  I just awkwardly danced along with the instructional part a few times (not really getting a lot of it), and then once a week I kept dancing along with Lisa for the regular dances.  It is all done at full speed ahead (good aerobically), and although I was somewhat frustrated at times, I eventually ""got it"" on each dance.  Each time I did the video, I definitely could see improvement, and that made it really exciting.  I thought that while I was learning, it was still time well spent; after all, I was exercising and not sitting on the couch!  The time FLEW by, and I thought it was the most fun I have ever had exercising.  It is especially fun now that I have learned all the dances.

The best part of this DVD is that once you learn all the dances and are pretty comfortable with them, there is a selection for about 18 minutes of reviewing all the dances you have learned, one right after another without all the incremental instructions.  I repeat this twice and have a ball.  I think this DVD will make me feel comfortable dancing with Latin music in other situations, too, but I have not had that opportunity yet.  It feels lovely to move your hips!

This is the easiest workout I do all week, but I know it is doing some good and using some different muscles than the rest of the week.  I think it has been challenging mentally, too, to learn something new.  Doing this DVD is my Saturday reward for working out much harder the rest of the week with light weights and calisthenics on two days, jogging 2-3 miles two days a week, and walking hills on my treadmill once a week.",1338595200,,1797,4.287833827893175
8181103,1,B000NQRSA6,"There is an explanation section for each dance but it is too fast pace to grasp and not enough details are given for your moves.  If you already know the dance moves, then you may already be in shape and won't need the video.

I now own a disc that won't do me any good.",1327795200,,270,3.890909090909091
8181104,5,B000NQRSA6,"Dance with Lisa: 5 Day Latin Dance System is composed of 5 different Latin dance workouts lasting about 20 minutes each.  They are a lot of fun, and the difference of styles keeps the viewer from getting bored easily.  Lisa Nunziella leads it, and she teaches the routines very quickly by first doing the move with you twice before throwing it into the combo of dance steps already learned and taking it from the top.  If this is way too fast for you, though, don't despair, for also included on the DVD is a breakdown segment where Lisa will show you every dance move of a certain combo half time, and there is one of these for every routine.  Also, there is a place that has you do all routines 2 times each in what is called the ""Add Your Own Style"" segment.  Now, for a breakdown of each routine:

Warm Up - The same warm up is used for all routines at the beginning of them, and it lasts about 5 minutes.  This will set the speed for the rest of the routines as it is FAST.  She will just start with a really fast step touch and never slow down after that.  Also, she will just throw moves at you with no explanation (and there is no breakdown for this segment) but by the end of this warm-up, whether you conquered all the steps or not, you will definitely be sufficiently warm.

Cha-Cha - This entire routine pretty much is based on the 1-2-cha-cha-cha rhythm, and if you've ever done cha-cha before it should come pretty easily.  It's an intermediate/advanced section that is a lot of fun to do.  Lisa doesn't usually call each move it's proper name, but she rather calls it a ""turn step"" or a ""rock step"" so that can be kind of strange, but overall this routine is a lot of fun with a great rhythm.

Salsa - This is definitely the most challenging section of them all, but I also found it to be the most fun.  The moves are extremely complex, making this an advanced routine, but they are really fun and unique to do.  You may recognize some moves from Lisa's earlier salsa DVDs, but they are mostly new moves and a lot of fun!

Merengue - This routine was the most basic routine as pretty much the entire combo was just one step that had many variations.  It was definitely a beginner/intermediate workout that was really easy to do.  It had a few steps that were quite quick, but it was mostly just marching to the side, forward, or back.  It still managed to be a lot of fun, though, and I enjoyed it.

Samba - This is a routine that isn't necessarily composed of challenging moves, but the moves are very technical and sometimes difficult to perform well.  Also, Lisa doesn't mention anything about having a bounce throughout the routine, which is something vital to any Samba routine.  This was my least favorite routine, as it wasn't that interesting to me because I had seen most of the moves before in other DVDs.  It's about an intermediate difficulty, but remember that the moves are slightly hard to pull off.

Rhumba - This was a really fun section as it's unlike most dance routines in workouts today.  Although this section wasn't very cardio, the moves were a lot of fun to pull off, and I thoroughly enjoyed the smoothness of the combo.  Even though it didn't raise the heart rate as much as the other routines, it was still about an intermediate difficulty as some of the moves had twists and slides in them.  This was a really fun section; it just wasn't that great of a workout.

Cool Down - Like the warm up, the cool down is the same for all of workouts.  It will start with some of the moves featured in the warm up before moving to some great stretches for the body.  There are modifications that one of the background dancers does, and there is also a yoga pose in the cool down, as well.  This was also about 5 minutes long.

The routines can, of course, be put together if you are in the mood for a longer workout; you just have to be willing to skip the cool down at the end of the first routine and the warm up in the second routine.  Also included on the DVD are a blooper reel and a music advertisement.  Overall, I gave this workout 5 stars because it is a lot of fun to an intermediate/advanced exerciser/dancer as long as they are willing to learn the steps.  And if the viewer doesn't like one of the routines, there are four more, which makes this DVD well worth the price.  It's a great buy for Latin dance lovers everywhere!",1277510400,,4370,4.332103321033211
8181105,4,B000NQRSA6,"Dance with Lisa is a great workout video. I bought the intermediate version and I think it may be a little difficult for people who have never tried Latin dancing. The down part is she teaches the steps very quickly and she doesn't go over transitioning from one step to the next but if you have a rewind button you'll be fine. Other than that the dances are really fun and up beat, the variety never lets you get bored. But most importantly after going through one of the dances you will feel like you had a really good work out without feeling exhausted and you'll have fun doing it. I personally love it!!!",1243036800,,609,4.350877192982456
