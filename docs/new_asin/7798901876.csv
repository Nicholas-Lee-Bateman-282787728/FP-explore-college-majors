1117263,4,7798901876,"Yoon Eun-hye is a hardworking, comical, enchanting actress,  She creates new characters and makes it seem like she is just breathing them into being.  One suspects it is more difficult than she makes it look.  In this drama she is a riot.  Compare that w/ her I Miss You or Coffee Prince & one will doubt that it is the same actress.  She even manages to make her lackluster costar seem smart & sexy in her reflected sparkle.  The best advice for Lie To Me viewers, is to just sit back & let her carry you to the funny place her character creates~enjoy!",1379548800,,553,4.320388349514563
1117264,5,7798901876,"Found this randomly on the hooloo and very much enjoyed it.

K-dramas are good for binge watching because they never resolve in between episodes, but end for good after about 20 episodes.

There's a love it/ hate' it response to this show, so it should help you love to explain up front that :

-the first half is the fun tornado of circumstances foundational to the story, and the last half finally funnels to the two leads' relationship in a less ""drama""-ish and more of a serious, realistic way.

-the two leads have a tremendous, self-sacrificing sense of responsibility and duty that westerners might not understand and cause them to give up on the story prematurely.

The quality of the series overall is fantastic but best summed up by someone else's review that remarks that the chemistry between the leads is so strong you're willing to forgive the plot/writing issues in order to see what happens at the end. It's worth it, and you root for them the whole way.

Yoon Eun Hye character, Gong Ah Jung, is the character best fitted for her. She is gorgeous, funny and soo lovable. I loved her in Goong (Palace or Princess Hours whatever you know it as) but adored her in this new series. Not to mention Kang Ji Hwan, (SQUEELS!) who is sooooooooooo HANDSOME! I first saw him in Be Strong Geum Soon, which by the way loved it, and fell in love with him again after seeing him as Hyun Gi Joon. I wish I had a husband like that ;). I have seen this 5 times already and I never get bored of it! The chemistry between these two is so adorable that I wouldn't be surprised if they starting dating in real life but that is wishing thinking. Lie to Me is my number 1 romance/comedy series on my list and is A MUST recommeneded that you will not regret buying it. I give this a 20-star rating.

1117361,5,7798901876,"A 30-ish and single civil servant named Gong Ah Jung (who may or may not have a slight alcohol intolerance issue) tries to convince her ""friend"" and arch nemesis Yoo So-Ran that she is actually married. Yoo So-Ran (who has since stolen and married said civil servant's former boyfriend Chun Jae-Beom) automatically assumes that the civil servant's husband is no other than the affluent hotel president and conveniently single Hyun Ki Joon whom Gong Ah Jung has actually never met.
Gong Ah Jung inevitably runs into Hyun Ki Joon and soon manages to persuade him that pretending to be married to each other would be mutually beneficial. To make things complicated Hyun Ki Joon's brother and his former fiancee arrive on the scene with romantic designs on Ah Jung and Ki Joon respectively. And that is just a taste!

Lie to Me is actually my first Korean drama and I really enjoyed the unique storyline from American dramas as well as the glimpse into South Korean language and culture. All the main characters are dynamic and develop as the series goes along. The drama content is high and some of the situations are incredibly ridiculous but entertaining and manage to keep one's attention. Highly recommended.",1344038400,,1209,4.897560975609756

1117367,5,7798901876,"My daughter introduced me to this series, I was initially sceptical but went on to enjoy this throughly. What was most striking was the unusual story line, which was as funny as it was comical. The two lead characters were very well matched and both gave a delightful performance, the supporting cast did not dissappoint. The important life lesson here being -""what a tangle web we weave when first we choose to deceive""- this was very aptly depicted in Lie to me. To untangle the web of lies required humility and in this case a healthy dose of love and affection. It helped that in the course of the pretence and lies, cupid's arrow had made its mark on the two and this made for a very entertaining series. If you love Korean dramas, this is one for the keeper shelf.",1336262400,,770,4.468085106382978
1117368,4,7798901876,"To be perfectly honest, the first time I started watching this Kdrama, I didn't get beyond the bee scene...After watching Yoon Eun Hye in Goong and Coffee Prince, I decided to try it again.  Glad I did.  It's become one of my favorite lite entertainment dvds.  There is a lot of chemistry between Yoon Eun Hye and Kang Ji Hwan, and the soundtrack has a couple of great tunes on it.  Of course the Cola kiss scene is great, in fact this kdrama really bends the staid boundaries on kissing on screen.  Its a nice change, without it getting overdone.  The supporting cast was great, and the story silly but showed how lies, jealousy, avarice, and greed all lead to a slippery slope if you aren't careful.  I think it was nicely done for the genre and plan to watch it again soon.",1335744000,,776,4.384615384615385

Its an adorable show that will make you laugh, cry, (squee), and just about rev up all the other emotions in between. I found myself cheering for the main actors. I've cried and laughed so many times that I lost count. I found myself saying ""JUST KISS ALREADY!"" several times also. I absolutely adore this show. The actors are super talented (and very good-looking). I disagree with some of the other comments that stated that towards the end it slows down. I think it stays awesome and at a level pace throughout the entire series. The plot is beautiful all the way to the last episode. *POTENTIAL SPOILER* The ending is beautiful in my opinion. I will definitely buy this.",1333843200,3,794,4.598591549295775
1117411,4,7798901876,"if you've never seen Korean romantic comedy TV - you will almost certainly watch this 16 episode series with pleasure - you've been down this genre before in western rom-coms - but the scenery is fresh - with attractive talented asian actors - including the adorable Yun Eun Hye in the central role - with the bright colors of Seoul Korea - and Jeju Island just off the country's southern coast

for those familiar with the Korean genre - this recycles almost everything - inspiring a witty line of dialog - ""you watch too many dramas""

there's the quadrangle - a severe young CEO - a younger affable brother - an old flame - and a middle class girl at the heart of it all - add to that is the usual ajumma who controls the company - and therefore thinks she must control everyone else - and there's the Korean quota of weeping

while i enjoyed the first half - i thought the conflicts that motivated the later episodes were flimsy - but a certain amount of momentum carried me thru to the end

still -

its genre - so its comfortably familiar

its Korean - so its nice looking

it has the eminently watchable Yun Eun Hye - so it gets an extra star from me

1117412,1,7798901876,"The lead actors are great and do their best to make the show work, but even their palpable chemistry can't float this leaden boat.

The first few episodes are great and set a quick and lively tone of what happens when a little lie becomes a big misunderstanding and both sides feel aggrieved.  Lie to Me starts out so well that it makes the sudden downfall into a complete muck of a plotless mishmash even sadder.

Yoon Eun Hye is stellar in the deservedly popular 1st Shop of the Coffee Prince.  Kang Ji Hwan is great in Hong Gil Dong.  Watch those instead and pass on this one.",1333065600,3,579,4.324074074074074
1117413,4,7798901876,"This was such an adorable series.  As with most KDramas, the storyline frayed a bit towards the end.

These two lead characters create an amazing chemistry and comedic balance that really just propels this series past ordinary.  It was so enjoyable to watch how these two lives slowly changed due to one little slip up.

As far as favorites, for KDramas, this would be in my top 10 or so. For those of you who like romantic comedy, I would recommend this one and several others.  Yoon Eun Hye is fantastic also in Palace and First Shop of Coffee Prince.  (Save First Shop for the last, because it's her best)

Enjoy!",1332806400,6,616,4.495495495495495
1117414,5,7798901876,"""This series had everything including the young woman holds a government job. She seems really ditsy, but she is quite brilliant at what she does, well, until she decideds to tell a huge lie to a woman who stole the love of her life. I say, thank goodness she did. What developes and unfolds is far better than the lawyer, former boyfriend. He changes in the series too. The wealthy business man she draws into her lie, gorgeous and he knows it. Arrogant and he knows it. A good heart he wants nobody to know about. Vulnerable which he hides. This is a sweet story. A single dad who raised a really good daughter wanting to make her dad proud of her. It also shows what can happen when politics mix into ones personal life. Quick false judgements. I think you will like this one too. I would say my favorite part of the series starts with the new use for Coca Cola....whoa, really great!",1330300800,,887,4.381818181818182
1117415,3,7798901876,"One reviewer's comment ""cute but not much else"" sums it up. If it had gone the all-out comedy route, like Seinfeld - a lie leads to another lie, clueless side-characters propagate the confusions even further and things go out of control - it would have been great. Instead after the promising initial setup, it just goes the same-old-Korean-soap route: persistent and manipulative old flame comes back from a foreign country (at least it is not US this time. It is France!), a disapproving mother figure intervenes, so on and so forth. There is not much development in sub-plots and side-characters either.

The actors are all attractive, especially Yun Un-Hye, and it could have been a whole lot better but instead it just feels like yet another recycled story. Unless you are a die-hard fan of melodrama and/or these actors, it gets old after a while.",1327363200,2,853,4.882758620689655
1117416,3,7798901876,"The story starts with Ah-jung running into an old frenemy, So-ran. So-ran married the man that Ah-jung considers her first love. So-ran did so knowingly and upon seeing Ah-jung again, after three years, rubs it in her face. Ah-jung to save face pretends she is married.  It snowballs however because she is later seen with Ki-joon and the insane gossip mill in this show marries her to him.

Eventually the pair draw up a contract to maintain the appearance of a marriage for a month.

Ki-joon has no idea how attracted to Ah-jung he is, it is pretty cute to watch. He has a great support staff too.(Two totally under-developed characters in this drama, me thinks, his secretary and a female bestfriend/ CEO of his company.)

Hijinks ensue.

This drama has a few things going for it.

Yoon Eun Hye is always so much fun to watch.  It was nice to see her in a role as a mature woman and not the girl of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Palace/dp/B000XPRMD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Palace</a>&nbsp;or the gender-bender in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-1st-Shop-of-Coffee-Prince/dp/B0011Z1T4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 1st Shop of Coffee Prince</a>.  She reminds me of Sarah Michelle Gellar in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0046XG48O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Series</a>.  Both women are so great at pulling the audience into feeling what their characters are feeling. Plus there is some wonderful physical acting going on in this show (though Yoon's has been toned down a bit compared to some of her other antics).

This is my first time seeing Kang Ji-hwan in anything, however, I'm hoping it isn't the last. I really enjoyed him. His character was all over the place, as the stuff upper lip businessman and the smitten lover.

The chemistry between these two leads was amazing and the story pretty much road on the coattails of that chemistry. (which I am mostly okay with).  There were times when smoke might have been coming out of my screen. This drama is worth watching for the awesome 'cola-kiss,' if nothing else. It is a moment that goes from totally cute and funny to serious and steamy, not to mention the camera work and direction in that scene are great.

The drama also has some great secondary characters. It has one of the best father-daughter relationships I've seen in a K-drama. The younger brother, Sang-hee, is pretty fun to watch in his earlier scenes and then gets sort of dragged down into melo-drama land, but it was nice to see him growing up a bit.

Unfortunately the story just sort of looses itself towards the end and characters have all sorts of reversals just to inject some ""Dramatic tension"" into the whole thing. Really, if they  had just had cute frolicky dates I would have been a happy viewer. Instead the writers watered down the quality of the whole show with how they handled how to wrap things up. The tried and true: ""I love you but I can't marry you...yet. I need to go far away and think and be tortured for a few episodes.""

I didn't hate it, and parts of it are really worth rewatching, the middle few episodes where they are happily dating after the lie is exposed and before DRAMA happens. It could have been leaps and bounds better, considering how enjoyable seeing these two leads were I can't imagine how addicting the show could have been if it had been better written and plotted. (I am thinking something along the lines of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Greatest-Love/dp/B005XO3B7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Greatest Love</a>.",1327276800,20,3766,5.478411053540587
