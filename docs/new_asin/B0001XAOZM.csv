8017668,3,B0001XAOZM,"For those who enjoy Antonio Aguilar and his old-style movies, this is a very good movie, overall.  Of course, it's got more in common with the moivews of Roy Rogers in many ways than with Sam Pecinpah's ""The Wild Bunch,"" but there is still much more edge than in anything by Roy and DAle.  You'll see him shoot a hole in the deck of cards before sitting at the table so that nothing can appear from anyone's sleeve without him knowing it.  You'll see him at full assault on an armed hacienda with a machete in each hand when bullets are exhausted.  You'll see, as usual with Aguilar, horses more beautiful than any human being and incredibly well-trained.  (You know, Roy Roger's Trigger came from the border and was almost certainly related to all that Mexican stock you see in Aguilar's movies.) You'll also see some beautiful women doing a more-than-passable job of acting.  These people are stars indeed with great talent! Aguilar also clearly protrays both Juan and his father in the movie, which is kind of fun to watch. There are, however, no subtitles in any language and not evenb closed captioning.  If you think ""Dubbed"" has anything to do with a possible English language option, forget it!  These things are not there nor advertised on the case.  About half-way through the movie there is a regrettable scratch on the negative that appears on the left of the screen (not in mid-screen, thank goodness) for a long, long time, somewhat marring some marvelous, portratit-like scenes.  Some of the long-shots in this moview are indeed worthy of the term ""art"" and are very beautful indeed.  Be prepared for some canned sound effects of horse whinnies, as you'd find in other movies of the era, but also some spectacular horse stunts in the battle scenes.  Though I was hoping for subtitles in either Spanish or English and an English dubbing option that didn't exist, I nonetheless enjoyed the movie a lot.  You can definitely see why Aguilar is such a movie legend.  Like all such idols, the camera loved him.  Do NOT, however, purchase this for the hearing-impaired.  There are no subtitles nor closed-caption options. THE MOVIE IS ACTUALLY IN COLOR, however, though even the case seems to mislead in this aspect if ""B/n"" means Blanco/negro (B/W).  Also, the audio is digitally remastered.",1190332800,,2300,4.811704834605598
