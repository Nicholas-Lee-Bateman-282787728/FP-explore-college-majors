8337068,4,B001R10BKU,"This double sided DVD from Lionsgate has two Mauricio Garces films. The late Garces was a famous character actor in Mexico. He found fame after playing silly Don Juan/womanizer characters. Garces played a wisecracking lawyer in Despedida De Casada(1968).

Fray Don Juan(1970): Garces plays a womanizer and a Roman Catholic priest who share the same soul. Norma Lazareno co-stars.

Modisto De Senoras(1969): Garces plays D'Maurice, a fashion designer who pretends he's a homosexual so he can score with sexy women. He's almost killed after sleeping with a married woman! Irma Lozano plays the film's only wholesome, cute, hardworking female lead. Parts of the film were shot in a Denny's restaurant. The jazzy-bossa nova music score by Gustavo Cesar Carrion gives the film a 1960's cool! Zulma Faiad, Patricia Aspillaga, and Claudia Islas play the sensual women who are attracted to D' Maurice. In this print, there's footage of a pond that plays for two seconds over Garces and Islas, for some odd reason.
Modisto De Senoras is old fashioned and politically-incorrect, but it is fun to watch.

Garces played womanizers, but he also made them look cool. Garces played a womanizer in Perdoname Mi Vida(1965). These movies are worth watching if you like Mexican cinema.",1350604800,3,1266,5.1658536585365855
