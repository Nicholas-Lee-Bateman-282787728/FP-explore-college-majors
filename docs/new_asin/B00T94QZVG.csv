Also liked "" It's a celebration Bitches!"" & ""The girl has gone KA Razzzy"". The cast was great, good to see some different actor's that I like, getting tired of the same ones all the time.

7003042,3,B00T94QZVG,"Three women kidnap their ex-boyfriends and demand answers for closure. Brea (Tomiko Fraser) discusses the incident on an on-line talk show along with the fruits, nuts, and vegetables that chime in. The film cycles from superficial humor to mock relationship drama, clearly a movie for her and that relationship thing which women talk about in such abstract language, that men cower in confusion.

Guide:F-bomb, no nudity.",1431129600,,421,5.378787878787879
7003043,5,B00T94QZVG,"Well, other than seeing LEON, I wasn't expecting much but got a lot of enjoyment from this comedy!
I watched it with two of my girls and we had a hoot! Leon was great as always and so was the rest of the good looking cast.
It was almost like two movies in one with the online chat room. Chris Spencer should have Leon on BET's Hollywood House Husbands, he's funny!! Nice to see Shari Headley, see looks great!",1430611200,,409,4.189873417721519
