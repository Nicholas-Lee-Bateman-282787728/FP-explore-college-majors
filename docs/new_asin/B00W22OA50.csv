8711869,5,B00W22OA50,"This is a very nice new transfer of the acclaimed 1970/71 Roller Derby documentary.  I should add that the product is a DVD-R, as opposed to a DVD.  The image is clearer than previous transfers.  I believe that the film was shot in 16MM originally.  If true, a transfer to home video will never resemble GONE WITH THE WIND.

The film contrasts Roller Derby life with the aspirations of Mike Snell, a young would-be skater who hopes to join the league.  In this new transfer, scenes that were previously quite dark are now much clearer.  For example, the viewer gets a clearer view of the Snell basement, in which Mike's younger brother Butch lounges around reading Playboy magazines.  Why is that desirable?  Well, there are some really cool vintage posters on the walls, which were barely discernible before.

For those more interested in the skating than the Snells, this new transfer improves the color values as much as possible.  The uniforms of the San Francisco Bay Bombers, Northwest Cardinals, Northeast Braves, and Midwest Pioneers are brighter here, providing plenty of nostalgia for those who watched the Derby telecasts way back when.

The film is presented in full-frame, as it was originally photographed.",1434067200,,1220,4.985148514851486

8711871,5,B00W22OA50,"YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS TO BELIEVE IT, since those skaters don't wear football gear or any real kind of protection against hit after hit around a track but they keep on going, and maybe that's the power of this sport unlike any other, a truly All American sport since it was invented by a man named Leo Seltzer from Portland Oregon, who took his idea and family to Chicago in the 30's, not a great time for a start-up of any kind, and parlayed a love of motion and people and action into a sport that has remained an international sensation.  This was the first documentary William Richert and Derby scion and impresario Jerry Seltzer made together.  The second film was on the world of the American Ballet Theater School in Manhattan -- and there are similarities in the artists in both.  Jerry Seltzer I think took an extraordinary gamble on the movie DERBY, as he was not only the sport's owner, but the executive producer of the documentary which some thought cast the Derby skaters as ruffians, and Mike Snell the ostensible anti-hero in the ""cinema verite"" film (say before ""reality"" films there was ""verite"" films) was an obvious outsider-insider married-woman-chaser -- but the confines of his day job in a factory, and his dreams of skating in California, make for a rich story even today, even if his dream never brought him riches -- and it ought to be noted that this is the only remaining footage of the sport taken before 1973, when the television stations erased the Roller Derby tapes.  But nobody could ever erase the memories of these skaters and this movie.  Totally enthralled with ""Derby - The Producer's Cut.""",1430784000,,1628,4.678321678321678
