No wonder a DVD version is many times more expensive than the VHS tape. That said, I must also say that in The Night of the Shooting Stars the Taviani brothers' gave us one of the best films in Italy's cinematic history. A beautifully humane presentation of Italy's terrible ordeal whenMussolini had fallen, Fascists were retreating, and the allies were pushing  the Nazi forces northward along the Italian boot. Though the film includes the gunfire and counterfire of partisan skirmishes, its depiction of ordinary and unarmed Italian citizens is its most subtly endearing aspect.",1430870400,,754,4.937007874015748
7835115,5,6303000738,"I was 13 in a small town in the heart of the Tuscan-Emilian Appennines (where I grew up) when this movie held me riveted to the screen...the noises of the night: crickets, snapped twigs; the air thick with heat and the stars shooting heavily through the August night when local lore would make us believe that on one particular night after the festivities of Saint Lawrence (San Lorenzo) on the 10th, any wish, any desire, any yearning, would be granted through any shooting star one would witness in the deep, night skies.
My family was rich with stories of the war, both sad and redeeming at once. The elders spun their tales and the adrenaline rush of close calls or accidents would permeate their nervous gestures that would accompany their life sagas.
This movie is exactly that. It's real. The place, the space, the sounds and the people are the exact embodiement of what was.
My family tales came to life in that movie. I was only 13 but I finally understood everything that had been told to me so that I wouldn't forget.
And I haven't, 25 years on.
I cannot wait to watch it again, kleenex-holding and red-eyed, remembering how so many lives were changed and how many more will still be because of ongoing wars around our planet.
May this be your shooting star for wars to stop, forever.
And make it a must in your video library.",1210809600,8,1337,4.551867219917012
