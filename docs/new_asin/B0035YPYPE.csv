4071759,2,B0035YPYPE,"I've got pretty mixed feelings about this DVD.  Its good, I think most of his stuff is great, and as keen followers of Mr Bhoy we laughed lots.  The trouble was, we'd already seen (and brought) 95% of it :/

When my g/f told me there was a new Danny Bhoy DVD out I was pretty excited, but a little skeptical - I hadn't heard about it and hadn't seen anything on his website.  We did some digging and yes she was right, there it was 'available on Amazon only'.  It seemed strange that it wasn't mentioned on his website, there is only Sydney Opera House (please may I take your coat) and The Anthenaeum (cheeky little bugger), but anyways there is was, so off we went and ordered it.

A couple of weeks later it arrived, pretty quick actually - I think I'd checked the amazon website a few days before it arrived and they were predicting a mid July arrival (about an 6 week delivery time - unfortunately not untypical for US to NZ freight).

Popped it in the PS3... and guess what, its freaking region encoded - ok, yes I've checked and Amazon do state that its Region 1 only, my fault I should have checked the fine print :/
Ok, we can deal with that, threw it a region free player, settled down ... and ...

We've seen it all before.  This is my main (only) gripe about the dvd, and the only reason for my low rating... The majority of the content of this show is on Danny's other DVDs.  If you've got them, you've seen it.  Its great content, I laughed my ass off at it live in Wellington, when I watched the Live at the Sydney Harbour Opera House DVD and again at Melbourne... Honest, we watch the dvd's we've got over an over, but I feel a bit cheated to find I've brought the same stuff again.

I guess to be fair I've tried to think about what Amazon or whoever is marketing the dvd could have done differently and haven't come up with much - if they'd said ""hey contains no new content"", or ""pretty much the same as dvd X with a Canadian audience"", then sales might not have been so good.  But .. well you've probably got the idea by now.

As far as the product goes... the main dvd is decent, seemed pretty similar sound and video quality like to the other dvds, so no complaints there.  There are a couple of extras, the visitors guide to scotland you can get for free off his website and the guide to american sports... all I can say is don't judge Danny from these clips, its his day to day anecdotes and vignettes that leave you wishing you'd gone to the toilet before the show started, not this stuff...

So yeah, if you haven't got any other Danny Bhoy DVDs - I'd rate this 5.  If you have, maybe wait for next years comedy festival round and record him with your cellphone.",1277769600,,2688,4.21875

4071771,5,B0035YPYPE,"I would definitely recommend this comedian. They say the last truth that

4071774,5,B0035YPYPE,"Danny Bhoy is one of my favourite comedians.  He is a great storyteller and his comedy style is sharp and witty.  So, don't expect much slap-stick or gag humour from him.  I understand that comedic tastes varies for everyone, and since he is a situational humour comedian, it's either you will relate to him or not.",1384732800,,315,4.589285714285714

4071780,5,B0035YPYPE,"This man, Danny Bhoy, is the most sensational, charming, witty, highly intelligent comedian I have ever seen in my life.

4071781,5,B0035YPYPE,"If you like standup, this guy is hilarious. He broaches so many different topics and had me laughing the whole time. His accent just adds to the entertainment and I love when he talks about his Irish background. Great for an adult laugh!",1361923200,,237,4.534883720930233

4071787,5,B0035YPYPE,Danny Bhoy is hilarious! A physical comedian as well as great use of different dialects. One of the funniest guys I have seen/heard in a very long time!,1350864000,,152,4.464285714285714

4071790,5,B0035YPYPE,"Fortunately, some of this was presented on Comedy Central.  I was delighted to see this was available on Amazon, as there was quite a bit more of the performance on the DVD than was shown on TV.  Danny Bhoy is a comedic genius.  He is educated and has an uncanny ability to see the humor in any situation.  He is able to deliver perfect foreign accents as well as maintaining his own.  I would order more of his performances as they become available.",1286928000,,450,4.373493975903615
4071791,5,B0035YPYPE,"He's quite talented and charming.  Although he uses beeped words, he doesn't have a filthy mouth.  My family laughed out loud and you will too.",1286841600,,143,4.68
4071792,5,B0035YPYPE,"Love this guy's POV, and unlike some stand-up comics he's funny as hell without having to resort to the gutter.  I'm not saying he doesn't swear occasionally - he does - but he doesn't base his entire flipping act on it.

Having grown up in Scotland, bits of this tickled me a little deeper - like the Scots response to being told it's last call in a pub (I've seen it with my own eyes - lol!), or the fact that the Scottish National Anthem is the only one in the world that makes provision for those with Tourette's - ;-)

His really-bad French and American accents are hilarious, and I have to say I love it when a comic cracks HIMSELF up!

There are two bonus features on this DVD as well - a guide to American sports, and a visitors guide to Scotland - both as funny as anything in the stand-up routine.  Spend the money, you won't be disappointed.",1282003200,7,852,4.234567901234568
4071793,4,B0035YPYPE,"I have to agree with the fella from NZ.  Much of the DVD is the same as the Australian performances from the Sydney Opera House and Atheaneum.  In fact, I think those performances are superior to this one, but nevertheless, this is a great DVD.  I only discovered Mr. Bhoy recently and am genuinely impressed.  He is an amazing performer.  His ability to go off on tangents and then to segway back into the original topic is impressive.  He should have a huge fan base in the US.",1278115200,,479,4.386363636363637
8389306,5,B0035YPYPE,So funny!! Highly recommend for late teens to adult. Hope he has another one soon!!!,1525219200,,84,4.666666666666667
8389307,5,B0035YPYPE,"Danny's Subject to Change is highly enjoyable. His impression, observation, & perspective on past/present/future events are hysterical. You will still be laughing days later on his material.",1491004800,,190,6.074074074074074
8389308,2,B0035YPYPE,"Not as funny and entertaining as his previous work. Somewhat disappointed, really.",1485216000,,82,5.916666666666667
