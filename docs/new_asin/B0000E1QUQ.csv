I have been working out to belly dance, tahitian, hula,latin, yoga, and pilates for several years now so I thought I would try hip hop.  I guess I just picked out the wrong DVD to introduce myself into this type of workout. The instructor just moves and expect you to follow and get it then just dance away....

If you are an intermediate/advanced hip hop dancer then this one is for you.",1125100800,3,518,4.548387096774194
8001546,2,B0000E1QUQ,"After reading the other review, I was psyched about ordering the video. However, it did NOT live up to the hype. My first problem (and this may just be my particular DVD) is that the audio is messed up. On the first warmup, you can hear the music, but you can't hear her voice. On the other segments, you can hear her voice, but not the music.

Secondly, the workout is divided into five segments - a warm up, a warm up stretch, the dance routine, a cool down, and a cool down stretch. Well, they got off cheap by making the warm up EXACTLY the same thing as the cool down, and the warm up stretch EXACTLY the same as the cool down stretch. All they did was edit some of the things she said to make it apply to the context of the workout.

My final complaint is that she doesn't break the moves down when teaching the routine. She just does a complex dance step, and you're supposed to pick it right up. I would recommend to anyone that wants to do a cardio hip-hop workout to get Quick Fix Cardio Hip Hop. Loved that one.",1095811200,9,1022,4.130653266331659
8001547,5,B0000E1QUQ,"Lisa Nunziella is one of our favourite dancers. She is a World champion dancer who really knows how to teach.
This video is part of a series that are all great.
This is an advanced hip hop - club style.
It's very complex but still do-able with a lot of practice for beginners.
The instruction is very through & the cues are very good.
This is a great fat burning workout with some fun & usable moves.",1066435200,,400,4.207792207792208
