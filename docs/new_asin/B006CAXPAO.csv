4983432,3,B006CAXPAO,"An ""updated"" Mikado which looses as much as it gains by updating.  Singing and music was good, sets ok.  Costumes elaborate but disappointing.  Certainly colorful enough but out of whack with Mikado as I understand it.  While I liked it and will listen again and again it does not meet the standard set by Opera Australia in ""Pirates"" and even in ""Patience"" and ""Gondoliers""...",1368057600,11,377,4.84375
4983433,3,B006CAXPAO,"I received this with great anticipation, only to find that it was a revival with the same costumes & scenery from the Opera Australia 1987 production, which was infinitely better. Who said that this is better than the 1993, Strafford (Ontario) production is completely wrong. About the only good thing I can say about this Blu-ray disc is that the quality is good and it has English subtitles, sadly lacking in any G&S recording I have seen.",1363305600,,441,4.740259740259741
4983434,5,B006CAXPAO,"The Opera Australia folks sure do a great job with Gilbert and Sulivan productions.  I have just finished this one and The Pirates of Penzance.  Both are excellent.  If you like G&S, you will like these DVDs.",1358985600,,208,4.5675675675675675
4983435,5,B006CAXPAO,"A total classic, this is Gilbert and Sullivan performed at its very best! Opera Australia has captured the very essence of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera in this version of `The Mikado'. The opera opens at a cracking pace under the baton of conductor Brian Castles-Onion, and the joy and fun of Sullivan's music has you smiling before anyone has so much as set a foot on the stage. Then the entertainment really begins with Gilbert's libretto.

In the best tradition of this opera there are the mandatory contemporary asides and props built-in, including an iPad used by Ko-Ko for his `list' - which contains many very relevant people who `will not be missed!'. The stage sets are beautiful, simple and fanciful, and are used to great effect by the artists on stage; the costumes are gorgeous and again, fun. The cast clearly enjoy performing this opera, and praise must surely go to Orchestra Victoria which does an amazing job performing this fast paced and elaborate score.

Yes, as mentioned in other reviews, initially there are a few problems with the camera work and movement blur but this seems to disappear after the first 10 minutes and after that all seems to be okay. On my TV speakers the stereo audio was perfectly fine, and much better than many other movies I have on DVD.

This, in my opinion, is a rare treat, a hilarious and unstuffy production - which is what Gilbert and Sullivan surely had in mind when they set the opera in Japan and satirised the British institutions of the time. Should my DVD ever stop working I would buy another copy. Immediately!",1355443200,16,1579,4.713768115942029
4983436,4,B006CAXPAO,"Oh I loved it... A wholesome evening of pure entertainment...in spite of some lyrics being added, now that the copyright is dead.. not too commendable, but acceptable.

I have never seen such flippancy on stage for a G&S. The Aussies have gone home with whatever satire it could muster and add on to, and done it in style. To begin with, they have erased the Brit Stiff Upper Lip approach to the work that is almost a norm in the British productions that I have watched on the DVD over the years.... That made certain parts of even Mikado a little tiresome. None of that here....

The male voices are clearly no match for the British productions in any way. Perhaps we may tend to feel that after being exposed to the D'Oyly stuff for decades now...
Ko-ko (Anthony Warlow) steals the show, although I cant go to the extent of calling his voice and rendering one of the 'greats' by a mile. Nanki-Poo (Kanen Breen) is not too far behind, and the clarity of the blu ray captures his braces clearly enough. He has a crisper voice than Warlow, and acts a bit like his venerable look-alike, Dick Van Dyke (if you haven't noticed)and is a bit of an over-actor... Pooh-Bah (Warwick Fyfe) fits in beautifully too in his role, and is the best of the three voice-wise. Parts of Pish-Tush and Mikado are performed quite creditably, although not as flamboyant as the others on stage, but rather good voices, I must add...for the roles.

The ladies - Katisha (Adele Johnston)is surely the pick of the lot. She seems to have walked straight out of an Alice in Wonderland or a Sleeping Beauty ballet - Garish as garish can be, but very effective comedic-ally. Taryn Fiebig as Yum-Yum is pretty indeed, but strangely, her singing and diction leave much to be desired. The other two sisters, Jacqueline Dark is excellent in voice and acting as Pitti-Sing and Annabelle Chaffey has done justice to her role of Peep-Bo

The chorus line is a little thin, and in some places, cohesion and precision do lack. But that is more like nit-picking.

Lastly, the orchestra and the conductor Brian Castles-Onion have rendered a very crisp and sprightly performance, although again, slightly wayward at times.

Full marks to the choreography that is BRILLIANT, sets, stage craft, costumes (effectively garish and as caricaturized as they can get) - video is very good and so is the editing and sound. They have spared NO expenses, which is really delightful for us blu ray watchers.
One more thing, the booklet that came with the disc is par excellence for once....

Yes, I would recommend this blu ray to just about any G&S fan - delightfully different is what I should surmise....",1352764800,7,2651,4.688172043010753
4983437,5,B006CAXPAO,I love the Mikado and the Stratford fest version was my favorite for years. This has some great scenes and has become my new favorite.,1344556800,3,134,4.4
4983438,2,B006CAXPAO,"I have no quibbles with the seller price or service.  They were great.  It was the disc I was very disappointed in.  The tempi were leaden but the singing adequate.  Apparently some genius decided that he or she was a better lyricist than Gilbert and a better composer than Sullivan.  The lyrics were ""improved"" in a couple of songs and were so Australia specific that I had no interest in them.  The overture was cut but a clumsy medly of greatest hits from the opera thrown together.  I also think the orchestra was scaled back to chamber size.

Nanki-Poo was dreadful.  His voice in places was rough and strainted but that paled beside his effeminate, silly and embarassing characterization.  He was amateurish, always mugging for the camera, flopping his hands and cutting up like he was caging drinks before a drag show.  Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah weren't much better.

I have Pirates and Pinafore and they were great.  This production just sinks under it's too cute and silly leaden singing.",1339977600,9,990,4.78698224852071
4983439,3,B006CAXPAO,"If it were based on music/singers only it would be a five star production.  Unfortunately...the make-up was horrible and inconsistent and the costumes were pathetic.  But what was worst of all was the stage business.  I'm sorry but it was just too d*mn precious and contrived.  Make-up, costumes, and stage business frankly was so bad that it distracted from the production.

I am disappointed because I generally love what the Australian Opera puts our.",1339545600,,454,5.081081081081081
4983440,2,B006CAXPAO,"Those who consider the staging and costumes of the performance at Savoy Threatre in 1895 to be what Gilbert and Sullivan had in mind for this operetta will be appalled by this silly production. From the opening scene of the ""Gentlemen of Japan,"" whose costumes  were a cross between Victorian and some vague idea of Japanese to the foppish ""Wandering Minstrel"" illustrates just how distant this production is from the concept of the original work.  Definitely agree with the review by Amazon Customer parsifalgaeris. Luckily, I rented the DVD from Netflix. Had I bought it, I would now have an expensive coaster for the coffee table.",1422835200,2,633,4.962264150943396
4983441,4,B006CAXPAO,"Takes Mikado in a different direction like so many companies do. Doesn't help you learn the basic show, but if you already know the show, it is a well done variation.",1421625600,,166,4.387096774193548
4983442,1,B006CAXPAO,"We purchased this dvd because we've heretofore thoroughly enjoyed the Opera Australia performances of Gilbert & Sullivan operettas.  Oh my, how different this one was!  While some of the voices were passably good, it was too much for us to watch the leading ""man"" flailing and gyrating across the stage in a most effeminate way, throughout the entire production, along with Koko, who granted, isn't meant to be as dashing.  Between the licking and the innuendo, along with all of the incessant inside jokes, we felt like it was pure, modern trashiness.  I'm pretty sure a couple of gentlemen are rolling over in their graves about this one.  Please, please bring back Anthony Warlow, David Dobson, and other geniuses!!",1420156800,,718,5.0

4983444,1,B006CAXPAO,"This DVD of The Mikado has neither good singers, actors, directors or anything.

I feel cheated",1415145600,,95,4.9375
4983445,4,B006CAXPAO,Lively and fun.,1412467200,,15,4.333333333333333
4983446,5,B006CAXPAO,This is the most witty and entertaining version of The Mikado I've EVER seen! All the actors are total hams (especially Koko) which is what's needed for a play like this. And the sets and costumes are amazing!,1388448000,,209,4.526315789473684
4983447,5,B006CAXPAO,"This is the BEST production of The Mikado I have ever seen!!! The actors are hilarious and they get to play in costumes and on sets that are clever, witty, and fabulous.",1386806400,,169,4.3125
4983448,5,B006CAXPAO,"lovely treatment of this classic, fine mix of old and new, faux japanese and british/australian, and just a barrel of fun, super staging, at the same time elaborate and simple. Highly recommended.",1384646400,,196,5.15625
4983449,1,B006CAXPAO,"It was produced by people who have in my opinion the emotional intelligence of five year olds,  adults trying to be cute and who lost the humor of the comic opera in their careless performance.",1382745600,,193,4.514285714285714
8496384,3,B006CAXPAO,"Don't buy this.
The constant vulgar gestures are disgusting.
Why can't the director let Gilbert's incredible text speak for itself.",1509148800,,131,5.6
8496385,5,B006CAXPAO,Loved it.  The best production of THE MIKADO I've ever seen and I've seen a lot.,1485820800,,80,4.0
8496386,5,B006CAXPAO,"There are a couple of references to Australian idioms that zipped by me, but that's OK.  The production was wonderful, and it comes across marvelously in Blueray.  Poo-Bah seems appropriately obsequious, the 2nd trombone was totally believable, and Koko stole the show.  Loved it!",1482710400,,280,5.318181818181818
8496387,2,B006CAXPAO,Ruined.  They have no idea what they are doing.  Alas and alack!,1480550400,3,64,4.25
8496388,5,B006CAXPAO,Excellent music with some good acting. A typical G&S operetta.,1453680000,,62,5.3

8496390,4,B006CAXPAO,"This is a very good performance by Opera Australia, but I can't imagine why the conductor, Brian Castle-Onion, decided to use a medley of themes from this opera in place of the overture one can find on a CD reissue of this opera by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from 1973. I also noted that the number,""See How the Fates Their Gifts Allot"" was dropped from this production. I really like this version of Koko's List song; it touches on topics that were happening in Australia, as well as the impact of modern technology.",1439856000,,521,4.553191489361702
8496391,5,B006CAXPAO,"compare to the other Mikado I own this one is more of a comedy, still very good. a few catchy tunes like ""I got it on the list"" had that song in my head for days",1432512000,,161,3.5
8496392,3,B006CAXPAO,"Very nice singing. Unusual staging, props, and costumes. I still prefer the movie from the 1930's with Kenny Baker. Enjoyable, none-the-less.",1431129600,,141,5.761904761904762
