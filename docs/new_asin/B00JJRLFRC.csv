6363224,5,B00JJRLFRC,I thought this documentary was fascinating. I have learned a lot about nature watching PBS through the years and have rarely been disappointed by the work that is put into the films that are made.

  How nice is it to walk away from a documentary with more knowledge than you had going in. The music and delivery of this particular presentation was outstanding. I still go back to the hypnotic butterfly scene from time to time.

6363445,1,B00JJRLFRC,"It is easy to image an evil villain sitting back and loving this documentary.  It's chocked full of weird inferences that do not appear to be backed by science but rather by casual observation tarnished by anthropomorphic expectations and misplaced awe; all this in the context of the subject matter (animal swarms) ultimately yields an end product that would be warmly embraced by any communist regime... anyway, it would be great without narration.",1419379200,,450,5.164383561643835

6363451,1,B00JJRLFRC,"This and MANY other Prime streamed movies CLAIM to be HD, but NEVER load/play as HD...only SD.  I've mentioned many other glitches to Amazon Prime Instant Video customer service, but they don't respond nor fix those issues.  Count on bandwidth flow problems at several evening times NOT caused by Comcast Xfinity Blast Extra as Amazon has claimed; I'm sure it's Amazon's servers that choke.  10:30pm thru 12:15am Pacific often glitches by halting then reloading a show from the start (a very annoying time-waster) and also stops with claims the bandwidth is too low asking if I want to change from HD to SD (which I never do because it's unnecessary).  And WHY is there ALWAYS a reception speed test before loading ANY video??  Especially since Amazon thinks we're stupid enough to confuse the difference between SD & HD picture quality.  It's a freakin' JOKE, and has been for much of the almost 3 years I've tried using this service.  VUDU and others NEVER exhibit these halts and glitches, so it MUST be Amazon servers / connections.",1417996800,,1036,4.8522727272727275
