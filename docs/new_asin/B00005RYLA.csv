1658335,3,B00005RYLA,"This is one of the most bemusing movies I've seen in a long, long time. On the one hand it is a very attractive movie on an artistic level (the church itself is perhaps the star here). Yet on the other hand, plot-lines are so generously distributed in a seemingly hap-hazard fashion (often simply dissapearing never to return), that you're left wondering if a script was in use or simply some kind of Dice Man approach to story telling. And God only knows why little Asia wore a whicker basket over her head in the opening prologue.
I love Argento movies with a passion, but this is far from an Argento movie. Its Soavi's attempt at an over-ambitious theme that gets seriously lost well before the translation. This movie fails where Argento's Inferno succeeded.
I'd love to say its great, but, seriously, its just plain ok.
Anchor Bay's budget release has pretty good picture quality in general, exposing the very 'eighties' feel of the movie.
Overall? Worth seeing for the price, but not outstanding by any means.",1013990400,3,1015,4.740112994350283
1658336,5,B00005RYLA,"This film was originally suppose to be Demons 3 but does not fit in to the original movies and in my opinion is a far much greater film. A very gothic story concerning a church built on the site of a mass execution of a village that was cursed by demons , hundreds of years later the evil is unleased and the church becomes locked up and everyone trapped inside. lots of gore. Produced by Dario Argento and directed by Michele Soavi who directed The more popular cemetary man and the lesser know Stage fright.",1012867200,3,509,4.368421052631579
1658347,5,B00005RYLA,"This is an incredible film from long time Dario collaborator Michele Soavi. It was originally intended to be Demons 3 but went off in it's own direction. In some ways it is like the Demons series with a group of people being trapped in a building (this time a church vs a movie theater or apartment building) but this film is a work of art all it's own. The story involves a church that was built over the grave of a group of alleged satanists. Naturally, all hell breaks loose when the church librarian's curiosity gets the best of him. The film features some well done gore scenes (as to be expected from an Italian horror film!) and a dreamy execution by the cast. Emerson and Goblin's score push it over the edge for any Soavi/Argento fan!!! My favorite of Soavi's directing would have to be Dellamorte Dellamore but The Church comes a close second. This is an absolute must-own for Italian horror buffs.",1512000000,3,908,4.5426829268292686

1658355,2,B00005RYLA,The dubbing was so bad it was actually comical and since there wasn't much horror in the movie in the first place we were hovering on the back button. Its an Italian movie and not the first weve seen on Amazon where they fail to notify you of the version thats available and it looked like it was also cut. If you happen to have a sub-titled uncut version its likely much better than what youll see here and even free was too much to pay for the time lost watching it. It does have a creepy gothic thing going in the church but the fury of the damned is a real joke as it never materializes and the best it can offer is some quick shots of what should be demons but look more like some bad Halloween costumes. Theres really no time frame in it so you're only guessing how long its been from the time one character meets another and then they're in bed it looks like the same day for the babe magnet librarian. The first part of the movie is interesting with the knights but once you're in the church the whole thing doesnt work and the dubbing is even more atrocious and campy comical. I would recommend skipping this version and I wish we had done likewise.,1495929600,,1158,4.197309417040358
1658356,4,B00005RYLA,"PLOT...
In medieval times religious knights massacre a village of witches and build a cathedral on top of their mass grave, in present days the churches librarian accidently unleashes the evil which has laid their since the massacre, this sets off mechanisms built into the infrastructure which trap priests and churchgoers who fall prey to the waking demons and satanic spirits.

This movie is a great collaboration of horror from two masters of cinema director Michele Soavi ( StageFright, Cemetery Man ) and written and produced by the legendary Dario Argento (Suspiria, Phenomena, Mother of Tears) its a very cool demonic gothic horror with a great story, plenty of creepy scenes and good old-school practical effects, some blood, (not overly gory) crazy demon effects and just great looking sets and a very good music score to add to the drama, the cast is all good too including a lovely young Asia Argento who went on to be in many of Dario's movies. certainly is a cool movie to pick up.

1658368,4,B00005RYLA,"The 80s blessed horror fans with numerous bonkers Italian movies with randomly fragmented storiesespecially when considering Fulcis (Conquest, Aenigma, Manhattan Baby) contributions.  These films are seldom good but often enjoyed at the very least, if not celebrated.  Todays surreal film is such a movie

We begin with a group of knights following some weird dude into a cave to meet an accused witch with a cross-shaped stigmata on her foot.  Upon visual (and laughably momentary) confirmation of her damnation, they naturally kill her and everyone in her obviously Satanic village.  Seems practical that a single purported witch results in citywide extermination, right?  Among the montaged savagery we find scores of bloody corpses, some of them naked, piled in a mass grave.  The site is blessed, they drop a giant cross on the pile of bodies and they build a church atop the macabre mass to trap the demon forever.  This sets the tone for a brutal Italian gorefestand there are several somewhat gory effortsbut thats not exactly what were in forthis is more eerie than gory.

Skip to present day and we find our gigantic gothic cathedral led by an inordinately venerable (and weird) priest.  Not sure if this is normal, but the church recently hired a new librarian, a young woman (Barbara Cupisti; Opera, Cemetery Man) to restore its art, and contractors jackhammering away in the catacombs below.  Pretty active for a European church, isn't it?  Anyway, there seem to be some hidden cavities and caverns below the church and an old parchment scroll discovered in its walls begins to unravel mystery and subsequent mayhem.

Our intrigued librarian Evan (Tomas Arana; Gladiator, Frankenfish) believes that artefacts and secrets are hidden away buried beneath cathedrals, and this ignites his sense of adventure and discovery.  Do they grant supernatural power or other-worldly knowledge?  Who knowslets find out!  He solves the encrypted scroll, searches for a stone with seven eyes found atop the mass graves cross and resembling a mixture of Lovecraftian tentacles and the demon Baphomet.  It seals an abyss below and, as in The Gate (1987), some accidently drawn blood opens this infernal doorway.

Perhaps now partially possessed, Evan starts acting super weirdin fact, the whole movie starts getting super weird.  He pulls out his own beating heart for no reason at all, there is a demon goat home invasion, Evan turns into a sex-hungry creeper and he aims some of his unwanted affections toward a very young Asia Argento (Mother of Tears, Demons 2), Asias dad kills someone with a spiked fence and then suicidally jackhammers himself through the stomach to finish opening the infernal gate, an elaborate Indiana Jones mechanism is triggered to lock down the church and trap its occupants, more people get briefly possessed, a monstrous amphibian leaps out of the holy water and attacks someone, trapped people get feverish and delusional, an old lady uses her husbands severed head to ring the church bells, a demon cops a feel of a girls bare butt, the old priest goes mad and gets impaled, theres a mirror whos reflection shouldnt be trusted, and a sex scene with a goat demon and a woman on an altar.  Some of these things seem to be hallucinations whereas others are really happening but, as the movie viewer, Im questioning my own sanity while watching this hilariously eerie nonsense transpire.  No clue why any of it is happeningbut its happening!  So many bonkers things happen in this movie and it culminates in a giant mass of conjoined bodies emerging from the depths.  It reminded me of Society (1989) for just a moment, but not nearly as perverted.

The acting is completely stale and it feels like every scene was shot in a single, unrehearsed take.  And while the pace of this film could certainly be quicker, I enjoyed the creepy atmosphere.  The first act played out much more like an eerie mystery than a horror story and this set a solidly uneasy toneone of the best aspects of this movie, by the way.  I may have wanted a more blatant gorefest, but the healthy diversity of moderate effects complemented the tone well.

Although not directed by Dario Argento (Phenomena), this film (originally released as La Chiesa) certainly wears his mark.  Rather Italian director Michele Soavi (Cemetery Man) is responsible for this zany Italian horror film.  I wouldnt call this film a conquest for the genre, but instead just a stop on the tour of ludicrous 80s horror films to be enjoyed.  Aside from the impotent acting and incontinent story synthesis, a lot was left to be desired in terms of special effects, make-up and gorenone of which offered what Id expect for a lower budget 80s flick.  Although the effort was readily apparent especially when the womans face is smashed (like a birthday cake; no really, it looked like a birthday cake!) onto a subway car and the mirrors reflection scenes.  The macabre mass of bodies at the end was satisfactorily messy, yet should have been more harrowing.  But it just shows up briefly, then is dispatched; it doesnt do anything but appear and shake a few limbs.  Similar can be said for the entertaining goat demon, which doesnt really do anything other than look pretty neatand have sex with someone.  LOL.

The movie ends typically, implying that the cycle of evil will continue but presenting it in a way that will draw no grins of satisfaction.  This was surely entertaining to this campy horror fan, but also surely not so great.",1449792000,4,5504,4.935939196525516

1658370,4,B00005RYLA,"The Church is a interesting follow up to Demons II
made in 1989 when Horror in Italy was slowly dying...
It's a very unique little film
much like Demons 1 and 2 it uses a simple story formula
get a group of survivors trapped in a building the third time being a Gothic Church
While all hell breaks lose

The Cast is hit and miss some of them are really good while others are just there to be killed in some insane way
Stand out Cast members include:

Hugh Quarshie  as Father Gus  (Father Gus is one of the characters you want to get out alive that's for sure)
Feodor Chaliapin Jr. as The Bishop (Great Face he has this strange creepy vibe to him you never fully understand where he really stands through-out the film)
Tomas Arana as Evan,
Barbara Cupisti  as Lisa,  (Super attractive actress mostly known from Italy)
Asia Argento  as  Lotte  (Asia is very young this is one of her earliest films she does a great job for being so young but, you can't help but, wonder why Dario Argento would put a young girl in a film this dark and over the top) Asia has stated in previous interviews how they did not get along in her younger years there relationship was not that of father and daughter  i can see why there's a lot of deep subtext going on in this film)
Asia as Lotte also steals a number of scenes she's in mostly due to her back story there's never a clear answer to her is she good? or evil? Is she the same girl from the opening prologue of the film
you kind of have to make up your own mind when it comes to things by the time the credits roll (which is refreshing)

The F/X work is mostly really solid plenty of over the top gore
The scene with the two bikers meeting the subway is brutal!
 except the bat/demons creature you see near the last act
That creature is bad (It's practical but, looks very cheap maybe it was some type of puppet?
when the creatures is having sex Lisa then everything gets crazy all you need is the Benny Hill chase music to enhance the climax

The score is that great Italian brand of score (the music is it's own character)

It's 102 minutes and Uncut!
If you are a fan of Night of the Living Dead, Demons, Demons II, you'll get a kick out of it
It's one of the last true Italian Splatter films before horror in Italy imploded

If you never seen it and your not sure check it out on El Ray Network they play it uncut
it's a fun rarely seen Italian horror gem  9/10
Hopefully soon we'll see it get a Special Edition/Collector's Edition BR",1445817600,,2476,4.202959830866807

1658373,3,B00005RYLA,"wow, yet another movie I watched because of Argento's involvement turning out to be crap. The overall production is ok for that time period, and the soundtrack has it's moments regarding Phillip Glass etc, but it can't save this movie from being pointless. Teutonic knights slaughter and entire village accusing them of being involved in sorcery and witchcraft in league with the devil. They kill everybody in the village except an architect who they instruct/force to build a church atop the mass burial of the slain villagers. The movie jumps in time to the present and a male librarian arriving at the church and then it all becomes a pointless jumble of ridiculous religious/Zionist mythological nonsense. People randomly being possessed by demons, or the devil himself etc, basically there's no rhyme or reason to this entire movie. Asia Argento is a cast as a mysterious young girl who apparently was reincarnated and knew of their priests prior evil deeds... whatever it makes no sense. The church traps the idiot people inside, they start getting possessed and dying various stupid deaths, the devil appears and starts humping one of the women in a cheap Rosemary's Baby moment for no reason at all etc, it's just a meandering bunch of crud really.",1437696000,,1256,4.985714285714286

1658375,3,B00005RYLA,"In medieval Germany, a faction of the Teutonic Knights slaughter a village full of townspeople who were accused of being Satanic witches. Following the massacre they bury the dead bodies in a mass grave and build a large gothic church. Now, centuries later in 80s Germany, the church gets a new librarian, Evan.

One day while doing research about medieval Europe, Evan discovers that a French alchemist believed that the Table of Laws was buried under one of the cathedrals. Curious to know what hidden treasures may lie beneath the very church he's in, he opens the crypt and accidentally awakens and unleashes the evil spirits that laid beneath the church grounds. The events cause the church's automated mechanisms trigger, causing the entire church to go on lockdown, trapping everyone inside. Now the innocent souls trapped within the confines of the church must fight to survive the onslaught of these evil spirits who are seeking to resurrect an ancient demon to wreak havoc on earth

Overall: The Church is said to be a part of the Demons movie series but honestly anyone who's seen Demons knows that The Church has absolutely nothing to do with Demons and has not even the slightest bit of content in common with any of those films. Unfortunately The Church only measures up to being decent which is somewhat disappointing because I went in to watching this movie with high expectations only to be met with rather low standards. Honestly, the biggest problem with this movie is how slow the pace is. Nothing interesting really starts to take place until around the second hour/half of the film. The plot is interesting and the gothic/medieval style of the film is really cool and artsy it's just that it takes a while for the interest to really build up. I do recommend giving The Church a watch if you get the chance. It's fairly well told and once the second half sets in, you're pretty much hooked for the remainder of the film",1432166400,,1940,4.770833333333333

The only plus with which I came away was that, as others have commented, many of the visuals and sets are attractive, but, otherwise this movie is so riddled with plot holes as to be entirely nonsensical.  Even worse than the almost non-existent plot is the atrocious dubbing.  I loathe dubbed films - I've never seen one that wasn't torture to see.

It begins in with a horrific event that took place approximately in the 1500's with a bunch of soldiers lead by a mad religious fanatic weasely little creep guy who just by mere accusation of devil worship gets an entire village of people killed by the soldiers, thrown into a huge deep hole and buried in a mass grave one poor woman was still alive. He then has a church built on top of the it he says to seal the evil away and keep it frome escaping into the world

Years later in the modern times during repairs something is awoken deep in the earth the basement floor begins to crack and slowly spooky things begin happening. Eventually it starts turning into a nightmare when a fashion magazine group boss talks a young priest into letting them do a photo shoot in the church this later leads to horrifying events demons,evil, horrid creatures, demonic possession and more

As the story progresses we learn that the same weasel who ordered the village peoples deaths centuries ago also had an architect who also dabbled in science killed for supposedly practicing satanic alchemy, the architect who is also buried there holds the secret to the church that can stop the evil and its up the young priest who must find and use it to prevent the diabolic forces from escaping into the world",1412121600,2,1356,4.622406639004149

Centuries later, someone breaks the protecting seal and  releases the entire population of HELL and re-seals the church trapping the innocents and not-so-innocents inside to be picked off one by one.

Produced by Italian horror legend Dario Argento and directed by Michele Soavi of ""Cemetery Man"" fame (Dellamorte Dellamore), ""The Church"" (La chiesa) was originally planned to be the third installment of the Demons franchise. However, director Soavi wanted to make something better, and the result is a more mature film, though surely not as much fun as the original ""Demons"". The story is an interesting one, as is the film throughout, though I would have personally preferred more insight into the lead characters and a clearer explanation of some of the medieval events that set up the situation. Of course, this is an Italian horror film we're talking about here. Personally, I have always found them somewhat lacking, though they have their good points too (I rather enjoyed Demons when I finally saw it and look forward to getting it, and Cemetery Man is well-known to be a fantastic little film). With dubbing, it can be hard to judge performances, and some of the dubbing is goofy, as always, but the stars do well, especially Hugh Quarshie as Father Gus and Argento's daughter Asia, who is very cute here as little Lotte (took me a while to recognize her). If you are a fan of Italian horror, Dario and/or Asia Argento, and so on, this is a must own. It's pretty good for that sub-genre. However, if you know you don't like Italian horror, I wouldn't recommend it to you. If you're in the middle, rent it at least. The DVD has good widescreen picture and sound and includes the theatrical trailer and a thorough text bio of Michele Soavi.",1231372800,,1987,4.809941520467836
1658394,3,B00005RYLA,"La Chiesa (Michele Soavi, 1989)

Michele Soavi's Dellamorte Dell'Amore remains one of the best horror-comedies of all time, so when I got a chance to see one of his earlier films, La Chiesa, I jumped at it. Now, Soavi got his start as an assistant director for Dario Argento, and Argento wrote the script, so it should come as little shock that La Chiesa comes off kind of like second-rate Argento. (Argento's daughter Asia even has a minor part in the film, as she did increasingly often in Argento films during the eighties.) Plotwise, anyway. While Soavi's direction does wear his Argento influence writ large on its sleeve, he learned all the right things from the master of Italian horror, and there's enough actual Soavi in there to ensure that you at least sense this isn't completely an Argento joint (as was, say, ""Lamberto Bava""'s Demons).

We open with an extended scene that takes place during what seems to be the Inquisition or the Crusades, in which an entire village is slaughtered for witchcraft and a mad monk tells the murderers to build a church on the land; the consecrated ground will stop the dead from coming back. Fast-forward to the twentieth century. A new librarian starts working at the church while some restoration is going on. The combination of these two things kicks into motion a series of events that ensures, of course, that the dead will, in fact, come back for some sinister purpose. When the dead trip off one of the safety mechanisms, the church is sealed off from the outside, trapping a number of innocents with the vengeful spirits. If you've seen Demons, you know what's going to happen from that point. (The script was originally conceived as a third entry in the Demons series, but Soavi rewrote it to the point where La Chiesa has very little in common with the other films in the franchise. Two other attempts were made to produce a third Demons film, Black Demons and The Ogre; both, interestingly, met the same fate as La Chiesa. Someone must have realized that if Demons 2 was that bad, the series was unsaveable. And thank heaven for that.)

The acting is mediocre, the script not much better; neither is remotely up to the standard Soavi would set for himself with Dellamorte Dell'Amore five years later. What is here and intact, however, is Soavi's incredible visual sense, which is even more pronounced here than it is in his later work. I do note that this may well be because you don't have such niceties as plot, character development, etc., to distract you from Soavi's constant barrage of gorgeously-constructed shots. It's a gorgeous movie, and those who simply appreciate the fine visuals will find this a treat; most filmgoers, however, will likely not be satisfied with a pastiche held together so thinly. For them, I recommend Dellamorte Dell'Amore instead. ***",1223596800,,2827,4.81275720164609

They build a church over it so that the taint of evil wouldn't come back again, now in the present day a librarian wants to uncover the secrets of the cathedral as he accidently opens the secret sealed tomb as it unleashes demonic forces onto the church and trapping a group of people inside. But can the priests and some of the trapped people put a stop to this unholy curse or will the world be damned forever?

A feverish and bizarre supernatural horror fantasy shocker from Michele Soavi (Director of the brilliant ""Cemetery Man"" and ""StageFright"") and from co-writer and producer Dario Argento delivers a grueling and stylish journey to hell. There is some nudity and graphic violence shown with some good make-up and demon effects, the film itself is a sequel of sorts to both ""Demons 1 and 2"". Legendary Italian actor Giovanni Lombardo Radice does a nice performance as the Reverend, Asia Argento as the young girl Lotte and the movie has a good score by Goblin, fans of ""Demons 1 & 2"" should seek out this gem.

1658396,3,B00005RYLA,"The Church is the 2nd feature film from director Michele Soavi who was dubbed as the savior to Italian horror. Soavi came around when Italian horror was on its last legs. With the exception of Dario Argento a lot of the other popular filmmakers were on the decline, were having trouble getting work or became knockoff directors. Michele Soavi was hailed as the savior and to be honest I never quite got why.

Originally The Church was meant to be the 3rd part of the Demons series, but it ended up going in a different direction and what we get is a very mixed bag. The Church wasn't a bad movie, but the problem is nothing really happens.

The screenplay was written by Dario Argento, Franco Ferrini & Michele Soavi. Dardano Sacchetti, Lamberto Bava and Fabrizio Bava also contributed to the screenplay, but were un-credited. So due to that I'll just mention the credited writers.

The screenplay actually wasn't too bad; there were some interesting concepts, while there might be a silly moment or two for the most part the script wasn't bad. The basic concept here is the same as Demons, but there was a little more depth to the screenplay. Demons and Demons 2 were fun splatter flicks, but The Church was more serious. The biggest problem here is the lack of action. The screenplay really wasn't too bad and made even better by what was coming out of Italy at this time.

But there are some problems; the two lead characters pretty much go MIA in the 2nd half, other characters might appear early on than don't come back until the end. The 2nd half introduces some new characters and they don't add anything to the plot. They are just there to die and we don't even see most of the deaths.

The Church does benefit from a solid cast, Giovanni Lombardo Radice has a small role and it's always great seeing him in a horror movie and a young Asia Argento also stars. The Church was Asia's 3rd movie.

Michele Soavi worked under Dario Argento as an assistant director and it is quite clear he learned a lot. Dario Argento is a very visual filmmaker and if I didn't know any better I would think he was the director. Soavi creates a movie that is visually stunning. The Church is one of the very best shot movies I have ever seen. Dare I say it's on par with an Argento movie?

The problem though is really nothing happens. The first few minutes are set in the medieval times and we get a little bit of action, but surprisingly little gore. After that we cut to the present and from that point on it's mostly talk and more talk. Michele Soavi is able to build some suspense and tension, but the problem is there is no pay off; though to Soavi's credit he's very much able to have a nice gothic looking horror movie.

Like I said The Church is slow, but what saves the movie from being an all out bore is the visuals. The first half in particular is just so amazingly shot. The Church easily rates as one of the best shot horror movies I have ever seen. In the case of Italian filmmakers not all, but most have this great visual side to their movies and Michele Soavi might be one of the best. The student can't top his teacher though, but you can clearly see the Argento influence. There is some great stedi-cam work as well.

Once we hit the 45-minute mark things begin to pick up with an excellent scene, which a character is chased around her house and I thought right there would be the turning point, but instead after that nothing really happens again. Once the hour mark comes in we have a group of characters trapped in the church and it seems like the action is about to start, but guess again.

This is the biggest downfall to The Church the lack of action like I said we get some good moments of suspense and tension, but there is very little pay off. Despite the lack of anything happening Michele Soavi is able to create some tension and suspense thanks to his visual touch and that is what kept me interested in the movie despite the lack of action. The final act to The Church is kind of messy and more often than not the movie just sort of repeats itself by this point and the ending is very anti-climatic. If you are expecting a big showdown between the characters and demons you can forget that.

I can't really explain why I enjoyed The Church; there is very little action, but the gore level is decent. While it might take sometime to get to the gore and when we finally get it, well it seems like a long time till we get it again, but it is done well. But not a whole lot happens. It's a lot of talk and build up with little pay off, but yet there is just something about The Church I liked. I guess it's the visual side that held my interest, but the 2nd half none of this works as well.

In closing, The Church is a movie with a lot of potential, but just doesn't seem to go anywhere. Even though I did enjoy the movie it's not a must see and it's really the visual side that keeps things interesting, but that can only save it for so long.

The Church sometimes goes under the title of Demons 3 along with two other movies, 1 being Lamberto Bava's The Orge and Umberto Lenzi's Black Demons. None though are sequels to Demons, but The Church is the closest one in that style.",1193788800,,5197,4.334362139917696

1658399,4,B00005RYLA,"THE CHURCH

Review by Nickolas Cook

 In medieval Europe, a band of crusading knights massacre a village of suspected devil worshippers, and then build a large gothic church atop the cursed remains.

Flash-forward to present day, to the still-standing elaborate cathedral, as a visiting historian uncovers an ancient bit of parchment that helps him unlock the basement crypt/doorway to Hell.  Archaic mechanisms click into place, trapping a group of people inside the church as all Hell breaks loose.

Co-written and produced by maestro Dario Argento (Suspiria), THE CHURCH helped to cement the reputation of director Michele Soavi (Stagefright, Cemetery Man, two fantastic horror flicks of incredible visceral humor and intelligence) as the new master of Italian horror. This was originally intended to be a spinoff of Bava and Argento's DEMONS and its sequel, and was known as DEMONS 3, but the studio decied after seeing its complexity and stunning visual to release it as a standalone picture instead.

All I can say is: if you've never seen this one, you're missing a hell of a visual treat.  Anchor Bay take this underrated classic of Italian horror and really give it the tender lovin' care it deserves for a DVD release.  The full screen is especially awesome during those sprawling architectural trawl shots that Soavi uses to wonderful effect.  The sound is enhanced, so even a regular television still picks up those little nuances that make the background sound work so well.  And the music...WOW!  How can you pass up a chance to hear not just the great idols of Italian horror soundtracks, Goblin, but also Keith Emerson?  The music plays like another character to the story, as it winds and insinuates itself throughout Soavi's dark scenery.

A very young Asia Argento turns up as Latia, daughter to the abusive church maintenance man.  The rest of the cast gives great performances as the church begins to eat them up, one at a time.

There are two scenes in particular that I'd like to point out, and they stand for me as demarcations in THE CHURCH, cinematic moments that tell you that the people who put them together knew their business visually, and knew that what they were doing was bigger than themselves.  They're both towards the end.  One is a full screen shot of a man who has become a demon.  He's winged and even has a winding Boa Constrictor-like tail.  The shot is so sweet for a horror fan that it'll bring tears to your eyes.

And if that one doesn't do it, then the second shot will for sure.

It's a full head-shot of a demon rising from the crypt beneath the church.  But the head is made up of dozens of people hanging together on this massive framework to give the subtle impression of a demon's face slowly coming up from Hell.

Incredible.

As I said, Anchor Bay really puts their hearts and souls into this one, folks.  They even present it uncut, uncensored and fully restored from the original vault materials.  THE CHURCH is a must-own for true-blue horror fans, and for anyone who loves the pure visual beauty of film.

I have seen the movie a number of times in the past, but it has been a while, so my memory is a bit dimmed. I do know that I am very enthusiastic about this film.  I and some other Argento fans have bemoaned the fact that a DVD has not been available; at least that was our experience for a long time.  I'm elated that I've been able to obtain it.  I hope to write a real review soon, after I've caught up with my viewing.  Right now I can only express my appreciation for finally obtaining a copy.",1152662400,2,589,3.9914529914529915
1658401,3,B00005RYLA,"""The Church"" was my first foray into Italian horror films, and the first time I've ever seen anything by Argento or Soavi.  I completely understand now why so many people despise this genre, but I can also see the merit in it.  This film was very focused on atmosphere and setup, and to be blunt, completely ignored all plot and contuinity.  The costumes and sets were all done very well.  The medieval knights and the villiage they invade at the beginning of the film obviously had a lot of work put into them, as I didn't even once think ""Oh, the director invaded a costume store half an hour before shooting began"" as I have in other low budget films with medieval sequences.  The actual demons themselves, which are curiously hidden from the camera for most of the film, were also done in stunning detail.  Although its all obviously rubber suit type effects, they still manage to hold their own, even against more modern demon effects seen in newer films.  The crazy effects at the climax of the film were amazing! *potential spoiler of the end here - skip to the next paragraph if you want to see the effect before reading about it*  A giant writhing ball of human corpses covered in some sort of evil alchemical mud gunk rises up from below the church in unholy glory...how often does that happen in a movie? Of course, the giant ball of corpses leads me to the problems in the movie, namely that absolutely nothing makes any kind of sense.  Why is there a giant ball of corpses (the bodies of the villagers killed at the beginning of the film would have been decomposed into nothingness by this time, so don't try to tell me it was them)?  Why doesn't it actually DO anything, besides writhe around?  None of this is even attempted to be answered.

Random events occur for no apparent reason, other than that they fit the mood and tone of the movie.  Likewise, all the characters behave in bizarre and completely illogical ways, with no attempt at an explanation for their insane actions.  The laws of reality are constantly bent and broken to make any given scene work.  At one point, a man commits suicide with a jackhammer.  Nevermind that that would probably be physically impossible - you'd need someone else to hold the jackhammer for you.  Later, the same person who should have a gaping jackhammer-induced hole in his body, appears whole and undamaged to tear apart an iron fence and then stab someone in the throat with it.  There are at least 10 or 20 witnesses to the murder - do they freak out?  Try to subdue the crazy man killing people?  React at all, in any way?  Nope.  The murderer and the victim just conviently dissapear, all traces of the crime gone in a puff of illogic, and everyone who witnessed the act goes on as if nothing out of the ordinary just occured.  Later on an old woman and her husband climb to the top of the church to ring a giant bell, in an attempt to alert the outside world that they are trapped inside.  When they reach the bell, the movie cuts to a different scene and the old folks are ignored for a time.  When we cut back to them, the old woman is banging the bell with her husband's decapitated head.  When and how did the man become decapitated?  Why is the old woman banging the head against the bell, instead of running around screaming because her husband just died?  We are expected to just accept this all at face value.  Oh, and apparently you can also tear your heart out by putting your fingers partway into your belly button.  Human anatomy seems to have changed significantly since I last studied it...

The story itself has a giant contradiction as well.  The entire movie is based on the premise that the villagers were in fact some sort of devil worshippers who could become demonic beings and that they were freed from their prison to wreak havoc on the world.  However, towards the end of the film we are given a flashback were the architect of the church explains that the massacred town consisted of ordinary people who had the misfortuen to contract the plague - and that the church confused sickness with black magic.  Apparently the templars were wrong the whole time - those villagers weren't demons, they were just normal people.  So just ignore all the unleashed demonic things killing everyone around you in the mysterious sealed off church - they aren't real, and you are a superstitious and closed minded religious nut for believing in them. The list of contradictions and obsurdities could literally go on for pages.  However, if you are the sort of person who actively seeks out this kind of movie, none of that will matter to you, so don't worry about it, there's plenty of demonic mayhem here to keep you placated.

The acting was pretty bad, especially by all the templar knights and priests.  The only exception was Hugh Quarshie, who played Brother Gus.  You can tell he is actually trying to put some life into his role and play it for all he's worth.  Unfortunately, when everyone else is doing such a laughably terrible job, it really makes his attempts seem bad too.  This style of film seems to be a bit an acquired taste.  If a movie with no plot whatsoever, but really great demon infested sets and effects makes you go ""Hell yes!"", then this is a movie for you.  Otherwise, don't waste your time here, you'll end up wanting to bang your head repeatedly against the nearest blunt object.  Despite all the problems, I guess this sort of style kind of grows on you, as I've already ordered several more movies in the same vein.  If  I had to give this move a Grade, I'd go ""C-"", because there are some really cool things here, but they are all overshadowed by how ridiculous the movie can get.",1145750400,3,5689,4.538763493621198
1658402,4,B00005RYLA,"Not going too deep with this review this time around. The Argento-esque atmosphere and style in The Church is just as evident as it was in Tenebre and Suspiria. If anything get it for the scene where a girls head is smashed like a porcelain doll by a subway(dont ask). Kinda slow in some parts but the last 45-50 mins it gets kinda crazy. Is the plot anymore coherent than any of his earlier flicks? Of course not. But thats not to say that this film is bad. I recommend it, but just don't expect a masterpiece.

1658406,3,B00005RYLA,"This slow-paced ""thriller"" is entertaining all-in-all.  The storyline is too convoluted; it twists and turns like a multi-headed snake, going in too many directions and not following through with several of the main characters, and there are MANY main characters; too many.  The first half promises a mysterious journey through the dark, secret passages of an ancient church built over the earth of a massacre that took place generations before.  We're never certain whether the ""innocents"" who were murdered by the Templar Knights were actually devil worshippers or just misunderstood early Christians, as possibly indicated by the stigmatas that mark the bottom of their feet.

As for too many characters, we have a very sexy leading lady, and rugged handsome leading man, a striking ancient priest who seems at times like he will be the savior of earth, a young black priest, and an innocent young girl who is either the reincarnation of one of the murdered innocents from the past, or THE girl herself.  All these characters promise a storyline to follow, but then their importance fades towards the end of the picture, and no real hero, with the exception of the young black priest, come to the foreground.

Still, with the creepy, gothic church interiors and the sinister demons that begin to kill and take over victims, the film will hold the interest of Itallion Horror Cinema fans.

1658408,4,B00005RYLA,"This is a great atmospheric, gothic horror film with a bit of gore to spice things up.  There's not much going on as far as plot is concerned.  We have a prologue showing a group of Templars massacreing a supposedly Satannically obsessed pack of villagers, and then building a cathedral over top of the burial ground.  Fast forward to the modern day, where a demonic curse is released by an overly curious librarian, leading to havoc and the trapping of a number of individuals within the cathedral.  That's about the short and long of it.  People are possessed by demons, demons run amuck, the cathedral is shot ominously, it's all rainy, characters do little but release demons/be possessed by demons/be killed by demons etc.  The plot doesn't much matter, and Soavi doesn't let it get in the way of the good stuff.

This has got some really good production values, and the acting is generally quite good by the standards of this sort of fare.(I particularly the librarian, during the day after he was possessed, but before things really go crazy.)  Virtually all the performances are acceptable, at the very least, with the exception of the whiny old man, who is very annoying.  I'm not as impressed by the demon effects as some are.  Personally, I think they are simultaneously quite impressive technically, and a bit hokey in design.  However, they are given a minimum of screen time, and work pretty well when used in such a manner.  The gore is generally very well executed, with the exception of the decapitation in the opening scene, which is a bit weak.  The highlight is, obviously, the suicide by Jackhammer.  A hideous concept executed beautifully.  Other than that we've got a guy impaled on a spier, impalation through the neck with a gate, facial self-mutilation, a chick getting smashed by a subway car, another decapitated head etc.  Generally, the gore works well.  Too much gore would've been inappropriate, but without any things might've been a bit too slow and uneventful.  Soavi finds just the right balance.

This film is all about atmosphere. The entire film has a fairly dark, oppressive air to it, particularly in the opening section and the scenes after they're trapped in the cathedral.(The shots of them just sitting around the cathedra waiting are particularly effective) Soavi's camerwork is obviously influenced by his mentor Argento, using lots of low-angle shots, and lots of slow, prowling shots examining the interior of the cathedral.  However, unlike Argento, the cathedral is largely presented as is, without the colored lighting and bizarre set design you frequently find in an Argento film.(This is the way it should be; the cathedral itself is ominous enough.)  The soundtrack, partially done by Goblin, is quite effective.  It's nothing particularly surprising, but it's nice and ominous without being overbearing or hokey.

Fans of Dario Argento will probably want to check this out.  It's quite different from anything I've seen from him, but it's got a bit of the same flavor.  Fans of The Beyond may also want to check this out, provided they actually enjoyed the atmospheric portions of the Beyond along with the gore.  Personally, I was sufficiently impressed that I'm really looking forward to seeing the rest of Soavi's films, should they ever get released on DVD.(or arrive at my house... stupid mailman)

1658409,4,B00005RYLA,"What's going on in the church?  Well, back in the middle ages a community of alleged devil worshippers get slaughtered by some templar-like knights.  After throwing the bodies in a pit, they get an alchemist to build a church on the pit.  Flash forward to nowdays and the church is up and running.  Some Curious George librarian decides to unravel the mystery, letting all the revenge-hungry demons out.  This is about one hour through the film.  For the remaining 40 minutes the people inside the Church are trapped and have to deal with all kinds of demon hocus pocus.  This project started out as a third Demons film, but went through some ch-ch-ch-changes.  There are similarities to the Demons films however.  The demonic possession in this film seems to spread from person to person in the form of a physical infection/sickness.  They even call it a ""plague"" at one point.  WILL THEY GET OUT ALIVE????  Dario Argento's protege, Michele Soavi(who went on to do the awesome Cemetery Man) obviously learned a thing or two from his teacher.  The Church isn't a fantastic film, but it's quite good and shows Soavi's potential.  It's not a total gorefest, it's only really gory when it has to be.  There is a very gruesome suicide by jackhammer that'll get your attention.  As others have pointed out, the devil monster in this film looks excellent.  And boy it does!  Too bad he's got about 5 seconds of screen time(and that's not really an exaggeration either).  For the price of this dvd it's quite a painless gamble.  If you like the Fulci approach to Italian horror, The Church can go either way with you.  But if you dig Argento's style, most likely you'll dig this as well.",1097366400,,1680,4.70446735395189

1658411,3,B00005RYLA,"When I heard about this movie, I wanted to watch it for it's name alone, I felt nervous watching it because I thought it was going to be as frightening as other horror films involving religion. Now, the acting is very good, the scenery is amazing and eerie, it's what I expected to look like when I saw the cover of it. There is plenty of gore and in very gruesome ways, the subway scene is historic! There is one scene from this movie that is a really famous painting, let's see if you will know what scene I'm talking about. I liked the ending of the movie, it's a real twist, but I was expecting alot more. I kept saying to myself, this has to be the scene where the dead rise! But there are no zombies in this movie so don't expect any, there's alot of de javu in this, but I really expected more, like a battle between good and evil. The atmosphere couldn't have been any better, if you're a horror fan wanting to watch something different, with a really creepy atmosphere watch this movie. If you're looking for a horror movie with tons of action, look elsewhere, though this was fun to watch it leave me wanting to know more about what happened, that's probably the reason I wasn't too satisfied with it, because it leaves you wanting something.

1658412,5,B00005RYLA,"The story seems initiated by the fascination of the otherworldly architecture of the european gothic cathedral, which of course is the ultimate setting for a movie about pagan demons coming back to life.
A mediaeval pagan sect is massacred by templars and a cathedral is build on the burial ground to seal off the ""evil"". In present day the curiosity of a librarian working in the church leads to the awakening of what was once buried underneath.
The movie is intellectual and slowpaced, which will scare off the illiterates expecting a slasher-movie in the usual Argento-style, but the pace is essential to the whole idea, the investigation and exposal of the mystery. It's a great jigsaw puzzle, worthy of repeated viewing. Feodor Chaliapin Jr. (who didn't want us to laugh in The Name of the Rose) makes a good appearance as the bishop, having the perfect face for this kind of menacing old clergyman. The rest of the acting is simply adequate, the english dubbing mostly awfull, but the cinamatography and special effects are quite inventive, making it not only a great story but an inciting cinematic experience as well.",1077840000,,1125,4.926315789473684

But I must admit that the direction from Michele Soavi who gave us the fantastic and frightening STAGEFRIGHT is not bad, the performance from the actors is correct, the special effects are good and the score is extraordinary but where is the story!!! Where the movie is going? Those questions are not even resolved at the end.  This is probably the most bizarre and weird film I`ve ever seen.

1658414,3,B00005RYLA,"Originally planned as the third installment in the ""Demons"" series, this interesting concept became a completely different film altogether which is kind of ""too bad"". The ""Demons"" series is a lackluster and tedious affair, it would have benefited greatly with this entry since it would have guaranteed at least one good film in the series. ""The Church, although lacking on several aspects, is light years ahead of them.

The story begins in an unholy village whose inhabitants are ruthlessly massacred by the church. A large cathedral is then built over the massacre site in order to keep the ""evil"" buried forevermore. However, not even God's temple could prevent what is about to take place. Several centuries later, in modern times, the cursed victims are accidentally resurrected. The invisible demons possess and attack several unlucky people who happen to be locked inside the haunted structure.

This original horror film is somewhat creative, beautifully filmed but very chatty so patience is definitely necessary. For those of you who stick it out, you will be awarded with several scenes of artistic merit and intense gore. Michele Soavi, like Argento, Fulci and Bava, did not shy away from depicting loss of life in the most unsettling manner. There is a disturbing and graphic suicide scene that should please ""Gore-hounds"". There is also a neck impaling, a face ripping, and a very humorous demise involving a speeding subway. The ""horned-one"" himself also makes a couple of unexpected cameos flaunting its goat-like appearance and elaborately curved horns - farm animals never looked this frightening.

""The Church"" is your typical Italian/Euro horror movie with the typical bad dubbing; stiff acting and several million plot holes. However, fans of the genre really don't care about these films shortcomings because they more than make up for it with their visual style and awesome body count. It's also a very attractive looking movie. Several of the main actor's are very attractive as is the stunning church location and cinematography. Argento/Soavi fans should enjoy this surreal but confusing tale of Satanists, Satan and everything else that is unholy. Don't expect ""Demons 3""- this film is far superior to both of those Bava atrocities. However, a note of warning, for those of you wanting a ""Demons"" affair you might want to skip this one because you will be disappointed.",1069459200,,2396,5.186046511627907
1658415,3,B00005RYLA,"Ok, heres the deal. The opening sequence was very well done, the gothic style and mood to the movie was also effectively achieved. But the character development was horrid and the final scenes of the movie seemed to be rushed. The final scenes, the whole summoning of Baphomet/sex scene and the rise of the damned set-piece could have used some more time I think. And who cares about those characters who were introduced later in the film. And why are the two seemingly main characters almost totally forgotten at the end of the film? Anyway, those are just some of my gripes and considering most italian horror films, those kind of gripes would be pretty standard.

1658416,2,B00005RYLA,"I am a huge Dario Argento fan. His style is just amazing. One day my eyes fell upon The Church because it had the Dario Argento name on it, and finally decided to fork over the money for it because the back stated ""originally know as Demons 3"", and I loved the first two Demons films and with Argento producing, how could this film goe wrong? It does. The film starts off very promisesing with a great beginning score by Goblin and then switching to knights galloping to a town full of witches. When the film changes to modern day, and then the film falls apart. It's not director Michele Soavi'd fault, he just has very little to work with in Argeno's script. The script just has huge plot holes. So big, that they insult my intellegence. Sometimes people are possessed by demons just because and some because they are scratched (like in the first two demons movies). The church was originally full of children when it was closed up, and suddenly the kids disappear. What was with Asia Argento's character also appearing in a past flashback. People who have seen this know what I mean and those of you about to see it will see what I mean. Sure Demons 2 had plot wholes, but at least it was fun to watch. The Church, sadly doesn't have near the entertainment value. The only thing that keeps the film moving is Michele Soavi's catchy camera work. Otherwise if fails miserably. I've seen the film two times and I can't get forgive some of these mistakes. Michele Soavi has directed some great horror films (Cemetery Man comes to mind), but The Church isn't one of them. Argento fans should buy this with caution. Only buy if you find it cheap or if your a Argento collector. The film just left a bad taste in my mouth.",1052179200,2,1718,4.457142857142857

1658422,3,B00005RYLA,"I have to say that I enjoyed a good portion of the movie, namely the first half, but once everyone gets stuck in the church, well, things collapse faster than the old builing itself.  What made this movie strong in the begining was that it didn't try to focus on to many characters.  But then we are introduced to everyone who is caught in the church.  Soon characters just vanish from the plot all together, and then re-appear later, and then vanish again.  And what happened to all the children?  There where like at least ten kids, and they all happen to magically vanish!  Plus, it is very hard to tell how people become transformed into demons in this film.  Some are scratched (as it was in Demons1), but some just magically change (like say the old woman).  The main fault of this film is that it doesn't commit to anything.  It throws all these things together, and only follows through on some of them.  So, yes, while the first half is quite good, and well written, the last half is nothing but pointless gore, sex, and an attempt at sounding sophisticated.  So rent it first before you commit to buying it.

1658423,5,B00005RYLA,"Being a fan of Argento's works, I will say upfront that my views are slightly skewed in his favor. Still, this work, teaming Argento with Michele Soavi, is something of a favorite of mine. As viewers, we find ourselves introduced to a church that was, in times past, erected to contain the pesky menace of its vengeful, longtime occupants. To illustrate this, we get a lovely sequence showing the seeming slaughter and subsequent burial of all an entire village. It looks like brutality at its finest at first, but then, as hands grasp at those who try to trap the damned here, the crusaders seem to have found more than they can handle. So, how do you handle this? Why, seal it up and build a church on it, of course! Fastforwarding to the future, the church and its guarded secret is threatened and, of course, unleashed upon those unlucky enough to be trapped inside. Of course, this leads to an ending most befitting.
 This film brims with an eerie atmosphere that, most deservedly, helped gain Soavi a reputation as an excellent filmmaker, plus it has some nice Darioesque qualities as well. Asia Argento is here, just begging to become victimized by yet another manifestation of evil, and Goblin gives us another work of art. Combining these qualities with the fact that even the subway, a normally defunct ""roadblock"" at best, finds itself an unlikely killing machine, I'd have to recommend it as something to use to tuck the children in.

1658424,5,B00005RYLA,"I don't know why so many people chose to ignore this movie.  While I love Fulci and Argento, many critics of Church consider mediocre efforts such as New York Ripper, Phenomena, and Demons to be ""Italian Horror Classics"".  This movie makes those films look like boring puddles of puke.
  Sure, there are things wrong with this movie, but I've made a list of reasons why this deserves to be a classic:
1.  The church itself is amazing!  While many ""Catholic Metaphysics"" horror films come off as un-researched and exaggerated, this movie seems truly authentic.
2.  The style of this film, worked by director Michele Soavi, has the same level of atmospheric moodiness that made movies like ""The Beyond"" and ""Suspiria"" classics.  Any time you can make the day seem creepy you've done something right.
3.  ... horror movies ... because if they aren't plain cheesy, they lack anything distinct and memorable that you could recall ten minutes after watching. (example: New York Ripper)
This film is LOADED with all sorts of creative and twisted gags, I can't even remember all the things that stood out to me while I watched it.
4.  It has a crazy score by Goblin (for those uninitiated, sorry)
5.  The subject matter and subtle historical references are intriguing and mostly accurate.  (I never knew anything about alchemy or Fulcanelli, but now i'm scouring the internet for it)
6.  Most ""we're trapped in the haunted house"" movies reduce themselves to frantic pandemonium reminiscent of the end of ""Project X"".  Soavi shows incredible restraint in using body counts, gore, or cheap predictable pops to maintain the action.
(Although there is gore, and creative gore at that, it doesn't become a crutch)
7.  This movie has total party value.  Classics work in the context of being home alone at night, and having a bunch of people hanging around drinking beers.  Church had my friends saying ""Oh ..., rewind that!""
8.  The special effects are clever and impressive.  I didn't see the climax coming simply because I didn't even think that any film made on a horror budget could afford something that dope.
9.  You get to see Asia Argento act as a young kid  (even back then, writer Dario Argento had his little girl being menaced by demons and abusive fathers)
10.  The failure in the plot doesn't wholly distract you from what's going on.  For the most part, the little cracks in the plot help the uneasy feel of the movie, especially when you're watching it at 1 o'clock in the morning.
  With respect to the horror experts, I think that many of them have a bias against any Italian horror film that wasn't made during the classic era of Italian horror (Church was made in the 80's, and to be fair, horror movies ... big time in the 80's)
Horror critics have a inclination to like something more if it belongs to a genre, or has a cult name director.

7953005,5,B00005RYLA,"Warning: SPOILERS!!! This is one of the last truly great Italian horror films of the 1980's, known better for its dream-like visuals than its plot. After this film was made, demand for Italian-made genre films dipped to an all-time low and it never recovered (except for films made by Dario Argento [he produced and co-wrote this film, as well as contributing to its music score] and, especially, Bruno Mattei, who refused to admit defeat, churning-out sleazy genre films until his death in 2007, bless his heart!). Even though this film makes very little sense, I'll try to explain it:
  During the Medieval Ages, a military religious order called the Teutonic Knights invade a village and kill everyone in it, all because one young girl was accused of being a witch (she has a wound on the sole of her foot shaped like an upside-down cross). All the villagers are buried in a mass grave; a huge stone cross is put on top of the mass grave to ensure their demon souls will never rise in the land of the living. To make especially sure this will never happen, a church is to be built on top of the grave.
  Cut to the present day, where Evan (Tomas Arana; BODY PUZZLE - 1992) is starting his first day as a librarian at a church (guess which one). His job is to catalog all the ancient manuscripts and books in the church's library. He meets Lisa (Barbara Cupisti; THE NEW YORK RIPPER - 1982), who is restoring the church's many grotesque frescoes. Evan also meets teenager Lotte (Asia Argento; MOTHER OF TEARS - 2007), who looks exactly like a young girl that was killed by one of the Knights in the film's opening minutes. But what does that mean? While doing some restoration in the church basement, Lisa discovers an ancient parchment that was hidden in a hole in the wall. She brings the parchment to Evan, who tells her that this is a ""once in a lifetime"" find and to tell no one that it exists. Evan is not able to decipher the parchment, but he recognizes a symbol on it that represents the Teutonic Knights (Evan tells Lisa that Hitler created the SS based on the Knights' practices). Lisa and Evan start a romantic relationship, which they must keep secret from the Bishop (Feodor Chaliapin; INFERNO - 1980) and the Reverend (Giovanni Lombardo Radice; CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD - 1980), otherwise they will be fired from their jobs. Evan is determined to translate the parchment (He also wonders why this church doesn't have a king or bishop buried within its walls, like all the other big Catholic churches. The only people buried there are the church's builders.), when he discovers that the parchment was written in a long-forgotten language that has been mirrored, so he uses a mirror to translate it. It tells him that he must find the ""stone with the seven eyes"". But why?
  Evan begins searching through the church's library for a mention of the stone and it is at this time when nearly everyone in the church, including Father Gus (Hugh Quarshie; NIGHTBREED - 1990), begin seeing and hearing things (like the sound of horses running down the pews) that can't possibly be there. Evan finds the stone on the giant crucifix that guards the mass grave and he removes it. Big Mistake. A hole opens up in the shape of a giant cross, a hole which may travel down to the abyss of Hell. Adam pulls a shroud out of the hole which contains the remains of a Knight who fell in the mass grave and it suddenly comes to life, its decomposing hand squeezing Evan's neck, when it suddenly stops. It is obvious Evan is now possessed by some demon entity (he rips open his chest and pulls out his own heart, yet he doesn't die!). He then kills Lotte's father, Hermann, the Sacristan (Roberto Corbiletto; a Sacristan is a person in charge of the church's sacred vessels, vestments, etc.), who has come to the church basement looking for Lotte (earlier in the film, he calls Lotte a slut and accuses her of drinking). It is at this time that the film loses its linear narrative, as it turns into sequences of WTF?!? horror.
  Lisa sees a goatman monster (an image usually associated with the Devil) in her bedroom window (which then shatters) and calls the police. When they arrive, all they see is a scared woman. Lotte witnesses a possessed Evan trying to rape Lisa and she acts like nothing is wrong (as a matter of fact, she paints her nails in front of Evan!). Evan goes all SHINING-like by typing the number ""6"" over and over on his typewriter and then tries to kill Lotte, but she escapes and runs into her father, who is now possessed. He washes her mouth out with soap (!) for daring to speak ill of Evan. After trying to kill Father Gus in a confessional, Hermann commits suicide  in the church basement by impaling himself with a jackhammer (!), his flowing blood triggering an ancient booby-trap that puts the entire church in lockdown, trapping everyone inside. This includes a bridal model (Antonella Vitale) on a professional photo shoot; a biker named Freddie (Roberto Caruso) and his girlfriend Mira (Olivia Cupisti); a school full of young children on a tour of the church; and an old couple, Heinrich (John Karlsen) and his wife (Katherine Bell Marjorie).
  It's not long before some of the trapped inhabitants become demons (This film was originally going to be titled DEMONS 3, a second sequel to Lamberto Bava's DEMONS [1985], but the director did not want this film to be associated with that film because his film was not ""pizza schlock""!). The bridal model is bloodily impaled by the spikes of an iron gate wielded by a reanimated Hermann. Freddie sees a naked Mira in the grip of a religious statue of a winged angel come to life (an image taken from a famous Boris Vallejo painting, but this image has been used in many religious horror films, including CURSE IV: THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE [a.k.a. CATACOMBS - 1988], also featuring Feodor Chaliapin). The Bishop is aware of what is going on, telling Father Gus that this wasn't the first time this has happened, but when Father Gus is not satisfied with his explanation, especially when the Bishop says, ""I am the church!"", they get into a scuffle, which results in the Bishop falling to his death, impaled on a sharp grave marker. Mira falls through a hole in the church floor, hanging on to Freddie's grip, but she has her face and brains splattered against the window of a traveling subway car! Much more weird stuff happens, including Lisa tearing the skin off her face when she sees herself as an old hag in a mirror. There is also an appearance of a gooey lizard/demon/gargoyle creature., but you'll be saying the same thing as Father Gus, when he yells out, ""I don't understand!"", but I guarantee you'll never be bored.
  Directed by Michele Soavi of STAGEFRIGHT (1987) and CEMETERY MAN (1994; one of the few Italian horror films to obtain a U.S. theatrical release in the '90s) fame, with a script by Soavi, Dario Argento (FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET - 1971; DRACULA 3D - 2012), Franco Ferrini ([TERROR AT THE] OPERA - 1987) & five other uncredited writers, this film may not make much sense but, man, is it beautiful to look at! It is very bloody in spots (including a beheading and various impalements) and eerily atmospheric, but I love it because it is a feast for the eyes.
  Originally released uncut and Unrated on fullscreen VHS by Southgate Entertainment in 1991, with a widescreen, uncut DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2002 and again by Blue Underground in 2007. But the Blu-Ray, from Scorpion Releasing (released early in 2018), is the preferred way of viewing this film. The print is flawless and the colors pop, making it look better than it ever has before. It's also a hoot to see Asia Argento at such a young age (she was 15 when this film was made, but she looks much younger). The extras on the Blu-Ray include new 2017 interviews with Michele Soavi and Asia Argento, both informative. We discover that Soavi painted the church's grotesque frescoes and he tried to copy the style of Netherlandish painter Hieronymus Bosch (he succeeded) and that it was filmed at a real church in Budapest (Soavi tried to film it at a church in Nuremberg, Germany, but the town didn't want a horror film to be made there. There are still some scenes in the film that were shot there). Soavi also explains that the late Keith Emerson did the music soundtrack, but, even though his music was beautiful, it didn't fit within in the confines or the ""feel"" of the film, so the soundtrack was composed and recorded by The Goblins, who also did the music for Dario Argento's DEEP RED (1975), SUSPIRIA (1977) and many other Italian genre films. Asia Argento remembers that the church had to be deconsecrated every morning so they could film the ""most heinous things"". She also says that when she was a kid, she was not easily shocked. With a father like Dario, I can understand why. She also remembers that Antonella Vitale, the Bridal Model, was her father's girlfriend at the time. Asia looks at her horror film career with reverence and humor, which is refreshing. If you want to see one of the last truly great Italian horror films, search out this Blu-Ray, which can be found on Amazon. Also starring Alina De Simone, Claire Hardwick, Lars Jorgenson, John Richardson and a blink and you'll miss it cameo by Michele Soavi as a cop. Not Rated.",1524268800,,9320,4.6297640653357535

However you are doing yourself a disservice if you watch it through the Shudder streaming. What a pile, the transfer is awful, the video quality is awful, the sound is garbled and flanges in and out. All of those things of course could be forgivable if this was the good cut of the film. What Shudder presents (mind you a channel curated by horror nerds, for horror nerds) is the neutered, toothless version of this movie that was made to abide by censorship laws in the 90s so it could hit the states. Please, please, please Shudder give us gorehounds the good versions this movie as well as other old Spaghetti splatters. It feels like you guys are gaslighting my childhood here.",1523059200,,772,4.443661971830986

7953008,5,B00005RYLA,"Michele Soavi's 1989 sophomore directorial effort ""The Church"" (a.k.a. ""Cathedral of Demons"" and ""Demon Cathedra"") finally makes its stateside blu-ray debut by Scorpion Releasing. Beautifully filmed, gothic in tone and a bit nonsensical in typical 80's Italian horror fashion, ""The Church"" has a lot to offer fans of vintage horror of that memorable decade. Co-written and produced by Italian horror legend Dario Argento and also co-starring his daughter Asia Argento who was only 14 at the time, while it might not always make sense it more than makes up for in style and atmosphere.

""The Church"" had been released on region B blu-ray back in 2016 by Shameless Films which featured a new 2K scan of the original negative. Scorpion Releasing used this transfer as the basis for their North American blu-ray release while also doing additional color correction. Presented in its original 1.66:1 aspect ratio, the film looks breathtakingly spectacular. The bit rate stays high in the mid 30's and detail is impeccable. It is truly like seeing the film again for the first time. No digital scrubbing was done so it retains a natural grain structure. It is also featured its full 1 hour 42 minute uncensored director's cut. Audio is presented in 2 channel master audio.

Extras include a 19 minute interiew with Michele Soavi, a little less than 9 minute interview with Asia Argento and some trailers.

""The Church"" is a visually wonderful slice of classic Italian horror that makes its stateside blu-ray release in style thanks to Scorpion Releasing. Highly recommend!",1521504000,6,1566,5.109375
7953009,3,B00005RYLA,Surreal Italian horror film about a cursed church.  There are logic and continuity problems and the first half moves pretty slowly but otherwise a pretty good movie.,1518307200,,165,5.111111111111111
7953010,1,B00005RYLA,"Sighs this movie I just sighs again don't know how to really describe it.

I'll try though.

This movie was incoherent throughout one of the absolute worst movies.

The insane things that happened in this movie should have scared me but instead it left me scratching my head going wtf did I just watch?!!!

The movie was nuts there was no coherence to anything in this film it was more hilariously bad then terrifying or scary in any capacity.",1518048000,,443,4.569620253164557
7953011,5,B00005RYLA,"Love Love Love this movie.  First had it on VHS, somebody stole it.  Then had it on DVD, somebody stole it.  No one will borrow this one from me.  Makes no sense at all, but that is part of its charm for me.  Just plenty of laughable acting and plenty of GOO.  With a train surprise that should go down in gore history.  So if your a fan of that type of movie, then this one is for you.  If not.........",1515024000,,403,3.888888888888889
