5724948,3,B00CKZ6JJY,"I like the DVDs, but I just can't get those darn cables to work.  I'm really disappointed, as that was the main reason I bought this set.  I had wanted the extra workout using the cables, as I already own so many Leslie DVDs.",1452556800,5,225,4.090909090909091
5724949,2,B00CKZ6JJY,"Leslie's newer DVDs have all had the option to do the workout to music only, without Leslie's narration. When you do workout DVDs over and over, it's nice to have this option. I don't know why it wasn't put on these DVDs, I'm very disappointed and won't be doing these workouts like Leslie's others....",1452038400,2,302,4.611111111111111
5724950,5,B00CKZ6JJY,"Just recently purchased this set! I LOVE LESLE SANSONE anyway...but I think this is one of THE BEST sets she has out there. I have to admit I haven't bought many new DVDs of hers for a while -- it was time for a change!!! This one is so worth it - includes: 4 DVDs: 1 mile, 2 mile, 3 mile, 4 mile and comes with tension cables. (what is cool about these is the ends are shaped like dumbells). The workout is tough on the 3 mile which I did the other day -- 45 minutes and I was sweatin' my booty off (the whole point, right)!
You can't go wrong with this set it gives you a little of everything that Leslie does. There are some new things that spice the workout up a bit. After using the same old DVDs for so long -- it was nice to get Leslie in a new setting and new steps.
These are for beginners to avid workouts -- if you don't feel like heading out to the gym - pop one of these DVDs in and off you go!",1451520000,13,907,3.804232804232804

5724953,5,B00CKZ6JJY,"I think this is the best dvd I own and I have several. The boost cables are the best. I feel stronger and I can't wait to see how much my arms will change with this workout. It is not for the weak, I have cables at its lightest point. And  I still struggle with  some of  exercises. I can't do some because it strained my neck so much I couldn't move for couple days.  It was my fault, trying to be super woman. This dvd  will  make you sweat and the plus side you can adjust the cable to your level.",1410307200,15,500,3.8529411764705883

5724957,5,B00CKZ6JJY,"This is a great workout. There are 3 one mile walks to chose from. Which is nice if you are just starting out or in a hurry. Also a two mile a three mile  and a four mile walk on their own dvds. Advance up miles as you go along. Its called super walks referring to the nice fitness bands with handles that attach to your shoes, you use these for some nice resistance training during the super walk.:) love the down a hundred mile and the super mom mile. I have not done the meal plan just because I am focusing on the exercise but it does sound simple and doable. This was definitely worth the money. I would and have given Leslie WAH videos to friends and family. I have lost 50 lbs in a year with Gods help and just doing videos and eating less.",1380585600,41,747,4.047297297297297

I've always enjoyed Leslie Sansone, the only thing is I wish she would have had s group or couple of others do the walk boost cables with her instead of by herself.. It's always fun to walk with a group. But it's always a good walk with Leslie Sansone!",1461196800,,337,4.121212121212121

5724970,5,B00CKZ6JJY,"Unlike some I am fairly new to Leslie's videos. In fact, I purchased one long ago and like many work out vids it sat on the shelf for far too long. Finally, one day after really feeling something in my state of mind shift, I realized that I NEEDED to get myself up and moving. I NEEDED to shed the baby weight that I had been carrying around for years (my youngest being 3 now) and do something about how my low energy and lack of motivation. Leslie has been the key for me. I'm only about one month in, and I can honestly say that already I am feeling not only much more energized, but simply better about myself and I find that I look forward to walking every day. I have not done more than two miles in one stretch yet, but even those two miles are becoming easier and easier by the day. My daughters (especially my 8 year old) enjoy walking with me sometimes, and I take pride in knowing that I am setting a good example for them by taking care of myself, as it is not just for me that I do this, but for THEM. So that they have a Mommy who can better keep up with them. A Mommy who encourages them to be active. I am NOT a person who has EVER worked out. I am the right now the heaviest I have ever been at over 200 lbs. BUT I am positive and looking forward to the future and the changes that my body will go through just from these videos alone. I had only purchased two of Leslie's other videos before this, and already this set is my favorite. The option of 3 different 1 mile walks is fantastic. The other day, even when my allergies were kicking my butt, I got up and did the gentle mile and it was just enough to perk me up and energize me without having to break a sweat. This morning I did the 2 mile with the boost cables, and I LOVE the idea that I can tone without needing to lug around heavy weights. I have no aspirations of being a bodybuilder, I just with to firm things that have begun to droop now in my early 40s. I plan to come back and edit this review in the future, after I have used all the videos so as to give a more accurate opinion on the set as a whole, but so far I am LOVING it. Thank you so much, Leslie.

***Update***
Still loving these dvds. My favorite is the 2 mile, as it is fast and effective, but I have done the 3 mile and I like to still shake things up with the various one mile vids at different times of the day. I don't usually weigh myself, so I can't say whether I have altered the number on the scale, BUT my clothing is fitting looser in places already and overall I have much more energy, which is what I was wanting above all else. I love the boost cables, I love the variety, all around still really loving this set. :)",1460678400,9,2676,3.983240223463687

5724976,5,B00CKZ6JJY,An amazing walk!!  I like that each walk is on a different DVD.  You can choose which one to do according to your amount of time available.  Each one is a great workout.,1458432000,,169,4.0606060606060606
5724977,3,B00CKZ6JJY,Love this workout but the cables are cheap and broke during the first use! Disappointing but not a big deal since I just use dumb bells or a stretchie band instead.,1458086400,2,164,4.32258064516129

5724980,3,B00CKZ6JJY,Second time using the body boost cables and thank God no one was in the room because the elastic broke and it went flying. They seem cheaply made and obviously not safe unless you go and sew them yourself before use...wonder if Leslie's are cheap like that (probably not...) I really enjoy her videos and this is the 4th set I have. I love that she isn't using fitness models and using actual walkers that use her program.,1457568000,10,422,4.423076923076923
5724981,5,B00CKZ6JJY,I've been using Leslie's Walk at Home workouts for many years.  This is another favorite for toning and strength training in addition to the cardio.,1457308800,,148,4.92
5724982,5,B00CKZ6JJY,"Super walks is the best one yet! I do the meal plan and its easy and quick and perfect!! I use the 2 lb weight belt with all the walk dvd's and get great results!! I have lost 14 pounds so far with the meal plan and cables. I have even gotten off the meal plan and still not gain.  Instead of 2 scoops of ice cream, I do only one and that's it! I really, really recommend this program. When I saw the meal plan and she shows you how to cook it!! I told my husband, ""I can do this!"" My husband likes the meals too! and he is losing weight as well. THIS WORKS!!",1456963200,11,559,3.7777777777777777

5724986,5,B00CKZ6JJY,I am enjoying these exercises. I like the people that have lost weight doing the exercises and the nutrition information. I am a fan of Leslie Sansone and enjoyed using the bands. It was a nice way to mix it up and get some resistance work in too. I recommend it to anyone that is a beginner or a seasoned veteran to exercise.,1453852800,5,326,4.190476190476191
5724987,5,B00CKZ6JJY,This 4 disc set by Leslie Sansone is one of her best. It includes body Boost Cables and a 21 day meal plan. As usual Leslie is very encouraging and upbeat. Her enthusiasm makes me want to get off the couch and walk. The cast of walkers she brings with her are very inspirational with most of them stating a weight loss of 100+ pounds. The body Boost Cables really add a challenge to these work outs. Also the music is great. She brings with her a lot of new music not previously heard on some of her older walk work outs. All in all I would have to say these DVDs are some of her best yet!,1453852800,14,589,4.0

Love her videos and usually do not purchase the products because I can just YouTube what I need; however, I bought this for the exercise equipment that came with it. I love all the items that come with it; however, the equipment did not have great instructions to put together and I still haven't taken the time to do so because of that.

8582853,5,B00CKZ6JJY,I had this workout when it first came out and loved it.  After years of use the bands broke.  I could not buy them anywhere.  Desperate I wrote the company.  They said they were no longer making them.  You can imagine how surprised I was when I saw them recently on Amazon. They are a little different but not much. It is and has always been my favorite workout. Leslie Sansone's are the only workouts I use. I couldn't be happier.,1470700800,,431,4.271604938271605

With this kit you also get the added bonus of the booster cables and meal plan. You can choose from 2, 3, 4, mile walks and mini walks, for when you are short on time. They are good workouts. Leslie will make you sweat! The booster cables are easy to use.",1469232000,,361,4.098591549295775
