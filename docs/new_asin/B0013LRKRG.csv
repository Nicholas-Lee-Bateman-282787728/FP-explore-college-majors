3116679,5,B0013LRKRG,"This was a good story, and good screen play... It got a bit bogged down in the late middle, and while wasting time waiting for Ace to find his way home, I think watching Ace win the Championship with Julie and Ace working together. But a Great movie to watch and watch again.",1216512000,,275,4.2075471698113205
3116680,5,B0013LRKRG,THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE OF ITS TYPE IN A LONG TIME. MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH ENJOYED IT. AND IT IS A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE,1212451200,5,114,3.423076923076923
3116681,5,B0013LRKRG,"This is one of the best German Shepherd movies I've ever seen in my life. In fact, it's probably THE best! Ace is so smart. He displays both emotion and spectacular acting feasts. The plot is based on a true story. Julia and Dan are both great actress and actor, respectively. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves dogs, esp. German shepherds. My second favorite is Rain by Scott Cooper. Then the K9.",1212364800,4,406,4.5
3116682,5,B0013LRKRG,"Okay so I'm a sucker for dog movies.....and Dean Cain.  Originally I bought this movie because I'm a die-hard Dean Cain fan, but I am a sucker for any movies with or about dogs, so I got double the fun for my money.

This is an all around good movie.  I grew up in a family that raises and shows dogs, so I related to both the girl's and dad's feelings.  This movie is a cute, entertaining tell of a girl who sets out to cear her father's police dog/her dog companion name and save him.

What I find even more interesting is that my dog even sat down and literally watched this movie with me, all the canine interaction, I guess, got his attention.

This is a great family film and a must for any dog lover!",1212278400,37,707,4.086956521739131
3116683,5,B0013LRKRG,"I am a sucker for any movie with a dog in it...I guess I have been since the days of Benji!

This movie has a great storyline that deals with a girl's search for the truth to save her beloved dog, Ace.  Good acting and the whole family will enjoy.

The girl in the movie is a type of junior detective and the studio put together a wonderful ""Junior Detectives Guide"" to accompany the film.  My kids worked through it after watching it over the weekend and had fun doing it: [...]

I recommend this movie.",1210204800,19,504,4.208333333333333
3116684,4,B0013LRKRG,"Ace is a member of a k-9 unit and one of the top in his field for getting the bad guys.  Dan is a dad that sometimes is so protective of his canine partner that he spends more time with the dog than his teenage daughter or his wife.  It doesn't take long to see that Ace respects Dan more than any of the other family members...even taking over dan's wife side of the bed.  This leads to stress in both relationships as wife and daughter feel they are always second best to the dog.

Unfortunately on one occasion, Ace gets blamed for attacking a theif named Torko's throat.  The lacking evidence to the crime that Ace chased him down for protrays the criminal as an innocent bystander attacked by a vicious dog.  This leads to Ace being sent to be put down or Torko's lawyer will press charges. The caring handler that Dan is...decides to drive him there with dignity since Ace is distressed to be apart from him.

Pair a smart canine with an inept employee and a blessing of an escape results where Ace must find his way home. In the meantime, both Dan and his daughter Julia try to clear Ace's name while dealing with both grief, ashes labeled as Ace, and evidence that leaves the possibility that Ace is alive.

Definitely a heartwarming animal story here of a dog that steals hearts. My only disappointment was there were no dvd extras...just trailers of other dvd movies.  It would have been interesting to see how they trained the dog, additional scenes, story background, actor's comments and more.",1210204800,22,1506,4.527675276752768

3116748,1,B0013LRKRG,"I saw this recommendation based on my Christian movie preference, so I purchased it. After sitting through the ridiculous trailers, and then after 2 minutes of watching this, I realized it is ""hollywood christian"". Nothing but boob cleavage. I am so sick and tired of seeing other women in ways we were never supposed to. I keep my own set modest and it makes me sick when other women flaunt theirs for all to see. I am forced to see it in this pathetic world we live in, I do NOT want to see it in what was supposed to be a Christian movie. A police chief shown sitting on the potty, legs wide open with his shirttails just covering himself, and a barely clothed calendar gal in the forefront of a scene at a biker shop makes the rest of this movie complete trash and not suitable for anyone. Dove really needs to adjust their approval to match our Saviors ideals and not the de-sensitized view of this world. And if Dean Cain chooses to act in a movie like this, he doesn't belong in Christian movies at all.",1515024000,3,1010,4.321052631578947

3116897,4,B0013LRKRG,"This is a good movie for kids and dog lovers.  Well acted.  The plot has a K-9 dog doing his job capturing a bad guy, being accused of attacking a innocent man and being ordered to be put down.  The dog escapes and has a few adventures while trying to get back home where the police officer partner and his daughter are trying to prove his innocence.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars for this because of some shakey plot lines, but decided if you don't delve into specifics it is an entertaining family film.",1401753600,,509,4.216494845360825
3116898,5,B0013LRKRG,this is a very heartwarming story. The dog is very smart and he continues to do the job he was trained for even after the Humans think they are done.,1400630400,,149,4.0
3116899,4,B0013LRKRG,"A very nice little story about a family and their K9 cop dog.  mostly focusing on the Dad and 13 year old daughter, the story pretends that it really is about the dog. The girl is believable (despite burglarizing a house which seems totally out of character for her). The dog is well trained like any good German Shepherd though he does nothing special except to accept everyone's admiration and love.  The Dad starts out as a negligent moron ignoring his great daughter who wants his attention, but he comes around as expected in a feel-good movie.  This is appropriate for pre-teens who love animals, though it might give them ideas (LOL!).",1397260800,3,642,4.714285714285714

3116901,3,B0013LRKRG,I was looking for a family friendly film but was somewhat disappointed. Not sure why the filmmaker thought it necessary to have Ace open the bathroom door while the Chief of Police was sitting on the potty. His shirt tails are covering him enough but I felt this scene was very inappropriate and unnecessary in the film. The scene was too long as well. I liked the rest of the movie well enough but would not show this film to children.,1394496000,2,436,4.395061728395062

3116928,4,B0013LRKRG,"While I doubt this movie is ""based on a true story"", ACE OF HEARTS is an entertaining family film.  Dean Cain, Britt McKillip and Anne Louise DeLuise make a convincing family and Mike Dopud is a vile villain.  Of course, Ace is a loveable hero.  The biggest flaw comes when the daughter breaks into the villain's home to gather evidence.  Any LAW AND ORDER junkie knows this evidence could never be admissible!
But kids don't know that so I'll forgive them for that faux pas!

A stupid jerk cop with a genius daughter who is able to figure everything out by looking on Wikipedia. This cop lets his dog be put to sleep for biting a guy's throat before checking the stupid security camera that proved he didn't. And why was there a security camera there anyway?

This is an all around good movie.  I grew up in a family that raises and shows dogs, so I related to both the girl's and dad's feelings.  This movie is a cute, entertaining tell of a girl who sets out to cear her father's police dog/her dog companion name and save him.

What I find even more interesting is that my dog even sat down and literally watched this movie with me, all the canine interaction, I guess, got his attention.

This is a great family film and a must for any dog lover!",1212278400,37,707,4.086956521739131

3351181,4,B0013LRKRG,"Ace is a member of a k-9 unit and one of the top in his field for getting the bad guys.  Dan is a dad that sometimes is so protective of his canine partner that he spends more time with the dog than his teenage daughter or his wife.  It doesn't take long to see that Ace respects Dan more than any of the other family members...even taking over dan's wife side of the bed.  This leads to stress in both relationships as wife and daughter feel they are always second best to the dog.

Unfortunately on one occasion, Ace gets blamed for attacking a theif named Torko's throat.  The lacking evidence to the crime that Ace chased him down for protrays the criminal as an innocent bystander attacked by a vicious dog.  This leads to Ace being sent to be put down or Torko's lawyer will press charges. The caring handler that Dan is...decides to drive him there with dignity since Ace is distressed to be apart from him.

Pair a smart canine with an inept employee and a blessing of an escape results where Ace must find his way home. In the meantime, both Dan and his daughter Julia try to clear Ace's name while dealing with both grief, ashes labeled as Ace, and evidence that leaves the possibility that Ace is alive.

Definitely a heartwarming animal story here of a dog that steals hearts. My only disappointment was there were no dvd extras...just trailers of other dvd movies.  It would have been interesting to see how they trained the dog, additional scenes, story background, actor's comments and more.",1210204800,22,1506,4.527675276752768

After sitting through the ridiculous trailers, and then after 2 minutes of watching this, I realized it is ""hollywood christian"". Nothing but boob cleavage. I am so sick and tired of seeing other women in ways we were never supposed to. I keep my own set modest and it makes me sick when other women flaunt theirs for all to see. I am forced to see it in this pathetic world we live in, I do NOT want to see it in what was supposed to be a Christian movie. A police chief shown sitting on the potty, legs wide open with his shirttails just covering himself, and a barely clothed calendar gal in the forefront of a scene at a biker shop makes the rest of this movie complete trash and not suitable for anyone. Dove really needs to adjust their approval to match our Saviors ideals and not the de-sensitized view of this world.

The Dad starts out as a negligent moron ignoring his great daughter who wants his attention, but he comes around as expected in a feel-good movie.

Dean Cain, Britt McKillip and Anne Louise DeLuise make a convincing family and Mike Dopud is a vile villain.  Of course, Ace is a loveable hero.  The biggest flaw comes when the daughter breaks into the villain's home to gather evidence.  Any LAW AND ORDER junkie knows this evidence could never be admissible!
But kids don't know that so I'll forgive them for that faux pas!
ACE OF HEARTS is entertaining for family viewing.",1364169600,,525,4.612903225806452
3351426,5,B0013LRKRG,This is great for kids and grownups alike.  It is based on true events and it's a real family affair.  Dad needed to learn what is more important in a family.  It came about in a very interesting manner.  Of course two teens have to get in the middle it and help solve the case for dad.  I loved this one and I believe you will to.,1362096000,5,331,3.8805970149253732

3351447,1,B0013LRKRG,"What part of this was ""based on a true story""? That there was once a cop with a police dog? What's this movie about? A stupid jerk cop with a genius daughter who is able to figure everything out by looking on Wikipedia. This cop lets his dog be put to sleep for biting a guy's throat before checking the stupid security camera that proved he didn't. And why was there a security camera there anyway? It would have been pointed at nothing. And the dumb doctors can't tell between a self inflicted wound and a dog bite? I don't think I need to go on.",1259193600,11,548,4.179245283018868
