5856555,5,B00DUG2YI2,Good instructions and still viewing the information.,1411257600,,52,6.571428571428571
5856556,2,B00DUG2YI2,"Not a very good video.  Dont waste your money on it.  This is more of a sales pitch for their homes they build.  First they tell you not to do your own plumbing... and then tell you how easy and fun it can be.  Huh.... The video does not answer many questions and leaves out details like how to put in a metal roofing screw which is critical to putting on a roof that will not leak.  I am building my own tiny home and have built my own house before and if I did not know anything about building a house I would be lost with this video.  Maybe I will write a book that will help people who know nothing about building a tiny house to give then the knowledge they need to know.  They mention nothing about calculating the weight of the building for the trailer which is critical to building a house on a weight restricted.  Get some good books on DIY house framing, electrical,and plumbing and you will be far better off.  Also they mention something about using a solar panel and having a 12v water heater which gives the impression you can heat your water with the solar panel. This is not only foolish but a waste of a solar panel.  Not clear or well directed.",1404950400,14,1162,4.193693693693693
5856557,5,B00DUG2YI2,"To begin, I am an engineer by education and profession.  I've had my eye on building a 'Tiny House' for years - but reading through fragmented blogs and short 'how-to' guides on the web was not giving me the information I needed to be confident in a build by myself.  I'm a visual learner and this DVD was EXCELLENT.  Sure, a bit pricey, but it will save you a ton of money and design mistakes as you build.  Even if you don't want to build yourself, but choose to buy one of the companies ready-built models, it would be so neat to know how your home was constructed.  Also the video looks very professional and audio good.  Back to building now!",1383177600,5,647,4.305785123966942
5856558,5,B00DUG2YI2,"To begin this review: the price is to high. I thought the DVD had a lot of good information, I thought they could have showed more. It does go by detail and good direction! I ran cross the Tumbleweed company through a google search on living cheaper! I sure, think it is a neat idea but you really can't leave in it do to building codes!",1378684800,,337,4.121212121212121
8597896,5,B00DUG2YI2,Fast shipping and a super helpful video!,1510617600,,40,4.857142857142857
8597897,5,B00DUG2YI2,"A very good DVD for those who want to go small and live minimal, it is a start in the right direction.",1509148800,,102,3.6818181818181817
8597898,5,B00DUG2YI2,If you want to build your own tiny house this DVD is for you. Easy to use and quick ship,1486512000,,88,3.45
8597899,3,B00DUG2YI2,Ok DVD but it had been a lot more intresting if it had contained moore details. It gives good general information. But in my case it did not give so much more info than I already had.,1482364800,,183,3.972972972972973
8597900,4,B00DUG2YI2,"Good detail for all skill levels.
Well explained especially in the roof gable details.
Worth the money",1480982400,,102,5.0588235294117645
8597901,5,B00DUG2YI2,"This video is a must see for anyone wanting to build their own tiny house or buying one already made to order. The only way to really appreciate the thoughts and concerns the Tumbleweed Company put into designing and building these homes is to watch this video. The do it yourself er will pick up ideas, and reasons, about aspects of the building process that ordinarily wouldn't have been thought of.",1465776000,,401,4.661971830985915
8597902,5,B00DUG2YI2,"I'm watching right now and I feel like  I could build my tiny house with these instuctions. Sure, they're trying to sell their products. But to me this is a great DVD. They're going step by step. I'm up to the doors and windows, and so far I really like it. I might have paid full price for the DVD, but I got it free when I signed up for the workshop. Who knows, I may be able to figure out the  master Amish carpentry thing.",1433203200,,426,3.941860465116279
8597903,4,B00DUG2YI2,I wish it had gone in more depth about electrical and plumbing rough-in and options for electric and water hook-up. A good video none the less. Perhaps if it had a resource guide at the end.,1423785600,,190,4.305555555555555
8597904,5,B00DUG2YI2,"I thought this DVD was an excellent resource for anyone attempting to build their own tiny house, or just doing research on what it takes. The video edits down a two-week build by the Fisher brothers as they build a tiny house from trailer to roof ridge, with all of the details discussed in between. I also enjoyed their guest experts, people they brought in for aspects of the project that were beyond their abilities. The ""Tool Talk"" segments, where the cohosts would discuss the various tools and components you might need for a particular stage of the build, such as plumbing or electrical, were also useful.

One unexpected thing I picked up from the video was witnessing the quality of craftsmanship that the Fisher brothers, who grew up in an Amish woodworking family, brought to the project. I am very meticulous myself, but I wouldn't hesitate to have them build my house! No detail escaped them, and this is all captured on film and explained to the viewer. As this is the crew that builds all of Tumbleweed's houses, I was truly impressed by the level of quality they bring to their work.

The end of the DVD has interviews with the cohosts, Art Cormier and Meg Stevens, as well as the Fisher family and the CEO of Tumbleweed, Steve Weissmann. You get to learn about what drew them to tiny houses and their stories will probably echo some of your own reasons for being a fan of them yourself.

Highly recommended!",1422748800,5,1425,4.624505928853755
