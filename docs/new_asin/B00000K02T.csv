Many of the most recent discoveries about the natural history and behavior of the various species of crocodilians of the world are documented in this film.  There are scenes of crocodiles running, yes, running.  These poikilothermic, or cold blooded animals were not previously thought to move in this rather warm blooded way.  Other cool behaviors displayed in this film are the previously documented parenting and maternal care of the mother crocodiles, from mating to laying eggs to helping the hatchlings down to the water.  Another excellent segment is shown in night vision cinematography, and the subject is caimans in South America during the drought season.  One mother caiman brings her young on a nocturnal voyage to another pond, as theirs was drying out.  Several kilometers she leads them, deposits them, and they are adopted by another resident female.  Fascinating.

I wish this was out on DVD, as I do not now own a VHS player.

All in all, it is an excellent piece of natural history.",1173312000,,1182,5.01025641025641
