Two days after my purchase (when the DVD was en-route), I was notified that I purchased a worthless product.",1461542400,,265,4.541666666666667
8689796,1,B00PYEZDZ4,Wish we could have watched this but the captions were built into the movie and completely unreadable -- white and small on mostly light backgrounds. So disappointing.,1443830400,,166,5.185185185185185

8689800,5,B00PYEZDZ4,"Great documentary illustrating the lengths children in other countries go to get an education.  Dragging a wheelchair for miles, running from elephants, hitchhiking and riding horses through mountaintops are just a few of the feats these small kids take on to get an education.  I hope they are all able to conquer their dreams with ease and happiness as they are some determined, hard working individuals.",1438128000,2,406,5.136363636363637
8689801,5,B00PYEZDZ4,"This is an incredible documentary. You know the old joke about how grandpa had to walk to school in the snow, up hill, both ways, barefoot? Those stories have nothing on what these kids go through. The film follows what four kids from different parts of the world have to go through each day just to get to school. No matter what you think you're going to see, it's even more astounding and unexpected. The personal motivation and drive these kids have and what they have to go through just to get to class each morning is inspiring. After watching this, you will never again complain about your commute to work. Such a great film!",1434326400,6,631,4.495652173913044
