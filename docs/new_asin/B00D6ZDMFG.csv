8590153,2,B00D6ZDMFG,Not very good. It was just worth it because of Dougray Scott acting. His talent is wasted on this film,1464048000,,102,4.15
8590154,3,B00D6ZDMFG,It is a good film you just have to work for it a bit in order to piece the entirety of the concept together.,1438992000,,108,3.5416666666666665
8590155,3,B00D6ZDMFG,Didn't really like it except for Dougray Scott. Just wasn't for me.,1417737600,,67,4.666666666666667

8590157,5,B00D6ZDMFG,"It's hard not to look at the character of Ludwig Giroux and not see a portrait of Leonard Cohen...not the man he isa much more encompassing work would be needed to do justice to thatbut the night owl prowler ladies' man persona that he has created and played with ingeniously his whole life. A lumpenproletariat Mephistopheles that would bring pride to F, the sexually magnetic villain hero of Cohen's sadly unrecognized classic novel Beautiful Losers.
The lifelong interaction between a woman and an artistwhat more fitting tribute could there be to our beloved Bard of Montreal.",1415750400,,580,5.052083333333333

8590159,5,B00D6ZDMFG,"Fascinating thriller that is representation of of what is happening in a therapy room - in a action based version of reality.  I young woman (Jodi Whittaker) is going back in time, trying to face her traumatic love affair with her love of her life - a jazz player (Dougray Scott).",1386201600,4,280,4.490196078431373
8590160,3,B00D6ZDMFG,"This one was hard to follow.  A young girl goes back in time, via and elevator or lift as they called it in the movie, to somehow correct mistakes she had made in her life that made her jump from her apartment window - suicide.  Using the elevator to go back in time didn't really work - falling down a rabbit hole would have been more believable.  The acting was very believable, the script was just not up to the standard I was hoping for I guess.  My reason for selecting this movie was because Dougray Scott was in it - again, he is my crush for a while at least.  I didn't like his character and putting him in clown makeup was just so wrong for someone who is so handsome.  Nevertheless, I did like hearing Dougray's voice as he recited poetry from the film.  I would rewind the movie simply to hear his voice.  My recommendation for viewing this movie is to rent it first.",1382659200,5,879,4.221556886227545
