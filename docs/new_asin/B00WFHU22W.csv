I am so happy to be able to relive that incredible time.  These players used to talk to us walking along Broad Street in Richmond on their way to practice at the Siegel Center.  This film captures the Drive of this team which propelled the students, facualty & alumni to go much further than they ever thought they could.  I went straight to Manhattan for grad school living in Harlem near City College ... picturing each student there as VCU RAMS.  What they created in my soul can be felt thru this film... thank you, PHIL WALL!",1490745600,,656,4.572649572649572
