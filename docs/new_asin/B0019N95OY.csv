8274833,5,B0019N95OY,"Star Trek Voyager was my favorite of the series.  Just a bit too much Borg, Jennifer Lien could have been placed into a role more suitable for her & kept her thereas a main bridge crew member due to her brilliant acting skills NOT utilized (she was placed in the WRONG role), & some billionaire could have invested his money into expanding this series a bit more, but despite the budget restrictions (as always) Voyager was PERHAPS my fave after viewing all Star Trek series once again.  Kate Mulgrew did a most perfect captain.  She could NOT have been more perfect.  Some complained about the techobabble, but in my opinion, the science fiction was outstanding.  That is what I expect from a Star Trek series--SCIENCE fiction!  Any billionaire out there to invest money into a really good Voyager NG?  I am STILL waiting for the blu ray!!!!

How about another Star Trek with Data & some of our other favorite characters?  There should ALWAYS be a ""Data"" & a ""Spock"" on board a Star Trek star ship!  Billionaires wanted!",1436140800,,1021,4.653631284916201
8274834,5,B0019N95OY,"This series was the best they dealt with many issues they made the characters not so perfect in certain episodes,
 which in my opinion only made them more human. I wish they would bring back another series with at least one of the characters from Voyager playing captain.",1317168000,10,271,4.645833333333333
8274835,5,B0019N95OY,"I'm a die hard trekker.  I've seen every episode of every series minimum of three times and I'm as jaded as they come.  I'm here to tell you that seasons 4 to 7 of Star Trek Voyager are the best Treks in the entire franchise.  Seasons 1 to 3 are throwaways, punt them as needed unless you swoon for the ever-predictable moustache twirling Kazon or have the uncontrollable urge to Scotch-tape things into your hair.  Seasons 4 to 7 however are a sheer delight.  They overhauled the series and pretty much severed all ties to previous episodes.  There are lots of great Borg episodes, some great time travel episodes and a couple really good Q episodes too.  There are several recurring themes which are nurtured to perfection, among them the 7-of-9's struggle to regain her humanity, Voyager becoming technologically more advanced, and reestablishing communications with Starfleet which seems juuuuust out of reach.  Yeah there's a chick running the show but Janeway in the later seasons isn't the bubble-headed ""teenager in command"" she plays in the first three seasons but neither is she a cigar-chomping she-man.  Mulgrew nurtures her role of Janeway into a true leader and it's a marvel to behold.  The nameless doctor blossoms into a kind of blowhard with a heart which is a lot more fun to watch than it sounds.  7-of-9's struggle for humanity is every bit the story line Data's struggle for humanity was in The Next Generation.  Over the years Voyager has gotten a bad rap and as someone qualified to express an opinion:  Buy it, you'll be glad you did.",1262217600,56,1559,4.794007490636704
8274836,4,B0019N95OY,"After having the TOS (The Original Series) depicting the Enterprise and its crew traveling through space in their five year mission, after having Picard and the rest doing the same in the follow up installment The Next Generation, and after having a spin-off  based on a space station (DS9), the need (or craving) for something a little different became paramount (if you'll forgive the pun).
Star Trek: Voyager deals with a starship of the same name that, after trying to locate the whereabouts of Captain Janeway's security officer, Tuvok (a Vulcan), is pulled into the unexplored Delta quadrant by an alien that is seeking to procreate.
The show ties in with its predecessor DS9 in the very first episode, where some crew members arrive to their assigned posts in the doomed starship. From there on, our craving for a different Trek begins.
I will not spoil ti for those new to Voyager, but know this, after the first three seasons of interesting unconventional characters and situations, the series take on an awesome twist involving the Borg (an enemy established in The Next Generation). From here on, the series becomes almost a roller coaster ride.
Just imagine a ship that lost its first officer, the doctor, and other officers who end up being replaced by some members of the same outlaws Janeway sought out in the first place... and all in order to survive the 70 year trip home!
They are alone, there is no Starfleet, no starbases, no backup! They are on their own on their way back home. And add to the mix Star Trek signature story telling of complex issues and intrigue, and awesome mind boggling tales relating to death, survival, time traveling, and all the interpersonal issues of a crew on the verge. It is all told as only Trek can tell it.
The series counts with progressively great special effects for the time and interesting characters like the human-klingon hybrid Belana Torres, the Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH) Doctor who becomes a regular doctor, and one of my favorites... Seven of Nine (Human- ex Borg).
So sit back, bring lots of pop-corn and beverages, and prepare to be toyed with your senses. Cause this is one very entertaining show...
... in the end, that's what these shows are all about... entertainment!",1252627200,19,2246,4.848958333333333
