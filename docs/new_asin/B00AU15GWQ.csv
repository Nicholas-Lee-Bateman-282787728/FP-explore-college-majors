5510062,5,B00AU15GWQ,"Have been a fan for many years.  Pat has a way of transitioning throughout his songs.  Often the band starts on a slower beat but they're tearin' it up by songs end.  You can't judge a Pat song by it's ""cover"".  You have to hear it through to the end.  Great stuff!!!!!!!!!",1394755200,,273,4.173076923076923
5510063,5,B00AU15GWQ,Been a P.M Group fan for almost thirty years.  Always enjoy watching him perform live; its as if they're playing right there in your home.,1393891200,,138,4.52
5510064,5,B00AU15GWQ,"This was the concert that I had hope to see when Pat Metheny did a show at the Count Basie theatre in the late 90's. But, the group was not the same makeup as the same as the japan show, no vocals. I purchased the Cd ""We live here"" after I heard the cut 'To the end of the world' that was played on cool jazz FM station QCD 101.9 out of New York. I was blown away by the tune, and after twenty (20) years I still get goose bumps after hearing the play by Pat And Lyle. My music library covers a large segment, it includes recording from Miles Davis to The Who, but my favorite recording of all time is 'To the end of the World' by PMG. This DVD is a must have for any Metheny fan, the opening cut 'Have you heard ' as well as 'Here to stay' are great with the outstanding performance of  'First Circle'. Although, above all I enjoyed 'To The End Of the World' on the original CD (I have played it over a thousand times)
the same live performance in Japan just blows the CD version away.",1390262400,3,986,3.9797979797979797
5510065,5,B00AU15GWQ,I saw Pat Metheny over 8 years ago and I became a life long fan. This is one of my favorite dvd's and he has many. I brought 4 of these to give as gifts.

5510067,5,B00AU15GWQ,"For anyone who lived through these years/Concerts, I think this is an incredible Video. These folks are not likely to play together again [Lyle Mays, Steve Rodby,Paul Wertico]. Pat has moved on! I have been a avid fan of his music for 33 years. Thanks Pat,For bringing us along!",1377475200,,278,4.6938775510204085
5510068,5,B00AU15GWQ,"I've listened to smooth jazz for 30 years. I have always wondered what my favorite genre was. I saw this concert in 95/96. Really don't remember which. It was, and still is, the best live show I ever saw. The DVD brings a tear to my eye every time I watch. To this day, still my favorite show. 10/10 in my book.",1377302400,,311,4.032258064516129

8557776,5,B00AU15GWQ,"OMG!!!  PAT METHENY LOVERS MUST HAVE THIS!!  I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE INSPIRED BY JOYFUL MUSIC THAN THIS LIVE RENDITION OF ""FIRST CIRCLE.""  THE FULL MOVIE IS WORTH WATCHING, AS WELL AS THE CONCERT.
I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ENJOYING THREE LIVE PAT METHENY CONCERTS, INCLUDING HIS FIRST TOURS IN THE 1970'S.  BIG FAN!!",1466726400,,317,4.709090909090909

8557778,4,B00AU15GWQ,I like it,1446854400,,9,2.3333333333333335
8557779,3,B00AU15GWQ,"The only real problem I have with this disc is that they did an abbreviated version of Third Wind, and I cannot understand why they would cut out the last half of the song that builds to the climactic finish. This was a big disappointment to me as it is among my favorite PMG tunes. The rest of the music is great. The interviews generally don't have any points to make except for obvious ones.",1434585600,,394,4.266666666666667
8557780,5,B00AU15GWQ,I love the many colors this band makes as well as their very good songs. This may be my fave edition of the PM group.,1431561600,,117,3.72
8557781,2,B00AU15GWQ,This video is recorded in 4x3 letterbox and it is in stereo. The picture quality is only fair. If it were anyone other than Pat Metheny I would have returned it but Methany is brilliant in his performance. It is great to see this group live even if the audio/video are sub standard. There are interviews during the film and you can opt in the menu to just play the concert. I am not a fan of interviews. After all it is a concert video not a documentary. I therefore do not recomend this disc.,1429142400,4,493,4.2
8557782,5,B00AU15GWQ,A favorite group whom I have seen several times going  back to the early 80's.  Nice to have dvd versions of performances.  So many bands so many choices.,1428537600,,154,4.428571428571429
8557783,3,B00AU15GWQ,Nothing special. I was not impressed by the narration and causing when a singer plays some instruments when he is not used to it.,1426550400,,129,4.416666666666667
