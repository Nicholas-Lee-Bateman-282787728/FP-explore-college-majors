8037963,5,B00063QD6G,This is a great selection of classic cartoons from the late thirties to the early 50s. I used to see them in the movies and on black and white TV.,1397433600,,146,3.9
8037964,1,B00063QD6G,I got this DVD recently for my daughte and we are all very much disappoiinted with this. I don't think kids will watch this for more than 5 minutes. Video quality is worst. Don't buy this.,1178323200,3,188,4.25
8037965,3,B00063QD6G,"This DVD arrived in a crushed case.  A big piece of plastic was broken off, into the case.  The DVD itself works fine but I think the sender should take more time to package the product better.",1156636800,3,193,4.1891891891891895

Most of them are Looney Tunes. The rest: one early Mighty Mouse cartoon and one Popeye's and one Casper's cartoon from Famous Studios. There're not Pluto's cartoons in spite of its presence in the illustration of the cover(???).Anyway, the compilation is fine as well as the image's quality of all the cartoons.

DVD features: Chapter list; standard full frame and interactive menus.",1122595200,32,1274,4.530434782608696
8037967,1,B00063QD6G,"I grew up with most of these cartoons, especially Mighty Mouse. I missed not seeing the opening theme song and credits.  I was also dissapointed in the color quality. But perhaps my biggest gripe is the inability to bypass the opening trailers for the Seven Samauri.. and to skip to the next cartoon(s).

8037968,5,B00063QD6G,When I first got this DVD I ws expecting the same quality as most of the bargaing DVD versions but to my delight the quality was one of the best in its class!. I was pleasantly surprized and impressed. They have packed a lot of cartoons in there (over two hours) the quality is great for every single one!. I also have the other cartoon by the same company (Classic Cartoons ASIN# B00063QD6G). I highly recommend both of them.,1109894400,10,426,4.405063291139241
8037969,5,B00063QD6G,This is a great buy. We have most of the other DVD products in this category and this one is a great product. There is two full hours of the best episodes on this DVD. Hi highly recommend it. If you want to see what episodes are on this cartoon go to [...] I also recommend the Timeless Cartoons by the same company.,1109116800,6,316,4.031746031746032
8037970,3,B00063QD6G,"Hey, Amazon! Am I supposed to guess based on the cover art? How bout a list of which cartoons are on this DVD? Is that too much to ask before I order it?",1104278400,33,153,3.6666666666666665
