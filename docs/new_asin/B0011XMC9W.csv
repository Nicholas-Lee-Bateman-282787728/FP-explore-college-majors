8242890,3,B0011XMC9W,This is a great Story that goes well with the book by the same name.  The only downfall is that it is so ooooolllldddd!  The music is early '80 and a little louder than the narration.  It would be great if they could update it and put it in DVD form.  Other wise my 4 year old still likes to watch it while looking at the book.  She doesn't know the music is out of date!,1302307200,,371,3.8289473684210527
