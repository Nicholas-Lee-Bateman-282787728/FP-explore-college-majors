4834512,5,B005MAG8QI,"This is an absolutely unique document, showing a unique place - the forbidden zone around Chernobyl 25 years after the famous nuclear accident.

Radiation level in this area is still high enough to make extended human residence almost impossible, as long term effects on health can be very negative, potentially even lethal. Divided between Ukraine and Belarus, this area covers a grand total of 4760 km2. Very few people live there, as the area was forcibly evacuated in 1986 - still, some people (mostly elderly) refused to leave and some returned later. This elderly population dwindled with time, but a handful of marginals, attracted by the isolation of the area, also came to live in ""The Zone"". According to the last estimations, there is probably around 500 people living there permanently in the Ukrainian part and probably as much in the Belarusian part.

When an area as large has barely one thousand inhabitants, the result is the creation of an ""involuntary national park"". Fields and later whole villages were reclaimed by the wilderness and are now covered with forest, shrubs and/or marshes. Even cities are now invaded by wildly growing vegetation. Rain and floods destroyed most of the irrigation system, returning most of the rivers and streams to their natural shape, with small shallow lakes and swamps present everywhere. The radiation doesn't seem to affect plants, at least on the surface of the things - but vegetables, fruits and especially mushrooms growing in ""The Zone"" are still considered improper for human consumption.

""Radioactive wolves"" tries to find out what is the status of fauna in ""The Zone"". The approach adopted is that if the predators are thriving, then it means that the whole local ecosystem is doing fine. Therefore scientists try to locate and count local top predators - wolves. But when looking for them, we are offered a very detailed and well filmed tour around ""The Zone"", with some images seeming come right from a ""post-apocalyptic"" SF film. We also can have a look at many other animals than wolves.

Local biodiversity is absolutely astounding! Some animals were purposefully introduced, like European wisent and Przewalski wild horse, but most colonised ""The Zone"" by themselves, beginning as soon as the humans left. The roe deer, the red deer, the wild boars, the hares and the foxes, quite common in Eastern Europe were amongst the first to settle there. They were later followed by moose, badgers, raccoon dogs, beavers, weasels - and wolves. Although we do not see them in the film, there were credible reports of sightings of lynxes and one brown bear female with cubs.

Birds didn't miss that opportunity either. The white-tailed eagles, black storks, western marsh-harriers, great white egrets, swans, owls and kestrels are also prospering in ""The Zone"".

All those populations succesfully reproduce, as we can see many wisent calves, wolf cubs found in well hidden dens, some perfectly healthy looking kestrel hatchlings and an abundance of regularly used eagle nests.

The negative results of radioactivity are of course present. Although since 1986 there is every year some poaching, most animals are unaffected by illegal hunts, as their meat is considered unsafe for humans. In some areas most seriously contaminated (especially the infamous ""Red Forest"", in the immediate vicinity of the reactors) the biodiversity is significantly lesser. Also, if the larger animals which wander over large areas seem to not be affected by the radiations, smaller creatures (especially rodents) have a rate of malformations at birth twice as big as those living outside ""The Zone"".

Still, the scientists are rather favourably surprised by the endurance of the wildlife and especially the much less than expected rate of cancers (very rare) and malformations. All predators (wolves, weasels, eagles, kestrels) seem to do very well, which is an indication of a solid health of the whole ecosystem. And at the end of the film we learn that in this whole are there is no less than 120 wolves - which for a region of 4760km2 is the same density as in other forest/marshes areas of Ukraine and Belarus. No less, no more.

I was very very impressed by this film and I recommend it warmly. Enjoy!",1335744000,12,4248,5.074498567335244
4834513,5,B005MAG8QI,I really loved this Documentary about chernobyl and what its like today. Its such a great watch if u love wolves or if u know about chernoybl and the nuclear disaster and are curious what its like now. Looks amazing on blu-ray. Well worth the 12$ i paid for this great story and footage.,1324857600,7,287,4.333333333333333

4834525,5,B005MAG8QI,Saw the program on PBS.....great quality and detail pics of Russia. Our cat sat and watched the entire program. Decided to buy it for the cat. Have played it a few times and he still is captivated by the pics and sounds. He may have been a wolf in his prior life. Great wildlife program! Enjoy!,1412121600,2,294,4.267857142857143
4834526,4,B005MAG8QI,"Excellent documentary on the return of everything, except humans, to Chernobyl. Absolutely wonderful movie. Recommend it to anyone interested in long term recovery of area devastated by radiation",1402531200,,195,6.0
4834527,5,B005MAG8QI,"A very interesting look at how Nature and the wolves of Chernobyl survive and take back the area contaminated by the atomic accident. Although still unsafe for humans, the wolves and other wildlife seem to have adapted to the radiation.",1395705600,,236,4.925
4834528,5,B005MAG8QI,This video is great for a recap of the Chernobyl incident and shows biologists at work.  Could work well for either physical or life science students.  Appropriate for grades 6 - 9.,1390953600,2,181,4.625
4834529,5,B005MAG8QI,"I use this film in a writing class for a cause and effect essay. It's perfect for one class (53 minutes), and the discussion about the film is always good.",1366588800,,155,4.2
4834530,5,B005MAG8QI,"This film goes to show you, nature can recover from disasterous human error, and left alone from humans can do well on their own.
The film goes on to show us how beautiful nature can be, without people intruding in the balance.",1354752000,,227,4.428571428571429
4834531,3,B005MAG8QI,"First let me say I was expecting a wolf documentary.  There is not a whole lot of wolf footage at all.  In fact there is mostly people footage.. which I was not expecting to see.  I was expecting to see animals.

The information was all very good and informative though it did not explain how the animals are surviving around radiation (unless I missed it).

Footage-wise, this is roughly what you can expect:

Footage of People: 50%
Footage of Animals: 25%
Footage of abandoned stuff/nature: 25%",1344384000,6,496,4.709302325581396
4834532,5,B005MAG8QI,"This documentary examines the site of the Chernobyl disaster as an involuntary park, or area that was left to go wild by accident, rather than by planning. The storyline of Radioactive Wolves is centered on a group of Russian scientists who are actively monitoring the health of a population of wolves that has become established in the zone. Watching  wildlife biologists count wolves is not exactly riveting, but the broader context is.

When people think of Chernobyl, they think of it as a a barren wasteland, possibly crawling with zombies and mutants, and radioactive spiders. There are no zombies at all, but there are plenty of creepy shots of abandoned cities, and half-destroyed socialist realist art, and deer walking through hallways. Perhaps the greatest surprise in store for the doomsday enthusiast is the unnerving normalcy of things post-apocalypse. As it turns out, people are far more detrimental to the natural world than nuclear fallout, and there are big, healthy animals running around all over the place.

The major flaw of the piece is also a strength in that it raises more questions than it answers. You feel a little cheated in that we never hear much about the re-introduction of the wisent or of Przewalski's Horse. We're only teased with the vaguest of references to poachers... yes, poachers who sneak into the Zone of Alienation to shoot critically endangered,  and apparently radioactive, wild horses. I was annoyed that those storylines were neglected, but left looking forward hopefully to future documentary projects in this strange part of the world.",1336694400,5,1588,5.1434108527131785

8479290,5,B005MAG8QI,This is a great and will filmed little documentary. I wanted to see this for the parts about the disaster as much as the wolf parts. The movie is half science half history. This would be great viewing for upper grade students. I am not sure the blueray is worth the extra money but it does look good. If you like Chernobyl history look up Bionerd on YouTube.,1437350400,,358,4.279411764705882
