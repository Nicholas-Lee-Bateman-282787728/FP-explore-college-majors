8139420,3,B000HEWEIA,"I bought this film for two reasons; it had Eric Aragon (non-speaking role); it was filmed in South Beach. The acting wasn't the greatest, but the story wasn't bad. It was about a cute girl who comes to town to make it big singing. She cons and uses anybody in her path to get where and what she wants. In the end though, the good girl triumphs. Great shots of the Art Deco hotels and buildings of South Miami Beach, Florida.",1438905600,,424,4.246913580246914
