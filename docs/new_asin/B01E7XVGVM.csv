7732383,2,B01E7XVGVM,"Wow! This has to be one of the worse Canadian TV shows to come down the pike. It's like the writers, directors and producers spent each night smoking BC Bud and phoning in the script the day before the shoot. The confounding and confusing use of crash cuts and time jumps make the show almost impossible to follow. There are some interesting FBI training scenes scattered in lots of Agent Trainee's going nuts at Quantico. The female agents want to go to town and screw Marines, DEA and FBI agents that frequent the local bars. There are gay agents, happy agents, smart agents, physically powerful agents, brooding agents all running amok while in training. The instructors and cadre are confusing and the agent trainees get involved in all kinds of subplots and anti-terror activities. Basically things that would never happen in the real world. There is a rich girl who's being bilked out of millions by a fake sister, the son of a senator who is up for Vice President, twin middle-eastern sisters,one a devout, hijab wearing Muslim the other a westernized liberated woman who the FBI are going to use to infiltrate radicalized Muslims here at home and abroad, which is the CIA's job. There is so much back stabbing twists and turns all scrambled up in a flashback to bombs going off in Union Station that it's impossible to follow. You always feel like your missing something. The ""star"" is a Pakistani woman who is beautiful and smart and has casual sex with several people at Quantico including the deputy administrator. There is some real information like the red gun new guys working through Hogans Alley and running the Yellowbrick Road for PT. Agent Trainees get to lock themselves in their rooms and go off campus and get involved in active cases before they finish their training. I suppose it's a good thing that our enemies see the show and I hope they believe that the FBI runs a Keystone Cops operation as depicted in this crazy confusing show. Time jumps and crash cuts don't always produce a fast paced action mysteries. Sometimes they just produce a confusing mess. In fairness I even tried to binge watch it so I wouldn't lose continuity and it's still confusing. Maybe you can make sense out of it.",1474070400,4,2218,4.7338501291989665

7732385,4,B01E7XVGVM,"Quantico: The Complete First Season is a continuing ABC-TV mystery drama. Alex Parrish (Priyanka Chopra), a trainee at the FBI Academy at Quantico in Virginia, is suspected of having masterminded the most lethal attack on New York City since 9/11. Now a fugitive from the law, Alex races against time in her search for the truth, looking at others in her training class as possible suspects and betraying her closest friends and colleagues when necessary to identify the real culprit and prevent further acts of terror.

Structurally, the story arc resembles that of The Fugitive, in which an innocent individual accused of murder eludes the authorities to search for the real killer. Flashbacks tell Alexs story and the stories of her fellow recruits at Quantico.

Casting a woman of Indian ethnicity as the star of a primetime drama is unusual for the networks, but TV has been more encompassing of minority talent than movies. Ms. Chopra parlayed her Miss World 2000 crown into a career an actress and singer. She had an extensive, successful career in Bollywood movies.

The 5-disc DVD set contains all 22 widescreen episodes of the shows first season. Bonus features include audio commentary by Priyanka Chopra, bloopers, deleted scenes, and several making-of featurettes.",1473897600,,1277,5.159420289855072
7732386,3,B01E7XVGVM,"This show sounded really interesting, but it should have only had 13 episodes or 10 episodes. It was dragged out way too long and I lost interest as a viewer after awhile. I liked the premise and it was interesting seeing the NATS going through different tests at Quantico but the overarching plot was weak and lasted too long and just felt like the writers were like, ""What can we throw in there next?"" It could have been a lot tighter and less annoying for a viewer had there been less episodes which is not something I say often about TV shows. I was overall disappointed in this show and am not sure if I will tune in for season 2.",1473033600,2,635,4.256198347107438

I laughed almost every episode at the glowing details of a democratic leader or some platform. What's upsetting is that they shamefully degraded Ben Carson, a good man. I would not be surprised if this was left wing funded.",1472688000,6,436,5.069444444444445

7732389,4,B01E7XVGVM,"In the fall of 2015, I was intrigued when the promos for Quantico began to appear on ABC.  The premise of a series set at the FBIs training facility was interesting, and the stunningly striking Priyanka Chopra was someone that I had never seen before, as persons of her ethnicity are not often the lead in a series on American network television.  ABC deserves credit for continuing to provide opportunities to minorities with programs like&nbsp;, and Dr. Ken being other recent examples.

Priyanka Chopra was Miss World 2000, and had a successful and award winning acting career in Bollywood ().  Quantico is centered around her character Alex Parrish, an FBI trainee at Quantico, who is suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack.  A fugitive from the law, Parrish searches for the truth, as someone in her training class is may be involved in the terrorist plot.

Quanitco is a continuing drama with an extended story arc.  If you miss an episode or two, you may not have information that is vital to understanding the overall plot.  This is what happened to me during the initial run on ABC.  I was getting into the series, but then missed a few episodes, and was totally lost when I tuned in later.  I put Quanitco on my list of TV shows to catch later on DVD, and I hope that it will be enjoyable as a binge watch, where the plot can be absorbed in a concentrated blast.  The DVD set appears to have some nice extras as well.

Based on what I did see, Quantico is a solid action series.  Priyanka Chopras performance was strong, and production values were high, with some good action scenes.  The story kind of ebbed and flowed, with some interesting twists.  As the series was renewed for a second season, I expect Season One to end on a cliffhanger and hit the ground running in the fall of 2016.

Often classified as belonging to an ethnic minority, I realize that progress has been made in some areas, but in others there is still room for improvement.  Not every development may have been positive, but Quantico appears to be one small step in a new direction.",1469923200,8,2073,4.5896739130434785

7732409,2,B01E7XVGVM,"This show is a paranoid's delight, but that's about all I can say for it. The plotting makes virtually no sense, and the characters, cast seemingly out of a Sears catalog (""I'll take one each of these"") are nowhere near interesting enough to make me overlook it.

I watched all 22 episodes of a full-season story arc, with every episode ending in a cliffhanger. When we finally get to the last episode, they couldn't resist the impulse to end it with the ""oh but it isn't over"" cliche done by about half of the 1970s horror films. The individual episodes were a paranoid's delight, and got to be more than a little tiresome. Same old, same old. But to finally get to the end, ignoring plot holes all the way (how did this guy do all this expert electronic stuff -- he's established early on as an alcoholic screwup, and suddenly he's this mastermind?), to find out the story isn't resolved after all and they expect us to come back next year to see how it might maybe ends?

Not me. I got better things to do.",1485388800,,1009,4.390374331550802
7732420,1,B01E7XVGVM,"SPOILERS GALORE BELOW:  I just finished Episode 9 of  Quantico (the premise is that a terrorist got into and graduated the FBI Academy and set off a bomb in Union Station NY and framed the heroine (Priyanka Chopra) who is an excellent actress doing the best she can w/ a terrible script) and it is terrible, it is frenetic in pace and if FBI training is that poor, and their background checks that bad, we, the US,  really are in trouble. The actors and actresses are good, but it seems hard to believe everyone working for the FBI is a 10. You have to watch this, it just gets worse and worse. It's like 90210 meets Police Academy. They are all sleeping together. Then someone says something and X hates Y. So Y makes a confession of some sort and they jump into bed together. For example, a couple is out on a training run w/ their team, he explains why he did something. They stop and have sex, fully dressed of course. They hate each other by the time of the bombing. She is sleeping w/ her boyfriends (they start off as friends w/ benefits, but not really, she really, really cares for him, as does he)  Father by then. He will have to dump her as his wife is about to be nominated for the VP of the US and he does not want her to get tainted by SCANDAL!  In fact he has his son delete emails that prove the Heroine is innocent because they also show he is having extra-marital sex. She still ""loves"" the first guy, natch.  These  people are having more sex at the FBI Academy then most people have in their whole lives. At the FBI Academy? And they never get trained, they just get a problem and have to solve it or they will be kicked out, but not really, most of the time.  One guy, The Jewish Gay Guy (but not really he is faking it to get into the Academy) figured out a female profiler framed a serial killer and he is almost killed by the profiler, then he turns the profiler in and everyone hates him, and it is only the 9th episode. The Jewish guy (who would have to have been Mossad but isn't, he may be a Palestinian sympathizer and in on the bombing, but I don't think so, he sacrifices himself w/ the second bomb) likes a Muslim female fellow trainee (don't forget this is a big problem for him as he is pretending to be gay to stand out), but on the other hand she is one of a pair of twins (both of whom probably like the Jewish Guy, but only the real religious one admits it) who are being secretly trained pretending to be one person, to see, I guess if the Assistant Director of the School can get away w/ it. I was thinking of giving up on it, but it is so bad I've got to see what stupid thing they will come up w/ next. The heroine will figure out who the bomber is and then figure out who the bad guy is and ""Save the World"" from the second bomb.and then she will get fired and the CIA will offer a job for the 2nd season which will continue to be called Quantico just to continue to show everyone how bad a show it is. Then there is a whole US Gov torture unit that tortures you until you tell them what they want to hear. The head guy of this torture unit is played by an actor that otherwise always plays the best agent in Mossad (in NCIS and a CIA show). Oh, the heroine is Indian (India) and lied to her Mother telling her she was going to Graduate School. Her Father was an FBI Agent who, along w/ a bunch of others misread the signs of the Oklahoma City Bombing. He is a drunk and wife beater and went after the wife and the heroine in a spat of various cliches killed him w/ his own gun no less, Mom took the blame and sent the heroine to Mumbai for 10 years 1 of which she is unaccounted for, but she apparently spent some of the time w/ a possible terrorist, but she is not a terrorist, she is the Heroine. This is only episode 9 and i swear I am not making any of this up.  Oh and she can run faster than anyone else in the class, including the Jewish guy who is better at everything than anyone else, he can defuse bombs (how suspicious is that?) and her on again off again boyfriend, who she slept w/ in the backseat of a car on the way to the Academy before she knew he was fellow trainee, he is also spying on her, because? Who knows . . . She finds out, they yell at each other, he confesses and says he feels bad, so they go to bed together. Later, she helps an old friend of her Fathers as he is drinking too much, boyfriend gets mad and leaves. It is so bad I feel obligated to keep watching. Oh, there  is a fake bomb scenario, The Jewish Guy tries to defuse the bomb, which locked down the doors to the room. He gets the doors open, I think they stay open, a group runs out to SAVE THEMSELVES, the rest stay PROVING THEIR LOYALTY. The dead group stays in the Academy, the survivors are kicked out, but at least one comes back to haunt everyone after the bombing. So maybe the doors shut after the bomb started ticking faster, as they always do . . . All the men have a week  old beard, at the FBI Academy?????? Want to bet?",1484784000,,4971,4.067415730337078

7732446,1,B01E7XVGVM,"In the final episode, a guy drives his car over a bridge, plunging to his death, so that a bomb will explode underwater and save everyone. He is on speakerphone with everyone and they all cry and say, ""thank you, we love you!"" Wow, for being an FBI inductee they sure aim small. He couldn't think outside of the box and maybe park his car and just throw the bomb in the water? Or jump out before driving his car off, if the argument be made that direct contact with the water would have comprised the safety of more lives with quicker detonation. Boy, shame on the writers for this, as every plot twist and turn was about as big a blunder as this. Here are some major flaws with this terrible ""drama"".

-Fragmented Plot/Character Threads: the entire season splits between past and present and the characters flip flop good, bad, hot, cold, on, off more than a Katy Perry song in a bad episode of Heroes. The plot should be simple. Find bad guy. Stop bad guy. Clear name. Instead, we get needless and confusing drama between character relationships, and then rehashes of those relationships literally until the final episode. To the point where you are so confused that if you had only watched the pilot, you'd probably be better informed with the lead character's relationship status and wtf is happening. Actually watch episode 1 and episode 22 and you will be better off. Seriously.
-The dialogue is all so forceful. It thinks it is witty and clever...it just isn't. It is boring and almost laughable and how hard it tries. It is very close...you can feel it, but there's always that feeling of ""eh....somesing is not right!""
- No action. If you were hoping for some clever espionage or an exciting gunfight, heck even a cheesy Hawaii five-O chase and takedown sequence, look elsewhere. The most you will get here are some exercising montages.
- Unrealistic. There are oh so many plot holes in this show, like the one I mentioned to start off the review. If you want realism, again, look elsewhere. The show 24, which has Jack Bauer killing like 200 terrorists (who happen to unleash their diabolocal plans within uber distance of the only man on the planet who can stop them) and saving the world from nuclear apocalypse in the span of 24 hours without stopping for snacks or even to pee, and doing so on 9 separate occasions, is more believable..And highly entertaining. I recommend watching that over this.

The only pros: a pretty cast with decent acting. Especially Priyanka Chopra. Heavily marketed with her, so that probably got a lot of viewers. I think without her, there'd be no season 2.

The show has potential if it can find a decent producer and a new set of writers. And stop using the fast forward speed effect. it's annoying. And find a stronger plot thread for the flashbacks, or secondary thread. The reason it flip flopped around so much was pretty much the writers were stalling. This entire season could have been told in 3-5 episodes. It would have fit nicer and been more cleverly crafted. Season 2 needs.more meat, not jusg rehashes of girl/boy drama that nobody cares about.",1478044800,3,3102,4.6672760511883

8758000,5,B01E7XVGVM,"Last year, Quantico debuted on ABC with an incredible story line and a new action star for the next millennium. The show was so innovative and original, that it jumped quickly to the top of the ratings and was easily renewed. ABC thought the show was strong enough that it could draw viewers on any night, in any time slot, but they couldn't be more wrong. Quantico's first season was one of the best seasons of television I've ever seen, but it was the kind of story that left many viewers questioning, what else could they possibly do afterwards?

In only it's second season, Quantico set two television records. The first, saw the biggest drop in rating ever between a first season and a second. The second, saw the show renewed for a third season, as it had some of the highest DVR and on demand numbers of any show ever! Quantico was renewed based solely on DVR and on demand numbers, something that is unheard of and as little as five years ago never would have happened.

The series started with a bang, a big one, as terrorist blew up New York's Penn Station and immediately blamed for it, an FBI agent of middle eastern decent, Alex Parrish (Priyanka Chopra). She's an introverted person, and she knows she's been set up, by the only people who could have, one of her classmates from her time at the FBI academy at Quantico, she graduated from a year earlier. From there, each episode is a mix of Alex on the run in real time, trying to figure out who set her up and flashbacks to her time at the academy, showing her interacting with her classmates as she tries to remember anything she may have missed.

TV shows just aren't written this well, it just doesn't happen, and when it does, it's usually in a ten episode cable series. I have never seen a network show that was this clever and gripping. Aside from the writing, Bollywood star, Priyanka Chopra, made the leap to Hollywood in a way that hasn't been done before. While Bollywood is just as big as Hollywood, it's biggest stars have never enjoyed the same success stateside, until now. She was beyond impressive and regardless of what happens with Quantico, has a bright future ahead of her.

Season two just started streaming and it's next up on my list, but like many, I am beyond curious about what could possibly happen next. For better or worse, the mystery was solved in season one, at least that's what we believe. What could possibly be left for season two? We saw them graduate the academy and we saw the end of the case, supposedly (I'm still a bit skeptical), where does the series go for here. Quantico always struck me as that series that was one hell of an idea, but if it succeeded, and it did, how does one keep the story going and keep it going with the same intensity? Similar shows with big ideas and tremendous first seasons like The Killing, The Riches, Under The Dome, and Wayward Pines quickly fizzled out. Will that ultimately be the fate of Quantico, or will it stand the test of time?",1500336000,,2978,4.488929889298893
