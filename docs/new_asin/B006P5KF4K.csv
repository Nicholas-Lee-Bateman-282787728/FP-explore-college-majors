5012136,5,B006P5KF4K,I love this movie from the first time i saw it. This is a better version then those terrible remakes. For sure this movie is 80s horror movie at it's best.,1419897600,,155,4.032258064516129
5012137,3,B006P5KF4K,"You could tell this movie was rush , but Wes gave us a decent and somewhat scary sequel to the cult classic original. A lot flashbacks from the first movie , music sounds like a reworking friday 13th music and poor lighting. Kevin Blair character Roy, The Beast ( dog) , and Tamara Stafford carry this movie and makes us hope they survived this scary ordeal. To some it all up its scary Guilty pleasure. A cult fim for any film buff of horror movies.",1419724800,,450,4.305882352941176

5012139,2,B006P5KF4K,"THE HILLS HAVE EYES PART 2 is easily one of the most preposterous sequels in the history of Horror cinema. It seems inconceivable that the same man who had written and directed A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET just a year earlier could have produced such garbage, despite his own claims that the film was made at a point in his life when he needed the money. HILLS 2 takes directly after FRIDAY THE 13TH, pitting a group of idiotic teenagers against the hillside cannibals after they take a detour through the desert on their way to a motorcycle rally. Luckily for them, they are joined by a reformed Ruby and the heroic canine Beast, who had each taken on the demented family eight years earlier. It is absolutely absurd to think that Ruby would allow the group to travel on the same blood-soaked road where her family had killed countless people knowing that more of them could be lurking in the hills. The fact that the motorcycle rally just happened to take place in the same remote location is also completely contrived. It is simply a pathetic way to bring new victims into the desert. Craven brings back Michael Berryman as Pluto, but also introduces a new villain known as The Reaper, who is supposedly Papa Jupiter's older brother (again going against information given to us in the original). The pair tracks down and kills each of the teens in a variety of uninspired (but mildly gory) ways. To fill time, Craven also employs a number of flashback sequences, one of which has gained the film its greatest notoriety. Beast, the Carter family dog, inexplicably has a flashback of his own, where he recalls attacking Pluto from before. THE HILLS HAVE EYES PART 2 is a film that any fan can do without, and a mar on Wes Craven's career.

5012140,5,B006P5KF4K,"There are a lot of problems with this film, but they can all be overlooked for one simple fact. The Dog Has A Flashback! Bad lighting, stupid plot, stupid actors are expected. When the surviving characters from the first film are remembering important plot points from the first film, after all of those you get a slow zoom on the family dog, who has...

a flashback.

5012141,1,B006P5KF4K,"""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" is a poor, lame retread of ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" which was a poor, lame retread of Tobe Hooper's vastly superior ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  Writer-director Wes Craven is once again responsible for this cinematic mess, where a busload of stranded idiots wander around deserted buildings aimlessly before bald-headed savage Michael Berryman and his buddies come around to slaughter them.  A cut-and-paste plot stolen from the first film, and was anyone really screaming for a sequel to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" in the first place?",1021420800,6,555,5.155555555555556
