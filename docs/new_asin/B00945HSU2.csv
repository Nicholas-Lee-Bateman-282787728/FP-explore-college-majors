The DVDs are so clear and none of them have issues like the 30th Anniversary version does as described in reviews by Amazon customers.  The set also includes many extras the 30th Anniversary version does not offer. It includes: The Pilot, The Lost Episodes with Meg Foster, 4 movies, an exclusive fan booklet and autographed photo of Cagney & Lacey, the Audio book on CD by Barney Rosenzweig Cagney & Lacey...and Me and the British Film Institute's 30th Anniversary Cagney & Lacey tribute event from London.

Few shows have made the impact that this one did, and every time I put on a DVD, I just go back in time to when these two ladies rocked the TV scene with brilliant acting, realistic story lines, and one of the most admirable attempts at portraying police women outside of the realm of dumb bimbos running around with guns.

5256996,5,B00945HSU2,"Cagney & Lacey is one of the best ground breaking shows of its time. I was young girl when this show first started. I was happy to see women in potrayed in a positive light. They were totally bad a** in a male dominated profession as police. Cagney & Lacey is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. If you like police shows of the early 80s, you will love Cagney & Lacey. This set is a must have for all dvd collectors.

I give this series a 5 out of 5.",1454284800,,455,3.8404255319148937
5256997,3,B00945HSU2,"Well what a journey, unfortunately I feel this ended rather drearily with thee 'true conviction' film, not a fitting or appropriate ending for such an energetic show such as cagney and lacey.

The show lost it's way eventually, with far too much in the way of comedy material in later seasons.

When the show was good it was terrific!
Especially the 1981-1984 era, just my feelings on this.

Still glad to have the show on this great 38 disc dvd package.

All discs played fine on my multi region yamada player, and I received a signed photo etc, Tyne and Sharon are fantastic actresses and deserve the recognition they received and more, for their sterling work here

5257001,1,B00945HSU2,"I ordered this item in August of 2014.  I am just now getting through the discs.  When I read the description of this set, I did not see anywhere that there were defects with any of the discs.  But every now & then it flashes on the screen that there may be issues with the quality.  So far I had one disc in the 2nd season where the picture froze totally and would not continue.  I am now in the 3rd season and have one whole disc (#3) that will not play at all.  It says disc error.  I have tried it with my dvd player and also on my computer and it won't play on either one.  I would not have purchased something this expensive if I had known that there were defects.  I do not recommend this set to anyone unless you don't care if you can watch all the shows.",1444435200,8,763,3.934640522875817
5257002,5,B00945HSU2,"So far every disc has problems with freezing and skipping! It messes up the whole part of the show! I am so upset, I was so excited because I love this show! Now I do not know what to do! I have watched two discs so far and they both have serious problems! I am very disappointed! I do not know if I should get another set or my money back! I do want to edit my review on my item! I was playing my Cagney and Lacey Dvds in my Blue Ray Player and I was having the above problems! So I thought why not try them in my regular DVD Player and they play fine! I guess the Blue Ray is more sensitive and was picking up problems! So if you are playing in a Blue Ray and having problems try your regular player and they should be fine! I play most everything in my Blue Ray and never have any issues but did remember one time a disc did not play in my Blue Ray but did play in my other Dvd Player. I am so glad I thought to try this.

5257004,4,B00945HSU2,"PROS:
- complete collection, including the actual first season and the ""missing episodes""
- all four tv movies included (which weren't nearly as great as the show, but are still a nice treat for fans)
- contains behind-the-scenes footage and interviews
- included are an episode guide booklet, some background info, and a neat photo autographed by Gless and Daly
- crisp picture quality (not digitally remastered, but still outstanding for a show from the 1980s)
- great sound quality

CONS:
- no subtitles (big minus!)
- doesn't ship outside the U.S. (I live in Europe and had to have it shipped overseas by a friend's cousin)
- discs play without reading errors only on newer DVD/blu-ray players
- some of the DVD cases are low quality with the teeth that were holding the middle discs broken off during transport

Overall a must-have! Not only for fans from ""back then"" but also (maybe even especially) for younger audiences to see what good screen-writing looks like.

Nowadays, it's all about the perfect looks of the actors and the amount of high-tier action (or should I say violence?). This show proves that not everything in the 80s was all glamour or kitsch. The stories feel so real, as do the characters. There is so much going on, main storylines and subplots alike.

Today's shows like ""Rizzoli & Isles"" are just cheap wannabe copies, where the main plot conists of getting the bad guy in the same boring routine each week, with the same flat dialogues, and subplots consists of stuff like how many stains the female detective has on her old couch (because she eats on it) and needs it desperately replaced (wow!), and the forensic doctor is a mix between Mr. Monk and Bones (but looks like a barbie doll). ""Cagney & Lacey"" shows how it can be done right.

Get this collection today and get blown away by the best tv show ever!",1442448000,12,1841,4.687306501547988

I didn't know whether to start with the show or the extra DVDs in the last case. I'm trying to watch it slowly so the pleasure will last even longer.if anybody likes either of the two lead actresses or remembers watching the show, I highly recommend purchasing it. You get a lot of DVDs for a relatively small amount of money. I gave it 5 stars only because that was the most I could give the collection.

5257027,5,B00945HSU2,"Next to the big prime time soap operas that filled network screens in the 1980's no TV series had such an impact on people and the entertainment industry as ""Cagney and Lacey"". Here, for the very first time, fans can have the entire series in one complete box set. If your a fan of the series or classics shows like ""Cagney and Lacey"" this belongs in your library.

 This set includes every episode of the show, all 125 shows in which the very first season is included that has never been shown since its original CBS broadcast in the spring of 1982. This ""first"" season had Meg Foster playing Cagney after Loretta Swift the original Cagney from the 1981 movie, was not available as she was committed to MASH. However, ratings were terrible after the first season aired and CBS told producer Barney Rosenweig that they wanted Foster dropped and replaced by another actress. Barney had always wanted Sharon Gless (""Queer as Folk"") for the role from the time the TV film was shot but she was either not available or didn't' want to do it. Knowing his show and lively hood was at stake Barney persisted in getting Gless for the role as he knew she wand Tyne Daly would have perfect chemistry for the leads. In the spring of 1982 Sharon was doing a long forgotten sitcom called ""House Calls"". Barney had called Gless' agent months before to see if she was available and he was told sternly that Gless was in a series. \In New York on the day CBS was going to announce 1982's fall schedule Barney was outside the Plaza Hotel when an executive told Barney that he wasn't going to be given any info on that fall's schedule. Barney stated he wanted to know one thing: ""Is ""House Calls"" on the schedule and he was told no. Barney ran across the road to a telephone, called Sharon's agent in L.A. and asked is Sharon was ready for a new series and the agent arrogantly told him, ""Barney dear I have told you Sharon is in a series!!!"", to which Barney replied, ""Like hell she is! She just got cancelled!"". The rest they say is history.

 Sharon became Christine Cagney and with her and Tyne Daly as Mary Beth they showed that women could be just as strong as men. The series tackled some amazing stories over its run from 1982-1988 such as rape, alcoholism, domestic violence and prostitution. The series even won the Emmy for Best TV Drama twice and for six straight years from 1983-1988 either Sharon Gless or Tyne Daly would win Best Actress, two for Sharon and four for Tyne.

 This set features the original pilot episode, all six lost shows featuring Meg Foster, a beautiful pic signed by both stars and so much more. The shows look flawless and on one final note we have to thank Barney Rosenweig for doing such a fantastic job on putting this show together!!!!!",1421625600,,2758,4.506

Others say you should also include the packaging, DVD quality, etc. I feel everything should be included, as the packaging and the quality of the discs affect the content. I was really excited about getting the COMPLETE C&L; including the early episodes. 5 stars for the series. 1 star for the quality of the DVDs.

I purchased this set after reading as many reviews as possible. So I bought the set and the nightmare that came with it. Seven (7) of the discs were scratched. One (1) disc was cracked. And yet another disc wouldn't play at all; Season 3, disc 2. Fortunately I check sets like this as soon as I receive them. After finding all the problems, I notified Amazon. They'll be replaced, but I don't feel positive. So I advise everybody to check every single disc ASAP; as you only have 30 days to have it corrected.

UPDATE: 4/29/2014 I've received a replacement set. Except for the cracked disc, the same problems are there. Season 3, disc 3 will not play on most players, and episode 4 doesn't play at all. I'm surprised Amazaon hasn't gotten more returns/complaints on this set. So beware of anything put out by VEI!!!",1398470400,28,1273,4.60352422907489
5257053,5,B00945HSU2,I am so glad I purchased this set. The quality of the old Cagney and Lacey shows is here. Well done.,1394323200,,100,3.8095238095238093
5257054,5,B00945HSU2,"So far, I've watched about half of the series and they are great onscreen.  They are not in widescreen so set your TV to normal or auto so the images aren't distorted.  No skips, pauses, or hangups.  Good picture and sound.  I remember watching the series as a teenage girl, but couldn't remember any specifics, just that I liked it.  Now I realize the series offered female role models doing something more than cooking and housecleaning (which are vital to the livelihood of the family home, don't get me wrong) but for those of us with other interests and dreams, Cagney & Lacey provided the idea of growing up to be something strong as well as caring.",1393804800,19,655,4.564102564102564
5257055,5,B00945HSU2,"I finally bought the full series show Cagney & Lacey 30th Anniversary Complete 38 DVD Collection. I was catching episodes online and found one day that some of them were either not available only available by purchase, With the regularity that I watch these episodes, I knew I would be spending far more piece meal. That being said, this is a show that not only defined the period of time in which it appeared, it defined the careers of Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless, two of the most talented actors I have ever seen. Their partnership as performers and as the characters they played is something to experience. Their nuanced depictions are flawless and continue to pull at my emotions. I just love spending time with them like a fly  on the wall, seeing all their ups and downs, struggles and accomplishments. I remember being addicted to the show in the 80s and it has not changed 30 years later. I am one grateful fan.",1391299200,5,918,4.5636363636363635

8535566,1,B00945HSU2,"I bought this set for my daughter's birthday. The image said 36 disc set, and the box matches the box in the image. But the box we received says 32 disc set. Not sure if the pictures are supposed to represent DVDs, but there are 11 pictures that look like DVD cover pictures. My daughter is very disappointed as this said it was ""The Complete Collection."" Amazon, you should do better then this. The images should match the product.",1530057600,,432,4.481012658227848
8535567,4,B00945HSU2,"I got this complete set a long while back. Never had the chance to check out the quality of all of the DVD disks until recently. Cagney and Lacey was one of the best dramas on television. Period. The chemistry between Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly is pure magic. So, the series gets a million star rating. When I first started watching the DVD disks on my DVD player, before I got a Blu-ray player, many of the disks had trouble loading and playing, and made a loud noise while loading. I have had no problem playing all of the disks on the Blu-ray player. They all play perfectly. Go figure. So, if anyone already has the set and have had problems playing the DVD's on your DVD player, get a Blu-ray player. They should be just fine. My only complaint is the the show is in full frame and there is no closed captioning option on the DVD's. Some of the reasons explained above is why I only gave 4 stars on this set. Other than that, God, I miss this show!",1519689600,,953,4.213114754098361

8535570,5,B00945HSU2,"Condition and contents as described. Revisiting the 1980's series, I could see why it was viewed as positively contributing a serious look at the changing role of females in society. The behind the scenes, the struggle to be aired on 'popular' TV and time slots also supported the difficulties of introducing a programme that flies in the face of the establishment. Best of all, it is well acted and great television.",1501632000,,417,4.887323943661972
