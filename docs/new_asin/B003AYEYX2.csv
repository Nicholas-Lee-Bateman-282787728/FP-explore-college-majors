4104885,4,B003AYEYX2,"Every gamer reference they made I understood, and 90% of the movie is gamer-references. I loved it. Recommended if you are a table top gamer geek, the D&D kind.",1389225600,,160,4.551724137931035
4104886,4,B003AYEYX2,"This movie is worth it for the few second Neil Gaiman cameo, and the warm feeling one gets for supporting independent art.

I have students who have made movies of similar quality (and for which I am very proud of them!)  What it lacks in polish it makes up for in sincerity.  It is an homage to Geekdom.  If that sounds like something you might like, you could do worse than giving THACO a shot.",1328054400,,396,4.24
4104887,5,B003AYEYX2,"This movie may not have multi-million dollar car chase scenes, but it has something much better.  Geeks.  This is a great story that had me laughing so hard when I first watched it that I was glad the subtitles were on because otherwise I wouldn't be able to hear the next part.
I really love how well this was written, everything fits really well in the story and the jokes are really smart.  If you know a thing or two about D&D and other similar games, you'll really enjoy it with some of the detailed references.  If you don't, you won't catch all of the references but I think it would still be an enjoyable, amusing story.  My wife indulges me and lets me watch it, she's not a gamer at all.  That's a good sign.  I'm banned from watching Monty Python and other such movies, so if this is on the ""acceptable"" list then that must mean something good.  Buy the movie, it's awesome.",1269648000,8,885,4.321212121212121
4104888,1,B003AYEYX2,"The DVD skips immediately.  I did not realize this until after the return window had passed so now I'm out cash.

I have no idea what the defect ratio is, but realize that it is certainly a possibility.",1408147200,,202,4.2894736842105265
4104889,1,B003AYEYX2,Horrible.,1407715200,,9,9.0
4104890,5,B003AYEYX2,This movie is so on point. The actor's mannerisms and rituals and opinions are a reflection of my own gaming group.,1406332800,,115,4.523809523809524
4104891,1,B003AYEYX2,"Lame, low budget, bad acting.  Don't waste your money. I only rented it because the credits said neil gaiman. He is in the movie for maybe 1 second",1398643200,,147,4.25
4104892,1,B003AYEYX2,"While it could have been funny, D&D players will shake their collective heads in disbelief and boredom at the level of idiocy, mundane, and trivial goofiness that doesn't even rank as geekiness.  Boring, ridiculously attempted to perhaps describe what gamers are like, this film is unfair to gamers and non-gamers alike, be they D&D players or any other kind.  Portraying group members as moronic, stupid, trivial, lost within some world or worlds that make them unlike the remainder of humanity...A Worthless, Wasteful, Whiny loss of 82 minutes of my life and $1.99 of my money....Not worth even 1/10th of this price...These fools are 30th level idiots who deserve each other......",1398211200,,682,5.1909090909090905
4104893,1,B003AYEYX2,"For me, in my opinion, it is the more stupid thing I never tried to watch. I guess there are people whom like it but I doubt it.",1397001600,,128,3.607142857142857
4104894,1,B003AYEYX2,"Really poorly acted and uninteresting
Could not get past the first 15 minutes
the only reason I watch this is because it was given high rating - inflated by friends possibly",1394150400,,173,4.612903225806452
4104895,2,B003AYEYX2,"Then it started. Really a chore. As a gamer that enjoys movies,  I'd rather film makers not make the assumption that I will like a movie with some role-playing jokes rather than a good movie. I stopped watching.",1393459200,,211,4.552631578947368
4104896,4,B003AYEYX2,"Not as good as Zero Charisma, but entertaining and nostalgic. I love the part about being embarrassed by GURPS. The fact was a lot of us were pulled in by the allure of GURPS at one point or another, but few of us were skilled enough to play it until later. And unless someone mistake my ability to judge films, this is a low budget talking piece that most people won't even ""get"". But for tabletop gaming fans it is a hilarious and enjoyable must!",1390089600,,448,4.2823529411764705
4104897,5,B003AYEYX2,"This is by far one of the most hilarious films I've seen in sometime. As a tabletop roleplayer this film resonates deeply with me. So much in fact that I can see elements of the characters from the film in the group I play with. This movie is definitely one to rewatch. It's destined to become a classic, well at least in my gaming group. Very well made, entertaining, and an excellent group of characters.",1390003200,,406,4.426666666666667
8393295,5,B003AYEYX2,"One of my favorite RPG movies.  Between loaning it out and watching it I've worn the DVD out.  If you like an independant film that was brought together by a group of people that are passionate about the comedy and  subject of a role playing group this is for you.  If you lived through the 'Monsters and Mazes' era where they tried to hunt down all the 'evil' D&D players, this is for you.  If you really really really miss the old school THAC0 system...this is for you.  If you hate Wizards of the Coast in a deep seeded unhealthy way...that's in another independent film that's worth a viewing...look elsewhere ;)",1479340800,,616,4.504504504504505
8393296,4,B003AYEYX2,"Good movie to watch at least once for D&D fans. Although my friend, a DM, didn't like it. I did though.",1445385600,,103,3.9523809523809526
8393297,5,B003AYEYX2,"This is a movie written by gamers, acted by gamers, for gamers.  Full stop.

There is not a story line.

It is ""a day in the life of"" and includes many classic gamer troupes, e.g., Mr. Habitually Late, Mr. Mini-Maxer, etc.

If you are a gamer then you might have been part of some of these conversations, and if you have not gamed before this is a fun look at some of the hobbyists.",1444348800,,382,4.121621621621622
8393298,4,B003AYEYX2,Just what I expected to be.,1435449600,,27,3.6666666666666665
8393299,5,B003AYEYX2,"Loved it, my wife was totally lost and confused but I was calling out lines about different topics before the characters said them. THIRD EDITION IS HERESY!!!!",1426204800,,159,4.925925925925926
8393300,4,B003AYEYX2,This took me back to a table in my friends basement 20 years ago.,1419379200,,65,3.7142857142857144
8393301,3,B003AYEYX2,"Fun movie, though if you aren't truly a serious D&D'er or tabletop role-playing dice gamer, you'll miss many of the references. It's porrly acted and scripted, sure, but it's a fun viewing if you grew up on D&D, or you still play it. Again, don't expect anything like Darkon, for example, or Dungeon Masters (the two best docos of this genre, though this is a film, not a doco). It's really what I'd call an ""inside joke"" film for the folks who play these games (as I did way back in the days of ""real"" D&D with the very first GG modules)... don't expect a budget (it's all shot in a basement) or good acting... again, it's an inside joke for the players.",1413676800,,655,4.333333333333333
8393302,1,B003AYEYX2,Dumb. No production value. Horrible acting. It's like a college class project film gone wrong. Do not buy.,1411862400,,106,4.944444444444445
8393303,5,B003AYEYX2,This film hits A.C. 0. Its a outstandingly funny film that will keep lifelong gamers laughing the entire time.,1408752000,,110,4.842105263157895
8393304,2,B003AYEYX2,"if you know how to roleplay there is nothing new here.
if you don't know how to roleplay most of this won't make sense to you either.",1408320000,,133,3.962962962962963
