3484747,4,B001B7CNW4,"Director Chris Bell and his brothers, Mark and Mike, grew up in the 1980's being obsessed with muscle bound celebrities like Sylvester Stallone, Hulk Hogan and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The goal of being the next ""Great American Hero"" drove all three to begin taking steroids. But Chris eventually stopped. In contrast, Mark ""Mad Dog"" Bell and Mike ""Smelly"" Bell have continued using steroids well into adulthood, while pursuing side careers as a pro wrestler and a weight lifter respectively.

Chris's documentary includes interviews with his brothers and parents as well as a wide variety of athletes, medical experts and body builders. The film's subtitle is ""The Side Effects Of Being American"" and its theme involves the American obsession with competition and winning at all costs.

The last 10 minutes of the doc does a good of making Bell's case for the morally questionable effects caused by this American obsession. But I wish he had done a better job of illustrating the theme throughout the entire length of the movie. Also the scenes with his own family were by far the most emotionally compelling and I think he should have focused more consistent attention on them as well.

Instead the movie tends to jump all over the place, with various ""experts"" offering all sorts of contradictory opinions. If Bell had done a better job of editing this film might have risen to a higher level. But the fact that the subject of steroids ""hits home"" with the director in such a personal way takes it a notch above your typical documentary.",1214006400,5,1538,4.93050193050193

3484772,5,B001B7CNW4,"I really loved this documentary. There are so many things that the American taboo against steroids overlook:
1) The gov't fought this in baseball more than any issue, like Hurricane Katrina, healthcare or homelessness.
2)The classic alcohol/tobacco kill more, and even marijuana is much higher on the list of emergency room visits than anabolic steroids.
3)Tiger Woods had laser eye surgery for 20/15 vision, so he could read the greens in golf like a god.
4)What about using it without competing? Some want to be as strong as possible, or allow everyone to compete with steroids so it is no longer an unfair advantage.
5)Captain America's super serum was essentially a steroid, so it is embedded with American culture.

It also touches the aspect of the letdown meeting childhood heroes as you grow up as they only let you see the pipe dream (what they wanted you to see as a child), and not the flaws you find as an adult.

It was educational to see why this taboo exists, to simply win at the (modern) olympics and not make a mockery of America's pastime of baseball.

I like the themes of:
1) Your mileage may vary - roid rage is dangerous to a small percent of users in the same way that peanuts is (I am allergic to peanuts)
2) Like with alcohol and tobacco, let kids' bodies develop.
3) This creates a forum for people to debate and even have our youth become aware of moderation should they choose to use it, rather than have them overdose.",1475971200,2,1448,4.583011583011583

3484791,5,B001B7CNW4,"A challenging, very interesting documentary that is both personal and about societal issues. Chris Bell and his two brothers have all used steroids to help build their bodies. Chris has stopped, but his brothers have continued.

This ambitious film takes on two issues at once, tying them together at the end. (Although this construction does make for some muddy patches in the middle, where the film's POV becomes a bitunclear.)

First, the movie is a rejoinder to the knee jerk anti-steroid movement that (Bell argues pretty convincingly) has demonized a substance that is a lot less dangerous than we've been led to believe and certainly less so than alcohol, cigarettes, or sky-diving, all of which are legal, if dangerous personal choices. Bell points out the hypocrisy that we allow all sorts of other 'performance enhancing' but dangerous practices - like Air Force pilots being allowed to take Dexedrine to keep going, or models staving themselves to stay thin.

At the same time we sense Bell's ambivalence about the drug and his brothers' continued use of it. And ultimately we come to understand why. Bell is questioning the bigger issue of an America that says if you aren't the biggest, the strongest, the smartest, the richest, the most beautiful, you're somehow deficient. A country that has such scorn for athletes doing whatever it takes to win, also creates a 'do whatever it takes to win' mentality in life. It's in how often we wink at airbrushed photos of models, politicians who lie and make up facts, people who use plastic surgery to look young and beautiful, etc.

These are important issues, and by dealing with how they personally affected himself and his family, Bell manages to avoid coming off preachy or holier than thou. He's just trying to make sense of the mixed messages we've ail grown up with' ""Play fair"" but ""America loves a winner and hates a loser"".",1450569600,,1890,4.915360501567398

3484801,2,B001B7CNW4,"The premise of this film is something akin to ""imagine if Forrest Gump grew up worshiping muscular TV and movie personalities and then as an adult discovered that he was the only person in the world who hadn't realized that his heroes had all been consuming vast quantities of steroids."" Throw in a morbidly obese mother who imagines that her home-made junk food is acceptable because the sugar and fat it contains is ""all natural"" and you have a cast of well-intentioned people who are clearly unfit for survival in a world more complicated than that of a Disney cartoon. Imagine also the shock-horror overall message: that you can't trust US TV personalities or the US TV news to tell you the truth! Who today could possibly imagine the US media is anything other than an ad-driven component of the entertainment industry with the sole concern of attracting eyeballs regardless of the nonsense it may be necessary to promulgate in order to do so? So the ""expose"" of the hypocrisy surrounding steroid use is also rather touching as once again it seems the documentary maker was the last person in the world to realize that the USA is the reigning champion of hypocrisy, double-standards, mindless noise masquerading as ""entertainment"" and a total commitment to the lowest common denominator (unless, that is, we can go lower through sheer persistence...). And who'd have thought it: American politicians are mostly just intellectual midgets who create and then exploit non-issues to inflate their own money-grubbing careers. Whatever next? I half expected the movie at some point to inform us that Fred Flintstone isn't a real person...

It's not necessarily obvious what we're supposed to make of this movie. An unkind soul might think it's a wicked satire on the modern American consciousness. I feel a kinder interpretation is that we learn there are still people who presumably think that if they pray then their deity will give them that shiny new bicycle for their 10th birthday and that all you need is hard work and determination in order to ""make it"" in America. But really, someone should put these folk in a reservation for their own protection. But perhaps in the end the real lesson is that reason plays little or no role in American cultural life. The sad spectacle of the father whose son committed suicide arguing that facts and evidence are irrelevant because he ""knows"" that steroids were to blame is an example of how for far too many people the three pounds of grey matter sitting inside the cranium is just unused deadweight. The title of this documentary is Bigger Stronger Faster but perhaps more pertinently it should have been Dumber and Dumbest.",1436140800,4,2672,4.911504424778761

Chris Bell has presented a very informative, entertaining and controversial documentary about the place of enhancement drugs in popular media and sports, and while the primary focus is on the ethics of the usage of anabolic steroids there is also attention given to the allowable means of enhancement used by events such as the Olympics, as well as beta blockers and amphetamines in various uses.  There's a lot of good material presented and I felt the approach was objective enough - perhaps a little heavy on the pro-steroid usage, but what I respected was hearing voices that included Bell's own parents, encouraging him, often from the Bible, to find contentment in being what they are and not having to reach approval and success with the assistance of drugs.
This was an interesting documentary with the only caution being strong language used throughout the video (surprsing this didn't earn an R, but who knows how the rating systems work these days.)",1404864000,,1148,4.8520408163265305

3484882,4,B001B7CNW4,"I found this documentary to be very entertaining as well as informative.

The documentary discusses the hypocrisy behind the origins and current laws associated with anabolic steroid use and does so in a very entertaining manner.  The sad truth is that many of the myths about steroids were driven by pseudoscientific beliefs and not actual science.

This issue is similar to the rising problems in childhood vaccinations.  The belief that vaccinations -- treatments that nearly ended polio, whooping cough, small pox, etc. -- cause autism was started by 1998 fraudulent publication by Andrew Wakefield.  Note that in 2010, Wakefield was found guilty of 36 charges including 12 counts of abusing developmentally challenged children.  Wakefield's original article was funded by parties that should have been considered conflicts of interest.  Yet even so, people are starting to believe that vaccinations cause autism even when they have no evidence to show this relationship.

Contrary to popular belief, steroids are used in numerous medical treatments (e.g., autoimmune diseases are often treated with prednisone) and no study has found that steroid use or withdrawal from steroid use directly causes depression and suicide.  I liked this movie because the creator was honest and actually showed both sides of the arguments without injecting too much personal bias.  The funniest part of the show is when one of the world's leading experts in steroid research starts listing off horrible sounding side effects.  The viewer is led to believe these are due to steroid abuse, but in fact, the list is associated with vitamin C abuse.",1389830400,3,1632,5.311284046692607

Now, I don't know what to think about steroids, and wouldn't judge anyone for taking them. If you prioritize being as strong as possible, and they don't have any proven long-term effects, why wouldn't you take them? And are athletes who take them ""cheating"" any more than anyone else taking something to help their performance (in school, playing music, etc.)? The line between ""natural"" and ""artificial"" get very, very fuzzy.

I was also fascinated by the stories of men in their 30s (and older) who hung onto the dream of stardom-through-strength even as it appeared to have become an unattainable and costly one. It is hard to hit your 30s and face the fact that your life won't turn out as you had dreamed, despite the work and time you put towards that dream.

3484946,5,B001B7CNW4,"A challenging, very interesting documentary that is both personal and
about societal issues. Chris Bell and his two brothers have all used
steroids to help build their bodies. Chris has stopped, but his
brothers have continued.

This ambitious documentary takes on two issues at once, tying them
together at the end. (Although this construction does make for some
muddy patches in the middle, where the film's POV becomes a bit
unclear.)

First, the movie is a rejoinder to the knee jerk anti-steroid movement
that (Bell argues pretty convincingly) has demonized a substance that
is a lot less dangerous than we've been led to believe and certainly
less so than alcohol, cigarettes, or sky-diving, all of which are
legal, if dangerous personal choices. Bell points out the hypocrisy
that we allow all sorts of other 'performance enhancing' but dangerous
practices - like Air Force pilots being allowed to take Dexedrine to
keep going, or models staving themselves.

At the same time we sense Bell's ambivalence about the drug and his
brothers' continued use of it. And ultimately we come to understand
why. Bell is questioning the bigger issue of an America that says if
you aren't the biggest, the strongest, the smartest, the richest, the
most beautiful, you're somehow deficient. A country that has such scorn
for athletes doing whatever it takes to win, also creates a 'do
whatever it takes to win' mentality in life. How much we wink at
airbrushed photos of models, politicians who lie and make up facts,
people who use plastic surgery to look young and beautiful, etc.

These are important issues, and by dealing with how they personally
affected himself and his family, Bell manages to avoid coming off
preachy or holier than thou. He's just trying to make sense of the
mixed messages we've ail grown up with' ""Play fair"" but ""America loves
a winner and hates a loser"".",1330732800,2,1876,4.946031746031746
3484947,5,B001B7CNW4,"The director and his family are like most American families with very loving and religious parents, who in all honestly deal with their own emotions, feelings and beliefs in a very realistic approach. Extremely educational with facts and reality. This is a documentary which analysis steroids in many facets medically, nutritionally and more important politically. It makes you see the way that big business, news stations and other entities operate and manipulate the facts for financial gain with the help of the same representatives that you voted for and placed in public office. Can not say enough good things about this documentary. Superb, well done, honest, humane, educational and emotional. Bravo.",1326585600,3,707,5.378378378378378
3484948,5,B001B7CNW4,"This is a really interesting documentary - and I'm completely clueless about bodybuilding and steroids (I'm female and don't lift heavy weights!)

Apart from some interesting questions about steroids themselves (how safe are they really?), I liked that the film also focussed on why people decide to use them in the first place. Like it or not, American culture is very focussed on winning! I have lived in the USA for 10 months and the contrast in competitive attitude is very noticeable - ie if you're not winning, you're nobody, particularly in high level sports. On that subject, I found some of the interviews with the brothers in this documentary to be very sad - a job and a family just isn't enough when you feel like you're destined for more, and steroids are part of the plan for success.

It helps that Chris Bell has a really likeable, upfront interview style and explains his experiences and his quest for information in a very accessible way. Sometimes the film jumps around between subjects but I didn't find it hard to keep up or keep everything straight in my head.

This is well worth watching and raises some interesting questions about performance enhancements in sport, steroids specifically and the rise of a win-at-all-costs attitude.",1326240000,,1257,4.892018779342723

3484950,4,B001B7CNW4,"The documentary ""Bigger, Stronger, Faster"" provides a decidedly unconventional - indeed, controversial - take on the use of anabolic steroids. Rather than pointing out the dangers of such use, the film seems to be making the opposite case: that steroids are really no more problematic than myriad other performance-enhancement substances and techniques used by athletes to better their game. And, if anything, it is the American obsession with being the biggest, the strongest and the fastest that may be the real culprit in the first place.

Christopher Bell, who directs, narrates and appears prominently in the film, was a short, fat kid when he and his two brothers, Mark and Mike, the latter of whom died not long after the release of the movie, became obsessed with achieving fame and fortune through bodybuilding, power-lifting and professional wrestling. With media-savvy role models such as Hulk Hogan, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone serving as their inspiration, the boys eventually turned to steroid use to improve their chances of achieving their goal. But Chris always felt bad for trying steroids, mainly because the media and the people around him kept telling him that it was both dangerous and immoral to do so. So he quit. Now, through his film, Chris has decided to find an answer to his question of whether steroids really are such a bad thing - in terms of their effect on both the body and competitive fairness - or whether their negative reputation is largely a product of media hype.

He spends a good amount of his time in the film seeking out professional athletes, coaches, and ""experts"" in the field, only to find that the ""experts"" - whether in the medical field or the halls of Congress - don't really have the facts to buttress their case, and that most of the athletes he talks to flat-out admit to using steroids themselves.

Chris really aims his opprobrium at the modern American obsession with achieving fame, fortune and physical perfection at any and all costs - a group in which he includes himself and his brothers. There's a particularly pointed and witty moment as a psychologist he's interviewing points to the slow but noticeable evolution of the GI Joe action figure over the decades, from a fairly trim average guy in the `50s to a muscle-bound, six-packed, super-hunk today. Chris calls out the media for its complicity in this obsession with the models that are used in advertising and the actors who have achieved superstar status on screen.

Chris's main thesis is that steroid users are being unfairly singled out, while people in other areas of life - like college students and musicians who take performance-enhancing drugs - are not similarly accused of cheating. It's the hypocrisy that seems to bother Chris the most. He points out that the same Congress that brought baseball players in to testify about doping in that field also managed to deregulate a supplement industry that finds ways to rip off consumers with the promise of physical perfection. He likewise attacks the pharmaceutical industry that continually feeds America's obsession with consuming drugs as a means of achieving health and happiness. He also points out just how easy it is to procure access to all kinds of drugs - both legal and illegal - if the determination is there and the price right.

By focusing so heavily on his own family, Chris really personalizes the issue for the audience and prevents the movie from becoming just another finger-wagging, cautionary-tale polemic. This also brings us the film's most poignant moments as he and his brothers engage in moments of fruitful soul-searching and their parents reveal how they feel about the issue.

""Bigger, Stronger, Faster"" is likely to upset some in the audience who feel it's taking a somewhat cavalier approach to what is generally considered to be nothing short of a scourge plaguing our nation. But Chris seems to be making some good points, even if he isn't coming right out and endorsing the use of anabolic steroids. He seems more concerned with exactly WHY we are so obsessed with being the biggest, strongest and fastest. And that deeper dimension is what winds up giving his film the competitive edge it needs to win.",1313539200,,4234,4.97316384180791

I have not to this day taken them, but do plan on experimenting with them some day. I am only 23 years old and as somone who practices what they preach I would not take them at this time. Also to be honest there is no way in hell that I could afford them lol from what I have seen they are expensive as hell, plus I am extreamly untrusting, and weary of buying them from a friend, the street, or on the internet.

3484964,2,B001B7CNW4,"It's an interesting premise and gets off to an OK start - a more balanced view of steroids, with the experience of the filmmaker and his brothers providing some kind of personal context.  I generally agree that the laws and popular opinion against steroids are overly strict, and steroids deserve a more balanced view.

But it quickly descends into a bunch of whiny and often nonsensical rationalizations for how steroids shouldn't be illegal.  ""It's society's fault!"" the guy argues - the classic argument of a criminal.  Somehow, being American is about winning, and steroids help you win, and therefore steroids are part of the American way.  Or, steroids have negative effects, but so does Vitamin C, and therefore we should ignore the negative effects of steroids...

You could use many of the arguments here to rationalize anything.  Heroin is not one of the top reasons people go to the emergency room, and oboe players who feel stage fright use beta blockers, and therefore heroin should be legal!

It also turns into a bunch of hit pieces.  Anybody who is anti-steroids gets edited to look like a complete moron, the interviews often immediately followed by another interview to explain why the guy is a complete moron.

The most interesting parts of the documentary were something of a tangent - detailing the tendency of bodybuilders to dream unrealistically, as well as the supplement industry to take advantage of these unrealistic dreams.",1307836800,4,1452,5.03765690376569

3484967,5,B001B7CNW4,"""Bigger, Stronger, Faster"" is a must see very informative, entertaining movie for athletes of all ages. You realize that your 80s action figure lookin' heroes rode a needle to fame!

The movie is about three-brothers who grew up as wrestling/sports fans but none of them were born with size or great bodies. They hit the weights hard and become very accomplished athletes. Two of the brothers have zero problem with getting on the juice to get where they want to go while the other stays away from roids.

This is a smart movie, a funny movie, an informative movie, a sad movie and an interesting movie. It had to take a tremendous amount of time, thought and effort to produce. A true labor of love.

If someone you know is a pro wrestling, football or weightlifting fan then this is the ultimate movie gift for them. This would also make a great gift for a doctor.

Some folks might complain that this movie is ""pro-steroids"" but really, both sides are presented here. Maybe the pro-steroid side seems to stand out more because you've never seen reports on the lamestream and drive-by media about the benefits of steroids.

You will probably come away with the feeling that doing heavy roids is like signing up for tragedy in the long term and possible fame and fortune in the short term.

After watching this movie I don't think I will ever be able to buy supplements, read a fitness magazine or walk pass a check-out counter in a gas station the same way. It is powerful in exposing how widespread the use of 'enhancements' are -- and it takes an objective look at the use of anabolic steroids that the media have failed to do for decades.

While debunking the popular and false notions of what steroids are, the film-maker Chris Bell takes a revealing look into his family's life and the role that steroids and the toll that the quest for ""bigger stronger faster"" has taken.

The film investigated the reasons why many folks feel inclined to take steroids, how folks use other often legal performance-enhancing drugs (or activities) in other realms but then criticize steroid use, how media and politicians spend a disproportionate amount of time talking about the dangers of steroids relative to estimates of risk, and how we all need to take a step back and learn a little bit more.

3484992,4,B001B7CNW4,"Terrific movie, absolutely worth seeing.

I have been an Olympic-style lifter and bodybuilder for over forty years. Years ago, not happy with my progress, I tried Dianabol, but only for six weeks. Primarily because of genetics, I was never very good at the ""iron sports"". Too tall, too skinny. I can admit now that the primary reason I lifted was, like most guys, to get bigger and stronger, to impress girls, to make myself feel better about myself. But with me, it went beyond that: I felt inferior to other guys, on many levels. I wanted to be better than them, to be able to intimidate them, and if I couldn't do it with money or education, at least I could do it with my physique and my poundages. I may be wrong, but I believe that a psychologist might suggest that there is a significant amount of immaturity and desperation in such thinking.

I'm not saying that this is the case with every guy, but I'd say it's not far from the truth. A lot of us want to be able to say ""I'm the biggest, baddest guy in this room"". If we only lifted to improve ourselves physically, and were able to keep it in perspective, we wouldn't be using steroids, HGH, testosterone, etc.. Guys wouldn't sacrifice their families and their health just to get to a bodybuilding title or world record bench. Women would not end up looking like freakish gender anomalies. Years ago, they asked a group of world-class athletes the following question: If you knew (1) you could win an Olympic gold medal by taking steroids, would you do it? Vast majority said ""yes"". And then the key followup question: (2) If you knew that, as a result of taking the ""juice"", you'd be dead within five years of winning your medal, would you still do it? Again, vast majority said ""yes"". To me this epitomizes the egocentric and distorted thinking of many--not all--of the folks who do steroids. What about the rest of your life? What about your grandkids?

This is a must-see film for anyone who's ever felt the deep and heavy bite of the ""iron bug"". Chris Bell does a wonderful job, particularly in how he involves his family in the whole project. He and his brothers have, and are, hoisting some truly incredible poundages. If you can do a 500-lb. bench, you are way, way above what most gym rats could ever hope to do. But to be able to do 600....700....this is amazing. But in the whole scheme of things, is it worth it? What meaning does any athletic achievement, regardless of whether it's done with or without ""help"", really have? Does it do anyone any good, other than feed an individual ego?

I've personally known guys who have for years been on and off modest amounts of steroids, and their health seems fine. On the other hand, I've known lifters and wrestlers who went over the line with the drugs and are now dead, due to massive heart attacks.

As for myself, I will continue to lift for health, and I will not become obsessed with it, like I used to be. If I had continued with steroids, I believe that, with my personality, I would have taken too much. I thank God for that night, when I was in bed trying to sleep, so many years ago, when, in my second month of Dianabol, I noticed that my heart was pounding a mile a minute and it felt like it was going to explode. The next day, the headaches.....Bottom line: It scared the hell out of me, and I stopped forever.",1279584000,6,3343,4.446982055464926

3484994,5,B001B7CNW4,"I witnessed more common sense from individuals in this documentary than most any other program.

If you are a thinker, you will surely enjoy the logical progression on thought the director put into this film.  The man should be proud of what he put together.

Chris, being between 2 brothers and a lifter, has chosen to explore the subject of steriods in a methodical process and the film feels like he simply recorded his work.  No family member, etc., is left unexposed and his sense of humor about everything is wildly entertaining and honest.  Also, congress and others are NOT spared being shown as what they are - you'll get the point.

This subject provides a brilliant example of how populations ""react"" to ""news"" as opposed to thinking.  Chris obviously understands the subject and the population's ""reaction"" to it.  His questions cut deep into the reasoning.

There is NO escape from the truths he exposes.

Honestly, I rarely hear so much ""to the point"" sense made in such a short time.  For those of you who ""react,"" do yourself a favor and absorb this work.

There are so many favorite quotations.  One here(paraphrased): ""Everyone has a vote with this (holding a dollar bill)....""  So simple, eloquent, and TRUE.

Why does anyone take these drugs at all? Even folks who have no financial gain from the risk?

In the end this documentary left me kind of sad that for some folks that they see the only way to fame and fortune and self worth is to take a drug which can harm themselves in the long run.

3484997,1,B001B7CNW4,"This is a troubling piece. It follows the depressing, dysfunctional, suicidal lives of Mr. Bell and his family who are all suffering greatly from obesity and severe inferiority complexes. It attempts (and fails) to justify their turning to steroids in an effort to cover up their own feelings of inadequacy in life.
  Perhaps the most troubling facet of the documentary is the fact that Mr. Bell concludes that the reason people use steroids and cheat to win, is because that is the American way. Anyone who goes along with that premise is blind to the fact that most Americans are fair and have integrity and would rather lose than win by cheating.
  Bell, in keeping with his own admission to lying and cheating, takes a few cheap, below-the-belt political swipes at President George W. Bush by accusing him, without presenting the slightest bit of evidence, of condoning the use of steroids before he was elected President of the United States for two consecutive terms by the American people.
  We feel that this documentary focuses in on a very few freak-show celebrity types and presents them as American heroes, which, of course, they are not. Most Americans would not characterize them as heroes either. Upon the premise that these are heroes the entire documentary is built, and upon this premise the justification of the use of steroids to cheat is founded. It simply DOESN'T WORK!!!
  ""Bigger, Stronger, Faster"" (Should have been named ""Bigger, Stranger, Fatter"") lacks balance and represents, we believe, the lowest form of journalism, the typical propagandaesque type of work previously produced by the same people in other works of questionable value.

Chris Bell succeeds here when he keeps things personal. Describing his youthful worship of Ahnold and Sly, talking with his brothers about their steroid use, detailing the collapse of his dream of moving to Cali and becoming a champion lifter. But as the movie goes on, the increasingly obvious pro-steroid slant skews what seemed like objectivity to the point that by the end, one wonders which steroid manufacturers helped finance this film.

The nadir is the ""Steroids 101"" section, wherein Bell attempts to seem unbiased and present just the facts, ma'am. Yes, your testes shrink while using...but they grow back when you stop! Yes, women's reproductive systems change...but it...uh...it...umm, well they may not return to normal. But on to the next, positive point! It's moments like this, glossing over the many physiological negatives of artificially bombarding your body with many times its natural production of hormones, that ultimately derail this film.

Bell seems balanced for a while, then his weird, subtly expressed regret over not taking juice earlier in his career kicks in and he becomes a cheerleader for 'roids, interviewing only doctors who are on the fence, and ignoring the many who could show the other side. Any serious juicehead will tell you that to counteract the many side-effects of 'roids, a ton of other chemicals must be taken to protect the liver and various other body parts that go into crisis in the unnatural roided-up state. How can that be healthy?

But Bell seems content with the argument, expressed by many pro athletes here, that ""everyone's doing them, so to compete, I must too"". The deeper moral issues of that stance are avoided, and the movie even ends with Bell blaming the ""American way of life"" for causing steroid abuse, or use, or whatever it is. That's weak. No one made these guys want to look like the Hulk (they all admit that early on they wanted to look like comic book characters...seriously), but it's society's fault? At least man up and admit that cheating is cheating and lying is lying, even if the entire world is doing it. Little mention is made of the many champions who have not stuck needles in their body every day to win, by the way. That's a telling fact.

In spite of these issues, Bell and his family are very sympathetic, nice folks, and that's what makes this doc work. They seem like truly good people, and Bell is unflinching in his honesty about them. If only he'd been so even-handed with the negatives about 'roid use. Shrinking testes and uterine damage are not minor issues to be dismissed lightly. Instead, this is all seen as the price one must pay to play with the big boys.

The main problem for me with BSF is that it really does make 'roid use seem like it's ok for kids, despite weak warnings. Bell's brother teaches high school football and admits that he juices but always lies to his students and their parents about it, for their own good of course, not his; the movie then shows his players praising his great build and how it's ""all-natural"". I'd love to see a follow up doc about how they reacted to the truth, and his lies. It's that sort of backhanded semi-honesty that makes this film suspect. If it was truly ok to use 'roids, this sort of lying wouldn't be necessary. People are scared of 'roids for many reasons; the lying they engender seems like a good one.

I really liked Bell, and his intentions, and perhaps there are many positives about steroids. But he is just as guilty in his one-sided arguments as those who condemn 'roids are in theirs. And, unfortunately for Chris' side, the anti-roid folks do have the moral high ground. Yes, America is a win at all costs nation...but so what? We are meant to to hold ourselves accountable to a higher standard than the idiots who surround us, not as Americans, but as human beings.

There are some very fine scenes where Bell challenges specific people's views on steroids, such as the father whose son killed himself while on 'roids and antidepressants; the dad is unwilling to accept that the antidepressants may have been the problem (as they very often are; it is a sick crime and a pox on Big Pharma's heads that so many kids have killed themselves while on these meds, and that it's been so hushed up. Someone PLEASE make a doc about it!). That scene and a few others show Bell's truly good heart and gentle nature, and made me appreciate his efforts here even when I didn't agree with all of his ideas. The early scene with the guy living in his van waiting to be a star took balls to include, damning as it is to Bell's own dreams. Very nice, Chris. More documentarians should have your self-effacing attitude.

The extras have some moments of good humor, and bad weirdness, like the guy sucking horrible goop out of his biceps with busted needles. Why wasn't that in the movie? Probably because it's a little too close to the truths about steroid use, and the insanity that infects their users, that this movie does not want to address.

All told, this is worth watching, even if just to see how some really nice folks let themselves be swept up in a win at all costs mentality, and rationalize it all away. Which also sums up our recent financial debacles and so much else in this country, in fact. Maybe I'm just kidding myself...maybe it is all about winning. But if you have to lie to everyone around you to do it, while making your body grow in ways nature never intended, is it really worth it?",1264118400,16,5477,4.6546018614270945
3485000,5,B001B7CNW4,"This was an excellent movie. Chris Bell took a complex subject and presented a balanced, informative product that addressed the major issues involved.

I also like how he addressed the concerns of those parents who are against steroid use for any reason.

I watched it with my own children and it led to an interesting discussion which we'll repeat periodically I'm sure.",1260662400,,558,4.852631578947369
3485001,2,B001B7CNW4,"Bigger, Stronger, Faster is an overly-long look at the impact of steroids on American culture. Christopher Bell covers the usual scandals in professional sports, but also looks at the impact steroids have had on his family; Bell and his two brothers have all used steroids. BSF is about one hour, forty-five minutes long and it drags to a close; I wish Bell had cut about forty-five minutes.

The film scores some points on American's contemporary ""steroid madness""; Bell makes a strong argument that the way that we regard `roids is similar to the ""reefer madness"" that the U.S. experienced in the past. We simply don't know that much about whether steroids cause long-term problems. That aspect of Bigger, Stronger, Faster will cause viewers to think.

Bell and his brothers grew up idolizing all of the ""ripped"" celebrities in the 1980s - Hulk Hogan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Sylvester Stallone. Of course, all of these guys used steroids. All three Bell brothers began to work out & eventually all three tried steroids. The oldest brother, Mark, became a football star who then became a pro wrestler. Youngest brother Mike became a high school football coach who tells his players to avoid taking steroids, even as he abuses them. The brothers seem to suffer from arrested development; they continue to take steroids and dream boyish dreams long after most men have settled down. Mark even moves to southern California to pursue his hazy dreams of becoming an actor or a pro wrestler.

The rest of the movie just isn't that interesting. Bell mentions Barry Bonds, Marion Jones, Mark McGwire, and all of the other tainted athletes.  He interviews Congressman Henry Waxman in his office; Waxman seems to know very little about steroids even though he led the U.S. House's inquiry into Major League Baseball and steroids.

Aside from the stories of the Bell family's involvement with steroids, Bigger, Stronger, Faster just isn't that interesting. I would not recommend this film.",1259798400,2,1983,5.051987767584098
3485002,5,B001B7CNW4,"Like the title says. This is a great movie. It touches on what people think about what it means to be a man, what it means to be American, what it means to succeed, what is 'moral', what is cheating, and peripherally on the 'war on drugs'.
Three moments stand out for me:
Chris Bell's meeting with the father of a high school kid who was supposedly driven to commit suicide because of steroid use. Bell questions what else might have been going on in that kid's life. The father mentions that the family lives in a town where achievement is very important. We get to see the kid's room -- it is stuffed with sports trophies. (Maybe dad was pushing his kid too hard?) It turns out the kid was taking Lexapro -- which has been implicated in suicidal thinking. Dad wants to blame steroids, so he bats away all of Bell's questions. Meeting with that kid's father and diverging from the standard ""steroids are evil"" script took a lot of nerve, but it was done well and respectfully;
The second moment came with (then senator) Joe Biden's grandstanding against steroids in a Senate committee meeting. Biden says that the thought of athletes using anything but what God gave them to win at their sport offends him -- this from a guy who got hairplugs and dental veneers for a leg up in his game (coincidentally, Biden's the same idiot who pushed the RAVE Act, which made possessing a baby pacifier at a party illegal), and;
The third moment was Arnold Schwarzenegger's being named GHW Bush's chairman of the Presidential Council of Sports and Physical Fitness -- after the president signed the bill outlawing steroid use. Arnold never would have been 'Mr. Universe', or a movie star, or governor, had it not been for steroids.
And someone once said Americans don't do irony.",1256428800,6,1767,4.630573248407643
3485003,4,B001B7CNW4,"The documentary 'Bigger Stronger Faster' provides valuable insight as to why so many non-professional athletes turn to steroids to make their muscles larger. The majority of the main characters are struggling with an addiction to being admired and we discover the sons' answers to the question 'what do I want my body to look like and what am I willing to do to achieve that goal?'

The mother is overweight, but still cooks fattening food. Is it because she needs the praise that she recieves from making delicious foods more than she needs to be at a healthful weight?

She raises three sons, and all three struggle with their weight as children, each turning to exercise to mold their bodies, and eventually steroids to improve their results. The oldest and youngest brothers have become dependant on steroids to provide them with bodies that give them the same kind of approval from others that their mother's cooking gives to her. We see the profile of a ""wrestler"" who is unsatisfied with coaching other athletes because he wants the limelight, and continues to audition for wrestling stardom. We see a ""weightlifter"" who only achieves the type of praise he craves when he can lift weights that are too heavy to handle without the help of steroids.

Bell spends part of the documentary linking the American obsession with ""winning"" and the use of steroids. The Bell family is really not so obsessed with 'winning' as they are with being in the limelight and being admired. For the oldest and youngest sons, steroids are the path that they take to achieve this goal.

The filmmaker tells us that he was disillusioned by the fact that his idols all used steroids, which in his minds invalidated the advice that kids could achieve their dreams through hard work and clean living. They completely missed the fact that each of the 'heroes' gave back by helping others to achieve their goals. Arnold encouraged kids to become physically fit, Hulk was famous for telling kids to say their prayers and do right, and Rocky loved his wife, family and coach. A real role model doesn't just 'win' they help and inspire others. The one brother that does find a coaching job dismisses the opportunity to share his knowledge and motivate others by saying ""those who can't do, train.""

As a long distance runner, I achieve the type of body I want through diet, running and lifting weights. I want to compete in a half marathon more than I want to sleep in, eat a tray of brownies or lay on the couch and watch TV, so I dedicate myself to training. It is the same with these brothers and the other athletes that Bell interviews in the documentary. The sticking point is when having a 'normal life' with a happy family, rewarding job and healthy body is LESS important to the athlete than his/her body image and the respect and kudos that are gained by athletic prowess. Steroid use is a warning sign that their lives and priorities are out of balance.",1254268800,,2940,4.712062256809339

While I didn't come away from the film with a new opinion on the subject (I am against the use of illegal performance enhancing drugs) I do believe I have a better appreciation for those that do use. Consider the one brother who was able to bench hundreds more than our narrator simply because he did use. It definitely puts a dent in the ""steroids don't make the player"" arguments.

However, it is a compelling look at steroids, cheating, winning, losing, being American, trying to be the best no matter what the cost, and some problems with this over-achieving.  It's also a look at how people can be torn between wanting to emulate their heroes and using questionable methods in order to accomplish this task and realize the desires.
Chris Bell even takes us inside the dynamics of his own family; he has two brothers on steroids. This is revealed to his parents at one point.  It's also left open as to how things are going to develop, so to speak, because this situation is ongoing.

8282120,4,B001B7CNW4,"This is a well thought out and researched documentary.  He covers all the major points for and against steroids and his examples and source material is right on the money.  The only thing I found a little lacking was the ending not explaining what happened to his brothers who chose to remain on steroids.

I like Mr. Bells take on all the childhood heros of the 1980s, we as kids were made to believe that huge Herculean men achieved those massive physics by natural means Hulk Hogan, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Barry Bonds etc.  Only to find out the truth, that his childhood heros were frauds and taking steroids the whole time and lying to the public about it.

The movie really makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look bad because he did admit steroid use and then totally reversed course and now condemns the practice because he went into politics.  Kind of silly for Arnold who was the premier body builder in the world to say that steroids are bad for you, look how far it got him in life.  On the same token I have a hard time blaming a ballplayer who is on the fridges of making the big leagues moving past double A and triple A.  Getting that lowest salary paycheck could profoundly change your financial future same with the rookie NFL player.

I thought the George W Bush owning the Texas Rangers was also hypocritical since it was widely known that Jose Canseco was the poster boy for steroids in baseball and basically still is.  Rafael Palmerio was also on that team and he was also busted as a steroid user.  Basically Bud Selig and the owners just looked the other way completely because Mark and Sammy were putting butts in seats why upset the gravy train.  Mr. Bell makes an excellent point that professional ballplayers have been using amphetamines (Greenies) for decades.

I found the track and Field Olympic tester fascinating in the middle of the film where he had evidence that Carl Lewis was also on Steroids during that 1988 Olympics.  If you watch ESPNs 30 for 30 9.79 you learn that the entire field for that 100 meter race was on some kind of illegal performance enhancing substance.  His Tiger Woods topic of getting eye surgery to see the ball and fairways better is definitely a competitive edge over his rivals.  The same can be said with Floyd Landis who denies steroid abuse but uses a high altitude sleeping chamber to improve performance.  Another well known athlete does the same thing oh some guy who swims named Michael Phelps.  I have a hard time rationalizing that as not cheating where do you draw the line
.
You know that he would eventually explore the Balco Victor Conte scandal, its in the movie.  Mr. Bell gets all the right pieces to fit together into his puzzle of a film and makes compelling arguments for both sides.

I love Christopher Bells example of the movie Patton with main speech by George C Scott about America loving winners.  I also really enjoyed his interviews with responsible steroid users who write for the muscle magazines who make valid points about the positive aspects of steroids.

But by the end of the film I had a hard time trying to figure out if the director was for or against steroids.  Also the film doesnt tell what happened to his 2 brothers going forward and the state of steroid legislation today so we don't know where things stand.  There is still a stigma against steroids for sure.

You can tell that both his brothers have no intention of quitting steroids regardless of their wives wanting them to stop.

What still gets me near the end of the film is that Christopher Bell still voted for Arnold and although he couldn't get an interview with him, he did have the lifelong dream of getting the handshake he idolized as a kid in the Predator movie and wound up on the cover of the L.A. Times.

Overall I found this film fascinating throughout, I felt heartache for the mom and dad who seem like everyday normal people.  The older brother Mad Dog Mike who is still chasing his 15 minutes of fame and cannot handle just being normal.  Smelly the younger brother who is actually the most gifted  natural athlete out of the brothers who wants to be a positive role model but cant quit the body building lifestyle.  The only thing the film lacked was a concrete ending telling what happened next.  I would give this 5 stars.
