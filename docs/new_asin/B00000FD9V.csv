Given the GOP's recent insistence that we revisit this radical organization from the Viet Nam Era, it's odd that this exceedingly rare and unique film featuring the infamous Bill Ayers hasn't been released on DVD.",1226016000,,339,5.035714285714286
7908050,4,B00000FD9V,"This is a very well done documentary despite what appeared to be some incooperation from the participants.  It's a shame the Weather Underground members didn't want their faces shown.  It would've been great to see their  expressions as they described their lives and beliefs.  It is clear that  the filmakers agree with the Weather Underground and they give an odd slant  that revolution was getting closer than ever (the film was done in 1975),  as the members suggested.  But it still is educational.",944697600,5,503,4.975903614457831
