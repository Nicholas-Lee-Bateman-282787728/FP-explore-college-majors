8717770,1,B00YASQTGC,"I do love operettas, I do love Offenbach, but  BUT when Offenbach is not treated as the King of Operettas and is transformed - owing to the supernatural phantasy of a poor stage director - into a common author of a  bad Broadway show I have to abandon myself to sadness. This BELLE HLNE is one of the worst I have seen. The stage director has built a very colourful performance where all the colours are a tremendous bore and the cast with their vulgarities (there are so many that I like to forget them) seem a jumble of persons in tilt.  An amazon reviewer has written   I found the gum chewing visual jokes repulsive, what's next, Orpheus picking his nose? A shame..  .  And  all seems done to amuse but all is done to irritate. Example: the famous male trio in the third act is only a disheartening rendition of something that has always - or almost always! - compelled the public to shout bis - here what does it seem? nothing. Larmore is the most disappointing Hlne I have ever seen - so stroppy. I am an Italian and I would like to have an opinion from a French operetta lover about her way of speaking la langue de Molire. Her way of saying rve is ridiculous. The rve duetto is totally to be forgotten. Nobody sings very well and the orchestra tries to respect the wonderful music  tries   At the end the public bestows hosanna, but nowadays it happens, and it happens too often. Hlas. Is the television that has taught to applaud everything? anything? The theatre is unfortunately in bad hands. I have a great collection of operetta recordings and several excellent performances of LA BELLE  HLNE - so its easy for me to forget this waste of time, this tacky thing, so I have to select among my recordings  my best HLNE and enjoy this masterpiece the right way.  Which one? Non ve lo dico!",1475971200,,1798,4.409090909090909
8717771,1,B00YASQTGC,"What a disappointment!  Larmore has a lovely voice but she wasn't particularly appealing as Helene.  And the production was tacky.  Other productions I have seen create a sense of emotional connection between Helene and Paris.  Not this one.  It's wham, bam, thank you ma'am and a cigarette.  The elimination of much of the dialogue didn't help either.  The story had gaping holes because of the cuts.",1466985600,2,401,4.984848484848484
8717772,2,B00YASQTGC,"Tiresome production. The sets are large and imposing forcing the characters to be ""over the top."" Larmore is rather ""long in the tooth"" in this role, singing in a dark, monochromatic mezzo-soprano devoid of bloom. The top is always under pitch. The tenor portraying Paris has ""wooly hair,"" which is more than a distracting. The costumes are interesting, with all Greek classic motifs as trim on uniforms on everyone from sailors to maids, to passengers. The cheerleading scene in Act I seems just a bit out of place. If you want good, clean, family fun, skip it. The director felt it too important to bring out dildos and vibrators as well as a broken off penis for Larmore to re-glue to a statue to get the audience's attention right away. There is no audience reaction. Were they there? The sound went in and out from the dialogue to chorus to aria sections. If you want to OWN a copy of this opera, skip this one. If you love one of the artists, of course, you must have it. And it is useful for students of the art to use as a compare and contrast. The lower male voices in the cast are all strong. Conductor is strong. How disappointing to have a director come in and have such a ""concept"" as to ruin a perfectly fun romp in theatre and music as this can be.",1441497600,8,1263,4.378723404255319
8717773,4,B00YASQTGC,"La Belle Helene is one of Offenbach's most popular works - in live performance. As a piece of musical theater more than a comic opera, it benefits from the energy of a live performance.

This production is the most successful video I have seen at conveying that ""live"" energy, with a few of the drawbacks of live theater.

The story is based in Greek mythology with a mixture of Kings, Queens and Gods. The music is 19th century French light classical and the setting is broadly 1960s. Offenbach fills the score with melodies: arias, waltzes, ballads and music hall pops.
Many are already familiar from Rosenthal's pastiches and Bjoerling's famous ""Au Mont Ida"" recording, and Crespin's ""dis-moi Venus"".

Jennifer Larmore is the central character, Queen Helene, and her voice is not as lush and ""spot on"" as in days past and she is a bit more zaftig, but she still can fill the role vocally and dramatically, and dominate with charm.
Her suitor Paris, trying to seduce her from her husband, is an Asian tenor, Jun-Sang Han, with a pure voice and a radiant rather than projective voice. There were no weak spots in the cast, drawn from the Hamburg State Opera. The Hamburg Philharmonic accompanies and all present a strong showing.

Everyone gets in the spirit of burlesque and plays it as a parody on many levels. Like Bernstein's ""Candide"" it is made to be a vehicle of contemporary parody and comment while it is a parody on mythology. In one instance, when the Greek King Menelaus boasts ""my children will pay, my children will pay"" and an ""Angela Merkel"" figure comes out pushing a wheelbarrow full of Euros, which gets a big reaction from the Hamburg audience.

The video quality on the DVD is fine - good shots, good angles. The set is on multi levels and good use is made of color and movement.
The audio is a fairly smooth mixture of apron and body microphones for reasonably good ambience. Occasionally they have to put more body mic in the mix but it's a convincing compromise overall, considering that many are dancing and moving as in a ""musical"". Stereo and 5.1 perspectives are slightly different, you get to choose.

One of my references is the 2000 video of the Chatelet production with Felicity Lott, Yann Beuron, Michel Senechal, Laurent Naouri and Marc Minkowski, also a fine production with many strong points. The Chatelet is set against a mostly black background while Hamburg uses a light one, set on a cruise ship on the ocean. While it doesn't quite match the energy of this, it offers ""original instruments"" and complements Hamburg State Opera Cmajor production well.

The Hamburg production isn't perfect, but the music, the energy and the humor of the show are engaging and lift it enough above the critical part of my brain, and that's one of the most important things I look for - engagement.",1441065600,4,2822,4.746938775510204
