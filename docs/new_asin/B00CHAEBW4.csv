5722201,1,B00CHAEBW4,"I hated this film for various reasons.
-Terrible Acting
-The whole film was black and white
-There was no terror, no horror, not even any thriller through the entire film
-The story is terrible and the ending makes no sense
-You see ONE ghost ONCE throughout the entire film (a ghost that had nothing to even do with the story!)
-They tried to add subplots and only threw in information completely irrelevant to the film
-The filming was very bad, the camera was constantly shaky.
-The lighting was awful, you couldn't see much.
-The sound was terrible, you could barely make out what anyone was saying.
-The editing was probably done by a 13 year old

If I could get my money back, I would. Don't bother wasting your time on this film, nor your money.",1357430400,,752,4.529411764705882
5722202,1,B00CHAEBW4,This movie sucks it was terrible please don't rent this movie cause it wasn't a good movie at all it is a waste of time renting this movie I gave it 1 star it does not deserve even a one star I was mad when I started looking at this movie on my kindle fire the actors were terrible I don't know why people waste there time making movies like this thinking it is going to be a hit when it is not going to make it to the top....:-(,1352505600,5,429,3.7777777777777777
5722203,1,B00CHAEBW4,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  God help anyone who actually pays to watch this piece of crap that I could have done better in the third grade.  I want my money back.  What's scary is that someone actually made this movie then I bought it.,1347580800,13,233,4.133333333333334
5722204,3,B00CHAEBW4,"The acting wasn't the worst I've seen, but was ok enough to make the movie tolerable.  Little too much ""Blair-Witch-ish"" though in my opinion.",1343433600,6,142,4.916666666666667
5722205,1,B00CHAEBW4,"PLEASE don't waste your money.  Not the least bit scary or thrilling.  The acting looks like a bunch of fifth graders in a school play, you can't hear most of it due to poor sound quality and after a while, you're hoping some of them are the next to go.  One of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Zero stars.  I'd give it negative if I could.",1341187200,15,341,4.029850746268656
5722206,1,B00CHAEBW4,"I wrote a comment on youtube saying that this film was awful, which was subsequently deleted and then I was blocked by the creator of this godawful film.

To summarise: poor storyline. Crap acting. Dislikable characters. Only one ghost to be seen in the entire film.

And what low budget found footage horror film lasts for 100 minutes?!?!?

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM!! IT SUCKS & THE CREATORS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW THE TRUTH BEFORE YOU'VE FORKED OUT YOUR HARD-EARNED ON IT...BY WHICH TIME IT'S TOO LATE!! MWAHAHAHAAA!

Kind regards",1374624000,,543,4.806451612903226
5722207,1,B00CHAEBW4,"This was really one of the worst movies ever made!  Horrible acting, bad script, bad everything.  We are fans of the genre, but on my goodness, this sucks.  My husband removed my movies picking privileges, for what says is forever.",1374364800,,231,4.725
5722208,3,B00CHAEBW4,"I liked this movie. It isn't as terrible as some of the other reviewers claim. Then again, I'm a fan of bad horror movies and I don't take them that seriously. Yes, the acting is terrible. And the black and white is annoying. But I found the story interesting and it kept me entertained.

Don't buy this expecting to see a high budget Hollywood movie. If you're a fan of ghost stories and can get past the bad acting, you might like it like I did.",1373500800,,447,4.1976744186046515
5722209,3,B00CHAEBW4,"At first I liked the movie and the acting wasn't that bad at first, until the character wearing the cowboy hat and mullet kind of made the second half kind of disappointing.",1371945600,,173,4.4375
5722210,2,B00CHAEBW4,"The opening parts of the film does not match the genre. Whoever heard of using a rap/rock song on a horror film? I though my TV broke because of the monochrome video but my TV is not broken after some part of the film that showed colored video.

The monochrome format is a big let down since the film also showed some parts in colored. It would have been better if all throughout the video is monochrome. But then again, when you see the characters using a computer and modern devices, you ask yourself ""What the eff was the film crew thinking?!?!"". The monochrome video does not really match the characters' timeline.

There were many unnecessary and wasted film slides. I am thinking that they only used those scenes as fillers to make the film longer. And those unnecessary parts bored me.

In my opinion, this film needs a lot of editing.",1368662400,,842,4.526315789473684
5722211,5,B00CHAEBW4,I saw this at it's premier in a theater.  Most of the cast and crew were present.  Enjoy this film for what it is and don't worry about what it isnt.  I appreciate all of the things that were required to make this film happen.  I enjoyed it. It surprised and scared me.  Thumbs up.,1366675200,2,281,4.036363636363636
5722212,1,B00CHAEBW4,"I don't know what's worse, the acting or the dialogue. Wait, I do know, it's the acting. I've seen better, deeper more interesting performances by grade schoolers. The other reviewers were kind when they called this ""awful"" and a ""piece of crap"".  Nothing's worse in a horror film than pretension mixed with no-talent actors and clueless lazy direction. I was seduced to rent this by the cover art which I have to admit is pretty good. That'll teach me...",1364688000,2,455,4.7594936708860756
5722213,1,B00CHAEBW4,"Where to begin with this travesty on video?

The ""acting"", if you could call it that, was so apallingly bad that I thought at first this must be some kind of spoof or something. Words simply fail me in describing how poorly every single person tried to play out their part in this awful movie. Thankfully, most of the characters die by then end of the film. I know, spoiler. You'll thank me later for saving you the time to watch this, ahem, ""movie"".

The ""scary"" bits in the film were just as poorly done and left me with nothing but even more contempt for this video abomination. I found myself wanting to skip ahead just to see if anything got any better. It doesn't.

Run! Run as fast you can! Get as far away from this film as you possibly can before it wastes one minute of your life that you will never get back!",1359763200,2,819,4.237179487179487
5722214,2,B00CHAEBW4,"I hoped this movie would be better than the other reviews say it is.  No, it isn't.  And I tried to like it. The acting is bad, and not just in places. The story loses focus, and, as a viewer, I got lost out of boredom. The effects are... non-existent. I thought this technique was a clever low-budget tactic, but they used it for EVERY effects moment. Some moments in the cinematography showed promise. The pacing of the movie is very slow and tedious, though.",1357776000,3,461,4.411764705882353

8581749,1,B00CHAEBW4,"Just another boring, cliched, micro budget, c-movie ""horror"" title to throw on the ""pass"" pile. No scares at all. I do have to fairly say that the acting was moderately good, but other than that you will just find yourself with yet another dull excursion into the home movie/found footage genre set in yet another cliched location (mental hospital, prison, castle, abandoned church... take your pick)...",1416528000,,403,5.121212121212121

8581751,1,B00CHAEBW4,"I love footage films but this one was just plain horrible. The plot wasn't that bad but the acting killed any shot of this being semi-entertaining. The only reason I kept watching (which I shouldn't have) was hoping it would get better and because I paid $2.99 for the rental. I usually don't read reviews before I watch anything because people can be really picky but I really wish I would have and listened before I spent the 3 bucks and almost 2 hours of my life.
