2477530,4,B000E0OBCO,"Those familiar with the radical movement know that at least once in every generation a political criminal case comes up that defines that era. One thinks of the Haymarket Martyrs in the late 19th century; Sacco and Vanzetti, probably the most famous case of all, in the 1920's; the Rosenburgs in the post-World War II 1950's Cold War period and today Mumia Abu-Jamal.  Here we look at the case of the Scottsboro Boys in the 1930's. The exposure of the tensions within American society, particularly around the intersection of race and sex, which came to the surface as a result of that case is the subject of the documentary under review.

In a certain sense this is another one of those liberal do-gooder films that the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) is known for. That is indicated in the title of the work-an American tragedy. The underlying premise is that the fate of the Boys, ugly in many aspects by the standards of that time and certainly by today's standards, was now merely a long past singular aberration of the American justice system that eventually got righted.  Tell that to the vast black and Hispanic majority of today's victims of that same `justice' system languishing in America's prison's in the overwrought `war on drugs'. Tell that to the kids down in Jena, Louisiana. But that is a story for another time.

What the PBS film does here is highlight the various legal trials and tribulations, over many years, which most of the nine Scottsboro defendants faced including four trials, many appeals and, ultimately for the lone survivor who lived long enough, a pardon. All for crimes that they did not commit and that the state of Alabama knew that they did not commit. For those unfamiliar with the case this chronology is a nice primer on the key aspects of the case. But it should make one think more about how the lives of the Scottsboro Boys were really saved.

Although the documentary tips its hat, somewhat begrudgingly, to the titanic efforts of the American Communist Party in 1931 to make the case internationally known, and gain a hearing from blacks on other social and economic issues as well, that tendency to highlight the legal side of the battle plays the filmmakers false here. There would have been no cause celebre without the communists, although the fate of the feisty New York Jewish lawyer who handled most of the stages of the case and holds center stage here is certainly of interest. As is the question of plebian anti-Semitism as a proper subject for study in its own right.

The vaunted NAACP, nominally the legal voice of the black community, did not want to touch the case because it involved accusations of interracial sex and would have wrecked havoc with their liberal base. I will argue here that without the dreaded communists to stay the state of Alabama's hand the boys would have long before been executed -or been hanging from the nearest poles.

I might also mention that the American Communist Party was acting under the Communist International's direction. On the black question in America that meant support for the slogan of national self-determination for blacks in the South (the actual configuration for that is rather weird by- black majority counties). That slogan  played a propaganda role in the background for holiday occasions during this period, called the `third period' in communist parlance, but the heart of communist work in the early 1930's were in struggles over wage equality, saving jobs, evictions, unemployed work, the fight against lynch law in the South and labor and black defense work.

For most of my adult political life I have been an anti-Stalinist leftist but for their Scottsboro Boys defense-all honor to the party and its legal arm the International Labor Defense. As pointed out above this documentary is a good primer on the case but one should Google for books on the case. Then, I hope, you will be able to agree that this case was not merely an American tragedy but a travesty.",1209945600,48,3985,4.831378299120234
2477531,5,B000E0OBCO,"This is utterly amazing that a situation of this magnitude even took place. My students were astounded by this DVD, and had many questions. Truly, a very good show of racism in America.  We need to begin teaching true history and not glossed over African and African-American history.",1171411200,27,284,4.916666666666667
2477532,4,B000E0OBCO,"Whoa.  I don't believe this was ever covered in school.  If it was, I don't remember it.  But it should have been.  It's hard to study the events that make your own country look bad.  No one wants to think poorly of his own country.  But at the same time, it does no one any good to ignore or forget those events either.  They need to be studied just as much as the moments that make us proud.

""Scottsboro"" follows the plight of 9 African-American youths wrongly accused and convicted of heinous crimes on flimsy evidence in 1930s Alabama.  This injustice was done by the all-too-willing general public and specifically, the all-white juries that heard the case.  I write ""juries"" because the case was appealed several times, each time coming back with convictions, despite the fact that no witness could be produced, no evidence could be presented, and contrary evidence and witnesses were provided!  It speaks to the evil in men's hearts, to believe what you want to believe despite everything pointing to the contrary. It speaks of racism and bigotry and unwilling to let go of the past.  African-Americans were ""free"" after the American Civil War ended, but by no means were their lives easy.  They were still 2nd class citizens, and the treatment of these poor young men is ""exhibit A.""

The only redeeming part of this story is the fact that the ""Scottsboro Nine"" do eventually escape execution and gain their freedom, although it took several years and many appeals to do it.  Much of their youth was spent languishing in prison for crimes they did not commit.  American tragedy indeed.  It begs the question, ""if this could happen in America...?""

Four stars.  A story that must be told, as embarrassing as it is for Americans.  We must own up to our past to ensure we don't repeat it.",1169164800,8,1794,4.689102564102564
2477533,4,B000E0OBCO,"In 1995, Susan Smith drowned her own sons and blamed it on a Black man.  In the 1990s, about a dozen Black men were on death row in Illinois, and none of them had actually committed the crime.  Some may think the oppression of Black men in the American criminal justice system is new or sporadic, but it has a long history.  Few outside of African-American studies enthusiasts remember the Scottsboro case.  Luckily, this program has been made to remind the masses of injustice in this country.  Because character Michael Evans was right in asserting that ""Boy is a white, racist term!"", I cringed hearing these accused being called ""boys.""  However, each of the accused were between the ages of 13 and 19 when a white woman of questionable morals framed them during the Great Depression.

This tragedy will remind many of the O.J. Simpson case of the last decade:  the dynamics were much larger than the individuals involved.  Just as Emmett Till's murderers went free, here a Southern court and its players made incorrect decisions just to maintain the status quo and tell Northerners, ""Leave us alone!""  There are elements of anti-Semitism here as well as racism.

I don't care for Andr Braugher as an actor, but he did a good job of narrating this work.  Actors re-interpreted the court dialogue, but photos were the visuals, instead of modern background actors being recorded.  People who love Court TV will love seeing this, besides the serious issues here, this is basically a court drama, a genre that many Americans love.

I continue to applaud the ""American Experience"" series for including the low points of American history and not just the high points. I also thank them for including people of color, and how we've been wronged.",1143849600,92,1742,4.841216216216216

It's sad to say in the state of Georgia things have not changed that much ,just travel through out the rural south. Travon Martin  is a classic example.",1399420800,,447,4.309523809523809
2477583,5,B000E0OBCO,Scottsboro is an excellent documentary of little known history that was the precursor to the civil rights movement of the 50's and 60's.

2477589,4,B000E0OBCO,One the most shocking portion of this film is how readily authorities believed a false story told by two white women against these innocent young black men.  And how the lies of these two women ruined the lives of these men.  As hard as this historical event was to digest it is a part of history and studying history one must view the bad along with the good.,1375315200,,360,4.279411764705882

""An American tragedy"" 9 young men was accused of raping Two White women and didn't get a fair trail. I can't believe the justice sysytem was so racial and took the words of Two white prositutes. The white boys was the one that really had sexual contact with the Two old hookers. On one of the white women's death bed, she told the truth.

2477604,3,B000E0OBCO,"Most of the same experts and primary sources from earlier documentary that is no longer available. Some better production, but I think the important aspects of the story get lost in minutiae and side plots that did little except make the documentary longer than it needed to be. Also did not give enough pertinent details about the failures of both the NAACP and the Communists to really help the Scottsboro Boys when it mattered.

I guess I wanted a version that wasn't so sanitized.",1339113600,,484,4.761904761904762

2477606,5,B000E0OBCO,I got this based on a recommendation that Amazon gives when you buy things. They were right-on. A well-done documentary that shows the injustice of the court system and the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the decision. A real travesty but one that everybody should watch. If more people watched shows like this there probably wouldn't be as much problems as we have concerning race relations. Great story.,1320624000,,410,5.044117647058823
2477607,4,B000E0OBCO,"I am from Scottsboro, Alabama, born and raised there on the ""Hill"".  The long forgotten and misunderstood neighborhood on the northwest side of Scottsboro that has seen so much abuse by the so called local government, the absolute disregard for the personal welfare of the individuals that live in that small town; and the abject hatred that is still exhibited by a large portion of the white community there against the very poor, but proud black residents; who live there with only thier Faith in God, their strong will and perserverance, and the knowledge that one day all the hatred, the wickedness of the hearts of those who have been mislead by those who are part of the past today, will all be made evident and clear before all men; and God will judge them all according to their works.  And as the word says, ""There will be weeping, and knashing of teeth"" when them that are guilty of hating their fellow men are sent to their eternal reward!
  As a man who have seen the various things that are wrong with old southern society, and as a man who have overcome the closed doors of opportunity and have made a good life for my family and self elsewhere; I have to say that what is seen in this video, and the parallels to how the children of those who have been involved in what happened then, is still happening now, but on a more subdued note.  Wicked and Evil hearts will never change, especially in an America where the large section of white americans cant even stand the fact that there have been democratically elected a Black President to office.  Never mind that that President is Harvard educated, Never mind that he was the president of the Harvard Law review and could have chosen to go on to a very lucrative career as an attourney in any high powered lawfirm.  Never mind that there have been many important contributions to American society by so many black americans, now too many to count.  No, racist america is blinded to all of those positive things, and can only see the colour of a mans' skin, and judges accordingly off that.
  What this film shows us that not only is America so busy trying to cover up the wrongs of so many miscreants, they are trying to deny that the horror of racism even exists, even when there is so much photographic and video/film evidence to the contrary.
  I pray that one day the thinkers who still believe in the ""Old South"" will come to their senses before God has enough of thier stupidity and sends them to the only place that evil people go to, which is the place of punishment for their crimes that they have committed on this earth.  My people in Scottsboro have shouldered a big burden in trying to overcome the past of a town still riddled with old south empathy; and I am happy to at least acknowledge that the new, young generation that is growing up in that town has had enough of their parents and grandparents wickedness, and have taken the lead to open up and show that not all black, or white people in the south hate each other.  To them I give  the shiny crown of achievement, and the blessings of a brighter future for a city making the best of a scarred heart.",1314403200,,3137,4.45979020979021

Education is very valuable and everyone should be teaching their children to sit in class and listen to what the instructor has to say. Those that can't need to be removed from school permanently!!
