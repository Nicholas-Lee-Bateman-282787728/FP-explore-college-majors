3726758,4,B001O4C6JE,"This video has professional musicians playing, including cello!  The music is beautifully recorded and is my favorite part of this DVD. Her voice is also very nice (not annoying), but you have the option to turn her off so that you only have the music going if you want.
  I gave it 4 stars because I don't like the goddess pose that we go into several times.",1341792000,,359,4.3283582089552235
3726759,5,B001O4C6JE,This prenatal yoga workout is about 45 minutes long.  It is divided into shorter chapters so that you could easily pick and choose which sections you do.  The DVD is very well-done.  This is a good workout for those new to yoga or more experienced in yoga.  I love the way I feel when I am finished doing it.  Excellent prenatal yoga routine.,1336867200,5,342,4.365079365079365
3726760,5,B001O4C6JE,"Feels like regular yoga.  Not a slow mo video.  Very easy to break it down into sections, if you don't have time to do the whole thing.  The music is not annoying.  It is a happy fun video.",1334016000,5,189,3.8947368421052633
3726761,4,B001O4C6JE,I have done yoga on and off for years and started again in my 3rd trimester. I had muscle cramps and wanted something to stretch and relax my legs. This video helped and gave me the strength to have a natural childbirth.  I will use this with my second pregnancy.,1333065600,5,263,4.26
3726762,4,B001O4C6JE,"Overall I enjoy this DVD. It's more relaxing than challenging but that's a good thing some days. I have been using it through my 2nd and 3rd trimesters. I used to find Desi's voice a little distracting but now I'm used to it. I like the standing poses, and feel like I get a good stretch by the end.",1326067200,2,299,4.084745762711864
3726763,5,B001O4C6JE,"I don't personally own this DVD on Prenatal Yoga with Desi Bartlett, but I have borrowed again and again from the library.
I've borrowed others too, but haven't liked them at all or nearly as much. Mostly because I felt like the instructors were to chatty or the flow between movements felt forced, and not fluid.

This video is challenging, balanced, and just the right length to give you a good work out.
I'm in my first trimester right now, so some of it seems easy to me, but I am sure that in the later months this will provide the right amount of physical challenge to keep me strong and flexible.

If there is a prenatal yoga DVD I would invest in, then this would surely be it!",1308787200,4,685,4.3023255813953485
3726764,4,B001O4C6JE,I purchased this DVD to use during pregnancy and really enjoy it. I am in my second trimester and found it to be challenging but not too much. My 2yr was even trying some Yoga. If you are looking for a way to get some exercise in then this is the right purchase. Very easy to follow.,1300838400,4,283,3.982456140350877
3726765,3,B001O4C6JE,"This is an okay prenatal yoga video, but the music and voice-over are pretty cheesy. I would recommend this particular video more for women whose focus is meditation and light workout, not someone looking for a workout to make you sweat.",1298332800,3,237,4.804878048780488
3726766,5,B001O4C6JE,"and this is my favorite.  Different people look for different emphases in prenatal yoga (and yoga in general), but I was looking for something that had an even balance between stretching, strengthening and meditation, with the mediation helping me relax my body and connect to my baby.  Others I've tried, and there have been many (by Shiva Rea, Jennifer Wolfe, Ann Richmond, Elena Brower and others), have either been too complicated and rigorous an aerobic fitness, for me meaning changing poses too quickly, for someone with minimal (but not no) yoga experience, with very skinny pregnant women, which managed to make me feel self-conscious even alone at home (I'm more average-in the size 6-8 range) which was just no fun, or on the other end, some others were a little too hippy-dippy for my taste, with what felt like an overdone and overly earnest emphasis on eastern philosophy lingo, without actual eastern philosophy.  This DVD has a voice over description of the poses rather than someone talking while doing the poses, which I prefer, because it feels as though the voice is talking us both through it together.  Many of the other DVDs, I'd try for 10-20 minutes and then give up, either tired and frustrated or bored.  I make it through this one regularly, as it has great pacing, and I feel energized afterwards. You can also do this in sections (floor, standing, meditations at the beginning and end).  I'm now in my third trimester, week 38 to be exact and I can still do and enjoy this tape, with my own modifications.  Plus I love the look and music in this, which is simple and understated, spanish guitar, and also with an option to play without instruction, if you really feel comfortable with the poses (I never got to that point, but I like the option).  I really like the simple and genuine references included throughout that help me connect me to the baby.  Beautiful overall.",1276300800,98,1902,4.774390243902439
3726797,4,B001O4C6JE,"Great prenatal workout for beginners. Gentle, 60 minute yoga that focuses on stretching, balance, and breathing. Great sequence that was easy to flow through.

3726802,1,B001O4C6JE,"Admittedly, I am not a fan of yoga breathing, 'oms', etc. I like the stretching and the workout part of it. This video was just not for me.

3726804,5,B001O4C6JE,"Easy to follow, gentle routine that I have really enjoyed for my last two pregnancies. Not too challenging but still gets my heart pumping and works my flexibility and strength while also emphasizing the bond with baby. I really like the instructor, Desi Bartlett. If she had a class where I lived I would attend in person! I definitely recommend.",1458086400,,347,4.8

3726807,4,B001O4C6JE,I have been doing this every other day since about 26 weeks. It is easy without being too easy. I find it relaxing and a great way to stretch out after my run days.,1454457600,,164,3.8529411764705883
3726808,3,B001O4C6JE,I've only done it once so far. Not quite the work out I'm used to but it's not bad,1454371200,,82,3.3684210526315788
3726809,4,B001O4C6JE,This is a really good yoga workout for pregnancy. It is more challenging the further along you become. In the first few months it isn't too challenging. Helps work on things you'll need during labor.,1451433600,,199,4.714285714285714
3726810,1,B001O4C6JE,In between it has modified practice so you have to fast firward to get the rest of it if you wanna do all in one session,1444867200,,120,3.6538461538461537

3726813,2,B001O4C6JE,"I love yoga, but I couldn't even finish this workout. The music was distracting, the voiceover never stopped and I wasn't a big fan of the chosen poses. I will need to keep searching for a prenatal yoga DVD that I like.",1442102400,3,219,4.238095238095238
3726814,5,B001O4C6JE,Easy to do even well into the third trimester. I love the stretching portions and it still feels like a light workout. At 32 weeks I can still do this whole routine.,1437782400,,165,4.1875
3726815,3,B001O4C6JE,"This is not a ""heavy work out video""... at all. It is very, very beginner level only. With that being said, it does focus on yoga, which is nice. I personally think that the 15 minutes before and after the 20 minute standing work out are useless, but the middle work out is nice. You are not going to work up a sweat or get any strength training out of this, but if you're just looking for an easy, basic yoga work out and stretching, this is your video. If you want a true work out, go elsewhere.",1431993600,2,497,4.081632653061225
3726816,4,B001O4C6JE,Awesome video. at the very end there is some extra stretches and I haven't tried them yet but they look very helpful. Easy to follow. Easy to do. Easy and gentle yoga. If you are a pro at yoga this may be too easy but if you are new to yoga or you are on your third trimester or you are just as big as a house like me then this video is perfect for you. I used to do hot yoga before my pregnancy and I know if I would use this as a replacement without being pregnant it will be too easy but I'm pregnant and this was perfect.  Highly recommend it.,1430265600,4,547,3.7982456140350878

3726824,4,B001O4C6JE,"Overall good dvd, liked the yoga portion of it if you don't mind the cheesy yoga talk during. Only thing I had trouble with was the downward dog position but if you do yoga regularly you probably wouldn't have any trouble",1428278400,,221,4.414634146341464

3726826,5,B001O4C6JE,"Calming and energizing. I've been dealing with some first trimester fatigue, and this helped me feel better. I hope that by doing yoga regularly I can be more strong and ready once it's time for labor. For now I'm modifying some poses (replacing downward dog with child's pose for example) when the sequence starts to make me feel tired- this way I've been able to complete the entire sequence without breaks.",1426118400,2,409,4.774647887323944

3726829,5,B001O4C6JE,"Just was I was looking for. Simple, easy to follow, doesn't leave me exhausted but gets in some good stretching. (been using this from months 6-9 and I have had no problems doing it)",1424044800,,182,4.382352941176471
3726830,3,B001O4C6JE,"In a word: Disappointing. I did the 7-day rental on this to try it out, and I'm really glad I didn't purchase it. Overall, I felt like it was only half a yoga practice, although I can't explain why it feels that way. But a few specific things I didn't like: It didn't seem like a true pre-natal yoga video. She mentions ""your baby"" at the beginning and end, and that's it. Everything else in between seems like a regular, albeit basic, yoga practice. There are almost no instructions for modifying the poses based on how far along you are, except for a brief reference to using a chair for support. And I agree with another reviewer who said the way Desi was using the chair seemed dangerous. There were also several poses, such as ""tree"" and ""table,"" which seemed questionable to me for women who are farther along (and/or have a large baby bump to work with). I have trouble with ""tree"" pose when I'm not pregnant! After 45 mins or so, she ends the practice, the video cuts away briefly, and she comes back to do some additional poses with a chair. I think the first 5 minutes are her showing you how to use the chair to modify some of the earlier poses, and then there's another 5 mins of new stretches. But at that point 1) who wants to have to watch the end of the video in order to do the main workout and 2) I was done with the workout. I didn't want to have to fast forward to find the section with the stretches I missed. I'm going to keep looking for a video that seems more complete and more in line with the changing needs of a pregnancy.",1423699200,,1550,4.239864864864865
3726831,4,B001O4C6JE,"Great yoga and stretches for during pregnancy. Not super strenuous, but very helpful in reducing the tightness through the hips.",1421884800,,128,5.45
3726832,5,B001O4C6JE,"Started the pregnancy out with Level 2 yoga studio classes, then worked down to Level 1, then the last month I used this DVD in the comfort of my own home.  Still challenging, and equally as relaxing.  Did this the morning I gave birth, skipped over a part or two that were quite difficult at 40 weeks.  Shavasana is short, but then the video ends and goes to the DVD menu with nice music, so I would continue the Shavasana myself.",1420502400,,431,4.296296296296297
3726833,4,B001O4C6JE,"A little strange for a yoga video, a bit too fast paced for a pregnant woman (it's hard to move an awkward belly that fast!) Pretty poor quality video. But good workout. :)",1418169600,,172,4.242424242424242
3726834,5,B001O4C6JE,"I don't really ""do"" yoga, but I was feeling so awful during my 1st trimester that I wanted to engage in some sort of physical activity.
This isn't a hard workout, but it does have a few slightly challenging parts, which is nice.
What I like most about it is how comforting Desi's voice is, and how it really helps me calm down and focus.
It's a lovely thing to do for yourself.",1418083200,,377,4.178082191780822
3726835,5,B001O4C6JE,I used this DVD at least twice a week when I was pregnant and the first few months after giving birth.  It's a great strength/stretch/calming workout for every trimester and for postpartum.  I love that the instructor doesn't make you feel like you should be doing every single pose exactly as she does.  The focus of the DVD is to maintain strength and flexibility and enjoy your pregnancy.  I have recommended it to all the moms-to-be that I know!,1417219200,,449,4.6455696202531644
3726836,5,B001O4C6JE,I find this yoga video to be just what my body needs during my pregnancy.  The music is very relaxing and the instructions along the way don't take away from the relaxation the postures bring.  I would definitely recommend it!,1416528000,,226,4.625
3726837,5,B001O4C6JE,This product was great for me. I am not an experienced yoga person so the pace and moves were great for me. Very relaxing at the same time,1415232000,,138,3.9642857142857144
3726838,1,B001O4C6JE,Don't recommend for 3rd trimester. Serious belly pains ensued after 30 mins of doing these exercises and I workout daily.,1413331200,,121,5.1
3726839,3,B001O4C6JE,The pace of the video is okay. Music is not gray. Instructions are okay.,1412899200,,72,4.214285714285714
3726840,5,B001O4C6JE,A good option for every stage of pregnancy - even near the end!  Very gentle and soothing tone in her voice.,1412294400,,108,4.142857142857143
3726841,3,B001O4C6JE,"This is a decent video. For me, it seemed to flow pretty well in the beginning and then closer to the middle to end, it seemed to jump around, breaking the flow.  For example, she asks you to grab your blocks for a pose that's totally amazing and then suddenly without warning, she asks you to lay on your side with no time for transition. She then proceeds to close the session back to the heart chakra then the video jumps to warrior poses using a folding chair. It's confusing, and who the heck has a folding chair on command like that? For me, the end is very disruptive and totally broke my good vibes. However, overall, my body feels much looser than it did in the beginning. I would suggest that you rent this video before commiting to a full purchase!
Namaste!",1409356800,,768,4.370629370629371

3726845,4,B001O4C6JE,"I'm nota big yoga fan, but this was a nice video for stretching and gentle movement. I had twins, so was very big and uncomfortable.

3726846,4,B001O4C6JE,"I found this video to be wonderfully relaxing for prenatal yoga. The one thing I would caution against is that it is a little more advanced than I would have thought. There are some sequences of stretching where you may have trouble in your third trimester especially if you are already not flexible to begin with.
Overall though, a wonderful relaxing video with effective exercises, some of which really helped my lower back pain. The instructor is gentle but not annoying like some others I have found.",1398816000,,504,4.804597701149425

While I used to practice yoga regularly years ago, and am familiar with many poses, this was such a good starting place for getting back into any form of exercise. The poses felt terrific as stretches and the warrior sequence reminded me how important it is to challenge those muscles! If you have been working out already, this will probably be way too easy for you unless you are looking for a calming yoga video for relaxation and meditation.",1397001600,2,603,4.392857142857143

The video is nice and she does do alot of good stretches and poses, however I felt like it was a tad slow for me and I really don't like that she doesn't talk to you like most workout DVD's. Instead it is narrated and, to me, felt unpersonalized. (I know, no video is personalized but it didn't get me in the zone)",1395014400,,432,4.142857142857143
3726851,3,B001O4C6JE,This DVD is OK.  I like to do deep stretching session or a solid yoga workout at least once a week.  I purchased this DVD when I became pregnant as I wanted to make sure I was practicing safe yoga.  I feel like all the movements are extremely easy and I didn't feel like I got much of a stretch/workout after finishing this DVD.  It may be a good option for those who are new to yoga or who weren't heavily active prior to becoming pregnant.,1394323200,,441,4.093023255813954
3726852,5,B001O4C6JE,"I consider myself an intermediate to advanced exerciser. As far as a vigorous work out, this isn't really what the DVD is about. Yes, it's a decent workout but there are more challening prenatal yoga DVDs. However, I love the idea of connecting with your breath and the baby. I like the rocking segment where you imagine rocking your baby while she's inside you. I love the simpleness of the setting where Desi is. I like that they show modifications. I think it's a pretty perfect DVD for moms to be! I even bought it for my sister.",1393891200,,533,4.448979591836735

If you are a beginner, some of the poses she doesn't give enough instruction on getting into the pose and how your body should be. I have done yoga here and there for a few years and felt it was fine to follow to relax for my pregnancy. I do wish she would give more time for some of the poses because either it takes me a bit to get to where I need to be and/or because I like to enjoy the pose for a little longer. I also wish that if you wanted to all the sequences it would just flow from one to the next without a weird gap.

She does provide ways to support yourself with a chair, but the picture shown was Desi straddling a folding chair with one leg through the whole.  It didn't look safe to me.  All the poses can be modified and you don't have to go as deep if balance is an issue or you're at the end of your pregnancy.  I was happy with this purchase.",1388880000,4,573,4.117117117117117

I have been doing basic yoga on YouTube once or twice a week for several months but no other workout routines, so this was great for someone at my experience level. This may not be challenging for people who are already fit, but I definitely broke a sweat by the end and could feel my heart pumping. I really enjoy that it is so relaxing and breaks up challenging movements with easier stretches. I can feel it toning my muscles but don't feel exhausted and overheated at the end. The only thing I didn't like is the music is a bit cheesy, and as others have said the online video is not broken up into sections. It was easy to fast forward through the introduction though, and I enjoy doing the full workout at once because it feels well rounded.",1381968000,,906,4.3352941176470585

The actual content of the video isn't my favorite. This was my first pre-natal yoga session and I like that it is divided into sections, but I don't find that I care for Desi Bartlett all that much - I find myself wondering how experienced she is. I have been a fan of Rodney Yee for years and I trust his Giaim videos and prefer them to most others. However, a quick search for pre-natal yoga on YouTube returned results that I have used over and over again compared to the handful of times I have done this video.

Her positions did not flow from one to another & she did not explain how to complete the movement accurately or what part of the body it was helping.

I've not been doing any kind of exercise and was pleased to find I had no trouble doing the full hour of yoga, and had only a little bit of soreness from a couple of the poses. I would classify myself as a seasoned beginner at yoga; most of the poses were very familiar to me so I had no trouble following along.

As Desi moves through the poses she doesn't talk. Instead, she opted to record the entire video without talking and then go back and record the audio as a voice over. So as I was working through the DVD she simply focused on her breathing and wore a beatific smile which I found contributed to my own serenity instead of distracting me from my own movements.

I plan to rent a couple more videos and will possibly purchase more than one, and this is definitely one that I would purchase.",1363824000,,944,4.1530054644808745

There is adequate explanation, but not too much to distract you from relaxation. There is good instruction on breathing and muscle strengthening. The atmosphere is beautiful and calming, so is the music. I like Desi's approach: its friendly and peaceful without being too crunchy and spacey. Its the perfect balance of upbeat and calming. At first I was just going to borrow it from our library, but I decided on buying it and using it at home in place of a physical yoga class.",1363651200,,610,4.657407407407407

But, after doing some research into pain relief (this pregnancy is putting my hips and legs through quite the ringer, plus I am sure once I reach the 3rd trimester my back will be killing me, if I don't do something about it) I found that prenatal yoga may be just the thing to try out. And, even though my balance needs a lot of work, I found that after going through the movements, postures, breathing, etc, just once, that I slept a whole lot better, and wasn't walking like a grandma.

I am now 37 weeks along, and I can't do the workout portion any more - Someone with more experience and stamina may be able to keep up, though.

First, it starts with a nice, calming meditation, and overall, the whole DVD flows at a calm pace. Even though it is calming, I still broke a sweat! The standing routine was challenging for me!

She also does a lot on work on the legs and balance which is great for me. I also like that you can choose different sections individually so you can lengthen and shorten your workout to your specific needs.,1359331200,,376,4.094594594594595

If you are looking for a workout that will get you sweating, this isn't the one for you. I have other pregnancy workout DVDs that are much better for getting your heart rate up and making you sweat, but I really look forward to this one when I want to melt some of my excess stress away. It is still fairly challenging in some areas but I feel like it focuses mainly on gentle, meditative movements and stretching movements.

I was a little bit into home DVD yoga before (still a novice for sure) and when I was finally ready to move a bit (around week 23) but still didn't have a ton of energy this was the PERFECT DVD to help get back into a fitness routine.  This routine gives you plenty of energy and only takes 45 minutes, the DVD also has the ability to break out the workout into smaller portions if you only have a moment, or only want to meditate.  The poses and flows are perfect for beginners, but would also work great for those who have been in to yoga for a while and just need to move a bit while pregnant.
I highly recommend this.
My only criticism, if you can even call it that, is the music in the background - it can be a bit much at times, so I've started just turning the volume down.  Totally NOT a deal breaker.  The routine says it requiresd a blanket and yoga blocks, but I just skip the one move that requires the blocks - you won't miss anything.",1350000000,7,1031,4.059113300492611

I suppose that's because I'm only doing yoga right now because my doctor recommended it for my pregnancy. I usually do Zumba, so this is a major change in pace. I've done yoga before and wasn't as bored as I was with this one, so I don't think it's because I'm a complete novice and don't know what to expect. That being said, I just finished the video and I feel very relaxed and thoroughly stretched out. If your goal is to get some relaxation and stretch sore muscles, then I would recommend it.

I also love to have the strengthening it provides thighs.  Recommend it when I know I have a friend open to yoga.  Very easily used for all yoga levels.  One thing I've learned through yoga practice is that twists can be very dangerous when pregnant.  There is one seated back stretch that is considered a twist.

I also loved that she shows you modifications for the third trimester. It was also helpful that you can pick which section to do if you are running short on time.
