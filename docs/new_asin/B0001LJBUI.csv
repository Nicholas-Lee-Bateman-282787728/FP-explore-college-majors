8013989,3,B0001LJBUI,"I mean it is kinda cool.  I like to fall asleep to movies and stuff and for some reason anime works better than Dr. Zhivago.  I bought this to do just that and it works.  I like the story well enough but there are just some moments in it when I had to roll my eyes.  ""Cry for her!"" is a moment which I guess is a emotional one but I was hoping he'd punch a hole through a guy or something instead.  It's not on the level or Bebop or Champloo or Sam 7, but it is a lot better than most of the crap on netflix today.",1364083200,,514,3.6788990825688073
8013990,5,B0001LJBUI,"I throughly enjoyed Vol. 6 of S-cry-ed! If you've been watching the whole series so far, Vol. 6 is the pay-off for the viewer with LOTS of action and the plot is finally resolved! The ending is very well-done and still leaves enough room if the creators decide to make more.
The animation remain excellent, as well as the character design and music. So aeshetically, you're in for a real treat. The storyline and character growth/development are excellent too, and both are wrapped up in this volume.
If you've enjoyed the series so far, then I don't need to tell you to go buy this NOW. if you''ve been interested in S-cry-ed, but haven't the 1st volume yet, I recommend it wholeheartedly. You may find it to be one of the best anime series ever, just like me.
One last thing, Bandai's dub is excellent and I preferred it to the Japanese version. Dubs have come a very long way in terms of quality. If you're still a naysayer of English dubs, watch dubs like S-cry-ed, Saiyuki, Rahxephon, and Hellsing. They may change your mind.",1085788800,3,1030,4.572972972972973
8013991,5,B0001LJBUI,"Wow. I just watched this final edition of S-cry-Ed and that is all I have to say. Just wow. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but after watching the first five DVD's, you just get caught up in the ending. I couldn't look away for a second. All four episodes had plenty of action, and it tied up every loose end in the story, however minor they were. It was an awesome DVD, and I reccomend it to every anime fan out there, only after viewing the first five. It is just about the most perfect ending to an anime series ever.",1085616000,2,525,4.0576923076923075
