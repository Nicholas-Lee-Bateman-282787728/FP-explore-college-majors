666188,5,6303422993,"This is an excellent series on Pacific Theater in World War II. I've looked at scores of WWII films, propaganda productions, cartoons, etc, and this one has footage in it that no other series has.

It features speeches by FDR and Churchill, has narration by people who were on the scene in the battles, and has lots of Japanese footage that I have not found anywhere else.

On top of all that, the series is incredibly inexpensive. I consider it a must-have for anyone collecting information on the Pacific Theater operations in World War II.

Note: There are a few scenes here and there of dead bodies which might upset those who are quite sensitive.",1185494400,3,651,4.643478260869565
666189,5,6303422993,"I watched this TV series while in my teens, which prompted me into becoming a Marine Corps jet fighter pilot!  Ooh Rah!!!",1181174400,,121,4.5
666190,5,6303422993,"This great DVD set covers the entire Pacific war.  Beginning with the Japanese invasion of China in the early 1930s to the Japanese surrender in September, 1945, this great collection contains footage of every major battle of the Pacific war.  Besides covering all of the ""major"" conflicts, such as Pearl Harbor, Midway, Guadalcanal, etc., there is also excellent footage of Bougainville,  New Guinea, the Aleutian campaign, and the China-Burma-India Theater.  Much of the footage contained in this set is not found anywhere else. The footage, although somewhat ""grainy"" in spots, is still very good and the battle sequences are extremely exciting to watch.

The DVDs are enclosed in a protective metal case, and also included is a colorful guide that contains photographs as well as brief descriptions of some of the weapons, personalities, and  battles of the Pacific war.

Each disc contains four 30-minute episodes, so there is over 10 hours of great Pacific war footage in this set.  The viewer will be delighted with the attention to detail and authenticity provided in each episode.  The narration which accompanies each episode is helpful to understanding the battle being described, and the footage places the viewer directly in the conflict.

I give this fine collection my highest recommendation.  I have watched the complete ""Victory at Sea"" series, and this set rates on the same high scale.  The excellent footage, filmed on land, in the air, and at sea, describes the great Pacific conflict in amazing detail.  The storage box is strong and durable, and the colorful and informative booklet provides the viewer with additional information.  This fine DVD set is a must for any World War II enthusiast.",1156982400,16,1716,5.148014440433213
666191,5,6303422993,"The value in this series is twofold.  First, there is much footage here that is otherwise not available.  Some footage, much in Victory at Sea, has been endlessly recycled in History Channel and A&E documentaries (not that this is a bad thing).  A lot of the film preserved in this series I saw for the first time.  Second, this series covers many events, such as the Bougainville campaign, which are seldom covered.  Most series on the war in the Pacific stress the war of the marines: Tarawa, Saipan, etc.  This series covers much more.  Not always scintillating, and not written as vividly as Victory at Sea, this is nonetheless worth seeing.",1134864000,15,645,4.756756756756757
666192,5,6303422993,"This is the most comprehensive of all the videos which I have seen on the subject of the Pacific War.  The series was made in 1951 by Time, Inc., and features film clips from a number of sources: American, Japanese, British, Chinese, Australian, and others.  The narration is straightforward.

666197,5,6303422993,"This is by far the best and most comprehensive documentary series on world war II in the pacific I have seen thus far. It covers the pacific war meticulously on the land, air, and sea campaigns. It was not made to entertain, but rather to inform. It covers the entire pacific theater in authentic reel films. One should not be dissappointed with the black & white and grainy quality of most of the DVDs. They are after all transfered from sources of a bygone era. But the images are often fascinating to watch. They are absolutely indespensable in the recordings of history. Where paper documents alone may fail to inspire younger generations about the desperate struggles against the brutality of Imperialist Japan, this set of visual documents could project an everlasting memory of the Allied heroism that must be remembered for life.",997833600,59,837,4.901408450704225

Honestly, this thing is so monotonous and such a reptiition that I finally gave up at disc three.
Whoever the narrator is could put a rock to sleep.

7849053,2,6303422993,"The box set packaging of this release is its best feature.  Alot of effort was spent repackaging and adding menus and extra features to this release.  It adds nothing to the documentary first shown in 1951.  There is a very annoying anti-piracy sequence on each of the five discs and way too many steps involved in getting to the actual episodes.  Another reviewer mentioned that the discs won't play in his CD player.  Two of the five discs won't play in my machine either.  The original series was 24 episodes with the opening sequence showing the title and episode number.  The episode numbers have been edited out and the episodes one, two, twenty-three and twenty-four have been omitted.  What you get are five DVDs with four episodes on each DVD.  I suggest you purchase a set that contains twenty-four episodes because things start abruptly at episode three in this release.",1350345600,3,881,4.82
7849054,4,6303422993,"Excellent coverage from beginning to end of Marine, Army, and Air Corps actions.  I would consider it weak in coverage of the naval actions.  Appears to be all original footage except one short bit of Air Force propaganda purportedly showing a radar bomb run by a B-29 crew.  Very well organized, quite complete, and quite concise.  Of course, being concise (almost 10 hours) a lot of detail is left out.  An important point, I noticed no factual errors in it, which is often not the norm.  The publisher, Madacy, is in my experience highly erratic in the quality of what they republish on these types of DVDs.  Being a naval history buff, I can give it only 4 stars.",1341100800,,667,4.554621848739496
7849055,5,6303422993,"It's one thing to read about history, and an entirely different, more humbling thing to actually SEE history via real live footage.  The 'Pacific Theatre' has been historically given short shrift compared to Germany's invasion of Europe.  That said, the rare footage (black & white, of course) is fantastic, and the narration informative.  The technique used is that of a 'newsreel', but each episode is 30 minutes long, with each DVD containing 4 episodes.  That's 10 hours of riveting footage and narration!  If you just buy 2 WW2 DVD's, make this one of them (the other being one that covers WW2 and Germany).  This is a superb historic collection of 'living' WW2 history that should be disseminated far and wide, so we don't forget about the threat Japan and Germany posed at the time.",1262304000,,789,4.850746268656716
