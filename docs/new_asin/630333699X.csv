The tagline on the New Yorker VHS case states ""What women really talk about when they're alone"" and I think this accurately describes both the nature of the film and its limitations. And as a viewer, I expect more from a plot than lots of discussions of sexual fantasies and tragedies. Nevertheless, the director, Michel Deville, does have an intriguing eye for scenes & sets and a fantastic viewpoint for dreams, as well as a fascinating way of presenting a rape scene (via anguished audio played over a bucolic setting). Overall an interesting approach that doesn't quite deliver the goods. I'd rate it 3.5 if Amazon permitted half-stars.",1499299200,,884,5.061643835616438

The company was great in regard to promptly filling and shipping the order. Unfortunately, I did not read the small print. I thought I was buying a DVD, but it's a VHS tape. It was my mistake for not reading the ad carefully. So, be sure you know what you're buying.

It does irk me that the Powers that Be will not allow me to convert a movie that I have purchased to another format - especially when the movie in question is 35 years old.",1494288000,,477,4.118279569892473
7844144,5,630333699X,"A reviewer here mentioned that ""the story line was very slow and nothing much really happened"". I couldn't agree more. A few observations. One, this film would be beyond the sensibilities of an audience brought up on Hollywood fare. Two, Dominique Sanda [or rather her character in the film] had the wackiest and the most beautiful imagination for any female character on celluloid. Three, I pity the other character in the film, Dominique Sanda's husband. He never really knew his wife at all. Even his children were more interesting and perceptive!",1464393600,,550,5.054945054945055

7844146,2,630333699X,"Perhaps I'm missing something.  But the story line was very slow and nothing much really happened.  It was neither compelling, insightful, funny, and not even erotic, albeit it seems to be headed in that direction occassionally but never gets there.  The ending was cute, but that pretty much sums it up.",1205193600,7,304,4.921568627450981
