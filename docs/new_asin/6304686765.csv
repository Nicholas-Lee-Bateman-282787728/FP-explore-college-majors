7875917,5,6304686765,"In this day of free agency and players hopping from team to team, it's nice to take a look at the superior Green Bay Packers Championships of the 1960s.  The same players, the great coaching, the tough playing.  It's all on here.  You don't have to be just a Packers fan to enjoy this look at the early days of the ""modern"" NFL",1022716800,3,327,4.158730158730159
7875918,4,6304686765,"A review of the Packers' last three championship seasons under Vince Lombardi -- 1965, 1966, 1967 -- the only negative aspect of this video is the recording was made at the EP speed instead of the SP, which means the picture quality isn't quite as strong as on most NFL Films releases. That being said, this is a detailed look at all the big games and most important players in each of these seasons. It's all in color, and it's narrated by Ray Scott (the first two seasons) and John Facenda (1967). Worthwhile for the Lombardi-era Packer fan or NFL history buff.",987206400,3,563,4.529411764705882
