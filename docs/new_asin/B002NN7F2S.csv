3959326,5,B002NN7F2S,This is a a great product -but- there appears to be scenes missing from the original tv airing. I remember character interactions that I can't find in the disc set. I have encountered this before with the Dark Angel series set. BUT- I will enjoy this anyway.,1272672000,,258,4.51063829787234
3959327,2,B002NN7F2S,"I absolutely love,love this movie!! But they took out the BEST parts of this movie!!:( I mean I have to watch on you tube to catch the parts edited out of this DVD:( honestly you are not getting your money's worth. I bought it thinking I would own one of the best novela ever made seriously. I commend Willam Levy and Maite Perroni for their amazing acting skills!! Also the best chemistry between two characters. But you are not getting the full movie this purchase... Sorry",1271030400,2,475,4.534883720930233
3959328,5,B002NN7F2S,"If you didn't get the chance to view this novela when it aired on Univision, you really missed out on one of the greatest novelas to have been produced in recent times.  However this DVD, though edited, is a great summary of novela.  It was wonderful to once again view the love story of Marichuy and Juan Miguel.  Of course there are missing scenes as this DVD mainly focuses on the story of the main characters, but personally I don't care to relive the unimportant stories.  I can honestly tell you I don't think it wasn't edited haphazardly.  If you've never seen it before, it's easy to follow along.  Some scenes of the novela I actually forgot about, so it was refreshing nontheless to see it once again.  There are English subtitles, so if you don't speak Spanish, don't worry, you too can enjoy the novela.  Please buy it, you won't regret it!  Ahora, me pinto de colores!",1269993600,3,881,4.525316455696203
3959329,3,B002NN7F2S,I enjoyed buy it but i though it was going to be full episodes of the novel. Is there one with full episodes because the one i buy is just a summary of the novel. The shipping was good. It came before the date that it said it will be here.,1269043200,,239,3.7058823529411766
3959330,3,B002NN7F2S,"I agree with the previous reviewers that this DVD should be re-done.  Though it was a good novela, some cool parts were edited out of the DVD.  I understand that the editors wanted to edit out filler and redundant scenes, and scenes by secondary characters--like the parts with Ana Julia--and just focus on Marichuy and Juan Miguel's story.
But parts where Marichuy wore fabulous outfits were cut out....like her trip to the Art Gallery with Leopardo, and Marichuy at Rocio's wedding.  Baby Juanito's baptism was cut out too.

Anyway, I'm glad I at least have a copy of this novela, but why couldn't it have been a COMPLETE BOX-SET(s) like most tv series on DVD??",1262390400,,663,4.739130434782608
3959331,2,B002NN7F2S,"I was really impressed by the quality of the videos, but this novela was cut to shreds!  All of the best parts, the ones that were the most real, were cut out.  These scenes were the whole reason why the novela was so incredibly popular.  Shame on whomever is responsible for the editing.",1261094400,22,288,4.39622641509434
3959332,4,B002NN7F2S,"I was so excited when this movie finally arrived in my mailbox. I watched it on tv when it aired but since I don't speak spanish I could only guess what the actors were talking about. So when I found out the DVD was coming out with english subtitles I jumped at ordering this item. Though I will forever love this movie because it is so sweet and romantic, the DVD is a disappointment. So many scenes were cut out that you miss the whole plot of the story.",1260835200,7,456,4.134831460674158
3959333,2,B002NN7F2S,The movie itself was great but very disappointed on the DVD. They cut off a lot of the parts in the movie out and was not happy about it because it didn't make sense in some parts. They should of made it four disc instead of three and maybe they could of fit the movie in it.,1260835200,23,275,3.8421052631578947
3959334,2,B002NN7F2S,"Yeah, there's a few telenovelas out there. But they don't seem to be very well packaged or distributed.  This year, it looks like that's going to change. I don't know why or how, but Cuidado Con El Angel has taken off like a rocket. It's talked about in the same breath as shows like Desperate Houswives or Lost. Think about it. It's not marketed to the general public. It's a household name in Hispanic/latin-american communities, but it went rogue and caught the attention of an audience who had never before paid attention to those sorts of shows before. Just like back in 1999 when Latin-American music artists came into vogue, I think 2010 will bring us another Latin explosion -- this time of soap opera stars. Something fun to watch out for.

CAVEAT EMPTOR: UTTERLY DISEMBOWELED SERIES
Disemboweled. Dessicated.  Dissembled.  Deteriorated.  Disintegrated.  Disjointed.  Disfigured.  Discordant.
Joyless.  Juiceless.  Jejune.

I have been completely cheated by this DVD set.  HANG ON TO YOUR VHS TAPES OR DV-Rs BECAUSE HOURS OF PLOT HAVE BEEN CUT OUT WITH A DULL BUTTER KNIFE.

An appalling offering.",1259971200,29,1154,5.037037037037037

3959337,1,B002NN7F2S,"It is not difficult to sell it as it was aired. LOTS of companies do.  I would gladly pay more for the REAL series.... I will never understand why they cut the heck out of this and condensed it. Like randomly ripping out half the pages of a book, the series no longer makes sense. :(  Things are referenced that never happened (to the viewer). Character evolutions are missing their context.... It's sad.

I wish I had finished watching it when it was on Netflix (un-condensed). Don't understand how they have access to the REAL thing all this time later but you couldn't burn it to a DVD properly.  :(",1495929600,6,602,4.445454545454545

3959355,3,B002NN7F2S,"I'm watching this on Netflix. There are 187 episodes on Netflix. I'm up to 110. As much as I love watching Maite Perroni and William Levy, this soap opera drags and drags and drags. Once you think they're getting back together something silly tears them apart. First he wants Marichuy  then he doesn't want Marichuy . Then she wants Juan Miguel then she doesn't want Juan Miguel. Then Juan Miguel is with someone else and doesn't want Marichuy but he doesn't want her with anyone else. It's frustrating to watch. It's a little boring to watch at times so I'll watch one or two episodes and then wait a few weeks to start up again. I like to see how it ends as strange as that sounds with everything I wrote above. This soap opera is a little silly but at the same time somewhat entertaining to watch but not enough to keep my attention for very long. I'll continue to watch bits and pieces until I'm done watching all of the episodes. ..we shall see.",1450224000,2,950,4.3977272727272725

I will probably burn it in protest to TeleVisa for their cheap product where so many worked so hard and was left on the cutting room floor...........Love the actors, music, and Mexico City.

the chemistry between them is wooow.

i gave it 3 stars due to the bad editing as how can you fit 195 ep into 3 discs without cutting out the important parts.
intially i watched it and felt it was lacking as i could not get immersed in the characters.
then i purchased the full drama (not subtitles of course) but it was deifintely worth it.

3959387,2,B002NN7F2S,I usually enjoy the convoluted plot lines required by telenovelas but this one was simply too poorly cut and edited to be mildly enjoyable. Didn't like the main character found her extremely annoying as well as most of the other characters.  Typical of telenovelas the characters act in ways that are totally irrational and this one had more than its share of irrational acts frustratingly so.  Only William Levy made it somewhat palatable.,1382832000,,440,5.013698630136986
3959388,3,B002NN7F2S,"The editing of the series could have been better. There are too many scenes and story lines left out that were critical to the story of the two main characters and too many peripheral story lines that should have been cut instead. I am trying to learn how to speak Spanish and It was helpful to see it with the English subtitles. It was a good tool for me when I viewed the whole series in Spanish on another medium and I was able to understand about 50% of the story. Maite Perroni and William Levy have great chemistry together that you almost believe that they are a couple in real life.

3959416,2,B002NN7F2S,"When I ordered this telenovela, I had already seen a part of it online... I was excited to be able to finish it. However, when I received it, I discovered that it is very edited... the quality is good but a lot of scenes are cut out. If I had not seen the beginning before watching it, I would have been very lost. Still, when I got to the part on the dvd that I had never seen, I kind of understood but still, chunks are missing. They put only the most important parts in but they mention from time to time the parts that they did not show, and this is confusing. Also, on my computer at least, the audio and the actors did not align only at the ends of the discs. This may be because they fit at least three hours on each disc. I had to mute the sound and just watch the words at the bottom of the screen. Overall, the plot is very good, as well as the actors but the quality of the discs are not very high. Still, as a general summary, twelve dollars is not a bad price to pay.",1325203200,2,980,3.92964824120603

This story tugged at my heart so many times... and I want more!

The acting is very good and I've never seen the leading actor and actress before but they are sooooo great.  I hope they continue to be in more telenovelas.  Great work!

It has english subtitles.

3959419,3,B002NN7F2S,"First off, it is important to keep in mind that this telenovela was 195 episodes long in prime time, whereas the DVD version has been condensed to 12 hours.  As a result, the much-shortened DVD version moves at warp speed, and much of the nuance gets lost. How can it be otherwise? In an hour you will watch what took two weeks or more to play out in prime time. So, for instance, ""Oh honey, I've waited so long for you"" often feels more like ""Oh honey, I waited six minutes for you"" on the at-home DVD version :) If you really want the full plot details, and to get engaged with all the character roles, this DVD telenovela is not for you. But if you simply want to watch a classic TN love story play out, and get a dose of Maite Perroni and William Levy in the bargain, this will get the job done.  It's not the greatest telenovela by a long shot, but 12 hours of Perroni & Levy at a nice price makes it worthwhile imho.  I recommend it.",1318809600,6,939,4.120218579234972

3959421,3,B002NN7F2S,"Me costo muchisimo trabajo decidirme por Comprar este Dvd ya que tengo mucho miedo de que la Telenovela no sea buena, hablando con varios Amigos/as me han dicho que no les ha gustado nada. Espero no arrepentirme...
Me Tienta Mucho la idea de que Maite Perroni y William Levy sean los Protagonistas, hacen una Exelente Pareja. Se que la Novela en Estados Unidos tubo Muy Buen Rating, que fue Todo un Exito. Por otra parte considero que tiene un Buen Elenco como Laura Zapata, Helena Rojo, Ana Patricia Rojo, Arturo Carmona, Michelle Vieth, Neila Norvind, Maya Mishalska, Rocio Banquells, Victor Noriega, Jorge da Silva, Rene Stickler etc.
A pesar de que me han comentado que Michelle Vieth no aparece en el Dvd, de todas maneras decidi comprarlo, si eso es verdad seria algo injusto, de muy mal gusto, ya que Michelle Vieth es una de las Antagonistas de la Historia, que si bien aparecia mas sobre el Final de la Novela merecia que estubiera en el Resumen, pero esperare a que me llegue el Dvd para mirarlo y contarles Mi Propia Experiencia.
Ojala No Me Desepcione...
Cuando me llegue el Dvd, lo tenga y lo mire les cuento que tal esta la Telenovela y el Resumen...
9/8/2011: La Edicion Es Pesima, Faltan Muchas, pero Muchas Escenas Importantisimas, todas las referentes a Ana Julia, como cuando Ana Julia se pelea con Onelia, cuando Ana Julia le dispara a Vicente, cuando secuestra a Marichuy e intenta incendiarla y muere al dar a luz. El Final de Estefania no esta Completo, solo dejan hasta que la llevan al Manicomio, no se ve cuando esta internada, al igual que el de su Tia Isabella, solo se ve cuando esta en la Carcel, quitan la parte en que se encuentra con Amador. Me parece de muy mal gusto que hayan sacado el Final de Amador, era uno de los Villanos
Principales y Merecian estar en el Dvd esas Escenas tan importantes, ademas Arturo Carmona hizo muy buen Papel Antagonico, al menos podrian haber dejado la persecucion
o cuando lo atrapan o la parte en que esta en la Carcel, pero no se ve nada de eso, que pena...
El Final se basa en todo lo referente a la ceguera de Marichuy, su operacion y despues la Boda, un desastre la verdad, 1 Hora y 17 Minutos solo de eso.
Esperaba que al menos tubieran un poco de coherencia al hacer la Edicion pero veo que no, que me equivoque, si bien yo no vi la Telenovela en forma Completa se que le faltan todas esas Escenas y me parece un verdadero desastre que hayan hecho tan mal Resumen, comparto la opinion con las demas personas, que deberian volverlo a hacer, editar, es una verdadera pena e injusticia que hayan destrozado una Telenovela de este tipo, sobre todo para nosotros los Fans que pretendiamos al menos tener lo mas importante de la Historia, Las Mejores Escenas, cuando en verdad solo ofrecen una cuarta parte de lo que la Novela en si muestra o tiene.",1311811200,2,2817,4.547244094488189

Yes, some details are missing, but the story was easy to follow and all of the necessary parts are there.

So, if you're new to telenovelas and/or you've never seen this one before in it's, I highly reccommend this product. As for the soap itself, it was great. The story is fun, charming, and heart warming. Maite does as excellent job and William Levy is more than just eye candy (very very hot eye candy).
