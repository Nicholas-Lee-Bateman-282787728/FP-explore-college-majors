8133965,3,B000GRTR92,"If we are to be completely honest about the films we choose to see (more specifically, the reasons/motivations why we rent or buy them), then hopefully there will be less umbrage about production values or acting or writing - if true purpose of watching the movie was to see nude women in mutually erotic situations.  Such was the case for selecting this film (as I suspect it is for pretty much anyone else who sees it).  I had no high expectations for the acting or writing or directing or lighting or original score composed for its soundtrack, nor did I have any illusions I would be pleasantly surprised by these aspects.

That having been said, I found the movie to be modestly satisfying.  There were a lot of attractive women and plenty of nudity to go with them.  Christina Nguyen deserves special mention.  She is quite lovely, and it is not so often one gets to sees nude curvy Asian women.  It is indeed a treat!  There was also plenty of girl-girl amorous encounters, although it was not very explicit and tended to resemble more of a twosome tease at a high end strip club.  Still, it wasn't too bad (at the least it was better than nothing).  Kylie Wyote (as she is called in this movie) did a good job with her erotic interaction with the other women.

As for the production values of this movie, they are rather modest.  The locations are most likely chosen for convenience, and there is a good chance the script was tailored to them.  The ""special effects"" will probably get enough harsh criticism that I do not need to add any coments myself.  However, I have helped produce many no-budget indie films, and although this one had its limitations, I thought that they managed to get something for their pocket change.  The costuming wasn't all that bad (considering).  As for the acting and writing... who cares?  I didn't think it would be good and didn't really pay that much attention to it, since that isn't why I or (insert your name) watched it.  I got what I was looking for.  As for how much I would pay to buy it, my advice would be to wait until it's a bargain on eBay or Amazon.com.",1179446400,3,2110,4.490813648293964
8133966,5,B000GRTR92,"One look at the cover to ""The Mummy's Kiss:  2nd Dynasty"" should be enough to tell you that this is really more an erotic, softcore film than a horror film...not that there is anything wrong with that, however.  The basic plot finds an aging museum curator Dr. Zita Furneaux played by Belinda Gavin, calling on the aid of Egyptian Goddess Nephthys to help restore her youth.  She uses an amulet to control a mummy, which she uses to go out and kidnap beautiful women in order to steal their ""kah"" or life essence.

Basically she steals their ""kah"" by making love to them which climaxes (excuse the pun) in a white flash of light...the mummy's kiss...Each time she does this, she becomes more beautiful and youthful and as an added bonus, the women become her submissive love slaves. Great work if you can get it!

Gorgeous Christine Nguyen is reporter Elyse Lam who is investigating the disappearance of the women but cannot convince her skeptical editor Jack about the supernatural elements.  Soon Elyse falls into the clutches of Dr. Furneaux herself.

Surprisingly, for such a low budget offering the film's technical assets are quite good.  This should be no surprise since the film was written and directed by the legendary Don Glut who has been making films for over 50 years! Few directors know how to get as much out of so little as Glut does.  The real attraction here are the stunning ladies that include Stacy Burke, Cindy Pucci, Lorielle New, Alisa Robinson, and twins Tanya & Tyler Starr.  Glut's sexual scenes are very steamy and erotic and there was great camera work throughout the film.  The meager horror elements are a mere backdrop to scads of nude women in sexy situations and I can't find much fault in that!

The performances won't garner any Oscar nominations but they are steady and capable, perhaps more capable than it has a right to be...that comes from enjoying the production and it certainly looks like all of the cast members had a good time with the film.

Extra features on the DVD include photo galleries, a making of featurette, and commentary by Glut who is simply a joy to listen to because he is so passionate about making films no matter what his budget may be.

8133967,3,B000GRTR92,"The sequel to Mummy's kiss had too much corny plots and very stupid characters. The only upside is the lesbian sex scenes. Unless you are buying it for the love scenes, don't. :(",1172275200,2,178,4.424242424242424
8133968,4,B000GRTR92,"Basically, this one was silly as a horror flick, but surpsisingly pretty decent as erotica.  The best scene involved the museum curator, Dr. Zita Furneaux (played by Belinda Gavins), right after she's sent her mummy to kidnap pretty blonde Susan (played by Stacy Burke).  She hypnotizes the captive girl and then proceeds to seduce her.  It was an excellent scene, with an older, dominant woman thoroughly enjoying the lovely body of a beautiful younger woman!  Very nice!  She kidnaps a couple of other pretty girls, as well, but that first encounter with Stacy Burke was by far the best!  I kind of forget what happenes after that.",1166140800,21,633,4.869158878504673
8133969,3,B000GRTR92,"I was going to say that this reminded me of a Fred Olen Ray film and then noticed in the credits that there were thanks credited to him. So if you like his type of movies this is pretty good but with more female frontal nudity than in his films especially the lovely Christine Nguyen she plays the reporter of a low brow tabloid.]

Nothing here to stretch the old grey matter but is an enjoyable b.movie with decent production values with extras to boot.",1165536000,11,454,4.341176470588235
