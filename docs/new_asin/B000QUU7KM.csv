2845728,4,B000QUU7KM,"What does it mean to serve?  This is the moral quandry that faces the vampires of the Brotherhood, a race of genetically-engineered beings whose moral duty it is to protect their fellow sentients - mankind.

This fascinating reworking of the vampire legend is set on an Earth similar to our own, but with some notable differences.  The most important, of course, is the existence of bloodsuckers, who were created by primitive science and breeding projects sometime in the early 18th century.  At first, these new creatures were hunted by mankind, burned at the stake and slaughtered.  However, they eventually merged somehow with the Catholic (or possibly Anglican) Church, to create a new religion, one with a main tenet espousing vampires as God's servants to mankind.

The background of this alternate Earth is a little hazy, and that's the reason why I subtracted a star (I would've liked to know more about this world), but that doesn't detract from the story, which is a neat little tale about a female detective in the city of Jamestown (Virginia?  Is this a Kingdom of Virginia?  Or an uber-British Empire?  A queen is mentioned...) who is investigating a series of Jack the Ripper-like killings with the help of a vampire 'priest', Brother Silas.

I won't give away plot details, because this movie is so much fun, you just have to watch it yourself and enjoy!  The acting is well-done, with Saffron Burrows (yummy) and Dougray Scott as the leads.

Good special effects (airships!) round out what is a very cool little gem of a movie.  Why does crap like Transformers get such wide releases, and awesome flicks like this languish in obscurity?  It's not fair, I tells ya...",1184803200,57,1683,4.880281690140845
2845729,3,B000QUU7KM,"An ambitious and well-produced film from New Zealand, this film is set in an alternate history where vampires and humans peacefully co-exist. Vampires are used to save humans from disease and humans volunteer their blood to sustain vampires.

The vampires also hold a role like that of priests.

Oddly too, all are male.

All is well until one is born who wishes to feed directly from humans in the more 'traditional' vampiric-film way

Saffron Burrows plays a cop sent to track this way-ward vampire down, along with the help of a vampire played by Dougray Scott. It's kept a state secret that there's a rogue vampire - the public can't know that there's an imbalance in their society

Although I thought great attention was paid to production values I was not impressed by the plot.

The rogue vampire seeks to spread disease which turns people into zombies akin to Dawn of the Dead - where they go on a rampage. This for me was too strange!",1180656000,12,943,4.650602409638554

2845796,4,B000QUU7KM,"The alternate world created for this movie is so detailed that it is worth the rent in and of itself. The well worn Vampire genre is a bit different in this flick because of the awful destitution and condition of the humans lives in this dark and sombre vid. The plot is based on the idea that humans are pretty much donors for the godlike Vampires in exchange for the justice, protection and order that the immortals give them...at first.  But the plot was not what made this movie unique, in fact the story though well written, the sets and design were so detailed that it was emotionally disturbing in its realism...the old cars that looked like something from the forties, the phones old clunky and corded. Old revolvers instead of high tech super guns, or sleek edged cutting weapons. The whole movie was dark and drab. The whole ambiance was shadowed and colorless. The clothing and hairstyles dowdy and frumpy. It's like watching a world that just...stopped growing and the poor humans cluelessly  remaine in a perpetual state of  dreary ignorance. In contrast the  vampires are practically worshiped. And when one of the highest borne brothers in the religious-like regime turns feral, succumbing to his animalistic urge to rend and feed on the weaker humans, enjoying the  terror and power he has over them, the regime has to deal with the rougue because not only is he a terrifying abomination, but he's also spreading a plague that turns humans into rotting, blood thirsty zombies...and the one that's responsible to bring the rouge in, is none other than his own brother....good film. Time well spent. I would recommend this vid to all the Vamp Camp.",1376697600,2,1662,4.817543859649123

2845798,4,B000QUU7KM,"Call it a vampire film, call it a futuristic fantasy, call it a warning about elitism in society; I call it a very entertaining movie, whatever may be its various possible categorizations.
A genetic superior brand of human being evolved from among the ordinary human species. For some centuries they have lived in peace with the vast majority who possess inferior capabilities. They have justified themselves as a secret society (known to the humans) by their search for means whereby they can further the welfare of the humans. Still the majority are suspicious and often afraid of them. One among their number has (only three weeks before the incidents in the film) become affected by a disease which has turned him into a ravenous, blood sucking monster-person. His brother, who is slated for a leadership position, is set the task of bringing him in before he can do more harm to humans than he already has; meanwhile, they will not inform the humans that they know who is responsible for the brutal murders.
Many stories in our literature and, later, on screen have made variations on this theme part of our own cultural store of symbols. Nonetheless, this movie makes it work, doesn't get too pseudo-scientific or pontifical. In fact, everyone associated with the film is to be given credit for a thriller that doesn't overdo things but focuses well on its human (and inhuman) interactions. This is not a film for horror or monster film aficionados; it is a film for everyone.",1367712000,,1482,4.861660079051384

I was pleasantly surprised that I liked Dougray Scott as a vampire, especially one in this very, very different (and refreshing) play on vampires. No sparkles here!",1357689600,,310,4.654545454545454
2845823,3,B000QUU7KM,"I enjoyed watching this film and I do not regret that I bought it - but it could have been a much, much better thing. Frankly, although by no means a bad thing, ""Perfect creature"" can also be seen as a study in wasted oportunities.

""Perfect creature"" describes an alternate world, mostly similar to ours, with one HUGE exception. At one moment of its history (I believe in the end Middle Age) a new breed of humans, soon to be called ""brothers"" appeared. Brothers are mutants, always male, born to regular human couples. Baby brothers are instantly identifiable by being born with pointy canines (the rest of the teeth comes later, as with regular humans). They live very, very long, almost never get sick, heal extremely rapidly even from very serious wounds and they age very, very slowly - after 300 years since the first brothers were born they all are still alive and they look healthy 50. They are very fast and impossibly strong. Their senses are much better than those of people, especially the sight, hearing and smell. And they tolerate only one kind of food - human blood.

Brothers are however different from ""classical"" vampires in many aspects. They absolutely do not fear sunlight, garlic, wooden spikes or crosses, they appear in mirrors, they can not transform in animals, mist or golden dust and they can not hypnotize people (and no, they do not shine when exposed to the sun and their bites do not create new brothers). But the most important difference is that since they appeared 300 years ago, brothers never killed a human being - not even once. In fact a covenant was formed as soon as first brothers reached adult age (we are left to understand that in the first years after the first birth some young brothers were massacred). In exchange of voluntary blood donations brothers swore to serve and protect humans. And this pact was respected - no adult brother EVER bit a human being or forced somebody to donate blood. Some accidents probably occured invoving baby brothers in the early years - nowadays those babies, who can be quite dangerous, are adopted by brotherhood as soon as they are identified. Brothers feed exclusively with donated blood.

The initial covenant was probably somehow organised by the Christian churches, because 300 years later brotherhood is based in cathedrals and all brothers are considered as priests, although the cult they serve has hardly anything to do with Christianity anymore (although the main siege of brotherhood is called Cathedral of Saint-Augustin). People come to churches to donate their blood - in exchange they are sometimes allowed to dring brothers blood, which can give visions and also sometimes cure those who are badly sick. This ritual exchange of blood symbolizes the covenant by which the two races formed a ""perfect creature"".

Brothers, who live longer and most probably do not need much sleep, are for most part scientists and they clearly contributed greatly to the development of civilization. If I understood correctly the first brothers appeared at the very end of Middle Age, in XV century, therefore the action of the film is situated somewhere between 1700 and 1800. But the technology of this alternate world is more advanced than what we had in those times. The architecture and the clothes look like in London around 1880 and there is still lots of horse-drawn carts around, but there are also cars, similar to those used around 1935. There are also telephones, radio, walkie-talkies, the earliest form of TV, gigantic Zeppelin-like airships (no airplanes though), automatic pistols, antibiotics and DNA analysis. On another hand the newspapers are crudely printed, like the ones from early Victorian era. This film shows very, very brilliantly this alternate world in a kind of ""steam-punk"" style. I found it a very fascinating thing.

The main actors did a good job in this film. Dougray Scott plays an eminent although relatively young brother named Silus, a rising figure in the church, probably the future leader of the brotherhood. Saffron Burrows, sculpturaly beautiful as always (even if here she wears rather unappealing clothes, like most of women in this world), plays a police agent, Lilly Squires. She lost her husband and only child in a recent influenza epidemy and since then she talks little and never smiles, but devotes all her time and energy to the work - which helps her forget her loss, well, at least a little. A very tough and pretty unpleasant cop, Lilly Squires is a pretty interesting character. For some reason, in this film she always carries a Japanese 8 mm Nambu 1906 automatic pistol (her partner, Jones, prefers to trust a German 9 mm Parabellum Luger 1908 - and I fully understand him).

Silus and Lilly will investigate together a wave of mysterious crimes in the slums area called Jamestown in a city which is probably London (at one moment we learn that the Queen resides there). It is a serious investigation, because as improbable as it sounds, it seems that those murders were committed by a brother - the first such a thing EVER. And considering that the city is still struggling with epidemy and people are already on the edge, the brotherhood and the human government are both terrified that the covenant could suffer from this development. Because not all humans are friendly towards brothers - far from it... And there is infinitely much more humans than brothers.

We learn almost all those things in the beginning of the film and from there a real masterpiece could originate. Sadly however, the director and the scenarist preferred to play it safe and make just a rather banal ""monster hunt"" B-movie, with a particularly weak ""villain"". And the ending is very, very disappointing - in fact it looks as if the director hoped to start a new TV series from this film or jumpstart a sequel. Therefore, although I liked many things in this film, I simply can not give it more than three stars. And it is a pity.",1354492800,,5953,4.870681145113524

2845826,5,B000QUU7KM,"I found this movies by accident while looking for vampire movies and was curious enough to get it.  It is dark, edgy and romantic.  The story is complex enough to keep you engaged until the end and the characters have depth.  The alternate universe has enough to be recognizable, yet different enough to make it interesting.  The romantic hint between the lead vampire and the police woman teases those of us who love romance.  I definately recommend this as a must view and keeper.",1300233600,,482,4.690476190476191
2845827,3,B000QUU7KM,"Perfect creature is a very visual film, set in an alternate reality somewhere around 1900. Here Vampires belong to the Brotherhood, they look after the human race and are the focus of all religion. Part of the agreement is that people donate blood to the Brotherhood and do this willingly and it is a great honour. Never has a Vampire taken a human life - until now.

Again the setting is terrific, costumes are good and this alternate reality is a harsh impoverished place. For the setting the film gets top marks.

What I found troubled me is that the film is like watching a docudrama about the alternate reality because it lacked almost all suspense. It has an evil vampire but only a few scenes have much to get excited about, and towards the end there are hardly any at all.

It makes for an o.k. viewing but I really don't know how to classify it, it isn't horror, probably more like drama - with vampires. Not very good at all.",1283644800,,935,4.424418604651163
2845828,4,B000QUU7KM,"In an alternate steampunk future in New Zealand, there lived a race of genetically made race of vampires called ""The Brotherhood"" who has been in harmony with humans for a long time who are sworn to protect humans from an infection that has been going on for years as they are considered the next step in evolution. One vamp named Silis (Dougary Scott) however is set out to find a murderous vampire that is responsible for some of the infections that have been going on for days with the help of a reluctant police officer named Lilly (Saffron Burrows).

A fascinating Science Fiction horror fantasy thriller import from New Zeland. It's one of the country's most expensive movie as it offers impressive surrealism that makes it look like a mix of the 60's and 1900's all combined in the future, with just a touch of Orwell thrown in. The film is slow paced at times but it has an intriguing storyline that makes it different than your typical vampire movie but more on the biological made vampire like in Richard Matheson's book ""I Am Legend"". There is some messages in it about prejudice and biological warfare on how they can change things unless not being careful.

2845849,2,B000QUU7KM,"This is a visually stylish movie that puts an interesting spin on the vampire myth. Unfortunately this new mythology is underused and this is, in effect, just another 'hunt the monster' movie. In this respect it is moderately successful but suffers a couple of major flaws. Neither Scott nor Burrows have been suitably cast. Both are talented actors but neither is able to bring their derivative characters to life, despite their best efforts. Scott is forced to recite some woefully portentous, painfully enunciated dialogue, and Burrows has to perform a stereotypical hard-nosed but damaged cop routine. Ally this with a rather predictable plot and the whole thing is bit of a let down. On a brighter note, the ending blatantly paves the way for a sequel.

2845850,5,B000QUU7KM,"I was a bit worried after reading the DVD box description: ""UNDERWORLD meets CHILDREN OF MEN..."", having grown extremely tired of black-leather-clad-kung-fu-vampires. Fortunately, PERFECT CREATURE keeps such things to a minimum, opting instead for a cool story about evolution, serial-murder, and religion. Oh yes, there are vampires, but they are genetic super-humans w/ a deep spiritual dimension. The church is their domain, and they are revered by (most) normal humans. Humans and vamps co-exist in peace for generations. All is fine until Edgar, one of the so-called ""brotherhood"", goes rogue, deciding to dine on human throats, rather than receive blood through the traditional, accepted way. This leads to trouble, as the church has a few secrets that are in danger of being revealed. These secrets could topple their religious heirarchy, and cause major problems w/ the humans. It's up to the police (led by Saffron Burrows) and Silus (Dougray Scott), Edgar's brother, to find and capture Edgar before the truth gets out. CREATURE is sort of a hybrid of BLADERUNNER, MATRIX, and FROM HELL, w/ vampires tossed in for good measure. I love the whole steam-driven dystopia idea! It adds a victorian flavor to the procedings, a Sherlock Holmes-ish atmosphere. Great stuff, and something different...",1263945600,,1302,5.35609756097561

That was 300 years to current time In the movie.
Now they are trained at birth to serve us. There Is alchemy Involved and a virus the creatures (And our church leaders)have created by accident.
The movie also does a awesome job at blending film noir as some described a Victorian England yet air baloons and Influenza Is humans greatest threat. This guy has some Immagination and a genius movie here.

2845869,5,B000QUU7KM,"Late last year I read the amazing book Wicked Gentlemen by Ginn Hale, an anachronistic mash-up of futuristic sci-fi technology and Victoriana, that served as my introduction to ""steampunk,"" a genre of literature and film that I'd never heard of before.

Perfect Creature, like Hale's book, is a steampunk thriller that pairs up a stoic police officer (Saffron Burrows) and an ethereal non-human (Dougray Scott) in a murder investigation/manhunt.

It takes place on a ""world not unlike our own"" where horsedrawn carriages share the streets with London black cabs, while dirigibles float silently overhead. Despite the fact that the Jamestown slums, with their rampant poverty and workhouses, seem to harken back to Dickens's Victorian England, the technology is straight out of WWII and fashion seems to span the better part of the Twentieth Century. In lesser hands, this all might have come off as cheesy, but the art direction is amazing and it was easy and enjoyable to be a part of this world for an all too brief 85 minutes. [Brevity being yet another quality it shares with Ginn Hale's book.]

Beyond the incredible worldbuilding, Perfect Creature offers moving performances by the three leads as well as the entire supporting cast. There's not a clunker in the bunch. Dougray Scott (who left me cold in Drew Barrymore's delightful Ever After) puts in a restrained and ultimately heartbreaking performance as the lonely priest/vampire and Saffron Burrows is affecting as the police captain who has never recovered from the loss of her husband and young daughter to influenza.

Where a Hollywood genre film will always sacrifice emotional impact for a cheap throwaway ""catch phrase,"" this film has none of that. It's serious and heartfelt. When someone dies, even a minor character, we are given a glimpse into the sadness of the survivor(s) and through them, we grieve too. The writer/director doesn't underestimate the intelligence of his audience; we're allowed to understand all the characters, even if we don't like them. Plus it's deeply romantic. I actually cried near the end. I never, and I mean NEVER, cry at the end of films like this. But really, my point is, there are no films like this. This isn't your typical vampire film. This is an entirely different animal. I mean, for heaven's sake, there's even an homage of sorts to one of my favourite German art-house flicks - Wings of Desire. Your typical C-Grade Hollywood vampire movie (Blood Rayne, anyone?) - this is not.

On the surface, this film might be compared to the stylish Russian sci-fi films Night Watch/Day Watch, but it has much more heart.  And there is no US film that comes close.

2845908,4,B000QUU7KM,"WOW ALL I CAN SAY IS PERFECT CREATURE IS A PERFECT MOVIE. THIS IS A WONDERFUL NEW VISION OF VAMPIRES. I AM SO SURPRISED I HAVE NOT SEEN OTHER PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS A FANTASTIC GOTHIC CLASSIC HAMMER TYPE FEEL OF A VAMPIRE FLICK MIXED WITH A LITTLE MATRIX TYPE ACTION. I WAS FLOORED WITH THIS LITTLE GEM.

THE BAD GUY IN THIS IS PLAYED BY LEO GREGORY AND HE IS WONDERFUL. I LOVE IT. THE SENSE OF CLASSIC DRACULA HORROR RUNS THROUGH THIS VAMPIRES BLOOD AND WORKS IT FULL FORCE FOR THE EYE THAT IS WATCHING. I FELT HIS ANGER, PAIN AND HATRED TOWARD MAN AND HIS OWN KIND. TO ME I WILL REMEMBER HIS FACE AS A WONDERFUL VILLAIN IN HORROR MOVIE HISTORY. THE CAMERA WORK DONE UPON HIM MAKES HIM MORE OF A BEAST IN WONDERFUL WAYS THAT THE DIRECTOR CAPTURED.

THIS IS A HORROR MOVIE THAT I CAN SEE MOVING ON IN MANY DIRECTION'S IF THEY WANTED TO DO IT. IT'S A PURE CLASSIC DARK GOTHIC TALE OF VAMPIRES DONE MODERN STYLE.

I LOVE THE CONCEPT OF THE VAMPIRE. THE NEW TWIST OF THE LEGEND. THE CAMERA WORK AND THE ACTION AND PURE EVIL FILMED IS AMAZING AND TOP NOTCH CLASSIC TYPE HORROR FEEL.

I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF VAMPIRES AND DREAMED OF BEING ONE AS A CHILD. I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH AND IT IS PURE CLASSIC STYLE. THE MOVIE IS SET IN THE OLD DAYS AND MIXED WITH AN ALTERED REALITY. IT WAS RELEASHED HERE IN AMERICA DIRECT TO VIDEO AND THAT IS A SHAME I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO GO TO THE MOVIES AND SEE THIS ONE.

THIS TO ME IS A MUST SEE VAMPIRE MOVIE. I WOULD EVEN SAY IT'S WORTH OWNING IN YOUR COLLECTION FOR A NEW VISION OF VAMPIRES WITH THE CLASSIC SENSE OF GOTHIC APPEAL ALL OVER IT.",1199145600,3,1594,4.063694267515924
2845909,3,B000QUU7KM,"Intersting horror movie made and set in New Zealand, albeit one with an alternate history. Present day humans living along side a religious order comprised soley of vampires. A crazy uber-vampire gets out of control and begins murdering humans as well as his own kind. This upsets the balance between humans and vampires. The atmosphere is eerily depressing in it's dystopian view of a present day New Zealand that is a cross between Victorian-era Britain and Britain during the 1940's. Saffron Burrows is captivating, but to be honest I love her in anything she's in. Dougray Scott is fine too. The problem with this movie though is that for a horror movie it isn't very scary. It was fairly enjoyable, but I can't really recommend it. However, for the special download price of 1.99, it was more than worth it.",1194566400,,812,4.807142857142857
2845910,4,B000QUU7KM,"This was a great new on the vampire concept that introduced and explored some great ""what ifs"". Like what if science sent us technologically backwards and we all embraced the church? The plot runs the line of Jack the Ripper, but with some unique twists. In some ways it looked like a dirty 'Ultraviolet'...except with a bit more plot and a lot less stylized fights.
  For people who love vampire flicks that actually contribute to the vampire genre in insightful ways rather than for the use of a cheap monster movie this one's for you. The actors made some great character choices and the direction did a good job making sure everything flowed together...that and the use of wires added just the polish this movie needed to give the vampires a sense of style.",1191369600,3,761,4.6716417910447765
2845911,5,B000QUU7KM,"This vampire movie is heavier on the suspense than the gore (which is unique in a movie about 'bloodsuckers').  It also focuses on characters rather than just relying on shock and awe action. Edgar is a 'bad vampire' in an alternate world where vampires have managed to live side by side with humans.  However, with all the prejudice still there from '300 years ago' when people tried their best to wipe out vampires, Edgar threatens to upset the balance.  A clever Sci-fi/Horror that leaves room for a good sequel.

They are not the ""bite everyone on the neck and go on a killing spree type of vamps,"" which is really refreshing as vampire movies go.

2845915,3,B000QUU7KM,"The plot is potentially tantalizing and fascinating. It's a vampire movie with more than a simple twist, it is a 180 turn, the vampires serve humanity (no not on a platter, but as the scientists and religious leaders). The whole movie feels like you are trying to catch up, having entered into the story half way through and having missed lots of important facts and details. This is not a real bother, just takes some time to put things together, the big problem is that the movie also feels like it stops a chapter short of a satisfying ending. The movie revolves around the nature of the brotherhood and the nature of the individual vampires, an individual versus collective motif. The question from the two brothers viewpoints is ""is this who i really am?"", either the one brother who conforms entirely to the collective's wishes or the other brother who goes rogue and kills.

It is a potentially neat and interesting theme. Even to look carefully at a piece of it would make for a spectacular movie. The problem is, despite some excellent photography and set work, the plot is fragmented enough that i really didn't get the big idea that the author intended. Resolving the movie satisfactorially must related the birth of the female vampire to the reason she is hidden from the brotherhood, a point i simply can't seem to fit into the rest of the movie, therefore being left with a serious deficiency. Now if this was a ""normal"" action movie or vampire movie, i'd ask myself ""so what?"", they don't rely much on plot and coherence for their value. This movie does, it proposes a view about service, about religion, about society that tries to make a big point, my problem is that i simply missed the point. At this point, i am blaming the movie, not myself.

The potential for a blockbuster movie was there, the plot is unique and could have explored interesting ideas. The sets and scenes are visually stunning and make the movie worth watching. But the ending is incoherent and unsatisfactory, like someone ripped the last chapter out of the book i just finished.

my rating is a 3 1/2, a 5 for plot potential and scenery and a 1 for coherence.",1187395200,18,2151,4.640419947506562
2845916,4,B000QUU7KM,"The review on the cover says ""Underworld Meets Children of Men"".  That's actually a fair synopsis.  While superior to ""Children of Men"" this movie is a little short of the excitement of ""Underworld"", yet highly watchable--thanks primarily to Dougray Scott who elevates this movie with his extraordinary acting.  It was a great addition to my Vampire movie collection.  I'm even hopeful for a sequel although the fact that this movie went straight to DVD makes that doubtful.

Strong recommend for vampire fans.",1184976000,9,510,5.170731707317073
2845917,3,B000QUU7KM,"this is an odd little movie about vampires being the guardians of humanity and they have a murderer in their midst. now its time to find the killer and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all.
set in the 1960's created by primitive science and breeding projects sometime in the early 18th century. At first, these Vampires were hunted by mankind, burned, tortured and killed. However, they eventually became a part of the Church, to create a new religion so to speak, ovampires as God's servants to mankind which I must admit was wierd but definately a cool premise.

The background is a little hazy, which is fine since films like ""the breed"" pull off about the same quality with less action and do it well. but that doesn't detract from the story, about a female detective in the city of Jamestown (feels a bit weird again and one of the characters says something about a queen? when did america get one of those?) who is investigating a series of Jack the Ripper-style killings with the help of a vampire 'priest', Brother Silas. A very strange but fairly unique vampire film worth a look
the special effects could have been a little better so I took off one star for that and lack of good special features.

3 Stars and I love vampire films but this just is not up to snuff with todays technologies. it has so much promise and even better a unique tale that fell totally short. also the bullets used to kill the vampires are the most innovative idea I've sen yet. (just remember it was filmed entirely in new zealand) loss of another star due to low quality special effects.
