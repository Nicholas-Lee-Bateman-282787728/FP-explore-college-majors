5968932,1,B00F73D2EQ,"Don't waste your money. If you want to work your core, you finally get a workout that focuses on CD #2, but it's on the floor, different kinds of sit-ups and you kill your midsection to where you won't do it consistently. So you don't get results.
I should have bought the set where the guy says that most people don't have TIME to remain constant in their workouts -- something with ""10"" in the name, and the guy who used to host an entertainment program.
Anyway, the first CD here was okay for someone just getting out of a wheelchair who can't do much. I jumped to CD #3 because I wanted to get some good moves, but it was an HOUR long. Trace amounts of moves for the core -- if there were any. Who has an hour?
The tv commercial focuses on a few moves that would work on the core, but the set isn't evenly focused and the workouts can be ridiculously long. Too long to have the time. I wish I had had the time to check out the set and come to this conclusion earlier. Now it's too late to send back. A waste of money.",1393804800,2,1021,4.0594059405940595

The workouts have been changed. I suppose updated.  But I really wanted the original workouts .",1492992000,,271,4.4

A little more challenging that it looks on the surface. Nicely done without all the ""self-selling"" so prevalent in other workout videos.",1480291200,,267,5.090909090909091
