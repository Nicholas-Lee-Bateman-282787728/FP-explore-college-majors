8638028,5,B00I0GYSS6,"Rehearals is so lyrical, so unrushed and contemplative, I quickly forgot it was a documentary - and yet, it is. Rarely are docs so beautiful and so still, leaving you, the viewer, to understand and interpret the film in an organic, moment-by-moment, way. We are all of us in the same 'rehearsal' space (both in life and during the film) and it is Cody Clarke's artistry to make us aware of it. A 'must see' if you want to open yourself to questions about art and narrative, time and beauty.",1400630400,,490,4.455555555555556
