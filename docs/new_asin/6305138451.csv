8589749,3,6305138451,"The 5 set of movies is great. Although he is dubbed in these movies in perfect english which is  a little disturbing for those that are use to Jacky's accent now. The main complaint is on the editing of these videos  where at times the action is taking place off the screen and most of it is  missed.
This is a great collection starter for any fan of Jacky Chan. It  complements his newer videos wonderfully as you can see his trademark  goofiness even then.",961372800,,458,4.341176470588235
