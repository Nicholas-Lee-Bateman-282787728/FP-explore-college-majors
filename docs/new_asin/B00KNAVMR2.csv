I hope to see more of Kelly's DVD's that put machines to good use. I am always looking for new workouts.  This DVD uses a spin bike, treadmill and elliptical. so very versatile as well. Love it!",1516579200,,325,4.078125
8660271,5,B00KNAVMR2,"I love this video.  My treadmill is finally getting some action.  I use it walking briskly and do the intervals and it's a lot of fun.  As far as I know there is no exercise vid out there that makes use of your home gym cardio equipment, so I commend Kelly Coffey-Meyer for thinking of it.",1407974400,3,289,4.125
