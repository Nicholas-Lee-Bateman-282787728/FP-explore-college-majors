7976805,1,B00007JMFS,"THIS MOVIE IS A SERIOUS LETDOWN. IN ORDER TO AVENGE HIS FATHER'S MURDER, A YOUNG MAN LEARNS MARTIAL ARTS. EXTREMELY CORNY AND BAD. JACKIE MAY HAVE DIRECTED THIS TRASH AND HE EVEN WAS THE MARTIAL ARTS DIRECTOR, BUT HE'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THIS FILM, DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS PICTURE IS ON THE COVER! THE FINAL FIGHT IS OK, BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE THIS BULLSH-T. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A REAL JACKIE CHAN MOVIE FROM THE EARLIER DAYS OF HIS CAREER, RENT OR BUY ''THE YOUNG MASTER'' OR ''POLICE STORY''.",1062892800,,504,4.315789473684211
7976806,1,B00007JMFS,"Recently I watched 36 Crazy Fists and Drunken Boxing Fist but the question is where is Jackie Chan in these movies? What a publicity stunt, they put his name and pictures on the movie but he isn't even these movies. Dont  watch these movies it is a disappointment. Go watch Fist of Legend it is  the best. Also I am looking for the Sequel to Drunken Master, where can I  find that movie?",955152000,,387,4.273972602739726
7976807,5,B00007JMFS,"First of all to fully enjoy this movie you must have the english dubbed version. The voice overs where some of the most hilarious I have ever heard in any of Jackie's movies. The fighting is not fast, but it is still pretty  good. Also the fact that the main character defeats his opponents not with  skill but with the help of friends and the use of ""dirty tricks.""  If you are used to these hong kong films, then you can throughly enjoy this  movie.",948499200,4,451,4.270588235294118
