1958719,5,B0000YEDLS,"Although I haven't purchased the vhs version of Spartacus it seems that some technical problems such as the jump between the scenes and some white points in the film pointed out by some previous reviewers have been diminished in the dvd version (shown in widescreen): I was distracted  by those imperfections only three or four times. However what most annoyed me was the ""special effects"" such as the splitting scenes and superimposing images. The sound quality is poor: there is a constant ""hiss"" that is hard to be filtered by the receiver. The lightning in the stage is rather dark. However all of that is a minor detail if one consider the work as whole: This is a great ballet that alternates vigorous and sensual dances, supported by powerful and exquisite music rightly conducted, great production and first rate performances by the dancers. Surely a must-buy ballet.",1086912000,3,875,4.9523809523809526

8004351,4,B0000YEDLS,"The Bolshoi was most energetic in this ballet which definitely is not ""graceful"" as you usually think of ballets, but rather it's very militaristic in movement.  Khachaturian's music is interpretive & moving.  The Adagio is VERY beautiful & transcendent music..",1462838400,2,261,5.5
8004352,5,B0000YEDLS,I had this version on video many years ago and it was worn out with use. This is a wonderful perfomance of a great ballet from the heyday of the Bolshoi.,1417824000,2,153,3.967741935483871

8004354,5,B0000YEDLS,This product is wonderfull. The performers are terrific like a russian dancer must be. The sound of dvd is good and the photography is great!!!,1320019200,3,143,4.76
8004355,4,B0000YEDLS,"I actually thought I was buying a version of this with Irek Mukamedov but I am glad I got to see this one.

Of, course, if it is the Bolshoi, it is wonderful.  This is no exception.  What makes this importatn is that it is an older film of an earlier cast preforming this great work.  One of the things I don't care for (and to me this marks it as an older work) was the use of double expsure in the filming to create the illusion of more cast.  I _hate_ double exposure, especially in dance where I want/need to see the full body of the dancers.  This is truly aweful to me and it keeps this work from getting five stars.

The part that makes this enjoyable for me is to see the changes in the demands of the technique over time.  The cast at this time did not have the extension of the later cast and this was most noticible  (Noticable? - sorry.  I'm a poor speller.  Please forgive me.) in the jumps by the men.  Although the dance was wonderful, the men in this version simply didn't have the extension of the men in the later cast.  In a way, this is a great thing to see.  These dancers work within much more normal bodies.  They are not hyper-extended and one does not feel hopelessly inadequate seeing them dance.  These are real people.  Thank you Bolshoi, for bringing us consistantly great dance from people with real bodies, rather than hyper-extended, impossibly lean (to down-right skeletal, as in NYCB)stick figures!  Wonderful!",1229731200,4,1444,4.40530303030303
8004356,5,B0000YEDLS,"As other reviewers have noted, this is a tribute to the art of Maris Liepa (as Crassus, the Roman general), who displays a genius for integrating the right gesture, facial expression and superbly executed dance moves to the character he is portraying. Regrettably, it is the only full-length ballet of Liepa on video, even though he achieved renown in Russia for his Giselle.

Vladimir Vasiliev's Spartacus is compelling for other reasons, as he focuses on presenting his character almost entirely through the choreography. His is a flawless, vigorous display of male dancing and one of the reasons Vasiliev was known as the greatest dancer in the world.

The complaints by other reviewers about white dots and jump cuts are superficial and only affect a small portion of the movie. Yes, this is a movie and not a videotaped live performance, and the result is a more coherent presentation of the story. A ballet movie not to be missed.",1211673600,10,936,4.917721518987341
8004357,4,B0000YEDLS,"I saw this version of Spartacus first in 1979 at a movie theater. I was a young teenager then. I remember I liked it very much, but I thought the cinematography was rather dated even then and the picture quality was poor, full of blemishes and annoying white dots, even back then. It's also sad that Aegina's parts were severely cut. All that said, it's still an amazing ballet movie. Of course, it is heavily cut (only 90 minutes). But the longest existing version which seems to be the 1990 Bolshoi version with Irek Mokhamedoff is only about 135 minutes long. Grigoryevich did not use the entire score for his choreography, nor did any other choreographer before him. The original score is 3.5 hrs. My recommendation to Spartacus fans is to buy the 1977 as well as the 1990 versions (the latter version's sound quality is unbelievable) plus a CD recording of the full score.",1149638400,7,877,4.664516129032258
8004358,3,B0000YEDLS,"Aram Khachaturian wrote the melodious score to the Spartacus ballet between 1950 and '54.  The first choreographer was Leonid Jacobson.  His version, which premiered at the Kirov on December 27, 1956, was not a real success.  The problem was that the choreography contained too much mime and not enough actual dancing.  Two years later, Igor Moiseyev staged a version for the Bolshoi, which had a similar fate; that one received only nine performances.  Later there was a revision by Jacobson, which also didn't find favor with the public.  Incidentally, excerpts from one of Jacobson's versions (it is not clear which--maybe both) can be seen in ""The Glory of the Kirov"" DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glory-of-the-Kirov-Mikhail-Baryshnikov-Rudolf-Nureyev-Natalia-Makarova-Natalia-Dudinskaya-more/dp/B000A3XZ2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glory of the Kirov / Mikhail Baryshnikov, Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova, Natalia Dudinskaya, more</a>; I don't think his choreography was all that bad, really, but you be the judge.

It wasn't till April 9, 1968 did Spartacus achieve its definitive form in a performance given at the Bolshoi, this time with choreography by Yuri Grigorovich.  His version is a three-act ballet divided into two main categories.  There are the major soldier/crowd scenes; there are also the monologues in which one of the four principal dancers is the only one onstage, and he or she dances against a dark background.  At the premiere, the four principals were: Vladimir Vasiliev as Spartacus, Ekaterina Maximova as Phrygia, Maris Liepa as Crassus, and Nina Timofeyeva as Aegina.  So with the exception of Maximova, who was replaced by Bessmertnova as Phrygia, these were the four principal dancers in this famous 1977 film, not 1979 as Amazon indicates.

But that's where the good news ends and the problems begin.  First, as others have already pointed out, they used some dated cinematic techniques that are downright irritating.  For example, they superimposed images (double exposure) to make a battle scene look bigger than it is.  Elsewhere, they slowed down the motion of one of Spartacus' leap sequences; I'm sorry, that format just doesn't suit ballet--dance movements should correspond with the music.  Furthermore, the picture itself is sometimes very dark, which makes it hard to see the corps de ballet.  And the sound quality is only passable.

Even if you can overlook all this, there remains the ultimate sacrilege.  Here we have three-quarters of the original principal cast, along with Bessmertnova and a superb corps de ballet dancing their hearts out, and the producer decides to cut forty-odd minutes of dance and music out of the film, which makes the work much less coherent.  Notable moments are the beginning of Act II, Scene 1; the Aegina monologue in Act II, Scene 2 (danced to some hauntingly beautiful music); and a series of leaps, performed by Spartacus near the end of Act II, Scene 1.

Now, lest you think I was just carping without actually presenting a solution, I'll let you in on a secret. As far as I'm aware of, there are at least three COMPLETE videos of the Grigorovich/Bolshoi-production Spartacus in existence.  All three were shot in color.

The most recent is the one starring Irek Mukhamedov and Lyudmila Semenyaka, shot live in 1990&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Khachaturian-Spartacus/dp/B0009X24R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Khachaturian: Spartacus</a>.  This is by far the best overall video of the ballet. It boasts the best picture and sound quality--with exemplary dancing to boot! Plus Mukhamedov does a version of the Act II, Scene 1, leap sequence, missing in the present film, in which the final leap looks like a spinning flying-roundhouse-kick--AMAZING!

There is another video of Mukhamedov in the role&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Khatchaturian-Spartacus-Irek-Mukhamedov-Natalya-Bessmertnova-Maria-Bylova-Yuri-Grigorovich-Bolshoi-Ballet/dp/B000EGDBLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Khatchaturian - Spartacus / Irek Mukhamedov, Natalya Bessmertnova, Maria Bylova, Yuri Grigorovich, Bolshoi Ballet</a>, and this time, he partners Bessmertnova in a 1984 live performance.  Picture and sound are of good quality.  This otherwise solid performance was marred by Mikhail Gabovich's tepid portrayal of Crassus.

A third video&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Khachaturian-Spartacus-The-Bolshoi-Theatre/dp/B0009TIL7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Khachaturian - Spartacus - The Bolshoi Theatre</a>&nbsp;was shot live in 1979. This one is marred by even worse picture and sound quality than the '77.  And some of the principals made a couple of mistakes.  However, you have the benefit of, again, seeing Vasiliev as Spartacus and, this time, Ekaterina Maximova as (the original) Phrygia in a COMPLETE performance.  Sadly, Vasiliev does a less technically-demanding version of the Act II, Scene 1, leap sequence--no roundhouse-kick.

Of the three COMPLETE videos, my #1 choice would be the '90 version, starring Muhamedov, for the very reasons I stated earlier.

His '84 is also recommendable, but it's been surpassed by the version above.

Because of the overall (poor) quality of the '79 Vasiliev, I will recommend it to true aficionados ONLY for its completeness. Alas, if only it had been better shot...
NOTE: This DVD is not in NTSC format. Rather, it is in PAL format, which means most DVD players sold in North America will not be able to play it. You can purchase a multi-format compatible DVD player at your local specialty electronics store.

The '77 Vasiliev has long been regarded as the ultimate Spartacus ballet video, because most fans have neither had the opportunity to sample, nor, indeed, even have been aware of the existence of the other Grigorovich/Bolshoi Spartacus videos.  The present version is neither fish nor flesh.  Buy it for its cult status.  But if you're looking to experience the ballet in its full glory, I suggest you look elsewhere.

FOOTNOTES:

Khachaturian's original score was NOT used in any of the aforementioned versions of the ballet.  Everybody from Jacobson to Grigorovich has used modified versions of the score.",1122249600,43,6310,5.852459016393443
8004359,5,B0000YEDLS,"Much has already been written about this, so I will add only a few points.  It would be impossible to find a better cast of dancers for this ballet.  This is a legendary performance and I have never seen an entire ensemble as up for a performance as  this one.  This performance is on movie stock, not video stock, sort of like the Russian version of cinemascope.  It is technically very well done, especially considering that at this time in history the Soviets didn't participate much in the latest Hollywood technology.  The dvd quality is perfect.  The lighting is exactly as it is supposed to be.  So stop complaining about nonsense and enjoy the perfection! (The dvd includes a nice little extra feature with Vasiliev and Plisetskaya.)",1100822400,17,741,4.7795275590551185
