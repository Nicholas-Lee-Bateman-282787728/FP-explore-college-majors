3147229,4,B0015RCULO,"Some people have a twisted sense of humor. Fortunately for me I am one of those people. Thus when certain movies or series come across my screen I find something amusing in them all. Such is the case with the release this week of the first season of `TIL DEATH DO US PART from BCI.

The series takes real cases of marriages gone bad...REAL bad...like as in death bad...and turns them into short morality plays. Each episode runs in the half hour mark and puts forth a tale of murderous matrimony. Yes the stories all end with one spouse or the other clearly deceased.

As with most anthology shows, this one has a host all its own. Director John Waters (the original HAIRSPRAY, CRY BABY) stars as the Groom Reaper. Each episode begins with a brief look at the happy couple as they are married only to have the Reaper in the background filling us viewers in that wedded bliss is not to be in the near future. Someone is headed for the grave.

This first season of the show features 13 episodes of marital mayhem ranging from older man meets younger woman to a donut king who finds marriage can't fill the holes of his life. Yes these stories may seem over the top but the series claim that they are all based on true events with only the most minor of alterations.

One thing that makes this series work is that none of the actors are name above the title celebrities whose big screen image baggage would hinder what unfolds in each half hour. Instead we have a collection of actors you don't recognize but who give above par performances compared to some of the lowest B movies released to drive ins across the land.

Waters stands out as the Groom Reaper, adding just a touch of the macabre in his style and a ton of wit in his delivery. He doesn't come off as an overblown rip off of the Crypt Keeper from TALES FROM THE CRYPT, instead presenting tidbits of wisdom about the scenes of each story to follow. In the middle he offers a comment or two on what we have already witnessed and then at the end of each, he sums up the tale. His performance is low key and yet holds the show together.

Obviously a show that delves into the darkest of topics, murder of ones spouse, is not for all. On the other hand, if you've ever had one of those days where you've thought you just couldn't take being married one more day, then you'll find the humor and the interest in this series. It's definitely not something the kids would (or should) enjoy. No doubt this is an adult program but offers less R rated material than some made for cable offerings.

Emmy material? I doubt it. But it does offer a nice distraction from the mundane offerings we're usually presented with. Great viewing? Not the best but it does entertain. Worth renting? For die hard Waters fans and those who like something a little off kilter. Otherwise stick with more mainstream offerings.",1215561600,7,2856,4.438931297709924

8259667,5,B0015RCULO,"John Waters campy performance as the Groom Reaper is one of the highlights of the end of CourtTv and the transition to TruTv.  This show follows couples after their marriage with one of the two killing the other before the end of the episode. The fun part being trying to figure out who will kill who before it is revealed to you. Everything is based on real events though it is very obviously dramatized and with cheesy jokes.  This was obviously a show that would only be able to run for a few seasons before getting old, I just wish it was able to run for more than just the one.  Enjoy this campy show while you can.",1444608000,,620,4.237288135593221

8259669,4,B0015RCULO,"If you like John Waters then you will enjoy this 1 season of marriage murders (every episode is of course about one spouse killing the other).  13 episodes of marriage murder, complete with John Waters intro and commentary.  Of course, every episode has a bit of a macabre twist, and we love the John Waters appearances (like Alfred Hitchcock).  The stories are supposedly based on true life stories, with some poetic license to keep the story fascinating.  Each episode is about 22 minutes long (no commercials), and was an enjoyable watch.  Recommended for Valentine's day or Halloween or for an anniversary gift!",1409356800,,615,4.990196078431373
8259670,5,B0015RCULO,"John Waters is god!  Or, at least he has god's wicked sense of humor.  He is a very funny man and I wish him all the bleakness in the world.  Just kidding about that bleakness part.",1389398400,,181,3.9722222222222223
8259671,5,B0015RCULO,"I am very glad I ordered the entire season. It was good to see some of these episodes again. I even became so intrigued with the stories that I began investigating the true stories-the real stories that inspired them. So far I have found the basis for The Funeral Parlor Murder, The Storage Unit Murder, and A Christmas Murder.

8259672,4,B0015RCULO,"Waters' appearances are well worth the purchase, but the stories presented are mostly second rate. Good for a few laughs if John is your cup of tea.",1360972800,,148,4.518518518518518
8259673,3,B0015RCULO,"The DVD's came in a generic solid black case (no picture). There was no indication that this was a used product, but even if it was, I would not have minded if it came in the original box/cover.  Since this is my only DVD set with no picture/title cover, I can easily identify it, but I would not order from this seller again, as I don't want to start a collection with no cover or have to make my own.

I haven't tried out the DVD's yet. I just hope they at least work when I do.",1322524800,,480,3.9381443298969074
8259674,5,B0015RCULO,"...You know if your dream was to have your fianc brutally murdered. This is honestly one of the more quirky true crime shows out there and it's a blast to watch. John Waters is hilarious as the Groom Reaper, the stories are fun and strange, there's a genuine mystery as to who's going to be the one to do the killing, the acting is really quite superb for a true crime series and to top it all off, you cannot watch this show without smiling. it's funny, insane, enjoyable and a great way to spend an afternoon. If you like your comedy dark, it doesn't get much darker than this",1316908800,,578,4.263636363636364
