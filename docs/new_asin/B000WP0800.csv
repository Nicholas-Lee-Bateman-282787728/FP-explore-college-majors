8224704,5,B000WP0800,"Rising Damp-The Movie ! , was released in 1980. It starred Frances De La Tour as Miss Ruth Jones. She plays a tenant pursued by her landlord. Set in a seedy boarding house,and it is very funny. Based on the classic British sitcom. Fans of Vicious will love the early appearance of Vi the most.",1473033600,,293,4.345454545454546

8224706,5,B000WP0800,"Leonard Rossiter, a comic genius, with a cast of perfect actors for their respective roles. Brit Coms do this so well, as do all British dramas, in my opinion.",1392249600,,159,4.517241379310345

goes with To The Manor Born, and Waiting for God",1357689600,,136,4.708333333333333
8224708,1,B000WP0800,"There are the original actors cast as miss Jones, Philip, and Rigsby but Richard Beckensfield as Alan has been replaced by another actor as Seymour which considerably upsets the dynamics of the cast. So this is no longer a movie of the series. However it is annoying to hear the same dialogue and gags lifted word for word from the series. Clearly the movie was made to cash in on the series without employing the same script writer to come up with new ideas. This was not the case in ""Steptoe and son rides again"" which I highly recommend if you liked rising damp and another comedy set in a seedy dwelling with a conniving old dad and the fall-guy son. In some ways the movie out-shone the series. Not here just do not waste your time and money.
Further more the claustrophobic back-drop complete with ugly wall-paper and fittings has been replaced by a cleaner airy house which loses the atmosphere from the series.
Lazy plaigarism and not even one of the same leading actors.",1329091200,,979,4.568181818181818
8224709,3,B000WP0800,"A retelling of the highlights from the TV series with a different actor playing the Alan character (due to Richard Beckinsale's untimely death). With no laughing audience to play off of, these scenes make the characters appear to be just going through the motions. Someone must have needed to make their flat payments to justify taking my favorite English comedy and creating this poor film. At least I was reminded where and when I laugh while watching the TV series. If you need this for collecting purposes (like me) it's cheap enough to sit through once or twice to see great material and sets made mediocre. Otherwise spend your money on the four DVDs of the television series and see the genius that is Rising Damp, Leonard Rossiter and the entire cast of eccentric English characters. };>{>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rising-Damp-Series-1/dp/B000BVM20O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rising Damp - Series 1</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rising-Damp-Series-2/dp/B000F7CDZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rising Damp - Series 2</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rising-Damp-Series-3/dp/B000K7UBUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rising Damp - Series 3</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rising-Damp-Series-4/dp/B000PC6YTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rising Damp - Series 4</a>",1243728000,,1453,7.8121212121212125
8224710,5,B000WP0800,It would be hard to beat the late Leonard Rossiter when it comes to comedy.  Excellent movie that will keep you laughing.,1233532800,,121,4.5
8224711,2,B000WP0800,"My British in-laws visit us every year for 4 months during which time I need to amuse them.  I purchased this dvd for my father-in-law at his request.  He had enjoyed the tv program of the same name in UK.  He loved this movie and laughed out loud almost continuously.  My mother-in-law smiled several times, and my husband and I winced.  It is typical 70's humor, English style.  If you like that kind of humor, you will love this dvd.",1218240000,,436,4.3875
