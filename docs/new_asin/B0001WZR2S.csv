8017458,3,B0001WZR2S,"I was an extra in this film, but it was filmed under the name: Grand Tour: Disaster in Time. Part of it was filmed in Eugene, OR on the property belonging to my uncles brother. I used to have some of the props from the set, but have lost them over the years. Honestly, this movie was a little out there for the time it was filmed. The script could use some help and so could the plot. Yet, Jeff Daniels and Arriana Richards did a great job and were very nice to work with.",1409702400,,472,3.9789473684210526

8017460,3,B0001WZR2S,This was a pretty decent made-for-TV movie a long time ago that apparently has gone out of print.  I am now finding it appearing under the title TimeScape...same cover and story line.  I did find it available here for about $15. stores.silveragefilms.com/-strse-78/Grand-Tour--dsh--Disaster/Detail.bok,1360627200,,301,6.142857142857143
8017461,4,B0001WZR2S,"After reading the book way back in the 70's, I couldn't believe seeing this on TV in the 90's. At the time, there was almost nothing like it... and since then the concept of time travel and time travel paradox has become a mainstay of sci fi. However, the movie is a little bit cluttered with drama and the original story of the book has been Hollywood-ized. I recommend reading the book instead actually. The name of it is ""Vintage Season"" and it is actually a short story usually found in compilations. But I still highly recommend watching this movie if you can buy it without being gouged on the price.",1342656000,3,606,4.468468468468468
8017462,5,B0001WZR2S,"One weekend, years ago, I was looking for a movie that: a) my family hadn't seen before; and b) wasn't junk. Not a large selection there! The picture on this video's box was NOT promising, nor was the title (""Grand Tour: Disaster in Time"", which it also goes under), but I decided to read the blurb on the back anyway.

Interesting, I thought: this almost sounds like ""Vintage Season"" [a classic, often anthologized SF story from around 1950]. I glanced at the bottom: ""Based on the novella 'Vintage Season' by Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore."" WOW! I thought: Who makes a movie about ""Vintage Season""? We watched it, and we loved it. It was the BEST movie we'd seen in at least six months---and a complete surprise. Next weekend, when my wife and I went back to get another Saturday movie, I told her, ""You know, it's kind of sad to think that we're not going to find another 'Grand Tour'.""

It has no sex, minimal violence, minimal profanity, with plot twists you can't see coming but which, in retrospect, are completely logical. It's one movie I recommend to everybody. I must have seen it at least 8 times, and I always cry at the end. Truly a lost gem.",1272585600,11,1156,4.4739336492890995
8017463,5,B0001WZR2S,"Ever since I saw this on VHS, I have enjoyed it. The innocence of the story mixes with the bile of the Judge ... the Father who never forgives. Jeff Daniels is in so many ways an everyman. And he conveys that fragility, toughness, and caring all in the one character.

The FX  are minimal, the script is excellent, and the film is great. I hesitate to say that it is a family film, but with no swearing, no gratuitous gore, it would satisfy anyone who wants to protect children from that, but also provide a great Sci-Fi  film to watch. Also, for anyone who cares little about that, its simply a fun film.

Great Justice element too. As hard done by as Jeff Daniels character is in the film, the Judge gets his due, and some parts are very heart warming.

Totally Worthwhile.",1116460800,3,775,4.354166666666667
