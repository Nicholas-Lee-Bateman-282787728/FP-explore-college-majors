4462273,5,B004SC2QAI,The video is an excellent work of art.  Very high quality video work.  The interviews and race footage are inspiring.,1314316800,2,117,4.8
4462274,5,B004SC2QAI,"I don't write reviews for items on Amazon (though I should, because I find myself reading alot of them.) I rarely participate in customer surveys or anything of the nature, but when I saw the fact that the DVD for Race Across the Sky 2010 had been released a few days ago and still didn't have any reviews, I thought I'd share my opinion of the movie.

I watched this film ""live"" during the simulcast back in the fall. Until then I had not seen the first movie, I'd only had it described to me by a fellow rider on a group ride a few weeks earlier. I have limited interest in mountain biking (I am an obsessive road bike rider), but the idea of watching a live simulcast on a weekday after work seemed like a good plan. My wife went along for the ride, and shortly before the movie she admitted that she was kind of dreading the idea of sitting in a movie about a mountain bike race for 2 hours (she's a recreational road biker who really dislikes riding off road) She would not regret her decision to tag along with me for this movie.

For as many times as I managed to catch her with a an awestruck look on her face and a tear in her eye, I found myself in the exact same predicament. This film is moving. Breathtaking, painful, and above all, inspiring. Unlike ""Race Across the Sky 2009"" this movie isn't as much about the ""racing"" as it is about the people who are riding in the ""race"". Yes, Levi is a cycling deity, you can guess he'll finish well. Dave Wiens is a staple of the race, so of course he'll be featured. What you aren't prepared for is the story of the people in the middle of the pack, or the heartbreak of the riders getting turned away at the 9 hour mark, and the triumph of the riders who roll in with just seconds to go on the clock. I have never been so moved by a sports documentary... and there are few films I can think of that have had such a positive effect on me.

On our way home after the simulcast (the theater let out around 10PM EST) my wife and I babbled manically about the movie until she finally made the statement that really sums up how this movie makes you feel. She said, ""I just want to go home and pedal."" As a sufferer of Juvenile Onset Rheumatoid Arthritis (on aggressive Remicaid treatment since she was 23), she can understand dealing with physical adversity and trying to maintain a positive attitude. The people in this film will inspire you, motivate you, and the visuals will leave you gasping for breath.

I don't review movies, nor do I spend much time typing out my thoughts, so I apologize if this review is a little amateurish. I primarily wanted to give my opinions on the film to try to help influence someone trying to decide to purchase, or at least watch ""Race Across the Sky 2010"" If you like being alive, watch this movie.",1300492800,16,2787,4.262759924385633

8439640,5,B004SC2QAI,Better than the 1st and delivered promptly. Thank you,1441843200,,53,5.0
8439641,5,B004SC2QAI,"Excellent video!  I liked this one better than the 2009 race video (which was also an excellent video) because it had more stories about all the rest of the riders in the field and went more in depth for the individuals and the race.  Music was excellent, and rider comments were hilarious.  It also showed some of the more difficult parts of the race for those where weren't able to meet the time deadline going up and coming back.  My wife watched it with me and she's not a bicyclist.  She really enjoyed it because of the rider profiles.  Highly recommended video to have in your collection.",1422230400,,595,4.514018691588785
8439642,3,B004SC2QAI,it kept my interest thru the whole show. very interesting stories of people in the event. the scenery was great and the film made it look easier than real life. Would have been better with some helmet cams and better interviews,1390176000,,227,4.560975609756097
8439643,5,B004SC2QAI,epic race and the scenery is awesome - this is a great way to spend a rainy day and get motivated to ride and train hard!,1365811200,,121,3.6923076923076925
8439644,5,B004SC2QAI,I like to watch this movie as motivation while riding my indoor spin trainer when the weather is too cold to get outside.,1362268800,,121,4.304347826086956
8439645,5,B004SC2QAI,great to watch just for the scenery of a part of the country I've never been to. The racing was just an incredible bonus. What amazing stories.,1360368000,,143,4.333333333333333
8439646,4,B004SC2QAI,I liked the human interest stories.  The film showed how hard an event it is for the non-pro and the pro alike.  Cool aerial coverage and up close video too.  Beautiful scenery too.  I would recommend this film.,1354492800,,211,4.473684210526316
8439647,5,B004SC2QAI,"In a nut shell.....watching this will make you want to go riding, will make you want to up your game to be better than you are now.  Like Levi was quoted on the cover: ""If this movie does not inspire and motivate you, get your vitals checked"".  The Leadville 100 is about both ordinary and elite athletes accomplishing the extraordinary.  Get this DVD.  Time for me to start training for this race.  See ya.",1339891200,,407,4.445945945945946
8439648,5,B004SC2QAI,"I have participated in the Leadville Trail 100 Mountain Bike Race in 2003 as well as in 2011. This documentary, by Citizen Pictures, and the one done by Citizen Pictures in 2009 are both excellent films! I feel that the creators of these films come as close as one can to capturing the magnitude of this event. The 2010 edition is slightly longer than the 2009 version; this is a good thing as there is more of an emphasis on individual stories amongst the non-professional racers. I enjoy watching this with friends and family who were not able to attend the race when I competed, so that they may get a better idea of what it is like to be a participant in such an epic event!

The cinematography is excellent and the stories of the individuals are inspiring and well presented. My only nit-pick is with the soundtrack, but this is likely a  personal taste thing as it is not terrible, just not what I would have expected for a film that is so well done in every other area.

If Race Across the Sky 2010 does not inspire you to get out and ride your bike or challenge yourself in some other way, you need some serious help!",1319587200,4,1125,4.347619047619047
