8646288,3,B00IY30K3M,"The Reunion:
Nina Cleary's (Amy Smart) father recently died with his last wish being to bring his three sons of suspended cop Sam (John Cena) & bail bondsman Leo (Ethan Embry) & ex-con Douglas (Boyd Holbrook) together so as a condition of his will, they will each collect an inheritance of $3 million if they were to run a family business together for two years. There is clear tension between Sam & Rico as they haven't seen each other in a decade while the youngest one in Douglas had never met any of his siblings previously. Meanwhile, a couple of hitmen take a corporation owner in Kyle Wills (Gregg Henry) hostage into Mexico with one of the kidnappers being identified as Leo's bailjumper named Edgar (Rio Alexander) who left him in debt, the brothers are convinced to go find him & get the reward money. In Mexico, they run into various issues such as getting information from Edgar's famous girlfriend who just happens to have an eye for Douglas, a drug lord named Verdugo (J.D. Garfield) who tells them to leave town or be killed, the kidnappers trying to kill them, meeting up with a woman named Theresa Trujillo (Lela Loren) who ends up having a common enemy with the boys, and the brothers trying to tolerate each other throughout the entire venture.

Inside Out:
A.J. (Triple H) is an ex-convict who was in jail for 13 years for manslaughter. The man to meet him when he gets out is his best friend, Jack (Michael Rapaport), who's a low-level mobster working for his father Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) & also married to A.J. ex-girlfriend Claire (Parker Posey) with them having a daughter named Pepper (Juliette Goglia). When Jack tries to get A.J. back in the game, he tells him that he's not going back into mob work & just wants to have his own business making pickles (which becomes a running joke throughout the whole movie) but ends up being at the wrong place at the wrong time when Jack accidentally shoots someone he's was only suppose to collect money from for his father causing him to handle the situation while Jack kept the money for himself & left town. It later turns out that the man Jack shot was an undercover informant for Martha (Julie White), an agent for the Louisiana Tax Board, who's out to get Dr. Vic for tax evasion & illegal smuggling but also gets the police involved when she informs Detective Calgrove (Michael Cudlitz) about her informant missing only to find out about the shooting. After Dr. Vic finds out that the deal went back & he didn't get his money, A.J. said he would handle it only for Vic to decide to take matters into his own hands. So A.J. must deal with trying to protect Jack's family & address the issues between him & Claire, dealing with Martha & Det. Calgrove who are determined to get Vic with or without his help, Jack's out of control attitude, and Vic's deadly assistant Irena (Jency Griffin) who had a habit of leaving notes saying ""Kaboom"" before something bad happens.

Bending The Rules:
Nick Blades (Adam ""Edge"" Copeland) is a New Orleans Detective currently being trial for corruption against Assistant District Attorney Theo Gold (Jamie Kennedy). On the way to court, he arrest a man named Gil (Kevin Weisman) who was holding on strongly to a newspaper before taking it from him & putting him in the custody of Officer Garcia (Jennifer Esposito) & bumps into his favorite actress Lena Gold (Jessica Walter) in the hallway not knowing that her son is the lawyer trying to put him in jail. Theo isn't have the best of luck either as his wife Kelly (Elena Lyons) has threatened to leave him & take the kids with her, has his father's (Philip Baker Hall) car stolen from his house, and gets no assistance & harassment from the police due to him having a fellow officer on trial. Due to a string of incidents happening to both men that connected them together, they become unlikely partners in order for both men to get what they want but they must deal with masked kidnappers, a Police Meter Man who's actually a mob hitman, and figuring out who is behind the criminal plot both men fell into...if they can get along long enough with Theo always trying to play by the book while Nick doesn't mind bending a rule or two to get results.

No Holds Barred:
This was the original WWE (then WWF) produced movie 2 decades before they had their own film division.  WWF Champion Rip (Hulk Hogan) has captured the attention of World Television Network head Mr. Brell (Kurt Fuller) who attempts to get Rip to sign with his company with Rip turning it down due to his contract & loyalty with another network causing Brell to resort to desperate measures including trying to eliminate Rip, sending an undercover executive to spy on him (Joan Severance) & form his own no rules fighting television program ""Battle Of The Tough Guys"" where he discovers Zues (Tom ""Tiny"" Lester Jr.) who wins the tough man tournament.  From here Brell uses his influences to get Rip to fight Zues through verbal tactics, confronting him at a children's charity event, and attacking his brother Randy (Mark Pellegrino) & his friend finally leading to the big fight between Rip & Zues only to find out right before the fight that Brell once again stacked the odds against Rip & took precautions to make sure that Zues wins the fight.  It should be noted that other WWF personalities such as Jesse Ventura, Vince McMahon, Howard Finkel, and Gene Okerland make appearances in the film as well.

""The Reunion"" was one of the most enjoyable WWE films as far as action based as the attempts at comedy/action were good & not overdone as Cena did more acting than previous two action based movies while everyone else played their parts well. ""Inside Out"" had some establish actors throughout the movie & the story was good but wasn't anything here really memorable or would make me watch it again after the first viewing.  ""Bending The Rules"" is a movie that catered directly to Edge's personality as being a cop who has a sarcastic personality but also smart & actually plays off Jamie Kennedy playing the straight man which had it's comedic moments while having a plot easy enough to understand.  ""No Holds Barred"" was one of those movies that was so bad at it's time for it's over the top plot & bad acting along with the small attempts at humor being very immature that it's re-introduction into today's viewing audience was pretty much a movie that you laugh at because it was so bad & corny.  In the end, the only movie I really liked of this collection with a replay value for me was The Reunion so it's a case of if you can't find that movie for a significant cheaper price than this 4 movie collection then just get this.",1400025600,,6656,4.609282700421941
