3042006,1,B000ZIZX4K,"This is a special gem presented by the Fleischer brothers, the only real contender to the Disney Studios juggernaut of animation in the thirties and fourties. Unfortunately, this is a very poor dub, probably a bootleg, with all the original brilliant colors washed out along with a scratchy film transfer from an old release print (not the original negative).
To add insult to injury, it is presented with  a poor two channel audio track. This is a masterpiece of humor and a charming story reminiscent of Charles Dickens. It would be a shame to be introduced to this production in this manner, although if you are not a purist and have never seen it it may be better than never viewing it at all.",1218326400,7,697,4.620967741935484
3042007,2,B000ZIZX4K,"I have not purchased this disc, but I have read reviews and comments from other animation sites, and as a result, I will say this - a company that has to disguise a film that is not PD, and not authorized by the copyright holder, with not only a new name, but also replaces the opening titles with a simulated 'aged' title is treading on very shaky ground legally.  Treat it for what it most likely is - a well-disguised bootleg, like so many others, regardless of how may look. An ""authorized release"" would not resort to hand-drawn corporate artwork for its cover. Something you can get from a $.99 bargain bin. Independent distributors may be able to get away with it simply because the copyright owners won't win enough in a lawsuit to pay the legal bills (if they ever collect). If Legacy were 'partners with Paramount', they wouldn't need to alter the name of the film, both on the cover and within the movie itself.

""Pigface""'s defence of the DVD (his only review to date), coupled with the fact that he has uploaded several images from Legacy DVD's, leads me to believe that he is actually a front for the company (he may even work there).

3042024,5,B000ZIZX4K,"Having been born and raised in Germany, this movie was actually much better known there than it seems to be here in the US. We used to watch it on TV on a regular basis until my parents bought a copy of it on VHS tape. It was ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE movies growing up. A wonderful story...with a message and a lesson to be learned, charming characters, and beautiful music.
To this day I know some of the songs by heart and can recall the melodies instantly.
With that said, I was thrilled to finally find this release. I have an 18 month old son and can't wait to share this classic treasure with him and maybe, down the road, we can introduce a few more kids to this lovely little story that deserves so much more exposure.

3042025,5,B000ZIZX4K,"A classic among classics, this was the second feature-length animated film from Fleischer Studios who were most known for their work on the original Betty Boop, Superman, and Popeye. Their first full-length movie was Gulliver's Travels was a groundbreaking follow-up to Disney's Snow White, but Mr. Bug Goes To Town was a fresher approach at an animated movie, even though it was inspired by a book by Belgian poet Maurice Maeterlinck titled The Life Of The Bee. Brothers, Dave and Max Fleischer, put alot of time and effort in completing this, even though it broke up the Fleischers for a while, and the movie itself proved to be a financial wreck. However, over the decades the movie has become viewed as a cult hit. The film was originally supposed to be titled Hoppity Goest To Town, although the current DVD release of it is called Bugville.

Set in the big city, a community of bugs live in a patch of land in the park. Their tiny community is in danger as the fence to their area has been damaged and people keep throwing cigarette butts on them setting their houses on fire. Fortunately, former resident Hoppity the grasshopper comes back home to help, and reunite with his sweetheart, Honey the bee. The greedy rich bug, Mr. Beetle has his sights set on Honey though, and frequently sets his two cronies, Swat and Smack, to fowl up Hoppity's attempts to hook up with her. Hoppity finds out their human neighbors are a couple of successful songwriters, and their incoming payment from a recording company would allow them to have their yard repaired, making the bug community safe. Mr. Beetle gets wind of this and arranges for the check to the couple from coming in, thus causing the bugs to have to seek shelter in the newly created sky rise building. Hoppity hears that the couple is getting a place on top of the building, so all the bugs make their way up the building as its being built and eventually make it to the top just as the couple moves into the new penthouse with a lavish garden for the bugs to live in.

Mr. Bug Goes To Town is truly worth seeking out and adding to your collection. It is admittedly a little longer than it should be as the plot seems to string along near the end, but it really makes for a timeless all-ages classic. Since it's in the public domain you can find this under several releases, just maybe be a little picky about the look of the quality depending on what company is doing it.",1406073600,,2432,4.537585421412301

3042029,4,B000ZIZX4K,"I have been a fan of animated shorts and feature length films for as long as I can remember. After finding a copy of Gulliver's travels which was done by the Fleisher studios, I decided to give this lesser known film a try. 'Bugville' originally named 'Hoppity Goes to Town' was released two days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, which took away any chance of it ever making an impact on the movie going audience.

The story is a simple one with classic Fleisher style animation about a group of insects looking to live in a safe place, with the hero wanting to marry his sweetheart and an evil beetle who wants her for himself. This release by Legends has done a very good job of presenting a clear and bright looking picture with good sound. Has it been restored?...probably not completely, but it looks very good, with minimal wear and I found it to look (way) more than adequate.

The extras include three unrelated shorts which don't look as good as the feature film, a brief(readable)bio on Fleischer studios and the original trailer for 'Hoppity goes to Town'.

3042030,1,B000ZIZX4K,"Do not be fooled, the Legend Films release is horrible. The quality is no better than VHS, and the title card has been removed, and replaced with the generic ""Bugsville"" title. The copyright holder on this film is Republic Pictures, and they released a copy on VHS and Laser Disc in the 1990's. So why is Legend Films calling this films ""Bugsville""? Because they are avoiding a legal matter by taken advantage of the fact that the film is in the Public Domain under that title.

3042037,5,B000ZIZX4K,"If you've seen ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life,"" this will look VERY familiar. This film is clearly the unacknowledged predecessor to these CGI tales.

""Hoppity Goes to Town/Mr. Bug Goes To Town/Bugville"" (I won't go into the tortued tale of the repeated retitling over the years, I'll just stick to HOPPITY), is somewhat of an underground cult classic. It was made in 1941 by the Max Fleischer studios and as is often noted, was released within a few days of Pearl Harbor, the film sank at the box office, and took the Fleischer studios with it. Interestingly, while the film was and is slammed by the critics, the general public loves it-especially those who loved it as children and passed it on through viewings with their offspring. Interestingly, I saw portions of this film at age 9 on television and found it somewhat strange-today, I love it as an adult! Funny enough for the kids and not too sappy for the grown folks.

Basically it is the tale of Hoppity, a Jimmy Stewartesque grasshopper who tries to save his community of insects from a crooked bug landlord and humans who disrupt the little bug town with their litter and walking (they are always in danger of being trampled by humans and for example, their town is destroyed by tossed lit cigar butts and water hoses). Hoppity leads them on a search for a paradise where they could live free from these perils, which is complicated by the crooked bug who literally profits from their misery (religiously inclined viewers might make a conncection between this and the story of Moses and the promised land). The story is rather charming, the characters are likeable, the plot flows well, and there is genuine suspense. Small and amusing asides also fill this film, espcially the jitterbug scene and Hoppity's dafffy-duck like dance while receiving an electric shock.

Adults with note the subtlety of the film's messages about the environment (in 1941, mind you), smoking, greed, hope, and loyalty to one's community. I recall reading somewhere that a reviewer described this film as an ""allegory of mankind."" In a way, it is as the story runs the gamut of human emotions and character types through the use of cartoon insects. Sort of a modern animated Aesop's fable if you will. Kids will like the comical antics of the villainous henchmen Swat the fly and Smack the mosquito among other things. Hoppity has a stick-to-it-iveness whose optimism is infectious in the face of potential disaster. Even in the film's dark moments when the crooked bugs seems to have the upper hand and his community turns against Hoppity, he still believes things will work out in the end. He's a pretty inspiring character for a 1941 cartoon!

The songs, while not particularly memorable, are not sappy (as was the case in the first Fleischer feature ""Gulliver's Travels"" two years earlier, which I found unwatchably bad as a child and have not bothered to see since).

HOPPITY is often negelected by film critics, but those who have seen this film throughout the generations love it (as evidenced by mine and the other reviews here and elsewhere on the web), and 1941's loss is our gain-this is truly one of the best cartoon features of all time. If you need a few good laughs along with some charm and inspiration-forget your psychologist and see this film!",1367107200,,3297,4.807760141093475
3042038,5,B000ZIZX4K,"Others have already talked about the film itself.  I think it's a wonderful example of classic animation, with a good storyline and engaging music.  The DVD transfer, however, if awful -- as also is noted elsewhere.  If you're going to all the trouble of authoring a DVD, why don't you do it right?  Don't they know it will get reviewed and buyers will stay away if the DVD is unwatchable (which this pretty much is)?  Look for a better copy.",1365292800,,442,4.475

3042043,1,B000ZIZX4K,"Firstly let me state I have enjoyed this movie since childhood, ...and STILL do!
It's fun, bright and such a cheerful respite from the overly hyped Disney-saccharine brashness.
I'd give the original movie itself the full FIVE stars with absolutely NO hesitation.

HOWEVER, my copy is the very worst transfer I have yet encountered. It's obviously been re-titled with a very fake opening, complete with digitally applied scratches. The credits immediately following are very blurred and out of focus, and the quality doesn't get any better when you get into the film.

It's ""watchable"" I suppose, but only JUST, if you too enjoy the nostalgia of seeing something you know you already love. Anyone new to this would probably turn it off due to the very visible pictils and general low-def haziness, ...which is such a pity. On a large screen this will be glaringly apparent.
The sound is so softly recorded that you will need almost full volume: .....be sure to lower it before going back to live TV!
My copy also had a minor glitch, but resumed play almost immediately.

In all most disappointing as this movie has such a heartwarming theme, presented without the usual mental battering we have come to expect from later Disney efforts. There are songs but they are far better integrated and less of a sensory overload than the later animations, where any sense of subtlety has been totally over ridden by frantic movement and colour, ...not to mention a mind-bending manic speed which seems necessary these days.

Elsewhere in these reviews mention is made of another release of this film in a far better transfer. DO make sure you get that one.
With SO many flaws in the presentation, this version bugs the hell out of me!",1344297600,10,1723,4.830508474576271

3042045,4,B000ZIZX4K,"When reading reviews, keep in mind that Amazon mixes reviews from multiple versions of Bugville, so pay attention to the line at the beginning that states which version is being reviewed. This review is of the Legend version.

I'm not going to get into the movie itself since it's a classic movie with loads of historical information and reviews available. Instead, I'll concentrate on this print.

The DVD features the movie, a Max Fleischer ""biography"" that's really a couple of pages of text, and three short cartoons (Two For the Zoo, Ants in Plants and You Can't Shoe A Horsefly, the latter two also available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Max-Fleischer-s-Color-Classics-Somewhere-in-Dreamland/dp/B0000687E3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Max Fleischer's Color Classics: Somewhere in Dreamland</a>). There is also a copy of the original trailer, which gives you an idea of how the faded and washed out print compares to this restoration.

The main feature opens with a scratchy looking title, and then shrinks to part of a 4:3 frame to show the rest of the titles in what I would not describe as the best of presentations. I was ready to turn it off at that point, because it seemed to be exactly as another reviewer described what looked like a bootleg to him. I tried fast forwarding or seeking a specific position, but for some reason that didn't work. It turned out that after a couple of minutes, right after the title sequence ended, it returned to full frame and continued as a fairly good restoration. It was not pristine, but was free of scratches, was sharp, and the colors were clean and vivid. The sound was a bit scratchy, but not too bad considering the age of the film.

Aside from the problem navigating the disk, it gives you a good opportunity to see a classic with pioneering techniques that Disney could not duplicate. If you want more details about Max Fleischer's Rotoscope or Stereoptical Process, you can see the documentaries that are presented in the Popeye The Sailor volumes one and two (1933-1940). They give animated films lifelike movement of characters and a three dimensional feel that was not duplicated until computer animation came along. As for the overall quality of the restoration, I'd definitely say that they did a commendable job and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",1331683200,5,2360,5.186351706036746

3042047,1,B000ZIZX4K,"""Bugville"" is an extremely poor attempt to mimic the Disney animated features. The animation is not visually interesting, the story is thin and dull, the music is extraordinarily bland, and the DVD transfer is scratchy. This movie is nothing like Dave and Max Fleischer's Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons of the 1930's, or their Superman cartoons of the 1940's. The movie has none of the creative visual gags or humor of the Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons, nor does it have the stylish animation or exciting action of the Superman cartoons. The movie also lacks the beauty and storytelling of the Disney animated features. The DVD transfer is not too bad most of the time, but the film and the sound are scratchy at times, and the animation looks a little fuzzy.",1326844800,,760,4.765151515151516

The animation style is really good and the reviewers that gave this movie 1 star due to ""poor quality"" just need to get over it.  This movie is good quality!  I've never seen the original, but this copy of the film is certainly good enough to enjoy over and over.

Even had that not happened, however, I don't think this would be accounted a classic:  the filmmakers went for an atmosphere of kooky fun, but it's hard to get into since a mood of sinister treachery hangs unrelievedly over the events.

The thing I like about this movie is the character design, which I consider well-done.  Not quite the best I've ever seen for a village of insects, though.  That award would have to go a couple of the Walt Disney Silly Symphonies (specifically, ""Woodland Cafe"" and ""Bugs in Love,"" both of which can now be seen on YouTube).

Although the Fleischers' ""Gulliver Travels"" was comprehensively restored a few years ago, this movie hasn't been retouched at all, and it shows.  But I guess this DVD an improvement over what we had a few years ago:  nothing.

Notice that the bugs start out with four fingers, then go to three.  I think the animators either ran out of time or money.",1266364800,2,1075,4.670212765957447

What I liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s. It's the songs, the clothing, automobiles, buildings lingo of the day, etc. You feel like you've stepped back into time.

From reading some of the reviews here, I see this was a hard-luck film, being released a couple of days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature-length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days, I'm sure. Too bad, because the folks missed some nice animation would have really impressed back then, almost 70 years ago. The colors are nice, drawings are good and story involving as we root for the bugs led by ""Hoppity"" and and his beautiful girl ""Honey"" to make it happily-ever-after and out of harm's way. It's also about all of them finding a grassy spot they can live and not worry about humans trampling them.

There is a nasty villain, though - ""C. Bagley Beetle"" - and two of his henchmen. Those helpers (""Swat, The Fly"" and ""Smack, the Mosquito"") are comedians, complete with their Brooklyn-ese accents! The story is a familiar one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand. The good guy, meanwhile, has the decked stacked against him but in the very end, of course, prevails.

My favorite part - this will sound worse than what it was - was when good-guy ""Hoppity"" got temporarily electrocuted and he danced in black-and-white. That was fantastic animation!

You know, it's a good thing I didn't see this as a very little kid; I would have been afraid to play outside and squash all those nice bug-people! You never know what (or who) is in that grass beneath your feet!",1236643200,4,1788,4.6455696202531644

The quality of this particular DVD is excellent. The picture is clear and the sound is very good, although still in mono.

The Fleischers' really outdid themselves with this and never quite did so again. In reading up about this release, it was the first animated feature not adapted from a work of literature. (Also, the first one to take place in contemporary times, rather than ""long ago and far away."") More recent feature cartoons such as Ants and Bugs were clearly influenced by this wonderful story. If this had originally been released a month sooner, I believe it would've been as well known as Disney's Snow White, and maybe better, since it's an original story.

3042059,5,B000ZIZX4K,"Bugville is the second re-titling of the 1941 Max Fleischer animated classic, which has otherwise been known as Hoppity Goes to Town or Mr. Bug Goes to Town, respectively.  For the uninitiated, the Fleischer brothers were an animation powerhouse that rivaled Disney at the time--producing cartoon greats like Popeye, Superman and Betty Boop--only to be undone by the extremely poor timing of this film's release (several days after Pearl Harbor).  Since the Fleischers were often distinguished from their competitors because of their use of human characters in their cartoons, as opposed to the industry standard anthropomorphic animal, I find it interesting that the film that forced them out of their own studio featured anthropomorphic animals.

History lesson aside, anyone who has seen Popeye would have an excellent feel for the style and quality of the animation in Bugville, which more or less conforms to the visuals of the Fleischers' more renowned cartoons.  Speaking directly to the quality of this particular DVD, it is certainly better than many of the other versions I've seen floating around the internet.  The picture is clear, as opposed to the blurriness that seemed to pervade the other copies I've seen.  The sound is likewise better, although still in mono.  Overall, if you're interested in acquiring a version of Mr. Bug/Hoppity, this Bugville release seems to be the best readily available.

Noteworthy extras include biographical information on the Fleischers and several more of their cartoon shorts.",1228348800,37,1527,5.333333333333333
3276503,1,B000ZIZX4K,"This is a special gem presented by the Fleischer brothers, the only real contender to the Disney Studios juggernaut of animation in the thirties and fourties. Unfortunately, this is a very poor dub, probably a bootleg, with all the original brilliant colors washed out along with a scratchy film transfer from an old release print (not the original negative).
To add insult to injury, it is presented with  a poor two channel audio track. This is a masterpiece of humor and a charming story reminiscent of Charles Dickens. It would be a shame to be introduced to this production in this manner, although if you are not a purist and have never seen it it may be better than never viewing it at all.",1218326400,7,697,4.620967741935484
3276504,2,B000ZIZX4K,"I have not purchased this disc, but I have read reviews and comments from other animation sites, and as a result, I will say this - a company that has to disguise a film that is not PD, and not authorized by the copyright holder, with not only a new name, but also replaces the opening titles with a simulated 'aged' title is treading on very shaky ground legally.  Treat it for what it most likely is - a well-disguised bootleg, like so many others, regardless of how may look. An ""authorized release"" would not resort to hand-drawn corporate artwork for its cover. Something you can get from a $.99 bargain bin. Independent distributors may be able to get away with it simply because the copyright owners won't win enough in a lawsuit to pay the legal bills (if they ever collect). If Legacy were 'partners with Paramount', they wouldn't need to alter the name of the film, both on the cover and within the movie itself.

""Pigface""'s defence of the DVD (his only review to date), coupled with the fact that he has uploaded several images from Legacy DVD's, leads me to believe that he is actually a front for the company (he may even work there).

3276522,5,B000ZIZX4K,"A classic among classics, this was the second feature-length animated film from Fleischer Studios who were most known for their work on the original Betty Boop, Superman, and Popeye. Their first full-length movie was Gulliver's Travels was a groundbreaking follow-up to Disney's Snow White, but Mr. Bug Goes To Town was a fresher approach at an animated movie, even though it was inspired by a book by Belgian poet Maurice Maeterlinck titled The Life Of The Bee. Brothers, Dave and Max Fleischer, put alot of time and effort in completing this, even though it broke up the Fleischers for a while, and the movie itself proved to be a financial wreck. However, over the decades the movie has become viewed as a cult hit. The film was originally supposed to be titled Hoppity Goest To Town, although the current DVD release of it is called Bugville.

Set in the big city, a community of bugs live in a patch of land in the park. Their tiny community is in danger as the fence to their area has been damaged and people keep throwing cigarette butts on them setting their houses on fire. Fortunately, former resident Hoppity the grasshopper comes back home to help, and reunite with his sweetheart, Honey the bee. The greedy rich bug, Mr. Beetle has his sights set on Honey though, and frequently sets his two cronies, Swat and Smack, to fowl up Hoppity's attempts to hook up with her. Hoppity finds out their human neighbors are a couple of successful songwriters, and their incoming payment from a recording company would allow them to have their yard repaired, making the bug community safe. Mr. Beetle gets wind of this and arranges for the check to the couple from coming in, thus causing the bugs to have to seek shelter in the newly created sky rise building. Hoppity hears that the couple is getting a place on top of the building, so all the bugs make their way up the building as its being built and eventually make it to the top just as the couple moves into the new penthouse with a lavish garden for the bugs to live in.

Mr. Bug Goes To Town is truly worth seeking out and adding to your collection. It is admittedly a little longer than it should be as the plot seems to string along near the end, but it really makes for a timeless all-ages classic. Since it's in the public domain you can find this under several releases, just maybe be a little picky about the look of the quality depending on what company is doing it.",1406073600,,2432,4.537585421412301

After finding a copy of Gulliver's travels which was done by the Fleisher studios, I decided to give this lesser known film a try. 'Bugville' originally named 'Hoppity Goes to Town' was released two days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, which took away any chance of it ever making an impact on the movie going audience.

The story is a simple one with classic Fleisher style animation about a group of insects looking to live in a safe place, with the hero wanting to marry his sweetheart and an evil beetle who wants her for himself. This release by Legends has done a very good job of presenting a clear and bright looking picture with good sound. Has it been restored?...probably not completely, but it looks very good, with minimal wear and I found it to look (way) more than adequate.

The extras include three unrelated shorts which don't look as good as the feature film, a brief(readable)bio on Fleischer studios and the original trailer for 'Hoppity goes to Town'.

3276534,5,B000ZIZX4K,"If you've seen ""Antz"" and ""A Bug's Life,"" this will look VERY familiar. This film is clearly the unacknowledged predecessor to these CGI tales.

""Hoppity Goes to Town/Mr. Bug Goes To Town/Bugville"" (I won't go into the tortued tale of the repeated retitling over the years, I'll just stick to HOPPITY), is somewhat of an underground cult classic. It was made in 1941 by the Max Fleischer studios and as is often noted, was released within a few days of Pearl Harbor, the film sank at the box office, and took the Fleischer studios with it. Interestingly, while the film was and is slammed by the critics, the general public loves it-especially those who loved it as children and passed it on through viewings with their offspring. Interestingly, I saw portions of this film at age 9 on television and found it somewhat strange-today, I love it as an adult! Funny enough for the kids and not too sappy for the grown folks.

Basically it is the tale of Hoppity, a Jimmy Stewartesque grasshopper who tries to save his community of insects from a crooked bug landlord and humans who disrupt the little bug town with their litter and walking (they are always in danger of being trampled by humans and for example, their town is destroyed by tossed lit cigar butts and water hoses). Hoppity leads them on a search for a paradise where they could live free from these perils, which is complicated by the crooked bug who literally profits from their misery (religiously inclined viewers might make a conncection between this and the story of Moses and the promised land). The story is rather charming, the characters are likeable, the plot flows well, and there is genuine suspense. Small and amusing asides also fill this film, espcially the jitterbug scene and Hoppity's dafffy-duck like dance while receiving an electric shock.

Adults with note the subtlety of the film's messages about the environment (in 1941, mind you), smoking, greed, hope, and loyalty to one's community. I recall reading somewhere that a reviewer described this film as an ""allegory of mankind."" In a way, it is as the story runs the gamut of human emotions and character types through the use of cartoon insects. Sort of a modern animated Aesop's fable if you will. Kids will like the comical antics of the villainous henchmen Swat the fly and Smack the mosquito among other things. Hoppity has a stick-to-it-iveness whose optimism is infectious in the face of potential disaster. Even in the film's dark moments when the crooked bugs seems to have the upper hand and his community turns against Hoppity, he still believes things will work out in the end. He's a pretty inspiring character for a 1941 cartoon!

The songs, while not particularly memorable, are not sappy (as was the case in the first Fleischer feature ""Gulliver's Travels"" two years earlier, which I found unwatchably bad as a child and have not bothered to see since).

HOPPITY is often negelected by film critics, but those who have seen this film throughout the generations love it (as evidenced by mine and the other reviews here and elsewhere on the web), and 1941's loss is our gain-this is truly one of the best cartoon features of all time. If you need a few good laughs along with some charm and inspiration-forget your psychologist and see this film!",1367107200,,3297,4.807760141093475

3276540,1,B000ZIZX4K,"Firstly let me state I have enjoyed this movie since childhood, ...and STILL do!
It's fun, bright and such a cheerful respite from the overly hyped Disney-saccharine brashness.
I'd give the original movie itself the full FIVE stars with absolutely NO hesitation.

HOWEVER, my copy is the very worst transfer I have yet encountered. It's obviously been re-titled with a very fake opening, complete with digitally applied scratches. The credits immediately following are very blurred and out of focus, and the quality doesn't get any better when you get into the film.

It's ""watchable"" I suppose, but only JUST, if you too enjoy the nostalgia of seeing something you know you already love. Anyone new to this would probably turn it off due to the very visible pictils and general low-def haziness, ...which is such a pity. On a large screen this will be glaringly apparent.
The sound is so softly recorded that you will need almost full volume: .....be sure to lower it before going back to live TV!
My copy also had a minor glitch, but resumed play almost immediately.

In all most disappointing as this movie has such a heartwarming theme, presented without the usual mental battering we have come to expect from later Disney efforts. There are songs but they are far better integrated and less of a sensory overload than the later animations, where any sense of subtlety has been totally over ridden by frantic movement and colour, ...not to mention a mind-bending manic speed which seems necessary these days.

Elsewhere in these reviews mention is made of another release of this film in a far better transfer. DO make sure you get that one.
With SO many flaws in the presentation, this version bugs the hell out of me!",1344297600,10,1723,4.830508474576271

3276542,4,B000ZIZX4K,"When reading reviews, keep in mind that Amazon mixes reviews from multiple versions of Bugville, so pay attention to the line at the beginning that states which version is being reviewed. This review is of the Legend version.

I'm not going to get into the movie itself since it's a classic movie with loads of historical information and reviews available. Instead, I'll concentrate on this print.

The DVD features the movie, a Max Fleischer ""biography"" that's really a couple of pages of text, and three short cartoons (Two For the Zoo, Ants in Plants and You Can't Shoe A Horsefly, the latter two also available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Max-Fleischer-s-Color-Classics-Somewhere-in-Dreamland/dp/B0000687E3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Max Fleischer's Color Classics: Somewhere in Dreamland</a>). There is also a copy of the original trailer, which gives you an idea of how the faded and washed out print compares to this restoration.

The main feature opens with a scratchy looking title, and then shrinks to part of a 4:3 frame to show the rest of the titles in what I would not describe as the best of presentations. I was ready to turn it off at that point, because it seemed to be exactly as another reviewer described what looked like a bootleg to him. I tried fast forwarding or seeking a specific position, but for some reason that didn't work. It turned out that after a couple of minutes, right after the title sequence ended, it returned to full frame and continued as a fairly good restoration. It was not pristine, but was free of scratches, was sharp, and the colors were clean and vivid. The sound was a bit scratchy, but not too bad considering the age of the film.

Aside from the problem navigating the disk, it gives you a good opportunity to see a classic with pioneering techniques that Disney could not duplicate. If you want more details about Max Fleischer's Rotoscope or Stereoptical Process, you can see the documentaries that are presented in the Popeye The Sailor volumes one and two (1933-1940). They give animated films lifelike movement of characters and a three dimensional feel that was not duplicated until computer animation came along. As for the overall quality of the restoration, I'd definitely say that they did a commendable job and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",1331683200,5,2360,5.186351706036746

3276544,1,B000ZIZX4K,"""Bugville"" is an extremely poor attempt to mimic the Disney animated features. The animation is not visually interesting, the story is thin and dull, the music is extraordinarily bland, and the DVD transfer is scratchy. This movie is nothing like Dave and Max Fleischer's Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons of the 1930's, or their Superman cartoons of the 1940's. The movie has none of the creative visual gags or humor of the Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons, nor does it have the stylish animation or exciting action of the Superman cartoons. The movie also lacks the beauty and storytelling of the Disney animated features. The DVD transfer is not too bad most of the time, but the film and the sound are scratchy at times, and the animation looks a little fuzzy.",1326844800,,760,4.765151515151516

The animation style is really good and the reviewers that gave this movie 1 star due to ""poor quality"" just need to get over it.  This movie is good quality!  I've never seen the original, but this copy of the film is certainly good enough to enjoy over and over.

3276547,4,B000ZIZX4K,"I have been a fan of animated shorts and feature length films for as long as I can remember. After finding a copy of Gulliver's travels which was done by the Fleisher studios, I decided to give this lesser known film a try. 'Bugville' originally named 'Hoppity Goes to Town' was released two days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, which took away any chance of it ever making an impact on the movie going audience.

The story is a simple one with classic Fleisher style animation about a group of insects looking to live in a safe place, with the hero wanting to marry his sweetheart and an evil beetle who wants her for himself. This release by Legends has done a very good job of presenting a clear and bright looking picture with good sound. Has it been restored?...probably not completely, but it looks very good, with minimal wear and I found it to look way more than adequate.

The extras include three unrelated shorts which don't look as good as the feature film, a brief(readable)bio on Fleischer studios and the original trailer for 'Hoppity goes to Town'.

Even had that not happened, however, I don't think this would be accounted a classic:  the filmmakers went for an atmosphere of kooky fun, but it's hard to get into since a mood of sinister treachery hangs unrelievedly over the events.

The thing I like about this movie is the character design, which I consider well-done.  Not quite the best I've ever seen for a village of insects, though.  That award would have to go a couple of the Walt Disney Silly Symphonies (specifically, ""Woodland Cafe"" and ""Bugs in Love,"" both of which can now be seen on YouTube).

Although the Fleischers' ""Gulliver Travels"" was comprehensively restored a few years ago, this movie hasn't been retouched at all, and it shows.  But I guess this DVD an improvement over what we had a few years ago:  nothing.

Notice that the bugs start out with four fingers, then go to three.  I think the animators either ran out of time or money.",1266364800,2,1075,4.670212765957447

What I liked best about this feature-length animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s. It's the songs, the clothing, automobiles, buildings lingo of the day, etc. You feel like you've stepped back into time.

From reading some of the reviews here, I see this was a hard-luck film, being released a couple of days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature-length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days, I'm sure. Too bad, because the folks missed some nice animation would have really impressed back then, almost 70 years ago. The colors are nice, drawings are good and story involving as we root for the bugs led by ""Hoppity"" and and his beautiful girl ""Honey"" to make it happily-ever-after and out of harm's way. It's also about all of them finding a grassy spot they can live and not worry about humans trampling them.

There is a nasty villain, though - ""C. Bagley Beetle"" - and two of his henchmen. Those helpers (""Swat, The Fly"" and ""Smack, the Mosquito"") are comedians, complete with their Brooklyn-ese accents! The story is a familiar one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand. The good guy, meanwhile, has the decked stacked against him but in the very end, of course, prevails.

My favorite part - this will sound worse than what it was - was when good-guy ""Hoppity"" got temporarily electrocuted and he danced in black-and-white. That was fantastic animation!

You know, it's a good thing I didn't see this as a very little kid; I would have been afraid to play outside and squash all those nice bug-people! You never know what (or who) is in that grass beneath your feet!",1236643200,4,1788,4.6455696202531644

The quality of this particular DVD is excellent. The picture is clear and the sound is very good, although still in mono.

For the uninitiated, the Fleischer brothers were an animation powerhouse that rivaled Disney at the time--producing cartoon greats like Popeye, Superman and Betty Boop--only to be undone by the extremely poor timing of this film's release (several days after Pearl Harbor).  Since the Fleischers were often distinguished from their competitors because of their use of human characters in their cartoons, as opposed to the industry standard anthropomorphic animal, I find it interesting that the film that forced them out of their own studio featured anthropomorphic animals.

History lesson aside, anyone who has seen Popeye would have an excellent feel for the style and quality of the animation in Bugville, which more or less conforms to the visuals of the Fleischers' more renowned cartoons.  Speaking directly to the quality of this particular DVD, it is certainly better than many of the other versions I've seen floating around the internet.  The picture is clear, as opposed to the blurriness that seemed to pervade the other copies I've seen.  The sound is likewise better, although still in mono.  Overall, if you're interested in acquiring a version of Mr. Bug/Hoppity, this Bugville release seems to be the best readily available.
