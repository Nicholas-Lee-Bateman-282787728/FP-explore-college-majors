8583397,5,B00CMFJW5K,"This movie was hilarious! It reminded me of the original Friday (with Chris Tucker and Ice Cube).  The plot was simple and straightforward (but with an interesting twist)! Two guys get a new job as wait-staff in a new restaurant. The restaurant ensemble is itself a great cast with great actors. And of course: Any movie that can be analogized to Friday has to have plenty of weed jokes!

All round, I'd highly recommend this movie.",1377734400,,432,4.671052631578948
8583398,5,B00CMFJW5K,"I laughed, I laughed, I laughed, and I laughed. Right from the beginning all the way to the end. I love that It just wasn't funny, but It has an awesome plot. JK Stone was great in his character as Mike, and the staring characters Libby Hook, Greig, and the lady waitress, smoking weed in the broom closet. looking for a laugh, and some seriousness in on funny movie, Newhighers.",1370563200,,379,4.428571428571429
