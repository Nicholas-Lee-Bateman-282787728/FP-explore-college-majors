7751686,5,B01FRMOXAS,"What an incredible documentary.  Really engaging. I have always been a fan of Ingrid Bergman. The amount of personal material and the idea that she created it and then moved it with her everywhere she lived is difficult to comprehend.  This documentary is worthy of Awards.  Beautifully presented.  The interviews with her children are very poignant.  She was an unusual person and a complete ""free spirit"".  She was also very talented.  I loved this film and I highly recommend it.  I hope you enjoy it too.",1471392000,17,508,4.825581395348837

7751688,5,B01FRMOXAS,"A wonderful documentary getting into the head of one of the great icons of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Much more flesh and blood than film goddess, Bergman was a modern woman who's choices anticipated 20th century feminism in both career and her personal life.",1475712000,,261,4.822222222222222

7751690,1,B01FRMOXAS,She is way more shallow than I had thought.  Will be selling the DVD in an upcoming garage sale as I'd not watch it more than once....,1475280000,2,134,3.962962962962963

7751696,2,B01FRMOXAS,"Ingrid Bergman is one of the most beautiful actresses of all time and led an undeniably intriguing life, but this documentary is a bit disjointed to say the least, and the music soundtrack becomes unbearably repetitive, clunky, and shrill within the first forty minutes...and then the picture continues for another small eternity afterwards.  Good luck making it through this.",1472342400,,376,5.372881355932203

8761376,5,B01FRMOXAS,Emotions and logic lose place. Fighting death with making art. Getting over yourself. Don't be Nice... Build something that is harsh and callous. Time that isn't wasted. Change yourself. Great the conflict with glee. Raise yourself up as much as possible.,1491091200,,255,5.2439024390243905

8761378,5,B01FRMOXAS,Ingrid Bergman never fails to fascinate.,1485475200,,40,5.833333333333333
8761379,5,B01FRMOXAS,"She was beautiful and talented.  Acting was her passion. She focused on acting and excelled. Lived in many countries, got married, got divorced, had children.  She adored her children and suffered much when custody decisions did not favored her.
Still, she continued acting.  Refused to be a victim.  Dealt bravely with the cancer that cut her life short.  An extraordinary life and an inspiration!",1485388800,,398,5.15625
8761380,5,B01FRMOXAS,"Like us, you'll be spellbound watching this beautifully made, well-narrated biopic featuring Ingrid Bergman's own home movies, her family's interviews, etc. Her lifelong luminescence really comes through, and her children -- often left behind due to her work, her affairs, divorces, moves around the world -- show such acceptance and understanding, despite having missed her for various long periods in their lives. What came through above all was the affection for, and among, everyone throughout the film. Her love of life, family, and truth permeated everything.",1484784000,2,565,5.5813953488372094
8761381,4,B01FRMOXAS,Watching home movies and photos shot by Ingrid herself with commentary by friends and family. Insightful and loving portrait.,1476748800,,125,5.631578947368421
8761382,2,B01FRMOXAS,Fell asleep several times. It was interesting but a bit colorless. Pia Lindstrome is her oldest daughter so it is well documented and I liked That her own words were used.  Just found a bit bland,1476403200,,195,4.416666666666667
