8239152,5,B0010XB1WC,This is a message that needs to be put out there. Everyone should watch. It's a shame that people have to rely on those who won't do the right thing.,1360368000,,149,4.0
8239153,5,B0010XB1WC,"This is a documentary about the genocide in Darfur, Sudan - in East Africa.  The whole situation was for me too complicated to really understand at first.  I have been on google reading a lot since my study of this situation began about a month ago.  I am beginning to get a grasp on it.  There is a lot of good information in this video - I have probably watched it a dozen times - and keep picking up on more nuances about what the things it says really mean - as I learn more.  Also - of course - it is a video - so there are a lot of good graphics in it - and that is an important part of it all - is to see what this area actually looks like - and how these people are living.  It is amazing.  I am promoting an informational presentation at my church this coming week - to share what I have learned with others.  I would encourage EVERYONE to ge this movie, (although it is amybe 7 years old now - and some things have changed since then) - and look into this issue.  It will make you a better person.  There are still probably 3 millon people stranded in refugee camps from this genocide.  It is a real shame.  And - Sudan has a lot of other problems - the government there remains ENTIRELY unsmypathetic to the Africans- and when the Africans rebel - the government reacts by bombing civilian centers still now - like they did in Darfur.  (Don't get me started).  Every American needs to contact their elected representatives - and encourage them to stay engaged in this issue - we have to continue putting pressure on the government of Sudan to take care of it's citizens.  There are still HUGE human rights issues in Sudan.",1331424000,4,1633,4.205787781350482
8239154,5,B0010XB1WC,This is a great portrayal of the plight in Africa - specifically in Sudan. Great film for anyone who does not know about genocide or for those who already know and would like a different view.,1235865600,14,192,4.361111111111111
8239155,5,B0010XB1WC,"This is a good first study of Darfur for those who've read about it but haven't really understood it very well.  Nicholas Kristof, NY Times reporter who was one of the first to break the story, is interviewed extensively and well.  A Harvard prof. whose name escapes me is also a credible, articulate source of historical and current information.  Footage of Darfur refugees and their stories is indeed haunting, as is interview footage with Elie Wiesel.  Includes a somewhat inspiring call to action -- and coverage of Barack Obama's and Sam Brownback's responses.  George Clooney narrates (and executive produced).  Definitely worth seeing.",1209254400,19,642,5.245098039215686
8239156,5,B0010XB1WC,I watched this last night on HBO.  Very well done but one of the most haunting documentaries I've ever watched.,1197244800,11,111,4.55
