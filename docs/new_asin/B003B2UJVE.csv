4104902,5,B003B2UJVE,I watched this on iTunes with my girlfriend and it is such a touching film. Bob Hoskin's and Stockard Channing as usual are fantastic. Highly recommend this movie.,1272585600,5,163,4.857142857142857
4104903,3,B003B2UJVE,"This is a mixed quality film. At times it does sparkle other times it's so forced it's hard to accept the reality as presented.  The plot twists and intertangled  relationships are fun at first then quickly dive into the unbelievable. Given the long difficult relationships as presented I find it very difficult to believe any,  let alone all, would so readily  move past unintentional and intentional indiscretions. Bob Hoskins was lovely. The lead male actor, Shaun Evans, shows great promise which led me to watch the Endeavor series. Quite excellent in caring on the mantle  of Inspector Morse.
Solid veteran cast; is a gross understatement. It's just hard to believe the  characters are that easy going after so much history.",1485129600,2,730,5.041666666666667
4104904,1,B003B2UJVE,bored was looking for comedy,1484179200,,28,4.8
4104905,4,B003B2UJVE,Liked this quirky movie - Fun to watch Shaun Evans in an early role - Good acting all around.,1467072000,2,93,3.9473684210526314
4104906,1,B003B2UJVE,"Are the positive reviews a joke?
Or, are the positive reviews ALL from the writers, actors, producers of the film?
Or, are the positive reviews from the FRIENDS of the writers, actors, producers?
I tried to make it through 15 minutes of this film. Torture.",1433635200,,256,4.711111111111111
4104907,1,B003B2UJVE,"Vacuous/ without a plot!  I paid WAY too much, AND it apparently was in high definition because streaming could not be in a higher speed. Also  I could not understand the actors (with no subtitles to help, it was quickly a zero chance of success). Sorry. What was this movie about?  I guess I felt the talents of Shawn Evans would have been enough. Wow. Sorry he was in this.",1427932800,,375,4.328571428571428
4104908,3,B003B2UJVE,Medioce Brit comedy and I really love them but this one is just blah.,1426636800,,69,4.0
4104909,4,B003B2UJVE,Very nice!,1419292800,,10,4.5
4104910,3,B003B2UJVE,Not bad for a .99 cent rental! The relationship of the young man & his mom was painful & funny at the same time if that makes since. If looking for something to pass the time during a airplane trip this should do it!,1410566400,,216,3.9318181818181817
4104911,3,B003B2UJVE,Just okay.  Probably due more to my taste in movies than the movie itself.,1410048000,,74,4.285714285714286
4104912,4,B003B2UJVE,"Give this movie a try! I found it  delightful, slightly quirky, and just plain enjoyable. As I become more ""seasoned""  in my movie-viewing, I pay attention to the more technical aspects, scenery, production, etc. but this is a movie that you just sit back and enjoy unencumbered. As other reviewers have said, Hoskins and Channing were great. I love Endeavor so i have been looking for other Shaun Evans work and he did not disappoint. I would definitely recommend.",1406937600,4,465,4.8734177215189876
4104913,4,B003B2UJVE,"I knew nothing of this film. It's so quirky and it took me awhile to realize I was indeed watching Stockard Channing whim I adore ( she might have had her look cosmetically altered?) but she was as great as ever and the crazy twists made this an amusing film.
I would recommend it for sure",1399248000,,289,4.178571428571429
4104914,5,B003B2UJVE,"Happy ending with fun means a great viewing experience. Add Bob Hoskins, sprinkle with the adorable Amanda Ryan and Shaun Evans and stir in Belinda Montgomery and Stockard Channing and it's the perfect recipe for a feel good movie.",1396310400,5,231,4.948717948717949
4104915,5,B003B2UJVE,"I liked the son's Liverpool accent.  Characters are  related to one another. Sweet movie. The mother and son relocate from Liverpool, England to a friend's apartment in London. Wish there had been more Liverpool scenes.",1393977600,2,219,5.228571428571429
4104916,4,B003B2UJVE,"Happened upon the film watching Netflix and found it funny but also very touching.  The actors do sparkle, take the time to check out the film.",1369785600,,143,4.5
4104917,4,B003B2UJVE,"DVD was received right on time and in perfect order!  Great movie no scratches at all, and played in the DVD player without any glitches.  Love it!",1327276800,,147,4.407407407407407
4104918,2,B003B2UJVE,"Excited to watch this movie, thinking I'd found a diamond in the rough, I sat down with my girlfriend to watch.  Within five minutes we were giving each other the 'Are you sure you want to watch this?' looks.

We're patient people, and decided to give it another 20 minutes.  But it stinks.

Maybe, maybe, somewhere in there these characters develop compelling personas, or the production values suddenly take a turn from the only-slightly-better-than-high-school-amateur feeling, or the random cuts between scenes make sense... but we decided not to wait around to find out.",1324944000,4,575,5.150537634408602
4104919,5,B003B2UJVE,"Lesley Manville's rendition of the Korgis' ""Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime"" is superb.  (This was also covered by Beck in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"").",1294099200,4,166,5.384615384615385
4104920,5,B003B2UJVE,Sparkle proves that Hoskins is a verstile actor as he adds another surprising role to his repitiore.  Definitely recommend!,1280275200,2,123,5.473684210526316
4104921,5,B003B2UJVE,"I found Sparkle charming, funny and quite enjoyable. I watch a lot of romantic comedies, but this film really stood out for me! It's extremely well written and the actors really bring their characters to life- I love their accents and British sense of humor. This film is fantastic, definitely worth seeing!!!",1280275200,6,309,4.961538461538462
4104922,5,B003B2UJVE,"The amazingly wonderful Stockard Channing adapts a perfect British accent in this delightful movie, channeling the persona of Anne Bancroft in The Graduate.  It brings back both the simple delights and then the erratic complications of new & old love.  The Hollywood veteran cast members bring the comedy & are supported by playful newcomers who help renew the fresh & innocent sense of falling in love.  I saw Sparkle at the Edinburgh Film Fest and I look forward to the US release because it's the perfect rom-com to watch over and over- it's refreshing even once you discover all of  the surprises...",1280275200,8,603,4.882352941176471
8393331,5,B003B2UJVE,wholly  entertaining. Well acted and directed.,1518652800,,46,6.666666666666667

It was funny and sad and really nicely done.",1508198400,,64,4.0
8393334,3,B003B2UJVE,"I liked the cast and the acting.  Fun, quirky film.",1503532800,,51,4.1
8393335,5,B003B2UJVE,Loved this movie.  I am a fan of Shaun Evans from watching Endeavor and seeing him playing this role was just lovely. Great cast,1501027200,,128,4.333333333333333
8393336,4,B003B2UJVE,"Charming, moves along with some fun and unexpected surprises connecting the dots in relationships. Great cast. I really enjoyed it.",1495756800,,131,5.6
8393337,3,B003B2UJVE,"I enjoyed the movie....did not agree how everyone blamed Sam-the son, for the lies and confusion, calling him an idiot, slapping him and saying he doesn't deserve-her.....it was Kate fault......",1491091200,,194,5.5
8393338,5,B003B2UJVE,"Sparkle with Stockard Channing is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Lesley Manville and the entire cast were terrific.  It certainly is a feel good movie.  The music was beautiful as well with Lesley Manville.

If you need a pick me up, this is the movie to see.",1491004800,3,270,4.235294117647059
8393339,1,B003B2UJVE,Slow and language not witty as I thought just crude - couldn't get past first 5-10 mins.,1490745600,,88,4.235294117647059
8393340,5,B003B2UJVE,"A fun movie. All the actors did a great job. Stockard Channing, Bob Hoskins, Shaun Evans and Amanda Ryan are a pleasure. Lesley Manvile as the mother to the character Sam is a hoot. If you enjoy Shaun Evans (Sam) in this role, check out the Endeavour series on Amazon Prime. Definitely worth a watch.",1489190400,2,300,4.472727272727273
