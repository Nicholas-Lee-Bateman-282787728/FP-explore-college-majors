2041488,5,B0001WTV98,"This is a very good story about a big foot which befriends a young boy, bad guys come and try to capture it. good guys climb a cliff to reach bigfoot, a female ranger also climbing makes it to the top and slides down, crying for help. all of a sudden a huge hand reaches down grabs her arm lifts her up with one hand, than lifts her up under her armpits and places her firmly on the ground. I would strongly recommend this.",1410134400,,423,4.0476190476190474
2041489,4,B0001WTV98,I liked this movie it was very cute. It was no Harry and the Hendersons but a cute story. My kind of bigfoot. I really don't like the bloody no plot movies. This had a plot though it was for children but I'm a kid at heart. I'd recommend it for a family movie..,1402272000,,261,3.8518518518518516

2041493,5,B0001WTV98,"To all concerned:

This DVD was not only a joy to watch because of the high quality of the disc and its reproduction, but was completely glich free. I was so happy about that. The story of course is why I purchased the DVD, and because I thoroughly love the talents of Crystal Chappell. If anyone is a fan of Crystal Chappell this is a must see, as she gives a stellar performance as the good Professor Samantha. Additionally, Amazon was just an absolute joy to order from as they provide complete details of your order and expected due dates of your item(s)arrival all by email to your inbox. Plus Amazon gives updates as to the progress of your order and in plain understandable English by email straight to your inbox as well. My experience was a very very very good one and I highly recommend using Amazon for any and all of your online purchases.

Very best regards,
Kokumo, Burbank, California",1280620800,3,899,4.54320987654321
2041494,3,B0001WTV98,"This is not a bad movie at all. It's a sugar coated little family movie that is suitable for all ages.

I do wish that a serious bigfoot movie would come out some day but in the mean time this little venture into the Sasquatch mythos is enough to keep the youngsters interested for 90 minutes.

Not quite as good as ""Harry and the Hendersons"" but it is a good effort and it entertains.

For the Bigfoot genre completist this is one to score, although this is no ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" or ""Creature from Black Lake"" it is a noteable notch in ""Cinema Du Sasquatch"" and worthy of a space on the shelf, perhaps next to ""Snowbeast"".

For the average consumer, it's probably better to rent it.",1097884800,4,688,4.3515625
2041495,4,B0001WTV98,"If you don't own this, you're in the wrong.

My only complaint is that they shouldn't have had Bigfoot mumble ""Cody"" (the name of the boy who helps save him) at the end. This took away from the realism.

It's not blockbuster production quality, like Little Bigfoot 2, but still well worth the time and money!",1091750400,5,308,4.482142857142857

8017589,4,B0001WTV98,"This is a completely wonderful family film with bigfoot.  It has all the elements of human evil doers, pretty heroine scientist crusading for right, careless hunters and a likable boy and his bigfoot friend.  This film boasts two get um two Howards.  Father Howard as a older cowboy trucker, and youngest Howard of Gentle Ben fame as a nervous corrupt city official.  The boy is played by likable oldest son from Home Improvement fame.  The scientist is a rare film appearance of beautiful and talented Crystal Chappell of Days of Our Lives and Guiding Light fame.  Now  producer/director/actor of several successful Web series like the popular Venice. One of the biggest delights is the spectacular nature and mountain location scenes in this beautifully shot film. This is a gosh G film with plenty of daring do and yes bigfoot.  Check it out on family movie night.",1429315200,,867,4.890410958904109
