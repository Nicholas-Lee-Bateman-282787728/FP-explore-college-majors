1407226,2,B000059MQQ,"This film details the tribulations of a lower class white family from Southern Illinois.  While the story may have a mild ""camp"" appeal, it seems forced and without any of the real virtue of camp films such ""Flesh Gordon,"" ""Barbarella,"" or ""Uptown Saturday Night.""  It does not even measure up to the best of campTV like Showtime's ""Sherman Oaks"" because of poor acting, even in roles that present very little challenge, from everyone in the film except William Devane and the widely advertised but not-so-prominently featured Jamie Pressly.  This film does have a few solid one-liners that will put a smile on your face and watching it will not feel like a complete waste of time, which puts it in at least the 50% of films, but do not place it too high on your list.  ...",1000080000,3,773,4.62043795620438
1407227,5,B000059MQQ,"I wasn't expecting much from this film, after it's limited theatrical run.  So, when I sat down to watch it at home, I wasn't too excited.  Probably the only reason I bought it was because I'm a huge Jason London fan.  But, I had some friends over and we sat down to watch the movie.
We laughed from beginning to end!  The characters were so funny, and so real, it has us rolling.  The writing from Michael Addis and Tony Urban was awesome.  The actors were all at the top of their game, especially London and William Devane.  The one who stole the show was Jacob Tierney.  The only actor who I thought did a poor job was Tim Kazurinsky.  He was really poor, but his 2 scenes were very short, so it didn't harm the film.
Don't expect this to be an Oscar winner.  Just take it for what it is, a very campy romp through the trailer parks of the midwest.
Great fun!",992822400,6,862,4.16969696969697
1407228,5,B000059MQQ,"This film was hilarious!  For a low budget movie, I was surprised how well paces, and fun it was to watch.  The acting was particularly good.  Sean Young was a trailer park mom.  That's something I haven't seen before.  William Devane and Jason London almost stole the movie.  A lot of quotable dialogue.  Well written!  And very well directed!!",991008000,12,345,4.728813559322034
1407229,2,B000059MQQ,"The lithany of bad jokes, fowl and obscene humor from ""Grandpa"", and constant bizarre but stupid twists make this a hard pill to swallow.  Towards the end of the movie, there's even a poorly-edited giant shoot-out involving seemingly every member of the cast, which really has no place in the film at all.  And really, the end was the worst part of the film.  Really painful.
I kept on waiting for something to happen, but I should have trusted my instincts and turned the thing off.  The humor was really more appropriate for the teens crowd (watch out for a painfully long and drawn-out scene in which one of the boys makes out with his favorite blow-up doll), but the amount of language (i.e., constant references to being molested in prison) and graphic violence make it inappropriate for young people.  I think this movie probably looked a lot better on paper.
The script was clever in parts.  Perhaps with a better cast, a better director, and a stern copy-editor, Poor White Trash could have been something.  However, I can't even think up a decent drinking game to accompany this terrible movie.  I gave it two stars for the two times I laughed during the film.",986774400,5,1169,4.668292682926829

1407281,4,B000059MQQ,"I thought this movie is was very funny and I really expect it to rank up there with other cult classic films such as ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Joe Dirt.""

You have to view this movie with an understanding that it is not Shakespeare or some social drama. There's no false advertising here. It is a movie about poor white trash. The selection of actors could not be more fitting. William Devane was excellent as Ron Lake, a man who fancies himself as up-scale white trash, obviously from his choice of dwelling, the classic Airstream Travel Trailer; the true choice of trailer connoisseurs. Sean Young is pure poor white trash, playing the mother who wants her son to go on to things better than the trailer park, and is willing to go the extra mile, including committing armed robbery with him to ensure his success. Also, amongst this group, is the extremely attractive Jaime Pressly playing Sandy Lake. When I think of actresses who can play white trash there are three names that come to mind as the VERY BEST: Holly Hunter, Juliette Lewis, and Jamie Pressly. Ms. Pressly is one amongst talented company. Supporting these actors is M. Emmet Walsh, a superbly talented actor, whom I feel is often underrated.

UPDATE: This review is not for ""Poor White Trash (aka Bayou) [VHS] (1957).""  That's a totally different movie.  However, due to Amazon's poor attempts at ""out sourcing"" it has been linked to ""Poor White Trash (aka Bayou) [VHS] (1957).""",1355875200,,1443,4.783132530120482

1407283,2,B000059MQQ,"The film takes place in Southern Illinois, but everyone has a southern accent. Mike Bronco, at times is the voice of reason in this film, but he gets talked into doing stupid stuff. The characters are poor caricatures and the dialogue is poorly cliche and predictable. And when it is not predictable, it is bad. My expectations where low, and unfortunately this film exceeded them. Perhaps in 2001 when this film came out it was worth seeing, but in 2012, the indie comedy has been perfected enough to push this film to the bottom of the must view heap. So watch ""Chumscrubber"" instead and you'll thank me. More stupid than funny.

1407285,2,B000059MQQ,"I made it exactly 30 minutes, then bailed.
I thought Jaime Pressly('My Name Is Earl'), Jason London('Mallrats'), what the heck, why not? Pressly is on the cover of the DVD, but is actually the next-to-the-last person billed, & London is 3 spots above her.
What a waste. I hope my library didn't pay for this.

1407286,5,B000059MQQ,"OK show, bought it because my kids wanted to see it since we live in the town where a portion of the movie was filmed.",1264982400,,118,3.76
1407287,4,B000059MQQ,"I'd give the movie 3 stars on it's own, but due to the refreshing criticism by both Sean Young and the writer/director on the single commentary track, I'm adding an extra star to the overall grade.

This movie suffers from absolutely awful cinematography (Dir. of Photog.'s first film). Although, because this is a movie about poor white trash, it is almost fitting. Regardless, I still enjoyed the movie right from the very beginning.

However, to help get you into the right mood to watch this movie, I would suggest that you listen to a bit of the Sean Young and writer/director's commentary track, before you begin watching, so that you can hear how relaxed and frank the two of them are. They are having fun eating and drinking while they do the commentary (eventually, you hear bottles being opened, etc.). In less than a minute you should be relaxed, so just jump back to the beginning of the movie and watch it without the commentary (the first time).

In the commentary track, both the director and Sean Young quite often comment on the bad lighting and low budget they had to put up with, and I was shocked to hear Sean Young talk about how Jason London didn't get along with her, and how he basically berated her on the set. She also criticized the cinematographer (his first film) and the director, in a friendly, yet, educational way. I found it to be both entertaining and informative.

One great side effect about having a low budget, is that you often have just one take to do most of the scenes. This allows for the inclusion of many scenes that include actor errors or mishaps that would normally be edited out or reshot. One such great scene occurs when Jaime Pressly is trashing a hospital room. Shortly after she kicks a small television across the room, she loses her balance after bumping into a table, slips, and then takes a hard fall. Without missing a beat, she gets up immediately and continues on with the scene. Both Sean and the director get a nice laugh out of it, on the commentary track.

I also believe that if this Dvd was handed out for free, to 100 random people in a major city, 80 of them would probably stop watching it after 20 minutes or less. Ten of them would just fast forward scan to see all of Jaimie Pressly's scenes, and the final ten people would enjoy it as much as the majority of the Amazon reviewers here seem to.

I think the low budget look to the movie would turn most people off. It also takes awhile until the entertaining William Devane or Jaime Pressly appear (no, Jaime is never naked-a bikini is as close as she gets). Also, surprisingly, there's no nudity at all in the film- just one very partial side breast of a girl is quickly shown, but nothing else I remember.

So, even though there's probably a 60%-80% chance you won't want to watch the whole movie, or even bother listening to the commentary track, I would still suggest that you at least rent it, to see if it becomes one of your guilty pleasures. It's certainly one of mine.

Like one of the menu choices on the Dvd states...""Play the Damn Movie"".

See ya at the trailer park!",1185148800,9,3103,4.497335701598579

1407299,4,B000059MQQ,"Once upon a time in a trailer park to close to say lived two boys who are bored and decide to score some 'Near Beer"" from the local quickie mart.  This turns bad and the two are arrested.  They meet the grandfather attorney who gets them off.. for a price.  A chain reaction of hillarity insues.  Sean Young is effective as the white trash mother who will do anything to make sure her son gets into college, and doesn't have to live in a trailer the rest of his life.  Not as stupid as it appears to be.  The screenplay is smart, even with such lines as ""You're hot as doughnut grease, babe.""  That line is a gem.  Bound to be a redneck classic, Jeff Foxworthy would be proud.  The only thing missing was Jerry Springer.",1100995200,4,720,4.235294117647059
1407300,3,B000059MQQ,"Welcome to Sunrise, Illinois, a town that plays host to a significant contingent of lower class, trailer dwelling, criminally prone hillbilly types loving referred to as ""Poor White Trash."" Starring such recognizable names as William Devane, Sean Young, and Jaime Pressly, the film focuses on the antics of the Bronco and Lake families, with several other individuals floating around on the periphery. Linda Bronco, played quite well by Sean Young, only has one wish in her miserable existence of one night stands and fly by night jobs: she wants her son Michael to go to college at the University of Southern Illinois to major in psychology. After yet another fight with her washed out professional wrestler husband, Linda must step in and take control of Michael's life if her dream is to be realized. Regrettably for Linda, Michael and his friend Lenny Lake find themselves in a heap of trouble after swiping a six-pack of near beer at the local convenience store. This thoughtless action throws Michael's plans for school into turmoil, thereby requiring Linda to lead her son and his friend on a robbing spree for tuition money and enough scratch to hire a decent lawyer to fight the robbery charge. Along for the ride is Brian, the son of the local sheriff who Linda picked up in a bar and who now wishes to take part in the antics.
To disentangle her son from the robbery charge, Linda and her son turn to Lenny Lake's grandfather, Ron Lake. The elder Lake is a strange character, a one-time felon who now works as a big shot lawyer. Ron just married the gorgeous but dangerous Sandy, and the two live in Ron's trailer adorned with a garden of sculptures made out of beer cans. Ron is as crooked as they come, though, and to get his help Linda and her trio of would be criminals must agree to split their take with Ron and his wife. Everything goes down the drain from this point, as the four rob a retirement home and a local eating establishment. They get the money, but they get double crossed too, an incident which leads to hilarious trailer trash retribution involving trailer stealing, fireworks, automatic weapons, and duct tape.
There are more problems with ""Poor White Trash"" than there are pluses. The organization of the film is a disaster, with scenes that run too long, sloppy camera work, and a script often bogged down with too much detritus. What this movie desperately needed was an excellent editor, someone to go through the scenes and cut out all the awkward dead weight. About half way into the movie, I started to suspect that somebody, maybe a studio, mucked around with the finished product and left us with a movie that is more often a hodgepodge of scenes than a seamless film. Another big minus here, at least for me, was the relegation of Danielle Harris to a minor role as Suzi (the one with an ""i""), an employee at the local restaurant robbed by Bronco and company. Harris, who in my opinion could never appear in enough films, gets marginal screen time. At least we get one good shot of her smiling face, and I guess that is better than nothing.
Despite these problems, ""Poor White Trash"" works on many levels, and works spectacularly. I would be completely insane if I did not mention the stellar performance of William Devane as Ron Lake. I have never liked Devane as an actor, probably due to his appearance in too many of those unctuous ""movie of the week"" productions. But here he shines like the sun. Devane has all of the best lines of the film, none of which are reproducible here because they usually deal with romantic entanglements in prison. His outfits are hilarious, his law office, located in a mall, bears the name ""Land o' Law,"" and his philosophy about beautiful women is a scream. Devane chews the scenery in this film and it is a better movie because of it. Devane's role along with numerous effective sight gags, helps propel ""Poor White Trash"" to easily watchable levels.
The DVD throws in a commentary by Sean Young and director Michael Addis, as well as some production stills, three trailers for three obscure films I never heard of, and cast and crew profiles. Add in these extras with the actual film, and you have yourself an effective way to burn a few hours. ""Poor White Trash"" will never win any awards, but it ultimately delivers with good performances and some good gags.",1056931200,4,4342,4.677124183006536
1407301,4,B000059MQQ,"I saw this movie at 3am so perhaps my review is a little bias but I thought this was a ""clever"" film. It was interesting to see Sean Young acting again and her performance was pretty good. This film at times was just plain wierd in the same vein as Pecker but this film's plot wasn't so convoluted as Pecker's. This film is more a novelty piece in your DVD collection.",1049587200,,368,4.197183098591549
1407302,4,B000059MQQ,"This is a highly amusing comedy with heart. It's a shame that lots of people won't see it because it lacks notority - but I urge you to take the ""risk"" and give this a watch. It's definitely worth two hours of your life!",1021593600,3,220,4.0227272727272725
1407303,3,B000059MQQ,"Now what?  This provaking title with the cast like this?  Anyone who remembers Sean Young in Ridley Scott masterpiece ""Bladerunner"" might bitterly think about her career decline since ""No Way Out.""  And Jamie Pressly played the same kind of role as the one she did in ""Ringmaster"" starring ... Jerry Springer.
However, in spite of (or because of) this low expectation, ""Poor White Trash"" turns out a fairly good comedy following astory of a boy and his mother (Sean Young) plus his airhead buddy, all of whom get involved in a train of stupid situations.  It starts from a minor crime of shoplifting a pack of beer, but their sheer stupidity of handling the case leads them into the spiral staircase of other crimes such as hitting a local berger shop (while ordering bergers at the same time) and an attempted murder (with a gun in a frying pan).
The characters are all typical ones that you might imagine from the film's title, but the movie wisely avoids the mistake of laughing 'at' them.  Instead, it gives a set of likable characters with a bit crazy streaks.  Not so many laughs would be there, and some of the obvious attempts to get them fail, but its well-written story keeps on going with a good pace.  The standout is Jamie Pressly's too sexy ""grandmother,"" and Sean Young's mother Mrs. B, who preaches her son to have a strict moral sense while discussing a plan of burglary!
Obviously made with low-budget, and it sometimes suffers from the fact, but the result is better than you expect from the title and the cast.  Worth a try.",1018224000,,1544,4.6300366300366305
