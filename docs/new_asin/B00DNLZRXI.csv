5836398,2,B00DNLZRXI,"I only liked a couple of these movies.  One was more for kids, and another one continuously used language that I didn't care for.",1389312000,,129,4.375
5836399,5,B00DNLZRXI,I loved the collection. Fun to watch on a lazy day. Good stories and to have them on just two discs makes for easy storage.,1389139200,8,123,3.96
5836400,5,B00DNLZRXI,"Holiday in Handcuffs is one of my favorite Christmas movies to watch and my son likes Snowglobe so it is great to have in one place.  Hadn't seen a couple of the others and got to watch, which I did like them also.  I would recommend it.",1389052800,,237,4.0212765957446805
5836401,5,B00DNLZRXI,I honestly ordered this pack just for Holiday in Handcuffs.  This is one of my top Christmas movies I have to watch each year.  I love how there is just enough comedy and seriousness in dealing with family issues+relationships.  This pack offers some nice lift your spirits and hope movies.,1388188800,,290,4.76
5836402,5,B00DNLZRXI,"This is a wonderful collection of holiday movies. I highly recommend it  They are full of humor, romance and Christmas spirit.",1387584000,,126,5.0
5836403,5,B00DNLZRXI,"Any Christmas movies is worth owning.  This set has 6 really great Christmas movies.  I like the protective ""can-like"" packaging.  It's a terrific gift for any age.  The only thing I don't like about owning your own Christmas DVDs is that very few have closed captioning.  Sometimes it's difficult for me to make out all of the words.  I even have an hearing aid and I still have difficulty sometimes.",1386979200,14,401,4.6571428571428575

5836435,1,B00DNLZRXI,I purchased this DVD in August.  I didn't get around to watching it until the first week in November when the Christmas season was starting up.  One of the DVDs is scratched and I am unable to play it.  I am not able to exchange it since it is past the Amazon time limit for exchanges.,1447113600,,285,4.053571428571429

5836442,2,B00DNLZRXI,"I was so excited to get this as stocking stuffers for several people, as well as a copy for myself, since I had already seen a few of the movies on there and knew they were really good.  But luckily, before Christmas I decided to watch my copy and I was so surprised that I could only watch it in standard format, which made it look stretched and weird on my tv.  I tried many things to get the picture right, but it looked just as bad no matter what I did.  I sent the unused copies back and decided not to give them as gifts.  I would just order the movies individually, since they seem to have a better format for watching on a new, large screen tv.  (Holiday in Handcuffs and Christmas in Boston - are the best on the set anyway)",1426723200,3,733,4.0625

In this day and age, especially for ABC Family movies and all age groups they play to, but I don't understand why they aren't, but found out the hard way when I purchased it them. I'm really disappointed.",1415145600,3,318,4.5
