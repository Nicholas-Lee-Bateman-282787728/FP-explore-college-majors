6564837,3,B00M8KBGNU,ok,1408924800,,2,2.0
6564838,3,B00M8KBGNU,"I was disappointed to find that the DVD only contained 7 episodes.  I should have read it better as the title was misleading in that I thought I was getting all of Season 1, not just ""Disc 1"" of Season 1.  Too bad as I had a huge bowl of popcorn all ready for watching it all evening.  I must say, however, that the quality of the video is extremely good.  The color is vivid and the picture crisp and bright; the audio is clear and without hiss.  It makes me wonder if this is a test run to see if it generates enough interest to market the entire series, something which I've hoped would happen for the past several years.  I'll keep my fingers crossed as many on here have been doing that the entire series becomes available.  If they do and they're the quality of this dvd, I'll be one happy guy.",1408492800,45,800,4.1558441558441555
6564839,2,B00M8KBGNU,There are only 7 episodes on this disc.  You can generally get a WHOLE season of classic shows for less than this cost.,1408320000,2,119,4.173913043478261
6564840,5,B00M8KBGNU,"This is a classic well worth the money,this DVD is of the best quality i have seen from a movie of that age in a long time,this classic of season 1 is timeless and very well put together. My advice to anyone who is a fan of this show and other classics from that era is to purchase this DVD,you will not be disappointed!",1407196800,9,320,4.015625
6564841,4,B00M8KBGNU,"I remember seeing this during first and second run back in the 60's-in black and white as we didn't have a color tv. Mainly I remember having a crush on Hope Lange (and my other was Doris Day) -boy, if that doesn't make you feel old, what will?

I was pleased to see this finally available at last, even though it's odd-you have to buy each disc on its own. The packaging is sparse and looks a little ""bootleggy"", but I believe this is a legitimate release. There is no information on the dvd case to say anything about remastering or the source material. I can say that every episode on disc one was pristine and flawless. Really superb quality transfer, clean, crisp and beautiful. I did hear a couple of audio volume changes but they were minimal. If you remember this series and want to own it this looks like the only legitimate source. The only reason for 1 star off 5 is the pricing and packaging, content is perfect.",1453161600,9,924,4.4035087719298245
6564842,5,B00M8KBGNU,"I was so pleased this this was on dvd.  I loved the show when it was on tv, thus I ordered it.  It brings back so many great memories of my family seating and watching it together.  Thank you for the memories.",1452902400,,209,3.9285714285714284
6564843,4,B00M8KBGNU,"I love this show ,it brings back childhood memories. The only problem(besides the outrageous price)is that the words don't match the peoples mouths in certain areas.",1451088000,,165,5.384615384615385
6564844,4,B00M8KBGNU,"I love this show and have waited YEARS for a clear copy of the series with quality image and sound. This DVD has the sound and image quality, it looks better than it did via ""rabbit ears"" when I was 8 years old! Everyone should buy this series, even if it is one DVD at a time.

But....WHERE ARE THE EIGHT MISSING EPISODES?! AMAZON, OR WHO EVER DECIDES THESE THINGS....MAKE THOSE 8 MISSING EPISIDES AVALABLE AND LETS FINALLY HAVE A COMPLETE SET OF THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR!!!

WHY LEAVE OUT 8 EPISODES, WTF?Im sorry I meant to say,BLAST, BLAST BLAST where are the missing episodes?

Four stars...you will get Five when you provide the missing episodes. Thanks for a great product just not complete.",1450742400,,697,4.56
6564845,5,B00M8KBGNU,I waited a long time to get these DVD and I am glad to have them and view once again the story of Mrs. Muir.,1448236800,,108,3.36
6564846,5,B00M8KBGNU,Yes.  It was picture perfect and the DVD was just what I needed.  It was a good show and sometimes you need a good show to help you through some problems.  No all the shows have to be a deep drama.,1446249600,,197,3.7560975609756095
6564847,5,B00M8KBGNU,Love it. Brings back memories.,1441411200,,30,5.2

6564849,5,B00M8KBGNU,"First of all, let me say I love this Show!!!!  I actually had the opportunity to purchase this show from a seller on Ebay.  The quality was poor and cost was a little better.  You get what you pay for.  I then saw these being offered on Amazon.  I was excited and very pleased with the quality.  So much better than what I originally purchased on Ebay.  I think the price is fair for the quality you are getting on these.  Did I say I love this Show!!! :)",1438041600,4,455,4.033707865168539
6564850,5,B00M8KBGNU,"The Ghost & Mrs Muir is my favorite movie and I worried that the tv show wouldn't live up to it since I hadn't seen it since I was about 5.  I love it.  The captain is wonderful and Mrs Muir engaging and delightful.  Clean, sweet, and romantic -- I'll watch this again and again.",1437436800,,279,4.036363636363636
6564851,5,B00M8KBGNU,"I was wonderful to see this great classic again! I haven't seen this show since I fell in love with Captain
Greg when I was a little girl! I cant wait to watch the next disc!",1436918400,,174,3.861111111111111
6564852,1,B00M8KBGNU,DVD -R are copies not from the studio. And then to charge  outrageous amount of money. Is ridiculous.,1433030400,5,101,4.611111111111111
6564853,5,B00M8KBGNU,Always loved The Ghost and Mrs. Muir when I was a kid.  Still enjoy it!,1429833600,,71,3.7333333333333334
6564854,5,B00M8KBGNU,I am glad to see they are putting out the older tv shows on DVD .  I don't have to worry about the content should the grand kids show up while I am watching.,1427328000,,157,3.6176470588235294
6564855,5,B00M8KBGNU,I waited a long time for these to be available in American format! I just wish they were captioned for my deaf husband.,1425945600,4,119,4.217391304347826
6564856,5,B00M8KBGNU,"Having purchased (and just received) each of the MOD discs in this series, I can say that it's truly delightful to enjoy 'The Ghost and Mrs Muir' once again, especially as it's opening and closing themes so distinctly announce.  It's simply been too many years since I've last seen this show and am truly ecstatic in having purchased these.

I'm only on my second disc (having received all seven dvds today) and each of the characters are exactly as I remember them.. Charles Nelson Reilly, Rita Shaw , the children, skruffy, the Captain (Edward Mulhare) and of course, the lovely Hope Lange.  Well written scripts, entertaining and just downright funny, in my opinion.

Just being able to enjoy this show again makes it rather difficult to express any complaints.  Video and audio quality of these MODs, thus far, seems quite nice.  Of course, as a fan of the show, I'm one who's always wanting more in the way of seasons and episodes, lol...  The image art on the DVD cases is rather difficult to enjoy (it is unusually dark, in my opinion), but the DVD cases themselves are nice quality, housing a single DVD, and aren't of the cheap variety where there are cut out holes in the case cover, hiding beneath the outside cover art.  The opening menus and chapter selections are quite nice, although when my first disc had completed, it returned to the menu only to lock up (requiring me to power off and restart my player to eject the disc.. hopefully, this won't be an issue with the remaining discs).

As has already been described, these MODs only have a handful of episodes on them (it would have been nicer to have had more episodes on a disc rather than spanning them over several). So, I do appreciate what a few reviewers have expressed in this regard.  But even so, being able to enjoy these episodes once again overrides my criticisms and I will still go with five stars.  Definitely worth having for those like myself who were so fond of this show.  I would definitely recommend adding these to your collection.",1425859200,7,2022,4.648876404494382

6564861,5,B00M8KBGNU,Always loved this series.  Waiting for the whole series to be available instead of one disc at a time.,1421020800,,102,4.368421052631579
6564862,2,B00M8KBGNU,I have been waiting years for this series to be released on dvd and I am so very disappointed to see the way they have chosen to do it. To break one season into so many different discs and sell them individually is blatant thievery. I will hope they eventually release the entire first season in one set and be waiting until then to make a purchase.,1420848000,34,349,4.223880597014926

6564867,4,B00M8KBGNU,I bought the entire first season of this show that I remember from my childhood.  Very clear video.  Sometimes the volume changes slightly - but nothing extreme.  I really enjoy watching this show again and will be purchasing the other seasons too.  If  you are a fan of the show - I highly recommend it!,1416787200,,304,4.454545454545454
6564868,1,B00M8KBGNU,Good ol' show BUT I won't buy it. Not the way they're separating the Disc's for the price of the whole series. Thanks but no thanks.,1416700800,6,132,4.115384615384615

6564870,1,B00M8KBGNU,"This was one of my favorites as a kid... however

I used to be mad when greedy companies would rip people off by charging an outrageous amount for full seasons (Perry Mason/Mod Squad etc.) by splitting them in half and selling them separately for $50-60, but this is absolutely ridiculous!!! $75 for one season of a TV show by selling it 5-6 episodes at a time is highway robbery.

Amazon should be ashamed for letting these people gouge fans like this.

Put all four discs in one collection for maybe $20-30 dollars, then I'll be interested, but this is undisguised greed pure and simple",1416096000,110,588,4.634615384615385
6564871,5,B00M8KBGNU,This was & is a great series.  I had forgotten a lot about it.  The pilot episode is outstanding. I highly recommend the purchase of this series.  The only complaint I have is the cover photo on the DVD box....to dark to see Captain Gregg with his telescope.  This is a fun set & I am anxious to purchase more.,1416009600,2,310,4.116666666666666
6564872,5,B00M8KBGNU,"I saw this series when it came on TV in the late 60's and it has stood the test of time. I like the ""romance"" between Carolyn Muir and Captain Gregg.",1414886400,,149,3.838709677419355

I felt the quality of the picture was just fine on the DVD.",1413590400,,150,3.870967741935484

6564877,5,B00M8KBGNU,"I purchased the 3 dvds available for season one. I have just finished watching the first of the three. I love this series and I am hoping they will release the remainder of the first season along with the rest of the series! What a great show and worth the expense. I know some have complained about the fact it is pricey, but, you are getting 7 episodes per disc which is equivalent to a movie. So, think about it in that vein.

Amazon has made these b/c of the demand and is exclusive through Amazon. I found so far, this first dvd, to be of excellent quality! I plan on watching the next 2 shortly and know I will not be disappointed.

For all of us Ghost and Mrs. Muir fans, let's focus on getting the remainder of the series released!!!! It will for sure be worth the purchase and of course enjoyment!!!!!",1410912000,28,810,4.253246753246753
6564878,1,B00M8KBGNU,"I felt ripped off when I realized that this disk was not the full first season, but only a mere 6 episodes. There were only 50 episodes in the series which would push this price up to 150+ dollars for the 2 seasons. What other 1960's series plays that game... 6 shows per disk? Certainly not the higher rated Bewitched or I Dream of Jeannie.

I guess I now deception to keep my eye out for from now on.
The show was fun.. but not for 75 bucks a season!",1410134400,10,452,4.022222222222222

8670750,5,B00M8KBGNU,"I, as others, have waited for a long time to get this DVD.  I only ordered the first disc until I looked it over and of course, I ordered the next.  My only issue is one of confusion.  I just received Season 1, disc 1.  The next one is Season 1, disc 3.  Where is disc 2?",1526256000,,271,3.6842105263157894
8670751,3,B00M8KBGNU,"I loved the show so many years ago and I was so thrilled to discover they have it out on DVD
BUT.....
The DVD does not have any copyright logo anywhere on the jacket and it feels 'bootleggy' meaning it felt like everything was thrown in in a sloppy way. Picture was slightly fuzzy and there were no option to have captioning for those who are hearing impaired. (funny, the subtitle menu was greyed out in my computer DVD.. but there were NO menu option for subtitle on my regular DVD player)

""When sold by Amazon.com, this product will be manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media.""

I'm sorry but Amazon should have done right by its customers but chose to not do so.

8670754,5,B00M8KBGNU,"This little gem of a show first aired back in ""68, and has not lost it's charm. Briefly, it is the story of a single mom and her two children,, and their nanny in the classical haunted house. The ghost was played to perfection by the actor Edward Mulhare, as the lady of the show was played by Hope Lang. The living and the Ghost reside in Gull cottage, a simply perfect scene for all the fun. Can't understand why it took so long for this gem to see light of day, but, I'm glad it's finally out.",1499904000,,496,4.071428571428571

It's both charming and amusing with real LOL moments in every episode.  You'll have to decide for yourself if it's within your budget or not but if it is, I highly recommend it especially if you have small children who will find it fun as well as also stimulating their imaginations.",1462406400,,438,4.518987341772152
