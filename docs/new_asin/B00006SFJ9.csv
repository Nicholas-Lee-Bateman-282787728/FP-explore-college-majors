1792615,5,B00006SFJ9,"I was a big fan of the ""Rocky Jones - Space Ranger"" serials as a kid. I watched them religiously on Saturday mornings. They were the epitome of campy sci-fi. They had cheesy special efects, and the ""science"" was mostly wrong, but who cares. They were and are a lot of fun, and the moral is ""Be a good person and one day you'll be a space ranger.""",1123545600,6,346,4.102941176470588
1792616,4,B00006SFJ9,"A compilation of episodes from ""Rocky Jones, Space Ranger"", ""Crash of the Moons"" is a wonderful example of the kind of kids sci-fi show from the dawn of television.
Two ""gypsy moons"" are about to collide with a planet, Opheish. The moons are populated, and the United Worlds sends in Rocky Jones and the Space Rangers to help. But the power-hungry ruler of Opheish, the evil Queen Cleolantra, will stop at nothing to have things her way. In this case, it means destroying the gypsy moons and killing everyone on them!
The science here is not exactly up to date, but quaint nevertheless.
Most of the cast surpasses the sub-par, cliche-ridden material, and offer up convincing characterizations. Richard Crane plays Rocky Jones with movie serial he-man gusto. Scotty Beckett, a former child star from the Our Gang series, plays Winky, the flight officer of the rocket ship Orbit Jet. Beckett is strangely effective as a sort of proto-Sulu, comfortably operating his rocket ship controls as if they actually worked. John Banner, forever famous as the bumbling Sergeant Schultz on ""Hogan's Heroes"", plays King Bavarro with a sense of fun, while Patsy Parsons' Queen Cleolantra is such a sneaky and conniving diva, she could probably have taken over ""Dynasty"" AND ""Falcon Crest"" without breaking a sweat.
This is a fun time for fans of early sci-fi, and despite being edited together from three or four episodes, the story plays smoothly.",1036368000,10,1433,5.0
1792617,4,B00006SFJ9,CRASH OF THE MOONS is a good old Rocky Jones adventure and it's fun to watch it. But be informed that it is recorded in the EP mode.,961545600,2,132,3.75
7973057,4,B00006SFJ9,"1950 TV converted to spectacular... well watchable movie filled with future technology. The advantage in this film is that you do not have to wait until next week to find out what happens.
Two populated moons are about to crash. One governed by good people. The other ruled by a devious, tricky, tyrantita Patsy Parsons as ""Queen Cleolanta."" Richard Crane as Rocky Jones is in the middle. The action is a gas.

One of my favorite Rocky Jones Characters is Trinka (Nan Leslie) who stared later with Lois Nettleton in ""The Bamboo Saucer"" (1968)",1505433600,,542,4.76595744680851

Played fine on my New DVD player, but on the older player came up as an unrecognized disk? Still - it was a great buy. Was shipped and received quickly.",1403827200,,245,4.304347826086956
7973059,4,B00006SFJ9,"ROCKY JONES, SPACE RANGER was a show from when I was a kid.  Watching it today may not be as exciting but it does bring back the good times of our youth.  Todays shows relay on special effects no imagination.  The shows of yesteryear makes you use your mind and it can be far more inventive.  Rocky Jones may not be for the youth of today but for the older people it can be fun and bring back happy times of our youth.",1353283200,,418,4.0

This movie is basically 3 episodes of ""Rocky Jones"" joined in one as for the time it did had good but now cheap effects and the acting is quite bad i'm afraid, it's a good thing MST3K riffed this movie even if it's one of their weakest episodes.",1308614400,,471,4.292134831460674

7973063,4,B00006SFJ9,"This is for the Front Row edition.  The correct title is ""Crash of Moons"" as is on the film itself.  One of many films edited from the TV show, this is great entertainment.  I will not recommend this edition because of a splice during dialogue which is not on some other prints, such as the Treeline 50-movie pack.",1296259200,,314,4.379310344827586
