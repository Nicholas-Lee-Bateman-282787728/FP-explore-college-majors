Watched with interest the towns, especially ghost towns, in every Western I ever saw. Have many books (Lambert Florin etc)on towns and gold rush days.

Bought this tape, found it OK but too generalised, not enough actual footage of Idaho ghost towns and too much about gold rush characters.",1189987200,2,384,4.892307692307693
