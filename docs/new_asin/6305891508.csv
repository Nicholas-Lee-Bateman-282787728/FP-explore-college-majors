1085523,5,6305891508,the movie the minion is a very interesting and on the edge of your seat movie. dolph is such a good actor also his co-star was also excellent as well. i would recommend this movie to anyone.,1302048000,,190,4.162162162162162
1085524,4,6305891508,"I have been a Dolph Lundgren fan ever since I saw Masters Of The Universe in the theater as a kid.  That continued on with Rocky 4, Universal Soldier and Johnny Mnemonic (HALT SINNERS!)  The Minion is your typical direct to video action flick.  Couple good fights, decent story; it's not going to blow anyone away. However if your a Dolph fan and it can be had for a low price, it's worth the run time to check out.  Even if just to reminisce of all those end of the millennium movies that came out in the late 90's.  The film is a 2 or 3 star, but the Lundgren factor kicks it up a star in my book.",1284422400,,599,4.0
1085525,5,6305891508,This is an awesome movie; I love action pack movies and I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren.  I have review many of his movies and he has been excellent in all of them.,1169510400,,161,3.735294117647059
1085526,1,6305891508,"First off, I am a big fan of Dolph Lundgren. I say that so you will know that I'm not just sitting here writting a review for a film staring someone that I do not like in the first place. The Minion, what can say about this movie. One word, terrible. From start to finish, it was just bad. Dolph's acting was wooden, the script was bad, the directing was bad and the supporting cast were bad, particularly the guy who played the lead investigating officer, you guessed it! The movie looked cheap and its main action set piece was lifted straight from The Terminator police station massacre. Hard to believe from the fight scenes in this movie that Dolph Lundgren was once the European Heavyweight Full-Contact Karate Champion and Australian heavyweight division title champion in the 80's. I know he is supposed to be playing a priest but I'm sure even a priest could fight better than Dolph does in this. Having a Demon pass from person to person is a good plot device that we have seen before and could of been good had it been done well. Unfortunatly the makers of the movie even managed to make these scenes when they happened, look stupid. Two people gave this 5 star reviews on Amazon. The only reason I can think of for doing this is that they are now trying to sell their copies of The Minion used, and are hoping for a better price by giving a top mark review for this trash. Dolph Lundgren is an intelligent person and should know better than to be involved in movies like this. Very dissapointing. Avoid, avoid, avoid..........",1097798400,5,1538,4.516129032258065
1085527,5,6305891508,"This movie is great, I was very entertained by it. Im a big Lundgren fan anyway, and it was cool to see him without a gun every once in awhile in a movie.  The acting was very good i thought, he did awesome as he always does. The story and the plot was really awesome, and the Biblical references were great on the key and so on. God works in mysterious ways, well check this movie out its great!",985305600,,396,4.012658227848101
1085528,2,6305891508,"This movie is really really a stinker.  All the action is poorly done, and comes off even cheasier then it should.  Most of the acting is horrible, and the story is bland.  Nothing in this movie does what it should (hello it can't even keep its religions straight).  I would say that it was because of a low budget, but the movie had $12,000,000.  They could at least have made some of the fights look good, but sadly no.  If you are in need of a good horror movie rent ""Kolobos"" or ""Bloody Murder"" (the latter is super cheesy and low budget but is way better then this movie).  Try something else because this is a pretty lame movie.  Although it is still better then ""End Of Days"".",977270400,3,683,4.28125
1085529,1,6305891508,"The people who made this movie evidently have never even seen a good movie.  I work at a video store so I saw it for free,  but I still feel cheated, I wasted an hour and a half.",975974400,,178,3.6578947368421053
1085530,5,6305891508,"This movie is one of Dolph's best, for his acting and the general overall tone of the film, Dolph plays a knight templar, an ancient order of warrior monks, whose job it is to prevent a key falling into the hands of the devils minion, if this key falls into the hands of the minion, then satan will be unleashed and armageddon will be upon the world. The minion takes over bodies by staring into their eyes, so the potential enemy changes frequently. Anyway I recommend this film highly even if you are not a fan of lundgren, there is enough here to keep anyone entertained.",974592000,7,574,4.4245283018867925
1085531,4,6305891508,"I saw this movie when it was on tv . The movie realiy draws you in it has a dark look to it . Very well written and acted . Dolph give his best in this movie . I have not seens such well acting and writing in a movie since  ""fallen""!  This movie is a must see for just about anyone .",957916800,3,283,3.4761904761904763
7897098,3,6305891508,"It's a crying shame that Lundgren is the only one in the movie that knew how to pronounce minion. The other inexplicable torture of the English language on top of the occasional bad acting, terrible direction, phony and predictable story line really made it bad when it could have been quite a good movie. ...eh, c'est la vie.",1510444800,,326,4.637931034482759

7897103,1,6305891508,"Not worth the time, really - mind numbing cliched everything. Better to watch Leverage or Burn Notice, anything but this. It is really annoying to watch Lundgren stomp around , pretend to weild a sword with a cute New Yorker. Makes no sense. Oh yeah and the minions - are hilarious. If you eer saw the original Dracula they modeled their minions after Mr. Renfield.",1497052800,,365,4.630769230769231

7897106,2,6305891508,"dolph being ascetic doesn't seem to work here.  very good costar, pretty much B movie everywhere else, most especially the script.  i mean, seriously, you get the life history of a foreign national, with no name and no photo, who has never been in the country, in 15 minutes?  on christmas eve?
you have an anthro professor do an autopsy in a police station? (which is simultaneously referred to as the highway patrol station and the sheriff's station?)
it just goes on.  don't bother
the random screams, groans, and grunting that splash around throughout the film are distracting and annoying.",1494028800,,594,4.91
