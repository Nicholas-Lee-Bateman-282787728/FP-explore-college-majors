7801668,1,1933185805,"This is the first study that our group has quit before we finished it.
I can see how this lesson might be useful for denominations where women are supposed to be submissive.  As a group tied to a Methodist church with a female preacher, this study simply dragged on too long.

Pro: I like her message that women are involved in the battle and we need to stop pretending we are on the sidelines.
I can see how this book could make a very useful focus for a weekend retreat.

Con: Bought the DVD pack, the Book, and the fencing manual-- Kinda pricey all together.
The DVD lessons are simply readings of the Women with swords book.
The first chapter is mostly a summary of the plot of ""Terminator""--while she makes a good point with it--I paid for a book that summarized the movie, then listened to a DVD where she reads her book.  It would have been more interesting/faster to just show a movie clip.
Another chapter, she describes a dream her friend had and treats it as being just as valid as the Bible.

This is NOT a Bible study.  The book makes a few good points, but does not have enough substance to justify the EIGHT sessions.",1431561600,5,1132,4.366666666666666
