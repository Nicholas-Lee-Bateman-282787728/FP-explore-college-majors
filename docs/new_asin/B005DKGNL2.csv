4660853,5,B005DKGNL2,My husband and I are both huge midsomer murder fans and am very disappointed that John Nettles is retiring from the series.  I ordered this for my husband for Valentines and he was thrilled.  John Nettles does a short interview at the beginning of each show and it is worth buying for that alone.  This seller is very good and was very prompt with the shipping.,1329436800,,361,4.4393939393939394
4660854,5,B005DKGNL2,"Interesting to see Nettles' favorite Midsomer Murder episodes were quite different than my own favorites.  Many of my friends are also fellow addicts of Midsomer Murders and their favorite episodes were closer to my choices so it was illuminating.  Although all these episodes were familiar, Midsomer Murders' DVDs are so absorbing that my circle have watched many an episode repeatedly and I have started watching them all from the beginning.",1326153600,,443,5.314285714285714
4660855,5,B005DKGNL2,"If you are watching these episodes for the first time, or like me after 18 sets of episodes you don't remember who done it, then don't watch the introductions first. John Nettles does not reveal the murderer but sometimes in the clips that are shown during his interview the murderer is shown in the act. This, of course, ruins the viewing of the episode. As for these episodes, they are all very good - Blue Herrings is my favorite. I have to say that I found Sergeant Troy's immaturity and lack of respect for practically everyone in any category but his own, grating. For this reason I am much fonder of the series with his third partner and if you haven't seen any of the later episodes, you should give them a try.",1322956800,5,719,4.413533834586466
4660856,5,B005DKGNL2,"Those of us who are deaf and until now have been able to enjoy only the  subtitled  episodes in Series 12 and later can now see and understand ten of the early episodes as well.  These ten episodes were selected from Series One thourgh Six and we can only hope there will be another dvd  made from episodes selected from Series Seven through Eleven. This collection would also be a good choice for hearing people who do not want to invest in the entire collection of Midsomer Murders. In any case, the comments on this dvd by John Nettles explaining why he chose each particular episode as one of his ""Top Ten"" give insight into relationships among the actors as well as behind the scenes information on things that went slightly awry during shooting.  I am a long standing fan of BBC productions and find that Midsomer Murders is fascinating because each one  allows the discovery of the familiar faces of top rated British actors from other productions popping up as victims, murderers and assorted bystanders as Barnaby solves the crime with a light hearted touch amidst stunning scenery  As they might say -- ""what larks!""",1322179200,5,1126,4.714285714285714
4660857,5,B005DKGNL2,"I purchased the 3 sets (Early Cases, Village Cases and Barnaby's Casebook) that included all shows up to season 12. Does anyone know if they will turn out another set with season 13-18 or 19??? This is a wonderful series that can be watched and enjoyed over and over. The earlier episodes with Sgt. Troy were outstanding. That was magical chemistry. Jones is good too. Couldn't stand the middle guy- can't even remember his name. Sorry to see Nettles leaving. He gave us some great entertainment!",1318464000,7,496,4.77906976744186
4660858,5,B005DKGNL2,"Television's most murderous county is Midsomer, England, and the show has been solving multiple murders in episodes for over a decade. John Nettles, Midsomer's DCI Tom Barnaby, is soon to disappear from DVD episodes (not quite yet) even though he has already been replaced in the ongoing new episodes on British TV, shows not yet allowed to be presented via DVD. The amazing Nettles here presents his 10 favorite 100-minute episodes. These mysteries come from previously released series, but they promise to be introduced by Nettles with anecdotes. He shares some reasons why these selections are special to him.
Expect some smiles (& LOL), a touch of romance, some awesome scenic footage of beautiful village life in England, of course crime mystery, some blood-but not too much, and a sensational support cast with always the sub-plots through relationships. If you are new to Midsomer Murders, they are based on books by Caroline Graham. There are other ways to get episodes, but this is as good a way to begin as any. If you have all of the previously released episodes, then these will be repeats, but with the Nettle notes addition.
I have never watched a less-than GREAT episode of Midsomer Murders.

The set includes these episodes, 10 DVDs, and SUBTITLES are provided.
The Killings at Badger's Drif
Blue Herrings
A Worm in the Bud
Dark Autumn
Dead Man's Eleven
Death of a Hollow Man
The Electric Vendetta
Murder on St. Malley's Day
A Talent for Life
Strangler's Wood

Equal to Poirot in view-ability. Millions love it, me included. You will too!",1313280000,15,1554,4.927480916030534

8467070,5,B005DKGNL2,"Inspector Barnaby can do no wrong.  Although we love the ""new"" Midsommer Murders with Neil Dudgeon ... John Nettles' Tom Barnaby will always be our favorite.  He is quiet but effective, and gets his points across without shouting or profanity like so very many others do these days.  Midsommer Murders is a ""clean"" (for the number of murders that occur each episode :) and incredible series ... with BOTH Inspector Barnabys' which we will never tire of.  R. & W. Palmer",1451260800,,469,4.753086419753086
8467071,4,B005DKGNL2,"Unlike Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple, these stories often have more than 1 murder per and sometimes even more than one murderer. Things get a little complicated rather than strategic. Otherwise the scenery is pleasant and the official characters are likable - but not as interesting as Holmes & Marple. :)",1417392000,,306,5.019607843137255
8467072,5,B005DKGNL2,My favorite Mystery series.  I watch these episodes often.  Sad that John Nettles has retired but being at about the same age I can understand his desire to go in a different direction with his life.,1402185600,,199,4.5
8467073,5,B005DKGNL2,"I have just fallen in love with this show and have watched all episodes but the very last two new ones for this year but honestly if your a fan of the show, These our the classics indeed and the very best of the best of them!",1389225600,,225,3.8085106382978724
8467074,2,B005DKGNL2,"Worst Midsomer Murders DVD set.  The video presentation is ""Letterboxed"" and ""Pillarboxed"".  Other Midsomer Murders DVDs of similar vintage are not.",1384905600,,148,6.0
8467075,5,B005DKGNL2,"I have watched Midsomer Murders for years and absolutely love every episode! Each one has a different unique storyline....of course containing...guess what?...a murder!! You never see the gore as such when you watch other shows. :) The shows are rated PG for all types of ages! I still enjoy re-watching the programs. Of course, along with the murder is beautiful scenery of the English countryside. Overall this series is worth the time to watch and watch again!! Enjoy with a good cup of English tea!",1372377600,,502,4.91764705882353
8467076,5,B005DKGNL2,I made a mistake before ordering a set that was already in a series I had purchased.  Thanks for the warning.  I also hope they put out a new set with episodes not included in the 3 main boxed sets. This is a great program.,1364083200,,223,3.933333333333333
8467077,5,B005DKGNL2,"When I purchased this, I got it for a price that you usually pay for just 4 shows, so I really got a bargain to have 10 shows on it.  I wanted some of the shows with John Nettles and it was really neat that these were the shows that he picked for various reasons.  The other collections had more shows, but were close to $100 or so each and that was too much money.  This one gives you a very good variety of the shows for a good price.",1359417600,,436,3.8222222222222224
