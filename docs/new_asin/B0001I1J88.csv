2002830,4,B0001I1J88,"I found a few of the moves in this video to be difficult to pick up at first, but I refused to give up because the rest was so much fun.  The first time I did the video, I was screwing up some of the moves left and right (some of the moves are easy, some take more coordination), but I was still getting a good workout and kept noticing that I had a smile on my face.  It didn't feel like work, it was fun.  Stick with it and you will probably end up loving it.",1083456000,27,461,3.731958762886598
2002831,5,B0001I1J88,"This is my favorite of all the Masala Bhangra workout volumes.  There is a lot of jumping, so it really gets the heart pumping.  If you have knee or back problems, I might recommend the ""Hip Hop"" volume because it is a lower impact workout.  This is lots of fun, and I find the time flies by when I do it.",1205971200,3,305,3.9672131147540983
2002832,1,B0001I1J88,"Pros:  Many steps are simple & repetitive, making it theoretically easy for beginners to follow.  You are constantly moving so get a decent workout.

CONS:  The camera only focuses on the instructor's face and bouncing boobs.  You can't see the arms, torso, or leg motions, so even though it seems like they are doing fun moves it's hard to figure out what they're doing.  (check out the YouTube clip for an example).
Also, the instructor is annoying in this vid in how she has yells gruffly.

I would not recommend buying this Vol 3 Bollywood Style video.

However, I would recommend Vol 2 Hip Hop Style which is has much better camera angles of footwork.",1190592000,,656,4.643478260869565
2002833,1,B0001I1J88,"If you own any of Sarina's other Bhangra videos, don't bother with this. It's just the same steps all over again. Very repetitive.  All she did differentlyt  was put different music in it (which isn't even Bollywood music) and have her dancers change clothes.  The cinematography and camera angles  were just terrible.  You can't even see her feet during most of the dance segments, yet you can tell from glimpses of the background dancers there's some fancy footwork going on. You just see her flailing her arms and wearing that annoying headset the whole time, which I found to be a turn off.

I think if you really want to learn bollywood dance, watch a few bollywood videos on YouTube for free, copy the moves, and viola, you can learn the dance.",1185753600,2,750,4.643939393939394
2002834,4,B0001I1J88,"I think some of the people who reviewed this DVD didn't understand what it was. First of all it is not an instructional dance video, it's a fitness video, thus there is going to be a fair amount of repetition and emphasis on fitness aspects rather than dance aspects per se. However, by putting fitness into a framework of dance, it makes it more fun and interesting. Even though it is ""bollywood style"" it is still bhangra style, which is supposed to be a more high impact, energetic and somewhat macho dance form. Don't expect a bunch of hip swaying filmi moves, this is not what bhangra is. I have done many, many fitness videos at home and this is one I really feel I *want* to do, not feeling as though it's the chore that some other fitness videos become after 3 or 4 times. Jain is a great instuctor and good at cueing. The video is reasonably well-shot giving you enough views to follow the movements. I do however prefer the teaching set-up of the first video in the series; this one does move a bit faster and the movements are slightly more demanding and complicated. I also agree with the reviewer who said this video is more for at least an intermediate level of fitness, and not for those who can't handle high-impact or have joint problems. If you are bored of your workouts, this is the video for you! Sarina Jain rocks!",1179878400,2,1336,4.434959349593496
2002835,2,B0001I1J88,"Do you see the number of people on the cover of the dvd?!  All of these people dressed in black are in diamond formation to fit onto the screen at once.  The main instructor becomes harder to distinguish from others; the entire thing is visually busy.

Sarina has this husky almost out of breath voice.  The movements did not feel sultry or fun... it felt alot more like Taebo with strong energy and power behind movements instead of that pop seduction of the type of bollywood workout I was looking for.

Another technical problem was that the video rarely focused on the feet... many times we would just see Sarina from the midsection and up.  Most foot moves started with the camera on the upper half of Sarina (if you were adept, you could figure out the moves either by instruction alone, or by trying to view one of the 3 people whose feet were just visible beside Sarina's shoulders.  After about 2 sets of foot movements, the camera would pan down to the feet, only to have a color bar cross over a portion of the screen showing the title of the foot movement.

I'm sure if you could get past all of what I mentioned, you would get a great work out.  Who wouldnt when you're jumping around and flailing your arms around with the strength of a bull (in a china shop).",1178928000,7,1274,4.3872340425531915
2002836,4,B0001I1J88,"Pros: Good workout, burns calories along with fun music and

bollywood steps, which you can dance away at the parties.

Cons: Complete Steps are taught first and then reviewed and then you go at

full speed.

I like the Masala Bhangra Workout Vol 1, where 4 steps are taught, reviewed and practiced and then you go to the next steps.",1174867200,2,333,4.5
2002837,5,B0001I1J88,"If you love Indian films and world music, prepare to drop a dress size!  You can burn 500 calories an hour dancing Bhangra and Bollywood style, and it is so joyful and fun you will never realize an hour has passed.  I am a non-Desi baby-boomer in not the best shape.  When I first saw Sarina Jain on All-Star Workouts on Discovery Health, I DVR'd the show and have been doing it every day from start to finish.  I am astonished that I am able to hang in there.  I admit I have bought a lot of exercise DVD's that lose me in the first ten minutes of cardio.  I just can't keep up, and I get bored and frustrated, and suddenly remember a half dozen other things I gotta do.  But the steady beat of the dhol and the easy-to-master moves Sarina Jain presents get your heart rate up and keep it up in the calorie burning range for as long as you care to stay with it.  This will make you sweat and keep you sweating, but in a good way.

A neighbor of mine who is 58 has recently gone through the outpatient weight loss program at a famous hospital in Boston.  She paid thousands of dollars for this program and more for the weight-loss shakes they recommended.  They told her that the secret to weight loss is to reduce your caloric intake to about 1000 calories a day, measure your portions at first to see what you're actually taking in, and to perform some kind of cardiovascular exercise that makes you sweat for about 30 minutes a day.  That's it.  I've found that goal of 30 minutes of cardio kind of hard to accomplish because I hate taking a shower, doing my hair, putting on makeup and then going to the gym, but now I'm doing 30 minutes of bhangra twice a day at home.  For some reason I never get tired of this stuff. And once you know the moves, you can change the music to any Bollywood tunes with a similar beat, like -- just one example -- Bole Chudiyan from K3G! It's not like anything else.  This is about celebration and the joy of life, pure and simple.  Try it and you'll feel happier, more energetic, and it will lift your spirits, guaranteed.  Have fun!!! Dance like Rani!!!",1171238400,7,2091,4.253164556962025
2002838,3,B0001I1J88,"I was really looking forward to learning how do learn the Bhangra moves as well as get some exercise.  Unfortunately, the camera focused on the instructor's FACE way too much of the time.  There is a great deal of foot movements and it was pretty much useless to watch her face when it was the feet that the camera should have been focused on.  Although there was some panning back, it was not enough and often too late and I finished the cd quite frustrated and not wanting to watch again.  If you know the moves, then this is an okay cd but if you are learning, which is what I thought this cd was, this is not a great one.",1170979200,7,625,4.140495867768595
2002839,3,B0001I1J88,"I got this because I love bollywood and the music. This workout, however, is so-so. It's a lot of repetition and once you finally get it...the moves don't match the music. That was particularly frustrating because I want to DANCE (and the workout is an aside). Also, I sometimes wished that the camara moved back so that you could see the whole move. That being said, you definitely sweat and get a workout. There is a lot of jumping and you certainly feel that you did some great aerobic activity. I wish her warm up and cool down were expanded...it's a lot of up and down shoulders and Jain saying ""awesome.""  Overall, I will continue to do this workout but I'm still looking for a great bollywood workout.",1133654400,17,708,4.53125
2002840,3,B0001I1J88,"I think this is a decent video for intermediate level exercisers and those who can handle high impact workouts.

This workout was a lot of fun and very challenging. You also get to listen to music that isn't usually played in aerobics videos (Dhol, a kind of drum).

The video has a warm up, a break down of the dance moves, and two jams. The two jams are the routines, the first one is an easier version.

One problem with the video is the camera work. The camera doesn't do enough close ups of the foot work. To get past this flaw you can rewind a couple of times and practice that way. Another problem is that the warm up uses some of the dance moves that Sarina doesn't teach you until the workout section, where she breaks down the moves.  I would watch a little of the workout section first for a break down of the first few moves then start with the warm up.  See, it's a bit confusing.

The moves incorporate a lot of hopping and jumping. So, if you have knee problems or can't handle any high impact moves, you should avoid this video.

A lot of fun for me cause I grew up with my South Asian friends translating bollywood movies for me.  I have a real respect for those dancers.  It is hard to keep up!",1126483200,23,1212,4.189655172413793

8012858,5,B0001I1J88,"For years I hated working out, and then I discovered yoga. Yoga was about the only exercise I would do, until I found Sabrina Jain's Masala Bhangra workouts, which now give me my cardio. They are so much fun and so challenging, and even a clumsy anti-aerobics person like me can do them and have a great time in the process.

8012860,3,B0001I1J88,"I love Sarina Jain's Masala Bhangra workout 1 &2, she has great energy & the moves are fun. The first one is the best, but the second breakdown the moves better.
Intro (2 min)
Warm-up (7 min)
Full music that is also used in the menu. Two guys in the back corners play drums but seem a bit bored. Small room with 8 backup women & 1 guy (who you rarely see since he's on the side). A bit crowded, but not too distracting. Usually far away shot, but sometimes has too close-up of Sarina. As another said, with the basic stretches, she uses a couple dance moves like the basic step before the teaching segment which is odd.
Dance Instruction (15 min)
Here the ""music"" is only a slow feeling basic beat. It's the same as the music, but it sounds more beat, rest, beat, rest. Here the camerawork & editing is horrendous. The camera is almost always zoomed on Sarina's face/torso, and as lovely as she is, you have to fight to see the back row's feet to know how to move. Occasionally there is a smaller box video of very close-up of the feet for a few seconds but it feels too disjointed. After every single move she teaches, it blacks out abruptly to rejoin them standing there for the next move. Many times it even cuts off before they finish the move so you are still moving all by yourself. It was unnecessary, and I think it lowered Sarina's energy who obviously enjoys/likes to keep going until the end. Her enthusiasm is lower & her movements seem less energetic. There are a few moves that are different from the previous two workouts, but I did not like them, one has hopping up/down 7x, then hopping 6x side to side. There's another w/deep squats in it. I think there were possibly less moves taught total then the other two workouts had, several I remember weren't there. The good thing was that Sarina really introduces the moves in 1/4 speed, very slow, too slow for me, but very easy to follow and breaks down to do only the lower portion, then upper. But you only practice it 2-3x normal speed before the next move is introduced.
Review (5 min)
Here the tempo picks up w/the 2 drummers, but it still is a bit dull. There are four backup girls & the guy is right behind Sarina which is nice. Sarina does much better here as there is no editing/cutting every min like previous section. She puts the moves into a routine w/the basic step used in between each one. The camera stays far away during moves, but very close again when she does the basic step.
Jam (11 min)
All the dancers are back, but the music is like a dance remix style, w/even occasional vocal word like the warm-up. Why this wasn't done throughout like her previous versions? The camerawork is even better, with some sweeping shots & only close-ups on basic step.
Jam #2 (8 min)
All the dancers, dance remix again, all the moves, but no basic step in between. Good camerawork.
Cool Down (5 min)
A different dance remix that's interesting. Four girls & 1 guy backup. Basic stretches & some slower dance moves. Camera is mostly far shot. Drummers are gone which is actually nice.

8012861,4,B0001I1J88,"I am not one who usually does work out DVDs but I got this to do while I was on vacation. I was skeptical of how hard it would be because I work out 5 days a week, running and taking spinning classes. I was really impressed how well this got my heart rate up! Yes, I am uncoodinated, so I'm sure the footwork will get easier as I do it more, but it goes back to the basic move enough that I didn't get frustrated when I messed up. I also liked the repetition, because it helped me get the hang of the moves. There is enough jumping that I wouldn't consider this if I had knee problems, but it's a great high energy work out and has really fun dance moves. The 45 minutes really flew by and I had a lot of fun, and got a great workout.",1230422400,,734,3.8675496688741724
8012862,1,B0001I1J88,"I didn't find the videoo demonstrations useful at all. Although its a big group demonstrating, the camera focuses only on the main lead, that too her face more than necessary. Its tough to follow the foot steps, the camera hardly ever shows the foot movements clearly... not recommended.
