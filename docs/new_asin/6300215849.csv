246733,4,6300215849,"This intense movie portrays a man running for his life from african warriors.  The chase scenes are dramatic, tense, and realistic.  After the initial scenes of torture which are somewhat fantastical and stereotypical,  the african warriors are portrayed as strong, fierce, brave, and  single-minded in their pursuit of their prey.  It becomes a battle of wits  and endurance between the hunters and the hunted.  This is not a  flashy  and shallow modern movie, it is a dramatic portrayal of man against man, in  a struggle for survival.",932256000,2,537,5.068965517241379

246816,5,6300215849,"When I first watched this flick as a young boy I was rattled to the core. The story was like nothing I had ever seen, pioneering, and so intense it left an indelible mark on me ever since.

Although released in 1966, this movie was cinematically shot in a very realistic format with an appropriately primitive tribal soundtrack that added to its realism. Cornel Wilde played his part very well, being hunted like game sport by an African tribe, due to his employers haughty inability to deal with a primitive culture.

Cornels lone stance of defending himself in the wilds of nature, living off the land, and sabotaging and annihilating his hunters surely was the precursor to Stallones First Blood.

Having watched this movie again recently, to see if it maintained its impact, I was pleasantly surprised that it indeed did.

Naked Prey is a classic film of survival and clashing cultures, which admittedly will not suite the faint of heart or those who need special effects or are too impatient to watch a film with little dialogue. Yet Naked Prey has tons of suspense and emotional impact that simply cannot be forgotten. This is one of those rare gems that slipped through the cracks. But thanks to modern technology its available to all, and well worth the time and money.",1490572800,,1277,4.764705882352941
246817,5,6300215849,"This is the BEST survival movie ever made. No one comes close. Cornel Wilde made this in Africa because it was less expensive than making it in the U.S., or so I heard. It's based off Jack Colter's experience as a hunter/guide being chased by Blackfoot native Americans in the early 1800s.

In Africa 19th Century, Cornel Wilde leads an expedition for hunting elephants. The ivory trade is at its height, and the slaughter of elephants is brutal in this film, and I suspect the film shots were real (something I preferred not to have seen considering how elephants in Africa may soon be extinct due to man's thirst for acquiring ivory).

After one of the men in Cornel's group insults an African chief, the local tribe attacks the caravan and murders them in brutal fashion. They save Cornel's character for last. He must run a few hundred yards ahead before the natives go after him one by one. The only thing is that Cornel fights well for his life, killing them one by one as they face off in the jungle.

The scenery is beautiful, yet harsh. This film put Cornel Wilde at top for some time. You will enjoy it very much.",1489104000,3,1123,4.495098039215686

This high-tension adventure tale follows a man who is relentlessly pursued by an African tribe after his safari leader refuses to pay tribute to the tribe. At times, you have to put your ""This would never happen in real life, but that's ok"" cap on, to keep enjoying the film. However, the film is MOST enjoyable. Cornel Wilde directed and acts in this high-stakes, never let go adventure movie that thankfully will never be forgotten, thanks to Criterion.",1476489600,,581,4.938775510204081
246856,3,6300215849,"I mean I watched it from beginning to the end.  Not gonna lie, with older movies I don't know what to expect.  Will they be black & white?  No closed captioning?  But this was color and CC, so that was great.  I liked the story, but...  SPOILERS AHEAD:

If the Man knew what was coming when they insulted the local populace, why not say you know what, just take this from my paycheck?  Or why not start hiding or something since he knew a lot of heck was supposedly coming down?

If you're hiding from people trying to kill you, why walk out in the open?  Why risk giving up your weapon around dangerous lions while trying to kill huge animals you'll only be able to take a few bites of before you have to run again?  And could those lions be any lazier?  Kill your own darn prey!

Finally, I didn't love that they didn't translate the conversations from the pursuers.  You could clearly see they were strategizing and debating.  Completely disagree with majority of reviewers saying it didn't matter.  It seemed only the English dialog mattered and who cares what the bushmen were saying?  That's how I saw it, anyway.",1471392000,,1119,4.46039603960396
246857,3,6300215849,"The Naked Prey made in 1965, was a vehicle for Cornel Wilde, who directed,  produced and starred in the movie. One of the quintessential creative conceptual movies of the last half of the twentieth century, The Naked Prey, was filmed entirely in Africa, used African actors,  and an uncompromising African musical score all set in what seems to be early 20th century colonial Africa. It was supposed to take place in the badlands of the equatorial part of the continent,  but actually was filmed in Rhodesia, todays Zimbadwe.

Can be purchased as a DVD but was recently released on Netflix.

Taking a page out of the famous short story The Hounds of Zaroff, by Richard Connell, more well known by its first movie adaptation in 1933, The Most Dangerous Game, Wildes character is left with nothing, not even his clothes, and a three or four minute head start before a band of bush tribesman warriors take out after him to hunt him down like an animal because of an insult imparted by one of Wildes hunting party earlier in the film.

Captured and tortured to death the rest of the hunting part is left with only man, Wildes nameless designation to his own cunning and devices to survive out in one of the worlds most unforgiving regions.

He is fortunate that the best fighters in the tribe could not bring him down. The first warrior who ran at full speed to catch up with him, hastily throws his spear and misses. Man not a bad hunter himself, as it was described in the first scenes he knew the terrain better than most white men, grabs the spear and impales the hunter. He then strips him of his spear, his clothing, his shoes, his water and his side knife and continues to run as the other hunters are by now well in pursuit.

As the movie progresses, the warrior brigade dwindles as man kills them off one by one in sometimes fierce hand to hand combat, at least for 1960s standards. The bush men are not one dimensional, as their humanity constantly bubbles to the surface, mourning their dead as they find them.  Son loses a father to man and wales at the sight of him, picking him up in his arms and bringing him back for proper burial.

After killing one of the hunters, man confiscates his bow and arrow, and sets a prairie fire with it to capture and hold them back, hoping to kill them off. It doesnt but it does force the bush men hunters to go around and lose time in capturing and killing their prey.

Mans environment is constantly challenging him, not just in the pursuit but  all the other dangers that exist in that part of the world, snakes, lions, cheetahs, to say nothing of the exposure to the sun and lack of water along his odessy. The symbolism of this white man surviving in these surroundings is nothing less than admirable. For example, ""Man"" uses his spear to bring down an African deer, only to see it taken by a huge lion, leaving him with nothing. He accepts his inferior position to the lion in this realm and moves on.

Late in the film he comes across a rather peaceful and more advanced village in which he witnesses an attack by Muslim slavers. Since this was 1965, there was no political correctness in the west that sought to erase the evil that comes from the Muslim world. This attack was indicative of Samuel Huntingtons 1992 essay, The Clash of Civilizations. Huntington who was a first rate political scientist academic knew of this long and sordid history of Islam,  constantly trying to expand its borders through attack, enslavement, forced conversion and cruel death . He described this kind of activity as the bloody borders of Islam. And, it comes to life in living red color of what passed for blood in 1960s Hollywood, long before the Left started to protect Muslim transgressions against peaceful peoples, (except the Jews of course.) But thats another story.

Slavery to this day is a real problem in the Muslim world but they are rarely if ever called out for it. The scene shows the brutality of this horde of turban wearing murderers, who incarcerate anyone who could bring a good price, young strong males, child bearing females and just killing the rest, old people, babies, and the indigent. Showing them beheading the ones that are not prime slave material strikes a cord we are all too familiar with in the second decade of the 21st century.

The film ends with the man reaching a British stronghold and the chase ends with only two hunters left. Man nods to the head of the bush men,  and he nods back as if both men recognizing each others bravery and cunning in the wild, respecting each others place as warriors  in that world.

A poignant moment to say the least.

This was a better than average movie for those who enjoy action, suspense, and a certain amount of personal intrigue. But, what really sets this movie apart is that it is African. It could not have happened anywhere else like this except on the wilds of the African plain south of the Sahel.  That setting gives it a uniqueness all its own.",1471305600,,4972,4.557800224466891
246858,5,6300215849,"Wilde , So brilliant in Roadhouse (1948) shoulders several responsibilities here (producer , director and lead actor) and does them all superbly . I'd never seen this exceptional film until a couple of weeks ago on Netflix . My strongest recommendation here . Any brief synopsis will tell you more than you need to know going in . Even considering the fact that this is a 1966 film , I regret that I can never share it with my spouse . Unfortunately , she can't tolerate the wildlife aspect alone .

I loved it when I first saw it maybe 50 years ago, and recently bought it to watch it with my 7-year old son.  WE BOTH LOVED IT!

The acting and the action are great, the violence is not needlessly bloody but it is violent, and the screenplay is superb.  It's a classic, highly recommended for father and son together.

Caveat: it's not PC to acknowledge differences between men and women of the opposite sex, but my wife is a typical girly-girl, she abhors violence, and she couldn't watch after 5 minutes.  As a Neanderthal, I'd say this is mostly a guy's film.",1438387200,,623,4.373913043478261

I first saw it decades ago as a child, circa late '60s early '70s, and it left an indelible mark upon my memory. The movie is masterfully done in its simplicity, setting, tone and pace. The idea of hunting the ultimate prey is an intriguing concept. And the ultimate prey, without doubt, is man himself. And without doubt, The Naked Prey is the greatest movie ever made on this archetypal theme. Watch it and enjoy a type of movie making and storytelling not seen today. It is one of my favorites and may become one of yours.",1436832000,,674,4.443548387096774

The bonus commentary regarding the making of the film, the censoring restrictions of the times, the constraints involved due to shooting the film in South Africa when apartheid was still the law of the land, was additionally interesting and added much to the viewing experience. It's a movie worth watching still; some of it contrived, of course, but much of it filmed to be as historically accurate as possible, including the native languages, spoken without subtitles used (I liked that) and the various, authentic African music selections used in the soundtrack (enjoyed that, too).",1434499200,,703,4.940677966101695

246964,2,6300215849,"What a supremely boring film this is. The majority of the movie has Cornel Wilde running through the bush while being chased by a group of enraged Africans, with many nature cut scenes scattered throughout (might as well be watching The Wild Kingdom).

Wilde also directed the film, which accounts for his shamelessly using it as a vehicle ...for himself. Heck, we're even treated to Wilde letting off a big burp after devouring a snake! I suppose Wilde considered himself a hunk in the 60's, but his image has not aged well at all up to modern times.

Naturally we get the ubiquitous jungle drums sounding throughout, and we also get to experience a hellish blaze that has Wilde jumping about like a mad animal as his ""devil"" pursuers suffer . The acting - if we can call it that - is so abysmal, well they really didn't need a script.

One of the most tedious and poorly directed films that I've seen in a long, long time.",1431388800,,924,4.488095238095238

Cornell Wilde's vision is an exceptionally engaging bit of cinema with barely any dialog, a tale of survival, italicized by the glory of the African outback, in which the prey and the pursuers become one in the end, out of sheer tenacity and respect.

There is little I can add to the praise rightly heaped upon a classic movie, seldom ever given its due among the ""great"" movies, though it got a surprising recent reference in an April 29, 2012 episode of MAD MEN.  However, I must correct to small faux pas by the AMAZON Annotator: the tortured soul was encased in a mixture of clay and dung; and Cornell Wilde saves the life of a young girl, not a boy (though with her short-cropped hair it is an easy mistake to make); the fact that he puts a flower in her hair is something of a tell.

You see, whitey was with a bunch of white folks when they met up with an African tribe in Africa while they wuz out a huntin'. Whitey wanted to pay tribute to the tribe because he knew it was the right thing to do. He didn't want no trouble. Whitey's older white friend who bank rolled the safari said he wouldn't payin' nothin'. Whitey knew that wasn't right but that was his boss saying that and he had no choice but to walk on and not give the African tribe their propers.

Soon, the African tribe done went all crazy like on the white folks. Treatin' them like a rent a car and such. They was done mashed up like taters that been rolled over by a tractor tire! Whitey was spared by the leader of the tribe because he knew whitey was o.k. for a cracker. He wasn't going to let him off the hook. He was just givin' him a chance and a head start.

Whitey runs all over and up and down Africa! Meets up with all kinds of snakes and animals and such. Makes friends with an African boy that helps him out a bit. Ain't no vines for this Tarzan to swing from either. He's got to run and keep running until he can find some help!

247237,5,6300215849,"I saw this film in the late 60s at an art theater in Denver, when I was in my late teens. To this day it is one of the more remarkable films I've ever seen. Shot on location in Africa, one could categorize it as an action film, but it is so much more. Wilde starred and directed this gem of movie, and used little in the way of f/x. Sparse in dialogue, and much of that isn't in English, only enhances this film. The setting is late 19th century European colonial Africa. The hubris of the white European interlopers(""great white hunter"" types) on an ivory safari, proceed to slaughter an elephant herd, then refuse to pay the African tribal leaders whose territory they were hunting in. Wilde, who plays the head safari guide of the hunting party, strongly advises against not paying off the tribal leader because of the trouble it could incur. A warning ignored by the financier of the Dutch hunting party, and the on coming conflict is insured. The indigenous response, brutally horrifying, yet amazingly creative in the most macabre ways(for those of you old enough to remember the ""Mondo ..."" cultural films of the 60s, these may resonate similarly). After the hunting party, including its indigenous porters, is disposed in the most gruesome of fashions, the last remaining member, Wildes character, is to become sport for the tribes warriors. Stripped of All clothing, he is the ""Naked Prey"". He is given a head start to try to out distance the tribal warriors in what is expected to be a short sprint to slaughter. This all takes place within the first 30 minutes of the film. What happens after this makes for one of the most exciting viewing experiences to be had.

247243,5,6300215849,"Cornell Wilde was an active actor in the '50's and 60's.  He did a lot of (more or less) ham acting in the costume ""historical"" dramas current in that era.  ""The Naked Prey"", was his breakout film.  Not only was he the main character, he also directed.  The movie is a gritty tale (set in 19th Century Africa) of his pursuit by several Africans after he is captured by their tribe.  To honor him he is given ""the chance of a lion"" to flee, completely stripped, from a small group of tribesmen, rather than being ignominiously executed.  The movie is the story of that flight through horrendous conditions with eager killers behind him.  There is hardly any dialogue, but constant action.  The movie could stand up to anything made today and is wholly realistic.  It was the acme of his career and the movie is a gem.

247300,5,6300215849,"`A hundred years ago, Africa was a vast, dark unknown. Only a few explorers and missionaries, the ivory hunters and the infamous slave traders risked their lives on its blood-soaked trails. Gleaming tusks were the prize and sweating slaves, sold by their own kings and chiefs in the ceaseless tribal wars or seized by slavers. The lion and the leopard hunted savagely among the huge herds of game. And man, lacking the will to understand other men, became like the beasts, and their way of life was his.'

Cornel Wilde is `Man,' and Man is The Naked Prey. How tough is Cornel Wilde? Not only could he star in a film that sees him chased across a hostile environment by murderous tribesmen but could direct it as well in a primitive location in terrible conditions while seriously ill. While not the world's greatest actor he's the right physical presence for the part: there's something primal enough about him to convince as the kind of man who, when spattered with the blood of an enemy, just rubs it in rather than brushes it off. Indeed, Wilde was even planning to make a sequel decades later while dying of cancer.

Based on John Colter's escape from Blackfoot tribesmen during the Lewis and Clark expedition and originally intended as a Western before South African tax breaks prompted a change of locale, it's a simple story well told. Wilde is leading an ivory hunting safari that, thanks to callous employer Gert Van Der Berg, falls foul of Ken Gampu's tribesmen, who later attack them and deal out various imaginative tortures and deaths to all except Wilde, who shows no fear. Reasoning that because he looks like a lion, he deserves a lion's death, they give him a chance: stripped naked and completely unarmed, they'll give him a head start before chasing after him and killing him. Only their prey is far more resourceful than they imagine, and what was intended as a quick kill becomes a long manhunt through a savage landscape.

It's not a new story, even in 1966: the manhunt movie had been a sporadic staple since The Most Dangerous Game and the same true story it was based on had served as partial inspiration for Run of the Arrow ten years earlier while in more recent years its done service in First Blood and Apocalypto. Yet it's rarely been done this well. It's also surprisingly ahead of its time, anticipating Peckinpah in the village children play-acting each of the executions and, most surprisingly, avoiding much of the racial stereotyping of the day. The tribesmen aren't supermen - they run out of breath as well, get thirsty, argue among themselves and even want to go home. And while the tribe do delight in (probably) invented tortures, it's not without cause, and Wilde isn't that far removed from them. Allan Quatermain in all but name, the film clearly sets `Man' apart from his white business partner - he only kills for ivory, not for sport and isn't interested in going into the slave trade for easy money - and just before the attack, Wilde makes a direct link between Wilde's sense of hearing and Ken Gampu's sense of smell. Both men rely on their senses for survival, acutely aware of their surroundings in a story where it's survival not just of the fastest and the fittest but also the one who can adapt most to their environment - and their environment is not a pretty picture here. Its depiction of nature as a savage and unsentimental battlefield where its kill or be killed today seems like a pre-emptive two fingers to Terrence Malick's recent work

Pared down to the bone - there's no characterisation as such - and played in deep focus throughout, it may not be the greatest adventure film ever made, but it's a damn good one.

The extras on Criterion's DVD aren't that plentiful but are good: soundtrack cues, a reading of an account of John Coulter's real-life escape, original trailer, booklet including an interview with Wilde and a good audio commentary despite the odd mistake (The Most Dangerous Game wasn't made in 1936). The 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is especially good and, unlike the TV prints, the film is uncut.",1216944000,6,4078,4.738028169014084
247301,5,6300215849,"I loved this movie.  It's not perfect.  The scene where Wilde attacks the slavers is unrealistic Hollywood.  Otherwise the film is riveting.  I rather suspect the theme of being chased by savages who give you a fair start is taken directly from the account of the Mountain Man, Jim Coulter, in Yellowstone back in the early 1800's.  According to Coulter, he and a friend encountered Black Foot Indians.  Coulter's friend went for his weapon but was immediately pincushioned by the Indians.

Coulter, himself, was stripped naked.  An arrow was shot into the distance and Coulter was told he must go to the arrow but, once he got there. the Black Foot would pursue and kill him.  Coulter was a good runner but not as good as one of the Indians.  Coulter managed to kill him, ran further, then dove into a river and hid underneath a beaver lodge as the pursuing Indians--having lost his trail--poked around in the lodge in case he'd hidden there.  They gave up and Coulter escaped to tell his tale.

Although ""Naked Prey"" is Coulter's tale revisited, I'm doubtful that a naked white man, under similar circumstances, could survive in Africa.  The reason is thorns.  Yellowstone has few thorns.  Southern Africa has plenty.  One thorn in a naked foot and.....well....the rest would be history.  A naked man crippled by even one thorn would be quickly finished off.  It makes a good story, though.

247305,4,6300215849,"'the Naked Prey' is the story of one mans battle with the wild and the wilderness, with nothing but his wits as a weapon. Not a very complex plot, but it's simplicity is one of it's (many) major strengths. There's no secondary characters, no sub-plots, no asinine, pointless romances; just a visceral, survival-at-any-cost chase to the death, through the jungles and plains of undiscovered Africa.
Directed with some energy by former matinee idol, Cornel Wilde, 'NP' is a rugged, belligerent story of one mans will against apparently insurmountable odds.

Briefly, it's the tale of a safari leader, who, having seen his expedition ritually slaughtered by a delighted tribe, is given a chance for freedom. He's stripped and given a head - start before chosen warriors give chase, with the sole intention of running him through with eye-wateringly nasty spears.
To survive he must become as savage as his pursuers, and this is his greatest disadvantage - savagery comes natural to them.

It's not a perfect film. It's main flaw is the casting of Wilde himself as the lead. His is a suitably intense performance; not without vital humour, but, after a solid first hour, gives way to typical Hollywood cop-out. He rescue's a native child from some splendidly swarthy Arab type slave traders, and then is saved from a river by another child whom he befriends.
The film goes off at a complete tangent here, when it should press on to it's climax. He's the only person with any respect or understanding of the natives so it's hardly a turnabout when one of them helps him. It seems contrived to calm the film down a bit, lessen the impact of some of the brutality we've endured. To dampen the prevailing effect of the matter-of-fact death that we've been sickeningly exposed to.

The ending is a surprise, albeit with echoes of Rourke's Drift but again, it comes across as a mite forced; slightly studio induced. Or maybe they just couldn't think of one.
I expected some wonderful metaphor or paradox, some redemption, some hope for the future of the fighting human spirit. I got none of that. It's not particularly bad, it's just at odds with what's gone before.

A lot of what's gone before though, is simply magnificent. Potent, bloody savagery. People are burnt alive on spits, stabbed, slashed, fed to snakes, chained up, clubbed, coshed, slit, bitten, chased by lions and shot.
There's a lot of distressing animal death; inflicted by other animals in day-to-day survival contests, as well as the inexcusable smiling death dished out by Wilde's hunting party who slaughter whole families of elephants, young and old, for 'sport'.

The film has relentless pace, it plays like an acid-trip Tarzan adventure with gore and sadism. The soundtrack has tribal drums thumping and cracking, and it's effectively filmed. You get a good sense of the cloying heat (you could get a tan just watching it) and I've never seen Africa looking better in a film. (not even in 'King Solomons Mines' with Stewart 'mad sideburns' Granger (!) )

Like a reverse 'Walkabout' with testosterone instead of oestrogen; a burly male landscape despoiler, instead of divine earth-mother Jenny Agutter.

I first saw this movie when it was released in the mid 60's.
I was just a kid and it blew me away so much I went back and saw it several times on the big screen.  Over the years I occasionally even had dreams about it.  It was on TV about 15 years ago, but it was edited for TV with to many commercials.
Also, back in the 60's I happened to see Cornell Wilde on some talk show where he discussed making this movie.  He commented on how wild it was using the real deal tribesman as actors in the film.  Wilde commented about the scene where the tribesman throws a spear at him which nearly runs him through.  This event was not in the script and the native actor got carried away by the moment.  Watch the scene and you can see the real fear in his eyes.  Fantastic !! The expression on his face is priceless.

247359,5,6300215849,"OK - hokey title but THE NAKED PREY says it all.  I became aware of this film in the mid-70's and then only because it entered the realm of cable movies.  I had been aware of Wilde for some time, primarily for THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH but this film is clearly a labor of love.  Wilde with a sparing use of words conveys everything ""The Man"" (as his character is billed) is thinking in this film.  The film is rather predictable to begin with - white hunters dissrespect the natives and pay the price but when the hunters and baearers are dispatched in very imaginative fashions, this leaves only ""The Man"" to fend for himself.  At first it seems like ""no contest"" when Wilde is stripped of weapons and clothes and given a slight head start to outrun the village's best warriors; however, Wilde's character shows a resourcefulness borne of spending years in the bush.  There is basically no dialog after the chase begins and none is needed.  The payoff at the end is worth the ""ride"".

Wilde also directed BEACH RED which was an unflinching look at Pacific combat in WWII, but THE NAKED PREY remains my favorite.  It was only after seeing Mel Gibson's APOCOLYPTO that I appreciated Wilde's film even more since the second half of Gibson's film is basically THE NAKED PREY.  There are a few ""things"" that show this film was not a multi-million dollar production - specifically look for a white van crossing behind Wilde while he was in the ""bush"" - but for raw, effective story telling, this film can't be beat.  You really feel like you've endured almost as much as ""The Man"" has just by watching this film.  The fact that Wilde was in such great shape for a man in his fifties when he made this film shows his committment for realism.

247364,5,6300215849,". . . that someone released this outstanding film on DVD.  This film is, quite simply, one of the best adventure movies ever made.  The premise of the film is fairly simple.  A small group of safari hunters venture into the wilds of Africa and insult one of the local native tribes.  The tribe rounds up the safari, and kills each one of the members in a uniquely grizzly manner.  The final member of the safari, played by loin cloth wearing Cornel Wilde, is allowed to escape from the village with a small head start, and is then hunted by several of the warriors.  What follows is probably the best adventure/escape story ever put on film.  Can Wilde make it back to civilization?  He battles both the natives and the local wildlife on his trek through Africa.  Who will show more endurance and ingenuity?  The safari hunter or his pursuers?

There is so much to like about this movie.  The cinematography is great, the mood of the film is simple and subdued, the natives are treated with respect (not common with films set in Africa made during the 50s and 60s).  In fact, I don't think I can think of anything about this film I didn't like.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the Criterion release ==> overpriced, but this is a film that I'll gladly add to my collection at any reasonable price.  I'm a huge fan of the African/safari/hunting film genres in general (see my reviews of King Soloman's Mines, Peter Capstick Hunting Videos, etc.), but this is by far the best of all of these.  It is interesting that this 40 year old film was released on DVD a one month ago (as I'm writing this review), and there are already more than 50 other reviews, almost unanimously praising this film.  Definitely belongs in the collection of anyone intrigued by adventure or African/safari films.",1202342400,4,1801,4.578125
247365,4,6300215849,"A guy and his two companions are on a 19th century safari when they encounter something they weren't expecting.  Moments later, they get caught by a masochistic tribe of African torture experts.  Once there, they go through a court tribunal of sorts, where a hefty king mumbles something - presumably the method or torture/execution - and the prisoners then meet their fate.

Prisoner one gets strapped to the ground in front of a fire semi-circle...then a cobra is thrown into the mix.  Sure enough, the cobra avoids the fire and makes prisoner one's head a little hot with a strike to the cheek.

Prisoner two is mummified in the fetal position while attached to a large branch.  The only part left open is a breathing hole.  From there he's put on a campfire rotisserie and cooked well done.

Prisoner three, however, is the one with the interesting fate.  Basically, he's chased down by ten African warriors, and he races to his safety.  Without going into the details of good deal of bad acting, idiotic scenarios and decisions, and unrealistic action, here's the rundown of how the ""star"" of the movie makes his way to freedom.

Warrior 1: Spear to the gut - one would think that running straight towards a guy holding a spear straightforward would be a bad idea.
Warrior 2: Picks up Warrior 1, lasts until the end.
Warrior 3: Possible the most out of shape African warrior ever, he passes out from what appears to be about a mile of running.  He later joins the hunt again, but lasts until the end.
Warrior 4: This guy is a great tracker, but evidently def and stupid.  He dies from a spear to the back while being distracted by the old ""fake show behind a rock"" trick.
Warrior 5:  Absolutely no hand-to-hand combat skills for a ""warrior"" - knife chop to the head does him in.
Warrior 6:  In one of the worst choreographed fights in cinema history, this guy gets dirt thrown in his face, ostensibly blinding him, and allowing the star to give him a knife chop to the neck.
Warrior 7:  Pacifist deserter - gets a spear thrown through his torso from one of his fellow warriors; blood in, blood out.
Warrior 8:  Karma rears its ugly head, and this guy gets a cobra strike to the leg.  The others leave him to die in the African sun.
Warrior 9:  Meaningless cannon fodder, he's only there for the running.
Warrior 10: Shot by soldiers at some sort of French foreign legion post in the African wilderness.  And the fort is where our hero is saved, after days - maybe weeks - running in the African countryside, after being chased by ten warriors whose sole mission is to kill him.

A few odd things to look for during the movie, that make it hilariously enjoyable, are the following: the hero runs slower than a chubby, Nintendo-playing 12-year old, yet manages to get away; the Africans are much healthy, heavy, and in many cases a bit hefty - unlike most Africans; and finally, the constant jungle music, the most simplistic bongo drum soundtrack in history, is perpetual, and borderline irritating.",1202256000,2,3003,4.607142857142857
247366,5,6300215849,"Thank you, Criterion!  Now on DVD, THE raw story of survival in mid- nineteenth century Africa.  Cornel Wilde demonstrates his considerable acting talent and physical prowess against the backdrop of terrific settings and tribal communities - pitting himself against natural selection of a different kind.

When Wilde's character sets out with other 'great white hunters' as part of an ivory-gathering safari, he soon realizes that his not-so-savvy compatriots have made a mistake when they refuse to pay tribute to a tribe whose property they have crossed.  In slighting them, they have set themselves up for a particularly brutal penalty.  While most of the safari members are killed outright, the leaders are singled out for summary judgement.  One is actually cooked on a spit and one is placed in a pit with a cobra. Only Wilde's character manages to face a true test of endurance.

Reminiscent of the Old West ""run of the arrow"", Wilde is given a head start until he reaches a set distance - after which his able pursuers put him through the paces.  With the hunters determined to run him down and kill him, the pursuit takes us through many twists and turns as our hero manages to elude the relentless trackers.  In the interim, we receive the benefit of beautiful African scenery, magnificent animals, exotic tribal music, and a chase that is genuinely captivating.

Criterion has actually isolated the soundtrack - something that I kept on an old vinyl recording from many years ago.  This is a splendid film, particularly for anyone who really has a genuine zeal for Africa!",1202169600,3,1583,4.958333333333333
247397,4,6300215849,"Cornell Wilde's film isn't what I would call an unqualified success but there's a lot to admire here.  Wilde the director gets props for attempting a film that's essentially dialogue free, with the exception of Native African speeech that is unsubtitled, that asks us to follow a man for essentially 90 minutes running from his pursuers.  Fairly or unfairly, there is the potential for racial overtones because the pursued is white and his pursuers are black but I think that's purely incidental.  Regardless, imagine any studio today bankrolling this project.  The theme here is basically a survival of the fittest one.  Wilde's unnamed Man is captured by hostile natives.  The natives decide to make sport of their captive by stripping him of all amenities and giving him a head start before they easily dispatch of him.  What they don't count on is the man's resillience and it becomes a matter of pride for the pursuers to vanquish their foe.  The man not only has to deal with hostile pursuers but a harsh African landscape that contains venomous predators.  This film holds your interest for the most part but because of the somewhat repetitious nature of the film attention does occasionally sag.

247398,5,6300215849,"Cornel Wilde was a fascinating anomaly in Hollywood. He used the money from his numerous acting jobs to help bankroll his own personal projects that he would produce and direct. Wilde made only eight films but they are ones that once you see them, you never forget. The Naked Prey is one of these films - a two-fisted scathing attack on the white man's ruthless exploitation of the African continent - its people and resources.

The man spends most of the film on the run, picking off his attackers one at a time in a way that suggests that The Naked Prey might have had a profound influence on Mel Gibson's ode to survivalist cinema, Apocalypto. Wilde shoots his film with the same muscular economy as Sam Fuller, marrying pulpy subject matter with excellent craftsmanship.

Wilde presents an unflinchingly brutal depiction of this world, paralleling the violence man commits on one another with the violence between animals, mixing staged footage with actual footage of animals attacking and killing each other. Both types of footage are quite graphic, anticipating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bonnie-and-Clyde-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0010YVCI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bonnie and Clyde (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Bunch-The-Original-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000BT96CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, and seem visceral even by today's standards, let alone 1966. The Naked Prey is a powerful meditation on the nature of violence told in unsparing fashion while still working as an exciting genre film.

There is an audio commentary by film scholar Stephen Prince who talks about Wilde as an unfairly overlooked filmmaker whose film would influence future survivalist films like Apocalypto. He also takes a look at how the film works as a metaphor for the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s. Prince provides excellent analysis of the film and its place in `60s cinema.

""John Colter"" features actor Paul Giamatti reading a version of John Colter's Escape, the story that Wilde based his film on. It was originally the story of a trapper who escaped from a group of Blackfoot Indians. Lower shooting costs and tax breaks convinced Wilde to change the locale to South Africa and he changed the screenplay accordingly.

""Soundtrack"" features 18 tracks from the film's authentic African score complete with tribal chants recorded by Wilde and instrumental cues directed by ethnomusicologist Andrew Tracey.

247399,5,6300215849,"Dated now, but still very well done. Much of the film is without dialogue, none needed. The very definition of a chase film. How about that rocky field?",1200700800,,152,4.464285714285714
247400,5,6300215849,"Okay, so much for my weak attempt at humor. In all seriousness, this is a classic film which is likely to be different than anything you've viewed before. Originally to be set up as a contest between the North American Blackfoot Indians and John Colter in Wyoming, it was filmed in Africa instead for financial reasons. This was a real story in which Colter evaded his pursuers for 11 days in a run for Fort Raymond.

Basics of the (film) story are:

Group of white ivory hunters leave British fort with their native bearers in search of elephant tusks. I say to myself, ""self, this is another safari film.""

A hunting party (scouting party?) of local natives meet the safari and want gifts for their chief in exchange for passage through their lands. Safari guide, Cornel Wilde (the man), wants to oblige them, however the leader of the safari refuses, saying the goods he is carrying are for trading for ivory, not to be used as handouts to every native beggar who comes along and pushes the native leader aside. Big mistake.

White hunters find elephants and massacre the herd. The bearers are removing the tusks and some of the meat while the white hunters clean their weapons and relax around the campfire. Native hunting party has followed and is watching from the bushes.

Native party attacks the safari and, after a brief fight, captures or kills the safari. The surviving safari members are taken to the hunter's village where the jealously guarded goods for trade are pillaged by the locals under the grinning guise of the chief as the white hunters watch.

Native court is set up and each of the members is sentenced (to death in some gristly, unique fashion) by the chief among the cheers of the village. When at last Cornel is to be sentenced, the leader of the hunting party speaks briefly to the chief of his wanting to pay the tribute earlier. This earns the Man a chance to live.

The natives fire an arrow into the distance. The Man is stripped naked and set to run towards the arrow. A group of hunters are ready to pursue (one by one as each passes the arrow) when the Man reaches the arrow.

The first native hunter is off and pursues the Man, tossing his javelin and barely missing his target. The man takes up the javelin and kills the hunter ... taking his clothing, food and weapons. At this point the movie settles into the chase. A group of pissed off natives, expert hunters and trackers all, and the solitary white man. The man evades his tormentors through the chase, sometimes narrowly and eventually makes his way back to the British holding.

I venture to say that much of the success of the film was because it was shot in Africa. Had it held true to the actual chase in 1808 in America, it would be just one more Indian/white man movie. As it is, this is unique.

Shot with beautiful panoramic views of the landscape and interlaced with the day to day doings of the wildlife in the savannah, this film offers a magnificent view of the dark continent ... free of the common themes and cliches of other African stories. One will note that there is no Hollywood style background music in the movie at all. All background music is authentic African songs and drums. This lends authenticity to the film and contributes to its uniqueness. Dialogue is minimal after the initial safari sequence, consisting mainly of short conversations between members of the hunting group chasing the Man. Dialogue is in the native language (with no subtitles) so you can't understand the words, but the meaning of what is being said is very clear through expressions and gestures.

This is a gem of a film which will please anyone who enjoys the outdoorsy adventure kind of story presented. If you like stories about Africa, so much the better. I'm glad to see this finally released on DVD as the video is out of print, so choices were limited to finding a used copy of the tape or trying to catch the movie on TV. I have a worn copy I made from a television showing some twenty years ago and certainly welcome the crispness available on today's digital medium.

The film is not overly bloody (though there is a little), but might be disturbing to the younger set. I would think that most children seven and up can handle it without any dreams that night. Very young children will probably not know what's going on and will more than likely not be interested in the movie.

A very adult movie with an adult theme which I highly recommend.

Of course the fact that its a 60s film attracts me more because of style. Although it has all the elements that pull you in, it comes up a little short in the production area. Many of the wild animal jungle scenes are spliced in stock footage that detract from realism. I know this is somewhat typical of the era but it never the less exists.
  To my knowledge this movie has always been on VHS only: until now(and Criterion to boot). If you can overlook  old style film techniques you will enjoy the gripping mood of survival through the ever oppressing kill or be killed reality of a ravaging jungle. Without seeing the Criterion release yet I know they will clean the film up, but theres more to be said on that. The audio will be interesting to hear.
  The real important point is that Criterion and other companies are still behind the times as it refers to presentation. When is Criterion going to get onboard the HD train? Several years from now everything will be HD. Some buffs might claim that HD detracts from a pure filmlike look. When you see a good movie in HD though, it hard to hang on to your set in stone purest film concepts. Their may come a day when you will be buying The Naked Prey in HD. The issue of original artwork is also a problem. Why didn't Criterion use the very cool original movie poster artwork for the box cover? I see this game alot. Companies think their being creative by slapping a ""new look"" on the box to stir up a supposed ""wow"" presentation. This cover is nothing great. Criterion should stick to their early ideas as it relates to artwork. They have done this more then a few times now along with many other companies.

Shot with beautiful panoramic views of the landscape and interlaced with the day to day doings of the wildlife in the savannah, this film offers a magnificent view of the dark continent ... free of the common themes and cliches of other African stories. One will note that there is no Hollywood style background music in the movie at all. All background music is authentic African songs and drums. This lends authenticity to the film and contributes to its uniqueness. Dialogue is minimal after the initial safari sequence, consisting mainly of short conversations between members of the hunting group chasing the Man. Dialogue is in the native language (with no subtitles) so you can't understand the words, but the meaning of what is being said is very clear through expressions and gestures.

This is a gem of a film which will please anyone who enjoys the outdoorsy adventure kind of story presented. If you like stories about Africa, so much the better. Unfortunately, this has never been released on DVD and the video is out of print. So choices are limited to finding a used copy of the tape or trying to catch the movie on TV. I have a worn copy I made from a television showing some twenty years ago and would certainly welcome the crispness available on today's digital medium.

The film is not overly bloody (though there is a little), but might be disturbing to the younger set. I would think that most children seven and up can handle it without any dreams that night. Very young children will probably not know what's going on and will more than likely not be interested in the movie.

A very adult movie with an adult theme which I highly recommend.

This adventure film offers a respectful portrayal of African life with a guide (Wilde) on his last hunting safari with an arrogant group of white hunters. Insult turns to  ultimate and dramatic revenge as the insulted tribe acts to even the score in a barbaric and frightening fashion. You pity the ignorant whites as they suffer cruel and horrible death along with their African aides. In respect to Wilde, the tribe allows him a brave's death allowing him to run for his life with a head start with nothing but his bare skin. Wilde is followed by single tribesman staggered in pursuit but his initial success against his adversaries result in pursuit by a well armed platoon of tribesman led by an angry and possessed leader that will not stop. Filmed on location in Africa, Wilde plays the part realistically, almost in documentary style, virtually living the role as he eats what he can in this marathon pursuit. Portraying the harshness of African life in the mid 20th century, you can relate to the cruelty of Darfur today with a scene of Arabs raiding a peaceful village brutally making them slaves for sale. The film features non-stop excitement with a race to the death that reaches its climax, with all characters gasping for air, only at the very end of the film.

This all takes less than 15 minutes of the 96 minute running time and si you can tell this is a pretty fast paced picture and the movie is never less than gripping .

Taut construction and rapid pace are decided assets in any movie .Wilde was an ambitious director always striving for the slightly off kilter and novel approaches .In this movie he comes slightly unstuck for my money by a rigid and formulaic approach to the story .His direction sees him proceeding from the macroscopic to the microscopic in every scenr .We are shown the bush in longshot ,and then proceed to scenes showing the minutae of animal/insect life .The pattern for every scene is Repose/Flight/Sudden Death/Back to Repose .Wilde begins and ends scenes on shots of animals snaring their prey .To be fair some of the shots are striking but the pattern becomes predictable and the symbolism heavy handed and predictable

There is littile time for characterisation and the environmental and racial themes are not explored although the tribesmen are depicted as real and dignified people ,unusually for many movies of the era .

This is a ggod movie and well worth your time .Wilde is good in the role of Man and while I have been critical of some aspects of his directorial style he was a considerable movie maker who dared to be different and this a is a good example of his considerable talent behind and in front of the lens",1121040000,10,2138,4.61578947368421

I am always amazed with each viewing at how incredibly modern this movie appears even to this day, almost forty years after its theatrical release. What perhaps strikes me the most about this cinematic masterpiece are the realistic characterizations shown throughout the entire film of the native warriors who pursue Cornel Wilde's great white hunter, known simply as ""Man"". The intelligent story by Clint Johnston and Don Peters is surprisingly devoid of all the racial stereotypes seen so many times in earlier safari adventures. Rather than depicting the natives as bloodthirsty savages merely bent on killing white people for sport, the two writers (as well as director-star Wilde) wisely chose, instead, to present them to audiences as a proud people with a genuine conviction that their violent brand of justice against the intruders who violated their customs was proper punishment. Another plus that deserves mention is the use of African drums for the soundtrack, which not only blends perfectly well with the story's suspenseful atmosphere and exotic locations, but also enhances the realism and makes it far less dated than it would've seemed today had a traditional symphonic score been originally provided. THE NAKED PREY. You really have to see this one if you haven't yet. It is without a doubt one of the greatest films of its kind ever made, and sadly one of the most underrated as well. Nonetheless I am proud to say that it has always been one of my all-time favorites, and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to add something a little different to their video library, especially those who may have appreciated that other great survival adventure, JEREMIAH JOHNSON.

247551,5,6300215849,"This overlooked gem directed by and starring one-time Olympic fencer Cornel Wilde concerns a knowledgeable safari guide (known only as The Man) whose greedy client gets him into a slew of trouble when he refuses to pay tribute to a band of Zulus while hunting elephants in Africa.  The Zulus return en masse and take the white hunters prisoner, torturing them to death in a variety of ingenious ways.  Recognizing Wilde as being made of stouter stuff than his companions, they strip him naked and cut him loose with the intent of hunting him down.  But their generosity backfires when Wilde up and kills one of them.  What follows is one of the greatest pursuit movies of all time as the vengeful Zulu hunters chase the Man across the savannah in a race to reach a remote British fort.  The Man has to use every ounce of human ingenuity to stave off his relentless pursuers, as well as to contend with various random perils (pissed off wildlife, starvation, and slavers, to name a few).
This was filmed entirely in Africa and Wilde makes great use of the rich locales.  The hunt is juxtaposed at various times with real footage of animals contending with each other in the natural world, and there are some pretty memorable scenes here alone (including the snaring of a flying sparrow by a tree climbing viper!).  This is a 2:35:1 movie, but you?ll be hard pressed to see it that way.  I think there is a laserdisc, but no DVD.  If you can, catch it on AMC until they come out with a well-deserved DVD version, because the widescreen format is well-used here, serving to encompass a panorama of natural beauty.  Despite the primal savagery of the plot, and the at times brutal violence (not too brutal - this is the 60's after all), everything in this movie is quite beautiful, from the locations to the hundreds of native non-actors.
This is a great movie for an amateur filmmaker to study, as except for the beginning and one brief segment towards the end, there is almost no English dialogue.  This is a visually dynamic film reminiscent of a moving Frank Frazetta painting.  The humans are lean and sensual, and the action is high yield.  The earthen colors bring the viewer down to the basics, and the African singing and tumultuous heartbeat of the native drums make you want to put on your war face and go running through the bush.  The theme of man vs. man vs. nature plays out to the fullest, in an admirably simple and refreshingly honest way.
While the subject matter of a white man being able to hold his own against a group of native Africans on their own soil could be misconstrued as racist, I think the parting salute between Ken Gampu?s hunter and Wilde?s Man, as well as Man?s short friendship with an African boy who saves his life shows that the film?s heart is in the right place.  In the end, these men find mutual admiration in each other?s abilities, and the picture ends on a high note.  This is the pulpy sort of stuff that reminds one of yellowed Weird Tales covers with Robert E. Howard?s name emblazoned in red ink over some two fisted man?s man rippling with unbridled don?t-give-a-damn-but-I-can-take-a-punch grit.  Wilde got the idea from listening to an old radio drama about a trapper being hunted by Indians through the mountains of the northwest.

247553,5,6300215849,"Most films which have the basic premise of a white man battling native Africans somewhere in the Dark Continent usually portray these natives as nameless, unmotivated ugga-mugga tribesmen whose only purpose in life seems to be able to toss missionaries into a round cooking pot.  Thankfully, Cornel Wilde acts in and directs himself in THE NAKED PREY, a movie that is as astoundingly gripping as any film whose plot revolves around the hero's struggle for survival in a savage environment.
  Wilde is a guide whose safari of foolish white hunters antagonizes some ferocious natives, who proceed to kill the hunters in a variety of graphically nasty ways.  The natives allow Wilde a head start, then chase him.  It is this chase that forms the bulk of the movie.  Along the way, Wilde shows the natives (and the audience) that a near naked white man can still be a formidable foe.  The pursuing natives, led by Ken Gampu, are a diverse lot, not all of whom are as dedicated to the chase as he is.  They have numbers, food, knives.  Wilde has only his fierce determination to live.  What starts out as a standard chase movie, morphs quickly enough into another sort of chase.  This time, though, it is Wilde who starts calling the shots about who is chasing whom.  THE NAKED PREY is full of magnificent vignettes of survival on the African plain.  This is no jungle movie.  It is an engrossing film that allows the camera frequent panoramic sweeps over vast desert plains that are quite capable of supporting life if one only knows how.  The natives are astonished that Wilde's knowledge is at least as full as theirs.  Along the way, Wilde befriends a very young boy whose family was captured by Arabic slavers, and it is this boy whose very initial helplessness reminds Wilde that vulnerability is a trait that has the practical value of reminding one that arrogance on the plain is a negative survival characteristic.  The latter half of the movie is a continuing series of confrontations between Wilde and Gampu.  By the end, both the pursued and the pursuer recognize that sometimes the distinction between the two is a muddied affair at best, and the winner is not necessarily the one with a trophy, but with a recognition that all life, even the life of your enemy, has some value during a deadly game of chase.",1029283200,150,2316,4.718905472636816

7805900,5,6300215849,"Just a few thoughts of mine having seen this supreme adventure film many times in the past fifty years.  Cornel Wilde did an outstanding job of producing, directing, and starring, and deserves credit for including authentic African music by The Principal Warriors.  Photography by H.A.R. Thomson is fantastic.  In 1865, a rich nasty braggart, who shoots big and little elephants and intends to become a slaver, insults an African chief's son by refusing to pay a toll of trinkets for crossing the tribal territory, despite safari guide Wilde's warnings.  Later that day, the warriors attack the safari's campsite and bring the survivors back to the celebrating village for an imaginative variety of hair-raising torture and death.  The men, women, and children's gleeful enjoyment of these horrors makes the blood run cold.  A collection of the best warriors give the naked Wilde a head start before they come after him with spears.  Fortunately for him, Wilde knows how to survive in the wilds of Africa, what to eat on the run, and even how to start a fire barrier.  When he has to fight, he fights dirty, throwing dirt in his tracker's eyes, or stabbing them in the back.  Whatever it takes to kill another spear expert.  Along the way, we see innumerable instances of animals ambushing, killing, and eating other animals.  The message is clear:  out here in the jungle, there is no truce and no days off.  Wilde also witnesses slavers attacking a village and marching off a column of new slaves who communally sing a soulful song; the origins of that great music known as the Blues.  See the movie to find out if Wilde makes it back to safety.  There have been few adventure films as authentic, exciting, shocking, and fascinating as ""The Naked Prey,"" and Criterion Collection presents it in a first class edition with many extras.
