8529540,1,B008POPRHY,This is a horrible remake of rediculous vignettes.  It is a repackaging of horrible ufo examples.,1526083200,,97,5.0625
8529541,5,B008POPRHY,"Wow, this is the spirit realm and the things we don't see in the infrared spectrum. It's amazing and almost a little hard to believe, but try it for your self and you will see. There is a whole other world within our world.",1514505600,,223,4.090909090909091
8529542,1,B008POPRHY,"I'm not sure if this guy is for real, or if this was supposed to be a ""mockumentary"". Most of the ""UFO"" sightings are clearly airplanes. Now when I say clearly, I mean that you can see things like the red and green wing lights, the landing lights, the fuselage, the nose, and the engines. Other parts of the video ""evidence"" seem to be nothing more than pareidolia,  [...]
The ""orbs"" that they see are swirling dust particles and bugs illuminated by an infrared light. To be fair, they did manage to catch a couple of unusual things in the sky, but they're not worth $10 to see. Seriously, this movie is a joke. But if you want something to watch with some friends and have a good laugh, by all means buy this video.",1462147200,,716,4.303703703703704

8529544,5,B008POPRHY,The whole idea behind this film is pretty scary when you stop to think about it. I've watched some of the ghost exploration stuff on tv but this takes the cake. Whole new dimension to ghost hunting. Very impressed,1384041600,4,213,4.487179487179487
8529545,5,B008POPRHY,I'm always looking for fresh viewpoints on ufos and aliens. This dvd delivers and then some. I was pleasantly surprised and have watched it a couple of times.,1354579200,4,158,4.678571428571429
