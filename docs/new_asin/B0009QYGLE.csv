2313264,5,B0009QYGLE,"This exercise program gives you exercises to strengthen and tone all 52 facial muscles that are directly attached to the skin above them. The 20-minute program will work each muscle group as Judith Olivia leads you through a series of exercises to increase blood flow and oxygen to the surface of your skin.

The exercises help to erase worry lines, lift eyelids, give lips more fullness, erase lines on lips, eliminate a double chin, remove bags from under the eyes, eliminate crow's feet and tone the entire cheek area.

I found this DVD to be the best one I have tried and this is a copy of the original Face Aerobics video. The dramatic effects can be realized in as little as a few weeks. If you enjoy this DVD, you may also want to try Derma E skin care products to also tighten and tone the skin.

2313265,5,B0009QYGLE,It really works.  If you are consistent.  I love Olivia - she really make you work your face.  Her cream is excellent too.,1436832000,,122,4.217391304347826
2313266,5,B0009QYGLE,Easily to follow DVD.  Waiting to see results......,1436140800,,51,5.375
2313267,1,B0009QYGLE,"DVD is homemade. I would have no issue with this, except that the one I received is completely blank and does not contain the exercises. The person who made it slapped a label on it without checking to make sure they had actually burned the content to the DVD. I discovered this too late to get a refund (I was in the middle of a move and just now found the disc again) and there is no option availableto obtain a replacement so I have lost my money.

**UPDATE: I contacted Judith Olivia through her business site and explained what happened. She immediately offered to send me a replacement DVD and I am happy with her customer service at the very least.",1422748800,8,655,4.368852459016393
2313268,5,B0009QYGLE,Great results if you're faitful and commit to completing the recommended term. I consider this a very worthwhile purchase.,1422576000,,122,5.473684210526316

2313270,5,B0009QYGLE,"Five years later, found a picture of me before I started this 5 years ago, which I have done this and her part 2 now for 5 days a week and I do not look like the same woman, to say that the improvement is amazing is to be seen. I no longer have a double chin or sagging skin, everything is tighter looking and uplifted, I look younger now at almost 53 than I did then, I was utterly shocked and thrilled that all of this invested time has paid off. I made this my morning routine before I put my makeup on. You will not be disappointed with this routine.",1406592000,9,554,3.955357142857143
2313271,4,B0009QYGLE,The first set alone is much better than the second set.  The second set was made simply to sell another disc.,1395446400,,109,4.190476190476191
2313272,5,B0009QYGLE,"I have been using face aerobics for quite some time.  I believe it has really helped me firm up my face.  At 65, I need all the help I can get!!",1394064000,2,144,3.6129032258064515
2313273,4,B0009QYGLE,"I was skeptical - but decided to give this a try.  I was beginning to see the changes in my face from aging and I wanted to make it stop!!  I did this every day for two weeks and now and doing it Monday through Friday.  I can see and feel the results and I have actually had several people ask ""what's different about you?"" -- I like the workout but the video quality is pretty poor (recording of a recording?) so I lowered the rating by a star",1391990400,6,444,3.966292134831461
2313274,3,B0009QYGLE,The exercises are really good and effective. The voice of the woman (Judith Olivia) is very squeaky and loud.  I am not sure if I would recommend this DVD.,1385942400,,155,4.344827586206897
2313275,1,B0009QYGLE,This video is terrible. The exercises appear to be made up in the shower and have no basis in the physiology of the face muscles. Save your money.,1385856000,,146,4.25
2313276,2,B0009QYGLE,"This DVD's quality is low and contains only a few exercises with 20 min. total. Honestly, there are a couple of moves are pretty good and most of them are simply crab. Once you reviewed the DVD once, you do not want to watch it again. $20 way too over priced for this - I can get better from Youtube than this.",1375315200,,310,4.016129032258065
2313277,5,B0009QYGLE,"I was at a wake when a woman asked another: ""Is that your daughter!?"" The woman replied""No-she is 17""

Then this frustrated mother started staring at me in resentment: I felt so proud to have thia secret!  Thanks!",1370131200,2,213,4.578947368421052
2313278,5,B0009QYGLE,"Very good Born with cleft palate, lip and nose. I have had years of reconstructive surgery. At 51 I had pains in my muscles in my face some times. So excerciseing this muscles helps! I haven't had any pains since beginning this program. Plus the added bonus of a toned face to go with exercised body its great",1368921600,5,309,4.344827586206897
2313279,5,B0009QYGLE,It really works!  Have been using it on VHS for years and the tape broke.  DVD much easier to use.,1359936000,2,98,3.85
2313280,5,B0009QYGLE,"I have been using this tape for years because it is simple and quick to use.  Only 15 minutes
and your face looks refreshed.  If you do this tape consistently you will see improvements.

Folks say I still look the same from high school and I am now 60.",1358726400,5,252,4.1020408163265305
2313281,5,B0009QYGLE,"I've been doing Judith Olivia's facial exercises for 5 full years now and I can assure you they DO NOT cause wrinkles.  In fact, as long as you do them consistently, you'll be amazed at how fast your face perks up...and stays there!

This video is short (it's really only 15 minutes), easy to follow, and kind of fun do to. Although I'll warn you, some of the exercises look a little goofy, so you may want to do them in private. One of them requires sticking your fingers inside your mouth (I know...ew), so I always start with a clean face and clean hands.

It's also a good idea to work in front of a mirror to make sure you're doing the exercises correctly (VERY important!). What I do is sit on the floor with my back against the couch and place a makeup mirror on the coffee table right at eye level.  That way I can watch Judith on the TV and still pay attention to form.

If you're looking a little tired & droopy and want to DO something about it, then don't hesitate to purchase this DVD.  It not only helps prevent some of the signs of aging, but can actually correct them to a large degree. I still use it on a regular basis and consider it time well spent.

Thank you, Judith!",1358294400,8,1189,4.18859649122807
2313282,5,B0009QYGLE,"I have two other facial exercise videos and one book.  Because of the good reviews, I decided on this one (even though the picture is odd.)  I'm happy I did as it has exercises missed in the other products.  It is only 20 minutes but without a lot of wasted time.  I just got it but I think it will work... NOTE:  As with all of the other videos, no one mentions using face cream to keep face moisturized during the exercies... everyone should put on a good cream first. Highly recommend this video.",1350432000,7,499,4.26595744680851
2313283,2,B0009QYGLE,"I agree with another review, this DVD is a copy and it sticks, very aggravating. The workout itself is a good one but it is hard to do when the DVD sticks so much. If I still had the packaging I'd send it back. 2 stars because of the poor quality DVD. I'd give the workout a 5 though.",1325376000,7,284,3.830508474576271
2313284,5,B0009QYGLE,"This is very easy to follow. The exercises work. I just purchased the Advanced Face Aerobics. I've only used it a couple of times, but it seems great too. I like that the camera stays focused on her face, and there are no distractions or ""cute"" unnecessary moves. You can do the exercises quickly and get on with your life. Isn't that the point of exercise at home?",1323129600,16,365,4.382352941176471
2313285,3,B0009QYGLE,"First of all, this is a copy. It comes in a plastic CD case. This is not the original DVD, and for this reason I think it's overpriced.
On top of that, I was sent a defective DVD. After 10 minutes of watching I got ""Skipping over damaged area"". Then the program stopped responding. I will return it. 3 stars for the exercises I was able to watch.",1322870400,9,346,4.102941176470588
2313286,5,B0009QYGLE,"If  you're  one  of  us  women noticing your  face  surrendering  to  gravity, and not  in  a hurry to give up looking  your  best,  this  is  for  you. 16 minutes to  do the  program, and  it's  relaxing! this  could  be  your stress management  moment. I  do  tend to go like a bull at a gate, so I've had  the DVD  4  days; I've  done  the  program  twice a day for  4  days, the difference is remarkable. I'll probably do a week  at  twice a day, then a  week at  once  a  day, then  every second day. I  do  love  exercise though.
I'm 56 years old, have always looked young, but I had  noticed the  early signs of  aging in the  last  few  years. This  is  the  best  investment you could  make,  for  both  the  money and  the  time. Who  needs  plastic surgery?",1318550400,20,768,3.99290780141844
2313287,5,B0009QYGLE,"I happened upon Face Aerobics when it was in VHS, maybe 10 years ago.  I immediately responded to Judith and the exercises.  It is pleasant to follow her along and I saw very quick results.  When I wore out my VHS, I began searching for the DVD, and finally ran across one.  I don't do the exercises every day or with any real regularity, but when I start seeing my jowls dropping and the deep nose to lips line appearing, I get right back on the program.  In two or three days, I can see a huge difference and I am especially attentive when I have an event coming up and want to look especially good.  It has been a thrill for people to tell me over and over that I don't look old enough to be a grandmother of a 14 year old.  But I am! I'm 63!

I also love Callanetics (DVD) for my body and especially my waist.  Oh, and the upper arms firm right up! This is a short exercise routine that is easy to do, has fast results and doesn't stress the body.  I sometimes alternate days of Callanetics with exercises from the book ""8 MInutes in the Morning"", a routine that I discovered on Oprah at least 10 years ago and have not even been tempted to use any other exercise routines, or go to the Spa!

My face has benefitted amazingly from using Bare Minerals for about 10 years!  It is quick to apply, stays put, doesn't have to be washed off at night because it is ""pure"" nor does it come off on the pillow case.  I haven't used moisturizer during these years, yet my skin is soft and supple.

Well, those are some of my secrets for looking good, young and vital.  Thanks for reading.",1308528000,31,1581,4.154605263157895
2313288,5,B0009QYGLE,"I'm too chicken to have plastic surgery, and I don't have the money. I own a Time Machine but it's a hassle and time-consuming. I've tried the Facial Flex, which gave me vertical lines above my mouth and I don't smoke.  I'm not that old but the dreaded jowls were starting to appear - I think partly hereditary as I look like a young version of my grandmother.

So I thought, what the heck, I may as well buy this DVD and try it.  I was a little put off by the photo on the cover, it looks so 1980's.  I've been using this DVD every other night for the past 30 days and I can tell a difference.  Nothing major yet, but this sagging didn't appear overnight.  It takes 10 to 15 minutes and after doing the exercises a few times you don't need the DVD - once memorized, you can do the majority of them while driving if you want.  There are specific exercises for the jowl/puppet line area to help with sagging, as well as eye, forehead and saggy turkey neck exercises.

As an example, for the jowl area, a favorite of mine is this:  take your tongue and press it firmly against the inside of your cheek, hold for a few seconds, then do the other cheek the same way. Repeat several times. This exercise I feel almost immediately - and this one is easy to do while driving.",1307059200,51,1268,4.185185185185185

2313290,5,B0009QYGLE,"This was really a surprise because it works. The exercises feel pretty silly when you're doing them, a lot of strange grimaces...but my facial muscles really have bounced back into their younthful tightness...I applaud Judith.",1284681600,17,226,5.485714285714286
2313291,5,B0009QYGLE,I just love this product.  In a few weeks my face is tighter and looks alot younger.  I am so glad I purchased it.,1268179200,12,114,3.7083333333333335
2313292,5,B0009QYGLE,The well presented dvd and sample cream was way better than I expected.  I love the dvd and the cream is great too.  I would actually order a second video - thought I got a good deal on what I received and would recommend and buy as a gift for someone.  Bravo!,1266192000,8,260,3.9615384615384617
2313293,5,B0009QYGLE,"I always looked young for my age, but at 51 my face is starting to droop a bit. I got this DVD and I'm really impressed with the results. I know how exercise can tone the body, so the concept made complete sense to me, and it's true! You'll look years younger! And the lovely lady on the DVD isn't done justice by the horrid photograph showing in this ad. This must have been taken at the driver's license facility, lol.",1259280000,28,420,4.197530864197531

I had the VHS and now bought the DVD!
Other than the quality of video I can't see anything negative in it.

Another thing, I won't gift this to anyone...I don't want anyone to know what I do to look young and fresh!",1244764800,20,383,3.9740259740259742

8065409,5,B0009QYGLE,"I bought this as a VHS many years ago and loved it - it actually, truly works!

It's AMAZING.  BUY IT.",1465430400,,293,3.816666666666667

8065413,3,B0009QYGLE,"This DVD is just a little over 17 minutes long, including the short intro at the beginning.  I like that it doesn't waste any time with lengthy explanation, just gets right into the exercises with sufficient explanation during the workout, but for the price, I was expecting more.  The exercises seem effective (I can feel ""the burn"") but the ones for the forehead and eye area are the common ones that can be found through a short YouTube search. The ones for the lower face are a little different, and involve some holding exercises rather than repetitions. If you are an advanced facial exerciser, this will be too gentle for you - only 20 repetitions at the most, with a hold at the end. Still, it's a decent workout and I will include it in my rotation.

My DVD did not come in a proper DVD case, only in a thin, cheap CD case, the kind you can buy in bulk at Walmart.  The insert had very little information on it - it opens up but is blank inside.  So if quality is important to you, be prepared to lower your standards for this one.",1454025600,4,1040,4.312820512820513
