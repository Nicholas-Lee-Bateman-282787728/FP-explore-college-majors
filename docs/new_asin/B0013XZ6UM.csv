I'm glad I had commercials to go blow my nose and breathe for a few seconds!  Wonderful acting.  Kirstie Alley was amazing.  I can't wait for it to come out on dvd, even though it is the most emotionally exhausting movie I think I've ever seen.",1208304000,2,380,4.295774647887324

3120806,5,B0013XZ6UM,"Having had a ""retarded"" aunt who was loved and had been a part of my ""normal"" family, and who had an amazing sixth sense about her, I found this movie, and particularly Kirstie Alley, extremely moving. I will recommend this movie to others because it depicts that those who society dismiss as irrelevant or not worth anything, have hearts and minds like all of us and deserve to be treated much better. It's a movie worth watching if for no other reason, than to watch Kirstie Alley at her dramatic best!!!",1470096000,,506,4.571428571428571

3120829,5,B0013XZ6UM,"This movie started out very sad.  Its hard to believe but I know its true....how children who were different and had learning disabilities used to be treated.  Abandon by their parents and put in institutions to live out their lives, never learning or going to school because it was harder for them to learn.....  and so the story starts.

3120845,5,B0013XZ6UM,"Good movie and subject matter.  The movie tells a story about the struggle of this couple and the people that were institutionalized.  In my opinion, it showed the lack of compassion and understanding to treat this couple like humans, and provide the life skills tools needed to live independently.  Poor Margaret was so sheltered that she was unable to function independently of being institutionalized.",1446249600,,404,5.28125

3120849,5,B0013XZ6UM,"Kirstie Alley is fantastic in this movie!  I recommend this for everyone to see.  If I could rate it higher than 5 stars, I would.  People say that mentally- challenged people  can never live ""normally"".  So what is normal?  They may not be able to ""well-educated"" but they are more compassionate, more loving, more honest, and above all, more in touch with what the real world is not!

3120858,5,B0013XZ6UM,"I was looking for a good 'based on a true story' movie for my lifetime-a-thon with my girly girls. This hit the mark.

It sad that her struggles are true and makes you really look at people with disabilities more sympathetically. The story follows the life of a woman who is just trying to be 'normal' and live a regular life with the same rights as people that aren't challenged.

If you're looking for a movie that gives perspective, then you'll enjoy this movie. It made me laugh, cry, angry, sad, and happy all in one sitting. :)",1422144000,,533,4.428571428571429

3120862,5,B0013XZ6UM,"Great acting and story line.  We really enjoyed this selection..  Movies like this make you stand back to look at your own life and be thankful.  It, also, helps one understand the problems that others contend with and the trials that they experience on a daily basis. As I recall this is based on a true story.  We loved it and will see it again in the near  future.  Now you enjoy it!",1414886400,,386,4.219178082191781

3120865,5,B0013XZ6UM,"I hope the man who raped her has been arrested. Obviously he committed a murder as well.

It has been my experience that some people tend to do whatever they want to people with learning disabilities without compassion and they don't appear to get into any trouble. There was a fellow who was paralyzed, he wasn't learning disabled but was in the news a couple years ago. The neighborhood crime watch kept trying to have him picked up. Finally it made the news. The police said that from then on they would take the false reports with a grain of salt. Every time he went out, someone would call him in for various reasons when in fact he was doing nothing.

I was at the mall once and a guardian was there with a group of what appeared to be elementary aged learning disabled kids. I asked how they were doing and the guardian said all the kids there had been taken away from their parents. Maybe what happened to them was what was happening to the man who made the news but in their case the false reports were taken seriously as true without any basis and they ended up being taken away from their parents.. DCF policy is to take all reports as true and investigate them as true but they have no policy on what to do if they find out the reports are false. These false reports should be handed over to law enforcement for prosecution for bearing false witness, malicious prosecution is a crime.

Same for homeland security and the FBI or any other similar agency. If they get false reports and it is proven false they should turn it over and prosecute those people for bearing false witness, malicious prosecution is a crime.",1404950400,,1627,4.434782608695652
3120866,5,B0013XZ6UM,This book is an excellent portrayal of mentally challenged people. Kirstie Alley shows that she really can act and is not just a comedian type actress. This shows there are many many stages of challenged people and how much people really know about it. This is an excellent movie that could be shown to children to teach them about the difference and that people all deserve respect no matter what their challenge is.,1403481600,,417,4.726027397260274
3120867,5,B0013XZ6UM,"Absolutely loved this movie, it shows that disabled people can be just like us and have the same problems, I can watch it over and over and never get sick of it is is such a beautiful story!",1399852800,,190,4.026315789473684
3120868,5,B0013XZ6UM,"This film is just great. the actors although well they are known, you forget that they are acting.
I have a high functioning retarded adult. Kirstie Alley did such a fabulous job portraying
them. It also gives you insight into how so many children are just thrown  away without any hope.
this film gives joy, hope, tears and a marvelous presentation of what can be done for these adults when someone gives them a chance.
It was so good I er watched it with my husband. the surprise at the end is just wonderful.",1398816000,,511,4.4361702127659575
3120869,5,B0013XZ6UM,"I don't watch movies twice but ,I would absolutely watch this movie again and probably again. It shows that some people with special needs can make it in the world with the right people helping and guiding them. I hope this family has many wonderful years of happyness.",1392422400,,269,4.625
3120870,5,B0013XZ6UM,"This is a must see movie that proves that just because you have mental health issues, you cannot live the life you want to live. It is a blunt movie, showing the ups and downs, the negatives and positives, as well as how much some people need to fight for their happiness. It also shows that sometimes, those with mental health issues need more help and the shortcomings of social services. Overall however, it is inspiring and movie-this is coking from someone with their own mental health issues who fights daily for their own piece of a normal life as they define it.",1391644800,,570,4.543689320388349
3120871,5,B0013XZ6UM,I think this movie unfortunately goes pretty unrecognized. I think Kirstie Alley does a great job portraying a determined mentally challenged woman.,1390348800,,148,5.7727272727272725
3120872,4,B0013XZ6UM,"It took me a while to get engaged in the movie initially. Once I got past the beginning I was hooked. Impressive acting, heart warming and sometimes heart breaking scenes but so worth a viewing.",1389312000,,194,4.571428571428571
3120873,3,B0013XZ6UM,"This movie gives us a sometimes funny yet sobering picture of a part of society that we don't usually think about. It also leaves you thinking about your own norms. The actors/actresses do a good job of portraying their characters. I'm not going to classify this as a must see, but it was worth the price of admission.",1387238400,,318,4.5

3120875,5,B0013XZ6UM,I have always loved this movie because it proves that life isn't always fair but it is how a person deals with it. It teaches a good lesson in compassion to really look at a person on the inside not to be judgemental of their exterior.,1378771200,,235,4.130434782608695
3120876,5,B0013XZ6UM,"With my preference in movies being based on true stories, I found this to be a very thought provoking, sad & happy, all-around great one. I think Kirstie Alley is a very good actress and I wanted to see her in a 'different' role - she did NOT disappoint! Delroy Lindo was a great fit for this movie as well...I've seen him in many films but never knew his name- this time, I'll remember! If you'd like to enjoy an up-lifting and inspirational story - THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!",1378080000,,477,4.252747252747253
3120877,5,B0013XZ6UM,"No matter what capacity anyone is, they are human beings. As such should be treated, respected and have the rights and chances that all human beings have. I feel that Kirstie Alley and Delroy Lindo should have won an award for their acting and their choice to portray these people. NEVER MAKE FUN OF OR BE CRUEL TO ANY PERSON. You never know what can happen to you. Anyone can be disabled physically, emotionally and mentally at any time for a variety of reasons. NEVER JUDGE A PERSON, especially if you haven't walked a mile in their shoes.

In reality of today people can and are really mean to persons of any disability. They feel that they are better and that they should be extinct. They are all human beings with feelings. Its hard enough for someone that is disabled in some way to deal with their own affliction without having to deal with so many people who are cruel and mean to them. I was and still am shocked how many people are cruel out there.

Quote, "" Survival of the Fittest"". Think of this Quote in this way: Survival meaning; someone who has survived an ordeal and Fittest meaning; how you treat people, example; kindness, respect,etc.. If you think of this saying this way, I feel it will take you farther in life and ads to the Quality of Life you bring to others.

As I stated, YOU NEVER KNOW IT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU. Some people, especially children have a fear of someone with a disability and do not understand it. I highly recommend this film and I think it should be shown and talked about in schools. Better understanding through education.",1375833600,,1566,4.487719298245614
3120878,5,B0013XZ6UM,"THIS MOVIE, TO ME, WAS EXCELLENT.  IT HAD HEART. IT WAS EDUCATIONAL IN THAT IT HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED FACE, AND HOW THEY WERE TREATED, LESS THAN WHAT IS CONSIDERED a ""NORMAL"" HUMAN BEING. AS SERIOUS AS THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS, IT STILL HAD PARTS IN THIS MOVIE THAT MADE YOU LAUGH. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU SEE THIS MOVIE.  NOT ONLY DOES IT GET THE STORY OUT THERE, BUT THE ACTING (in my opinion) IS 'TOPS'.  THE MAIN MALE CHARACTER, DLROY LINDO WAS GREAT IN THIS ROLE, AND THE MAIN FEMALIE CHARACTER, KIRSTIE ALLEY WAS, AS USUAL, SUPERB.  I REALLY CAN'T SEE ANY OTHER ACTRESS DOING THAT ROLE BUT KIRSTIE.  I DON'T THINK THEY COULD HAVE 'pULLED IT OFF SO WELL'.  BUY THE MOVIE. YOU MIGHT ENJOY IT!

3120882,5,B0013XZ6UM,"This movie is a tough subject, but handled with such sensitivity that it is hard not to be interested. We don't use the word retarded to describe intellectually challenged people. We think somehow we are beyond that. But disability laws are recent, and the movie serves as a reminder of that, telling the story of a handful of residents abandoned in childhood at now closed institution. They take chances, wishing only to be, instead of what they were labeled previously; profoundly retarded... to a label of profoundly normal. And some, like Ms. Ally's character are successful, facing borderline functionality, but leaving this critic with a feeling that some of that is placed upon her by a cruel institution meant only to house, and not to improve the lives of those who were committed.

I knew Ms. Ally was somewhat of a successful actress, but I thought of her only as a comedienne. This was a tremendously smart performance. She should be profoundly credited in this role as an actress, and a human being with intelligence, love, sensitivity and depth. She performs with such passion that there is no clue that the smart, somewhat goofy person she's always portrayed lives in the same body as this honest, lovable, yet deeply disabled person she plays; struggling with all her soul to simply live a regular life. This is an important film for every person to watch, and and a reminder that the SAME human spirit exists in ALL of us, even though it can be quite hidden by disability... be it of mind or body.

I noticed it was a 2011 production and cannot believe it did not get any attention, so hope it does well here. Here's to you Ms. Ally. You are tremendously talented and giving, and many owe you thanks for your obvious hard work in making this movie, for those who are differently-abled, and for those who can help simply by opening their hearts and minds. This is a true story, making it all the more tender for it's telling.",1350604800,8,1941,4.6725146198830405

3120888,5,B0013XZ6UM,"I was getting ready for work one morning and caught part of this movie on TV.  As someone who works in the mental health field, I was intrigued by the acting in this and since I was unable to watch it in its entirety I searched for a copy of the movie on line.  I was not disappointed by this wonderfully depicted story.  Working in an outpatient clinic and with many people whose life stories are strikingly similar to this movie, I was amazed at the realism and the ability of this film to bring through what many today are confronted with.  This story truly tells it like it is from the viewpoint of many who are struggling against the odds to make it in the outside world.  Those who don't work in the field have no idea the strength and fortitude it takes for these people to succeed and this movie puts it right out front. Imagine the simple things--when you're told your whole life when to eat, when to get up, when to go to bed and then suddenly you're on your own.  Something the general public never thinks about, yet a scary proposition for many who convert from institutional living to being merged into the community. I plan to loan this movie to a number of co-workers who may not have seen it.  But I think this is a movie that those who DON'T work in the field should all see.  It might make them think twice before they snicker or call someone a ""retard"" or walk away when they could just as easily help someone feel welcome in a new environment.  I was particularly struck by the bus driver who simply ""forgot"" to call the McDonalds' stop.  So typical and so avoidable!  This film truly gives a realistic insight into a situation that happens in every neighborhood every day.  It's like the old saying about not understanding until you've walked in someone else's moccasins.",1311552000,,1792,4.429878048780488

In respect of this made for TV film, I suspect the original format was 4:3 fullscreen which makes the letterbox widescreen all the more unforgivable - they have simply cut the top and bottom off the full picture.

The film itself is good and portrayed a range of problems and triumphs faced by people with learning difficulties or institutionalised from a young age. Kirstie Alley is particularly impressive.

Being the mother of two handicapped children, I wanted to see how this was written and acted.  They couldn't have picked better people to play the parts of the couple portrayed in this movie then Kirstie and Delroy.  Outstanding acting, writing, and directing.  I was moved from beginning to end and cried as they were left at the institution to live; as they grew up and found friends; as they started jobs and had their ups and downs; and as they found each other and fell in love.

I was truly impressed how they handled the relationship between Kirstie and Delroy's characters.  Not only was this a bi-racial relationship (not something normal at that time), but they were both portrayed as mentally handicapped.  It was done with taste, consideration, respect, and love.

My hats off to the writer, producer, director and actors that took part in this made-for-tv movie.  This one needs to be seen on the BIG SCREEN by everyone.  It makes you realize that we are all created for a reason, whether we are a genius or profoundly normal.

I very much liked the format of the movie: interview, present time, adult past and childhood sequences.  I thought if flowed very well.  Kistie Alley, Delroy Lindo, Catherine Fitch Rosemary Dunsmore gave excellent performances.  If I did not know that Kirstie Allie had not been born ""mentally different"" then I would probably have assumed they had brought in an actual mentally different person to play this part.  She was astounding.

The story is touching and I was further inspired at the end to discover that the Thorton Family, including their son, who was born ""normal"" travels around the country to raise awareness about mentally different folks.

3355362,5,B0013XZ6UM,"I hope the man who raped her has been arrested. Obviously he committed a murder as well.

It has been my experience that some people tend to do whatever they want to people with learning disabilities without compassion and they don't appear to get into any trouble. There was a fellow who was paralyzed, he wasn't learning disabled but was in the news a couple years ago. The neighborhood crime watch kept trying to have him picked up. Finally it made the news. The police said that from then on they would take the false reports with a grain of salt. Every time he went out, someone would call him in for various reasons when in fact he was doing nothing.

I was at the mall once and a guardian was there with a group of what appeared to be elementary aged learning disabled kids. I asked how they were doing and the guardian said all the kids there had been taken away from their parents. Maybe what happened to them was what was happening to the man who made the news but in their case the false reports were taken seriously as true without any basis and they ended up being taken away from their parents.. DCF policy is to take all reports as true and investigate them as true but they have no policy on what to do if they find out the reports are false. These false reports should be handed over to law enforcement for prosecution for bearing false witness, malicious prosecution is a crime.

Same for homeland security and the FBI or any other similar agency. If they get false reports and it is proven false they should turn it over and prosecute those people for bearing false witness, malicious prosecution is a crime.",1404950400,,1627,4.434782608695652

3355372,5,B0013XZ6UM,I have always loved this movie because it proves that life isn't always fair but it is how a person deals with it. It teaches a good lesson in compassion to really look at a person on the inside not to be judgemental of their exterior.,1378771200,,235,4.130434782608695
3355373,5,B0013XZ6UM,"With my preference in movies being based on true stories, I found this to be a very thought provoking, sad & happy, all-around great one. I think Kirstie Alley is a very good actress and I wanted to see her in a 'different' role - she did NOT disappoint! Delroy Lindo was a great fit for this movie as well...I've seen him in many films but never knew his name- this time, I'll remember! If you'd like to enjoy an up-lifting and inspirational story - THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!",1378080000,,477,4.252747252747253
3355374,5,B0013XZ6UM,"No matter what capacity anyone is, they are human beings. As such should be treated, respected and have the rights and chances that all human beings have. I feel that Kirstie Alley and Delroy Lindo should have won an award for their acting and their choice to portray these people. NEVER MAKE FUN OF OR BE CRUEL TO ANY PERSON. You never know what can happen to you. Anyone can be disabled physically, emotionally and mentally at any time for a variety of reasons. NEVER JUDGE A PERSON, especially if you haven't walked a mile in their shoes.

In reality of today people can and are really mean to persons of any disability. They feel that they are better and that they should be extinct. They are all human beings with feelings. Its hard enough for someone that is disabled in some way to deal with their own affliction without having to deal with so many people who are cruel and mean to them. I was and still am shocked how many people are cruel out there.

Quote, "" Survival of the Fittest"". Think of this Quote in this way: Survival meaning; someone who has survived an ordeal and Fittest meaning; how you treat people, example; kindness, respect,etc.. If you think of this saying this way, I feel it will take you farther in life and ads to the Quality of Life you bring to others.

As I stated, YOU NEVER KNOW IT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU. Some people, especially children have a fear of someone with a disability and do not understand it. I highly recommend this film and I think it should be shown and talked about in schools. Better understanding through education.",1375833600,,1566,4.487719298245614
3355375,5,B0013XZ6UM,"THIS MOVIE, TO ME, WAS EXCELLENT.  IT HAD HEART. IT WAS EDUCATIONAL IN THAT IT HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED FACE, AND HOW THEY WERE TREATED, LESS THAN WHAT IS CONSIDERED a ""NORMAL"" HUMAN BEING. AS SERIOUS AS THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS, IT STILL HAD PARTS IN THIS MOVIE THAT MADE YOU LAUGH. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU SEE THIS MOVIE.  NOT ONLY DOES IT GET THE STORY OUT THERE, BUT THE ACTING (in my opinion) IS 'TOPS'.  THE MAIN MALE CHARACTER, DLROY LINDO WAS GREAT IN THIS ROLE, AND THE MAIN FEMALIE CHARACTER, KIRSTIE ALLEY WAS, AS USUAL, SUPERB.  I REALLY CAN'T SEE ANY OTHER ACTRESS DOING THAT ROLE BUT KIRSTIE.  I DON'T THINK THEY COULD HAVE 'pULLED IT OFF SO WELL'.  BUY THE MOVIE. YOU MIGHT ENJOY IT!

3355379,5,B0013XZ6UM,"This movie is a tough subject, but handled with such sensitivity that it is hard not to be interested. We don't use the word retarded to describe intellectually challenged people. We think somehow we are beyond that. But disability laws are recent, and the movie serves as a reminder of that, telling the story of a handful of residents abandoned in childhood at now closed institution. They take chances, wishing only to be, instead of what they were labeled previously; profoundly retarded... to a label of profoundly normal. And some, like Ms. Ally's character are successful, facing borderline functionality, but leaving this critic with a feeling that some of that is placed upon her by a cruel institution meant only to house, and not to improve the lives of those who were committed.

I knew Ms. Ally was somewhat of a successful actress, but I thought of her only as a comedienne. This was a tremendously smart performance. She should be profoundly credited in this role as an actress, and a human being with intelligence, love, sensitivity and depth. She performs with such passion that there is no clue that the smart, somewhat goofy person she's always portrayed lives in the same body as this honest, lovable, yet deeply disabled person she plays; struggling with all her soul to simply live a regular life. This is an important film for every person to watch, and and a reminder that the SAME human spirit exists in ALL of us, even though it can be quite hidden by disability... be it of mind or body.

I noticed it was a 2011 production and cannot believe it did not get any attention, so hope it does well here. Here's to you Ms. Ally. You are tremendously talented and giving, and many owe you thanks for your obvious hard work in making this movie, for those who are differently-abled, and for those who can help simply by opening their hearts and minds. This is a true story, making it all the more tender for it's telling.",1350604800,8,1941,4.6725146198830405

3355385,5,B0013XZ6UM,"I was getting ready for work one morning and caught part of this movie on TV.  As someone who works in the mental health field, I was intrigued by the acting in this and since I was unable to watch it in its entirety I searched for a copy of the movie on line.  I was not disappointed by this wonderfully depicted story.  Working in an outpatient clinic and with many people whose life stories are strikingly similar to this movie, I was amazed at the realism and the ability of this film to bring through what many today are confronted with.  This story truly tells it like it is from the viewpoint of many who are struggling against the odds to make it in the outside world.  Those who don't work in the field have no idea the strength and fortitude it takes for these people to succeed and this movie puts it right out front. Imagine the simple things--when you're told your whole life when to eat, when to get up, when to go to bed and then suddenly you're on your own.  Something the general public never thinks about, yet a scary proposition for many who convert from institutional living to being merged into the community. I plan to loan this movie to a number of co-workers who may not have seen it.  But I think this is a movie that those who DON'T work in the field should all see.  It might make them think twice before they snicker or call someone a ""retard"" or walk away when they could just as easily help someone feel welcome in a new environment.  I was particularly struck by the bus driver who simply ""forgot"" to call the McDonalds' stop.  So typical and so avoidable!  This film truly gives a realistic insight into a situation that happens in every neighborhood every day.  It's like the old saying about not understanding until you've walked in someone else's moccasins.",1311552000,,1792,4.429878048780488

In respect of this made for TV film, I suspect the original format was 4:3 fullscreen which makes the letterbox widescreen all the more unforgivable - they have simply cut the top and bottom off the full picture.

The film itself is good and portrayed a range of problems and triumphs faced by people with learning difficulties or institutionalised from a young age. Kirstie Alley is particularly impressive.

So, good film, DVD could and should have been better.",1238112000,,640,4.916666666666667

Being the mother of two handicapped children, I wanted to see how this was written and acted.  They couldn't have picked better people to play the parts of the couple portrayed in this movie then Kirstie and Delroy.  Outstanding acting, writing, and directing.  I was moved from beginning to end and cried as they were left at the institution to live; as they grew up and found friends; as they started jobs and had their ups and downs; and as they found each other and fell in love.

I was truly impressed how they handled the relationship between Kirstie and Delroy's characters.  Not only was this a bi-racial relationship (not something normal at that time), but they were both portrayed as mentally handicapped.  It was done with taste, consideration, respect, and love.

My hats off to the writer, producer, director and actors that took part in this made-for-tv movie.  This one needs to be seen on the BIG SCREEN by everyone.  It makes you realize that we are all created for a reason, whether we are a genius or profoundly normal.

If you want to see a movie that is clean, decent, and wonderfully acted, watch this one!!  You'll be glad you did ... and feel good about it!",1219881600,3,1373,4.396825396825397

I very much liked the format of the movie: interview, present time, adult past and childhood sequences.  I thought if flowed very well.  Kistie Alley, Delroy Lindo, Catherine Fitch Rosemary Dunsmore gave excellent performances.  If I did not know that Kirstie Allie had not been born ""mentally different"" then I would probably have assumed they had brought in an actual mentally different person to play this part.  She was astounding.

The story is touching and I was further inspired at the end to discover that the Thorton Family, including their son, who was born ""normal"" travels around the country to raise awareness about mentally different folks.
