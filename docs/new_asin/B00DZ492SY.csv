5880028,5,B00DZ492SY,Delon is at his best; the plot is very good taking just the right amount of time to develop the characters. It is a pleasure to watch the twists and turns of the plot. Well worth buying and watching,1391040000,3,198,4.102564102564102
5880029,3,B00DZ492SY,"I loved the 1st series but the 2nd runs out of steam, with a ridiculous (and poorly acted) subplot. But, Delon is great.",1389398400,,120,4.260869565217392
5880030,2,B00DZ492SY,"This really is a pretty miserable effort: thoroughly derivative plots, bad writing, acting barely above the soap opera level, woefully unskillful direction and cutting of scenes.  It seems to be little more than a vehicle for the aging Delon, who essentially walks through his role, sleeping with two women about 40 years his junior and with an obvious opportunity to sleep with two others roughly the same age.  One can't help but be amused by the credits at the end of each film, which list no fewer than 8 separate assistants to Monsieur Delon.",1387411200,4,547,4.808510638297872

5880032,5,B00DZ492SY,"First-rate, off-beat cop show.  Each of the six episodes is a full-length film. Delon's craggy face and sad eyes speak volumes. Most of the characters are Sicilian Mafiosi living in Paris.",1384819200,,188,5.064516129032258
5880033,5,B00DZ492SY,Riveting detective series with excellent plot lines and wonderful characters.  Alain Delon is perfect for the part and of course as usual is his appealing self.  The other characters in the story are woven well into the story and I highly recommend the series for those who like good detective stories withou too much gore.,1382918400,6,323,4.8545454545454545
5880034,3,B00DZ492SY,"I've now watched 4 episodes. I am bored. There is so much of repetition, indicating, poor directing, boring plot. There is just nothing to make me want to watch more.

Frank Riva, with his blank, withholding style, is the boringest. His look is almost always the same. We never or rarely get what is going on in his mind or life behind his goings on with his team.

As I am writing this, having just finished the fourth of six long episodes, I am deciding to leave the rest alone and find it's a relief. The fact that it is ten years old is no excuse.",1381536000,4,551,4.188679245283019

An excellent series that was off to a dubious start but caught the early stumble and roared back with well fleshed characters, a sound and plausable
story line. Better that very good direction and competent production.
Mmm. Mmm. GOOD!
Bring Frank Riva back.
By the way, M.Delon should be ashamed of looking so Damned good at his age. Gives the rest of us geezers a bad name.
Get it. You will enjoy. A LOT!",1378598400,25,432,4.481012658227848

5880044,5,B00DZ492SY,"It is amazing what a difference it makes having a genuine star heading the cast. It is undeniably Alain Delons star power that gives FRANK RIVA its gravitas.

One of the most enjoyable cop shows to come along in awhile, all six episodes of this outstanding mini-series are extremely well done. There are a number of clever twists and turns but the real distinguishing element is Delon. Looking world-weary and truly like an exile (Riva went into hiding 25 years ago after having infiltrated the highest levels of organized crime). Delons acting is effortless and he just lets everyone else come to him. There is a scene in the last episode, when Delon as Riva is on the run, having been falsely accused of murder. Of course his closest friends and co-workers in the police seek to help him clear his name and wind up meeting him in a pool hall. They enter as one, drawn to the super-cool Riva, sitting nonchalantly on the edge of a pool table. It is moments like this that cannot be acted, they simply are, and only a true star can make it work.

The casting sessions for FRANK RIVA must have been something to beholdall the women in this mini-series are gorgeous. At the top of the list, in this reviewers opinion, is Sophie Von Kessler as Rivas immediate boss Superintendent Lydie Herzog. Being a beautiful professional in her mid-thirties makes Lydie quite the catch, but she immediately sets her sights on Riva. Were he played by almost any other actor this would seem foolish, but Delonin his late sixties when this was filmed in 2003is wholly believable as the object of her interest.

FRANK RIVA is one of those programs that you want to watch back to back right through, but to do so is to forgo the experience of savouring each episode. This high-quality cop show breathes new life into the genre, again predominantly because of Delons presence. He also co-produced the program so credit must fall to him for the overall production as well as his central performance.

In an era when anti-heroes and mavericks continue to rule the law and order roost, Delons Frank Riva stands out. Described as existing in a grey area Riva is, in fact, very black and white. His integrity and sense of right and wrong is like a core of steel. He is a true traditional hero in this sense, and that is why he is so compelling to watch. Hes also deeply sensitive and his openness to showing affection not only to his friends but to babies and even his cat, make him even more likeable. He doesnt have to be tough, he just is.

His 25 years away from the game may mean he has to shake off some rust, but Frank Riva lives and breathes his job. Youll be following him every step of the way.",1397433600,7,2677,4.511340206185567
5880045,2,B00DZ492SY,"My wife and I have been on a bit of a run with Nordic Noir dramas. I'd stumbled upon this while searching around and bought it because I knew my wife used to love Alain Delon.

We really wanted to like this series but we just couldn't. Some strange decisions were made to make this like some 80's detective production. When the sultry sax started playing all the time, we knew we were in the wrong place with this series.

There's an interesting mobster versus cop story here but between that sax and some rather stilted acting we barely made it past the first episode before just giving up. Plus, there's an actress speaking English but dubbed over in French which drove me crazy (I hate dubbing). You'd think there are plenty of female actresses in France that could be part of this production.

It's a shame because there are some great actors involved. Jacques Perrin, Philippe Leroy, and of course Alain Delon. There was a lot of potential but in the end, it just felt flat, like someone wanted to just give it a try but without really trying to make a great series. Instead, they just wanted to bring some famous French actors together and have fun making a series.

It's a personal opinion so take it with a grain of salt but I can't recommend this series.",1393459200,6,1263,4.478260869565218

5880047,1,B00DZ492SY,"Alan Delon, who was the most gorgeous Frenchman on the planet, has aged. Not well. His face has gone south to gather in folds under his chin. The plot here is the old chestnut: a retired ace detective called back after 25 years to solve the murder of his brother, a police chief. He has to work with the police chief's staff, who noisily consider him past it. But he still has a few tricks to teach the young turks.  And women from literally three different generations fall for his charms.  Eh. I wish I didn't pay for this dvd.",1392336000,2,529,4.28

8599409,5,B00DZ492SY,"With few exceptions I find mob-based dramas, especially American ones, to be utterly dull.  This is an exception, and it is French.  The supporting actors help the main character Riva come to life.  Bigger than life perhaps, but that works with the plot, which has a few unexpected but not far-fetched twists.  Also, the series comes to a natural conclusion.  Bravo to the producers for not prolonging its life artificially beyond that point, like many series do (like Downton Abbey after the extraordinarily good first two seasons).",1451779200,,533,5.080459770114943
8599410,5,B00DZ492SY,"In ""Frank Riva"" (The Complete Series 2003 - 04), Alain Delon was back in old form and style! Alain Delon is hard-nosed detective 'Frank Riva', who has been brought back 25 years after he was exiled/disappeared and, presumed dead by his enemies in the ""underworld"". It seems that he is now needed to investigate the apparent set-up and murder of his own brother and, an apparent band of infiltrators/collaborators within the Police Dept. itself. Watch as 'Frank Riva' evens the score, his own way!

Alain Delon was basically reviving some of his past incarnations as ""tough cop""---i.e. ""Un flic"" 1972, ""Flic Story"" 1975, ""Pour la peau d'un flic"" 1981, etc.---so it wasn't much of a stretch in terms of character; he was cool and tough as ever, even at the tender age of 67 (man, I hope I can look as good as this guy at that age)! The supporting cast were all very good: Jacques Perrin, Sophie Von Kessel, Cdric Chevalme, Mireille Darc, Elsa Kikone, Franois Vincentelli, Luis Marqus, etc. Six episodes in all. You won't be disappointed, I highly recommend it, especially for fans of Alain Delon. The DVD (3 DVD set) picture and sound quality is excellent. NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 552 mins.

Love and Peace,
