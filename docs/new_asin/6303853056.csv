7853359,3,6303853056,"THE COURTYARD is a made for Showtime movie that has some good moments but ultimately ends up muddled and far-fetched in its conclusion.  It opens with a love scene between a man and a woman in the middle of the night.  He gives her an i.d. bracelet as a gift, and she discovers someone else's name on it.  Next thing we see is the bracelet floating in the apartment complex's fountain.  Enter Andrew McCarthy as a promising young architect who is moving to California to close the deal on a new super mall.  He rents an apartment in the same complex, which is managed by the ubiquitous Vincent Schiavelli as a Russian named Ivan (E-vahn, not I-van.).  McCarthy discovers the bracelet and runs into a young woman who claims it--we know it's the woman we met in the beginning.  How this ties into the movie comes much later.  McCarthy sets things in motion when he mistakenly sets up a young drug dealer to be the victim of a murderer.  This is where the plot takes some twisty turns, and granted there are some moments of genuine surprise.  Just who is Madchen Amick, besides the sister of the murdered drug dealer?  And why is McCarthy's chummy neighbor David Packer so strange?  Not to mention Bonnie Bartlett as a former teacher?  Add a subdued Cheech Marin as a police detective, and you're ready to trudge through the conveyances of a muddled and murky denouement.

The cast tries hard and the production values are good, so it's not a bad movie, just nothing really special about it.",1097193600,,1488,4.587121212121212
