2670320,4,B000JD8CKI,"This is a good video for someone who has never field dressed or processed a deer. At first you might be disappointed because you can tell this was done by an amateur film producer and not a professional studio.  However, in my opinion this adds to the character of the film. It is a little frustrating at times because Phil (the host) blocks the camera or the sound might go out for a few seconds, but nothing important is lost. Phil shows step-by-step how to properly field dress the deer, the tools you'll need to do the job, things to think about if you want to mount the deer or tan the hide, and then he even shows how to make jerky. It's nearly 2 1/2 hours long! I would highly recommend this video for anyone who has never dressed a deer and doesn't have someone to show them the correct technique.",1166313600,2,805,4.296052631578948

8150060,1,B000JD8CKI,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was disappointed.  The video did have some things that my husband thought he could use but it was not what he expected at all.  He commented that it was such an armature production that many times the video was to dark or someone would be standing right in front of the person working so you could not see exactly what they were doing.,1357776000,,385,4.260273972602739
8150061,3,B000JD8CKI,"It is what it is. Budget instructional vid on field dressing. I got this for a less experienced friend and viewed it before giving it to him. It's a useful video for sure. Some things are performed different than the way I'd do it but always good to see others techniques. Could have been a bit more extensive on in the field techniques for field dressing bucks on the ground. Several scenarios of dealing with the pelvic region, rectum and bladder. Stuff that usually is problematic for first timers.",1306627200,,501,4.640449438202247
8150062,4,B000JD8CKI,"I gave this an extra star just for the guy being a true entrepreneur and getting his video camera out to make a homemade ""how to"" video. I thought they did extremely well.

My biggest complaint about this video is that they could have done the field dressing during the day time or at least with better lighting than what the camcorder had. They could have also payed more attention to the shot angles. There were a few other annoying things as well. But like I said it is a homemade video and I thought it was done well for that reason.

I enjoyed the video and would probably purchase this again. I have not watched any other videos on this subject so I cannot compare it to another, possibly professionally done, video.",1287360000,,722,4.421052631578948
8150063,4,B000JD8CKI,"Very well-done ""home"" style visual aid for learning how to field dress a deer.  This guy is a country boy who doesn't put on any pretenses.",1250467200,,139,4.346153846153846
8150064,4,B000JD8CKI,"at first i was like ""oh crap, this looks like it's homemade"", but after watching it it proved to be extremely informative and in depth. my favorite part was when the guy shows off his electric bone saw.",1231459200,,202,4.342105263157895
8150065,3,B000JD8CKI,"This video is interesting enough, but they only show one FIELD dressing and it is at night and poorly filmed.  The whole reason I bought the video was for the field dressing segments.  I thought they would show it four different times since it advertises 4 hunts-4 kills.  They gut a second deer but it is not on the field, and it's hoisted on a gambrel.

The narrator may be an experienced hunter but he is almost unbearable to watch in this film.  He rambles on, overly repeats himself, and speaks in a monotone voice.  To be honest, it was so bad, I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole video.

I gave it three stars because it has some interesting segments (if you can get past the rambling) and it was fairly inexpensive.",1197331200,3,730,4.402985074626866
8150066,5,B000JD8CKI,"This is the best after the shot video I have ever seen.  I have been hunting since I was big enough to fire a weapon big enough to drop a whitetail in the great state of Ky.  Been cleaning them since before that with the knowledge of dad.  But this video is a good refresh for hunters of all levels.  I would highly, Highly, HIGHLY recommend this video. A+ on the overall product provided in this video.",1193616000,2,403,4.194805194805195
8150067,5,B000JD8CKI,"Its a great dvd if you haven't dressed deer in a while or just interested in learning or picking up some new techniques.  It is very well narrated and explained.  Also shows you how proffesionals do it, also interesting to learn.  Overall, one of the best on the market.",1178582400,,270,4.469387755102041
8150068,5,B000JD8CKI,"This video was not produced with a large expense account and that is what makes it as great as it is.  It is made by somebody who has had much experience in the field and is more than willing to share their knowledge with everyone.  There are many techniques that are extremely helpful; some of which I had never experience before.  Good luck, good hunting, be safe, and most of all, God bless.",1167868800,3,394,4.36986301369863
