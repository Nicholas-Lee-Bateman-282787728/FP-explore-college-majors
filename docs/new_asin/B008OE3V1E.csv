8529300,5,B008OE3V1E,This is how I know this show is great. anytime you can watch a anime show in japenese without ever seeing it dubbed thats how you know its a great show! I only watched one episode online and half of episode 2 and I love it this show so far and they haven't even got into a plot. Idk if im gonna pay 60 dollars for a all japenese language show but hey I just mite this show is pretty good and yes it is better than fairy tail at least. hahaha imagine if it was in english this show would be epic.,1347408000,,495,3.8155339805825244
