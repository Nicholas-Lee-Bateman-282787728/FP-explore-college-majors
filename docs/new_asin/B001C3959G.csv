8285720,1,B001C3959G,"Having just come across this movie on cable by chance we gave it a shot, in lack of any better option expecting a drama with a comedy twist as was advertised. Never had we imagined we would be faced with a Woody Allen (without the humor and wit) meets Eyes Wide Shut (without the sensuality but with amble weirdness).

It depicts a woman craving for the attention from her husband, who is totally bizarre and without a clue what she is lacking. Surely not infrequent sentiments in relationships. She is longing for sensuality and sensitivity (personified in her dreams as a fluffy golden retriever) and he  merely longs for more sex.

The two reasonably well known actors play the roles exactly as seems to be intended but it is doubtful either of their characters would resonate much with any even grossly bizarre people among us? In fact all this movie left us with was brief contemplation as to whether to get a second dog - perhaps a golden retriever?

If any of you Freudians manage to sit through movie in its entirety would you be so kind to add your perspective on this movie and why anyone should see it least to say would finance it.",1218412800,2,1143,4.533980582524272
