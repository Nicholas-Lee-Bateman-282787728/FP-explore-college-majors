8303469,5,B001G0MFRE,"Fantastic show!!!  From the fashion, style, attitude, music, spirit, product placement, etc. the attention to the '70s detail in this show is superb.  There are so many choices for the characters and plots that this series could grow into.  I hope an industry insider is smart enough to realize that this show needs to be picked up for a second season.  I think it is well written, directed, acted and produced.  As it was said in the 1970s...""Have A Nice Day""!",1231027200,12,461,4.6419753086419755
8303470,5,B001G0MFRE,"This is one of those Loves it or Hates it shows, no middle of the road. If you've never seen it , watch it. If you love it write CBS and petition to keep it. If you hate it....psst here is a little secret I think nobody has told you yet.....YOUR TELEVISION HAS MULTIPLE CHANNELS AND PARENTAL BLOCKING CAPABILITIES!!!!!
I don't like baseball so, I don't watch it. I don't fight to get it canceled! True it does center itself around people in the lifestyle but, then that's reality (they number in the millions). No I'm not, in case your wondering.
Anyhow it's a very well done show, great writers, great costumes; it's the 70's on the money. Definitely 5 Stars.  In 1995 FOX put out a SCI/FI series ""SPACE Above and Beyond"" that in the right time slot would still be running today. But, that I'm afraid is going to be the fate of this show bad slotting means low ratings. So, again if you like it go to CBS.com and let them know. If reality or sex offends you, you have bigger issues...",1230854400,17,985,4.324324324324325
8303471,1,B001G0MFRE,"Thank goodness this show was canceled!  I was around in the 70s and know a lot of couples that swinging tore their relationships apart.  This show IS about swinging and the *relationship card* is being played only to disguise the real wants of the studio heads ... sex, sex, sex and MORE sex shoved down our throats.  And as for the kids on the show ... you mean like the one making out in the backseat of the car?  Yeah, that's responsible television!  Put it on Showtime or HBO but keep it off the public airwaves!",1226880000,2,516,4.333333333333333
8303472,5,B001G0MFRE,"I love this show so much. I really hope it gets the green light for a second season. The characters are great, the actors and performances are superb. The writing is grand, and the sets, props and costumes are done very well. The music really takes you back to that time. The show is about relationships and complexities in the 1970's. It is NOT all about swinging. There are young peole in the series too. They are not swinging. How old were you in the seventies? Maybe you would relate to one or more of these people if you gave it a try. Go to CBS.com and watch some of the episodes. It's not too late! Swingtown debuted in the summer of 2008. Me and a lot of others I know online and off, are rooting for Swingtowns return mid-season or next summer. GO SWINGTOWN!!",1222214400,23,768,4.303448275862069
