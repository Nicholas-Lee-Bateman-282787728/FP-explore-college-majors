383690,1,6301960084,"Be careful selecting the right edition of your copy of a ""Jesus of Montreal"" DVD! Due to what I read in one of the reviews for this item, the 1989 DVD edition, I had the impression that it has both a French-language soundtrack (with English subtitles) and a dubbed English-language soundtrack, but it does not have the latter. Additionally, while the ""Region"" is marked as ""World"" (presumably the same as ""All Regions""), it does not play on my 3-year-old (current enough) Samsung DVD player, which works just fine for NTSC (Region 1) discs and is modern enough to have an HDMI setting. (The ""Colour"" on this disc is marked ""PAL/Colour,"" which connotes to me that it is in the PAL format, Region 2). The disc does play on my personal computer, but I am disappointed with this purchase on two counts. Apparently the edition of the DVD with the dubbed-English soundtrack (the one I thought I was buying due to the review included on the profile for this, the 1989 edition) is actually the 1990 edition, which costs over $100 on Amazon. I will have to do research now on whether I can expect ""World"" or ""All Region"" discs to play on my or any other standard DVD players as opposed to personal computers. I am not going to return the item, as I see no worthwhile replacement and can still play it on my computer and perhaps on somebody else's home movie system.",1398124800,2,1356,4.561475409836065

383776,2,6301960084,"NEW AND REVISED review / critique, January 2014: Update to 3 stars. As a prelude I want to say how much I enjoyed and was impressed with Arcand's movie ""The Barbarian Invasions,"" which he made 4 years after ""Jesus of Montreal."" When I reviewed his ""Jesus"" movie on this site some time ago, I focused on Arcand's gross depictions of the allegorical Jesus' crucifixion and desecration by Jews at the end of the film. I was referring to the scene at the hospital where Jewish doctors crucify him and cut open his chest and tear out his heart, which they drop in a bucket as if it were slop, and then transplant into a Jewish man. I see now that there is an explanation other than blatant anti-Semitism. Again, it is one that hasn't been considered by other commentators. In the final analysis, Arcand's allegorical story serves the purpose of telling everyone that Jesus should not be worshiped as God. By transplanting his heart, Arcand reverts him back to being(and becoming)once again a mortal Jew. It's an evolved and advanced theological concept of Jesus as Teacher, not the literal son of God. In other words, we have a lot to learn from the historical Jesus, but Christian mythology is a manufactured dogma imposed on impressionable children and searching adults who need to learn to think independently and reject the dogma. Arcand parodies the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. Jesus' soul goes wherever souls go upon death, but his heart goes into the heart of Man. The allegorical message is that Jesus resides in all our hearts, in all hearts open to receiving him (Him). This is what Arcand has to say at the end when he reveals in shocking fashion the moral of his story.

MY INITIAL REVIEW: I don't recommend this Jesuit inspired art film which teeters between being funny and serious and turns out to be neither. A musical beer commercial was paradoxically creative. The rest much less so. Towards the end a young woman laments that she was once regarded for the quality of her rear end and says, ""I used to think heaven was a beach in Bora Bora."" Was she wrong? A few minutes later, make-believe Jesus says, ""My father has forsaken me."" This forlorn film is forsaken too. From the reviews I've read, everyone has ignored the point hammered home at the end, which has always been a controversial mainstay of the original Passion Play: The Jews killed Christ. An ailing Jesus is taken by friends to a Jewish hospital where ""Dr. Gold"" says there was nothing he could do to save him. In the next frame dead Jesus is lying on an operating table with his arms strapped down and extended as if on a cross. The Jews have crucified him. The ensuing scenes are horrific. A Jewish doctor carves open his chest and plucks out his heart which is unceremoniously dumped in a bucket and transplanted into a Jewish man. The enlightened prophet is mutilated by Jews for their own nefarious purpose. Any other interpretation is disingenuous. How are Christians supposed to feel about it? Ironically, the indelible images, the desecration of Christ that concludes the film should anger those who consume Jesus in Holy Communion, in the bread and wine of the Eucharist. The traditional Passion Play performed over the years, incites hatred toward Jews for being Christ Killers. This unconventional movie parody imparts dismay and shock for its grotesque perpetuation of this conventional theme. There are plenty of ways to get your fill of Jesus. I wouldn't look for Him here unless you want to buy into the director's shocking depiction of Catholic anti-Semitism.",1300233600,,3558,4.804241435562806
383777,4,6301960084,"To me this movie is one of the best ever made. Funny, moving, tragic, inspired, perfectly timed and acted, a modern story where all the references to the Gospel can be traced, while being extremely critical to the Church as an institution ...
The only problem I have is that the copy of the DVD I got for zone 1/NTSC, with English (excellent dubbing) and original Canadian-French dialogues is of a very poor picture quality, all colors smeared into purplish slightly blurred hogwash. A great shame. The version sold for Europe (PAL :zone 2) is of a much better quality. But the cover picture depicted here is different from the one I got earlier, so the DVD may be better now ...",1291420800,,679,4.573770491803279

So no other complaints here. And not being able to read the back cover is very minor.",1276387200,,319,4.229508196721311
383779,4,6301960084,"The KOCH-Lorber release includes French and English language tracks, and English and Spanish subtitles.  It says it has a French 5.1 track, but this sounds faked (it doesn't sound like a remix, just a process pass -- the original stereo is less distracting).

Arcand is a great film maker who makes great movies.  Decline of the American Empire, Jesus of Montreal, Barbarian Invasion, and Days Of Darkness are all beautifly crafted, acted, photographed, and well worth repeated viewings.

Unfortunately the transfer here apears to be struck from the original NTSC master.  The image frequently shows ""staircasing"" (jaggies on lines), and is in a rather clautrophobic 4:3 -- it's not a deal-breaker, but it feels too tight.  I saw it when it was first released and I suspect it was shot full frame for 1.85.  Anyways, it needs a hi-def transfer and some contrast and color correction.

All theses things are irritants, but they can't keep a great film down.  If this is your only chance to see Jesus of Montreal, then take it.  The film itself doesn't date: the eighties iconography (haircuts, music, color schemes, etc.) is either subdued, or parodied.  Watching it recently I found myself surprised at how much it looks a like a movie made today and set in the eighties than an ""eighties movie"".  The biblical interpretations are interesting, not blasphemous (this isn't Catholic bashing); and the biblical allusions (the Christ story repeating itself in contemporry times) are subtle enough to be unobtrusive (although there is a rather blatant rip-off <oops, ""homage""> of Rebel Without A Cause).  And it makes for an intersting contrast with Scrocese's ""Last Temptation..."" (J of M is better).

Bottom line -- it is completely entertaining.

Just a shame that this quiet masterpiece from the eighties is presented in such a second rate way.",1253836800,,1843,5.056291390728477
383780,4,6301960084,"Every year during Holy Week my family and I watch a ""Jesus Movie"" as part of our tradition. The theology in this movie speaks closet to my own theology as any I have seen. Worth seeing.",1241913600,,185,4.166666666666667
383781,5,6301960084,"Denys Arcand's ""Jesus of Montreal"" may be one of the best movies ever made about Christian beliefs and ethics; it is certainly one of the best movies ever to come out of Canada. This French-language film tells the story of Daniel Coulombe (Lothaire Bluteau), an intense and ascetic young actor hired by the Archdiocese of Montreal to freshen up the basilica's fusty annual Passion Play. The resulting drama--which throws in bits of Roman-Judean history and ""historical Jesus"" research, with Hamlet's ""To Be Or Not To Be"" soliloquy for good measure--becomes a smash hit, particularly Daniel himself in the role of Jesus. But the play also arouses the ire of the archdiocese for veering too far from traditional Catholic dogma.

Meanwhile, the lives of Daniel and his troupe of actors begin to mirror the story of the Gospel in clever ways; wait till you see the film's updated take on Jesus in the Temple with the money-lenders.

Some viewers find this movie too clunkily allegorical for their tastes; others--who vastly prefer Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ""--object to it for the same reasons the archdiocese objected to Daniel's play. Personally, I was totally charmed, pleased and moved by it. I found the allegory both witty and appropriate, and the performances--particularly Bluteau as Daniel/Jesus--absolutely first-rate. The film moves almost imperceptibly from witty satire at its beginning to tear-jerking tragedy at its end, with a fragile but real message of hope. Above all, it asks discomfiting questions about what it truly means to be a Christian, and not just someone who accepts Christian doctrine out of laziness or self-interest. ""Jesus of Montreal"" is a smart, moving and thought-provoking film. Whatever your spiritual orientation, it will get you thinking about what you believe, and why.",1225497600,2,1816,5.237113402061856
383782,4,6301960084,excellent movie for spiritually minded folk with wonderful ending that really touched my heart and made me think. subtitles were not a problem. highly reccomended. enjoy!,1224288000,,170,5.576923076923077
383912,3,6301960084,"I loved certain parts of this movie, such as the characters' bonding and rising up from their lost lives and finding a purpose and cause with deeper meaning - one beyond money, shallow fame, and conventional success.  I also found many of the parallels between the life of Jesus (as written in the Bible) and lives of the characters in the movie to be extremely clever.  Sometimes, however, these were intellectually a bit too clever, and didn't deliver enough of an emotional punch. Other times, though, the cleverness overlapped with emotional content fantastically (such as when the main character symbolically overturned the moneychangers' table at the temple) and the movie just sang.

A few other criticisms:

1) The movie was slow to get started.  It took about 45 minutes to come up to speed, though once it did it really took off, and the last half-hour just flew.

2) The portrayal of Jesus was of a dissociated, magically-human Jesus that tires me out.  I didn't care to see the miracles of him walking on water and healing the blind.  To me that's just silly, dated mythology.  I want to see a new Jesus!

3) I didn't like how they sexualized the relationship between the actor who played Jesus and his pretty co-actor.  I don't believe an enlightened Jesus would have been in a sexual relationship.  Also, there was a scene where the Jesus character was nude in a bathtub and someone brings a little girl in and she kisses him on the lips.  Um, at best unnecessary, at worst perverse.

4) But my main criticism:  The actor who played Jesus, who slowly melded his real life with that of Jesus's life as told in the Bible, was presented as having become, by the end of the film, a sort of enlightened guru.  I found this portrayal of enlightenment false - more as emotionally splitting off and becoming dissociated, less as becoming truly enlightened and aware.  I see enlightenment as the result of working through one's traumas, grieving, and connecting fully with the best of one's inner spirit.  I felt the actor who played Jesus did not become connected with his true self much at all, nor did he manifest true greatness - and instead just lost himself in a dissociated role and ultimately died for little emotional purpose.",1222560000,,2240,4.729381443298969
383913,5,6301960084,"Why is it that the most truly moving spiritual films tend to be either those made by non-believers, or else brash, untraditional, even avant-garde reinterpretations of the basic story? Yet that's the case once more in this lovely version of the life & death of Jesus, as presented by a somewhat motley troupe of French-Canadian actors.

What begins as an attempt by a cynical local cleric to essentially jazz up the annual Passion Play, in order to get more people in attendance, turns into an actual living out of the story by the lead actors. It's indeed a literal imitation of Christ, one that transforms the actors & invites them to become more than what they are, drawing out ""the better angels of their nature"" in a very real way.

Soon the actors find their roles merging with their everyday lives, particularly on the part of Jesus. It's both amusingly satiric & painfully pointed, asking the audience to consider just how honestly they live out their most firmly-held beliefs in their own everyday lives. And it demonstrates how troubling & even threatening an actual return of Jesus would be to those who claim to follow his teachings, but tend to talk the talk rather than walk the walk.

Of course the story has a tragic ending ... or does it? It makes the viewer reflect on every idealistic movement & belief that's captured an instance of glowing goodness, only to be snuffed out by the powers that be as a danger to the status quo. Even so, the film ends on a note of hope, a reminder that we don't have to settle for the lowest common denominator, that we don't have to compromise everything -- if we're willing to make the necessary sacrifices & live the lives we could be living.

For believer, agnostic, and atheist alike, most highly recommended!",1215648000,6,1766,4.668810289389068
383914,4,6301960084,"In JESUS OF MONTREAL, a well-meaning priest hires an actor, Daniel Coulombe (Lothaire Bluteau) to rewrite and perform the Passion Play. Daniel gathers together a small group of fellow artists and together they rework the original script from the priest into a profound, thought-provoking, and emotional moving experience. The play turns into a huge success and the must-see show in Montreal. However, Daniel's company's somewhat radical interpretation of some key events stirs controversy with the Church hierarchy. Meanwhile, the lives of Daniel and his company begins to mirror the life of Christ and his disciples, illustrating the power of the story they have been telling each night.

There is a great deal to admire about JESUS OF MONTREAL; the acting, writing, lighting, and cinematography are all excellent. The film was made in 1989, so some of the costumes, hair, and design look a bit dated. However, the general overall tone of the film is so powerful that these things are easily overlooked. In short, JESUS OF MONTREAL is a moving modern-day parable that illustrates the power of the Gospel to change people's lives.",1209686400,,1130,5.174863387978142
383915,5,6301960084,"Note: French and English with English, Spanish and Korean subtitles.

A group of local Montreal actors rewrite the 'Passion Play' with an updated interpretation. Their passionate but unorthodox production stirs controversy within the Catholic Church and the community-at-large. As the pressure mounts, whether to perform or not to perform, the personal lives of the individual cast members begin to take on the persona of the characters in the play.

This transformation is most evident in Daniel (Lothaire Bluteau) who plays the role of Jesus. As the 'Life of Christ' unfolds around and within Daniel he eventually discovers the ultimate meaning of sacrificial love.

What a wonderfully original and inventive film! They just don't get any better than this. Imaginative script, superb acting (Catherine Wilkening in the role of Mireille is stunning), evocative cinematography and ethereal soundtrack (with Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance) all come together to bring this glorious modern day story of Jesus to life.",1197763200,2,1016,5.45859872611465
383916,5,6301960084,"This film is a profound meditation on the nature of Christ as understood in different ways by different people in different contexts.  It ponders the question of how the idea and felt reality of Christ (again, in various forms) fit into a larger understanding of the world, in the past and in the present.

It is a tour de force as it reviews many different ways of how ""to tell the old, old story""--actor Daniel Coulombe is hired by a priest to freshen up a very stodgy Passion Play, and he does just that:  the resulting dramatic presentation is nothing short of brilliant, even in its variations from night to night.  A truly inspired scene involves several different schticks used to pantomime the Biblical story, using a Brando-esque ""Method"" style, Kabuki, Parisian night-club, and street-realist presentations--all (sort of) in jest.

But as he puts together the crew for this performance, Daniel's life begins to mirror that of the Biblical Christ, in surprising and profound ways.  One or two parallels would come across as obviously didactic, but the film bombards viewers with so many that it becomes an object of wonder:  Daniel does live the life, and death, of the typical portrayal of Christ, but in ways that are ambiguous in their meanings.

And that is the strength of this film:  unlike films such as Mel Gibson's ""Passion"" that (semi-literally) flog viewers with their stolid and impossible attempts at realism, ""Jesus of Montreal"" works on a metaphoric, symbolic level.  The meaning of the film is what you make of it--but its intensity forces you in fact to make something of it.  You cannot watch this film seriously without having questions arise about what we know and understand of God, Jesus, faith, and the stories that govern people's lives.",1196035200,3,1770,4.925925925925926
383917,5,6301960084,"SPOILER ALERT:  THIS REVIEW WILL TALK ABOUT THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE!!

""Jesus of Montreal"" is a remarkable acheivement in dramatic structure:  it uses a passion play as a framework on which to fashion a passion play.  It's all here:  the appearance of a charismatic figure who is chosen, almost apart from his own will, to be a religious teacher, but who not only embraces the opportunity but radically alters the message to present a new view of the religion; who calls around him followers who devote themselves to him and to communicating his vision, but who after his death are tempted by opportunities to assert themselves;  who delivers one of his followers from humilating punishment (with stripping for a director substituted for stoning) and who follows that up by destroying the valuables of those who would devalue a human spirit; who endures persecution from the religious establishment; and who dies for his message.  In fact, the medical use of his body parts is a nearly literal transubstantiation of his body to heal those who never even knew him.  The movie is critical of the religious establishment -- as a Christian myself, I would not think much of a religion that cannot stand up to scrutiny.  Director Denys Arcand has made a wonderful and (dare I say it) reverent life of Christ in the guise of a story about a group of actors presenting an unconventional passion play.  I don't know that you will love this movie as much as I do, but I assure you that if you give it a chance, it will not leave you unmoved.

Although some of the scholarship the film praises seems questionable (though far less so than, say, Gibson's The Passion of the Christ), the applicability of Christ's impossible paradoxes to modern society pulls the film through.  The film is tightly edited and never boring, though after watching it I wondered if a director's cut would've filled in a few minor questions I had.

Overall, though, the movie did the things that good movies should do: it made me laugh, it was deeply moving, and it made me walk away thinking deeply (in this case about what exactly it was that this man named Jesus had to say.)  So I give it a thumb up.",1140307200,5,1089,4.61139896373057

Five struggling actors in Montreal team up to present their version, based on recent research, of the Passion Play. Soon, however, events in Montreal begin to parallel events in the play, especially the hypocrisies in the church, the theatre world, and the city itself, which begin to mirror one other. Lothaire Bluteau, who plays Jesus in the play, before long takes on proportions of Jesus himself, as he becomes a spotlighted figure with the critics and town officials. Then church officials become worried that the play might be blasphemous and take steps to shut it down. The satire is bright and probing, the script very smart. The acting is intelligent and witty, and the movie as a whole is very well done.",1140134400,7,827,4.914285714285715

The film never fails to touch the viewers profoundly and to provoke stimulating discussion amongst them, once the tears have been wiped away from their eyes.  Often a student or parishioner will come back to me weeks or even months later to tell me how deeply the film moved him or her and how it provoked a nurturing spiritual examination of the inner self and outer behavior. Often they tell me that they have repeatedly rented the film or gone out and bought a copy for themselves.

I heartily recommend all of Denis Arcand's films as worth the viewing.  I find him one of the most important film makers of our time, and I am saddened that he (a Canadian from Montreal) receives so little recognition in the United States.",1124409600,13,988,4.687861271676301

A group of local Montreal actors rewrite the 'Passion Play' with an updated interpretation. Their passionate but unorthodox production stirs controversy within the Catholic Church and the community-at-large. As the pressure mounts, whether to perform or not to perform, the personal lives of the individual cast members begin to take on the persona of the characters in the play.

This transformation is most evident in Daniel (Lothaire Bluteau) who plays the role of Jesus. As the 'Life of Christ' unfolds around and within Daniel he eventually discovers the ultimate meaning of sacrificial love.

What a wonderfully original and inventive film! They just don't get any better than this. Imaginative script, superb acting (Catherine Wilkening in the role of Mireille is stunning), evocative cinematography and ethereal soundtrack (with Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance) all come together to bring this glorious modern day story of Jesus to life.",1117065600,21,984,5.4605263157894735

These actors find that their lives are changed and they embody the very characters whom they play.  Luthaire Blutheau is marvelous and intense as the ""Jesus"" character, Daniel Colombe;  Catherine Wilkening shines as the Mary Magdalene character, Mirelle.  The other actors are also great: Constance (played by Johanne-Marie Tremblay), Martin (by Remy Girard), and Rene (Robert LePage). These form a small circle of ""disciples.""

The interpretation of Jesus is not evangelical but more on the mainstream / liberal nature, but it is thought-provoking, nonetheless.  Watch this movie with an open mind.

There are parallels with the lives of the actors with the events of Jesus' life whom they portray.  Watch for these in the film:

a) Jesus calling the disciples

b) Jesus' confrontation with the religious leaders

c) Jesus' cleansing of the moneychangers

d) Jesus is tempted by the devil to forsake his true calling

e) Jesus' giving up of his life so others may live

f) Jesus giving sight to the blind and hope to the sick

(I'm sure there are other parallels as well)

384070,5,6301960084,"This film is to be viewed with an open mind and a quick, discerning eye. It delights the senses, mesmerizes the viewer, is a great medium for a rousing after-film discussion -- but for some, could be a ""test of faith"".

The photography, the lighting, the visuals, the use of darkness, silence and symbolism combined with contemporary life in the Living Stations of the Cross are stunning.

If Jesus had incarnated in 1980's Montreal, perhaps this is what He and His French-speaking followers would have looked like -- running up and down the subway escalators, sharing baby-sitting chores, cooking breakfast for guests, visiting friends in airy lofts, stopping by to visit a fellow-actor doing an X-rated and hilarious dubbing session, and talking with Pharisees (the glib lawyer who wants to promote Daniel/Christ in ridiculous ways, mainly to line his own pockets).

This movie says to us - they were all too human 2000 years ago, who's to say they wouldn't be like that today?

Did the film test my faith? No -- nobody who was there 2000 years ago ever painted a complete picture of what it was really like, so I'm open to plenty of interpretation. I was kept spellbound -- by Jesus the human, very well played by Blutheau, by the strength of his two female friends, by the actors -- all taken from various walks of life -- and how the whole troupe eventually blends into a family of sorts. As the film progresses, it is obvious that Daniel (Blutheau) is incorporating his Christ role into his daily life. The ""Trashing of the Studio"", to protest the exploitation of the women who are auditioning for bit parts, evokes the scene in the Bible where Jesus destroys the money-lenders' tables in the temple.

In the end however, some of those who supported Christ/Blutheau, turn into his tormentors and persecutors, but even the tragic ending of this film brings a redemption in the form of modern day miracles - the blind see, the dying live once again, thanks to Daniel/Christ's final gift - his body.

The film opened with two women in a choir loft singing a haunting refrain. It ends with these same two women, sitting on the floor of the Metro, singing the same songs, begging for coins. This is the same Metro station where the dying Christ (Blutheau) was brought, during his last moments of consciousness.

One viewing is not enough. But by all means -- please see this film at least once.",1111795200,6,2395,4.729016786570743
384071,5,6301960084,"I've deleted my earlier comments on the French-language-only DVD that was first released in North America.  This brilliant film is now available in two separate versions:  the original Quebecois French soundtrack and this edition with language options: the original French, dubbed English (I avoid this because I only ever knew this film in its subtitled version), and French, Spanish, or English subtitles (optional).  There are also bilingual stereo and a French 5.1 surround sound audio mixes.  Amazon has also finally separated the two releases in its listings and labeled them more clearly, so I hope this eliminates the confusion that formerly surrounded this DVD and led many to buy the ""wrong"" version, myself included.  You'd have to be a pretty fluent francophone to catch all the nuances of this story without subtitles, and the Quebec patois is very different from the standard French taught in U.S. schools or spoken in France today.

Enough of the technicalities.  And please overlook the tacky and possibly misleading DVD packaging, with copy blurbs that seem to miss the point and photos that fixate on the pretty Parisienne model to the exclusion of much else.  I wholeheartedly recommend this film for anyone interested in exploring the story of Jesus. There is a lyricism and poignancy to Jesus of Montreal that is not to be found in Mel Gibson's snuff flick.  Director/writer Arcand has crafted an extraordinarily skillful parallel script that not only re-presents the traditional Passion Play version of Jesus' life -- updated with challenging new assertions -- but also subtly  and movingly reenacts it in modern Montreal, as the troupe of actors unwittingly find themselves walking in the footsteps of their theatrical alter-egos.  This is marvelous filmmaking, and true art.  Jesus of Montreal is one of those rare movies that will reveal something new to you with every viewing; the more familiar you are with the traditional Gospels, the more allegorical elements you will recognize.  Sometimes this produces very amusing results -- I am particularly fond of the sequence where Daniel/Jesus (played to perfection by Lothaire Bluteau) is ""tempted"" by the Devil in the guise of a smooth-talking entertainment lawyer.  And of course there is a terrific come-uppance for the ""moneylenders in the temple"".

Despite comical moments, this is a sad movie, with Daniel unable to escape his destiny.  Jesus of Montreal  concludes in a welter of suffering -- Calvary, the descent into the Underworld (literally -- another of Arcand's deft touches, and watch for the head of John the Baptist!),  apocalyptic visions, and finally, disappearance from the world of man.  Yet there is also the promise of redemption and resurrection, and of miracles unforeseen.  Although the disciples are leaderless and bereft, vulnerable to the blandishments of the material world (with the notable exception of ""Mary Magdalene""), there is still Hope  shining beyond the touch of evil or folly, and the angels still sing for those who will hear them, even in the unlikeliest of places (the movie ends, in circular fashion, much as it begins).

A beautiful achievement.  Jesus of Montreal may outrage some fundamentalists and more orthodox believers, confuse  or bewilder others, and but it never fails to challenge, and its message of love and faith and its abiding honesty and humanity is needed now more than ever.",1107388800,59,3412,5.206959706959707

384164,5,6301960084,"Jesus of Montreal is an entertaining and challenging film. A group of 5 actors volunteer to act in a passion play sponsored by a Catholic church. One of the actors, re-writes the play at the recommendation of the parrish priest because the older version was dry, stiff, boring and had become unpopular. The young actor, Daniel Coulombe, breathes new life into the play, updating the themes and making the play a powerful experience for the audience. At this point a transformation occurs with the actor who plays Jesus becoming much more Christ-like while the other 4 actors become much more like the disciples of Christ. The forces of the conservative church begin to oppose them much like the Pharisees opposed Christ and his teaching. Speakers of truth upset the status quo. The language of the passion play is hypnotic and powerful. Daniel goes into the audience giving out bread and at one point says: ""What good do you acrue by loving those who already love you?"" At this point irony and dark humor begin to bloom, with Daniel receiving a crushing head blow when a member of the audience fights with a security guard who is trying to shut down the final performance of the play. I thought that the film was theologically sound and firmly based in Christianity. What could be more Christian than a film in which the word of God in the Bible transforms the hearts and actions of a group of actors as well as their audience? What could be more Christian than a film in which the Holy Spirit moves within a community of committed persons? I am sure fundamentalist Protestants and Roman Catholics may find some of the film offensive, yet the message of transcendence is clear and holds the entire drama together, even amidst the ironies and challenges of modern life.

The spiritual transformation happens not only to him but also to the artistic crew of volunteering professionals recruited by him for the performance of a religious play. The play - originally written by a Catholic priest and a friend of Daniel - is altered by Daniel through a firsthand interpretation of the New Testament in the light of the recent historical evidence. The firsthand interpretation just as that of Jan Hus or St Francis invites censure of the Catholic Church. (After all, from the point of view of the institutionalized faith any personal faith is a heresy.) The play is banned and Daniel Coulombe with his disciples repeats the fate of Jesus in a modern and slightly comic setting. This gives a very strong flavor of irony to the film. Although all the issues touched are extremely sensitive, Denys Arcand's rendering of them is so anaesthetized that there is no pain associated with the relentlessly truthful depiction of the humanity and its faith.

384259,5,6301960084," J&eacute;sus de Montr&eacute;al  was a stunning, thought-provoking film by Montr&eacute;alais director Denys Arcand. The strong ensemble cast includes Lothaire Bluteau (""Le confessional,"" ""La robe noire"") and Robert Lepage (famous Qu&eacute;bec playwright, author of ""N,"" and ""The Seven Streams of the River Ota""). The story revolves around a series of actors: Constance (who works in a soup kitchen, plays Mary Magdalene and sleeps with the priest), Mireille (a sexy young actress whose sole talent, according to her ex, is in her backside), Martin and R&eacute;n&eacute;, actors who dub porno films in French, and Daniel (Bluteau), a fragile young actor enlisted to play Jesus in a popular passion play. Bluteau is frail and androgynous to a certain degree, lending him an angelic quality. He is extremely soft-spoken and I often had to turn the volume up to hear him. His voice was barely above a whisper in many of the passion play scenes and near the end.
Daniel does extensive research into the life and times of Jesus, taking into account new archaeological findings. Instead of merely ""updating"" the passion play he, along with his fellow actors, rewrites it. Jesus is the son of a Roman soldier in the play, the crucifixion is performed accurately (naked, with the torso twisted to the side), and the Catholic priests are upset and demand an end to the passion play on the mount. Martin works in his Hamlet soliloquy ""To sleep...perchance to dream..."" in a scene that is strangely powerful as the resurrected Jesus comes to the disciples.
The normally mild mannered Daniel rebels at the treatment Mireille receives at an audition, and mirroring Jesus' disruption of the moneylenders in the temple in Matthew 21:12 (""And Jesus entered into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of he money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves."") Daniel becomes irrational when the casting director (Mireille's ex-boyfriend) tells her to strip. Daniel orders her to refuse, then, flying into a rage knocks over tables, smashes cameras and monitors and causes thousands of dollars worth of damage. His life begins to mirror that of Jesus.
Lothaire Bluteau was the only choice for the role of Daniel/ Jesus. He becomes so involved in all of his roles that he walks a dangerous line. Robert Lepage says that he embodies and expresses emotional pain better than any actor in the world. Lothaire Bluteau says of himself that he still is struggling to learn to live with the searing pain he feels for real. According to a recent interview, ""In person, the theatrical, charismatic, deeply analytical and cathartic Bluteau wears many emotional scars beneath his pale and skeletal physical armour. His immersion into the characters that have inhabited not only his physical being, but his emotional thoughts and each waking moment are the very extension of himself into some intangible realms. He readily admits that these fictional characters are always awaiting his presence to fill them and breathe life into their troubled existences."" Ask Bluteau if he finds it difficult to achieve a separation point between the characters her portrays and himself and he frowns: ""Sometimes I think I'm getting better at not drowning in the emotional sadness and the fear I have when I start working on a film or play. When you are enriched by your characters life, you do tend to share a lot of things together. They will call upon your emotions and leave you with souvenirs and old scars, that you manage to survive from. The character wants to borrow that pain, and of course there is a transformation and collar of sadness that you are attached to."" So he is ultimately believable as a modern-day Jesus, preaching to the crowds at a Montr&eacute;al subway station, chasing the ""money lenders"" out of the studio, and finally sacrificing his life so that others may live through him. The final scenes are unspeakably powerful as Daniel's message lives on.
There are moments of humour as well, irreverence towards Catholic doctrine and its unwillingness to change. When the priest informs them that they have to revert to the original script, Martin, R&eacute;n&eacute;, Constance and Mireille begin an absurdly funny ad-lib update of the passion play. First Constance recites a line and makes it sound like a line from a porno dub, then Mireille turns it into une com&eacute;die franaise, Martin tries New York method acting, R&eacute;n&eacute; vulgar joual, and Martin and R&eacute;n&eacute; do a Kabuki version that had me in tears. It was the funniest thing I had seen in years. There are similar lighthearted moments between the actors/friends, but much of the story has a sombre tone.
The cinematography is spectacular, with enticing shots of Montr&eacute;al at work and at play. The nighttime scenes are particularly effective, as are the passion play scenes. The music is sparse but haunting: an aria from Pergolesi's Stabat Mater that is sung at the end over the credits, and during the passion play we hear haunting music from Le myst&egrave;re des voix bulgares. There is some nudity, although it is not sexual. There is a lot of offensive language, especially during the improv passion play, and during the porno dubbing scene (which is hilarious in a sad way). This is not a film for those who are devoutly religious or easily offended. The film is subtitled in English (with French subtitles over the English dialogue).

 J&eacute;sus de Montr&eacute;al  explores the story of Jesus, updates it, gives it a fresh young face in the form of Daniel. What would happen if Jesus reappeared in the world today? Denys Arcand explores this through multiple Biblical parallels and imagery and a stellar supporting cast, also using the film as a vehicle to express his distaste of the all-consuming media and material greed. We see the transformation of a group of ordinary actors into Biblical beings who are profoundly changed by Daniel's/Jesus's presence in their lives.

The chasm between this film and any others in this genre is hard to stretch your brain across if you haven't seen the film. The analogy is never voiced; it's left to the viewer to infer, and is so powerful, that it touched even this Jew. The purpose of the analogy isn't to convert people to Christianity, so the film doesn't get bogged down in didacticism; the filmmakers have simply tapped into the potency of the gospel stories, which even a non-Christian can appreciate in a film that is well-made.
This film is well-made. The camera work is exquisite, and the performances of the three lead actors are outstanding. I won't cheapen them by saying they are ""oscar quality,"" or anything like that. The actors don't seem to be working for pay or accolade, but because they wanted this film to be made. Lothaire Bluteau, in particular, the Jesus figure throws so much into everything, I can picture him after each take, like a dancer, or a boxer, flopping into his chair sweat-drenched, grabbing a water bottle, while his manager towels him down, and someone massages his shoulders.
The characters in the film come by their gospel alter-egos as out of work actors hired by a priest to pump up his parish passion play. Simple story right? The analogy has already begun to unfold, and the audience doesn't even know it yet; there's no hint of things to come.
I was fortunate to see this movie on the screen, but I have rented it since, forcing friends to watch it (they're never sorry). It will always be one of my favorites.",1006992000,10,1590,4.602112676056338
384333,5,6301960084,"Jesus of montreal is a deceptively simple premise: an out of work actor is hired to resucitate an annual Passion play in a Monteral church. What happens from there is far from ordianry. It asks the question Is art Imitating life, or is life imitating art?As the players deepen their roles,unexpected turn occur. So often movies with religious themes are schlock,treaclely spouting pious slogans that are void of life. Jesus of Monmtreal avoids all of these pitfalls,and does so brilliantly. Lothar Bleauteu{also wonderful in Black Robe} hits every note perfectly in playing the lead. It brings in perfectly the idea of what faith actually means and asks once more the age old question first put forth in Palestine 2000 years agO:""who do you say that I am?""Absolutely superb,wry humor,dead on performances,crisp direction. Only Passolini's Gospel According to St Matthew stands with this. Brilliant!",985564800,7,898,5.286713286713287
384334,5,6301960084,"One of the few 'artistic' interpretations of the gospels that really works, I prefer this to 'The last temptation of Christ'. I have watched this film maybe 5 times and am still picking up the subtle modern day 'analogies' of the gospel stories. There are at least more than 20. The modern day version of Jesus' anger at the temple is great. If you are a not a 'hardline' Christian, this film will probably enrich your image of Jesus, regardless of beliefs.",976579200,4,457,4.585365853658536
384335,5,6301960084,"Jesus, it seems, can become a remote figure for many, as contemporary times fix him more and more as an ""historical"" figure.  Who has not wondered what Jesus might be like were he living among us today?  This movie gives some thought to that musing... a lot of thought.
 While Daniel, the director of the sagging Passion Play, is never  directly alluded to as Jesus, he does take on much of the persona that we might imagine for the Son of Man.  There are parallels suggested in his struggles with greedy corporate characters, his urging friends to be forgiving, his instinct for inclusiveness over rejection of others -- even his admiration for the innocence of children.  However, these are not intentionally presented to necessarily lead viewers to conclude that Daniel is, in fact, Jesus returned.  What they do, instead, is encourage the viewer to think of his or her own sense of what Jesus meant to humanity, and how these meanings might apply in the modern world. Perhaps you've seen the bumper stickers that say ""What would Jesus do?""  Here, we are urged to take the question with utmost seriousness, and entertain the possibility that many people, even self-proclaimed Christians, may ultimately not like the answer to this question.
 The film is very well acted, and offers a mixture of some subtle humor along with its most serious religious speculations.  On the whole, however, the tone is more bittersweet and melancholy.  I think it's because we are made to ponder how very far adrift both the doubters and the believers of Jesus have come from the original message.  If you are very traditional in your beliefs, you may find this film offensive.  If you feel comfortable with pushing your thoughts about Jesus to new and even disconcerting levels, then you will find this, as others have asserted -- ""a gem.""  It is subtitled, but the story is so well developed that most viewers will hardly be distracted.",973900800,10,1923,4.840978593272172
384336,5,6301960084,"Of all the depictions on film of the crucifixion of Christ, I find this one the most harrowing...it's wrenching as well as uplifting, and the  always wonderful Lothaire Bluteau is extraordinary as Jesus in the passion  play, and as the actor who won't compromise his art for commercial success,  and starts to acquire aspects of Jesus' character into his own.
On a  lighter note, the ""hot"" dubbing scene early in the film is  hilarious, and there are many other extremely humorous parts. The talented  ensemble cast is superb, as good in the comedy as in the drama.
Perhaps  this is not a film for those with strict beliefs, but if you can accept  diverse views, it will move you on many different levels.",967248000,36,705,4.67479674796748
384337,4,6301960084,"It's been quite a few years since I've seen this movie, but for some reason, I've recently started thinking about it and connecting all the dots. As much as I enjoyed it originally, I've developed a new appreciation  of it. Other reviewers have described it well, so I'll just give an  ""Amen"" to their praise. I now marvel at how subtly and  ingeniously the film's makers made the characters surrounding the theater  troup&eacute; mirror the characters surrounding the main people in the original  Passion story. Could the people in the Gospels' account have been real  flesh-and-blood people, and not just characters in a mythical morality  tale? This film will convince you they could have been. All aspects of the  production are excellent. Blutheau was superb as Daniel/Jesus. His  motivations and actions are as inscrutible as those of the original Jesus.  When Daniel died, nothing happened. Or did it? You decide. Just as you must  decide concerning the original Jesus' death. A tantalizing and intrigueing  movie.",958003200,32,1021,5.121212121212121

The actors are brought to a new way of looking at their  ""jobs"" by experiencing the Christ in person through living with  the Word as drama.

7817648,4,6301960084,"A touching, unique, and well-acted film. Also, occasionally hilarious. It's too heavy-handed and predictable at times to qualify as a ""Great Film"", and the late 80's soundtrack and fashion sense don't wear well 30 years on. Still, it's always been a personal favorite of mine and I feel it deserves more recognition.

Sadly, it's difficult to find an acceptable presentation - there's no blu-ray, and the widely available North American DVD from Koch is a poor quality 4:3 pan-and-scan transfer. To my knowledge, the only 16:9 anamorphic release with English subtitles is the 2006 edition by Arrow from the UK, which I also own. (There may be an earlier Arrow release that's identical as well, but that's not clear to me.) The one you want has a light blue cover with a staircase (not an escalator) and ""Special Edition"" printed at the bottom. Unfortunately, the video quality on the Arrow edition is still mediocre even by DVD standards, perhaps a limitation of the available originals. But it's watchable. Of course, watching a UK DVD in the States requires extra effort - make sure you have a region-free player or know how to extract a usable digital version. For those knowledgeable about video encoding, the PAL version is simply sped up one frame per second from the original film with no awkward pulldowns or interlacing, so it can be reencoded at the original frame rate relatively easily.

For all the 100's of mediocre pictures that are restored and rereleased every year in high-def, it's shameful that there's no better release of Jesus of Montreal. This is a valuable film.

edit: After a side-by-side inspection, it's obvious that the Arrow is not only a different transfer but also uses an entirely different source - there are a few seconds of footage in the Arrow that don't exist in the Koch. This may also explain the vast differences in color between the two editions - the Koch is an absurdly dark transfer, completely losing entire areas of the image to black in the nighttime performance scenes. The Arrow is much better and brighter, but the color balance is also very different. Neither looks quite right to me. Also, the Arrow is much rougher in quality, whether due to the source, the transfer, or post-processing I can't tell. The Koch, while much too dark, is also much cleaner. Overall, the Arrow is still clearly preferable, but neither are what the film deserves.",1491868800,,2396,4.867647058823529
