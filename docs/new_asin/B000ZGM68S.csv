8235444,4,B000ZGM68S,"First I know nothing about football. Second, I have two brothers and an otherwise wonderful man who live, breathe and sleep sports...especially NY Giants football. Every year my sister-in-law and I feel like third wheels as the guys gather to spend countless hours glued to the TV screen.

When my husband gave me this, for Valentine's Day no less, I was upset because I figured it would be yet another way for him to glorify the wonders of football. But it's nothing like that. It's like a primer for football ""widows"" and gave me simple explanations of what football is about, something my brothers and husband never had the patience or inclination to do.

The DVD is easy to understand and fun to watch. I enjoyed the interaction of the couples who are asked about how football affects their relationship. (Carol and Jamie are a trip and I wish Carol luck!) And the relationship coach did suggest a few things I plan to try. I laughed when the Princeton coach had the ladies dress up in football uniforms and run through exercises. That's something I'd want to do!

I learned basic things about the game: how the players line up; what the offense/defense needs to do in 4 downs and what the refs mean when they use hand signals. (I told you I knew nothing!)

Will this DVD turn me into a #1 Giants fan? I can't say that's true but I think it did a good enough job in giving me an idea about what's going on/to expect so come the fall I'll want to watch the game and show off what I know!
