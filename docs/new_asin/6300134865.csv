212807,3,6300134865,"...it's an over-budgeted drama with an obtrusive soundtrack.
Granted, it has very high production values and some novel theatrical effects adapted for cinema (studio set, symbolic lighting, scrim reveals). But they're not enough to make this the type of film something you'd want to see again (except to see Terri Garr walk around in skimpy underwear or to drool over Raul Julia topless and in tight briefs). Rebecca DeMornay makes her silver screen debut as an irate restaurant customer.
The music, which is key to a musical's appeal, is bluesy-jazz vocals sung by Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle, and is tolerable only to fans of Tom Waits. Otherwise, it's an annoying ""foreground"" music to accompany conventionally-acted scenes. The only singing in this movie by any character is a surprisingly atmospheric four-minute shot where Ray (Julia) serenades Frannie (Garr) to dubbed-in piano playing as a prelude to a tango. The only ""big dance number"" follows shortly afterward, with the requisite showgirls, cars, neon lights, and cast of dozens hot-footing it on the old Las Vegas Strip.
Most audiences expect to see a cast who sings, dances, and acts if the work is billed as a musical, but the blue-collar male lead Hank (Frederic Forrest) only acts, and the two who can sing and dance (Garr, Julia) are only given two too-short opportunities. Circus girl Leila (Nastassja Kinski) walks a tightrope, locomotes on a large ball, and lip-syncs a fantasy scene where someone else's singing voice is dubbed in. This movie poorly showcases theatrical talent by trying to be cinematically avant-garde.
Francis Ford Coppola lavished a lot of art, care, and money in the making of this movie (which was the first to integrate video technology into traditional celluloid) but he tampered too much with genre and left movie audiences wondering ""Was it a musical or a romantic drama?"" Most importantly, the story of a banal ... couple who have no compunctions over dumping someone at the drop of a hat is not in the least bit romantic.",1035244800,3,2021,5.017857142857143
212808,4,6300134865,"this is an odd film, part romance, musical, part - I don't know what. It doesn't really fit into any category. There's dancing, music, (melo)drama, story, character, poignancy - it's all in there somewhere. And it's long too.
With all that, I suggest you stick with it at one sitting, it's a film that repays dividends. I find it tragically moving at points - and this for a film that concerns two very ordinay people. It's a film that can still make a lump come into my throat at times. I watch it longing for some of the fantasy moments - Terri Garr dancing with her fancy lover on a set that (crudely) conjures up Bora Bora, Frederic Forrest with Nastassja Kinski in the breaking up yard turning piles of wrecked cars into an orchestra - but you can only appreciate these precious moments in the context of the complete piece. You just have to wait for it to play out in front of you.
I can see why some people say it is over long and boring, that the underlying subject-matter is trivial and not worthy of the treatment. I say it is a masterpiece, that the director can elevate these two ordinay people's lives, and make them a little dramatic, make their lives move to music and poetry.
for me, it is a film that I allow myself to watch every now and again - just so as not to spoil the effect when I do watch it. And when I finish it, I am filled with a longing to see it all again - in the knowledge that I must be patient.

212809,1,6300134865,"""One from the Heart"" feels like one to the groin.  Teri Garr and Frederic Forrest are two everyday Joes who live together and are having relationship difficuties. Garr works in a travel agency, wishing she could visit the places she sends others to. Forrest works at a wrecking yard, salvaging old neon signs and creating a little piece of heaven in the back of the garage. Garr and Forrest call it quits, and Garr meets Raul Julia, a waiter/wannabe singer who wants to go to all those places Garr dreams about. Forrest meets circus girl Nastassia Kinski, who loves his little playland behind the garage, and also wants to run away with him. These new couples all bed down together, and Garr prepares to go to Bora Bora with Julia. Kinski leaves Forrest, who chases Garr, trying to stop her from getting on the plane. Eventually, the two (Garr and Forrest) end up back together with a new found love for each other...I just saved you a dollar video rental fee, and about an hour and three quarters of your life.
I cannot describe to you how dull this film is. It took me two days to plow through it. Garr and Forrest are terrible. They have a few moments of drama that play like a bad episode of ""My So Called Life,"" and their attempts at screwball comedy are so unfunny, I cringed in agony. Raul Julia is okay, but I realized how much I missed this underrated actor in better films. Kinski is there and gone so quickly, I did not know why she was listed so highly in the credits. She warns Forrest that she will disappear if he does not stay with her. In her exit scene, he walks away from her standing by a car, and in the background you can see her head as she ducks behind the car. Forrest turns around and she is ""magically"" gone. Some dramatic exit.
Coppola, for reasons known only to him, decided to recreate the Las Vegas strip on a soundstage. The first credit at the end of the film reads something to the effect: ""This entire film was shot on the stages of Zoetrope Studios."" Really? Wow, I guess the constant spotting of the edges of the backscreen in the exterior scenes was not a bold cinematic statement, but sloppy direction. In one awful mistake, as the camera looks up at Forrest, you can see the actual ceiling of the giant building they recreated this massive set in.
Teri Garr, an actress I just cannot stand for reasons I will not go into, does the same performance she always does. This time, Coppola puts her through THREE different scenes where she changes clothes, just for the gratuitous nudity. Garr and Forrest are supposed to be playing average folks like you and me, but if this is what Coppola thinks the rest of America is really like, he needs to get away from Hollywood. Lainie Kazan and Harry Dean Stanton are dragged out in the thankless roles of Garr and Forrest's best friends. Hmm, that's something new in a romantic comedy.
Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle sing all the songs on the soundtrack. The songs are okay, they just do not belong in this film. Coppola pulls all the tricks out of his magic movie fun bag, and each one fizzles. Average special effects seem thrown in because the budget was huge, not because a scene demanded it. Scenes run too long, have no point, and you can almost hear Coppola in the background whispering ""all of this was shot on the stages of Zoetrope Studios."" ""One from the Heart"" should have stayed there.
This is rated (R) for some physical violence, profanity, female nudity, brief male nudity, and some sexual content.",1022803200,6,3490,4.504731861198739

Two characters who hate each other spend the movie yelling and fighting and trying to get away from each other, but they can't, because that's what love is.  Or something. The dozens of splits screens showing them together when they are really apart, and there are dozens of these, even having them talk to each other when they are separarted, are amazingly irritating. Set in Las Vegas but shot 100% in studio, it's deliberately artificial looking, and poorly lit (until the very last shot, because symbolism!), featuring one-note side characters and a monotonous mumbling musical score that plays throughout, as if Tom Petty and and Bob Dylan are doing a commentary track in their sleep. Teri's comic gifts are never used, there is nothing between the leads, the supposed dramatic confrontations in the second half are absurd, the resolution is unearned,  Coppola was apparently going for ""romantic fairy tale"" but instead created a grandly ill-conceived mess, that bankrupted him for a decade.

But she appears to think looking beautiful is enough...you really don't have to be able to act. She does deserve kudos for learning several circus skills, like tight rope walking, for the movie. The Tom Waits sound track is really really bad. It continually interferes with the plot. It is often too much, too loud. Maybe its suppose to be an important part of the story telling but it adds little and takes a lot away. Often its impossible to hear the dialogue. Finally, the special features are nothing special.

ONE FROM THE HEART: Its the 4th of July in Vegas, and Frannie (Garr) and Hanks (Forrest) relationship is on the rocks. She splits and is picked up by Ray (Julia), a slick lounge singer, and Hank is picked up by free-spirited circus acrobat Leila (Kinski). Ray wants Frannie to run away with him, and Leila invites Hank to do the same. But Hank realizes he loves Frannie, and makes a desperate attempt to reclaim her. Will any of their stories have a happy ending?

Simple story; complicated film. Decades after the hoopla over Coppolas experimental techniques, its still a visual knockoutand still flawed. Or was it experimental in all aspects? Did Coppola purposefully turn typical film priorities on their head, daring to put plot at the bottom and use actors as set dressing, while emphasizing the extraordinary ordinarily background elements like music, technique, sets, lighting and editing?

Dean Tavoularis technical tour-de-force of creating Vegas on a sound stage (including crowded intersections, sunrise and rain, and an entire airport, complete with a jet taking off overhead!) is a wonder to watch. So what if the film is a triumph of style over substance? The key word is still triumph. Dont reject it for what it isntembrace it for what it is: a fearless experiment in cinematic magic.

212998,3,6300134865,"One from the Heart (Francis Ford Coppola, 1982)

One from the Heart initially stuck in my head because of Sneak Previews, the original Siskel and Ebert movie review show back when it was on public television. My favorite section of the show was always the Dog of the Week, at the end, when each critic would highlight the worst film he'd seen that week. I got a lot of recommendations from the Dog of the Week. That, naturally, led to a year-end list of the ten worst movies of the year. If a movie showed up on the Ten Worst list, I was almost guaranteed a good time. One from the Heart was on Gene Siskel's ten worst list for 1982; if I recall correctly, it was #1. (Pretty much anything that made their lists from that year is gold; they also included Inchon,  Pink Floyd: The Wall, and Halloween III.) But I'd never gotten a chance to see it until recently. While Coppola has always been an on-and-off director for me, I've found over the years that it's pretty hard to go wrong with Frederic Forrest, and with One from the Heart, Forrest gets a rare starring role. It's not the best movie in the worldcertainly not in the same league as Forrest's other major 1982 film, Hammettbut it's certainly not one of 1982's worst movies.

Plot: Hank (Forrest) and Frannie (Tootsie's Teri Garr) have been living together for coming up on ten years. The two of them have settled into boredom and routine, and Frannie has had enough; she announces, on the eve of their fifth anniversary, that she's leaving. Hank puts up token resistance, but when it comes right down to it, he's more perturbed by the disturbing of the routine. Soon after, the two of them meet their dream mates in Ray (Tempest's Raul Julia) and Leila (Cat People's Nastassja Kinski), but Hank soon realizes that dream girl or no dream girl, Frannie is the one he really loves. What lengths is he willing to go to in order to get her back?

Read as a straight film, One from the Heart does indeed make very little sense. I hesitate to speculate on Coppola's mental state (or state of inebriation) at the time he was making this movie, but asking oneself what was everyone involved in this movie smoking? on a regular basis will not put you too many standard deviations away from the norm. On the other hand, if you read this as Coppola's attemptand one should always remember that Coppola began his career in the Corman factory with the similarly off the wall Dementia 13 almost twenty years before thisto make a psychedelic musical, the way L. Q. Jones had tried to make a psychedelic science fiction film seven years before with A Boy and His Dog, One from the Heart starts making a little more sense. The plot's fuzziness, the somewhat puerile sense of humor on occasion, the sometimes silly decisions made by the characters. It all falls into place. That doesn't excuse the movie's shortcomings, but at least it allows you to have some fun with them. ** ",1407801600,,2918,4.5399239543726235
212999,1,6300134865,"I thought this was terrible. In case you were thinking it is a musical based on the reviews talking about the songs, it is NOT a musical - by definition a musical is where the onscreen people sing, this is not a musical, just a movie with a lot of downbeat musical numbers playing in the background. The music/soundtrack is supposed to be awesome, I found them sad depressing songs..in keeping with the overall theme of the movie I guess.

The story is about a cheating guy who has been screwing around during the entire time he is ""in love"" with Teri Garr, he even screws around while in the middle of trying to get her back. Meanwhile, she is trying to find someone who can breath some life back into her life, the reunion at the end was a complete defeat for her as she simply gives up and goes back to a guy who has not changed and presumably will continue to cheat on her.

Featuring depressing downbeat songs through the entire movie (Correction, there was one upbeat number, which immediately ended in a depressing note as she sees him with his new girl and stops dancing) and a depressing view of a relationship disintegrating. I don't see how people can even make it to the supposedly ""happy"" last 1 minute of the move.

At least it is more available today since it can be seen online with streaming services such as Amazon Instant Video. Coppola was forced to give up his studio Zoetrope because of this film's fantastic failure. I think the major problem was that most people could not envision the director of the Godfather movies and APOCALYPSE NOW making a musical love story set on a soundstage which he built of Las Vegas (this rebuilding was utterly gorgeous). Then he went a violated another rule: none of the characters sang.  Instead, Crystal Gayle and Tom Waits sang off camera. Then there were the actors. The leads were not typical leads.  They were everyday types played by ordinary looking actors, Frederic Forrest and Teri Garr. The secondary actors, also the secondary love interests, were played by two powerhouses, both looks and talent,  Nastasha Kinski and Raoul Julia. The ordinary lovers breakup and have fantasy interludes with the secondary stars. It is a fantastic film and I've lost count of how many times I've seen it. If you have never seen it, you missed one of his major movies which has remained a buried treasure.

213046,4,6300134865,"In many regards, particularly through the first twenty minutes, this movie is far from impressive. Frederic Forrest's early scenes with Harry Dean Stanton and Teri Garr are quite frankly, embarrassing. (This includes Teri Garr's scene with Lainie Kazan.) The dialogue appears to have been written by a ninth grader and it is almost as if the players are attempting to demonstrate bad acting.  But once Nastassja Kinski and, particularly, Raul Julia appear, the movie transmogrifies into an American fable.  There is an extended pas de deux between Teri Garr and Raul Julia that is easily the best evocation of an LSD trip ever presented on film.

In short, this is a deeply flawed film that, by and large, is redeemed by some elements of spectacle that, because they contain elements of the sweetest aspects of humanity, create a magical experience.  The Tom Waits score contains a couple of clunkers as well, but there are a number of first-rate songs that embellish the film.

This was not unpredictable. However, the cinematography was dreamy and good and that's where I have to stop praising this worthless piece of film. Coppola deserved the poor reviews he received for this effort. I won't go so far as to say he deserved losing his fortune over it, but in a system of merit and desert, he certainly shouldn't have profited from this disaster. As much as I love Waits, I thought Crystal Gayle was shrieky and that the entire soundtrack intruded in the film and detracted from what little acting was going on. This story has been told a zillion different times and I really had to force myself to watch through to the end. In fairness, I saw the Amazon Prime Instant Movie so I was not able to glean anything from the DVD. I seriously doubt if it would have helped, though. One reviewer said that if you don't like this ""film"" you are heartless. Heartless I'm not. It is very difficult to sympathize with characters who seem to care so little about anything. I didn't find the movie sad; I found it lacking in substance. It was a jazzy, clangy, unbalanced, apathetic little piece and I'm angry at myself for wasting my time with it.",1352764800,,1330,4.477366255144033

213050,5,6300134865,"When I saw this film in the First Run theaters, ...it was highly stylized. There were a few glaring continuity mistakes, and the characters seemed superficial.

Upon re-viewing it on home video, [not to mention the awesome bonus materials,] It takes place in Vegas, they discuss that he didn't 'LOOK' like her Prince Charming, because Las Vegas is the City without clocks, This movie takes place at sunrise, sunset, mid-day, and during the evening...all at once. Sometimes the bright scene is because of the neon 'strip,' and sometimes the darkness is just a few steps away.

The allegories of the Junk Yard, and the Travel Agency are juxtaposed by the desires of the couple's component personalities. The fantasy characters, are both 'bigger than life,' and also superficial illusions of what the couple are projecting upon them.

The nightmare that director Francis Ford Coppola was put through to make this movie, (again, see bonus materials included,) makes this  film's completion even more ambitious than the sets and miniatures! Tho' it takes place in Las Vegas, the entire film was created on Sound Stages in Hollywood at the one-film-trick-pony ZOETROPE STUDIOS.

The colors of green with envy, and red with rage, are left on the roadside. There are Carnival lighting, and scrim dissovles, peppered throughout this entire offering. The ""airport set"" (a parking lot, two-story airport and flying plane are stunning, especially with a larger viewing screen.

It is sad to think that Terri Garr is now in a wheelchair, upon seeing the fabulous dancing choreographed by Toni Basil(American Graffitti/The Lockers/Mickey,) and coached by an uncredited Gene Kelly, with all of its precision and passion. It is a real tribute to her talent, that this dance with Raul Julia (Kiss of the Spider Woman) was captured on film before her medical issues, manifested themselves. It is also one of her best roles, dissatisfied with 'shacking up' for 5 years, she leaves to find her soul-mate...

In terms of content, if you're in the smoky mood for a little Tom Waits ambiance with a film to accompany it, you've got your movie.  For what it sets out to do, ""One From The Heart"" is a quality production through and through, a stylized jazz riff of a movie from a good year in cinema, 1982.  Appreciate magical realism as opposed to realism and you're bound to get something from the film.  It reminded me a little of ""Singin' in the Rain"" with Fred Astaire, not least because the of the film's near-technicolor dazzle, but also for the dance sequences and song elements that step out of the story's reality and into the surreal, aided and abetted of course by Coppola's Zoetrope Studios and fine editing and camera-work.  Don't come expecting the latest Hollywood blockbuster or anything in the nature of Godfather or Apocalypse Now, but if you're up for the traditional confines of a love story set in Las Vegas with a soundtrack to match, you may find ""One From The Heart"" a pleasant enough ride for what it does offer.

213084,1,6300134865,"This film has always been a favorite. My wife and I have worn out two video versions over the years, as well as a copy of the soundtrack LP (being big Tom Waits fans also). Needless to say, we were thrilled to see it finally come out on DVD. What a joke. Somewhere along the line Coppola must have decided that it could be improved upon, and managed to destroy it in the process. From the opening scenes it's a mess. The music has even been relocated. In the original version there's very little dialog needed in the beginning because the song lyrics perfectly describe what's going on. Not any more. Not only do the lyrics no longer match what's happening on the screen, but there's even dialog on top of the lyrics in spots. Scenes were added that actually take away from the film while a few favorite spots have been cut out. One truly bad judgment call is where there was a love scene with Teri Garr and Raul Julia followed by one with Fredric Forrest and Nastassja Kinski. In the new ""improved"" version it cuts back and forth between the two scenes like the viewers attention span must not be long enough to remember what happened last. There are also some harsh scene cuts now in the film that weren't there in the original (including one extra bad one where the music is abruptly cut off). One of the most impressive things about the original release was the way the film flowed from beginning to end much like a stage play. That's gone. One thing I can't figure out is the other reviewers of this film that are watching the DVD copy after seeing it on video, yet none of them seem to notice the difference. How is that possible? If the DVD version had been the original release back in 1982, I wouldn't be writing this now. I would have only seen the film once, and would have forgotten it immediately. In spite of the unfair rap this film got in the beginning, I've always defended it as one of Coppola's best works. He gambled and lost everything on this film including his studio complex in the process. It took many years and films to pay back the debts, but the end result was a cinematic beauty that stood on it's own merits. Sadly, what's left of it can't even do that now.

There actually is a lot of heart in this movie, even as it gets bogged down in the technological murk. Frederic Forrest and Teri Garr make an attractive if mutually dim couple. Yes, they come off as more than a little clunky, but for me,at any rate, that's part of their charm. It makes it all the more believable when temptation, in the forms of Nastassja Kinski and Raul Julia, threaten to break our hero and heroine apart forever. The one thing that doesn't quite mesh is the musical ""greek chorus"" of Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle-----and, don't misunderstand, I LOVE this soundtrack whenever I'm playing it independent of the movie. WITH the movie, though, it comes across as even more heavy-handed than the special effects here, and I wonder if we wouldn't have gotten the point of what was happening onscreen if the music hadn't been so obviously shoving it into our faces. Nonetheless, ONE FROM THE HEART is better than its reputation suggests, even if it isn't right up there with the best of Francis Coppola's films.

Unappealing leads, uninteresting visuals, inept script, shoddy direction.  What was the point of recreating the Vegas strip on a soundstage when the real one would suffice?  Tom Waits contributes a semi-interesting soundtrack that acts as a greek chorus to what's going on but it's completely wasted.  Maybe the only other thing noteworthy is Teri Garr's gratuitous nude scenes.  Debacle and misfire would be the adjectives to best describe this enterprise.",1241308800,4,744,5.353448275862069

I bought the album because the Tom Watts and Crystal Gayle soundtrack was just so captivating and bluesy ( maybe it was the music and not Terri Garr you think?) Or perhaps it's just an unconventional telling of an ordinary tale with visually amazing sets. Definitely a ""character piece"" ( no action what so ever ).

213088,2,6300134865,"ONE FROM THE HEART (1982) iill attract a viewership on account of
Francis Ford Coppola's fame, or perhaps from its talented, sincere
cast, comprising Nastassja Kinski, here shown very young, with a
ballerina's physique, yet still very green in her emotional, human
aspects ons screen.

What works best, is the strong dream-like atmosphere that it brings
forth, taking viewers into another dimension, and the romanticism of
the actual story. Indeed, after 5 years in a monogamous
relationship, as each partner consciously grows older, seeing each
other turning into furniture so to speak, this aging and boredom
stress-tests each partner into finding out who they are, what they
are they made of, their character, what is the key to happiness.

For the girl, played superbly by Teri Garr, (in fine physical
shape), with a mature yet youthful, realistic approach in her
acting, happiness is a husband singing, dancing, going to a remote
tropical resort, in sum, the presence of romanticism. For the man,
Frederic Forrest, happiness is maintaining a routine, living
day-to-day, with limited ambition or possibilities of variance in
the agenda, paying the bills on time, seeing reality.

There are multiple aspects that bring the picture down. The first,
and foremost, is the astounding lack of subtlety in the ""crooner""
song numbers, such that the audience is left with the impression
that the story, and the singing revolving about ""feelings"" and ""lack
of utopic, perfect love"" is onanistic,  an irritation. There is a
whining attitude, over-the-top, deranged singing, reminscient of
Barbara Streisand's hysterical ""Woman in Love"" for example.

Secondly, the opening and closing credits, publicize the Zoetrope
Studios, as if this means anything to the audience in the US, Canada
or around the world. It's silly.

Third, the exteriors, backdrops filmed of many kinds (sunset,
sunrise, simulated motel and streets) are blatantly and obviously
fake, as the audience can see it's a studio, not the real thing.
Only a photographer can prefer a set like this to the real thing,
filmed in a neighborhood. Simply  because there is ""no dust"" or
""photographic imperfections"" of any kind, doesn't mean Zoetrope was
better because it's made in a sterile, artificial room vs. the real
thing.

Fourth, the real shocker, and unrealistic aspect, is the complete
lack of moral, religous dimension to the behavior of the characters,
including Raul Julia, who seduces Garr, much like Kinsky seduces
Forrest.  The film suggests people are zombies, only obeying to a
""master"",  an internal compass instructing them to maximize and
reach a ""utopic, supreme level of pleasure, happiness, excitement""
as if human life was only about a day at the amusement park,
figuring out which ride is the most fun.

Fifth, although some may disagree, over 90 mins, over and over
again, the actors and actresses are shown either dressing up or
taking their clothes off, with frequent upper nudity of both Kinsky
and Garr, and when not the case, in pajamas, intimate night wear,
underpants or stockings. This brings forth an intimate setting with
the audience, and sensuality (as does Garr's lovely red dress, on
her figure), but there is an unsettling, queasy voyeuristic aspect
to this.

As for Julia, he's clearly in supreme form, slim, youthful,
energetic, charismatic, and enjoying every moment, especially the
scenes filmed with the crowds in the street. A fair bit of humor is
present, such as Julia's stint as a waiter.

Overall, this picture is very human, feminine in its outlook,
showing how people in relationships  yearn for a romantic ideal, a
supreme happiness, a utopia, to the point of one night stands.",1183248000,,3681,5.175084175084175
213089,5,6300134865,"Back in the '80s I was fond of telling people this was my favorite movie of all time. (Well, maybe in a tie with The Wild Bunch) but the years passed and I suspected that like so much of what I valued then, I would now see this movie in a much harsher light.

Boy, was I wrong!  I remain baffled by the way Coppola was mocked and vilified for hurling his whole creative (and financial) being into this little dream of his.  But it remains a beautiful dream.  While at once creating vivid, indelible characters so perfectly flawed as to resemble no one and everyone, it functions as a sort of second chance for Adam & Eve.  Yielding to temptation, Hank and Frannie ultimately learn what matters most.  I still end up in tears.  Tears of redemptive joy.

Needless to say, Tom Waits' music functions beautifully as wry commentary on the ill-fated blunders of the principals.  Waits here is at the peak of his powers as heir to the great American songwriter tradition.  This is before he wandered off to the junkyard to pursue the ghost of Harry Partch.

In an era that scorns the very concept of beauty, when film critics rave over ""documentaries"" about men who have sex with horses, this little jewel of a movie might as well come from a million years ago.  If you've loved and lost, (or won),  if there's a trace of a heart left in you, you can't be unmoved by this film.",1169424000,7,1370,4.388888888888889
213130,3,6300134865,"A huge roll of the dice that wiped out Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope studio and saw him spending the next decade churning out pictures to pay off the debts the $28m flop left him with, One From the Heart is one of those films I really want to like - to love, even - but which just won't let me. Visually it's a triumph, but the Tom Waits suicide blues score rarely works as a screen musical and as a human drama its kept firmly on the ground by the fact these characters just aren't likeable. Coppola seems more interested in his lavish studio settings than what's happening in them, with even the most mundane sequences shot like an imaginatively staged theatrical musical with intricate shifts of lighting and colour, dissolving walls and neon dreams. But perhaps the biggest problem of all is that Coppola doesn't seem to have made this film for the audience but for himself, and so it probably never connects with anyone not on his personal wavelength. The trailers give away a big part of the problem: the 1982 release stresses the Godfather and Apocalypse Now as evidence of Coppola's genius while the 2003 reissue trailer runs off a list of critical superlatives in a sternly unemotional voice: joy isn't on the menu here.

That the story is so simple as to be almost invisible - a couple split up over the 4th July weekend and become involved with new partners - needn't be a problem: after all, three sailors on furlough looking for Miss Turnstiles or a backwoodsman convincing his six bachelors to kidnap six local girls to marry aren't exactly complex. With good casting, good writing and good musical numbers, there's no real reason it shouldn't work. Unfortunately it doesn't get them. The argument that kicks off the split is atrociously written and just as badly acted - you've seen more vicious spats on The Dick Van Dyke Show - and because we never buy it for a moment the film is handicapped almost from the start. The fact that neither lead can carry a movie, is even more of a problem, leaving you with a film without any heart at its center: Raul Julia is the only member of the cast who really shines, and he probably has the least screen time of anyone in the picture. The constant crosscutting doesn't help, with Coppola cutting away as soon as one scene starts to gel to focus on an awkward one that never does. Despite input from Gene Kelly (barely noticeable) and Michael Powell (visually very noticeable), it's not even quite a musical - aside from a couple of fantasy numbers it opts Yentl-like to keep the singing as an invisible chorus/underscore not so much commenting as setting the melancholy tone that counterpoints the bright, garish visuals. The film's one promising musical number, where Julia's serenade of Teri Garr spills out onto the streets of Las Vegas, is never allowed to play uninterrupted without meandering shots of Frederic Forrest wandering through the neon streets.

Coppola's 2003 re-edit of the film does nothing to improve matters. The revised opening is a little smoother but at the expense of Forrest's character, removing all remaining traces of color to make him even more of a boring homebody. It's an excellent DVD, however, with everything you could want to know and more and offering some fairly frank insights into the failure of Coppola's attempt to ally the expertise of the old studio contract system with the modern advances of electronic cinema, not to mention the constant financing problems.

213134,3,6300134865,"After his disastrous experiences filming ""Apocalypse Now"" in the Philippines during the '70s, director Francis Ford Coppola decided to play it safe with his 1982 follow-up, ""One From the Heart,"" a modest musical comedy he filmed entirely on the stages of his own Zoetrope Studios.
But the excesses that plagued ""Apocalypse"" carried over onto ""Heart"" and Coppola eventually built huge indoor re-creations of the Vegas strip, imported real passenger planes for an airport scene and commissioned detailed, 75-footlong models of the city. The budget ballooned. Upon its release, the film tanked and Coppola's little studio went bankrupt.
Since then, ""Heart"" has remained discussed but largely unseen, leading curious film fans to wonder, ""Could it really be that bad?""
Now it's out on DVD and the answer is available: ""Yes, it's really that bad.""
""Heart"" follows two estranged lovers (Teri Garr and Frederick Forrest) through a charmless musical fantasy. The story and characters are slim and feel slimmer in the midst of the huge, flashy sets. Tom Waits wrote all the songs, but they don't approach his best work. And, ironically in light of the film's title, an air of artificiality hangs over the picture; much like the black ceiling that can clearly be seen above the nighttime streets of Coppola's Las Vegas, the movie's sugary ideas about love and romance feel hopelessly fake.
As an experiment, though, the film is interesting; it borrows the look and feel of classic musicals yet remains a unique attempt, and it's arguably a forerunner of ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago,"" but that's not enough to redeem ""Heart."" As a DVD, though, it's worth checking out for the second disk's exhaustive extra features, particularly the documentaries that explore the ups and downs of Zoetrope Studios, the processes behind Waits' compositions and the debacle surrounding this odd, frustrating movie.",1083456000,9,1886,5.248344370860927
213135,1,6300134865,"I had heard a lot about this Francis Ford Coppola film. None of it was good. I heard rumors such as Coppola had to file for bankruptcy after this. Whether any of this is true I don't know, these are only rumors I heard. But, now after this this film, I can understand why this movie would flop at the box-office. This is honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen.

 I think highly of Coppola. No one can doubt the man has directed several American masterpieces. ""The Godfather"" films, ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""The Conversation"". But there's something those films have in common, and to me, this it where Coppola's strenght lies.
 All of those films deal with people. They are character studies of sorts. When Coppola is dealing with people, rather than special effects, or plot formula driven films he succeeds.
 Make no mistake about it Coppola has limitations. Every director has limitations. Coppola has proven he can not direct comedies (Jack), horror fillms (Bram Stoker's Dracula), and jazz bio's where effects came before characters (The Cotton Club). But look at the films that deal with characters first. ""The Godfather"" series, ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Conversation"", ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" and ""The Rain Maker"". Here is where Coppola shines.
 A lot of people as I understand it, had problem with Coppola directing a romantic film. I wasn't bothered by that, because as I thought about it there were elements in ""The Conversation"" that possessed as certain romanticism. At least I thought so.
 ""One from the Heart"" fails on so many levels it's hard to fins a place to start. The movie lags. The pacing of the film is off. This is what I like to call ""coma inducing"". ""Coma inducing"" works are works that can put you to sleep for a very long time. Or they at least have the ability to do so. ""One from the Heart"" has the ability to do so.
 The characters are not believeable. I understand this was suppose to be a lighthearted fantasy, but I found nothing romantic about the film. The situations and the characters are flat. You can't relate to them or the situations they are put it. If you found that you do relate to them, you must have tried really hard.
 The acting is here dreadful. Fredic Forrest stars as Hank, a man pining after his ex-girlfriend, of many times, Frannie (Teri Garr). The problem is they have no chemistry. And Forrest is not a leading man type. There is nothing about him that makes you want to watch him for the duration of the film. In fact no one look good in this film. People such as Harry Dean Stanton, who plays Hank's friend, seems to disappear after a while. I'm not entirely sure what purpose he served to the story. The same goes for Natassja Kinski who's role is pretty much a joke and Lainie Kazan. There is no depth given to any of these characters. And to be honest, after a while, I really didn't care to know anything about them. All I wanted to know was when would the movie end.
 Another problem I had with the film was the music. It is also thought this film is a musical, but a number of songs sang by Tom Waits I felt did not fit. I also thought in the beginning moments of the film too much music was being used. Though Waits was nominated for an Oscar. I'm still trying to figure that one out. But, the Academy is always doing something wrong.
 But, this is not to say I am not able to find anything positive about this film. I did enjoy Vittorio Storaro's cinematography. He is my absolute favorite. Though, I have to be critical here again, because Storaro's work doesn't quite build up to some of the other films he's done such as ""The Last Emperor"" and ""Goya in Bordeaux"".
 Overall though what he have here is a bad movie from a good director. In other words, I wish I never saw this film.
 Bottom-line: Not just one of Francis Ford Coppola's worst, but one of the worst films I've ever seen. A boring, slow moving, unsympathetic, style over substance film.",1082764800,7,3924,4.511267605633803

There's a couple of good movies in here, but instead of teling the story of either Julia's nutty Ray or Kinski's sexy circus performer, Coppola chooses to focus on boring Garr and Forrest. The movie has gorgous sets, and terrific perfomences from its supporting cast, but you're unlikely to want to see this again and again, thanks largely to the banal, imporvised dialogue that causes the main story to make little sense.

213138,3,6300134865,"""One from the Heart"" is a typical story of two lovers breaking up, running around and ultimately coming back together, but the simplicity allows for experimentation. The stylized, studio-bound film's complexities are revealed by Tom Waits' light jazz score and Vittorio Storaro's very theatrical lighting. Both are well-served by a gorgeous, eye-popping re-mastered transfer and 5.1 mix (an isolated score is also available). Modern day stylized films like ""Moulin Rouge"" owe a lot to this movie.
Director Francis Ford Coppola's highly engaging commentary on disc 1 goes into detail of his aspirations for ""live cinema"" - a product that combines the beauty of film with aspects of live television and theatre. He stands by his film despite its failure; it's easy to see how this unconventional film flopped, but you can't help but get swept up in Coppola's vision. Casual viewers may find ""One from the Heart"" pretty boring, but it should be required viewing for budding filmmakers.
Disc 2 features a sheer wealth of documentaries, both old and new, on almost every aspect of ""One from the Heart""'s creation, as well as a special one on the history of Zoetrope Studios, which was bankrupted by the project. You can find out more about Coppola's shooting technique of 'electronic cinema,' Tom Waits' score, the stop-motion effects, and even the massive rehearsals for the picture. A selection of deleted and alternate scenes, alternate takes of Waits' score, trailers and other ephemera round out this excellent DVD package.",1076889600,15,1523,5.195121951219512

And the colors were electrical and dazzling. Eye candy in a way that makes ""Moulin Rouge"" (despite its nervous, attention-deficit cinematography) look derivative.
The DVD release, however, misses the mark. The lavish sets nearly disappear on the typical home screen. The effect is similar to watching ""2001"" in TV format.

I remember the city lights, Nastassja's new hair-cut at the time the film was produced, the characters not knowing what what to do next, all these 'pending' feelings which I like very much. Last week I discovered by accident that there is a DVD version available which I ordered immediately. Now I have to wait until it will reach Germany, I think it can be discovered again and compared to Sofia's version of people lost in big cites.",1076198400,2,510,4.378947368421053
213181,5,6300134865,"I'm only reviewing this in case somebody has read Robert Horton's review and has made a decision based on what was written. In fact if he hadn't said how great the soundtrack was I would have seriously wondered about his capabilities as a critic. I saw this film when it was released and as yet have not seen the dvd but I saw the film twice in one week and absolutely loved it. I disagree with pretty much everything Mr Horton says. The performances are great and the film carries so much warmth and beauty I find it strange as to what some people want from a 'love story'.
I'll tell you where I think the negative reviews come from. The film is ambitious in its' production and was very innovative and some just can't handle that. And people like to pidgeon-hole actors, directors, songwriters, bands etc and probably had a hard time figuring out what Mr Godfather was doing directing a love story. Well that is their problem.
If you like beautiful movies this is a must. If you don't your name is probably Robert Horton.",1076198400,29,1023,4.475935828877005
213182,4,6300134865,"If a piece of art is measured by its influence, One From The Heart rates on top. This is pure american movie art, something that get's harder to see every year. It's the result of a man's dream.
Along with The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, One From The Heart beautifully illustrates the behaviors, relations and also how beautiful and pleasant a cinema session can be. Unfortunatelly it was way ahead of its time.
I won't comment the storyline as you can read about it on others reviews.
How's this DVD? Image - 9, Sound - 10.
If I were Mr. Coppola I'd have presented this piece of art lover's with a ""Director's Version"", including the deleted scenes, along with the original version. They add a lot to the story and since this is DVD, additional minutes wouldn't hurt anyone. This is the only reason why it's not receiving 5 stars. The soundtrack is not DTS but it's nice and clear. The extras add a lot to the understanding of Mr. Coppola's passion, fight for this movie and its commercial ""failure"".
A movie like this happens only once in a lifetime. It took me 20 years to see something somewhat similar - Moulin Rouge. And Baz Luhrman assumes he had great influence from it.
Those who love cinematography, art direction, touching soundtracks, and once in a while like to fall in love must reserve a place for this loving piece of art in their DVDs collection. Go for it and you'll understand from every scene why it is ""One From The Heart"" of Mr. Coppola.",1076112000,18,1461,4.537878787878788

I've been too busy watching the bonuses on disc 2, with it's demos and alternative versions of the original soundtrack, documentaries and rehearsal footage from the recording sessions.  One from the heart is the best movie soundtrack ever recorded; this DVD lets us watch in as Tom painstakingly concocts pure magic. Suffice it to say that if you love the music of Tom Waits then this DVD is a must own.",1075939200,4,518,4.559139784946237
213184,4,6300134865,"There are so many misfires in ""One From The Heart"" that one is instantly struck by the incredible thought that Francis Ford Coppola could have produced such a lemon. The music is rich but lacking in one hummable song. The performances by Terri Garr and Frederic Forrest are...well, performances. And despite masterful camera work, gorgeous sets and the technological know-how of a brilliant editor, choreographer and director, the film itself only comes to life in miserable fits and lack luster sparks. This isn't a movie musical that you will always remember. On the contrary - its the one you'd rather forget!
TRANSFER: Gorgeous - making one pine away for the fact that nothing else in the production quite lives up to the way things look on the screen. Colors are rich, vibrant and well balanced. Black levels are bang on and there is a remarkable amount of clarity and fine details rendered throughout. Contrast levels are beautifully realized. The audio has been remixed and cleaned up. Superbly remastered sums up the DVD.
EXTRAS: 6 hours of incredible vintage hoopla that is almost worth your money. We get Coppola's extensive video journal of the production as well as his documentation of Zoetrope Studios. Clearly he saw himself as the next David O. Selznick. A pity ""One from the Heart"" wasn't the next ""Gone With The Wind"".
BOTTOM LINE: The transfer and the extras are definitely worth your money. The film isn't even worth your time!",1075248000,3,1447,4.934426229508197
213185,5,6300134865,"of all the films coppola ever created, here's one that really got the short end of the stick & for no apparent reasons. don't get me wrong, i've never seen a coppola masterpiece that i didn't like but this is my all-time favorite. sorry, godather & apocalypse. :( initially, i'd seen this film on hbo or showtime in the early eighties. i remember watching with my mom at the age of 10 & how much she loved the film. i, too, loved the visuals & the whole romantic concept here so i looked for the film on vhs many years later but never found any much to my dismay. either one from the heart went out of print or extremely hard to find as no one seemed to remember the film or could find any listings. after reading online that one from the heart was hitting dvd this past year & being re-released to theatres, i knew i would have to own this film but wasn't sure how it would look after all these years. that's nearly 18-19 years folks!! well, i watched it this afternoon (with my mom)& it looks as good as it did back in the eighties if not better perhaps & i had the same emotions while watching as i did way back then. that's amazing!! i haven't had time to look at the complete package of extras which encompasses the two dvds but i will definately take the time soon. hey, this film is great even without the long list of special features & i would be a proud owner even if i didn't get a single trailer, deleted scene, or any chapters just so i could own this film. ok, you've heard my sentimental little story so now let me give you the skinny on the film. it's hard to compare one from the heart to anything else made around the same time but the film is almost like a fairytale & there is something quite magical about the experience. from the opening music by tom waits(he sounded quite good back then compared to now)& the very talented crystal gayle to the oh-so heartfelt ending, you are glued to the screen. the story unfold with a couple who've been together for nearly 5 years in vegas & are about to celebrate their anniversary. needless to say, they love each other but the marriage isn't very exciting. he doesn't spend much money on her & they never step foot out of the house. what's a girl like frannie to do? it's time to step out to search for romance, adventure, or to find out what she's been missing. will this couple ever get back together again? will frannie fulfill her dream of going to bora-bora? watch this beautiful, magnificent film for yourself & find out. although i didn't see this film in the theatres sad to say, i am so glad i fianlly own it on dvd & will watch this for years to come. thank you fantoma & coppola for bringing the magic back into my life once again. you've made me a happy gent. frederic forrest & teri garr, i love you both!!!",1075161600,10,2784,4.254716981132075
213186,4,6300134865,"I just saw this at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, where probably the worst dog of a movie would seem great, but this was very enjoyable. I loved this movie when it came out in 1982 or thereabouts and could never figure out why critics blasted it so unfairly. Coppola had worked himself into a persona non grata in Hollywood; the critics were mouthing that hatred--that's all I could figure.
Seeing it now, this would probably fall into the ""art film"" category, but it features some great dialogue and compelling performances by Forrest and Garr, with Raul Julia and Natassja Kinski playing more ethereal roles. Kinski is filmed beautifully. It's a beautiful film, period. The music and Vegas sets are wonderful. You miss it as soon as it's over.
Rich and visually exciting...perhaps not 5 stars, but then again this film just doesn't conform easily to any rating system.",1073520000,35,876,4.846666666666667

I'm hoping a DVD is in the works, including 20+ years later commentary by the director.  I wish I had been in the right place at the right time to purchase one or more of the opening shot models of classic Las Vegas marquees (following the Zoetrope bankruptcy).  At some point you either buy into a story or not; extremely negative reviewers simply made up their minds in the first half.  I bought into the characters, their fantasies, and the mood.

7803729,3,6300134865,Francis Coppola follow-up from APOCALYPSE NOW is a highly neon-lit stylized Las Vegas musical. The stars of this musical don't sing but give stellar performances. Terri Gar with the hope and dream of leaving her Vegas strip Travel Agency dead-end job and her working class no hope aspirations partner Frederic Forrest split as they find new Vegas boyfriend and girlfriend with dreams for themselves of a better life. The real star to this musical is Coppola's visual style and camera set-ups as the film is a neon assault on the senses of the viewer. Hypnotic transitions from scene to scene as expressive colors burst from the screen. A story of hope and dreams. There really is nothing new to the narrative but the film-craft from Coppola make this a treat on the senses.,1518134400,,773,4.819548872180451
