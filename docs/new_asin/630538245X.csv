1014180,2,630538245X,"After brutally murdering his family, little tyke is transported to a new home and settles his murdering appetite when he thinks he actually likes his new family. But before long, his heart is broken and he kills his new  family. He is then back in adoption and the process repeats itself YET  AGAIN! Sick and gory thriller wins big points for style and execution but  you either like it or you don't. And if you like this, you'll like  anything.",946339200,2,445,4.525
1014181,2,630538245X,"i should say that this movie is just DULL.  The characters who tried to stop Mikey from his killing frenzy are absolutely dumb.  The kid just wins all the way to the end of the movie, which makes it dull.",926812800,2,204,4.075
1014329,4,630538245X,If you like a movie with a bit of EVIL played by (Brian Bonsall as Mikey) who is a very bad boy. Then this is the movie for you. The story is pretty good as well for most of the movie. With a good cast. (For 15+ & over),1309478400,,219,3.489795918367347
1014330,5,630538245X,"What was the director thinking when he came up with neat little thriller. It should be obvious by now that kids are just as capable of doing little evil things just like adults do for whatever reason. But Mikey is innocent. Or is he. From one foster home to another as the movie begins to unfold. Mikey will do anything to get is evil revenge at his current foster parents residents Using every trick in the book to lie about the the dead bodys in his wake. Jason and Mike Myers kills in silents,Freddy Krueger kills in your dreams. But Mikey is lovable innocent and kills for fun. Ahh. Milk and cookies and murder are is specialty. Cool little thiller to watch.",1297814400,3,662,4.434426229508197
1014331,3,630538245X,"I remember reading the tagline for the movie when I was younger and always wanted to see it. This film came out when horror was dead but the movie is pretty good. The trailer shows every kill in this movie, a first for a horror movie.

It starts off with little Mikey getting slapped by his mother and he kills his sister (because she didn't stick up for him), his mother, and then his father. Mikey videotaped the killings, which I thought would have come into play later in the film but it doesnt. After the murders, he's adopted by a new family. The film then shows little hints of Mikey being a psycho until the very last part of the film. While the acting was good, I thought the ending just sucked and it probably would have had a sequel if this film did anything at the box office. This is a lost gem in an era where horror films were all but forgotten. I paid 30 for a authentic copy and I see a seller selling one forn only ten bucks, I recommend picking it up. Not a bad movie at all.",1267833600,,994,4.123711340206185
1014332,5,630538245X,"I really like this movie about this kid is really,really between good and evil.most likely about Mikey has been a baddest,meanest,and evil little monster. The only way he gets away with killing people when someone gets in his way.this kid is up to something and no other kid like him can murder. This movie has more violent killing than the good son.",1169596800,,350,4.661290322580645
1014333,3,630538245X,"The movie stars Brian Bonsall as Mikey Kelvin, a 9 year old boy who for no known reason one day snaps on his family and ends up killing them. The police come to the house and talk to Mikey. He gives the police a very convincing and fabricated story of an intruder he saw running from the house after his family was murdered. Soon after, Mikey sees a psychologist who deems him 'normal'. He then is placed up for adoption once again and ends up with the Trenton family.

During this whole process Mikeys teacher ' Ashley Lawrence ' becomes suspicious after seeing some pictures Mikeys been coloring and tries to warn the parents of his odd behavior. They don't listen and they end up the victim of Mikeys madness along with almost every other person he encounters.

Its amazing how sweet this kid could be then the next minute hes like a little monster. You love him to death when hes good but then when hes bad hes really evil.

Ive seen many thrillers/horror films and I'd have to say id rank this one at about a 3.5 out of 5. Not bad, Not Great, just pretty good. I'd definitely rent this or buy it if you're a fan of the genre.",1168819200,,1130,4.295774647887324
1014334,4,630538245X,"This movie will keep your attention. Not a bad scary movie. Some of the parts have a little too much blood, but that can be said for a lot of films of this genre. Camera work and directing is pretty good, I enjoyed it. Would buy it again.",1127088000,,238,3.9791666666666665

1014336,5,630538245X,"This is one of my favorite B-horror movies, and i couldn't give you a reason why really. There's just something about it that i've always liked. I've had this DVD edition for about a year now and have watched it several times. The picture and audio quality are very good. There aren't many extra features besides some cast bios and the theatrical trailer, but who cares the movie is great! Oh, and this has Ashley Lawrence from Hellraiser in it...yummy!",1011312000,2,453,4.675

Weeks later, Mikey has been adopted by a Happy Couple (Mimi Craven, John Diehl), they think, He`s a happy perfect child. Everythinjg falls apart, when a Teacher (Ashley Lawrence) is starting to notice Mikey`s odd behavior and Mikey falls for his friend (Whitby Hertford) attractive older Sister (Josie Bassett).
Directed by Dennis Dimster-Denk made a Strong Thriller make Surprisingly Believable of Brain Bonsall is extraordinary good as the young Smart Psycho. The film recieve some Conversial, because of Mikey`s age in the film, when it`s came out in the Spring of 1992.

7888268,4,630538245X,"I would have given it 5 stars, but some stuff was completely unbelievable, which kind of took me out of the movie from time to time.
As i am typing this review the price is at ""$100"" for a dvd, which it really isn't worth it. I watched it for free on another streaming site a few months ago.
I truly enjoyed it, it had a lot of suspense and decent story with excellent acting.
So this kid ""Mikey"" is in the foster system, and has a habit of getting angry and even, and sometimes just doing what he does because he can. I don't want to get too in depth because it's really good at suspense and i don't want to give any of it away.",1488758400,,629,3.9606299212598426
7888269,5,630538245X,This is a good movie . I have seen this movie a long time ago when I was a kid . But I think 154.99$ is way to much for a DVD . I think that is ridiculous paying that much for 1 DVD . Only DUMB people would pay that much for 1 DVD,1484092800,,230,3.2
7888270,3,630538245X,"SPOILER ! Makes you wonder what kind of a child would result from the union of Mikey and Rhoda Penmark? I know, before your time. Not great, very predictable, mediocre performances, surely overpriced but diverting.",1473292800,,214,5.142857142857143
7888271,5,630538245X,This was one of my favorite childhood movies and yes I paid 44$ for a DVD :) it's super rare and I LOVE IT!!!,1455321600,,109,3.5833333333333335
7888272,5,630538245X,This was a very decent film when you consider the budget.  Over all very creepy and well acted.  But what I don't get was why was this film banned in so many countries when We Need to Talk About Kevin (which is a direct rip-off of Mikey) was greeted with praise and open arms.  Maybe Mikey was really just ahead of its time and what was considered shocking back then when it came out is now considered entertainment for the masses.  This film should really be re-released and given the viewership it deserves rather than being banned from viewing.,1428364800,,547,4.494949494949495
7888273,5,630538245X,"If you liked ""The Good Son"" ""Daddy's Girl"" or ""Orphan"" than this is the film for you. Great film, loved the whole cast, good acting, but definitely needs a remastering on DVD or Blu-ray release. The DVD does the job for what it is, but I expected a better DVD translation than this. It's not terrible, and I have seen much worse, but this should have been better. I wouldn't pay the 179.00 asking price for sure. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. A must have horror film for your collection. I would give this 5 stars but I have to take off some for the DVD release of this. 4.75 out of 5",1381795200,,594,4.173913043478261
7888274,5,630538245X,The best chilling horror frightening boy whoever gets his way he always gets his victims in his family to killed of whoever stood in his path. You will never know what will happen to anyone who ever crosses his away. again. and even death can come to anyone at will.,1377561600,,266,4.34
7888275,4,630538245X,I've been looking for this particular movie for a number of years without success until now. Yes i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action/ horror films.,1365724800,,167,4.793103448275862
