1347082,5,B00004S8IO,"This was really a cool movie.  I just recently watched it for the first time, and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
From the very beginning, you never knew what really happened.  What's real and what's imagination?  Fact or fiction?
Brett's acting is unbelievable.  He's a natural.  I hope to see more of him, soon.
I loved the different camera angles and especially the close ups.
All I can really say is.... he's not just a good writer...he's a great writer....",1021593600,2,479,4.459770114942529
1347083,5,B00004S8IO,I saw this movie about three years ago when I rented it in the indie section and I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I've tried to rent it again since then but no video store in my town rents it or sells it anymore.  If anyone has a used copy to sell please e-mail me at gage126@hotmail.com,1010361600,,311,3.9206349206349205
1347084,4,B00004S8IO,"...This movie has some weird confusing twists, and turns although it's an interesting movie, which keeps the viewer on their edge of their seat,  though-out the film. The script was written well, with many strange camera  angles, which added extra suspense to it. It makes you wonder how, when,  why and if the crime was committed.
Bret Michaels - MICHAEL RAINE did an  excellent job in the lead up to the climax in an interesting and believable  way by playing his character - RAINE.
The first time you watch this you  would need to pay close attention to the plot development as not to miss  the whole point of the story. You will also find that this movie is a  suspenseful thriller film. Which will take you though the eyes and mind of  an convicted murderer.
I'm sure we'll see more movies by this incredibly  skilful artist. Bret Michaels has the ability to act at the same time as  write, direct and produced all at the same time.
This movie has an  all-star cast consisting of Charlie and Martin Sheen and Poison's front  man.
...For those of you who are Poison fans (like me), will understand  what I mean when I say - 'A Letter from Death Row' it is a truly strange  film, sinister... maybe but perfectly timed and executed. There is also a  really cool CD soundtrack consisting of all Bret Michales songs that is in  the movie.
But watch out 'olds' this film is not recommended for any  youngsters. 18 + or over.
I hope that you will like this fun-entertaining  movie as much as I did, but it has a weird ending.
Is the truth all what  it appears to be, or is the conspiracy more then just a simple  lie?

1347085,5,B00004S8IO,"I have loved Bret Michaels for years, and this movie is totally up to his usual high standards.  There's nothing this guy can't do. This movie is  very entertaining and suspensful. Bret's portrayal of Michael Raine is  chilling and you pretty much forget that he's a rock star altogether.  Superb direction, and a great supporting cast.  I'm so glad I bought this!  I hope Bret continues to make killer movies and that someday he will be  recognized for it!",966556800,2,457,4.708860759493671

1347087,5,B00004S8IO,Even though you could tell this was a low budget film it was excellent. This movie could fall in the class of The Blair Witch movie as far as the money spent but 100% better to watch. Bret Michaels did an excellent job  for his first movie. I recommend it for any mystery buff; it will  definately have you thinking (and watching) to keep up. Very cool ending.,946252800,2,360,4.279411764705882
1347088,5,B00004S8IO,"This is the first movie written,produced,co-directed,and starring Bret Michaels. It is surprisingly well done and acted. The twists in this psycho thriller keep you quessing until the end. I recommend this video to  everyone.",920592000,3,225,5.617647058823529

1347094,5,B00004S8IO,"I am deeply hurt that so many folks made complaints about the acting. I played the guy in truck with the big wad of Copenhagen in his mouth. Seriously, Brett was a real nice guy to work with, and the catering was first-class.

1347095,4,B00004S8IO,"...is not this one. But this was still very good, much better than I anticipated. It actually took me many months after buying to get around to seeing and it was way better than I thought. Avoid it if you're not at all into lower-budget 'B'-movies.

But if you don't need absolute perfection and like a good who-was-framed-for-murder film noir whodunit, then this is pretty good! I thought Bret Michaels was excellent for a starring debut. Yes don't expect to see much of Martin Sheen and even less of Charlie, but don't worry. Problem is it may be a hard dvd to find. :(

There's a surprise ending but I won't tell you or you'll start to expect it. Oops!",1316736000,,655,4.45

1347097,4,B00004S8IO,"I really enjoyed this flick.  I never realized that Bret had so much talent.  Writer, director, actor, singer, musician.
The story was well written. The plot was good.
I recommend this movie to any Bret Michaels fan.",1262995200,2,216,4.8108108108108105
1347098,1,B00004S8IO,"Letter from Death Row is a very low class film that is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player.  I am a huge fan of Bret Michaels, but this movie is not good at all.",1242345600,,181,3.4146341463414633
1347099,2,B00004S8IO,"As a long time Poison fan, this two-star rating pains me. Especially since one of the stars is for the amount of time Bret spent with his shirt off. Very nice. Anyway, the other star is for the somewhat interesting story. With the amount of time it took Bret to finish this movie (I remember hearing about it back in the late 80's), you'd think he would have done a minimal amount of legal research? A lot of this is just poorly researched nonsense. Like a story written by a kid in junior high who has no access to books or the internet, and just imagines what it must be like to be on death row. The movie attempts a Big Twist! at the end, but really didn't make any sense. I managed to watch it all the way through, so I guess it wasn't that bad. Except for the Sheens, the acting is just as bad as you suspect.",1203724800,,814,4.09375
1347100,5,B00004S8IO,"i JUST WATCHED IT VERY HOT!!GOTTA WATCH IT AGAIN.WOULD RECOMMEND FOR ALL BRET MICHAELS FANS.ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT BALD HE PLAYED A HELL OF A ROLE IN THE MOVIE!!

1347101,5,B00004S8IO,Oh My God!  This movie was so incredible.  Bret Michaels is not only a great singer but a great actor too.  This definately could have been based on a true story and the twist at the end.  Brilliant!  I just can't say enough good things about it.,1173312000,2,246,4.148936170212766
1347102,2,B00004S8IO,"This movie is universally mocked.  I own the soundtrack and it is pretty darn bad, but I had to see the movie for myself.  Other universally accepted facts are that Bret Michaels is hot, Poison made some great music in the 1980's, and their music videos were darn good and the DVD collection of them sells well to their fan base even a full two decades later.

Bret should stick to his talents at over-the-top rock music and music videos.  This movie is shot like a music video, circa 1988, with weird effects and fades that are inappropriate for a drama.  As a rock star Bret is a good guy with a bad boy image, and he tries to pull that off with the main character in this movie as a petty criminal who is framed for murder.  It's laughable how he tries to tip toe the good guy/criminal line, and he fails at being either.  There's a massive conspiracy twist and Bret's character is not just fighting for his own life, but justice for the entire community at the hand of corrupt politicians.

The acting is bad, the plot is predictably bad, the soundtrack is rotten, and Bret's own hero worship for himself is shameless.  You know what?  For any Poison fan, this crosses the line from bad to so-bad-its-good.  Don't waste your money on it, but rent it for a single viewing.",1153526400,2,1275,4.405982905982906
1347103,3,B00004S8IO,"This was definitely a ""B"" movie.  Micheals should have sold the screenplay to someone who knew how to make a movie.  The plot was great, I thought it was suspenseful and well written.  However  most of the acting and production was deplorable.  Question: was Michael's girlfriend a stripper before she hooked up with him?  Because the only convincing part of her performance was while she was on stage.  Overall this is worth watching, but I highly recommend you rent it or buy it used, it is not something you will want to watch over and over.",1125014400,2,544,4.604166666666667
1347104,4,B00004S8IO,"I had heard about this movie a while back and then I found it on Amazon. This movie is very intense, It is hard for me to sit through a whole movie without getting up at least a couple of times. Not once did I leave my couch. It is worth seeing.",1124755200,,245,3.730769230769231
1347105,4,B00004S8IO,"As a fan of Poison and Bret Michaels, I purchased a copy of this DVD, without knowing much about the movie.  I found the movie to be slow starting, but quite suspenseful as the movie progressed.  This movie is basically a one-man show.  Bret Michaels wrote the movie script, co-directed, wrote and performed the music, produced, edited, and starred in this movie.

The movie is a suspense thriller about a convicted felon named Michael Raine, played by Bret Michaels.  Raine is accused and convicted of killing his ""exotic dancer"" girlfriend.  For his alleged actions, Raine is sentenced to death by electrocution.  Despite the alleged murder being video taped, throughout his trial and while in prison, Raine asserts his innocence, contending the tape was nothing more than promiscuous role-play.  A conspiracy begins to unravel as Raine finds out his girlfriend was actually ""friendly"" with some high ranking people, some of which would protect their names at all cost.

The storyline in this movie is decent, yet slightly predictable.  For the people who like to try and guess how a suspense thriller will end, the opening line of the movie is vital.  The acting in the movie is a little weak.  Despite Martin Sheen and Charlie Sheen being listed on the front cover as actors, they probably only have 2 or 3 minutes of screen time between the two of them.  The filmography in the movie does appear to be ""cheap"" at times (the murder scene reminded me of a horrifically amateur adult film, but that is just my opinion) as well as the opening credits seem to look unnatural like something some students would put together for a high school film class.

Putting the negative aspects aside, overall this was a great suspense thriller.  This is a movie that I would recommend renting if possible or buying it used.  I have not watched it twice, but I do not think it would be as good the second time.  Keep in mind, the movie seems to be a cheap production, so don't expect extravagant special effects or high quality acting, but all in all it was an enjoyable movie to watch.  I was impressed that a singer like Bret Michaels could cross over into film and put together a movie that was quite enjoyable.",1117152000,9,2202,4.719895287958115
1347106,3,B00004S8IO,Well I have seen worse. I guess it shows other talents and interests. I just think the plot was a little over the top. Dark to say the least. I would say buy it used. Don't over spend.,1104624000,2,184,3.8684210526315788
1347107,5,B00004S8IO,"I haven't seen this actual DVD, but a DVD I special ordered from Hong Kong a while back. It took me forever to find it, but I had to because I rented it when it was out and thought it was great.
Just to warn you, there is some terrible acting in this movie. However, the story is so intruiging that it makes up for it. It's too bad that most mainstream movies out there today follow the same ""Hollywood"" template and don't make movies like this.
Check it out if you can!",1066003200,,470,4.064516129032258
