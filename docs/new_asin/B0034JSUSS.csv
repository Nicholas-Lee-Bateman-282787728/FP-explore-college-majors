8388389,5,B0034JSUSS,"Before seeing Florian on You Tube, I had never heard of him. After watching a short clip of his incredible feats with a cue stick and learning about this video, I had to get it. The precision he demonstrates goes beyond what anyone would believe is humanly possible. It is like he manipulates the balls with his mind, not a physical object.

Making his performances even more impressive, is the relatively short time it took for him to achieve his magnificence. Who and what he is, is described in great detail in this video.",1402876800,2,525,4.585106382978723
8388390,1,B0034JSUSS,"The trick shots are amazing....to watch.  The talking, and talking, and interviews, are a complete waste of time.  This DVD is worth about 12 bucks and no more.  Over half the video is just senseless yapping.  The trick shots are just for show and not actually being taught to you.",1352678400,2,281,4.56
