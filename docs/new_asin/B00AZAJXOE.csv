5528997,4,B00AZAJXOE,The film was done very well - a very unconventional subject which is well worth considering.  How many couples are locked into a degenerating relationship?  Is opening the relationship with close friends a reasonable solution?,1377475200,3,226,5.428571428571429
5528998,4,B00AZAJXOE,"A tasteful consideration of sexual bored couples deciding to vacation at an island.  The men first discuss the subject of a couples foursome, with the rule that its strictly friendly and "" no falling in love"".  The couples seem real. They overcome their shyness and try a new partner. It works for them-part fiction, but plausible. Good breast nudity and shower scene.",1376352000,18,368,4.919354838709677
5528999,4,B00AZAJXOE,Nice to see normal looking people engaging in non porn activities even though most people will not approve of the activity depicted in this film.,1373587200,3,145,4.84
5529000,5,B00AZAJXOE,"This is a very well done movie.  From the title one might think that it is possibly trash, but quite the opposite.  I found it to be refreshingly funny.",1371340800,3,152,4.206896551724138
5529001,4,B00AZAJXOE,Its ta touching tribute to human sexuality and its many remifications. It is a break from the usual bad connotation of wife swapping,1371081600,,132,4.782608695652174
5529002,4,B00AZAJXOE,"This movie is subtitled, but don't let that sway you from tuning in.  The most alluring thing about 4some is that, it is so REAL.
I was expecting the usual Hollywood take on couple's sex, you know, real hot women, and equally good looking men.
This film features men and women that could be your next door neighbors.  This, and the realistic build-up to the sex scenes makes it very very sensual.  I felt while watching it with my girlfriend that we were viewing someone's private video of  their Holiday!!
The movie was low budget with no special effects.  I would like to see this movie one more time.  You know, when you see a movie a second time, you ALWAYS see things you missed!! Truly looking forward.",1370476800,21,708,4.4921875
5529003,1,B00AZAJXOE,This movie is a reminder to me about how we are much closer to the second coming of Christ.  What a bunch of filth! I can't believe how morality has become something of a rare item these days.  This movie is a total waste of time.  Once again I would like to close with commenting that the movie is nothing more than filth!,1369699200,3,323,4.095238095238095
5529004,4,B00AZAJXOE,This movie seemed like a frank account of how relationships can evolve.  It reminded me of Summer Lovers for older couples.  it is interesting how cultures so different can be so similar.,1368489600,3,187,4.8125
5529005,4,B00AZAJXOE,"I enjoyed the story, was good not quite what I expected the sexual situations were not that great but I loved the characters.",1368144000,7,125,4.478260869565218
5529006,5,B00AZAJXOE,A somewhat overused plot but with enough humor to keep it interesting and quick moving. It has a surprise ending which is somewhat interesting.,1431734400,,143,5.0
5529007,2,B00AZAJXOE,Storyline is rather trite and boring. After knowing that two of the main characters are actually siblings in real life makes this movie even more unlikable.,1431129600,,156,5.038461538461538
5529008,3,B00AZAJXOE,a good comedy,1430956800,,13,3.6666666666666665

5529010,5,B00AZAJXOE,"Nicely done, we both enjoyed it.",1430524800,,32,4.5
5529011,5,B00AZAJXOE,"Funny how our expectations can either influence us, or leave us high and dry when the real experience plays out.  The expectations coming from the title, one would think it to be a simple movie about two couples swapping.  Being a Czech movie, well, who knows where it might go?  Instead, came away with finding a story of two couples evolving into polyamory, which in itself seems a subject scarce as hen's teeth in the day and age.  I found the characters credible, with the an excellent choice of actors.  The editing might have been smoother, and the grandparents as comedy relief needed some work, but when a movie follows you around in your head days after watching it for the ideas presented, thought it deserved five stars.",1428624000,,731,4.6796875
5529012,1,B00AZAJXOE,S***ty.,1426896000,,7,7.0

5529014,5,B00AZAJXOE,"This was a light hearted, fun exploration of swinging.",1420761600,,54,5.111111111111111
5529015,4,B00AZAJXOE,"Well done and realistic portrayl. Wish it was longer with more character development especially of ""Marie"".
I found ending to be funny but rather abrupt. I would like to see a ""Part 2"".",1419292800,,185,4.636363636363637

5529018,3,B00AZAJXOE,"Title is good, but the actions are so very limited. The acting needs a bit better as it seems nothing much happens even the men and women are trading partners. There were no holding backs, embarrassment, etc., more like a free for all.",1414627200,,235,4.488372093023256
5529019,1,B00AZAJXOE,"Really bad movie, not funny at all.",1413936000,,35,4.142857142857143
5529020,5,B00AZAJXOE,Good storyline and great characters,1411689600,,35,6.2

5529022,1,B00AZAJXOE,Makes no sense.,1407715200,,15,4.333333333333333
5529023,5,B00AZAJXOE,pretty good,1404345600,,11,5.0
5529024,4,B00AZAJXOE,A happy film showing a couple swap. I appreciated the relaxed nature of the film and everyday people representation. Unexpected surprise: great music too.,1397347200,4,154,5.458333333333333
5529025,3,B00AZAJXOE,"It held my interest for the most part, but there was a feeling that they were losing the their children respect it what they had wanted to have.  Having the two wife move out on their own might have been something natural, but the religious wife should have not a harder time in what she was doing.",1397001600,,298,4.228070175438597
5529026,4,B00AZAJXOE,"The old say that good fences makes for good neighbors, haven't met the families in 4Some.  This is a lighthearted, slow paced movie that shows that everyone's life doesn't have to follow the same rules and that fences are not all they are cracked up to be.",1391040000,,256,4.446808510638298
5529027,4,B00AZAJXOE,Tongue in cheek humor.  Could have used more nudity but what is there is nice.  Nice slight twist at the end,1391040000,,108,4.095238095238095
5529028,5,B00AZAJXOE,Ultimately this movie was about what happens when couples become bored with each other after 15 or 20 years of marriage.  The two couples who are best friends revive the romance in their lives by becoming a foursome.  This was good social commentary and a refreshingly honest view on sexuality from teen to grand parents.,1391040000,3,321,4.818181818181818
5529029,1,B00AZAJXOE,"did not care for the vedio,a little far fetched for me.not my cup of tea.i will not by another on like it",1388188800,,105,3.8181818181818183
5529030,2,B00AZAJXOE,I chose this rating because I thought there would be more explicit lovemaking.  It was a comedy of  sorts at the end when the parents are trying to keep the kids from knowing that the parents are having intimate relations with each other.  The children are surprised at what is actually happening because they thing there parents are cheating on each other.,1387584000,2,357,4.725806451612903
5529031,4,B00AZAJXOE,"A fun, sexy and romantic European film that is perfect for couples. The story is clever and the acting well done. I would recommend this for any sophisticated viewer with no hangups about enjoying and celebrating modern adult lifestyles.",1384300800,6,237,5.102564102564102
5529032,4,B00AZAJXOE,"A pleasant little film centered around a rather unlikely and improbable arrangement between friends. It never digs deeply enough to be troubling or challenging and that is why it is enjoyable. It could have ventured into the heavier aspects of morality, ethics and the inevitable burden of consequences that would likely occur as a result of their choices. The characters were defined and individually distinct enough to make the plot seem plausible based on who these people are. The notion that grown up, functional, responsible people could successfully break their day to day  drudgery with an unorthodox combination of partner swapping and child rearing is easy to discount as mere fantasy. Yet, it is presented in such a lighthearted and clever way as to make it worth buying into. The scenes of the men having to deal with one another in ways they had not envisioned were amusing. The sexuality displayed demonstrated an awkwardness and heavy handedness that seemed authentic owing to the fact that being friends does not by definition equate to being lovers.
  The story moves along without ever really questioning any of their motives or desires and concludes that, in the end, women rule. Which is exactly how it should be.
  My wife and I enjoyed it because we see nothing wrong with embracing a fantasy. Watching a movie about fantasy makes for comedy. Embracing such a fantasy creates drama, and often tragedy.

fyi  This movie is obviously about sex and sexual exploration outside of the boundaries of societal norms. If you are offended or troubled by this concept, then perhaps you shouldn't view it. The fact that I have to suggest a disclaimer such as this baffles me, considering the movie is called 4SOME!",1383264000,12,1725,4.96875
5529033,4,B00AZAJXOE,"Hilarious and sexy movie. Worthy of watching with your significant other.  Well written, well acted, overall, a movie worth watching.",1382486400,7,133,5.65
5529034,5,B00AZAJXOE,"Best of its kind I ever saw. Moral point: Be careful what you wish for, unintended consequences are a B(ear). The ending was too funny for words. Loved it all.",1379376000,4,159,4.333333333333333
5529035,3,B00AZAJXOE,It's and okay movie it was excellent to rent and watch once.  But the price was kind of high also for renting.  I think this movie should rent for about 2.99,1377475200,,157,4.032258064516129

8559515,5,B00AZAJXOE,"If you're ok with subtitles, I would recommend this movie. It's not some sort of soft porn or anything like that. It's a genuine movie that deals with the sexual relationships of two couples that are close friends.",1469836800,,214,4.657894736842105
8559516,3,B00AZAJXOE,I did not think the ending would be as it was.  A surprise for sure.,1455494400,,68,3.533333333333333
