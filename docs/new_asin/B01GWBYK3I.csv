My 10 year old grandson had seen the movie AGENT F.O.X. on NetFlix and liked it a lot.
I gave it as an Easter gift to all of my grandchildren, to keep at my home.

AGENT F.O.X. is sent on a mission to Carrot Town, inhabited by rabbits.
He has been informed that the rabbits are the enemy and not to be trusted.

Agent F.O.X. is to find a precious treasure that once belonged to their ancestors,
an artifact called an Amulet  Guardian.

This is AGENT F.O.X.'s  last chance to prove himself worthy as an agent to Commander Fox,
though he prefers to invent things. If AGENT F.O.X fails, he will be fired.

Upon his arrival, AGENT F.O.X falls and  bumps his head. The town rabbits try to help him,
so he pretends he has amnesia, so he can hide his real purpose for being there.
The rabbits give him the name Long Tail Rabbit, since they don't who or what he is.

He stays with the Professor, who is a spider, that is in charge of caring for The Great Inventor's things.

During  AGENT F.O.X.'s search for the Amulet Guardian he encounters several obstacles,
that allows him to save some rabbits from harm and in turn they also save AGENT F.O.X.

It is during these life saving moments that  AGENT F.O.X. realizes that the rabbits are friends not foes.
In the end, AGENT F.O.X. quits working for the FOX'S  ARMY and becomes friends with the rabbits.

I think this is a good movie for children to learn about helping others and building friendships.

Very colorful movie and one of the best children's movies I've seen in a while.
I don't usually give 5 stars, because I don't ""Love"" things, but I did it for my grandchildren.",1493510400,,2105,4.373711340206185
