8620113,3,B00G1L6WHC,"Unfortunately, this DVD should only be purchased by the biggest fans of Tony who already have everything else he has on DVD. While this is a GREAT performance from the early 1980's(?), the video quality is DEFINATELY lacking and no where near todays standards. It looks like a homemade VHS - taped live from a TV performance. Even the audio is so-so...Btw, I have VHS tapes w/ far better video quality. I love Tony, but this was a DVD to rent vs. own. Unlike my other Bennett DVD concerts, this DVD won't get many replays...Unless you are a collector, skip this. Besides, collectors probably already have this because I think its a re release...Having said this, it is still a great performance w/ a great (big) band and what's a couple bucks after all...plus it is fun to see a younger Tony. I suggest looking for a used one.",1393804800,4,826,4.550335570469799
8620114,5,B00G1L6WHC,I love every song in this DVD.  Tony is a one of a kind performer with  sincerity evident in every song he sings.  Its just a beautiful thing to see and even better to hear!,1391817600,2,173,3.8857142857142857
8620115,3,B00G1L6WHC,"There are no beginning or end titles on the program on the DVD. Just ""PLAY"" and ""SONGS"" buttons. Though it isn't dated it appears to be from 1980 since Bennett mention the ""recent"" Broadway hit ""42nd St."".  It's a concert on a bigh stage with a large ""Big Band"" and Bennett lests some of the members fly on some solos. All his early hits "" Rags to Riches"", ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"", etc. are here along with the  Beatles' ""Something In The Way She Moves"". One weird number is a ""swing"" version of ""O Sole Mio"".

It's in color but the colors are often muted and the image not really sharp. The image is standard format - not wide screen.

I will say that the performance is good and Bennett in his prime vocally. So if you are a true Bennett fan, you might enjoy this. Just don't expect high-def.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
