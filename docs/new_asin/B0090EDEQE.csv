5200799,5,B0090EDEQE,"I was really waiting to hear if ufc would make a smart move and release a 2012 edition of the ultimates collection.  I really love the 2011 edition.  They did such a good job of putting the disc together and taking out the boring stuff.  I bought the ufc Best of 2011 that comes out yearly and I was very dissapointed because it was advertised that the disc would have 31 fights.  But these fights mostly turned out to be just clips. This is why the best of sucks and the complete package, Ufc Ultimate Fight Collection 2011 was so great. I love the 2011 ultimate collection because its whole fights from the pay per view events and even the tv events on FX, FOX and whatever else ufc is on these days.  It comes with interviews, backstage warm ups and interviews that never made it to tv or the pay per views.  So as long as ufc doesnt make any big changes to this years box set, then this is an amazing collection for anyone who loves ufc and fighting!  Well worth the money!",1347840000,11,977,4.248648648648649
5200800,3,B0090EDEQE,There are not alot of big name fights on this. Alot of fighters are no namers or the lighter weight class. All in all not a bad choice.,1385769600,,135,3.857142857142857
5200801,5,B0090EDEQE,"DVDs have a tendency to scratch because they're just slipped into cardboard pockets, so I'd recommend putting all the discs into some kind of cd travel pack to keep them clean.  Amazing fights though, too many to talk about here, but if you're a fan of the ufc then this needs to be in your home.",1382227200,,296,4.285714285714286
5200802,3,B0090EDEQE,Nice product.  Only problem was disc 17 had a defect which resulted in a loss of four fights from the package.  20 disc set lasted longer than product return warranty.,1370131200,,167,4.533333333333333
5200803,5,B0090EDEQE,"A collection of the best fights of 2012, from free fight-nights to pay-per-views. I'd strongly recommend it for any who love MMA.",1366848000,,129,4.909090909090909
5200804,5,B0090EDEQE,I LOVE THIS SET! THIS UFC SET PUTS IN THE MOST IMPORTANT FIGHTS OF MID 2011 AND MID 2012(THE IMPORTANT FIGHTS OF THE EVENT HAS PRELIMS AND MAIN CARD AND TAKES OUT THE BORING FIGHTS),1364774400,,181,4.2

5200806,5,B0090EDEQE,Ordered it as a Christmas present for my son.  He loves it.  My other sone tried to take it from him,1361491200,,100,3.7142857142857144

5200808,4,B0090EDEQE,"Purchased it for my son and if he thinks it is a good collection, it is.  I enjoyed watching the fights he selected and revisiting some of my favorites.  Would recommend it to any fight fan.",1358121600,,190,4.25
5200809,5,B0090EDEQE,"If you are a UFC fan then I highly recommed you buy this product. It is a step up from last years collection with all of the DVDs being in Chronological Order. That way you don't have to keep checking which event came next and can just watch them all in a row. Some of the Best events from the UFC this year are on it, with a mixture of some of the best KO's and the best Submissions!",1358035200,,384,3.8734177215189876

5200812,5,B0090EDEQE,"I couldn't tell you how 2012 holds up to past years but this collection was awesome.  A lot of really good fights from big and less known names.  I would guess that most of you are like me in that you typically watch UFC cards out at sports bars or get a group of friends together.  Even though I had seen many of these fights throughout the year, I learned and caught much more detail watching them in the quiet of my home.  If your into studying film at all or just want the ability to quickly view fight cards this is a great collection.  I would definitely recommend it, esp if you can get it on sale or as an amazon deal.",1357171200,3,626,4.056910569105691
5200813,5,B0090EDEQE,"I would definately recommend, my son is enjoying it as much as he did UFC 2011...looking forward to  UFC 2013",1357171200,,109,4.45

FOX has an event on December 8 2012
I hope they release this one free soon",1353801600,,112,3.9130434782608696
5200816,5,B0090EDEQE,"This collection contains Korean Zombie vs Poirer in what is probaly the fight of the year. As Jung goes into full blown Zombie mode to win the fight with the crowd chanting ZOMBIE ZOMBIE ZOMBIE. This guy should be incoporated into the next Resident Evil game. This alone makes this collection worth it.

Would have liked to have seen blu ray version of this Collection as an option. Also you get the UFC Fox cards which the UFC won't release on stand alone DVD's.",1353369600,3,463,4.511904761904762
5200817,5,B0090EDEQE,"This one is about the same as the 2011 Ultimate Fight Collection, the fights are in full and the longer/more boring fights have been omitted. Also, the behind the scenes footage and special features disc are gone.

5200819,1,B0090EDEQE,"This UFC 2012 collection is one of the worst looking packages ever!
With the same image of Dos santos fighting some scab on the inner set, and again the BIG UFC LOGO and another image of Dos Santos starts every dvd.
The inner sets table of contents event/fight listing while legible, is small stark and uninspired.
Sadly, they couldn't spare the ink to list the fights on each disc or on the same page as them, so you'll be flipping back to the beginning to figure out which disc to play.
There is nothing on the pages other than some weak ghostly images, and even less on the dvds, each of which is imprinted with a number 1-20 and the same generic octagon graphic.

The feebleness of the crummy package aside, the expected, or excuse me ""hoped"" for contents are shockingly not even there! I was very disappointed to see that entire under cards are gone and memorable main card slugfests light Hunt vs Rothwell are not even in this set?!? while other less memorable main card fights like Akiyama vs Shields are also gone from the collection.
Some ppv's are represented by 4 fights only. So if you remember maybe 20-30 fights from last year and buy this collection don't expect to see any of them.

I previously purchased 4 better ppvs on dvd which had 46 fights total, those same 4 ppv's are represented by 20 or so fights on this 2012 collection! And those were good shows like in Brazil, just too many good fights missing.

Making do with what was available...
the last year or so in ufc history hasn't been great, with an astonishing 68% cancellation rate of all main event fights, and subsequent cards with a meager 1/3 finish ratio, its no surprise ufc 132-147 were some of the poorest events in history.

With only a few stacked cards in this period, the casual buyer is better off buying several of those ufc ppvs rather than buying this soul less money grab. And maybe a best of 2012 on bluray.

That being said, there have been a few good fights on free tv, some of which are in this collection, however with this set being so hastily edited and not HD quality I see no reason to add it to my collection.",1351987200,3,2114,4.438144329896907
