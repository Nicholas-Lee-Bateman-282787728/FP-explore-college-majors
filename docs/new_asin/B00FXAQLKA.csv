8619128,5,B00FXAQLKA,This video covers an important but narrow issue for those with multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS): finding safe housing. The documentary was well done and truly evokes compassion for those unable to find suitable housing because of MCS. Thanks!,1458604800,,245,5.473684210526316
8619129,5,B00FXAQLKA,"Excellent Documentary on the impact Multiple Chemical Sensitivity has on peoples's lives.  We are the ""canaries in the coal mine"". Our challenges alert those who are not yet chemically sensitive on why it is so impoartant for us all to be aware of the widespread use of toxic chemicals in our everyday routines.  In Europe, chemical companies are required to prove their chemicals are safe.  in the US, no such requirement for disclosure on what we are using in our homes and on our children is reqired.  Those of us who have become ""sensitivie"" , as seen in Susan Abod's excellent documentary, sesrve as teachers on what can happen to any of us, if we are not aware of the  impact these chemicals can have on us. Please honor the work of this film.  And become motivated to become aware of the impact your personal choices make on yourself, and those around you.",1452124800,2,863,4.607843137254902
8619130,5,B00FXAQLKA,"I too have MCS...11yrs. or so...have moved numerous times...this brought tears to my husbands eyes when he saw the tremendous efforts that went into making this film as he too can relate having lived with me and all of the adjustments we have had to make in the search for a comfort zone.
Thankful that he has stuck with me through this journey. Thank you dear Susan for enlightening so many with your courage and love.",1441670400,,419,4.526315789473684
8619131,1,B00FXAQLKA,"As a certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH)  with a background in toxicology, workplace exposure evaluation and OSHA regulations, I was curious about this movie and as expected,  its a bunch of BS. I live in New Mexico and one of  my best ""bad date"" stories involved a woman with this ""condition""  She made me take a shower at her house with her ""special"" shampoo and soap. And I couldn't use the turn signal in the car because the noise exacerbated her neurologic condition  The fact that lay people with minimal scientific background actually believe this stuff, makes the job  for workplace heath and safety professionals having to deal  people who believe  this bogus information  and constantly complain that their office smells, they are getting sick, and want us to shut the building down. For those experiencing such conditions,  I suggest checking out the web sites  established professional workplace health/safety organizations who provide a balanced take on this controversial subject, based on sound professional research  including:  American Industrial Hygiene Association(AIHA) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to name a few.",1419465600,,1210,5.475675675675675
8619132,5,B00FXAQLKA,"This is a very interesting chronicle of this new malady many of us may be facing sooner than we think. It's really an eye-opener. I don't think I'd re-watch it, but if you were on a crusade for a cleaner environment without all the chemical attack we all receive daily, this would be a great viewing essential.",1404432000,,310,4.456140350877193
8619133,5,B00FXAQLKA,"I love this movie! I went to a special screening of it at the University of Washington, and I loved it, so I bought it! As someone with MCS, this movie is very real and disheartening to see others suffering like I do. <3 <3 <3 (hearts)",1402272000,,235,4.0212765957446805
8619134,4,B00FXAQLKA,"Told buy mostly people with MCS. Who got it later in life. And it covers housing issues too! It's hard to watch at times due to the content. But, it's excellent.",1402012800,,161,4.225806451612903
8619135,5,B00FXAQLKA,"I found this to be an excellent documentary on MCS especially relating to it's effects on homelessness or shelter vulnerability.  But also, in a broader context, this film helps educate the public on the validity and challenges of this difficult disease.  Everyone who might be concerned with the quality of their life should take the time to see this film as everyone is vulnerable to this as our quality of air, water and food deteriorate and our exposures to toxic chemicals increase.",1394582400,2,487,4.926829268292683
8619136,5,B00FXAQLKA,"Anybody who remembers the mid-20th century ad, ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" knows it didn't turn out to be such a great idea  when it comes to our health. A lifetime saturated in a daily chemical stew has created a generation of millions of people with Multiple Chemical Sensitivities. And we're not doing a very good job of figuring out what to do about it. 'Homesick' makes a significant contribution by lifting our awareness and our readiness for life supporting change.

The Homesick documentary is a remarkable fabric of stories woven from the lives of the many who deal with it every day and if you watch this documentary, you're likely to make some subtle or not so subtle changes to your own lifestyle. I watched it because I wanted to know more. I didn't expect that it would make a profound change in my perspective about living in a contemporary society where we have real choices about our exposure to chemicals.",1382227200,6,929,4.763975155279503
8619137,5,B00FXAQLKA,"I gave ""Homesick: Living With Multiple Chemical Sensitivities"" 5 stars because I feel very strongly about MCS awareness. Susan Abod and Basil Shadid have done an outstanding job sharing what it is like for people with Multiple Chemical Sensitivities in their attempt to find safe housing.

I appreciate the personal stories of the people who were willing to be filmed for the project. The personal stories with Susan's music and singing mixed in make it a very interesting look into the lives of those suffering with MCS.

With current estimates putting the numbers of people affected by MCS at as much as 15%, I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone who is concerned about the environment, their own health and the health of future generations.",1381968000,11,756,4.94488188976378
