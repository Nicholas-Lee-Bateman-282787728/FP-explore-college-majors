5970537,2,B000OYNU4U,"Too little action, too much boring dialogue & non-action scenes !!!
It's a mystery why these kungfu film makers never learn that a KUNGFU
action film simply needs more kungfu action set pieces in their movies.
Film fans these days are very discerning of the quality of the kung fu being
displayed, and this film has good kungfu quality.
But what a shame and pure waste that insufficient action footage was shown,
and only at the final ten minutes or so was the great power-packed artistic martial
arts shown. The slow-mo impact action scenes showing the devastating effects of
the blows were fantastic; much better than the 'Scott Adkins' movies.

Unlike other martial arts films like 'Raid 1' and 'Raid 2' which had lots and lots and
tons of unimpressive low quality so-called ""martial arts"" display, this 'Once Upon .....' is
great high quality kungfu stuff, but alas, what a disappointment the director thought the
meandering monotonous dialogue and the long non-action time-wasting scenes were
more important.
No wonder this film did not do well at the box office.
Take note, kungfu film makers;  do not play 'hard to get' with your action scenes.
If you can dish out great fighting scenes like those in 'Once Upon ....' , then
flaunt them on your films generously.
This is a simple formula to a sure box office hit, and yet Chinese kungfu film makers
choose to ignore it !!!
Just look at the Indonesian films 'Raid 1' and 'Raid 2' which wowed and hood-winked world
audience with its abundance of overloaded sub-par elementary school level of SILAT martial arts
sparring and 'dancing', and even attained box office successes with these 2 parodies.

'Once Upon A Time In Shanghai' could and should have been much much more successful,
but it decided to stinge on its screen time display of great power-packed form of martial arts, which
was evidenced only in the last part, about 15 minutes, of the film.
What a shame, what a waste !!!!!",1413244800,3,1940,4.802395209580839

That part before the final fight where he punches the guy in fast motion and then the guys head blasts through that wooden stool in slow motion was totally awesome.  I rewound and re-watched like 15 different parts.  One thing I really liked about this movie is that there were no guns.  It was all old school butt whipping with mostly feet and fists and then a few hatchets, swords, sai, ninja stars and a few other fun things.

5970568,5,B000OYNU4U,"Superb film. Completely unexpected how enjoyable this film is. It starts off like Shaolin Soccer or something in that vein, kinda wacky and fun but then it gets down to business. The fight scenes are top-shelf, the film noir-ish presentation makes it seem really gloomy and dark but that is not the whole message. The cinematography is interesting because it is sort of like Private Ryan in that the colors are very subdued, not the bright garish stuff common in most action films, at one point it even switches over to black and white in a very smooth fashion, at first I didn't even notice. Those of you old timers will recognize an homage to Bruce Lee in the final battle, I kept waiting for the hero to lick the blood off his fingers. And what is with the smoke? Most of this film has someone smoking, or something smoking, or just smoke hanging around, something unusual linking various scenes together I guess.

Wow, yeah, nothing but good stuff to say about this film, you'll have to back up and watch bits over again to see for sure what just happened because it moves so fast. Love it, will watch again.",1438992000,2,1112,4.532338308457711

5970571,4,B000OYNU4U,The action in this Chinese film (with English subtitles) takes place at the time when in the early 20th century Shanghai was controlled by various crime lords seeking to control and extend their territories as exemplified by many films of this type for example Shanghai Triad. The hero initially tries to get on with life without using his tremendous martial art skills but is eventually forced to fight for honour and his love in some really brutal fights.,1437523200,2,457,4.871794871794871

5970579,5,B000OYNU4U,"I bought this after my girlfriend pointed it out when we were out shopping. So, I went in blind. I had not seen any ads or trailers. It was amazing. Andy On really does remind me a lot of Bruce Lee. His basic looks and mannerisms for this character especially. I could see Bruce Lee playing the same role if he were with us today. If you enjoy Bruce's films at all, right now this one is as close as we get to those today.
The fights were hard-hitting from the first five minutes of the film to the jaw-dropping end fights. Sammo only appeared a few times and was not a major player in the plot, they do use what happens to him to move the story but he was not in the movie as much as one might have expected.
After going in not knowing anything about the film, I was very pleasantly surprised to have it find a permanent home in my collection of favorite martial art films.",1431820800,,874,4.116959064327485

5970594,5,B000OYNU4U,"I just finished watching this and I loved it. I didn't think it would be this good by some of the reviews I read. It does have some corny  moments, but not due to poor acting or fighting events, but to me it was just to build up the story(enter chinese take on humor). One reviewer(the one who said it was on par with IP man) made me take a chance on renting it, and I share his view. The main character would rival Bruce Lee in his fighting abilites. I thought the story was awesome and original. If you loved IP man, I think you will love this. Even IP man had corny moments, so that should not deter you from this movie and give you an idea of what to expect overall, but of course with a different story. One reviewer said that only the last 15-20 minutes were  worth watching, and while those minutes were awesome, there are enough fighting scenes to leave you satisfied, while having the story buildup thereby setting the stage without fighting sequences. The plot at some points I thought I had figured out, but was wrong. I'd say rent it.",1425859200,8,1046,4.277777777777778
