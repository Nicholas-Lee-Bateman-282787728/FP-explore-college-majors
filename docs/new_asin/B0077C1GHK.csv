I bought it to show to my students as this video is sold in most science catalogs. The speech is too fast and there is a lot of interpretation that needs to be done which I feels wastes a lot of time. I can definitely use some of the material, but wish they had put a little more effort into the quality.",1390003200,,422,3.9186046511627906
