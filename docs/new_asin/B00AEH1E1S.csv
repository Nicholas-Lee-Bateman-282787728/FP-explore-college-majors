5411744,3,B00AEH1E1S,"I've never purchased a tape of a football game before. I'm curious--do the BCS Championship game DVD's contain the same play-by-play announcing--Herbstreit, Musberger, or whomever--as the original telecasts if you were to record them yourself on a DVR?",1372118400,,252,5.657894736842105
5411745,5,B00AEH1E1S,Great BR DVD. Price was right and fast shipping. If you are a Bama fan as I am you will enjoy watching this game again.,1367798400,,119,3.8

5411749,5,B00AEH1E1S,Quality of replay was just excellent.  I plan on ordering the same game next year.  Will you have the replay of round 3 and 4 of the Masters golf tournament?,1365811200,,157,4.2
5411750,5,B00AEH1E1S,"As an ardent fan of the Tide, I could hardly wait to get this DVD.  I have watched it 3 times and am really impressed with the quality, especially the Blue Ray.",1365811200,,160,4.0
5411751,5,B00AEH1E1S,I ordered this for my husband. Arrived in good shape and on time. He has really enjoyed this. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Alabama. Roll Tide,1365379200,,155,4.379310344827586
5411752,5,B00AEH1E1S,"I loved watching the game live and love watching it again and again. Would like to watch with some of my co-workers who said Alabama wouldn't be able to score on the irish. YEAH, how'd that work out? LMAO!",1364860800,,205,4.282051282051282
5411753,5,B00AEH1E1S,"I opened today's mail near midnight and was pleased to find that my Amazon 2013 BCS National Championship Game
Blu-Ray and DVD order, placed 72 hours earlier, had arrived 2 days sooner than promised. I watched Alabama and
Notre Dame until well after 3:00 am.  I found the video and sound to be of superior quality on both the Blu-Ray
and DVD disks.

Having once worked as a television video engineer, I was looking for imperfections in the two disks - and
I didn't find ANYTHING to criticize. The main content is actual game play-by-play coverage (without commercials)
about 2 hours and 13 minutes in length. The only halftime content consists of brief interviews with the head
coaches as they were leaving the field. After-game coverage contains more interviews with coaches and players,
presentation of the trophy, and speculation about the two teams' prospects for next season.

Give XOS Digital a well-deserved Five Stars on this outstanding production.",1364688000,,957,5.044303797468355
5411754,5,B00AEH1E1S,"The DVD was clear and covered all the plays, including Brent's comments about AJ McCarron's girlfriend.  It was great to see the game again.  Of course, I'm an Alabama alum.",1364428800,,173,4.733333333333333
5411755,5,B00AEH1E1S,"If you're an Alabama fan, this is for you. The complete, commercial-free 2013 BCS National Championship Game on Blu-ray with a regular DVD as well. The quality is excellent.",1364169600,,173,5.0
5411756,5,B00AEH1E1S,All Alabama fans need this DVD.  It is awesome coverage of a beat down game.  NoRoll Tide fan should be without it.,1363132800,6,115,4.181818181818182
5411757,5,B00AEH1E1S,Was worried about the quality after reading about the company... but it's almost perfect! Not as clear as my HD Direct TV but very close and better because there aren't any commercials and it has the ceremony presentation! RTR!! Enjoy,1362441600,2,234,4.875
5411758,5,B00AEH1E1S,"first: this blu-ray looks amazing. it looks as good, or better, than the hi-def broadcast of the game. the picture quality is clear and without artifacts or grain. this a must-have for any 'BAMA fan.

second: i can't understand people giving this a 1-star review before it was even released. they were comparing the production company's previous products with this one before this one was even out and they could do an ""actual"" comparison. to those people i say, ""learn to wait; be patient."" there was even one person who compared it a previous release by xos digital that was on dvd. and they said it had ""atrociously awful picture quality"". i have that particular dvd and imo, it is not as bad as most are making it out to be. granted i do use a ps3 to play my blus/dvds and it does an excellent job of up-scaling anything that isn't a blu-ray. regardless, i think the picture looks fine. if you watch a dvd, which is of 480p resolution, on a hi-def tv that is of 1080p resolution then yeah, it will look sub-par. a hi-def tv will enhance the flaws in a lower-quality medium like dvd. yes i wish they'd release a blu-ray version of the 2012 bcs championship game between 'BAMA and lsu, but i guess it will never happen, so i'll just keep watching my dvd version and be happy.

third: i wish amazon would remove those reviews that did not deal DIRECTLY with the product with which the review is written. i.e., if someone writes of a review giving the product a score of 1 star due to previous products by the same company, they should be removed. as well, i don't think amazon should allow an item to be reviewed until the item is available for purchase, not any time before the actual release date. of course one could argue that this review doesn't deal directly with the product about which it is intended, but i am merely stating counterpoints to statements provided by those who entered a ""review"" about this product.",1362441600,2,1923,4.507163323782235
5411759,5,B00AEH1E1S,I saw a few reviews talking about the quality of the video and was a little worried.  But After watching it there was nothing wrong with the quality to me.  It looked as good as the HD Broadcast that I watched on Tv. If you are wanting to purchase this but your concerned about the quality don't be.,1362268800,2,299,4.137931034482759
5411770,5,B00AEH1E1S,The image quality on both discs is great.  Great price compared to the rest of the vendors who are selling the discs.,1362268800,2,117,4.318181818181818
5411771,5,B00AEH1E1S,"So... I've read quite a few reviews of XoS regarding previous games, so I was nervous about buying this one. Though, I thought it would be worth it for under $14.00 on Amazon. Well, I looked at the DVD briefly and it was the official broadcast and looked great. I was going to leave it at a review of the DVD, but decided to toss the Blu Ray disc into my PS3 and see how the quality is. Well... It looks exactly the same as the broadcast in HD from my Directv receiver. Absolutely great picture. I'm so glad I took the chance to purchase it! This is a must have for all Bama fans.",1362182400,5,580,4.052173913043478
5411772,5,B00AEH1E1S,"If anyone says this DVD is unwatchable, THEY ARE NUTS!!!!!! This was just like watching the game on my Samsung big screen TV, as usual it was a great game, if you are a Bama fan!",1362096000,5,178,3.9722222222222223
5411773,5,B00AEH1E1S,"After reading the horrible reviews that the 2011 BCS NC game got as far as video quality, I was a bit worried about buying this on Blu Ray.  But the video quality is exceptional, which is what you would expect for a Blu Ray.  I also own the 2009 Bama-Texas NC game on Blu Ray(not produced by XOS Digital), and the video quality of this Blu Ray is at least as good as that game, if not better.  You can literally see the blades of grass when the camera does a closeup on the officials.

The video quality of the DVD which is included is not exceptional.  It's not terrible, but you would expect more from a DVD.  But the DVD is included as a bonus, if you have a Blu Ray player, that's why you are buying this.

Bama fans if you are worried about getting this game because of the video quality, don't be!",1362096000,9,803,4.108974358974359
5411774,1,B00AEH1E1S,"I believe it is a must, I repeat a must that Amazon ban this company from selling DVDs on their site.  My dad bought me the BCSNCG between BAMA and LSwho and it was the worst picture quality of any DVD I have ever seen.  Horrible.  Don't trust them.  Apparently they don't care other than making a bad product for profit.",1359331200,4,321,4.213114754098361

5411776,1,B00AEH1E1S,"XOS DIGITAL dvd's are a joke.  I purchased the UA v. Georgia SEC Championship dvd which is produced by XOS.  Disc would not even load up.  I returned it and they sent me another one.  This one didn't work either.  Same reason, ""NO DISC"" appears on the tv/player.  I tried the discs in 3 different players and had the same results.  I played dvd's that I have bought (movies) and all worked fine.  Not the players!  I would like to have the games on dvd, but if XOS  is producing them I won't be buying them.",1358294400,3,507,4.1875
5411777,5,B00AEH1E1S,"Alabama whips Notre Dame 42-12, Notre Dame got to the title game on their strong front 7 and some calls that went their way during the season, Alabama after losing to Texas A&M got in after K-State and Oregon lost a week later and winning a classic SEC title game vs Georgia great pick up for any Alabama fan Roll Tide",1358121600,2,318,4.229508196721311
5411778,1,B00AEH1E1S,"XOS Digital, the company that produced this video, is an absolute joke.  Their last two Alabama National Championship Game DVDs have had atrociously awful picture quality, and I trust that this one is no different.  The only explanation I can come up with for their exclusive rights contract with the SEC is cronyism -- because it sure as hell isn't based on the merit of their products.",1357948800,10,387,4.7611940298507465
5411779,1,B00AEH1E1S,"I can't describe how ashamed I am of the tide for giving Notre Dame the beat down they never should have gotten, but beyond that they stopped the tide from having Notre Dame be scoreless the entire game. One of these days, Alabama's luck's gonna run out and have thier butts handed to them the same way they gave Notre Dame's.",1357689600,,326,4.360655737704918
