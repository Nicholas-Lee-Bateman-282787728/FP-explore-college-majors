7918584,5,B00003ETNB,"Compared to many directors/producers, Roger Corman is one of the most underrated. However, he's given lucky breaks to various directors and stars to date. In this collection, three of his earliest works are on display.
Attack of the Giant Leeches is about a group of giant leeches that suck the blood and life out of their victims. Yet, despite one victim's body popping up and showing evidence of such, the sheriff refuses to believe in the obvious until it's almost too late and the leeches have to be literally blown out of the water.
A Bucket of Blood is about Walter Paisley, a worker at a beatnik hangout, desiring to be appreciated by the customers who frequent his place of work. He gets his wish when he accidentally stabs his landlady's cat to death and covers it up in plaster to keep anyone from discovering the body. This leads to the customers being so awestruck by his masterpiece that they request he make more. Three guesses as to what happens next.
The Wasp Woman is about a cosmetics queen making a youthful formula and she tries it on herself. At first, the results are quite pleasant. However, since the formula was made from jelly that was taken from wasps (!), she starts turning into a were-wasp, who feeds on unsuspecting prey at night.
Three underrated B-Movies, three tales of terror. Back to back to back.",1414281600,,1333,4.676595744680851
7918585,5,B00003ETNB,"I love the classic, old horror and monster movies, as corny as they are by modern standards. These are the kinds of movies I enjoyed as a teenager, and I still enjoy watching them.",1381190400,,180,4.323529411764706
7918586,5,B00003ETNB,"European corman-o-buffs beware. This dangerously attractive and bargainpriced set of drive-in jams is recorded in the EP mode (Extended Play), which is used mainly on US VCRs. Even if you have a NTSC compatible machine (as I do), this tape will not be reproduced correctly due to a higher processing speed - which is somewhere between SP and LP mode. My advice is simple: get a DVD version.
And comments regarding the three goodies? A must have for any fan of tasty low-budget flicks. Also highly recommended as a background videowall if you are throwing a family reunion party.",1045094400,,578,4.848484848484849
7918587,5,B00003ETNB,"If you have the chance to find and buy this DVD, you won't regret it. A volume 02 of this Roger Corman retrospective has already been announced, so let's just hope that Slingshot and the American National Film Museum will continue to release those little Corman goodies. Unlike Herschell Gordon Lewis who directed exploitation movies at the same period, Roger Corman had, and still has, a tremendous talent. His actors were credible and his movies had rythm.
So I spent three wonderful nights watching those little pearls. ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES, directed by Bernard L. Kowalski and produced by Roger Corman, is absolutely hilarious with those poor guys hidden under plastic trying to look like leeches and sucking the blood of Yvette Vickers in a Lolita role. BUCKET OF BLOOD, a satire of the beatnik circles of the late fifties, is, in my opinion, a collection piece. The first three minutes of the movie, with Julian Burton improvising poetry while a saxophone plays a solo, is unforgettable.
THE WASP WOMAN, released in 1960, concludes brilliantly this DVD presentation with the one woman show of Susan Cabot, in the role of an elixir of youth addict yearning for syringes filled with the royal jelly of a wasp queen. What a screenplay !
The copies presented here are rather good but unfortunately there are no bonus features with this DVD I will put with an immense pride on the shelves of my library.

7918588,2,B00003ETNB,"I have to get this review right to the heart of the matter...the image quality on this DVD is what some would call ""okay"", others  ""atrocious"" and most simply ""bad."" But that still  doesn't mean I regret ordering a copy.
The three movies presented on this  disc are entertaining - no aspirations of great cinematic art here - and  can always make for fun viewing, especially with friends. ATTACK OF THE  GIANT LEECHES is the dumbest; the word ""sleazy"" fits perfectly.  And I love it; swampland monsters, jealous husbands and all. THE WASP WOMAN  is a somewhat better film with an intriguing premise but not much  production value. It happens to be my favorite of the bunch. Finally, A  BUCKET OF BLOOD is the true ""cult classic"" on the disc, and hits  the high end of the scale for grade-B movies.
No, it's not the content  that disappoints. It's the quality. The transfers are obviously made from  inferior 16mm prints despite the label's claim of them being  ""archival"" material. THE WASP WOMAN is the worst, gaining a  yellow tint to make its own poor transfer that much worse. A BUCKET OF  BLOOD ""isn't terrible"" is about the best one can say, and GIANT  LEECHES falls somewhere between. And that isn't much praise, is it? Sound  quality is muddy throughout, too. The disc packaging is a clear hard  plastic jewel case, like for a compact disc, only DVD-sized. At least the  price is good, especially when you consider you're getting three  movies.
Tough decision... to buy or not to buy. As I said, I don't regret  buying it, but it sure is hard to recommend to others. If you just want  the movies on DVD and image quality isn't an overriding concern for you,  it's probably worth it. But don't say I didn't warn you. :)
For the  future, here's hoping for Roger Corman productions on DVD mastered from  nice, clean 35mm film prints.",967075200,16,1838,4.61609907120743
7918589,3,B00003ETNB,"Very interesting DVD with three of earlier Roger Corman movies. It is
the first disk of a series that we do not know yet where it would end,
and as a first one it is presented with a very nifty menu, but when it
comes to the movies it reveals its weaknesses. The video quality of
the movies is barely sufficient, starting from the best one,
""Bucket of Blood"", going through ""Attack of the giant
leeches"", touching the peak of the worst quality in the third
film, Wasp Woman, in wich there are video noises coming in waves as if
you had to tune the tv-station better. Negative point about the
format: I couldn't find indication about the original aspect ratio,
but surely all the movies were originally at least 1.85:1, and are
here presented in a full screen 4:3 Pan&scan format, wich could
let scare purists, but however please most lesser-asking people. A
serious weak-point is the lack of subtitles, that cut out the hard of
hearing ones and obstacles foreign persons that are not so well
acquainted to english language to an easy understanding. Anyway, when
you consider the price of the edition, you will agree that there is
still a margin that justifies the buying, especially for the very
interesting and charming ""Bucket of blood"" movie.",964742400,4,1245,4.689497716894977
7918590,4,B00003ETNB,I love these movies. I've owned these on tape at one time or another and now I thought I would upgrade them to DVD. But there isn't much difference between this dvd and the tapes of these films.  The transfer is alright  there really is any dvd polishing on these like the amazing job on The  General. But the transfers aren't as bad as the Corman produced Dementia  13. I love that movie and the tape of it was better in the horror 10 pack.  anyway if you love these movies and you don't own them at all get this  pack. but if you have em on tape you might want to think of keeping it that  way.,962323200,3,596,4.0
