But by golly, my little guy has been watching this for two years now (he's almost 5) and he thinks it is the most fantastic thing ever. And I didn't buy it for me. So it doesn't matter that as an adult I (or any of us, really) did not like it. My little guy loves it and gets so excited about it and when he gets to pick a movie, he will even choose this over Thomas The Train. So five stars it is!",1386460800,,631,3.6814814814814816
3026131,1,B000YDCHN6,"Compared to the preceding 2 installments, this DVD sucks. As someone who was a young child at the time of the original release of Lots and Lots of Trains, I can honestly say that if you alrewdy own Volumes 1 and 2, Volume 3 isn't worth your time and especially not your money.

What are the problems with Lots and Lots of Trains Vol. 3?

1. The recycled scenes: Once you've see the intro, you've watched the whole show. About 75% of it is composed of clips from the intro and it's not unusual to see the exact same scene of the exact same trains 2, 3, or even 4 times throughout. Also unlike Vol. 1 and 2, the intro is reused for the closing sequence.

2. Poor editing: While Volumes 1 and 2 weren't cinematic masterpieces, their contemt felt much more organized and somewhat fit the pace of the music much better as well as letting clips flow smoothly. Volume 3 does no such thing. Every scene feels thrown in, slapped together, and sloppily transitioned. Most of the time when a song ends, there's no indication of the music video ending and being segued into the next sequence and that brings me to...

3. The low budget music: While its obvious Lots and Lots of Trains is a low budget series, Volume 3 practically screams it into your ear with the generic and bland music score. It doesn't help that practically every song (save for the intro and ending) is country music and poorly produced country at that. The previous 2 installments had low budget music as well but they were at least unique and didn't clash with the clips. Also, did I mention that the producers actually used the exact intro from Volume 1, sound effects and all although they don't match up to the scenes used? A nitpick of mine would be that the scenes used also don't match the lyrics of the theme song, something you think that the people who put this together wouldn't be stupid (or lazy) enough to do.

4. No variety: From the music to the recycled clips to the featured trains themselves, there is no eclectic mix of such a distinguished mode of transportation. Where Volumes 1 and 2 consisted of an abundant amount of everything the announcer states in the opening (big trains, little trains, steam trains, diesel, freight, and passenger trains, etc.), most of the trains to see here are old fashioned steamers from Europe and if not of the passenger type is simply the engines themselved which I found pretty boring (I'm a diesel and freight kind of guy). The other types mentioned are seen as well but they are the minority here.

While this may be nostalgia talking, even today I can pop in one of the old VHS's and enjoy them as much as I did when I was 4. I'm 19 now and while unlike the other installments which really feels like it was made for ages 3-93, is blatantly aimed at kids and as such is more fitting for them than the older, hardcore railfan audience. This isn't Pentrex or Green Frog after all.

Overall, if you have kids who love trains or would like to get them interested, I still wouldn't suggest wasting money on this lousy, Mickey Mouse cash-in that isn't even worthy of a bargain bin unless you absolutely want to complete the Lots and Lots of Trains trilogy. If you don't already own them, pick up the first 2 volumes, enjoy them with your kids, enjoy them by yourself, save yourself the disappointment, and leave Volume e well enough alone.",1384819200,6,3352,4.4852459016393444

3026137,5,B000YDCHN6,"My now 3 year old is absolutely certifiably train obsessed and Thomas or Chuggington doesn't cut the mustard. It's gotta be REAL trains.  We'd been watching train videos on youtube on our phones or computer so in self defense I started stocking up on any real train videos I could get my hands on that he can watch on TV.  So as you can imagine we have quite a few train videos and I have to say this series is probably my favorite (even after being subjected to watching it at least 268 times). There's a good amount of variation in the trains; steam, diesel, etc. There's trains from other countries which I have to say is always interesting to watch. They even got a little crazy showing cars that have been made into trains and the video reverses a few seconds in high speed so it's sort of comical. Anyway, if you have a little guy who's fascinated with real trains you can't go wrong with this video - my son would whole heartedly agree!",1358467200,,943,4.3522727272727275

3260627,5,B000YDCHN6,"Ok, when I click 5 stars it says ""I love it"" as a measure of what those five stars mean. This would be incorrect. I don't love it. It actually bores the heck out of me and is sort of cheap looking and the songs get stuck in my head. But by golly, my little guy has been watching this for two years now (he's almost 5) and he thinks it is the most fantastic thing ever. And I didn't buy it for me. So it doesn't matter that as an adult I (or any of us, really) did not like it. My little guy loves it and gets so excited about it and when he gets to pick a movie, he will even choose this over Thomas The Train. So five stars it is!",1386460800,,631,3.6814814814814816
3260628,1,B000YDCHN6,"Compared to the preceding 2 installments, this DVD sucks. As someone who was a young child at the time of the original release of Lots and Lots of Trains, I can honestly say that if you alrewdy own Volumes 1 and 2, Volume 3 isn't worth your time and especially not your money.

What are the problems with Lots and Lots of Trains Vol. 3?

1. The recycled scenes: Once you've see the intro, you've watched the whole show. About 75% of it is composed of clips from the intro and it's not unusual to see the exact same scene of the exact same trains 2, 3, or even 4 times throughout. Also unlike Vol. 1 and 2, the intro is reused for the closing sequence.

2. Poor editing: While Volumes 1 and 2 weren't cinematic masterpieces, their contemt felt much more organized and somewhat fit the pace of the music much better as well as letting clips flow smoothly. Volume 3 does no such thing. Every scene feels thrown in, slapped together, and sloppily transitioned. Most of the time when a song ends, there's no indication of the music video ending and being segued into the next sequence and that brings me to...

3. The low budget music: While its obvious Lots and Lots of Trains is a low budget series, Volume 3 practically screams it into your ear with the generic and bland music score. It doesn't help that practically every song (save for the intro and ending) is country music and poorly produced country at that. The previous 2 installments had low budget music as well but they were at least unique and didn't clash with the clips. Also, did I mention that the producers actually used the exact intro from Volume 1, sound effects and all although they don't match up to the scenes used? A nitpick of mine would be that the scenes used also don't match the lyrics of the theme song, something you think that the people who put this together wouldn't be stupid (or lazy) enough to do.

4. No variety: From the music to the recycled clips to the featured trains themselves, there is no eclectic mix of such a distinguished mode of transportation. Where Volumes 1 and 2 consisted of an abundant amount of everything the announcer states in the opening (big trains, little trains, steam trains, diesel, freight, and passenger trains, etc.), most of the trains to see here are old fashioned steamers from Europe and if not of the passenger type is simply the engines themselved which I found pretty boring (I'm a diesel and freight kind of guy). The other types mentioned are seen as well but they are the minority here.

While this may be nostalgia talking, even today I can pop in one of the old VHS's and enjoy them as much as I did when I was 4. I'm 19 now and while unlike the other installments which really feels like it was made for ages 3-93, is blatantly aimed at kids and as such is more fitting for them than the older, hardcore railfan audience. This isn't Pentrex or Green Frog after all.

Overall, if you have kids who love trains or would like to get them interested, I still wouldn't suggest wasting money on this lousy, Mickey Mouse cash-in that isn't even worthy of a bargain bin unless you absolutely want to complete the Lots and Lots of Trains trilogy. If you don't already own them, pick up the first 2 volumes, enjoy them with your kids, enjoy them by yourself, save yourself the disappointment, and leave Volume e well enough alone.",1384819200,6,3352,4.4852459016393444

3260631,2,B000YDCHN6,"After watching volume 1, which we have watched over 30 times to date, I thought I would purchase some additional DVD's for my son to watch. When the movies arrived we were thrilled, but that feeling quickly dissipated and was replaced with disappointment. I am sorry to say that I cannot recommend this movie; it is no where near the standard of the quality as seen in volume 1.",1371254400,3,378,4.492753623188406

Definitely good for kids and train lovers though.",1367107200,,277,4.3076923076923075

3260634,5,B000YDCHN6,"My now 3 year old is absolutely certifiably train obsessed and Thomas or Chuggington doesn't cut the mustard. It's gotta be REAL trains.  We'd been watching train videos on youtube on our phones or computer so in self defense I started stocking up on any real train videos I could get my hands on that he can watch on TV.  So as you can imagine we have quite a few train videos and I have to say this series is probably my favorite (even after being subjected to watching it at least 268 times). There's a good amount of variation in the trains; steam, diesel, etc. There's trains from other countries which I have to say is always interesting to watch. They even got a little crazy showing cars that have been made into trains and the video reverses a few seconds in high speed so it's sort of comical. Anyway, if you have a little guy who's fascinated with real trains you can't go wrong with this video - my son would whole heartedly agree!",1358467200,,943,4.3522727272727275
3260635,5,B000YDCHN6,I bought this and several others by Lots & Lots of Trains. My grandson whom I love dearly Loves these everytime he stays over he asks if he can watch them. We make popcorn together in out whirle pop and he sits down and watches the movie. He knows the different types of trains and sing the song Lots & Lots of Trains. He is going to be a train engineer or conductor when he grows up I just know it!,1342483200,,399,3.9382716049382718

However, the DVD quality is poor, it freezes frequently. I have tried it on several DVD/BD players with the same results. You can see some faults in the reflective layer. It is just a poor quality DVD. Unfortunately, we didn't open it until after the 30 days so Amazon will not let us exchange it.",1432252800,,420,4.397435897435898
