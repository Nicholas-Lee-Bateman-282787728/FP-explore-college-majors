""Of all Egyptian pharaohs, one name towers above the others: Ramses the Second!  New discoveries add to our picture of this extraordinary king.  Warrior, builder, lover, god.  Depicted as a superman, but who was he?  And did he really deserve to be called Ramses the Great?""

The above is the narrator's introduction of the first episode (entitled ""The Real Ramses"") of this extraordinary documentary.  (This episode is 44 minutes long.)

It has brief comments throughout by experts (Egyptologists, archaeologists, university professors, architects, engineers, authors, antiquity directors, anthropologists, etc.).  The narration is excellent.  The filming is exquisite.  The graphics are exceptional.

I will give the titles of the remaining episodes (with their lengths).  As above, I will give the actual introductions to each of these episodes.

(2) The Pyramid code (43 min)

""How did a civilization that lacked basic, iron tools produce the most recognizable, most enduring buildings ever constructed?  Generations of Egyptologists have studied the pyramids.  With new evidence and techniques, experts piece together the story of the men who were responsible and the vast resources they mobilized...Who built the pyramids, and why?""

(3) Secrets of the Sphinx (43 min)

""Perhaps the greatest [ancient mystery] is the Sphinx.  No one knows for sure who built it, or when.  It's a 4.5 thousand year old puzzle but the latest science is offering new clues.  As theories emerge, the traditional version of history is being challenged.  Could the riddle of the Sphinx now be solved in a completely unexpected way?""

(4) Alexander the Great's Lost Tomb (43 min)

""Today, a new generation of experts and adventures hunt for the tomb of Alexander the Great, the ancient world's mightiest warrior, buried at the heart of its mightiest Empire.  Now, after 2000 years, using new research and new thinking, can Alexander's lost tomb finally be found?""

(5) The Real Cleopatra (43 min)

""The reign of [Egypt's] last queen, Cleopatra, brought chaos and disaster.  She saw 3000 years of civilization end.  But her story has been buried in myth.  And almost every trace of her has been lost or destroyed.  Can today's experts piece together the true story of Egypt's last pharaoh: Cleopatra?""

(6) Secrets of the Valley of the Kings (42 min)

""A secluded valley holds 63 tombs, networks of tunnels, and chambers cut to hold the bodies, and the wealth of Egypt's rulers.  Today's Egyptologists [have] gain[ed] new insights into the scale of what was achieved here.  Can they explain why an underground world, one of the most famed and elaborate cemeteries in history, was hidden, and forgotten beneath the Valley of the Kings?""

(7) The Scorpion King (44 min)

""Ancient rock markings may be the key to understanding the birth of this ancient nation [of Egypt].  They bring to life a long-forgotten king called Scorpion.  Now, from fragments of evidence, experts build a picture of a reign whose achievements aid the foundations for history's most enduring civilization.  Can today's archaeologists piece together the world of the Scorpion King?""

(8) Mystery of the Screaming Man (44 min)

""Today's Egyptologists are still trying to unravel its mysteries.  Who is `Unknown Man E?'  Entombed with the bodies of Egypt's greatest pharaohs, his face is contorted as if screaming.  Was he the disgraced son of a pharaoh?  Or a foreign prince?  Can a modern forensic investigation finally identify the mummy [alternatively] known as the `screaming man?'""

This DVD set (released in 2014) has, according to the menu, extras known as ""webisodes.""  Actually, it is an untitled ""Behind the scenes"" featurette presented as a series of episodes.  It lasts for about ten minutes.  I found it quite interesting.

Finally, the only minor problem I had is that the discs themselves are not labelled ""disc 1"" and ""disc 2.""  They both look identical.  If you don't want to guess, you can use a magnifying glass on the small, white print to discover which disc is which.

In conclusion, this documentary inspired me to ""walk like an Egyptian.""  After viewing it, you'll probably be inspired to walk this way also!!

(2008;  5 hr, 45 min;  8 episodes on 2 discs;  wide screen;  National Geographic)
