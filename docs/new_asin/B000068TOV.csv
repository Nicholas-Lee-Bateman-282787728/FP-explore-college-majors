CONTENTS:

BEYOND THE LAW-- The company payroll a Czech mining engineer was to deliver to workers is stolen and he asks the local marshal's help in getting it back, not knowing the man is a member of the gang who robbed him.

BOOT HILL-- (aka ""Trinity Rides Again"")  A lesser entry in the series of ""Trinity"" western comedies. A man shot by bandits recovers with the aid of a circus troupe. When one of his new friends is killed, the man seeks revenge.

DEATH RIDES A HORSE-- A man is intent on avenging the murder of his family, an act he witnessed as a boy, 15 years earlier. Spaghetti western that's the highlight of this collection.

GOD'S GUN-- A strong cast, filmed in Israel by an Italian company. Van Cleef in a dual role here: he portrays a priest who is murdered and the twin brother out for vengeance. Richard Boone is amusing as an over-the-top drunken sheriff, and Jack Palance is appropriately sinister. Watch for Palance's son Cody as a gang member named Zeke.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.
