8306611,5,B001GPOU4A,"History made in sight and sound.  This powerful roundtable of Hollywood heavyweights is one of the most intelligent discussions I have ever seen on any subject.  It is insightful, informative, thought-provoking and challenging.  I especially like being able to see the expressions on the participants' faces; sincerity, passion, concern, a small degree of doubt but overall optimism and hope that the struggle will be successful.  There's obvious respect for one another and deep thoughts expressed.  I have two criticisms: (1) No women were included and they should have been; and (2) Half an hour was not nearly long enough - this should have been an hour or longer forum.  I highly recommend purchasing this DVD.",1433116800,,715,5.173913043478261
