First there was Ju-On and Ju-On 2; then there was Ju-On: The Grudge, and Ju-On: The Grudge 2. After two tribute films and three North American remakes, we now have Ju-On: The Beginning of the End, a film intended as a reboot of the series; and the question I find myself asking is WHY. I loved the original movies, but Ju-On has been totally played out at this point, and there is no discernible reason I can think of to start over again. Still, despite this being what looks like an obvious cash grab, I was interested to see what could be done in 2014 with the creepy atmosphere, imagery, and kill scenes, which the franchise is known for.

So how could director and co-writer Masayuki Ochiai, make this reboot different from the original(s)? Well one of the ways he did that was to tweak the plot, so the story became less interesting as a result.

In the original Ju-On story, the curse was birthed by the strong, negative emotions left behind by Kayako Saeki, right before her gruesome death at the hands of her husband Takeo.  Believing that Kayako had fornicated with another man, Takeo attacks and kills her in a blind rage of jealousy. Takeo then proceeds to murder their son Toshio (who he no longer believed was his) along with the family cat. Later, as Takeo is rampaging in the streets, he is killed by the grudge curse he had created in his wake. The spirits of the three Saeki members thus became part of this curse as onry.
From that moment on, anyone who entered the Saeki house would be marked by the curse, and pursued by its ghostly fulfillers until it claimed the life of that person, and spread to where they once lived.

In The Beginning of the End however, Toshio is the main focus and the cause of the curse. Wait, what? Noo. No, no. Wrong move already.

I don't think the writers grasped that Toshio was never the main draw of Ju-On, but rather a sideshow to Kayako. If ever we saw a character manage to avoid falling to Toshio, we didn't relax because we knew something much worse was coming. Its like making the Face Hugger the star of A L I E N S. Toshio is great, but the thing that makes the biggest impression on most people after watching a Ju-On film is the creepy, croaking, ghost woman; but anyway...

Like all Ju-On movies, the story is told in non-linear vignettes which focus on a single character at a time. Ill only be focusing on the least inconsequential ones:

Toshio is the son of the Yamagas. After reports of child abuse, child welfare agents investigate the Yamaga residence, only to find Toshio in a closet  apparently dead from heatstroke  with his limbs bound together. Toshios spirit later becomes an onry, and haunts the Tamaga residence thereafter. It is only after Kayako and Takeo Saeki move into the house that they get involved in the story. Apparently affected by Toshios curse, Kayako becomes unhinged, and starts obsessing over having a child. The ghost of Toshio grants her wish when he touches her abdomen in her sleep, and Toshio is later conceived in corporeal form by Kayako.
Toshios constant aloofness toward Takeo eventually leads to Takeo interrogating Kayako, regarding whose child Toshio really is. Kayako tells Takeo that he had no part in Toshios birth, and proceeds to laugh madly at him. Taeko in a rage, snaps Kayakos neck, puts their cat in the microwave, and proceeds to motion toward Toshio with a knife before the scene ends.

I had a few problems with this:

Firstly, you didn't get the sense that in an instant, Takeo lost his mind to the point of being capable of all of that. In the original, you could clearly see that something dark had come over Takeo upon reading his wifes journal, and it only got worse as things escalated. It just didn't seem believable here.

Secondly, Kayako becoming an onry in this case makes no sense. Why? Two reasons: for one, she died with no strong feelings of regret or rage welling up beforehand  she had what she wanted, she didn't have any prospects for infidelity, and she was mocking her killer by laughing at him. She didn't even realize what was about to happen until the actual moment her neck was broken. And two, Takeo killed her, not the curse; so the curse spreading to her upon her death, didn't apply.

Thirdly, making Kayako play second-fiddle to Toshio diminishes her impact when we do see her. Toshio seems almost self-aware, but Kayako seems more like a pawn, a mindless zombie Toshio likes to drag around with him.

Fourthly, Toshio isn't killed along with his cat; so the whole cat theme and Toshio making the cat sound, makes no sense either.

The main character we follow is Yui Shono, an elementary school teacher. Its been ten years after the Saekis had moved into the Yamaga house, and one of Yuis students  Toshio Saeki  hasn't been showing up for class. After going to the Saeki residence to check on him, Yui meets a deranged Kayako. She later hears Toshio humming a song but cant find him, only to hear Kayako start to hum the same tune. Disturbed by Kayakos behaviour, Yui hurries out of the house when Kayako starts violently drawing spirals in her diary with a glazed look on her face.

Afterwards, Yui sees a vision of Toshio carving spirals into his desk, and later starts drawing spirals herself, whilst marking her students papers. Eventually, Yui goes back to the Saeki house to try and solve her predicament. She eventually finds Kayakos corpse in the attic, which springs to life and chases her, along with Toshio, leading to the conclusion of the film.

Upon finishing this movie, the first thing that came to mind was how many questions remain unanswered:

Why was a character whose family was killed by the curse, not killed by said family spreading it to them? What was up with the spiral drawings? What happened to Toshios real parents? Why did Toshios ghost feel the need to be reborn through Kayako, when it changed literally nothing about his abilities or circumstances? Why was there a camera rolling in Kayakos room, the same moment that Toshio touched her? What happened between Takeo and Toshio after Takeo killed Kayako? Toshio was already a ghost, so how did that encounter end? What was the significance behind the humming?

Plot holes aside, the acting was pretty decent. From what Ive seen, J-Horror tends to get that right, if nothing else. Unfortunately, the acting was pretty much the only good thing about this movie.
A convoluted horror story, I can forgive. A horror movie devoid of any genuine scares though? Thats when you know something went wrong. Horror lives or dies on how it handles atmosphere and subtlety; but The Beginning of the End doesnt have any kind of engrossing atmosphere to speak of, and there was no subtlety where it is usually found in this series. The would-be scares seem rushed  there is little attempt to let things fester or sink in  they're either there, or they arent.

The beauty of the first Ju-On films was their chilling atmosphere, and ability to creep you out while not actually doing much, even when the eventual scare happened  you know, subtlety.
By combining the visuals of the ghosts of Kayako and Toshio, with the effective use of shadows and lighting, Takashi Shimizu was able to prey on one of mans oldest fears: the fear of the dark  of the unknown.
Not knowing whats in front of you is scary. Knowing something is there but not being able to see it, is worse. Thats another thing that bothered me about this movie: everything was too brightly lit. The ghosts just don't work as well when you can see them clear as day.

In the original films, we would often see something moving in the darkness, but we didn't know what it was; and when putting ourselves in the characters shoes, we didn't want to know.
There is a scene near the end of Ju-On: The Grudge, where the main character goes up into the attic, and there is nothing but black shadow in front of her. That alone is frightening, but the fact that Kayakos ghost suddenly emerges from the darkness, partly concealed therein, was what made my eyes widen.
In fact, every time I saw the ghost of Kayako (and to a lesser extent, Toshio) it made my skin crawl, because of its strange movements and the way it constantly stared wide-eyed at its victim as it approached.

There are no such shocks in The Beginning of the End. The film completely lacks the effective direction and atmosphere of its progenitor, and all of the scares are either bad rehashes of those seen in previous films (thus ineffective) or just feel flat and underwhelming. There were no scenes that made me want to cringe at the thought of what the characters might discover, nor at what they did discover. Even the big scene at the end with Kayakos ghost, felt clumsy and badly-paced. It also didn't help that the actress who played Kayako could neither contort her body, nor portray the expressions of the ghost with the same prowess as the original actress  things that went a long way in aiding the characters scare factor.
Even Toshio was unnerving when he showed up in the originals because of his wide-eyed stare, mouth full of blackness, and distorted cat growl. In this movie though, Toshio merely looks bored. I actually feel bad for the actors, because I feel they could have pulled it off if this was a better produced, better directed, and better paced film.

Ultimately, The Beginning of the End commits the cardinal sin of being a horror movie which isn't very scary. Weve seen it all before, done much better; and with that being the case, I really have no idea who this film is supposed to be for. People who like the Ju-On series won't find anything of value here, and general horror fans with but a passing interest would probably only find the last sequence somewhat creepy. Hell, the Korean teaser which promoted the film was scarier than anything found in the official theatrical release.

Its a shame, because even though this film was a reboot, as a huge fan of the original movies I was excited to see what new, clever ways the Ju-On curse could be portrayed in order to frighten me. Turns out that there wasn't much about it that was frightening or new.

Thank Amaterasu that I didn't decide to buy this in good faith, like I did the originals.",1461542400,,10234,4.62348401323043
8708804,4,B00UZBMZZC,Plot and dialogue was at a very high level. Creepy yet realistic at the same time. No boring fillers or inane sex scenes ... unlike typical Hollywood horror. Excellent way to practice Japanese too.,1452816000,,197,4.823529411764706
8708805,4,B00UZBMZZC,"For those who don't know, the Ju-On films were turned into The Grudge movies, but don't let that scare you away from what the originals have to offer. The Ju-On films are some of the creepiest most horrific Japanese films that create a world of suspense and terror on top of its nonlinear storytelling and The Beginning of the End is no different. Now this film is in a way a remake to the original Ju-On and The Grudge 1 and 2 with Sarah Michelle Gellar (since they split the first movie into two features) but instead of remaking it the same way, it is all twisted up and that goes for some of the craziness in store. You can expect classic black pools, creepy ghosts and murder around during every corner. I just finished it for the second time and can't get the last image out of my head. These are fun and scary ghost films that will creep you out. I just wish some of the deaths weren't so similar to the original. 4/5 for beautiful cinematography and genuinely a contortion of scares.",1443657600,3,991,4.3621621621621625
