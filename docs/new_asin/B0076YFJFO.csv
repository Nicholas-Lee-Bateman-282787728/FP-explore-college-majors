5058706,2,B0076YFJFO,"I rented this from the public library and I am glad this was nothing I purchased. I enjoyed the first 2 seasons of Vega$, but the third season was boring and slow and Robert Urich/Dan Tanna had lost his sexy, even his body wasn't in good shape and the hair on his chest just laid there all dull. I can very well see why ABC cancelled this show after season 3. It was all but over.",1345248000,,380,4.0131578947368425
5058707,5,B0076YFJFO,Vegas brings back all the tv memories from the past. The show is filled with lots of action and Robert Ulrich brings it on.,1342137600,,123,4.166666666666667
5058708,4,B0076YFJFO,"The Third Season Volume 1 follows the exact same track as the all previous releases with only half a season and virtually no special features. You do get episodic promos and subtitles. Picture quality is clean and audio is clear.

The first half of season 3 features the 2-part episode filmed in beautiful Hawaii where Tanna is kidnapped and put under a trance in order to murder Casino magnate Phillip Roth. And Tony Curtis makes a return as the Roth character in 'Deadly Blessings'.

This episode also features the Nun that appeared in season 1. Of course this set is a bit pricey for only half a season and no specials, but I am just glad that it is finally released(so many other classic TV show DVD's are stuck at a couple seasons or less and no further releases).",1340236800,3,769,4.525179856115108
5058709,1,B0076YFJFO,"I'm sure the remaining portion of season three will run the same. That's like paying almost $60 for a single season. Will someone explain to me why Paramount continues to release their shows in this manner, then charging so much? As much as I love this show I refuse to pay those prices. I'm glad I was able to find one the earlier volumes at Big Lots for only $10, and I will continue to look on eBay for a better deal. I'm not giving any of my money to Paramount.",1337817600,4,465,4.1208791208791204
5058710,5,B0076YFJFO,We almost have all the series Vegas just one more half season left after this. They should be shot splitting this three season series into two volume sets. But alas we are at there mercy. So far the transfers on the previous two season have been very good this should be no exception. A rotation of stars of the period make the show more enjoyable never knowing who is going to guest star much like Love Boat and Fantasy Island. Robert Urich plays tough guy Dan Tanna to the hilt in probably what is considered the most violent season of the series. A little bit of trivia Dan Tanna is the name of Arron Spelling favorite restaurant on Santa Monica Blvd and is still in business. Now that Las Vegas strip is so different its nice to see the city in its hey day  along with stars billings always showing in the background. Buy this volume and the last half should be not to far away. Seems like Vegas is selling well. Robert Urich really looked great at this time hard to believe he's gone but his work lives on with these dvds.,1330560000,10,1027,4.321243523316062
5058711,5,B0076YFJFO,"I am very happy to see this being released.
I was sure CBS would deny us the full series.
Thanks",1330387200,3,96,3.85
5058712,4,B0076YFJFO,"Although ""Vega$"" was another glossy, cookie-cutter detective show from Aaron Spelling it still has its inherent charms, although it would be cancelled at the end its third season when ABC purged itself of its long-time Wednesday night hits including also ""Eight is Enough"" and ""Charlie's Angels"".

Thankfully, CBS has managed stick with this show and while the split-seasons at full-cost have remained a point of contention for many, I never thought we'd get this far. ""Vega$"" must be selling well-enough and I really can't see CBS abandoning it at this point with only a half-season left to go.

Robert Urich WAS the show and carrying it rests squarely on his capable shoulders, but the guest stars were almost as much of the reason for success here as they were on Spelling's anthology series (""Love Boat"", ""Fantasy Island"", ""Hotel""). This 1/2 season includes big-screen/small-screen legends such as Lorne Greene, Pernell Roberts, John Saxon, Julie Adams, Patrick MacNee, June Lockhart, Eleanor Parker, Gary Lockwood, Barbara Parkins, Victor Buono, Dick Sargent, Jill St. John, Don Stroud and Edie Adams. Then-current stars like Jill Whelan, Erin Gray, Lindsay Bloom, Stephen Shortridge also show up as well as some yet-to-be-big actors like Stepfanie Kramer, Priscilla Barnes and Joe Penny.

Not as fresh or enjoyable as Season 1 because smart-mouthed but motherly Naomi Stevens and bodacious Judy Landers are missing in action, but still fluffy, escapist fun. I recommend picking up this one up for a flashback to Sin City at the dawn of the totally awesome '80s.

Four stars.",1330128000,18,1580,5.208661417322834
5058713,5,B0076YFJFO,"I find these series very enjoyable and highly entertaining. The sound and image are just excellent. The plots are good too. Of course there is some goofs, like in the first episode (Aloha you're dead) Tony Curtis is listed on the credits, but actually he never shows up. Also in a couple episodes the cameraman is clearly visible. Anyway this is a great finale for a worthy TV series. There's no times like the old times",1432425600,,420,4.5394736842105265

5058722,4,B0076YFJFO,"For a TV show from the 80's, the video quality is absolutely outstanding. As far as I'm concerned, it's as good as High Definition.  A great TV series.  We never missed an episode each week.  Some plots are a little goofy, but this is much better than anything else on the networks today.  Only FOUR stars because they split the 3rd season into two volumes.  High recommended for quality and content.",1411776000,,400,4.577464788732394
5058723,2,B0076YFJFO,"Hokey, overacted, and full of women who are helpless an in need of rescue by Dan Tanna...Las Vegas itself is the real star of the show, and she is at her 1970's best!",1405382400,,166,4.0606060606060606

5058726,5,B0076YFJFO,"I remember Wednesday nights and I was glued to the TV to watch my favorite detective, Dan Tanna on ABC. Now I have him on DVD and can watch him anytime I desire. Shows are sharp and clear and the color and sound are great. Love having uncut commercial free episodes of the original series. Love having Dan, Benzer, Bea, and Phillip Roth back together again. A must have for every Dan Tanna Vega$ fan.",1358035200,,400,4.346666666666667
5058727,5,B0076YFJFO,"This has always been one of my favorite shows. Not too crazy about Paramount dollling episodes out in half season sets like this, but you take what you can get.
This show had some very slight influence on the novel, LAS VEGAS BANDITS.",1356566400,2,234,4.465116279069767
5058728,3,B0076YFJFO,"The first two seasons of Vega$ had excellent writing & acting.  The writing & acting unfortunately went downhill in the third season.  That first 2-hour episode (with Lorne Greene & Pernell Roberts guest starring) was especially silly; the plot, the acting & the lines just made me shake my head in disgust.  Things got better with the following episodes but it was easy to see why the show was cancelled after that.",1354838400,,416,4.75
5058729,5,B0076YFJFO,I WAS ALWAYS A VEGAS FAN. I WATCHED IT WHEN IT WAS FIRST ON TV. SINCE THE SHOW CAME OUT IN 78 AND I MADE MY FIRST TRIP TO VEGAS IN 78 IT WAS A NATURAL. NOW THE SHOW BRINGS BACK ALOT OF WONDERFUL MEMORIES. THIS IS A GREAT SHOW FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE LAS VEGAS BUT WERE NOT THERE 35 YEARS AGO. THE PLACE HAS REALLY CHANBED.,1352592000,,318,3.6911764705882355
5058730,4,B0076YFJFO,"Excited to see the final season of Vegas which was one of my favs in High School. Dan had the first car phone I ever saw and love seeing old Vegas especially the DI which was the best. I started going to Vegas in '78 and I do not remember gas stations on the strip. Stories are corny and of course Dan is too cool for school but over 30 years later girls still want him and men want to be like him. What happened to Tony Curtis who was great as ""Slick"" but appears less and less as the series went on. Rumer has it a major ""coke problem"" led to him being squeezed off the show. WHile the strip is totally different , if you put the lights over Freemont Street, it pretty much looks exactly the same. Why didn't Dan ever nail Bea?  I'm just saying I never kissed my assistant on the lips when I got to the office. I will before I die have a house that I can park my car in just like Dan. A '55 Tbird wouldnt be bad either.",1349740800,2,921,3.898936170212766

5058732,5,B0076YFJFO,"Full of glitzy intrigue, glamour, action, car chases, gun battles, murder, mystery, and sexy actors, all set amongst the wild and flashy casinos of Las Vegas--the detective-drama ""VEGA$"" was an immediate hit! ""VEGA$"" introduced TV audiences to suave but tough, no-nonsense private detective Dan Tanna in April of 1978. Tanna drove a bright red 1957 Ford Thunderbird Convertible throughout the ritzy streets of Vegas, chasing and taking down the bad guys who dared to try and ""darken"" the dazzling world of gambling and showbiz. Helping Dan are Bea Travis--Dan's loyal secretary & friend, Binzer--a goofy but devoted leg-man, Angie Turner--a somewhat ditzy but loveable assistant to Bea, Philip ""Slick"" Roth--Dan's eccentric millionaire casino boss, Twoleaf--a Native American friend of Dan's with some extra muscle, Lt. Dave Nelson & Sgt. Bella Archer from the LVPD, as well as a few other interesting friends, con-people, and tons of famous guest-stars. This set contains the first several episodes of the 3rd and final season. For some unexpected reason the series was cancelled after this season. They don't make shows like this anymore--shows that actually entertain you and are fun to watch...unlike most of the sick, twisted, and perverted garbage that's put on today! For those who miss the ""good"" days of TV, or for those just discovering it, this TV series is a must!",1347667200,2,1376,5.230769230769231

I was not disappointed.  Great action and story lines without all the dark gore and blood that is so overdone in today's crime dramas.
