8091232,5,B000BQYX24,"''Like an Azalea flower, floating helpless in the strong current of the river...'' goes the song specially composed for Ms Aguirre in this movie by the Master Manuel Espern.
And is true. Her beauty was fragile and delicate as a flower, and her destiny was not in her hands, so one day she decides to commit suicide. Drowning herself fails when a native (who lives in that small fishermen village with his wife and son) finds and rescues her. But the family, once happy in their everyday chores, gets turned upside down with her unsettling presence.
Azalea is saddened seeing that, since she never meant to do any harm. However, she can not control the man of the house feelings towards her, which cause his wife to hate her and the son to wish he was older. The only way out is not an easy one.
Based on the novel of hungarian writer Lajos Zilahy,and directed by Alfredo B. Crevenna, this is truly a classic.
Somewhat similar is SUSANA by Buuel, but Susana is crazy and she knows what she does and why she does it... evil woman!",1316649600,,1028,4.473404255319149
8091233,4,B000BQYX24,"Arturo de Cordova made several films in Hollywood during the 1940s, the most memorable being ""Frenchman's Creek"" (1944) with Joan Fontaine, but his best films were made in Mexico, where he was a big star. He was 40 years old when he made ""Algo Flota Sobre el Agua"" (""Something Floats Over the Water""), and though it's not a great film, it's a highly entertaining love triangle, set in the steamy tropical Vera Cruz area. He plays Miguel, who brings his beautiful blonde city-girl wife Carmina (Amparo Morillo) and their small son back to the fishing village where he grew up, only to find that his family house has been destroyed by his father's enemies. As his father was hated, neither is Miguel accepted by his fellow fishermen, making life harsh for him and his wife, but he tells her, ""As long as I have strength, you won't suffer.""  One day he hears screams of ""Algo flota sobre el agua,"" and it is the gorgeous Azalia (Elsa Aguirre), floating like an unconscious siren as she drifts though the water. Miguel rescues her, and so begins the tale of an impossible passion.

Directed by Alfredo Crevenna, with atmospheric cinematography by Agustin Martinez Solares, the Manuel Esperon soundtrack has many wonderful songs, as well as a traditional folkloric wedding dance. The film also has the theme of the struggles of the poor and the abuses they endure from ""el patron.""

There is a 2 disc set available in some stores (for a nice price) that couples this film with the terrific ""La Devoradora,"" a classic starring Maria Felix. This set is a wonderful bargain, and both films are in excellent condition for their age. They do not have subtitles however, which if your Spanish is up to par, makes viewing even more enjoyable.",1174435200,2,1730,4.76
8091234,4,B000BQYX24,"This interesting film was shoted in 1947. The same year, that Arturo de Cordova filmed another monster production called: ""La Diosa Arrodillada"" with Maria Felix. The reason for what I'm reminding this film it's because against ""La Diosa..."", ""Algo Flota Sobre el Agua"" shows the kind of films where Arturo always interpreted the starring rolls between wild selvatic landscapes: Veracruz is the scenary in this picture, where Manuel (Arturo de Cordova) married with Carmina; fell in love with a precious young girl called ""Azalia"" (Elsa Aguirre), who intented suicide in the river near Manuel's house... The play roll shows the regular problems and circumstances of a group of fishers that tried to make an independent living without the rules of the owner. The film has an approximated running time of 120 minutes. Maybe too long for that decade... Good Luck!",1145491200,3,860,5.15
