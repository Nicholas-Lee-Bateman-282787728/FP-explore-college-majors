2460140,5,B000CELOVI,"I LOVED this show when it was on the air.

I was thinking about it the other day... thinking how I need to buy it. Then I thought it must be on DVD since so many shows are now.

I'm so happy it's being released next month! It's now on my must buy list.",1136332800,3,252,3.6481481481481484
2460141,3,B000CELOVI,"So like many young girls I used to have a serious crush on Scott Baio, although I discovered the show when i was a teenager in the late 90's in reruns.

The show is goofy and doesnt have intelligent humour, but it can be hysterically funny at times, because it never took itself seriously. Scott plays Charles ( he doesnt have a last name), who takes care of the Pembroke family's children Jason  (a rembuncious young boy), Douglas ( a very odd teenager who is intersted in the other planets, since he was probably hatched on it), and Lila a typical young girl.

The reason why this season gets 3 stars is because, although it introduces Charles and his good natured but quite dumb friend Buddy to the audience, Scott Baio has absolutley no chemistry with the actors, and it shows making this the worst season to get. If you want honestly funny episodes wait until season 2 and 3 come out, with a whole new family the Powel's where the fun really begins.",1135641600,8,954,4.471264367816092
2460142,5,B000CELOVI,i am so happy this is coming out on DVD. I use to watch the show all the time. It is a great 80's show. It may be cheesy and people may talk bad about the show but you know they were watching it in the 80's.,1135468800,6,207,3.425531914893617
2460143,5,B000CELOVI,"Charles in Charge was originally a vehicle for Scott Baio as a followup to his character Chachi from Happy Days - in fact there are several suggestions (mother a Travolta, Italian background) that Charles is the good alter ego of Chachi.  This subversive approach to reality is followed in the Charles series, most evident in the manner in which it plays on the persona of Scott.  Most revealling is a splendid epilogue in which Baio and Willie Aames (later to udertake a (mercfully brief) career as a beefcake in a Blue Lagoon cash-in)discuss, out of character, their characters. This was, of course, years before the vogue for post modern deconstructions of the fourth wall in Gary Shandling's Show (etc), but fully in the tradition of vaudiville and its televisual successors such as Greenacres (qv).

Despite this, Charles in Charge is not revolutionary and follows the rather basic conventions of US sitcoms (live audience, sofa as hearth, agreeable everyman protagonist, wacky sidekicks, vaguely unattainable romantic interest).  It also features the worst of 80s' fashions: pastel polo shirts, mediorcre tailorings.  It is conservative in tone, promoting the fundamental American interests of bounded tolerance and communual advancement through restrained self-interest.  Several soon-to-be stars feature, including Meg Ryan and Matthew Perry, but the true star is Scott Baio, whose amiability makes the bland Charles an identifiable ideal.

Charles in Charge - the catchy theme song's sexual undetones should not be overplayed, even though (pace other reviewers)there is little doubt that this show is imbued with the sexual frisson one would expect of a program focused on a young college student - is one of the top situation comedies, almost perfectly embodying the genre's  raion de-etre of moral edification.  It also features the brilliant riposte to a particularly obtuse interlocutor: 'It's like talking to lint'.",1134777600,5,1929,5.403333333333333
2460144,5,B000CELOVI,THE MOST FUNNIEST TV SHOW OF THE 1980'S. THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY GREAT TO FINALLY OWN THIS GREAT TV SERIES ON DVD FOR THE FIRST TIME. I HOPE THEY PLAN TO RELEASE MORE SOON. MARTY.,1133654400,4,182,3.945945945945946
2460145,5,B000CELOVI,"Not only did I watch this show for Scott Baio, but because it was really funny (back in the day).  This was excellent and very entertaining.  I love the theme song as well.  Charles comes to stay with his charges and mishap and mayhem ensue in each episode.  I'm certainly going to get this not only for old times sake, but I know I'm going to love it all over again.  And to D James - I am not mentally deficient, you just don't know a good show when it hits you.
Look for a very young Meg Ryan in the third episode, Christina Applegate in Slumber Party and Mathew Perry on the 3rd disc in the Bachelor Party episode.",1133568000,7,618,4.116666666666666

2460147,5,B000CELOVI,Fianlly Charles IS in Charge of DVD!!! I have been waiting for this great show to come to DVD. It was one of my favorite week night shows. It was always funny and a great time to spend with my brothers. Charles in Charge was a good show in the fact that it was a show you could watch with your parents in the room and not worry about something said on the show that would make your mom make you turn it off. Can't wait for Charles to be in Charge of my DVD player!! Way Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1133222400,9,488,3.989795918367347

2460163,4,B000CELOVI,This 3-disc set has all the episodes from the first season of Charles in Charge minus any special features or commentaries. Picture and audio quality is pretty good. For me watching this again is hit and miss as some episodes are fun and others I can barely stomach. The first season features the Pembroke family(their only season) and the dynamic is a lot different as compared to the latter seasons with the Powells. And the price on Amazon is pretty good at around ten bucks.,1436832000,,478,4.635294117647059

2460167,1,B000CELOVI,I ordered the trick or treat episode of season one but when it plays two odd things were found one it is actually an episode about an election so the title doesn't match and when we turned on the closed caption the words on the screen are from what is obviously the halloween episode according to the captions and the fact that the captions don't match whats is being spoken.

2460201,5,B000CELOVI,This show has five seasons in it and this one introduces you to the character Scott Baio is playing. This family didn't last through the remaining seasons. Neither did Gwendolyn. I am not sure why they changed them but there is still fun and adventure through out this season. I would recommend this to anyone who has children.,1282608000,,327,4.655172413793103
2460202,5,B000CELOVI,"I have Likes and Dislikes about both versions. I originally started watching back then because of Scott Baio. He and Willie Aames are the best of the show. It doesn't matter to me which family as long as they are on. I like Stan, Jill, and Ellen. I think Jamie and Sarah are better than Lila. I like Jason and Adam the same. I can't stand Douglas. He acts like he is in need of severe counseling.
Paula Thacker also is in need of severe counseling. I don't like
Walter Powell any more than Grandma Pembroke. I could do without either one of them. One thing I wish the writers had done was show a flashback episode showing how Charles got his job with the Pembrokes. Showing him applying for the job and everything. We know how he started working for the Powells, but not the Pembrokes. On the episode ""Date With Enid"" everyone acts like Douglas doesn't judge by outward appearance, but he did. He only like her the way she was, judging soley by her appearance, what appearance he wanted her to have. If he wasn't judging by appearance he would have liked her either way, but he didn't. On episode ""Discipline"" I would have flunked Douglas too. I also wouold have flunked his other papers about having a summer vacation on Venus and his being a fictional
character. It would of been different is his assignment had been about a fantasy summer vacation or writing about anyone he wants and no mention about fictional. The only way writing about the TV Guide would have been acceptable to me would have been if he asked the teacher in advance and she had said yes.",1274572800,,1561,4.461538461538462
2460203,5,B000CELOVI,I don't really remember seeing many episodes from this season as I was pretty young when it originally aired. So before buying this first season I didn't think I would like it much or as much as the other seasons. Because their is a different cast. However after watching the first season I was sad to see the original cast go and the series bringing in a mostly new cast. A bonus for fans of the first season cast only this set does include the first episode of the 2nd season that has the youngest kid and the mom. Sad thing about it the lady who played the mom in season 1 wouldnt come back to do the 1st episode of the 2nd season.,1264809600,,634,4.120967741935484
2460204,4,B000CELOVI,"Charles in Charge - The Complete First Season isn't perfect but it's not a big deal because this classic '80s show is pure joy. Scott Baio stars as Charles, a College student who takes a job as a live-in babysitter. The family in the first season is pretty lame, so glad they get rid of them after this season. I prefer The Powell family, better chemistry I guess. Willie Aames is hilarious as Charles best pal, Buddy. Great show, brings back a lot of bittersweet memories for me.",1239494400,,480,4.465909090909091
2460205,5,B000CELOVI,"I love watching all the old episodes.  If you were a child of the 80's and loved to watch Happy Days and Charles in Charge, then you will love these... Scott Baio is sooooo cute!!  And I love the fact that the corkiness is so innocent and real.  Total nostalgia.",1234656000,,262,4.2
2460206,4,B000CELOVI,"Scott Baio stars as the title character, a college freshman trying to juggle the costs of school by working as a live-in caregiver for the three adolescent Pembroke children in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

Willie Aames provides comedy relief as his constant sidekick, goofy buddy, as well as Charles' beautiful on-again, off-again girlfriend Gwendolyn (Jennifer Runyon).

Memorable episodes include ""War,"" where a very young Meg Ryan guest stars as a potential nanny shadowing Charles around the Pembroke home for the day; ""A Date With Enid,"" where geeky older son Douglas falls head over heels for his sister's shy (and also geeky) classmate; and ""Home for the Holidays,"" where Grandma Irene (guest star Rue McClellahan of ""Golden Girls""), not accustomed to having anyone else to vie for the children's affection, clashes with Charles over who's really in charge.

As a bonus feature, the box set includes a sneak peek into Season 2, when the Pembrokes have moved away and been replaced by a new family, the Powells.

Viewers will enjoy this family-friendly show, full of light-hearted humor and coming-of-age lessons, just as relevant today as in the '80s.",1232841600,,1157,5.171122994652406
2460207,5,B000CELOVI,"The first season i feel was better than season 2 , charles seems to care more about the kids and the family to me in this season of charles in charge, and more like himself than he dose in season 2, all thought buddy i think better in the second season than the first,",1206230400,,268,3.9814814814814814
2460208,5,B000CELOVI,"I ran into this on Amazon while looking at old t.v. series that had come out on DVD.  I added it to my Wish List and ended up getting it for my birthday.  I was a little skeptical if I would still enjoy something like this, so many years later.  I also couldn't quite remember any episodes, only that I enjoyed it as a kid.  After the first episode my fiance and I were hooked!  She is younger than me, so I don't think she had ever seen the First Season.  By the end of First Season, we were both looking for more only to be disappointed when we returned to Amazon to see this is the only season out.  Also, at the end of the last disc as a bonus is the first episode for the Second Season.  It's a new family which is probably the one most people remember.  The First Season was a total 5-Star for us.  There is plenty of 80s cheese to remember and laugh about as well as some good family values.",1187222400,,898,3.99438202247191
2460209,5,B000CELOVI,"I must say that I love this first season of Charles In Charge. The plots are good, the jokes are funny and the casts are adorable.

I just want to thank Universal for including the first episode of the second season or I would've hated myself for buying it when it's released in the future! The Powells are just plain boring, the jokes are not as funny and the plot has lost its edge.

Too bad the Pembrokes had to leave the show. I'm really going to miss them. I like the show but I will NOT buy the second season.",1174262400,2,515,4.089108910891089
2460210,5,B000CELOVI,"For the diverse population that enjoyed ""Charles in Charge"" when first broadcast I am of the opinion the DVD will be a treat.  A younger adult when the show first aired, I was surprised when, upon viewing it again in 2007, how it impacted me how much our culture has changed since ""Charles in Charge"" first aired...I guess the best way I can try to communicate what I felt/sensed was: ""even in the 1980's were we this innocent"" and my resounding response was ""yes""...a time when theme songs were allowed to start, complete and end prior to the beginning of episodes, when entertainment on tv could still manage to be acceptable to almost any viewer in terms of content and portrayal..look, bottom-line if you watched it and enjoyed it when it first aired you'll still enjoy it but due to how things have changed it might take an episode or two to settle you back into the comfort zone you once so easily attained...then it will be a nice stress reliever, believe me...a nice ""get-away-from-it-all"" experience..and if you never viewed it but would like light and very well-done comedy with a family atmosphere, you won't be disappointed.  Very talented cast for the first (and in my opinion also in the second and ongoing seasons) season, good writing, and the pairing of Scott Baio and Willie Ames abilities to mesh their acting talents with their characters' traits is a huge part of what has made this show a future classic.  Only the passage of time ultimately determines what shows become cultural classics and I do believe ""Charles In Charge"" will emerge as a definitive 1980's classic...just like ""Brady Bunch"" is the classic 1970's family comedy (as opposed to ""Partridge Family""), just like ""All In The Family"" (as opposed to ""Maude"")..you get the drift.  You won't regret buying it...especially when you want to return to the 80's, bright colors, snappy lines, and no stress....I never sell well-done comedy that captures its time short.  Thanks Scott Baio, Willie Ames and ALL involved with ""Charles In Charge"".",1170720000,2,2021,4.880466472303207
2460211,5,B000CELOVI,I ACTUALLY BOUGHT A LOT OF OLDER TYPE DVDS INCASE THE SHOW JUST SLOWLY DISAPPEARS. I GREW UP WITH THIS SHOW..ITS A CLASSIC AND I HOPE TO OWN EVERY SEASON SOON!! THEY NEED MORE SHOWS LIKE THIS NOW,1158192000,5,195,4.157894736842105
2460212,5,B000CELOVI,This is funny enough to keep the entire family entertained and not give them a toothache the way the Brady Bunch would. Although it can be edgy at times it doesn't go over the top. A perfect reflection of the 80s.,1151971200,5,213,4.219512195121951
2460213,5,B000CELOVI,"I almost fell off my chair when I saw that Charles in Charge was on DVD. I was hoping the creaters would realize how funny, clever, witty, sad at times, and educational this show was in the 80's. Putting it on DVD marks it as an instant classic for all to enjoy. I often wished I was part of the Pembroke's.

I loved the characters like Jason and his relationship with Charles, you really felt sad for them when the family left. Douglas was clever and had great writers and I was so in love with Lila.

I love every episode of Season One so much watched them over and over. Fans will easily remember the episode with Meg Ryan and the war between the children, the classic Episode when the childrens cousin visits and wants to take Lila out to a night club and Charles objects, The Episode with a very young Matthew Perry and his rock and roll friend Van....oh I could go on and on....the slumber party episode with Gwendolyn and the salad.

Just buy it and you will never regret it, ever!.

2460214,4,B000CELOVI,"I was five when this show first aired, and don't remember seeing it at the time. But through the years the 80's has always been my favorite decade when it comes to music, movies, and TV...so, it was not a surprise that I decided to buy this DVD! It took me a little while to warm up to it. There are times when the plot sags, though the cast always does a pretty good job of making the best of it.

After watching a few episodes, I really started to enjoy ""Charles in Charge."" I like the simplicity of some of the episodes -- there aren't a million different subplots going on, so the actors really can delve into the storyline! And the kids were all very adept at their roles. Michael Pearlman was very cute and perfectly captured the sentiments of his character, Jason, with great sensitivity and zest! Jonathan Ward portrayed the zany Douglas astutely. And April Lerman (Lila) definitely had something special -- she really should have gone further in the biz!

There is one element of the show's premise that requires some suspension of disbelief. While Charles is supposed to be in charge since the parents are so busy, you'll notice that the parents are ""there"" quite a lot. More often than not, the writing makes it seem that the parents are there but don't know how to deal with certain issues in raising their kids -- so they just tell Charles to take care of it. Other times, they seem to have the answers, yet they apparently are so fond of Charles in those moments that they leave it to him to figure out. A little strange in my opinion, but that's sitcoms for ya!

All in all, this DVD is a worthy investment for avid fans of 80's sitcoms. From all I've read, the later seasons -- with Charles taking care of a totally different family -- were far more popular and remain better known. I haven't seen those yet, so can't comment on them. But I can definitely say that this first season is a hidden treasure in the books of 80's sitcoms. It is unique, and the colorful cast leaves you with very feel-good feelings!",1142899200,3,2026,4.42627345844504
2460215,5,B000CELOVI,"Charles and the Pembrokes from the very beginning!~  This is one of the great 80's shows, I can't wait until the next season comes!!!",1142553600,2,133,4.541666666666667
2460216,4,B000CELOVI,"Well before metrosexual became common term, networks had `macho' Italian American men taking up domestic work such as house cleaning---or child care. Resurrecting the careers of both Scott Baio (`Happy Days', `Joannie Loves Chachie') and Willie Aames (`Eight is Enough') this season is classic camp television with some genuinely good surprises tucked away

Nineteen-year old Charles is hired by Jill (Julie Cobb) and Stan Pembroke (James Widdoes) to watch over their very rambunctious kids: Lila, 14 (April Lerhman); Douglas, 12 (Jonathan Ward); and Jason, 10 (Michael Pearlman).  We never learn Charles's last name, but I remain convinced that Charles's last name  is `Arcola'-because `Charles' also was the birth name of Baio's character on both `Happy Days' and `Joannie Loves Chachi'!

In this 22-episode 1984-1985 first season (the only one on NBC), Charles is very clean-cut, and his best friend Buddy Lembeck (Aames) is quite the devious schemer.  When the Pembrokes really leave Charles in charge for the night, he and Lila discover the dates they both subsequently invited over ultimately feel objectified. We see Charles's date Gwendolyn Pierce (Jennifer Runyon) throughout the rest of this season.

Coming to think of his extra curricular activity AS taking care of the Pembroke kids (""Extracurricular Activity"") Charles clearly is very special. Very few college students want to spend time as a live-in-nanny, regardless of how obviously angelic the kids and/or parents are. The type of stuff Charles handles is really mild though; none of the kids EVER take drugs...etc.

 I developed a new and totally unexpected appreciation for this series after going through both college and graduate school's many stresses. The writers more or less accurately captured college student's struggle trying to balance everything out in their own lives while having enough money to live that life. `Charles' subsequently was much more realistic in its depictions than the `college years' of many other TV shows (90210, Saved By The Bell...etc)..

Episodes like ""Another Saturday Night"" clearly set the series in the 1980's. All of the kids AND Charles are home watching election return results on a Saturday night because Michael Jackson is rumored to make a special appearance at a campaign headquarters. The kids sincerely feel down when Jackson's appearance ultimately gets cancelled due to unfavorable election returns. Contrasting with today, Jackson genuinely was a big entertainment draw in the 1980s.

Meg Ryan makes a special guest star as ""Jane"" a college student thinking of becoming a nanny for the neighboring Wilson's. However, after spending time with Charles, she realizes that working with kids and their problems are not HER strong point; she subsequently gets another job. Being a nanny is not for everybody.

The production team genuinely did a good job with the extras. Extras for this season include ""The great 80's TV flashback""",1139875200,16,2949,5.361471861471862
2460217,5,B000CELOVI,"I cannot even express in words how overjoyed I am by the news of this DVD release!!!! This was one of the greatest shows ever, I have no idea why it is not in syndication!!! I only wish this wasn't a DVD starting with the first original family. They weren't as good as the Powell's, when they started off the second season, and helped rise the show to it's popularity. Charles came back to find a new family in the house he worked at for the Pembroke's. Nonetheless, I cannot wait! This took far too long to happen!!",1138320000,3,516,4.275510204081633

8098129,5,B000CELOVI,"Network made a huge mistake listening to the reviewers, cancelling show, and letting cast go.  Stopped watching the show when Pembrokes were replaced.  This is a case where the network should have listened to the viewers.  The writers were excellent, cast was irreplaceable, family chemistry was amazing.  Too bad the shows of today cannot touch the shows of the 60's, 70's, and 80's.",1497484800,,384,5.0476190476190474
