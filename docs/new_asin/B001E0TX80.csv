8295860,5,B001E0TX80,"Love this.  I've been an Anglophile all my life.  I also loved the James Herriot series ""All Creatures Great and Small"".  I read all of the books and have the TV series on cassette.  My husband and I were in England a year ago and went through York.  So beautiful.",1397865600,,264,4.2
8295861,4,B001E0TX80,"I read the review of this DVD when I had tried to get one about the Yorkshire Dales in the UK.  None was available, but this one was NTSC so I ordered it for delivery to a friend in the USA.  She enjoyed it very much and was amazed by the skies, so many different ones, not just constant blue as in her state. Try it ... see the beauty of the north of England, learn there is more to England than the city of London.",1371081600,2,416,3.8255813953488373
8295862,5,B001E0TX80,"A very good documentary film about the Yorkshire dales. The scenery was terrific with excellent commentary and natural background noise. I would recommend this quality production to anyone seeking an informative view of the Yorkshire region. Maybe it would have been an idea to include some sounds from a traditional Yorkshire brass band, only my personal opinion but the natural noise of waterfalls, animals etc... was a far better and more pleasant option than to play any old music which unfortunately spoils many of the other similar productions. Buy it with no regrets.",1279065600,5,574,5.182795698924731
