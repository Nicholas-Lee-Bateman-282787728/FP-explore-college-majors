I love Anthony Andrews so I knew I would love the movie and am now a new fan of Annette O'Tooles.  She did a spectacular job!",1160611200,2,387,4.291666666666667

1177651,5,B0000039D3,"It's a toss up on which movie to choose for my all time favorite Danielle Steel movie: Jewels, The Ring or Zoya. All are sweeping historical romances and all are very, very good, if you want to watch a chick flick. Of the three, Jewels is probably tops followed by The Ring. Zoya comes in as my third favorite. Either way, Steel weaves her magic and transports the movie viewer to a place where the rich and famous mingle with mere mortals and where romance rules.",1133049600,4,464,4.406976744186046
1177652,4,B0000039D3,"I really enjoyed Jewels. This movie demonstrates courage, strength, and love. Jewels shows how a family can go through a rough time yet it can overcome any obstacle.",1070150400,,165,4.928571428571429
1177653,5,B0000039D3,"I will admit to having a fondness for the tv movies adapted from Danielle Steel's books.  Jewels, in particular, is one of my favorites and I have only one question.  When are these great stories coming out on DVD.  I have quite a few of the videos but would gladly toss them over for DVD replacements.  I heartily IMPLORE the powers that be to release all her movies on DVD format.  And I wouldn't mind seeing more of her books adapted into movies.  She writes such fun, adventurous love stories!",1031011200,2,497,4.466666666666667
1177654,5,B0000039D3,"When I was 13, I began reading Danielle Steel novels.  Most follow the same path and offer few variations.  So when Jewels was released, I did not buy it right away.  Then I saw the miniseries on TV and knew it HAD to be part of my library, both video AND book library.
Why?  For one, Anthony Andrews is the perfect fit for his role.  For fans of Andrews, one only has to remember that he played King Edward VIII in The Woman He Loved and what an excellent job he did in that role.  He was also stunning in The Scarlet Pimpernel and Ivanhoe, and period pieces seem to suit this well-trained actor.  Annette O'Toole is also well-cast as the strong-willed American woman who falls in love with the man in line for the crown (granted, he is 13th in line for the throne).
The story provides all the Steel conventions, but it does not seem old-hand when staged in this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Steel's work, the story is compelling.
Other Danielle Steel adaptations pale in comparison to Jewels.  This is by far the best adaptation of her work.  The blossoming of love, the separation of war, the agony of loss, the trials and tribulations of parenthood, the reinvention of one's self, the survival of one family.  Great entertainment!",1008806400,28,1241,4.451327433628318

1177745,4,B0000039D3,"I won't bother wasting time describing the plot of Jewels, it has already been done in previous reviews.  Part One of Jewels and the first 30 minutes of Part Two are really the only parts of the movie worth watching. I really enjoy Part One, as I am a huge Anthony Andrews fan, he dies about 30 minutes into Part Two. After William(Anthony Andrews) dies the movie disolves into a soapy sorry mess.  Annette O'Toole does a good job, but I will admit her shrieking during child birth and at other times is ear splitting and grinds on the nerves.  I usually watch until William dies and then I turn it off.

I'm giving Jewels 4 stars for Part One and the first 30 minutes or so of Part Two.  They are worth 4 stars and worth watching.",1211241600,,731,4.268115942028985
1177746,5,B0000039D3,"I had never watched a Danielle Steele movie before so I did not know what to expect. It was wonderful. I loved Anthony Andrews in this film. It was quite long but I watched the whole thing in one sitting..I could not turn it off. I thought that Philip looked about the same age as his mother as he grew older. I did not think she aged much...which made it distracting for me. I liked the fact that you never knew what was going to happen next, there were so many things happening at once. I will watch this one again and again.",1192838400,,527,4.12621359223301
1177747,5,B0000039D3,Jewels is probably my favoriate Danielle Steel movie.  Annette O'Toole is great and Anthony Andews is wonderful as usual.  Story line is very good though I think more time should have been given to period after WWII.,1187222400,2,216,4.8108108108108105

1177750,5,B0000039D3,"""Jewels"" is 1 of my favorite Danielle Steel movies. Annette O'Toole is fantastic !  Her character endures great loss throughout this movie yet  each time she emerges, she defines the meaning of strength, courage & perseverance .",1170806400,2,228,5.135135135135135
1177751,5,B0000039D3,"I consider this to be one of the best stories by Danielle Steel. In order to fully enjoy this movie, you must have time to sit and watch it. It is a lengthy movie but worth every minute of it. It takes you through the life of a woman name Sarah Whitfield. It is a great love story, and a story of triumph when it feels like the world is against you. She finally gets the man of her dreams but then suddenly war breaks out. The movie will take you through all emotions possible but it is a must see for those who are fans of Danielle Steel's writing",1169683200,,548,3.9909090909090907
1177752,2,B0000039D3,"I sincerely only watched this movie for Anthony Andrews (ever since I saw him in Scarlet Pimpernel, I've tried to see all of his movies -- by the way, that is a movie everyone should see!), so this review might be a bit biased.

Coming from a person who has not read the underlying material, I will review this movie solely on its entertainment value to me. The beginning was wonderful. The love story was beautiful, seemed real, and even brought tears to my eyes. Anthony Andrews was superb as usual, and Annette O'Toole did a good job as well.

But in my opinion, that was it. If the movie would have ended right there along with William, I would have rated it 4 stars. The second half of the movie was more of a soap opera, and I tired of seeing how many years were passing by. Was there really a need to show everyone's story! It may have worked for the book (have not read it), but the movie just seemed long and unfocused.

If you are an Anthony Andrews fan like myself, watch only the first half, and then perhaps just rewatch Brideshead Revisited -- now there's a good mini series!",1160697600,6,1089,4.328431372549019
