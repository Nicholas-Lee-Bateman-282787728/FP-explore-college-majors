8232014,4,B000YDKAJ4,"clyde beatty was a world famous animal tamer and had his own circus and so that's why they got him to be in these jungle movie serials.  if you are fairly forgiving and like old movies you might like these chapter serial movie serials.  if you like this beatty was also in another serial.  he was in darkest africa.  if you are forgiving of the time period you will like that one.  it was another jungle serial and was the first made by republic.  some of these actors such as wheeler oakman for example and lew meehan are in other serials.  wheeler was in darkest africa, phantom empire with gene autry and in flash gordon's trip to mars apparently.  those all involve adventure serials as opposed to serials of other genres such as crime, mystery, western, comic book hero, etc. meehan was also in mystery squadron.",1370217600,,817,4.5479452054794525
8232015,3,B000YDKAJ4,"I had never watched a movie quite like this one.  The animal scenes were quite real and the animals appeared to have been injured in the process.  I am a big fan of documentaries, but knowing that the scenes where predators were in close proximity to herbivores were staged offended even my usual open-minded sensibilities.

This movie was a serial, which has been combined into a single movie.  The plot is simple.  Animal trainer Clyde Beatty (playing himself) heads off after girl friend Ruth Robinson (Cecilia Parker) after she and her father disappear during an expedition.

The expedition encountered a storm that forced their ship aground on an apparently deserted island, Kamor, which includes a lost city.  Thinking ahead, the expedition brought homing pigeons with them so that they could send messages back in case their ship ran aground on an island during a storm.  The pigeon message quickly gets to civilization.  We later learn that there is treasure on the island.

Clyde learns about the shipwreck from a newspaper.  Clyde decides to journey to Kamor to save his girlfriend.  Clyde takes a dirigible across the ocean, but the dirigible encounters a storm, as can be seen by cheesy animated effects.  The dirigible lands on an island.  It just so happens that the island is the same on which Ruth and her father shipwrecked.

Beatty takes a helper with him, Sharkey.  Just the name alone should tell you something about Sharkey.  Sharkey (Warner Richmond) keeps trying to sabotage Beatty's efforts.  During the storm and the crash of the dirigible, Sharkey lands on the island by parachute, unbeknownst to everyone else.  Sharkey finds Ruth's father, who separated from the rest of the castaways, and the treasure.  Sharkey next looks for the captain of the ship so that he can leave the island.  Unfortunately, for Sharkey, his character meets the stereotypical ironic ending.

In the end, the good guys get the critters, the jewels and the babe, so there is a very unexpected happy ending.

This movie is quite anachronistic.  We know that no islands exist with the variety of animals shown in this movie.  The predator density was too high to be sustained.  Lastly, this island had African lions and North American mountain lions, which is a good trick in any era.  It seems like nearly everything in this movie was stereotypical.

On the other hand, if you can suspend your common sense and knowledge of the world, and you can ignore the cruelty to the animals in the movie (though the cruelty shown was not considered cruel in that era), this movie is an interesting artifact of another era.  This 1934 serial was made in an era when talking films were still new.  It is likely that many of the features were considered amazing by audiences of that era rather than being unlikely or improbable.  Put into the perspective of its era, this movie gave me an interesting perspective on how we view the world and ourselves.

Good luck!",1340150400,2,2952,4.8537074148296595
8232016,4,B000YDKAJ4,Most of the animals looks like they are in glass cages. There is still must action in the film.,1257984000,,95,4.052631578947368
8232017,3,B000YDKAJ4,"Evidently I watched a different version. This was also released in the same year and under the same title as a 68-minute feature version of the serial by Mascot Pictures Corporation. It is incorporated in the 50 movie pack Sci-Fi collection.

Plenty of animal training scenes staring the Hogenbeck-Wallace Animals. Clyde the benevolent and gentle animal trainer is too naive about human nature to realize that one of his men Sharkey (Warner Richmond) tries to kill him every time he turns around, and too preoccupied to realize he must marry Ruth Robinson (Cecilia Parker) or lose her to a South Seas trip planned by her father.

While Clyde is busy playing with his felines, Ruth and her father Capt. Robinson (Edward LeSaint) are ship wrecked on an uncharted island of Kamor with lions, tigers, bears, and more unscrupulous beasts. Ruth gives Clyde the bird. I mean sends him a cable by carrier pigeon.

Clyde to the rescue on a new air ship. Lightning strikes in a storm and you guest it Dirigible Victory splits up. Sharkey bails like a rat leaving a sinking ship, with the only parachute. What are their chances of getting lost on the same island? What is worse Sharkey is lose somewhere and up to his nefarious plots.

Will Clyde become tiger chow and who will get the girl?",1243641600,4,1280,4.726457399103139
