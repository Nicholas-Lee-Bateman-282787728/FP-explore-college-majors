8648783,1,B002W2XFGU,"I found this disks to be of extremely poor quality. I knew I was getting copies of old newsreels, however, I thought that there would be some screening and at least some effort to deliver reasonable picture and sound. Evidently my expectations were unreasonable as I found the reproductive quality to be below any standard that I have ever seen(I have a number of old newsreel copies). The sound was either absent or hit and miss in most stories I have reviewed. Other than the general period of the newsreel there did not seem to be any organized plan of presentation.

Over the years I have bought hundreds of items from Amazon and it's vendors and have always been pleased with the quality and service received. In questioning this vendor I was told to read their return policy(which I had not as it required and additional click to a subscreen) which states no returns for any reason other than for damage merchandise!

In summary, I am not pleased with the merchandise or the service policy of this vendor and, altough I admitt I did not read their return policy(as it was not displayed with their merchandise) I do think that Amazon should review this vendor to see if the product is up to your minimun standards.
