8344265,1,B001ULDK5A,"This is a waste of a DVD disk.  It is a recording of a recording that is in the public domain.  I cannot believe I fell for this.
Don't let it happen to you.",1281657600,6,157,3.588235294117647
8344266,1,B001ULDK5A,"Okay...so it is a slide show accompanying a reading of the archaic translation by Ian Johnston (rather convoluted syntax to say the least), but the worst part is that it is incomplete: entirely missing Chapter 1! I declare this a rip-off and suggest nobody even consider buying this or the audio download of the same!",1267488000,5,317,4.781818181818182
8344267,1,B001ULDK5A,I thought I was buying a movie but it turned out to be an unorthodox audiobook translation with a few still frames of beetles. I returned it for a refund as I know more about the German than the translator. My rating is based on disappointed expectations more than anything else.,1256428800,8,279,4.490196078431373
