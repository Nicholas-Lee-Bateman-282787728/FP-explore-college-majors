2334215,3,B0009X75HE,"This is the third movie in the Killer Tomato series. It stars John Astin (Addams Family on TV) and Rick Rockwell (Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire).
This time Dr. Gangreen wants to take over the world by taking over the news media. Of course, his Killer Tomatoes fit into the plans too. Lance is the one who tries to stop him - with some help from Kennedi who is a Tomatologist. (Yep. She studies Tomatoes.)
The jokes are very silly. This is one of those movies you'll think is just dumb or great. It appears to have a bigger budget and stronger script than the original. Although the story might be more developed than the original, I'm not sure if I can say it's a better movie. The original's appeal was in it's very obvious low-budget. The original almost looks home-made. Here the presentation is better, but the script doesn't play out as well. This movie is easier to sit through than the second movie - Return of the Killer Tomatoes (which had most of the actors from the first movie plus George Clooney). Killer Tomatoes Strike Back is about equal to the next movie, Killer Tomatoes Eat France, if you decide you want to see more.",1028332800,11,1139,4.480769230769231
2334216,4,B0009X75HE,"This film is just great. It's a bout the evil dr. Ganggren who is trying to brian wash people through his talk show, his evil plan is helped by the evil docters killer tomatoes. It is up to a tomatoeologeist and a cop (a dirty harry spoof) to stop the sinister plan. This is a great film, it has lots of great laughs  and is just plane entertaining till the end. The one problem is that if the show situation happened I wouldn't watch the show, cause it seems realy boring. Just don't expect anouther [show] and you'll be fine.",962150400,3,527,4.27
2334217,3,B0009X75HE,"Following the infamous Tomatoes Attacks movies, this one is a comedy like Top Secret and Airplane. Well saying, it tries to be, 'cause it's much inferior than that, the jokes are extremely stupid. Even so, it has some  good gags, like the English-Tomatoe dictionary...",960681600,2,268,5.090909090909091
2334218,5,B0009X75HE,"A sequel that should have never been made was and it is terrible. This is so bad that it is hilarious. This movie fits right in between Godzila vs Mothra and Night of the Living Dead. For those of you unfamilar with the  first movie, the evil Dr. Ganggreen is at it again trying to take over the  world using ""Killer Tomatoes"". The same crew has to stop him  again. This is a great movie at half the price. Buy it if you need a break  from good movies.",960681600,4,452,4.044943820224719
8069408,5,B0009X75HE,"Professor Mortimer Gangreen (John Astin) is back. He evidently never watched ""Pinky and the Brain ""(1995 TV series). He has plans disguised as Jeronahew to take over the world by using bad television.

First he must get revenge, get retribution, and get even with previous opponents. Out to foil his plot, Dr. Kennedi Johnson (Crystal Carson) best know Tomatologist. She has a close encounter with a killer tomato and a shower curtain. Also the unwitting Police Detective Lance Boyle (Rick Rockwell) who does not quite believe in killer tomatoes until it is too late. Then there is the return of FT; whose side is he on this time?

Is John Astin becoming a better actor or just being himself? As usual full of puns and one liner's. Be prepared for the sequel.",1511222400,,759,4.742424242424242

8069412,3,B0009X75HE,"About twice a year, I go through a killer tomato marathon, watching all four movies over the course of four days. And every time, on the third day, I'm tempted to skip over this offering and head right to Killer Tomatoes Eat France. I never do, but I want to.
I don't know where this film went wrong. Same creative talents, John Astin, Fuzzy Tomato, it should have been a masterpiece. Sadly it is not. The humor here seems oddly forced, getting few genuine laughs. The story itself makes no sense, even for a movie about deadly produce. The main cop doesn't believe in killer tomatoes? When clearly he would have been around for the Great Tomato War?  Gangrene wanted to be a journalist? Wasn't that Igors shtick?
There are some redeeming points. I like the look of the tomatoes in this one, their little faces are both cute and disturbing at the same time.  The opening sequence with the Friday the 13th gag works well, as does the wrap up during the end credits. It's a shame the stuff in between couldn't be half as funny. If you're a tomato fan, you'll want this to complete your set, but don't expect it to become your favorite entry. If your not a tomato fan, this isn't the movie that will change your mind.",1393804800,,1214,4.439461883408072

8069414,5,B0009X75HE,"All the Killer Tomatoes movies were silly but fun. I mean with a Title like that come on!  I was an Extra in this movie and it was even more fun to be there actually filming this madness!  This naturally was my favorite of all the Killer Tomato movies!  (I had a walk through in the bank scene, I was in the stands and I was shown on the TV that was in the movie.  I also got to meet John Astin - very nice, friendly person.",1344902400,,424,3.839080459770115
8069415,4,B0009X75HE,"Professor Gangreen (John Astin) has returned, still intent on world domination. This time, he's decided to use television to create a world of stupified tele-zombies (er, isn't he a tad late for that?)! Through his insidious TV personality, ""Jeronahue"", Gangreen sets his diabolical plot in motion. Oh yeah, there are killer tomatoes rolling around as well. Can supercop Lance Boyle (Rick Rockwell) and a stunning tomatologist (Crystal Carson) possibly hope to thwart the devilish professor's plans, or is the earth doomed to a bleak future of tomato-induced, talkshow hell?? Things look very grim indeed. Let us pray that Boyle and company can beat the impossible odds...",1246838400,,672,5.349056603773585

8069417,4,B0009X75HE,"In a world full of bad news, dirty politicians, and the never ending wars on drugs and terror, there are few things that make life worth living, Killer Tomato movies are one of the few rays of sunshine for this dreary planet.

That's right folks. Dr. Gang Green and his trusty sidekick Igor are at it again trying to take over the world with the deadliest of all fruits (because as we all know, tomatoes technically are fags). This movie starts off with a beautiful blond being chased down by a maniac in a hockey mask. Little do they both know they are both about to be killed by tomatoes wielding chainsaws and wearing hockey masks of their own.

Lt. Finletter is back as the greatest of all tomato fighters. Sam Smith the disguise expert even makes a quick appearance (sort of). The tomatologist, Kennedy Johnyson (who is a heck of a tomato herself) is the eye candy for this flick.

The plot is simple enough. Dr. Gang Green is now trying to use the TV media as the means to which take over. He does a funny Geraldo knock off as a TV talkshow host. Along the way the tomato gags are fast, furious, and hilarious.

It's really simple. If you love one Tomato movie, you'll love them all. If you hate one, well go watch something else and don't bother seeing the other three.",1139788800,3,1276,4.3940677966101696
