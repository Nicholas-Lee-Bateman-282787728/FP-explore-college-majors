8375496,5,B002NWRMN6,"I saw this film at a festival last year and I can say that it honestly riveted me from beginning to end. But therein was the slight problem- the entire film is only about half an hour long!!! So just as you get into it you will find yourself reading the credits. That said, the 30 minutes you spend with it will be well worth your time. Whether you are a fan of art, Buddhism, travel, eastern history, or just vivid and awesome cinematography you will enjoy this. I only wish that it were also available on blu-ray and double the length!!!",1279065600,,539,4.294117647058823
8375497,5,B002NWRMN6,"I went to Mustang in November of 2008 as part of an academic group to study Tibetan and Himalayan culture. This movie almost brought me to tears. It's short, but it's powerful. These people's voices need to be heard, and I thank PBS for doing so in such a beautiful way. I even recognized a couple of people and a LOT of the places!

Highly recommended.
