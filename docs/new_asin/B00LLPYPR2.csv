8666410,1,B00LLPYPR2,"This story is simply wrong when crediting the decoding of ENIGMA - the encoding machine German military used throughout WW2 - to MI6. In reality it was decoded by Polish mathematicians. This widely known fact is described among other places by Wikipedia. Here is the relevant quote:

German military messages enciphered on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932. This success was a result of efforts by three Polish cryptologists, Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rycki and Henryk Zygalski, working for Polish military intelligence. Rejewski ""reverse-engineered"" the device, using theoretical mathematics and material supplied by French military intelligence. Subsequently the three mathematicians designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma ciphers, including the cryptologic bomb.
