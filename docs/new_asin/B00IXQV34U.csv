6304286,5,B00IXQV34U,"I own the VHS tape that John made before Jim Garrison passed away. The quality of the DVD is of course far superior and is one of the best documentaries on the execution of President Kennedy. The podcast discussion with the above journalists and authors is outstanding. I only wish it was five times the length on this wonderful DVD. If you have not seen The Garrison Tapes, buy this DVD as soon as possible. It is a valuable addition to your library and remains one of the best interviews ever on the conspiracy that was behind the execution of President Kennedy. Kudos to John Barbour for making this valuable DVD available for such a reasonable price. Thank you John!

6304287,5,B00IXQV34U,"John Barbour's The Last word on the assassination is an excellent well researched, well written documentary about Jim Garrison's investigation into the murder of JFK. There's nothing new here for those familiar with the case. However it is relevant information an excellent introduction for those not familiar with Jim Garrison and his struggles against the powers that be. I enjoyed the discussion panel but it should have been longer giving the immense complexity of the case. Overall a great buy an investment.",1398038400,,513,5.2682926829268295

6304290,4,B00IXQV34U,"I have read all of Mark Lane's books;  Jim Garrison's ON THE TRAIL OF THE ASSASSINS;  read Peter Janny's MARY'S MOSAIC. . . and others.  I know a lot about the assassination.  Those who got their information about the JFK killing from corporate radio and tv know nothing about the truth. I had no idea John Barbour was this well informed or motivated about the assassination. Mr. Barbour has done a wonderful service to the search for the truth. This movie proves clearly that shots came from the famous grassy knoll.  You see the witnesses telling their story very clearly. The rifle first discovered in the school book depository was definitely a German Mauser, not the Italian gun owned by Oswald. The involvement of Clay Shaw is clear, as well as Ruby's.  Critics of the conspiracy concept say that it's all circumstantial evidence.  No, the perps will not voluntarily step forward, but the evidence is so conclusive that, for the government to deny it, you know there's a coverup.  People have gone to the gas chamber on circumstantial evidence.

The truth in this film can only be denied by those who are afraid to face its implications.  The truth challenges our complacency, it challenges the superficiality that so many citizens are immersed in,  it calls out to each of us to do our part in bringing to justice the military/intelligence cabal that has infested this country at least since the Kennedy assassination.  Look around you.  This is what it looks and feels like to live under a coup, American style.  Not so bad you say?  No, not if integrity means nothing to you.  Not if you care little for the constitution, not if you don't care about justice, not if you don't mind living a sham.

Get this film and share it.  If you try to show it at town hall meetings - as I intend doing - you will have to fend off those who say: ""Eh, that's old news.  Peter Jennings told us Oswald did it. That's good enough for me.""  Will you let ignorant people discourage you?  Will you risk looking like kook?  I wear black clothing most of the time, not for morbid reasons but because I like to.  But when someone asks me why I wear black, I tell them that I'm mourning the death of the republic. That sometimes gets a good discussion going.",1396915200,57,2243,4.5525
6304291,3,B00IXQV34U,I watched the DVD twice over a three day period. I just don't know what's all the fuss about. This DVD is good for those without any background information on Garrison and the Assassination. I have read over 100 books on the assassination. So for me the information given on the DVD was very basic. The panel discussion was actually better than the documentary. Though Joan Mellen was a wordhog. Overall I would have given this material one star but I feel anything that could get the attention of a younger generation on this matter is worth at least three stars. Overall if you have read 4 or more books on the assassination especially those centering on the Garrison Investigation there is no need to buy this DVD!!!

6304293,5,B00IXQV34U,"Jim Garrison is an American Hero, and this DVD tells his story.  His brave, righteous fight to find the truth behind the murder of JFK is one of the unsung heroic acts of the 20th century.  At great cost to himself, his efforts provided the groundwork for many of the revelations about not only the murder, but the cover up that ensued to date.  John Barbour tells Jim Garrison's story in a style and manner that is at once powerful, and poignant in it's scope, presentation and long term importance of its subject.  It is unfortunate that our nation has had to wait so many decades for Jim Garrison's story to be told, but each of us is lucky that Mr Barbour persisted, with a patriots zeal, to make this information available, and very accessible, to all those that value two principles on which our Democracy is based: truth and justice. The panel discussion that follows the film lends a very effective current perspective to the importance of Garrison and his work.  Three of the most respected Kennedy Assassination researchers give their valuable insights into the system that fought Garrison's efforts tooth and nail, and then covered the tracks of complicity for the next fifty years.

6304295,5,B00IXQV34U,"John Barbour's The Last Word On The Assassination, might be a bit presumptive of a title.  But, it is certainly the last word as to whether or not a conspiracy existed to kill JFK.  This documentary does an incredibly good job, delving into the Jim Garrison case.  It explores the Clay Shaw trial in depth, and ties together conspirators such as David Ferrie, Shaw, and Ruby, and more.  The documentary portion of the DVD was put together by John Barbour, just before Garrison passed away.  He is the only person who ever interviewed Jim Garrison in depth on camera.  It is interesting, to not only get Garrison's word for word account concerning portions of the trial.  It is also interesting to see his emotions in talking about the trial, all the way to his failed marriage due to the strain it put upon his family.  Even his children are interviewed in this documentary.  This is the kind of emotional depth you can't get from just reading a book, alone.

But what makes this already impressive document of history even better, is the discussion at the end of the documentary, shot at UNLV in January 2014.  Barbour, along with Jim Marrs, Dick Russell, and Joan Mellen, discuss information that many haven't even heard about yet.  These four panelists together, are some of the most knowledgeable people on the subject, that you will ever be exposed to.  If I could fault this documentary in any way, it would be that the discussion portion doesn't continue on for another couple hours.  I wish this could have been a two DVD set.  The panelists all agree that our mass media is complacent in this crime.  Their insights are a wonderful addition to this documentary.  Marrs' book (Crossfire) is the first one I ever read about the assassination, and interested me in the subject.  I have not read Mellen's or Russell's books, but now I plan to in the near future.

Back during the 30th anniversary of the JFK assassination, it was just after the 1991 Oliver Stone film concerning the Garrison trial.  On television, I saw a lot of pro and anti conspiracy documentaries.  But, during the 50th anniversary, I saw not a single documentary devoted to a conspiracy involving our own CIA, on television.  This is the heart of the documentary, and discussion here.

You will not find a better proof of CIA involvement and government conspiracy and media bias on this subject anywhere else.  This is two hours and 30 minutes that will absolutely convince anyone that a conspiracy to kill JFK existed, and still exists to cover it up even over 50 years after the event.  Get this documentary.",1394841600,99,2587,4.720982142857143
6304296,5,B00IXQV34U,"I really enjoyed this one. I'm going to have to watch it again just to be sure I didn't miss anything. I've researched the subject for over 20 years and there's things I found out that I didn't know.
One thing is the photo of Shaw, Oswald and Ferrie at a party, something that the Warren report said there was no linking all of them.
The second thing is the CIA had a program to infiltrate the KGB in the 60s. That  could be one thing could be what got him killed. What better way to do that than to marry someone that's related to a Russian official, as he did.
The third thing is there's been new information about what was going on with the CIA released from FOIA.
Those three things alone are damning evidence.
The also go into discounting the photo of Lee holding the rifle and a communist publication.
Maybe not the best place for a novice to begin but even if you believe Oswald was the lone assassin its good food for thought.
Any naysayers that take the Warren Report verbatim are in for some surprises.",1474934400,4,1012,4.298429319371728

6304298,5,B00IXQV34U,"After a lifetime of reading various books and articles on the greatest murder mystery in the history of mankind, this film does a phenomenal job of piecing together all of the many stories of how the murder was covered up.  Sometimes the panelists go into to too much minutiae, but for those who have a thorough knowledge of the assassination, it's a minor detail.  Jim Marr, the author of Crossfire and one of the panelists in the film, nails it when he says, ""It's not about who shot the President, it's about who covered it up.""  This film goes a long way towards making sense out of many moving parts to the overall murder mystery.  Highly recommended.",1466553600,2,656,4.581196581196581

6304303,5,B00IXQV34U,"This is absolutely the best introduction to the 1963 coup and the CIA forces behind it.  It is the only documentary that features an interview with great New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only law enforcement official who tried to bring President Kennedys actual murderers to justice.  Garrison's efforts, which began in 1966, were documented by his books:  A Heritage of Stone and On the Trail of the Assassins:  One Man's Quest to Solve the Murder of President Kennedy, on which Oliver Stone based his movie JFK (along with Jim Marrs book Crossfire).

The interview with Garrison--conducted in 1981 by John Barbour--is unique in terms of setting, length, substance, and the lack of a CIA sponsored hostile presence determine to undermine his message.  Writer/Director Barbour used documentary material and archival footage to give context to Garrisons comments.

Garrison makes the following points in the interview segments:

-Oswald had nothing to do with the assassination.
-John F. Kennedy was killed by the Central Intelligence Agency.
-The assassination would not have gone forward without the cooperation of the Dallas Police Department.
-The FBI was in full cooperation with the CIA and perpetrators within hours of the assassination.
-There were a minimum of three assassination teams, with two teams shooting from the grassy knoll, and at least one team at the back, tho not in the sixth floor school book depository window.
-Some members of the media cooperated immediately before reality started interfering with the building of the illusion.
-One of the functions of the Warren Commission was to conceal the fact that Oswald was not involved in any way, and to make it appear that he was involved.
-LBJ changed US foreign policy for Vietnam within 72 hours.  In fact after JFKs eulogy he met with Chiefs of Staff to tell them he was changing Vietnam policy by sending combat troops in.",1455148800,2,1914,5.128617363344051

But the truth is that so much information & evidence has been amassed regarding the JFK assassination that any thorough coverage of the subject would require multiple DVDs. I imagine that the market for this material is too small to justify the cost of such a thorough presentation. As for this documentary, John Barbour did a fantastic job and produced a record of Jim Garrison's investigation that is informative, interesting, and of very high quality. The included panel discussion was equally interesting and also frustratingly short; yes, I would have liked to have seen an extended discussion, but, as with most panel discussions, certain individuals tend to dominate the discussion & they are often not the people you want to hear most. I think a simple sit-down discussion between Mr. Barbour and one other researcher - like Jim Marrs - would have been preferable. Well, one can engage in nit-picking and wishful thinking forever, but the bottom line is that ""The Last Word on the Assassination"" is a superior documentary on many levels, and Mr. Barbour is to be commended for it. Jim Garrison was a man of great courage, and this video is a fitting testament to his courage as well as being an excellent record of his historic investigation.",1433376000,5,1353,4.93859649122807

6304320,5,B00IXQV34U,"Excellent film that pulls from the Jim Garrison investigation and trial to put a lot of the pieces of the JFK assassination together. Any thinking person on the fence will no longer be after viewing this presentation and the panel discussion which follows the primary film.

I agree with one viewer who stated that the panel discussion could have gone longer. The guests were all well informed with slightly different points of emphasis on the events that made for a nice overall mosaic. You wanted them to keep sharing their knowledge as one gem after another was shared.

Jim Maars had a very important response that summarized a lot for me to a question from an 18 year old in the audience who asked, (I paraphrase here) ""If the powers that engineered this didn't want to generate all of this scrutinizing and doubt, why would they do something like this in broad daylight?"" Maar's response was significant and important to understanding the JFK assassination.

Bear in mind that JFK was not without his political flaws either. He fully supported the UN (a tool of the global international financiers like our Federal Reserve to bring about the New World Order as they put it) and favored disarmament of the U.S. by turning it over to the UN, hardly the peace keeping force they are played to public as.

However, as the film and panel notes, his mistake was to attempt to assert his office over the aims of the banking cartels which is to generate debt through wars and absolute control of the money supply and interest rates (cost of money). As Maars pointed out the other 2 Presidents who attempted that were Lincoln (also shot in the head in public) and Andrew Jackson (who narrowly escaped an assassination attempt).

Watch this film and the JFK assassination will become clearer to you. Take it a step further and read Shadows of Power by James Perloff to see who is engineering a lot of this kind of clandestine activity. Allan Dulles as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR, a bankster asset) was an early advocate of the CFR crafted UN and the CIA. Keep in mind that all CIA heads have been selected from the CFR. Not a coincidence. The CIA has been called Rockefeller's police which is to say it is an asset of the banksters or international central bank financiers. Read Perloffs book for more on the CFR.

Another book on the topic worth looking at is Who Really Killed Kennedy?: 50 Years Later: Stunning New Revelations About the JFK Assassination by Jerome Corsi. All in all, a film so good I watched it 2 times in a row. If you have an interest in the JFK assassination give it a watch, I don't think you will leave it with an uninformed point of view.

For those of us who have to utilize at least 2 or 3 of our 5 senses combined to weigh enough evidence for anything to really convince us something is true or not, this will do it.  This riveting documentary, has the truth for us to see, hear and feel.

NOT MENTIONED IN THIS EXCELLENT Documentary/worldwide Webinar, was my question and the answer:  How did, and why did, Henry Luce, founder of Time magazine in 1923, buy the Zapbruder film of the assassination, hide it away in his safe to keep it from the American justice system and the eyes of the American people?

This might be the biggest example of obstruction of justice next to the Government's cover-up's which are laid wide open in this DVD.  Uncut, and not tampered with by Luce, the CIA/FBI, LBJ, our 4th Estate Media and so on, this was some of the most profound evidence of the crime of the Century.

To see and hear the Dallas Chief of Police Chief LIE when he addressed to the news media he told them Lee Harvey Owald proved positive from the the paraffin test performed on him after his arrest for the execution of President John F. Kennedy.  Oswald's paraffin test proved negative, that he had not fired a weapon on that day in November, 1963.

See, hear and feel (and get Goose Bumps) when you see the Dallas policeman report on a news film that there were 2 weapons found on the 6th Floor of the Texas Book Depository Building, not 1.  The first gun found was a German Mauzer, with the model # stamped on it...The Mauzer, instead of the 1 the Warren Commission wanted in their report.  And of course there was only 1 weapon reported found on the 6th Floor by our CIA controlled media.  Lee Harvey Oswald's finger prints were not found on the either weapon.  These were just 2 of the many, many facts revealed in this documentary.

This was the day the truth died in this country.  This Documentary was recorded as part of a worldwide Webinar at the UNLV earlier this year.

6304368,4,B00IXQV34U,"I had seen the documentary before and was mainly interested in the panel discussion.

I give the documentary five stars, the panel discussion three stars.

I found the panel discussion to be a bit unsatisfying and frustrating.  Each of the panelists is a wonderful contributor to the JFK assassination story and their knowledge is priceless.  It's nice to have them together in one room, discussing the results of their various investigations.

Having said that, I was  disappointed.  Some of the points were not explained and I could not follow them.  I have read dozens of books on the assassination and feel I am pretty well versed.  In spite of that, a fair amount of what was said was unintelligible, either due to an abrupt changing of the subject, or the proper foundation not being given at the start of a topic.

The problem is that there was no way to edit or clarify anything in the panel discussion.  I think the only way this could have been remedied would have been for there to have been a moderator to keep things structured and to have the audience questions submitted in advance, giving the participants time to prepare cohesive, lucid answers.

This of course was not possible on Mr. Barbour's shoestring budget.

In spite of my nitpicking, I do recommend this as a wonderful antidote to the Warren Report.  These brave researchers deserve our praise for their tireless efforts in search of the truth, and their willingness to go against the tsunami of criticism they receive from the mainstream media.",1400976000,3,1521,4.822393822393822

6304371,5,B00IXQV34U,"Of the many reasons to recommend John Barbours The Last Word on the Assassination, one stands out.  Ive watched a number of documentaries on the JFK assassination, and this is the only one to match the Dicta belt recording of the gunshots in Dealey Plaza to the Zapruder film.  Now, admittedly, Ive never fired any weapon more powerful than a squirt gun, but I believe I know enough to understand that no bolt-action rifle can fire two consecutive rounds in such quick succession as indicated by the Dicta belt recording.  And when matched with the Zapruder film, that cluster of two gun-shots (the second of which strikes JFK in the temple and kills him) settles the matter of conspiracy once and for all: Pow . . . pow-pow! more than one shooter.  Setting aside the unlikeliness of any single shooters ability to hit a target from the TSBD, Barbours film makes clear that two weapons were fired in quick succession.

But beyond that revelatory moment, The Last Word on the Assassination provides new depth and context to the film clips and images that have become so familiar that they tempt their viewers to predict filmmakers narration.  Barbours film defies this convention.  His insights go deeper and, as a result, express the courage of his convictions without sounding dogmatic.  Warren Commission apologists will almost certainly scream of the bias that informs his narration.  What they fail to understand, though, is that bias toward the truth should never bend toward lesser truth, much less total fantasy and falsehood, for the sake of appeasing those who are uncomfortable with bias.  The Warren Commissionwith the assistance of the media and all of the other usual suspectsset in motion a collective psychological delusion that would have us believe that the sky is green.  Mr. Barbour is not biased because hes telling us that the sky is in fact blue.

He does this most powerfully in his portrayal of Jim Garrison, whose sky was turned green by the same forces that, by their own admission, successfully manipulated public opinion, electoral processes, and economies to effect regime change in Iran, Guatemala, Chile, Nicaraguaneed I go on?  Those with real institutional power don't call these processes conspiracythey reserve that pejorative for those of us who understand that Watergate, Iran-Contra, and Gulf War II are products of THEIR cynicism.  By successfully aligning conspiracy with paranoia and/or obsession, the institutionally powerful have successfully marginalized those who have ferreted out so many of the realities of assassinations and other transformative events.  We have more polite euphemisms to describe such processes, but inasmuch as they are based in manipulation and involve many people to carry them out, they are certainly conspiratorial.  Whether the composite character played by Donald Sutherland in Oliver Stones JFK or the now-deceased David Atlee Phillips, who appears in this film, the purveyors of regime-change and assassination admit as much in trumpeting their exploits.  And those who appear in Barbours film unintentionally, indirectly, ipso facto, and indubitably vindicate Jim Garrison.

This is an important film.  But if we cant wake up to the realities of imminent catastrophic climate change, I have little faith that well awaken to the realities of what JFKs assassination ushered in for us all back in 1963.  John Barbours intellectual honesty is an exhortation to us to recognize that until we recognize that we were lied to back in 1963 we will continue to be complicit in our own subjugation.",1399075200,4,3565,5.16695652173913
