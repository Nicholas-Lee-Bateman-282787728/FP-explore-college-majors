1206215,1,B00000F5W8,"Better picture and sound.  That's what it was hyped on, and that is what we must expect - AND GET.
Columbia/Sony's TV season releases are sub-par, especially in video quality.
I'm not here to praise the show.  In its earlier years (the ""Steve Rhoades"" era) the show was funniest.  Or maybe the Ted McGinley era was better.  I dunno.  Most seasons had their share of great episodes.  But I taped a lot of MWC.  Why should I buy the DVD, for $30?  What should I be getting?
While it's nice to see company's logos look crisp and clear, it becomes a disappointment to see fuzzy TV show afterward.  (there is a big difference between the quality of the master tapes/film and the transfer quality.  The latter pertains to how the DVD image looks on your screen.  Master tape quality is the condition of the tape  (a degrading studio tape looks far different than a poor DVD transfer).  Many tools and tricks are used to restore picture and sound quality, but all of that time and money spent to clean the episodes by the company is wasted if the DVD transfer is poor.)
Pity I can't post pics...
Season 1 wasn't all that great.  For Columbia, it's pretty much standard.  Bog standard.
I refuse to buy another Columbia/Sony TV series on DVD until they clean up their act OR make their prices reasonable.  Not for the amount of money customers spend...  (and just wait until you see these on HDTV...)  Should Good Times season 2 be $30?  Try $15.  MWC season 2 being $34?  Try $15 instead.  Three's Company season 1 being $13?  Try $6.  OR give consumers and fans of these shows some RESPECT and push out high quality releases.  We work for a living and if we don't put out good material, we get fired and blacklisted.  Why should you expect any different treatment?
Why is it that FOX will release a season's worth of TV shows, with extras, and make them look clean and crisp - whereas Columbia's look like near-VHS quality?  (Okay, it's better than VHS in some shots, but all in all it's not better enough to be enthused about.)
These shows more than made up their money via the original sponsors airtimes and syndication reruns.  MWC made MILLIONS.  Surely you'd think that the owner would take a little care for the sake of their fans?  How much extra does a disc cost?  Or a dual-layer disc?!  Squeezing 9 episodes onto one disc instantly tells me ""crud quality""; especially when I've seen Columbia release series (Good Times, The Critic, etc) with 8 eps per disc and they look mediocre~fair.)  Sheesh, even ""Family Guy"", with 8 eps per disc, still look stunning (dual layer discs).
Hey, Paramount improved their act.  FOX was great to start with.  It's Columbia's turn to show they've got guts.
I refuse to be taken to the cleaners any longer.  I'm not that desperate to replace VHS with... well... VHS.
I will asy this in this set's favor:  13 easter eggs, each revealing an interview.  It's a nice thought, especially if the interviews were worth it, but I much prefer to see the eps in good condition.",1079395200,12,3001,4.550561797752809
1206216,4,B00000F5W8,"Wow I remember all the hubbub people were speaking of when this show debuted. I was way too young to watch but since everyone was like this must be banned I just HAD to. And I did. Its a hilarious show about a family that's just poor and dysfunctional, can't you relate to that?",1076889600,2,278,4.166666666666667
1206217,5,B00000F5W8,"In 1987, a little show called Married With Children on a little network called FOX, made it's debut and in the process made it's mark on the sitcom genre. The first season was a mid season replacement consisting of only 12 episodes. While the ratings were poor, and the network wasn't quite a network yet, the show struck a nerve and stuck around. Now, we get season 2. The first full season and where the show really started to come into it's own. The tone had been set and the actors had settled into their roles. Season 2 is a vast improvement over season 1, since that season was pretty short and still trying to find it's feet. While I said in my season one review all that really needed to be said about the show, it's characters, and why it was so successful and liked, I'll just stick to the episodes at hand in this season box set. It begins with a two part episode called ""Poppy's By The Tree"". To me, this is classic Bundy. I have always loved these two episodes and it was around this time that I started watching, so they have great sentimental value to me. ""If I Were A Rich Man"", finds Steve realizing that a million dollars is missing from the bank and he thinks Al took it. Not a great ep. ""Buck Can Do It"" is a classic episode that has the family wanting Buck The Dog neutered, but Al can't bring himself to it. A riot!. Another two parter, ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun"", finds Marcy losing her ring down a stripper's pants while out with Peg. Great two parter. ""Alley Of The Dolls"" is another classic ep that finds The Bundy's in a bowling match with Peg's old high school rival. ""You Better Watch Out"" is one of the biggest Bundy classics, when a department store Santa crash lands in the Bundy backyard. ""Just Married...With Children"" is a keeper. Al and Peg go on a game show disguised as Steve and Marcy, but you have to endure torture in order to win. The season finale, ""All In The Family"", features appearances by Peg's, shall we say, less than stellar family. There are a lot more episodes here, but these are the best. ""The Razor's Edge"" and ""Earth Angel"", also fall in there. Not that the season didn't have it's share of duds, because it did. Eps like ""Father Lode"", where Al tries to keep his race track winnings from Peg, ""The Great Escape"", which had the family moving into the shoe store after having a termite problem at home and it ruins Kelly's plans to go to a rock concert, ""Master The Possibilities"", which founds a credit card coming in the mail for dog Buck and the family using it to their fullest advantage, and ""How Do You Spell Revenge"", which had Al trying to improve Peg's softball skills and Kelly's boyfriend wanting her to get a tatoo to proclaim her love for him, were below average. The cast as I said before, have grown into their roles. Ed 'O' Neill was different as Al in the beginning. He had a New Jersey kind of tough guy accent, but he was become the Al we know here. The rest of the cast have easily dissolved into their individual characters here as well. The show was still a little low in the ratings, but it had gained a bit more momentum this season than in the previous year. That would change even more when a housewife from the mid-west made a stink over the content of the show and tried to get it cancelled, but it resulted in making the show even more popular and gave it a huge spike in the ratings. The show got better than season 2, but this sophomore season really got the show rolling.",1075680000,12,3462,4.327692307692308
1206218,5,B00000F5W8,"While the first season of Married with Children was excellent, the second season is when the show really got going! There is not a single bad episode in the lot. There is a major leap in terms of the comedy, plotlines, and the character development, as the show is quickly finding its identity. It is a must own for any MWC fan.
The episodes included are:
1. Poppy's by the Tree (Part 1) - The Bundy's take a vacation in beautiful Dumpwater, Florida (It is as run down as it sounds). At their hotel, they learn of the Axe Murderer that kills the tourists of the hotel they are staying at.
2. Poppy's by the Tree (Part 2) - Al must save Peg when she is kidnapped by the Axe Murderer
3. If I Were a Rich Man - Al goes to the bank with Steve. The day after, one million dollars is missing from the bank. Steve and the Family thinks Al is responsible for stealing the money.
4. Buck Can Do it - The Bundy's get threated with a lawsuit after Buck the dog, umm, gets friendly with another dog. This leads to the family contemplating getting Buck neutered
5. Girls Just Want to Have Fun (Part 1) - Marcy gets into a fight with Steve. To cheer her up, Peg takes her to a male strip club. There, Marcy loses her wedding ring when she stuffs a dollar into the stripper's pants
6. Girls Just Want to Have Fun (Part 2) - The stripper returns the wedding ring to Al, and gives it to Steve. He has to figure out how to approach Marcy about this
7. For Whom the Bell Tolls - A high phone bill causes Al to shut off the phone service in his house, which angers the family and their friends
8. Born to Walk - Kelly gets her license while Al fails his renewal test
9. Alley of the Dolls - Peg meets an old rival from high school and they face off in a bowling match to determine who is a bigger loser. With a member of the Bundy's missing, Steve fills in for the family
10. The Razor's Edge - Steve goes on a rafting trip and comes back with a beard, much to Marcy's disgust
11. How Do You Spell Revenge? - The first softball related episode. Al tries to get Peg to improve her softball skills, while Kelly contemplates getting a tattoo of her boyfriend's name
12. Earth Angel - Bud brings home a beautiful art student to live at the Bundy house. Everyone loves her, except Marcy, who is jealous of her and has plans on getting rid of her
13. You Better Watch Out - A Santa Claus who was supposed to parachute in his arrival at a mall event, plummets to his death... in the Bundy's backyard!
14. Guys and Dolls - Al and Steve trade one of Marcy's classic Barbie dolls. After a fight, Al and Steve have to venture out onto the streets of Chicago to get it back
15. Build a Better Mousetrap - The Bundy's have a mouse in their house, and Al will do whatever it takes to get rid of it
16. Master the Possibilities - Buck the dog receives a pre approved credit card, so the Bundy's go on a huge spending spree
17. Peggy Loves Al Yeah Yeah Yeah - It is Valentines Day, and Peg wants Al to say ""I love you"". The viewers of the show got to vote on what Al should say. Also, Bud has his first Valentine
18. The Great Escape - One of the best episodes ever! The Bundy house is fumigated because of termites. Instead of getting a hotel, Al has the family live at the shoe store. Kelly is grounded but needs to sneak out so she can go to a rock concert. For those who have seen this one, it is the ""Green Meat Attack"" episode
19. Im-Po-Dent - Marcy dents Steve's Mercedes. Steve claims Marcy is making him impotent, and uses this to turn Marcy into his slave
20. Just Married... With Children - Al and Peg find an invitation for a love game show in the Rhoades' mailbox. They pose as Steve and Marcy in order to get on. When the Rhoades find out, they pose as Al and Peg and face off against Al and Peg on the game show, where the key to winning is to survive torture
21. Father Lode - Al wins some money at the racetrack, and he tries to keep it a secret to a suspecting family. Peg finds out and starts stealing from Al's wallet
22. All in the Family - Peg's relatives from Wanker county visit the Bundy's, while Al is trying to watch ""Hondo""
While there may not be much in terms of extras, the DVDs have more than 20 Easter Eggs. Each one is an interview with a cast member, so these should all be very interesting and a nice addition. Do yourself a favor and pick this set up now!",1074124800,89,4355,4.094736842105263

1206485,3,B00000F5W8,"For Married with Children fans, the original neighbor (Steve) was a great straight man for Al's sarcastic comments, a great foil.  This was his last year on the show.
MWC's 2nd season had 22 episodes, including Poppy's by the Tree(a snippy commentary on Florida, showing a steamy hotel where an axe murderer is accepted because he met a minor celebrity), Earth Angel(son Bud brings home a hitchhiker that drives the neighborhood men crazy), Guys and Dolls(childhoods revisited), the Great Escape(camping out in the shoe store), and Just Married with Children (the Bundy's intercept an invitation for the neighbors to go on a TV game show).

Looking at the episodes in total, this is definitely a good, middle-of-the-road, season, with no great episodes and a few that were merely so-so.  Although Steve was a fine comedic actor, his departure actually revived the show, as later years recovered the 'bounce' of the 1st year, driving the series to continue for over a decade.

To sum up, if you are getting the entire series, the whole series is finally out and affordable.  If you're like me and already had some seasons already, this season is so affordable it's worth it to add to get the whole set on your shelf.",1373932800,,1215,4.85024154589372

1206532,5,B00000F5W8,"I LOVE Married With Children, this is not a review of the show so much as an expression of the most annoying peripheral thing of Season 2 I could find.

In far too many episodes, someone in the audience is WHOOPING LIKE A HYENA, WOOHOOHOOWOOHOOHOOWOOHOOHOO at every zinger that it breaks my enjoyment of the show. I can't tell if it's a man, woman, or an actual HYENA in a cage back there somewhere, but goodness it's annoying. If it's a real person, I think they work for Vonage now.

I would pay an extra $5 dollars to have that dubbed out of the audio, it is that bad. I'm such a fan, I've watched it so much that I can pick out different members of the audience by the sound of their laughs and can tell which episodes they attended filming.

The video transfer on this season's DVD is not that great, a bit pixelated. They really should have remastered it since it was filmed in the 80's, but since when has Sony cared what it's customers want? Ho hum and a bottle of rum.

LOVE the show, you will too, buy it anyway despite the HYENA terrorizing the attention span of the cast with that mating call.",1233100800,,1105,4.2727272727272725

The second season from late 1987 to may 1988 has 22 complete episodes here in this DVD boxset completely uncut and without commercials! the first episode is ""Buck Can Do It"" has some of the neighbors complaining that Al's dog is impregnating some of their dogs and demands to be neutered.

The transfers to DVD look and sound good, the Series certainly holds up well today. My only complaint is the awkward menu's just to play the different episodes. Otherwise it was all good.

The total opposite of what a TV family should be, the original working title for the show was Not The Cosbys (a reference to the perfect family atmosphere of the popular 80's sitcom The Cosby Show). Paving the way for ABC's Roseanne, Married With Children more than lived up to its working title, chronicling the pathetic life of a Chicago shoe salesman and his equally dysfunctional family...

Married With Children follows the exploits of the Bundy family, a dysfunctional trailer-park trash family living in American suburbia. The family is headed by Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), a shoe salesman who's lewd, crude, sarcastic, and completely dissatisfied with his life as a loser. Al's wife Peg (Katey Sagal) spends her days watching Oprah and spending what little money Al brings home (she's also Al's greatest source of annoyance). Al and Peg's lives are complicated by their children, Kelly (Christina Applegate), a beautiful yet stupid teenager, and Bud (David Faustino), a sex-starved adolescent. With neighbors Steve (David Garrison), Marcy (Amanda Bearse), and Jefferson (Ted McGinley) dropping in on a regular basis, Al's dreams of a normal family life or a spare moment to relax are continually interrupted by the tortuous reality of his mediocre existence...

The Married With Children (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Poppy's by the Tree"" in which the Bundys head off on their version of a family vacation. While at a sleazy motel in Dumpwater, Florida, they cross paths with a serial killer who loathes tourists. When the killer kidnaps Peg, it's all up to Al to save her life... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Born to Walk"" in which Al fails the test for his driver's license renewal on the same day that his ditzy daughter Kelly passes, and ""Build a Better Mousetrap"" in which Al nearly destroys the Bundy household in pursuit of an invading rodent...

The complete second series is just as good and funny as the first, you simply can't stop laughing!! Al Bundy is helarious. One complaint though, why is Columbia taking so much time to release the rest of the series?? There are 11 series and if each year Columbia releases one, then it's gonna take 11 years to own the whole collection!! Columbia is releasing the first three series of Seinfeld altogether in November and that's great but what about Married...With Children??",1093996800,3,657,4.9818181818181815
1206674,4,B00000F5W8,"During Married With Children's sophomore run, the show became the erratic masquerade party that lead the trail for all other seasons to follow. Television's lovable clan of losers became the talk of the town and it seemed as if everyone was on the edge of this new controversial showcase. If not, they were sure in for some surprises.

Some vital episodes emerged from the wings of its second year. The Christmas classic, ""You Better Watch Out"", ""Just Married.. With Children"" and the two parter ""Poppy's by the Tree"". It's also great to see the development of the characters through the vehicle of dvd sets. It may sound funny, but this was one show that truly evolved through the years.

What hurt this dvd set, isn't the writing, or anything to do with the show. The producers once again failed to leave any assurance for the fan base that literally embraced the show through its eleven year run. Ironically, this show was canned by Fox the same abrupt way. This show made the network into the staple it is today and it feels like it hasn't gotten the true treatment it deserves.

Just like season one, the second season was without a doubt great television that poked fun at the serious side of life. For those who took it for what it was worth and could laugh at ourselves as a society. I say, enjoy The Bundys. They're my kind of dysfunction.",1092182400,,1348,4.5850622406639
1206675,2,B00000F5W8,"THE SHOW:
Season 2 is not jam-packed with great episodes, but there are a few good ones. It's amusing that Kelly is pretty smart in the early going of the series. She's much funnier an airhead of course, can't wait 'til that happens. Bud is getting funnier and funnier. And Al & Peg already have their characters down pretty early in the series which is great!
PICTURE QUALITY:
Discs 1 and 2 for some moronic reason are loaded with NINE episodes each, and the 3rd with only FOUR. Stupid enough for any of you? Yes, these filthy rich companies can't even add for some reason. Does no one check the product before it is released?
Many episodes, especially on the 2nd disk, are plagued with LINES  ON THE SCREEN. A single, translucent vertical line just hangs on the screen in the same place for a few seconds at a time, disappearing then returning, in several episodes (and no, it's not my dvd player or my tv to blame). This is VERY annoying. The 3rd disc, SURPRISE SURPRISE, suffers NO such defects, and the picture is brilliant. I can only attribute these flaws to OVER-COMPRESSION.
DVD PRODUCER'S THOUGHTS: Hmmm. Let's see. 22 episodes on 3 discs. I know! Let's overload the first 2 discs with 9 eps each and leave the third one virtually empty with only 4! It makes perfect sense!
Couldn't they just have done 8+7+7 instead of 9+9+4? DUH???
THE EXTRAS:
Terrible. The ""extras"" are pathetic easter eggs hidden in menu screens you have to search for like a moron. And these so-called extras are nothing but very short CLIPS from the MWC Reunion Special that aired on Fox not too long ago. What the hell?
Why no commentaries? Not even for one episode? I'd love to hear from the creators of the show, or at least the actors for at least ONE episode. Why not?
OVERALL:
An O.K. season of the Bundys on a pretty lousy DVD set. Why couldn't they do this one up right?",1088812800,9,1861,4.489675516224189
1206676,5,B00000F5W8,I have to agree with most of the other people out there who have wrote reviews.  Married with Children is a classic sitcom the same as Andy Griffith or I Love Lucy....  I am anxious to collect all of the seasons as they are released.  I just don't understand why it is taking so much time for them to be released.  I prefer the episodes with Jefferson instead of Steve but I would rank them all with 5 stars.,1084665600,4,408,4.1265822784810124

1206678,5,B00000F5W8,"This show is easily the best there's ever been. The later seasons tend to get a bit too silly and cartoonish, but the first ones are just terrific.
On this DVD, you get all the episodes from the second season along with numerous interviews with the actors. Ok, the quality of the picture could be better, but who cares about this when you can't stop laughing?
It's the quality of the show that counts; moaning about the picture quality has to appear like nitpicking.",1083801600,3,466,4.559523809523809

1206754,5,B00000F5W8,"I won't bore you with details on the episodes included on this set, but I think it fair to note that the five stars I'm giving this set are only due to the fact that it's for a show that I have been anticipating for the last five or so years.
As far as DVD sets are concerned, this set probably ranks at the bottom 10 or so. The 'easter eggs' on the DVD set are not actually easter eggs, since they're actually advertised in the menus, but instead are little snippets reminiscent of what are usually called ""featurettes"" (of which there are too few).
I'm glad MWC is finally out on DVD, but saddened by the fact that these DVD's only fulfill the bare minimum - which is quite unfortunate for such a funny, refreshing and ahead-of-its-time TV show.",1083110400,,747,4.3428571428571425

I don't understand why they wouldn't, a true married with children fan doesn't need extra stuff on the dvd, they just need the classic shows themselves.  Though the show does have the Married with Children Reunion, Trailers and Easter Eggs, so I believe they're mighty impressive.  Al, Peg, Bud, Kelly and the neighbors Marcy and Steve Rhoades are all hilarious in this second season Married With Children.  I give it an A.  I just wish they'd release the other seasons quicker, its hard to wait on them.  At this rate, it will be a decade before all of them come out.",1081900800,,696,4.564516129032258

The female cast members,Katey Sagal as Peggy,Christina Applegate as Kelly and Amanda Bearse as Marcy,changed their hairstyles. Toward the end of this season,David Faustino's voice deepens.

Now, I am a blind person, but still use the word ""See."" Get over it.  Well, as such, it doesn't bother me that the picture quality isn't good. My wife, who can see, hates the Bundys, so this buy will be for me alone--like Al's vast collection of dirty magazines.  I called ""arrried with Children,"" by quite a different title--""Psychotherapy for the Mind that can't afford it.""  The re-runs were on at 5 P.M., exactly the time I stopped working every day.  After a brutal day at the job, facing another lonely night, the Bundys were my relief. At that time I identified with Bud--smart, and cosmically defeated when it came to finding a girl.  Now that I have a wife, and have for 6 years, I identify with Al. a middle-aged, plodding working man, trying to keep his wife from spending 100 times more than he can earn in a lifetime.

1206760,3,B00000F5W8,"We need more people reviewing these DVD sets AFTER they've actually bought them. It's easy to review the show and say how great it was, but what about the quality of the DVDs, what about the extra features? Fine, the second season of Married With Children gets 4 out of 5 stars. It's a slight improvement over the first season, and still beats out some of the goofier/sillier/cartoonish later seasons (you know, for example, like where they show episodes about Kelly landing her own TV show in Hollywood, or where Al sees Aliens stealing his socks - the sort of outlandish - but still hilarious - stuff you'd NEVER see in these early seasons of the series).
As for the DVDs themselves, they're average looking. They aren't what you'd expect of top quality DVDs, but they are serviceable. It's not like you're expecting to watch a widescreen presentation of some awesome sci-fi or fantasy show that dwells on visuals. This is just a comedy, meant for laughs, and what you're seeing on these discs is better than what you'd record on VHS. They squeeze 22 episodes onto 3 discs, which is a tight fit. So there's noticeable compression in the overall look of the show, plus it's grainy and blurry at various times. But it's not so noticeable that it takes you out of the stories. You soon lose yourself in the laughter and forget about the so-so look of the picture.
The much talked about easter egg ""bonus features"" are simply unaired portions of the cast talking during the reunion special they aired in early 2003. Most of the clips are short, between 30 seconds to a minute. Sometimes it's interesting, sometimes it's like, ""Huh?"" But I hated the easter egg idea. It's not fun when you goof around with your remote looking for a specific clip, and then you are ""rewarded"" with a quick 30 seconds or so of cast members talking over each other in a chaotic way about what they thought of the show. Yikes. Stop with the easter eggs. No more! Just place any special features in the menu in a regular way in the future, thank you!
Oh, did I mention they include on the DVD a bunch of advertisements for other shows? Yeah, gee...thanks Sony.

I was a teenager when these shows were on...and it is nice to go down memory lane again.  :)  The best episodes in this set have to be the one where Al has the phone cut off because he refuses to pay the bill, and the one where Al and Peg go on the game show as Marcy and Steve.

You didn't have to think when you watched the Bundy's, you just had to laugh. Tang Wipes, the physical humor, and how can you not laugh at Buck? The hidden easter eggs are outtakes from the reunion special, and while there are quite a few, most are just uninteresting. But the episodes are great.
