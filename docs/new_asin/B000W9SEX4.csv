2963860,4,B000W9SEX4,Claude Rains!!  Wow!  The only actor to EVER successfully upstage Bette Davis in a scene!  He could do anything!  I truly miss him.  A great actor...,1319673600,,149,4.576923076923077
2963861,5,B000W9SEX4,"Claude Raines was a great actor probably known most for his
role as the father in The Wolfman! but I think this is his
best movie. I can't believe nobody commented on this. I've
had this on vhs for years watched twice. I just finished
watching it again and it's still great. The story about a
fake fortune teller who becomes a clairvoyant by predicting
a train wreck. He then goes on to predict another disaster
and is put on trail for causing accident. Fay Wray plays his
wife and fantastic and beautiful as always. This is a must
for old mystery/horror fans with great story and acting!",1306627200,3,588,4.453703703703703
2963862,3,B000W9SEX4,"First, let me say that I saw this movie on TCM a while back and fell in love with it.  Hoping to add it my collection one day, I was stunned to see it while browsing through this site.  My disappointment came when I began to view it and realized that something was missing.  There is an opening steamship sequence that lasts about 8 minutes that is missing from this print.  Hopefully the british copy will surface on DVD one day soon.  The packaging claims that the movie is 90 minutes long...I think originally it was around 83, but this print is closer to 69.  If you are a Rains or Wray fan, then it is better than nothing.  If you are a completist I would skip this print.",1300579200,12,677,4.2015503875969

8221902,5,B000W9SEX4,I saw this movie listed on Prime and thought why not watch it? I loved it. Good storyline and acting.,1491436800,,101,4.1
8221903,4,B000W9SEX4,"I've came up with my own character in this film, but my story is a sequel to this film. Go Maximus! Go Claude!

8221908,3,B000W9SEX4,A good movie but is in bad need of restoration.  The poor quality of both audio and video made it too hard to watch and hear.  I gave up after 20 or 30 minutes.  Streaming in standard definition didn't help matters either.,1441670400,,222,4.238095238095238

Along w/ his wife / assistant, Rene (Fay Wray- DOCTOR X, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, THE VAMPIRE BAT, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, KING KONG) he tells people what objects they're holding, while blind-folded. Of course, it's all just an act. One night, a bizarre incident occurs, causing Maximus to actually present evidence of real telepathic ability! After predicting and preventing a train wreck, Max decides to cash in on his new-found psychic powers, demanding a huge pay increase. Then, he makes a prediction on a horse race, calling a 100-1 horse as the winner! Not surprisingly, this all goes to Maximus' head, causing great strain on his marriage. Tragedy soon strikes, and the truth is revealed about the source of Maximus' power. THE EVIL MIND is a suitably melodramatic, supernatural thriller. Raines and Wray are splendid in their roles. Entertaining and different...",1416096000,,962,5.173076923076923
