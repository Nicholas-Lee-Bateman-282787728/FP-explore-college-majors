1644028,5,B00005Q3Z4,"My favorite version of the Nutcracker is that produced by the Royal Ballet in the '80s. My family taped it off PBS on Beta (remember that?) and I would watch it every Christmas.

I was hesitant to buy this version over the older version, but I am glad I did. I have seen only a couple versions of the Nutcracker, but from those I can say that the transformation scene is this one is AMAZING. There is a whole section on the DVD devoted to explaining how it was accomplished.

The performance is better than most, it is fairly traditional. The extras add to the understanding of the performance and I value them almost as much as the actually ballet on this DVD.",1102118400,8,661,4.365853658536586
1644029,5,B00005Q3Z4,"This is the Best Nutcracker Ballet Perfomance I have seen on DVD so Far. The Sound and Picture Quality is Great and the Stage has been Decorated Very Well for Certain Scenes and it looks Very beautiful. The Other Good thing is that the DVD Maker tells you the Brief Story of ""The Nutcracker"" step by step during the Movie which is missing from other Nutcracker dvd perfomances so basically if you do not know nothing what is ""The Nutcraker"" then you will get a little idea about what it is to enjoy the entire movie. All the Performers acted very well especially the Sugar Plum Fairy and the Clara. A Must Own DVD for a Nutcracker Fan to enjoy with the whole family during christmas and holidays.",1094688000,11,696,4.4453125
1644030,5,B00005Q3Z4,"This version of the nutcracker is an old design by Julia Trevelyan Oman but has been re-done for the recently modernised and enlarged Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Taking full advantage of the new machinery, the Transformation scene is masterly, and the resultant ""miniaturisation"" of the cast is magical.

Of course, any ballet stands or falls by its dancing and in this performance Alina Cojocaru and Ivan Putrov as Clara and Hans-Peter are exemplary. Jonathan Cope is a wonderfully noble Prince. The whole production is a feast for the eye and comes as near to perfection as can be hoped for in this world. Sir Anthony Dowell plays Drosselmeyer and looks uncannily like Dame Ninette de Valois in his powdered wig! The sound quality is excellent.  The disc also includes interviews with Dowell and the choreographer, Sir Peter Wright, and includes a fascinating demonstration and explanation of how the special effects are achieved. Buy it now!",1059091200,21,950,5.083333333333333
1644061,5,B00005Q3Z4,"Of the three productions of The Nutcracker that I own on DVD, this production is by far the best!  The scenery, the choreography, and the costumes are more in-line with how I would imagine The Nutcracker ought to be performed.",1384560000,3,226,4.65
1644062,1,B00005Q3Z4,"This cd is exactly like the one I saw on utube.
I had to be that one.  It will become a tradition at
Christmas.",1370649600,,111,3.625
1644063,5,B00005Q3Z4,"I have been looking for this version of the nutcracker for a long time. It is the shown on PBS Great Performances. The costumes,sets,music and dancing are amazing. I highly recommend this DVD if you like the Nutcracker Ballet.",1360108800,3,226,4.82051282051282
1644064,5,B00005Q3Z4,"I have two short parts to this review.

First off, I would likely to mention the order itself. Even though the DVD was on backorder for a few days, I was still very pleased with everything. The packaging was perfectly done. The DVD case wasn't chipped nor was the DVD scratched (which can sometimes happen during shipping).

Now for the second half: the movie itself. Every December I watch the world's top five Nutcracker ballets on the Ovation channel. The Royal Opera House is my absolute favorite version and I was thrilled to discover this DVD was the same one I always watched. Sometimes, the actors on the TV program are different than the actual DVD (there is another version of this with a different guy for the Nutcracker) but this DVD had the same people that made me love it. I've read some reviews that talk about how much shorter Miyako Yoshida (Sugarplum Princess) is than her prince, Jonathan Cope, and that it somewhat hurts the performance quality but I disagree. I find the height difference adorable and her preformance absolutely elegant.

Anyway, I would recommend this product completely. If you don't know anything about the ballet, it may be a little hard for you to get into since there isn't any talking but it is definitely a movie that should be given a chance.",1353974400,5,1290,4.699115044247788
1644065,5,B00005Q3Z4,"First let me say that I am a dancer and have seen my share of nutcracker productions. The dancing in this version is awesome. Alina cojocaru is one of the finest ballerinas of our time and even at this young age her talent shines through. I think this is e best nutcracker production available on DVD right now. It is a little less flashy than balanchine's version, but if you are looking for quality this is it. I will say that the sugarplum fairy is not the most stunning dancer at the royal ballet, but Alina more than makes up for any disappointment ere",1346544000,2,557,4.365384615384615
1644066,5,B00005Q3Z4,"I regard Tchaikovsky's music for the Nutcracker ballet as one of the dozen or so greatest pieces of music ever composed. Frankly, I am more a fan of the music that of the ballet itself. But, having recently purchased -- and watched -- this DVD, I am very glad that I did. I enjoyed it thoroughly and highly recommend it to others.",1325808000,2,330,4.338709677419355
1644067,5,B00005Q3Z4,"My 1-year old daughter was so entranced by the magic of this version of the Nutcracker during Comcast's seasonal battle of various nutcrackers.  It is a traditional version -- almost Dickens'ey type of production.  Magical and oh, so sweet.  She can sit for hours and watch it over & over.  And she even dances to it as the little children participate in many of the opening scenes.  Just charming.",1300060800,4,398,4.7101449275362315
1644068,4,B00005Q3Z4,"I have shown this 2000 Royal Ballet Version to my elementary students. Normally it is hard for students to sit still for more than a few minutes during the holiday season, but they were totally enchanted with the costumes, the story, and the dancing. In fact, even though some of my students have been in local productions of the Nutcracker, they say this film is one of the best productions they have ever seen. I have seen other Royal Ballet versions, and the Baryshnikov version--this one has more passion and more style. In fact, only a few of my students knew about the Mama Gigione version they had seen in local ballet productions. I highly recommend this to all serious Nutcracker aficionados.",1292803200,6,701,4.754098360655738
1644069,5,B00005Q3Z4,"I very much like the feeling of being at a live theater here.  In this DVD one never forgets the stage presence, the audience, and the orchestra in the pit. Although not a full symphony orchestra (and many CD's of the nutcracker are done by regular orchestra), this performance is from a distinquished ballet pit orchestra and conducted by a true master of Tchaikovsky, Evgenii Svetlanov who knows how to wring from the score passion and grand musical effects despite being restricted to a pulse designed for dancers to follow.  The Choreographer made an interesting comment that he avoided some of the usual cuts because the music is so wonderful that one must trust Tchaikovsky to have done the right thing as I do believe he did!  I especially liked the involvement of the lead characters during the fantasy dances at the ""Kingdom of Sweets"".  Children are fully employed to fine effect and the camera work successfully balances between just enough closeups to reveal character and emotion while mostly showing off all the dancing in its full glory. Strongly recommended!  Now...how do I get this music out of my head?",1292630400,5,1121,4.878947368421053
1644070,5,B00005Q3Z4,"I originally viewed this version on TV and had to order it immediately.  That was 4 years ago, and since then I have given it as gifts.  For the last 3 years, I have taken my two, still young, grandsons (now 10 and 8) to see the Nutcracker during holiday time - not a children's version. They love it and love my DVD.  I tried showing them a version that should appeal to children, but they were disappointed with the missing parts, and it not following the original exactly.  Now, I am ordering another copy for them to see when not visiting me. I personally love the gorgeous costumes, consider the dancing outstanding, and the music a delight. Maybe if I were a ballet expert, I could find something to be picky about, but for the vast majority of us who enjoy the Nutcracker, it is more than perfect.  I find myself smiling, sometimes applauding, and often sighing in delight, as I am viewing it.  Could it be any better?",1291593600,7,925,4.411764705882353
1644091,4,B00005Q3Z4,"I fear that the Nutcracker may be referred to as ""pop"" ballet and to a certain respect that may be true; but, oh, that music of Tchaikovsky...spellbinding to say the least. The Royal Ballet does itself proud with its classic interpretation and exquisite dancing. If you wish to make your Christmas warm and enchanting gather your family around the TV and experience the Royal Ballet's Nutcracker.",1289952000,4,396,5.015151515151516
1644092,5,B00005Q3Z4,"The world's most famous (some might, rightfully, say overdone) Christmas ballet receives an opulent, excellent treatment from the Royal Ballet at London's Covent Garden; designed by Julia Trevelyan Oman and choreographed by Peter Wright.
Even if you have seen ""The Nutcracker"" for what seems like a millon Christmas Seasons in a row, there is no denying the powerful, endearing spell of Tchaivosky's immortal ballet score.
  The plot is as familar as ""The Wizard Of Oz."" Hans-Peter has been transformed into a Nutcracker. His mysterious and magical Uncle Drosslmeyer (Sir Anthony Dowell) hopes that his god-daughter Clara can break the curse. During a midnight Christmas Eve Battle, Clara saves the Nutcracker from the Mouse King. Transformed into a human male once again, Hans-Peter transports Clara to the Kingdom OF Sweets; where they perform a series of celebratory dances with the Sugar-Plum Fairy, her Prince, and several other fantasy characters.
  Several productions have emphasized a dark and disturbing ""connection/relationship"" between Clara and Drosslmeyer. In this production, there is (thankfully) an emphasis on fantasy and magic. Alina Cojocaru is perfectly cast as a beguiled and beguiling Clara. Ivan Putrov is a strikingly handsome Hans-Peter/Nutcracker Prince. This is a definitive production that belongs in every Christmas DVD library.",1262822400,9,1358,5.642156862745098
1644093,5,B00005Q3Z4,"When my daughters were younger, I took them to a local children's production of ""The Nutcracker."" The girls were under the age of 5, and were familiar with music and art from trips to art galleries, cds played at home, and Baby Einstein videos (yes...they educated my kids!). After the production, I sought a DVD and this was the one I purchased. I thought it was a bit pricey at the time, but it was well worth it! And I was concerned that it would be ""too adult"" for them, namely a grown-up production without all the fancy colors or cartoon/toy characters that often are used to entertain children. My purchase was a good one -- and a lesson to me on how children don't need to stick with products geared toward them. My daughters were amazed at the beauty and splendor of the music, dance and sets. We even would watch it in July! Because of their interest, I purchased ""Peter and the Wolf"" and ""Swan Lake"" from the same company. Again, favorites of my daughters. The girls now are turning nine and ten over the holidays, and ""The Nutcracker"" is a must-see holiday treat!",1258502400,4,1075,4.489795918367347
1644094,5,B00005Q3Z4,"This is a wonderful classical version of The Nutcracker, with fabulous sets, costumes, color, and lighting. It is a Sir Peter Wright production, so it is authentic throughout, with the exception that there is no Mother Gigogne and her little clowns.

This is a good example of classical ballet as the originators saw it. Peter Wright usually sticks to tradition in his productions, and you won't see ""gimmicks"" used that distract from it's originality. It is a live stage production from the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden, with an audience, but it is not a ""noisy"" stage, that is, you will hear the point shoes but they are not distracting. The British audiences are very restrained in their enthusiasm and do not interrupt the dances with applause.

Clara is danced by Alina Cojocaru, a perpetually young ballerina who is able to dance in the final act with her Nutcracker Prince, Ivan Petrov, and not just a spectator ""guest"" in the magic Kingdom of Sweets. The toymaker Drosselmeyer, is played by Anthony Dowell. The Sugar Plum Fairy is danced Meyako Yoshida, who is absolutely beautiful in her role. Her partner is Jonathan Cope, who partnered with Leanne Benjamin in the Royal Ballet production of The Firebird (another must have DVD)......<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stravinsky-The-Firebird-Les-Noces-Royal-Ballet/dp/B0000714CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stravinsky - The Firebird & Les Noces / Royal Ballet</a>.....Cope is very tall, and Yoshida is quite short, so, she is a diminutive little doll next to him. I cannot begin to tell you how much I loved her as the Sugar Plum Fairy.

As I said, the sets and costumes in this ballet are spectacular, the lighting perfect and the music magnificent. Need any more superlatives? The running time is 107 minutes, which is about right for a complete Nutcracker. There are about 25 minutes of bonus material, which is very informative, telling how they made the Christmas tree ""grow"", among other things happening ""backstage"". I believe you will enjoy this ""classical"" version of ""The Nutcracker"".........Richard.",1233187200,23,2111,5.410334346504559
1644095,5,B00005Q3Z4,"I agree with some of the assessments made by reviewer Ivy Lin, above, however, I disagree with others.  This production of the beloved Christmas classic by the Royal Ballet does indeed incline more to the older Russian than the later Balanchine interpretation, which is more familiar to American audiences.  I happen to prefer the former.  I also agree with Ms. Lin that the dancing of Alina Cojocaru is one of the chief pleasures of this very traditional and pleasing production, which is everything a Nutcracker ought to be, including the obligatory boring turns by parental figures in Victorian clothes and tiresome little boys.  Cojocaru is particularly gorgeous to watch once she takes off the little-girl dress and earmuff hair-do at the end of the first act, and gets to really, REALLY dance.  Cojocaru's technique IS beautiful.  Yes, she is all long ethereal limbs, big jumps, arched back, beautiful feet, and expressive hands.  Curiously, and here is where I disagree with Ms. Lin, Cojocaru shares another trademark that sometimes accompanies all those wonderful characteristics of Russian-school training (Cojocaru is Romanian): a bit too much awareness of just how appealing those extravagant extensions, that back-arching, and those gamboling, coltish limbs are.  In fact, all that coltish, ethereal, arched-back, long-limbed gamboling got to be a bit tiresome for me at some point, especially as Anthony Dowell, attuned no doubt to the wishes of his audience vis-a-vis his new star, allowed Peter Wright, the choerographer, to insert Cojocaru into every single place in the choreography that he possibly could, including places where Clara traditionally doesn't dance: the dance of the Snowflakes, the Chinese Dance, the Russian Dance, the Waltz of the Flowers, etc.  I'm sure the soloists in those pieces were just THRILLED to find their brief moments in the spotlight dimmed by the omnipresence of Cojocaru, whether she belonged there or not.  I found myself muttering, ""Enough already!""  There WERE other dancers worth watching on stage, notably the chief Rose Fairy, Zenaida Yanofsky, in Wright's verision of the Waltz of the Flowers.  A tall, elegant dancer with beautiful legs, a huge jump, and outstanding technique, Yanofsky was a great pleasure to watch - I would have preferred to watch her go on dancing rather than to see her coyly bringing Cojocaru back to center stage.  By the end of the Waltz of the Flowers, it was, in my opinion, rather a pleasure to turn from the adorable, ethereal,coltish, gamboling Cojocaru to the more regal dancing of Miyako Yoshida, the Sugar Plum Fairy.  In response to Ms. Lin's criticisms, it certainly wasn't Ms. Yoshida's fault that the tall Darcey Bussell pulled out and the short Ms. Yoshida was called upon to substitute for her, and dance with the very tall Jonathan Cope. Both are compleat professionals: they did their jobs and did them well.  Yoshida IS a bit too short for truly great line, but she nevertheless turned in a lovely performance, with beautiful phrasing, delicate, perfect footwork, and great security; her solo in the big pas de deux was faultless.  For me, far from being a painful contrast to Cojocaru, Yoshida's more womanly presence was just as pleasurable to watch; there is room in the world for accomplished dancers who are not ethereal, long-limbed, back-arching, gamboling, coltish wonders (whose style would have been inappropriate as Sugar Plum Fairy, anyway).  Ivan Putrov, the Nutcracker and Clara's dream prince, is worth st least as much attention as Cojocaru.  He was wonderful: his technique blended power and elegance, with high jumps, crisp turns, and gorgeous legs.  He was a sympathetic dramatic presence and a fine partner. As one expects from the Royal, all the set pieces were well-danced and expertly mimed.  As for Anthony Dowell's cape-waving as Herr Drosselmeyer, really, it's ""Nutcracker"" and Drosselmeyer - what do you really expect in the way of character development?! The sets are beautiful, as are the costumes, the Christmas angels, the special effects, and all the soloists.  This is just what a Nutcracker should be.  I enjoyed it immensely and rewatch it at least twice each Christmas season.",1196380800,72,4213,5.1737849779086895

1644097,5,B00005Q3Z4,"I love this DVD! I have loved The Nutcracker story since I was a kid, and was pleased with how this story unfolded. Despite other reviews, I did not find that Drosselmeyer waved his cape around too much, I thought that it fit his role, and without it he would have been lacking something. I also thought that the Sugar Plum Fairy and her prince went together well, and showed a lot of chemistry. I thought that they each fit their roles wonderfully! I have already watched this ballet several times, and my two daughters (ages 5&2) have even sat and watched a good portion of it with me. I am very pleased with my purchase.",1186876800,18,623,4.379310344827586
1644098,5,B00005Q3Z4,"This is one of my favorite versions of the Nutcracker.  Unlike the opinion of the previous reviewer, I was totally enchanted with Miyako Yoshida as the Sugar Plum Fairy.  She is my favorite in this role and is simply breathtaking.  She gives this role more grace and life than many who have danced this role.  The set and costumes are lovely and, in the usual style of the Royal Ballet, the overall performance is superb!",1169251200,19,421,4.573333333333333
1644099,5,B00005Q3Z4,"There's so little of the great Jonathan Cope available on DVD or VHS that it's a joy to have him as the prince in the Nutcracker. Add Anthony Dowell as a superbly magical Drosselmeyer, a spectacular transformation scene, Yoshida as the sugar plum fairy, fine dancing all round, & you have a Nutcracker to go back to again and again.",1135641600,5,332,4.55
1644100,2,B00005Q3Z4,"I felt the director and choreographer took too much liberty in deviating from the original.  I have seen many live and recorded versions of the Nutcracker, including the famous Ruth Page version in Chicago which ran annually for over 25 years.  Never before have I seen such dowdy costumes in the opening party scene, or men dancing in the Waltz of the Flowers.  What bothered me the most was the complete omission of Mother Ginger, one of my favorite characters in the ballet.  Additionally, I though the inclusion of a suitor for Clara in the party scene was unnecessary.

I did appreciate the work done by the dancers who played Clara and the Sugar Plum Fairy.",1103414400,9,663,4.681034482758621

7949608,5,B00005Q3Z4,"I have owned this for years now, and I love this production.  Nearly every year I'm able to take our daughter to see our local production of this ballet, and while I always love that, and nothing really compares to seeing it live, truth be told, it's pretty hard to beat the British Royal Ballet's Nutcracker productions.  And while I would never wish to demean the artistry and talents of our local performers, because I love being able to see their production every year,  I do find that I love the choreography and dancing in this production more. I've seen more then one on video over the years, and they are always superbly done. I'm not by any means any sort of expert in these matters, I just happen to enjoy ballet performances, and this happens to be one of my favorites.",1487203200,,780,4.47887323943662
7949609,5,B00005Q3Z4,"Out of my eight Nutcracker DVDs and all of the Nutcrackers presented on Ovation Channel's 'Battle of the Nutcracker' over the years, this Royal Ballet version is my favorite.  The dancing is superb, the sets opulent, and the costumes in muted sepia and pastels, really lovely.  Herr Drosselmeyer has a gorgeous turquoise and silver cape, that he swishes and swirls to great effect throughout the dance.

I am also fond of the way the story has been slightly changed to give it a happy ending.  It is much more satisfying than having Clara wake up and discover that her Nutcracker prince was just a fantastic dream.  Herr Drosselmeyer gets his happy ending, too.

This Nutcracker begins with a very slow tempo, possibly because we're getting the back-story concerning Drosselmeyer and the Queen of the Mice, and the transformation of his nephew, Hans-Peter into an ugly wooden nutcracker.

The children are much better behaved than in most Nutcrackers, perhaps because the dancing mistress carries a cane--or it might be because of the two Krampus devils who accompany St. Nicholas onto the stage.  They appear to be looking for naughty children to stuff into the caskets on their backs!

This Nutcracker is filled with delightful surprises like the Krampus figures.  Four boys dressed as 18th Century gentlemen in gray and silver are one such elegant addition, even though they are on-stage for just a few cameo appearances.  The Christmas Angel that appears only to Clara is yet another fine touch.  She is later joined by her sister angels to guide Clara and a transformed Hans-Peter to the Kingdom of Sweets.

Miyako Yoshida and Jonathan Cope as the Sugar Plum Fairy and her consort performed a lyrical, visually gorgeous pas de deux in what was the highlight of the dance for me.  If you only buy one Nutcracker, it should be this Royal Ballet version.",1482364800,,1856,4.907051282051282
