I thought it would actually show the whole performances of the different acts so we could really see it and enjoy it over and over, but it was more the making of / behind the scenes and a dramatization of the ice problems with the portable ice rink.  Not a DVD we will watch again.  :(",1515369600,,332,4.238095238095238

8375912,1,B002IORS5G,"what a waste of my money purchasing this dvd , i have never considered criticize a video show until this one. to add insult it was in Bluray to make matters worse, i'm not blaming the acrobatic troupe who were trying to perform there show but the organizers and camera crews mainly, let's face it, who want to sit and watch an ice rink fail to freeze, by the time it almost had the poor kids were so dissapointed and downhearted one would have to feel sorry and as frustrated as they. it would pay the producers and executives of a show this bad to sit down and watch it first before releasing it, and i must say it did not live up to my standards of what 1920 x 1080p presentation should be . i hope they try to achieve a better endeavor next time around.",1258675200,5,756,4.149659863945578
