7815656,5,6301802667,"Stowaway is an excellent, classic film starring Shirley Temple, Robert Young and Alice Faye! The other actors give flawless performances, too. When they say this is one of Shirley Temples best films if not her best ever they certainly aren't jokingI loved this film and even though I admit I had some idea of how it would all work out that didn't diminish my desire to watch the film all the way through and enjoy it! No wonder, tooShirley dances, sings and acts superbly. The plot moves along at a very good pace; I was never once bored nor did the action ever go too fast for me to follow along. The choreography and cinematography both reflect careful forethought and the use of lighting helps greatly to set the tone and mood of each and every scene. The musical score couldn't have been any better, either!

A young American girl named Barbara Stewart aka Ching-Ching (Shirley Temple) lives in the rural Chinese village of Sanchow with her guardians; she was orphaned after her missionary parents were killed by bandits. And bandits are coming again! Nevertheless, her guardian Alfred Kruikshank (William Stack) refuses to let Ching-Ching go to a safer place even though his wife (Helen Jerome Eddy) and the village magistrate Sun Lo (Philip Ahn) plead with him to let the child go.

But Sun Lo tells Ching-Ching he will send her anyway with someone he trusts to Shanghai where his brother lives; she can be safe there until the troubles in Sanchow are over. Unfortunately, Sun Los plan doesnt work outthe man who was to take Ching-Ching to Sun Los brother steals her purse when they get to Shanghai and leaves the poor orphaned girl alone on his boat while he gambles away what little money she had! Ching-Ching then cant find the man who was to take her to Sun-Los brother and so she starts to wander the streets of Shanghai lonely and hungry with her dog Mr. Woo.

Ching-Ching has a stroke of good luckshe meets wealthy American playboy Tommy Randall (Robert Young) on the street and helps him score a deal on a dragons head at a marketplace. Tommy very quickly becomes fond of the child but when Tommy briefly leaves Ching-Ching alone in his car and it starts to rain, Ching-Ching climbs into the back seat and closes the topand when she falls asleep there and the car gets lifted with her still sleeping in it Ching-Ching becomes a stowaway on a luxury ocean liner!

Fortunately for Ching-Ching, Tommy and his butler Atkins (Arthur Treacher) are aboard the ship even though Ching-Ching has the unpleasant experience of being caught in the cabin of nasty old Mrs. Hope (Helen Westley) who is travelling with her future daughter-in-law Susan Parker (Alice Faye). Eventually Tommy and Ching-Ching reunite onboard the ship and when Tommy meets Susan they begin to fall for each other even though Susan is engaged to Richard Hope (Allan Lane), Mrs. Hopes son.

It may seem as if Ive given it all away but theres plenty more to the plot and Ill stop here to avoid giving away too many spoilers! Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how everything works out.

Look also for Shirley to do a fantastic job with her Al Jolson impersonation and she dances with a dummy to give a great impersonation of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire! Shirley sings some wonderful songs, too, including You Gotta S-M-I-L-E to Be H-A-Double-P-Y! Eugene Pallette plays the Colonel and J. Edward Bromberg plays Judge Booth. Stowaway is a great film for any Shirley Temple fan as well as fans of the other actors in the movie.

This VHS edition of the film is also terrific for people who still like their films on VHS. People who like films with adventure, musical numbers and some family themes will not be disappointed, either.",1395446400,,3720,4.687595712098009
