441221,4,6302233852,"a good if somewhat campy movie , decent story line , the acting a little stiff, but all in all , the story, the classic bikes well worth watching , i have seen it several times and will watch it again",1348444800,,200,3.902439024390244
441222,5,6302233852,"I looked all over my area for this movie and could not find it. While perhaps not the best made movie, it does show the WWII harleys used at that time. I loved watching it and would recamend that anyone that has an interest for old harleys, whatch it.",1344124800,,251,4.142857142857143
441223,4,6302233852,"I liked it for the motorcycle bits.  I've been making up a wish list of movies I'd like to buy, but this one isn't available on DVD. Too bad, really.",1188691200,,149,3.966666666666667
441224,4,6302233852,I liked the plot of this movie.  John Stamos actually knows how to ride.  The race sceen is pretty cool.,1057104000,,104,4.15
441225,3,6302233852,"This action movie is a fond memory for me.  I originally watched it because of John Stamos, but now that I don't really care one way or another about him, I still appreciate the movie a little for what it is; a motorcycle/war/action flick.  Stamos does a bang-up job, there is an exploding motorcycle for those who go for that, and of course, a little love story on the side.  So, if you like Stamos, or if you like to see motorcycles burst into flames, watch this movie.",1033948800,2,471,4.329545454545454

7822864,5,6302233852,"Love movie, it really showcases the old bikes and how they road them in the war.  Watch it for the 1940's bikes, they take a talent to ride the old ones.  John Stamos isn't bad to look at either.  So wish they would finally release this on DVD!",1502323200,,244,4.041666666666667

7822866,4,6302233852,Actually used period correct Harleys not new ones made to look old,1472342400,,66,4.583333333333333

7822869,5,6302233852,"This movie really flew under the radar and is not very well known.  Not a huge Stamos fan, but love history, motorcycles and Stamos did a very good job in this debut movie.",1370044800,,172,4.212121212121212
7822870,4,6302233852,I watched this when it first came out and it was good then.  I still think it's a good movie today.  Just wish I could put it on a dvd to save as a backup.,1365465600,,155,3.4
7822871,3,6302233852,A nice movie with cute guys and some history tied into it. John Stamos has always reminded me of an Elvis doppleganger. This movie is an Elvis movie without music.,1363219200,,163,4.466666666666667
