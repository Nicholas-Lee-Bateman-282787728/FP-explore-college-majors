5091607,5,B007JLSFEQ,"""Eagle's Wing"" (1979) is one of the most beautiful westerns ever filmed, and in addition, it's a thought provoking look at the old West from a very different perspective. The film includes Martin Sheen, Sam Waterson, and Harvey Keitel, but the real star is the beautiful white stallion that links the main characters.

Martin Sheen (1940) was hot in 1979. He had been nominated for an Emmy for his performances in ""The Execution of Private Slovak"" (1974) and ""Taxi!!"" (1978) and for a Golden Globe in ""The Subject was Roses"" (1968) and ""Blind Ambition"" (1979). ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) was a huge hit and came out the same year as this film. Sheen plays a fur trader.

Harvey Keitel (1939) is probably one of the finest actors still working. He was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his role in ""Bugsy"" (1991), but the fact is he has sooo many great performances (e.g., ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Mean Streets"" ""Pulp Fiction"",  ""Smoke"" and especially ""Bad Lieutenant"") it's hard to list them all. Keitel plays Sheen's partner.

Sam Waterston (1940) is best known from his years on ""Law and Order"", but he has stacked up the awards over the years apart from his work on that show - 5 Emmy nominations and 1 win (""Lost Civilizations""), 6 Golden Globe nominations and 1 win (""I'll Fly Away""), and 1 Oscar nomination for ""The Killing Fields"" (1984). In this film he plays an Indian.

Anthony Harvey (1931) directs. Primarily an editor, he directed only 8 films and was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Lion in Winter"" (1968) and won the DGA for that film.

Billy Williams (1929) won the award for best Cinematography from the Briotish Society of Cinematographers for this film. In addition, he was nominated 3 times for an Oscar and won for ""Gandhi"" (1982). His other notable films include ""On Golden Pond"" (1981), ""The Wind and the Lion"" (1975), and ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" (1971).

The NY Times' Janet Maslin called it ""a taciturn drama"" and ""thick with atmosphere"".

The top grossing films in 1979 were ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", ""Rocky 2"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Star Trek"", and ""Alien"". The big Oscar winner was ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" (Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actress) and Sally Field won for ""Norma Rae"". Other notable films that year were ""All that Jazz"", ""Being There"", ""The China Syndrome"", ""Mad Max"", ""Life of Bryan"", and ""Zulu Dawn"". Westerns were not particularly popular that year, and only a few forgettable ones appeared - ""The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again"", ""Butch and Sundance, The Early Years"", etc.

This is a unique western, beautifully photographed.",1306368000,5,2571,4.905529953917051

5091614,4,B007JLSFEQ,"I always liked this atypical 1979 British western and I was glad to discover that it didn't age at all. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Somewhere in the 1850s, certainly well before the War Between States, on USA-Mexico border four separate groups of people are travelling through the wilderness, each minding their own business:

- two fur traders, Pike (Martin Sheen) and Henry (Harvey Keitel), are looking for a group of Kiowa Indians they are supposed to make business with

- a group of Kiowa Indians, led by a great war chief who I believe is called Red Sky; the Kiowa are on their way to meet white fur traders; Red Sky rides a precious and beautiful white horse called Eagle's Wing; this splendid animal can outrun any other horse...

- a middle aged stunningly beautiful and clearly very rich Mexican widow (Stephane Audran, fabulous) travels by coach in company of her brother in law, her two handmaidens, an American Catholic priest (John Castle) and the sister of the latter, a cute young girl named Judith (Caroline Langrishe), who is kind of a spoiled brat. Following the coach rides a hearse carrying the body of her deceased husband...

- a Comanche war party looking for trouble, murder and loot; amongst the Comanche ""bravos"" is an exceptionally tall and strong half-breed named White Bull (Sam Waterstone, of ""Law and Order"" fame); he clearly is respected for his abilities but disliked because of his origins...

That covers like first 5 minutes of the film. Those four groups will of course meet and interact in various interesting ways and then some other players will also appear, but I will say no more about the story. It is worth to be discovered by yourself.

Beeing a British western, this film is of course an atypical and even exotic treat, but against all odds quite tasty indeed. Visually it is splendid. Scenario is not half bad. Lot of attention was given to details of costumes, weapons and vehicles. There is a lot of nice chasing, tracking and tricking in this film. All actors did a great job too - I was particularly impressed by Stephane Audran, who is amazing in this film, even if her screen time is very short. By the way, the girl on the cover of the DVD, unlike what is written there,  is not Stephane Audran - it is Judith, played by Caroline Langrishe...

I must however warn you here, that Harvey Keitel appears for only a limited amount of time. In 1979 he still played second roles, but of course he became a major star since and therefore when this DVD was released well, they put him on the cover next to Martin Sheen for commercial reasons. In fact Sam Waterston and young Caroline Langrishe should be on the cover...

It is also fair to warn you that there is NO subtitles of any kind and that includes the moments when people speak Spanish (a lot) or Indian langauges (not so much) - so parts of conversations are quite cryptic...

Another fair warning - there is no heroes in this film, as Pike and White Bull are both really kind of @holes. The only people I could really relate to were Judith (in the second part of the film) and the horse...

All those points notwithstanding I really like this atypical but quite charming film. It is not a masterpiece, but a very honest watch. ENJOY!",1410307200,3,3272,4.622413793103449

5091618,4,B007JLSFEQ,"EAGLE'S WING is a nearly forgotten western featuring three top actors. With long stretches of no dialogue, a viewer is free to enjoy the often stark, always beautiful Mexican scenery behind its simple story, one that can be summed up in a handful of sentences:

A lone Kiowa brave (Waterston in an effective non-speaking role) waylays a small funeral procession traveling across a desolate area. He kidnaps a preacher's flaxen-haired sister while the man cowers against a wagon. Two fur trappers (Sheen and Keitel) lose their pelts and pack animals to maurauding Indians and one of them is killed. The survivor encounters an eerie native funeral ceremony that includes a magnificent white horse. He steals the animal; the Kiowa later takes it from him. The balance of the story has a man who didn't own it in the first place trying to steal the horse back, even forsaking the newly-freed woman to do so.

It's an impressive little film.

8518382,3,B007JLSFEQ,"Released in 1979, ""Eagle's Wing"" is an English Western about a white trapper (Martin Sheen) circa 1830 who steals a white mustang named Eagle's Wing from a laconic Kiowa Indian (Sam Waterston). The Native then pursues him to get his horse back. Harvey Keitel, Stphane Audran and Caroline Langrishe are also on hand.

This is a unique, professionally-made Western. The tone is thoroughly realistic, Waterston is impressive as the Native, the women are good-looking and the Mexican locations are magnificent, albeit thoroughly desolate. Unfortunately, the story isn't very absorbing. But the film's interesting in some ways and certainly worthy of your Western collection.

The movie runs 111 minutes and was shot in Mexico.

From the looks of it, it seems to be about Texas or New Mexico territories tribes, probably Comanche and Kiowa, or even the Plains Apache (also called Kiowa-Apache).

Sam Waterston as White Bull is exceptional. Martin Sheen as Pike is a great contribution as well.

The cast also has in tow many superb actors from all phases of cinema.

8518388,4,B007JLSFEQ,"I had seen this movie when shown on a network station on rare occasions.  I enjoyed seeing several future and now current best actors in one of their early and much less known roles.  I found the story line interesting, the scenery was great, and Martin Sheen's role was very well done for a young actor; an indication of much better roles to come.  I really enjoyed the Sheen character's compassion for and interaction with his lone transportation, i.e., the lowly mule, and I especially enjoyed Sheen's interaction with the great while stallion and appreciated the value of such an animal during that period in America's history.

8518390,2,B007JLSFEQ,"(This review is for ""Eagle's Wing"" on dvd):

Seeing the all-5-stars reviews, I expected to receive a ""unique"", ""beautifully photographed"", ""impressive"", ""excellent"" movie, in which ""all actors did a great job"" / ""actors fit the plot"" and where Martin Sheen ""stars"".
Man - was I disappointed.

This is my point of view:
I do agree that this is a different story than most of the 'westerns' standards, and in that respect maybe unique. But apart from that, I do not find any unique with this movie. Or impressive. Or excellent. I do register that Billy Williams won the award for best Cinematography from the British Society of Cinematographers for this film, but that do not impress me much (and frankly, it's hard to believe):

Several of the scenes does - to me - looks almost amateurish when it comes to the light settings from the photographer. E.g the scene at the indian's holy place (graveyard?), where it's hard not to be annoyed over the hard, flat, artificial Bonanza-studio-outdoor-scene light. Likewise, there are several logical faults when it comes to scenes with the sky beyond the actors; the sky would shift from cloudy grey to light cloudy/blue sky during the same 5 seconds of a conversation (e.g. where the two mexican communicates with the two indians). This of course due to different takes, edited together. This is not only almost amateurish, it IS amateurish. In addition to this, there are also other edits that I found pretty odd.

One reviewer claims that 'Eagle's Wing' is ""...one of the most beautiful westerns ever filmed"". Well, in short - I have to disagree. it's not even close to the top of my list.

When it comes to movies, the essential part for a good film will be whether the actors are trustworthy (I do not know if this is the correct word in the english language) or not for their role(s). To me, several of the actors are not convincing in their role:

Sam Waterston as an indian? Nope, does not work for me, although the powder black wig was cute. Almost made me laugh. Martin Sheen as a fur trader? Nope. Despite he's supposed to be a prior city boy, Mr Sheen looks like a Hollywood all-white-teeth-actor misplaced in this setting, and I think he overplays from time to time. Not impressed. The mexicans? Hardly one of them. Seems like they have been collected from the local pub. The women in the stagecoach are ok, but the winners here are Harvey Keitel, the horses and the sadly abandoned mule.

I do like 'slow burning' movies (e.g. the beautiful 'Winterhawk' (1975) and 'Jermiah Johnson' from 1972 to mention two in the western catergory), when the slow action is being used e.g. as a tool to underline a situation, or to call attention to characters. But to see people climbs on and off horses does not do the trick for me this time. This movie lacks both nerve and contents, the former partly due to not-so-good acting / misplaced actors that do not manage to lift this movie. Not at all. To me, this western appears to be a cheap B-movie, just as overrated as 'Tombstone' (1993). Altough that is quite another western and another story...

Subtitles: nei / nej / njet / nein / no
Quality transfer: Good, but not up today's standards.",1420243200,3,3186,4.676785714285714
