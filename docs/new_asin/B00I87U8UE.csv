6253526,1,B00I87U8UE,"Missing Episode Shows Contempt for Fans & Consumers

Many folks will say that at least only one episode is missing from this season (as opposed to 16 from seasons 2 & 3), so I'll buy it anyway.  The release of these season with missing episodes is just an example of a company wanting to exploit all the fans of this great show.  TGG Direct doesn't care about this show or its fans.

I'm personally not going to buy any more of these haphazard releases from a greedy incompetent company that doesn't care one bit about the purpose for buying a TV show on DVD, TO HAVE THE WHOLE SEASON WHEN YOU BUY IT!  If you want to complain, you can visit the TGG Direct web site here: [...]

I'm also complaining strongly to MGM by contacting them through these two links (direct comments to Roma Khanna President, Television Group and Digital, or Gary Barber, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer):
[...]
[...]
Tell MGM and TGG Direct that the fans of In The Heat Of The Night are tired of being ripped off!  This will start happening with your other favorite shows if folks don't start pushing back against this now!",1394841600,6,1105,4.495

6253546,5,B00I87U8UE,"I so enjoyed this series, especially the 6th & 7th seasons.  The only complaint I have is that the parts of the box that hold the DVDs in place were broken so the DVDs are just loose in the case.  I do wish that all the episodes from this season were included with the DVDs.",1442620800,2,274,3.963636363636364

VERY DISAPPOINTING AND FRUSTRATING.  THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE COMPANY THAT MADE THE DVD SETS AND NOT THE SELLER WHO MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW OF THE DECEPTION.  I WAS ABLE TO TAPE ALL THE MISSING EPISODES BUT ONE ON GRIT... WHICH OUR LOCAL STATION HAS NOW DROPPED... BUT MAYBE THEY ARE BEING SHOWN ON CABLE OR SOMETHING...

6253552,4,B00I87U8UE,"This was one of my favorite shows to watch while I was in High School.  My grandma and I would watch religiously and tried to never miss an episode. So when I saw a few re-runs on a local channel I just had to buy a some DVD's to watch whenever I wanted.  If you like the show then it is a good set!  quality of the picture isn't the best and it wouldn't play on my Blu Ray..  But I am thoroughly enjoying stepping back in time to not only watch the series, but to feel my grandma's presence again.",1438214400,2,498,3.900990099009901

6253554,1,B00I87U8UE,"Wow, I should have listened to the reviews on this item, smh. Not one single DVD plays. I am just flabbergasted and completely disgusted that I purchased Season 6 in good faith, got home ready to watch my favorite classic episodes of In the Heat of the Night (so I thought) and the entire DVD set won't load or play in my DVD player. I understand people are fans of the show, like I am but PLEASE take heed to my experience. It's obvious, someone is mass producing these DVD's without checking or caring to find out if they actually work or not.
DO NOT PURCHASE!",1436486400,,562,4.311320754716981

6253592,5,B00I87U8UE,"in the heat of the night was one of the better tv shows of the 90s. As im a big fan of this show i was glad to see the entire series was available and now i have added this show to my library. I highly recommend this show. The movie with rod steiger and sydney poitier is great, watch the movie before the series as it will help to understand the show better",1412553600,,358,3.8513513513513513
6253593,5,B00I87U8UE,In my opinion in the heat of the night is one of the best police shows of the last 80 and early 90s. The cast enhanced the shows quality of a small southern town. The story lines were also well written so the whole family could enjoy them. Sadly this is not the case with some television programs today.,1411516800,,303,4.1525423728813555

6253612,3,B00I87U8UE,"On 4/8/14 I ordered season 2&3 ,which I am very displeased with ,so much so that I stopped watching it!  The first thing that happened was on Disc 2 , I was able to watch two episodes, it skipped and locked up on me in all three players. Then to make it worse on Disc 4 episode titled MISSING is a continued story . The set contains season 2 Volume 1 and season 3 Volume 2 if I would known this ,I would not have purchased it. Can one buy season 2 Volume 2 and season 3 Volume1 ?????",1402531200,,483,3.878787878787879
6253613,4,B00I87U8UE,If I still had my tv hooked to satellite or cable I would not have bought these but I cleared myself of that bill and buy dvds to watch when I want. I was disappointed in the face I bought all the seasons of this series to find out some episodes are not on these dvds. I believe it has to to do with some of the actors on few shows would not sign off to be shown but that is my opinion I could be wrong. But the shows it has are still good ones but I miss a few like about Sweets grandfather where the bluesman sings a song about it. And a episode with Willie Gault  in it. Maybe later they come out with a special disc that has all the lost episodes I hope.,1401062400,,658,3.7681159420289854

6253633,5,B00I87U8UE,This was one of my favorite shows when it was on TV. For years I waited for them to release the seasons on DVD. Season 6 is one of my favorite seasons of the show. These DVDs have great picture quality and the original theme song. I was a little concern about buying it at first because some other tv series I have bought on DVD in the past years was not of good quality and did not contain the original theme song. This is a good quality set of DVDs.,1397347200,5,451,3.967032967032967

6253636,4,B00I87U8UE,This Season has only one episode missing and that is episode 6.  I really enjoy this series but wish I wouldn't have purchased all eight Seasons at once.  There is a total of 28 episodes missing from the 8 Seasons.,1396051200,,214,4.325
