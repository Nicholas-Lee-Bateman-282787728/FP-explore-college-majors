The VHS I received was in English and the dubbing was quite good.  The reason I sought out a VHS copy is because I was extremely disapointed with the DVD when it was finally released.  As a matter of fact, the DVD is a bloated piece of junk that shows that directors don't always make the best editors.  I am going to look for a VHS in French, with subtitles, because at this point, there will probably never be a DVD of the original edition.
The movie, as originally shown, is a great story, well made.",1289865600,,628,4.1652892561983474

7803320,5,6300146324,"I saw this movie, for the first time, a few weeks ago. It is an old French film - from 1974. The director, a great French director: Claude Lelouch (A Man and a Woman). The name of the American Video Tape is ""And now, my love"". In French the name is ""Toute une vie"" - it means ""A whole life"".
It is very long (141 minutes) but it is a film of special beauty. I am sure that I need watching it several times to understand it properly. It starts at the beginning of the 1900, just before the First World War, as a black and white silent film. It continues through more than half a century and the cinematographic technique develops with the years (according with cinema history). The film ends in 1974 (the time it was filmed). It is focused in France.
While going over the past century until 1974, the film touches the most terrible things that happened. Wars. Jewish extermination attempt. War survivors fight for survival. Emptiness of Western post war generation, a generation born with a gold tea spoon in its mouth. A very bored generation. With free sex and no love. But at the end this generation is shown as capable of love and finding itself. It is an optimistic and fantastic film. ...",1010880000,7,1193,4.427272727272728
