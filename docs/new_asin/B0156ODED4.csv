8732814,5,B0156ODED4,"We showed it to our Friday night dinner group and they loved it.  Additionally, my good friend, Johnny Crawford (of The Rifleman fame), really loved it.  He is a huge silent movie and William S. Hart fan.  He has just completed a scene from Wayne Shipley's upcoming movie ""Bill Tighman and the Outlaws"" where Johnny portrays William S. Hart, and he really does resemble him.  The movie is due to complete next summer.",1509235200,,417,4.671232876712328
