8109014,5,B000EGAYMY,"This series was just what I wanted it to be exciting, intersting story line, and most of all great acting. I decided to purchase this series because I had seen other films that Roy Dupuis (Ross Desbiens) has acted in and I was sure that I would not be disappointed. I was right! The series was very enjoyable. I am a big fan of Roy Dupuis. Michael Ironside (Bob Durelle) was great and evil at the same time. You will enjoy him. I liked seeing Don Francks (La FemmeNikita - Walter) play his guest shot. He was the the total boss, because no one ever sees him come out to anything. But Bob was so important that  he had to come out. This series is worth a look see. Enjoy!",1353456000,,670,4.153846153846154
