3682565,5,B001L9ABDU,"Most critics use excuses to refute what is said on this DVD and what Mr. Barton says in general. But there are two things to think about, one if you know of Mr. Barton he has the worlds largest private collection of documents from the founders era and two he has read mostly all the founding fathers papers and books. So you are arguing with the facts that he presents? Any how this DVD is great, Mr. Barton goes threw the from 1609 to modern day America and shows you all the significants of how important the bible was to the previous generations. The bible had such an impacted the previous generations so much that it shaped there view of government and life that it should do the same to us here today. If you wants to know truth about this wonderfully blessed country and if you homeschool I highly suggest buying this DVD! Just one piece of advice take notes it is pack with much useful information.",1390867200,2,906,4.398809523809524
3682566,5,B001L9ABDU,"After reading so much revised history, it is refreshing to read history the way it really unfolded, from a ""You are there"" perspective, and with the help of a talking, magical horse.  Presented in a way that grandchildren to grandparents can enjoy.  Brings history alive and makes it interesting.",1386720000,3,296,5.020408163265306
3682567,2,B001L9ABDU,It is so bad that I don't know where to start.  I could not finish watching it. Very superficial.  It is also a ploy to buy more products from the producer's company.,1386633600,,166,4.15625
3682568,5,B001L9ABDU,I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He loves the history of our America. Amazing to see God's role in our great nation.,1361750400,2,126,4.08
3682569,5,B001L9ABDU,I have wanted to view Mr. Barton's DVDs for a long time. I feel much more patriotic now and really appreciate all the sacrifices our fathers gave. It is sad that our school system has strayed so far from the foundational truths.,1361145600,3,228,4.4523809523809526
3682570,5,B001L9ABDU,"A nicely put together product, timely, compact, easy to comprehend.  Uplifting, positive.  I am a Christian and found no fault with this item, I do find this to be refreshingly natural, really leaving the final answers to me and giving the reader all of the tools to make a reasonable choice.

3682571,5,B001L9ABDU,Thank you David Barton for this wonderful DVD and sharing the recorded historical facts about our early history. The influence of the Bible on the United States is undeniable.,1302998400,7,175,5.068965517241379
3682572,5,B001L9ABDU,"Having repeatedly watched David Barton's DVD ""The Influence of the Bible in America,"" I have to say it is a well researched presentation of the subject it advertizes to explore: The-Influence-of-the-Bible-in-America.  Critics claim that Barton ""combed the founding fathers to get their most Christian sayings and compiled them"" without regard to the whole context of their life's writings.  The founding fathers have been shown by the mass of their writings to be remarkably consistent with their worldviews, not self-contradictory as the critics would have us believe.

Barton uses quotations pertaining to the influence the Scriptures had on many of the key figures in our history (and no doubt could have quoted much more, and made a DVD set!) His contention of their sincerely held Christian beliefs are well documented from their own pens, as any objective and unbiased historian would attest.  Was the Bible the ONLY influence these men had?  Obviously not, but it was not Barton's purpose in this DVD to present other influences.  It is also obvious that the Bible was a major factor in their thinking, and the nation they had such a Providential Helping Hand in founding... the One they all repeatedly gave glory and credit to.",1283644800,29,1235,5.119402985074627
3682573,5,B001L9ABDU,"Well since Ken can give a one star review without reading the book or watching the DVD. Seems logical that I can give it a five star and too not actually write why. But unlike Ken, I have read the book and watched the DVD.",1278028800,11,222,3.9555555555555557
3682574,1,B001L9ABDU,"I think this recent review of Barton's work should be examined by anyone who thinks they are teaching themselves or their children the truth about American history.

""Well the worst is this fellow from Texas named David Barton, who has written a book about original intent in which he has gone through and falsely combed the founding fathers to get their most Christian sayings and compiled them in this book, out of context to the exclusion of their broader way of seeing the world, and saying, see - they were all Christians and ... Jefferson was a Christian, and Madison was a Christian, and Franklin was a Christian, and do you know what?  He is just plain wrong and a fraud.""

This from a recent podcast of Clay Jenkinson, one of the first winners of the nation's highest award in the humanities, the Charles Frankel Prize.  See wikipedia or other sources for information about Jenkinson.  There one can also find ample review of Barton's work from numerous, other exceptional historians, including Richard V. Pierard, Stephen Phillips Professor of History at Gordon College - who describes Barton's work as follows:
""Moreover, American history is rewritten to become ""Christian history,"" the story of a people chosen by God and who honored him in the past. David Barton and a host of other evangelicals have produced books and videos setting forth a ""holy history"" of America--an idyllic past to which we must return if the nation is to be saved from destruction at the hands of secularists.""",1247702400,10,1498,4.881889763779528

8317668,5,B001L9ABDU,"On time delivery and just a good good explanation of the Influence of the King James Bible and the Geneva Bible in our Culture , Our Government , Law and our Education . If you haven't seen this then please get a copy. Many people don't like David Bartons "" Jefferson Lies "" book because they say Jefferson "" did "" father a child. I wanna go on record here and say that no one is perfect and no author is perfect and if we get on the band wagon and say no one has anything good then we are falling into intellectual idolotry.
