7978873,1,B0000844M9,"Quitting.... hmmm doesent seem to ring a bell but now that you mention it.... Ah yes the movie about some crappy chinese actor who smokes herion and listened to one beatles album for a year.... Uhhhh exact reason why he listens to one album for a whole year is beyond me and what the heck was his point of doing heroin anyways i mean he was an actor so why was he depressed. I watched about a minute of it an hated it, so yeah this dvd is crap and will never be good",1243641600,,466,3.9680851063829787
7978874,4,B0000844M9,"In director Zhang Yang's film ""Quitting,"" four years in the life of Jia Hongsheng, a professional actor, become both a play and a stage.  Jia Hongsheng, his parents, friends, and even the doctors and the patients play themselves as they recreate, in some cases, their involvement in Hongsheng's fall into heroin addiction and, in other cases, their struggles to help him overcome his drug habit.

At the beginning of the movie, when Hongsheng agrees to the director's proposal to re-enact his drug addiction years on stage, he does so because he wants to understand his life.  By the end of the movie, however, I thought that the goal had not been quite accomplished.  The device of interspersing thorough the film scenes where the camera moves away from the action until it reveals that the characters are on a stage left me with an impression of distance, as if they were saying, ""I'm here telling you my story, but I don't want you to get too close to it.""  The story wants to draw the viewers into the picture, yet it also leaves them outside of the frame.  I did not find the intimacy and insight that I expected from a true story told by those who lived through it.

However, I could not help but empathize with Hongsheng's battle for his sanity and against his inner demons. Also, I was touched by his parents' determination and sacrifices.  His parents did all they could to save him. They loved him; pleased him, scolded him, rationalized with him, yelled at him, and pleaded with him until the day they realized their son needed professional help.

By the end of ""Quitting,"" I might have not understood why Hongsheng felt he was a phony or why he kept visiting the same park over and over again, but the movie told his story in an interesting way, one that calls to mind Shakespeare's words:  All the world's a stage; and all the men and women merely players...

Perhaps, what this movie is trying to say is that life may be like a play where we are just acting our roles until the day we have the courage to face and accept our true fallible selves.",1224374400,,2060,4.54054054054054
7978875,5,B0000844M9,"After reading earlier reviews, just want to clarify one thing.  While most of the roles in the movie were played by the actual people, Hongsheng's sister is an exception.

Hongsheng's sister is actually performed by Tong Wang (Biandan, guniang), a professional actress.  Hongsheng's real-life sister was the one who first found out Hongsheng's drug problem.  She didn't inform their parents at first in a hope that Hongsheng would quit by himself soon.  It was the pain that had hurt her so much that she did not want to recall any of those days.  She didn't agree to act in the film.  As a matter of fact, she still refuses to watch the movie.

Other movies starring Hongsheng Jia and available on DVD at Amazon include Suzhou River and Frozen.",1157673600,2,745,4.72093023255814
7978876,4,B0000844M9,"Maybe I'm reading into this too much, but I wonder how much of a hand Jia Hongsheng had in developing the film. I mean, when a story is told casting the main character as himself, I would think he would be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc. and that would make it a little biased in his favor.

But, his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about Hongsheng's life. I think the best view would have been told from Hongsheng's family and friends' perspectives. They saw his transformation and weren't so messed up on drugs that they remember everything.

As for Hongsheng being full of himself, the consistencies of the Jesus Christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, he's obviously still alive as he was cast as himself) for his family's happiness. Huh? Exactly.

The viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex. He lies on the grass coming down from (during?) a high by himself and with his father, he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms, his head cocked to one side.

It's fabulous that he's off of drugs now, but he's no hero. He went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle.

This same device is used in Ted Demme's ""Blow"" where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero.

However, ""Quitting"" (""Zuotian"") is a film that is recommended, mostly for its haunting soundtrack, superb acting, and landscapes. But, the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of Jia Hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play. It makes the viewer feel as if Hongsheng's life was merely a play told in many straining and difficult parts.",1109116800,4,1906,4.591176470588235
7978877,3,B0000844M9,"This is a good movie (not a great movie). My main complaint is that it feels like typical Chinese propaganda that all their problems (like drug addition) is the fault of Western influences. I felt the movie repeatedly implicated the western rock and roll influence with causing the drug addition of the main character. On the other hand, another Chinese offer him drugs the first time. So my accusation is debatable -- but I definitely felt it. There was probably something lost in the translation, too. For example, the chorsu line from ""Let it be"" by the Beatles was translated to ""Be natural."" This slightly off translation made following the subtitles a little more difficult than subtitles in French or Spanish movies....
I don't see how the Beatles (""peace, love, and understanding"") can be blamed. Do you?",1065398400,,812,4.934306569343065
7978878,5,B0000844M9,"A Chinese friend convinced me to watch this interesting film, as he was a recovering addict like the character in ""Quitting.""  (I understand the title in Chinese translates into ""Yesterday,"" which, upon finishing watching the film, I thought was a much better, more befitting title than ""Quitting."")
As other reviews have pointed out, this is based on a true story and played out by the real people who had expererienced the events.  I was certainly surprised to learn that even the patients at the mental hospital were real patients, because they did a fine acting job.  In any case, Hongsheng's father and mother did a decent job, although in a few scenes their acting is rather stage-like.  Hongsheng's sister is one hot Asian girl!  I understand she, like her brother and parents, is also an actor; too bad she does not get much screen time at all.
Of course, the focus is on Hongsheng himself, a young actor who got addicted to illicit drugs.  The story is about his recovery.  The first half is a bit bland as Hongsheng's parents arrive in Beijing to live with him, care for him and lecture on him.  The second half, when he strikes his father (oops, spoiler!) which finally turns him around, is excellently scripted and filmed.  It's touching yet not pretentious.
The most interesting aspect is probably the father-son relationship depicted in the film, which is totally unlike any I've seen in Asian films.  You have to watch this to feel for Hongsheng's parents during the darkest days.
Finally, the dialog is in Chinese but the English caption is better than most.  Lately I've developed a taste for indie films, and I rate this highly and recommend to anyone who's interested in this subject.",1059091200,,1703,4.7979452054794525
7978879,5,B0000844M9,"When actor Jia Hongsheng's parents found out that he was suffering from drug addiction, they retired early from their own acting careers and moved to Beijing to give him all their support and love. So begins this amazing film about a real life actor's struggle with heroin, the scorn he felt for the world around him, and the valiant efforts his family made to save him.
What makes this film even more compelling is the fact that everyone (parents, friends, and mental hospital patients included) plays themselves. It is apparent that some of these scenes (particularly the ones revealing Jia's rudeness and cruelty to his father) were painful for the cast to re-enact. Their courage in telling this story is what makes ""Quitting"" exceptional. The scene in which Jia's father painstakingly attempts to buy Jia a Beatles cassette tape, while never quite understanding the name of the band (and knowing that there will never be a word of thanks for his trouble), alone shows the incredible amount of love these parents had for their son.
Despite his family's loyalty and support, it becomes evident that the only one that can heal Jia is himself. The journey is one he takes alone, while in a mental hospital.
I recommend that everyone see this film.",1058832000,4,1248,4.863849765258216
7978880,4,B0000844M9,"Quitting (Zuotian) is a film about Hongshen and his addiction to drugs.  Hongshen, a former actor, lives in an apartment complex which he seldom leaves.  The family finds out about his drug addiction and decides to move to where he lives and try to help him.  However, this seems to tear the family apart and there seems to be no way out other than to institutionalize Hongshen for his drug addiction.  Quitting is a narrative of Hongshen's life that grabs the audience with a serious undertone, but occasionally is playful through the characters that Hongshen meets through his habit.  The film is an interesting contemporary Chinese film that entertains while offering a lot of food for the mind.",1058400000,,698,4.88135593220339
