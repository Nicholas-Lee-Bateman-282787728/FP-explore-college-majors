8062909,5,B0009KQOZG,"Just watched the film. There is a kernel of a good story here about a young girl growing up, but the cinematography, the editing, and the crappy plaintive piano playing throughout most of the film pretty much sucks the life out of this otherwise interesting story. The other thing that sucks the life out of this film is that many of the scenes are way too long (alot of them show Melinda walking -- that's it, just walking) and are accompanied by the aforementioned crappy piano playing. Zac Efron (who is too too cute and adorable with his delicious but somewhat goofy gap-toothed smile) is a highlight for me. But he's not in too many scenes. The scene in which he kisses the young girl is photographed so badly you can hardly tell it's him. There's another scene where he kind of tries on his sister's bra that is very well done and show's a young boy's curiosity about the other sex. All in all, if you are a Zac fan, the movie is well worth seeing. Just fast forward through the way too long crappy parts.",1343088000,2,1011,4.411764705882353
