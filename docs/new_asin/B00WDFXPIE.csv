8712897,5,B00WDFXPIE,"Third installment of the excellent documentary series Romantic Warriors, which gives an overview of legendary and less well known progressive rock bands. This was at one time (early seventies) a very popular genre, that after the punk explosion turned into one of the most maligned musical expressions ever. Only to return with renewed public interest with new bands like Tool and Porcupine Tree.
This documentary highlights the Canterbury music scene that has Caravan and Soft Machine as the main exponents during the late sixties and seventies. Besides English bands, also included are French, American and other acts that were influenced by the Canterbury scene.
I'm quite impressed that the makers included the not very well known Dutch band Supersister. This band evolved from Canterbury style albums to a more jazz rock based record (Listen to ""Iskander"") to a very experimental idiosyncratic last vinyl record. I understand that this DVD is soon to be followed by a DVD that shows more extended performances by some of these bands.",1447545600,4,1038,5.221556886227545
