I contact the seller, he approved a reimbursement, good service and fast.",1430697600,,313,4.322033898305085

8186960,1,B000OVLMIO,"I fell for this too.  Big error by production company Laguna Films.  This is not the right movie that is on the cover of the DVD Box.  Production company wanted to put this movie out right away to make money and did not even bother to check if they put outb the right one.  On the DVD box they have the titled film which was released in 1971; however, the DVD itself is another movie from 1953 titled ""Padre Nuestro"" featuring Eva ""Chachita"" Munoz.  What a big goof off confusing the two movies.  I recommend caution when buying DVDs from Laguna Films...Shows you the side of companies just caring to make the fast buck.....Despite this, the movie on the DVD is actually good movie from 1953, but buyers are expecting to see the one featured on the box.",1227398400,4,753,4.420289855072464
