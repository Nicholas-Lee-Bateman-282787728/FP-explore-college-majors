8367726,3,B002EIJ99Y,"""Poison Rock Power"" DVD is a documentary with Poison interviews and music videos.
This DVD is a re-release of ""Poison - Nothin But a Good Time Unathorized"" (2003) also known as ""Poison - Rock Legends"" (the import version) which was already re-released in 2006 as ""Poison - Stand on the Road"" and now yet again the same DVD is re-released with a new cover and title ""Poison Rock Power"". Not sure why they keep re-releasing this DVD because there are only 2 interviews which are not even that good ? Maybe it's because this DVD is a third party release and is not coming from the band and whoever is releasing it, is doing so because it's their only claim to fame. Still gave it 3 stars, only because it's POISON.",1276300800,2,711,4.435114503816794
