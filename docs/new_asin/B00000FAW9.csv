7907891,5,B00000FAW9,"Anyone who is interested in the U.S. Airforce Academy - candidates, parents or military interested individuals will love this video. The film gives you a tour of the Academy, a breakdown of the history of its founding  and former members, and what the new cadets ""doolies"" go through.  Buy the video, you will like what you will see. I bought it for my son and  myself to find out more about the Academy, because my son plans to attend  in 2004 and wants to be an Air Force Officer. Go Air Force!!",940204800,11,497,4.369565217391305
