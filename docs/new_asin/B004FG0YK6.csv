8427792,3,B004FG0YK6,"Her information is good and important, but the video presentation leaves something to be desired.  Felt like I paid too much for what I got out of the video, and I wish I didn't feel that way because alignment is so important to our well-being.  I also wish that the Rxercises worked more like a typical exercise video, so that I'd want to put in the disc and it would lead me through fifteen minutes of therapeutic exercise, with close-ups and from different angles.  But it's not, and I'll probably never care enough to watch it again.  Her book, Move Your DNA, is much more interesting, gives much more in-depth explanations and resources, and I'll turn to it more than once.",1453161600,4,678,4.578512396694215
8427793,5,B004FG0YK6,"I am so impressed with Katy Bowman, MS in her When You Hurt All Over DVD which is #102 in her Aligned and Well Series. I find her innovative and appropriate for all levels of conditioning. She clearly explains herself in a very understandable way and I believe this DVD will deliver results to everyone. I felt an increase in energy by Day #2 of implementing these movements on Aligned and Well - When You Hurt All Over. I streamed mine from Amazon and there was a bit of a audio/video syncing issue but it did not distract me from the excellent Material on Aligned & Well 102 - When You Hurt All Over which I will cover this 35-min DVD from beginning (0:00) to end.

0:00 - intro to author and series
Katy Bowman, MS describes herself as a BioMechanical Scientist based upon her education in physics, physiology, anatomy, and engineering and describes this DVD series as an Owner's Manual (for the human body). ""Because most of us have similar habits of excessive sitting and have received the same cultural guidelines on how to move, we seem to share the same ailments: degenerated spines, osteoarthritic hips and knees, low bone density, and tension in neck, jaw and eyes. Although we associate these conditions with aging, they are not found in all humans but in those of use who belong to a culture where we sit the bulk of the day, live in almost constant stress, and those of us who have replaced all-day movement with intense bouts of exercise. There is a community of people who are realizing better health through better mechanics which simply means they are learning movements the human body requires in order to stay living disease and injury free.""

2:08 - intro to specific DVD topic - When You Hurt All Over
""The key to using exercise to reduce pain is picking movements that help remove waste and damaged materials out of the tissues and can bring down the swelling. Fitness activities are not the answer for chronic pain but rather gentle stretching and small movements that ease the body and target tight spots that may have gone unnoticed for a very long time. These exercises focus on the larger muscles of the body.""

All exercises seem to be to work your way up to 60 seconds three time per day.

3:13 First When You Hurt All Over Exercise: Calf Stretch using Half Dome or Towel
""Did you know your calf muscle runs behind your knee? If it is tight, then it can impact the way the knee joint is functioning, and not in a positive way!""
Katy states this exercise is the cornerstone to her series. If you can just do one exercise, this is it.

6:38 Second When You Hurt All Over Exercise: Thoracic Stretch ""This is a great, easy-to-do exercise to start to open the chest and shoulder muscles. Great for better breathing and gentle stretching of the upper spine."" Holding onto back of chair, walk feet back until all your weight is in heels and you can lift your toes, then continue to back up your body without moving your feet; as you slide back your shoulder girdle and upper torso lowers towards floor. Let neck relax. Let hands open. Take a couple of deep breaths letting ribcage open. Add a second level by going back to starting position but this time place your right hand on top of left hand with feet in same position back hips up and this right directional stretch completely changes the stretch. Come up leaving feet in same position, place left hand on top of right, move hips back and let ears drop down to in between arms. Slowly lift up and out. This stretch benefits any thoracic area part of your body including respiratory, cardiovascular, shoulders, elbows, hands...

11:02 Third When You Hurt All Over Exercise: Double Calf Stretch using chair and half dome or folded/rolled towel
""Are you ready to check the tension in the calves, hamstrings, and hips... all at the same time? Once you do this exercise a few times, your body's circulation will be significantly improved!""
This exercise restores function feet, knees, hips, and low back. It is a really great way to test your spinal mobility and see how much movement you have in your hip joints. Start with your body right in front of your chair. You want to make sure your feet are about pelvis width apart and that the outside of your feet are pointing straight ahead. Bend forward letting your palms rest on the chair seat letting your back become concave (not staying convex). Lift your tailbone up to the ceiling to get a good stretch on back of legs. Keep weight back over heels so that you could lift toes. Continue letting spine drop, tailbone lift, and relax/drop back of neck. After 60 seconds, make this exercise more challenging by placing half-dome under balls of feet with heels firmly on the ground. Repeat. You can tell from this exercise that the tension in the back of your legs really does effect your spine. Although this exercise is called the Double Calf Stretch, it really effects the health of the spine, your pelvic floor, your hip joints, your knees, and even the muscles inside your feet.

15:05 Fourth When You Hurt All Over Exercise: Hand Stretching
""These are simple exercises you can do right in your chair!"" Make sure your hands haven't gotten tight without your noticing.
1) Place back of hands together lightly weaving fingers with thumbs touching with shoulders back, slowly drop hands to altitude of elbows
2) with elbows bent pointing back and fingertips on floor, push palms away while pulling elbows back. This exercise is not about getting palms flat on floor but about pulling elbows back. Make sure thumbs are 180 pointed away from each other.
3) With elbows bent and palms facing up and fingers pointed away, pull back each individual finger except thumb
4) make a hitchhiker thumb and then grab with other hand and use like a joystick in all different planes of movement
5) with elbows and palms pointing down and fingers pointing away, pull pinkie down to forearm, then stretch ring finger and middle finger. index finger tends to be very tight. Keep fingers and hands pointed out
6) Lace fingers together with palms facing away from you, push knuckles away from you forming a bowl or parabola

20:49 Fifth When You Hurt All Over Exercise - Head Hang ""And finally, relax the muscles in the back of the neck with this simple head hang""
Often we try to correct any curvature in our back by lifting up our heads thereby compressing the tissues on the back of the neck. So the area between your shoulders and head is much smaller than it should be. This is a very basic head hanging exercise that restores the length between the skull and the nape of the neck. So start by stacking your body up with your shoulders over your hips and your hips are over your ankles. While keeping your body upright and shoulders relaxed, allow your chin to drop towards the chest.

23:50 work up to taking a daily walk in order to drain and oxygenate. Shorter walks done throughout the day are more beneficial than one long one. Walk for 5 minutes 3 times a day throughout your house.

24:08 Your Body: The Human Machine: Human Physics 101
The type of movement you do with your body directly impacts how your machine (your body) works. In a healthy body, you have three substances constantly flowing in your body: 1) electricity (communication between your brain and body), 2) blood (your nutrition - what your body cells eat), and 3) lymph (gutter system of your body removing any cellular waste you may have).
""What do your nervous tissue, cardiovascular and immune systems have in common? They all require regular all-over muscle usage in order to stay healthy. If you haven't been moving ALL your muscles, then you are probably having a problem with pain, injury, disease, maybe even accelerated aging

Healthy Muscles are the Key to Your Health
""The more blood flow you have to an area, the more nutrition is received to that area and the more waste that is removed from that area. If waste accumulates in an area, that area tends to swell and becomes more sensitive to pressure. Being sensitive to pressure means that moving the body or even pushing on the skin can hurt and all because you aren't using the muscles in that area.""
Healthy Muscles are the Key to Your Health
1. Using a muscle means your nerves are communicating well with your brain
2. Muscle with electrical flow holds more blood and reduces the work your heart has to do
3. Regularly used muscle cleans itself out more often which means less waste in that area .
Muscle has to be at the correct length in order to get the most electricity which is why it is important that your bones be in a very particular position.

You have about 650 Muscles in your body... How many muscles are YOU using?

Reverse the pattern of degeneration

Hold all body parts in alignment when you move
and
move more often throughout the day

Who taught you to move? Posture and gait pattern is learned, not inherited, and determines degeneration.

In order to be healthy, you have to figure out what you are doing that could be making your health worse and start using muscles that you have neglected for years.

The Aligned and Well Program will Show You
1.) where your body is right now
2.) where your body should be
3.) The movements you need to do to get back on track
""Attaining health is simple, you just need flow but you can't get electricity and blood coming in and waste going out until you put all of the muscles and bones into the correct position so they can work optimally.""

Re-learning How to Move
""Remember you have been moving one way for years. Give yourself plenty of time to learn your new skills. The more conscious you are throughout the day the easier it will be to identify tasks you do or habits you have that reduce your body's function. Pay careful attention to the introductions and closings of each title; they will give you additional information about how to point your feet straight ahead and not one out to the side, how to stand and save your knees, how to sit at the computer or the dinner table for better all-over function. You will notice changes in your body right away. But be patient with yourself. You are now heading in the right direction. Good luck and be well.""",1356739200,12,10174,4.602316602316602
