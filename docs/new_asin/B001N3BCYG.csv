8323004,3,B001N3BCYG,"Explains how to play a chord and the music, but to much time on simple chords over and over!!! Overall he does a good job teaching technique and the music pieces.
Should do something with his fingernails not very pleasant to look at during his demonstration.",1372464000,,258,4.630434782608695

I became interested in bossa nova after we played some bossa style tunes in my guitar class, so I was looking for some instruction. I thought this DVD was very good and the instructor (Aaron Gilmartin) does a nice job of presenting the material in a very easy fashion. You learn the basic fingerpicking patterns and syncopation techniques for establishing the bossa nova beat, which can be transferred to almost any type of song.  That being said, I do not think that this DVD is for an absolute beginner.  You need to have at least some experience playing guitar because although the instructor clearly explains all of the chord shapes, these shapes are well beyond your basic chords and will pose difficulty for a beginner.  However, if you really want to learn this style, there is nothing wrong with challenging yourself.  I would say that this DVD is for an intermediate level player or above.  Caution: You really should have a nylon string guitar for this DVD because this style is not really for a steel string, though it isn't impossible(The DVD even makes this recommendation on the box and in the ad for it on Homespun). For this reason, it may pose a problem if you don't own a nylon string guitar.  Check out this DVD and you'll be playing ""The Girl From Ipanema"" and other bossa tunes like it in no time!",1334275200,2,1459,4.584615384615384
8323006,5,B001N3BCYG,"My music library contains more than a few instructional dvd's & VHS tapes.  Like, I'm talking 75 - 100 for guitar, drum, etc.  I also check them out of our local librarys for review to know if I want to add to mine.  So, I've seen many.  I put this particular one in the top 5 of all I've ever seen. It is very well produced and Aaron in a first class instructor.  He takes it slow and gives great detail, covering every nuance of how to become AND SOUND professional. Such as:
~ muting techniques for either hand when changing chords
~ chord substitutions & deciding when to use them
~ HOW to practice in order to get the rhythm right

He just covers a lot of ground that many instructors have skipped right over in demonstrating technique.  Result: the student learns it right and learns it better.  In short, he just covers the little things better and sells the student on WHY something is done as well as HOW.  He gives the formula and the subroutines that enable the student to see, hear, and feel the progress and know he's on track.

Structurally, the dvd is organized well, making it easy to find and navigate those portions that need more work.  The quality of the setting, the camera shots, the dialogue - and he's very easy and interesting to listen to.

I recommend that other instructional videos producers, directors, & teachers take note.  Here's your model.  And his music is great to listen to, also.  It is very nice to feel yourself moving closer to that level of playing.",1301616000,16,1492,4.453874538745388
