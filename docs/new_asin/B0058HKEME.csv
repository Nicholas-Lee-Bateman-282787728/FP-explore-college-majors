8461536,3,B0058HKEME,"I guess I was expecting more of a documentary; although there are some nice moments displaying performances and conversation, it's mostly traveling shots with his music in the background.",1491868800,,187,5.482758620689655
8461537,5,B0058HKEME,Obviously a talented and hardworking man. Grateful for this view into his traveling life.,1409616000,,89,5.428571428571429
8461538,5,B0058HKEME,"I never thought that Kozelek would be brave enough to actually release a DVD of his various performances along with backstage antics and other stuff ... This thing is PACKED with all kinds of different things you wouldn't expect from someone as ""reclusive"" as Kozelek, but what a wonderful visual experience!!!

Highly recommended ...",1388534400,,334,5.185185185185185
8461539,3,B0058HKEME,"I would have really enjoyed more of an interview format, because Mark Kozelek is a very interesting person and is often inaccessible in terms of video interviews.  This film is mostly third party concert footage shot from backstage angles, and long, meditative b-roll of European landscapes set to his (beautiful) music.  It's very nice to hear and look at, but it's not the rewarding documentary I hoped it would be.",1374019200,2,417,4.942857142857143
8461540,5,B0058HKEME,The receiver was excited to have.  He was hoping to receive kozelek on tour for Christmas from his gift list.  Always good to get someone something they really want.,1358726400,,165,4.655172413793103
8461541,5,B0058HKEME,"Had no idea what to expect from a singer/songwriter who travels both in the US and abroad often without notice and with precious little promotion.  What could his fans hope to see?  This is fertile new ground for the Scorseses and Demmes of the world profiling Neil Young and others of his stature but we're talking several levels of fame lower on both sides of the ball here, for both documentarian and performer.

What we got was the best possible documentary of a singer's travels on the road I've ever seen, interspersed with so many compelling performances as well as many accompanying studio songs.  With this story, this genius of a man, this most beautiful soul, has given us so much of his life to love for the rest of our days.

Having seen him last year and getting to see him again in Philly tomorrow night, I am beyond excited to welcome this man to my life yet again.

Did I also mention that my overweight self somehow made the final video cut, having been filmed while waiting in line with my friend Chris and my kids to meet him after the 2011 Philly concert?  Was watching the DVD intently with my son and my friend last night when my son blurts out, ""Dad, that was you"".  Yes, for better (I'm memorialized as part of Mark K's production) or worse (couldn't have looked chubbier), there I was.

That aside, I am just thrilled to death that Mark K. is part of this world.",1348704000,3,1388,4.433070866141732
8461542,5,B0058HKEME,"This is an exquisite film. It is beautifully shot and edited in a simple, straight-forward style. It is full of music from start to finish and each version of each song is so beautiful. If you are a fan of Mark Kozelek then you will enjoy seeing this intimate glimpse into his touring life.",1315872000,3,290,4.388888888888889
8461543,5,B0058HKEME,Just to let you know this is a great dvd---it is well put together---for any fan of MK you should definetly own this---mostly the last 2 SKM albums-- songs are shown in black and white videos and concerts---some old school songs also---its about 2 hours long and it has high replay values--mostly this gives a glimpse of a gifted tortured--but honest and real songwriter who gives the viewer a look inside--definetly 5 stars!,1314576000,10,425,4.835616438356165
8461544,5,B0058HKEME,"A must for any Mark Kozelek/Red House Painters/Sun Kil Moon fan.  Using beautifully shot black and white footage, it is a perfect accompaniment to his music.  A good variety of songs covering his career, it is nice to see him  during his travels and some of the incredible venues he plays.  It is mesmerizing, haunting, and everything I hoped for from a tour DVD focusing on him and his talents.",1313625600,8,395,4.6
