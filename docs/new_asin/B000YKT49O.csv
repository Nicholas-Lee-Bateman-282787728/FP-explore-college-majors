Highly recomment for people who is looking for leg and ab exercise without 100 squats or 100 sit ups. Love it i will purchase more dvd from same maker",1510099200,,287,3.9655172413793105
8233445,5,B000YKT49O,"Although it has been acknowledged in other reviews that this DVD is not a dance DVD, which I thought it was, I still am really happy that I bought it.  There are two 30 minute workouts, one for abs and one for legs.  But actually you do kind of work out both parts in either workout.  There is some arm movement, but I just added dumbbells and that increased the exercise for my arms.  What I really like about these workouts are 1) Lisa Wheeler's personality is delightful, 2) each exercise starts out with a simple movement that is still effective, but she keeps building onto it to increase intensity.  If you are a beginner, you can just stick with the original movement. I am a mid to high level intermediate exerciser, and I got a really good workout from this DVD.  If you buy it used it's just $4 with shipping, and well worth it.",1485216000,,838,4.339743589743589

8233447,5,B000YKT49O,"I've only done the Ab work out and boy does it really work your abs, and give the rest of your body (lower back, legs, upper back, arms) a complete work out! Definitely check it out.",1370649600,,182,4.083333333333333
8233448,5,B000YKT49O,"The first part of the workout is a standing leg toning series, then the second part is a lying leg series. Love the moves and Lisa is a great instructor for sure!",1341187200,,162,4.09375
8233449,5,B000YKT49O,I found this dvd by accident after trying the cardio ones.  I am so happy I found it.  This is my new go-to lower body muscle group video.  You get right to working out and it is obvious that these moves are what really make serious dancer legs.  I am glad to have something short yet effective for this area that I can rotate with other videos for different goals.  I can't recommend enough...a hidden gem.  BTW...I have almost every workout video under the sun so TRY IT!!,1277769600,3,474,4.329545454545454
8233450,5,B000YKT49O,"My apologies to all who've bought this DVD hoping it would be a cardio workout. The information appearing on this page describing the content of this DVD is wrong. This DVD is a strength and tone workout for legs and abs. It is not a cardio dance DVD. Obviously, and quite frustrating to me as the producer of this program,Amazon.com has either been given the wrong information, or has placed the wrong cover on this page, or has erroneously placed the information for DanceFit Salsa Sizzler DVD on this DVD. That DVD also stars Lisa Wheeler and is a cardio-dance workout combining various latin dance moves and styles with standard aerobic fitness moves. None of our DanceFit(r) cardio DVD's (Salsa Sizzler and Latin Retro) have been structured for non-dance beginners.",1239926400,8,770,4.930769230769231
8233451,2,B000YKT49O,"I was under the impression that I would be dancing to work my abs and legs, but I was wrong. This is like any other workout dvd-except the fact that this one only works your abs and legs. And the ""abs"" workout works mostly your legs instead of your abs. Don't waste your money-it's not what you think",1234483200,4,300,4.189655172413793
8233452,3,B000YKT49O,"The editorial review states: ""In DanceFit Cardio: Salsa Sizzler
Dance/fitness expert Lisa Wheeler gets you in the groove with a series of heart-pounding segments featuring the most popular Latin dances the Salsa, the Cha-Cha, the Samba, the Merengue and the Rumba. Each 10-minute workout segment is combined with traditional fat-burning cardio moves to help melt away inches and give you the toned
and sculpted look of a dancer.

DVD Includes:
Warm-Up
The Salsa
The Cha-Cha
The Merengue
The Samba
Rumba Cool-Down
BonusSalsa Lesson
Stick around after the workout
for a bonus Salsa lesson with Cal.""

This is not the case.  There is no dance, whatsoever, on this DVD.

It is simply two segments, one for abs and one for legs, of standing and floor exercises.

If that is what you want to do, it is good.  But, if like me, you want dance and aerobic exercise, this is not the one to buy!

Obviously, I should have paid more attention to the title than to the description.",1205884800,10,968,4.7604790419161676
