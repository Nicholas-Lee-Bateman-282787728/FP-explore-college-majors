8633974,5,B00HNYHZ0O,Bought the three dvd series to use with my Total Trainer by Bayou.  This third dvd in the series is awesome.  You really get a great workout and Durkin is inspiring.  The results have been noticeable.  Glad I bought it.  It is like having a five star trainer ready whenever you want to work out.,1428883200,3,295,4.290909090909091
