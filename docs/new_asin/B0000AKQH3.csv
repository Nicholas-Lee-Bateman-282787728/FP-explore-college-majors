7997531,5,B0000AKQH3,"This is a fine recital containing major and contrasting works by Liszt. All are played with considerable skill and musical insight.

The recital starts with the more reflective side of the composer with sensitive versions of the 'Benediction de Dieu' and 'Pensees des morts' - both from 'Harmonies poetiques et religieuses'. These two pieces are essentially reflective but both, being by Liszt, have moments of bravura and rise to considerable climaxes with attendant technical challenges. These are dealt with seriously by Francois Guy who has all the necessary musical and digital techniques to meet these various challenges.

The recital concludes with an impressive performance of the Piano Sonata, a work famed for its demands on the performer over an extended duration. Once again, this pianist is fully on top of all the demands and brings a relatively serious mind to bear on the kaleidoscope of changing moods throughout the 30 minutes or so of the composition. These changing moods can lead performances to lose their focus in less capable hands but that is not a problem in this case and the viewer's/listener's attention is engaged throughout. For a more extroverted but equally satisfying approach to this sonata I would recommend the astonishing recital by Yundi Li recorded in 2004 at Baden-Baden by DGG. Nevertheless this performance by Guy brings his absorbing recital to a satisfying conclusion - a Listzian feast!

The recording was made in specially constructed recording facilities for La Roque d'Antheron piano festivals and boasts superb imaging and remarkably realistic piano sound presented in DD 5.1, DTS 5.1 and stereo.

The disc should give all Listzians much satisfaction and in my opinion is well-worth the full 5 stars.

Further note on this remarkable series of recordings:

The series of concerts recorded at the specially built recording venue features state of the art recording facilities producing wonderful piano sound and sympathetic remotely controlled camera work. The intention was to record outstanding recitals each year and to release them on DVD. In reality this project seems to have stalled with only a handful of issues released in 2002 and 2004. But what riches they contain! This is as good a place to start as any. Once you have one you will want them all. There are 13 and the titles are spread around but not usually under the artists, the music or the venue. At the moment the most effective search on Amazon has been to choose the category  `Film & TV' then search  'naive dvd'  within it. You will then find most of the series is listed. A wonderful collection of great artistic and recorded merit.

Outstanding recitalists in the series, featuring several previously unknown to me, include Boris Berezovsky, Frank Braley, Eliso Virsaladze, Francesco Libetta, Frederic Guy, Nicolai Luganski, Paul Lewis, Vanessa Wagner, Zoltan Kocsis and the Ivaldi / Pennetier duo",1343520000,2,2921,5.156448202959831
