2319405,5,B0009UC7MK,"Looking at the episodes in season three, I was astounded at how many of my all-time TAGS favorites are from this season (Convicts-at-Large, Man in a Hurry, The Mayberry Band, The Cow Thief, Aunt Bee's Medicine Man, Barney's First Car, A Wife for Andy, and Barney and the Governor).  Man in a Hurry is consistently voted as the best TAGS episode by fans.  This season also introduced audiences to: Helen Crump, Mayor Roy Stoner, the Darlings, Ernest T. Bass, Malcolm Merrieweather, and the Fun Girls.  Here's all you get:

Opie's Rival: Opie is jealous of his father's courtship with a local nurse.

Andy and Opie-Bachelors:  While Aunt Bee is away, Andy and Opie are looked after by Andy's girlfriend.

Mr. McBeevee:  Andy is convinced that Opie's new friend is only imaginary.  I never cared for this episode but it is usually ranked highly with TAGS fans.  It shows Andy's faith in his son in that he believed him without the proof of seeing the man who lives in the trees and wears a shiny hat.

Andy's Rich Girlfriend:  Barney gets Andy thinking that his rich girlfriend is out of his league.

Barney Mends a Broken Heart:  After Andy has a fight with Peggy, Barney arranges a date for Andy and himself with the 'fun girls' from Mt. Pilot.

Andy and the New Mayor:  Andy is being closely watched by Mayberry's new mayor Roy Stoner.

The Cow Thief: The mayor doesn't have faith in Andy and Barney to catch a cattle rustler.  One of my favorite episodes.  One of my favorite lines is when Andy teases Barney about the plaster casts: ""I like to put a little eggwhite in mine.""

Floyd, the Gay Deceiver: Floyd poses as a wealthy man to impress his pen pal.

The Mayberry Band:  The mayor does not approve of the town marching band playing at the state capitol because they are so bad.  Andy recruits Freddy Fleet and His Band With a Beat.  One of my favorites.  The Mayberry Band trying to rehearse ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" is one of the funniest moments in T.V. history!

Lawman Barney:  Two farmers who are illegally selling vegetables in town show little respect for Barney or the law.

Convicts-at-Large: One of the best TAGS episodes of all time!  Barney and Floyd are held hostage by three escaped female convicts.  Has the best Floyd line: ""Maude, Al, if those hamburgers are ruined, I won't be responsible.""

The Bed Jacket: Aunt Bee has her heart set on Andy buying her a bed jacket for her birthday.  Andy thinks his aunt would appreciate something more practical.

Barney and the Governor: Another favorite of mine. Barney tickets the governor's car and is afraid he will lose his job.  Otis spikes the spring water and its soon ""Happy New Year"" for Barney and the Mayor.  Great lines:  ""put that in his smike and poke it,"" ""bless his heart.""

Man in a Hurry:  Consistently ranked number 1 by TAGS fans.  Mayberry is seen through the eyes of a frustrated businessman whose car breaks down on a Sunday.

The Bank Job: Barney shows the local bank is far from burglar-proof.

One-Punch Opie: Opie's friends are influenced by a tough new kid..

High Noon in Mayberry: Andy is visited by a man he put behind bars.  Barney is sure the man is out for revenge.

The Loaded Goat: A local goat has eaten some dynamite.

Class Reunion: At Barney and Andy's class reunion, Andy looks for his old girlfriend.

Rafe Hollister Sings: Farmer Rafe Hollister has the best voice to represent Mayberry in a singing contest but the mayor and his wife think he's too shabby for public display.

Opie and the Spoiled Kid: Opie is taught how to get a bigger allowance but finds out temper tantrums and breath-holding has no effect on Andy.

The Great Filling Station Robbery: Andy plays detective when Wally's garage is robbed.

Andy Discovers America: Andy criticizes Helen Crump's history teaching requirements.

Aunt Bee's Medicine Man: A traveling medicine man comes to Mayberry.  Soon Aunt Bee is ""feelin' no pain' and singing ""China Town.""  One of the funniest episodes.

The Darlings Are Coming: First appearance of the Dillards. A betrothed mountain girl develops a crush on Andy.

Andy's English Valet: Englishman Malcolm Merrieweather works off a fine at Andy's house.

Barney's First Car: Barney buys a lemon from a sweet little old lady.  Another favorite of mine.

The Rivals: Thelma Lou makes Barney jealous when she trues to help Opie get over a crush who is not interested in him.

A Wife for Andy: Barney plays matchmaker for Andy but disapproves of Helen Crump because she cannot cook ""Andy's favorite dish.""

Dogs, Dogs, Dogs: Dogs accumulate at the courthouse just when an inspector is supposed to arrive.

Mountain Wedding: Ernest T. Bass makes his intentions known to Charlene Darling.

The Big House: Barney's prisoners escape from ""the rock.""",1121644800,154,4756,4.747858017135863
2319406,5,B0009UC7MK,"I can honestly say that I've seen every episode of the Andy Griffith Show (black & white only) at LEAST 100 times apiece (color episodes maybe...25 to 50 each), and in my opinion, season's 3, 4, and 5 are clearly the cream of a very fine crop.  Season 3 is when Don Knotts really got the feel for Bernard P. File, and it shows in such classic episodes as 'The Great Filling Station Robbery', 'The Bank Job', 'Barney's First Car' and 'High Noon In Mayberry'.  Also, we were introduced to such classic Mayberry-ites as Gomer, Helen, Ernest T, and Briscoe and the Darling clan.  I'm glad paramount decided to 'speed up' the release of these classic years.  Can't wait for season's 4, 5 and the rest.

Just remember...as fans of TAGS, 'WE DEFY THE MAFIA!!!'",1120003200,14,753,4.548148148148148

This show is my favorite TV show of all time, and I haven't seen an episode yet where I didn't laugh out loud!  People say Barney makes the show, but I think Andy is quite hilarious as well.  All in all, anyone who buys Andy Griffith is getting GREAT value for their money!  Go for it--you won't be disappointed.",1119484800,36,420,4.148148148148148
2319408,5,B0009UC7MK,"This is a definate must have Season of all time! Barney gets his goat is funny, a goat eats a bunch of dynomite and Barney is afraid they might go blooey! Andy and the English butler is one of my favorites, High Noon for Andy - Barney is afraid Andy is about to meet his end so he gathers a few men like himself to keep his friend safe. Barney also buys his first car from a con artist, Barney & Floyd are held hostage by 3 women covicts, I enjoyed watching Rafe hollister sing, he has a very good voice and he shows the mayor not to judge someone by their appearance! Andy meets Helen Crump his true love, he meets Gomer Pyle & The Darlings, & many more! Here is an episode guide... JM!

2319432,5,B0009UC7MK,"I assume that this being the third season, that you now know what you have bought. Now you are ready for episodes 64 through 95. I also assume that you did not get your fix with just the first two seasons.

For those people who are buying the third season (1962-63), before viewing the first, the Andy Griffith Show is unique in a sense that it started out fun and had all the standard encounters and stories that most TV programs had but it never deteriorate or got so left field as to lose its appeal. Every show is entertaining and usually carries a message.

A lot of other programs spun off form the characters that played in this series. And you always think that Opie Taylor (Ronny Howard) is always young. Everyone knows that they issued Deputy Barney fife ""1960-1965"" (Don Knotts) one bullet that has seen a lot of action in his pocket. Too many people to name here.

This series will bring back old memories or can also create some now ones.",1506643200,,951,4.422857142857143

2319774,5,B0009UC7MK,"As one who grew up watching Andy Griffith, I thoroughly enjoy watching the first five season again ... and again.  It just never seems to get old.  I never really cared for the series after Don Knotts.  The magic in the show seemed to be a chemistry between Andy Griffith and Don Knotts that is quite rare.  Watching these episodes brings much laughter - it is no wonder that Don Knotts won several Emmys during his time on the series.  But the episodes also bring several tender moments.

There are many life lessons taught through these episodes, including the ever present theme of ""believe in others.""  In a world of TV today that seeks to tear down, destroy, ridicule and rule over others, a show where the main character spends time defending and protecting his bumbling sidekick, sometimes laying his own reputation on the line, is amazing.  And when Andy saved Barney's bacon and solved the problem, Andy would almost always give the credit publicly to Barney.  Not sure you'd see that in too many sitcoms today.  You can watch this show and feel good when its done.

The lessons for raising children should not go unnoticed. In one episode Andy gets upset with Opie who gets very mad at others because Opie did not win a race and is a ""sore loser.""  Andy teaches Opie that it's not about losing, but how you react that is more important.  Contrast that to what we teach kids today - everyone is a winner, everyone gets a trophy - there are no winners.  In today's world of finding someone else to take the blame or helping others find a way not to take responsibility, this series stands in stark contrast.  It teaches us to own our mistakes and failings while understanding it's not the end of the world and moving forward with the support of others.

It's amazing how much my young grand daughter enjoys watching Andy Griffith.  She enjoys the sophisticated kids shows of today, but she will ask if she can watch Andy Griffith, and then sit entranced by the show.

The quality of these DVDs is great, especially considering the technology that was used to originally record them.",1479600000,4,2090,4.617886178861789

The lead characters in the series work so well together.  Andy and his son Opie bring real warmth to their family portrayal.  Oh, to have a son like Opie, who admires his father and wants to be a good son.  Sure he has his faults, but he displays guilt when he does something wrong, and you know he is going to make it up to his father.  Gomer is so goofy, but a loyal friend without question.  Aunt Bee is a solid member of the Taylor household, caring for the needs of, not only Andy and Opie, but those who are lucky enough to be fed a meal she prepares.

Then there is Barney.  He so struggles to excel and always falls short, unless by accident he is successful.  But even when he fails, Andy is there to give him support and build his confidence back.",1465257600,,862,4.2073170731707314

People took time out of their lives to help one another in time of need.  Crime was minimal.  Unlike today's law officers, Andy could handle criminals without the use of force.  He didn't carry a gun because there was rarely a need for one.  The few criminals who came through Mayberry were unlike the vicious one's of today.  Life was simpler back then.  People were laid back and relaxed.  If only there were places like Mayberry, NC today, America would be a much more wonderful place to live.",1454284800,,623,4.54954954954955

2321270,5,B0009UC7MK,"This is probably the best of the eight Andy Griffith seasons.  It certainly has a few more gems (than the others) and it's easy to understand how, after watching these shows (when they were first broadcast), people loved ""The Andy Griffith Show"" for the rest of their lives.  (note: The Andy Griffith Show was one of the few TV shows that were ranked number 1 (in the Nielsen ratings) when it ended its run).

My favorite episodes here, in season #3, are ... Mr. McBeevee (wonderful), The Cow Thief (excellent), The Bed Jacket (Andy Griffith at his acting best), Man In A Hurry (fun fun fun), High Noon In Mayberry (excellent), The Loaded Goat (maybe the best AG episode), Rafe Hollister Sings (wonderful), Andy Discovers America (Andy Griffith at his showman best), and The Rivals (excellent).

There is quite a lot of high quality acting in The Andy Griffith Show ... sort-of unusual for a sitcom ... but Andy Griffith is head and shoulders above them all.  His efforts single-handedly raise the quality of most of the shows to a high (big budget movie) level.  He is one of the best actors I have ever seen.  But the show benefited from numerous fine performers.  Don Knotts is very entertaining.  Ronny Howard was a very good child actor.  Frances Bavier is the perfect Aunt Bee.  It was a part she was born to play. Jim Nabors was a fine addition as Gomer Pyle, though I think when they gave him too many scenes it ruined the episode.  Hal Smith as Otis is just a great addition to the show, and he usually had the best lines. Jack Prince as Rafe Hollister was a gem to the show ... a talented actor and singer.  Howard McNear played Floyd the barber, and he was a great addition to the show ... just a great character.  Will Wright played Sam Weaver ... always a bad guy ... but a great addition to the few shows he appeared in (sad that he died so early). But The Andy Griffith Show had many strengths thanks to the outstanding talents of numerous performers.

However, the real strength of The Andy Griffith Show is the writing.  Week-in and week-out the show's writers cranked out good clean high-quality scripts ... with only a few ""clunkers"".  They routinely produced stories that are filled with interesting and fun story ideas ... and some great individual lines.  I read that Andy Griffith himself played a large role in the shaping of the show's scripts ... contributing a lot to their content and character ... but never allowing his name to be used in the credits as one of the show's writers.

Andy Griffith was a great entertainer.  We were very fortunate to have him ... and when he was at the peak of his entertaining powers he had The Andy Griffith Show to pour all that energy and ingenuity into.  It's the best TV show that ever was, and this, the 3rd season, has more bright moments that any of the other 7 seasons.",1448582400,3,2840,4.5078125

2321656,3,B0009UC7MK,I have always enjoyed the laid back humor of Andy Griffith but as this series progressed it became more the Don Knotts show.  His brand of humor begins to grate on the brain in a very short time and I reach for the 'off' switch.  He carries the boastful idiotsy to the extreme and borders on overacting.  I like the Matlock series more.,1408060800,,336,4.301587301587301

Well, instead you actually get to watch a show about characters in a small southern town who care about one another and doing the right thing.  When you finish watching an episode you feel better about yourself and the world around you.  There aren't many shows on today that make you feel that way.  Even though some of the situations may seem hokey or old fashioned in our times, the central themes and dilemmas faced are still viable today.

I wanted my daughter to watch it because she was having trouble with her little girl throwing temper tantrums.  In this particular episode Opie's friend shows him how to throw temper tantrums in order to get his own way.  I love Andy's response to Opie's attempts to get his own way.

Really like Floyd the Barber when he appears in an episode.  The is small-town USA at its finest.

Andy is always protecting Barney from himself.  Barney is always trying to be something he is not.  Andy values Barney more than the mistakes he makes and cleans up Barney's mistakes leaving Barney to think he did it on his own, which only inflates Barney's ego, but Andy finds that amusing... how many of us could handle not getting the credit!

As for the series,for my money,this may be the best season out of the whole series. There are quite a few all-time favorite episodes of the series from this season alone. We are introduced in this season to characters such as Gomer Pyle,Ernest T. Bass,The Darlings,and Andy's future wife (later in the series),Helen Crump. Personally,I liked Miss Peggy (played by Joanna Moore in four episoses) better as Andy's girlfriend. She had the look and accent of a southern belle.

The writers did a fantastic job that year.  The acting ensemble delivered great performances consistently. Andy Griffith did not want the new mayor story line but Sheldon Leonard insisted on it.  I think Andy was right. Still the stories were really good.

Don Knotts was at his best only on TAGS. I don't care for the color shows just the black and white ones and I don't care for when Ken Berry is on the show and things are so much different then.

2322031,5,B0009UC7MK,"I was born and raised in Germany and still live there. But in 2007 I got the chance to go to the U.S. for four years to work there for my company.

One day I was zapping through the channels and suddenly I stopped because I thought I had just seen ""Matlock"" as a young man. There he was, Andy Griffith in black and white and sooooo young. I wondered because in Germany he is only known as Matlock, who is grey-haired and old already. The Andy Griffith Show has never been published (aired) in Germany or anywhere in Europe as far as I know. I did't know that Andy Griffith had a career before ""Matlock"".

I was done zapping and watched The Andy Griffith Show for a while and I really liked it. Soon I set up my VCR to record all episodes. I was simply hooked! Of couse I bought all my favorite 5 seasons over Amazon already, I really don' t like the colored ones and I miss Barney there, just isn't the same anymore. I wonder if Don Knotts ever regret to part from the show?

I find it amazing that I became such a huge fan, I mean I didn't grow up in the States, I don't know anything about the Sixties and the American lifestyle and mentality back then, but to me it is the most wonderful tv - series for the whole family, a treasure, just timeless! I would move right into Mayberry if I could!

My stay in the U.S. was in the South so I got used to the accent very well, however I cannot share my obsession for this tv - show with anyone of my friends or family here in Germany because the Southern accent is just too difficult to understand for them and there is no German language (synchronisation) available and never will be. I understand about 90 % of what they are saying and I wish there would be subtitles available since we don't have CC in Germany. At least then I would be able to read the words that I don't understand and then get the meaning or look them up.

So you guys here are the only ones who understand my passion!

Unfortunately, Andy Griffith died last week, so I guess only Ron Howard is left.

'''' R.i. P. Andy Griffith ''''

and thanks for hours and hours of your everlasting and never dying work that (now thanks to Paramount) will be in our living rooms as long as we live!

2322043,5,B0009UC7MK,"The third and fourth seasons of The Andy Griffith Show might be the best two in the whole series.  The combination of incredible scripts and characters makes for some of the most memorable TV shows ever to air, and out of the two, I think Season Three might be the overall winner.  This season is like a greatest hits collection, with some of the best episodes in the show's history.  It features classics like Mr. McBeevee, The Cow Thief, The Mayberry Band, The Loaded Goat, Class Reunion, and Barney's First Car.  In addition to those favorites, several great new characters, some legendary, are introduced in classic episodes.  New girlfriend Peggy begins her brief stay in Andy's Rich Girlfriend.  Mayor Roy Stoner (that's Stoner, S-T-O-N-...) takes office in Andy and the New Mayor.  After Andy has a spate with Peggy, Barney introduces Andy and the show's fans to the Fun Girls.  Gomer Pyle, one of the show's most-loved characters, debuts in Man in a Hurry.  Helen Crump makes her first appearance in Andy Discovers America.  The Darling family is introduced in The Darlings are Coming.  Mayberry meets Malcolm Merriweather in Andy's English Valet.  And finally, last but definitely not least, Ernest T. Bass makes his debut in Mountain Wedding, one of my personal all-time favorite episodes.  So, again, new characters for Season Three include Peggy, Mayor Stoner, the Fun Girls, Gomer Pyle, Helen Crump, the Darling family, Malcolm Merriweather, and Ernest T. Bass.  It's amazing that the show's writers created all of these characters in one season, and a pure delight to watch episode after episode of top-notch comedy.

Everything is in place - Andy is with Helen, Barney and Thelma Lou are together, Opie is pre-adolescent, and Gomer has not yet joined the Marines. It's all about double dates, pageants, first cars, out-of towners and the always reliable Aunt Bee.  This is Mayberry at its finest.",1267401600,2,380,4.8307692307692305
2322047,5,B0009UC7MK,"The Andy Griffith Show's third season continued their classic-worthy comedy.  ""Pushing the limits"" would be an exaggeration, but this season introduced an Irish giant, an exploding goat, and a high-noon type showdown with Andy and a ex-felon returning to Mayberry with a gun.  Of course, Andy and Barney continue to tag team criminal operations encroaching from the big cities.

Mr. McBeevee: Lucky Charms isn't enough to keep an Irish giant from his plans.  One wrong word, and he'll cut off Mayberry from the rest of the world!  Opie tries to befriend the leprechaun-giant but not without the doubts from his father.  After Opie brings a weapon into the home, Andy decides to hunt down the legend of the woods or someone is going to get a whippin'.

Andy's Rich Girlfriend: As pretty as Peggy is, her tastes in fine dining brings distaste to Andy's humble living.  Instead of being truthful, he hurts Peggy's feelings.

Andy and the New Mayor: An emergency election, votes from the dead, makes Roy Stoner the new mayor of Mayberry.  Running on a mandate to end corruption, he starts with Andy and Barney.  Unfortunately, he foolishly cuts the budget from the ""Bear Management"" program.

Andy and Opie - Bachelors: After Aunt Bee leaves town, Peggy volunteers to cook, clean, and look after the boys.  Preparing dishes Aunt Bee couldn't touch, cleaning the house, and most of all grace the home with her beauty makes Andy very uncomfortable.

The Cow Thief: No one respects poor, old Luke Jensen.  Why would they?  He shops for pots and pans on street corners, wears eye glasses with someone else's prescription, and his only friend is a feral dog.  But Luke will show them!  Meanwhile, Barney meets an infidel.

Barney Mends a Broken Heart: When Peggy and Andy quarrel, Barney sets Andy up with a new girl with herpes.  It goes downhill from there.

Lawman Barney: Barney Fife is demoralized when he learns vegetable peddlers aren't afraid of him.  It gets worse when the peddlers discover the truth behind the myth of ""Barney the Beast"".

The Mayberry Band: Mayor Stoner's dream of beautiful band music is never realized.

Floyd, the Gay Deceiver: When Floyd needs help pulling a scam on a wealthy woman, he first turns to law enforcement.

Opie's Rival: Opie unknowingly helps choose his next step-mother.

Convicts at Large: Barney and Floyd are kidnapped and given new identities.  They're rescued but too late to save Floyd from ""Stockholm Syndrome"".

The Bed Jacket: Aunt Bee's heart is broken when she gets a box of empty jars for her birthday.

I reccommend getting the season sets, but if you want sort of a ""greatest hits, get-your-feet-wet"" sort of thing, get these sets. This is also one of my favorite seasons. It has the introduction of several returning characters: Gomer Pyle (who later starred in his own show, Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C), a somewhat dumb, but loveable gas-station attendant, The Darling Family, which are your typical backwoods hicks, Malcolm Merriweather, the prim and proper English butler touring the U.S., and my all-time favorite character, Ernest T. Bass. Ernest T. is HILARIOUS, in my opinion, but he's like bleu cheese: ya love 'im or ya hate 'im. Contrary to other reviewers, I don't think this deserves to get 4 stars knocked off because three episodes are edited. That's just stupid. If you want to buy an ""Andy"" season, get this one first.

2322065,5,B0009UC7MK,"The first five season of The Andy Griffith Show are beyond classic. Those five seasons were the black & white seasons, they were also the seasons that co-starred Don Knotts as the incredibly neurotic deputy, Barney Fife.

Season three of the Andy Griffith Show continues in that classic vein & adding more beloved characters that the audience wanted more of. Season Three introduced Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors); nurse Peggy McMillan (Joanna Moore); the new Mayor, Roy Stoner (Parley Baer); Helen Crump (Aneta Corsaut); the Darling family, (Denver Pyle, Maggie Peterson & the Dillards); Malcolm Merriweather (Bernard Fox); & last, but not least, Ernest T. Bass (Howard Morris, who would go on to direct several episodes of the Andy Griffith Show).

All of these characters & the cast regulars in 32 great episodes. That's way too much to get into but I will highlight some outstanding episodes.

""Mr. McBeevee"" in which Opie seems to go on an imaginary friend jag. He meets Mr. McBeevee, a telephone lineman, who's description seems to be too far fetched.
""Andy's Rich Girlfriend"" in which Peggy, the county nurse, is introduced. She's so Southern & beautiful too.
""""Andy & the New Mayor"", the new mayor is introduced who is always at odds with Andy.
""Barney Mends a Broken Heart"", one of Peggy's old boyfriends shows up in Mayberry. Andy gets a black eye but he & Peggy do get back together.
""Lawman Barney"" has Barney unable to back down two vegetable peddlers. Andy, who has done this on more than one occasion, works in the background to assist Barney & boost his confidence.
""The Mayberry Band"" has Mayor Stoner nixing the town's band from going to Raleigh because of their inability to play. Roy Fleet's band shows up (minus the original Roy Fleet portrayer & minus James Best) & Andy substitutes them in the band to get Mayor Stoner's approval to take the trip.
""Floyd, the Gay Deceiver"". Floyd has been corresponding with a lady by mail but Floyd has been less than truthful about himself, he has bolstered his image by making himself bigger that who he really is.
""Opie's Rival"" in which Opie becomes jealous of Peggy & tries to sabotage the relationship.
""Convicts-at-Large"". Barney & Floyd run out of gas returning from a fishing trip. When they arrive at the nearest cabin they get taken by three escaped female convicts.
""High Noon in Mayberry"" Barney attempts to protect Andy when a letter arrives from a convict that Andy had shot in the leg during a bank robbery.
""The Loaded Goat"" in which a frisky goat eats dynamite & has Andy & Barney worried he will explode!
""Opie and the Spoiled Kid"". One of the most deceitful characters in the annals of the Andy Griffith Show, Arnold Winkler (Ronnie Dapo), is a spoiled brat who will do anything to get his way. He attempts to teach Opie his tricks but Andy won't be manipulated. The conclusion of this show is one of the most satisfying, ever.
""Andy Discovers America"" is the episode that introduces Helen Crump. Opie feels that the new teacher is giving them too much History homework. When Andy ""seems"" to agree the children revolt. Andy gets dressed down by the new teacher &, feeling sheepish, he gives the boys his own version of History that inspires them to learn.
""The Darlings Are Coming"" introduces that famous family. Charlene has a crush on Andy which keeps him backpedaling. Briscoe Darling keeps reminding Andy that Charlene is betrothed & should leave her alone.
""Andy's English Valet"" introduces the Englishman, Malcolm Merriweather, who's on a holiday in America. After he causes a car accident & is unable to pay for damages, Andy takes him on as his valet with disastrous consequences.
""Barney's First Car"" in which Barney uses his savings to buy a car that's a complete lemon.
""The Rivals"". Opie has his first crush but the girl is aloof & apparently uninterested. Crestfallen, Andy, Barney & Thelma Lou attempt to bolster his spirits. When Opie & Thelma Lou hit it off Barney gets angry because he can't get any quality time with her. Andy once again comes to the rescue with his wisdom & insight as he explains to Opie what it's like to date an adult woman. This was the type of scene that set the Andy Griffith Show so far above the other shows of any era.

2322068,5,B0009UC7MK,"Season 3 of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" is perhaps the best constructed season of a continually well put together series.  Additionally, Paramount did Andy, Barney, Aunt Bee, Opie, and the rest right by this very professional box set.

It seems like most of the time when one buys a DVD set the frills are gone; some do not even have a list of the programs included (except in the DVD itself).  This not only has a list of titles, but a description of each episode.  Furthermore, instead of easily broken compartments, the DVDs each rest in three individual cases (there are five DVDs for 32 episodes).

Season 3 has some of the most memorabilia ""Andy Griffith"" episodes, here is a brief rundown of eight favorites...

Mr. McBeevee-Opie tells tales of an extraordinary friend, but is he fact or fiction?

Man in a Hurry-This episodes features a man who is stunned by the slow-paced life of Mayberry; this installment has an almost-""Twilight Zone"" feel to it.

Class Reunion-Andy and Barney organize a High School Reunion and Andy reaffirms the decisions he's made.

Opie and the Spoiled Kid-Opie pushes Andy's parental limits after a spoiled kid preaches entitlement to him.

Andy Discovers America-Andy makes history lessons fun after Opie's teacher blames the man for his son's lack of interest in the subject

Aunt Bee's Medicine Man-A charming salesman cheers a depressed Bee, but how?

Barney's First Car-Barney is duped by a seemingly sweet-old-lady in this hilarious episode.

Check out the release from Brentwood Home Video.

In ""Barney Mends A Broken Heart"" the epilogue is definitely missing.  It's a very short scene AFTER Peggy and Andy hug and make up.

2322099,5,B0009UC7MK,"I'm so glad these DVD box sets exist, because they gave a twenty-something such as myself the opportunity to become acquainted with one of America's finest television programs...

The story is set in the fictitious little town of Mayberry, North Carolina during the early 1960s. Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) is a widower with a small son. He asks his Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) to move in with him and Opie (Ron Howard) as housekeeper and surrogate mother.

Many of the storylines center upon Opie's childhood dilemmas and coming-of-age situations. While Andy is quick to discipline his son, he is also understanding of the gray areas a child might encounter, and no matter the outcome of a situation, he strives to enforce in Opie the need for kindness and truth.

Other storylines focus upon Barney Fife (played by Don Knotts) as Andy's cousin and the town's deputy sheriff. Thanks to Barney's false pride and need to appear all-knowing, Andy spends much of his time trying to straighten out various situations that might otherwise have never occurred. Still, it's apparent that Barney has a good heart, and his sense of humor more than make up for the trouble he often stirs up.

Mayberry also includes a number of unique residents, such as Floyd, the kindhearted but vague barber; Otis, the town drunk who is trusted to let himself into his cell as needed; rock-throwing hlllbilly Ernest T. Bass; and Barney's ever-patient girlfriend, Thelma Lou. In this season, the childlike but good-hearted mechanic Gomer (played by Jim Nabors) is introduced...as well as Opie's teacher Helen Crump, who becomes Andy's girlfriend in the next season.

If you haven't ever seen an episode of ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" give this box set a try! You'll soon be searching for further seasons.",1164499200,,1793,4.983277591973244

2322105,5,B0009UC7MK,"Upon study of the TAGS ""complete"" season 3 I have found that only one episode is missing any footage, ""The Darlings Are Coming"".  It is missing the entire epilogue and all the footage as mentioned here in reviews previously.

I've read here and elsewhere about the episode ""Barney Mends A Broken Heart"" is missing the epilogue.  The epilogue is included on the Parnmount disc that I have for this episode. Peggy comes into the courthouse and discovers Andy's black eye, but does not ""doctor it"". She only shows concern for Andy's injury and they apologize and make up with each other. If you watch the episode you will see that it is there.  Perhaps some may confuse this epilogue with the epilogue from ""Opie and the Bully"", where Opie gets a black eye from fighting with another boy over his milk money. In this epilogue, Barney brings a steak into the courthouse for Andy to apply to Opie's eye, but he doesn't do so. He allows Opie to keep the black eye as a ""medal"" to show off for a week or two.  I also wonder if possibly there was a batch of DVDs produced without this epilogue because several reviewers have mentioned this.

As for the episode of ""Barney and the Governor"", the previous reveiwer that states there is missing dialogue/scene is absolutely incorrect.
The dialogue mentioned previously as missing is not supposed to be in this episode. The scene with this dialogue is found in ""Citizen's Arrest"". There is some dialogue in ""Barney and the Governor"" when Otis says something about his wedding anniversary and being a holiday. In ""Citizen's Arrest"", Otis says, ""It's my anniversary, it's been 27 years today since I took my first drink and I've been in love with it ever since.""  Again some may confuse the dialogue between these two episodes.

A previous reviewer also states that the episode ""Andy and Opie, Bachelors"" is missing some footage. This is incorrect. The episode is complete including the epilogue. The scene of Andy and Peggy singing on the porch is in this episode. They sing ""Down In The Valley"" not ""Cindy"" while Opie listens. The song ""Cindy"" is included in the epilogue of ""Opie's Rival"" sung by Peggy, Andy, and Opie at the lake after they've been fishing, not in the episode ""The Rivals"" as stated by a reviewer previously. ""Cindy is also performed by Andy and the Darlings in the epilogue to ""The Darlings Are Coming"" episode after Andy marries Charlene and Dud, which is missing from this DVD set as mentioned previously.
The epilogue for ""Andy and Opie, Bachelors"" takes place in Floyd's Barber Shop, with Andy, Floyd, and Peggy. Again I'm sure the scenes in these episodes are just being mixed up by the reviewers.

After reading all the reviews of missing footage and/or epilogues for TAGS season 3 here and on other websites, and then conducting my own investigation, I find that the only edited episode on the entire box set is ""The Darlings Are Coming"", which is, of course, a tragedy for all TAGS fans. But these discs are definitely still worth the money considering that only one episode is edited. I think true fans will still purchase this box set and I recommend them to do so.",1135900800,22,3133,4.702554744525547
2322106,5,B0009UC7MK,"I'm sorry that so many have found this 3rd installment of The Andy Griffith Show series from Paramount so disappointing.  I guess I can understand.  But, at the same time, it seems a bit harsh to say that the entire DVD set deserves only 1 star for a few deleted epilogues or scenes.

Course, I might feel differently if they had done that to my all-time, favorite episode ""Man in a Hurry"" - which is on this disc.  As was already mentioned earlier, the epilogues often get deleted from the current TV re-braodcasts.  For ""Man in a Hurry"", without the epilogue, the episode doesn't possess the endearing ""punch"" that the ending leaves us with.

Despite the outcry, I'm still of the opinion that it's a DVD still worth getting.  There are so many classics on this DVD that have already been mentioned.  I have also enjoyed the Mayberry-based commercial spots for Jello and Sanka.  They are quite cleverly put together and entertaining in their own right.

Number one is Don Knotts (Barney Fife), the greatest comic actor of all time. Number two is that this show managed to weave an undercurrent of love into every episode. This is no small feat, and for these reasons, Andy Griffith gets the nod. Nuff said, nip it in the bud with the credit card of your choice.",1129939200,5,671,4.419354838709677

2322120,5,B0009UC7MK,"There are countless DVD releases with a compilation of episodes from TAGS out there, some don't even have Earl Hagens' TAGS Theme! Paramount finally realized the market is there for the series in its entirety.  Having the shows in broadcast order, uncut is priceless.  And season three is where the characters really become developed.  Andy Griffith admitted from the start, he saw Don Knotts was the funny one. And he was smart enough, and classy enough to be the ""straight"" man to the scene stealing Barney Fife.  As a self-proclaimed Andy Griffith Show ""expert"", I will collect all seasons with Don Knotts.  In my opinion, after the show went to color, it lost its magic.

  But season three has many of the truly classic episodes, and introduces us to many beloved, unforgettable characters.  Beginning with the irrepressible Gomer Pyle, flawlessly portrayed by the neophyte actor, Jim Nabors. We also meet Earnest T. Bass, the rock chunkin' poet from the hills, the Darlins', and so many more. But we are also introduced to many ""one time"" characters that are integral to the reality, and lovability of Mayberry.  Friends like Malcom Tucker, ""The Man in a Hurry"", or Mr. McBeeVee, Opies' tree walking multi-handed friend. I guess the only negative I could say would be that we lost the comical Mayor Pike, who was replaced by the very unlikable Mayor Stoner, who never did show any redeemable, Mayberry like qualities. Even mean old Mr. Weaver showed he really did have a heart. And you couldn't help but like him, even feel sorry for him, like during the only Christmas episode TAGS ever filmed.  And it would've been nice if Paramount would've cleaned up the quality of the video just a little.  But it certainly isn't bad.

2322125,5,B0009UC7MK,"I know I'll catch a lot of flak for this, but I adore The Andy Griffith Show so much that I'd rather have these DVDs to play over and over again than to NOT have them -- slightly edited or wholly intact. Doesn't matter to me.

Don't get me wrong. In most instances I'm a purist of the highest order. I want my movies and CDs remastered and restored. I only want to see what was originally shown or heard.

However, when it comes to The Andy Griffith Show, I'm willing to forgive [...]Paramount who clipped a few scenes here and there. Why? Because these episodes are priceless. They deserve to be seen by the widest possible audience. For my money, there wasn't a better written or acted sitcom on television.

I, too, won't list every episode. It's already been done. What I will do is tell you that Season Three contains some of my all-time favorite episodes, including ""Floyd The Gay Deceiver,"" ""Man In a Hurry,"" ""Convicts At Large,"" ""Rafe Hollister Sings"" and ""Dogs, Dogs, Dogs."" The sheer brilliance of Howard McNear (Floyd) shines through in his episodes. I'm amazed by Howard McNear's Floyd the Barber. It's one of television's most memorable characters.

Well, ditto for Barney Fife. And Andy. And Otis. And...

Okay. The point is The Andy Griffith Show is a slice of Americana that I no longer wish to live without. This is the first time all of these episodes has been available in any format, let alone in pristine DVD quality. So I'm not going to quibble about a few lost scenes. Sure, I'd rather they were there. But what's the alternative?

Paramount, please don't slight your customers on future releases. Do a good job, one that you can be proud of. The rewards to you will be tremendous in the long run.

The Andy Griffith Show makes me laugh. In this day and age, when laughs are fewer and farther between, that's saying a lot.

There aren't enough stars to recommend Season Three of The Andy Griffith Show. If you want to know what the television's very best looks like, you'll buy this and enjoy it with everyone in your family.",1125619200,5,2048,4.561307901907357
2322126,5,B0009UC7MK,"Season Three is definitely the best so far in the series. The minor editing that is reported is actually quite sad but since there is nothing that can be done about it and there is no other way to buy these sets you just have to let it go I suppose. It is sad to see an episode run time of under 25 minutes and KNOW there is probably something missing; perhaps some snappy quips, lost plot points, or even a glance. Roughly 50% of the episode run times included here are over the almost mandatory 25 minutes leaving many at ""24-plus"" and of course there is the disastrous 22-plus minutes of ""The Darlings Are Coming;"" heartbreaking.

Looking beyond run times there is the realization that the Andy Griffith Show has officially arrived. Many favorites abound; from the gem ""Barney's First Car"" to probably the best season opener of the show, ""Mr. McBeevee"". It's almost eerie that not only are the characters fully formed now and the show is operating at near ultimate capacity BUT that the show will even get better than this (Goober, more Ernest T., Helen's steady influence)! But what is here is gold for the most part.

I really like ""Peg"" as the girlfriend. Even as the ""Rich Girlfriend"" she has a nice southern ease that makes you smile. I suppose she was discontinued because the ""nurse"" girlfriend, in all honesty, just didn't have the potential story elements of the ""teacher"" girlfriend (Helen) and in a way it is sad, because I like both. There are a couple of dodgy episodes like the proclaimed fan-favorite ""The Loaded Goat"" which to me seems more like a throw back to the sometimes gimmicky first season, but hey, that's ok. Also, I think I preferred the first Mayor to that of Stoner.

Again, edits aside, it is nice to see the epilogues of so many of these shows. It is almost an egregious act what the networks have done to this series in way of epil-lopping as I call it. There is a significant percentage in Season Three in which the epilogue resolves the STORY! I never knew Andy got his fishing pole (Eagle-Eye Annie!) back in the ""Bed Jacket!"" And what great fun it was to see Andy confronting Barney that INDEED there WAS a ""Mr. McBeevee!"" I never saw THIS on the network airing. How in the world can you lop off a summary? Doesn't it really make the entire episode moot?

I'm really looking forward to Season Four, now more than ever, and if there are edits that are needed hopefully a REASON will be included. ""Lost footage"" I can handle but the suspicion that little thought and care went into the DVD pressing definitely defies the spirit of the show and should be removed from the viewers mind -or- more importantly the PURCHASER.

Lastly, I would like to say that a very important part of the Andy Griffith Show, and almost always overlooked aspect is the soundtrack. Not just the Darling's and the featured songs in certain episodes but the actual ""score"". The score to TAGS remains one of the most memorable and creates a mood and vibe that no actor alone could achieve. Call it... Magic.",1125532800,6,3018,4.560885608856089

I'm assuming that some young person is in charge of this project at paramount who could care less if the episodes are complete as long as their 21st century technology looks good. Let's throw all of Buster Keaton and Fatty Arbuckle's pictures in the trash because their quality is not up to 21st century standards. These people should be fired from paramount before the next season of the Andy Griffith show is released and the third season should be re-released complete and unedited.

2322130,2,B0009UC7MK,"Having bought the first two sets and being a big Andy Griffith Show fan, I was really looking forward to this, the third season DVD set.  But Paramount has really let TAGS fans down with this release.  Several episodes have been edited and some scenes are inexcusably missing.  There is no explanation for this, and hardly any warning.  (In tiny tiny print on the back of the cardstock sleeve that houses the DVDs there is one brief note ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions."")  I don't see how Paramount can get away with calling this the ""complete"" third season, since it is quite evident to fans of the show that it is, in fact, incomplete.  Another gripe:  the disc space Paramount squandered on an endless succession of stupid previews of other releases would have more than accommodated the missing scenes from the show I paid to watch.

Picture and sound is generally good, considering the age of the original film.  However, there are times when the transfer editing appears sloppy -- for example, some DVD chapters seem to cut off prematurely.  All in all, there doesn't seem to be much dedication to quality control and customer satisfaction with this product on the part of Paramount.

Casual fans of the show may not find much to complain about, because it may not be immediately obvious to them that some things are missing.  On the other hand, my assumption is that ""casual"" fans don't buy the DVD sets; they simply watch the show as it is aired in reruns on cable TV.

It is unfortunate for fans of The Andy Griffith Show that Paramount has saddled them with only two options -- this flawed collection or none at all.",1124668800,51,1661,4.666666666666667

2322132,5,B0009UC7MK,".....And then, on your way home from Thelma Lou's, stop by Weaver's Department Store and pick up a copy of this ""Andy Griffith Show"" DVD set! Just do it! (Weaver's probably sells DVDs nowadays, wouldn't ya think?) :-)

Paramount's TV-On-DVD division has delivered yet another excellent full-season TV-show boxed set with the August 16, 2005, arrival of ""The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Third Season"". There are a few minutes of footage missing from a very few episodes, but I would not let that setback stop you from enjoying the greatness that is ""Andy Season #3"" -- because this is truly an outstanding season of programming in the history of this beloved TV series.

This handsome-looking 5-Disc DVD collection gathers together all 32 ""T.A.G.S."" episodes from the series' third (of eight) CBS-TV campaigns. Episodes 64 through 95 are here, which aired during the 1962-1963 television season.

Like the earlier Paramount ""Andy"" DVD seasonal releases, this third-season installment sports excellent video quality; and very good audio quality as well. For TV shows in this elderly age bracket, I don't see how these episodes could possibly look or sound any better. I couldn't be more pleased with these DVD transfers.

The third season of ""Andy"" introduces several new, recurring characters into the cast -- including ""Gomer Pyle"" (played by Jim Nabors) and two new girlfriends for Sheriff Andy Taylor -- ""Peggy McMillan"" (portrayed by the ultra-fetching Joanna Moore) and ""Helen Crump"" (Aneta Corsaut).

""Helen"" first appeared in Episode 86 (""Andy Discovers America""; first aired on March 4, 1963), and she would remain a major part of the show's cast for the rest of the series' 5-plus years on the air.

Some of my favorite shows from this third ""TAGS"" season include .... ""Floyd, The Gay Deceiver"", ""Convicts-At-Large"", ""The Bed Jacket"", ""Barney's First Car"", ""High Noon In Mayberry"", ""The Big House"", ""Lawman Barney"", and ""Mr. McBeevee"".

Plus, there's ""Man In A Hurry"" (Episode #79; aired on January 14, 1963), which is one of the very best installments in the entire series, and is the episode which spawned the humorous dialogue I've used as my title for this review (one of many hilarious moments in that ep.).

""Man In A Hurry"" features all the easy-going, low-key, carefree elements that made Mayberry, North Carolina, such a great place to visit each and every week.

""Hurry"" has ""Malcolm Tucker"" (played wonderfully by Robert Emhardt) being forced to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon and evening in the sleepy little village of Mayberry after his car breaks down just outside of town. This does not please the enterprising Mr. Tucker in the least. You see, Mr. Tucker is definitely a ""man in a hurry"" when he comes across the kind folks of Mayberry. He has no time for homemade ice cream, or Sunday afternoon naps, or unbroken apple peelings.

But -- after spending a day with Andy, Opie, Barney, and Aunt Bee -- Mr. Tucker, too, discovers that Mayberry's laid-back way of life can be very appealing. This episode's very touching and poignant ""epilogue"" (which is often cut out of syndicated TV prints of the show) really drives home the program's message. The musical score that accompanies this epilogue also enhances the mood and tender feeling of this scene. It's been a 'classic' episode since it first aired in early 1963; and it shall continue to be one of my personal favorites for all time.

""Man In A Hurry"" offers up a fabulous mix of laugh-out-loud scenes as well as bittersweet moments. Mr. Tucker's excited exasperation provides a fall-down-funny moment when he discovers there's simply no way on this Earth that he's going to be able to get a telephone call through Mayberry's solitary (and perpetually-tied-up) party-line switchboard........

Mr. Tucker (after he slams the phone down in frustration) -- ""Outrageous! Sheer idiocy! I can't believe this is happening to me! A public utility being tied up like this! You people are living in another world! This is the 20th century, don't you realize that?! The whole world is living in a desperate space age! Men are orbiting the Earth, international television has been developed -- and here, a whole town is standing still because two old women's feet fall asleep!!""

Barney Fife (completely unfazed by the 'Tucker tirade' he's just witnessed) -- ""I wonder what causes that?""

~Big ol' LOL!~

This third ""Andy Griffith Show"" campaign is a black-and-white season (like the first two years), and features many of the widely-circulated ""public domain"" episodes that have popped up on a wide variety of other VHS and DVD releases of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" over the years. But this Paramount boxed set tops all of those ""P.D."" versions of these episodes (by a mile)! These restored prints look just fantastic on these DVDs.

Plus, unlike many of the far-inferior ""public domain"" video releases of some of these eps., this Paramount complete-season set contains the originally-aired opening and closing ""Fishin' Hole"" theme music, which has been been restored and utilized for all of the shows within this DVD collection. This set also contains (for the most part) full-length, uncut shows (approx. 24 to 26 minutes per episode).*

* = Regarding ""Full-Length"" episodes --- Unfortunately, there are two episodes in this 32-show DVD set that are missing the closing epilogue scenes (""The Darlings Are Coming"" and ""Barney Mends A Broken Heart""). The ""Darlings"" show has a DVD run time of a little less than 22.5 minutes. So it's been cut here by about three minutes. ""Barney Mends"" runs 24:34. Besides the epilogue on ""Darlings"", some other bits and pieces of the episode are absent too (particularly during the scene in the jail cell).

I'm pretty sure that the epilogue is the only portion missing on ""Barney Mends"" (when Barney's big mouth gets him in trouble again when he says in front of Peggy -- ""Andy really didn't care nothin' about that girl"").

I also noticed that the video quality of the ""Darlings"" episode is not quite as good as the other shows in this set. It's considerably ""darker"" than the other episodes; although it still IS a fairly-good DVD transfer of this ep. overall, quite ""clean""-looking with very little grain or other video distractions, which I was pleased to note (since this show was obviously taken from a different source than other programs in this collection). But the very dark video does become quite noticeable during the nighttime ""shinnying down the rope"" scene.

So, it would appear (for some reason) that Paramount was unable to locate a full-length, 25-minute print of that episode to place on this DVD set. Although, oddly enough, that particular program IS intact, sporting a run time of 25-plus minutes, on some of the lesser-quality ""public domain"" DVDs that have been marketed in recent years; which begs the question -- why didn't Paramount tap one of those prints for this seasonal boxed set?

~shrugs unknowingly~

But, anyway, at least the folks at Paramount Home Video give buyers a warning about the edits on this set, with these words printed in four different places on the packaging .... ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"". (Although, since it's obvious that some shows have been edited, I'm curious as to why Paramount has utilized the words ""may be"", instead of the more appropriate ""have been"" in this instance.)

~additional shrug~

Even though the ""Darlings"" episode has been trimmed, I'm glad to see that two of the most humorous scenes remain intact on the DVD. Those being:

Briscoe's admonition to ""the boys"" -- ""Now let's try 'Slimy River Bottom', and this time make it per-ty!""

And the exchange between Andy and hotel clerk John Masters --

ANDY -- ""I warned them earlier today on a '907'.""
JOHN (fully aware immediately of what Official Mayberry Police Code ""#907"" indicated) -- ""Dippin' a hat in a horse trough.""
ANDY -- ""Right.""

~ LOL! ~

While I hate edited, chopped-up TV shows as much as the next ""Andy"" fan, I for one am more than willing to give Paramount the benefit of the ""editing"" doubt with regard to this TAGS set. Based on past reputation for releasing full-length programs (with excellent PQ) whenever humanly possible, I'm confident that Paramount has done all it can do to provide DVD buyers with the best product that could be obtained. And ""unedited"" whenever practicable.

I also am most certainly not of the ""Throw The Baby Out With The Bathwater"" mindset when it comes to purchasing TV-On-DVD products that contain a very few minutes cut out of them -- meaning: I'm certainly not willing to deprive myself of the 808 minutes of superb programming that reside on the five Digital Discs in this ""TAGS"" Season-Three set (not even counting the approx. 28 minutes of ""Sponsor Spots"") -- just because the total 32-episode running time is supposed to be approx. 813 minutes.

Now, if a whole bunch of these shows were taken from inferior syndicated (and truncated) versions (which is definitely not the case with this TAGS set), then I'd be upset indeed. But when only about 0.6% (or even less) of the original network content is absent, and the episodes look THIS sensational overall (as is the case with this Andy #3 set from Paramount), then IMO those missing 5 minutes of footage (out of 813) are literally akin to a drop in the proverbial bucket, and just flat-out not worth the mental torture that would most assuredly be brought on by NOT purchasing this boxed set just because 0.6% of the original content has been omitted (and the angst of knowing I decided to intentionally forego the pleasure of owning these many, many terrific ""Andy"" entries simply due to two missing epilogues and/or a missing line of dialogue in one or two shows).**

** = That's just my own opinion, of course. But, at the same time, I can also certainly respect another person's decision to stand by his/her ""Edited Episodes = No Sale!"" principles.

DVD BONUS FEATURES -- Just like the second-season Andy Griffith Show set, this third-season set includes many ""Original Sponsor Spots"", each of which lasts about one minute. These are vintage commercial advertisements featuring the show's cast members plugging various products, like Sanka Coffee, Post brand breakfast cereals, and a new product for Season 3 -- Jell-O Puddings.

There are 29 ""Sponsor Spots"" scattered throughout the five discs, with only three episodes lacking a unique commercial ad (one of which is ""The Darlings Are Coming"", giving another indication that Paramount just could not unearth the original film print of that episode).

Picture quality is very good, too, for these ads. These very clever and well-written commercial spots are really fun to watch, as Andy, Opie, et al, stay in ""character"" to pitch the different sponsor's products. It's just exactly the type of vintage, hard-to-find, rarely-seen stuff that I love to see included on DVD sets like this. Hats off to Paramount for making these ads available here.

One especially funny commercial spot is the one that's attached to the episode ""Lawman Barney"", which features Deputy Fife having his pistol confiscated yet again by Sheriff Taylor after Barney shoots up the Taylor's kitchen, resulting in some leaky pipes.

Another humorous ""Jell-O Pudding"" ad (for the ""McBeevee"" episode) has Opie's make-believe horse sticking his (real) head in through Andy's kitchen window. That one had me tickled too.

Even ""Mr. Tucker"" and the ""Mendlebright Sisters"" (the gabby, telephone-happy old ladies who have all that trouble with their feet) from the ""Man In A Hurry"" episode get in on the act in one of the commercials for Sanka Coffee (in the ""nice-to-hold new jar"", too!). ""Out-stand-ingly good coffee"". :-)

To watch any of the 29 ""Sponsor Spots"", a Sub-Menu must be accessed, where each of that disc's ""Spots"" can be played. Each ad can be watched individually, or you can view all of them consecutively via a handy ""Play All"" option that is also available.

Some additional info about this DVD set.............

VIDEO -- Standard TV Ratio (Full Frame; 1.33:1). B&W.

AUDIO -- Dolby Digital (2.0 Mono). English only.

MENUS -- Non-animated. Without music. No Episode Sub-Menus are included; the Main Menu also serves as an ""Episode Selection"" Menu. .... There is one Sub-Menu (for each disc's ""Sponsor Spots""). ... Six Paramount DVD ads come up automatically when you load up Disc #1 (only). To bypass these ads, press ""Forward Chapter Advance"" (or ""Skip"") on your remote six times consecutively.

Oddly enough, these very same Paramount ads also can be accessed from Disc One's Main Menu, via a separate Menu choice (marked ""Previews""). This redundancy regarding these DVD Previews sort of makes me wonder if Paramount, at some point during the creation of these DVDs, had the idea of eliminating the semi-annoying ""automatic load-up ads"" on Disc 1 for this boxed set, and just have the customer browse the ads at their leisure via the Main Menu (which, of course, I'm sure is the preferred method if you were to ask virtually any DVD buyer).

But, for some reason, Paramount placed the ads on the Main Menu AND decided to stick them onto the front of Disc 1 as part of the load-up procedure, too. This repetition will probably serve to tick off even more people who can't stand such ""forced"" material on any DVD product, because by placing the very same advertisements on the Menu itself, it makes having them also a part of the initial disc load-up seem completely unnecessary.

The six TV DVD Previews, btw, last a tad more than six minutes total, and are the exact same ads that are also on the second-season DVD boxed set of ""TAGS"" (except they're shown in a slightly-different order than on the Season-Two set).

""PLAY ALL EPISODES"" OPTION? -- Yes.

CHAPTER BREAKS INCLUDED? -- Yes; Five Chapter Stops per program.

PACKAGING -- The five discs come packaged inside three individual ""Slim"" clear plastic cases, with Discs 1 and 2 being held in the first case; Discs 3 and 4 go into the second case; and the third case houses just a single disc (#5). .... Each disc is single-sided, with artwork. There's an outer cardboard slipcase box that comfortably holds the three slim disc cases. The slipcase is identical in design (and lettering on the box) to the two previously-released Andy Griffith sets. I like the uniformity of this packaging that Paramount has maintained here. Season Three looks right at home next to Seasons 1 and 2.

A common ""Wally's Filling Station"" theme has been used for the inner packaging here, with a reasonable facsimile of an automobile tire adorning each of the discs, plus images of wrenches and other tools printed on the inside and back of the three slim cases.

Episode information is included on the back of each of the three slim cases (in the guise of a ""Wally's Filling Station"" invoice), with more detailed summaries available on the inside of the cases (underneath each disc itself). There are either 6 or 7 episodes on each disc.

Something new that I like very much about this Season-Three set is the fact that there is a complete episode list on the back of the outer box. This handy at-a-glance program listing also tells you what episodes are located on what discs.

A final closing ""gush"".......

Season 3 of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" is yet another winning season in the eight-year history of this charming rural sitcom. ""T.A.G.S."" is truly a one-of-a-kind TV series that we'll almost certainly never see the likes of ever again.

And via these superior-quality DVDs, it seems as though these 32 third-season shows are all brand-new once again. This is a great season of a treasured TV show ... a great DVD set (despite the five minutes or so of edits) ... and a great bargain, to boot.",1124496000,42,15770,4.945894816496406
2322133,3,B0009UC7MK,"Someone on the TAGSRWC bulletin board jogged my meory. There WAS an epilogue to ""Barney Mends a Broken Heart"" where Miss Peggy was tending Andy's black eye! And that epilogue IS SHOWN ON TV LAND!!!!

And the reviewer who said there's a brief dialogue exchange missing with Otis where he says he's celebrating the anniversary of his first drink in ""Barney and the Governor"" is correct.

So there's no excuse for this. I'm torn between enjoying having the set (this was a GREAT season) and siding with the reviewer who says that if you buy this set in edited form you're telling Paramount that you don't care and they don't have to bother with complete episodes. I think at the very least every fan should write a STRONG letter saying that we won't buy FUTURE edited sets.",1124496000,19,770,4.613138686131387
2322134,5,B0009UC7MK,"It`s not as bad as what people are making it out to be. Obviously some of these reviewers wouldn`t know an epilogue if they saw one.  There`s only ONE episode that`s missing an epilogue. Probably due to a deteriorated master. The other 31 shows are intact and complete, w/epilogues. Try watching the dvds before posting a misinformed review.",1124496000,4,341,4.879310344827586
2322135,1,B0009UC7MK,"I could not believe my eyes when I read the fine print on the back of the box that says ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions.""  Cutting footage for more commercial time is simply NOT acceptable for a DVD release, because sponsors are not paying for it, WE are!  These box sets are supposed to be our escape from the ever-increasing editing of our favorite old TV shows to allow for the continually growing amount of required commercial time.  If a major studio such as Paramount is going to stoop to this level and offer us an inferior product such as this, we HAVE to take a stand and refuse to support it!  Anyone who buys this product KNOWING that it contains edited episodes is only sending a message to Paramount that they can put out any old kind of garbage on the market and it will be bought!  [...]Why should we settle for less?  We're paying good money for this, so it should not be something we can tune in to TV Land and watch.  We need the versions that we can't see anywhere else, and only Paramount can provide them to us.  [...]",1124409600,38,1073,4.35678391959799
2322136,4,B0009UC7MK,"If this set had been completely intact I would have given it 5 stars, but I had to knock 1 star off for the edits.  I'm glad Paramount at least had the integrity to put a warning on the box, albeit in fine print.  Not that true fans wouldn't have noticed anyway; Paramount would have suffered more fan backlash if they had not included the warning.  I hope there will be no need for any such warnings on future sets.",1124323200,6,416,4.175
2322137,5,B0009UC7MK,"From a purest view, several epiodes have been chopped up a bit.  Not a major problem, but to shell out good bread for an old show reran constantly, we demand video perfection from the releasing studio; Paramount Home Video.

Some episode commentary here.  After watching the episode ""Andy and Opie, Bachelors"", I had forgotten how beautiful Joanna Moore was and her singing 'Down In The Valley' was simply superb.  Why she didn't continue on as Andy's love interest is a shame.  And why they added ole lady Helen Crump, a mean, nasty, snap mouthed character for nice guy Andy Taylor never did make sense.  She had her moments but never came close to the likabilty scale to say, the likes of ""No last name"" Thelma Lou.  Now she was a sweetheart.",1124323200,7,744,4.633587786259542
2322138,1,B0009UC7MK,"Everyone is saying that ""Darlings are Coming"" is edited, and it definitely is.  However there are other episodes missing epilogues too.  Andy & Opie Bachelors has a missing epilogue.  The part where they are sitting on the porch with Peggy singing ""Cindy"" is not included.  I can see edited episodes on several TV channels, why would I buy them?",1124236800,24,345,4.796610169491525
2322139,5,B0009UC7MK,"Concerning the ""may be edited"" message on the back of the box, for those who are worried, which is probably most everyone who loves the show-- from research, it appears that all episodes are full-length except ""The Darlings are Coming,"" which is missing the epilogue.  Sources say this was left out because of poor quality video.  However, this footage is available on a public domain release, called ""Best of the Andy Griffith Show,"" but of course the quality is considerably less.

*UPDATE*  As others have pointed out, unfortunately a few of the other episodes are indeed missing footage.  Here are the running times of each episode, if it helps anyone to decipher exactly which are uncut or not:

2322141,5,B0009UC7MK,"One of the most beloved shows in television history, The Andy Griffith Show takes its viewers back to a simpler time of small town America, apple pie, and black and white television... The trademark whistling theme song is one of the most recognizable in history, and the duration of the show in syndicated reruns is unrivaled by its peers.

The Andy Griffith Show follows the exploits of the small town of Mayberry and its family values, no nonsense sheriff Andy. Widowed, and father to a small boy named Opie (Ron Howard), Andy is joined in Mayberry by his sidekick Deputy Barney Fife, his relative and housekeeper Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier), and a host of other eccentric characters.

But the show stealer is Barney Fife (Don Knotts) who plays the role of a sometimes incompetent, kooky deputy always in over his head. The onscreen dynamic between Griffith and Knotts is truly magical. Both men would go on to heralded careers in show business with Knotts starring in numerous roles, such as Mr. Furley on Three's Company, and Griffith as the title star of Matlock. Ron Howard (Opie) would go on to establish himself as one of Hollywood's most well-known directors...

The Andy Griffith Show (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Mr. McBeevee"" in which Opie makes friends with a telephone repairman named Mr. McBeevee who he describes to Andy and Barney as a man who lives in the trees, jingles when he walks, and has twelve extra hands! Since they've never meet Mr. McBeevee, Andy and Barney think that Opie's new friend is make believe - at least until Opie comes home with a quarter he says Mr. McBeevee gave him! Now, Andy must investigate or else risk punishing his son for stealing the quarter... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Barney Mends a Broken Heart"" in which Barney complicates Andy's love life by fixing him up with a new girl when Andy's date, Peggy, cancels on him, and ""Barney and the Governor"" in which Barney is given a personal commendation by the Governor for his excellent job performance, but turns up drunk when Otis spikes the water cooler...
