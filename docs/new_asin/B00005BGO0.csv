1422078,4,B00005BGO0,"The video is converted to DVD and it is a bit ""scratchy"" and patchy in parts.  Other than this, it is an impressive production.  For those who saw it during the 1970's it brings back some nostalgia.  For my school students in junior high it will be an excellent resource.  There is clearly historical accuracy which is encouraging.  For example, in one scene the young Arthur wears a helmet that is a close replica of the Sutton Hoo helmet (not bad considering that the helmet had not been correctly reconstructed until 1968).

King Arthur: The Young Warlord was a very good buy that I can highly recommend.",1277078400,,607,4.626168224299065
1422079,3,B00005BGO0,"I actually couldn't decide whether to leave 2 or 3 stars.  In the end I went with three because it was either a gift or a didn't fully read the description.

I wasn't expecting much in the realm of cinematics and sound.  After all, this was made in 1972-3 - and by the BBC no less - but hey, I'm an Arthurian buff (both the fantasy based as well as the various attempts at the more probable historical Arthurs).  This was of the latter sort and sticking fairly close with history while imbuing Arthur with a different sort of magic, i.e. intelligent forethought.

My main grievance with this DVD is, as I mentioned, the fact that this is NOT the entire series, it is an entire series crammed down into two hours.  When credits started rolling I thought it signalled the end of the pilot.  Again, I'm not sure how I missed this fact except if I had received it as a gift.  Regardless, assuming the ending that I did see was essentially the ending of the series in Britain; well, it would seem that I would be doomed nonetheless by that wonderful feeling of, ""What do you mean it's been cancelled?  I want to know how certain things end up, here!""

I suppose it doesn't matter who I might recommend this to as I noticed that Amazon is no longer stocking these.",1236729600,4,1258,4.360515021459228
1422080,3,B00005BGO0,"Well it's about time this rarely seen series finally made it to Dvd,a gritty portrayal of the legend which i loved as a kid. However its been largely ruined by a distracting voiceover, poor quality tranfer and a confusing mess of editing. The original theme music has also been lost to a terribly cheap sounding soundtrack and crappy title sequence.
Luckily for me i still have some complete episodes on VHS,however its about time this show had a digitally remastered full series release. Hopefully that UK based company Network Tv will get hold of it, as they have many other classic British Adventure serials of the 60's and 70's.
I award my three stars solely for the chance to see the show again, not for quality or enjoyment.",1188604800,,730,4.7109375
1422081,5,B00005BGO0,"This thrilling film throws out every traditional hollywood portrait of Arthur. Gone are the Knights of the Round Table, Guinevere and Lancelot, Mordred, the traditional drawing of the sword in the stone, and (sadly) even Merlin. Gone too are the flamboyant robes, roman armor, and well-lit scenes of previous (actually later) films.

 What you get is an impressive attempt to paint life as it was: Camelot is a primitive village and Arthur has plenty to do as a shrewd and determined warrior-king among many such kings with whom he both allies and uses for his own ends (noble of course).

 In keeping with history, the story is set during the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain after Rome has withdrawn (500 A.D. or so). In terms of storyline The Young Warlord does not follow a single plot, but is more episodes of Arthur's dealings with his people, the rival kings, and the Saxons.

 In short if you want a historical view see this film; if you want hollywood there are plenty other films to pick from.",1143417600,9,1002,4.7298850574712645
1422082,1,B00005BGO0,"This movie is a reduction of the original show made by collecting some episodes and sometimes only screen-shots of episodes, kept together by a narrator who tells the story of Arthur and the Celts.

Maybe it is this puzzle like way chosen to present the show that makes it odd, but in any case it is a movie too much aged (in acting and colors) and the entire story is quite boring.",1143417600,3,382,4.305555555555555
1422083,4,B00005BGO0,"I was delighted to have (at last) obtained a copy of this.  Yes, the quality of colour and sound is poor, but who cares!  This was a ground-breaking programme, and it still stands up well after more than two decades.  I hope one day it will be available in the original unedited version, and transferred to DVD.  It deserves to be seen, just as much as Robin Of Sherwood, which is now available as a complete edition on DVD (also an HTV programme).  There are thousands of people in the UK who would buy this fondly remembered series.",1044144000,6,534,4.408163265306122
1422084,5,B00005BGO0,"This is a compilation of several episodes of ""Arthur of the Britons"", a children's series broadcast weekly in Britain in the 1970's. I taped it on late night TV and viewed it with great skepticism. ""This is the story of the true Arthur."" Yeah, right - let's just see about that. But the more I researched, the more accuracy I found in its historicity, depiction of life at that time, and the delicious possibilities for what the real Arthur might have been like.
This Arthur has a slightly wicked sense of humor but always a true vision governing all his actions that draw the viewer in and make one push past all those two dimensional dusty notions of the legendary Arthur to unearth the sometimes raw but wonderfully understated charismatic leader. I especially loved this version's telling of the sword in the stone. You get to see what might have been the basis for the legendary tales of Arthur and Camelot. That reality is not as glamorous, but to me it was loads more exciting.
This was a real man whose vision and determination lit a fire in the human psyche that has yet to be extinguished. He used strategy, psychology, and traditional warfare techniques to achieve what no leader had been able to do up to that point - unite disparate tribes to fight against a common invading enemy.
The costumes, sets, et. al. won the series awards for historical accuracy. The series itself won the British equivalent of an Emmy for Best Children's Series. This video is a marvel!!! Brian Blessed as Mark of Cornwall will have you laughing out loud! The entire cast is marvelous.  I have purchased two versions of the video to keep in my collection.",1027382400,7,1646,4.6563573883161515
1422085,3,B00005BGO0,"OK, technically we can fault this but it was a child of its time. A generation brought up on Star Wars might not understand that this was what we got as entertainment back in the very early 70s. Yes, this is a  selection of a TV series and the editing's bad and so are the wigs but this  was a low budget series back then. The language is totally too modern but  go with the flow, enjoy and we women can admire the lovely Oliver Tobias  who to his credit puts in a very believeable performance and the gorgeous  Michael Gothard. A lovely momento of a series I wish was available in its  entireity - using first generation tapes please!",959299200,11,635,4.25
1422086,4,B00005BGO0,"I appreciate the comments of Robert, however I must disagree, this version of Arthur I beleive would be more to the 'real' Arthur. The video cover does give the impression that you are about to watch a Hollywood type film  with knights in shinig armour, but for anyone who watch the original series  in 1972 would know different. As for the colour going in and out - it was  made for PAL television and then converted to NTSC and you will probably be  watching it on a NTSC video player that converts the signal bacl to a PAL  format, I'm not surpriseed that there is some colour fluctuations.
All  said and done the I found the film a joy to watch especially the marriage  feast, it was so funny. Anyone who watched the original series maybe be  disappointed about the colour, however I'm sure that ardent fans who  haven't been able to watch the program for well over 20yrs (last shown in  the UK 1983) will be well pleased.
I would hope that sometime in the  future HTV the makers and current holders of the rites to the series will  by public pressure release the whole series on video in the UK.",929232000,12,1100,4.391089108910891

7937276,2,B00005BGO0,I saw this movie along time ago and really enjoyed it. The reason I gave only 2 stars was the movie you are showing is of very poor quality and in my opinion unwatchable. I watched only 10 minutes and canceled it out. Amazon you should check on this and I know there are better prints out there.,1485388800,,295,4.103448275862069
7937277,3,B00005BGO0,"1975 edited down from UK TV show. Well-known plot, low budget 1970's filmography.  Its okay if you like the Arthurian myth (I do).",1483401600,,130,4.6521739130434785

7937279,1,B00005BGO0,"Some people have said that since Arthur of the Britons has not been released on Region 1 DVD this film is better than nothing. They are wrong. Having never seen the series I decided to check this out to see what it was like. I immediately regretted it. By 20 minutes in they had covered at least five episodes leaving me utterly lost and bored. The episodes were held together through a boring narration which took the place of all the exposition that they didn't have time for. The entire thing featured one thing happening after another with no rhyme or reason to it (which is fine in an episodic TV series). It's just an incomprehensible mess. The video quality is pretty bad as well, although a lot of that is the fault of the original series.

Please don't take any of this as criticism of Arthur of the Britons. That is an excellent show which I finally gave a chance after years of assuming it was like this. But everything good about that show has been abbreviated to the point of incomprehensibility and it just emphasizes much that was unsatisfactory about the original series: specifically the budget and the action. What made the show great were the individual episodes that dealt with one basic plot at a time. This combines them all and removes all of what made the series interesting. That series is available&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B002OCX60I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>&nbsp;in Region 2 (European) format. If you have a region free DVD player then there's no reason you shouldn't go with that one. If you don't then all I can say is wait patiently and remember. This film just isn't worth it.",1320364800,2,1677,4.989285714285714
