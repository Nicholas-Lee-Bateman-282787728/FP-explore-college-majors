5739788,3,B00CTPRGDI,"I am a senior who has arthritis in my lumbar spine.  I rented this video from my library, a procedure I recommend in order to determine if it will meet your needs.  I did the beginner level.  I WOULD recommend this video for those with arthritis in the lower back, IF YOU CAN GET ONTO THE FLOOR!!  Most of the work is done on the floor, even in the beginner workout.  There are a few standing poses at the end of the workout, but you need to be able to balance on one leg - i.e. ""Tree pose"".  NONE of the poses are done with the assistance of a chair, or seated in a chair.",1447632000,2,573,3.9391304347826086
5739789,5,B00CTPRGDI,"So I've posted reviews of a few other yoga for arthritis DVD's on here, one of which was for a Peggy Cappy DVD.  Though I still stand by the positive review I gave her, I will say that her DVD didn't end up being one that I could continue to use in the long term on a daily basis.  THIS one is really doing it for me, and for reasons that are pretty important.

First of all, this DVD has been put together through the collaboration of a doctor with years of experience working with people who have arthritis and a yoga instructor.  That's a pretty awesome thing to have them combine their experience and knowledge, and it shows in the routines.  I'm 30 and was diagnosed with arthritis almost 2 years ago after about 5 years of chronic pain.  I've had to work my way back into doing yoga which I used to enjoy, and it's been a real struggle for me to find yoga routines I can do on a regular basis.  I have started doing the beginner routine on here every day, and it seems to work beautifully for me.  It stretches me just enough, and it doesn't strain any of the more problematic areas of my body (again, I think this is due to having a doctor help in the making of this DVD).  The poses used are simple but seem carefully and thoughtfully targeted on problem areas, and on gently strengthening core muscles which is centrally important for those with arthritis.

In terms of the actual content of the DVD - there are 3 main routines, for beginner, intermediate and advanced.  They each range from 15-30 minutes.  There is an extra section of tutorials for anyone who wants more guided, slower, and careful instruction on each individual pose - very useful to anyone who has had limited experience with yoga or who wants to understand how each pose might interact with their arthritis.  And then there are a few extra bonus features that I haven't looked at yet.

I think my only small critique might be that the routines do move at quite a clip - she moves quickly through all the moves, so if you haven't done too much yoga before, you'll either want to take a little separate time with the tutorials or maybe choose a DVD that's a little more sedate.

It's a big deal that I found this right now, and it's helping me hugely to stay active and energetic on a daily basis, which for arthritic folk is a tough order sometimes.",1447545600,7,2329,4.358796296296297
5739790,5,B00CTPRGDI,"I have done this video four times since I recieved it and I must say that I enjoy it. Its going to take a bit longer to see if it will alleviate the minor knee pain I sometimes have due to light arthritis in it. I do feel stretched out and relaxed afterwards so I tend to do it after my nightly hot shower, just before going to bed.",1446854400,5,332,3.8260869565217392

5739792,5,B00CTPRGDI,"This is one of my go-to programs for feeling better. There are three workout options from which to choose: beginner, intermediate, and advanced, that correlate well with how much intensity I want for each 15-20 minute segment. I can do just one or a combination depending on how I feel and how much time I have. Love this.",1445040000,10,322,4.568965517241379
5739793,5,B00CTPRGDI,"I had read the book and was excited to try the program but found it difficult to follow from the text, so was thrilled to find the DVD. It is exactly what I needed.

5739809,5,B00CTPRGDI,"Arthritis Rx is a fantastic addition to the Rx series of books written by Dr Vijay Vad. It is easy to follow, it provides a step-by-step tutorial for each exercise, which was a god send to me. I recently had seen Dr Vad's on PBS speaking about how to approach healthy living, lifestyle improvements which included various levels of exercise and diet. I then looked into what other literature/publications he has developed. I am a true believer in combining various methods of NON-Invasive treatments and remedies to any form of ailment you may be suffering from. This book like the other confidently provides a combination of therapies and is very highly effectiveness. It has changed my lifestyle and I am very active and pain free, which allows me to do the things I have been wanting to do for a long time. Excellent...",1374624000,9,822,4.755244755244755
