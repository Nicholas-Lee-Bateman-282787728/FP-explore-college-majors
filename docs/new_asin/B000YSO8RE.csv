It may have some parts where you are expected to laugh and you know is not gonna happen, but after all I would say this is a funny movie. Just by the title you can realize that it must be at least a little funny.

But the movie was slow, never gaining much momentum.  This is another movie that I'd have preferred to rent, but the local rental places didn't have it in their selections.  So I bought it.  Definitely not worth the cost.

This movie would not have even been on my radar screen if it hadn't been for the lead actor in the movie, Adam Gregory.  As a country music fan, he is one of my favorites.  So I gave the movie a shot.

He is one of the two redeeming qualities of this movie (hence my two star rating).  The second redeeming quality probably won't have much of an impact on many people because it's the location.  The movie was filmed in Langley, BC - the place where I was born and raised.  I've eaten in the restaurants some scenes were filmed in, I went to the same bowling alley . . . No matter what happens, where my life takes me, I'll always have a piece of home on film to take with me.",1221782400,,1024,4.163265306122449
