623483,4,630331578X,"All the Winnie-the-Pooh stories emphasize the themes of friendship and loyalty and are amongst the best animated features for children [toddlers-preschoolers]. This DVD contains a double feature - ""Un-Valentine's Day"" sees Rabbit cancelling Valentine's Day, but when Pooh receives a pot of honey, the little bear goes off in search of his benefactor, determined to respond in kind. In ""A Valentine for You"", Christopher Robin gets bitten by a smitten, and the Hundred Acre Wood gang think the only way to cure him is to find a love bug that will bite him and cancel out the previous bite! There is also a short feature where Pooh Bear re-tells the Three Little Pigs tale. The total running time is 60 mins.",1249171200,,706,4.8429752066115705

623486,3,630331578X,"As another reviewer said, this has a truly horrible menu system.  You need to wait through long introductions.  You can't just move the pointer in some of the menus--you need to wait for the annoying smitten to move to the option you want, and then press select before he moves to the next one.  Moreover, I have never figured out how to play the other movie after playing one.  I can go back to the menu, but not the disk menu, only the menu for that movie.  The only way to play the other movie that I have found is turn off the DVD player and turn it back on (more time wasted).

The content is fine and the mastering is good.",1176076800,2,629,4.114754098360656
623487,3,630331578X,"The DVD is a collection of two Pooh videos that were released on VHS years ago, so that's a good deal. The disc is split into two separate pieces one: one is two episodes from The New Adventures of Winnie The Pooh tv show (UnValentine's Day and The Three Little Piglets) and a special that aired once on ABC years ago (A Valentine for You).

The DVD itself is simply horrid.  The mastering in fine, it's the menus that are just the worst thing I've ever seen.  There are 1-2 minute introductions to every menu.

Let's say I want to watch the first feature... I have to sit through the first menu for at least a minute while it explains the that there are two different features...a minute of this...Can I fast forward through it?  No, however mastered the DVD decided that I should not be able to fast forward through this idiotic introduction. Ok, fine...I'm through to the next menu...this should be fine...but no...I have to sit through another introduction telling me if I want to play the movie I should select the play option and then it goes on about the other options...do I care? no.  Do the children who have been crying for 10 minutes about the darn DVD not playing care? No. I just want the stupid movie to play.",1166313600,12,1224,4.441964285714286
623488,4,630331578X,"This DVD contains two previousley released on VHS Winnie the Pooh packaged features, ""Un-Valentine's Day"" and ""A Valentine For You.""
""A Valentine For You"" is the better of the two features. When Owl tells the gang that Christopher Robin has been bitten by a smitten, a bug that causes love sickness, they go on a quest to find another one because they believe that if another one bites him, it will cancel out the first bite.
""Un-Valentine's Day"" was an episode of the hugeley popular ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" series. Rabbit decides to cancel Valentine's Day because Pooh sent everybody too many valentines the previous year. But when Pooh receives a pot of honey, he tries to find out who sent it and return the favor. Without commercials, this episode is only 21 minuites long. So to make this feature an even 30 minuites, they added a shorter episode from the series, ""Three Little Pigs,"" in which Pooh tells the classic fabel as only he can.
The DVD is 60 minuites long and the bonus feature is a game called ""Catch the Love Bug."" This DVD is perfect for kids and Pooh fans alike.",1074384000,16,1099,4.583756345177665
623489,5,630331578X,"I love hearing that the classic older Pooh shows/movies come to DVD.

623490,2,630331578X,"I like winnie the pooh but this is just plain not good. Wanna know why?Here is why:
1. The point of the story is they cancel valentines day because they get to many cards. So what if you have to many?What are they trying to teach?That the cancel one of the most important holidays OVER A FEW TWO MUCH STINKIN'CARDS?!?!
2. Pooh gets a valentine,and thinks it was from piglet and he gives it to him and piglet gives one to tigger.etc...What are they turning it into,a card giving frenzy?It wastes the whole thing about that and they all say its from chirstaphor robin! Didn't you ever hear the saying not the victem until proven guilty?IT COULD BE EEYORE BUT NOOO THEY DON'T EVEN THINK OF HIM.Poor,poor eeyore...
3. Then Rabbit makes a show for chirstaphor robin. Again with no thinking of eeyore! He is always sad but then they make him even sadder?WHY DOESN'T HE GET A SPECIAL SHOW?There so mean to him. Just because he isn't as exciting as the rest of the pooh crew?BAD
See?Thats why. But if you like it,thats okay, ... If you buy it sure you will see your favorite pooh charecters but hey,charecters don't matter",1013644800,,1114,4.51980198019802

623660,3,630331578X,"The menu features on this DVD are terrible.  The first time my family played this DVD, my husband and I both looked at each other and said ""REALLY?""

I'm perfectly capable of listening to and following directions.  The 'how to play a DVD for Dummies' menu dialog is really long, and you have to listen to a fair bit of it before it explains that you can skip the instructions by using the ""double right"" arrow button.  Kind of a vague instruction, since most DVD players have a Skip forward button, a slow search button, and directional buttons.  It's iritating for me and my kids.  I'd rather buy the 2 titles in this double feature separately to avoid this horrible menu system.  Also, once you've watched one of the features, it returns you to the title menu of the same feature you just watched instead of back to the main menu where you can select the other title.  I've yet to figure out how to bypass this without turning the DVD player off and on again.

That being said about the DVD, the movies are cute.  In 'A Valentine for You' we see Christopher Robin making a valentine for a girl.  Pooh thinks his friend has an illness of some kind and wants to make his friend well again by catching the 'smitten' that CR has been plagued with.  We also get to see Owl fumble through explaining the difference between boys and girls to the rest of the 100 Acre Wood friends.  Sweet songs in this one, too.

In an 'Un-Valentine's Day' Rabbit decides to cancel Valentine's Day because Pooh sent out too many last year, causing a huge mess in the 100 Acre Wood. But when a Valentine pot of honey arrives on Pooh's doorstep, he leads to the assumption that Piglet sent it to him. Soon everyone is secretly giving Valentines to one another behind Rabit's back.",1311552000,,1756,4.446875
