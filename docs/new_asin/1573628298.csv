Boutwell Auditorium

Birmingham, Alabama

Laverne Clark vs. Fabiano Iha:

Clarke is a straight-up boxer, while Iha is versed primarily in Jui Jitsu. This should be interesting... and it is. It's stopped early due to a cut.

Wanderlei Silva vs. Tony Petarra:

In Silva's UFC debut at Ultimate Brazil, he was devastated immediately by a young Vitor Belfort. Those of us who have followed his career since may call that fight something of a fluke.. In this, his second UFC appearance (the first in the US), Silva is determined to make a better showing. He does and the fight ends in classic Wanderlei Silva fashion.

David Roberts vs. Marcello Mello:

This one didn't get me all that fired up. It ends quickly by way of ground and pound. Nothing of note to speak of here.

Pete Williams vs. Travis Fulton:

Fulton, although still young, is one of the most experienced veterans in all of mixed martial arts. Pete Williams is the young gun out of the Lion's Den camp. The fight is fairly entertaining, with both fighters doing well when it ends abruptly by way of a submission.

Pedro Rizzo vs. Tra Telligman:

There are fireworks in this fight. Telligman blazes out early with a flurry on Rizzo. Rizzo then turns the tides. He get to see two great strikers go at it on their feet until one man finally falls. Great fight.

Bas Rutten vs. Kevin Randleman:

I was very excited to see Bas Rutten in action again in the UFC after his war against Kohsaka in his debut. Much hype came attached to Rutten and it was time to see if he could measure up.

Randleman controls early with the use of his power and body weight. It is clear that he wants no part of Rutten standing, so he tries to keep Bas down as best he can. Rutten suffers a broken nose while grinding it out with Randleman for the better part of the first round. Rutten's face grows messier as the fight wears on, with Randleman seemingly in control. He lies on top of Rutten for most of the fight, with Rutten doing his best to strike from the bottom and Randleman occassionally striking down on Rutten. Whenever the fight does go to the feet, the formula goes like this: Randleman stalks, Rutton kicks, Randleman takes him down and lies on top of him. It's somewhat frustrating to watch. I would have loved to see more standup, but Randleman played it smart and kept the fight on the ground.

The fight goes to a decision and the outcome is pretty shocking. It causes a stir of controversy in the arena... This is a decent UFC event, not a great one.",1153872000,,2517,4.474835886214442

7798488,4,1573628298,"Randy Couture's decision not to defend his UFC heavyweight title led to 18 months of no heavyweight champion. The main event of this card would finally introduce the new champ; but not without controversy.
UFC 20 (aka Battle for Gold) was a good card from start to finish. The night kicked off with an intriguing matchup between Laverne Clark and Fabiano Iha. Clark was back to add a victory over a world-class Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu warrior in Iha. The fight was quick with a bloody conclusion.
Next up we would see the return of Thai fighter Vanderlei Silva. With his UFC debut being a bust(ko'd by V.Belfort), Silva was out for redemption. Tony Paterra would be the aggressor against Silva, but the end was no suprise.
A new Brazilian fighter, Marcelo Mello would debut against a very tall and skinny fighter, David Roberts. Billed as a wrestler, Roberts looked more like a sophmore baskeball player. Textbook BJJ was needed to dispose of the ""stilt""
Lions Den fighter Pete Williams was back against the ""MMA Iron Man"" Travis Fulton. Williams at this point of his career seemed all but destined for some gold. Fulton while not being the most skilled(or toned) fighter certainly had experience in his corner. A good fight with some good reversals and submission attempts and finish.
Because being friends with Bas Rutten, Pedro Rizzo all but passed at his chance of UFC gold. But this young Brazilian was back with business in mind. At the other corner, Tre Telligman stood ready to stop Rizzo. The fight was suprisingly fast-paced up until a good KO for the winner.
The Main Event was a classic grappler vs. striker matchup. Kevin Randleman's unstoppable takedowns and punishing strikes vs. legendary kickboxer Bas Rutten. The fight as expected was a true war, with a broken nose involved in the mix. After regulation and overtime, the new champion was announced.....the controversy began. While about 75% of the I know  did not agree with the decision, after watching the fight carefully, it was a closer fight than the first time. A good fight otherwise.",988416000,6,2056,4.891117478510028
7798489,5,1573628298,"This was the best UFC I've seen.  I didn't recognize all of the fighters that competed but every fight was good.  Heavyweight Pete Williams (from my state, Texas) really impressed me in his bout against Travis Fulton.  If you leave the room to get some popcorn you could miss the lightning fast ending.  The light and middle weight bouts were both solid as well.  The championship was between Bas Rutten and Mark Coleman student Kevin Randleman.  This fight went the distance and the only bad part of the whole card was the decision at the end.  I won't say who won but in my opinion it was the wrong man.  That shouldn't prevent you from buying this tape, though, because it's the best UFC since the Gracie, Shamrock days.",982281600,6,723,4.550387596899225
