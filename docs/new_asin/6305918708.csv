1089434,5,6305918708,"Robert Altman is a master of films focusing dealing with numerous characters.  This may not be his masterpiece, but ""Nashville"" is one of those films that must be seen.  Although it's popularity is not as  high as it should be (due to its lack of availability), the film ranks as  important as any other from the 1970s.",944006400,,319,4.543859649122807
1089435,5,6305918708,"This movie represents the best of the spirit of independence and experimentation of American film-making in the 1970s.  It fits into neither the tradition of Hollywood linearity and star-worship that dominated U.S.  studios up to its time nor the ""high concept"" with its gimmicky  FX and product tie-ins which came to dominate Hollywood in the years since.  Altman has never been more inspired as a director, and no other film has  been able so effectively to capture the feeling of its era--in this case,  post-Woodstock, post-Watergate America on the verge of sliding back to  conservatism.  Unfortunately, the movie does not translate well to video.  Altman is painting here on a huge canvas and the film needs to be viewed on  a comparably huge screen.  Its theatrical re-release (as well as, one  hopes, the subsequent release of the soundtrack album and a letterbox  version on VHS) should prove that, despite the changes in hairstyles and  fashion, the courtship of American-style democratic politics and the  entertainment industry is as ego-driven, chaotic, and ultimately  out-of-touch today as Altman portrays its being in 1975.",916876800,,1139,5.2444444444444445

1089589,4,6305918708,"I think Nashville is one of Robert Altman's best movies.  I've watched it many times.  Ordered the dvd because my old tape no longer played well on my dvd/vcr machine.  I found it interesting to watch again during this 2016 US primary election season because in the movie a 3rd party pres. candidate is running as anti-gov't, and in 2016, a non-Republican has hijacked the R. nomination for Pres., on anti-gov't (anti- everything) rant, and a non-Democrat came close to hijacking the Dem. nomination.  In 1975 it was the Viet Nam war that divided the US populace.  Now?  Anyway, great cast, marvelous performances and music.  Best scene, for me:  when Barbara Harris picks up the microphone at the end and belts out her song.  Wonderful movie, 36 yrs. later.  A classic.",1464134400,2,770,4.809160305343512

1089591,1,6305918708,"This is one of the most hilarious movies ever made and I cannot say enough good things about it, but ordering it as a digital download to watch from St. John was a complete disaster.  Amazon has clearly NOT figured out how to deliver video streaming where there is less than ideal internet.  This movie was completely unwatchable - like looking at the most degraded VHS ever and one that periodically (think every few minutes) stops to recover itself.  A complete waste of the almost 14.00 Amazon charged me to ""buy"" it.  And I cannot see anywhere where Amazon offers to reimburse me.  I have Netflix for less than that amount per month and it plays video beautifully, even in internet-challenged areas like St. John.  But they didn't have Nashville available.
The final galling thing is that I already pay for Amazon Prime but this was extra and with NO rental option.  Next time I want to watch Nashville (or many older movies which now seem endangered) I'll bring along the DVD.  If I could ever reach an actual person at Amazon I'd demand a refund.",1455321600,,1052,4.618279569892473

Long before Jerry Seinfeld was doing a TV show 'about nothing,' Altman was putting together movies that showed people doing ordinary things and making extraordinary impact on those who watched.
Nashville showcases a ton of new actors back when they first started.
It also demonstrates the power and drama inherent in everyday living for a lot of folks.
Toward the beginning of the movie, there's a scene where Henry Gibson is recording a song (written by Altman) and just the opportunity to watch his eyes and see the animosity and control hidden in them as he sings is worth the price of admission...  Enjoy.",1389657600,,749,4.790697674418604

As Altman points out in the DVD, Nashville is basically a documentary revolving around several public events of various sorts, all staged by Altman and populated by Nashville residents, including crowds attracted by the offer of free food and music from various Nashville performing groups.  The actors were introduced into these events and covered by roving cameras as they carried out the activities required by the script.  Much of the dialog was ad-libbed, and every exterior and interior scene was shot in Nashville locations.  The actors portraying musicians performed music of their own composing, and the only Oscar attached to the film was for a song composed and performed by Keith Carradine.",1377907200,,867,5.215827338129497

1090115,5,6305918708,"Bowling for Movies Score: 283.125 of 300

What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the most affordable technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science (with some nacho cheese thrown in to hold it all together), I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to define the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

Nashville - 1975 - DVD

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):

Nashville is a movie about fame.  Obtaining fame, keeping fame, what happens when the spotlight fades, what some people will do to become famous.

This movie brings together so many stories it is like a Southern family reunion.  Everyone is related somehow or another, but not everyone wants to admit how.  I have to say that I was even a little put-off by how complicated everything seemed while watching the trailer, but it all came together just fine.

What I loved:

This film was like a time capsule.  As a child born in the 70's, things seemed familiar and yet, at the same time, silly as hell.  The cars, the clothes, the way everything looked.  I was transported there, and loved it.

The characters.  So many unique individuals.

I really felt like this movie captured a bit of Southern culture, the revival of country music that was happening during the 70's, like no other movie could have.

The music.  The actors were awesome singers!  We actually bought the soundtrack!

What I did NOT like:

Parts of the movie were genuinely sad.  The things that people will do to be famous are not always glamorous.

Mean people.

Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",1375574400,,2502,4.401746724890829
1090116,5,6305918708,"Directed by Robert Altman, this musical, comedy, drama has an ensemble cast made up of 24 different people. The film's story takes place over several days in Nashville, Tennessee during the political season. From the beginning we follow the politics, music, and most importantly the folks who inhabit and visit this place. They come from all backgrounds, some are in Nashville for musical careers and others for their own personal reasons. You have shaky relationships, an ill country singer, a British BBC journalist, and many other characters who are all interrelated. All their stories culminate in one tragic moment at a show. However, they all quickly move on with their lives. This film was enjoyable because there were so many different people. Even if it made the story more difficult to follow, that did not really matter. By the end everything seemed relatively cohesive. True, the conclusion is abrupt but I think that is how the story was meant to end.",1370044800,,964,4.9937888198757765
1090117,5,6305918708,"Have seen multiple times - will see multiple more.  Each character - a gem unto it's self.  The matching of actors to roles is a thing of beauty.  Entire movie circles around Barbara Jean - as the earth around the sun.  She's the beginning - she's the end.  Ronee Blakely i.e. Barbara Jean wrote all her own songs.  She recorded a little known album of her ""Nashville"" music - incredible talent.  Each character entwined in ways that are pure genius, but then again Robert Altman is a genius.  Lily Tomlin selfless/ selfish.  Ah, Keith Carradine - we've all known one.  At least one of his songs became a commercial success  For you who didn't know - everyone wrote their own songs.  Was completely taken back - they not only could sing, but could write too.  Was Opal really from the BBC?  Too many characters to write about.  In the end - Barbra Harris - sums up it all up in the only way possible...by performing ""It Don't Worry Me"".",1368835200,,936,4.455621301775148

1090123,5,6305918708,"Brash American politics, brash American music, brash, hilarious American characters....Nashville is about so many things, but it's finally about America itself in a particular time and place, disillusioned, post-Watergate, post-Vietnam, post-Hippie, yet pre-Me. It was just before Reagan's morning in America, but the whole film seems as if it were shot during one shiny afternoon on the flattest 70s film stock you've seen since an old Burt Reynolds movie. (And I mean that in the best possible way.) There are 24 major characters, and I don't know how many great country songs. (Caveat emptor: If you don't like country music, or if you think that Altman's country music isn't ""real"" country music then you won't like the movie. But I dare you not to like Ronee Blakley's ""Dues."") But if you like free-wheeling, loose, cinema-verite style movies, and a cast of characters as different and varied as those of Grand Hotel or Rules of the Game, then this is for you. I first saw it on VHS about 20 years ago and it never gets old. The costumes and hairstyles are dated, but that only adds to the charm. Watch Blakley's character near an airport runway just before fainting as an American Airlines 747 lopes by, clumsy as a fat Little League catcher-by the end you'll feel as if you'd been staring at a gaudy American flag waving in your face for 2-plus hours...and yet you won't be bored for a minute. You'll either love it or you'll hate it, but you can't ignore it. Altman's best film, along with McCabe, MASH, and The Long Goodgye. But his one takes the cake only because of its epic sweep. Enjoy!",1328486400,,1599,4.734767025089606
1090124,5,6305918708,"I enjoyed this film when it came out in the 1970s and after moving to Nashville in 2009, watched it again and liked it even more.  Info on the DVD doesn't mention the Altman commentary, which I enjoyed very much.  As mentioned by other reviewers, this is much more of a movie about the USA in the summer of 1974 than something specific about Nashville.  The only sub-plot that didn't work, I thought, was Geraldine Chaplin' characterization of the British reporter.  It's unlikely that such a ditsy individual as this would have been selected for the rather plum job of portraying an American city to the British public.  Her stroll through the junk yard is a good time to run to the refrigerator.",1326153600,,697,4.634146341463414
1090215,4,6305918708,"What many consider to be Altman's best film, you can defiantly see a lot of his tropes being deployed here. For instance, the large ensemble cast with a script that doesn't focus on anyone in particular. It would be very easy for this kind of script to fall apart, but I think Altman does a great job of juggling the characters well enough to make them all memorable. This can also be attributed to the great job each of the cast members do. They all hit the appropriate note to sell their characters as authentic. As in many of his other films, Nashville took something that appears tranquil and glamorous, and shows it for the nasty lie it is. Altman did this with relationships and family in Shortcuts, he did it with the film industry in The Player, and he does it with the music industry here. No one is clean (except perhaps Mr. Green), but everyone has their redeeming qualities. Finally, the politics in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen. No one party is shown as particularly good or bad, and while it does play a major role, I wouldn't say people's political leanings define them. I entered this film expecting a politically charged movie about country music (not my favorite category), and what I got was a smart, funny, thought provoking experience.",1323561600,2,1274,4.592105263157895
1090216,5,6305918708,"I've loved ""Nashville"" ever since I saw it for the first time when it originally came out.  I agree with all the positive reviews I've seen here, though I think all or most leave out one element that I've always thought was key to this movie -- it's not really about country music or Nashville.  It's about our whole nation and the ""music of the Country.""  Ironically, I've seen in several reviews comparisons with ""Crash,"" another movie the topic of which is not what's on the surface.  With ""Crash,"" the topic isn't prejudice, it's how everything we do has ripples of influence, on and on, in ways we can never foresee.  Prejudice is simply the vehicle by which this message is presented.  With ""Nashville,"" the music scene is simply the vehicle by which Altman gives us a microcosm of the US before, during and shortly after the Vietnam War.  Yes, the Ronee Blakely character harks back to Loretta Lynn, but she's also John F. Kennedy.  And that unknown girl who ends up singing so well at the end is Lyndon Johnson, thrust on stage to keep things a-goin'.  What did the camera pan over while she sang about how ""it don't worry"" her?  Children, children, children, none of whom will have memory of Kennedy, Vietnam, or the era ending before their eyes.  There are other parallels -- for example the sweet, sincere soldier who can forsee the danger to Blakely/Kennedy but can't prevent it, suggesting a military weakened by Vietnam and foreshadowing upcoming threats that may not respond to military solutions.  ""Nashville"" isn't a satire, as one review suggested, it's an alegory and a beautifully rendered one at that.",1319328000,2,1622,4.774193548387097
1090217,3,6305918708,"Twenty-four people collide and interact during five hectic days of music, fame and fortune and bad behaviour in Nasville's country music scene.

Robert Altman had a long and busy Hollywood career in movies and TV, but the films he made entirely his own are few in number.  Nashville is one of his most distinctive offerings, a movie over which he had complete creative control.  Don't expect a plot, don't expect character development, the conversation is desultory, much of the music is dreadful.

So why is this movie so beguiling?  Altman was at the height of his power, Nashville is a work of great confidence and conviction.  Characters walk in and out of frame in a bewildering array but there's a unity that emerges.  There's irony here in spades and Altman makes no distinction between straight and comic moments.  The viewer is left to decide which bits are comedy.

Since those planes flew into those buildings the American people seem to have lost what little sense of irony they ever had.  Nashville stands as a rare moment, America smiling gently at its own shortcomings.  A warm and affectionate snapshot of the silliness of the 70s.",1314748800,,1147,4.860824742268041
1090218,5,6305918708,"I've been a Robert Altman fan for ages, and I've always wanted to see Nashville. I recently re-watched M*A*S*H and Altman has been on my mind, so I was happy to come across Nashville at the local library recently. Score!

The film starts off in that confusing Altman way, but you quickly get a sense of who the characters are, and want to re-watch the opening scenes to figure out what he was telling us about his characters from the beginning. The film is a mini-documentary as we get to watch the performance of several songs in full, and we learn a little bit about music production. In the early scenes we see all the characters, even though we don't know who they are. Most noticable is Shelly Duvall, a girl with wild socks, long legs, some sort of bikini, and red and yellow shoes (kind of like Roller Girl?). From the airport at the beginning of the movie we move out on cars, see those great VW beetles, Cadillacs and a crazy chopper three-wheeler (with Jeff Goldblum riding), and a great pile-up on the freeway (with a resulting pick-up party, beer and all). There's the nutty campaign of Hal Phillip Walker, who wants to change the national anthem, cancel the electoral college and ban lawyers from office. There's Lily Tomlin, young and stunning as a white gospel singer and a devoted mother of two deaf kids (there's a great scene of her listening patiently to one of them telling a nice story about a day at the pool) and another lonely soul; Elliott Gould and Julie Christie drift through, playing themselves, and Karen Black plays the role of the pretender stage star Connie White (Black was also in Rob Zombie's ""House of 1,000 Corpses""). The real star is Ronnee Blakley, a raven-haired Loretta Lynn type who has a gorgeous voice and has several great acting scenes, but who loses her marbles onstage after two really amazing numbers. ""All my luxury has turned into misery."" Superb! Also very good and raven-haired is the strictly beautiful Cristina Rines, who plays the ""Mary"" of the country group Bill, Mary and Tom (clearly modeled on Peter, Paul and Mary). Tom is the playboy, whose game is not understood until late in the film (great scene when he debuts a new song and four women in the audience each clearly thinks it's about her). Great stuff. Geraldine Chaplain is also great as Opal, a woman who may or may not be a BBC reporter trying to put together a documentary about Nashville of that year, but only succeeds in putting together some rubbish in a school bus parking lot, and in a junkyard. It's all very absurd.

Besides the great storyline, Altman gives us a wonderful look into what country music and Nashville was all about in 1975. We get lots of great audience shots, and anyone who pays attention can see lots of interesting things going on. In the commentary, you get an explanation of the composite album that is in the opening credits. He introduces Thomas Howell Phillips, a writer/novelist from Mississippi whose whole family was in politics, and he did a 30-minute speech for Hal Phillip Walker, the politician whose speaker truck is driving through Nashville at the time. He introduces Richard Baskin, the music genius there who put it all together. Notes the funny names that music industry people had for themselves, like Frog, Trout, Bear. Used local musicians and announcers. It was Jeff Goldblum's second movie and he talks about bringing him in. Notes the rifles that the Tennessee Twirlers use. Originally cast Susan Ansbach as Barbara Jean, but they couldn't afford her. Had already bought two songs form Ronnee Blakely, so they made her Barbara Jean. For the four-car pullout scene, he says ""We cast these cars as carefully as the people who drove them."" Joan Tewkesbury, who wrote the script (whatever of it that was used) experienced the highway pile-up party herself when she arrived in Nashville to prepare the script. The film was shot in six weeks, no time to do a wardrobe test, so the actors mainly wore what they had, some things were swapped between actors. Created situations and let the actors go with them. Most people didn't know that the mic was on them. Met the actor who played Barnett, Allen Garfield, with Francis Ford Coppola in Cannes after they had done ""The Conversation"", told him to bring exactly what he was wearing that day. Barbara Harris was neurotic about her early pile-up scenes, wanted to buy them off of Altman and destroy them. Shooting in the Grand Ole Opry happened over two days, on the second Nixon resigned. ""Go get a go go - it's good!""  Gary Busey was supposed to play the part of Tom (from Bill, Mary and Tom), but had another commitment come up, he wrote the song that the trio sing ""Since You've Gone"". All of the actors sing their own songs, whether they are good or not (or whether they can sing well or not - Alman didn't like the singing of Timothy Brown or the scrumptuous Cristina Raines). Geraldine Chaplain (who is the daughter of Charlie Chaplin and the granddaughter of Eugene O'Neill, by the way) is hysterical nearly every time she opens her mouth, including ""I make it a point never to gossip with the servants."" Shelly Duvall smiles at ""I'm Easy"" (she's supposed to be).",1314316800,2,5184,4.688254665203074

And yet,Viacom still has not given this the deluxe treatment. Maybe in the blu-ray era,but probably not because they just don't know what they have here and the money is probably not in it for them. A shame. As TV screens come close to the movie experience in size and sound,this is the kind of movie made for home viewing. Repeated home viewing. Revisiting certain parts or following certain characters more carefully than last viewing.

So very many wonderful reviews and starring one of my very favorite actors, Keith Caradine...how could I have missed seeing this??

Better question..... sigh.....how could I go so wrong?

One reviewer even called it a ""masterpiece"". Well, it's a piece, alright, but not one I can actually name in public without washing out my mouth. Sheesh! This movie stinks.

I watched disappointedly through over an hour and 15 minutes of the dreadful thing, alternately praying it would get better and begging God to kill me. Even ""the big one"" striking me down sounded preferable! ( and yes, I've had a previous heart-attack! ) I was too stubborn to quit, though, as I just kept telling myself ""It just has to get better. It can't get any worse!"". Besides...I paid 9.98 for this DVD!!! Quitting would make me like those people who start books, only to never finish them!

Sadly, it did get worse. Or maybe I just finally crossed some inner trash tolerance level. But then suddenly I had a reprieve! Perhaps God thought he would teach me a lesson about praying for nonsense, or maybe He simply has a wicked sense of humor, as the movie began mysteriously to repeat the same scene over and over again, one with Carradine in bed with some half naked chick. ( but thank God, not clownish Shelley Duvall!) I must be old, though, as no matter how round and cute the young Keith Carradine's nude behind is, I don't really want to see it more than once.

At first I was confused, thinking it was just a bad movie plot device, the repeating of the same scene, but then saw the timer on my DVD player was just going forwards, then backwards, and then repeating the process, so the DVD itself was faulty. I tried cleaning the disk ( but not too diligently, as I was afraid I might then feel obligated to actually finish watching the movie ) and tried fast forwarding, etc., but nothing worked. The DVD kept getting stuck on the same scene and repeating it. Doesn't matter which scene in the movie, however, as all of them are bad. Truly, truly, bad.

Bad music, bad writing, bad acting, ( Yes! Even Keith was bad!! ) bad scenes, bad directing, and no discernable plot whatever.

A friend told me she just loved this movie and since she had a copy, insisted I come over and watch it ALL THE WAY THROUGH with her this time, and swore I just didn't ""get a good idea of the plot and the characters"" the first time I watched half of it. Now that I've sat through the entire movie, and wasted more of my time, all I can say is ""What plot?"" As for the characters, they were just as dumb and boring the second time around. It was still slop so I stick by my earlier opinion, all of it, regardless of the number of people who keep voting my review negatively as ""not helpful"". I guess most of them had already seen it and weren't worried about me helping others decide whether or not to purchase this DVD, which is the point of reviewing a product.

Real life, nice guy Gibson must have started his new roles of `pompous creeps' beginning with this film.  As the egotistical Haven Hamilton (complete with blinding white Elvis pantsuits, horrible toupee, oily mannerisms, and short-tempered retorts `shut UP, Pearl') was classic - and of course he's got that smooth, southern drawl down to a fine art.  Nice to see one of his original poems `Keep-A-Goin' made into a song.  Personally I thought Pearl, his jaded girlfriend, looked a wee bit too old for him but hey, I didn't do the casting. Lily was fab as always - somewhat confusing as a lead singer of a gospel group, but probably the most likable of the bunch.  Loved Shelley Duvall, Jeff Goldblum and Geraldine Chaplin as well.

1090436,5,6305918708,"Robert Altman's 1975 classic ""Nashville"" stands the test of time and along with ""Mash,"" has to be one of the best films he ever directed. In an interview that accompanies the DVD, Mr. Altman says that there is a total of 24 characters whom he follows throughout this fine movie that looks at the connection between conservative politics and country music. Hal Philip Walker is running for president as a candidate of the Replacement Party. He would take away subsidies for farmers, change the National Anthem, tax churches and remove lawyers from Congress. His campaign personnel are planning a huge rally in downtown Nashville where country singing star Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley) --is she based on Loretta Lynn?-- will sing for him. This patchwork quilt of a movie is held together in part by the character Opal from the BBC (Geraldine Page) who has come to Nashville to observe the local fauna up close and is sillier than anyone she interviews as she flits from one country singer to another. Yellow school-buses, for instance, remind her of yellow dragons, etc., etc., etc. Lily Tomlin plays a housewife who sings in an African American church choir, is married to Ned Beatty and has a one night affair with Keith Carradine, a rock singer and womanizer who sleeps with every woman in sight. Karen Black plays a character not unlike the one she played in ""Five Easy Pieces."" Elliott Gould and Julie Christie make cameo appearances playing themselves. According to Altman, they were just passing through Nashville so he put them in movie, a little like making gumbo I suppose. Surely the character Tommy Brown is based on Country Charlie Pride.

Altman usually does an ensemble piece well; this one is no exception as there are no bad performances here although Lily Tomlin, Ronee Blakley, Shelly Duvall, Geraldine Page, Henry Gibson, Karen Black and Keith Carradine are outstanding. That this film was and still is topical goes without saying. Nashville has often been in bed with conservative politicians. I remember seeing Loretta Lynn on the Larry King Show  supporting the current president just before the 2000 election. And I suspect that more Americans can name more Grand Ole Opry stars than those of the Metropolitan Opera.

The characters in ""Nashville"" apparently wrote most of the music they sing in the movie; and it is very, very good. Some of the songs are much better than what comes out of Nashville.

Overall, what crappy singing for a movie about Music City! While country music generally isn't all that intellectually profound or politically astute, its stars (especially in the 60s and 70s before it went down the cartoon cookie-cutter toilet), were musically talented and believed in what they were singing. Henry Gibson, Lily Tomlin, and Karen Black together couldn't carry a tune in a bucket if all three were holding on to it for dear life! Ronee Blakely does do a credible job as a singer and her character at least approaches believability as a tragic country ingenue, but as for the rest of them, come on! I wonder how many of the 5 star reviewers heaping praise on this film actually come from the south or grew up on country music? Merle Haggard, George Jones, Willie and Waylon, Tom T. Hall, Hank Jr, Kenny Rogers, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton and many others were at or near the top of their game in '75 and a lot of their songs are musically worthwhile, whatever one may think of the lyrics or perspective. This film plays like an uninitiated outsider's simplistic, if fairly lighthanded, take on what makes middle America tick. I actually find a lot of Altman's work to be somewhat overrated and what some call genius, I tend to see as rudderless wandering in need of a spirited editor.

In all fairness to the late director though, other Nashville reviewers are correct when they point out that the laid back sensibilties of the 70s are lamentably long gone in this often nightmarishly visceral 21st century world of ours. As such, the fact that this film has not aged well is not altogether Altman's fault; I think that the attention span of the average moviegoer 30+ years ago was probably much better suited to a meandering film like this. Ultimately, it's really the bad country music that I reject more than anything. All in all, I don't regret having watched Nashville, I just can't help but question the glowing praise that smacks of dreamy courtesans in the midst of the emperor's new clothes...",1178064000,18,2286,4.743718592964824
1090442,4,6305918708,"The late Robert Altman was the past master of weaving a simple plot line and existential characters in order to form very interesting slices of the life in the American experience, with a wry sense of humor about that experience to boot. Shortly before his death he had produced Prairie Home Companion, essentially a Midwestern version of the presently reviewed film Nashville. He had an ear and an eye for the sometimes absurd characters who are part of the American landscape and those senses do not fail him here, although there is just a touch of datedness in the story line of the film.

Of course, the subject here, given away by the title, is a look at country music, as least how it looked in 1975, intertwined with a indeterminate but assumingly populist presidential campaign by a third party candidate. The mix of politics and music is an interesting choice although whether the electoral campaign could stand in for that of ex-Alabama Governor George Wallace on the right or an insurgent Eugene McCarthy-type campaign on the left is far from clear, probably purposefully so. All the characters one would expect when one's only sense of the Nashville country music scene is the Grand Old Opry are here; the mainstream male and female country singers modeled on George Jones and Loretta Lynn; the country folk `crashers' trying to cash in on the popularity of genre; the wannabes working the open mikes off the main street in order to get a break; and, the truly talentless all striving to get ahead in the dog eat dog but lucrative world of country music. All looking for the main chance. All driven to be on a stage somewhere in front of some audience even if that of an eccentric presidential candidate. The sub-plot, which in the end holds the action together, is the random violence afoot then, as now, that is seemingly an endemic part of the American Way.

There are several outstanding musical performances highlighted by the film's Loretta Lynn character, Ronee Blaklee. Her rendition of Dues still sounds good after over 30years. Try to find her work.  The late Vassar Clements on the fiddle also should receive kudos.",1176768000,,2138,4.820163487738419
1090443,5,6305918708,"NASHVILLE is a film you have to see to believe.  Director Robert Altman weaves together the lives of 24 people, during five days at a music festival that coincides with the presidential campaign of a mysterious candidate.  The film is as much social commentary as it is a tribute to the culture of country music.  It is, both, dramatically compelling and darkly comedic, with plenty of curveballs thrown into the mix.  NASHVILLE is an all star cast of too many names for me to mention, here, but that isn't what makes it so good.  It is an example of storytelling, at its best......",1176163200,,582,4.611650485436893
1090474,5,6305918708,"Since Altman's recent death at age 81 from leukemia, I've wanted to revisit my tied-for-favorite film by him - Nashville (McCabe is the other) - and finally found it through interlibrary loan. Not only did this 2 hour & 20 minute tour de force stand the test of time, but it's equally as true today as when it was shot in 1975.

Filmed in the city that is home to the Grand Ole Opry, it is really a metaphor for America, woven through with wonderful music, much of it composed by its galaxy of stars. Altman has his favorites whom he rewards by allowing them to improvise and to appear in his 39-film repertoir.

One striking theme (of many) is the lack of communication between people. Important stories need to be told but are rudely interrupted or neglected by people who should be listening. Poor ole Keenan Wynn's wife is dying but he has no one to tell. This narcissism, a classic symptom of our times and exemplified today by the explosion of personal blogs where we bare our souls to strangers (have we no friends to listen to us?) is exemplified at every point where someone tries to communicate deep feelings.

Lily Tomlin is marvelous. As the mother of two lovely young deaf children, she portrays a complex character looking for human connection. She lovingly 'signs' to her children and belts out her feelings in, of all places, a black gospel choir. Her marriage to the goodhearted but snakeoily salesman Ned Beatty is all the odder because he hasn't learned 'sign language' to speak to their children. What kind of dad is that?

Beatty, like the other characters in the film, adores celebrities. The ridiculous adoration of celebrity icons is another theme. A Loretta Lynn-style country singer is idolized from afar. As massively talented as she is mentally fragile, she is mishandled by everyone, including her husband. In a beautiful yet ultimately foolish scene, Beatty says to a pathetic potential songstress with no talent, ""I just want to kiss you all over.""

Well, gosh, Ned, why don't you just pay attention to your own beautiful wife who has to go elsewhere for affection, and your own 2 beautiful children who need a real dad.

This film grew out of the Sixties Era where the word ""phony"" became a national battlecry. ""Nashville"" is full of phonies. As the Beatles sing, ""Nothing is real."" Nothing is as it seems.

Wonderful use of foreshadowing keeps us guessing what will happen to all 24 (!) characters who are gloriously gathered together in Nashville's ""Parthenon"" at the end of the film. Although it's a lengthy film, it never falters, it is sure of itself and we are in the palm of Altman's hand through the shattering climax, complete with backdrop of American flag. This is America, through the unforgettable lens of Robert Altman.",1174003200,2,2765,4.759916492693111
1090475,3,6305918708,"The recent film ""Crash"" repopend my appetite to see ""Nashville"" again.

I saw this film back in the 1970s when it was first released in theaters.  The theater experience was all-absorbent.  It was a film that captured the environment and mood we, who grew up in the sixties, were still feeling.  A true work of art, the film was panoramic Altman at the time.

A film festival of Robert Altman films was recently held in our neigborhood in honor of the film maker's recent demise.  When we heard ""Nashville""  was being shown, we marked the date hoping to recapture that first experince.  Bad weather stopped us from leaving the comfort of our homes and we could not attend the special showing.

Dissillusioned at being unable to attend, we attempted to rent it from Blockbuster.  No Blockbuster stocked it.  Since we both were left with a hunger to once again see the film, we decided to buy the DVD form Amazon.com.

Unfortunately, viewing it on DVD from our suburban livingroom in February of 2007, ""Nashvile"" becomes a tedious non-experience.  Time has worn away the sponge absorbency that this film once held. It trudges at such a slow pace that you get up to get snacks without worry of missing any part of it.  I guess we watched it in its entirety only because we paid for it.

That being said, I do feel a certain loyalty to its premise.

Despite lack of punch and turtle sloth of events that interlace the lives of a variety of central characters, the social & political issues conveyed do parrallel today's issues.  Assasination, political manipulation, marital infidelity and unrequited love are everpresent. In that sense Nashbville is a Homeric poem mirroring the human condition regardless of decade and place.  Our current world, however is sharply harder, more colorful, violently cutting  and commercially perverse than Altman's seventies depiction.  Those were good old innocent days in comparison.

In 2007 retrospect, the film deserves three stars for its nostalgic sense--which unfortunately, time has faded visually and intellectually for younger viewers.  Our daughter got up never to return after only 5 minutes.  Artistaclly, the film portrays boomer world-changing sensibility that lingered upon its release. Not appealing to today's audience.  It does not satisfy the nostalgic either.

Notabley,  this film--made years before John Lennon's assasination, has a premonitory quality in one of its many subplots that follows a stalker who guns down an idolized female country singer mid-song in front of her audience.  This ties a personal observational knot that connects beyond JFK, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther KIng assasinations.

Aside from that, for us, the origianl art of this film has been killed by the passage of time.  ""Crash,"" which whet our appetite for a review of ""Nashville,"" turns out a better incarnation of ""Nashville's"" sensibilities. Movies that capture the diversity of the human experience and how we view and judge each other are few and far between.  It is evident that every generation must narrate this experience through its own images.  With no disrespect intended toward the departed, Mr. Altman, this film is no longer worth the 3 hours sitting.",1173571200,5,3204,5.080459770114943
1090476,5,6305918708,"Robert Altman's ""Nashville"" is one of the strangest masterpieces I've ever seen. Most ""great films"" are about something, they have a plot that you can give a synopsis (or possibly even an explanation) of. Having just watched ""Nashville"" I can certainly give you a synopsis of it, but I don't think I'd be able to tell you what it's about. It's almost like a documentary, certainly it has more characters than the average film (24 lead roles if I remember correctly). Anyone familiar with Altman's work knows how skilled he was working with an ensemble cast and I don't think this material would've worked in any other director's hand. What other director could have 24 speaking roles and make it flow so perfectly. Not a single scene in the film seems forced or pointless. As I said, telling you what the movie is about is going to be hard. I guess I'll stick to naming a few characters and explaining them. The movie takes place, obviously, in Nashville over a 5-day period. We meet a gospel singer Linnea (Lily Tomlin), with two deaf children who's married to a man named Del (Ned Beatty). There's a womanizing rock singer named Tom (Keith Carradine, who won an Oscar for the song ""I'm Easy"") in love with Linnea. He frequently calls her house, only to have her hang up on him. When she finally agrees to attend a gig he's playing and he plays the song ""I'm Easy"" it's one of the most touching scenes I've ever seen in a film. Then there's the famous country singer Barbara Jean, recently burned in a fire, who tries to return to performing only to have a nervous breakdown. Everywhere Barbara Jean goes there's a young soldier (Scott Glenn), whose mother saved Barbara Jean from the fire and has now vowed to watch over her. There's L.A. Joan (Shelley DuVall), who lives with her uncle while her aunt sits dying in the hospital. There's a young drifter, who is potentially dangerous, who moves in with her uncle. There's a politician named Hal Phillip Walker (never seen on-screen), who provides commentary throughout the film from a van. He's running for president and the climax of the film occurs where he's set to give a speech. There's a young woman named Sueleen, who desperately wants to be a singer but can't sing and finally finds a friend honest enough to tell her. There's Opal (Geraldine Chaplin), the BBC reporter doing a documentary on musicians in Nashville. There's, obviously, a lot more characters as well but these are some of the more memorable ones. ""Nashville"" can fall into the category of musical; there's a lot of music in it. I'm not fond of musicals and I'm really not fond of country music. Since the actors in the film wrote and sing the songs they perform in the movie and none of them have particularly strong singing voices; I was surprised that I liked this film. Just imagine telling someone there's a 2 hour and 40 minute movie with a lot of country singing, done by bad singers. Doesn't sound like a good film. And it's not a good film. It's a great film and it's one of Robert Altman's best (hard to say though really, with such classics as ""M*A*S*H"" and ""The Player"" and ""Short Cuts""). Even if ""Nashville"" doesn't sound like the kind of movie you'd enjoy, I urge you to give it a chance. You might find yourself surprised by how much you like it.

1090480,3,6305918708,"Though I'm often okay with movies that take a ""get out of them what you will"" approach, when such a movie pushes past two and a half hours, I usually lose a little patience.  In other words, if a director asks me to spend that much time with a movie, then I want a clear idea of the director's intention. I'm sorry, but that's just me.  Because of this, I can't throw endless bouquets at ""Nashville"".  At least not after one viewing.

After that one viewing (yeah, yeah, I know-- forty lashes with a wet noodle for taking this long to see the thing), I do think ""Nashville"" is an interesting film, with much to recommend it.  For example, the music is great and the subtlety of the performances is amazing.  But on that last point, the performances are SO subtle that it's difficult to get any idea about what the director wants us to feel about these characters, and to see what points he is trying to make about them.  Am I lazy and want to be spoon fed?  I don't think so, but I don't like to be totally at sea, either.

Happily, in the brief Robert Altman interview that's included on the DVD, I was happy to learn that I'm not simply someone who ""just didn't get it"".  In that interview, Mr. Altman essentially says that there was no grand plan for the film, that he just wanted to throw a bunch of scenes at us that would collectively paint a picture of life in the Nashville music circuit, because all that stuff was lively and interesting to him.  Nothing more than that.  Also according to the interview, elements such as the big traffic jam and the offbeat political campaign weren't big statements or complicated metaphors for anything.  The crash was included because one of the director's researchers was involved in a similar traffic jam when visiting the city and thought such an event would play well onscreen, and the political campaign platform was crafted when the director asked his writer to just come up with some political positions that would sound interesting during the campaign scenes.  Again, nothing more complicated than that.

I'm not trying to debunk the critics who are calling this film a masterwork.  I'm just saying that you shouldn't feel bad or stupid if, after watching this, you wonder what all the shouting is about.  In the end, ""Nashville"" is just a big ensemble piece that you may like a lot or (like me) might feel is a little long for a free form piece with no real intention.

I'll probably get a ton of ""not helpful"" votes from Robert Altman fans reading this review, but what I'm really trying to do is help viewers enjoy the film MORE.  Perhaps by warning you folks who haven't yet seen the movie that you're not going to get a big statement or clear point of view or easily identifiable lesson from ""Nashville"", maybe you'll just relax and enjoy the performances and flavor of the film and not worry about those things.  And, you know what?  Maybe, if you just let the movie wash over you, you WILL find some of those things when it's all over.  Being a fan of ""Gosford Park"", ""The Player"", and other Robert Altman classics, I know I'm going to take that approach and give ""Nashville"" another try in the near future.

But even now I can say that the film is at least worth a look.  After all, is there a Robert Altman film out there that isn't worth at least that?",1164672000,12,3315,4.46843853820598

Henry was approached,by Altman, to star in this ,after several others backed out. When it tries to be serious,i find myself laughing or confused. Tomlin does play a very serious part,as the mother of a deaf child. And she played the somber role well,so don't expect any laughs. All the good actors/actresses,in this comic-farce/tradgey ,are wrong for the roles.

Altman combined several insular narratives (including a mute Jeff Goldblum) to cover the rich, the poor, the desperate and the hopefully delusional that is one of the more accurate portrayals of American society in Hollywood history.

1090570,5,6305918708,"Robert Altman's NASHVILLE (1975) is one of my personal favorite films of the 1970's golden age.  I played it a few nights ago on letterboxed DVD with English subtitles so that I could sing along with songs that I cannot get out of my head days later:  Keith Carradine's Oscar-winning I'M EASY, Barbara Harris' IT DON'T WORRY ME, Henry Gibson's amazing renditions of ""200 YEARS"" and ""FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHILDREN"" (who knew the crazy little guy from TV's ""LAUGH-IN"" could sing so well?), and Ronee Blakley's soaring ""ONE, I LOVE YOU"" and ""MY IDAHO HOME"".  In many cases the actors also did the music and lyrics to their songs and were professional enough singers to perform on Nashville entertainment stages in front of packed crowds of professional extras and Nashville residents.

Shot entirely on location, NASHVILLE netted Altman Oscars for both producer and director for a 160 minute movie that flows like velvet, moves quickly, and seems to have directed itself.  Altman must have worked hard to make it all seem effortless.  The movie covers one weekend and has 24 main characters, including Oscar nominee Lily Tomlin, who is married to Ned Beatty but having an affair with womanizer songwriter Carradine, who is sleeping with half the women in the cast.  Keenan Wynn is a resident whose wife is in the hospital; Shelley Duvall is his hippie daughter.  Allen Garfield is hyper business manager to singer Blakley, who is in the hospital for exhaustion caused by Garfield's temper and over-booking his client.  Harris is on the fringes of success and proves her worth in the powerful closing concert scene.  Michael Murphy is campaign manager for a fake independent Presidential candidate.  He is working with Beatty on a fund-raiser with a sweet, but no-talent Gwen Welles, who realizes too late that people only love her as a stripper.  Jeff Goldblum, Karen Black, Barbara Baxley, Christina Raines, and Bert Remsen are also in the cast; and Altman's stars Julie Christie and Elliott Gould have cameos as themselves.  And Geraldine Chaplin is a reporter with the BBC in London.

NASHVILLE doesn't really have a plot, just fascinating character interaction and songs over one weekend.  It starts with a freeway pile-up, climaxes with an exuberant performance by cast members and professional musicians at the Grand Ole Opry on Saturday night (while at least two other events are also happening with our cast), and ends with an act of violence that somehow seems in keeping with Altman's other films when you examine them one by one.  If this is not his crowning achievement, with its beautiful Panavision photography and complex overlapping eight-track stereo sound, the movie is certainly in the top five.  It is a stupendous cinematic achievement by a filmmaker who is still going strong more than three decades later at age 81 with not one, but two new movies coming out.  Altman won an Honorary Oscar the same week I am writing this review.  He told one billion live television viewers that he wants to keep making movies for forty more years because he had a young person's heart transplant a while back and is brimming with ideas.

1090571,4,6305918708,"After hearing the raves about ""Nashville"" when it was released, I'm surprized I hadn't seen it until last week.  I'm still trying to decide what to think of it.  I've pretty well decided that this is NOT a great movie.  Indeed, I came away thinking that Robert Altman didn't understand his subject matter.  To me, the talent in Nashville is of a better quality for the entertainment medium it serves than is the talent in Hollywood for the medium it serves.  What could better underscore that than having actors plays musicians.  Some were better than others.  However, listening to Lily Tomlin's failed attempt at singing in her (thankfully) brief solo made me wonder why that didn't end up on the cutting floor.  The Black Gospel chorus backing her made it all the more ridiculous.  If Altman thought he was making a point about the unfairness of fame by showing us that scene, he missed a major truism of Country Music; when it's good, it's great and when it's bad, it's funny.  There wasn't anything to be gained from Tomlin's misguided collapse into song.  On the other hand, Keith Carradine did a pretty fair job with his efforts.

The plot of ""Nashville"" is easy to follow if you're not looking for one and hard to follow if you are.  The various characters weave in and out during a weekend leading up to a concert at a political rally.  Most of the characters are everyday people or lesser players in the Country Music world.  We get a load of reminders that ""nobody's perfect"".  The comings and goings of some of these people is like something out of, well, a Country Music Song (for lack of a better example).  Nobody doubts that the business side of Nashville isn't going to stand up to our naive expectations but we end up seeing too much of this to serve any real purpose.

The movie suffers somewhat by having too many stars in it.  There's a scene where Elliot Gould plays Elliot Gould....why?  There's a character played by Shelley Duvall whose only purpose seems to be to make us more sympathetic towards her father (poor guy).  There's a nameless character, played by Jeff Goldblum, who only purpose is to appear on screen from time to time.  All these and plenty of others serve to tell so many stories within a story that we seem to miss whatever big picture that there is.  The movie's ending is all Hollywood and no Nashville.

I gave this movie a ""4 Star"" rating because, with so many scenes and characters, some turned out to be fairly interesting (although not necessarily for any reason in particular).  There were a lot of Oscar nominations for the cast although I didn't really feel that there were any outstanding performances.  I though Keenan Wynn's was as good as any.

Altman presents America in a nuanced way - its dreams (the waitress who can't sing who dreams of a career at the Opry, Lily Tomlin as the mother of deaf children) and its nightmares (political assasination, a tendency to seek a populist on a white horse).

For the most part, with a few rare exceptions, actors can't sing and singers can't act.  But that doesn't stop them from trying.

1090671,3,6305918708,"There are some beautiful things to contemplate in Altman's Nashville, but it makes me sad to see customer reviews that this is a ""masterpiece"" and a ""great American film.""  It is hardly that.  Its message is deeply cynical and mocking.  Altman obviously only had a surface image of the music world of Nashville -- that he gets his actors to write the songs shows that totally.  Not that they're such bad songs but they are NOT real Nashville songs.

Over and over again in the film characters are mocked for their sincerity and beliefs.  Geraldine Chaplin as the BBC interviewer I think actually represents Altman's attitude to all this, though I think she more accurately stands for a Hollywood outsider's view.

The ending, with the crowds mindlessly singing, ""you may say that I ain't free, but it don't worry me,"" I find sickening and depressing -- and not profound at all.

The few characters that transcend the depressing atmosphere, like Lily Tomlin, are the bright spots that give me some hope.  You can learn from watching this film, but you have to see beyond what Altman gives us to do that.  It's not how well something is photographed or how well the actors act that make a film great, it's what it tells us about ourselves.  This just tells us how screwed up we are, and I think we already know that.  What Nashville doesn't tell us -- and to be great art we need this -- is what we can do about it.",1131408000,13,1413,4.519685039370079
1090672,5,6305918708,"GRAND HOTEL meets the Grand Ol' Opry. The setting is Nashville (obviously) during a political rally, and 24 characters are drawn together and their lives depicted over the course of a weekend. Some of the characters are country singers - established, on the way up, and on the way down; some characters are their fans; and other characters are connected with the political rally. An interweaving plot thread involves Ned Beatty, in charge of the rally, as he tries to persuade the singers to attend. The rally culminates in a shooting of one of the singers by a madman in the audience.

Robert Altman directed this highly acclaimed movie. It's all about greed and lechery and false illusions - and a score of other faults that inflict the human race. Altman does a magnificent job in creating these character vignettes and then bringing them all together at the rally. The vignettes are presented in a mixed-up way (which is why I compare it to GRAND HOTEL), and the movie seems like it's going in a hundred different directions, but Altman pulls it all together brilliantly. Much of the dialogue was improvised and many of the songs were composed and sung by the actors themselves (Keith Carradine's ""I'm Easy"" was the standout). There is so much going on in the movie that you can watch it a dozen times and see something ""new"" each time. Definitely worth a watch, and then some.",1130889600,2,1381,4.730290456431535
1090673,5,6305918708,"Quintessential '70s film that, if anything, resonates more now than at the time of its release. Rather than subsuming his characters in an ordinary, linear story, director Altman weaves a quilt from their interactions (much as he did in 1970's MASH). The fact that there are practically no lead actors in the cast (certainly no major stars, excepting Elliott Gould and Julie Christie in cameos) adds to its vrit. Joan Tewksbury's script offers trenchant observations on many American idioms; politics, nuclear families, the music industry, fame and violence are among the myriad topics touched on. The result is a provocative, sui generis masterpiece.

The DVD is nicely fleshed out with extras. Altman's commentary features his typically caustic wit and is quite informative and reflective (his last comment insipred the title of this review). He is also interviewed for a decent featurette.",1125619200,,892,5.326241134751773
1090674,5,6305918708,"Nashville is not a film that will likely appeal to everyone. It is over two and a half hours long with over an hour of country music numbers and a cast featuring 24 LEAD roles. The film is chaotic and muffled and difficult to follow. It is also the best example of political satire since Dr. Strangelove.

It's difficult to explain just how this movie works. It's a portrait of various people (mostly musicians) in all walks of life. The anchor of the film is the primary bicentennial election. A political rally for ""Replacement Party"" candidate Hal Philip Walker is about to be held at Nashville's replica Parthenon. A van travels around the city blasting his speeches about what's wrong with the government. His views, for the most part, are right on the dot, but we see through his representatives and spokespersons that he is just as brutal and corrupt as any politician.

We never actually see the man, or find out much about his politics, past his views on the smells of Christmas.

Robert Altman, best known for Korean War comedy M*A*S*H, does a superb job combining Hollywood craftmanship with an independent edge. Nashville is highly stylized while brutally honest. The music is more than just a backdrop to the plot, it is part of the plot. For example, there is a scene in which Keith Carradine performs a song called ""I'm Easy"" in a bar. He says he wrote it for someone who just might be here tonight. Four different girls in the audience beam with the knowledge he wrote it for her.

Keith Carradine's character is the most obvious example of a sexist in the picture, but sexism is one of the resounding motifs throughout the film. It explores the subtlety of the concept. Women in the film are appreciated for their looks or their talent but never for themselves. Such is the case during a scene when singer Barbara Jean (Ronnie Blakley) is in a hospital bed after collapsing. Half a dozen of her closest friends come in, talk to each other for about 3 minutes, then leave. Later her husband/manager tells her, ""Don't tell me how to run your life."" She realizes her only friends are her fans so during her next conert she compulsively makes small talk when she should be singing.

The film is basically a great opening, an astounding ending, and tons of filler in between, but that filler is some of the most interesting filmmaking ever seen. This film provides no clear answers because that would just be more politics. This film could've been a train crash in the hands of any other director. It's chaotic and probably over a lot of heads, but ""It Don't Worry Me.""

1090675,4,6305918708,"Beneath it's sequined veneer, Robert Altman's Nashville recalls the director's acknowledged hero Jean Renoir and his 1939 masterwork The Rules of the Game. Like Rules, Nashville observes a society engulfed in its own pretensions and tells a cautionary tale that would later prove tragically prophetic (Rules was released on the eve of the German invasion; Nashville would predate John Lennon's assassination by 5-years). But it's the characters themselves that are most informed by the forbearance. There are more than a few strains of similarity between Henry Gibson's Haven Hamilton, for example, and Marcel Dalio's Robert de la Chesnay. Notice how Haven delivers the cloying ballad ""For the Sake of the Children"" to the Grand Ole Opry audience and compare to Chesnay's proud and self-conscious display of his latest calliope. Barbara Jean closely recalls Christine; a tortured starlet who grows exasperated amongst a throng of admirers. Likewise, Scott Glenn's marine approximates Andr Jurieu and his pathetic single-minded devotion. Most notably, the running social commentary blaring from the omni-present presidential campaign van is a uniquely 70s Americana update to Octave, Renoir's own character who provides the ""moral voice"" in The Rules of the Game.

However, if the characters and plot points strike a similarity, the stylistic footprint left by each director could not be more different. Renoir's work is insular, meticulous and choreographed, whereas Altman's is expansive and consciously undisciplined. This allows for some moments of unsanitized satirical magic; witness the pom-pom rifle brigade at the airport or the giggling audience members at the Opry, but it also exposes Nashville's few major flaws. The beautifully understated satire sometimes boils over into screwball territory, as when Geraldine Chaplin interviews a phalanx of cars at a junkyard or a bit player pontificates about the Kennedy assassination. Likewise, the unannounced cameos by Hollywood actors; especially those from previous Altman pictures, smacks of self-parody and threatens to expose the transparency of the filmmaking process itself. Where this works beautifully in The Player, it stands out awkwardly in the country music universe of Nashville. Given the documentarian zeal of Altman's vision, however, one is more than willing to forgive him the occasional in-joke.",1111363200,3,2370,5.657303370786517
1090676,4,6305918708,"Like alot of Robert Altman films, ""Nashville"" is an interesting film but the large cast and numerous plot threads seem to trip over one another.  Ultimately, I wonder what Altman is trying to say because his message is not coherent.  There's just too much information being thrown at us.  The size of the cast gave few of the actors a chance to really shine with one exception.  Gwen Welles as a waitress who deludes herself that she is a good singer gives a truly heartbreaking performance that will stay with you.  The music in the film isn't particularly memorable.  My understanding was that the city fathers of Nashville were not particularly helpful with this production because Altman's liberal sensibilities did not exactly cohere with the town's conservative bent.  One thing I can say about this disc is Altman delivers an engaging commentary.  Even if your not a fan of Altman's work check out his commentaries on this film, ""M*A*S*H"", and ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller.""",1105920000,2,976,4.908536585365853
1090677,5,6305918708,"There have been few American films in the latter half of the twentieth century quite so influential as NASHVILLE, which attempts to sum up no less than the feelings of homelessness and betrayal in American life after the Sixties and Watergate, and the way popular culture acts to ameliorate these problems and to blind us to them as well. The film covers five days in the life of 24 characters in the summer of 1975, as a campaign manager assembles a series of country western stars for a benefit concert for a third-party candidate at the Nashville Parthenon in Centennial Park; along the way we get a kind of thin slice of each of their lives, and a look in particular at their relation to poltics, to sexual and racial mores, and to the country-music industry. Although the DVD does not have the kind of extras that a film of this stature deserves, it still has a very intriguing commentary by Robert Altman that shows you what a happy accident much of the film turned out to be: how some of the most famous and oft-quoted bits of dialogue (such as Barbara Baxley's heartfelt ode to the Kennedy brothers) were improvisations of the cast at the time. The film has a kind of texture and richness to it that almost no other film before it could macth, and it has been imitated (by Altman himself, among others) since it first appeared. What most of the imitations have missed, however, is the kind of linchpin that Ronee Blakeley's performance as Barbara Jean, the central character, provides. Lovely and special, Blakely makes evident why the public and the other country-western stars adores her character so much (there's a marvelous bit of business in the famous ""Opry Belle"" sequence that makes this clear when Barbara Jean first walks onstage to perform: she is gallantly escorted out by one of the dancers and waves to her fans from a doorway; only as the intro to the song swells does she step up close to them and to the camera to begin her first great number, ""The Cowboy Song""). Although most of the film's other performers cannot sing very well and their numbers are mostly terrible (which is part of Altman's point: country music at the time was primarily a democratic folk art gaining enormous popularity), Blakely's Barbara Jean is an extraordinary singer. Her beautiful final song, ""My Idaho Home,"" which is used at the film's great climax, provides a kind of summa for the entire movie in its fond memories of a unified Amnerican family life despite hardship and deprivation. This is Altman's greatest and most famous film, and deserves repeated viewings.",1105833600,5,2572,4.743303571428571
1090678,5,6305918708,"After ""MASH"", Robert Altman made some exceptional films, most notably ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"". He loved the idea of the ensemble cast. ""Nashville"" is the first of his mind-blowing endeavors to bring multiple incredible characters together. At 3 hours, the film is not boring for a minute, Character development is so complete. To single out a performance would be tough, but I really liked Barbara Harris as the confused and goofy wannabe who actually brought it all together at the end. Oscar nominated performances from Lily Tomlin and Ronee Blakely (in her film debut) were impressive, as well as Henry Gibson, and a particularly touching performance by Keenan Wynn. Altman is a very precise director, and his devotion to the proceedings is prevalent throughout. The fact that Joan Tewkesbury's amazing screenplay received no recognition still escapes me. Every song in this film is original, and all are great. Blakely's songs are well presented, but one of the most devastating moments is when Keith Carradine sings ""I'm Easy"" (Oscar winner). It's the first time I remember a Best Song winner being an integral part of the plot of the film (possible exception: Que sara sara from ""The Man Who Knew Too Much""). While Carradine sings this song, every woman in the audience thinks he's singing it to her. There are repercussions. Altman is always great, and only gets greater. His next film, ""Three Women"", was more intimate and so brilliant. The epitome of Altman ensemble has to be ""Short Cuts"", but don't miss ""Cookie's Fortune"" or ""Gosford Park"".

1090679,5,6305918708,"I apologize for the disorginization of this review.  I wrote it quickly and in an enthralled state, both factors that do not often contribute to a well-written essay.  Nevertheless, I hope I provide some insight into the wonder of 'Nashville' for those who've yet to see it or hear about it, though I'm sure most have.

'Nashville' is a film taking place in, you guessed it, Nashville, Tennessee during the Opry.  However, the wonder of 'Nashville' is that I cannot continue to tell you what it is about.  In fact, the film doesn't even surround the Opry, let alone a central story.  On the surface, this film concerns the lives of many people (at least 24 major characters) scattered about Nashville going on with their lives, yearning to somehow break into the Country Western/Bluegrass music scene, and others who are on the sidelines watching; there are even political candidates and gospel singers.  Beneath the surface, each person is in some way wounded or flawed or unusual.  Like Roger Ebert says in his essay on this film, ""it is a tender poem to the wounded and to the sad.""  'Nashville' is certainly a poem; a well-constructed poem balancing these many lives, characters, jokes, tears, and deaths all to reflect American sensibilities (with political undertones, of course; keep in mind this film was made in the late 70s).

First and foremost, the characters are immensely memorable.  I happen to have two favorites: Lily Tomlin's gospel singer with deaf children who seems to be unhappy with a busy husband who insists on disrespecting their condition; Geraldine Chaplin's BBC reporter, babbling on into her microphone in metaphor and melodramatic description before returning to Bluegrass bars and sticking the mic into the noses of the famous and the observant.  As Roger Ebert points out, Chaplin's character becomes even more interesting when you begin to doubt her position as a BBC reporter.  She seems to journey on alone, having affairs and wandering about garbage dumps all the while speaking into her tape recorder, no camera man in sight, though she claims he exists whilst complaining he's never there to get ""the perfect shot.""

Each and every character has some sort of memorable attribute.  Director Robert Altman (who is a master at his craft) is incredibly skilled at both introducing each character and allowing each to have his or her moment that cements them into our heads while contributing to the message and tone of the film.  No other director has ever seemed to pull this cinematic structure off quite as well as he; not even the other famed ensemble auteur, John Sayles (of what I've seen of Sayles' work, anyway).  As each character returns here and there, interweaving with situations and places and people while others may be upfront and they in the sidelines, one is able to recognize all of them, reveling in the memory of their signature qualities.  However, the characters are not left unconnected; Geraldine Chaplin's reporter and Jeff Goldblum (to a lesser extent than Chaplin) are the inter-connecting tissue.  But despite containing a plethora of characters and an extensive running time, the film itself is at times sweeping, interesting, terribly sad, and heartbreakingly honest; it is great for reasons beyond excellent and unique characterization.  The perfect moment among many comes when a womanizing Country star, played fantastically by Keith Carradine, sings his song, which would be Oscar-nominated after the film's release.

(spoiler warning)

The song is ""I'm Easy.""  By the time this performance arrives, Carradine's womanizer Tom has slept with or seduced four of the major women in the film: Shelly Duvall's quirky young Californian, Chaplin's BBC reporter, his music partner's lover, and Lily Tomlin's gospel singer.  All are at the same performance hall when Tom begins to sing the debut of ""I'm Easy,"" a song he says he wrote recently.  Thus, all four women believe the song has been written for them.  This scene is constructed and executed with utmost cinematic precision, and it is perhaps my favorite in the film and in possibly most films I've seen in my life time.  Its power is unending, its wit astounds.  If the rest of the film were dreck I'd still recommend it for this single, solitary moment.  You see the camera traveling to each woman's face: one is pleased, one is secretive, one is sickly in love, while the final face is mesmerized, a resonant, profound look of need and of passion: she may have found solace.  This is Tomlin's face, and I dare not ruin how her inner thoughts so gracefully explored on-screen manifest.  I would risk limiting the affect anything following this scene may have on you if you choose to watch 'Nashville' for the first time.

The film does not peak at greatness just there.  It perhaps has many peaks, as it has many characters and story arcs.  'Nashville' proves to be profound in the littlest of things and never over-the-top when reaching for the grandiose.  Its structure is so well done, allowing the characters to be varied in every sense and still memorable as the credits role.  Therefore, one may take away everything and anything from Nashville.'  There is so much to enjoy and to ponder.  Even the signature music begins to grow on you, whether you enjoy country music or not.  I write with passion because 'Nashville' is a film that ignites the desire to love, to live, and to understand.  I recommend Robert Altman's 'Nashville' to not just those who enjoy music or those who enjoy Altman films, but to the human race.  I guarantee you will hold no regret, as it is visceral and intimate, beautiful and dark from beginning to end.  'Nashville' defines ""great.""",1102204800,5,5691,4.947368421052632
1090680,3,6305918708,"Robert Altman says that when he first released the film NASHVILLE the folks in the city of Nashville hated it.  Now, they love it.  Like many of his films N'ville was created with an ensemble cast.  Although it is a good film and certainly entertaining, I would not characterize it as his best work, especially given later releases of his films MASH and GOSFORD PARK. Heck I like SHORT CUTS better than MASH, which given the impending US attack on the city of Faluja is depressing to watch.

Altman is interviewed for the DVD and provides the viewer with some information that makes the film more sensible. Seems he dispatched a young woman working for him to Nashville and told her to ""keep a journal"" of her experiences. In the film that young woman is the basis of Geraldine Chapman's character the BBC reporter who is trying to explain the culture of Nashville to the folks back home.

-the sound is kind of weird, the music sequences have high high volume and the dialogue is often too quiet at times that you have to turn up the volume on your set and then get a nasty jolt when the film cuts away to a music sequence.  and if you know how many times this movie goes back and forth between music sequences you can perhaps understand my frustration.  i understand that during robert altman's career and given his attention to dialogue and sound mixing a great deal of technical innovation occurred as a result of altman's efforts and contributions.  i think it would have been to his benefit (and his work's benefit) if he revisited this production and did something about the sound mixing.
-the film transfer doesn't seem to be all that grand.  certain scenes appear a little too washed out and bright and the colours seems distorted.  this as well would have benefitted greatly from developments in film production technology these days.
-the extras are so-so.  it seems as tho there would be mountains of praise for this film (actually i'm sure there is), interviews (20+ characters?  come on!), commentaries, additional scenes left out (altman actually refers to these on the disc) and it would be interesting to see some outtakes considering the scale and grandeur of altman's style especially with regards to this particular film.  and (again i'm being biased here) i would have loved to see some outtakes/bloopers with geraldine chaplin's character cos altman says in the commentary that a lot of her monologues (in the scrap yard, in the bus yard, elsewhere) were improvised.
anyway, i love this film.  i dropped the rating down one only star because i thought that the dvd could have been a little better and offered something special to those of us that understand the tremendous amount of tenacity and talent that culminates in a robert altman film.
so, get this dvd if you want the best currently available version of this film and to treasure it until hopefully another company (criterion? *wishing*) picks this film up as a project to restore and flesh out.

1090805,5,6305918708,"In the aftermath of the Vietnam war and the Watergate Scandal American people had a large amount of cynicism for the United States government.  The newly formed Replacement Party is attempting to make a run for the United States Presidency with their presidential candidate.  To boost their chances to win they try to get help from Nashville's country musicians.  The Replacement Party's outspoken policy includes: rewriting the national anthem, preventing tax exemption for religious groups, and banning lawyers from congress.  These prerecorded proposals are being repeatedly spat out through a white van's loud speakers while driving around.  As mentioned before, this is taking place in Nashville, i.e., Music City, through the actions and consequences of a kaleidoscope of characters, which can be seen as a sample of the American people.  Almost the entire story is filmed from a distance which provides a feeling of objectivity and it enhances the audience's ability to form their own hypotheses based on what is being displayed.  Under Altman's dazzling direction the audience can also experience a sense of realism through the long shots and multiple activities that can be observed in almost every scene.  The score goes well in hand with the theme, since country music is something that is made in United States.  The cast is extraordinarily well put together and their performances are outstanding.

1090806,5,6305918708,"It rather surprises me how many people who love film have barely heard of this movie. I suspect that many of my fellow Brits see the title buried in the TV schedules and think, Hmm, obviously a film about country music, I don't think so. And I suspect that the film's reputation is held back in America by the satirical picture it presents of that often troubled country being more mercilessly dark than many Americans can perhaps comfortably take.
IN some ways a distaste for country music is a positive advantage in enjoying this film as it paints an outrageously dark picture of the country music industry that may disturb fans. Then again, that isn't really the point. At a deeper level the movie isn't about country music at all, but about the United States. Unless there is some jewel that has escaped me, it's quite simply the best political satire about modern America that has ever been made. In its long slow complex tapestry following 24 intersecting lives over the course of a few days it articulates a satirical vision that delivers unfailingly the paradoxical harvest of good black comedies of being at once funny and horrifying. It is also intelligent and deep. In its unflinching gaze at American life in all its desperation and banility it seeks to address that most insistent of questions: where in this oasis of almost impossible wealth, does so much violence come from? There may better attempts to answer that question, but none of them are movies.
Most centrally I think, this is a movie about the ""American Dream"": about how, for every one person for whom that dream delivers its promise, there are many more for whom it turns into a nightmare. In a throwaway moment, a singer's crass preliminary banter with her audience finds her reminding a group of children that: ""Any one of you can grow up to be the President."" The film does not contest the proposition that one of them might land this or other glittering prizes. But it shows us with painful honesty, littered as it is with deluded losers, how many more of them will be destroyed by failing to do so and how the minority who succeed risk being still more utterly destroyed by their success. Above all, it shows us the appallingly rich diversity of ways there are in which a human being can be, in one way or another, destroyed.
If there one aspect of the film that is flawed and dated, it the main comic turn, the exasperating pretentious ""Opal from the BBC"", as played by Geraldine Chaplin, who, while amusing enough on first viewing, grates after a second or a third - though her, naive, very British innocence about American racial politics is perhaps telling. Besides which, this idiotic Englishwoman doesn't really belong here in this film which is so quintessentially about America (Altman of course lays into England with great effect much later in ""Gosford Park""). Generally however, the acting is excellent, some of it brilliant. One might single out the little known Henry Gibson as the singer Haven Hamilton, disgustingly but hilariously preoccupied with his own semi-celebrity, and Michael Murphy as the cynical, amoral and brilliantly unctuous and insincere political aide to Hal Philip Walker (who never appears on camera), Presidential candidate for the half-baked Replacement Party. The relatively minor performances are also often inspired, notably Scott Glenn as the taciturn soldier obsessed with a country music diva almost to the point of stalking her, Allen Garfield as the same diva's short-fused and over-protective husband, Keenan Wynn as a lost old man with a dying wife and David Hayward as a nerdy nobody who turns out to be a more pivotal character than he seems. All these performances - and others - are good but the film is pretty well stolen by Ronee Blakely as aforementioned diva, Barbara Jean, a talented, tragic basket case, whose performance is altogether astonishing. She can sing too.
Even Blakely, however brilliant, is not the main star of the movie. The star is unmistakably the director and the directing is almost perfect. Check out above all the way the scenes involving musical performances (which make up rather a lot of the film) are directed, as the focus of the camera's eye moves with perfectly judged pace between the performers on stage and the countless micro-dramas backstage and in the audience: it's wonderful. The wonder reaches a climax in the explosive last twenty minutes or so of the film, a political gala concert in aid of Walker which is one of the most unforgettable twenty minutes of cinema to be seen anywhere.

1090809,5,6305918708,"NASHVILLE, which I watched for the first time a couple weeks ago, is the best Robert Altman film I've ever seen. It's the first, I believe, and best of his forays into true ensemble framework narratives. (You know what I mean, where there are 25 characters who all are connected somehow, where not everything ties together, and there are 14 plots instead of one.)
The film takes place over five days in the Country Music Capitol of the World. Some of the characters are in the music business, some of them want to be, and some of them are tangentially linked to the music business. There's a new radical presidential candidate in town, and there are hints throughout the film that an assassination attempt is in the air. Something about some of the characters just isn't quite right, like the way Scott Glenn's character seems obsessed with a singer or how one character gives a long speech about the Kennedy assassinations.
It's a labyrinth plot about people, how they live their lives, how they follow dreams and how they hope to escape the emptiness around them.
It's brilliantly acted. The script is the best. And no one directs this kind of film better than Altman, though SHORT CUTS and READY TO WEAR are lesser films than this one.",1043366400,5,1238,4.68348623853211
1090810,5,6305918708,"Working from a screenplay by Joan Tewesbury, Robert Altman has created the most innovative and most endlessly fascinating film of the 1970s. This epic satire-tragedy is also hilariously funny, thanks to brilliant performances from (among others) Lily Tomlin, Ned Beatty, Shelley Duvall, Karen Black, Barbara Harris, Henry Gibson and Ronee Blakely, whose indelible ""Barbara Jean"" (based to some extent on Loretta Lynn) is one of the great characters in movie history.
This movie was nominated for a shelf-load of Oscars, including Best Picture,  Best Actress for Blakely and Best Supporting Actress for Lily Tomlin.  Naturally the picture was shut out, but that's show biz.  Note: There is a a very vocal contingent of 'Nashville'-bashers out there, saying it's shallow, it's boring, it's too long, it's this, it's that.

1090870,2,6305918708,"Altman is Altman, and this overlong epic is full of his most characteristic habits of film-making. As usual, there is a sharply critical edge to his semi-satirical portrait of America. Unfortunately, however, it lacks any narrative drive whatsoever, which might not be a problem if it weren't for the fact that nothing else compensates for this. The characters are devoid of warmth; there is insufficient reason for us even to care what happens to them.
Fans of country music may well find it a more pleasurable experience: I happen to loathe most country and western, so I found the extended musical episodes barely tolerable. Watching Nashville is like watching a life unfold only from a distance; this detachment is fatal to a merely intermittently interesting film.",1038787200,11,769,5.111111111111111
1090871,2,6305918708,"I can't fathom the excessive praise given on Nashville and its classic status. It is put together with Altman's trademark fluency present in all of his films:in the great ones (Short Cuts, Gosford Park, The Player) and in the tedious ones (MASH, Cookie's Fortune, Pret' a Porter).My viewing experience was irritating due to Altman's inherent contempt for his characters together with  his assertion of superiority towards their petty behaviour and aspirations, the meandering plot (if a dozen of scenes  had ended in the cutting floor,you wouldn't have been able to tell the difference), let alone the country-western songs that constitute a first rate torture for the non-adherents. The only  character who could offer some insight or commentary to the social mileau portrayed in the film was the BBC documentary producer, but Altman in order to avoid any attempt for critique (mere exhibition is far more easier) makes her as idiotic as the morons that are featured in the film. The political subtext of the movie is undeveloped and the ironic song of the ending, sung collectively by the audience after the celebrity assasination (""It don't worry me""), although aptly underlines the passivity and political apathy of all those individuals, it, nevertheless, fails to offer any constructive alternative and moreover it is characterised by a pervese rejection of the possibility of such an alternative. Altman is more of an observer whose acuteness and incisiveness depends on the quality of the script that has in hand (cf. Gosford Park or Short Cuts), rather than somebody who being dissatisfied with a given situation has something else to propose or at least illustrate what he perceives as being problematic. Throughout the film I found it hard to care about any of the 24 characters or the situations (greatly resembling those of sitcoms) that were involved because they resembled more to comic sketches than complex individuals (Shelley Duvall's portrait of a Californian chewing-gum, hot-pants bimbo, to name the least). A rather overrated film which demonstrates Altman's technical proficiency together with his fundamental limitations.
Regarding the DVD presentation of this film feature, I must mention that it is excellent with pristine picture and sound quality. It also features an commentary and an interview by Altman himself, making a must-have for the films' fans (or maybe its detractors!).",1038096000,14,2410,5.320209973753281
1090872,1,6305918708,"I'm a fan of Robert Altman and always wondered about this film. It was always regarded as a great movie and I finally had a chance to watch it. I found it to be a big disappointment. It does capture maybe the hype and hypocrisy of what the Nashville music was once like, but only in a 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World' movie style. I found the movie really unwatchable and going nowhere. Drawn out musical scenes of bad music. Half the characters had no development other than a 'Laugh-In' style appearance every now and then. I guess these were attempts at humor. I didn't care about any of them and kept hoping that a story would appear. Finally a star is assassinated, I guess in what is was suppose to convey some heavy message of the times, but to be honest I couldn't cheer for the assassin enough. Thank You! Yes, kill her. No sympathy was even evoked. So check out Mr. Altman's other movies, but pass on this one big time.",1037750400,9,925,4.32183908045977
1090873,5,6305918708,"I recently rewatched this film for the first time in a long, long time, and was amazed at how much better it was than I remembered.  Moreover, I remembered it as being very, very good.  In this film, director Robert Altman tracks the interweavings of over twenty major characters over the course of a few days in Nashville.  Some of the characters are major Country-Western performers, and others are mere wannabes.  All is set against the background of a mysterious third party presidential candidate for the Replacement Party, whose cars and vans drive around the city, broadcasting his commonsensical yet superficial political messages.
Altman has always excelled more than anyother director with ensemble casts, and this is the greatest example of that in his career.  No one cast member predominates.  Ronee Blakley probably should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, but was hurt by Lily Tomlin's also being nominated.  Lily Tomlin and Henry Gibson's performances were both completely unexpected at the time, since both were considered television comedians and had been regulars on Rowan and Martin's Laugh In.  But truly, none of the cast members were weak, and most were exceptional.  Keenan Wynn was superb as Mr. Green, whose wife is dying of cancer in the film.  But the true star of the film is Altman, who is utterly masterful in the way he brings his characters into contact with one another, like a dance director choreographing an immense ballet.  One becomes accustomed to seeing all the same faces in one scene or event after another, and for some odd recent it doesn't strike one as at all coincidental.  I especially enjoyed seeing Jeff Goldblum's nonspeaking character The Tricycle Man popping up in scene after scene on his triwheel chopper that seems more a parody of EASY RIDER than an imitator.
The movie is laced with songs, and what makes them special is the fact that everyone did their own singing and most wrote the songs that they sang.  Keith Carradine especially distinguished himself with two great songs, ""I'm Easy, "" which actually netted the Academy Award that year for best song, and the rousing closing number, ""It Don't Bother Me.""  To be honest, while most of the singers are at least competent (except for the intentionally awful Sueleen Gay, heartbreakingly portrayed by the excellent Gwen Welles), few are truly first rate.  The two great exceptions are Ronee Blakley, who manages an utterly stunning Loretta Lynn impersonation, and the improbably spectacular (in the context of the movie) Barbara Harris, whose unexpected rendition of ""It Don't Worry Me"" provides one of the movie's more amazing moments.  Some real Nashville musicians turn up as well.  In particular, Vassar Clements, considered by many to be the greatest country fiddler, turns up in a Nashville music club as himself.
The movie has many subtle things to say about celebrity and politics, and the ongoing confusion of the two (brought out powerfully by the ending, in which an entertainer rather than a political figure is assasinated, and by the fact that one person is mentioned as a gubernatorial candidate, when his only qualification would seem to be that he was a singer).  But the movie has broader appeal than just of the Country Music Capital of America.  The film intends to be about America itself.  It truly does succeed in being an epic about the American experience.  A great, great masterpiece.",1036195200,39,3443,5.015817223198594
1090874,5,6305918708,"In the hands of a lesser director, `Nashville' would have been a confusing mess. Indeed, when I initially sat down to watch the film I expected to be confused; the prospect of keeping track of twenty-four or so main characters, numerous story-lines and countless themes, seemed daunting at first. After my first viewing of `Nashville,' I felt a degree of shock realizing how easy it is to immerse yourself into the film's world - I expected to be overwhelmed by the amount of action going on, but instead I found myself overwhelmed by the seemingly endless list of feelings that Altman's picture aroused in me. I have since seen `Nashville' on several other occasions, and I now consider it to be one of my favorite movies.
`Nashville' is a landscape of a particular time and place. Altman's picture sets the audience in an environment covered by hotel rooms and bars and concert halls, where people work endlessly in the recording studio and out in the social environment to promote their music. The country music industry is another business, and `Nashville' concerns all ends of the spectrum - those at the top, the struggling ones at the bottom, and those halfway on their journey. Early on, we are able to recognize the large number of characters: who they are, what they want, and how they relate to the others.
What makes `Nashville' so appealing is how it chooses to deal with universal themes - making the picture accessible to those who have no interest in country music. Still, as Robert Altman illustrates on the DVD commentary, `Nashville' is a musical. In its 140 minutes, about an hour of that time is dedicated to musical performances. What's interesting, though, is the subtle manner in which the songs mirror the events taking place; it may take a second viewing of the film to realize a few of the connections. While the musicians in the picture use their art to reflect their lives, the movie makes no illusions that the songwriters and performers are on a quest to pursue artistic freedom. As stated before, it is a business.
Fortunately, though, Altman doesn't, as so many others do, reduce the business figures down to the caricature of the unfeeling money-grubber. There are no clear cut good-guys or bad-guys; there's no simple-minded plot pushing the characters along. These are real people, confused, and jumbled together with one another. As Roger Ebert observed, `Nashville' is `a tender poem to the wounded and the sad.'
With youthful energy, `Nashville' succeeds at creating an entertaining picture despite its disregard for the standard structure of cinematic storytelling. What `Nashville' has done is allowed space for a wide variety of memorable individuals to grow. The ending is key to the film - it's one of the most emotional I've ever seem - being that it shows people running about in the midst of chaos; and, during all this confusion, we realize that we recognize each person. In so many many movies, times of crisis are personified by a large cast of faceless extras going to and fro; yet in `Nashville' a connection is made between the viewer and the world on the screen. It's an experience rarely encountered.",1029369600,,3155,4.877094972067039
1090875,5,6305918708,"Robert Altman brings Americana to life in a way that is not only brilliantly scripted, but also wrenching to the heart.

1090877,5,6305918708,"Even in homespun Nashville?
Well Nashville like Hollywood is a business town and everyone in it is just passing through on their way up or down. And even good ol fashioned country music is not immune from the corrupting influences of industry. Country music offers an attractive grass roots/idealised version of American life and the atmosphere in which that music is created just seems all the more tainted in comparison to those ode-to-the-simple- life lyrics.
Altman loves satirizing America but there is definitely a love for the object of his satire as well. He has taken on L.A. and Hollywood and in more recent years Europe too but Nashville seems just the right spot for Altmans particular kind of satire to blossom in.
Nashville attracts all kinds and in Nashville the people are perhaps a little less sophisticated and a little less jaded than they are on either east or west coast. Nashville is insulated and its world is thus all the more intimate,a perfect situation for an Altman cast to thrive in. Altmans Nashville is an interesting blend of the America that the founding fathers championed and the one that they feared. Nashville is diverse, not necessarily an easy goin and peacefully coexistent diversity but an always interesting and lively one. All the various country stars and producers are pursuing what is in their own best interest or in some cases just too self involved to pay much attention to anyone else. All the competitive jockeying for position makes for a ruthless atmosphere at times but at other times when the music plays it creates a celebratory and festive atmosphere. The women seem to have the hardest time with this lifestyle. Karen Black's character is a succesful singer but near breakdown, Lily Tomlin is genuine and talented but gets involved with the wrong guy played by an easy goin Carradine, & a wannabe singer who can't sing ends up stripping to please a riotous crowd.  Everyone wants their moment to shine.
The cutting back and forth between all the various plot lines wears you out but it is also exilerating as the plot lines begin to mesh as the movie nears the climactic rally.  The abscence of big stars(except in cameo) is just one of the many admirable things about this film and one that keeps it feeling grounded. Its barely controlled chaotic structure and its just barely manageable length assures that you will not fully digest this monster montage all at once which is probably a calculated effect. There is just life, no one kind of order will suffice. Altmans magic is that he loves showing you all sides of it. There is no central narrative voice as in a novel just a speechless camera which seeks and finds a kind of satisfaction in the glory of endless variety.",1016668800,4,2733,4.800424628450106
1090878,5,6305918708,"NASHVILLE is, according to the movie trailer included on the DVD, ""the damnedest thing you ever saw""--and the statement is accurate: Robert Alman's NASHVILLE is one of the rare films that truly defies description.  The film follows a myriad of characters over the course of several days leading up to a political rally, and their stories intersect and overlay each other to create a touching, troubling, and wickedly funny portrait of America at its most gloriously superficial.  Given the diversity of material the film presents, the viewer is necessarily forced to focus attention on various aspects of the film at the expense of others.  As a result, no two viewers will see the film from precisely the same point of view--and no one viewer will have the same reaction to multiple viewings.  Even so, all thematic roads lead if not to Rome at least to the Roman colliseum of American celebrity and politics, where fame is won and lost in the wake of violence and where the strong consume the weak without significant personal animosity.

The performances are stunning across the board--so much so that one is unable to think of any individual performer without also thinking of the cast as a whole. Although director Altman does not so much guide as observe, there is a certain inevitability to the progression of the characters the film presents. Given the complexity of the film and the fact that it requires viewers to actively and selectively interpret the material as it unfolds, NASHVILLE will likely defeat a great many viewers, who may find themselves frustrated by the film's constantly shifting content; still others will be outraged by the vision it creates of America as a society. For those willing and able to dive into the complex web of life it presents, Altman's masterpiece will be an endlessly fascinating mirror in which we see the energy of life itself scattered, gathered, and reflected back to us. A masterpiece that bears repeated viewings much in the same way that a great novel bears repeated readings. A personal favorite and highly, highly recommended.

It is one of the only American movies I have ever seen that is like painting. The more you watch it, the more you see. What impresses me most is the economy with which the characters are presented. While the picture is almost three hours long, Altman has the difficult task of describing twenty-four distinct characters in this limited time space. He does so masterfully. The smallest details reveal the characters' deepest secrets, regrets, feelings. My favourite scene has to be the one where Keith Carradine's playboy/folk singer character serenades Lily Tomlin with his original composition, ""I'm Easy"".

1090975,5,6305918708,"First, the DVD.  Unlike some other viewers, I find the visual clarity, color saturation, and audio presence to be perfectly acceptable (after seeing some horrible 16mm prints ten years ago, I was prepared for the worst).  You'll be able to spot Ronee Blakely's eyes tearing up as well as distinguish the multiple dialogues in Altman's polyphonous soundtrack.  But of all my DVD's, this is the most temperamental.  I cast spells on it, sprinkle it with holy water, pray and wait with bated breath.  Sometimes my player recognizes it as a playable disc (after excruciatingly long waits); other times it simply refuses to play it.
The other main downside of the disc is the soundtrack commentary by director Altman (thank goodness, you have the option to ignore this ""special feature"" altogether).  While no author should be trusted as an authority about his own child, the saying goes double for an ""intuitive"" creative mind such as Altman's.  His remarks are banal, fatuous and injurious to his accomplishment.  I'm reminded of the time ""60 Minutes"" devoted a segment to him and he came off as nothing more than a self-indulgent, irresponsible, pot-smoking hippie encouraging his actors to party while he filmed them.  Or of his proclamations that his ill-conceived ""Ready to Wear"" (the only Altman film without any redeeming qualities ) was the highwater mark of his career.
But even the inarticulate (though verbose) Altman can't damage a film as Titanic and Olympian as ""Nashville,"" though he tries his best.  During Ronee Blaklely's deeply affecting performance of the song ""Dues,"" he jabbers about how lucky he was to have some ""Shriners"" in the audience; about the assassin and the film's climactic, shocking scene he brags that only he would have had the clairvoyance to insist on such a scene and then offers such penetrating insights as ""assassins are weird"" and, despite what other people think, are ""really just trying to get attention for themselves.""
Altman's film arguably stands with Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" as the two outstanding cinematic achievements of  the 1970s (though ""Godfather"" and ""Chinatown"" certainly deserve consideration).  It is a criticism of life and of the American dream, an exhilarating black comedy, an infectious musical drama, a piece of extraordinary ironic vision, equal parts comedy and tragedy.  And despite Altman's obtuse interpretation of his own creation, the final action in retrospect is a fated ""convergence of the twain"".  An earlier scene reveals political posters in the assassin's car that suggest he's come to Nashville and its Parthenon (as bogus as the authenticity of the ""country-music rusticity"" in what had become by 1975 the media capital of the U.S.) to assassinate the 3rd-party poltical candidate.  But in the film's chilling, climactic montage we witness his rage suddenly transfer from his own demanding mother to Barbara Jean's pathetic attempt to create a ""mommy and daddy"" out of the disconnected fragments of her celebrity-driven past.  The shot connects the pieces of the movie, but so does Henry Gibson's mock-heroic response, invoking the patron saints of Nashville in a thoughtless yet curiously admirable way.  And then Altman's brilliant tracking shot to the American flag and the skies of America, at once a transcendence of the vanity fair and a Gatsby-like reaching for the original, pure dream.
Perhaps too extemporaneously ""scripted"" and  too much of a ""period piece"" to ever enjoy the lasting canonical hold of Welles' Xanadu, Altman's ""Nashville"" nevertheless exploits the potential of the medium like few other films, capturing life ""as it is lived"" while viscerally and indelibly altering the consciousness of its viewer.",987292800,,3709,5.257627118644068

I won't rehash the plot, because there isn't just one.  There are twenty-four -- one for each character -- and Altman obviously loves them all.  Every character is given (more or less) equal screen time and a moment to shine.  It's really the most democratic of film structures, and Altman juggles the multiple storylines with aplomb.
It appears from other reviews that ""Nashville"" viewers are divided into two camps -- those who ""get"" it, and those who don't.  I'm not a critic, I just picked it up off the shelf about 15 years ago because it sounded interesting.  I wasn't prepared for such a funny and moving experience.  The ending...  WOW...

I can only reccommend seeing this movie in widescreen.  Pan and scan doesn't do ""Nashville"" justice, as Altman requires a very large canvas to tell his stories.

<< The peer pressure among film reviewers to laud ""Nashville"" began before the film even came out, when Pauline Kael took the highly unorthodox and ethically dubious step of raving in The New Yorker over a rough cut that Altman screened especially for her. But more than even this, I think the reason ""Nashville"" got a free ride was that it passed itself off as ""an epic canvas of American life."" Reviewers are suckers for hype like that. That ""Nashville"" is exactly like every other Altman movie, in which the director expresses his thinly veiled contempt for his freaky characters, seems not to have occurred to any of them. (Altman particularly enjoys seeing women humiliated with nudity - i.e. ""MASH"", ""Ready to Wear"", ""Short Cuts"", etc.) He also manages to express contempt for the audience by making his soundtrack an incomprehensible muddle of overlapping dialogue - a pretentious little trick that the reviewers also eat up with a spoon. And ""Nashville"" lingers painfully in my memory as perhaps the visually ugliest film I've ever seen. >>
Of the 34 comments posted before mine, only 1 dared to suggest that Bobby A.'s chef-d'oeuvre might be something less than a supreme masterpiece of American cinema. On behalf of my friend and those like her who lack the courage to speak out, let me state for the record that not only is ""Nashville"" not on par with the great films of the 70s, it is, like most of the rest of Altman's oeuvre, an amateurish piece of garbage. It is inferior in conception, execution, and artistic insight to many hundreds of other movies from that decade including, say, ""Can't Stop The Music"".
If there is a more glaring case of the Emperor's New Clothes than the continuing deference... ...by the film community, I don't know about it.",983404800,32,1886,4.788343558282208
1091090,5,6305918708,"Nashville is one of the most interesting, intelligent and compelling movies to ever come out of Hollywood. Featuring bravura performances from each of the 24 main characters, it is a brilliant examination of American society, politics, religion, showbusiness and culture. This 157 minute film tackles all of these issues at a steady pace (the director's control is absolutely superb), leading up to a shattering denouement. Despite being made in 1976, Nashville still packs a hell of a punch - its themes are still relevant today.
  The eponymous setting of the movie is synonymous with politics. From the start of the movie, a campaign wagon for a presidential candidate drives all over the town spewing political slogans and ideals to the residents: this wagon links all of the characters together. As Robert Altman follows it, he focuses on all of Nashville's protagonists using brief vignettes that each tell a short story of their own - gradually, all of these characters intertwine and eventually, converge on the eve of a political rally.
  Each of these vignettes are so concise, so telling in their exposition of the character, that the viewer almost immediately fathoms an understanding of what each protagonist is like. Who to fear; who to admire; who to respect; who to pity. Altman peppers the movie with over one hour of music - after all, Nashville is the home of country/western. The lyrics ring true with certain characters and elicit emotional responses from the viewer. ""We [Americans] must be doing something right to last two hundred years,"" sings one character at the start of the movie - later on, scenes that show a woman forced to strip, as well as a shooting, deliver a sharp ring of irony to the lyric.
  All of the performances in the movie are brilliant, the most notable of which is Lily Tomlin. She is especially good as the mother of two deaf children, all the while struggling with her marriage. Her husband makes no effort to translate his deaf son's story of swimming lessons: ""what's he sayin'?"" he asks. Her sorrow translates beautifully to the screen with the help of Nashville's score. Each actor conveys their character's emotions to the viewer with relative ease, which consequently heightens understanding and compels the viewer to watch on with interest. Because the viewer can connect with each of the characters, the finale is that much more heartbreaking.  Ultimately, Nashville is a brilliant character study of epic scope and proportions. The technical brilliance behind the movie in conjunction with the excellent performances culminates to create one of the most rewarding and intelligent movies in motion picture history. Nashville leaves the viewer with one clear impression: each of us, whether we like it or not, are part of a society that is both good and bad - behind all the politics, the foul play and the heartbreak, we can still manage to carve out an existence of sorts, and ultimately be happy.",979689600,8,2956,4.995934959349594
1091091,5,6305918708,"Robert Altman's Nashville is the filmmaker's masterpiece.  He weaves the stories of 24 characters into a magical tapestry.  The movie takes place over the course of several days in the music city.  We get into the lives of several big country music stars, a rock trio, a hippie from LA out to see her uncle and sick aunt, a couple of would be singers and others.  The connecting theme running through the movie is that a campaign worker for a presidential candidate (who is never seen, but only heard from a van touting his candidacy that rolls through the city) from a new radical party tries to get support from the musicians to appear at a campaign rally.  The outstanding performances abound including Henry Gibson as an extremely vain and egotistical country singer, Ronee Blakely as a sick and recovering country star, Ned Beatty as a label executive for the musicians and the husband of Lily Tomlin and Michael Murphy as the campaign worker.  The stars all wrote and sang the songs that appear in the film with Keith Carradine winning an Academy Award for his haunting tune ""I'm Easy"".  This film could have been an overblown mess, but Mr. Altman's deft hand guides you through the twists and turns to the surprising conclusion.",979603200,5,1235,4.742990654205608
1091092,2,6305918708,"""Nashville, along with Chinatown and The Wild Bunch, is one of the most overrated movies of the past 30 years.  Why some `film buffs' consider it to be Altman's best is beyond me; they're probably still deluded by  superstar critic Pauline Kael's gushing review of it that's been reprinted many times over the years  (though they've long since forgotten and abandoned Kael's ridiculous suggestion that Bertolucci's bizzare butter-drama ""Last Tango in Paris"" is comparable in importance to Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring,"" or her panning of not only most of Antonioni's and Resnais' films but also Fellini's 8-1/2 as ""self-absorption that fails to reach out imaginatively""!).  McCabe and Mrs. Miller, MASH, Short Cuts (the Son of Nashville in Los Angeles with very little singing, thank you very much), the Player, Vincent and Theo, 3 Women--- these are all far superior to Nashville and much more deserving of their reputations and viewers' attentions.
The interweaving of the characters' stories(a la Short Cuts), the innovative narrative techniques, and the  not very flattering things Altman has to say about American society are very charming and interesting but what you have to sit through to find them, is not. Why? Because this film is a musical, it has hardly anything but country singing throughout. If you want to rack your brains to try to dig some satire out of nearly 2 hours of unbearably annoying country singing (yeah, I know it was meant to be annoying, but masochism for the sake of understanding art has its limits)  by a bunch of characters whose lives run into each other in the 30 minutes or so when they're not warbling on stage, be my guest; I think I'll try Hee-Haw instead.  In fact, I'd rather interpret Scorsese's equally annoying but less pretentious rock-documentary ""The Last Waltz"" as satire; that makes more sense:  it's an absurd enough American `slice of life' ---a bunch of burned out post-hippie musicians symbolic of the increasingly counter-culture influenced American society of the mid `70s, masterfully captured on film with all their warts---and much funnier than Nashville throughout if only looked at the right way,  especially when Bob Dylan opens his mouth .  Why should the fact that the people captured in ""The Last Waltz"" are actual `famous' musicians and not `acting' (though inevitably influenced by and prescribed into a certain `role' by the mere presence of a camera), or , not actors `acting' as musicians (as in Nashville) make such a big difference? It sure doesn't to me.  Why should only Nashville qualify as satire just because it was meant as and  pretends to be satire? I don't buy this film's masterpiece status and neither should you just because a bunch of 'famous critics' have developed a consensus that it is.",976406400,13,2777,5.026143790849673
1091093,5,6305918708,"I saw this movie for the first time at the age of thirteen, and just cried. At the time I couldn't figure out exactly why I had such a tremendous emotional response to the film, but have now come to realize that the shear beauty of ""Nashville"" is simply overpowering.
You see, ""Nashville"" is a movie about America, and its people. The themes studied are as broad and varied as its story's twenty-four main characters. However, as the result of Robert Altman's brilliant direction, the picture never becomes didactic or unfocused in any ways. Instead, it is the most realistic depiction of our nation captured on film.
I cannot put into words the tidal wave of emotion the viewer experiences in the movie's final scene when all the story's characters are united for a single moment in song. Just thinking about it brings tears to my eyes. No, I never lived through Watergate, Vietnam, or Kennedy's assasination, but I don't think that could matter any less. I believe ""Nashville"" is as relevant to America today as it was twenty-five years ago.

How people are just pawns in the rat race for fame & fortune. It displays how phony,morally & ethically lacking people in the political & music worlds are,but I think it goes much deeper than that. This surface story speaks about the American nation & way of life,period. The scene that brings everything together for me and states its theme best is when the drifter,who throughout the movie is the one character who seems to have no purpose being there,looks up at the American flag which seems to confirm his feelings about the shallow people & situations he's observed around him,& commits a final,violent act. I think this movie,and especially this scene,speak volumes about the state of this nation at the time and a forerunner of things to come.

1091097,5,6305918708,"I have more than a few reservations about NASHVILLE, not least of which is  that the idea of a Hollywood filmmaker feeling comfortable in satirizing  the glitz of country music is more than a bit galling. Still, overall, I  think it's a magnificent movie, almost in spite of itself.
I disagree  with my fellow reviewers here in only one small, but important way. It is a  touch too easy to say that the film is a brilliant satire on America in the  1970s. If the film has any validity at all, it is as a satire on America,  period. Sure, the clothes are tacky, the cars ugly, the furniture Sears  & Roebuck, but the point is that in 1975 we recognized those qualities  just as easily. The film's view of America as a country of over-grown  adolescents who refuse to accept responsibility is problably more, not  less, true today. After the orgy of denial that was Reaganism and the  virtuoso compromises of Clintonism, no one in this country should feel  comfortable in condescending to the past. At least in the 1970s we were  going through a national soul searching that made films like NASHVILLE  possible. Can you imagine a film of equivalent breadth, humor, observation  and innovation coming out of today's Hollywood? Fat chance.

1091099,5,6305918708,"This is a long-waited DVD for many. Though NASHVILLE is considered to be Robert Altman's masterpiece and has influenced generations of filmmakers  (Tim Robbins' BOB ROBERTS and CRADLE WILL ROCK, to name the very bests. A  typical bad example is MAGNOLIA), it has been unavailable to most of the  contemporary audience for years: the VHS and LD were pan-and-scanned, and  you can really appreciate the scope of this film only in scope ratio.
 I  saw this legendary film first in 93 when it was re-relased in LA with a  Dolby-remastered restored print. I never had the chance to see it since,  though I remembered almost every detail of this 160minutes movie for years:  this film leaves such a strong impression.
I won't try to describe the  film itself because you can understand what this is all about ONLY if you  ACTUALLY SEE IT. Just one thing: from the point of view of a foreigner who  often visits the States, this portrait of American society at the time of  the Bicentennial still applies to the American society TODAY, at the  beginning of the new millennium, and to any so-called free societies with  the political  system called democracy.  I hope that this DVD will be a  bestseller in the states, then it might have some good influence to the  presidential election.
The DVD looks quite good, recreating the soft  patina of the original look as much as possible on the small screen,  though it looks a little too dark (so please adjust your video monitor).  Altman gives a commentary along the films plus a video interview. The  interview sounds more like a summary of what he says on the commentary. It  would have been more interesting if Paramount had thought of having other  people's voices on the DVD as well. After all, many of the 24 incredible  actors who played the leads of this amazing film are still alive. If  NASHVILLE is, as Altman repeatedly points out, a collective work, then it's  logical, I think, to hear what the cast and crew members has to say.",967075200,7,1983,4.686046511627907

Once  you do though, it's great; don't be frightened by country music-I'm not a  country fan either-but it is used appropriately and the songs generally are  pretty great.  The diverse characters of this film create a wonderful  panoramic snapshot of Nashville at the time, and of American culture as a  whole.  Everyone else reviewing this film has said the same things as I  have, and have done it better, but I just wanted to put in my two cents.

It's the movie that finally made me buy a DVD  player for it truly demands to be viewed in widescreen. Much of the action  takes place within the margins of the frame; likewise, the dialogue is  sometimes spoken by characters at the frame's edge and counterpoints the  image entirely. Spatially, there's no way this movie is intelligible in  anything but widescreen which I believe is one of the reasons it's been  neglected since its release; the minute it left theaters, it never  translated its brilliant mixture of comedy and tragedy as well again (it  would be completely destroyed on commercial TV). ""Nashville"" is  one of the most democratic movies this country has ever produced. Altman  weighs every aspect of it equally and every actor comes through just as  strongly as the next. It's a career-high for most of them: Keith Carradine,  Geraldine Chaplin, Lily Tomlin, Karen Black, Barbara Harris, Ronee Blakley,  Allen Garfield, and Henry Gibson have never been given material this rich  again (not coincidentally, many of the performers worked up their own  material and some wrote their own songs). Most American movies are centered  around the idea that situations and/or objects are only worthy of the  camera's attention. This movie declaratively states that it's really people  who are endlessly fascinating once you stop and listen long enough to what  they have to say. I sincerely hope there is enough interest in this release  to warrant future Altman movies on DVD.

Finally, I found a copy in another store and got to watch  the film in all its widescreen glory and it was as good, if not better,  than I remembered it being.

The film captures the essence of American  life in the 1970's, not hesitating to touch on political corruption, the  grasp for fame, racial problems, and the spirit of letting everybody do  what they want.

1091185,5,6305918708,"Altman's masterpiece is a testimony to the power of cinema to expose the unexamined life and to reveal us to ourselves.  Nashville is not only the film's setting but  a metaphoric microsm of the American dream with all of  its attendant illusions and problems.  But the film also manages to convey  deep sympathy toward the 20 plus characters, each of whom is likely to  become inscribed in the perceptive viewer's memory.  It was the summer  of 1975, and moviegoers were lining up for ""Jaws,"" but  ""Nashville"" was the film that made the more powerful immediate  impact and deeper lasting one.  Nothing since--by Altman or any other  director--has come close to matching the power of this film, an experience  for the spectator that probably cannot be captured by video or digital  technology.  Although critics such as Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert were  quick to understand the film's significance, most viewers were unable to  ""get"" the film.  But for those who did, just mention Ronee  Blakley's performance of ""Dues,""  or the final shot--a  Gatsby-like tilt from the American flag to the open sky--and the memories  return, along with the spinetingling thrill of the movie itself.  (Even  some ""Nashville"" admirers missed the posters in the assassin's  car, which indicate that his original target was the George Wallace-type  candidate, not the country diva who suddenly becomes the scapegoat of his  displaced rage and sense of betrayal.)  In brief, ""Nashville""  is more than a film. It's a richly resonant world to be entered into and  revisited numerous times--as much if not moreso than ""Citizen  Kane,"" ""The Great Gatsby,"" and ""Death of a  Salesman.""",960681600,20,1660,5.0783582089552235
1091186,5,6305918708,"While it might take several viewings to catch all the subtleties and connections, in the end, few films provide such rich rewards. Altman has enough confidence in the material and the actors to allow a ""free  form"" style to take place, thereby allowing for a more realistic,  spontaneous feel. Ambiguous enough to allow for multiple interpretations  yet focused and brimming with the sheer joy of filmmaking. What does it all  mean? Take your pick, but remember, such a film as this does not lend  itself to quick answers: fame, the American Dream, the cult of personality,  loneliness, passivity, the bankruptcy of American culture......they all  apply equally. For me, the best bet remains the general and widespread  despair (which translates into passivity) that defines American life (and  certainly resonated more in the 1970s post-Watergate environment). In an  intellectual vacuum where celebrities become the ruling class by sheer  virtue of their ubiquity and the politics of oversimplification create  hollow, yet appealing candidates, the population at large cede control over  their own lives to the gatekeepers of pop, that is ""banal,""  culture. Our emotions deadened and predictable, our minds enslaved to dogma  and superstition, and our hearts defined by passionless sex and forced  connection, we are tragically set in perpetual motion to find meaning...any  meaning that prevents a quick glance into the abyss.  Altman recognizes  this all too well. Using music to convey character and overlapping dialogue  to suggest how little we really listen to each other (and comprehend since  the very meaning of words is often in doubt). By the end, when the stunned  crowd sheepishly sings along to the lyrics ""You may say that I ain't  free, but it don't worry me,"" we realize what Altman has been pushing  us towards: the unsentimental and unavoidable conclusion that freedom, for  many of us, will always remain an abstraction and we are more than willing  to let others define it for us. Not knowing what it means, or ever could  mean, we foolishly cling to our artificial independence which is nothing  more than a vast accumulation of useless products and mass-produced goods.  Freedom, therefore, is seen solely in terms of economics, while our  creativity (which is intellectually based and is also related to the  artistic, expressive impulse) is ground beneath the feet of homogenization,  commodification, and distortion. What does this all mean? Quite simply,  ""Nashville"" elicits these thoughts because of its complexity. No  one meaning is correct and all viewers will bring something new to the  table. At the very least, the film stimulates higher thought, challenging  the notion that film is a passive entertainment. Unlike the characters in  the film, we can bring a willingness to move beyond the commonplace to our  viewing experience. How many films can do all this?",956793600,40,2900,5.237472766884531
