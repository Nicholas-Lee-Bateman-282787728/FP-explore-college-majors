6095245,5,B00GOFVED2,"Okay so I'm happy but... Why does it take so long for the seasons to be on Blu-ray and dvd? I mean isn't it on like season 5 or 6? And when is jake gonna be on the cover? I feel like this is what could've happened

Finn (S1)
Jake (S2)
BMO (S3 - good!)
Ice King (S4)
Princess Bubblegum (S5)
Marceline (S6, if happening/happened)
Lumpy Space Princess (S7 if happening)
and
Lady Rainicorn (S8, I'll stop here)",1384819200,5,406,4.205128205128205
6095246,5,B00GOFVED2,"I'm very glad that this DVD has been announced. First and foremost, I am excited that we don't have to wait until the summer to get this one (the last two DVDs were released in July 2012 and June 2013, respectively), and I hope that Cartoon Network will realize that they should start releasing the rest of the seasons soon!

From what I can tell, this set is very similar to the second season. It will include commentaries for all the episodes, as well as a mystery featurette (the details haven't been release on that yet). From what I've heard, Pendleton Ward and co. were trying really hard when they recorded the commentary to not have any ""orange juice"" moments (this was their code word for comments that were either spoilery or considered inappropriate), so I'm hoping the commentaries will be a bit better than they previously have been.

As for the show itself, this season is fantastic. While I don't think it's as good as the second or fourth season, this year was a big one for ""Adventure Time""; the introduction of Fionna and Cake, the revelation of the Ice King's backstory, and various holiday episodes made this year one to be remembered. Stand-out episodes include the aforementioned specials like ""Thank You"", ""From Bad to Worse"", ""Holly Jolly Secrets"", and ""Fionna and Cake"", as well as the sorta-controversial ""What Was Missing"" (the birth of Bubbline), the dark installments like ""The New Frontier"" and ""No One Can Hear You"", and finally, the introduction of Flame Princess in the finale, ""Incendium"".

This is a treat for all ""Adventure Time"" fans! Buy it, and hopefully we can get the rest soon!",1384646400,25,1619,4.795698924731183
6095247,2,B00GOFVED2,"GameBoy looking character with ""Engrish"" accent on cover. Joy! Not to mention the kid with bad teeth and the dog that sounds like Bender from Futurama.",1384646400,4,151,4.846153846153846
6095248,5,B00GOFVED2,"After we got the first two seasons, we didn't hear much for a while.  I feared we may not get more seasons, as Cartoon Network is very inconsistent with releases.  Today, my fears were put to rest.  The joy!  Especially suitable, since I've spent the last week watching my copies of the first two seasons!

Season three contains many great episodes, but also several of the most notable ones to date, including the popular Fionna and Cake episode.  Adventure Time is fully in stride this season.

Honestly, writing a review is kind of pointless.  If you've watched the first two seasons, you either love it and will be grabbing this no matter what I say, or you hate it, in which case you're probably not likely to read a review of season three.  So basically it doesn't really matter what I say.  BLEEP BLORP!

*ahem* but anyway, this release gets a preemptive five starts, and my hopes that Season 4, which includes even more of the series' best episodes, is just around the corner!",1384473600,19,984,4.597701149425287

I'm honestly not sure why the people on the commentary bonus feature were chosen, as they didn't seem to have much to say to eachother or about the show.

From my experience though, the cases they package these things in is very flimsy. Upon taking seasons 2 and 3 out of the plastic wrap, their cases immediately broke on me!

6095294,5,B00GOFVED2,"I love Adventure Time. I started watching it with my children, at my 11 year old son's urging. However, it has become a show I now watch on my own, over and over. I think, the underlying relationship between the primary characters (Finn and Jake), is a bond that makes the show so special. They genuinely care about each other - in a confusing, challenging, weird and non-linear world. Nothing makes traditional sense in the world of Ooo, but, underlying this weirdness are two characters facing the world with bravery, as sense of justice and compassion - even for their arch enemy. All the weirdness is just fun too.",1432166400,,618,4.678899082568807

Its almost like the writing and animation is just different... bland almost. Like...definitely intended for little kids. I liked this show because i could watch it with my 9 year old neice and enjoy it together. It was creative and silly...which i liked.

6095341,3,B00GOFVED2,"I love Adventure Time, and I was really looking forward to Season 3. However, I'm also a collector, and one of the things I love the most about the Adventure Time DVD sets is the ""layers"" theme: cardboard slipcover displays what the characters normally look like; the case underneath has the outer layer (Finn's clothes, Ice King's crwon/beard, BMO's case) removed, the inner leaflet has more (e.g., skin) removed, and the discs themselves have things like skulls and brains on them. It's a really nifty gimmick that makes the DVD boxes themselves works of art.

HOWEVER, the copy of Adventure Time: Season 3 I received from Amazon was missing the outer cardboard sleeve (the ""casing"" with all the gameboy-like buttons). I have the DVDs and DVD case, sure, but not BMO's outer skin. There is no way to keep his batteries from showing.

I returned the product, requesting a replacement, and noting what was missing. The replacement arrived and had the same problem.",1409875200,3,964,4.9079754601226995

6095351,3,B00GOFVED2,"Adventure Time is a five-star show but this is a disappointing blu-ray release. The picture is good but the soundtrack is sub-par. AT broadcasts with a 5.1 soundtrack; however, this blu-ray features only a DVD-quality 2.0 soundtrack.  No surround. No LFE. It's really disappointing.

Adventure Time is as sonically rich as it is visually rich, and I was hoping the blu-ray release would showcase that aspect of the show.

It turns out that many Cartoon Network blu-rays (such as The Regular Show and the prior AT releases) contain only low-quality 2.0 soundtracks. Sigh.

While I like that all the episodes fit on a single disc - perfect for marathoning it - I wish that there were more special features put into the disc. I also wish that when the play all feature is selected that every episode didn't play the opening theme. Each episode averages 10-11 minutes so hearing the theme song once every 10-11 minutes gets really old, really fast. Finally, the Ultraviolet copy can only be redeemed on Flixster, not Vudu.

I went ahead and purchased it through the Walmarts Site to Store feature and eventually picked it up the dvd after work. This was also partially due to the fact that my husband and I have been watching this cartoon since 2011 (yes, I know that we are both adults). Adventure Time Season 3 has 26 episodes and some bonus commentaries.  For instance, there is an interview of the creator of this series discussing his reasons for creating the cartoon in conjunction with many of those who comprise his viewing audience (parents,children, college students, many adults etc.).  The 26 episodes are based on the ones created around 2011. There are multiple episodes that will appeal to various people. For example, my husband enjoyed one of the Fiona and Cake episodes and mentioned that it would be interesting if more episodes and/or a spinoff season were created around Fiona and her cat.

Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo. As they go through one adventure after another, they interact with Princess Bubblegum, The Ice King, and Marceline the Vampire Queen.

Several episodes in this collection stand out. ""Thank You,"" nominated for an Annie Award as well as an award at the Sundance Film Festival, follows the exploits of a sensitive snow creature as he befriends a wolf puppy and tries to return it to its own kind. The story unfolds primarily in visuals.

""Too Young"" was nominated for an Emmy Award.  And ""Memory of a Memory"" and ""Marceline's Closet"" imaginatively play with perspective.

6095406,5,B00GOFVED2,"I've heard some people say that Adventure time jumped the shark with season three. I disagree completely.

Still, season three is a slightly different beast than the first two seasons. It has evolved from relying more on surreal, at times non-sequitur humor of season one, to really developing a world and the characters. Don't get me wrong, the quirky humor is still there, but the world building that occurs over the course of the first three seasons. For a cartoon that is not above the occasional fart joke, it creates a surprisingly rich universe and compelling characters. Season three features a wide range of emotion from laugh out-loud humor, to straight faced drama, often finding a happy medium between the two. There are even episodes with few jokes which are downright unnerving, though nothing that I think most kids couldn't handle emotionally.

Unlike many cartoons that are suck in one period of time, the characters do age and learn and grow as people. Just as Finn grows older, the show has changed as well. There are episodes that simply wouldn't have happened in season one or even in season two. And the show continues to evolve. There are episodes in seasons four and five that would never have worked the same in season three.

Adventure Time may not be a show for everyone. Some people may find it too much of a fast-paced sensory overload, but it also takes its time.  There are mysteries that may arise in one episode that may not be addressed until seasons later. This may be frustrating for some, but I find this aspect of the show one of the most enjoyable parts of it. It makes it worthwhile to rewatch previous episodes and look forward to what's to come.",1394064000,3,1687,4.708474576271186

I remember laughing quite hard the first time I saw ""Fionna and Cake"" (the series' first foray into gender-bending), and ""Thank You"" is an utterly touching episode about the power of friendship: it features a snow golem as he develops a friendship with a fire wolf.
