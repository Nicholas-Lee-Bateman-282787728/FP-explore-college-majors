8131742,5,B000GG4XZQ,"had heard about this documentary before i purchased, thought it was more of a general doc about the panthers, not one that focused more on dhoruba bin wassad; however, it was still pretty good, and i never really knew too much about wassad previously so it turned out to spark a different curiosity about getting to know and read wassad more.",1280707200,2,342,4.622950819672131
8131743,5,B000GG4XZQ,"This documentary is masterfully directed and edited including some remarkable historical footage of New York City from the 60's and 70's. While the story revolves around one persecuted individual, Dhoruba bin Wahad, formerly Richard Moore, and one group, The Black Panthers, the story of persecution and the struggle for truth and freedom is compelling and universal. I remember learning about the Black Panthers in Junior High Social Studies class in the mid-1970s. Until I saw this film, I had no idea their early mission had as much to do with feeding and mentoring children as it garnered self-esteem and unity to take a stand against racism and police excesses. The inclusion of FBI sponsored operations to contain the civil rights movement is breathtaking. This very powerful film presents a very different viewpoint from the story presented in my 1970s textbooks. It is distressing to see how Richard Moore was framed and sent to prison for nearly two decades for a crime he didn't commit. He is a compelling speaker. He tells of his persecution with poignancy all the while maintaining the powerful voice of a truthteller. The film never gets in the way of his very articulate voice. Rather, the film provides just the right amount of supporting materials to develop interest and understanding of the political and societal climate of that time. The editing is extremely sharp. The directing and production are exceptional. I highly recommend this film.",1196985600,15,1461,5.117154811715481
