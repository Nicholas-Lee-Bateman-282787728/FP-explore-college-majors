686773,5,6303589138,"Paul Mazursky, R.I.P. He was one of the greatest American directors who satirized and sympathized with America's canvas of social revolution in the 1960s and 70s. Tempest is one of his many films that traces a man in the midst of middle age who seeks a Utopia, ala, Prospero in Shakespeare's ""The Tempest,"" He finds a Greek island and moves there, with his daughter. A  Caliban figure is hired, and an assortment of humanity gather. Finally his wife joins him.

In the course of this Mazursky explores the impossibility of Utopia, that it really means ""Nowhere"" after all is said and done, and marriage is its opposite..it is somewhere where you don't want to be, especially if it's American engineered, with all the money, bright kids, posh, schools, great Hampton Beach house..this is the end of experience, and Mazursky tells it with a deft hand, never ever condemning, but sympathizing with the plight of civilization as it hobbles toward death.

Buy this. Gene Rowlands is great, John Cassavetes is splendid..all score highly. Raul Julia fantastic!
1982 film, many of the actors are gone now, as is Paul Mazusky..He knew the value of art, that without it this world is unbearable.",1404259200,2,1185,4.915

I tend to like odd little films like this, especially when well acted, directed, and filmed. Given the level of the actors involved, it is worth it just for watching them ply their trade. I saw it ages ago on cable, and recently added it to my Susan Sarandon collection.

686915,3,6303589138,"Based extremely loosely (as was 1956's ""Forbidden Planet"") on Shakespeare's
final play ""The Tempest,"" this movie by the renowned Paul Mazursky rambles along
for 142 minutes and never really adds up to a satisfying story experience.
The John Cassavetes N.Y.C. architect protagonist has got it all (success, beautiful
home, lovely wife and daughter), but insists he hates his life, and escapes with
daughter and his new girlfriend Susan Sarandon (looking wonderful in a wet shirt)
to a desolate Greek island.  The magic isle is only inhabited by goats and a crazy,
lustful hermit played by Raul Julia, who desperately wants to deflower the 14
year-old daughter (Molly Ringwald).  He invites her to watch ""Gunsmoke"" in his cave.

  Eventually, the enchanted isle imparts magic powers to the architect, who
summons a tempest (well done) to sink the yacht of the big gangster (Vittorio
Gassman) who is wooing Cassavetes' (movie/real life) wife, Gena Rowlands.  Along
with some others, they wash ashore to accept the hospitality of the Greek-
American ""magus."" Goat steaks, anyone?

All of this plays out at a very leisurely pace, with many odd digressions, but it
seems to conclude suddenly, with many plot threads unresolved.  Were there yet
more scenes near the end that were scrapped?  ""Tempest"" is a drama that is not
very dramatic, and a comedy that is not very comedic.  The very talented cast
does their best with story material that is shapeless.  It makes you wonder if
Mazursky was trying to make some kind of ""cult movie"" that would develop a big
reputation.  The reviewer here who said it got better after two pitchers of beer
had a point.  Personally, they could have reduced the scenes in N.Y.C. and
Atlantic City to fifteen minutes, and the film would have been much improved.
I want to praise the cinematography of Donald McAlpine, who captures the amazing
beauty of this parched, hilly island and the blue-green Aegean Sea.  ""Tempest""
is at least visually a splendid film-- try seeing it on a really big screen.",1312761600,,2023,4.964391691394659

Stomu Yamashta's music blew me away. It's a shame he has not scored that many movies. It's a greater shame the soundtrack isn't available on CD, though I have one I transferred from the LP. Great movie and a very reasonable price for this rare video.",1303603200,,411,4.421052631578948
686918,5,6303589138,"It is impossible for me to understand why this film is not considered one of greatest ever made.  I think it has something to do with the fact that Paul Mazursky never spent any money on promting his films.  It stars John Cassavetes but his wife Gena Rowlands out shines all but one character.

The cast is the best bunch of actors I have ever seen assembled to play their characters.  Besides Cassavetes and Rowlands, are Susan Saradon, Molly Ringwald in what may be her first performance, Vittorio Gassman, and Sam Robards.

I said that Gena Rowlands out shines everyone but one character and that is RAUL JULIA.  This is absolutely the best I have ever seen him.  He owns this film from the moment he is on camera to the moment he is off camera.  You will fall hopelessly in love with him.

The sound track by Stomu Yamashta will grab you from the first note and haunt you for weeks.  You will walk around humming the sound track.

If you enjoy Gena Rowlands in this film, check out Another Woman by Woody Allen, A Woman Under the Influence by her husband John Cassavetes which also stars Peter Falk, And Opening Night starring Gena and John who also wrote and directed the film.

I promise that once you are hooked on the Mazursky-Cassavetes creations you will want to own all of them.

686950,5,6303589138,"In the early 80's I read a glowing review of this  film in Rolling Stone Magazine.  Since it promised Susan Sarandon (who I only new as Janet Weiss from Rocky Horror) in a bathing suit, it made the must see list. I saw it with a date in a Gainesville, Fla movie house that actually served beer by the pitcher.  The second pitcher was empty just about the same time the goats began flying overhead in time to Liza Minelli's rendition of ""New York, New York"", and I realized I was watching something special.
Flash forward 20 odd years.  I'm middle-aged myself, I've read Shakespear's The Tempest a half dozen times and have seen it on stage and in the theatre in numerous renditions, and Susan Sarandon, Molly Ringwold, and Raul Julia are now household names. The movie is out on DVD and I have watched it three times in the past three nights.
Even without the beer, I can honestly say this is a great, though overlooked movie.  The acting is first rate.  The production is wonderful. And the Script is VERY smart.
I think you need some familiarity with The Bard's version of The Tempest to really appreciate this movie.  Sheakespeare wrote of and in a time of witches and faries and spirits.  To make this movie work, the screenwriter (Mazurski) had to translate these creatures and characters into modern-day creations.  The ""Monster"" Calaban, becomes Raul Julia's Calabano, a modern day ""monster"" who lusts after little girls, but settles for livestock.  Prospero the Magician is transformed into a middle aged architect who in his crazziness believes he can control the weather and perhaps can.  The King himself becomes the CEO of a Company and his court  is transformed into an entourage of a lawyer, a doctor, and a stand-up comedian.. Ariel the Fairy, is Aretha, Susan Sarandon's character, a middleeastern night club singer from New Jersey who, like Ariel in the original, loves and hates and is imprisoned by and fails to consumate her love with Prospero.
The action swings back and forth between a greek island and the Island of Manhattan.  This is the 1980s. New York is not very pretty. The World Trade Center is front and center. Atlantic City is under construction. Against this backdrop, the Actors act and sing and dance and have a good time.
Read The Tempest and then see this movie.
I can picture Sheakespeare smiling while watching this version of his play.",1214870400,5,2376,4.737864077669903

686953,3,6303589138,"In this loose (emphasis on loose, for sure) adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest, John Cassevetes takes on the Prospero role for all it's worth and delivers a piercing performance as Philip Demetrios, successful architect with a failed marriage. He moves with his daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald in her first film appearance) to a Greek island where he meets the beautiful Aretha Tomalin (Susan Sarandon in the Ariel role) and promptly hooks up with her, as they say.

On hand as well is Raul Julia as Calibanos, a goatherd who exhibits one of the more representative characteristics of ""goatness"", namely, lust, but also evokes Zorba in his dancing, his use of the term ""boss"" to refer to Phil, and other stuff; he's utterly convincing as a Greek native. His name is the obvious link to the Shakespeare character.

At 140 minutes, this does tend to ramble in a number of places. But Cassevetes, Sarandon, and Julia are strong enough actors to carry it and make it shine in more places than it rambles. Cassevetes' real-life wife Gena Rowlands is also here as his movie wife; their marriage breaks up, the impetus for his flight to Greece. Rowlands is also very good, as is Vittorio Gassman as Rowlands' new lover--who, as it turns out, is Phil's boss in New York City before Phil's departure. The director, Paul Mazursky, shows up as a movie producer (big stretch...).

If you don't mind a laid back script that lets the characters talk about a lot of stuff that is not necessarily punchy, then this is the movie for you. It's not bad, but in my opinion, could have been tightened up by at least 20 minutes, more like half an hour. Not bad at all--but not great.",1186617600,12,1667,4.7020547945205475

686981,2,6303589138,"Being a Shakespeare fan since junior high, I went to see this movie with my mother and my sister when it came out.

I had read The Tempest in my big heavy annotated tome of all Shakespeare's plays. I had seen stage versions of other Shakespearean plays moved from the traditional Elizabethan era to other eras. I had high hopes for this version since I had never seen the The Tempest acted before.

I was disappointed in this version at the time I saw it. I will admit, I found this movie confusing. The play has dark elements and that is what is emphasized in this movie version of the play. The Tempest is supposed to be a comedy but I did not find this movie funny at all.

On the other hand, it did not put me to sleep like some other movie versions of Shakespeare have done.  It's an interpretation of The Tempest that makes you think (which is why one doesn't fall asleep) instead of laugh. After seeing this movie, I decided that maybe I just did not care for this particular Shakespearean play.

It didn't stink but I did not enjoy myself.

Years later, I saw a live stage production of The Tempest using stage trained actors rather than movie actors. It was very funny and not at all confusing.

So I have given this 2 stars because I was not bored to sleep but I have seen a much better version on stage than this movie interpretation.",1173571200,5,1345,4.313492063492063

I'd like to add to the list  of wonderful scenes another reviewer  started: 1) the 'Dozing Scene'  with the shot of sky through the trees, the hammock by the sea, and  the little goat springing along then suddenly going to sleep; and 2) the 'Leaping Goats' scene.  The intertwining of the two story timelines worked really well, great Greek scenery,  and glimpses of early 80's New York City too, including the now lost World Trade Center. Gena Rowlands and Susan Sarandon were both fine in their roles as well. Raul Julia's Calibanos was more Latin American than Greek but I enjoyed his character anyway. Molly Ringwald's first film role--I thought she was cute. The second half of the film, after everyone joins up on the Greek island is a bit of let down, though, and the sacrifice scene didn't really make much sense to me.",1013904000,5,1146,4.6716417910447765

The story has dual timelines which eventually meet at the present day. This was a new experience for me when first seeing this movie.
Some of the many memorable scenes are:
John Cassavetes looking up at the baloons falling during the New Years Day party and making the decision to get the hell out of there.
The Greek captain of the ship taking them to their island calling out the names of the dozens of Greek islands.
Raoul Julia dancing around with an octopus on his head.
Also Raoul admitting that he wants to sleep with Cassavetes daughter saying 'She wants the Bonnie Johnnie inside of her'. Cassavetes fights him and probably considers killing him but stops.
Cassavetes' wife happens to be floating near the island as an entouragee of a Greek tycoon ala Jacqueline Kennedy Onasis. Cassavetes conjures a storm with his reading glasses saying ""Come on, show me the magic.""
To me this is the pinnacle of Cassavetes journey to find himself, fancies himself a god, and makes the magic happen only to regret his actions but assist in rescuing the party.

The island in Greece is gorgeous and there's an eerie view of the New York skyline in an electrical storm, with the twin towers gleaming in the light, as well as another scene that takes place at the WTC. We will no doubt be haunted by the sight in films for years to come. The score by Stomu Yamashta is also wonderful.
Paul Mazursky (who plays Bloomfield the producer, with his real life wife Betsy as Mrs. Bloomfield) has an incredible knack for casting his films, and this is an ensemble that works perfectly. Everyone shines, perhaps Raul Julia, with his priceless dance to ""New York, New York"", the most.

The editing is extremely poor, and the transposition of Shakespeare to these New Yorkers is extremely daft. And, to boot, you get two and a half hours of this -- at least an hour too long! The ""comedy"" of Jackie Gayle is offensive, to say the least, and none of the other characters generate any interest at all. Molly Ringwold comes across well, but none of the other characters display any psychological motivations other than acting out shtick and squealing at each other. The ""sacrifice"" scene makes no sense given the character Cassavetes has built -- but then none of the characters have any ""real"" motivations at all. It doesn't even track with Shakespeare.

7851021,4,6303589138,"Released in 1982 and loosely based on Shakespeare's play, Tempest stars John Cassavetes as Phillip, a rich architect in a troubled marriage in New York City. When his wife (Gena Rowlands) decides to return to acting and things blow-up, he escapes to Greece with his daughter (Molly Ringwald), where they unite with a free-spirited singer (Susan Sarandon). Meanwhile, Phillips wife hooks up with his former boss (Vittorio Gassman) and they come to Greece looking for the daughter. Raul Julia plays an eccentric goatherd on the island while Sam Robards appears as a teen lothario.

While Im sure the Greece cinematography would be spectacular on the big screen (it certainly is on the small screen), Tempest isn't a film Id likely want to see in the theater (it flopped at the box office). Yet it works fine as a likably offbeat drama in the home.

If you're a Sarandon fan youll definitely want to check this out because shes in the prime of her life (35 years-old during filming) and is splendidly portrayed by the director, Paul Mazursky, from the get-go, typically in alluring Mediterranean apparel. Likewise, statuesque Lucianne Buchanan appears in the final act as blond Delores. This was Ringwalds debut. She was fine for the meaty role of the daughter, but I was never enthralled by her, which isn't to say I don't like her. Actually, Im not enamored by any of these women, but they're all certainly agreeable, one way or another.

There are several highlights, like Phillip coming home drunk to his wifes showbiz party where he awkwardly asks her producer (director Paul Mazursky) to dance. Needless to say, its the epitome of an uncomfortable social situation. The best part about Tempest, however, is that its essentially an island flick, although the cast aren't necessarily castaways and the island is a little bit North of the tropics. If you're a sucker for island flicks, like me, then Tempest is worth checking out. It's uniquely entertaining and somehow warmhearted.

I realize Phillip (Cassavetes) is the Prospero character from The Bards play, and Prospero was a magician, but the movie never explains Phillips seeming ability to control the elements. Were just supposed to accept it. Why sure! In any case, I presume hes projecting his mental-spiritual struggles on to the forces of nature.

For those not in the know, Cassavetes and Rowlands were husband & wife for almost 36 years, which ended with the formers passing in 1989 at 59 years-of-age. He died of cirrhosis of the liver.

The film runs 142 minutes was shot in New York City; Atlantic City, NJ; and, mostly, Gytheio, Greece, which isn't an island, but the southern tip of the remote Mani peninsula of the Peloponnesus of Greece. WRITERS: Leon Capetanos & Mazursky.
