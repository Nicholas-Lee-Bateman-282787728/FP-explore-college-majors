I was living in NYC in the 1960s when he was on-the-air with a kid's show on WNEW-TV (Channel 5) where he said (jokingly, of course), ""Hey kids, go through your mommy's purse or your daddy's wallet and send me all of the pieces of green paper you find, and I'll send you a postcard from Puerto Rico!""

He never got any money (he wasn't seeking any) but the station canned him until it was discovered that little kids were watching cartoons on another station, while his own audience consisted of high school and college kids (who picketed Channel 5, demanding his reinstatement).

He was put back on the air and re-tuned his show to aim his sophisticated comedy at a much larger (and considerably OLDER) audience.

This video represents a compilation of some of his BEST skits and stunts, including a scene where Soupy smacks guest Frank Sinatra with a pie (and lives to talk about it).",1381276800,,971,4.531428571428571
7814939,2,6301783522,"Soupy Sales was one of the funniest guys on 60's TV, but you'd never know it from this short video.  I loved his show as a kid.  He'd open his back door to find a speeding locomotive coming at him, he'd get hit in the face with a pie, somebody would be poking their arm through his window making a point.  Pookie would get upset.  Maybe my memory overplays how good he was, but I still can't help feeling you give me a day with a few of his old tapes and I'll give you a better selection than this.  As Black Tooth might say, Ruhhhh Rohhhh.  Great show, poor clips.",1055721600,13,565,4.045045045045045

Poor quality video, little or no editing. An insult to a great comedian.  Save your money. The only reason it got a one, was for SOUPY.",964137600,21,279,4.264150943396227
