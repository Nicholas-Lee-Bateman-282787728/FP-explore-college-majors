6790918,4,B00P8RUNIO,"Here it is.  The third season of ""Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends"" is now on DVD whether you've waited for too long or otherwise.  You'll get these episodes and then some such as:

""Eddie Monster"" - To prove he's not a wimp, Eduardo signs up for the big Extremosaur fight competition, and things get hairier than Ed himself.
""Hiccy-Burp"" - Blooregard gets a case of the hiccups and all before the big Imaginary Friend Pageant, too.  However, those hiccups might help Bloo rather than hinder him from winning.
""Duchess of Wails"" - That arrogant stuck-up Duchess has been finally adopted !  Unfortunately, the family that adopted her lives a couple doors down Mac's apartment !
""Imposter's Home for, um... Make 'Em Up Pals"" - Frankie becomes suspicious of some guy posing as an imaginary friend, and she won't rest until she knows for sure.
""Foster's Goes to Europe"" - Mac and the gang win a European vacation, but everyone is not ready and that's not the half of it.
""Go Goo Go"" - A spunky girl named Goo has made countless imaginary friends that eventually overcrowd the house.  Mac, being the one responsible for inviting her in the house, has to do something about it.
""Land of the Flea"" - Eduardo get fleas that he instantly befriends, but Frankie and Mr. Herriman will not allow it.  But no one else knows those fleas are actually imaginary ones.
""Setting a President"" - Frankie challenges the unopposed Mr. Herriman for house president.  Frankie wins by a landslide leaving the big bunny jobless.
""Room with a Feud"" - A vacant room in the house causes a big argument between Wilt, Ed, Coco, and Bloo.
""A Lost Claus"" (Bonus Episode) - Mac tries to prove the existence of Santa Claus to Bloo who's in it for the Christmas presents.

One more thing about this set, it will work in most DVD players, and it might not work in PCs or other devices because it's a little different compared to previous sets on account of it's manufactured on demand.  Course it's even more different if you had an imaginary friend that plays DVDs, but that's another thing entirely.",1420502400,11,2067,4.669421487603306

6790920,4,B00P8RUNIO,"First of all, I'm proud that they released this DVD for Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. This set overall is okay. It is manufactored at amazon.com. It doesn't include a booklet for a list of episodes for this series and what it's about. The only special feature it includes is this episode from season 3 which they made it ""Special"" because it is like a christmas episode, ""The lost claus."" This doesn't have a song in the menus and it is DVR from amazon, which is purple on the disc.

8686995,5,B00P8RUNIO,"Please Amazon won't you please release seasons 4,5 and 6 of this great cartoon?  I think Craig McCracken was and is one of the greatest creators of cartoon network shows.  This show just had it all; humor, imagination and a wonderful cast of imaginary friends.  Please consider this review and I hope this might persuade you to get the fans our last 3 seasons.
