391278,5,6301971280,"Put together June Allyson, Margaret O'Brien, and MGM and what have you got?  A classic masterpiece called Little Women.  Through triumphs and tears, you follow as the March sisters endure what life has given them.  There is only one thing that could have possibly made this picture any  better.  Jo and Laurie need to end up together!!!  So, does everyone agree  with that??  I thought so! June Allyson, as Jo March, gives one of the  finest performances in her legendary career.  This is a 7 hanky movie!  So  get your box of kleenex (by Kimberly Clark), a big bowl of popcorn, and  enjoy the movie!  We highly recommend Little Women for your viewing  pleasure.",918777600,3,662,4.684210526315789

391332,3,6301971280,"Review of Little Women
Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

Ive seen every version of Little Women out there, and while the 1949 adaptation has its good points, its not my favorite. June Allyson, cast in the lead as Jo, just isn't likable. Shes not a very good actress, and its not at all believable that shes living in the 1800s. It feels like shes the understudy during her third rehearsal; Katharine Hepburn breathes infinitely more passion into the role in the 1933 version.

The good parts of this remake are Margaret OBrien as Beth and Elizabeth Taylor as Amy. Who would have thought Liz would look stunning as a blonde? Shes just adorable in this movie, but unfortunately doesnt have a very big part. Margaret OBrien is by far my favorite of the Beths; shes endearing and believable, and unlike some actresses (Im looking at you Jean Parker and Claire Danes!) shes actually the right age for the part. The iconic scene when Beth thanks Mr. Laurence, played by veteran C. Aubrey Smith in this version, for the piano is a tearjerker. In no other version do I even get a lump in my throat during that scene.

If you really love this story and are intent on seeing every version out there, go ahead and rent this one. But if you're looking for the best version, rent the 1933 Katharine Hepburn adaptation. June Allyson just ruins this movie.",1500422400,,1338,4.566666666666666

391375,5,6301971280,In 1949 two of my sisters and I watched this movie at the old Miller theater in Anadarko Oklahoma. We sat through the movie four times.

391376,5,6301971280,"This is the film version I grew up with.  My sister and I would wait for it to come on around Christmas time on our local channel and we always sat glued to the TV when it made its annual appearance.  I have seen the 1994 version and I did like that very much as well, but I still feel that this 1949 version was perfectly cast with June Allyson, Janet Leight, Elizabeth Taylor and Margaret O'Brien.  What a cast!  It is very faithful to the book, except, of course, in the book Amy is the youngest, and here it is Beth.  From what I understand, the studio that made this film really wanted Margaret O'Brien cast, and that's what they did-switched Beth and Amy, and I for one, think it works perfectly.  The cinematography is beautiful and Peter Lawford as Laurie is just heartbreaking when he professes his love to Jo.  I think even in one of the final scenes, when he returns from Europe with Amy as his bride, you can still see the love he has for Jo.  Wonderful version that I will watch all the time.  I have it on my ipad and my iphone so when I'm stuck on public transportation, I can be transported back to Concord and my Little Women.",1484524800,8,1143,4.2304147465437785

This is the 1949 adaption and I think that they did  much better casting this that they did the 1933 version, but it could have been better.  Lucille Watson is perfect as Aunt March and I also like Mary Astor as Marmee, although I think she was too young for the role.  I think that both Peter Lawford and C. Aubrey Smith were excellent in their roles.  I think that June Allysons portrayal of Jo was better than Katharine Hepburns and Elizabeth Taylor does not look as washed out as a blonde as Joan Bennett did.  I enjoyed Ellen Corbys portrayal of Sophie.  However, I think that casting Margaret as Beth was the wrong choice.  In all performances, excluding her accent in Jane Eyre, her mannerisms and her acting are the same for each character. I feel that Natalie Wood would have given a much better performance.  Also, while Rossano Brazzi was okay as Professor Bhaer I think that newcomer Paul Henreid would have been much better.",1462147200,,1053,4.5

391622,4,6301971280,"Agreeing...This 1949 version with fine actors also captures the warmth that still makes the book ""Little Women"" beloved.

And even tho Beth is portrayed in the movie as ""younger"" than Amy, I always seemed to think of Beth as actually younger anyway...so it seems to make sense as Beth does not move beyond young girl (to become interested in boys, dances like Amy did, for instance).

June Allyson is better than Katharine Hepburn *as ""Jo March"". To me, Hepburn seems a tad too sophisticated for the rule.  June Allyson seems to have a vulnerability that Hepburn lacked. (I generally thought Hepburn was not that great in her early roles...but she matured wonderfully into a superior actress).

Sir C. Aubrey Smith is wonderful as the crusty old Grandfather...with the heart of gold. He and the other cast members do their jobs so well!",1449273600,,895,4.900662251655629

Those who have the movie but dissed it without seeing it, you're missing out. I saw the newer version I didn't like it, one the girls ages are too old to be called little women. two the storyline is mixed up,like Beth goes into her seizure a little early, give the 1949 edition a chance before you diss it. It has beauty, grace, and alot of heart and humor. If you knew the cast you'd like it more, Elizabeth Taylor plays Amy, Margaret O brien plays Beth who played beside Garland, June Allyson plays Jo and for those that wondered yes that is Jamie Lee Curtis's Mother. And Janet Leah, soon beautiful and talented. so, yeah reconsider your remark about it. You'll have a change of heart afterwards I promise you that.",1428278400,,952,4.259668508287293

But these ladies did their sex good by being virtuous at least in the movie. Can't say that their privates lives were anything to rave about even back then especially ET.

392076,3,6301971280,"Whether or not this works for you depends entirely on if you like June Allyson, as she is the sole focal point in this film.  As far as I can see, it's a contest as to who delivers the most artificial performance, Allyson or Margaret O'Brien; both are pointedly deliberate in their portrayals.  In any regard, this is high melodrama so realism has no part in it.  Elizabeth Taylor, on the other hand, as Amy March, was at least fun to watch playing an unrepentant self-centered ninny who constantly ate but never grew fat (there's a neat trick!).  And Mary Astor as Marmee March is always elegant and grand.  For the most part, the rest of the cast is there primarily to serve as June Allyson's foils; they don't get much of an opportunity to shine on their own as she hogs the film from start to finish.  Not being a fan of hers, I found it difficult to watch her strutting about trying to be a tomboy but coming across as a bully instead, one who rode roughshod over her entire family.  It was Jo's way or the highway.  (Never having read the book, I have no idea if the character was meant to be this controlling/abrasive).  At any rate, June Allyson manages to make Josephine March quite unpleasant indeed.",1388188800,,1210,4.4389140271493215

I know Peter Lawford was pretty much a joke in Hollywood from all the horrible movies he was in but he was a ""spot on"" Laurie in this. Perfect for the role and he did a wonderful job. Same for June Allyson who made a lot of bad or so-so movies but she was a perfect Jo. Margaret O'Brien, the little professional cryer actress, simply IS Beth - perfect. Elizabeth Taylor managed to convey Amy's vanity and selfishness while showing the changes in her as she gets older. A very believable performance start to finish.  I gave the version with Winona Ryder the lowest score you can give a movie on Amazon and it was truly terrible. In that review I refer people to the June Allyson version.

392246,5,6301971280,"What a lovely version of this fine story with its old fashioned picture postcard opening and ending shots.  This is a standalone film, having its own interest and features.  It carries the addition of color, excellent cinematography and MGM's noted style overall well tailored to the charm of the period and setting.  I don't mind any of the film looking good or how they did it; it's part of the treat of this version.  It's casting and performances have their own flavor as well, personal standouts for me being Peter Lawford the best I've ever seen him, a very nuanced and effective (if over made up) Amy, a stellar Beth, and even a more prominent and pleasing family maid. (She had been with them since Meg was a baby.)  They probably switched the ages of the two younger girls due to the suitability for the roles of the players they had available under contract.

Being a lover of warm hearted movies, old fashioned classics and family stories, this one is really a rose. I can see why Laurie envied the family's togetherness when the lamps are lit and he can see inside their cozy parlor.  It's a bright and resourceful family, whose ups and downs engage both interest and heart.  That rates far higher to me than being able to spot various inconsistencies, painted backdrops, et al.  Realistically portrayed in the film, they bickered and complained as well as worked together harmoniously.  It's somehow possible to feel a part of it all as it goes along, an experience one delights in repeating.  That's certainly a strong and inviting element of movie watching and perhaps a mark of a successful film.",1355270400,,1612,4.7214285714285715

392253,3,6301971280,"OK, there's probably no need to go into any detail about the story. You all probably know Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy by now, anyway. This movie sticks close to the book in most ways, but they did do something strange: Margaret O'Brien, who plays Beth, is smaller and shorter, and presumably younger than Amy as played by Elizabeth Taylor. Also, there are few people who have ever imagined Elizabeth Taylor as a blond!

Peter Lawford does a great job as Laurie, and Rossano Brazzi is positively romantic as Professor Bhaer. In fact, it really is a great cast, with everyone looking very much like I would have imagined them as I read the story for the first time, except for what seems like a switch of Beth and Amy's ages. If the two actresses were in fact in the right relative ages for their parts, I would find this no problem at all. But it is distracting. Perhaps we are to understand that Beth, being very frail, has simply not thrived the way Amy has. They are not that far apart in age, and I was taller than my older sister from the time I was about five.

This one is in color, which makes it more pleasant to watch than the earlier one with Kate Hepburn. But some of the backgrounds are awfully fake looking, especially the one where Laurie corners Jo out in the country after she ran off from Meg's wedding. I could swear that was a painted backdrop!

On the whole, a good movie and a pretty faithful rendition of the book. I would give it four stars if it weren't for the above-discussed casting question",1337385600,,1512,4.3736654804270465

However, if you're a romantic and have a sentimental streak, then you're going to love this little slice of Americana! This is a very sentimental movie that celebrates family and life! I think it's good for the soul to occasionally watch films that show humans at their best and most caring and this movie delivers that in spades. This is about the March family and their trials and tribulations during the Civil War.
June Allyson plays tomboyish and idealistic, Josephine (Jo) March, to perfection, so much so, that you forget that she's acting! By the time this film was made she had already become a star, but it's interesting to watch a young Janet Leigh as very proper, Meg, just on the verge of stardom, and Elizabeth Taylor, as Amy, the vain one, making the transition from child actress to the Mega Superstar that she would become. Margaret O'Brien as the ""cricket on the hearth"", Beth, had the ability to turn on the tears at will, and yours too! Unfortunately for her, she was not able to make the transition to adult actress. Mary Astor as, ""Marme"" is very good, as well as Peter Lawford as rich but lonely, Laurie, whose love for Jo is never fully reciprocated.

Get this movie, and if you want a more affordable copy, look for the TCM collection of 4 movies, that this is included in.  Excellent transfer, and each film in this collection is on a separate DVD.

392296,3,6301971280,"The best version of ""Little Women"" is, quite simply, the book.  Alcott lets you see and hear all the characters as if you were watching them on a screen.  Reading the book, you forget who you are and where you are.  You become part of the March family, and no reproduction on film or on stage will EVER take you where Louisa May herself does.  However, two out of the three movie versions of ""Little Women"" are worth seeing.  The best one beyond any doubt is the oldest one.  It didn't try to strut its stuff.  There was a sincere effort to bring Alcott's original characters and settings to life.  The second version lacked that sincerity.  It aspired to be funnier and livlier than the book and the Hepburn film. As a result,it failed.  But it didn't fail miserably.  You can still have a good time watching June Allison as Jo.  Watch out, though, when you come to Winona Ryder!  I love the part where she cuts her hair, and we're all supposed to feel the pain because Jo's mane was her ""one beauty.""  Come on!  Wynona Ryder was nothing but drop-dead gorgeous in that film.  In other words, she wasn't Jo!  Then there was the phony scene (not in the book, of course) where Marmie gives young Mr. Brooks a lecture on the negative effects of corsets.  Wow, how plucky and liberated Susan Sarandon was!  But was she Marmie?  Not even close!  Marmie didn't discuss underwear with young men or even with her daughters, to my knowledge.  She was too busy helping the poor and showing her girls how to be brave while their dad was away with the Union Army.  Plus, she was a Victorian woman--not a controversial guest on a TV talk show!
  Stick with the book.  You can't lose.  See the movies for entertainment, but you have to return to the source for the real experience.  As for opera version which followed Wynona...God help me, I just couldn't go there.",1309478400,4,1852,4.4640718562874255

Liz imho did especially well in her role and kept blinking my eyes thinking this could not possibly be her given her typical over the top annoying voice and affected movements, bravo but what happened to her later performances... I really enjoyed this film and it's lovely warm feel but I was so bothered by Jo selling her hair to buy Marmee's train ticket as they were so financially compromised... get rid of the MAID fer cryin out loud, all she seemed to do was wring her hands. You have FIVE women and no one can do the dishes or cook or clean?? They have to risk their lives with Scarlet Fever ridden children to pay for the help?

Just amazing, she was perfect at such a young age as an actress then that she certainly lived up to her reputation as the last of the old time greats. All in all, the movie was of a time and age that in my mind was make believe , after all the country was in a bloody war for everyone to be so nice to each other. Yet they were far removed from the front.  The other actors were very good, but Elizabeth Taylor shone even at that age.

392301,4,6301971280,"Aside from the legendary Katharine Hepburn-George Cukor 1933 RKO version, this is probably my personal favourite film adaptation of the Louisa May Alcott story.  Filmed in glowing Technicolor, and using many of the 1933's original set and costume designs, it provides a nice showcase for the always popular pairing of June Allyson and Peter Lawford (those cute co-eds from ""Good News"").

Controversy has always dogged MGM's 1949 colour remake, chiefly for it's casting.  Whilst her teenage years were well and truly behind her when she landed the role of Jo, it's hard to imagine the role being played by anybody other than June Allyson.  She was MGM's ""go-to"" girl for such assignments in that period.  Likewise, Elizabeth Taylor's role of Amy - in a none-too-flattering blonde wig - has always been unfairly dismissed as one of the rare missteps in Taylor's film resume, but when you look back at the depiction of Amy in the book and then refer again to Taylor's performance, it sits quite comfortably.  Peter Lawford's casting as Laurie is quite charming.  Laurie is such a cardboard character in this version (less so but still quite stiff in the 1933 movie); Lawford does what he can to enliven the character.

The ""veterans"" of the cast add some depth - Mary Astor is a brilliantly-understated Marmee and Lucile Watson is crabby old Aunt March.  Margaret O'Brien once again cries until the cows come home as frail, doomed Beth.  For whatever reason, the ages of Amy and Beth were switched from the book; this version depicts Beth as the youngest, mainly because Ms O'Brien could never visually pass as the older sister of Elizabeth Taylor.  Dramatically it also works quite well, as Beth being the ""baby"" of the family illustrates further her weak health situation.

Lovers of the 1933 film will find some scenes (right down to the sets and actors' blocking) are copied almost verbatim in this version!  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; I wonder if George Cukor ever picked up on the fact that he also ""directed"" the 1949 remake by osmosis?  There is however one charming scene that the 1949 version possesses which is all it's own, and it's the one where the girls visit the general store to buy Christmas gifts with their $1 from Aunt March.  Presumably it replaces the delightful parlour pantomime ""The Witch's Curse"" from the 1933 version.

For all it's shortcomings, the film is beautifully shot, lovingly put together; and despite a hefty 2-hour running time, clips along at a very brisk pace.  LITTLE WOMEN fans are recommended.",1295136000,2,2553,4.913752913752914

392349,4,6301971280,"The classic Victorian novel ""Little Women"" has been filmed quite a few times over the past century; out of the lot there are four noteworthy adaptations, dating from 1933, 1949, 1978, and 1994. I don't think there really is a definitive version; each film adaptation has its own strengths and weaknesses.

This evening I viewed the 1949 version, and I'd say it's a solid, though perhaps unexceptional, film. It's certainly gorgeous to look at, getting the glossy MGM Technicolor treatment typical of the period. And the casting isn't bad for the most part; the four girls are played by Janet Leigh (Meg), June Allyson (Jo), Elizabeth Taylor (Amy), and Margaret O'Brien (Beth), with Laurie portrayed by Peter Lawford. I suppose the primary drawback to the casting is that they all seem too old for their parts (with the exception of Margaret O'Brien); June was only 11 years younger than Mary Astor, who played her mother! The only real dud was Richard Wyler as John Brooke, though there has been considerable debate among fans about Elizabeth Taylor's acting in this---some people think she was great, and others think she was simply terrible. I suppose I'm somewhere in the middle regarding her performance, but I will say that her blonde wig wasn't particularly convincing.

(Speaking of hair, the one rather glaring anachronism was Jo's hairstyle---with her bangs, she looked very modern to me. After I watched the film I even did little research on 1860's hairstyles, and I see they were rather severe as a rule, with not a bang in sight---hair parted in the centre and pulled back tightly was the rule of the day.)

This movie really was more of a remake of the 1933 version, rather than a completely new screenplay using the original novel as its source. Even the main musical themes used in the background scoring were taken from the older film. Oh, there's nothing wrong with that, but it might have been nice to see a fresher take on the story.

It was a decent enough film, but for me there was an indefinable something that was missing---it didn't really draw me in on an emotional level. June (as Jo) was pretty good, though I have to say that I still think the very best Jo was young Katharine Hepburn, back in 1933. And out of the four films, the 1994 version remains my favourite.

Still, this is worth a viewing for anyone with an interest in golden age Hollywood, or the original Lousia May Alcott story, and I'll recommend it.

(I couldn't help but notice that every film version of Little Women that I've ever seen has had extremely similar interior/exterior sets for the March family home. That's because the set designers in each case used Orchard House, the real Alcott family home, as their inspiration.)",1271462400,,2727,4.779193205944798

392352,1,6301971280,"Okay, I grew up under and Alcott obsessed mother.  So, from an early age, I was taught to ""respect"" four little women....  And then, I saw this movie (on TV, thank heaven I didn't pay for it!), and it nearly ripped away all my respect for the storyline.  I confess, I lay much of the blame for this on the peculiar casting choice of June Allyson in the lead as Jo.  Her acting is mediocre, she really doesn't ring true as Jo.  While some other actresses do seem to do a fine job, the whole production lacks a certain depth.  While I'll never reach my mom's level of adoration for all-thing-Alcott, I do agree that 'Little Women' is far worthier than this production suggests.  If you are in more mood for movie than book, let me recommend either the Wynona Ryder or Katherine Hepburn 'Little Women' movies.  Better movies...with truer 'Jo's.""

Mind you, this is 1949 and the sets and color, Technicolor, are outstanding.  Watching the movie is like going back into the Currier and Ives world.

392377,3,6301971280,"First of all... the character Jo is supposed to be in her teens.  June Allyson who plays Jo was in her 30's when they filmed this!  My husband came in while I was watching it and asked me if she was Marmee!  I didn't like her portrayal of Jo either- I think Katherine Hepburn and Winona Ryder did a much better job of showing Jo's sensitive side (b/c she did have one) along with her bold and tomboyish qualities.  I never understood why Laurie loved her so in this picture- b/c you don't really see them interact that much.  Also, again with the casting, the man (and I say man, not young man) who played Laurie looked much older than he is supposed to be.  Beth also appears to be the baby in the family- she's even a good foot shorter than the other girls- when indeed Amy is the youngest.  It was hard for me to get past the obvious age issues.

Then there was the script- first part of the movie stayed pretty true to the book.  Then they crammed the second part into about 30 minutes!  I felt like I was on a train ride, crashing into a wall as they skipped over big scenes and dialogue.  All in all... definitely the lesser of the three Little Women movies.

392386,5,6301971280,"The 1949 movie adaptation of Little Women is my favorite screen version and also one of the most gorgeous adaptations! The story of the four March sisters - Meg [Janet Leigh], Jo [June Allyson], Beth [Margaret O'Brien], and Amy [Elizabeth Taylor] and their mother, Marmie is a classic story that has held its appeal all these years. It's a human drama that is a blend of the comic and tragic and will have sensitive viewers reaching for their hankies during some of the heart-rending scenes [one of the sisters dies].

June Allyson shines as the strong-willed Jo March who dreams of becoming an author and whose feminist ideas are convincingly [though by no means overbearing] portrayed. Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Amy is the best of all the movie adaptations - and her 'growth' from a petulant child to a genteel young woman is very credibly done. Peter Lawford as their next-door neighbor, Laurie is credible but lacks the dashing looks of Christian Bale. This is not important however, as what I liked about Peter Lawford's performance here is the lack of chemistry between him and Allyson, which is apt considering Jo only thinks of Laurie as a brother/friend. I loved Rossano Brazzi's performance as Professor Bhaer [ok, perhaps he was too good-looking to make a credible Bhaer, but his character portrayal was excellent].

392433,4,6301971280,"I was a bit hesitant to watch a movie version of ""Little Women"", since movie adaptations are usually so untrue to their books.  This time, however, I was pleasantly surprised!  Almost all of the incidents in the movie take place just as the book describes, and most scenes had a few lines taken straight from the book's dialogue.  Of course, the two-hour time constraint made it necessary to leave out much from the book, but on the whole the storyline was preserved faithfully, ending at Professor Bhaer's proposal to Jo.
My only real complaint was that I think a couple of roles could have been better-cast.  Liz Taylor somehow doesn't mesh very well with Amy's character as portrayed in the book, in my opinion.  In the book, Amy's selfishness is an almost endearing flaw that she grows out of as time goes on.  In the movie, it feels a bit unnatural and we don't get to see her grow out of it.  (Besides, it's impossible to make her look like a blonde :)  .  Margaret O'Brien has an intensity that keeps her from portraying Beth's softness and peacefulness, although she does act the role convincingly.  (In the movie, Beth seems to be the youngest, probably because Margaret looked much younger than Liz.)  June Allyson is very well-cast as Jo, who is the central character of the movie, and the other actors also do a superb job.  I'd give it four-and-a-half stars out of five.  Just don't skip the book because you've seen the movie!",1198195200,,1440,4.622047244094488

392435,4,6301971280,"Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888)was an extremely controversial woman, the product of parents associated with the transcendentalist movement, a rabid abolitionist, an early feminist, and possibly lesbian as well.  Even so, between 1868 and her death she generated a series of novels for juvenile readers which were extremely popular and which continue to be read today.  Easily the most famous of these is LITTLE WOMEN, first published in 1868; it has been adapted to the dramatic stage, to the musical and opera stages; and was filmed no fewer than twelve times during the 20th Century alone.

Three of these films have been particularly famous: the 1933 film with Katherine Hepburn; the 1994 film with Winona Ryder; and sandwiched in between them the 1949 version.  Released by MGM and produced and directed by Mervyn LeRoy, like many films of its era it was driven almost exclusively by star power--regardless of whether the actor in question was right for the role or not--and given every bright and colorful visual possible--whether it was appropriate or not.

The story, of course, focuses on the March girls, four daughters growing up during the Civil War under their mother's care while their father, a Union Chaplin, is away at the front.  Meg (Janet Leigh) is the oldest and perhaps most sensible; Jo (June Allyson) is headstrong, boyish, and very determined to be a writer; Amy (Elizabeth Taylor) is beautiful but vain and affected; and Beth (Margaret O'Brien), the youngest, is of a noble but extremely shy disposition.  Mother ""Marmee"" is played by the always memorable Mary Astor; father Mr. March is played by Leon Ames; and the supporting cast includes Lucille Watson, Peter Lawford, and Rossano Brazzi.

The 1949 LITTLE WOMEN isn't in the least plausible: the actresses are much too different in coloring and build to be believeable as mother and daughters, and although Mary Astor, Leon Ames, and Lucille Watson score extremely well in their performances, the rest of the cast tends to overplay wildly.  Of the sisters, Janet Leigh is easily the most believeable.  June Allyson is seen here at her most brash, Elizabeth Taylor is truly jaw-dropping in a blonde wig, and Margaret O'Brien too often veers into a sticky-sweetness.  And yet, curiously, the whole really does work and is tremendously entertaining, the sort of thing we mean when we talk about ""a good old-fashioned fun film.""

Although the script leaves a lot to be desired, the story presented here is really closer to the book than the 1933 and 1994 films, and it has considerable power and authority; in watching it, you get the feeling that of all the many film versions, this is the one that Louisa May Alcott herself would have liked best.  The Technicolor images are typically over the top, seeming overdone in the austere Marsh home but very on target elsewhere, and the production values are MGM at its most glossy.  Mervyn Le Roy is hardly in the same league with George Cukor (neither is Gillian Armstrong for that matter), but he keeps the show moving at fast clip, and in the end it is extremely enjoyable if somewhat shallow fun.  The DVD is ""good"" rather than fine--but whatever the case, it's a lot of fun.

I found Elizabeth Taylor to be terribly miscast. There is no way she could be younger than Margaret O'brien. I initially thought Margaret O'brien was Amy as she was obviously the youngest person in the cast. I had guessed perhaps Liz Taylor was MEG.

Mervyn LeRoy's version has one advantage over its illustrious predecessor: as Amy, the trivial and dizzy vixen and the most engaging of the tear-stained March sisters, Liz has much more spirit than Joan Bennett... Her part is a charming respite, a light-hearted version of the women in love who were the chief ingredient of her upcoming ingnue period...

""Little Women"" was sweet and sentimental... It was the familiar story of four Massachusetts girls who during their father's Civil War absence learn to grow up and find direction in their lives... The film has the requisite portions of frivolous comedy and soap opera heart emotions; Margaret O'Brien suffers nobly, Janet Leigh smiles sweetly, June Allyson tries valiantly, and what more could be asked of Louisa May Alcott's long-lasting perfumed account?

The film marked an end to Taylor's child-woman phase... Part foolishly teenager, a flighty girl who looks at life from the angle of a Victorian romance, part incipient flirt, coquettishly but kindly stealing Laurie away from older sister Jo, her Amy is a pleasing mixture of the Taylor innocent and the Taylor minx...",1167955200,2,1283,5.071090047393365
392472,4,6301971280,"Having been raised on the 1990's version of the film, it was delightful seeing so many of the actual scenes from Alcott's novel acted out, but I find myself wishing that elements from both films were combined. The Marmee in this version gives her words of wisdom less naturally than good ol' ""Suze"" in the newer one with Winona Ryder. It sounds like she's making a speech. It was also strange to have Amy older than Beth, though Elizabeth Taylor definately gives 100% to the role. June Allison, it was interesting to see, really brought out Jo's aggressiveness, whereas Ryder brought out mostly her awkwardness. But they really could have done better potraying Jo's romance with the professor, and Amy's romance with Laurie in the 1949 version. Might I add: If you've ever read the book, you'd know Jo and Laurie's relationship was A LOT more playful than mushy. The newer version did a great job with Christian Bail as Laurie, and they at leaste tried to explain how Laurie came to see that he was really meant to be with Amy. All this said, I like both, but they draw out different emotions in me. The old is lighter, makes me smile and laugh. The new makes me laugh at times, too . . . but I see in it an element of poignancy, of pathos, that the 1949 film misses.",1167350400,3,1267,4.4655172413793105

392475,4,6301971280,"Little Women is the story of four daughters and their mother (Mary Astor) during the Civil War. Their father is away at war and the family, although rich before, have fallen on hard times. However, their vitality and kindness bring them all they need. Meg (Janet Leigh) is the oldest and the quietest of all the girls. She finds love in a friend of her father's. Jo (June Allyson) is the second oldest and the star of the film. She's a real tomboy whose ambition in life is to be a writer though she loves the theater as well. Amy (Elizabeth Taylor) is beautiful and spoiled but well-meaning.

I'm not trashing Ryder, I just think it was poorly directed.  But I love the June Allyson version.

The members of the cast were superb in their roles.  Margaret O'Brien gives a definitive performance as Beth.  Mary Astor is the Marmee of the novel brought to life on the screen.  Sir C. Aubrey Smith gives a moving performance as Mr. Lawrence.  The scene between him and Beth would make a statue cry. (Unfortunately, this was the last film of his distinguished career.  He died six months after the film was completed.)

The 1933 version had Katherine Hepburn but not much else.

The 1971 BBC version with its three and a half hours included more of the book, but the acting was lamentable, and even the BBC departed from its policy of faithfulness to literary works by substituting feminist advice when Marmee advises Meg on her marital problems.  (Read this passage in Alcott's book.  Its wisdom would save many a modern marriage.)

The 1994 version throws the book away, replaces all the characters with contemporary teenager types and turns Marmee into a radical feminist.

(Note that a novelization of this 1994 movie was published when the movie was released.  It is simply the filmscript written into novel form, a hundred pages or so and, like the movie, bears little resemblance to Alcott's novel.  Many people read that book, thinking they were reading the 800 page Little Women by Louisa May Alcott.  Possibly, this is the version that the Amazon reviewer read.  Otherwise, it is impossible to explain his rather bizarre review.  There are also abridgments in print.  Caveat emptor.  Such literary crimes ought to be against the law.)

June Allyson plays the character of Jo March and none could play it better.  Oh, don't get me wrong; I loved watching Katherine Hepburn (one of my favorite actresses) in the 1933 version, but June Allyson made the role hers.  Yes, she can be both powerful and subtle.

Backing up her performance were three more wonderful actresses: Margaret O'Brien, Janet Leigh and of coarse Elizabeth Taylor.

The only slight scarring to this 1949 version of the film was the small appearances of Mr. March, his acting was quite horrible. But, June Allyson does fill the screen with perfection as Jo March. I thought that Margaret O'Brien portrayed a wonderful Beth also. I was very moved to tears when she shook off her shyness to thank the elder Mr. Laurence for the piano.

392520,5,6301971280,"A sweet, charming, non-stop entertainment film. My only regret is that Rossanno Brazzi is in it, but that's okay. This 1949 ACADEMY-AWARD WINNING version of the beloved classic was incredibly done; with a script and cast to die for.
June Allyson plays the tom-boy writer, Jo March (""Look at me! Dying to go fight by father's side, and here I am--sitting and knitting...like a poky old woman.""). Allyson never stopped being the character, and is such fun to watch.
Margaret O'Brien plays little Beth March, the frail and sickly child in the family (""We are a lot better off than a lot of people. Orphans, for instance. We have father, and Marmee, and each other.""). I cried like a baby in the end of the film, when our poor Bethy dies from Scarlet fever.
Elizabeth Taylor made me laugh out loud so many times in this movie, portraying Amy March (""When one is in Europe, one feels that the dirt there is so picturesque!""). She can't stop eating, and she feels that her nose is unshapley. Hm.
Janet Leigh played Meg March, the most sensible of the girls, and the oldest (""I haven't changed [Jo]! But it's about time YOU had!!""). She is confused by her love for the nasal-voiced Mr. Brookes, and ends up marrying him, in spite of all Jo's begs for her not to.
Lastly, Mary Astor plays Marmee as gracefully as...well, gracefully (""God bless and keep us all.""). Sometimes, I wish that she could be my mother too! (no offense, mom).
This film made me laugh hysterically (such as when the girls rehearse a play; or when Jo gets mad at Amy for eating too much), or sob uncontrallably (when Beth dies, and when Jo finds out her aunt is taking Amy to Europe instead of her). I would definitely reccomend this to ALL movie-goers, fans of the book, or fans of anyone in the cast. It is superb.",1064707200,14,1780,4.513931888544891
392543,4,6301971280,"""Little Women"" (1949) is the delightful coming of age story that follows the exploits of the March sisters, Jo (June Allyson), Beth (Margaret O?Brien), Amy (Elizabeth Taylor) and Meg (Janet Leigh) as they mature from the angst of childhood into their unsuspecting futures as young women of merit and substance. Jo is a tomboy, defying all convention and propriety in her quest to live a life of enchantment and excitement. That excitement leads Jo first into the arms of the very wealthy, Theodore (Peter Lawford), who she rejects, then the penniless, but infinitely better suited, Professor Bhaer (Rossano Brazzi), who eventually wins her heart. This was the second time Louisa May Alcott's novel had been filmed - the first, in Technicolor. As Jo, June Allyson?s performance holds up quite well against Katherine Hepburn?s indelible original. Allyson is properly pert, plucky and disdainful all at once. She makes the part her own. Mary Astor is tender as Mrs. March. Also in the cast is C. Aubrey Smith, making his final screen appearance as the stoic but loveable Mr. James Lawrence and veteran curmudgeon, Lucille Watson as Aunt March. This is a wonderful tale no matter the age and the acting in this version is perhaps the finest ever realized.
Warner Video gives us an absolutely gorgeous looking transfer. Colors are rich, bold and vibrant. Flesh tones have been nicely balanced. Black and contrast levels are dead on. Only in a few scenes does the transfer tend to lose fine detail. The audio is mono but nicely mixed and fresh sounding. There are no extras.",1062201600,8,1568,4.965779467680608
392544,5,6301971280,"The book, Little Women, was written by Louisa May Alcott in 1868-1869, which was an autobiographical novel of her childhood.  The poverty stricken family portrayed in the book and later in movies was a reflection of her family's economics.  During Louisa's writing development she was tutored by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.  So it is no surprise that her book, Little Women, a family classic, that three movie versions would immortalize her novel on screen.
My favorite version of this novel is the second version that was made and released in 1949.  Andrew Solt, Sarah Y. Mason & Victor Heerman, wrote the screenplay.  I rate this family classic a 5 and the reason being is that there are few movies that offer a comparable high quality portrayal of the strong moral fiber and compassionate and genuine nature of the characters of the novel.  The first version starring Katherine Hepburn was released in 1933 and the third version starring Wynona Ryder among others was released in 1994.
The second version's cast included the March sisters, June Allison as Jo, Janet Leigh as Meg, Elizabeth Taylor as Amy, Margaret O'Brien as Beth and Mary Astor as Marmee March, the mother and matriarch.  Also Peter Lawford played Laurie, the rich neighbor boy who befriended the March family for life and Rossano Brazzi as Jo's beau.
The March family finds themselves impoverished after Mr. March makes a bad investment with the family money.  While Mr. March is away fighting in the Civil War the March women are left to fight their own war on poverty, to make ends meet, and keep the home fires burning.  Women of this era were raised to be ladylike, gentile, and homemakers.  However, as wars often require, these women rally to the challenge by taking on nanny and caretaker positions while Marmee volunteers her services to the sick and needy.  The heroine, Jo, pursues her passion, writing, which is also not the norm for women of these times, which was also true of Louisa May Alcott who wrote pseudonymously.
The book, the writer, and the movie versions have served as an inspiration of what a woman can aspire to and overcome and accomplish in her lifetime.  I find courage and strength in her words.  As Marmee says to Jo, ""My dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger; forgive each other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow.""",1060214400,5,2354,4.811414392059554

392546,5,6301971280,"Although I do not consider this version of Little Women to be the best, I do consider it to be my favorite. Why? I'm not exactly sure. Is it because I am a die hard Elizabeth Taylor fan? Maybe. I really think it is becuase of the Technicolor that this Little Women is filmed in. From the opening shot of a patchwork image of the women, to the wintry Christmas this film evokes an image of a more slow time, both in the movies and during when this film is actually set. Many people, including myself, have noticed that this film is virtually a shot for shot remake of the 1933 Katharine Hepburn version (which you should also check out) right down to the sets. It is also wonderful to see several members of the ""Meet Me In St. Louis"" cast featured including Margaret O'Brien, Mary Astor and Leon Ames. So, rent, purchase the video, or pre-order the DVD (which is to be released August 26th, 2003) and check out the 1949 version of Little Women.

You'll never get these kind of actors today never mind a whole lot of them in the same film. Things that i liked most about this film besides the acting was the costumes, the set design and most of all the BGM (background music... There is no such thing as character (bgm) music anymore. Yes they play music but it is usually the latest tune on the radio but isn't really orchestrated music composed for the film itself. In these older films the BGM reflected each character or tha changing of a scene or mood.  The music is suttle but strong, domimate by not over powering. Music helps to tell the story of this powerful drama. This is by far one of the best music scores next to ""GWTW"".

392550,1,6301971280,"Alcott's Little Women is an all time classic. It may not be everyone's favorite (although chances are if you are female it has been at some point in your life)but just the fact that it is still read and passed down 120 years after it's original publication means something. What it means for this book is that it's story an character's are timeless. Any reader can relate to someone in this book, whether male or female. The characters are so well developed as the reader feels they grow with them over time. There are other reasons the book is the classic it is but these are some of the most important, and some that will affect the viewing of a movie based on the book.
Some may think it irrelevant to spend time discussing the merits of the book, which is indeed an altogether seperate work, but I do so because it is what will inevitably shape the viewers opinion more than any other factor, especially with an adaptation of such a widely read book.  What the 1949 version of Little Women boils down to is a soulless technicolor telling of a story that deserves much better. Yes, there are many changes in adaptation movies that are made out of necessity due to the limitations and advantages of the individual mediums, but the story can still be a success with these changes. In this case, however, many small changes effectively rob the story of almost all meaning. Consider the potrayal of Laurie, the girls next door neighbor.  In this movie he is changed from a complex character filled with sensativity and some slightly feminine interests, and turned into a strapping soldier with no discernable depth and who looks nowhere near as young as the 16 year old boy he is meant to be.  That casting oddity, however, is dwarfed by the choice of a glamorous Elizabeth Taylor to play the youngest of the girls, pre-teen Amy. It would be perfectly understandable for someone unfamiliar with the story to view a scene of this movie and think she was the oldest of the girls.  The disguting part of this is that it seems she was cast for the benefit of the grown men seeing this movie, to allow them some eye candy in the disturbing form of a character meant to be no older than 12.
Finally, another reason the book endures is because the questions of character's motivations allow it to be used as the basis for feminist arguments, and is even sometimes argued to be a work of feminism (if you have doubts about this, check your local library for the volumes of criticism published). This movie on the other hand presents ideas (although it's debatable that any thinking went into this production) that are very cut and dry. Go ahead, watch it if you like. Don't expect to find anything of value though. And if you retain any interest in the story afterwords, treat yourself to the 1933 or 1994 versions as both have much more going in their favor.",1026518400,11,2850,4.560546875

392582,4,6301971280,"We bought this movie because our 2 daughters age 9 and 11 absolutely love the book, and love the Little Women that was made more recently with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon.  We thought that it would be fun to see another version.  I had heard that this older version was more lively and true to the time.  I couldn't agree more. The scenery was absolutely lovely..the architecture of the homes amazing, and the costumes were fabulous. My girls sat glued to the television, loved the songs, and the way that ""Amy"" kept making up words. My girls enjoyed the fact that it was so similiar to the RYDER/SARADON video, but had fun pointing out the differences.  What a great way to have fun with literature!  The girls both read the book first and now are getting to enjoy the videos!.  Im so glad that I bought it for them!  Elizabeth Taylor is absolutely beautiful in this video, and although June Allison was pretty, she had kind of has an annoying brash way about her.

392583,4,6301971280,"I've seen this one, Katharine Hepburn's, Susan Dey's, Winona Ryder's, and one on PBS: this is the OVERALL best one. Previous reviewers have commented on the anachronisms in Winona's by having the little women and Marmee talking feminism, something completely absent from Alcott's book. The only other serious contender, of course, would be Hepburn's version, and indeed, if you read the reviews of that movie, authors state categorically that Kate's is better than June's. If you had asked me about that earlier, I might have agreed with you. However, one night I conducted a ""Little Women"" marathon, whereby I rented both and showed them back to back. While I would say that Kate is the better Jo (but June is fine too),  this 1949 version is better. For one thing, I like the casting better. I knew every woman playing the March sisters as well as Marmee very well from other works. Mary Astor's Marmee, together with Leon Ames as Mr. March when he finally returns from the Civil War, make good solid dependable parents. They were also the parents to Judy Garland's family in ""Meet Me in St. Louis"", but here Leon doesn't get a hard time from everyone like in that movie. The standout among the other March sisters is Elizabeth Taylor's blond performance as Amy. She brings the right amount of petulance and vanity to the role. Janet Leigh plays a sweet and demure Meg. I've never liked Margaret O'Brien, period, but she's okay here; fortunately, Beth doesn't make it through to the end of the movie, so I didn't have to see more of Ms. O'Brien than I had to. Peter Lawford makes a good Laurie, a good foil to June's Jo. And I was very pleased to see Dr. Baher upgraded to Rosanno Brazzi--now I could finally understand why Jo chooses the German (yes, I know RB is Italian) tutor over rich boy Laurie.  By the way, one of my other discoveries from my comparison of the two most famous versions back to back was that the same score was used in both, as was the same screenplay--after all, both MGM. I noticed that the professional reviewer at top complained about this script--well, it's the same one he heard in Kate's too!",995673600,9,2125,4.63395225464191

This version is much (a thousand times) better than the recent version of ""Little Women"" starring Winona Ryder (because Winona Ryder was too ""soft"" for a character like Jo...not to mention that it is annoying to hear Winona speak.)

392586,5,6301971280,"This version of Louisa May Alcott's classic book, ""Little Women,"" starring June Allyson, Janet Leigh, Liz Taylor and Margaret O'Brien, was the first remake of the film (which originally starred Kathryn Hepburn) and the version that is truest to the book.
The Wynona Ryder film, the third and latest version, was seriously flawed, especially by the inclusion of ""politically correct"" and contemporary social views like the scene in which Ryder, playing Jo, expresses feminist sympathies to young men in a bar. I've read the book: there's nothing like that in it. In fact, the book is practically a morality play and in the earlier film versions the girls' struggle to improve their characters is portrayed, if somewhat lightly. These struggles, which are necessary to the accurate portrayal of each character and the time in which they lived, was totally deleted from the most recent version.
Both the Hepburn version and the Allyson version use quite a bit of Alcott's original text in the screenplay and characters in both films follow the book almost to the proverbial ""T."" The Ryder film, on the other hand, is a blatant and successful attempt to ""modernize"" Louisa Alcott, resulting in a totally inferior production.",973987200,142,1220,5.105

The cast is perfect: June Allyson as a determined 'Jo', Elizabeth Taylor as a ravishing and spoiled Amy, Janet Leigh as the dependable Meg, and Margaret O'Brien as the fragil Beth.
Peter Lawford makes an ideal 'boy next door' as Laurie and the chemistry with Jo and Laurie is sheer magic. Mary Astor is memorable as Marmee and Leon Ames gives a brief, but noble, characterization as their father. Rossano Brazzi is charismatic as Professor Behr and his scenes with June Allyson are a joy to behold.  All of the Alcott sentiment is here, which tugs at the heartstrings, and the scenes with Beth and Laurie's grandfather (Sir C. Aubrey Smith) are about as sensitive and touching as as we have seen on the cinematic screen.
Mervyn Leroy has given us a tapestry of delicate shading in each scene which comes across as a series of priceless paintings all gathered into one portfolio--and technicolor has never looked so good.  The musical score adds warmth and cohesiveness to the excellent script.  We have here a collection of memorable flashbacks which make it hard for the soul to relinquish.
