Not exactly sure what enticed me to pick up this deranged, barf-inducing, utterly sad and disgusting nightmare of a film.  Oh, who am I fooling--it was mainly because of the awesome title.  Plus it's a Cat 3 film straight out of the Orient involving cannibalism?  I had to see it.  And HPC definitely achieves what it intended to do--make you feel like (crap).

A quick search online at imdb or rotten tomatoes will strangely pull up the emotionally savage film THE UNTOLD STORY instead.  I guess it was also inspired by the same real life incident, but these are two different servings of sickness.

The Hong Kong police raid a particular brothel and haul in a few murder suspects.  Through flashbacks, we are subjected to some confessions that detail the horrific extremes that evil can progress.  People totally suck.
An early scene will really get your blood boiling.  Two sleazeballs needlessly pummel a little dog to death.  No freakin reason whatsoever.  I'm not really sure why a criminal would confess this violent random act of cruelty to the police, especially since it bears no connection to the case.  Still it gives the viewer an unnerving realization on what type of people we're dealing with.

Emily Kwan plays the role of the unfortunate prostitute.  She is brilliant, as her suffering seems way too real.  I won't go into the details of the graphic humiliation and torture she endured, but for me it invoked memories of Ketcham's The Girl Next Door.  It will feel like your heart is getting dragged back and forth across a cheese grater.  Beyond awful, just inconceivable.

HUMAN PORK CHOP surprisingly had no nudity and very little blood or gore.  Director Bennie Chan still finds ways to illicit a wide range of dark emotions.  Heinous, alarming, and disheartening, this is not a story that will appeal to very many people.  I'm not exactly sure who I'd reccommend this movie to.
But yeah, I liked it.",1290902400,3,2061,4.803418803418803
