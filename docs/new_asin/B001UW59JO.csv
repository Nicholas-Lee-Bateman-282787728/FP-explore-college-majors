3814080,4,B001UW59JO,"Our product arrived in good shape.  Thank you.  The dramatized documentary is well researched to give the Native American point of view as white men immigrated to America.  It is very informative.  I learned a lot!

The only criticism I would give is that the camera was so ""in your face"" that often I felt like saying, ""back off so I can see the whole person instead of just his eye and nose.""  When the camera was so close, I found it difficult to know who all was in the room and who was talking to who.

Still, my overall  impression was very good.  I appreciated it so much that I purchased one (from you) for my grandson who will be working in or near an Apache reservation.  I thought it might help him to understand their feelings a little more.",1246838400,3,753,4.276595744680851

3814082,4,B001UW59JO,"This is an excellent PBS series that really brings the past to light.  The first two shows are really the best.  The first show clearly reveals how the religious bigotry and predatory environmental and economic policies of the Puritans made any hope of peaceful coexistence impossible.  A particularly grim fate awaited the ""Praying Indians"", who had accepted Christianity.  During King Philip's War the Puritans put them in a concentration camp in the middle of winter for ""security reasons"", where most of them died.

3814083,5,B001UW59JO,"The reviewer before me gave an excellent blow-by-blow of the series...and I concur with that assessment. However, I want to add something more big picture about what this series suggests.

This excellent series about the Native American story will leave many surprised to the effect of ""Gee, I had no idea.""

As a white American with some experience in tribal matters; this review is not only a recommendation for this series, but a plea of sorts with the general public to learn and understand more about the culture and lives of our Native American sisters and brothers.

I say, with all due respect: ""PLEASE wake up.""

Many of the stories in this series, which we hear from the Native American perspective, we learned in school through the Anglo lens with the following overtones: Indian savage... Indian bad... Troublemaker... Nonconformist... Enemy of progress... these were the stories we read in school, along with watching the bad guy ""Injun Joe"" on the movie screen in that 1970s Disney version of Tom Sawyer.

Throw out all that garbage you have learned. Stop. Rewind. Reboot your hard drive...now learn the truth through this amazing and educational series.

I see this series as merely an introduction to what should be a higher calling for us as Americans; Anglo, Native, Black, Asian, or Latino. For those of you who are inspired by the stories told in this DVD series, it's your job to go out and seek more of the truth that is hinted at in what are a collection of five main stories for each disk: Before the Mayflower, Tecumseh's Vision, The Trail of Tears, Geronimo, and Wounded Knee.

At the very least ~ if you have a pulse ~ it should change your perspective on who we are as Americans. It seems to start mellow and peaceful with the first Thanksgiving, but the story sadly and quickly turns sour.

Instead of upholding and learning something from Native Americans (gee, imagine that), religion (of course) misunderstandings (wow, imagine that again), and operating on old belief systems get in the way of peace and trigger a horrible domino effect. You'll soon understand why we're a spiritually and culturally poorer nation than we should have been after witnessing the accounts of leaders drunk with power, the U.S. Government's land grabs, and a shameful, despicable, systematic decimation of tribal America through bait & switch treaty tactics, blatantly illegal relocation of entire tribes, boarding school brainwashings, abandonment, genocide, and ethnic cleansing.

The accumulation of the stories will make you want to vomit.

Simply put, the series will leave you pondering how it's a far cry from the more culturally rich, fair, diverse, shared, and equitable society that we should have inherited.

It's the stories and hardships that aren't told - which contain more truths that substantiate those told in the series - that need to be discovered through more film, books, and perhaps some personal experience of your own. Taking an active role in the preservation, enlightenment, and support of thriving Native American cultures and their future could be one of the most significant and personally rewarding decisions you ever make.

Seek out a Native American cultural center in your part of the country; make it a modest staycation of sorts in a lean economy. Attend a pow wow ceremony or the like that allows for outside visitors. Support local tribes. Give to their schools. If your a doctor or looking at being one, consider putting time in at an Indian health center - a place that could REALLY use your help.

You might even discover something about yourself...and the road of discovery and reeducating yourself can begin with this DVD series.",1242000000,114,3684,4.99021207177814
3814084,5,B001UW59JO,"It's about time that something like this is produced, and what better director to use than Chris Eyre as director?  He is at his finest in this work, capturing foggy rivers, haze-free sunsets, ample forests filled with flora and pigs and actors dressed in appropriate era clothing.  The quality of the film itself is worthy of awards.  This is truly a gift from his heart.

Benjamin Bratt's gentle voice adds to the narration.  He doesn't get overly emotinal when telling the story, as the scenes you watch at the same time say it all.  You are left to yourself to realize the brutality of that time.

This is a three-disc set totalling about 470 minutes. Produced in widescreen, even on my CRT set I get a near-full screen.

The first episode, ""After the Mayflower"" opens with 1621, the year the first settlers arrived off the shores of southeastern Massachusetts.  The research that went into this work is incredible, with many scenes spoken in the native language, in this case, Nipmuc.  The first Thanksgiving is realistically portrayed:  not with turkeys and cranberries, but with venison and wild berries.

The second episode, ""Tecumseh's Vision"" demonstrates how the War of 1812 came to be:  Natives, who had sided with the British during the American Revolution (can you blame them?) now found themselves on foreign land.  They were pushed westward, west of Appalachia, where more battles ensued with the settlers and frontiersmen and trappers from France along the Great Lakes region.

The Wabash and Tippecanoe rivers hold great history for both the Shawnee and the people who eventually settled along its banks.  The ""Vision"" however, was the loss of the first peoples who had lived along its banks.

The ""Trail of Tears"" completes the second disc.

The most emotional episodes are on the third disc, ""Geronimo"" and especially ""Wounded Knee,"" the episode that explains in 1973 news footage and interviews with some of the participants the reasons for the ""occupation"" that resulted in one death.  Wounded Knee encapsulates the forming of the Native activism, when all tribes united to preserve their languages and cultures and demanded equal rights before the law.

If there is one flaw in this production it is that it doesn't include more episodes of the other tribes that suffered:  the Nez Perce at Big Hole, for example, or the Battle of Litte Big Horn.  Like one tribal member mentioned in the ""Wounded Knee"" episode:  ""Every tribe has its memory of violence (with the US government)"" and to document them all would take up much more footage and disc space than is given here.

Still, it's a beautiful production that leaves any viewer sighing ""Wow!"" at the end.

This documentary is from the Native American's point of view, but the transcript does not just weigh heavily with the Indians:  facts are not twisted or left out.  When angry Wampanoag went from village to village to kill settlers, we know that they had reached a boiling point with Old World trespassers that would only get worse as the years went on.",1240012800,134,3033,4.907662082514735
3814133,3,B001UW59JO,"I watched this for a class I am auditing in American Indian Studies.

Choosing actors to play out the story with the narration makes it almost a movie. The other episodes were good, but my favorite by far is ""Tecumseh's Vision"". Michael Greyeyes really takes on Tecumseh well and really adds a face to a faceless hero of mine given there's no real painting or image of him... just paintings from people's memories of him.",1480032000,2,453,4.536585365853658

Alot of history was revised after the Civil War ignoring this proven historical reality. After the Civil War many textbooks including in the South,excluded the Jamestown Colony as being the first English seattlement and only mentioned the events surrounding the lives of John Smith and Pocohantas and their relationship, when she was actually in England ""where she would perish"" before the Plymouth Colony and the Mass. Bay seattlement was even up and functioning. I am a native Ohioan so this complaint is not a Southern thing.

And we can only imagine the depths of the untold horrors of history. These videos do show how America began. How, even among the true and just keepers of this land, both Native and Pilgrim, there ran the bad blood of greed, power over others and words of broken promises. And we have only to look around us today to see what the effort of fathers before us have placed upon this land. We can only dream of how it could have been.
It is a true story, it is history and I know it is there, but I could not watch these videos through.
To see where it began. How true People worked together to build. Yet, how a disease among us leached our efforts. To see this and to know this and to be almost helpless to act against it is a sickening feeling. And to live today, to see how strong this disease has grown is a feeling of reliving death.

3814933,5,B001UW59JO,"Today, there are approximately 550 Native American Tribes recognized by the United States Federal Government as sovereign groups in the territory of the United States, most with what are considered homelands/reservations designated for their peoples. These tribes/groups have varying degrees of sovereignty and responsibilities for those lands and the people who can lay claim to being a blood member of those groups.

It has taken the United States over two hundred years to reach this level of agreements/treaties with these native groups.

During these years an estimated six million (and as high as possibly 20 million), native Americans have been driven from their original lands, maimed, killed, or made to endure some level of victimization as a result of the rapaciousness that has been the by-word of the ""dominant"" white culture. There can be no other term for what has been visited on these native peoples in our own country over our young history but ""Shame""!

This series has done a very good job of encapsulating this 200+ year stain on our country but the stories have been too far too few. As a quote from the film states; ""Every tribe has had a time of horror in their past"". It is too bad that the early photographs and the solidly done re-enactments can only portray a modicum of what was done and to whom. Only in the last segment when the Siege at Wounded Knee (1973) is chronicled does the viewer actually have a living touchstone through which they can comprehend the magnitude of the frustration and grief associated with the shameful relations that have existed between the United States (and not just the Federal Government), and the Native Americans.

I found myself on a roller coaster of feeling SHAME for what European ancestors did... swinging to realizing that Native Americans also were opportunistic at taking advantage if neighboring tribe's problems!  Seems to be a HUMAN condition, not a European condition.  I was struck with the parallels of the story of Adam and Eve with respect to the Algonquin experience; once they tasted the forbidden fruit, they suffered the burden of CONSCIOUSNESS (knowledge), as exemplified by being SEPERATE FROM the land and the creator.

Many great warriors had a vision that helped mold this great nation of ours.

I read the Mayflower by Nathanial Philbrick and he said much the same, but in much more detail,  about how the first settlers lived in peace with the tribes they encountered and needed to survive.  He read the letters and journals that still survive of the religious leaders in those days and I recommend his book if you want to know more about Massasoit and King Phillips War and, of course, of the early European settlers.",1391644800,,674,4.834782608695652

They end with part 5, the 1973 uprising at the site of Wounded Knee.  A knowledgeable team of researchers, a good narration script, vivid original (to this film) re-enactments, make it known to those who watch the injustices done to the Indian nations of this country.

3815408,5,B001UW59JO,"As a mixed blood Native American and foster brother of a Navajo who survived the boarding school system, I found entire series to be amazing!

I especially enjoyed the segments on the Trail of Tears and Wounded Knee.  In Trail of Tears, I've heard that it was the first role for actor Wes Studi that allowed him to speak his native Cherokee.

I was moved by Dennis Banks' recollection of being removed from his family as a 5 year old boy so that he could attend boarding school where he could not speak his own language or keep any of the culture he had known up to that point in his life.  I reflected on the fact that local rural school boards will bus white children several miles a day from their farms and ranches to school and back so that they can stay with their families.  That is something that white America should feel intense shame over.

When one grew up, the account of the First People was mired in little facts and iffy truths. This series brings home the plight of insecurities, maltreatments, genocides, lies and half-truths the Native Americans had to endure and still endure while losing their culture. It is a sad chapter in American History how their rightful land was being away, their identity and culture mistreated and disrespected.  It brings tears to the eyes and haunts the soul how each tribe was treated and discredited.  It is disheartening to see and hear these tragedies.  Native American causes must be in the forefront again, stereotypes forgotten, The title of this American Experience is 100% correct...WE SHALL REMAIN!!!",1376784000,,843,5.079710144927536

The A.I.M. hostages really WERE hostages and treated badly.  During the siege, A.I.M. raided and ransacked dozens of houses and ranches, owned by Indians and whites, taking cattle, chickens, and committing wanton and pointless destruction of property.  A.I.M. assassinated opponents.  Their portrayal of Dick Wilson was a complete caricature.
By other accounts I have read, the F.B.I and Marshals used a high degree of restraint with weapons:  Something that cannot be said for the A.I.M. militants.  Whenever the government would accede to A.I.M. demands, the A.I.M. leaders would immediately increase their demands ( in other words, they didn't WANT a peaceful solution ).

I could go on.  Mind you, this from someone who started out completely in sympathy with the A.I.M. faction.  I have read much more on the subject recently.

Did the full-bloods and A.I.M. have legitimate complaints?  Certainly.  Did they deal with the situation in a responsible and mature manner?  Absolutely not.",1376352000,7,1224,5.307291666666667

Some of the historical photographs shown during the documentary were startling effective, drawing us into those long-ago times

The Spanish conquered Mexico and used the indigenous people to work in the gold and silver mines, while the US moved the Indians to reservations and subverted their cultures. We went on to remove elected leaders in Latin America and replace them with people who favored US corporate interests operating in their country. We even convinced the Chilean military to bomb the National Palace to kill an elected president and replace him with General Pinochet, an extreme right wing president who murdered hundreds of students and put them in unmarked graves.

The spanish were among the cruelest. But all sneered down their noses at any who were different. And now as America is populated with so many people from so many different places, little has changed. Even generations later, we fight descrimination and prejudice, and still feel the destructive effects of heartless overlords from europe.

Particularly disappointing is the incorrect impression left by the program that The Apache were a peaceful people until they were provoked into violence by the Mexicans and the Whites.  In fact, most ethnographic studies agree that extreme violence and cruelty were made a deliberate part of Apache raiding and warfare as part of a larger philosophical world view that required warriors to capture and retain the power of their enemies.",1338249600,12,537,5.079545454545454

3815944,4,B001UW59JO,"We Shall Remain is a wonderful documentary about the Struggles of the Indian people. The documentary is of very high quality and the actors are wonderful. It's 5 episodes are:

1. After the Mayflower - A look at the New England Puritans and the Indians. I have a particular interest in this area of American history and King Philips War in general, which the Documentary covers. This is a (for the most part) unbias and accurate look at the relations between the two peoples and highlights how the passing of the first generation was a MAJOR issue in the breakdown of peace between the two people. We watched this in class and I kept waiting to point out inconsistencies with books I read but I couldn't find any. A very informative documentary.
2. Tecumseh's Vision - Another goodie, takes place between the Revolutionary war and the war of 1812. A little known Indian hero is shown in magnificent light. Very well acted.
3. Trail of Tears  - A look at the legal battle the Cherokee faced during the Removal period.
4. Geronimo - A good balanced look at who Geronimo was and his legacy. This documentary actually made me DISlike Geronimo something that I would have never expected it to do. It was very good in portraying his deeds, the good and the bad.
5. Wounded Knee - About the 1973 siege of wounded knee and the Red Power movement. very interesting and enlightening.

My only complaint is that some of these were not shot very well. Episode 2 for instance was Zoomed in WAAAY too far into everyone's faces. It was disorienting and distracting. Most of the other episodes did this a bit too but none were as bad as the second episode. Another complaint is that it is only 5 episodes. They should have made room for other great Indians like Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull.",1333497600,9,1775,4.5754716981132075

""We shall Remain"" offers a much more human account of the terror natives endured as a result of the ""European restlessness"". All I hope for, is the day that European sensibilities change in favor of recognizing and reconciling with the peoples of these lands. This telling of history is a sad and moving tale of the impact that greed and intolerance has on those, who by there very existence, stand in the way of unbridled, and unethical acquisition of land and resources to the detriment of entire civilizations. ""I Am Ashamed"" should be the title of an honest European retelling of the American Experience.",1285200000,5,748,4.897637795275591
3816011,5,B001UW59JO,"We Shall Remain is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen. From the stories themselves, to the footage and reenactments, to Benjamin Bratt's narration. I hope schools across the country are playing this for students.

I can't knock a single episode but for me, in some ways the Cherokee installment is The One. Why? Because more than any other, it illustrates the fact that there was nothing any of the tribal peoples here could have done to to work with or appease the US government into letting them survive as Nations on ancestral homelands, culturally entact or not. The Cherokee, as one of the ""5 Civilized Tribes"" (along with the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee and Seminole), did everything the Americans could have asked and wanted from an indigenous people. For nearly all intents and purposes, the Cherokee become White Americans in all but skin color. They had an alphabet, they owned and worked in American-style businesses, they became owners of black slaves, they adopted American-style government, etc...

No one could have done more to Americanize. No one could have done more to accept the new path being offered them, yet when all was said and done, they were just Indians and would be treated and removed as such.

I've watched every episode several times and it never fails to get to me. Dennis Banks saying he did everything he had to do to be Dennis Banks but inside, Naawakamig never died. What a moment. Then bask in the presence of Madonna Thunder Hawk.

Watching We Shall Remain, I couldn't help but be thankful Ken Burns has never done a big documentary on these general topics, because that may have kept We Shall Remain from beng made at all, which would have been a darned shame. Ken Burns never could have done this.

Even if you're someone who knows the histories, there is a magnificence about We Shall Remain. Some of the comments, some of the narration; these things will burn themselves into your mind.

Still, never let something like this make you believe that American Indian/First Nations/Native American histories are something from long ago. Browse Indian Country Today, find topics that interest you. See another side of today's America.

The first episode about the arrival at Plymouth rock is so different than what I learned in school.  It showed me how quickly treaties and pacts can change in just a generation!
  When you see Geronimo with 29 people against 9,000, you have to be in awe of the man.  He rode in the presidential parade as a hero, but the US government never let him return to his homeland. Sad story.
  I also am concerned for the tribes in Brazil today.  I googled a map of where Christians have been spreading the ""true"" religion. Very sad indeed.  Let the tribes there have their own religion and way of life. Have we learned nothing?

I already knew the names of the Native leaders talked about in this series, but I had no idea of the whys and wherefores regarding their legacies.
