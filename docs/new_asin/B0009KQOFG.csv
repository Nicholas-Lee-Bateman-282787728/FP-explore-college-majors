8062774,1,B0009KQOFG,"I bought this movie on another site so did not pay the top dollar that its going for here...and boy am I glad. The story is very sound. Too bad the actors did not believe what they were portraying because they were AWFUL! The scenery was great, I was jealous cuz would have loved to be on vacation there. Not with the actors though.

The dialogue and reactions to the situations in which they found themselves were so not realistics it was like they were dead inside. I hate to say this but I can't give this movie any less than 1 star, it deserves a -2. Stay away. Its not worth it...even for free.",1304726400,2,599,4.208695652173913
