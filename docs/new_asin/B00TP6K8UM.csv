8702475,2,B00TP6K8UM,"The first and probably the most important thing you need to know about this film is that Joe is not in it. You hear his cassette recorded voice a few times and see his image in some photos, but that's all. It's mostly a bunch of guys who were once in a Spanish rock band talking about Joe and a Dodge car that he lost track of in Spain following the final break-up of The Clash, and Joe's efforts to enlist the help of these fellows in relocating it. Since said guys are naturally Spanish-speaking, unless you can read Spanish get ready to read everything they say in subtitles. Only a couple of English speakers briefly appear here. This fact alone would not normally be a big deal, but the movie is boring as hell and all of the reading enhances the monotony. These people are big fans of The Clash and can barely contain their excitement at the chance to discuss having once been associated with Mr. Strummer. You can hardly blame them for that, but it doesn't make this film any better. To top it all off, as best I can tell Joe's car was never located.",1447113600,10,1057,4.316582914572864
8702476,5,B00TP6K8UM,"At one point in time, the Clash was the quintessential punk rock band.  Much of what we know as punk today is informed by their classic albums and iconic imagery.  Calling this band legendary isn't so much a compliment as a simple statement of fact.  While groundbreaking albums like Combat Rock and London Calling come to mind when one mentions the Clash, few fans have delved deeply into the bands final release, Cut The Crap (1985) which was recorded after the ouster of key members, including guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Mick Jones.  In a media storm of bad press, Joe Strummer fled to Spain for two years, abandoning The Clash.  In 1997, he referred to this time in an interview with Radio 3, recalling the car he lost during this era.  Director Nick Hall set out to find out what Joe was doing in Spain, and what happened to that car, lost some twelve years prior to the interview.

The title of this documentary, I Need A Dodge, refers not only to the lost car but was a phrase Strummer used regularly meaning needing a way out of circumstances.  Certainly, the trip to Spain was Joes dodge, a way to remove himself from the public eye after the demise of his hit-making band, but the big question is, what did he do for those two years when he seemingly dropped off the radar.  The answer is that Joe turned record producer.  Spanish bands 091 and Radio Futura fill in the gaps as viewers read the subtitles to follow along.  Members of 091 recall meeting Joe Strummer in a bar one evening, and forging a relationship that began as adoring fans enjoying the company of a musical hero to months of partying and the production of their debut LP.  While the rock icon was working in a studio in Spain, interviews with members of the final version of The Clash, Joes friends and the mother of his children show that he simply disappeared from his normal environs in Britain with neither warning nor clue when he may return.

The most interesting aspect of this film is the time spent on the recording of the 091 LP.  While it must be an honor to have such a respected musician and songwriter working with a young band, Joe Strummer was not a producer.  Not only had he not worked in this capacity previously, but he was unacquainted with the quick, off the cuff recording style which was standard in Spain, and the technological gap between the recording process faced in this project vs his experience in London.  A diary kept by a member of the band recounts Strummer having to leave the studio to buy cables, as the studio did not have enough on hand to facilitate the recording, as well as rising tensions between the record label, Strummer and 091 over the extensive time and money spent creating this album.  Joes inexperience in the producers chair shows, as does the cultural differences between the recording industries in his native ground and hideout locale.

Lets get back to the car.  While in Spain, Joe became the owner of a Dodge 3700 GT.  In 1986 when he was called home for the birth of his daughter he parked his vehicle in a lot, and could not find it on his return.  Hall spends some amount of time, a rather short part of this documentary, trying to discover what became of Joe Strummers car.  What he found is a mystery best answered by watching I Need A Dodge.  While this is an interesting rabbit trail on the path of musical history, Strummers involvement in the music industry during his self-imposed exile is the real story here.  Its a tale of a man trying to close old wounds and start a new chapter, and not without its fair share of both joy and disappointment.  All of this is presented in a package that contains not only the DVD but a cassette of the 1997 interview, a postcard, and a Joe Strummer one million one dollar bill.  For Clash fans and punk history buffs, I Need A Dodge is a rewarding journey down a previously undocumented era in the life of a legend.",1446768000,4,3905,4.519203413940256
