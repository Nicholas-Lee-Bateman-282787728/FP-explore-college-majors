8751682,5,B01BW4FL2E,"This is a wonderful merging of media.  There are a number of lines of poetry with great resonance - my favorite among them, in the context of Stevens's discourse on entropy:  everything a sacrifice for everything else.  The music accompanies the themes well, and the videography - with its artful  abstractions and inclusions of NASA imagery - is very impressive.",1461888000,,363,5.0
8751683,5,B01BW4FL2E,"Payson Stevens is an artist of the highest caliber, and his VideoTonePoems are singular in nature.

He synthesizes art, poetry, music, and photography to create exquisite visual meditations.  Instead of relaxing and closing our eyes to meditate, were drawn into relaxing and keeping our eyes and heart open.  We absorb soulful sounds while metaphoric images choreograph endless possibility, daring us to move out of our rote way of life and reach for the stars  the origin and final destination of our existence.

He takes us on a journey that roots us in the divinity of spirit, exemplifies the perfection of nature, and hovers over the afflictions that challenge the human condition.  Thought-provoking and transformative, his work brilliantly portrays life as an illusion, a dream of our own making.

One of my favorites of his VideoTonePoems is Endless Prayer, which is imbued with resplendent color and sound.  At the end, he mentions Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, a famous Indian Sufi saint who stressed love as a means of realizing God.  For Nizamuddin, love of God implied a love of humanity.  I find this a critical message for the human species  a message imperative to our survival.

Thank you, Payson Stevens, for allowing yourself to be the vehicle for a beautiful and compelling expression of The Divine.",1461283200,,1314,5.088785046728972
