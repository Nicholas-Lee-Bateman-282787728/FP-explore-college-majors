8159704,5,B0007CEWUA,"I've been collection miliary footage from World War II for quite some time now and this is one of the most interesting disks I've bought in a while.

The film quality is watchable - but far from perfect - but these particular shots of actual World War II combat are ones that I have not been able to find anywhere else.

The commentary is kept to a bare minimum and the footage is very dramatic.

In a way I'm sorta glad they did not use artificial methods to restore the footage because it comes off as more real this way.",1146700800,,523,4.21
8159705,5,B0007CEWUA,"I had a very good experience with the vendor on this DVD, the copy was defective and I contacted him by email. The vendor answered promptly and worked quickly to resolve the problem in a professional and courteous manner.

I have a good clean copy of the movie which I will be able to give to my son-in-law's grandfather who was a bombardier with the 351st when his plane went down on it 25th mission.",1121731200,,401,4.346666666666667
