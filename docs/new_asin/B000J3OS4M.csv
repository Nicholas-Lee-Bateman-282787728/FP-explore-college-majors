I am grandmom/mom - we adopted our 7 year old grandson in December of 2007. Yes, we are white, yes we make a combined income of over 80K a year, and yes we live in suburbia in a newer home and drive newer automobiles. But, drugs affected the lives of the parents and long story short, we his grandparents, ended up here at this place today when we should be planning our retirement.

I would have liked to see more interaction, ideas, solutions, and support integrated into this documentary rather than the hopelessness that it portrayed.",1215388800,,768,4.681481481481481
8418254,3,B000J3OS4M,This was a well done documentary about grandparents raising/adopting their grandchildren.  That said it wasn't very helpful to me as my situation was very different from the families portrayed in the film.,1215129600,,205,5.40625
