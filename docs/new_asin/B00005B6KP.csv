So if you don't already know what swing/Lindy Hop/jitterbugging is all about, the film won't help you. It has short-attention span visuals but interminable interviews that don't help much: usually just someone saying how much he or she likes this or that about swing or Lindy Hop. A lot of times the talk seems to be begging for an example, but the example's never delivered; for instance, while one interviewee points out that the only way to understand what ""swing"" means is to listen to Count Basie, the film shows a few seconds of footage of Count Basie, but without the music.  When Frankie Manning (who's featured prominently) says that the dance was not just about how it felt, but how it looked, there's no footage of anyone actually dancing it.  After Doc Severinsen talks about how he likes Duke Ellington's music better than anything, the film shows him with the Tonight Show band playing...a Fats Waller song. The only really extended footage of people dancing is the excerpt from the old film ""Hellzapoppin'"".  The rest of the time we get people saying over and over how great all this stuff is without letting us watch any of it; it's like having someone sitting next to you at a show, constantly nudging you and saying ""Isn't this great"", ""I love this part"", and talking all the time.  Talk is cheap.  Show the dancers, show the musicians, or we'll never know what all the fuss is about.

There are some groups mentioned in the film that came up in the '90s that I'm not overly familiar with amd they seem pretty talented, but they never get a chance to be featured: just talked about.  But the fact they're mentioned, and the references to some older films that look worthwhile, are the only useful things about this film, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.",1369440000,,2027,4.534246575342466

7936874,4,B00005B6KP,"This DVD is a colossal & historical collection of Swing Dancing, Jazz Music, & its interrelated relationship.  Classified as a documentary (Specific Genre- Social History), it might not appeal to those interested in uninterrupted musicality or video hits.  Its appeal undoubtedly comes from its (sweet) compilation- both from the historical annals-  (both of jazz music & dance),to its worldwide `social appeal' of its followers.  It draws its power from its  `then & now' clips- interspaced w/ candid interviews of dancers & musicians.  It seamlessly woos the watcher into the Neo-Swing movement (genre growth) of the 1990s.  The movie flows elegantly & in a positive & energetic manner- encouraging an individuals desire to search out Swing Dance & Jazz Music.  I especially enjoyed the interviews w/ the bandleaders, the showcase dancers, & Norma Miller's nostalgic description & `cab-ride', all undeniably aimed to reflect from their heart & persona this love of dance & appreciation of music they all share.  The individual archived clips are wonderful &  `alive'  & OMG!!!!! Cab Calloway is a performer of an unparalleled magnitude.  The DVD production was meant to be flowing & perhaps a bit choppy- insofar as the diversity & amount of material that it needs to encompass is voluminous.  It may be argued that  `So Much'  is missing from the story- & that might be true- it was not designed to be a comprehensive historical tract- but its heart was created to celebrate the revival of Lindy Hop (Swing Dancing).",1131840000,3,1519,5.117886178861789
7936875,4,B00005B6KP,"This Joint Is Jumpin' is an unexpected delight.  With the combination of plenty of clips from the swing era alongside footage and commentary from present day Lindy Hoppers and musicians, the documentary shows how the swing era resonates even today.
The famous Hellzapoppin' routine by Whitey's Lindy Hoppers, with comments from Normal Miller and Frankie Manning is a highlight.  Musical artists include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Louis Prima, Brian Setzer, Atomic Fireballs, Royal Crown Revue and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.  There are plenty of artists missing from the story, but this isn't meant to be a comprehensive history so much as a celebration of swing.
The strongest aspect of the movie is the generous attention given to Lindy Hop (swing dancing), drawing on present day dancers such as Erin Stevens, Ryan Francois, and Marcus Koch to describe the revival of America's national dance in from late 1980s to now, when it again enjoys enthusiastic and widespread popularity around the world.",1020211200,15,1054,5.261904761904762
