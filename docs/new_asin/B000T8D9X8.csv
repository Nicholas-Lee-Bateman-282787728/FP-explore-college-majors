This show is great for kids and adults to watch.",1442707200,,323,3.9692307692307693

8208049,5,B000T8D9X8,"This movie (and another I have) is great entertainment, much cleaner than most people today want, but great for folks who hate bad language and bad actions by the chief characters so prevalent in movies today. It's too bad that those of us who like this genre cannot get the episodes that did come out.",1358985600,,302,4.509090909090909

8208051,5,B000T8D9X8,Danica McKellar is very good as always in this episode of Inspector Mom. It is fun to watch and definitely for family watching. Keep up the great work Danica. More episodes would be highly welcome.,1245628800,3,197,4.6571428571428575
8208052,4,B000T8D9X8,"This is a good decent mystery drama that the whole family can enjoy. I love the idea of a mom who works AND stays at home with her kids. (That's what I do as well, but I don't solve crimes!)

And it's nice to see Danica McKellar again - being a mom! The Wonder Years was way too long ago....",1202083200,6,291,3.85
