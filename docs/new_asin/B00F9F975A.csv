5971622,5,B00F9F975A,"I enjoyed this anime from start to finish (if you can call it a finish.) It's called the ""Complete Series"" but it's more like Spice and Wolf. While it doesn't really end, it is conclusive for this part of the story--no Little Busters abrupt ending. I couldn't stop watching...literally, I watched it in one sitting. Eric Vale and Felecia Angelle in the leads, Todd Haberkorn as a villain and Jerry Jewell as a more than likely villain...what great voices!

This anime is rated TV MA: it does have some Kanokon moments and if you couldn't hang with something like Sekirei this isn't for you. Not to say there's a large amount of flesh--so if that's what you're after you're in for a disappointment. (Just that it's there and you have been warned.)

The $60 price--at the time of this review--is a little steep, but it's got good plot, characters, art, and voice talents; it will be worth watching multiple times.",1386979200,23,911,4.6875
5971623,5,B00F9F975A,"this is one of my personal favorite shows. the hero is a genius who acts like a moron and is super powerful to boot, even though he pretends to be weak. i like this one because the main character actually knows the girls like him and is not a complete airhead like most other harem main characters, hes got mad skills with his hands and he uses his abilities to his advantage",1380585600,15,375,4.222222222222222
5971624,4,B00F9F975A,"The ""Wapanese Animu Industry"" continues to crank out tons of animu where ""cute girls do cute things"" and guys lucky enough to be actually featured herein get their butts handed to him by everybody. The few good CGDCT titles where the guys DO have a rigid spine; they're either hidden under the table because it's too shameful or their existence won't be acknowledged.

That's my personal gripe. That's also why I'll vouch for Rogue Hero's Aesthetics.

It'll come off as ""misogynistic."" (Really? The lot of the animu feature women dominating everything and this is the best the critics can do?)

But it's got a story to tell. One where there's no such thing as a ""happy ending"" after you defeat the evil final boss. Where the demon lord's daughter, Miu, tries to fit in and make friends. Where the anti-hero tries to do good and helps everyone the best way he can. And where another, greater evil fills the void left by the demon lord's death.

You should really give this a try. It's like the Dead Or Alive video game series if anything.",1380585600,8,1037,4.619565217391305
5971625,5,B00F9F975A,"Another great fanservice anime. I knew it was going to happen any time soon, since it was already on bluray in the UK.

It has an interesting story [plot+fanservice], a hero not from this world with an overpowered force, unstoppable in many cases, and surrounded by hot chicks, hot naked chicks.

Cool design of characters, smooth details, and a marvelous soundtrack, there's an epic opening on youtube, a guitar solo for you guys to check it out.

The downhill is, it does not have a 2nd season, and boy... this deserves it.

FYI: Myuu Ousawa, who would not love that beautiful girl.",1380240000,14,584,4.696078431372549

5971645,5,B00F9F975A,"- Synopsis: The protagonist is summoned to another world where he defeats an evil boss. Afterwards, he decides to bring back the Dark Lord's daughter with him to his original world. To avoid suspicion, she poses as the protagonist's sister. Immediately on their arrival, they are forced to join a special school that trains its students to help serve humankind. Unfortunately, there are others that are aiming for the Dark Lord's daughter. Thus, stirring up the peaceful life that the protagonist is trying to maintain.
==========================================================================================================

- Comments: This anime is fan-service heavy and is uncensored. So it shows plenty of boobs. If you are a viewer unaccustomed or dislikes the Ecchi genre, this anime is not for you. Aside from that, the protagonist is likable, the character interactions are silly, the fight scenes are pretty cool, and the fan-service is nice.

- Analysis: Many viewers might appreciate the main character for various reasons. He definitely is not weak like many cliche characters are. He also is not indecisive when it comes to women, which many characters in similar genres are. The protagonist is difficult to dislike because he can be perverted like Issei (High School DxD), or he can be serious like Yuuji (Grisaia) whenever he feels it is necessary. Coupled with his prankster-like antics and being very powerful himself, he definitely is not your typical main character. It is also implied that he is smart.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays and 12 episodes on 2 DVDs. The approximate run-time is 5 hours.

- Conclusion: A cool protagonist that can be perverted and serious whenever he wants. Since he defeated a boss, he's most likely not a level 1 based off his stats (from a gamer's mentality). Since this anime is an Ecchi, it is fan-service heavy. If that isn't appealing to you, it would be best to avoid this. Otherwise, enjoy the uncensored fan-service, fantasy-like world, cute girls, character interactions, and fight scenes this anime has to offer.

5971680,4,B00F9F975A,"Aesthetica of a Rouge Hero... As a fan of Anime, my only real complaint about this series is the fact that there will never be a second season. This is most likely due to the fact that Japanese culture seems to prefers their protagonist in combat Anime to be the strong female who always rushes in to save the weak male. Just look at Sekirei, Shakugan No Shana, Claymore, or Fate and you will see the evidence of this simple truth.
That being said, Aesthetica runs to the opposite side of the spectrum. The premise is that children from all over the world were mysteriously transported to other dimensions through ""Other World Gates"". When these children are returned to their home world dimension, many of them return with super natural magical, or fighting abilities. One such person is Akatsuki. A kind hearted, courageous, although perverted hero, he has the strength to back up his arrogance and bravado. When Ataksuki returns to this world through a dimensional gate he brings with him a girl from the world he just left. The daughter of a Dark Lord he destroyed in the other dimension, he is sworn to protect her at all cost. Mui, his charge, is nave, beautiful, and some what of a brat. As their new life in this world begins, they try to cope with life in this world, a school especially for young people who have returned from other dimensions, living with each other, powerful foes, and their own underlying sexual tension.
Because this series was poorly received in Japan, as reasoned before, the plans for a second season were scrubbed., and no other production company has, as of yet, shown any interest in footing the bill to produce it. After all, Anime is a Niche market....
I, personally, really enjoyed this Anime, but, due to the fact that the story has an open ending with no chance of closure, I could only give this 4 stars. That in no way a reflection on the Discs themselves. Just a peeve about un-ended story lines.",1458086400,,1941,4.628985507246377

5971682,3,B00F9F975A,"An interesting series which could have been alot better, here is my review, please enjoy!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) Our ""rogue hero"" Akatsuki Osawa is a magical figher. We first meet him running in a forest being chased by girls in maid outfits. After he escapes them with questionable ways AKA stealing their bra's and then the maids calling him a perv. When he gets to the portal back to earth he is met by princess Listy El Da Sherfied, who wishes for him to stay but he wants to go back to earth. After he gets back he reveals he has a girl in his backpack. This girl is Miu, she is the daughter of the dark lord that Akatsuki killed before the series even began. Now both Miu and Akatsuki live on earth and go to school there. Then a magical adventure, with new friends, enemies from both earth and the other magical world attack. Here comes a great adventure....Sort of.

Pros: The action is quite nice. The characters are good and likeable for the most part. For the fanservice people out there these is alot of boobs and butt being grabbed by Akatsuki. The battles are good and tons of fighting. A hint of a romantic subplot.

Cons: (sorry I am going off of just memory but as I remember) the villians plots are hidden and never told out in full. Both the earth villians and the magical world villians never show their plan but its underlinded that they have one. Also because this is NOT the blu ray version they do NOT include the 7 bonus specials episodes which I feel are just shorts. I only watched this when it was on TV.

Ending cons: (mini spoilers) The ending is pure crap. One of the villians from the magical world gets defeated so Akatsuki, Miu and their friends come along for a journey to go back to the magical alter world where the series started in episode 1 to protect it from the villians attacking it. Seriously that how it ends. Honestly this should could have done a lot more, like so much more but it was epically ended too quickly. The people who made the anime could have made this into a 24 or 26 episode series but its only limited to 12 episodes which makes it feel too short and not enough expressed.

 Overall: I feel like this series could have done so much better but it feels like the makers got lazy and just ended it too quickly. If you wanna buy it go ahead but I honestly didn't like it that much.",1456617600,,2355,4.328798185941043

5971684,1,B00F9F975A,"It's yet another ""egotistical hero with no respect for women who goes around groping them and never suffers any consequences"" series.

The main character is an absurdly overpowered Gary Stu who's just so awesome that he beats every opponent with minimal effort, he runs around stripping women and stealing their underwear, and he never faces any sort of consequences no matter how badly behaved he is.  There's really nothing else that can be be said about it.",1455494400,3,460,4.961038961038961

5971750,5,B00F9F975A,"This is one of my favorite Anime. It has solid action, is well animated, a fairly complex story-line (for the genre), and excellent voice-acting (both in the original Japanese AND the English Dub) and great music. But the thing that makes this show stand head and shoulders above some others is the strength and complexity of the characters. No character in the series is simply two-dimensional; they all have a lot going on and show that depth as the story emerges. The characters actually demonstrate some growth as they interact with each other and the situation that develops around them unlike some other series in the genre (Sekirei comes to mind) where the personalities are pretty much cast in concrete.

The real plus about this particular show (for me, anyway) was that the main character was not the all-too-typical uncertain, angst-driven adolescent male desperate for the attention of any available female. He's a hero, and he knows he's a hero, and that's that.

Yes, there is a considerable amount of nudity and sexual innuendo and this is most definitely NOT for kids or for prudish adults. But again, that's the genre. The humor is fairly crude, but well done; the nudity is nearly omnipresent, but somehow not gratuitous and is (mostly) played for laughs; and when the plot turns dark it does so in a manner that takes you on quite the emotional ride.

The only real drawback here is the fact that series ends at the edge of a cliff - or actually at an inter-dimensional vortex - at a point where a major sub-plot is apparently about to become the main plot. The anime is based on an ongoing manga and like High School of the Dead (another favorite of mine) it may be quite awhile, if ever, before there is a second season of the anime. That said, while there are a lot of unanswered questions, there is reasonable closure to the main storyline and the ""cliffhanger"" really doesn't take away from the story told in this season as much as it whets your appetite for more of the same.",1425686400,,2000,4.660056657223796

5971759,3,B00F9F975A,"I liked this series (I'm a big ecchi fan), but I have to admit that the hero's unending arrogance and the way he kept harassing the girls set my teeth on edge. I'd really have loved to see them kick his butt once or twice. They always forgive him, but by the time the climactic battle rolled around, I was only rooting for him half-heartedly. I think it would have done the plot good if he wasn't so unbeatable most of the time. Also, the animation was frequently softened to the point where it looked like they were in a perpetual fog.

This series is funny, sexy, and occasionally dramatic, but if vaguely (mostly suggested) rapey behavior bothers you, this will. In the commentary, one of the actors expressed dismay about the hero's treatment of the grade-school-aged Kuzuha.",1415577600,,779,4.644927536231884

5971770,5,B00F9F975A,"This series contains some nudity/fan service and may not be suitable for children.

This series had an immersive and interesting plot line.  Each episode seemed to add depth to the characters and really drew the viewer in and made you care about the lives of those involved.  The plot line did take a ""predictable twist"" towards the end, but the execution was still great and didn't detract from the story at all.

The girls are cute, the animation is superb, and the Japanese voice acting was great.  The English dub was good... though I'm not a fan of English Dubs in general.  There is a perfect blend of action and comedy.  I can't say enough good things about this show w/o adding in spoilers.

The series does end without the plot line being fully resolved.  There is plenty of material for a season 2 and I strongly hope there is one soon.",1402012800,4,846,4.5131578947368425
5971771,5,B00F9F975A,"This appraisal is perhaps on a simplistic scale compared to some who have written pages on a given movie/series. From my perspective this was one heck of a great series. It held my attention all the way through. The music was first rate, the motion of the characters was almost fluid like compared to others I have watched. For the first time in a while when the characters talked it actually looked like they were talking as a human being would. Not out of the side of their face but from where the mouth is found. Yes, there is some ""skin"" but nothing out of the ordinary. I believe there was one scene in the ninth episode where it could have gotten out of hand and have a full blown sex scene but nothing drastically happened. I do hope that there will be a sequel because it did end rather abruptly, almost like watching an Alfred Hitchcock movie, totally left you wanting to see more. Other than that I would recommend this to any adult viewer, over 18 perhaps.",1399766400,,967,4.407821229050279

5971775,5,B00F9F975A,"FIRST OFF: ***This show has a decent amount of Ecchi and is definitely a meant for the older audience.!!***

I enjoyed this series because of the Main characters. The Guy in this show isn't completely oblivious to his good looking nature and takes advantage of it. He is an overly arrogant, cocky, self centered and typical horn dog.. But yet has a sensitive side which the girls like.. He is Powerful and knows it.. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys this type of main lead!!!!

Pros: Great story line, Decent amount of Ecchi, Awesome Main characters! And Fantasy powers which everyone loves!!

Con: None really, but if I had to say anything, Battle scenes are a bit to short",1395273600,,690,4.639344262295082
5971776,5,B00F9F975A,"Teleported to another world a laid back wisecracking womanizer is plunged into a war against a powerful demon king. After slaying the demon king his dying foe requests that he become the guardian of his beautiful buxom daughter. Having agreed to become her guardian he takes her with him when he returns to his own world in order to evade their enemies and give her a chance at a new life. Shortly after arriving they are enrolled in Babel academy a school for people who have returned from other worlds and now possess magical abilities.

The show is uproariously funny and has some great action sequences although some people may be turned off by the excessive amount of fan service!

The animation is gorgeous, the characters are compelling, the story is intriguing and the English dub is excellent making this series a must own for any anime fan and is one of my favorites!

Be warned this anime contains fan service so it may not be suitable for children! Fan service involves bouncing breasts, skimpy bikinis, revealing clothing, glimpses of panties, brief nudity and suggestive themes.",1394755200,,1092,4.860215053763441
5971777,5,B00F9F975A,"This is a great anime lots of fan service but the story is a lot of fun action, adventure, and a slight romance.  Fantasy meets a little science fiction with a good helping of fan service in the middle, the main character is described well as a rogue hero.  This is a fantastic anime I just wish they would have made a second season but, who knows in the future they may give it a green light and I really really hope they do.  I would recommend this to any anime fan or anyone else for that matter I would suggest maybe 13 and up but you should definitely watch first and make a decision typical fan service some T & A nothing below the belt is shown except the A.  Great anime on bluray wonderful sound and picture, I first watched online so big improvement for me.",1394409600,,767,4.162162162162162
5971778,5,B00F9F975A,"This is a fun action packed series with a bit of eye candy and a strong set of characters. The underlying concept is that some children are lost to worlds in other dimensions. Occasionally they come back with strange abilities and they are then schooled separately from the rest of the world. The central character is called Akatsuki Ousawa who is a classic rogue/jester figure is one such figure. He travels to and from a world called Alayzard where he has killed a dark king and kidnapped his daughter (Miu). The rest of the plot concerns how these two survive in the school system, making friends and enemies along the way until a figure from Alayzard arrives to spoil the party.  Lots of pranks, lots of varied action, a reasonable plot and some good characterization. Can't be bad and could have been much worse. Highly recommended.",1393718400,,837,4.732876712328767

5971782,5,B00F9F975A,"Atkaski Osawa is not your normal high school student.  He was summoned to a magical world in which he made a name for himself as the Rogue Hero by defeating the last Dark Lord.  Now back on Earth, he brought back a little momento from the other side, the daughter of said Dark Lord, Myuu.  Now the two of them enter the school of Babel, with her as his sister,  so they can learn to control their abilites and perhaps live a normal life.  But there are people on both sides who want to put an end to not only the Rogue Hero, but to end Myuu as well.  Can Atkaski give Myuu the life he knows she deserves, or is will someone tear them apart?

This was a great series.  Despite Atkaki's perverted manner (taking the student council VP's underwear in the middle of the school, to fondiling Myuu in the middle of the ocean), you can see that he truly cares for others, especially Myuu who he has sworn to protect and wants to see her be happy.  Myuu is a running gag with her over developed chest that just pops out at the most unusualy times, to the development of the other main characters.  This anime is like a few others that deserves another season and like many fans we should demand it.",1390262400,23,1190,4.225663716814159
5971783,3,B00F9F975A,"I was looking for a series that was along the lines of fantasy/adventure which is why I picked this up. I read through the reviews to garner more opinions and finally decided on purchasing this anime.

It IS action/adv/fantasy. However there is an insane amount of gratuitous nudity that was wholly not what I was prepared for. I probably should have been more thorough on my research when deciding to purchase this show. I mostly bought it because of the genre and the fact that the series had an amazing voice cast.

The plot was ok. However, I prefer something a little more meaty; no pun intended. The animation was very well done and as I mentioned before the voice cast is stellar. The extras aren't too shabby either but as a warning the entire series up to and including the extras are as one reviewer mentioned, ""fan service.""

Not trying to sound like a prude here I just wasn't expecting 300 minutes worth of constant nudity (that's all it really was by the way.)
So by leaving this review I am just warning those who may have children, but are kids themselves at heart, and still love anime- that this anime may be best left here on amazon and not in your home if you are not into what I just described in my review.",1390089600,7,1228,4.424778761061947

8613409,1,B00F9F975A,"The anti-hero is more than a pervert and now is crossing into rapist mode nearly half the time. I understand having an anti-hero is this show's main thing but when he's even worse than most anti-heroes and is involved in various rape things I kind of wonder if this is a little too far even for  a anti-hero. Again this show bogs itself down in fanservice though honestly that's the only reason for it's existence is T &A of various anime girls including a loli girl that is include for extra creep factor.  The plot is nearly nonexistent and involves our ""anti-hero"" going to some magical other world doing exciting things over there and coming back to high school in the regular world. Again if the show focused more on his deeds in the magical other world and not his high school life this would be a better show. I mean the fantasy world is a D&D style one that seems interesting and would be a better setting than this high school. Anyway one of his vanquished foes in the fantasy world entrusts his pink haired daughter to him as a slave basically, thanks a lot dad. Mostly the show lounges around a lot with it's fanservice being the main forefront and whatever student competition they are doing in this show that involves magical powers also.  We have also an ominous student body president floating around who never does anything really and acts like he is president of some small country.

They finally towards the end try for a plot but it's too late as we have wasted time enough with visits to the female underwear shop and the beach in some episodes that when we finally get to any plot the show is about over since it's only 12 or 13 episodes long.
But alas trying to hope for a plot and excitement out of a fanservice show is a lost cause especially since it's seems intent on keeping on it and making our anti-hero a rapist basically.",1519689600,,1852,4.454277286135693
