7786307,5,B01HEXVLEE,I preordered this series love the new voice of issie. I have to say that this is there best season yet. And loving the child hood friend joining the regluar cast. And thats all im going to say about this series i don't want to give too much away so if any one wants to see what happens then you just need to watch it its well worth your time to watch.,1467849600,3,351,3.888888888888889
7786308,5,B01HEXVLEE,"The third and arguably the best season of this series, the first focus is on Koneko's story as she and the rest of the Occult Research Club travel to the underworld for their summer training camp. The opening has Issei awaking in a very extra-large bed in a very extra-large bedroom with the naked Asia and Rias. The house was ""remodeled"" overnight into a 9-story palace of sorts where all members of the research club live,along with Issei's very understanding and unflappable parents.
The trip to the underworld starts right after class lets out and summer starts. While Issei's horn-doggery remains well above reasonably normal levels, he is starting to mature, both in his perceptions of life and his relationships with the girls; not so much that it would sour those of you that want to relive your lives through Issei's adventures,mind you, but he is discovering there is more to life and relationships that ""just boobs."" This is a very good series and, the icing on the cake is, it seems the story is far from over.",1467849600,7,1022,4.747191011235955

Ddraig's reaction to becoming the 'Breast Dragon Emperor' and 'Grabbing Dragon' is priceless.  There is material there to work towards a 4th season, if they really want to, and Issei is growing into his powers more and more.

7786322,5,B01HEXVLEE,"It took me a long time to finish watching High School DxD Season Three. Now I have finished it I can't think why I ever got bored with it. All of the expected elements are there; Rias and Akeno are hot, Issei is horny and the underworld is still a mess. There is action and fan service aplenty. So there are plenty of jiggles and explosions to go round. The Japanese soud track is great and the visual stuff is handled as well as ever.
I was a bit worried that High School DxD might go the way of Ikki Tousen and lose it's sense of humour as the series developed. IT started out as fun, action packed and fan service heavy but soon lost its way and its sense of humour. High School DxD is exploring new plot areas and is getting darker moments but the essential story of a dysfunctional family and the love they share for each other is still there. Oh and there's lots of fan service too.
So this is just what you expect but that's no bad thing. I hope there's a series 4.",1506816000,4,972,4.121052631578947

7786325,5,B01HEXVLEE,"Otaku John, the super-fan of anime, manga, and light novels here to review Season 3 of High School DxD, aka: High School DxD Born.  By the time you're considering season 3 of high school dxd, you must've seen seasons 1 & 2, and liked them both. If that's the case, then don't hesitate and go ahead and buy season 3 sight unseen. I did, and it was worth every penny. This season boosts everything we all love about high school dxd up to a new level of awesome. As always, the characters, animation, storylines, & voice acting, are all top-notch. This season the action gets more intense, the fan-service more crazy, and the comedy even funnier. I feel the last episode was a bit rushed and should've been stretched into two episodes, but hey, when everything else is perfect, who can complain?  Looking forward to getting Season 4 when it comes out next year!  Once again, I highly recommend reading the mangas too.  And if you like this series, check out the anime ""Samurai Girls / Samurai Bride"".  It has similar themes and is great comedy.",1503878400,2,1041,4.575268817204301

7786333,5,B01HEXVLEE,"One of my favorite animes ever. It has nudity and adult language. Think of being a teenage boy around your friends, but in a fantasy world where women want you, and expose themselves for really no reason at all with some good plotlines dealing with angels, demons, and some old world gods thrown in for good measure, and you have this show. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll quote lines to you're amazing lady friend who, somehow, enjoys watching this for years to come. Bascially, if you're an older dude you'll get to relive your teenage years in a way that has zero accuracy. If you are an older teenager then you'll enjoy repeatedly saying ""Why don't this happen in real life"" every couple of minutes.",1500422400,,704,4.64
7786334,5,B01HEXVLEE,"The story continues on it's course and it got plenty of laughs out of me. Not to rain on anyone's parade but the ecchi is getting much. The girls are out....literally all the time. Never bothered me before, have plenty of other anime in this category centered around harems (I might be obsessed). And if I start to get uncomfortable and think it's overkill, that's a problem. Still it doesn't take away from the plot (which is why I gave it 5 stars). Just when I thought they would run out of things for the Devils to take care of, I'm thrown for a loop. And that ending! I'm in my feelings for sure on it.",1499385600,2,606,4.232758620689655

7786342,5,B01HEXVLEE,Very good continue from the previous DxD. Many who have seen this series from the beginning that their are new voices in this one. A few main character voices had to go to do other things but most stayed the same. I really did love this series though to me I felt this series was a little rushed. Most have a great bond connection with character but felt it was kinda rushed and kinda less fighting action unlike DxD2. But it was still enjoyable and was a fun series show to keep watching. Wonder what will happen next?,1491350400,,519,4.3061224489795915

7786359,5,B01HEXVLEE,"This is my favorite season so far!
Unfortunately, it doesn't have the 'Unresurrected Pheonix' OVA episode, but it does have the 6 OVA shorts. And it's DEFINITELY worth mentioning that the 2nd Blu-Ray disc has the full uncensored 'Oppai Dragon' music video, titled under 'Promotional Video 2' in the Extras. It's such a great song, and makes season 3 all the more memorable.",1483660800,2,373,4.936507936507937
7786360,5,B01HEXVLEE,"- Synopsis: The 3rd season of the series. The stakes are bigger and badder now that Ragnarok is threatening the world as they know it. In order to prepare, the group is going to have to endure some intense bootcamp if they are going to hope to win. This anime also showcases some additional backstory of other characters that were fairly lacking, such as Koneko's family. Once again, with over-the-top babes and intense no-holds-barred action, their adventures start once more.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Issei is a pretty likable and relatable guy. I mean, aren't most guys like him? Or at least were like that at some point? For Issei, life is good. When he's surrounded by waifus, what more can he ask for? I guess more waifus. He's just a simple-minded guy that cherishes his friends and wants his own harem. Which more or less becomes true. Though Issei, like many other main characters that are not gifted with brilliant minds, must work hard in order to become stronger.

There's even more uncensored goodness in this! They also showcase even more devils, fallen angels, and angels. If you are knowledgable about various lores and mythologies, you'll be seeing plenty of familiar names. The amount of fighting has also intensified, as well as some of the fight scenes just being totally cool and destructive.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 12 on 2 DVDs with a run time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence and sexual content.

- Conclusion: Like fan-service or waifus in general? You should like this too. There's more of an emphasis on some of the other character's backstory, which is nice. Furthermore, if you've been a fan of the series for awhile, you'd better make some more room for your anime collection; as things heat up once again in this season!

7786368,5,B01HEXVLEE,"A worthy addition to the series, High School DxD Born, the third season of the amazing Ecchi Harem series, is a true joy to experience. While I'm none too crazy about the English Dub, it is at least bearable, and the Blu-ray includes original Japanese Audio as well as English Subtitles which is definitely how I recommend experiencing it the first time.

The story this time begins as Rias Gremory and her host of Demon retainers go to an Underworld Boot Camp, and the series introduces a slew of new characters expanding the story beyond the Christian themed Heaven vs. Hell motifs and introduces characters from other pantheons such as the Norse God Loki. Fans of the previous two seasons will be happy to know the story continues to dial up the fan service to 11, while not losing sight of advancing the plot or including lots of action. By the end of BorN you will feel as if most of the main cast has undergone some character progression, particularly Issei and Rias as they deal with their rising power, and conflicting feelings respectively.

The absolute best thing about this series is that while it doesn't once shy away from being a fan-service heavy ecchi harem anime, it manages to be so much more, with lots of wit, charm, and humor as well as action and character development that really drive the story forward. The story loves to give the secondary characters their time to shine as well and delve into their pasts to reveal they each have a lot to offer to the narrative. These side-stories never feel unwelcome and offer good pacing to allow plenty of screen time to all your favorites.

The blu-ray collection itself is excellent quality and like the previous entries there are 6 additional OVAs included catering exclusively to the fan-service of the series, as well as textless versions of the opening and ending credits. All in all a very worthy purchase.",1479686400,7,1879,4.722560975609756

7786396,5,B01HEXVLEE,"The 3rd season of this series and it's as entertaining as the other two seasons
The only drawback if you want to nitpick is the 2 replacement English VAs for the MC Issei and for Akeno the 3rd girl of Issei  harem other that that plenty of laughs plenty of action and plenty of ""plot"" just like seasons 1 & 2  I",1474416000,,311,4.0
7786397,5,B01HEXVLEE,"What can I say about a ""fan""static Anime that only gets better with each season. The Anime is very fan service oriented that falls right in line with the main character's whishes, hopes and dreams. Other than the normal slow or thick headed Issei, most male lead characters have this malady. The story follows mostly close to the lite novel series of the same name by Ichiei Ishibumi. With over 24 volumes to the lite novel series the story has a long way to go. The the author has created a unique today's world with Devils, Angels, Fallen Angels and major world religions and continues to expand it with the inclusion of the Norse Mythology. The other characters like Akeno's and Keneko's background gives more ""life"" to these already lively girls! And of course the ups and downs of Rias's and Issei's growing relationship as well the other girls in his growing Harem. It is a fun and quickly ended 12 episodes that leaves you wanting more. The story will only get better. The increasingly more interesting story line and new characters being introduced is a guarentee this series will continue and will garner more fans!",1474416000,3,1124,4.739795918367347

7786399,5,B01HEXVLEE,"more of the the red dragon emperor, and friends , and his many antics.

i mainly watch this series due to it having a type of story in all directions
comedy, friendship, echi, fan service, serious, feeling moments, drama, ect all are there and born dosnt fail to deliver

only issue i had was the voice for Akino was changed? , other then that the cast remained the same i think, with new friends/enemies arriving in the mix

very action packed , with comedy and fan service interlaced here and there, enough to get you laughing and enjoying the more serious moments when hey hit (the feels.... )

more development of new and old characters , overall a good watch and better to add to the growing dxd collection

Season 4: ?
plans for a season for have been teased , with some hints that link to loki, and 20+ children of issai's from the future( time traveling to the past)

maybe we get to see who he hooks up with, i can only imagine the comedy/stories to come",1474243200,,963,4.351955307262569

7786403,5,B01HEXVLEE,"Season 3 is just as amazing as seasons 1 & 2! Lots of new characters to fight, a TON of character development for our wonderful little mascot, Konoko, more training than ever before & from some amazing new folks. And watching Issei truly ""dig deep"" in order to further prove his love and commitment to Rias who desperately needs her prized servant once again - more than she ever expected, I'm sure. The artwork was great, the music & writing were exceptionally well done also. The creators / production company did not coast on the popularity & presence of the first 2 seasons and absolutely stands on its own without any help whatsoever. You certainly need the back story of 1 & 2 to absorb ""Born"" fully, but it doesn't lean on them to make it a viable season - everyone does a great job once again & keeps the throttle all the way to the floor as we've come to expect from the HSDxD ""universe"". 

The ONLY drawback is the unfortunate absence of Teri Rogers for Akeno - her ability to properly bring Akeno to life in a way that made, and kept her: cute, comedic, sexy, and the perfect friend / ""big-sister"" (as to more than just Rias) has been flawless. And the cutsie-esque & simultaneous sexy sort of ""lisp"" for Akeno was adorable. It wasn't remotely a bad job this season, just unfortunate Teri was unable to return. (Grelle did perfectly well as Issei, fully brought his A-game & blasted it out of the park. Not that Freeman didn't do an excellent job the 1st 2 seasons, but his actions are impossible to ignore & simply don't deserve further ""thumbs up"".)

Everyone else brought their own, respectively returning A-games and left ZERO sense of phoning it in as the consummate professionals they are. Was SOOOOO glad Chloe Daniels returned for Asia since she hasn't been doing anything else for FUNi since HSDxD2. She was perfect once again - would love to hear more from her. The full cast pulled season 3 right into the collective excellence of 1 & 2. And while I've never heard or read any buzz on a 4th season, I sure would love to see that happen! I'll be first in line for it - sight unseen!

Side Note - I'm unsure where or why another reviewer paid $96 for the LE of this season. I can't even find it for that price here from ANY vendor. And definitely wouldn't have purchased at that price for only an art box. I'd have waited for it to drop although I've only ever seen it at 67 bucks for the LE version. The ""regular"" boxset has been 47-50 bucks dating from the 1st day it was available for preorder; rather, those are the only prices I ever saw. And I'm pretty studious about staying on top of the series for which I'm waiting on preorders, street & release dates, etc. Nevertheless, as much as I love the series in its entirety, & although I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it, in full without hesitation, to any anime fan........I wouldn't pay a hundred bucks for a single season if it was the last one on the planet. And that's saying something - My home collection is over 700 different titles and nearly fills a wall to wall, floor to ceiling shelving setup in my 3rd / spare bedroom that's become my ""nerdery"" for anime boxsets & a handful of tchatchki & collectibles over the years.

Seriously, they're great - but they are NOT imperative for ownership to the point of emptying my wallet with reckless abandon, lol. At 100 bucks I'd stick to streaming online until the price dropped. Or I'd buy it used, then rip to digital to ensure a previous use/owner's usage didn't leave me with scratched media. ",1473811200,,3511,4.469578783151326
7786404,4,B01HEXVLEE,Who ever did the translation to English didn't do the same as the English subtitles in some places. Over all it was just as good as the last two. Can't wait for season 4,1473552000,,169,4.0
7786405,5,B01HEXVLEE,"The ecchi adventures of Issei, the would-be harem king, enjoyably continue in Season 3. The first two seasons were a fun mix of silliness, sexiness and fairly serious story, and that successful formula continues in this newest season, High School DxD: Born. For those who don't know, High School DxD tells the story of high school student Issei Hyodo, an honestly perverted guy whose hopes of getting a girlfriend someday are pleasantly fulfilled in episode 1 of season 1, that is, right up to the moment that his new, cute girlfriend turns into a fallen angel and kills him, due to him being a possessor of a ""sacred gear"" a magical artifact that is stored within his body. To his surprise, he's revived by his high school's great beauty, Rias Gremory, to serve her as a servant devil. He discovers that he's become Rias's pawn, along with beauty Akeno who serves as Rias's magically powerful, sadistic queen, loli mascot Koneko as a super tough, super strong rook, pretty boy Kiba as a speedy sword wielding knight. We were then introduced to the adorably moe Asia (pronounced Ah-Sia) as a bishop with healing powers. Season 2 would bring female Xenovia on board as another knight, and Gasper as a vampire bishop trap.

Season 3 sends the group on a training trip to the underworld, and the pulling in of more pantheons, notably the Norse gods as well as more legendary figures from different cultures around the world. As in the past, we have another arc focusing on one of the members of Rias's servants, in this case, Koneko, though we also get more focus on the relationship between Rias and Issei, and some focus on Akeno's dealings with her fallen angel father. We're also introduced to a new female character, the Valkyrie Rossweisse, though not much time is spent learning about her, as happened with the other characters. Her story will need to wait for a hoped for season 4.

What worked in the past works well here, and there is plenty of cheerful, forthright nudity and sexuality romping around in here, along with a solid story. Some shows are coy about being ecchi; High School DxD revels in it, and it remains a breath of fresh air. So, plenty of nudity to behold.

This set includes a very nice bonus in the form of 6 mini-OVA episodes of around 3 minutes each, which focuses on ecchi fun with a particular limited number of characters. If you've wanted to see Greyfia in the nude, here's your chance.

I do find that the artwork is good but it's not quite up to the first two seasons. Alas, not included is a full length OVA which actually does build on the storyline a bit. Previous OVAs that were included as manga-bundled special releases in Japan were fun throw away stories. This new OVA really amounts to a 13th episode, as it revisits Season 1 heavy, Riser Phoenix, as his younger sister, Ravel, asks for Rias and Issei's help in getting Riser's mojo back, having lost his confidence since losing to Issei. It sets up Ravel for becoming what she eventually does in the light novels the anime is based on, another member of Issei's harem.

Still, these are minor quibbles. We have significant world building, some good time for characters who needed it, oh, and did I mention that all the girls now live with Issei? The bouncy fun continues, Issei gains yet another ecchi power, this set is full of great extras. If you liked the first 2 seasons, you'll love this season. And if you're looking for an anime that's proud to be an ecchi anime, pick up all 3 seasons now; it'll save you time ordering seasons 2 and 3 after you love season 1.",1473379200,,3563,4.604724409448819
7786406,1,B01HEXVLEE,"This review is not based on the quality of the anime.
I just don't understand why this box was 93 dollars. this is pretty much a standard Funimation limited edition, which is just a nice looking box and that's it. normally these go for 60 dollars so I assumed this had more stuff with it. but as the description said it, is just the show with extras.
I would just like to hear a justified reason for why this was so expensive.
Again I love the show and what Funimation do, but this was just plain overpriced",1473120000,7,507,4.237113402061856
