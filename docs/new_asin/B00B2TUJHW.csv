8561656,4,B00B2TUJHW,"In a Korean movie ""In Another Country"" (""Da-reun na-ra-e-seo""), Isabelle Huppert (""The Piano Teacher"") plays Anne - to be precise, three ""Anne""s - a French woman in a sleepy seaside town of Mohang. Directed by Sang-soo Hong (""Turning Gate"" ""Night and Day""), the charming little film describes in a playful way how each of Anne's interactions with the locals including a cheerful lifeguard ends up with different results.

Isabelle Huppert plays a woman named Anne three times, first in blue shirt, then in red dress, and finally in green. The first Anne is an acclaimed film director, the second a woman having an affair with a film director, the third a recent divorcee. The three Annes go to the same places (she wants to see a lighthouse, a possible Virginia Woolf reference), encounter the same persons, and even hear the same words, but all in a different context.

In the film nothing big happens. ""In Another Country"" offers small surprises and delights in its details about a woman in a foreign country - something pleasant but awkward the star Isabelle Huppert must have been feeling herself. This is a Korean movie (spoken in Korean and English), but the film's overall tone (with its minimalist approach) is closer to that of Eric Rohmer's.

The light-hearted film is an enjoyable but frequently whimsical medication on repetitiousness of life. Also, it is good to see Isabelle Huppert, known for her serious roles, bleating at goats.",1374969600,3,1445,4.962809917355372
8561657,5,B00B2TUJHW,"Luckily for us, Wonju (Jung Yumi), the young woman writing the script this movie is acting out, doesn't indulge in the writer's prerogative to command Isabelle Huppert's Anne to speak Korean, or the Korean actors to be able to speak to her in French.  As is, In Another Country, has the off-centered affability (preceding crankiness) of people struggling to communicate in each other's not quite fluent second language (English), and it gives Hong Sang-soo's movie a crusty texture and a satirical lan that has the actors seemingly working off of their verbal sea legs.  It's a wonder he didn't call it, In Another Language.
 After a pithy preamble, Wonju begins working through her anxiety over her family's sudden indebtedness by writing this script of interlocking tales, circulating action, dialog and shots, with the same actors in different scenarios, using people from her life, including Isabelle Huppert (a French woman she saw at a festival) in three different roles.  It takes a while for the loop to set up, but this traditional theatrical set piece takes off with a sweetly comic brazenness that has the fractured motion of drunken bumper cars.
 Wonju connects episodes by narrating from her burgeoning script, in which she has given herself the part of the proprietor of a kind of Korean Bed and Barbecue.  She states she's 25, but appears all of 12.  Jung Yumi is sprightly in this transitional function, and her narration is lilting and shapely. Huppert seems to be funnier and more girlish in English, and her physicality here is both a hoot and a charm.  She's still the existential stalwart, but with mincing steps and the worst goat impression ever (more Yoko Ono than Billy Goat).  The Lifeguard (Yu Junsang) has a sharp and gregarious comic timing that goes beyond the gag on linguistic barriers.
 It's an intricate, deceptively light-hearted slight-of-hand about cultural stereotypes and the jealousies and expectations they engender.  Wonju is not a major player in the action of the film, but it's good to remember this worried girl is the deus ex machina of the piece. The anxiety and distrust resulting from her family's situation erupt in repeated warnings of local dangers, a startling non sequitur in this nearly deserted and idyllic seaside town.  She siphons lack and loss and disruption through something approaching middle-period Woody Allen romantic comedy with a sexual resolution so awkward, you wonder if she even knows what fantasies are for.  In each re-occurrence, she promises to show Huppert the way to a small lighthouse, but with each return we find Huppert walking down the road by herself, searching for the lighthouse on her own.  This dreamlike disconnect follows through to the end, as Huppert toddles away toward ""a nice place"" on ""the unknown path.""  There's a progression from acceptance to non-acceptance, an ennui over the processing of disappointment and its conventions, all ending in a Soju induced drunk.  The movie has a beautiful sense of place, a wit with echoes, and the cast and crew to make it endearing.  A bright piece of filmmaking.",1369094400,2,3100,5.047058823529412
8561658,5,B00B2TUJHW,"This was the best movie I saw in 2012, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. It may help, if you watch the film, to like films in general, and be interested in them.",1365638400,3,168,3.9705882352941178
