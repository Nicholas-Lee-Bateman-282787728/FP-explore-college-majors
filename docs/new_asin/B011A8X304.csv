8723952,5,B011A8X304,The Aura 3-D sound on this disc is awesome!,1474848000,2,43,3.888888888888889
8723953,5,B011A8X304,"Amazing sounding cool mixes, really rock my LFE and make all my 7 channels (I upmix from 5.1) sound full range. Also uses the back channeles aggressively, but NOT gimmicky, which I like. Very cool blu ray for audio and nice slip cover. Also love that it comes with different layer of PCM OR DTS-HD OR lossless 96/24 stereo...and there's differnet song versions/remixes on different codecs! Never seen that before, very cool! I think PCM track with original album is best IMO however.",1468627200,2,483,4.831325301204819
