Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125
7980650,4,B000089744,"Just as Vegeta is about to take his last breath, The Champ shows up with old Buu. They are able to buy Vegeta enough time to beg the surviving Earthlings to lend Goku their energy. They have decided that the only way to kill Buu is to use a spirit bomb with everything the Earth has to offer packed into it.",1355875200,,307,4.049180327868853
7980651,4,B000089744,"The Majin Buu Saga is the last saga of DBZ.  The Majin Buu Saga is unlike any other saga in DBZ.  It doesn't take itself seriously like it did for the Android saga.  Majin Buu is a unique villain, though.  In the Majin Saga, Goku goes super saiyan 3 and Goten and Trunks fused to become Gotenks!
  The Majin Buu Saga does have the most death in it.",1048723200,,348,4.044117647058823
7980652,5,B000089744,"This DVD has got some of the last few episodes of the entire series.  As such they are far from disappointing.  As what is left of Dai Kaio in the good buu faces off against the raw madness of Bibidis original creation, Vegeta uses his tactical expertise to both revive the earth and its inhabitants.  Now it is left in the hands of humans to save themselves.  Quite harrowing when most people would rather get icecream and watch movies instead.  Meanwhile good buu gets pretty beaten up.  Goku realizes that SS3 is a little harder when you actually have a body so of course lets build a spirit bomb.  Kid Buu saga marks the final form of the last nemesis in Dragon Ball Z.  It is no wonder killing him is such a collaborative event.",1043625600,3,733,4.377777777777778
7980653,5,B000089744,"I saw these episodes in Japanese in subtitles.  What happens is everybody killed by Buu is wished back except Babidi and Dabura( who's in Heaven with Bulma, Videl, and Chi-Chi.  We see some old friends return to give their energy to *spoiler* Goku's Spirit Bomb.  Spoiler: We see Android 17, carrying a shotgun and wearing a trenchcoat; Android 8, Sinow, and Launch( good form).  The person who makes the wish is none other than *spoiler* Vegeta, yes Vegeta, I'm not joking about this; to Parunga, New Namek's Enternal Dragon, with Elder Kai *spoiler* with halo over head and KibitoKai *spoiler*( Supreme Kai and Kibito's fusion).",1021766400,2,630,4.9714285714285715
