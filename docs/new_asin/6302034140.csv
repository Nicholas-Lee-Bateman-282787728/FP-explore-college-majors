7821397,2,6302034140,"This is a ""B"" movie, at best.  But it was filmed in Beaumont, Texas, and several local sights and people are in it, including the late John Henry ""Bones"" Nobles and radio personality Gary Lee Love.  It is an interesting movie if you are from the Beaumont area.  Vince Edwards of ""Ben Casey"" fame, is the lead.  Local school teacher Carolyn Linscomb, who plays a short scene as a housewife, has the most beautiful smile in the world.",1268092800,,432,4.5
