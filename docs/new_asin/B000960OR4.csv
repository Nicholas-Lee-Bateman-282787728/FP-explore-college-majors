8057445,5,B000960OR4,Future has a heart of gold.  This is a great video for wave practice.,1471392000,,69,3.9285714285714284
8057446,5,B000960OR4,"(revised part) i watched future on anasma's other video and while he kills, slaughters and maims regarding his performance on her thang, his teaching here in his own project is like floating in and FEELING his knowledge.

(he's also great teaching alongside anasma in her videos, also available from world dance new york. they complement each others' work well.)

 he'd dated himself in anasma's vid by saying he's been doing this since '80, back when i used to steal from alexander's on fordham road, back when they'd smack down linoleum and that's why he's so riiiight-- he's before crack, poverty, capitalism/gentrification, mass imprisonment/enslavement of our men/boys interrupted the teachings and lessons of power and honor in our neighborhoods. he's  a line to the original inspiration and beauty, and beyond and above simple ""technique."" you've gotta get the philosophy and imbibe it, live it, feel it, and sing the song in your way. it's not just dance. it's empowerment, joy, resistance and freedom. it's a way of doing/being.

i read reviews of dance DVDs and i scratch my head because it all seems so surgical and stilted. i'm trying to find the larger mystical connections as my own art evolves and it's dry out there in the way of teachers who've been dragged behind the trucks of their artistic endeavors. art will kick your behind... if you're doing it right.

(back to passion/discipline and the eternal balancing act)

so i'm glad i found this. future's a whole experience. he's culture, too. he's GROWN and i'm grateful for some challenging adult artist teachings. reminds me of home and the artists and teachers and philosophers who made me the artist i am today. you've gotta have a base, a grounding before you're putting tinsel on anything.

anyhow, i hope future does a series of DVDs where he authors the time/delivery because he's a natural. i could just watch him teach without even moving because he's a wild lullaby. you just could watch and watch and listen. his voice and body and spirit move all in the same direction and he intuits his students' minds well.

this is what we were supposed to have brought to america. soul and heart. time for a return to that and let technique and flash sit out the first dance. this is a form of prayer and ""i was here"" graffiti. a song. all that gushy art stuff. passion with discipline. that's what future's work apparently seems to be about. fusing passion and discipline with giving back and teaching another way of ""telling stories"" with your dance.

and with the audacity and pomp of ""i was here."" it's a beautiful thing. when it's beyond that ego thing. when it's ""you are here with me, too.""

thanks, future. that's why you look eternally young. because you are. so alive.

amazing of you to share your whole heart like that. you never rush through. so in the moment!

world dance new york is amazing for existing and building such a library.
(to do a series with future would be very ""future thinking"" because he's also straight up history and a lasting line to the future)
if world dance new york had more output, i'd be inclined to join a ""month of the vid club"" if they had one for different genres.
but it's gotta be expensive with all the hard copies and the system, just like with book publishing, i imagine.

(written earlier)

he's beautiful because he's beyond technique and into the philosophy and love of the dance and how to live life. see for yourself. so many others skate on surfaces like mosquitoes because they don't know there's a whole world under the surface of the water yet. i can see how it'd be hard to ""market"" him because the women imbibing all the bellydance vids should watch this for a nice foundation on getting the mind and body right with the mind.",1337731200,5,3793,4.722727272727273
8057447,4,B000960OR4,"The first reviewer for this program was very detailed and specific in describing the program so I won't repeat the contents.

DVD I: I found most of the material in this section very useful for my specific dance style which is tribal, (belly dance). I absolutley love the wave section with breakdowns and combinations. Future is totally confident in his dance theory/ technique and his concept includes using ""chi"" energy in movement or simply to mean add life/ breath to movement.

DVD 2: Comprises very cool and trendy footwork variations in preparation for the house dance mixes. A great concept in visualizing patterns on the floor such as a circle to step in and out of!

Both sections contain ""finding the rhythm sections"" for hip hop and house dance variations. These are exceptionally fun drills which evolve quickly into dance.

I recommend this dvd to anyone wanting to learn articulation in staccato or fluid wave movement, or simply learning the dance style, new moves, and taking it to the club. Overall, lots of fun; at times, a little too much talk.",1309651200,3,1064,4.861878453038674
8057448,4,B000960OR4,"I'll start with the Improvisational demo,It is about a 30 second demo, where he uses some of the moves he taught during the course of the dvd. I thought it was okay. I liked the performance on the WDNY trailer better.
I love futures teaching style it is peaceful and unrushed. He is an excellent instructorand his personality really shines through, with that these are definately moves that you will have to practice independent of the dvd, and this is definately a dvd you will have to use over and over. The instructor offered a generous amount of information, the running time is a little over four hours. He also utilizes zen/chi concepts while he is explaining the concepts behind some of the moves. There is a lot of talking on this dvd as well, this is not a, here is the move, lets drill instructional.
The talking did not bother me though, usually lots of talking on a dvd annoys me but for some reason it seemed to fit well.

Waves review and foot work review : A non-stop dance segment where he demonstrates the waves and steps taught. In the beginning he talks for a minute. I love the dance background that he uses. It is black with two red heartshaped shapes splashes with whites flmaes. It reminds me of a tattoo.
House waving combinations/ Improvisational demo

This is an excellent dvd. I am unsure what level of difficulty I would put this under. I do not think it is for a complete beginner, the breakdown seems pretty decent, but it is not done in a step one ,two, three type of format. Rather you are watching the instructor break it down slowly so you can pick it up. Most will probably not get the move down right after just one session, but the instruction is not so difficult that you won't get any part of the move at all. For the belly dancer that is into hip hop fusion, you will definately like this edition to your library. The concepts will not only help with the fusion dance but it is also helping with creaing dance.""Listen to your rhythms yah"" For the beginner or beginner intermediate, house and/or waving dancer, you will definately like this dvd. The only two things I thought was missing from this dvd was adequate practice time but because so much information was given I can understand not adding a lot. The second was the music,I simply didn't like it.

The instruction and structure reminded me of a dance workout dvd. Which I liked, because it helps the dvd flow together and for some strange reason it also helps me pick up footwork faster than just standing and drilling in place. Depending on how you learn that could be good or bad.

Pro's :
Amount of instruction is beyond phenomoninal
Dvd flowed well
Content was superb
The pace was well set

Cons:
Music-I didn't like it.
Sometimes the movements lead into other movements at too fast of a pace. Or he'll give you an example of a dance combination right in the middle of teaching you a dance move. While this may make the instruction more well rounded because you will be able to see how the move can be used or is used. It may also get confusing.
Drilling time- isn't really adequate, but he does string movements together well for instance the footwork is not only used once, you will see it again throughout the dvd, so there is some repetition.

Instruction: 3*=Compared to other similar dvd's 5*
Organization 4*
Content: 5*
Practice: 3 1/2*
Utilization of time: 4 1/2*
Overall dvd 4*

So is this dvd worth it?Absolutely for the price. Does is it fulfill it purpse? Yes the product description is exactly what you get in the dvd.

Again this is definately a dvd that will take practice and one that you can grow with.",1305244800,7,4755,4.790953545232274
8057449,5,B000960OR4,"Well, I did not think I would be dancing hip-hop, but Future has me doing a few moves now!  I even did some in heels! LOL! (if you do that, be very careful!!!)  He has a very pleasing and calming voice and leads you through each move slowly so that you can do it along with him.  You will flow right in to what he wants you to do.  Follow him and you will amaze yourself!  This is a great introduction to hip-hop and house dancing.  If you love the music, but you are afraid to go out on the dance floor, this will get you out there, confident that you can dance!",1300060800,3,563,3.938053097345133
