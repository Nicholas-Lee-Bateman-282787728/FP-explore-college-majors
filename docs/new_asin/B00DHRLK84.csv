5813801,4,B00DHRLK84,"This was a good zombie war flick, rating at about 3 1/2 stars so I rounded to 4.  My 40-year old son and I both enjoyed it.  I am very pleased to say it was NOT blood, guts and dismembered body parts.  While you see zombies from the very beginning, you just see them bite and move on while the victim turns into one of the undead (in as fast as 7 seconds)!

The story line is the zombie viral infection is all of a sudden upon us, spreading so fast and so hard while the government is trying to stop it.  Of course, Brad Pitt is brought in to try to help. There is some standard Hollywood BS, like the satellite phones would not have been able to get a signal in those circumstances, so smack the director for not catching that one.  All said, it was an enjoyable movie and also good in 3-D.  It also sets you up for a possible Part II.

BTW - These zombies are attracted to NOISE, so whatever you do, BE QUIET in the theater or one might just jump off the screen and come after you  :(  s-h-h-h-h",1371945600,3,997,4.0152284263959395
5813802,5,B00DHRLK84,"As a big zombie fan, if we watch World War Z, knowing it's intended to be a PG-13 movie, we'll know right away this isn't going to feature the blood and guts like any R or unrated zombie movie you've seen. Would it have been more drastic and horrifying with gore? Probably, but what is not seen and imagined can also be effective (see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre).

Keeping that in mind, WWZ delivers on its intentions. Put yourself in the shoes of the lead character, and you're cast into a hellish world where a sudden outbreak of ""rabies"" as they first called it, spreads like wildfire in the cities, causing havoc all around. In a desperate effort to escape the horror, Pitt's character's goal is to get his family to safety, and in doing so, is obligated to find the origin of the disease that has taken over the entire world.

WWZ is tension filled most of the way, and fills the screen with overwhelming amounts of zombies in some very unique and original ways not often seen in a zombie movie. These zombies are dormant shamblers when not stimulated by movers. But sound instigates them, and they sprint to ""life"", attempting to bite anyone who can serve as a host (which brings up a major plot point by the way). The ending sequence closes the film brilliantly, requiring some clever tactics along with agility and speed, as the zombies tend to amplify their ability to run and leap, oftentimes, jumping off rooftops, smashing to the ground, getting up and continuing the chase.

Zombies Locations: Major City, Israel desert city, airplane, night time airport, day time airport, apartment building, Research Facility with white painted walls (which would have been perfect for some blood if this was R).

3D: The 3D in WWZ looks very dimensional, with visible pieces that bring depth at a higher level you'd expect a 3D film to render it. A success in 3D, which also increases the dread of each horror scene. In addition to the powered 3D dimension, there are many instances where objects pop out of the screen, worthy of a good flinch back.

Movie: 4.8/5

5813803,4,B00DHRLK84,"If angst and second-guessing were natural resources, WORLD WAR Z alone could power the planet for years. Initially handed a $125 million budget but then escalating to $200 million, primarily because of seven weeks' worth of reshoots, this was one blockbuster them critics were tapping as the potential summer skunker. Detractors will surely rally around the ""This movie veers away from the book"" flag, and it's a valid gripe. This isn't an adaptation of Max Brooks' source material but more a hijacking of the guy's book title. The book takes place a decade after the zombie war and compiles a series of personal accounts as told by the survivors. It offers gripping insights regarding the abrupt crumbling of society, how the apocalypse impacted on a religious and geo-political scale. Brad Pitt presents us with a horror thriller that suffers some from schizophrenia. It promises to be this sweeping zombie saga but then backpedals into a third act that focuses on personal conflict. The film has flaws, absolutely. Still, I walked out of the theater with a paranoid grin on my mug, edginess in my bones. I think this movie's gonna make money, bad buzz and all.

Brad Pitt has had a fantastic film career for someone so homely. Here, he takes a page from Will Smith in I AM LEGEND. He plays Gerry Lane, a resourceful former investigator for the U.N. called back into the field to locate the source of the global zombie pandemic. Gerry isn't a gung-ho sort anymore. He'd rather stay and protect his family, but he's presented with an ultimatum: either get with the program or his wife and two young girls get kicked out of the safety of the command ship, the U.S.S. Argus. So off he goes to South Korea, escorting a wet-behind-the-ears genius virologist and hoping to track down Patient Zero.

My pals railed like fishwives that there weren't enough gore and blood and viscera, and they're not wrong. Way I see it, the budget had risen to such exorbitant heights that the suits freaked that the film wouldn't be able to recoup the cost. And so the hard R rating had to go because more people would attend a PG-13 picture. I'm a little surprised I wasn't as upset as my friends, but I was enthralled with the film's effective approach to classic Hitchcockian suspense. Your imagination does a lot of heavy lifting here. The first 20 minutes are as urgent and nerve-jangling an opening sequence as the one in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. I like that there isn't a set-up. There's a brief interlude in which the Lanes go thru their breakfast ritual. But then you're dropped in the thick of things and swept along by the escalated level of panic taking place onscreen. Philadelphia and Jersey become these terrifying, claustrophobic urban landscapes as the Lanes frantically wend their way thru the surging undead and the frenzied human mobs. In the dark, in my seat, I couldn't help thinking, ""If one person in this theater turns right now, we're all so screwed.""

It's probably a mutant super-power to be able to distance a film from its source material, to view it as its own animal. I think I have it. Or maybe I got caught up with the massive fun of watching this in a packed house, a victim of a more genial sort of mob mentality. These fast-moving zombies scared the crap out of me, and I'm sure part of that is how someone bitten can turn in twelve seconds flat. It's up to you to buy into the CG stuff. Some of the scenes are over-the-top, like how the zombies in 1srael swarm and pile like Internet trolls. The personal drama loses oomph as Gerry Lane's wife (Mireille Enos) spends huge chunks of the film with a death grip on that satellite phone, waiting for our main man to call. We maybe would've been more invested had Lane's family been placed even more under duress. It sucks that Mireille Enos isn't given better and more things to do, because I think she's good here.

The third act was supposed to have featured an epic invasion of Moscow, except that that was scrapped but for a few fleeting shots. Instead the third act culminates Gerry Lane's globetrotting quest in Wales, in a W.H.O. lab complex breached by zombies. This sequence features a downshift for how zombies are portrayed. The laboratory ghouls are near dormant, one scientist's exposition informing us that, unless activated by visual or auditory stimulus, they just aimlessly mill around like broke window shoppers at the mall. What unfolds in this sequence is tense stuff, but it also resurrects the more familiar zombie tropes. There may be some nervous laughter.

WORLD WAR Z, more than any other zombie film, captures the global scope of the zombie apocalypse. I loved the speed and urgency of the narrative, and how it realizes and sustains the harrowing feel of end-of-the-world jeopardy. No, it's no in-depth meditation on society's collapse. But it's a hell of a wild rollercoaster ride done on a breathtaking scale. And, as a throwaway comment, I loved the concept of the Tenth Man.

A few tips on surviving a zombie apocalypse (SPOILER alert):

- When driving away from a pack of zombies, don't turn around for an extended period to impress the importance of the seatbelt rule on your kids
- When navigating a gauntlet of noise-sensitive zombies, do turn off your phone
- Don't ever leave your bloody crowbar behind
- When trapped on a plane with an oncoming rush of zombies, stacking up luggage in the aisle sucks as a deterrent",1371859200,4,5414,4.728813559322034
5813804,5,B00DHRLK84,This movie will keep you in the edge of your seat.  Better than expected.  Scary without being grotesque.  I am buying it for my movie collection.,1371859200,4,146,4.538461538461538
5813805,2,B00DHRLK84,"Big dissapointment for a summer ""blockbuster"". The film starts off smartly and keeps you at the edge of your seat in the beginning when the plague first hits philly and Pitt and family get their first encounter with the zombies. Once on the run they get lucky until Pitts old boss sends a helicopter to pick them up and deliver them to an aircraft carrier on the eastern coast. From there the story gets more and more unbelievable as our hero jaunts across the world trying to find the origin of the disease and survives everything from multiple attacks to a plane crash. South Korea, Jerusalem, Wales. Our UN inspector is made of steel and figures out how to defeat the zombies. By infecting humanity with H1N1 meningitis!! Because the zombies won't eat an icky diseased person. Really?? Have not read the book, was hoping for a good zombie film and recieved instead a huge dissapointment. Wait until the rental and you will be thankful not wasting your money for this at the cinema.",1371859200,13,984,4.660919540229885
5813806,3,B00DHRLK84,"I was very much looking forward to seeing this film, but ultimately found it to be a somewhat average and mildly entertaining work.  There was nothing particularly special about it.  And, unfortunately, all the better scenes are in the two-minute trailer, so there's nothing really surprising about it.  The storyline dealt more with investigating the medical/biological source of the ""zombie"" affliction than the zombies themselves.  The zombies, in fact, felt like a plot device to drive the investigative angle of the story - nothing more.  For that reason, I found the film a bit disappointing and would not be interested in seeing it again.  I'm not even sure that I would be all that excited about a sequel, which is 100 per cent certainty.  Overall, I'd call this a tepid entertainment.  You won't want your money back, but you may wonder if it was well spent.",1371859200,11,867,4.890410958904109
5813807,3,B00DHRLK84,"Dubbed the largest budget zombie flick of all time, there is much expectation surrounding ""World War Z"". Brad Pitt's production company bought the rights to it in 2007 and has been working toward bringing it to the screen ever since. First of all, calling it the largest budget zombie flick of all time isn't really saying that much since zombie flicks are pretty much the territory of low or no budget filmmakers to begin with. Then you throw in Brad Pitt and put it into the middle of the summer blockbuster season and expectations go through the roof.

So, what should you expect? Well, sooner or later, the zombie genre is either going to infect the entire country or drown itself in over-saturation. There are 8 zombie movies slated to release in 2013 and there were 25 released in 2012; most of these are done by low or no budget filmmakers, but the number of zombie movies out there borders on the ridiculous. Lets also not forget the highly successful ""Walking Dead"" television show. ""World War Z"" is a step up in quality, but is it all it's cracked up to be?

Well just because it is part of the summer blockbuster season doesn't mean that it is chalk-full of action and events. It is a drama in its purest form. Many of the most action packed or awe-inspiring moments are revealed in the trailer and many of these trailer moments spoil some of the best surprises. Fortunately for ""WWZ"" though, its best moments aren't those heavy CG moments that are revealed in the trailer, but a simple scene where three lightly armed people have to navigate a building that is half infected or the moments that Gerry Lang (Brad Pitt) reveals that his true motivation is his wife and daughters.

Despite a couple of really coincidental moments that caused me to roll my eyes a bit (including a plane crash caused by Pitt's character and of course his seat is the only thing that survives the crash), ""World War Z"" is well written, fast-paced and well performed. To compare it to other zombie movies is like comparing Pepsi-Cola to a lemonade stand; both are good, but one has more money. To compare though, this zombie flick may focus less on the gore and blood than others and Brad Pitt is a tremendous actor that makes this zombie flick better just by his mere presence.

There's a catch to enjoying ""World War Z"" though; maybe two of them. First, you have to love zombie movies because it isn't anything more than that. Secondly, you have to lower your expectations. The movie isn't going to dazzle you in any way shape or form. ""WWZ"" is a human-interest story with the addition of really intense fast moving bloodthirsty zombies.",1371859200,4,2628,4.620985010706638
5813808,1,B00DHRLK84,"I saw it in the theater second day of it's release in 3D and -- being a Brad Pitt fan -- was absolutely horrified (and not in a good way) by this nonsense.

And yet I can't help noticing a lot of 5 star reviews -- almost as if it's being seeded by the studio -- for a movie that has no characters, none of the traditional zombie violence (there's a lot of shrieking and running, but nothing remotely approaching ""graphic"", and not a single head-shot, which is how you kill zombies... isn't it?), and a story that is just silly.

The camera does a lot of flash-panning and blurring, so it's almost impossible to tell what is happening -- which is probably for the best, because the director doesn't seem to have any interest in the story anyway.

Every sequence in this film, from the very beginning where Pitt and family have breakfast, devolves into a tedious clich.  The ""acting"" is pedestrian at best -- Pitt's two ""cute"" daughters are annoying enough that I actually found myself wishing they'd get eaten.  Every scene feels contrived and often like a cut-and-paste from another movie -- which I suspect most of them are.

The zombies are those high-speed dudes from 28 Days Later (now THAT is a zombie movie), and they make a lot of noise and shriek -- but someone decided to trim (or not even shoot) any kind of carnage, so while there are some spectacular crowd scenes (you've seen most of them in the trailer BTW) there isn't any visceral threat, little tension, and no horror to speak of.

The film makes the classic mistake that most Hollywood groupthink projects make: disrespecting the genre.  In ""Night of the Living Dead"" the dead rose and feasted on the living -- and no one wasted time trying to figure out why.  In ""28 Days Later"" a virus got loose, and the infected feasted on the flesh of the living -- and no one wondered why.  In Zac Snyder's silly remake of ""Dawn of The Dead"" one of the characters died, and then it was revealed that if you're not bitten you don't come back: so where did the first Zombie come from?  HINT: it didn't matter until the idiot screen-writer brought it up.

WWZ has Brad Pitt on a quest for Patient Zero (a la ""Contagion"" -- a great apocalyptic movie BTW) so they can do what?  Find a cure?  You turn Zombie TEN SECONDS!  Find a vaccine?  They BITE you!  It's like creating a vaccine for shark-bite!

By the time Pitt arrives at the final act you can anticipate the dialog word for word, and then it all turns into a Doom-like videogame.

But wait, maybe I was just jaded, with ridiculous expectations?  I felt so bad about feeling bad about this movie that I rented ""Mama"" just to see if I was having a bad day: ""Mama"" scared the pants off me.

WWZ?  Forget it!  This is the zombie movie you can take your parents to -- and then you can listen to them listen to them call you a wuss all the way home.",1371859200,42,2853,4.3719165085389
5813809,3,B00DHRLK84,"Clearly, the zombie pandemic is alive and well in the world of entertainment.  These creatures aren't just a new sensation, they've be relevant in film for quite some time now and depending on whom you ask, zombies originated in film at least as far back as the 1930s.  Regardless, zombie films have come a long way and evolved into a genre all its own, typically bordering on horror - but without a main protagonist to specifically lead the mayhem (unless you'd like to make a claim for George A. Romero).  With the recent success of the highly popular AMC drama, The Walking Dead, and the Resident Evil franchise, not to mention comedies like Warm Bodies and Zombieland - it would appear the undead are preparing to continue their reign of terror for quite some time.  And, you know zombies flicks are at the height of their popularity when Brad Pitt decides to sign on for a leading role.

Based on the novel of the same name by Max Brooks and directed by Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace), World War Z stars Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations investigator called back to action to investigate the origin of a ""zombie"" academic.  Originally reluctant to take the assignment, Gerry decides it's in the best interest to (reluctantly) leave his family and attempt to find a cure.  However, finding an origin or a cure becomes difficult when every major city in the world becomes devastated by zombie outbreaks - leaving Gerry with little options other than to keep moving from city to city.  Mireille Enos, Ludi Boeken, James Badge, and Fana Mokoena also star in supporting roles.

The film wastes little time, quickly turning to chaos on the streets of Philadelphia.  To be honest, the first half hour of the film feels like early episodes of The Walking Dead as we follow Gerry Lane, his wife, and their children, as they run from zombies on the street, through a building, and eventually face-off with them on a rooftop.  Essentially, that is what goes down in the first few episodes of The Walking Dead.  But, this isn't a Walking Dead comparison, and the fact that World War Z resembles a massively popular TV show is definitely not a bad way to start a film.  Zombie films should start off small, in a secluded area and then balloon from there - as the film does.

World War Z might just be the grandest (in terms of visual scale) zombie film ever made, with all major cities falling to an unknown disease that kills people and quickly reanimates them in death as flesh eaters.  Most zombie films don't take the time to provide a grand scale look at major cities, often simply focusing on one specific city and a small group of people trying to survive within it or at least escape from it.  This film takes Brad Pitt's character from one end of the earth to the other, beginning in Philadelphia and moving to South Korea, Jerusalem, and finally a health lab in Wales.  There's no shortage of travel, nor are there many scenes without a zombie trolling around.

You may have noticed from the synopsis or various advertisements that there is zero star power other than Brad Pitt.  This is - from beginning to end - a film dominated by Brad Pitt.  As he moves from one location to the other over the course of the film, he usually loses his supporting cast along the way (which shouldn't be too surprising).  Pitt portrays an observant character focused on the goal of finding answers, basically because he is blackmailed into it as a means to protect his family.  However, it is rather far-fetched to see the lengths army officers and other nations go to in order to protect him.  Evidently, Pitt's character really does mean a great deal to the survival of the human race - but that portion of the film is hardly understandable.  Far too many people lose their lives at the expense of allowing Pitt to move from one part of the globe to the other.  And, his character always manages to squeak his way out of danger.

If you didn't follow the film's production news (and most people don't), World War Z had quite a bit of footage needed after the completion of filming to fully explain the ending.  Even though the ending is relatively simple and climatically uneventful, it would have been much, much worse without the added footage (basically the final 45 minutes) to fully explain the film's ending.  Sadly (mainly due to the lack of bloodshed), the film simply goes through motions of coming to its simple conclusion.  There are virtually no scenes where you're on the edge of your seat and frankly, the film's final stanza lacks the appropriate amount of drama for a zombie flick.  For once, people actually act sensible when dealing with a group of zombies - which is admirable, yet still pretty boring.

As far as zombie movies go, World War Z isn't the best and it isn't the worst.  Still, the positives greatly outweigh the negatives.  The film is so full of action that it almost doesn't feel like a full-blown zombie flick.  It's not you traditional film about people hiding out and spending a film looking for salvation.  This film is about one man's goal to protect his family by investigating a global crisis - which just happens to be zombies.  Overall, Brad Pitt does an admiral job fighting off the well-designed villains - all while indicating he might even be back for some sequels sooner than later.

The bottom line:  if you're a Brad Pitt lover, this might be an iffy choice.  It will depend on your devotion to him and whether or not you can handle a borderline horror flick.  However, if you're a lover of The Walking Dead or simply enjoy action-packed zombie movies (minus things constantly popping out at you in typical horror movie fashion) - this film is for you.  You certainly won't walk out of this film disappointed.  In fact, you'll walk out looking forward to a promising sequel.

5813810,4,B00DHRLK84,"We'll just got back from the premier of WWZ and thought it was a great movie.  I'd give it a 3 1/2 stars but Amazon does not give this option.

Descent plot, great action throughout and a good ending to save the World.  I think I would have preferred to have a different opening to it before Pitt and family got hit in Philadelphia.  They said the white house got taken down, Washington DC whipped out and the president killed so that probably would've made a better opening scene even though it would not show show Pitt in the opening scene.

I thought the director did a descent job as well.  I had read several times the ending was entirely reshot as the original was too complicated.

Their was a scene taken off our very own Walking Dead that will not be a surprise to many when you see it.

If you could label the movie something it would be like ""Dawn of the Dead"" zombies on speed though.  Swarming Hordes were very impressive on the big screen, but the majority of these scenes were displayed at least in segments on several of the trailors.

We'll I hope for a good unrated DVD  to follow, director cut etc....

I think most will come away saying it was a good movie but just didn't blow them away.  I think some of walking dead episodes could be labeled as blowing you away however.  So for the amount of money spent I think the crew got an extended vacation in several countries in the process and maybe bigger pay checks then they should have?

I do have to commend them on doing such a movie showing the lack of gore and blood.  This was a big plus and should show others it's not really needed as most movies portray it these days.

This movie tries to be successful simply off of its name, CGI and having Brad Pitt.  The main character in the movie is an idiot who just happens to get lucky.  Least of all the one star rating is for the politically liberal undertones, which are far from subtle.

5813876,4,B00DHRLK84,"I'm not a great fan of zombie flicks, but I sort of liked this one. Brad Pitt stars an UN-affiliated special investigator who is caught up in a zombie apocalypse of unknown provenance. The first part of the film feels like every other zombie apocalypse you've ever seen: suburbia turns into zombie sprawl, we have to get to the roof of that abandoned building, the military mysteriously makes it, etc. Things eventually get more interesting. The finale has suspense, drama and some original twists.

It's interesting to note that the zombies very quickly get de-humanized in this production. In other zombie films, it's a clich that some grandmother or other loved family member turns into a flesh-eating monster, and we're not supposed to forget that the undead are really us. Indeed, this is what makes zombies so scary to many people! In this story, the zombies don't really feel human at all, not even when you see humans turn. They remind me more of weird aliens or swarming insects: bizarre, dangerous, incomprehensiblebut not really evil in the strict sense. And definitely not us.

For whatever reason, I liked this approach better.

The politically correct aspects of the film feel forced. Sure, the UN deputy general secretary is African, but the real heroes are all White males (except an Israeli elite soldier  no surprise there), while the poor womyn and girlz sit at home, more worried about their man than the end of the world. Blaaah! It was rather funny to watch the scene where Israel (of all places) opens the Wall to Palestinians, only to be punished for its sudden peacenik conversion by murderous zombie invaders (or is it a metaphor for ISIS?). As usual, the US military turns out to be the saviors of the world

My problem isn't so much with these stereotypes, per se, but that Hollywood thinks they don't show if they tack on some token minorities. Pro-tip: either go all the way *or* stay with the usual tropes. Except for the zombie trope, which was given a necessary overhaul in this flick.

In the end, I give World War Z four stars.",1517011200,,2062,4.761904761904762

5813889,2,B00DHRLK84,"If you're into the zombie genre, stick to ""The Walking Dead"". This review will contain spoilers.
First of all, time. There is not enough time in a movie to develop a story like this and the end result just left me dissatisfied. The film ends just as the protagonists find a stop-gap solution that might give them the space to find a real solution to the zombie outbreak. It then proceeds into a corny montage with a voiceover as the ending. In the ""Walking Dead"", they found basically the same ""camouflage"" idea, I think in the first season and several seasons later, the story is still not resolved. This time gave the ""Walking Dead"" makers time to develop a story, unlike ""Z"". The whole film feels rushed and unfinished. As a pilot for a tv series, it might work, but not as a stand-alone film.
Second, it strains credulity too far. Some examples (spoilers ahead): somehow, Israel has managed to wall out the zombie attack and this fact has drawn the Brad Pitt character all the way from S. Korea to figure out...something. They vaguely seek patient zero but, of course, the 'only hope' doctor shoots himself as they disembark in Korea (he's not Brad Pitt, after all) but not before he tells Brad Pitt something that you just know will become a flashback later (it does). He gets there and on his tour, some Arabs and Jews are singing a middle-eastern rendition of kumbayah. Well, the zombies are attracted to sound and they are really singing it - peace in the middle east and all that. In a matter of seconds, Israel is overrun with zombies that wanted to join the singing. That's all it took.
So the 'heroes', after Brad Pitt uses a knife to lop off a female IDF member's hand with a casual flick of the wrist after she is bitten, flag down a departing commercial jet and escape. They need to get from Israel to Wales where there is a W.H.O. facility. Well, a zombie stowed away in the toilets and soon (again, seconds), half the passengers are zombies. Seconds later, Brad Pitt lobs a grenade and blows the side out of the jet and they crash, but no worry: they crashed in the exact place they were trying to go: Wales - walking distance from the W.H.O. Not only did they get there in seconds, but Brad Pitt and his IDF buddy are the only survivors of the crash. It seems the director wanted to develop some kind of bond between them but, again, time, and the other passengers - well, they're not Brad Pitt.
There, BP injects himself with one of the most deadly diseases known to man as his 'camouflage'. He makes it out past the zombies and in another montage, he gets a tiny injection that is supposed to cure him of this disease. I was once bitten by a dog and spent two days on IV antibiotics. It's just not believable.
And that's the whole story. Why so many spoilers? Because it's not worth watching for the story anyway. It's films like this that have turned me off of films altogether. I don't know how they used to do it. Films like ""Terminator 2"" managed to tell a coherent story complete with explosions and special effects in the length of a film. But it seems rare to find a story in a film nowadays, and that's why I look to TV if I want to watch something, and in this case, this film and ""The Walking Dead"" are the same story, one done well, one not.",1511481600,2,3272,4.400990099009901

5813923,4,B00DHRLK84,"When I first saw this film in 2013, I wondered why Brad Pitt's and Leonardo DiCaprio's production companies competed for the rights to Max Brooks' book. Aside from the title, only the slimmest of similarities remain. In fact, so little of Brooks' work remains that the film's location-by-location race and treasure hunt feel more like Dan Brown wrote the script.

The first half hour has one of the best intros of any zombie film, barring the highest in the genre (either Dawn of the Dead, 28 Weeks Later).

Pitt's charisma holds much of the film together. The settings range from collapsing Philadelphia to UN flotillas to South Korea, Israel and Wales. There's a lot going on here, and some carefully woven elements are spelled out later in the film through exposition for those who can't put it together. The aerial shots of smoking, ruined cities look great. The hive-like swarming zombies add a touch of originality in approach, even if the alleged source material favored slow, Romero-like undead.

Plot holes abound, but so what. It's a zombie film. One with bloated production values that make it look really good, as opposed to the 1-star efforts that look like student films and can be found gratis on your Prime queue. For instance, I can't imagine Israel would believe a single wall would keep the zombies at bay. All fortifications, back to those of the ancients, had layers of stand-off defense and ways to seal off portions of a castle-fort-compound that had been penetrated. No CWIS or Iron Storm guns or unmanned aerial vehicles or unmanned ground robotics or GMLRS ... I could go on. I won't. You get the point.

My only true issue with the movie is that, like a Dan Brown book or film, it dissolves like cotton candy after you're done enjoying it. It's all lead-up with a rushed conclusion, no doubt related to budget overruns and production issues that nearly tanked the release. Contrast with ""28 Weeks Later,"" an underappreciated sequel to ""28 Days Later"" that is painful to watch in its treatment of surprisingly well-developed characters.",1501545600,,2062,4.882857142857143

I love the CGI effects and the scene (possible spoiler alert) where the zombies pile on top of each other to climb the wall and end up jumping over it, was not only scary and nail-biting but so well done.

That said, they should have called this movie, ""World War Z-Z-Z-Z's"", as in 'Y-A-W-N'ss, starring Brad Pitt & a cast of nobodies!
To anyone who watches this film, you will only get your $$$'s worth from the opening scene & subsequent chaos in Philly. After that, the movie becomes boring,........ b-o-r-i-n-g,........... B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!!!
You keep getting introduced to emotionally flat, cardboard supporting characters so quickly, one after the other like going thru cheap suits lined & hung up in a dept store rack and then disappear just as fast- that the viewer is never given enough time to understand their purpose or have empathy for thus I found myself unable to root for them.
The zombies themselves are mainly background clutter & are never given any characterization or lengthy screen time to be considered really 'villainous' or scary.
Brad Pitt turns in yet another in a long line of his ""little boy lost expressions while implausibly coming up with cliched last sec ideas to escape or solutions to disasters"" performance, which he's made a career of. And considering he's the only 'credible actor' in this film, that ain't saying much.
If you're looking for similar zombie-themed flick only with some real suspense, I recommend you check out ""Train To Busan"" instead!

5813960,1,B00DHRLK84,"I honestly don't see what people like about this film.
I will break it down a bit more but to summarize it was a rather mediocre film and probably the lamest big budget zombie film I have ever seen.
Previously I could never get more than fifteen minutes into the film, after trying to watch it on several occasions, as I found utterly boring and canned. It really did nothing that practically every zombie movie made in the last twenty years hadn't already done.
Lately I have been reading the actually book which got me thinking of watching the film again, not finished with the book yet but I figured the film would be pretty different and boy was I right.

Cinematography -  was okay but tends to focus on things that I really don't care about in the story. The action was pretty over the top and completely unconvincing of a zombie apocalypse. Running zombies, okay that's the modern take on it, but flying ninja attack zombies that use their skulls as battering rams? That's just stupid really, hell they didn't even eat anyone just bit and ran which made no sense.

Characters and plot - dumb, one word says it all. I didn't care about anyone and the ones I did were brushed aside as inconsequential to the film. The main character is completely boring, he really doesn't involve me at all nor does the main story of the film.
Oh suddenly theres zombie outbreak everywhere, we had no idea, everyone dies, waaaah. The film completely loses any sense of probability and destroys the willing suspension of disbelief.

Compared to the novel - There really is no comparison, I'm not even finished with it and I can say the film was a waste of time. The book has a lot of great ideas and a plausible scenario (even if a few things are over the top) for the global spread and epidemic of the zombie virus. It relies on real world events and occurrences and uses a variety of locations and viewpoints to tell the tale in a way that makes it easy to suspend disbelief and feel engrossed in something that feels like it's relating a real tragedy. The film relies on hokey clichs and set pieces to try and tell a massive story that is fumbled before they even get started.
The book makes this event personal and relate-able, from the onset and patient zero to the fall of massive cities and military impotence it all feels more plausible. The film is B-movie grade story at it's best.

I think the biggest loss for the film was the lack of focus on the moral decisions that are prevalent in the book, it's very heavy on morality and survival decision making. From everyday people making hard decisions to world leaders making painful choices to save humanity, it all has impact and is delivered directly without declaring right or wrong decisively. The film hardly touches that with a ten foot pole, it is used as a short whip for the main character and nothing else, all of the drama of the original material is tossed aside for a forced bs drama of one family. And that is such a waste.

The source material is great, it feels like a real documentary of a horrible time for the world, and the film tosses everything out the window to make just another garbage cheesy modern zombie film.

Best suggestion is don't waste your time, read the book.",1489536000,6,3241,4.511073253833049
5813961,4,B00DHRLK84,"This is a very good movie.  The action starts almost immediately.  It is engaging, intense and smart.  The acting is very well done.  And it brings something new to a genre that is a bit over done.  To me Z transcends its genre.  The only thing that I would change (SPOILER ALERT) - is the plane scene.  Brad Pitt's character survives a great many things and you can buy most of it - but what happens at the end of the plane scene is just too far.

5814032,1,B00DHRLK84,"Before watching WWZ, I hadn't watched a zombie movie unless you count 'The Last Man on Earth' or 'Night of the Comet' as one. I just don't have the stomach for them, don't pardon the pun.

My criticisms of WWZ are there directed at the movie's problems in general not whether it adhered to some unstated rules for Zombie movies.

The movie is fast paced. Performances are all fine but the movie doesn't exactly demand great acting skills from its cast.

WWZ's problem is the plot which has gaping holes in it.

A grenade in an airplane not causing a total structural failure rather than a hole in the fuselage.
A zombie on the plane for hours without detection or violence
The inconsistencies in level of noise that wakes the zombies. Planes taking off or landing at an airport not drawing the zombie hordes.
That plane couldn't have gotten off the carrier and to South Korea from the Atlantic Ocean
How did that boy elude capture in the apartment house?
The Speakers in Jerusalem when it is known sound draws the zombies. BTW why didn't the planes in and out of the airport draw them? Planes taking off are extremely noisy.
Pitt telling the UN guy that he's on I-95 when it is obvious he isn't.
How did Pitt and his family get to New Jersey from Philadelphia? You have to cross the Delaware river and the RV was last seen driving parallel to the river and the bridges were clogged with traffic.
The daughter getting the rifle in the RV. What's this, Show & Tell?
The death of the epidemiologist was pointless.
A nuclear explosion not explained. The EMP knocked out Pitt's cellphone but it was again working later on.
The superathleticism of the zombies.

Look the genre is saturated, if your not going to do the the classic zombie flick, i.e. Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, or the updated versions, i.e. 28 Days and Weeks later, what is the point? Oh your trying to reinvent the genre? Well you failed miserably.

PG-13? Please! Pure garbage. It started off well, but quickly De-evolved into an around the world treasure hunt for answers to the zombie plague, And the cheesy Hollywood ending? Give me a break. If you don't understand that these movies are supposed to be apocalyptic in nature, then sit down and make a kid's show. Zombie fans want zombie movies where people get torn to shreds, and bullets and axes tear through zombie brains. Absolutely none of that going on here.

In-Depth Review

The story starts out fairly simple, a father who has the choice to stay home, or continue with a job that keeps him away from his family. The story quickly takes off with the introduction of a plague spreading like wild fire, and our protagonist is summoned once again into his work field, using it to give his family a better chance at survival as the price for his services. From their, the story literally runs from one-action-packed scene to the next, and while the ending is not conclusive: there is hope for humanity.",1476403200,,728,4.816

There is a zombie outbreak - if you're bitten by a zombie, you do not have to die to turn - turning is almost immediate. Gerry is a retired UN Investigator and his wife, Karen and 2 kids, seek shelter from an old friend. They end up on a warship.

The hunt for patient ZERO is on (in the hope to find a cure). Gerry is blackmailed into going with the crew. If he does not, his family will be moved to the mainland - he agrees because of his family's safety. Things unfold and you just have to watch it to find out what happens next!!!

Yes, Brad Pitt looks good, and, if you're trapped with a bored middle-schooler (almost as bad as a zombie), the film will entertain him/her. That's about it. Brooks is a talented writer, and I felt the fear and panic and hopelessness of people under sudden attack when I read the book. The movie shows people running and screaming, and, suddenly, in their midst, we see...zombies. Maybe if I hadn't read the book first, I might have enjoyed the movie more.

The story itself is significantly diminished by the oxymoronic concept of a ""family friendly"" Zombie movie and the ridiculous plot holes such as Israel's inability to recognize that loud sounds attracts the Zombies. The unrated version is superior to the theatrical release in that the additional intensity and gore offsets the ""choppiness"" and uneven aspects of the theatrical release. The only reason I didn't give WWZ 5 stars is because of the gaping plots holes and the screen time wasted on the unrealistic use of a SAT phone in the midst of a global crisis.",1474675200,,720,5.0588235294117645

SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't seen the movie do not read past this point!!!!

I really like how the zombies move as quickly as they do. It adds to the fear and fast paced world the characters live in. It also made it so realistic when even his wife and daughter were removed from the aircraft carrier because they were no longer valuable. The military needed to make space for people/resources they actually needed on the ship; I totally get that. The most interesting thing for me was that the zombies did not attack those who were sick or weak as come to find out later in the movie. I'm not sure if/when a sequel will ever come out but if it does, it would be great for them to really build on that fact.

It was a completely different story that was clearly written just to make a movie out of an idea. Nothing in the book pointed towards infecting yourself with a deadly virus as a form of zombie inoculation. They fought a war.. a hard war.. a war that took a huge toll on mankind. It was brought to us through first hand accounts gathered through many, many individual interviews.  There wasn't one central hero beating the odds and surviving hardship, only to come up with the answer to solve the zombie problem. It was a lot of people, making gut instinct decisions based on limited information and doing the best they could at that moment in time. It showed personal struggle, sacrifice and determination. This movie showed none of those things.

This was a decent story, but naming it after a book it didn't follow in any way was a mistake.",1472342400,8,1007,4.558011049723757

5814126,1,B00DHRLK84,"This is a really boring zombie movie. The problems start with trying to adapt a book that didn't really lend itself to being made into a film. The book is like a history after the fact of a worldwide zombie work. The film is basically about Brad Pitt's character. Pitt is some sort of UN doctor or official or something. Brad Pitt runs around, He frets about his family. He talks about the UN. zombies attack. repeat.

The film starts out with the usual zombie outbreak scene. Then they go to Korea for no particular reason which leads to a trip to Israel for no particular reason. They spend lots of time running around only to conclude that they can't know anything about the origins or cause of the zombie outbreak. Then, out of left field, Brad Pitt has a ""Eureka"" moment which makes no medical or scientific sense but that solves everything. Or at least everything until the sequel.

About every three minutes, Brad has to fret about his family. It gets really annoying really quickly. The ""twist"" on the zombie thing in this film is that the zombies are really fast. But its still the same old zombie stuff.

The plot is really thin and Brad Pitt is literally the only character that matters. If you want two hours of expensive zombie special effects, this is your film. But if your looking for anything else, there is nothing to be had.

The typical Resident Evil film had more plot and character development than this film.",1467331200,,1431,4.556420233463035

5814128,1,B00DHRLK84,"If there were negative stars, this movie would get them -- all five of them.  It is a fungus on the already putrified body of what passes for film in Hollywood. The  plot consists solely of  walking dead people biting hunks of flesh out of living people,  and then the living people turn the walking dead into bloody carcasses, presumably more dead than they were before.

The hero Brad Pitt thinks of a way to outwit the undead by making the healthy so sick that the undead won't eat them. What a perfect Hollywood-style solution....more sickness.

That's all there  is to the plot...and it gets four stars from thousands of viewers?  As a species we're doooooomed.

The most satisfying scene is one in which  thousands of zombies climb and leap over Israel's high protective wall to stream with much gnashing of teeth the Wailing Wall.  They chase a young female Israeli soldier  who is bitten; Brad Pitt saves her from the effects of the zombie-bite by chopping off her arm above the bite zone. Is this an allegory of some sort about Israel's fate?  If so, well, so mote it be as long as it takes with it the actors, the writers, the directors, and the producers of this film.

We are shown stirring examples of how the meek and uninitiated perish while the alert get to survive. In some ways and on certain level, WWZ was more effective in conveying the dangers of life in our time into our heads than movies about terrorist attacks. There were well conceived dialogs and fantastical special effects throughout the movie. My only gripe about the movie is with Brad Pitt, whose performance was unremarkable and rather dull. Almost every other character at any point of the movie communicated more emotion and realism than Pitt. Gone are the days when this actor could give performances as convincing as the young, inexperienced and victimized detective in SEVEN, or a remorseful vampire in contrast to the Tom Cruise character in Interview With The Vampire. Some actors give more arousing and intense performance as their success and age grow, like Al Pacino and Charlize Theron, some are rendered stoic and trapped in their own skin and could play nothing but themselves, Tom Cruise and John Travolta less so as even though they are aware of their good looks, they don't shy away from delivering emotionally charged performances, while even dying has to look good for Pitt in Fury.",1464652800,,1332,4.950892857142857

It's the one about god knowing who's bad and good and putting together a kind of holiday hitlist for the bad ones.  that poor little kid (it's actually kind of funny in a saturday night live way.  i guess he had concluded that he was or had at one time been bad and the whole class, like the chorus in a greek tragedy is singing ""you better watch out, you'd better look out!""  it's no wonder the poor boy didn't go gouge his eyes out like oedopus.  anyway, my student had an ""ah-ha moment"" despite all of the psychological trauma.  it wasn't a complete victory over ignorance and evil.  he thinks evolution was used to ""create"" the universe.  so, he still believes in god and jesus. ironically, though, this student said he didn't believe in zombies.  it turns out that jesus wasn't a zombie after all!  [however, he's not a ghost, either -at least according to this kid.])

who'd've thought a monster movie'd have such wide curricular value.

incidentally, i used the online rental service on AMZN, b/c i needed it now (then).  the district internet doesn't feature netflix, otherwise i'd've used that -to avoid paying the fee (seemed somewhat high to rent a video for 48 hours.).  maybe i'll subscribe to prime when school resumes in the fall.

that is all.

While still be entertaining, heart pumping, clever, scary, and action packed.  I wasn't bored at all.  The only thing I can see people complain about is character development was on the weak side and it doesn't follow the book.  I for one don't care about it being similar to the book just as long as it is good.  They can always do a tv series later.  Hopefully the character development is fixed in the WWZ2.  Acting, cgi, environments, props, and music was of course on point.

Zombies are fast and strong.
They respond to both sound and sight.
Obviously need head shots but other things can injure them or slow them down like shooting them in the knees.  Burning works too.
Depending where the bite is, cutting off a limb will save you.
Getting their blood in orifices doesn't turn you.
If you have a disease they won't go after you.
Their not smart, but will pile up together to get where they need to go.

I thought it was great! So did my daughter and pretty much everyone else I know who saw it.  I read a lot of ""that would never happen"" in the pre-release criticisms, but I didn't see anything at all in the movie that I thought was totally out of the realm of possibility.  Some stretching of possibilities, maybe, but nothing outrageous.  And, really, it's a ZOMBIE movie - doesn't the whole premise of EVERY zombie movie require viewers to pretty much suspend disbelief as soon as the lights go down in the theater?  And I do not believe for one second that there is any such thing as a ""reasonable"" expectation of what would really happen in the world if such a plague occurred, so how can I be terribly critical of what any writer/director does in any zombie film?  If zombies are possible, so is every potential scenario we've all seen and/or read about.  I thought World War Z was fairly gritty and certainly an enjoyable ride.  Brad Pitt was perhaps a bit more mellow than I would expect a person in his position to be, but if he'd been a screaming hysteric, the military would never have been interested in sending him out to hunt down the origin of the plague.

And it absolutely does not waste time on getting into the action. There are a few moments of detectable CGI, which always bug me, but they pass quickly. And frankly the movie raises enough existential questions that one doesn't really have time to think about the film maker's choices in terms of practical effects vs. CGI. For example, (spoiler alert) what if you had to justify your spot on the life boat? Next, how does one compare the value of field expertise vs. subject matter expertise? Then, how are we employing the ""Tenth Man"" concept (personally and as a government) to assure we are planning for the improbable? These are just a few.

5814264,4,B00DHRLK84,"World War Z, the movie, has greatly surpassed my expectations in comparison to other zombie films and television shows. I enjoyed the movie so much that I had to pick it up after seeing it in the movie theater. As a casual movie watcher, this is a good watch. For someone who enjoys zombie shows and movies as much as the next person, World War Z kept me on the edge of my seat with its unique plotline and detailed visual effects. Without any previous knowledge of what it is about, the movie is very easy to follow and appeals to all of-age audiences that can appreciate more than the violence and action that comes with your typical zombie-killing movie.

To sum things up shortly, Brad Pitt and his counterparts are part of the few people that haven't been infected with this virus that is essentially turning people into zombies. The movie follows Brad Pitt and his journey to find the source of the infection and to stop this epidemic and to save the world all together.

The first thing that made this movie stand out was the unique plot and structure of the movie. In a typical zombie movie, you can expect the main characters to continually fight through waves of zombies as the movie moves along. World War Z is different. The movie primarily focuses on the path to finding a cure along with all the expected gore and action that you can expect in any zombie movie. The plot helps create a very surreal aspect to the movie. So surreal that something like this could potentially happen in real life.

Another aspect that sets World War Z apart from other zombie movies are the graphics and visual effects. The actors that play the zombies are refined with such detail and are so unique, they seem real. Its hard to create that sense of realness when dealing with zombies but World War Z does a great job accomplishing this. For example, there is one scene were there are a mass amount of zombies climbing over a huge barrier that is done with such technicality that helps create a unique visual appeal to movie watchers of all sorts.

Overall, I was very pleased with my purchase of the movie, World War Z. If you aren't into action-packed films or a fan of Brad Pitt, maybe World War Z isn't for you. But past all the zombie killing and violence, the movie is very well thought out. If you are looking for a good movie to watch, World War Z is always a good choice.",1455235200,10,2375,4.4528735632183905

The serial, newpaper clipping style of writing works well in book form, but makes for a narrative nightmare in movies; you don't know who to root for because you're constantly learning who this new character is. It's distracting. The producers of this film did a good job of capturing the essence of what the point of the Brooks work was about: a less than grim, not quite tongue in cheek fun glimpse at the end of the world, a la zombies. The story doesn't make sense, things happen to Brad Pitt that aren't plausible, but since you're watching a film about ten thousand zombies piling over one another to breach the 100ft wall of Jerusalem constructed on an email hunch, you might be missing the point by focusing on the one fake tree in a forest of real ones.

Brad Pitt and zombies!
The action you'll probably enjoy if the movie you see!

I have the PG-13 version on DVD. Let alone if Brad's character was killed, I thought I'd hear the shrieks and screams of females everywhere if his face was even scratched! After some necessary set-up, the movie is fast-paced, the action virtually non-stop. At times it was even riveting. Unlike other zombie movies and even zombie television shows, the violence was not grotesque. They've long ago figured out in Hollywood how to keep certain movies a PG-13 and not an R so the potential audience is considerably larger. It consists of not focusing close-up on the blood or only showing the blood in quick close-ups with quick cutaways.

5814340,5,B00DHRLK84,"A fresh take on, let's face it, a genre that's becoming watered down and tired.  The idea of the zombies not intent on the classic motivation of consuming human flesh but as harbingers of Mother Nature's plan to thin out the population is refreshingly brilliant.  The zombies are focused only on spreading the sickness which somehow makes the underlying theme here more terrifying even without the eye-popping zombie killing effects of the Walking Dead. The enemy here is fast and sinister in it's flock-like desire to get to the uninfected, and their movements are squirm-worthy compared to the shuffling and moaning to which we've already become complacent.  Purists loyal to the Brooks novel (interestingly enough, written by Mel Brook's son) will possibly be bent by the minimal adherence to the original story arc, but will have to give props to the compelling storyline presented here.

5814581,4,B00DHRLK84,"World War Z is a film that tries to take a real world approach to a Zombie Apocalypse scenario.  I enjoyed the movie and was surprised to see so many negative reviews.  I did not think it was as entertaining as the newer Dawn of the Dead movie but still found it definitely worth watching.  Several of the scenes in the movie seem realistic and probably would occur if that type of plague happened.

Some other films come to mind that show how the spread of a worldwide epidemic can occur.  Like at the end of Rise of Planet of the Apes where the airlines spread the disease all over the world is one that stood out right away to me.  World War Z is not your typical mindless zombie romp film.  I thought some scenes were great.  For instance when Brad Pitt shoots someone at a super market who is trying to assault his wife and the cop nearby totally ignores him because he is looking out for himself and has no interest in enforcing the law when personal survival is at stake.  Its a powerful scene and the movie is full of moments like that.

 The movie is slow paced don't expect constant action like a Resident Evil movie.  I actually prefer a movie like this which concentrates on how to solve the epidemic rather than just trying to survive such as the Night of the Living Dead trilogy.  I do see a couple of flaws with the super zombie theory.  I am surprised no one mentioned the wait it out theory like in the film 28 Days Later with the human body unable to supplement energy without food acting as fuel wouldnt the zombies die of malnutrition/starvation and keel over after a few weeks.  Like at the end of 28 days later.  Also if Israel was so smart wouldnt they recognize the effect of sound that stimulates the zombies, watching those people cheering and singing riling up the zombies you would have thought the guards would have been monitoring them and telling them to knock it off and stop singing.  I have a hard time seeing people celebrating like that so close to danger on the other side of the wall.  It goes beyond stupid but hey its a movie.

 The film definitely gives you a feeling of the zombie epidemic on a global scale, where you would not be safe anywhere, but on a deserted island or ocean ship in this case.  I thought the passenger airplane scene was a little farfetched but other than that I enjoyed the movie especially the England CDC lab scenes.  Like Fight Club I think this is one of Brad Pitts better movies.  I found this much better than 12 Monkeys I hated that film.  World War Z has a nice mix of action and realism.  I enjoyed the extermination scenes at the end the film probably could have used more time on that montage sequence.  I also was thinking the farmers and people in rural U.S. probably survived much better than those in the cities.  Its not perfect but I found it entertaining and would rate it 4 stars.",1447113600,,2865,4.356603773584905

People like to write BP off as a ""pretty face,"" but the fact remains that he is a good actor.  This is one of the more ""intellectual""/deliberately scientific approaches to the phenomenon, a focus which culminates in Brad Pitt's character discovering (via a frantic around the world trip, much of it unplanned) an ingenious plan for fighting the Zombie virus.

This isn't your standard slow moving zombie movie. They haul some serious ass, lion hunting a gazelle type zombies with zero regard for one another or anything for that matter.

5814865,2,B00DHRLK84,"This movie is just. So. Boring. I don't know how it's so bland and tensionless. It just is. Maybe it's because Brad Pitt and his family never really seem to be in danger. Maybe it's that even in this unrated cut there's hardly any blood in this apocalypse. Maybe it's that these zombies are so unbelievable as CGI howler monkeys. Maybe it's a combination of all of these things. I love good a zombie movie, I love a good disaster flick, I love a good apocalypse on film.

5814874,2,B00DHRLK84,"A very mediocre film that should've been a very powerful and memorable movie about zombies (based on the book of the same name, by author Max Brooks).  Many people will recognize the name Robert Kirkman because of The Walking Dead's popularity, but Max Brooks deserves as much credit for resurrecting (pun intended) the zombie post apocalyptic genre with his books: The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z.

To be clear, the book WWZ is superior (but most book mediums are anyways) and deals with slow-moving, classic zombies; not the 28 Days/Weeks Later zombies on crack that we see in this movie with Brad Pitt.  Not only were the zombies just way to fast (rabies & steroids), but it would cause the world to be entirely infected in a mater of a day or so, as opposed to the breakdown shown in say, The Walking Dead or other zombie universes.

What the movie did get right, was the govt. survival; what it didn't get right is pretty much everything else; the zombies were like CG ants and completely different from the book, the PG-13 rating made for some non-gory zombie violence (which kind of goes against the genre in itself, and thankfully TWD tv show isn't a family friendly version of the comic), the characters were forgettable, the story not told from a narrative in the aftermath (like the book), and the suspension of disbelief great when grenades go off in airplanes and yet the main characters survive the crash landing.

This is a prime example of a movie suffering too much creative control and divergence from the source material, as another studio decision to make a PG-13 action film to make more money/get more viewers instead of an R-rated horror film truly depicting a zombie apocalypse.",1444608000,4,1712,4.750841750841751

Although there are close-quarter interactions with the zombies, this predominately takes a literal 30,000 foot perspective of ""managing"" a world-wide zombie apocalypse. This movie made me reflect and ruminate long after the credits.

The concept is amazing, but the plot and fluidity of the movie suffered from adapting a novel to big screen. The movie's unique vision outweighs the detractors.",1444608000,,483,5.527027027027027

We prefer the uncut version, which has about 8 added minutes of zombie mayhem and blood/gore, more of your typical zombie fare, rather than the theatrical version which is more a character study than a horror film.

As others have noted, the Zombies here have interesting capacities, and the action at times, even for a middle aged man, can send some shivers through you.

They moved very quickly at times and didn't appear to be terribly hungry for living flesh. If you're one of those people who avoid ""zombie"" shows because of the gore, you should watch this.  There's not a lot of gore and the ""zombies"" don't lose body parts when they move. As with many zombie movies, some of the non-zombies are pretty despicable.

I won't ruin the movie for you, but I thought the remedy to the ""zombie"" situation was interesting and unique.  Plus, even though Brad Pitt is having a hard time trying to save the world, he looks great (as usual).  In addition, some professional critics opined that the depiction of Israel was really a commentary on the political situation in the Middle East.  Who knows?  Who cares?  With zombies, you don't want to dig too deep because you'll uncover a number of ""wait a second, that makes no sense"" moments.  Just accept that it's only a movie and enjoy.  I did!!  Is there going to be a sequel?  Hope so!",1441152000,,1066,4.582010582010582

I liked the way it starts, a typical family getting ready for the day. Eating breakfast, getting two girls ready for school, playing a game in traffic--when all hell breaks loose!
Other characters he meets along the way trying to find out how to fix the world are well thought out and the clues he finds fairly easy to put together. My other favorite character is Segen, the Israeli soldier. She sees what she needs to do and does it.
I'm not saying this is a movie for the ages, it probably isn't, but I like it over all. It's zombies are not the slow moving ones of The Walking Dead. You have to move faster. Once they are introduced the action doesn't stop. Love it and as I said, Brad Pitt.",1439251200,,878,4.263473053892215

Are we to believe he was the only person on earth with those credentials? Then, the mission was to discover the point of origin of the oiutbreak, but about half-way through the movie that line is abandoned, and it just gets more and more silly after that.

Still not a bad flick, but it's hard to even give it 3 stars.

Do you love movies with excessive camera shake in action scenes?

Do you love it when they use cheap stock sound effects in movies?

Do you love it when the characters do completely irrational nonsensical things?

Do you love sappy boring family\love stories in your apocalypse flicks?

Yeah, there is a lot of movie sins in this one, it's one of those films you just have to turn off your critical side, eat pop corn, drink soda, and lower your IQ so you can just have a good time. I tried hard to, but it was just over the top stupid when the hero finally reached the W.H.O. was healed by them, then tries to play tough guy and not want to talk with them? HUH!? Who wrote this stinker?

If we've learned anything from zombie films, it's that the military must use nerf guns, can't aim, don't have many bombs, have very few if any tanks, don't have huge supplies and plenty of ammo to kill billions of people 20 times over, and that writers who write this stuff badly underestimate the armed forces. I've also learned that Brad Pitt isn't the best fit for movies like this.

I'm one of those people that ""read the book"" so when I heard they were making a movie from it, I was very hopeful for the result.  The book seems to lend itself well towards a visual presentation.  There's a combination of zombie ""action"", plus, contemplative themes.  Sadly, this movie is only one half of that equation.  So the parts that are action oriented aren't terrible and those parts are watchable.  But this is not even close to the story that anyone who read the book would find familiar.

If you want an action movie, sure, enjoy it.  I was disappointed that the 'solution'  essentially had no consequence or effort.  It's sad that this movie is missing all the themes of deception, sacrifice and perseverance (as well as the brief moments of humour) that made the book so outstanding.",1437868800,,876,4.62987012987013

5815651,2,B00DHRLK84,"This would have been an intriguing film had the pandemic Z virus caused the infected humans to seek out others to infect rather than making them all zombies. Instead of a real thriller, this film becomes a tired-out Dawn of the Dead full-length-feature-flick with a few interesting twists. There were HUGE holes in the plot as well. So how long would it have taken for hospitals throughout the world to figure out that the zombies would only attack healthy humans?  Even the gravitas of Brad Pitt couldn't keep this from being a campy comedy, destined to be a cult film for the zombie-impaired. The only star in this two star film is the female Israeli soldier who loses her arm to one of the creepy-crab-walking-zombie-crawlers. Her performance alone (and I mean alone) is worth the price of admission as long as you don't pay full price.",1437696000,,839,4.7465753424657535

The pace is heart pounding and it's propelled by how the protagonist, Brad Pitt's character, must deal with an infectious outbreak of a highly communicable virus that is changing humankind into mindless zombies.  To be sure, this genre has been overworked numerous times before, but what distinguishes this film from the majority of others is that it derives its suspense not from copious amounts of vividly shown gore, but quite the opposite, it deals more in inferred violence (though there are some violent scenes too.....full disclosure).  Once you start viewing this apocalyptic nightmare thriller, you won't be able to stop.  You'll be drawn into a thrill ride that won't disappoint.",1436313600,,840,5.014388489208633

Not perfect because it doesn't make any sense how the zombies can remain animated without eating flesh or brains for long periods of time.  It doesn't even seem like that is what they are after, they just want to spread the disease and not really eat anyone.  I knew Brad Pitt wasn't going to die, but I had the highest hopes for that Israeli girl even after having her arm chopped off.  The queue for takeoff from Jerusalem is a remarkable scene I won't soon forget and holds that unique production value you look for that sets each film apart.  A part of you dies a little with the Navy Seal who gives his life to unhook the fuel hose so they can take off from Humphreys.  Elen Rhys makes a star turn as the flight attendant who looked a little too put together considering the circumstances (Who is the blonde on Belarus Air?)  Playback and video quality was smooth.

5815924,2,B00DHRLK84,"The 2 daughters and wife are worthless  All were weak and contributed nothing to surviving.  One daughter had asthma when the human gene pool needs the best -not the worst.  Their contribution to the movie was screaming and one of the older daughters wanting her blanket which had me rooting for the zombies to get her immediately.  There are millions of humans who deserved to live - rather than these 3.  Too bad their characters were not more well developed.  I was rooting for all 3 to die in the first 15 minutes of the movie.  The boy in the movie was great.  He was a survivor - strong, healthy, smart and brave....everything the 2 girls and the wife were not.

The husband's character was fine.  He is just not that great an actor.  If his first family had died and he found a strong woman with strong children who were actively fighting and surviving and he joined in with them or had children with her later after they find a  safe zone,.I would give this movie 5 stars.",1435968000,,980,4.41340782122905

I give it a three because I like the genre and loved the book, the movie is visually interesting at times, and has some cool shots but... the dialogue is often unintelligible, the scenes at times are so dark or so rushed you can't see what's going on, and some of the points being made visually are lost because there is no explanation, background, or even time to absorb the information.  This movie was quite obviously rushed so the production company could ride the wave of zombiephilia currently sweeping the nation, which is a shame because this could have been an awesome movie had the screen adaptation been more carefully crafted.",1435104000,,825,4.5675675675675675

Unfortunately Brad is in his SUV, happy family in tow, and already surrounded by screeching zombies, when he gets word of his new mission so naturally saving them is his first priority. Battling his way out of town, Pitt's portrayal of the sincere family man cloaking a super smart hero emerges well supported by all the cast. Once Pitt thinks his family is secure he's off on a worldwide disaster trek made all the more real by flawless effects to find a cure. Teamed as a facilitator with a whiz kid Doctor, tension mounts early on when the young doctor dies. It doesn't let up as Brad heroically carries on discovering that in this experiment he's the guinea pig.",1433721600,,886,4.613924050632911

5816181,1,B00DHRLK84,"I would give 0 stars if I could. This movie is a testament to the fact that a high budget and A-List actors can still easily produce a terrible movie. The plot was painful. Worse than that, it was amazingly boring. I watched this movie free on amazon prime without any real expectations and I still feel ripped off. I cant imagine how much I would have hated it if I had actually paid. Almost any low budget zombie movie is better than World War Z. It felt like a group of the worst Hollywood hacks scribbled the script on cocktail napkins while the film was being shot. I found this surprising, given that it was supposed to be loosely based on a book. The only zombie related movie as bad as World War Z is probably 3 Days Dead (from the SyFy channels town of the living dead series). As tragically bad as 3 Days Dead was, the only thing that put it in the same category as World War Z was that 3 Days Dead had inaudible sound (sound quality I would consider unusable for even an amateur YouTube video.  In World War Z you can hear what they are saying but you just don't care. The Z in World War Z does not stand for Zombie.

I could lay into everything they did wrong and my thoughts of the D-bags that made this thing, but I'm sure it's already been said a million times by now.

The fall of Jerusalem is incredible.  This movie is better than Zombieland.  I liked it almost as much as Shawn of the Dead, which of course is a comedy and entirely different.

As I understand it, HD suggests it should fill the screen (no horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of the screen).  This movie did not fill the screen on my 48"" Sony Bravia (purchased on Amazon).  Yes, my streaming and internet performance works fine (I bounced back and forth between other movies and TV offerings and got the HD experience).  In Amazon's defense, this same movie also did not appear in HD on Netflix, and the same happened with The Wolf of Wall Street, but at least I didn't have to pay an additional rental fee (World War Z was free on Amazon).  I'll probably watch the free Amazon movies but renting one in HD to only get the SD experience is not worth the money.

You see the effects of the outbreak on a global scale, which is refreshing, but Pitt's character jets-setting across the globe always have a way to cheat death eventually gets old. He is less human and more superhero surviving intense plane crashes, countless zombie attacks that kill nearly everyone around him and even rare and exotic diseases. Nonetheless, it is a fun ride the first time through and isn't overly gory. Very unique sound effects add a lot to this thriller. Looking forward to the sequel.",1431820800,,647,4.837837837837838

5816382,5,B00DHRLK84,"I prefer the Unrated version, but the regular version is choppy/faster pace, so you may want to watch that one first. This movie is something Hollywood got right. You know, the 'crazy' premise that turns out to be true. If you want to know why, there's plenty of info out there. This family survives, because they're well connected in the UN/government. Trying to make a survival movie about an ordinary family in the U.S. would last about 15 minutes (with the credits). There are the typical horror film moments, where the humans get killed out of obvious stupidity, so that's a bit annoying, but I wouldn't list this as a horror film. When you watch the movie, look past the 'zombies'. Watch it for the message and work of art that it is. There are quite a few useful messages in here, actually.

A tide of slowly moving, easily avoided, mindless dead bodies is moving very, very, very slowly towards me.  Whatever shall I do?""
Anyways, this movie takes the idea and makes it so ridiculous, it lowers an already overdone genre to the point of borderline criminality.  Seriously, we the unfortunate victims of this film should be able to sue the studio that produced this idiotic waste of to two hours of our lives for punitive damages.  Really, rabid humans running at superhuman speeds, mindlessly infecting other humans for reasons unexplained in the film, and ignoring the terminally ill, thus isolating pockets of survivors who can only be saved by Brad Pitt, investigator for the UN.  That's it.  Nothing else happens.  They don't even resolve the issue at the end of the film.  Nobody knows where it came from, nobody finds a cure.  Just some half baked, lame, pseudo camouflage that jeopardizes lives of the remaining human survivors.  Pitt finds this out only after embarking on a quest that takes him all over the planet.  The zombies, using what little rational thought they had left, must have taken the time to cut all the phone lines to EVERY HOSPITAL ON THE PLANET, before they went on their body binge.  Don't even get me started on the fall of Jerusalem in the film, so much for peace in the Middle East.",1431648000,,1525,4.7272727272727275

I saw other reviews that said this type of story had been over-done, but if you tend to watch every movie you get your hands on of a particular genre, of course you're going to see overlapping stories.

Brad Pitt plays the role of devoted family man and former UN investigator who is brilliantly gifted with insight and who is able to draw the right conclusions about a worldwide pandemic. I am not a fan of zombie movies and have resisted the urge to jump on the 'Z bandwagon'. After this movie, I'm still not a fan but greatly appreciate the film on its storytelling merits, fast-paced but credible actions (or as credible as you can get with plot lines involving the undead), and thought-provoking premises i.e., the Tenth Man Rule that could be used as a lesson for us all in critical thinking.

5816683,4,B00DHRLK84,"This is a film that those who find the 'The Walking Dead' (TWD) a bit over the top with blood, gore, and horror... BUT... still enjoy the Zombie genre, can easily watch without any concern of being bombarded with visions of blood, gore, and horror that they would rather not see. I'm an avid fan of 'The Walking Dead' though in saying that, I enjoyed this film more (because of the very lack of the aforementioned blood, gore, and horror); I would love to see a sequel come out of this movie (WWZ) as the finish, whilst good of its own standing, also leaves open to see how the world may eventually fight back to regain humanities hold on the earth. Great story line, excellent acting by all involved, and any CGI was smoothly shot ensuring it very difficult indeed to see where it had been used (and not over-used too as with other movies of this ilk). This is certainly a keeper in my movie collection and one, I think, of Brad Pitts best works. The worst of it... (possible spoiler) the ludicrous view of a 4x engine transport plane being launched of an aircraft carrier (without any aid of a catapult launch too) and flying intercontinental without any inflight refuelling!",1429401600,,1177,4.556603773584905

The plot had just enough unique elements to keep me from saying the lines before they came; while satisfying with the expected motifs. Brad Pitt carried his role well, not quite the action hero, not quite the politically-correct apologist.  Nice to see a man who wants to take care of his family, for a change.  The CGI was kept on a leash, and really worked where it was used.  This variation on the zombie apocalypse had a restrained gritty feel.

The shots of the zombies were rushed and confused so many times that it could be hard to keep up with what was happening. It was a super clever solution in the end(no spoilers! Ha!)which I liked. But again, it was if they set up what the characters were working towards and then suddenly yanked that away and dumped the 'real' solution and ran away. Also, the side story about the family left behind was boring because they weren't doing anything, but kept getting screentime because we were supposed to really care.

Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane who formerly worked for the United Nations as an investigator. Now he is fighting a war on zombies. This movie has some good special effects and a pretty decent plot. The makeup artists and costume designers did a nice job with the zombies.

One part I disliked was when Brad Pitt is armed with a tire iron on his way to enter a wing of the WHO lab where the infectious diseases are kept. He puts the tire iron down and enters the lab leaving the tire iron outside. Really? There are possibly zombies outside and you convenientally forget your only form of protection? Not very believable. No way am I forgetting to bring that tire iron inside with me. Other than that, I really liked this movie.

Tired storyline of the retired highly trained special-ops soldier who is also the most decent man you've ever met. He just wants to spend time with his family and make pancakes for his little girl but he's compelled to go back into service one more time - the government makes him an offer he can't refuse. The world is crumbling but all the necessary services still work? He's able to travel the world to find a solution to the central problem (starts with ""z"") and when he's blocked from transportation or access, he calls his government contact who has influence around the globe. Fortunately his cell phone works whenever he needs it -- except when he's talking to his wife, suddenly the connection is garbled. Brad looks good.",1428364800,,996,4.763005780346821

5816858,1,B00DHRLK84,"This is a ridiculous movie. I love good zombie films, but this one fails terribly. It does have a few good ideas/moments, however.

The good: 1) these zombies are presented as extremely fast-moving and strong -- not the typical slow-moving, weak creatures that we see in The Walking Dead. So, it's a different concept. 2) The zombies are so powerful and motivated that they form mountains of dead human flesh to surmount 50 ft walls and high-rise buildings. These are some powerful zombies, and we've never seen zombies depicted in this way before.
The bad: 1) the machine-gun style editing and shaky-cam just makes the film confusing and difficult to follow. This does not build up terror in the viewer -- just annoyance. 2) I can suspend belief and accept the existence of zombies. I cannot suspend belief to accept the stupid and vapid actions of the characters and their dialog. The entire human side of the story is silly and not at all believable. Brad Pitt on his own discovers the ""cure""?  Brad Pitt and his companion are the only ones to survive the plane crash? The plane does not explode, and no fire? Brad Pitt finds his way to the research center, on foot, without a map, through the countryside that is rife with zombies, while he is severely injured?  Brad Pitt has surgery (presumably) to remove the ragged piece of metal impaled in him (all the way through him), and after 3 days is running jauntily through the research center fighting zombies? Brad Pitt injects a random killer virus into himself, and experiences no ill-effects, and it happens to be absolutely the perfect injection choice?  He injects this virus by plunging the needle violently into his arm, through his shirtsleeve? This is only the tip of the iceberg of stupid stuff that goes on. If the audience is asked to give a big concession by allowing belief in crazy-strong zombies, then the film maker must make the rest of the film's action believable -- at least slightly believable. But not in this film.
The only real suspense in this film is the attempt to avoid the zombies and get to the storage room in the research facility. The fast-cut editing of the rest of the film is generally not present in this portion.",1427932800,,2204,4.7020725388601035

For the most part it starts out as a nice day with family life just being so fine then goes into a destructive deadly change that seems to have no escape with many unbelievable situations such as a completely stopped traffic jam that suddenly they are the only ones who can drive through the middle of all the cars at high speed.

5817055,2,B00DHRLK84,"If you want non-stop, fast-paced action, then become a zombie, leave your brains on your bedside table and look no further than World War Z.  Yes, there is action.  Yes, there is carnage.  Yes, there is Brad Pitt with his ""do I really have to do this?"" look he does so well.  But, there is no real explanation for what is happening--indeed, I felt like one of the children in that I was given no prior information but was expected to accept that everyone knows what's going on as normal.  When the movie was all said and done, I was not certain as to whether it was intended as an indictment of the UN and WHO or as a piece supporting everything they stand for.  The ""solution"" really had no basis in reality, science or logic, but then, the whole premise had no basis in any of these, either.  Sooooo, leave your brains at the door and enjoy the movie already!  The action is extremely fast-paced.  It is almost impossible to keep your breath during the action and it is definitely impossible to see everything that is going on.  Many times, things happen so fast that you will never see all the action.  There is no real acting going on, it is as if the actors are just walking through the camera shot (or in this case running with their hands flailing in the air) to get something on tape.  The real outstanding part of this movie is the broad shots of the mobs of people, but those are computer-generated.  So, since there is a convoluted plot, an implausible situation and solution, little (if any) acting, and (technically) a one-man show, I take points away.  If you loved Brad in Moneyball and the Ocean's movies, watch them again and you will not feel like you would have wasted your two hours.",1426291200,,1703,4.434083601286174

5817203,1,B00DHRLK84,"Psychic white jesus magically knows everything in terrible script attempting to redeem itself by stealing the name of an actually good story. Nothing makes sense plot wise. Has one interesting concept in the way the undead move as a swarming colony organism, except for the idiotic conceit that the virus would somehow be capable of distinguishing between healthy humans and terminally ill humans and would bother to avoid attacking them. A virus that kills its host anyways would for some reason avoid killing already dying potential hosts? there is no valid reason it would work this way.

also props to the lady that played the Israeli soldier, even though she doesn't get to to do anything interesting because she isn't Brad Pitt.

Recommendation: read the book! Max Brooks (son of Carl Brooks) is a really good story teller and I hope he gets the rights back to his title someday.",1425254400,,885,4.8933333333333335

This movie has better zombies, and they mean it when they say they're going to eat your brains. They are not as determined and fearsome as the Nazi zombies in Dead Snow. That's true, and this film does not have a zombie leader with a criminally funny mouth. But that's OK. You take zombies for what they are, and you blow their heads off with your double barrel sawed off shotgun.

5817214,4,B00DHRLK84,Overall good movie however it seems this movie is pushing the Israeli agenda most likely I'm guess is because they funded the movie.  A little desperate at times with a blue handkerchief and blue undershirt.  What's more unbelievable is not the Zombies but Israel letting people in during a Zombie invasion however keeping people out during 'normal' haydays lol.  I would believe it more if they were the ones to create the virus so the only 'beings' alive would be Israelis in the world.  My take.

The story line (such as there is) is disjointed and borders on the nonsensical. There are a few high points - Pitt's rescue of an injured Israeli soldier and the last scene in a WHO laboratory, plus the overall cinematography) - but the poor script, plot, editing and acting weigh down these few high points.

Beyond the zombies, this movie is pretty weak. If the zombies were not as fast and ferocious, somewhat like the ""28 Days Later"" ragers, then the movie would be really boring. Also, Mirielle Enos kind of worked my last nerves in this movie. She is a better actress than this movie shows. Her character was just really weak to me.

5817455,5,B00DHRLK84,I am very pleased with this purchase. Loved the action packed different take on zombies. They move like lightening. The suspense and action are there and don't let up from the first 10 minutes on to the end. The sound quality is fantastic and the music just adds to the urgent feeling without taking over and throwing you out of the movie. Not for kids. Loads of gore but no sly humor or sex. Just a sincere feeling of affection among the family. There was some feeling of dejavue to the War of the Worlds in the resolution but only in the broadest sense. I will say that Brad Pitt was thoroughly believable as a resourceful though reluctant hero who is out to save his family and by extension the world. There were so many good characterizations by actors I didn't know that I hate to pass over them. I  recommend you see for yourself.

So having read Max Brooks' book I was already set to hate the movie because even when it was just a script treatment it was already so different. However, if I ignore the fact that it basically only shares a title with the book, I can honestly say I mostly enjoyed this. I'm not a huge Brad Pitt fan, I found his reactions kind of numb. I mean, I'd have been showing a lot more fear running away from zombies in Jerusalem, his stone face was a problem I had throughout the movie. But even with that I really did get into it. Even the Pepsi product placement was enjoyed, because they made it serve a purpose. I especially liked... Well, I'm not going to say it bluntly. But the WHO thing, it was very creative. I don't think I've seen it before in anything zombie. So if you're avoiding them movie like I was because its not like the book, give it a try, it's way better than you're thinking.

Pitt doesn't do his best performance here but the zombies was all I cared about. Seeing them ravage an entire city from New York to Jerusalem is visually stunning. The story keeps you pumped up pretty much throughout and the action can get pretty tense. A standard for any zombie movie.

Being a big Hollywood blockbuster the CGI is, of course, excellent and the set-piece action sequences are superb, edge of the seat affairs but overall the plot is unfortunately linear and feeble with some very daft geography; our Brad flies from an aircraft carrier (incidentally, in a plane that looks far to big to take off from a carrier  but then what do I know) off the coast of Pennsylvania all the way to South Korea for some nonsense and refuelling and then from there to Jerusalem  that looks like two very long journeys with only one refuelling to me but then It is also very much a one man film; the supporting cast are entirely inconsequential and disposable making for a somewhat shallow movie but the action and some excellent jump moments maintain the pace and there is never a dull moment.

It is naturally all very silly but that hardly matters; it is nothing more than a big budget action zombie movie and that is exactly what you get. Never mind the plot; just look at those zombies go!",1421539200,,1264,4.5550660792951545

5817517,4,B00DHRLK84,Good movie,1420848000,,10,4.5
5817518,1,B00DHRLK84,"The plot couldn't have sucked more.  A beyond random opening, and the family's acting was pretty horrible.  Never have I cared less about a man's wife and children, who were all completely and utterly helpless and useless throughout the entire film.  Brad Pitt was trying his hardest to act well, but compared to the tone of the film, it didn't mix.

SPOILER ALERTS FROM THIS POINT ON, although it doesn't matter because the plot blows anyways.

Then there are the multiple dumb as all living hell plot points.  First, Brad Pitt makes it to some military base and gets to put his family on a ship to stay off the mainland, but there's only so much room, and CUE COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE DRIVING FORCE, they'll throw his wife and kids off the ship (back on land, not in the ocean) if he doesn't escort this snarky egotistical 20 something scientist to the location of patient zero or whatnot.  Whatever, at least he has a reason to go.  However, as soon as they get there, the scientist slips on the ramp down to the runway, hits his head, and dies.

My god.  That's where the film starts to completely go downhill.  Every single time they need to inject tension, death, or terror (usually in the form of alerting the hoards), they introduce the stupidest plot points imaginable: Brad Pitts mobile phone rings during a stealth sequence because he forgot to set it to silent, getting half of the soldiers following him killed.  Way to go, ***hole.

When he finally gets to Israel for some poorly explained reason, it's revealed that, apparently, they had been anticipating it for months and started building a city encompassing wall to keep the zombies out.  Why they decided to keep they're knowledge of what's coming a secret is beyond me considering they immediately begin taking in any refuge who shows up at their doorstep, so it's not like they were only trying to save themselves.

That's not even the best part.  Someone starts singing in the square close to the refuge entrance using a megaphone and sound system.  The zombies outside hear it and they must decide they really hate her singing because, apparently for the first time since they built the wall, even though there are thousands upon thousands of zombies just outside of it, they start attempting to climb it.  They climb over each other and make a huge sloped wall of zombie bodies for the others to climb up and get inside the walls.  They succeed in overrunning the city after hearing sounds from inside for the first time even though there are thousands of vehicles driving up to the refuge tunnels and cars running just inside the walls, with the bustle of thousands of human beings no bothering to mute themselves.

In case you haven't been following along, every single catalyst of action sequences and tense moments was horrible and the result of a human beings stupidity (including the main character) or the writers' poor imagination.  Nothing makes sense.

Besides that, Brad Pitt figures out that Zombies have no interest in sick people and can apparently tell, with all of their quickly decaying, highly advanced sense, if a person is ill or sickly instantly and runs right past them as if they don't exist.  Brad Pitt ends up in this remote research facility after getting into a plane where a zombie inexplicably snuck into the bathroom in, even though staff was constantly watching over it on an empty runway where not a single zombie was allowed near without being put down.  In other words, the zombie got there by magic.  The zombie creates panic and the plane goes down, prompting Brad Pitt to wander out nearly unscathed to the aforementioned research facility.  There he explains that if they give everyone a non-fatal, curable disease they can walk around and the zombies won't do anything.  However, Brad Pitt has to go to the facility's storage room of diseases in order to do so, where he injects himself so the zombies will ignore him because he got trapped in the room upon arrival.  The movie tries to play it up as if he's making some sort of sacrifice, even though he could just inject himself with the thing he came to get that they planned on injecting everyone else with anyways.  So in the end everyone stabs themselves with needles and gets sick so they can walk right up to zombies and kill them, like they're out on a casual stroll and the zombies are just a nuisance.

In other words, this movie sucks.  All of the characters are forgettable, and the only one you end up caring about is the random female soldier who Brad Pitt helps cut off her hand when a zombie bites it to save her from turning.

Don't get me wrong, I liked all of the cg zombie sequences.  The zombies movements, speed, brutality, and horde mentality are the only redeeming qualities of this movie.  Other than that, I wouldn't give this movie a second thought because of how often I found myself wanting to strangle every human that appeared on screen out of frustration over their sheer stupidity.

I was slightly disappointed that the zombies in the movie were so different from the book version which are more like Walking Dead zombies, but I understand that these zombies added to the fast paced action and added intensity to the movie.

5817600,1,B00DHRLK84,"1 star is far too many, this needs 0 or less.  By letter grade Z is perfect.  If you don't know, and I didn't, the Z is apparently for Zombie.  Maybe some people like Zombie movies, I think they are absurd.  Further, the whole premise was some sort of disease that made people turn into Zombies.  There was one person, yes one, that was looking for a cure.  However he was killed off very early in the movie, and didn't seem to have much of a lab while on an aircraft carrier.  People also went from normal to Zombies seemingly in seconds.  It was apparently also very contagious, except of course for Brad Pitt.  He even got Zombie juice in his mouth yet never succumbed to the disease.  I won't give away the thin plot on how this ends, but it too is absurd, and of course entails yet more more Zombies. The whole movie is nothing but an excuse to show disgusting Zombies and people getting killed.  This is extremely poorly written, the acting is mediocre at best.  Essentially I wasted several hours of my life that I will never get back.  Save yourself from Zombies and skip this total loser.  Simply awful.",1420243200,,1112,4.387254901960785

The stories in the book are so solid and at times moving. It would make a great episodic on AMC.

5817698,5,B00DHRLK84,"World War Z (I haven't read the book) is far more than a vehicle for superstar Brad Pitt. It's, instead, a notable entry in the horror genre that shatters the zombie subgenre's traditional conventions. A mysterious supernatural plague quickly arises and consumes millions of humans all over the earth within eleven days. Mankind doesn't have a chance as the ""victims"" of this unearthly virus return from death to feast on the living. Unlike most zombie films this one provides the most realistic portrait yet, complete with a global perspective, of mankind's swift descent into a doomsday scenario, including the inevitable slow but steady response to combatting the exponentially increasing numbers of more powerful (not to mention truly horrifying) ""zekes,"" as they are called. We have a front row seat as we watch Pitt's character investigate the cause of the cannibalistic plague, traveling first to an army outpost in South Korea, from which eleven days prior, when millions of humans still lived, an email had been sent that mentioned ""zombies."" Next stop Israel, where our hero seeks out a Mossad chief who somehow knew enough to order the installation of massive walls to close off the small Middle Eastern country many days before the world at large, including its chief superpower, the US of A, could provide a first response. (Interestingly, because the outbreak spread faster than an email, growing to epic proportions seemingly in an instant, conventional action by the American government was impossible; the unnamed American President even dies and the vice president disappears amid the frenzy, as we learn. So it's the UN that's working this one, alongside the WHO.) The Israelis, we learn, safe inside the walls, are allowing the living inside.... as our Mossad general says, Each life saved is one less zombie to combat. But when a vast gathering of the saved commence an impromptu celebration of life, singing loudly, the living dead are attracted by the loud noise. The countless starving zekes outside the walls are yanked by their innate savage, useless hunger to leap at the wall quickly forming a massive tower of zombies climbing on top of each other to eventually spill over the huge wall, falling from such a dizzying height that most must've broken every bone in their dead rotting bodies. But the instinct still blazing within them forces them to crawl with unearthly speed toward the humans to gnash their teeth on warm, blood-filled flesh. The soldiers firing on the fallen still-biting zombies get too close and soon humans are themselves becoming zombies at lightning speed and are mindlessly hurtling their convulsing jaws into the closest mouthful of flesh. Even air support is not a viable defense. Pitt and a wounded female soldier manage to escape the doom on the last plane out, but one zombie also gained entry. Then the Pitt character is throwing a grenade inside the plane, blowing a hole in the rear that instantly sucks out  the attacking legion of undead --and then anything else inside not bolted down. I don't want to spoil it for those WWZ virgins. I'll add that the film's imagery really grabbed me. You won't likely forget the scene in which the zombies ""pour up"" that Herculean wall around Israel (I also was intrigued by the ""tenth man"" revelation of that Mossad chief; there's some good writing). Also the glimpses of some mindless zekes are truly terrifying; these animated corpses operate purely on primal instinct. Flesh rotting, eyes revealing pure demonic intent, jaws snapping involuntarily, these beings from hell literally hurtle themselves at the closest target with an unearthly speed.  The film's story is well thought through and deftly told. Some holes in the plot are easily overlooked as this zombie film is head and shoulders above the numerous Romero ripoffs. I enjoy the Walking Dead, but come on! The producers should be sending royalty payments to the fan vaunted and critically overlooked George Romero,  who singlehandedly forged this genre in 1968's terrifying Night of the Living Dead, followed ten years later by Dawn, then Day, and more recently a Romero zombie film that used the found footage conceit to truly raise that often misunderstood subgenre. Lucio Fulci, the great Italian horror filmmaker hired specifically to create a ripoff Romero's film (it was even titled Zombie 2 in European theaters, though there was never a Zombie 1), also created an excellent rendition of the zombie film that literally scared me so much as a youngster I couldn't sleep the night I first watched it on VHS.. But I digress... if you love a good horror film or want to be entertained and also view some  truly unforgettable imagery, see this imaginative film and pray that nothing like it ever actually happens. Because that's probably the most jarring impact of the film. Tapping into our innate dread of deadly diseases with acronyms for names, World War Z will leave you wondering if one day when you read a newspaper report that mentions the word  ""zombie"" it actually means zombie. We will never believe in ""zeke."" But should he ever arise, ""zeke"" will certainly believe in us.",1419984000,,5150,5.018713450292398

5817779,4,B00DHRLK84,I thought it was fun. It was an interesting take on how to deal with a zombie problem. It also goes to show exactly how the establishment will deal with you if you can not add to their collective. Lesson for all of us I am sure.,1419724800,,228,3.872340425531915

5817792,4,B00DHRLK84,"Good action and very adventurous plot that kept me guessing.  Intense without being overly grotesque.  Just smart, fun action.  My only critique was that Brad Pitt and his wife in the movie had absolutely no chemistry.  In fact, I didn't feel chemistry for him and his kids either.  Other than that, very good action/ sci-fi flick.",1419638400,,331,4.839285714285714
