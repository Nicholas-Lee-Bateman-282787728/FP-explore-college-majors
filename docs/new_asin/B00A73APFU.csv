8547674,5,B00A73APFU,"The film is a comedy. It shows pieces of different episodes then has them connect. It uses identical words, phrases, or actions to connect the scenes. In a way it spoofs the Buddhist philosophy that we praised in ""Cloud Atlas."" The scenes that connect:

1) This is a funeral for an elderly woman. The son is there with his wife when is very pregnant girlfriend shows up.
2) There is an insurance salesman trying to sell life insurance to another man while a girl is tired up in the background. He tells him smokers are looked on as criminals and he needs to stop.
3) Two cops, one is fairly new.
4) Star-Mart store owner with mother in wheel chair and he has an eye for the young ladies.
5) Three school girls riding around in a car.
6) Two guys drinking beer talking about Karen.
7) A broke prostitute.
8) An entertainer trying to pick up a girl in a bowling alley.

All the stories circle around and intersect during the course of the evening. I enjoyed the sound track which ranged from French pop to classical. It worked well. While the stories were not overly sophisticated, they were smart and clever.

Hey Japanese aspires to be a dark erotic comedy..pop cultural imagery abounds..unfortunately the ambitious tableau laid out for us is either hit or miss..the ""pregnant"" girlfriend's comedic peformance is a particular standout..the schoolgirls in the star mart ?..you decide..and so on...microcosmos indeed dude",1370217600,,447,5.787878787878788
