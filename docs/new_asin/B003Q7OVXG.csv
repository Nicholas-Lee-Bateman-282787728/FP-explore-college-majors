8402202,5,B003Q7OVXG,"While I am most interested steel string acoustic guitars, and with only 2 DVDs into the full set, I have found the instructional information in this set so far to be excellent and very useful for all guitar makers, in my opinion.  The best.  Generally very clearly explained and demonstrated.  I hesitated buying this set for a long time due to what appears to be a high price. However, I have discovered the price is something of a bargain given the content and full information contained there in, and well demonstrated techniques.  Of note is that the author has additional items useful in guitar fabrication, and these are mentioned (not so much pitched) in the DVD sets.  While that may be suspicious to some, But my belief is that for those who can afford the jigs purchased complete from the author, it likely saves the maker much time.  Good stuff.",1344384000,2,856,4.673333333333333
