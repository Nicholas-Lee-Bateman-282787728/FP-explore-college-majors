4552298,5,B0053TWVW8,"Poetry is probably one of the most thoughtful, thought-provoking, and touching films I have ever seen.  The story centers around a 60-something grandmother who is showing early signs of Alzheimer's and her desire to learn to write poetry.  Intertwined with this is a suicide of a middle-school girl, a horrific discovery that involves the grandmother's ungrateful (but realistically portrayed) grandson with whom she lives, and subsequent attempts by other men involved to cover up the truth.  As she tries to protect her undeserving grandson, she also happens to be the only person who feels the burden of the crime committed.  The ending is just so wistful and perfectly executed, with the recital of the one poem that she writes.

I have watched and read a few Korean films and books whose central character is an older female (notably, ""Mother,"" a film directed by Joon-ho Bong, and the book ""Please Look After Mom"" by Kyung-sook Shin).  There seems to be a reverence and a respect for older women in the Korean culture that is reflected in its art.  By contrast, there is a shortage of Hollywood films that feature an older woman as the central lead.  (Could this be because of a lack of appreciation for older women in the Western culture?  Yes, I believe so.)  If there were adventurous Hollywood producers, they can attempt to remake this into an English language film.  Of course, the quietness of this film and the emotions behind it may not translate well into a Hollywood feature.

But this is truly one of the best films ever made.",1327968000,11,1544,4.828897338403042
4552299,5,B0053TWVW8,"I started watching this movie expecting it to be a fairly uninteresting (if aesthetically pleasing) story about a woman preparing to die.  Lots of calm scenery and quiet struggles, a dash of social consciousness.  Done.

Instead, I found myself sobbing through a good third of the movie.  When I wasn't crying because of the heart-wrenching tragedy of the thing, I was overwhelmed by its honest beauty and realistic portrayal of human goodness.  So much of the best and worst of human nature is captured in this movie, and balanced so perfectly from one scene to the next -- without mood music or melodrama or unpleasant plot contrivances -- that I'm tempted to offer up Poetry as the best film portrait of humanity I have ever seen.  This is one of those rare works of realist cinema that gives viewers not just a startling insight into the difficulties of human nature (e.g. Cries and Whispers), or a heart-wrenching invitation to social consciousness (Umberto D), but also a vision of human joy and natural beauty that, because of its modest particularity and ordinariness, is sufficient to counterbalance the other darker truths and give us a reprieve from our grief.  If ever a film attested to the grace present in creation which allows goodness to survive through evil, this was it.  Watch it.  You won't be disappointed.",1327449600,19,1328,4.892857142857143

She works part-time assisting a man recovering from a stroke and looks after her grandson who treats her like a hired hand.  At the start of the film, a female teenager is seen floating face down.  An apparent suicide, she had been the victim of repeated gang rapes.  The grandmother becomes aware of the crime, investigates the scene, attends the service but flees.  Will she report this or share with other fathers of the boys involved with monetary payoffs to the poor mother? I will not reveal more of this absolutely mesmerizing film.  It is long but totally engrossing.  We want justice for this horrific abuse.  We, as viewers, have witnessed what immoral behavior people will resort to with hope of burying the truth.

4552303,4,B0053TWVW8,"Poetry is a 2010 South Korean film directed by Lee Chang-dong.  It stars Yoon Jeong-hee as Mija, a woman in her 60's raising a derelict grandson while dealing with the onset of Alzheimer's Disease.

I picked the movie based on its case synopsis but knew to expect more because of where it was filmed.  My introduction to South Korean cinema was Taegukgi and I was blown away.  Since then, I've kept the country on my radar and have not once been disappointed in their efforts.  Now I'm at the point where I prefer South Korean movies and when I found Poetry, it was an easy decision.  Once again, I was rewarded for my favoritism.

Poetry is a beautiful and disturbing film.  At the risk of exposing the plot, I'll refrain from specifics, but it makes this review difficult to write.  There aren't any major twists to give away but there are turns to take and I don't want to ruin them.  There is a suicide that involves Mija directly and the effect on her is profound.  What I most love about Korean films is the realism.  Even while their plots rotate around a ravaging sea monster, they still bring a brilliant believability out of their characters.  Poetry delivers this legitimacy also and it was a treat to be involved.  It felt real.

I think the only problem I had with the film was its length.  This particular poem weighs in at just under 140 minutes dropping it in the, ""epic"" world where haikus have to attack in packs.  But this isn't a huge problem as it seemed to go by fairly quickly.  It's my opinion that the film could have taken a bit more editing to keep it around two hours, but that's just me and I'm no filmmaker.  So what do I know?  It's something to keep in mind, though, especially if you're a quick-fix type moviegoer.  If anything, you should still grab this and make it a two-nighter.

I strongly recommend adding this to your library.  If foreign films make the world go round, this one is pushing hard.

Thank you for your time.

4552306,4,B0053TWVW8,"<strong>Poetry</strong> (Chang-dong Lee, 2010)

Note: the following review could be construed as containing spoilers, despite this not being a movie where the term ""spoiler"" would have the least bit of relevance. If you don't want to know what happens, don't read on. (But then, if you don't want to know what happens, why are you reading a review?)

The supreme irony of <em>Poetry</em>, the fifth film from novelist Chang-dong Lee (<em>Secret Sunshine</em>, <em>Oasis</em>, et al.), is revealed in a scene about halfway through the film (reprised about three-quarters of the way through). Mija (Jeong-hie Yun, one of the most popular, and beautiful, Korean actresses of the sixties and seventies), our heroine, has been taking a poetry class, and is having trouble finding inspiration. She stumbles into a reading being held by a group called Love Poetry. Suffice to say the poems--which, unlike what you'd expect to find in an American poetry reading, are a mix of original authors' works, recitations of works from famous authors, and members of the audience reading one anothers' work--are atrocious. The notes Mija is jotting down towards the poem she is supposed to write during her class are more poetic than that.

We contrast this with a series of scenes from the class. The teacher, who the students see as a great poet (but we know from the very first flyer where Mija finds out about the class he's far more skilled at self-promotion than poetry, and his every word reinforces this), has asked the students to describe their most beautiful moment. There are three scenes like this, each of them with three of the nine students in the class. The first three are heartfelt, but shallow. When we get to the scene with the second batch, they are also heartfelt, but the stories we're told are a bit more intimate. Then we get to the last batch, and we know these three people are going to throw wide the doors to their souls and let us as deeply in as they can, because that's the way Lee has structured this sequence. And given the juxtaposition of this with the first paragraph, it should not surprise you when I tell you that when we finally get to Mija, the last of the students to speak, what she says is already laced with poetry. Don't get me wrong, all three of the stories in that last bit are well-told. But Lee understands the difference between good storytelling and poetry, and that one is possible without the other. That should be an indicator to you that, given the title of his film, Lee wasn't going to mess around with a movie that's nothing more than good storytelling.

Mija's trip to the poetry classes is not the crux of the story; in fact, it's not even the main thrust. That involves her grandson Wook (Da-Wit Lee in his first screen appearance) and five of the boy's friends. In the movie's opening shot, we see a number of small children playing along the banks of a large river. (Actually, we see much more than this, but I'm abbreviating in the service of brevity; I won't tell you why, but I will tell you to pay close attention to the sequence of shots Lee and cinematographer Hyun Seok Kim use to establish presence in the opening shot. When you get to the point in the movie where you need this info, you'll thank me.) One of them stops, noticing something coming towards him, and then the camera focuses on it; it is the body of a schoolgirl. Some of the audience I saw the film with seemed shocked at this; maybe they hadn't caught the early reviews? In any case, it is established early on that Wook and the five friends he hangs out with were directly responsible for the girl's death, and the actual plot of the film deals with the closest parents to each child--the fathers of the other five boys and Mija, who takes care of Wook after his mother got divorced and moved to the city--and their plans to buy off the mother of the dead girl in order to preserver their sons' futures. This, of course, requires money. And how is a sixty-six-year-old grandmother, whom, we're also told early on, is living on government assistance and the money she brings in from a part-time job as a caretaker to an old man who's suffered a stroke, supposed to come up with her share of the payoff money?

While the movie does have a plot, and I am willing to advance that as a good thing (though not entirely, for reasons we'll get to presently), it's pretty much unnecessary to one's enjoyment of the film, save that the events at the movie's undeniably powerful ending are linked to it. This would have been just as strong a film had it been a simple character study of Mija; her adversarial relationship to Wook (a dullard, a lump, the kind of kid who's far too lazy and stupid to get into any trouble on his own; we find out in the first scene that goes into this in any depth that Wook was, in fact, just a follower), her struggle to learn to write poetry, her interactions with the people she comes into contact with over the course of the story, including her belligerent, helpless charge and the father of one of the other boys involved. (Of that subset of characters, Mija is the only one named; the others are all referred to as [x]'s father. The one to which Mija grows potentially close is Kibum's father [<em>R Point</em>'s Nae-sang Ahn, who previously worked with Lee in <em>Oasis</em>].)

And then, on the other hand, we have the plot, which Lee sometimes doesn't quite seem to know what to do with. He drops hints every once in a while about places the plot might go, such as the tentative friendship between Mija and Kibum's father, but none of those relationships ever really go anywhere. To be fair, this is also true of what looks like it could have been a comedic adversarial relationship Mija has with one of the women who lives on her street, so it's not all plot-based. Just most of it. When you reach the film's deliberately-paced climax, you get why Lee structured some of it in the way he did, but that makes it almost more disappointing; all of what you suspected about things that are there simply to advance the plot is correct, instead of those bits being as lively, and lovely, as the others. (Contrast, for example, Bela Tarr, whose characters in <em>Werckmeister Harmonies</em> are perfect little glissandos whether they're integral or not.) Still, when you see how everything falls together, you've got to hand it to Lee; he did some great setup there. This won't be any surprise to anyone who's been paying attention, however; there's nothing in this film that isn't artfully posed. My favorite example: the conversation Mija has with the nameless, blustery hospital official folowed some minutes later with the flowers in the dead girl's mother's courtyard. Especially note we are never told during the film what pink flowers signify.

With everything I said in the last paragraph, I was going to give them film a 3.5; it's excellent, and well worth seeing, but it does have some flaws. And then we got to that final shot, which is so completely amazing that I had to bump it up to four stars. The montage is so perfect that if you haven't read this, you might not even realize it's a montage (and you get bonus points if you figure out what Lee's doing before he gets to the middle shot of the montage). And then... well, that would be telling. I said at the beginning of this review that this is a movie where the word ""spoiler"" would have little meaning, but there is one exception to that rule, and it's the final shot. I think--I hope--I've given you enough to draw your attention to all the markers you will need to puzzle it out. I don't really understand why I would need to, since to me it was obvious what Lee was up to, but listening to the conversation around me as the audience I saw it with walked out, I was struck by how much was about the ambiguity of the ending, which wasn't ambiguous at all. But like most everything else about that, it doesn't matter. It's so beautifully executed that even if you have no idea what Lee is telling you in that final scene, you still have to marvel at the cinematography. Like the rest of the movie, it is enjoyable simply as a surface ride, but if you feel the need, you can dive into it and examine all the layers of meaning it holds. I would suggest either way of viewing <em>Poetry</em> is equally rewarding. ****",1307664000,6,8336,4.575635876840696

I really don't want to give anything away, so I'll refrain from commenting on the plot - but the acting and cinematography of the film were just so brilliant.

Poetry is a very thoughtful and engaging piece of cinema that artfully deals with a number of social issues from a specific Korean perspective that still allows people from other communities to relate to the characters and their problems; in other words, while it is a very Korean film, it is also a very human film that speaks to the concerns of many world wide. I found Poetry to be an uplifting and wonderful moving worth re-watching (as well as every cent I paid for it).",1393113600,,780,4.735294117647059

This Korean movie has a different perspective than American works and the director uses long scenes that has little action but evokes a lot of emotion. It takes getting use to and some may find it boring but it really is a little gem. I cant get over how its staying with me.

Story is pretty simple, a grandmother in her 60s is forgetting words. She goes to the doctors and along the way sees a young girl at the hospital that committed suicide in the river. The doctor runs tests for her and she decides to improve herself by taking a poetry class at an adult ed.

She finds out that her grandson and five other boys raped the girl for six months and thats why she committed suicide. The school wants to keep it hushed and the six boys families need to raise 25k each to try to settle with the mother and protect the boys. The woman is poor, she is living on government subsidies and works for an old man as a housekeeper. Her daughter lives in a different city and she doesnt want to tell her the news.

The rape isn't the center of the story. Its about this womans journey: trying to understand what beauty is and how to write a poem. Shes slightly ditzy and a bit preoccupied and entirely naive. Most of the time she doesnt think about the horrendous actions of her grandson because anything that shes doing: her work, a brisk walk, chatting with a neighbor, occupies her completely.

The old man that she works for attempts to put the moves on her and she refuses. Later on she does sleep with him and bribes him for the 25k. She continues to go to poetry class and listen to poetry readings because she wants a better understanding of how they do it. She meets a cop in one of these readings. At the end everything is a little hazy and it lets the audience draw conclusions.

The families settle with the woman whos daughter was killed but her grandson is still arrested. I assume that maybe she told the cop that was at the poetry society. Even though she paid the money for the settlement she may have forgot she told the cop since she has dementia. Theres evidence of this when she talked to a reporter in a scene and then remembered she wasn't suppose to later. At the end she wrote a poem in dedication to the girl who committed suicide. Her daughter comes home to an empty apt and its unclear where she went. She dropped off her poem at the school, and theres a sense that she may have killed herself in the river too but nothing is laid out.

I enjoy auteurs who don't feed you all the answers. You are able to draw conclusions from the scenes. The actor who played the title role did an incredible job. She was heartbreaking in the role and I get a good sense of her character by the end of the film. Its entirely memorable.",1392595200,,2853,4.274074074074074

She eventually enrolls in a poetry class, which influences her views on life and her surroundings as she closely inspects and questions everything. The story is much, much deeper than that, but it's better to watch than to read. Poetry is so beautiful yet so painful to watch, it truly is poetry in motion.

The story in Poetry is amazing because it can evoke so many emotions with authentic dialogue and imagery; it doesn't need sad or overdramatic music to make you emotional. There are scenes that will make you angry, sad, shake your head in disgust, and even scenes that will make you laugh; the connection you feel with the characters is real, and you've probably witness some of these scenes in your life. For example, the grandson, Jongwook (Lee Da-wit), consistently disrespects and hurts his grandmother with his uncaring and irresponsible actions and you can feel it. The story can really make you contemplate about life, and several scenes, including the ending, can be interpreted differently.  Yoon Jeong-hee did a wonderful job as Yang Mija, her performance was authentic and powerful. It's a little long, but definitely worth watching.

Overall, Poetry is an amazing, though-provoking film. It's genuinely emotional, and can affect the audience in many ways. As of 12/22/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is highly recommended.

4552354,5,B0053TWVW8,"To call a film Poetry risks some disappointment. It's such a big broad term and could be an excuse for rambling, wading through imagery meant to express beauty. The film pits poetry against the ugliness,brutality,pain and anguish of modern life. Mija(Hun Jung-Hee) plays the elderly lady like a little girl on a journey of discovery. Poetry represents things that no one can describe,something that's hard to express. She's begun to forget words( `electricity','wallet','bus terminal'),being in the early stages of Alzheimer's, just as she needs to find them and express herself. She joins a poetry class for 1 month whose aim is to write a poem by its end. She also has a grand-son who with 5 of his school mates has raped a young girl who went on to commit suicide by drowning in a flowing river,seen at the movie's start and at its end.

The old lady lives with her surly grand-son, her daughter is working abroad,she also works for a part-time pittance by nursing a wealthy stroke victim. Mija is inveigled into coming up with her share of the blood-money being raised by the fathers of the teenage boys to give to the peasant mother to prevent further legal action. Mija has her own form of resistance to the poetry group, to men and male groupings,to her Viagra-taking patient, whom she blackmails to get money to pay the hush money. Lee(director)searches for the sources of art and beauty in his meandering film. Mija learns how to appreciate an apple,a fallen apricot,an overaching tree,in order to see them she feels them. Mija's thoughts are haunted by the dead girl. Although she endeavours to observe the world around her,the words she eventually finds to write her poem spring from her empathy with the dead girl,not from her observations. The ensemble cast are all very good with integrated sub-plots. The end is heart-breaking as the poem is delivered to the class and Mija disappears.
