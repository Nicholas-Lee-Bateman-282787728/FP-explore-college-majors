6398388,3,B00K1EKVD6,"This set is the three loose cases wrapped in cellophane; no collector's box to display them together. BBC says only the initial print run came with cardboard slipcovers, so it seems a bit cheap.",1408752000,4,194,4.735294117647059
6398389,5,B00K1EKVD6,"Doctor Who has been a mainstay in the science fiction community since the 1960's. In spite of the nearly 20 year hiatus between 1989 and 2005 the show never really left the hearts and minds of its fans. Now with the new series in full swing a new generation of ""Whovians"" have emerged. If you are one of them and have always wondered what the past Dr. Who was like this collection is a great way to learn your Who history. If you are totally new to Dr. Who this collection will give you the broadest sampling of one of the longest running science fiction shows ever broadcast.

Dr. Who is essentially a long running series about a time traveler who repeatedly saves humanity and several other civilizations as wanders through time and space. His companions are generally people he picked up along the way who end up trusting The Doctor (he only known as ""The Doctor"") with their lives and assist in his adventures. The show originally was part educational, but then moved to being a creature feature sort of show. It doesn't deviate much from being a monster of the week kind of show, but it is done intelligently and with enough wit to make you forget you are essentially seeing a monster movie.

The Doctors Revisited was a BBC special series made to showcase all of the doctors over the years. The each episode in the series starts off with a documentary on one of the Doctors. This documentary covers details about the actor as well as the character, and all the things that made this particular Doctor special. This includes his personality traits, companions, first appearances of various monsters, and little technical and directorial anecdotes along the way. It's a wonderful step into the history of the show. After that you got to see an episode of the show with that particular Doctor in action. Here is a breakdown of the Doctor's, and episodes, featured on each of the series collections:

Doctor's 1-4 (1963-1981):

William Hartnell (The Aztecs) - The first Doctor Who series has many, many episodes lost due to the BBC's policy or reusing film. The Aztecs is one of the few complete episodes still in existence. While more and more footage is being found of the first doctor this episode does show a good representation of what The Doctor was in this time.

Patrick Troughton (The Tomb of the Cybermen) - While this isn't the first appearance of the Cybermen it is a memorable one. This is one of the better episodes of the second doctor.

John Pertwee (Spearhead from Space) - This episode is notable because it's the first one featuring Pertwee as The Doctor. This Doctor stayed on Earth through his series, so an introduction to the character is not a bad selection.

Tom Baker (Pyramids of Mars) - This is my favorite Doctor, but I would have picked a different episode to represent him. Not that this one is bad by any stretch. It's just there are better ones out there... it least in my opinion.

Doctors 5-8 (1981-1989, 1996):

Peter Davison (Earthshock) - This is a notable episode because of the return of the Cybermen and the death of one of his companions. It garnered high ratings the nights this one aired.

Colin Baker (Vengeance on Varos) - Colin is not related to Tom. This is one of the more entertaining episodes of the 6th Doctor. He and his companion Peri are unwitting contestants in a televised death game. Some fun scenes with The Doctor trying to repair his time machine, The TARDIS.

Sylvester McCoy (Remembrance of the Daleks) - My 2nd favorite Doctor. This was a big episode as the 7th Doctor takes on his greatest enemy, the Daleks, on a more personal level. McCoy's usual whimsy was toned down on this episode, so on the other hand that makes this one less representative of this Doctor.

Paul McGann (Doctor Who movie) - This was a failed attempt to revive the Dr. Who franchise in the United States. It's a pretty bad story with The Doctor's arch-nemesis (The Master) woefully written. Still McDann owns the role, and if this made for TV movie was better written you could have really had something here.

Doctors 9-11 (2005-2013)

Christopher Eccleston (Bad Wolf & The Parting of the Ways) - This two part story arc chronicles the last episodes of the 9th Doctor. The Doctor and his companion Rose are stuck in a ""Game Station"" in space where people participate in a reality show with gruesome results.

David Tennant (The Stolen Earth & Journey's End) - This is the most popular of all the Doctors, and this two-parter shows the return of Davros, leader of the Daleks. This is also Tennant's last two shows.

Matt Smith (The Impossible Astronaut & Day of the Moon) - These are the first two episodes indroducing the 11th Doctor. Unfortunately the second episode ends on a cliff-hanger so you won't get as satisfying a finish on this disk.

These are DVD's so the video transfer is mighty fine for this format. The older shows look like they had some restoring done, and I haven't seem them look better. Considering Dr. Who wasn't even broadcast in stereo until much later in the series the audio is still crisp and clean. So much you won't mind the lack of surround in most the series. There are no additional extras aside from the core documentary and the corresponding episode.

Right now this collection is being offered for $52, which is a VERY good price point when compared to purchasing the collections separately. Now once the price goes back up you may be better off buying each collection on their own, as they run from $25-$33 each.",1406160000,5,5491,4.654958677685951
6398390,1,B00K1EKVD6,"This was a downright insult. Buy them separate. It's $50 cheaper,  and this 'set' is LITERALLY the separate ones shrink wrapped together. I guess shrink wrap is really frelling expensive.",1403568000,35,187,5.233333333333333
6398391,4,B00K1EKVD6,"Just in case you didn't know, this Bundle of The Doctors Revisited 50th Anniversary Specials, has nothing new compared to the original DVD releases of the Specials. That said, there is some great viewing if you didn't see the specials on TV - especially if you are not familiar with the Classic Doctor Who actors and series.

As of 2013, there have been 11 actors playing Doctor Who (officially). For each of the 11 Doctors, each Doctor has a celebratory TV documentary/Special looking back on his tenure. (The Specials vary in length, usually less than a half hour without commercials.) There are interviews, photos and clips from various series. Each special is followed by one or two series starring each Doctor, including a special introduction by Steven Moffat (current Dr. Who Showrunner and Lead Writer). There are no commentary tracks or other extras on these Doctors Revisited DVD releases.

This bundle has the three original DVD sets. For more details on who appears in the Specials and synopses of the series selected to showcase each Doctor, you could take a look at the reviews of the original DVD releases, linked below.

.....1st DOCTOR - WILLIAM HARTNELL (1963-1966)
The series picked to showcase the first Doctor has no alien opponent. It is ""The Aztecs"" (1964), one of the historical series, where Doctor Who visits different time periods on Earth. ""The Aztecs"", four episodes of 25 minutes each, features John Ringham as the bad guy, played with a Shakespearean Richard III-type glee, including a hunched shoulder, that just tickles me.
.....2nd DOCTOR - PATRICK TROUGHTON (1966-1969)
Troughton is showcased by the series ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"" (1967), four episodes of 25 minutes each. This B&W series is worth watching just to see the awakening of the tombed Cyberman. Great visuals!
.....3rd DOCTOR - JON PERTWEE (1970-1974)
Pertwee's series is ""Spearhead From Space"" (1970), four 25-minute episodes. Mannequins coming to life, bursting through department store windows to attack hapless shoppers - great stuff!
.....4th DOCTOR - TOM BAKER (1974-1981)
Baker is a lot of people's favorite Classic Doctor, and he starred in 42 Doctor Who series. He is represented by the series ""Pyramids of Mars"" (1975), four 25-minute episodes.

.....5th DOCTOR - PETER DAVISON (1982 -1984)
Davison stars in the series ""Earthshock"" (1982), four episodes of 18 minutes each. Find out why the dinosaurs went extinct!
.....6th DOCTOR - COLIN BAKER (1984 -1986)
Colin Baker's series is ""Vengeance on Varos"", one of my top 10 Classic Doctor Who stories. It is great science fiction and asks the question - Are we are no different from the Roman mob gleefully giving thumbs down to a gladiator as our afternoon entertainment?
.....7TH DOCTOR - SYLVESTER MCCOY (1987 - 1988)
The last of the Classic Doctors is shown by the series ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" (1988), four episodes of 18 minutes each. The Doctor and Ace end up at 76 Totter's Lane, where the very first Doctor Who episode, ""An Unearthly Child"", took place. It was on that 1st visit that the Doctor hid a powerful Time Lord relic. In ""Remembrance of the Daleks"", he's come back to retrieve it, but a classic enemy is trying to get it, too.
.....8TH DOCTOR - PAUL MCGANN (1996)
An American made-for-TV movie, ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" (1996), attempted to revive the Doctor Who franchise. The DVD includes the movie in two formats: widescreen & feature-length, and in its episodic original format. You may be puzzled by a line where the Doctor says he is half human. It's never come up again, and most fans explain it away as hyperbole or figurative.

To the absolute joy of fans, Doctor Who is up and running again, better than ever!
.....9th DOCTOR - CHRISTOPHER ECCLESTON (Series 1, 2005)
Eccleston's documentary Special is followed by the two-part story made up by the series ""Bad Wolf"" and ""The Parting of the Ways"", the 12th and 13th (final) episodes of Eccleston's Dr Who. Our heroes are dropped into reality shows 2,000 years in the future. Reality shows with a difference - when you lose you are zapped away. Just who is in charge here?
.....10TH DOCTOR - DAVID TENNANT (started 2005 Christmas Special, then Series 2,3 & 4, through the 2-part Christmas Special 12/09-01/10))
The series selected are the linked (basically a 2-part) ""The Stolen Earth"" and ""Journey's End"", the last two episodes of Series 4 (2008).I described this as a rollicking good show, bringing back Freema Agyeman (as Martha), Billie Piper (Rose), Elisabeth Sladen (Sarah Jane) and John Barrowman (Captain Jack), united against a classic foe.
.....11TH DOCTOR - MATT SMITH (Series 5, 6 & 7, 50th Anniversary Special ""The Day of the Doctor"", and 2013 Christmas Special ""The Time of the Doctor, in total 2010-2013)
Smith is represented by another two-part story, made up of the ""The Impossible Astronaut"" and ""Day of the Moon"", episodes 1 & 2 of Series 6 (2011). Absolutely fantastic writing and plotting!  Of all things, an astronaut walks out of a lake and shoots the Doctor dead. As in Dead dead, not regenerating. Strangeness continuing, an old man arrives with a can of gasoline for burning the Doctor's body, and leaves, telling Amy, Rory and River: ""I won't be seeing you again. But you'll be seeing me.""

There is a LOT of good viewing in this Bundle! As I write this review, the aggregate costs of individual sets is less dollars than the cost for this bundle.

As a bonus, there's also a documentary about each Doctor and the different seasons

also, as of the day of this review if you add what they cost individually(remember amazon sellers aren't required to combine shipping) buying this set costs about $20 more than if you were to buy the 3 individually",1414627200,,535,4.741935483870968

The stories can be watched in either ""feature presentation"" format or the original episodic format.
