8339648,5,B001SC6XZA,"Its not for beginners. You need to understand the basics and little bit more. I believe Eckstut is not only a good poker player,he is also a good teacher and brings you level to a advanced poker player. With the golden ratio and the flop balancing i mixed up my play a lot and it works well.",1271721600,5,291,4.12280701754386

8339650,4,B001SC6XZA,I've been playing Texas Holdem about a year and I play about 5-6 hours a week.  I win playing low stake no limit.  This video was over my head.  He moves really fast.  I'll have to wait until I read some more poker books before I try to watch this video again.  I rate it high because it's not his fault I don't understand what he's talking about.,1245024000,5,347,4.044117647058823
