8176727,2,B000ND91P4,"Being a low budget movie it was still made. People this movie has bad actors but let me tell you something, They got it done. Most of you people are the worst ones. You all are the the first to say a bad review but hey try making one. Idiots!  Craw back in your caves!  Doesnt matter if it was a bad movie but WAS IT MADE! Yes thank you very much!",1426291200,,347,3.8055555555555554
8176728,5,B000ND91P4,love it just what I looking for,1411084800,,31,3.5714285714285716
8176729,1,B000ND91P4,"This movie is just another low budget, no good acting and overall is not great at all. I would not waste my time or money on this movie. All these movies are supposed to be some kind of gang/criminal lifestyle movie.  Damian Chapa needs a new carrer. Well I am not even going to get in to detail about nothing cause this movie is not worth my time. PEOPLE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1404777600,,403,4.373333333333333
8176730,5,B000ND91P4,This movie has an interesting story. This movie contains a lot of action scenes. One of Damian chapas great ones.,1361145600,,113,4.7
8176731,5,B000ND91P4,"Don't make any mistake about it, this is a very bad movie, possibly one of the worst ever made and surely the worst I've ever seen. But for comedic entertainment it is undeniably rewarding! It is hilarious, goofy, nonsensical, poorly acted. Everything anyone could look for in a Z-movie. Buy it and you won't regret it. It will provide endless hours of nonstop entertainment and hilarity!",1293321600,,388,4.893939393939394
8176732,2,B000ND91P4,"Too bad there is no ""in-between"" the stars... I didn't hate this movie, but to say I liked it might be stretching it out a bit... Most of the acting was BAD, so bad that your feelings will probably be hurt. While I can appreciate one reviewer's enthusiasm for Chapa's use of Rio Grande Valle locals as bit parts, it sure took away from the film and actually gave it an unintentional humor. Everybody who took a bullet fell forward with a protective arm up! It was almost reminiscent of a 50s or 60s western where the actors took a bullet and just seemed to stiffen up.

I respected Damian Chapa's work in ""Blood In, Blood Out,"" but I am having a hard time enjoying his subsequent movies. Even some of the Mexican DVDs in Wal-Mart's $5 bin have better acting and story lines... and I am NOT being sarcastic here. (Try ""Destino Mara"" and tell me if I'm wrong.)",1218585600,2,858,4.3625
8176733,1,B000ND91P4,"The description of this movie made it sound far better than it actually was.  The storyline was ridiculous (at best).  There was no real character development or anything that made any of the characters likeable.  It was disjointed and very predictable, with the main character spending most of the second half of the movie knocked out.  I think it was supposed to be a drama, but my family found it to be too silly to try to take seriously.  Save your money.... don't bother buying this one and think twice before renting.",1217376000,3,523,4.641304347826087
8176734,3,B000ND91P4,"This is no Blockbuster.  It went straight to DVD.  I bought the movie because I play an extra in one of the scenes, not because it was a great film.  Some of it was filmed in the RGV in Texas.  I do believe he could have brought in more known actors, but he wanted to make a movie in that particular area using some of the actual people living there.  I applaud that gesture.",1207785600,,375,4.013513513513513
