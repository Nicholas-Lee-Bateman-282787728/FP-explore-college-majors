I'd recommend this one instead:
Handgun Retention / Weapon Retention for Law Enforcement & Concealed Carry by Lenny Magill",1265500800,,205,4.694444444444445
7996253,3,B0000A5BVW,"In this film, Chuck Habermehl instructs on how police officers can gain control of suspect when fighting on the ground. There is a vast amount of techniques presented in the film, but still I have a feeling that these techniques don't cover all situations - not even all major ones.
The large amount of techniques forces Habermehl to go through them in a hurried manner, not explaining the techniques fully. More detailed treatment would have increased the rating of the film. Another problem with this many techniques is that if you try to learn them all, you end up not knowing any of the techniques properly. Therefore, it would be wise to choose some of the techniques to learn, and discard the rest (at least until you have mastered the ones chosen first). The techniques itself seem quite realistic, and there are some very interesting variations.
I don't recommend this film to a beginner. Not because the techniques are hard, but because they are not instructed in enough detail. This film would serve best, if someone with enough skill in self defence would see it through, and then choose some of the techniques, and pass them on.
