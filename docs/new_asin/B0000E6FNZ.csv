8001976,2,B0000E6FNZ,Not that great. The video lessons that come with the latest version of Garageband (for free) are better than this DVD. Not very easy to follow along with. I can find better stuff online for free... Good thing I only paid $6 on here...,1275004800,,234,4.340909090909091

8001978,5,B0000E6FNZ,"I own this and many other Rockhouse Method dvds but this is by far my favorite-I love Blues guitar and this dvd teaches you everything you need to play the blues-Riffs,turnarounds, and backing tracks to play along with. Its gives you everything except the Feeling you put into it yourself!",1210032000,2,289,4.8
