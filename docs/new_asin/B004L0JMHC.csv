8433706,5,B004L0JMHC,"Island beauty... So relaxing (*^^*)
Go to Halekulani House without key to see her beautiful hula and the best sunset!",1429315200,2,117,4.9
8433707,5,B004L0JMHC,"Kanoe's dancing is magical.  She is graceful, skilled at communicating the nuances of hula, and has chosen scenic venues that add to the beauty of her dances.  The ""talk story"" portion is an added bonus.  All in all, Kanoe is absolutely lovely.",1382400000,3,244,4.761904761904762
8433708,5,B004L0JMHC,"We bought this for my mother who has dementia.  We play it at least 5 times a week when my mother gets anxious; and over 9 times out of ten it calms my mother. Sometimes she'll even ""dance"" along. We have not gotten tired of playing this so often (as has happened with other ""soothing"" videos). The balance of talk and dance, and faster and slower gives a perfect rhythm and pace for the video.
  The only problem with it is NO CAPTIONS for the deaf and hard of hearing! I hope a re-release will have captions so my father can enjoy the conversations.
  The reviewer who panned the video for not being ""fast"" must have missed the longest word in the title that says ""ROMANTIC"".
  I sincerely hope Mrs Miller releases more videos and/or mentors other dancers in releasing similar videos.",1362441600,3,786,4.492957746478873
8433709,5,B004L0JMHC,"My husband and I have seen Kanoe Miller performing at the Halekulani Hotel in Waikiki on three out of our four Hawaiian vacations, and when you see her in person over dinner at the outdoor House Without a Key restaurant at the Halekulani, it is an unforgettable, mesmerizing and relaxing experience.  She is up there in years for a hula dancer (appears to be in her 50s), but her lovely grace and curving arm movements in the hula dance are incomparable, and she is absolutely expressive telling the story she is dancing about, which is lost on many mainlanders who don't understand that true hula is about telling a story.  Dancing beside one of the many Hawaiian slack key bands rotated at the Halekulani, if you ever visit Hawaii make it a point to see her between 5:00 and 8:00 p.m. on your ""must see"" list (it is not required to eat at the restaurant, there is a small section with chairs around the dais just for viewing her show).  We purchased this DVD when it first came out after reading an ad for it in Hawaii Magazine which we subscribe to, we wrote Ms. Miller a fan note with our order, and she was so sweet (and typically Hawaiian) to respond by autographing the front of the DVD inscribed to both of us, which we treasure.  On the DVD, besides her careful, gentle hula instruction, you will see some of the many beautiful large leis which she selects for her performances, which are a study in floral elegance.",1344038400,7,1425,4.4903474903474905
8433710,1,B004L0JMHC,"If you are looking for a DVD with really fast expert hula dancing, bypass this DVD. These are slow, and I do mean SLOW dances that won't get the pulse rate up in the least. It's rather disappointing since I was getting the DVD for my mom who is in to fast hula dancing. This DVD, unfortunately isn't the one to give her.",1338508800,2,320,4.095238095238095
8433711,5,B004L0JMHC,"I have been a fan of the beautiful Miss Kanoe Miller for many years--watching her dance at the Halekulani Hotel.  What a pleasure it was to have this DVD to bring back wonderful memories of my trips to Hawaii.  The songs and dances are delightful--especially her commentary about the songs, flowers and special places on the Island of Oahu.",1214524800,5,340,4.745762711864407
