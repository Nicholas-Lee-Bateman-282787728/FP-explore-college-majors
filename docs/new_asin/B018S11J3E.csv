7554326,5,B018S11J3E,"LOVED this movie! Has a scene in it that is probably the freakiest thing I've ever seen in a film. Watched that scene alone, four times with my boxer dog in my lap for protection. Very unassuming at the beginning which made the second half of the movie a nice surprise. I made a few people watch it (they loved it) and had some great movie chat over it.",1470700800,,353,4.130434782608695
7554327,3,B018S11J3E,"This isn't a horror movie, if that's what you're looking for. As pointed out in other reviews, the first 26 minutes are about a guy who lives a life he hates. After receiving bad news from his doctor (I think that's what happened), he goes off to live in the woods of Washington state for an indeterminate amount of time (he's sick of the crap). There are a couple of very good lines in the scene where he is talking to his girl about this decision.
This is where the film starts to get good- but not for long. It's artsy and boring much of the time. In the woods, he is being stalked by someone or something. He seeks to find this someone or something. In the scenes where he does come across his stalker, he does nothing! Boring! The guy is a total wuss. It's very hard for the audience to root for him. Maybe that's the point. Maybe his stalker(s) are symbols for something. It doesn't matter.
I give it a few stars for being fairly original and creative. But, in the end, it's not very entertaining.
Oh, and the ending sucks.",1470096000,2,1029,4.282051282051282
7554328,1,B018S11J3E,"I am a fan of unqiue, strange, and indie horror movies...but what the hell was this? I'm sorry, but random ppl in the woods with no back story or explanation of what the hell they are doing, and why they are interested in the main character just makes for a ridiculous movie. This movie is aweful, and I usually enjoy independent movies.",1469923200,,337,4.451612903225806
7554329,5,B018S11J3E,"I started to regret renting this film a few moments after it starting due to some limited acting on the part of the supporting characters and the aesthetic hints that this was obviously a lower-budget indie film. The narrative is somewhat solid: a young guy, fed up with his job (and maybe life) gets a medical diagnosis (we never find out what it is) that makes him question his life, and then he heads off into the woods for some solitary camping and reflection. Weird stuff begins to happen in the woods: things being moved while he is away from his tent, weird sounds at night, etc. There are a few scenes in the film that popped out of nowhere that are burned in my mind that are giving me goosebumps right now while thinking about them that definitely piqued my interest. Having camped by myself before, I had a decent mental context for what the main character was going through. It's a weird thing to do and freaky when the sun goes down and you have to go to sleep...alone...in the dark...in the woods. The ending was kind of off and although I feel like it wrapped the film up it could have gone deeper. Some of the more ""artistic"" scenes could have been edited out in my opinion. The one question I have is why the character didn't leave the woods and head back home after the first weird thing happens. I would have been heading back to civilization (which wouldn't have been that far away after a day or two of hiking) very quickly if some of the same weirdness happened on a solo camping trip.",1469664000,6,1507,4.405017921146953

7554331,5,B018S11J3E,"Although the last two thirds are noticeably better than the first third, which really just provides the set-up or prologue for the rest, THE INTERIOR was clearly made by a filmmaker whose concern is not just to use stylistic techniques (camera movements, editing choices, music, etc.) because they're thought to look cool or to be technically impressive, but to always do so thoughtfully and with attention to how the choice of where to put the camera, when to move it (and when not to), when to cut (and what to cut to), etc. will effect the viewer's experience.  In other words, it's a good example of what the REAL ""production values"" in a film are: not slickness or polish or flash, but intelligent use of the basic elements of the medium.  For this reason alone, it's worth watching ... and attending to properly.",1469318400,,818,4.713286713286713

7554333,4,B018S11J3E,"Abstract, unique, and defying genre, ""The Interior"" is a quiet and beautifully shot descent into surrealism.",1468886400,4,108,5.8125

7554338,1,B018S11J3E,garbage!!! nothing happens here and i paid for this crap. not even any decent nature scenes. this movie was probably all shot in someones backyard and its simplicity shows. it wasn't even a free movie on prime. spoiler alert.. its unclear whether something is chasing him or its in his head and then the movie (which i paid for) just ends abruptly without anything scary even occurring.

7554339,3,B018S11J3E,"Another movie I think I rented, but don't remember at all. Did not make any lasting impression. Like a 2 hour black out.",1471564800,,120,4.260869565217392
7554340,3,B018S11J3E,"The first 20ish minutes (Everything before our lead gets into the forest) is just dreadful. Bad acting all around, groan inducing attempts at humor, and poor production values plague the opening act. However once we get into the meat of the story, things get much better! It's almost as if the two parts of the film were made by different people, the jump in tone and quality is so immense.

Once the story really starts in the forest, the film presents and interesting and surprisingly well done psychological thriller. Essentially, the main character is diagnosed with some sort of illness so he quits his job and moves into the forest. Once in the forest, weird happenings begin to occur as our hero try's to eke out a life in his tent and little camping stove. Some great chills and beautiful nature/hiking cinematography really make the last 75% of this film pretty engaging and all in all it was an interesting if boring little film. The problem is that just not a lot happens and things happen multiple times so the effect begins to wear thin after a while.

Certainly a penny pinching budget so don't expect to many high flying special effects but if you're in the market for a minimalist psychological thriller and the opening doesn't bother you as much as I did, you may be very impressed with this film.",1471478400,,1314,4.6594827586206895
7554341,2,B018S11J3E,"This film starts out pretty interesting.  There are some funny parts, and I daresay the main character isn't the only person who hates his job, and is tired of his life and looking for a way to redo the whole thing.  Apparently bad news about his health pushes  the main actor into acting on the impulse to get away from it all.  The film is well shot, and has some beautiful cinematography it it.  There are a few shocking scenes that send a pretty good jolt of fear through you towards the middle and end.

However, the ending makes the whole thing feel pointless.  It was almost really good, but with out at least some explanation of what's going on, a great attempt falls flat.  Some of the artsy fartsy slow motion scenes, which seemed to represent a nightmare, end up being wastes of time.  I guess the terror, disorientation and disintegration the character experiences in the woods is perhaps a metaphor for his crumbling sanity and mind state.

Soooo close, but not.",1470873600,,975,4.583815028901734

8742813,4,B018S11J3E,"A subtle and beautiful horror film. Which is the most horrific part -- the protagonist's life in the urban rat race, or his experiences in the wild? This film is equal parts Into the Wild and David Lynch, with a nod to Werner Herzog's Of Walking In Ice. It's darkly funny, at least in the beginning. It gets a little arty and stylistic at times, which I found a bit overdone, but this is a unique and important film. Excellent sound design and a refreshingly quiet movie in an era of noise.",1517184000,,490,4.336956521739131

8742815,5,B018S11J3E,"If you're looking for loud jump-scares, violence or gore, look elsewhere. The lengthy introduction is necessary, as it adds dimensions to the main character. Seeing how he handles inter-personal relationships and his coping mechanisms lends immense meaning to the isolation of the remainder of the film. The camera technique is that of picturesque composition. The original score is powerfully unnerving, and the use of Chopin is more than appropriate. Most important, the story delivers a subtle and psychological mystery, which is solved through abstract expression. Put quite simply, The Interior wasn't made to be marketed, it was made to be watched.",1506902400,2,654,5.485148514851486

8742820,5,B018S11J3E,"A very helpful travel documentary about the cuisines of various spots in the interior of South Africa; other chapters cover the Cape and the Winelands. Watching it gave me a good list of places to visit, from low budget eateries to high end luxury estates.
The other reviews for this documentary appear to be in error - this is not a film, not a horror flick, and not whatever these odd people are commenting on. Best to ignore them - this is a good disk.",1477008000,,455,4.364705882352941

8742822,4,B018S11J3E,"This is a very unique movie, and the first 3rd of the film is a bit confusing as it is pretty comical, but it sets the stage for the overall story. There are some generally unsettling and creepy moments in this movie. Which is saying a lot for myself, as I am a huge horror junky, so even in the rare occasion when a jump scare makes me start. It is a very rare movie indeed that literarily gives me a shiver. Trust me when I say that there are a few scenes in this movie, that will quickly get under your skin.
If you are looking for a good autumn/Halloween time movie I would really give this a shot, as threw 2/3 rds. of the movie the main character is camping in the woods, rainy and grey, should fit that seasons mood well.
I will say that it didn't blow me away, but, I would watch it again.",1474588800,3,797,4.018867924528302
