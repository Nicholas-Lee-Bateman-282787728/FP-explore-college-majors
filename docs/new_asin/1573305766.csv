191004,5,1573305766,"This is a fabulous and funny musical tribute to Sesame Street.  It is a great variety show (a la Muppet Show) which is a plus.  Jon Stewart plays a great part of the would-be show host that gets locked in his dressing room.  Elmo is prevalent, but not as much as the title would suggest.  I don't believe that it is enough to give it disparaging marks!
(For those of you who are hung up on Elmo, check out Elmo in Grouchland!)
Rosie, Shawn and all of the stars are gregarious and wonderful for children to watch.  In fact, it is a video that I enjiy watching with or without my children!!!

It was a very ""in your face"" loud song. She loves Elmo & we were very disappointed that he was hardly in it. They like the puppets & they weren't seen much at all either. The majority of the videos and how they are performed are not for the young viewer. They never want to watch it & I don't want them too. I wish I could return it.

Granted this is more like a music video format than a Sesame Street show, but it still has all the characters familiar to children, and they are presented in such a creative way to the viewer, you can'thelp but get hooked.

191021,3,1573305766,"Elmopalooza is a 1998 TV/CD special celebrating the legacy of Sesame Street.  The name, referencing Lolopalooza, references the then newest rising star in the Sesame Street pantheon, Elmo!  The DVD is basically a musical video, and the album contains the audio performances from the TV special.  Like so many other preschool projected headed by Sesamee Street, the producers enlisted famed musicians to help bring some versatility to the project and also to appeal to adults as well as children (which they succeed, thankfully).

Once concern about the album/TV special, however, is its lack of Elmo. [As far as Elmo fans go, however, pretty much get the shaft.] For a TV special/soundtrack celebrating Sesame Street with a seeming focus on Elmo and even titled Elmapoloza, there is VERY LITTLE Elmo on the record or the video that was released in conjuction with the soundtrack.  He only appears as a major contributor to on three of the eleven songs.  The project was actually a 30 year celebration of Sesame Street, and not really focused on Elmo at all, which is quite misleading, to say the least.  In the late 1990s is when Elmo first rose to prominence, and the title feels more like a marketing ploy to lure people and also reference Lolopalooza (then a popular musical festive) in that an actual focus on Elmo himself, although to be fair I don't know what else you would call it and still attract the same amount of attention.

It is because of my status as a Parrothead that I even know about this record.  In my quest to hear all the commercially available Jimmy Buffett, I discovered this little curio of an album.  This is actually the second time Buffett has ""collaborated"" with The Muppetts (the firest being the Gonzo/Ritzo the Rat ""Hey Mr. Space Man"" song from 1995 ""Kermit Unplugged"" record).  Sadly this song was not used on ""Muppets from Space"", where it would have fit in perfectly.

Like so many other famous musicians/one off projects, the album features several current (at least, in 1998 anyway) acts doing material that you would never otherwise hear on any of their own mainstream releases.

Appropriately enough, obviously, the material on the album will obviously be mostly for preschoolers, but will also appeal to parents and care-givers, etc, largely due to the musicians selected.  The album is fairly uneven in tone.  The album can get quite raucous at times, especially the hilarious Steve Tyler rendition of ""I Love Trash"", and then other times go in a more mellow direction.  The album is also very short, at just over 31 minutes in length.

The album featuers Gloria Estefan, En Vogue (famous for their early 1990s hits), The Mighty Mighty Bosstones (another act whose principal success was in the 1990s), The Fugees, Rosie O'Donnell (!), Jimmy Buffett, Celione Dion, and Kenny Logins.  Notably, only The Fugees wrote their contribution.

For fans of these respective musicians, the compilation is only really worth seeking out for Buffett and Steve Tyler/Aerosmith.  The other material will hold little interested to any but the most dedicated of each respective musical act, with the possible exception of Gloria Estefan, who is quite exuberant in her opening ""Mambo I, I, I"" recording.

However, with Buffett and Steve Tyler, listening to their songs are definitely worth seeking out if you're a fan.  ""Carribean Amphibian"", Buffett's duet with Kermit the Frog, sounds tailor-made for Buffett, with that perfect Island steel-drum sound and flare that has made Buffett millions. I'm rather surprised he didn't write the song actually.  The track is not that far off from his own novelty/silly tunes that he does on his own mainstreams releases (which range from the obviously not pre-school friendly 1970s ""Why Don't We Get Drunk and Screw"" to again adult themed ""Simply Complicated"" and ridiculous ""Math Sux"").

Likewise, Tyler's cover of ""I Love Trash"" will be a delight to the Aerosmith fan who wants to see the more playful side of the famed lead singer.  I can imagine if such a title appeared on an actual Aerosmith album, the lyrics would be MUCH MORE adult oriented.

Unless you are a fan of Buffett/Aerosmith/Sesamee Street in general (and possibly Kenny Logins, whose contribution is pretty good too), I'd give this a pass as now the record is probably out of print.

191027,5,1573305766,"I was extremely surprised when I read in several reviews that children didn't care for Elmopalooza. I bought the video for my second son when he was a toddler (now 16) and it became something I could stand to watch repeatedly (as kids do) with him. It became worth its weight in gold when my 3rd son was born. He had chronic ear infections which made lying down and sleeping and issue from 3 months old on. He, as a 3 month old, loved the video, particularly the songs,and could fall eventually fall asleep sitting up while listening to it.  It was a  necessity during his following surgeries and remained a favorite until he aged out around 5. Based on this success, I have purchased the DVD for several friends with younger children and it has been just as much of a hit with all of them.  As for Elmo not being in it, he is, just not constantly.  Quite enough to catch the interest of most Elmo fans.  The music and dancing are captivating, the humor appeals at multiple levels and, for most very young children, it will be a hit. For those who are looking for Elmo skits, PBS has Sesame Street dvds. For kids who are hooked on computer games and CGI, this may seem a little slow paced but it's a great multi-age-appropriate video in my opinion.",1329782400,,1248,4.3852813852813854
191028,2,1573305766,"Our toddler loves Elmo, and loves all the musical numbers on Sesame Street. We were looking for something that would just focus on the Sesame Street songs and videos so we wouldn't have to fish through a whole episode of Sesame Street to find them one song at a time. This video only slightly accomplishes this.

It's a cute little show. It is quickly obvious that it aired on TV in the 90s. It's littered with B-list celebs with some comical appearances from those who fell off the face of the earth and a few young versions of those that are still around. There is lots of filler, and the songs are just Okay. This has all the merits of what should be free content, so my 2-star score is relative to paying $10 for the streaming/download version. Don't pay for it unless you really really really need some on-demand children's music videos. Free content is generally equal to better quality...this is just slightly more convenient.",1326499200,,933,4.620481927710843
191029,5,1573305766,The music in this video is fun and the in-between jokes are just silly. My 20 month old son sits and watches this entire video.  Even my older children will get sucked in and watch the whole show.,1324425600,,196,4.157894736842105

The 5yr old follows the interim bits, and the baby doesn't need to be so glued.  The older one started singing the songs around the house by the second watching.  I don't mind the hearing the songs repeatedly in the background either. Rosie O'Donnell's song is the 5yr old's favorite (who's also been a big Jimmy Buffet fan and enjoyed seeing him,) and the baby goes nuts for the Fugees.  This is my favorite Elmo simply by virtue of not leaving that awful ""Elmo's World"" song stuck on repeat in my head....  Elmo loves his goooldfish, his crayon toooo - Ack, I only had to think about it a second for it to happen.  I might turn Elmopalooza back on.",1203465600,,766,4.205479452054795

191042,4,1573305766,"Pros:

1.  Some stand-out performances by some stars that only Sesame Street could get to sing with a puppet.  Like them or not, En Vogue does a beautiful video about monsters.  Rosie O'Donnell does a terrific duet with Elmo, teaching that singing isn't about ""vocal talent"" but presense and fun. Jon Stewart and David Alan Grier are both unexpected naturals on a Muppets'stage and showed serious kid appeal.  And The Fugees are so good in this, their two minutes are alone worth keeping the movie for.

2.  Nice, basic messages for kids and adults to learn:  *problem-solving, *how to work together, *to never underestimate the contributions of the smallest (a lesson brought in several times) and *that music is for everyone, not just famous singers.

3. Some of the songs are very catchy.  My 3 yr old is singing Gloria Estefan's Mambo song around the house after hearing it maybe 4 times.

Cons:

1. The title suggests it stars Elmo, which it doesn't.

2. Some of the artists are weak here, while others rock the house.  I hoped for a lot better from the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

3. Weak storyline will irritate those who gravitate to plot/drama (though it won't bother those who want the music and jokes.)

4. Lots of the performers were terribly ""underutilized,"" which will disappoint adults who know what those folks are capable of.  Tyra Banks is great with kids, but you can't tell from her twenty seconds in this movie.  Chris Rock performs like he's literally reading the script for the first time.

5.  The best jokes here are the ones only the adults will get, even though Sesame Street usually does a great job of making great ""preschoolers-will-get-this"" jokes.

Bottom line:  Elmo-a-holics may feel ""baited and switched"" but general Sesame Street fans and music lovers will enjoy this one.  This definitely could have been better but my son + I will be watching this a lot and loving it.",1167264000,13,1904,4.7907692307692304

The reason I am even writing this today is that I getting another one because one of my boys is autistic and he STILL watches it. He loves Jon Stewart as do I and I have been trying to find a cd that has the same Kenny Loggins songs as in Elmopalooza. Can anyone help there?

fast forward several months later. my son was 8 months old when his nanny started playing this whenever she has something else to do. and beleive it or not, my son just loved it! at first there were particular songs he loved like ""Just Happy to Be Me"" and ""I Don't Want to Live on the Moon"". After several repetitions he now loves this video and is willing to watch it several times a day if we let him. he just sits entranced in front of the tv whenever we play this and he is very familiar with the songs.

My first thought when I watched it was that the music was great, but the plot was left something to be desired.  But after watching it over and over and over...

It would be a great gift for anyone with a toddler!,1110844800,3,354,4.298507462686567
191051,5,1573305766,"My kids (13 months and 4) really enjoy this video.  My 4 year old knows all the songs by heart and performs them even when the movie isn't playing.

While not very educational, I don't rely on the TV to educate my children.  That's my job and the job of my 4 yr. old's preschool.  The creative aspect in my daughter singing the songs and making up her own dances more than makes up for the lack of ""education"" in the video.  Education is found in the strangest places and doesn't have to be ""in your face.""

My 13 month old also loves the video.  He dances to the music and in between takes a break because he really lets out some energy in his dancing!

This movie is also enjoyable for parents.  There is some humor injected in it that will make you chuckle - not the kids.  It's not ""adult"" humor, but humor an older child could understand or an adult.  I really appreciate it!

If you're looking for this movie to teach your children their ABC's, move on.  If you're just looking for plain old fun for kids of all ages, this movie is for you.",1108944000,6,1046,4.1959798994974875
191052,2,1573305766,"I just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter.  I was disappointed with the 4 dollars I spent on it for that.  It is more like a music video than a story.  The segments are of adults, no children singing or playing and the story line isn't much.  Sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there wasn't anything educational about this video and I am so glad I didn't buy it.  I really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now I'm sorry that we did even that.  Stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy.  I hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were.",1092441600,4,670,4.147286821705427
191053,5,1573305766,"My one year old is addicted to Elmo.  We'll have to find her a 12-step program because my 4 year old wants to watch other things.  But the TWO of them will gladly watch this and DANCE, DANCE, DANCE.  I'm glad that I was not swayed by the reviews that said the kids would not like this DVD because my kids love it.  Probably because they love all kinds of music.  Because my daughter loves Elmo, the one song ""I want a monster to be my friend"" is just perfect!!! We sing it all the time.",1074643200,2,486,4.020833333333333
191054,2,1573305766,"This video doesn't entertain or captivate my children like the other Elmo videos we love(Best of Elmo, Wild West, and Adv. in Grounchland).  Don't waste your money on this one.",1061683200,2,176,4.866666666666666
191055,5,1573305766,"I see a lot of ambivalence about this DVD, and I would like to put in my two cents in support of it. My two-year-old likes it a lot, and I think the songs and storyline are rich enough to hold his interest into the early elementary years. I consider it a great value for that reason.
It is essentially a collection of kid-friendly music ""videos"" presented in the context of an accompanying storyline. Don't expect to see Elmo in every song, but he is central to the storyline and appears frequently between songs.
Parents will find this entertaining. The storyline is funny, the songs are enjoyable for all, and the production values are outstanding.
I confess, at first I feared my son would be bored by it because the storyline and music are a little more sophisticated than the usual singsong children's fare. But kids thrive on repetition, and after just a few viewings, he became familiar with the music. Now he asks for this DVD frequently, and I am always happy to oblige.",1058054400,5,979,4.6
191056,2,1573305766,"After owning/renting numerous Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, this seemed to be among the more disappointing because:
- Elmo barely appears in this video
- The artists play/sing with little interaction with the characters.
- Very few songs were catchy and kept my son's attention
- Who said that Rosie O'Donnell could sing???
This title sounds like a fun video...but it's not.",1053734400,5,373,5.032258064516129

I think my husband and I have seen it over 100 times and we still enjoy it.  It has a variety of musical acts, all very entertaining and creative.  Jon Stewart is hilarious!",1019606400,,302,4.245614035087719
191061,5,1573305766,"I have to disagree with the reviewer who says this video isn't good for little kids.  My daughter LOVES this video and has since she got it for her first birthday.  She wants to watch it over and over.  Her 4 year old cousin wants to watch it whenever he comes to visit.
It's fun enough that you don't mind watching it over and over again.  John Stewart and David Alan Grier are hilarious and the music is great.  The only part that I don't particularly care for is Rosie O'Donnell, but that's just because I don't like her.
Buy it for your kids.  You won't be disappointed",1018137600,20,573,4.2592592592592595
191062,1,1573305766,"Let me start by saying our son is a big Elmo fan, and we think ""The Best of Elmo"" is tremendous.
This DVD starts VERY VERY VERY slowly...and gets worse and worse and worse.  The opening segment takes forever to get through and offers nothing to keep your child's attention or your attention. When the music finally starts, it is disappointing beyond description.  Our son hated it, we hated it, and returned it after 1 abbreviated viewing.  This DVD has nothing to offer for anyone in any age bracket.",1015977600,2,501,4.606741573033708

191065,5,1573305766,"After reading other reviews it seems that this title is a hit and miss with kids.
Interestingly while one review mentioned his/her child preferred Elmo in Grouchland, my son (14 months old) prefers this title instead.  It just goes to show that kids of all ages have various tastes.
One thing is for certain, I'd take a day full of playing this DVD repeatedly over a day full of Barney.  The tunes are catchy, particularly Shawn Colvin's ""I don't want to live on the moon"" and En Vogue's ""I want a monster to be my friend"".
Rent it and then buy it . . Thats what I did . .",992390400,3,572,4.1909090909090905
191066,1,1573305766,We were disapointed to see this video had very little of Elmo and a lot of Rosie O'Donnell. It really didn't keep me son's attention - and when Rosie broke into song - my son broke into the other room. His other Sesame Street video Let's Make Music keeps him interested even after 40+ veiwings. Elmopalooza lost his interest the first time he saw it.,991267200,5,350,4.4
191067,2,1573305766,"My son (17 months) picks up and asks to watch the DVD/Video he wants. We own 7 different Sesame Street videos and this is the only one he has never asked to watch again and actually walks away from it when it is on the TV. That is the main part of the review. As to why?, probably because the songs are not so catchy for young kids, even though the preview on the other tapes makes Elmopalooza appealing. I was suprised by the quality, usually Sesame Street is synonymous with an excellent product. Although I did like the Rosie number and it is Sesame Street, so I gave it two stars. If your child loves to dance and hear music try Sesame Street's Count 'Em 1-2-3, I think we've played it over 100 times already!",990489600,4,713,4.25
