2327661,2,B0009WIE34,"This is my favourite comedy on television, but the 4th season was a disappointment by far. 'The Producers' storyline gets stale after the first couple episodes, it really was like they just gave up for this season and stopped trying. ""Coast mode"" as someone else described it, fits quite well.

One of the things I love about CYE is that every episode is something new and different, but season 4 definitely lost that comedic magic.

If the new season isn't an improvement over this, I think it's time that they call it quits. But I'm hopeful that CYE's best days are ahead.

I'd say buy every other season on DVD, but skip this one.",1125878400,7,633,4.535087719298246
2327662,2,B0009WIE34,"This is the season that the show jumps the gefilte fish. Larry as the star of B'way's THE PRODUCERS?! Extended guest appearances by Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer can't save (and may actually contribute to) this one from being the weakest season to date. (How much deadpan dourness can a viewer take?)

But even when Stiller and Schwimmer aren't around, this season is on ""coast mode."" Too much reliance on forced, unfunny variations of David's now-predictable shock-value humor. Not enough Cheryl Hines. Even Jeff seems bored/tired.  If the next season's no better than this, everyone should call it a day and quit while they're still ahead of 90 percent of the junk on TV. They're entitled.",1125792000,10,693,4.9655172413793105
2327663,3,B0009WIE34,"The fourth season gets off to a strong start with two incredibly funny episodes featuring Ben Stiller, and a promising arc that places Larry as the star of Mel Brooks's Broadway hit 'The Producers'.

Unfortunately, subsequent episodes are only sporadically funny (with 'The Blind Date' being a memorable low-point in the show's history), and the hour-long payoff 'Opening Night' is a broad letdown.

Of course, this is 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' we're talking about here, so it's still better than 95% of the rest of the comedies on television... just ""off"" of its previous levels of quality.",1125446400,5,588,5.114583333333333
2327664,5,B0009WIE34,"I am very disappointed that when i recieved the CYE Season 4 DVD set and watched Episode 8 Wandering Bear episode. The Scene when Larry and Jeff sit down and watch Girls gone wild video at Jeff's house and they show the girls breasts and larry and jeff comment on it and larry makes a funny joke was edited out of the dvd. They also argue when Larry asks Jeff to Pause the DVD when he goes out to get his pair of glasses from the car.  The original broadcast showed the scene but it was cut from the DVD.. Did anybody else notice this edit. If so, i urge everyone to call and complain to HBO at 212 512 1208 and complain and see if they can add it and re-press the dvd for the ORIGINAL EPISODE.",1125360000,9,694,4.028985507246377
2327665,5,B0009WIE34,"The 'unique' comic genius of Larry, his writers, cast & crew continue to put me at risk of sudden death from 'lethal laughter', but what a great way to go!  I don't know if the guys can ever surpass the last few minutes of last season's 'Grand Opening' episode, but hysterical scenes from such episodes as ""The Survivor"", ""The Carpool Lane"" (with THE quintesenntial L.A. hooker)come VERY close, as do the dilemmas Cheryl & the high-strung Suzy Greene face in the episode with the 'inverted condom', the 'wounded dog', and Wandering Bear's ability to magically ease the problems of all  -  with Larry in full retreat! I have all of the seasons DVD's & take them to family gatherings where there are no HBO viewers.  It may take them a few minutes to catch on to the complexities which regularly confront our unfortunate friend, L.D., but like me, they are now hooked!  I ""may have erred"" by adding a few minutes of some CLASSIC 'Curb' dialogue to my 'ring tones', but we only live once!  Just imagine the stares I got while looking for a gift for my wife at ""Victoria's Secret"", of all places, when my phone 'rang' quite loudly & very clearly with the profane ranting of the 'Terret Syndrome chef', Larry, Jeff, Cheryl, Suzy, et al at Larry's new restaurant on opening night!  I have to admit, for a few moments I felt like the REAL Larry David!  I can't remember if I RAN from the shop or was being chased out, by I DO recall gasping for air, not a result of my fleet-foot departure from the hostile environment, but rather from trying to recover from fits of hysterical laughter!

2327669,5,B0009WIE34,"Larry David does it again...another great season!  I have heard a lot of people complain that there are only 10 episodes and therefore the price is steep.  I do have to disagree.  You really get what you pay for.  In my opinion, I'd rather have 10 excellent episodes (each worth watching again and again)  versus 30 crappy episodes of something that I don't even want to watch one time.  So far I have watched the episodes from the first three seasons at least 5 times.  There is no other TV series I own on DVD that I want to watch over and over again.  So I feel my money was very well spent.  I hope Larry keeps making Curb, for many more seasons.",1120694400,18,650,4.219512195121951
2327670,5,B0009WIE34,"A lot of people pointed out the quality of ""Curb"" went downhill in the fourth season. I disagree. The ""Producers"" storyline with Ben Stiller and then David Schwimmer was just as great as the first three with some hilarious episodes. I read there are no extras in the set. A shame--so much could have been included, and the price is a bit steep considering there were only ten episodes. I got the first couple of seasons for $20,but the show is such a gem I suppose it is worth paying a little more..but it would have been nice to have those extras in there.ala Seinfeld.",1118793600,52,570,4.438095238095238

The season long subplot, inventive, as ever, has our Larry picked by the great Mel Brooks to play the lead of The Producers on Broadway.  The season covers Larry's preparation for the role, including many scenes with his first and second co-stars, Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer.  Every episode in this season is excellent.  The show is better than the excellent Seinfeld, which also came out of the brilliant David's brain.  It is my favorite all-time show, and this season was vintage Curb.  Not all seasons are great, however.  The first five seasons were A+.  Season six had very few funny moments.  Season seven had a few more, including one of the best all-tie episodes, ""The Black Swan.""

While this was funny in the first season, and even partly through the second season, it is getting very, very old.  If Larry's character showed any sign of growth or change, I might be able to maintain interest.

Admittedly, I am fascinated by the long-running gags in the series (sometimes it takes a couple of seasons for Larry's actions to catch up with him).  And I'm a sucker for anything featuring Richard Lewis.  But enduring Larry's ongoing meanness, and his shock and whining when it comes back at him, are not the way I want to spend my viewing time.",1450137600,,715,4.772357723577236

I have started the practice of making observations when I'm out in public pursuing mundane activities.  No great or even good stories from this practice, but I think they will come with time.

Larry David is a comedic genius, I've never failed to get through an episode without laughing or actually feeling better about my own plight in life.

From Mel Brooks plot to get larry to demolish his own show, pet business and vagina problems, larry just makes you want to cringe (in the best possible way).Great guest appearances by Ben stiller and my favorite man on tv today Stephen Colbert. I hadn't watched curb in a while. Hence, nothing after season 6 (life altering times & basically stopped watching tv). Anyway, terrific show and i recently purchased some newer seasons.

2330356,4,B0009WIE34,"The first three episodes of the fourth season of the brilliant TV series ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" are a little worrying. They're both pretty solid, although overall, they don't quite match the quality of the first three episodes of the past two seasons. ""Mel's Offer,"" although thoroughly entertaining and introducing one of the show's greatest story arcs, is a good example of Larry David stretching too far and trying too hard to be funny. The next two episodes are another example of an episode having a good plot, but relying too much on generic comedic cliches and physical slapstick for its humor. For a show that started off very realistic and life-like, this caused me to wonder whether or not season four would be as good as the previous two seasons.

However, the season only starts off rocky. After that, it quickly gets back to the same quality it had before with an unheralded classic (""The Weatherman""), which is the first episode to have little-to-no 'The Producers' stuff in it, but has a storyline that's interesting enough on its own. Next up is a fan favorite (""The 5 Wood""), in which Larry gets Jeff and Susie kicked out of a country club over his five wood being in a funeral casket. ""The Car Pool Lane"" is another fan favorite (although slightly overrated in my opinion) about Larry finding an innovative way to use the HOV lane in order to attend a baseball game on time.

The next two episodes are pretty solid, with the former featuring Wanda Sykes. Unfortunately, though, I think it's the only episode Wanda Sykes appears in. More of her would have been nice. After that is a brilliant episode with a sub-plot of whether or not a 'Survivor' game show member or a Holocaust survivor had it worse in their respective events. ""Opening Night"" is a series-best, with all the different sub-plots coming together in a brilliant second half, as well as an interesting plot twist near the end.

Two things I liked about this season are that it was more coherent than the past three (having much more focus on 'The Producers' storyline) and that certain guest stars (especially Ben Stiller) were used very well. However, a little more Wanda Sykes would have been nice, and the first three episodes, although still at least good, weren't really up to CYE standards. Otherwise, another excellent season of an excellent show.

Best episodes: ""The 5 Wood"" and ""Opening Night""

After a couple of episodes (if you actually get this deep into it before throwing away the dvd's) you realise that the dialogue actually follows the same structure and speech patterns that Seinfeld does - only this show has no proper actors or comedians to deliver the lines.
It's stiff, slow, tries to hard but keeps on failing, annoying, embarrassing and quite frankly a disaster.
I have no idea who these guys are that gives this 5 stars, but they have to be family of Larry's.

His constants struggles with the rehearsals and his fellow cast and crew members are truly hilarious.

2330423,4,B0009WIE34,"This season continues the awkward hilarity of Larry David's escapades. In this season he stars in a Broadway production of The Producers with Ben Stiller (and then David Schwimmer when Stiller can't put up with Larry), tries to follow through on his anniversary gift from Cheryl (after 10 years of marriage, he's allowed to have sex with another woman, if he can make it happen),  hires a Native American to do his landscaping (and help with another problem of Cheryl's), helps his secretary get back together with her boyfriend, accuses a weatherman of lying to clear the golf courses and much more.

I watched 8 of the 10 episodes directly one after the other. The only reason I had to stop was 4 hours of any show is enoguh. This season is more cohesive as a season than previous ones have been. Story lines followed over into the next episodes more often than they have in the past.

But overall, I think this was the weakest of the 4 seasons leading up to this point. I think that just has to do with the stakes being raised so high. In previous seasons Larry dealt with small every day things, whereas in this season he's starring in a Broadway musical and trying to hook up a blind guy with a date.

That being said, it's still one of the funniest things on television. Larry still delivers the laugh. And any scene with Jeff or Cheryl is almost guaranteed to be hilarious. Surprisingly, the best guest star was a young boy playing Cheryl's nephew, who refuses to teach Larry a magic trick because he's ""not a magician"".

2330442,5,B0009WIE34,"It is difficult to believe after seeing the first three seasons, but the fourth season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is even more outrageous then the previous ones.  The main cast remains the same, with Larry David playing himself, Jeff Garlin as Jeff Greene (Larry's agent), and Cheryl Hines as Cheryl David (Larry's wife).

Once again there are ten episodes in the season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""; however the season finale is a full hour long.  This season there are multiple plots which run through some or all of the season.  The season long stories include Larry joining a Broadway production of ""The Producers"", and the David's 10 year wedding anniversary and the gift that Cheryl promised him before they ever were married.  There are also smaller plots, such as getting kicked out of their country club and trying to join a new one, and insulting David Schwimmer's father.

Each show has its own plot as well, which have Larry disrupting Ben Stiller's birthday party, setting up a blind man on a blind date, paying a hooker to ride in his car so that he can use the car pool lane, and much much more.  While there are a couple of points in this season where they perhaps go a bit far, on the whole it is the best season yet.

This DVD box set includes 2 DVDs, which have all 10 episodes.  As with the second season, there are no extras, but when you have a show this funny, who needs extras?",1136505600,3,1397,4.511904761904762
2330443,4,B0009WIE34,"If you liked the first three seasons of Curb, you probably will like the fourth as well. Not all of the jokes work (do they ever?), but I was glad to see that despite the ""Hollywood"" bent of season four (where Larry gets help from celebs such as Mel Brooks, Ben Stiller, and David Schwimmer) Larry remains Larry. I mean, what other comedian would make a reference to the ""Great Compromiser"" Henry Clay? A bundle of contradictions, Larry is at once withdrawn and confrontational, overly conscientious yet also incredibly insensitive. Although I can't buy that any woman, let alone Larry's long suffering wife, would permit her husband a one-time fling as a 10th anniversary present, the running gag pays off because it sets up a series of encounters where Larry shows how inept he is at wooing women (remember, in season two he said he could talk anyone into anything, except getting women to sleep with him). And though I had doubts about whether the Producers plot would work, it does. Larry offends not one but two of his Producers co-stars as well as countless others along the way. There's a twist in the last episode that took me by surprise, and it was clever too. Sometimes the show strains too hard to find confrontations in everyday events. For example, I've never encountered a stewardess as rude as the one Larry comes across on his flight to New York. Nor would a black guy in real life walking past Larry's car instantly accuse Larry of racism just because he turned on his car alarm. But if some of the gags are forced, season four is as funny as the others. Larry might get more abrasive with each season, but he is no less amusing. Season four, as with the others, stands up to repeat viewing. And we get a one hour final episode that is much funnier than the last episode of a certain other Larry David sitcom. The best entry here involves Larry's efforts to avoid the rush hour crowd by picking up a hooker so her can use the much faster carpool lane. That episode might contain the most awkward, not to mention funny, drug deal in TV history.",1135641600,3,2061,4.557951482479784

Luckily I was a fool for taking note of the reviews contained here. It's true that the first four episodes rely on self-parody, with the jokes never really coming into their promised fruition. But halfway through it picks up, offering some of the funniest moments of the show (particularly in the Car Pool Lane). I found the story arc to be the best yet, though I will say that they are beginning to rely on continuity too much; many jokes span two episodes. Still, who can complain about strong series continuity?

Despite his self parody in the first eps, Larry is on top form for most of the season, managing to make all the crazy happenings seem somewhat believable. He even pulls off the Producers with style. Ben Stiller is fun to see on screen for maybe 5 minutes, but becomes grating to watch after a while. Fortunately, By halfway through the season, Ben is out and David Schwimmer is in, pulling off hating Larry better than possibly anyone else in the series' history. The levels of hate he brings, wow. As for the rest of the cast regulars... they actually seem a bit subdued this year (Jeff had a stroke at the end of season 3 so I can understand that, but the taming of his wife's temper doesn't really make sense). Not much Lewis here, but the addition of Larry's dad pays off.

Definitely one of the better seasons (I personally think 1 is the best and 3 is the worst)... let's just hope season 5 comes out  on DVD in the next few years.",1130025600,8,1662,4.421568627450981

Things get a little corny/predictable when in the final episode, the show turns into a parody of The Producers, but then again its nice to see Larry wear his influences on his sleeve. Maybe he should also include a Woody Allen parody in a future show. Would have liked to have seen more of Richard Lewis in this series - I love the relationship that he and Larry have on this show which (so they say) mirrors their off screen friendship.

We should remember the influence of John Cleese creator of Fawlty Towers, maybe the finest TV comedy to date,who simply realised his legacy after two seasons.

2330481,3,B0009WIE34,"What made Larry David so amusing and appealing in season one was that his neurotic behavior and eccentricites were ones I could relate to in some way: somewhere in my experiences I could think of situations I've been in where I had the same hang-ups, complaints, or observations. It seems that in each subsequent season, he has become less funny and more of an irritating kvetch. It becomes more and more difficult to relate to, and empathize with, his character as he complains about increasingly mundane things, isolating himself further from shared experiences we all have, until he has become a bit of an annoying oddity. He has gone from being the voice of reason in a room full of self-absorbed supporting characters to the guy at the party that you just wish would stop complaining and go home. Clean up your locker at the country club, put the skewer down, don't buy the cashew raisins if you don't like them, and quit being such a nudzh.",1126656000,8,946,4.6706586826347305

In fact, he gets in so much trouble this season that it is hard to keep up with the number of people who hate him. Still, it is funny. There are alot of funny moments where Larry embarrases himself. Also, Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer are pretty funny in the episodes they are in.

Even though it does feel like Larry is running out of good ideas,  it's hard to resist his gift for pissing people off.",1126656000,2,598,4.274336283185841
2330483,5,B0009WIE34,"If you're new to CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, don't start with Season 4, unless it happens to fall in your lap.  Try to start from the beginning.  There is actually a subtle progression to the show.  Each episode contains both ""self-contained"" stories, and ongoing issues that develop from show to show, and sometimes from season to season.

But I'm assuming that if you're looking at Season 4, you're already interested in or familiar with CYE.  Season 4 is a laugh-riot.  I think the season now has the perfect blend of Larry David, the unfortunate victim of circumstance and Larry David, the jerk who brings bad things on himself.

On one hand, Larry tries to be a nice guy.  He always seems to enjoy the company of children, for example...in a genuine way.  He'll sit down with them and play their games and talk to them like they're actually interesting.  To him, there's no one who isn't worth talking with and trying to be friendly with.  This is an admirable trait...which always gets him in trouble.  On the other hand, Larry never knows when to quit.  He'll start on a subject (for example, he begins to suggesting possible ""oriental-sounding"" names to a secretary who is getting ready to adopt a child), and his riff becomes more and more inappropriate and the signals from the woman become easier and easier to notice, but he blithely rambles on...making an enemy whose disgust WILL come back to bite him.

Often, Larry David is categorized as a misanthrope.  To me that's far too easy.  What I like about him is that he can go from charming and amusing and genuinely concerned about something (his interactions with his wife, for example) to an overbearing, overopinionated jerk in about two seconds flat.  We see him crossing the line, but he never sees it himself.  He thinks his complaints or questions are perfectly reasonable. (There's a great scene where he is waiting in a doctor's exam room for the Dr. to appear...so he uses the phone in the room.  Doctor [brilliantly under-played by Phillip Baker Hall] explains that the phone is not for a patient's use.  David just keeps insisting on knowing why.  He tries at one point to restrain himself...but he just can't help it...he's obsessed with getting an explanation!).

The big story of the season is Larry being hired by Mel Brooks to take the lead in THE PRODUCERS on Broadway.  It's a bit of a stretch to believe Mel would make such a choice, but if you buy it...you're in for a real treat!  Ben Stiller appears in several early episodes and is very funny doing his ""slow-burn"" schtick.  The show has always been great for letting its guest-stars playing themselves turn their whole images upside-down.

It's unfortunate that a typical CYE season only has 10 episodes...but heck, each one packs the laughs of 3 or 4 typical sitcoms into it, so from an entertainment standpoint, you can't beat this show.  Every episode makes me laugh out-loud many, many times.

By the way, in case you don't know...these shows ARE NOT FOR KIDS!!!  They contain very frank (and funny) language and situations.  Strictly for adults.  But highly recommended too!!",1126569600,15,3112,4.782363977485929
2330484,5,B0009WIE34,"Season four of Curb Your Enthusiasm is a satisfying continuation of the Larry David brainchild.  While the season lacks a classic episode like the seasons before, there is a common theme throughout the season.  Mel Brooks offers Larry David the lead role on the Broadway show ""the Producers.""  While Larry prepares for the show, he also tries to figure out how to cash in on his wife's tenth anniversary present.  Larry laughs in the face of political correctness while soliciting a hooker, buying marijuana, stealing a golf club from a coffin, and refusing to sit in the front seat of a car next to Ben Stiller.  The season ends in an hour-long episode (a first for the series).

Curb Your Enthusiasm fans will love season four, but I urge those that are new to the series to start from the beginning.  While season three remains my favorite, there is enough to love about season four to watch it again and again.

I used a very unusual phonetic spelling and a very loosely coded slang that I figured hard-core viewers of the show would understand.  Well, I had ladies and gentleman alike explain that the reviews and the language that made them up were too ""difficult.""

So I've decided to drop the comedy and play it straight in the review.  Unlike the preposterously overrated ""Seinfeld,"" this show by Larry David strikes a chord that resonates much deeper than nonsense such as a soup-nazi (which is one of the weaker socio-political aspects of ""Seinfeld"" - a total disrespect for historical events that need not be trivialized through 'jokes').  Larry David does, in fact, portray a stereotypical fuss-budget (if you don't understand that slang term, I suggest you consult an on-line urban dictionary).  In doing so, he and his long-suffering wife Cheryl (portrayed sympathetically by the incomparable Cheryl Hines) make themselves two of the most relatable characters currently on television.",1126137600,4,1122,5.3107344632768365

With a lack of new story lines, Larry seems to be pushing the funny a little too much as evidenced by cheap and unfunny laughs, like bumping into Ben Stiller with a skewer for example.

What makes the show great is when the seperate storylines all come together in a comical way.

Take last year for example, in the only episode I liked Larry threw his trash in another guys wastebasket.  And the guy threatened Larry, saying that the next guy that threw something away in his basket would catch a beatdown.

After Larry argues with Ted Danson about a shirt and rips it, Ted unwittingly throws away the shirt in the same guy's wastebasket and the guy goes off.

Differing plotlines coming together, that's what makes the show funny, not forced comedy like Larry is resorting to now.

If the show is to recover, it needs to return to the form it took in the first 2 years, the last 2 years we've given him a pass.  Time to put out or be fazed out Lar.",1126051200,6,1116,4.301435406698564
