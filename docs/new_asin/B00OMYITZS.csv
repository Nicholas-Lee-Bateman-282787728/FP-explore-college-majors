8684319,5,B00OMYITZS,"Jack and Victor are back, and they brought the whole COT (Craiglang Old Team) to celebrate!
This LIVE production at the Hydro in Glasgow played to sell out crowds during its month long run, and even bumped U2 off from their planned performance due to public demand for Craiglang's favorite pair of pensioners!  Different than the BBC aired version, the disc has many new scenes and longer bits of dialogue, for some reason or other didn't make the TV broadcast.  This truly is the next best thing if you couldn't see the live shows!

If you are an American, and have no clue what Still Game is all aboot(!), I can not stress strongly enough the need to see the entire original TV series.  Preferably on some media that has closed captioning or subtitles; not that it is necessary, but the accents, banter and witty dialogue do come fast and hard and the subs give you a hand in being let in on the fun!",1440547200,10,902,4.448484848484848
