8282199,5,B001B8G44G,"Very enjoyable story of Christmas past: a tragedy and triumph in one.  Accurately tells the story of Herman Schuenemann and his ship the Rouse Simmons, ""the Christmas Tree Ship"" of 1912.  Well told and well made, with a little repetition due to the modern format of TV documentaries with commercials; i.e., after the commercial, summarize all that happens before the commercial.",1226361600,5,378,5.180327868852459
