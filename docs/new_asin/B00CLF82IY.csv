Thank you.",1377216000,,234,4.348837209302325

Scenes are astonishing beauty from photo stills, film footage, and current sights all mingled with interviews of historians and experts on the Hudson River Valley. Of course, the expertise of Bill Moyers questioning and digging makes this pair of shows come alive. It is the amazing story of a river that runs two ways. Salt and fresh water flows side by side. The river has a history of its own, as intriguing as the continent and now the country through which it flows. Content demands the use of multiple superlatives, that good.

SUBTITLES available for both feature-length episodes.
1 STORIES FROM THE HUDSON:
Hudson River Valley painters and writers show us glimpses of its beauty and history. The Hudson (aka ""Lordly"" ""Mighty"" ""Silver"" ""North"") River is a poetic part of America. It is 315 miles long and arguably the beginning of the Great American Hope. West Point is an important part of the Hudson covered with today's and history's significance. Washington Irving's ""Sleepy Hollow"" of the Hudson Valley; ""Ichabod Crane""; ""Rip Van Winkle""; and the Hudson River School of Art is addressed with dozens of paintings displayed. Troy, NY, the manufacturing-industrial center, had its impact.

2 THE FIGHT TO SAVE THE RIVER:
The beautiful Hudson is an ugly mess (in places) and needs cleaned. How? Who? When? Moyers talks with all types of people (fishermen, historians, sailors, biologists, CEOs, environmentalists, farmers, kids) collecting ideas and stories of the Hudson River's decay and the long journey needed to complete the saving of it. Henry Hudson's ship ""Half Moon"" (replica) is boarded to take a look at the river namesake just as the explorer did in 1609. Wonderful river days are remembered through story and film, as well as the mid 20th Century pollution.

One of the best documentaries on rivers I have ever viewed.
