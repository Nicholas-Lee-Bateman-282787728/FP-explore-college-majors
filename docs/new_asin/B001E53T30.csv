3545893,5,B001E53T30,"""I am going to talk of controversial things. I make no apology for this.""

So began Ronald Reagan's first public address to the nation in the Autumn of 1964. So was the nature of the man: forthright, self-assured and honest to a fault. In 1964, Ronald Reagan (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Face-of-Evil-Reagan-s-War-in-Word-and-Deed/dp/B0007Q3SII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Face of Evil: Reagan's War in Word and Deed</a>) was merely an actor; and 16 years later, on January 14, 1980, he was on the set of Firing Line - only months from becoming America's 40th president - meeting with the host, William F. Buckley (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reagan-I-Knew/dp/0465009263/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reagan I Knew</a>), for one of the most stimulating and enchanting hours of television to date.

Hard as it is to believe, there was a time when Ronald Reagan was best addressed as ""Governor Reagan."" But there was such a time when Governor Ronald Reagan's ongoing candidacy for the US presidency was thought immeasurably improbable; a time when the farsighted minds and furrowed brows at the Republican National Committee counted him out by counting in fours - each presidential electoral term.

With the self-afflicted bloodbath of the Nixon Administration only six years behind them, Republican realists confessed a probable defeat in 1980, and admitted the Democratic National Committee would virtually own the White House for at least one full generation. The Republican talking points were simple and defeatist: it's a time of transition, we're rebuilding our party, and so on.... Governor Reagan, the Republican candidate for the White House during the 1979-1980 election cycle would, of course, have none of it; and so suggested his confident smile.

In January of 1980, William F. Buckley extended an invitation to candidate Reagan to appear on his weekly current affairs programme, 'Firing Line.' Some of the very best repartee of the middle to late 20th century occurred on the set of Warren Steibel's creation. Buckley was always brilliant, always entertaining; but in his wisdom, he made the program, and the guests who appeared on his program, if not always brilliant in his reflecting illumination, at least entertaining.

This meeting of minds was to be of a benefit for both participants, as it was not a secret that William F. Buckley would have awoken rather gleefully to understand that the Carter Administration had been truncated at the end of term one. And though Mr. Buckley's interview is not of the confrontational kind to which we're accustomed, it is, I think, still of some value to witness a conversation between two gentlemen of similar cordial customs.

Host Buckley makes a further change to his interviewing technique by tossing out the prosaic Q&A style of questioning and, instead, posing questions to a PRESIDENT Reagan, assuming he's already arrived at his rendezvous with destiny.

The first question asked by Buckley is a hot one. It deals with race, rioting, and police engagement. It is all a supposition, and all occurring in the city of Detroit. Asks Mr. Buckley: ""In such a case, what would you be apt to do, Mr. President?""

Without a pause, Reagan answers: ""Well, I would be inclined to say that [this issue] was a problem for the local authorities in Detroit...""

And there, without equivocation, is the Reagan we know. Not quoting Article 10, from Bill of Rights, but understanding its practical implications and knowing the value of the originalist's intent. While it's important to have a president who knows his Bills, his Constitution, his Declaration, his Doctrine, his Proclamation and his Pledge, it's twice as nice to have a president who knows what those documents mean, and how to make use of their value in a contemporary USA.

Candidate Reagan then goes on to explain that Federal Government involvement - when not required; when not requested - can be as big a problem as when Federal Government is required and not received: a sentiment found living in the marrow of his conservative philosophy; and one that found voice very early in his political transformation.

The finest point of Buckley's interview with Reagan is a question that seems drawn from a parallel universe only slightly ahead of our own. It is an hypothetical posed to the presumed President Reagan, and a near perfect primer for term number one:

WFB:  Mr. President, yesterday a union of postal employees went on a nationwide strike. Now I know you well enough to know that your instinctive answer would be ""How can you tell""?"" [Laughter] Having got past that, what would be your official policy toward a strike by a federal and municipal employees?

REAGAN:  I have thought for a long time that by law they should not be allowed to strike. Government is not the same as private business. Government cannot close down the assembly line, and isn't it significant that when government employees first began to unionize, and they had the support of organized labor but then organized labor supported them only on the condition that their unions would contain a no-strike clause. The public employees should not be allowed to strike. Movement can't close down.

Eights months after the authentically-elected President Reagan took the Oath of Office, the union of air traffic controllers went out on strike, breaching their own contract strictures, and engaging in an illegal strike of public employees. True to his word - true to his beliefs - President Reagan did just what he said he would do: he demanded the striking employees return to work; when they refused, he fired the lot.

The tumult created by this bold (and some accused, reckless) move was soon to be named mere classic Reagan. Whether friend of foe to the Administration, he was a man who could be trusted to keep his word. In a city replete with last minute, under-the-table glad-handing and deal-making, Reagan became known for resolutely standing by that which he said and knew to be true.

His smile abounds throughout the program; and one can easily see that this man is truly enjoying himself. He is confident as ever; a man wholly prepped for the eight-year task that will soon be at hand. He is a former Democrat whose rightward reformation matches a change that is currently taking place throughout much of the country. He is, at times, gravely serious; at other times, light-hearted and jovial. Throughout, he is disarmingly affable and always confident; with the principles of conservatism sewn deep into the fabric of his governing tradition.

Into the lungs of conservatism new life was drawn; and for every rightward movement, the corresponding Left moved accordingly. Ronald Reagan was the man who changed the political environment from the very moment he accepted the Oath of the Office. Today, he is marked by both Republicans and Democrats for his steady stewardship as Commander-in-Chief, and for his undying faith in the American people and the American spirit.

Thirty years have past and four presidents have come and gone. Today, Democrat President Barack Obama looks to Republican President Reagan for inspiration as well as instruction; and he seems to be a rather precocious student:

""I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. I think they felt like with all the excesses of the 1960s and 1970s...government had grown and grown but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating. I think...he just tapped into what people were already feeling, which was 'we want clarity we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.'""

In 1980, Ronald Reagan was in excellent form, and William Buckley, Jr. was the right man to engage him. With both men now gone, this edition of Firing Line makes a fascinating, engaging, and inspiring remembrance of the two; a DVD that should start a collection of 20th century icons.

3545894,5,B001E53T30,"William F. Buckley Jr. does an excellent job of asking then Former CA Gov. Reagan's response to a series of hypothetical issues that might come up if he were President. For 50 minutes Buckley covers issues across the board from economic policy discussions on inflation, bonds, and ways to strengthen the value of the dollar to how a President Reagan would handle a hypothetical strike of Postal Workers, a hypothetical which later became reality with the 1981 PATCO Strike.

Reagan gives real,substantive answers which is something you did not see in the recent 2008 election debates. During the primary debates candidates were forced to respond to petty issues with yes or no answers and in one ridiculous case, a show of hands. In this DVD you are left knowing Exactly where Reagan stands on the issues. There is no ""I meant it this way"" or any other BS excuse you hear from current political leaders(Republicans and Democrats).

If the GOP wants to break free of the Bush legacy and take the reign of governing again it would be in their best interest to start fielding candidates like President Reagan and for their Congressional members to start acting like Republicans instead of being closet Democrats.",1230163200,15,1209,4.921568627450981
3545905,5,B001E53T30,"Reagan holds-up well, to Buckley's tough questioning.  It goes far in disproving the naysayers' unrelenting assertion that without his ""handlers,"" Reagan was a deer in the headlights; he clearly spoke a good game when it came to free-market economics and individual liberty.",1388016000,,274,5.523809523809524
3545906,5,B001E53T30,"Buckley's debate/interview skill and Reagan's leadership and knowledge. Need we say more. Awesome show, highly recommended. Yes, I am bias being a BIG Reagan fan.",1377734400,3,162,5.52
3545907,1,B001E53T30,"First, as a Liberal, there are a lot of things I respected and loved about William F. Buckley Jr., not the least of which was his Firing Line program, and his sense of decency, fair play, and the integrity with which he ran that show.  There was no fear about going up against opposition individuals or groups, even when he loses the debate he is marvelous and quintessentially American.  No conservative announcer of today would ever do what Buckley did fearlessly, let the American form of government work.  WFBJr, never shouted down someone on his show, or called them names of referred to the other side as having a mental disorder.

HOWEVER, with the advent of Ronald Reagan, the Conservative movement migrated to the Newt Gingrich admirers of the fascist
form of government and news.  This program is the seed of that, and so as much as I'd like to give it 5/5 for Buckley, I have to give it a 1/5 for allowing himself to be used like this, and to Ronald Reagan for allowing himself to be hired as an actor to play President, more than he actually governed.  This was Ronald Reagan's Presidential test drive, and WFB Jr. was his shock absorbers.

Buckley sets the context of Reagan glossing over his lackluster performance as Governor of California, but instead claiming it as a great plus, against most of the attacks on him for being too old ... he was 70 when he took office in 1981, and we later found out that Ronald Reagan had Alzheimer's disease.  This clearly indicated that he was a figurehead for an almost criminal GOP organization that took over the American government after him, found to be selling arms to Iran, and as well supplying arms and advisors to the people who were murdering nationalists and innocents in El Salvador and Nicaragua.  Nicaragua has since put Daniel Ortega whose disappearance Reagan no doubt would have supported.

So, the ""interview"" is a series of spoon-fed questions to which it is clear that  Mr. Reagan has been rehearsed and coached 8 ways from Sunday.  Hitting the main GOP talking points, local authority, bash the Federal government.  Buckley leads the old donkey Reagan through his paces like Dobbs in Treasure of Sierra Madre led his pack burros, it is shameful, and you can see the fear in Reagan's face that he is going to flubb his lines as his eyes keep darting around the room.

Then the subject of a hypothetical invasion of Eastern Europe by the USSR. Reagan ironically talks about an American presence in Afghanistan, which was much of the problem with blowback later on.  We put in nasty folks like Osama bin Laden, drive the Soviets out, and then we left that country to fester in corruption, poverty and war.  But as a hypothetical it all sounded so clean and nice.

Then Reagan bashes the Carter administration for ""not making it plain that the USSR runs the risk of war if they continue with expansionism and imperialism.  This is as we are murdering civilians all over South and Central America ... and by the way there was not a hint or a shred of evidence that the USSR even considered moving into Yugoslavia, which fell apart into wars of ethnic cleansing due to no strong central government.

Reagan is all about lines like ""I know the President [Carter] has just discovered that the Soviet Union cannot be trusted"" ... that reflect naivety on the part of Carter and wisdom on the part of Reagan ... watching this and imagining that the American people swallowed this nonsense is difficult.  Carter was blindsided on a debate asked if we would defend Yugoslavia in the case of a Soviet attack .. to which he foolishly answered at all ... but he said, no.  It was a mistake, but inputing Reagan with wisdom because he pointed the mistake out some time later is an even worse mistake.  So, out of this mistake the GOP takes the obvious platform stand that they will not tell adversaries what we will not do ... a very sensible thing to do, but a straw argument that in fact we were doing that - which we were not really.  The question was vexing because part of the US being a Republic/Democracy means that the people need to be informed, and these questions arise from that.  Well, if we do not make comments about what American policy is, then the people have no way to do their jobs and vote, or express their preferences ... which has led right up to today where the public is kept in the dark totally and lied to regularly - based just on this idea.

I can go through this entire sickening video and dissect Reagan's answers and what they led to, but you get the idea. Either you are considering my words, or you are getting mad and formulating a nasty response to someone who would dare criticize the Republican's favorite myth, so I'll end my review here.  This is very good for a historical record ... IF you follow it up with the realities of what happened subsequently and analyze how the radical wing of the Republican party has changed politics and America for the worse.  Reagan literally did ""turn the bull loose"".",1377043200,,5001,4.596175478065242

3545910,5,B001E53T30,"It was informative and adds to my understanding of what Ronald Reagan, the candidate was about. I particularly enjoyed the eay that Buckley set the stage for his questions by making it a scenario in which Reagan is, ""Mr. President"".

3545911,5,B001E53T30,"During the course of the 2012 national election season, I found I needed this.

A good dose of excellent interviewing techniques from William F. Buckley, with one of the very best interviews of all time, and an hour of listening to one of the greatest American Presidents of all time - Ronald Reagan. I recommend it.

Interestingly, listening to then-Governor Reagan's responses (it became clear that the issues today were the same as they were all of those years ago when Reagan eventually won over Mr. Carter).

Whether you're a political conservative of not, this is excellent in all aspects. - Prof Michael Haller",1358121600,2,617,4.913461538461538
3545912,5,B001E53T30,"In January 1980 presidential candidate Ronald Reagan appeared on William F. Buckley's ""Firing Line.""  In this episode, Buckley posed several hypothetical situations to Reagan as if he had already been inaugurated.  Characteristically, Reagan emphasized the Constitution and local solutions rather than federal solutions to issues.  The Gipper came across as relaxed and knowledgeable on the issues the two discussed such as the Soviet threat, peace through strength, inflation, energy, taxes, and the First Amendment.  Toward the end of the show a reporter asked him about the age issue and the upcoming fight for the Republican nomination.  This episode of ""Firing Line"" is a good snapshot of Ronald Reagan at the beginning of the year in which he would be elected president.",1349913600,,776,5.380165289256198

3545914,5,B001E53T30,"Buckley calculatedly asks Reagan challenging questions in this interview, no soft balls, but Reagan displays his grasp of history and real world solutions, in giving great answers consistent with conservative ideas, as he refined them. Anyone who has read Reagan's writings and transcripts of his radio broadcasts from long before he ran for any office, knows how egregious the lies are from the left about his mentality. They mistake an ability to explain concepts in simple terms to an inability to conceptualize difficult problems -- such as the solution to end the cold war by driving the Soviet economy into the ground, that he explained in detail many years before running for President. That simple idea, that the New York Times and its acolytes ridiculed up until the very year it succeeded, ended the Soviet Union. But this program is a chance to see him answer difficult hypothetical questions on the fly with elegant solutions that would really work -- as many of them did after he became President.",1280188800,3,1010,4.982248520710059

Sometimes surprising: When asked by Mr. Buckley about when the Federal Government would get involved in a racial issue, Reagan replied that if there were a clear usurpation of a person's civil rights, he would send Federal Authority to defend those rights even to the point of a bayonet.
