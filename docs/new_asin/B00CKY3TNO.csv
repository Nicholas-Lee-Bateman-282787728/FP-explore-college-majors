I definitely couldn't follow all the developments, even though I did read the plot on Wikipedia as well. But in this case, my befuddlement with the story was not a desaster: Over 2:40 hours, the film delighted me with a lot of great photography with many lush outdoor scenes, around five energetic dance numbers in train stations and rice fields and lots of baby colours. Unlike so many Bollywood movies, there is no faux glitz in this Telugu production - the families are well off, but they don't behave like nouveaux-riches Mumbaiwallahs and their homes seem generous, but real, not outlandish.

In a way, Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu felt like a modernized, south-indianized Hum Aapke Hain Koun: lots of harmonious family action with dinners, celebrations and happy togetherness until it gets serious in the very last reels. SVSC feels especially fluffy, and compared to other South Indian films there is little to none violence and offending vulgarity.

At times the acting felt, well, acted and not natural, especially as voices come from a re-recording in a studio and sound detached. There seemed to be no natural flow and actors without dialog seemed to simply stand around and wait till they had another line. This didn't disturb me much in this case though. Compared to other South Indian films there is relatively little speech, but lots of atmospheric imagery without talking; so your eyes won't be glued to subtitles throughout. I found the background score too rich and overpowering; the dance songs sounded melodious, but hardly memorable.

Venkatesh - who looks like an experienced woodcutter, a man in his best years - has charisma, but seems wrongly cast as a sulking unmarried twen and wayward drama queen. The female leads appear pretty and natural and light up the screen, especially Anjali. Generally the characterizations are light and for easy consumption, not with lots of depths and drama.

My Bluray bought in India had a slightly dark, yet oversaturated picture and no extras whatsoever.",1397606400,,2108,5.083815028901734
8582840,5,B00CKY3TNO,This could be watched with the whole family. Songs are nice. Enjoyed second time more than first. As such there is no story in the movie except how a family bonded together. I would recommed wath with your family and you would enjoy more.,1382659200,,238,4.431818181818182
8582841,1,B00CKY3TNO,"I was sent a replacement disk when i complained that i got a normal DVD instead of Blu-ray. The replacement disk is again a normal DVD. Just for gigs i tried playing it on my DVD player ( it does not have Blu-ray support) , this is even playing on my DVD player. This is not a BLU-RAY disk. I am really not sure what exactly is the confusion here, expecting to pay 19.99 for a normal DVD seems to be ridiculous. IF THIS IS JUST A NORMAL DVD , PLEASE UPDATE THE WEBSITE DESCRIPTION AND STOP MISLEADING PEOPLE AND WASTING THEIR TIME. I expect a lot better than this from Amazon.com atleast when the seller is Amazon itself  !!!!!. Issues like these will only make people think twice before ordering from Amazon !!.",1371168000,2,712,4.313432835820896
