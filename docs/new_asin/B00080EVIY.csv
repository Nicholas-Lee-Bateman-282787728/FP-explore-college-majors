that has been beautifully portrayed.",1209340800,2,89,5.0
8054947,5,B00080EVIY,This is a touching story of how a woman was willing and able to help two gay men find family life and raise their children.  It points out the true fact that love is the most important element in any family and in any parental invovlment--paternally or maternally.,1171670400,2,264,4.5
8054948,4,B00080EVIY,"This is not a standard fictional movie, although it sort of looks like one, or a movie ""based on actual events.""  This is a documentary, so be warned it isn't your standard gay romantic comedy.

Basically a gay couple work with a surrogate mother to have a child that is biologically related to them.  This turns out to be a test of their relationship, a test of their beliefs, and a test of their will to create a family in the way they wish.  Nothing is easy, but this turns into a real trial.

I'm a cynic.  It takes a lot to choke me up, but this film did it.  It has some slow places, but it's moving and interesting overall, and the drama is real.  Recommended for it's integrity, meaning, and allowing the viewer inside the hearts and minds of three people on a heart-wrenching journey.",1167177600,2,793,4.346938775510204
8054949,5,B00080EVIY,"Paternal Instinct is a warm, beautiful film that is so incredibly touching.  The documentary is just so REAL and emotionally raw, that you can't help but be deeply moved.  I highly recommend this film to everyone.  Parents should watch it with their children, friends should watch it together, and then speak openly and candidly about how the documentary made them feel, and think.  The support network that these two men have, through their own families as well as their extended New York City families is so inspirational.  Two men, a warm, beautiful and loving surrogate with a family of her own that supports her completely.  It is definitive proof that there is no such thing as a ""traditional"" family in this day and age.  This is a film that breaks down barriers, and it can bring people together.  I give Paternal Instinct a thumbs-up, A+++++, a must-see film!!  Anyone that does not see this documentary will miss out on a rare opportunity to take an adventure with the people involved.  Wonderful film - well done!!  I applaud the people behind the cameras as well as those in front of the cameras.
*Note* Have a box if tissues nearby when you watch this film, because the tears will flow, I promise!",1141948800,6,1210,4.714285714285714
8054950,5,B00080EVIY,"I think the most extraordinary feat of the film Paternal Instinct is that it feels like a fiction film. It is funny, entertaining, heartwarming and mind expanding. However, stop for a moment and wonder how the filmmaker got that close to his subjects, so that they trusted him to be there with their most private and intimate moments. We are fortunate and privileged to be given such a close-up view of peoples' lives, and what extraordinary lives they are!!

I love this film. I also think that the additional feature of the interview with Harry Hay, is one of the most important pieces of footage I have seen in years. All people should see this thought provoking, historic and memorable interview.

Buy this DVD, it is worth owning!!",1120003200,5,736,4.7421875
8054951,5,B00080EVIY,"This is a documentary that doesn't seem like a documentary.

I think the brilliance of this film is the ability of Murray Nossel to tell a beautiful story -- a story that will make you cry.  To travel with these two men (plus one witch) on their heartrending many year path to having a baby is a trip into the most private and sacred of one's life.  So many feelings happened to me as I watched -- laughter, sadness, hope, great relief (and a final surprise).

I also loved watching the acceptance and pride of Mark and Eric's extended families toward this quest for this new life.  I think this is a perfect film for every father in every family.",1119830400,5,647,4.358333333333333
8054952,4,B00080EVIY,"Mark and Erik are 30-something urban New York gay couple, together 10 years, who decide to follow their ""Paternal Instinct"" (2004) and have a child.  After discussing and deciding against adoption, they agree that they want to find an agreeable surrogate mother, and place an ad on the internet.  Their search results in meeting Wen, a single mom  living in Maine, who hits it off well with them.  They agree on a surrogate fee of $13,000 (about average for the area and times), and plan the pregnancy through artificial insemmination.  Unfortunately, their first conception results in a miscarriage, and almost a year passes with unsuccessful attempts to try again.  They begin to wonder if this might be a ""sign"" that this wasn't meant to be, or perhaps they had dismissed the idea of adoption too quickly.

Eventually, they are successful, and the documentary shows the days leading up to the home birthing (in a plastic kiddie pool in one of the rooms of Wen's home, with both ""gay daddies"" present as well as a midwife and Wen's young teen son.)  But the greater strength of this documentary is exploring the discussions, apprehensions, planning and priorities of the couple, as well as their interactions with friends and family.  Should be required viewing for any same-sex couple thinking of having a child.

DVD extras include deleted and bonus scenes, the couple's home movies with their daughter, and a short interview with pioneering gay activist Harry Hay.",1119484800,8,1469,4.983606557377049
8054953,5,B00080EVIY,"Paternal Instinct is a heartfelt documentary about two gay men's attempt(s) to have a biological child with a surrogate mother. Wen, the surrogate they choose, is a practicing witch, married with a teenage son of her own. The movie follows the lives of these 3 people with seemingly unlimited access, which offers a fascinating glimpse into a situation this straight man could never imagine! But beyond the curiosity aspect, what stayed with me after seeing this film was its humanity and how three people embarked on a journey full of obstacles to create a new life. After everything they go through and all their efforts, it's impossible to think that their child will not grow up in a loving household. See this film, it will change your perspective on family!",1119484800,4,763,4.876923076923077
