8185905,1,B0001CNRTI,"This DVD looks great but don't let it fool you.  First of all, both shows were in Chinese.  The DVD ""Language"" section says it is in English but it's not.  There are English subtitles, but I like to watch a movie, not read it.  ""The Invincible Fighter"" sounds like it is a documentary about the life of Jackie Chan.  Instead it is clips from his early movies. The show ""Jackie Chan's Crime Force"" doesn't even have Jackie Chan in it.  Well, maybe it does at the end... I kept it on for about an hour and when he didn't come on, and I got fed up with ""reading"" my movie, I turned it off.  If you speak Chinese, and aren't a Jackie Chan fan, this DVD might just entertain you.  But I doubt it.",1183939200,,691,4.104477611940299
8185906,2,B0001CNRTI,"Jackie Chan's Invinvible Crime Force....

One, Jackie Chan has a small and uncreditted bit in the film.

Two, the ""crime Force"" isn't -- they're escaped POW's in a WWII story out to destroy a weapons plant...

It's really Brigitte Lin and Sally Yeh's picture, and it's horribly dubbed, the transfer isn't any good, and the ""score"" is ripped from half a dozen other pictures -- I liked the wordless choir lift from Once Upon a Time In The West, myself....

Bad enough that it's kind of entertaining.

Originally titled ""GOlden Queen's Amazons""

Invincible Fighter is a video compilation of great moments from some of his early films.. fine, except that it's plainly been mastered badly from a VHS original, the image is panned and scanned and the burned in subtitles run off the edges fo the frame. This package would be overpriced at a dollar.",1112659200,3,843,4.779310344827586
