1644866,2,B00005Q5K3,"I however found it to be boring almost to the point of self mutilation. This DVD basically goes over little known facts about confederate things (from uniforms, to belt buckles, to knives, to guns, to flags, etc.) Strangly I did actually learn a lot from it. I just was in total agony wondering why in sodding heck I would care about a sodding conferderate belt buckle...Anyhow, like I said, I learned a lot of detailed facts and was severely bored while doing so. I will not care to watch it again.",1182124800,3,499,4.4945054945054945
1644867,3,B00005Q5K3,"Based on the title and editorial provided, I thought this compilation was about the Southern Confederacy, it was not what I expected.  Ripper is exactly correct, the oration is conducted by a man wearing a Union uniform.  He does not speak as a Southerner would.  The main topics are for the most part about Union stories told from a Union perspective, and they contain much more detailed Union factual accounts.  Southern factual accounts are side-notes in this compilation.  For example, General Lee's and General Jackson's horses are mentioned in one Section titled ""War Horses"", while many Union officers and their horses are depicted gallantly and in revere.

I would hope this was not intentional patronization to aid the sale of a good general civil war history 'Album' titled ""...Confederate Minutes.""  As Southerners, we are interested in our specific history, marketers know this and it is good marketing, however marketing is not always sincere and genuine.  The Battle Flag depicted in glory should have been a clue, I don't see the Flag of the Confederacy.  This piece would be more aptly titled ""Civil War Minutes"" or even ""Union Minutes.""  The title is true in the literal sense that this compilation really does have only ""Minutes"" about the Southern Confederacy, this is not a compilation of Confederate minutes.",1176508800,5,1329,5.111111111111111
1644868,3,B00005Q5K3,"I bought this version as I am a part time lover of Confederate history.  I thought that this set being supposedly focused on the Confederate side would be nice since usually the Confederate side gets slighted.

I was annoyed that the commentator for the Confederate DVD set chose a union uniform to wear while presenting this.  Ok not that big a deal but unexpected.  While this dvd does cover alot of non-mainstream items it always seemed to keep bringing up the union side.  Examples...  A great deal of time was spent on union soldiers experiences and letters, the ""drums of war"" centered almost exclusively on union drummers, almost always the Confederate discussion was countered with union betterment.  (One exception that comes to mind was the knife discussio)etc .etc..

It also seemed that most Confederate viewpoints and discussions were centered on the low points or lost battles.

So..  I will leave it at that and move on.  Lets simply say it was not what I expected (whether that was my fault for expecting to much or not).  There are good",1113609600,47,1053,4.82122905027933
1644869,5,B00005Q5K3,"Finally, in this day of PC pablum, someone tells the REAL history of the Confederate soldier! You'll learn little-known facts about the major players, including General Lee of course, but more importantly, this set focuses heavily on the average man in the ranks and why he chose to fight. Daily camp life gets attention as well as what the soldier wore and what equipment he used. The real reasons and motivations for fighting are explored and what life was like after the war when men had to go home in defeat to often-devastated homes. Highly recommend! It's a must for serious students of the war and anyone who wants an authentic look at the period.",1099958400,12,654,4.695652173913044
1644870,5,B00005Q5K3,"Continuing his great series of bringing the Civil War closer to home, Michael Kraus is back with this very informative 2-disc set featuring three hours of material.  This set doesn't waste time with boring introduction or biographies on key leaders such as Lee or Jackson which I found very refreshing.  Instead, Kraus gets straight to the point on featuring interesting everyday subjects such as fighting knives, musket tools, letters and ammunition.  Though these subjects common to the everyday soldier are just a piece of this fine production.  Kraus digs deep with rare and often overlooked subject matter such as clothing details, grave markers, Morgan's Raiders, French Leave, housewifes and warhorses.  In appreciation and awe, Kraus is always careful in not having his actors in his production wearing 'farb' clothing which definately adds a true flavor to this segment.
I enjoyed viewing the fine close-up views on a track featuring information regarding a Confederate General's coat.  Kraus features an actual coat worn by an officer and allows the camera to zoom in on the coat itself to see the fine stitching and elaborate details which could be very helpful for reenactors looking for detail often not seen in books.  Kraus brings actual period items to life in this production and the camera views are very crisp which helps define the character of the item and also the individual that may have used them during the war.
I have all of Michael Kraus' material on DVD and was not disappointed in this Confederate based presentation.  For those looking for information regarding a battle or popular figures this DVD set is not for you.  I found this production completely informative and probably wouldn't recommend it for someone who doesn't have a general knowledge of the war or it's concepts. It may not have the quality of production that would be seen on a history channel but far exceeds anything done on television as it's not vague or bland. I can't wait for the next Kraus  production and highly recommend this set! 5 STARS!!!!!",1035504000,54,2052,5.008823529411765
1644871,1,B00005Q5K3,"After sitting through this series, I was almost at a loss of words for how genuinly bad it was. The idea for the series isn't a bad one, but the absolute lack of quality pushes me away...
Michael Kraus is the host, and I can say that he did a pretty good job. He looks like a real person who actually cares about the civil war, and he actually cares about what he is talking about. Kraus obviously didn't film, direct, or edit this series, so there is nothing I can hold against him.
Unfortunatly, the numerous bad aspects outweigh the good aspects ten fold. ...
Take your money and buy absolutly any other Civil War dvd/video you can find. I guaruntee that whatever you buy, will be much, much better than Civil War Minutes. ...",1023148800,14,729,4.367647058823529
1644872,2,B00005Q5K3,"The Civil War Minutes presents 3 hours of topics. It discusses such topics as a soldier's knapsack or backpack as we call it now. The host will read various letters written by soldiers. The host makes a good presentation of the other subjects as well. The subjects are interesting. The period music is good.
But the production of the series does not seem professional. There are times when the background noise, such as screams, will drown the presentation the host is trying to present.
After viewing the four-part series I feel disappointment. I feel that I did not get much for my purchase. Personally I could have gotten as much information by spending the day at a Civil War museum and would have been better entertained.",1013126400,9,726,4.76984126984127
1644873,3,B00005Q5K3,"This DVD is a perfect addition for anyone that is learning about the Civil War in general.  Michael Kraus is very informative and his forward approach to presenting the details of soldier life, personal letters and lifestyle is a welcomed sight.  His concise details are backed by many true stories.  Important items to the everyday soldier such as a canteens, muskets and clothing are presented with historical facts and are often linked to an individual that actually used them.
This DVD set is perfect for those new at learning or trying to get a rounded view of soldier life and general information regarding the war. For the experienced reenactor or historian it may be too general.  Though I would have to admit that even a historian can learn about a particular soldier from a letter or get new insight from the material.
The presentation or filming is sometimes lacking in quality as lighting and sound quality isn't the best at times.  The sounds effects are interesting though sometimes overdone.  Sometimes the effects overshadow the narration and make it harder to hear. I do have to give credit to the music used as it captured the era and was presented well.",1013040000,15,1172,4.835
1644874,5,B00005Q5K3,"Ken Burns gave us the ""Civil War"" series.  Though some photo sequences did not accurately represent the story properly, it did provided us with a good overview of the events that transpired between the years 1859 through 1865.  Ted Turner gave the movie ""Gettysburg"", which brought the large scale battle arena to the big screen.  The History Channel gave us ""Civil War Journal"", giving good detail to individuals, regiments, and the battles fought.
Now Inecom Entertainment has produced the next level of presenting the historical fine details of the Civil War.  The accoutrements of the individual foot soldier, the letters they wrote home about the hardships they endured during the war, many interesting artifacts of Civil War period, and a host of other details that are never included in the big productions.  This four volume video series does more to fill in the gaps than anything else I know of.
As a reenactor with the 123rd NYV, I have a special appreciation for this, the down and dirty as I like to call it.  Michael Kraus, also a living historian and reenactor, presents this material in a way that gives life to what is normally just museum artifacts.  I would recommend to everyone who wants that next level of understanding of that great conflict that shaped our nation to view this series.",1011139200,8,1308,4.864864864864865
1644875,1,B00005Q5K3,"Watching this DVD series was a huge disappointment. I walked into it expecting everything the packaging had promised, and left with a bitter feeling like I [wasted my money.] There are some good aspects of this series, but unfortunately, it's buried under hours of amateur quality video, and cheesy sound effects.
The host seems to be extremely knowledgeable, and some of the things he brings up are very interesting, but little of it is worth the price you must pay to view it.
The biggest disappointment wasn't the host, but instead, the production value of the video. I can't comprehend anyone actually releasing, and selling video of this quality. The sound was equally as disappointing. It seemed to be hours of splats, screams, and other ""B"" movie effects. Sometimes the amateurish sound effects actually obscure what the host is saying.
There were some good points in this series and it wasn't a total waste, but overall, it could be much, much better. The first time I watched it, I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes.  For me, there was just too much garbage to wade through in order to get to the good stuff.",1010016000,12,1125,4.769230769230769

7949774,2,B00005Q5K3,"Next time i will read the product discription carefully this is not what i expected. I'm really not worried about what kind of material the flags were made out of or what the canteens were made of. I thought this would be about the battles they fought what they did right or wrong or what they could have changed during the battle, not about how many chickens were stolen. I would have been very upset if i paied [.35.99..] for this but at 4.99 plus shipping well i did learn a few things.

7949775,5,B00005Q5K3,"As a subscriber to North & South magazine, I had seen the ads for Civil War Minutes for quite some time. I just figured it was one of those independetly-produced, low-budget Civil War programs with some information I already knew. Honestly, I never spent a lot of time researching what it was really about. In any case, I had no plans to buy the program.

But then, I found the Union Minutes program at a thrift shop. It was under $7, so I went ahead and bought it. These programs are EXCELLENT. Especially as nothing else in American history-and maybe history, period- perpetually generates so much controversy, debate, misunderstanding and politically-charged, revisionist history as the American Civil War. Rather than wade into the issues of what the war was about, CWM steers clear of all that and just looks at the hardware of the war- soldiers' weapons, uniforms, flags, etc. Powerful stories are told in the reading of soldiers' letters and diaries. Reenactors perform selections of the songs the men enjoyed while in camp. I've done some reenacting before and watching these programs makes me feel like putting on the ""blue suit"" once again.

I hate to use the word ""complain"" but the only issues I have with these programs are 1) the use of footage from D.W. Griffith's disgraceful ""Birth of a Nation"" film when talking about combat, etc. But I realize, of course, that the producers were unable to afford the royalty fees for scenes from modern movies like ""Glory"" or ""Gods & Generals."" Had I been the one to produce CWM, I would have used reenactor footage or a cheesy Civil War film before resorting to ""Birth of a Nation."" But that's just me.

My other issue is the same one others have raised here- using a Union reenactor to talk about Confederate history. I'm not neo-Confederate, so I don't take offense to this, but I think it would have been a lot more authentic for, at best, to have a southerner do the narration and commentary; or have Mr. Krauss appear as a Confederate soldier. But I'm glad he didn't, particularly if he tried to use a fake southern accent. I think it would have been best to dress as a civilian from the period.

In the long run these issues are minor at best and a small price to pay for this series. It's a great teaching tool for the classroom and it really makes history come alive.",1280275200,,2329,4.631961259079903
7949776,4,B00005Q5K3,"I'm from Texas and I did not think this documentary was slanted to the Union. The presenter, was respectful to the Confederate topics. More than likely he was dressed in a Union uniform because they were filming the Union version also. He was very knowledgeable. For the $8 I paid I got a brand new set of DVDs with 3 hrs. of documentary. If you like looking at Civil War relics and want more in depth information than you may like this set.",1216080000,,441,4.325301204819277
7949777,4,B00005Q5K3,"It is a very interesting DVD Set, and had many detailed facts (like about ammunition and weaponry of both sides), but I think it did not focus on the Confederate viewpoint as much as it could have. It was about 50/50 I think. It was still much better than most other DVD's. Thanks.",1210723200,,281,4.320754716981132
7949778,1,B00005Q5K3,"The concept behind the Civil War Minutes video series is a great one; take little known facts about the Civil War and have an expert explain them in short segments.  Each segment would be able to stand alone, but the DVD could be watched in a single sitting if the viewer wanted to.  With a noted historian like Michael Kraus providing the stories and acting as the face of the series it should be a no-brianer.

It's safe to say that the best laid plans of mice, men and documentary producers often go awry.  These two discs, one about the Union and one about the Confederacy, reminded me of the educational films that we used to get in junior high school when the teacher wasn't prepared for class.  The production values on the DVDs is not much better than you could do at home with a high end digital recorder.  There are many times when Michael Kraus nearly washes out of the video and the picture he's superimposed over dominates the scene.  Plus, the producers thought that putting Kraus in military uniform would somehow make him look more like an authority.  Instead it made him look uncomfortable.

The highlight of this set is Michael Kraus.  He clearly is an expert on the Civil War and has a deep passion about that time in history.  I found almost every segment to be informative and interesting to listen to.  Kraus must have know how bad this series was destined to be because he worked hard to make what he was doing stand out.

I have to recommend that you take a pass on the Civil War Minutes.  The information is good, but the production values make it difficult to watch.",1191542400,5,1592,4.482638888888889
