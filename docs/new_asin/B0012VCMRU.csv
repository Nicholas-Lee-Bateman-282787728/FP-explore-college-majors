3098840,4,B0012VCMRU,"Always loved Watched My Chops, got me through a whole summer off uni!

If you haven't seen this amazing series just yet, make sure you pick this boxset up. Excellent value, great product.

The only down sides are picture quality, not the greatest but still very watchable and the fact that all the episodes are jumbled up and not in order.

This is a must buy and region free (possibly why the image quality isn't as good as an English dvd.)",1301875200,,441,4.419753086419753
3098841,5,B0012VCMRU,"Over here in England Corneil & Bernie was called Watch my chops. Why the name was changed i don't know but when 13 episodes were released back in 2003 (i think) i got it straight away!
Last year i was puzzled why no more episodes were released and it was only when i looked it up on wiki that i found out the programs title had been changed,then i found out that all 52 episodes had been released on 2 discs!!
Eeeek!!!
52 episodes? Great googally moogally!
This cartoon is without doubt one of the funniest ive ever seen. Its a simple premise-
Corneil is a talking and very intelligent dog & Bernie is his dogsitter & the only one who knows his secret!
As i said before,there are 52 episodes & they'll keep you busy for hours & the great thing about this cartoon? Its for adults aswell as kids!
So do yourself a favour and buy this,you won't regret it ;)",1295136000,5,854,4.245398773006135
3098842,5,B0012VCMRU,"I first seen this cartoon a few months ago on cable television. I would watch every day,early in the morning. It is a very cute and charming cartoon for any age to enjoy. The dog is the brains of the two and has to continuously save his dog-sitter from the trouble he puts himself into. Oh,and of course the dog talks but,it is their little secret. The color detail in this cartoon are unlike any other I have ever seen,and the stories are good in keeping your interest. I strongly recomend this cartoon for any age to enjoy. I guarantee you will watch it over and over again.",1219708800,5,576,4.342592592592593

8247897,5,B0012VCMRU,"In the UK this is called ""Watch My Chops"", but the DVD of that title does not have all 56 episodes that this one has. Where possible, get this one instead. Despite being a mature adult, I used to watch this regular on the BBC TV around 10 years ago, on weekday afternoons. In fact I used to watch a lot of children's shows around that time, as some of them were really good, as this one. Going through them again now they still come across just as fresh and hilarious as originally. I particularly like the artistic design and the very singular architecture of the buildings and apartments. Excellent stuff.",1382227200,,607,4.4774774774774775
8247898,5,B0012VCMRU,I gotta say Mill Creek Entertainment your the best for putting out this set. At first I was like nah not true but the second time I heard about this coming out on DVD I was like Ya I totally buying this set again thank you I'm so happy! =) =) now the DVD case is great artwork is cool love it + the discs look amazing very good also you get 4 DVDs that's a good deal and it's all of the episodes in the season like there's no point buying the Corneil & Bernie vol. 1 set just a waste of money just saying ratter get the complete set it's much better the only thing I didn't like was the inside of the case it really easy to get damage I mean they could of put something safety so then the discs won't break just saying but ya the show it's self is great I highly recommend to children they will enjoy it very much! =)  =),1368403200,,821,3.8579881656804735

8247901,5,B0012VCMRU,"Before i begin my review,let me say that i bought this awesome dvd around summer 2010 so it's a late one.

This show is probably the first(& so far only) ""Nicktoons Original"" i've fallen in love with. While the show's concept isn't original (human interacting with talking animal) the way the writters wrote the shiw is what made this under rated show so special.

Corniel,a dog with a genius IQ just wants to be treated as a normal dog(despite his ability to walk,talk,build high tech electronics from scratch,type,etc),one day he happens to be acting ""out of character"" for a dog & his dog sitter Bernie sees him(which is never made into an episode,but is flash backed(kinda) in the opening theme song).

Corniel swears Bernie to secretcy,and the two eventually become best friends. Bernie often uses poor Corniel's secret against him,for example in the episode ""Things That Go Woof In The Night"" Bernie(who's a pathological liar) & Romeo leave a mess in Corniel's apartment,Romeo becomes suspicious,then Bernie states that a ghost is haunting Corniel's apartment. Bernie's skeptical friend Martha puts Bernie's claims to the test(a running gag in the series),Bernie forces Corniel to help stage a haunting in order to ""protect his secret""(it wasn't actually in danger to begin with).

While this is in fact a complete series dvd set not every original episode from France got dubbed for US i believe,due to the US version's unfortunate cancellation. The dvd doesn't have the big complete series/season features most dvds get either,in fact the only true ""feature"" is the ability to switch between english & spanish languages. Commentary & interviews from the creators/voice actors would have been nice,but it's a small minus.

Corniel & Bernie is an awesome cartoon that all ages can enjoy,and as a 20 year old fan i'm proud to have made this my first complete series dvd purchase.",1301961600,,1884,5.064516129032258
