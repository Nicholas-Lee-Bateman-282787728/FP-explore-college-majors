1408953,5,B000059PEZ,"The ACT San Francisco production of Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew' is the best version of this play that I have seen -- live or on tape/film.  Done in the commedia dell arte style popular in Italy during the Middle Ages, the actors perform on a single set built to resemble a plain wooden stage with no ornamentation.  The cast is well up to the challenge, with Marc Singer and Fredi Olster excellent as the lead characters.  The pace is fast, the jokes obvious, and I would recommend this version to anyone who wants to see 'the Bard' and acting at their best.",1030320000,10,566,4.475728155339806
1408954,5,B000059PEZ,I saw this in the seventies when I was a teenager. It is the best rendition of Taming of the Shrew I have ever seen. I have looked for it for years. So glad I found it. I am buying it today. If you want to see Shakespeare as it was originally intended watch this one.,1029110400,,267,3.7857142857142856
1408955,5,B000059PEZ,"As far as I know (which is admittedly not very far) this performance by the American (!) Conservatory Theater is the only Shakespearean comedy which is actually played as a comedy. All other stages play Shakespeare's comedies as if they were tragedies, or make them exceedingly boring as if to demonstrate that Shakespeare is much too serious to be taken lightly as entertainment. Well, it was meant as entertainment and not to scare away students and audiences.
I have never ever watched a play as fast as this one. I am fascinated by the sheer speed of successive scenes, and of the actore themselves. Ridiculous disguises, burlesque, grotesque and naughty elements all add to the fun. Literary historians claim that comedies in Shakespeare's time always included some element of acrobatics, and slapstick was a must.
Of course, all the boring parts have been cut out, thus reducing the play to only 90 minutes, but they are filled with action.
What is most interesting, and what I call intelligent acting, is that they they changed the original chauvinist message just by Katherina's facial play, her intonation and the wink of an eye - so mind the 85th minute! They didn't change one word of the original text and still the moral has become the opposite, even though Petruchio is played by a real he-man. He turns out to be the loser of the contest between the sexes.
If the director sticks to the old message, and all the others do, the whole play and especially ""the last scene is altogether disgusting to modern sensibility. No man with any decency of feeling can sit it out in the company of a woman without being extremely ashamed of the lord-of-creation moral implied in the wager and the speech put into the woman's own mouth."" That's what George Bernhard Shaw had to say about The Taming Of The Shrew. I think only mcp's could enjoy the original version today.",1027468800,11,1872,4.763076923076923
1408956,5,B000059PEZ,"Yes this is a very good production, but mainly because it makes a firm commitment to the Commedia del 'Arte style.  It's very possible that this production would have been done this way when it was first performed.  Some don't understand that the broad commedy and slap-stick are part of Commedia.  It may seem unnatural for a modern cynical audience, but even they have to admit that Shakespeare wrote for the Queen and the groundlings.  This idea that all Shakespeare has to be high art, lofty and intellectual is hardly accurate to the times his audience existed.  Most educators find this a very accessible introduction to Shakespeare, truer to the spirit of playing, than any other video they could show their students.  Kudos to A.C.T.'s production and it's founder, William Ball!",1006992000,6,786,4.961832061068702

It is so much fun to watch and it's very interesting!  I LOVE IT!  It does not follow the same the same lines as normal plays of WS, but it was done so well, and its def the comidic version.  And you can also pick up on all the sexual indunnos that most people miss when reading shakespeare's plays.. I LOVED IT!",1001635200,3,470,3.9574468085106385
1408958,5,B000059PEZ,This is the play that began my love of shakespeare!  The exceptionally funny wordplay is mirrored by fast-paced slapstick which never fails to elicit gales of laughter.  Marc Singer is the quintessential Petruchio and the chemistry between the leads is as good or better than that between Burton and Taylor in the more well-known version.  This is terrific!!!,989366400,15,359,5.155172413793103
1408978,5,B000059PEZ,"This is my favorite version of this play. It's lively, with lots of physicality that enlivens the production. I know feminists have difficulty with this play. I did too for a while until one of my students said, ""Petruchio gets tamed too."" I had never thought of the play in that way before. I think this version shows that very clearly, which should help my fellow feminists accept the premise of the play.",1472256000,,407,4.589041095890411
1408979,5,B000059PEZ,"Saw this in college in Shakespeare class in the early 1980's, and it's as good as remembered! It's a romp, it's a riot, it's delightful!

The acting is superb, the slapstick is welcome but not overly distracting, the Elizabethan English is well-articulated and amazingly understandable despite all the shenanigans. There are no cinematic wide shots of the countryside or mountains, as it's a film of a stage play. Yet, the camera angles are well done and well-timed.

The chemistry between the leads hearkens to your favorite episodes of ""Remington Steele"" or ""Moonlighting"" (Sorry i can't come up with better examples -- i'm trying to say it's really good!). The conflict seems real, the respect grows palpably, the love matured reminds your of your first-love's fire.

If you're prudish or priggish, don't waste your time. The innuendo is not the primary force of the play, but it's unmistakably there. If you take life too seriously and need a ""proper"" rendition of the Bard, this is probably not your cup of tea.

For a joyful escape into a rowdy romance, be prepared to laugh out loud, look no further!",1466467200,2,1107,4.903743315508021
1408980,5,B000059PEZ,"This rowdy comedy production incorporates slapstick, pratfall and earthy humor into William Shakespeare's comedy about the two unmarried daughters of a wealthy Italian merchant. Let me be perfectly honest with you. I got this 1976 stage version of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" for Marc Singer (the original Beastmaster) I think he was the only bright spot of that movie(Beastmaster). Plus he is shirtless or near to it a lot in this stage production. The entire ensemble were GREAT. The timing of the humor, awesome. Was everyone a bit over the top, absolutely! Which made it a treasure. That is for everyone else. Now for the big shock....Marc Singer was AMAZING. I didn't think he would be able to pull off pure Shakespeare. He Did and stole the show. The scenes between him and his wife were outstanding. I fell in love with him all over again. More then a pretty face and amazing body....he is and was an incredible undiscovered treasure.",1457222400,2,949,4.864197530864198
1408981,5,B000059PEZ,"This version of Shakespeare's THE TAMING OF THE SHREW is marvelous great fun.  It takes the play, blows the dust off it, and presents it as it was originally meant to be seen--based on the Italian Commedia dell'arte. In Shakespeare's time, actors were expected to be tumblers and acrobats as well as just speakers of words.  When you see Marc Singer and Fredi Ostler perform the acrobatics and speak the words simultaneously and beautifully you can feel the vigorous joy Shakespeare meant when he wrote this play.  Watching this version of THE TAMING OF THE SHREW, you can sense the joy the actors are feeling as they act out this happiest of Shakespeare's works.  If you are looking for a
 play by Shakespeare that will make you laugh out loud, I heartily recommend this production of the SHREW.  I have one for myself and have bought
two others for friends. Enjoy.",1456790400,,866,4.701986754966887

1409002,3,B000059PEZ,"The startling 1976 American Conservatory Theatre of San Francisco production is a very mixed bag indeed.

It takes its cue from the fact that several of Shakespeares characters are rooted in the Italian commedia dellarte (as is the case in many of his comedies), and it makes of the whole play what it sees as a commedia dellarte spectacle, which in practice means a lot of slapstick and other physical comedy.  At times this works well; but its worth remembering that while Shakespeare draws on many sources for his plays, he tends to transform them, and to use them only as a starting point.  You cant just reverse engineer his work to make it resemble its sources without losing something essential; Shakespeare is not commedia dellarte, and, especially at the beginning of the play (though maybe its just a question of getting used to it), the play gets seriously garbled.  I don't see how anyone who lacks a certain degree of familiarity with the play could have any idea as to whats going on.  The play occasionally gets lost in something its not.

Having said all that, though, I have to add that the production explodes into brilliance in the scene where Katherina and Petruchio first meet, which must be one of the clearest, most thoughtful, most perfect bits of Shakespeare interpretation Ive seen.  Its the only film where the focus is entirely on the fact that Katherina and Petruchio are shown in this scene to really like each other, and to be birds of a feather who are challenging each other.  This is all done with the aid of the above-mentioned physical performing (which extends to the point of including some WWF-style wrestling moves).  Its all brought off with great panache, and the actors professionalism in carrying off all this strenuous physical activity while reading their lines clearly and fluently is beyond my imagining.  (I might add that its the only time Ive seen American performers seem fully comfortable with Shakespeares language, and manage to read the lines with no awkwardness at all.)

Several other key points of interpretation are navigated with great success.  Petruchios concern with the importance of the interior person and the insignificance of outward appearance is emphasized, and no opportunity is lost to show that these two actually end up in love; and at a certain point, it seems that Kate is shown to find her turning point.

On the other hand, I think it was a mistake for Petruchio to look surprised that Kate should show up when he sends for her, at the end; and when she delivers her big speech, she turns away from the widow far too soon.

There are some other negatives.  With a running time of a little over an hour and forty minutes, about 40% of the play must have been cut; and the cuts include the Induction, which to my mind is always a serious error.  Also, the actors manner of speaking is sometimes too stylized; this is especially true of Kate, who is often quite irritating in the way she speaks.  And the live audience sounds like a laugh track at times.

Overall, however, this is a lively and extremely well-executed performance, if a little over the top.  The interpretation is bold and original, and though its too off-the-wall (and too short) to be considered a first choice, its certainly worth seeing as an alternative version.",1432166400,3,3310,4.775438596491228
1409003,5,B000059PEZ,"I saw this on PBS when it was originally shown and couldn't believe it was in an archive and for sale. It has the Beastmaster guy in it way before he was famous and Mark Harmon and a couple of other people you might recognize from their later work. It's Shakespearian English, not modern English so be warned, it's not for everybody. But if you're into it, like we were during Drama School, its laugh out loud funny.",1430697600,,416,4.346153846153846
1409004,5,B000059PEZ,"I love this adaptation of Taming of the Shrew. The commedia del arte style was beautifully done and could not be more perfect for the Taming of the Shrew. The leads did a fantastic job of showing that Kate and Petruchio actually fall in love with each other. At least, that is the story that this adaptation goes with. That is probably why I like this. I disliked the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton adaptation. This is a comedy, and this adaptation makes sure you won't forget it.",1427846400,,481,4.604651162790698

1409006,5,B000059PEZ,"This is the best version of the play I've found to teach with.  It is not a movie, but a taping of a live play, so it gives my students an opportunity to see it performed as it should be. It uses the comedia del arte style, so there is a lot of physical humor, which translates well to those who don't usually enjoy Shakespeare.  My tenth graders actually understand and laugh at the jokes.  There are some rather interestingly prominent codpieces, a ton of fancy macrame on the costumes in the final scene, and the introduction is given by a man who is smoking, so my students always get a kick out of the early seventies vibe, but the actors are fantastic, especially the two leads.  I'm not sure about the interpretation of Kate's final speech, but it is a good discussion point about how the times (feminist movement) can influence our interpretation of art.  I definitely have a crush on Marc Singer -- he is amazing in this role.  When he smiles at Kate, I just melt every time.",1425081600,3,984,4.4088397790055245

1409031,4,B000059PEZ,"I saw this on VHS in a theater appreciation college class in 1991, and I fell in love with this version of The Taming of the Shrew.

What makes this particular production so special is that it is performed in commedia dell'arte style, which happens to be the style in which it was performed in Shakespeare's day.  However, in Shakespeare's day, acting was considered a lewd and lowly profession, so don't be surprised at the lewd and lascivious nature of this production.

The one inconsistency with this play is that Katherina ends her famous monologue on the duty of women with a wink and a nod, which is a modern convention.  Before the early or mid 1900s (I can't remember which), this play was not performed with a wink and a nod downplaying its most sexist themes.  This wink and nod make these sexist themes less offensive and more palatable to a modern audience, so the choice to use them was based on the era in which this play was produced, not when it was first written and performed.

Aside from the wink and nod, this is probably the most authentic version of Taming of the Shrew available for mass consumption.  The Liz Taylor/Richard Burton movie is ... well ... a movie, but this version is a recorded play done in a style commensurate with when it was first written and performed.",1393977600,,1297,4.564655172413793

1409042,5,B000059PEZ,"Lots of detail in the other reviews, so I'll just point out the age-appropriateness (or not) of this show for the younger set or particularly conservative families. My kids are 10 and 13yo girls who LOVE this version of Shrew. They know the play from listening, acting out an adapted version, and watching it live and on video. This version is bar-none their favorite (and mine, too), although they also really like the knock-off send-up Kiss Me Kate with Howard Keel for other reasons.

Anyway, about the appropriateness part ... yes, there's some Shakespearian bawdiness. A hip-thrust here and there, some costuming you might want kids to see past, a couple of leers and such. My husband had a harder time with the guys in tights than we gals did after the first 10 minutes or so, but it was a touchy first 10 minutes of holding my breath.

We watched it, and I'm glad we did. However, I would not show the video to friends' kids without getting their parents' consent first.

That said, it had so much good in it that we've watched it more than once and laughed our butts off repeatedly. And I definitely agree with another reviewer that Marc Singer (whom I don't know from other roles) nails it when in the midst of all the comedy, he shows his hesitation, his tender side just enough ... just affectingly, perfectly, achingly enough.

This production made me focus on the commedia dell' arte elements in other Bards plays, and I could see them in a very different light (imagine f.i. Polonius as Pantalone snd Hamlet as ""dell arte fool"" or the merchant as pantalone and his doughter as colombine and so on...). Sometimes the ""serious"" plays in the canon are taken much too serious in my opinion - even the beheading scenes must have been great fun for the Elizabethan audience and surely must have been redone twice or thrice.
To my understanding of Shakespeare it was very important, and I would like to see more productins like these!",1320278400,,866,4.487341772151899
1409044,5,B000059PEZ,"When you don't have the luxury of long lenses and highly precise lighting, things have to happen big on stage so the folks in the cheap seats can get a feel for the mood.

Man, do they ever.  Marc Singer's surprisingly acrobatic delivery (sticking out sideways from an overhead pole, for instance) and Fredi Olster's unrelentingly icy demeanor are clearly visible at a distance.  On camera it's a little in-your-face but just imagine being in the audience at the time.

I've seen a few versions of several of Shakespeare's plays, both live and recorded, performed and as movies.  Far and away, this is one of the most entertaining things you could watch.  The actors' pacing and delivery are spot on - the post-wedding Sr. Baptista calling for the gendarmes: ""Ossifer!""

1409045,5,B000059PEZ,"As a graduate student in English, I was required to write an in depth research paper on this play. I viewed three different productions of the play, the BBC version with John Cleese as Petruchio, the Franco Zeffirelli debacle, and this version.  Of the three, this one adheres most closely to the original script and offers a performance that provides a staging similar to how the play was likely performed. The Zeffirelli version actually changes the text - not just editing, but actual alterations in the words and scenes that change the characters and the meaning of the play.  Unlike Zeffirelli and his actors, the director and actors of this production ""get it.""  There should be genuine affection between the two lead characters - and there is.  The humor should be broad and just a little bawdy. It is. The performances here are energetic and the camera work gives you the feel of a front row seat at the performance.  There is even an introduction by Hal Holbrook and an interview with the director that provide additional insights into the play and the staging. Most importantly, this production is fun!

1409046,5,B000059PEZ,"This is quite possibly the best adaptation of ""Shrew"" ever performed. It's faithful to the original material, but performed in an energetic, comedic style that has to be seen. So many productions of even Shakespeare's comedies are performed in a stiff, boring style because He is The Bard, after all - they're forgetting that he was a hack writer who just wanted to make a living writing plays.

This doesn't completely fix the misogynistic, sexist source material (hey, Shakespeare lived during the Sixteenth Century - you want him marching for sufferage or something?), but it manages to suppress it to the point that it isn't nearly as bad.

1409050,5,B000059PEZ,"The opinions of the reviews seemed so different and so unyielding that I decided to go on a Taming binge and watch every one of them I could get my hands on and see for myself.

The Taming of the Shrew - She became more cunning...not tame...or else it would be pitiful and not a comedy.

1976 with Marc Singer - winner hands down, my husband and I both like this one best it is fun and funny, Marc definitely pulled it off amazingly, the times when he showed some vulnerability made that part.

1988 Scott Wentworth as Tranio was the best part of this one. In the first 20 minutes or so he does a hilarious amount of acting just with the bottom of his face. He has subtlety that doesn't turn him into a caricature. I would like to see what he could have done as Petruchio. He can also sing like there is no tomorrow.

1980 with John Cleese BBC - we were hoping it would be funnier instead it seemed serious

1967 with Liz Taylor and R. Burton - talk about fluffy middle-aged people trying to be young and vital. He looked like he was going to collapse when he tried to pick her up.

1999 10 Things I hate about You - The actual Kate and Petruchio parts were nice, but some of the vulgarity we could have lived without. Drawing a penis and testicles on somebody's face seemed unnecessary.

1983 with Franklyn Seales - He didn't have the chops for this part. He should play a Vulcan on Star Trek or something.

1929 with Douglas Fairbanks This one was very early when they were switching from silent to talkies. You can surely tell it too. A little painful.

1982 with Len Cariou - Recorded in EP. There is some confusion as to when it was recorded either 1982, or 1984-85 It is better than 1929, 1967, 1980, and 1983, but not as good as 1976. Much of what made it better was the fact that it kept to the original script and it was funnier and more animated than John Cleese's version. However, the hollering of the Katherine character made it seem more violent than the funnier 1976 version.

1950 with Charlton Heston - This was my first time watching anything with CH. I was surprised to see him strike Kate across the face three times. I had thought that patriotic gun lovers didn't strike women, but he was probably just following the script. It seemed as if they sometimes were more focused on getting their lines said and said loud enough to hear than they were in really feeling the part.

2005 This Kate curses constantly and gives the finger to the camera/we the audience.",1248307200,3,2480,4.346320346320346
1409051,5,B000059PEZ,I love this production! it is funny and romantic. the actresses are all great. its such a feel good play.,1227830400,,105,4.3
1409052,5,B000059PEZ,"This one is simply the best.  I have no problem at all choosing between this production and the Burton/Taylor movie.  This one wins without a contest. Grab it while you can!

William Ball's production remembers one thing that many productions forget: this is a comedy and it is supposed to be funny.  It is not literary scripture to be intoned in solemn reverence to the great Bard of Stratford on Avon.  To accomplish this Ball makes a robust and ribald presentation based on the Commedia dell'arte, a broad and slapstick style that was current in Shakespeare's time.  The result is baldly, not subtly, hilarious.

More subtle is the direction of the story itself.  Thoughtful direction, brilliantly delivered by the Marc Singer as Petruchio and Fredi Olster as Kate, is used to show Petruchio's increasing regard for Kate as the play proceeds. Even in the final scene it is clear that when he calls for Kate to come, after the other two wives have refused, that he is uncertain of the outcome.  Thus he is surprised, delighted and gratified when she does come, not gloating in overbearing male chauvinist triumph. This goes a long way toward making modern sense of the now problematic text about the roles of men and women, and the way she is brought to heel. (I find the middle section of the play where the shrew taming is accomplished, with methods that include food and sleep deprivation, has an uncomfortable resemblance to modern day brainwashing and torture. It leaves today's audience with the question: Is it love? Or is it Stockholm syndrome?  The very idea of such obedience is now controversial, even without the issue of abuse.  This presents a huge challenge for the present day production of Taming of the Shrew as anything but a theatrical museum piece.) Portrayed in this way, Petruchio is not a just a swaggering playboy out to cash in a dowry, but someone who might be worthy of the obedience he expects, and is coming to value the strength and honesty of Kate and its advantages over the coquettish, spoiled personalities of Bianca and her friends back in Padua. Thus this production is both traditional and modern without upending the play entirely in some PC ""re-visioning"" or gender-bent re-interpretation.  And most of all, it is funny.

I saw it one time on PBS before the VCR and I thought I would never see it again, and worse, nor would anybody else leaving Zeffirelli's text mangled showpiece or much duller ""official"" versions as the only ones available.  I was overjoyed to find that it had been released on DVD in  along with many other similar programs that I enjoyed on PBS (do not let the politicians kill PBS!) many years ago that are also in this Broadway Theater Archives series.

The Burton/Taylor/Zeffirelli version is just a movie.  It places showcasing its marquee power, plush production, and cinematography far above the play itself. It seems like about half the play is omitted outright and the rest, even some the most prominent and well known speeches are hacked up.  (Compare the play or this production to the ""streamlining"" done to the final scene in the movie. Completely unedited presentations of any Shakespeare are rare, and for good reason, but this was too much.)  Seeing both in close sequence reminded me just how good this one is, and how much the other suffers after subtracting the contribution of movie stardom and lush production.",1219104000,7,3395,4.842560553633218

1409055,5,B000059PEZ,"This production of ""The Taming of the Shrew"" is so much fun to watch. This is one flimed stage production that really works -- they often don't. The staging and costuming are really well done and the acting is superb. I can't believe the way these players can precisely execute all their timed pratfalls while speaking flawless Shakespearean iambic pentameter. Their athleticism is amazing. They all really appear to be enjoying themselves, which makes this production shine. It is almost two hours long, but the time flew by.

This is one of Shakespeare's bawdier plays, so if you're planning to watch it with your children, as I did, check it out first. Most things will fly right over the heads of younger children and young teens, I imagine. Hopefully over the heads of older teens, too.

This was filmed in 1976, but it is timeless entertainment. I highly recommend it and plan to use it in a Shakespeare class I am teaching for a group of high school aged homeschoolers.",1202860800,4,976,4.735294117647059
1409056,5,B000059PEZ,"This version may take some getting used to for the modern audience because it is based on the commedia del'arte style, which is more slapstick and physical.  However, it is the BEST version of Taming of the Shrew that has been done, IMHO.  To even more fully appreciate the this version, read the play before watching it.  Then, you'll recognize the genius of the acting, particularly Marc Singer as Petruchio.  He is able say the lines in such a way so that the meaning is changed, making the play [the text of which is overtly sexist] much more palatable to the modern audience.  For example, when Petruchio takes Kate to his home, he purposely denies her food and sleep all in the name of love, but really to ""tame"" her from her ""shrewish"" ways.  Now, this is a hard part of the written play for a modern reader to stomach because it is abusive.  However, in a soliloquy, Singer reveals his plan to the audience. When he gets to this line--""This is a way to kill a wife with kindness""---he has this confused look on his face while scratching his head that makes him seem to be a man that is trying to figure out how to best handle Kate but really has no idea. That, and other parts of that scene, really take the brutality out of it and re-inject it with humor.  It's just a small example, but there are many other such examples in the play where the delivery of the lines, the expressions, and the staging are pure genius.  I love this version because it doesn't destroy the original text by making it PC. Rather, it makes us believe that Kate and Petruchio ultimately love each other.  I have yet to see a better Petruccio and Kate or a better version of this play. Certainly, the non-stop screeching of Liz Taylor in the Zeffirelli version is absolutely no match for Olster's performance in this version.",1200700800,2,1810,4.474164133738602

1409059,5,B000059PEZ,"I doubt that I'll ever see a better ""Shrew"" than this American Conservatory Theatre production, and I've seen several Shrews in my life. William Ball's decision to stage it in the commedia dell'arte style was a stroke of genius that contextualizes the plot and energizes the comedy. It allowed him to drop the awkward and incomplete frame Shakespeare provides in his prologue. In its place he gives us a much more satisfying literal frame in which the bare acting area is surrounded by an ""offstage"" where the musicians and the clowns sit in view alongside any actors who are not involved in the current scene.

From the moment when the first clowns suss out the space and then tip-toe elaborately onto the stage, we know we're in for something extraordinary. A lesser director and a less talented cast might not be able to sustain this elaborate conceit -- actors acting actors in a play within a play. But the energy, the audacity, the comedy, and the fun never flag. The performance is transporting. And after the bows and the applause, after the players retire, after the last clown stealthily closes the gate like the last fairy at daybreak removing the final evidence of their frolic, we return to ordinary space and understand that theatre like this is as close to magic as we're likely to get.

That brings me to a practical point. I taught high school English for many years and covered a lot of Shakespeare in that time. Without any doubt, I can say that this production is how you seduce teenagers into enjoying Shakespeare. With any class in any year, it works. Ten minutes in, and even a Grade 10 technical class is lapping it up and begging for more. The action so illuminates the lines, and the actors speak so well, that you don't even need texts; they just get in the way. The tomfoolery and the generous eye candy ensure that nobody gets bored, so nobody gets left behind. Commedia dell'arte can be very broad, and this play is as well, so if your school administration or your community is prudish, you should perhaps be cautious. But in any other school, bring it on!",1183507200,3,2087,4.6531165311653115

They also have an uncanny way of ""speaking the speech"" which gets it across to the audience as clear as day.  You don't need to understand 'Shakespearean verse' to see this performance.

1409061,5,B000059PEZ,"I saw this live at ACT in San Francisco like another reviewer. I had seen Shakespearean movies before but this was my first attendence at a live staging of one of his plays. Wow! It was fantastic. I was just telling our dinner guests tonight that every production I see of Shakespeare's plays I compare to this one -- because it was The Best.

The stage sets are minimal, but the costumes are vibrant, and the actors are energetic and speak their lines in a way that adds new insight to those who have only read the play. The scenes between Kate and Petruchio are delightful. I wish everyone who loves Shakespeare could have been there to see this version live.

Because of my attendence at this ACT stage peformance, I tend to be critical of many of the Hollywood versions of Shakespeare. They may have superior film quality and cinematography but they just cannot compare to stage versions in the quality of the acting and the clever interpretation of Shakespeare's lines. These stage versions bring Shakespeare to life. The actors make the lines in play come to life, adding humor to lines that did not seem funny when reading the play. The repartee in this stage version is wonderful.

Recommendation (I hope this is released on DVD too):

I do not know if this other ACT Shakespeare play production was filmed but I will mention it too:  When the Geary theatre reopened in San Francisco after repairs of the damage from the 1989 earthquake, the ACT christened the opening of the refurbished theatre with a production of The Tempest. This is apparently a stage tradition ensuring good luck for the theatre just as putting on Macbeth is considered bad luck.  I convinced my husband that we HAD to go see the Tempest. I told him how wonderful the ACT Taming of the Shrew had been.

While not quite as exciting (for me) as the ACT Taming of the Shrew from the 70s, The Tempest was still very good. I had read the play at least twice before hand and seeing it staged at ACT was eye-opening. Again, lines that did not seem funny when reading the play became hilarious with the interpretion of them by the ACT actors. Again, the stage set was minimal, the costumes superb and the acting excellent. This ACT version also incorporated some very creative puppetry. This was my husband's first exposure to Shakespeare on stage. He was blown away.",1173571200,3,2340,4.624096385542169
1409062,5,B000059PEZ,"The Taming of the Shrew is not my favorite Shakespeare play - too politically incorrect! - but this is one of my favorite versions of any Shakespeare.  The stage is set in a plain manner, making no attempt to gloss over the fact that it is, in fact, a play - as opposed to dazzling and distracting the audience with background.  The spareness of the set, even the choice of the colors used for the costumes, keep the attention focused on the actors and Shakespeare's amazing language.

The ascetic nature of the set is more than made up for by the exuberance of the actors and the exaggerated, but breathtaking choreography.  Lines come to life in a way that make you laugh aloud: ""Methinks you walk like a stranger,"" and ""My eyes were dazzled by the -- sun?"" are two memorable examples.  Grumio's halitosis, Bianca's sighs, Hortensio and the broken lute - to say nothing of the cheers that erupt whenever Padua is mentioned - these all are instances of the marvelous directing and the cast's ability to manage the split-second pace.

A special tribute must be made to Marc Singer, who, as Petruchio, carries much of the play - as well as many of the other actors! He's extremely easy on the eye, and is explicitly appreciated by Fredi Olster in her role as the cursed Katerina.  She brings depth to her role, too, by the expression in her eyes, and you realize that during the course of the play she has tamed Mad Petruchio.

As a DVD, there's not much offered in the way of special features.  But don't let that stop you from buying it!  It brings Shakespeare to life with both energy and joy, and you will adore having it perform in your living room.",1167696000,4,1653,4.498327759197324

  Not everyone has had the chance to venture out to San Francisco and catch a live presentation from one of the top two repertory companies in the the nation, The American Conservatory Theater (ACT), on Geary st. in that fair city.

This is from the golden era of theater and from a period when Bill Ball was still at the helm of an institution that has always had the highest reputation for quality staging and for a great ensemble troupe of players.
  ACT has always stressed two aspects both in terms of training and production, physical dexterity (including energy) and vocal acuity (the resident speech trainer, Anne Fletcher, was one of the best in the business). This production highlights both. The actors have verve, panache and speek the speech ""trippingly on the tongue."" Marc Singer and Fredi Olster create the sort of dynamic interplay that unfortunately is all too rare in most productions of this play. They appear to be having a ball.
Singer also shines as Christian in another ACT production (Cyrano de Bergerac) which is also available in the Broadway Thater Archives series. An ACT fixture, Peter Donat, is the memorable Cyrano in that play. Those of you who only know of Singer from his role as The Beastmaster, will be pleasantly surprised at what a quality actor he really is.",1047600000,48,1845,4.8107255520504735
1409077,5,B000059PEZ,"Riveting high energy interpretation of one of Shakespeare's more problematic comedies. The director's decision to present this somewhat sexist comedy as an over-the-top commedia dell'arte production was brilliant. Patruchio's use of physical violence to tame his headstrong finacee is somehow made tolerable because all the relationships in this play are embued with violence. And like characters in a Roadrunner cartoon, victims bounce back with vigor and always manage to give as good as they get. The troupe is incredibly in sync with one another, highly athletic, and incredibly gifted at reciting their iambic pentameter flawlessly while being twirled overhead or kicked in the groin. It really has to be seen to be believed. And who knew Marc Singer, the Beastmaster, could act?! In the end, he brings a subtlety to his part that leaves you wondering who's taming whom?

Harold Clurmann's interview with the director is a nice DVD extra.",1041811200,47,943,5.286666666666667
1409078,5,B000059PEZ,"I always liked the Zeferrelli film version of ""The Taming of Shrew"" with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton for reasons largely having little to do with the text of Shakespeare's play.  That film is very much a visual treat, as you would expect from Zeferrelli, but I find I have a much better appreciation for the text from this ACT version which strips everything down to the dialogue and sends the actors out to do battle.
The impetus for this production is that the play is performed in the style of ""commedia dell'arte,"" an Italian theatrical form that flourished throughout Europe from the 16th to 17th centuries (well, ""The Taming of the Shrew"" is set in Italy and the play was written during the 16th century, so it makes sense).  This approach emphasizes ensemble acting and celebrates rich verbal humor, without disdaining physical comedy.  However, do not expect to be seeing masks, because while that was key to ""commedia dell'arte"" where the mask was more important than the player because of the standardized characters (e.g., capitano, harlequin, pantaloon, etc.), this is not that traditional a performance.  Of course, this does emphasize how much ""Shrew"" is like a traditional ""commedia dell'arte""; you certainly have Zanni, the madcap servants, as well as the young couple whose love is thwarted by their parents with Bianca and Lucentio.
Watching this play certainly emphasizes the production over the individual performances.  However, you will be allowed to indulge a momentary pause when you notice that it is Marc Singer (""The Beastmaster"") who is play Petruchio.  Harry Hamlin is recognizable in a bit part, but the rest of the cast has remained unknown, which, again, emphasizes the script more than the actors.  Even Fredi Olster, who plays Katherina, has disappeared except for choice roles like the Woman in Hallway in ""Burglar"" and Judge Winters on ""Walker, Texas Ranger.""
The bottom line is that if I was interested in turning young students onto Shakespeare, in terms of the love of language and the joy in word play, then this ACT production of ""The Taming of the Shrew"" from the Broadway Theater Archive would be the one I would show them.  Certainly the broad style of the comedy will drive home the various nuances of the Bard's language (although I agree with those critics who say Shakespeare is responsible for the main Petruchio-Katherina plot line and not the Bianca-Lucentio sub-plot).  Besides, they will probably be excited to see the Beastmaster in action again.",1035676800,34,2508,5.038647342995169

7934008,5,B000059PEZ,"I purchased this to show students while we read the play. It enhanced my lessons because sometimes students have a difficult time interpreting Shakespeare's plays; they read them like books rather than theatrical performances. This interpretation fills in the gaps: comedic timing, blocking, tone, mood, etc. You will want to send home a permission slip, however. The tights the men wear are ... form-fitting and leave little to the imagination.",1483056000,,445,5.371428571428571
