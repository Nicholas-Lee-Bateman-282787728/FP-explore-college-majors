8359336,2,B002ADO6CS,"This is not an official Genesis product.  The video was captured during their tour in Poland with frontman Ray Wilson (who replaced Phil Collins at the time).  One disc is average and the other has terrible sound and video quality.  The double-CD offered has the audio extracted from the DVD so you'll find same issues.  Price is high, expectations were also high but once on my DVD player I felt I was robbed.",1341792000,,410,4.575342465753424
8359337,2,B002ADO6CS,"There is so little film of Genesis after Phil Collins left, I was looking forward to this concert.
I have no idea who actually released this, but to be frank it's embarassing. The sound and video quality flips
from 'reasonable' to something on par to a kid doing a sneaky recording of something on their mobile phone !!!
I am glad to have it as part of my collection, but feel that the overall production quality was
a complete let down on a commercially available DVD..",1303603200,,470,4.476744186046512
8359338,2,B002ADO6CS,"Great performance, band was tight and material well covered by Wilson. Glad I purchased it (elsewhere and slightly cheaper) but in reality it should be sold for no more than $10 due to its awful production. Looks like an old VHS tape converted to DVD. Audio is not true surround sound. Audio probably gets 3 stars. Video only 2. As a completist I am happy to have it and will continue to watch it as I like the Wilson era Genesis. Only wish Genesis could have cleaned this up and included it in the new boxset. If you are a die hard fan and must have it, buy it but don't expect much of the video. If your not a die hard, pass on this.",1258934400,4,635,4.088

8359340,1,B002ADO6CS,"I bought this hoping it would be a professional release.  I've seen better quality bootleg concerts on VHS.  I've become a Ray Wilson fan over the years.  So at the very least, it's good to at least see the performance of Ray with Genesis.  Shame the quality had to be so poor.",1257724800,,277,4.269230769230769
8359341,1,B002ADO6CS,"MOVIEMARS SOLD ME THIS DVD THAT AMAZON IS REVIEWING AND I TOOK A CHANCE. DVD 2 WAS BAD AND FROZE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF ""MAMA"" AND THESE GUYS WOULD NOT REPLACE THE BAD DVD. THEY ARE CARRYING BOOTLEG MATERIAL THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OFF EUROPEAN TV WITH CALL STATION LETTERS IN UPPER RIGHT CORNER THROUGHOUT MOST THE CONVERT AND NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH CUSTOMER SUPPORT AS THEY SHOULD. I WONDER IF AMAZON SUPPORTS BOOTLEGS? I GUESS THEY MUST OR WHY WOULD AMAZON ""NOT SELL IT"" BUT ALLOW MOVIEMARS TO? I GUESS IF AN INDEPENDENT SELLER HAS 5-6 DIGIT FEEDBACK THEY ARE IMMUNE FROM FOLLOWING THE RULES. I OPERATED AS AN HONEST SELLER AND BECAUSE MY SON 2000 MILES AWAY MADE A MISTAKE THEY CLOSED MY SELLER ACCOUNT WITH OVER 4000 POSITIVE FEEDBACKS AND LESS THAN 2% NEGATIVE RATING.

8359342,1,B002ADO6CS,"Dear friends, I always called them very well because of quality products and always you are very responsible, but this time, I can not.
Video quality is terrible, and the price you are charging are very high for quality so poor on this DVD I hope adjust the price to something reasonable and talk about its quality, which is why friends did not I qualify excellent as I always do, it is not right,
Estimados amigos de Importicos  ,  siempre los califico muy bien porque tiene calidad en sus productos, y siempre son ustedes muy responsables, pero en esta oportunidad, no puedo hacerlo.
La calidad del video es psima, y el precio que estn cobrando  es caro porque es parece una copia mal grabada de televisin, yo haba visto ese concierto antes, y la calidad que tenia antes  bajado  de la  Internet era superior,

Espero ajusten el precio a algo razonable y hablen sobre la calidad del mismo, por esta razn amigos no los puedo calificar excelente como siempre lo hago, porque no es justo,",1255219200,,987,4.605714285714286
8359343,3,B002ADO6CS,"The recently released ""Genesis: Live In Poland"" is not a high quality DVD, with good to poor production visually, and substandard sound as well (it's a bootleg shot for Polish TV).  That being said, it is an entertaining look at the band on their one and only tour with Ray Wilson as frontman, 1997-98's ""Calling All Stations"".  For some Genesis fans, Phil's departure from the band, and Ray replacing him bordered on a sort of musical blasphemy, for others it was a chance to add another chapter to an impressive legacy (I still recall the outrage when Phil replaced Peter Gabriel years ago). Though the album itself did not do overly well, the single ""Congo"" did reach the Top 20 in several countries around the world.

This DVD contains several of the songs off that CD, it is how Ray, Tony and Mike re-work some of the older material that is worth taking a listen to.  For me, the stand out tracks were ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"", ""Domino"", ""Dancing With The Moonlit Knight"", and a surprising acoustic version of ""Follow You, Follow Me"" (with Tony on guitar!!!).  Other classics are well done, but either are lacking the extra flare brought to them, or it seems Ray was trying to copy too much of Phil's familiar live performance antics.  I thought a few songs seemed to have more of an edge added to them, and Mike looked more into the show than usual.

It is a shame that the band didn't see fit to polish up this footage, and add it to the new 'Live' box set that has come out.  As Genesis cancelled their North American tour in 1998, this is as close as many of us will ever come to seeing what the reformed band had to offer.  The packed stadium in Katowice seemed to be enjoying the show, and Phil's absence didn't seem to matter much at all.  Much of the concert from Prague (shot 2 days later) has been posted on YouTube, but the quality isn't much better than on this DVD.

For all it's many faults (which thanks to reading other reviews, I knew about beforehand), I did actually enjoy ""Live In Poland"".  It was a new and refreshing (and shortlived) change from what I had come to expect from the band.  Ray Wilson did a very good job for his first (and only) tour with Genesis, and considering the shoes he was attempting to replace, was quite an accomplishment.  The ultimate Genesis concert for me is still from the Mama Tour back in 1983.  I liked 2007's ""When In Rome"" DVD as well, but it just seemed to be missing that extra something special.  If you are a true fan of Genesis, it's worth picking up...if you're only Genesis with Phil fan, it's a safe guess you'll hate before you even give it a chance.",1253836800,2,2629,4.423236514522822
8359344,3,B002ADO6CS,"Yes..this is a bootleg! the video quality leaves much to be desired, I have VHS tapes of concerts that look much better than this.
It's a shame Genesis never released this concert, especially after seeing the 2 songs(Some other way & The Dividing Line)from this concert included in the 5.1 remastered CAS DVD. Both songs are crystal clear and the audio is superb.
Genesis had a perfect opportunity to include this show in a quality format in the box set and for some reason they seem to want to delete it's existence from their past...GET OVER IT! it's part of your history and I think it's a good concert.

I have seen every Genesis tour since seeing them on the Selling England by the Pound tour, including the reunion tour of several years ago.
I had tickets for this tour(N America)and was very disappointed when it was cancelled, like other Genesis fans, I have always wanted to see them perform this tour live but never had the opportunity. I did hear of bootlegs of this show being available, but I don't belong to any trader club or don't have a DVD recorder on my computer.

I only skimmed through this DVD when it was delivered and will watch it all this weekend.
First impressions:
The video is 5 out of 10
The audio is not true 5.1 as the other reviewer has written but it sounds pretty good, not great but good.
It's nice to hear a different approach on the songs, especially the addition of Nik and the guitarist. I think they add a freshness and rejuvination to material that has been played so many times it's predictible.
When I listen to Nik playing on The Dividing Line..I think..Phil who???
On the second DVD Genesis peforms 3 unplugged numbers,Dancing with the Moonlit Knight, Follow You, Follow Me and Suppers ready. Tony even steps away from the keyboards and plays guitar.
It's a nice touch and perfectly suits Ray's vocal styling.

Maybe I will update this after viewing the entire package this weekend.

In summary, it's a bootleg, the video quality leaves a lot to be desired but the stereo mix sounds good and allows one to hear Genesis live with Ray Wilson.
His vocals are off a bit now and then but unlike most DVD concerts where the rough spots are fixed in the studio, this is raw as it was that night.
I'm sure if Genesis had taken the time to release this themselves, everything would sound fantastic and the rough bits fixed.

If you're like me and you enjoyed Calling All Stations and like Ray Wilson, then you will like the concert.
I would recommend picking up one of the used ones for half the price or check one of the Genesis trading sites to see if someone will give you one but most I've seen don't have all the setlist that's included here.
I have a feeling this will sell quite well and Genesis will wished they had released it.
I also have a feeling there will be a cease and desist order on this DVD and CD and copies will no longer be available.

Do I feel bad I bought a bootleg? No
Do I feel bad I had to because Genesis wouldn't release this? Yes
thanks guyz
a disappointed lifetime fan",1248220800,11,3037,4.443447037701975
8359345,3,B002ADO6CS,"I was thrilled to see that the Genesis 1998&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Calling-All-Stations/dp/B000WTZ784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Calling All Stations</a>&nbsp;Tour was finally getting officially released on DVD (NTSC, Region 0). For those who do not know, it was the (often forgotten) tour after Phil Collins officially announced his departure from Genesis. The band line up included co-founding members Mike Rutherford (guitars/bass) and Tony Banks (keys) with new lead singer Ray Wilson and backing musicians Nir Z (drums) and Anthony Drennon (guitars/bass).

All of that being said, I was extremely disappointed to find out upon playing the DVD that it is the same quality as the bootleg in wide circulation (from Polish television) and the claimed '5.1 surround sound', is completely bogus. It's actually audio that is equally disbursed through four stereo channels. So, the quality is only so-so, and the audio is only so-so overall. The only positive is that the discs and packaging are attractive. I later came to learn that this DVD is not sanctioned by the band or their management, which explains why the item is sub-par in comparison to the band's other DVD releases.

While its nice to have this largely undocumented tour on a pressed DVD set (only excerpts appear on the video portion of the official&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1983-1998-Box-Set-5CD-5DVD/dp/B000WETHXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1983-1998 Box Set 5CD/5DVD</a>), it will leave some people feeling disappointed.",1247443200,12,1589,6.251141552511416
