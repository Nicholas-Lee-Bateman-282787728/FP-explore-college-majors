8442545,4,B004V2D6OU,"Coolie No. 1 is one of the funniest film of the decade. Govinda became possibly known for being a comedy King after this Movie. His earlier work Raja Babu was another Entertainer. Shakti Kapoor won the best comedian for this movie and truly deserved it. The movie has action, romance, family drama and lots of comedy. The weakness in this movie has to be Karishma Kapoor. Karishma Kapoor is one of Bollywood worst actresses. Most of her films are either Flops or Hits because of the actor. Every Karishma Movie I've seen had a deja vu of her always acting childishly immature. Perhaps the director know's this before casting or she just suits the dim witted character like her sister Kareena. Anyway the movie still is a Pure Entertainer. Thanks to Kader Khan, Shakti Kapoor the famous comedy duo. Above all Govinda.",1304467200,,816,4.753521126760563
