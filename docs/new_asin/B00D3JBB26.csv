8588959,3,B00D3JBB26,"The title of this DVD is a bit misleading because, while there are blues artists  well known in the US  (Tedeski Trucks Band, Charles Bradley), its not all blues here. There is singer-songwriter (David Gray), pure pop (Walk Off The Earth , a Halifax-based band  whose song Summer Vibe is catchy, though a bit repetitive) and DJ hip-hop (Tiesto). Because this huge festival is in Canada, many artists were new to me. Each is identified as the region of Canada  or other country they come from.

The image is not wide screen (its 3:4) and in a few of the performances the image was squished so heads looked thin. (I checked my TV and DVD player settings and that wasn't the issue).

The festival benefits music in Canadian schools and there is a 4 minute bonus feature showing kids having the opportunity to play. But its really useless because the footage is silent and accompanied by another soundtrack.
It was fun to see this DVD but not essential and, -as I said  its more than blues

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
