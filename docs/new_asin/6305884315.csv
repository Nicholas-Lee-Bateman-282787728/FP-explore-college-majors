Under no circumstances should this be viewed by anyone for any reason if you have anything else watch it! A kung fu movie should always be about kung fu not about ghosts, exorcisms, or people getting possessed twice. A kung fu movie starts with one story and everything in that story centers on one point. This movie is confusing and boring. The action is substandard, the main hero started out as and remained throughout the whole movie a chump, nobody showed any real skills, and the final battle was too short! Leave this $#!T alone!!!",1246147200,,616,4.460176991150442
7896903,2,6305884315,"If you are looking for a Shaolin movie with good fights, then this is not the movie for you. The reason I completed this movie was because there was nothing else to watch on TV. I fast forwarded through most of it. I was under the impression that most Shaolin movies would have some good fights and training...unfortunately this was not the case here.",985305600,2,351,4.5

Can he find and beat this man, and is there more to the story then he may think?  Another Shoalin flic with some shaolin mastery.",979084800,,274,3.963636363636364
7896905,2,6305884315,For any Shaolin enthusiast...You really can't go wrong. Not as visually stunning as some other Shaolin movies and lacking in serious training scences...none the less viewable for all Shaolin fans,974160000,,195,5.533333333333333
