4428370,5,B004M20YOO,"We are accustomed to the fact that as long as the movie carries the name of an investigator ( see Mannix, Kojak, Wallander, Beck etc) that investigator must be the main character, the star. In this movie Van Vetteren is an outsider, a retired investigator owning a second hand bookstore. Yet he is a first hand in orienting the active investigators on the right track to solve crimes.
Just get accustomed to it! It is very interesting !",1359590400,2,436,4.602564102564102
4428371,4,B004M20YOO,"Happy to see that Amazon USA is now selling some great Swedish detective series, among which Van Veeteren numbers. It's about a retired detective in his 70s who owns a book store and is available to former colleagues for consultation on murder cases. Of course he knows a lot more than the younger detectives and does the brain work. Good stories, great acting.",1358899200,7,361,4.746031746031746
4428372,5,B004M20YOO,Good Drama. Very well executed and right out of our own headlines. Wish we had more series of this caliber on TV.,1355529600,2,113,4.181818181818182
4428373,5,B004M20YOO,"I am a complete nut about Nordic crime--read it all the time, can't wait for my next author's book to come out in hardback. So when I found out there was a Van Veeteren series--Hakan Nesser's ostensibly bumbling yet brilliant detective-- I was apoplectic with joy.  I bought the first 3 episodes as soon as they were available, and then I bought the next in the series, Episodes 4-6.  All of them are wonderful. The actors capture the book characters well, the plots are mostly similar to the books, and the vast, cold, and often murderous landscape of this fictional city is just the ticket for mystery lovers everywhere.",1350345600,5,622,4.697247706422019

8435396,5,B004M20YOO,"Despite being a retired investigator, Van Veeteren is still sharp as a tack and a master of subtle interviewing as he mentors the younger detectives in his former office.",1400284800,2,170,4.896551724137931
8435397,5,B004M20YOO,"This is a great series. Van Veetren is compassionate and caring, but his mind is always on the case. As always the Swedish or danish films are excellent with brillant acting and storylines. I would highly reccommend this series to anyone who liked the killing and The bridge.",1375747200,6,275,4.75
