5572474,5,B00BC36UBM,I am still waiting for the dvd's to arrive...I truly enjoyed the first season of this show and wanted to have a personal copy of this new series...,1372464000,,147,4.285714285714286
5572475,5,B00BC36UBM,"This show is like the very best of early 90's action flicks all rolled up into one package. Seagal and VanDamme wish they could have been in a show like this! It has kung fu fights, car chases, gun play, snappy dialogue, gratuitous nudity, comedy, drama, and even can be weird at times. I wouldn't have ever imagined Alan Ball being attached to something like this, but with True Blood becoming increasingly worse each season he had to find a new home, and this is a very good one. Each episode is like it's own action movie. The characters are well developed, and the fights are awesomely choreographed. I can't imagine Cinemax sunk a ton of money into the production of this show but what they did invest all shows up on the screen. If you are a fan of 80's and nineties action flicks in the vein of ROADHOUSE, Elmore Leonard stories, or just like a lot of action to numb a bad day at work this show will do that and probably more.",1370476800,41,933,4.337142857142857
5572476,5,B00BC36UBM,"With the most intense series pilot I've ever seen, I had to continue through all 10 episodes and it only gets better. The season 1 finale is some of the best television I've ever seen and I've seen plenty of greats like The Shield, Justified and 24. I cannot say enough good things about this show it really is the best new show of 2013 in my honest opinion. Original stories, strong cast and the showdown in the finale was, honestly, perfect.

If you only check out 1 new show this year, let it be Banshee.",1366588800,8,507,4.28125
5572477,5,B00BC36UBM,"Cinemax, my guilty pleasure. I don't know that Cinemax is even trying to veer away from its ""skinemax"" rep but it IS trying to flirt with a more legitimate identity as a series provider. STRIKE BACK and HUNTED are addictive shows, but they may not be as huge a guilty pleasure as BANSHEE which is, for my money, even more lurid and gratuitously violent.

For most of its debut episode we don't even know the lead character's name. BANSHEE introduces us to a master thief (Antony Starr) who'd just got done serving fifteen years of hard time. But the thief is anything but rehabilitated. Fueled by rage and longing he tracks down his ex-flame and partner-in-crime to a town in Pennsylvania named Banshee. In a bar on the outskirts of town, he witnesses the brutal death of Banshee's incoming sheriff, Lucas Hood. While burying the sheriff, the thief arrives at one of those last-moment epiphanies. He desperately needs to disappear. No one knows what the new sheriff looks like. It's easy math.

While STRIKE BACK and HUNTED deal more with international intrigue, BANSHEE is very much American Gothic noir. It's a pretty wacky premise that is immediately addictive even though it's got a glaring flaw because for a guy desperate to fall off the grid, there are surely more low-keyed options. But never mind. It's gradually dawned on me that part of the show's appeal is how preposterous it is.

""Lucas Hood"" is one of those laconic, hard-boiled characters. Antony Starr brings a super-charged presence to the screen. He's a good-looking bloke and he's got this amazing physicality, but what really sells him is that he's able to channel this immeasurable pain and sadness in his eyes. This is still Cinemax so the show doesn't shy away from a sexual tone. Hood remains single-minded in his mission to win back his ex-girlfriend (and ex-thief) Anna, never mind that, in Banshee, Anna (Ivana Milicevic) had long ago assumed a new identity as ""Carrie Hopewell"" and become wife to the district attorney and mother to two children. Milicevic and Starr create serious heat together.

Obviously BANSHEE trots out a larger-than-life cast. And because the show gleefully embraces its over-the-top storytelling, we get not one but two malevolent crime lords: the local kingpin (Ulrich Thomsen) with ties to Banshee's Amish community and the deeper-pocketed Ukrainian mob boss (Ben Cross) who is looking real hard for our master thief. Adding tremendous color are Hood's new partners-in-crime: the pragmatic bartender and ex-con Sugar (Frankie Faison) and the foul-mouthed, crossdressing computer hacker Job (Hoon Lee). Don't be too surprised if Job proves to be the show's breakaway character.

Hood's inclination may fall with the other side of the law, but he proves to be a tough and effective sheriff even if he frequently leaves his deputies scratching their heads. When required, Hood doesn't shirk from applying questionable methods to get the job done. He sucks at paperwork. You wonder how much longer he can get away with his impersonation.

Even as the narrative got more absurd as the season progressed - and the presence of Pennsylvania Dutch farmers lends the show a unique flavor - I'm impressed with how good the cast is and even more impressed with the visceral nature of the action sequences. A lot of episodes feature Hood's engaging baddies in brutal fights, and none more rough or more extended than Hood's breathtaking brawl with a sadistic MMA champion in the third episode's climactic sequence. I think that fight - and Starr's committment to that sequence - is what sold me on the show. A brooding figure of authority, cloaked in a badge's respectability, Hood would give all that up in a hearbeat if only he could get the girl. Because it's always been about the girl. Oh, Cinemax, you soft touch, you bastion of lost loves and sweeping romances. But old-schoolers shouldn't fret. Cinemax is also still the bastion of rampant nudity (that's here, too).

5572478,5,B00BC36UBM,"What a home run for Cinemax's first series.  Well written, well acted, good script, lots of action and great nudity.  Can't wait to see this in Blu-Ray!",1365465600,3,152,4.592592592592593
5572479,5,B00BC36UBM,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:

An adrenaline rush from the first scene.  There is no synopsis on Amazon, so I am offering some ad hoc cut/paste from external sources, with some of my own color worked in.

Premise:

""Banshee takes place in the fictional small town of Banshee, Pennsylvania in the an area settled by the Amish. After serving 15 years in prison for stealing diamonds from a Ukrainian gangster called Mr. Rabbit (Ben Cross), with a partner who is also Mr. Rabbit's daughter.  The unnamed protagonist travels to Banshee to find his heist accomplice and former lover, Anastasia. When he finds her, the protagonist learns that she is now a married to the local DA, a mother of two and living under the assumed identity of Carrie Hopewell. Later, when the incoming Sheriff is killed (hired by the local mayor sight un-seen), the protagonist takes on his identity as Lucas Hood, becoming the town's new Sheriff. Banshee sees Hood struggle with adapting to his new identity while dealing with the machinations of local crime lord Kai Proctor (shunned former Amish), and remaining hidden from Rabbit""

Without giving away too much of the plot.  Hoods allies are a former boxer that both serves as his landlord and runs the local drinking establishment and an Asian cross-dresser that is an elite computer hacker.

There are scenes involving, a motorcycle gang, white supremacists, prison battle between Hood and a giant Albino, run of the mill local white trash bad guys, a fight scene at an Indian casino between Hood & an MMA fighter and less not forget, enough sex scenes to make a porn star blush!

Banshee is high octane in the ""Strike Back"" mode.  If you like Shrike Back, I can't imagine that you would not like Banshee.

Already renewed for a 2nd season, I was also excited to see smoking hot/bucket list candidate Odette Annabel added to the cast late in the season, as one of the heirs to the local Indian casino (not to mention pretty good with a gun and hatchet).

My highest recco for an MA action series!",1363910400,28,2015,4.742120343839542

First of all viewers need to know that this is a Cinemax TV series so there will be nudity and language issues.  It has the same flaws as other Hollywood productions where fights last overly long and the people recover fast.  But if I wanted reality I wouldn't be watching a TV show or a movie.

The characters, even the ones that I didn't like, are interesting and develop throughout the season.  There are so many interpersonal relationships that it makes it harder to predict what will happen in the next episode much less three or four episodes down the line.

5572505,4,B00BC36UBM,"I almost skipped this series when viewing the first episode as it showed the lead character besting three armed thugs (in a robbery) as if he was practicing for a ballet tryout! Then shortly after we see him having passionate sex (in flashbacks) with ( I presume) his lover! Then before the episode is over, he beds some of the locals, leaving one to wonder if he is some kind of a  satyr ! I couldn't understand all the sex scenes until it dawned on me he was in prison for 15 years~ Well, you might ask? and the answer is he may have been some cellmate's  'bi**h!' during his incarceration! He must be 35 when this takes place so he was sent to prison in his early 20tte! good looking as hell and a target for some h**ny prisoner! Ergo, he as to reclaim his masculinity and show he is still str8 and hungry for p***y!. I agree with some of the other viewers, too much  gratuitous violence, and like an old fashion wrestling match, he is always shown getting the worse of it and, then, in a flash he recovers and pulverizes  the baddies! I think Starr's charisma makes his character appealing as an antihero type and one you can pull for!",1509926400,,1139,4.308411214953271
5572506,2,B00BC36UBM,"How utterly boring!  Even if you disregard the implausibility (which isn't that hard), it's just not interesting.  I mean, if you like little boy fantasies about a guy who wins every fight (even against four men or two men with guns) and sleeps with every woman, I guess it might be your kind of thing.  But it's really very boring.  If the humour were played up a little, it would work great, but as it is, everything is just a trope.  Just-released X-con gets out of jail and looks for his loot, ending up in the town where his former girlfriend is now living a clean life with a straight husband and two kids.  X-con of course wants her back (while he's bedding every other female he sees).  The bad guys attack but he beats them all.  My hero!  Pleeeeeeeeze!  A complete snore.

Also, any oath involving Pennsylvania would read ""The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania"" not ""The State of Pennsylvania"".  And the Amish angle is just too trite.  Skip this one.  Even the action isn't that good.",1509494400,,989,4.545454545454546
5572507,2,B00BC36UBM,"Are you serious???!!!!!  This is the most unrealistic story I have ever watched.  From what I did see it had an intriguing story line unfolding, but then there was the hook; repetitive, gratuitous porn (which begs the question; why is there never a Full Monty?) and violence.
As far as the cast goes, thank goodness that the Russian had a spider tat on his neck because he is defiantly the sheriffs real-life doppelganger.  I could not tell them apart at times.  Not to mention that a couple of the women looked so much the same with the same hair styles; long, stringy and in their faces.  I kept checking the X-ray to see whos who.
For me, the best of the unrealistic scenes is in Ep 8 (Season 1) when Carrie, an approximately 110-pound (I would guess) woman, gets in a major knock-down, drag-out with Olek (the Russian with the spider ink) who would easily weigh in at around 200 pounds.  Olek got in some serious blows and throws, and Carrie kept getting up.  Again, are you serious???!!!!  Defiantly a guy fantasy story.",1505260800,,1025,4.562841530054645

It is like watching an unpleasant ex-girlfriend at times. There is an interesting premise underneath the story, which is quite reminiscent of ""The Americans"" except that every issue is a personal issue and not one of greater significance (that shouldn't be taken as advocating The Americans). Sometimes I say, ""I wish it could be more believeable,"" but that is actually not the problem. I'm happy to suspend disbelief. The problem is ""I wish it would be more pointed.""

Seriously, there is no realism in stuff like that, plus the fact every real law enforcement person, to include the FBI, cannot figure out this dude is an ex-con.  Come on!!

5572521,5,B00BC36UBM,"I thought this would not be interesting, because everyone who recommended it dwelled upon the violence and sex. There sure is a lot of both, but the violence is choreographed so well, it's almost like watching a brutal ballet. There's a ton of plot, both an over-arching one and multiple subplots, some of which are resolved within each episode and others which take several episodes to conclude. In that respect, it reminds me of the old TV series Hill Street Blues. This series makes for great binge watching. ""Lucas Hood"" is not the real name of the protagonist, but we never learn the real identity of the ex-con who rolls into a small Pennsylvania town and finds himself taking over the identity of a newly arrived - and murdered - sheriff. For a small town in a bucolic countryside, surrounded by Amish farmers and an Indian reservation, there's an amazing amount of crime. The local crime lord, Kai Proctor, is a former Amishman. He has a sinister henchman who looks exactly like a psychopath in a neat suit, bowtie and glasses. Any time you see him removing his glasses, you know body parts are about to be dismembered. The overall plot involves Carrie, Hood's former girlfriend. The minute he gets out of prison, he tracks her down, only to find her living a peaceful life with an ex-Marine husband, a rebellious Goth daughter, and a son afflicted with terrible asthma. She has dreadful secrets, which is why she's been in hiding for fifteen years, and Hood's appearance brings them up. In the meantime, Proctor's in cahoots with the Indian chief, who is building a casino, the tiny police department is housed in a former used car dealership, and the new ""sheriff"" has his hands full...and generally uses his fists, a gun, and any other object handy to deal out justice, if not law.

As sherif he beats up the ""bad guys,"" messes with other people's lives, works waaaaaaaay outside the law and canNOT keep his zipper zipped.

The first episode is a bit slow to start off, but then the season gets into high gear and never stops.  This series is one where I'm going back to rewatch as it was that entertaining.  Now, don't get me wrong, there is as much sex as you would expect from a Cinemax show, but even if they cut those parts out, it would be really enjoyable.",1484092800,,515,4.389473684210526

5572982,2,B00BC36UBM,"It's well written, but all the usual insults to your intelligence are there. Everyone is a martial arts expert, almost every main character apparently worked for a modeling agency at one point (you know, just like real life) and genius transvestite hacker who can do absolutely anything. In every situation when someone is about to get killed, someone always shows up out of nowhere to save the day. Lots of gratuitous violence and sex, the main character bangs everything with two legs. I know he's a good looking guy, but give me a break? A proverbial bad guy with an accent, because accents make them so much more badass, you know. This show is overreaching on the characters, I would be just as entertained if they all weren't too good to be true. Anyway, if you don't mind all this then give it a try.

Then coming back into the future.  I continue to watch the series to try to grasp at straws but it didn't work at all.  The show is like a whore fest in my opinion with the Amish gangster and the captain of police office screwing all kinds of women.  Just two much for me.

There's no way any of this could happen in today's day and age, but man, it's fun watching! This series is action packed, has twists and turns, and even if some are beacons that can be seen from a mile away, the surprise violence is always a shocker. Seriously, without going into any spoilers or details, this is a must-watch if you miss 90's action flicks. This reminds of The Shield when it was still good. The main character is trying to do good, but he keeps getting thrown into one mess after another. And the way he solves his messes? Well, they aren't orthodox or believable, and that makes this show great! If I want 100% believability, I'll watch the grass grow.

Also, these short escapades where Sheriff Hood and his 'gang of 4' go gallivanting, breaking the law for some dinero, and then him pretending he knows nothing about it, just doesn't pass muster as being realistic. However, athough the Amish and Indian connections are an exciting positive, to iterate, hopefully there won't be that continual violence and huge bloodshed.  If it was real, the Sheriff would have been a permanentvegetable in the hospital, undoubtedly with his teeth gone due to all the incessant fighting.

5573480,4,B00BC36UBM,"I only recently jumped on the Banshee bandwagon. And since watching the first three episodes of Banshee coincided with my watching the first three episodes of HBO's new Westworld series, I found myself comparing the two. And Banshee provides the more enjoyable ride. It's more fun and it has better action, sex, and dark humor.  It's also a better Western.
  Although it's set in a small town in modern-day Amish Country, there's more Western motifs and archetypes than you can shake a Colt Peacemaker at.  Like Clint Eastwood's man with no name, the anti-hero of Banshee first rides into town alone, albeit on an iron horse rather than a jackass.  Also like Clint, he possesses particularly unique violent skills and realizes that corruption + chaos equals opportunity. So he moves in above a saloon and quickly assumes the role of town sheriff.  What I presume will become the central conflict of the series is established shortly thereafter; an updated take on sheriff versus corrupt land baron. Only in this case, the land baron is the towns wealthiest and most evil individual; a former Amish man who is now the head of a crime family and Meatpacking business.
  Elements from crime and action films are also updated and/or given interesting twists in Banshee. Series lead Antony Starr is very good at playing the anti-hero and Ulrich Thomsen as the former Amish man turned mob butcher is a stand-out. From what I've seen so far it's not over reaching either.  Most of all this is fun engaging television and should appeal to anyone who enjoys action films, crime dramas, or westerns.",1477267200,,1589,4.877323420074349

5573541,3,B00BC36UBM,"Not a cartoon as the advertisement suggests .Also, it doesn't have anything to do with the Celtic legend of a screaming woman who leads people to their deaths (except there is a hint of a symbolic link between a banshee and the story of the show.).  I read the description of this show a while  ago and thought it might be good, but the pic used along with the description looks like a cartoon. I didn't want to see a cartoon so I just kept overlooking it when browsing through Amazon Prime Video. Today I finally decided to scroll down & saw that the pic next to pilot showed real people. So, I finally decided to try watching it.

There is too much gratuitous sex, and probably more violence than necessary to advance the story, but so far, after just one episode, I am intrigued enough to want to see at least one more episode.  If I decide it deserves higher than three stars, I will come back and update my review. If I my opinion stays the same after the second episode, I probably won't watch the rest.

8565776,5,B00BC36UBM,"Sex, explosions, super cool, likeable, developed characters, graphic violence, and and a preposterous sub plot....  what is not to love..  this show is awesome.  It's the biggest budget mid budget show you'll see.  addictive and extremely good, the fighting and violence is top notch.  Ears flyin, show it all blood and guts man.  A+.... the sex is bomb!  One side note.  There is sexual violation in the show.  Nothing like Spit on your grave or anything.  But, it's the one thing on screen I personally cannot stomach well. It is implied in a few episodes.  However, it was used as the center of the plot and the dude got his... and that's what this shows about, it's like a really well made walking tall, every episode..... consistent writing too.  Thanks for the show! it's got everything a man can want...  and this is a nice way to get your mind off the hideous B-anus in the white house.  Who just ruined your economy and censored your internet...  yea trump isn't in this show  :))",1529712000,,989,4.597701149425287
8565777,1,B00BC36UBM,"Based on another reviewer's advice I stuck with this thru the 2nd episode. Wished I hadn't. There are so many things wrong with this production I hardly know where to begin. Let's take a look at our prison system. Recent movies/series would have us believe that everyone released from the slahmmer is: muscular (very likely true), can steal a car and out race a pursuer thru mid day traffic in NYC without maiming/killing any pedestrians, then then hop on a motorcycle and make a get-away. Do we now give bike riding classes in our lock-ups. We also have to believe that the gun man chasing our ex-con can miss shooting him 20 feet away with a frontal shot.

Then we have to go along with the ex-con happening to meet a stranger that is on his way to be sworn in as the new sheriff in the town of Banshee. Fortunately for the story line this person gets killed so our ex-con can assume his identity in the town he wants to to. Talk about blind luck. He should be buying lottery tickets.

Then, at the police stations, as the ex-con is being introduced to the police staff, a feisty, female deputy hauls in a local miscreant all by her little old self. Can we guess who she will be boinking sometime in the future?

And speaking of boinking. The ex-con waists no time in finding someone to boink. Not saying that a guy that's been inside for awhile wouldn't jump the first female he encounters, but I don't need to see the details. They are nothing unusual, in today's productions and don't further the story in any way. There quickly follows other incidents of the sexual kind that are as explicit as allowed but not necessary for any reason. I'm pretty sure we all know what prostitutes do and the various ways people can have sex.

In conclusion, I don't care about any of these characters and see nothing new to learn about them. There are some good cops, some bad rich people, a few people who are trying to hide their pasts and a smattering of towns people. A native American father and son were introduced but I'm not going to stick around to find out what their purpose, if any, is in this plot.",1528588800,,2102,4.423772609819121

8565780,5,B00BC36UBM,"Ok, I've read many of the reviews.  SPOILERS AHEAD.

One of the main season 1 issues for many is when Carrie/Anna sets up Sheriff Hood to be killed by her father late in the season.  To some, it made no sense.  To me, Carrie knew that with her ex around, her family was in major peril from her father.  Her negotiation with her father, comes after a great deal of pleading that Hood leave town.  Even though Hood is the father of Deva, Hood is destroying Carrie's world.  So, I buy this plot.

The violence is cartoonish, over-the-top extremely well done.  I watched all four years, and some over-the-air dramas bother me much more in their violence than this show.  I think it has to do with our main characters are extremely talented and extremely lucky.  I understand the many comments that this isn't REAL.  But, this town has the worst collection of human beings in a modest sized county seat in the United States.  It's unreal that there are so many abandoned parts of town for the bad guys to use as temp drug making, temp torture zones and all around temp homeless encampments.  To enjoy this is to embrace this fantastical world.  Once, that is done, people have to accept that good and bad are relative to the situation.  Even Burton/Bowtie and Proctor do the right thing every once in a while.  And, once you see what the police are up against, one could say that Hood is exactly what needs to respond to this world.

Highlights of the show are the characters.  I think Job, is both great and a problem.  Job is extremely watchable, an original character who truly plays the god like roll, deus ex machina.  He maybe the best, but getting that much done through a laptop, in such a short time, knowing almost all systems that exist and entering them in seconds is just part of this universe.  If Hoon Lee was not one of the stand out characters in this show, his beyond acme hacker status would be unforgivable.  But, he is that good.

I like the non-real mix of the environment.  I'm talking about the Amish, a rust belt town, the Indian reservation, the Satan worshipers, the nearby Ukrainian mob, the neo-nazis, the bikers and the ex-Amish mixing all together.  I'm ok that there isn't a place where this all mixes in America.  This made up town in a made up Pennsylvania works a great for four seasons.  I'll will be forever wide eyed when someone says in a hushed tone: ""Shhhhhh...."".

I've already beat to death the issue of violence in this show, but there a lot of pretty graphic sex.  To me the amount of sex depicted is appropriate, because you would never understand the DL relationships with Hood that existed, without the scenes.  The degrees of a quality sexual relationship played a significant roll in the storyline.  Did the sex go too far?  For some people, I'm sure it did.

All in all, I have been thrilled watching the whole story arc.  I'll probably rewatch this over not too far in the future.  This was great to watch a second time.  One of the great shows that was on cable.",1521417600,,3010,4.487084870848708
