That one is very poplar in both France and the U.S. according to the French and the Americans I've talked to.  It's what I thought I was getting when I ordered this movie.  My mistake.

This The Intouchable is about the grown daughter of an unmarried French woman.  The daughter learns her father is Indian (Asian), so she travels to India to find him.  I think I'm not giving anything away by saying that he's of the untouchable caste in India--the film's title is The Untouchable afterall.  The movie shows the daughter's experiences in India.  It's in both English and French, with English subtitles.",1346371200,,698,4.758333333333334
8256550,1,B0014XP1UQ,"What to say about this self-indulgent, uninteresting film? It has the intellectual sophistication of an undergraduate film-school project that is trying to be profound and just comes off trite.  Worst of all, it provides an inaccurate and shallow picture of India and its culture.

If you are, as the main character in the film - a self-absorbed, 20 something who wallows incessantly in your own emotional states - you might find this film interesting.

As someone who has lived in India and who has many Indian friends, I was particularly concerned about the social interactions and imperialistic outlook, which could potentially misguide foreign travelers in India.  For example, her Indian ""brother"" never would have taken the girl's hand, especially at a wedding - his sister's wedding, no less.  Indian men are not supposed to touch other women (not saying they never do ... just that they would not do it at a family wedding!).  Also, it is highly doubtful the mom would have allowed the father to be alone in a room with the girl after she fainted.  Very unlikely scenario.  And the scene where the servant girl told the woman - a white European woman - to disrobe ... would never happen.  The director, script writers and actors put a French flavor into their interpretation of India that I found irksome.  In short, watch this film if you want to learn more about the French culture, not the Indian culture!  ;)",1234656000,2,1420,4.8264462809917354
8256551,2,B0014XP1UQ,"THE UNTOUCHABLE requires patience on the part of the viewer - patience to stay with this sullen, dark and clunky film to the end only to discover the wait was not worth the patience!  Writer/director Benot Jacquot had a good idea: trace the search for a biological father to a country foreign to the seeker.  What results instead of a journey of self-discovery is a travelogue to India as captured by a hand held camera with what appears to be a minuscule budget.

Jeanne (Isild Le Besco) discovers on her eighteenth birthday that her mother (Brangre Bonvoisin) conceived her on the banks of the Ganges River in India with an Indian man who remains unknown.  Furious at her mother's secret and feeling the profound need to connect with her biological father, Jeanne, an actress, leaves her acting workshop to make a racy film in order to make enough money to travel to India.  Once in India she searches for traces of her father without success.  But the search is not without some interest for the viewer: the hand held camera that follows her through the airport and the countryside and to Benares (that city by the Ganges where the dead are cremated in elaborate fashion and the living bathe in the waters of the holy river).  She gathers clues as to her father's identity from friendly strangers, but alas, the riddle remains unsolved.

Isild Le Besco is in practically every frame of this film and she indeed is an interesting actress to watch.  But the lack of intelligent dialogue prevents this film from revealing motivations or character development, opting instead for a static (and rather poorly edited and scored) glance at the mysteries of India.  For those interested in watching in detail the preparation of bodies for cremation and the slow act of that ritual, this is a film worth watching.  For the casual viewer it is tedious.
