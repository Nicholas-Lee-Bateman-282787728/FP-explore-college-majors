[The gasoline prices and automobiles date this movie.] Arlo brings a donkey to the gathering. After the feast the garbage was taken to the town dump. [Do they still have these?] But the town dump was closed for Thanksgiving. So they dumped it at another place. Somebody reported this to the police. Officer Obie called Arlo, an envelope with his name on it was found under the garbage. They are arrested and taken to the scene of the crime. Littering is a crime. [Not a joke.] Alice bailed them out, their friends meet them outside. They plead guilty, were fined $25, and had to pick up the garbage. [No seat belts in cars.]

Not really.

The song ran for 18 minutes, this adaption runs for over 100 minutes. Which was better? The movie is not as good as the song; your opinion may differ. Would you watch this movie twice? Its like a documentary about life and attitudes circa 1969 for some people. What did they accomplish?",1488067200,,2764,4.55533199195171
