4498949,2,B004YCKJOM,"I really thought this was a waste of my money and time.  Forced myself to watch it.  It was like watching myself do a ghost hunt with no clue what I was doing.  The filming was subpar and the editing more so.  The running of cop car or whatever (most of the time you didn't have any idea what anything  was) thru the streets actually made me nauseous.  I am sorry for whoever did this thing but YIKES!  Certainly not what I would have spent my $$$ on.  They didn't even give you a good idea where the places were, what the history was and those ""psychics"" ""sensitives"", or whatever ....SERIOUSLY???  I am more convincing than that when I'm trying to talk my way out of a ticket.  But I can cry on demand.",1369094400,10,704,4.186567164179104
4498950,2,B004YCKJOM,"I have seen many paranornal shows and enjoy watching but unfortunatly this one did not really catch my total attention.  Especially how the volumn adjust way more then it should, EVP's were hard to understand and jumping around too much from place to place.  It is broken down to 4 sections and #3 is the one that I thought was the worst.",1362614400,6,338,4.435483870967742

Maybe it's wrong of me to judge these so harshly after enjoying the first season of American Horror Story so much, but Ghost Stories are straight from the Museum of The Hard to Believe. Empty. Their EVP guy uses a microcassette recorder, and they show a handheld recorder with a TDK D cassette in it, as well. No wonder there are so many anomalies! It's funny because I'm sure they would argue that the cheap equipment is best for recording voices. Also, the ""Sixth Sense Boy"" who takes pictures of ""orbs""; You've got dust particles, genius. He has a tattoo of a Honda logo on his neck -- Not sure how seriously I can take him after a decision like that. Ghost Stories 4 gets an extra star solely because of the messed up picture of the murderer.",1361318400,13,947,4.411428571428571

4498954,2,B004YCKJOM,"well theres 1 ol lady named Judy on the show that is obviously fake & over drama, an ol man that has 31 cats & I think most of the ppl on here have a mental disability, lol. But really, mostly its about afew places they check out, no1 has professional equiptment or know what their doing. Small investigations, mostly relying on the few that seem like their crazy to me. Its pretty boring. Not what I exspected & am very dissapointed. Gave it only 2 stars cuz I had nothing to watch anyways & it was there. Anticipated gettingthis dvd now that Ive seen it, wish I hadnt. Feels like I got ripped off. Anybody can get a camera & go around looking in the dark. The vision & sound on the dvd sucks. Seriously, take my advice, from a professional paranormal investigator, researcher & psychic, this dvd is a waste of time & money :(",1360368000,3,827,4.273885350318471
4498955,3,B004YCKJOM,"The investigators in these episodes tend to seek out ghosts rather than to try to prove or disprove anything. I really don't like that technique. You should always try to make the evidence as credible as possible and not base evidence on ""feelings"" or popular belief.",1358121600,2,267,4.826086956521739

8448145,1,B004YCKJOM,"I hate this because the camera handlers wouldn't hold the cameras still for longer than 3 seconds-they jerked the cameras up and down, left and right, in and out; It was difficult to focus on anything. Once my eyes got something in focus, it was jerked away. I was getting motion sickness from all of it. Whoever those camera handlers were-I think they should go back to school and learn how to handle cameras smoothly. I know they jerk the cameras for increased effect, but it only makes the program unwatchable.",1446508800,4,513,4.648351648351649
