6062044,4,B00G7A5VYC,The story line was ok and the acting is not bad. Could have more depth with other characters. But enjoyed the movie. Good for a rental.,1397779200,,135,4.230769230769231
6062045,3,B00G7A5VYC,"Bloodline isn't a bad indie flick. The main problem is with the writing and how the Native American curse was developed or rather the lack of developement.
The story is about a native hate curse placed upon the early white settlers for stealing their land and murdering their people. A pendant is given to a white settler (Ethos) by the shaman he shoots to end the curse (doesn't make sense). The pendant is passed down to its current owner Brett Ethos who is a lost sole (suffering from nightmares) after loosing both of his parents 3 years before. Brett is just a few days away from taking his vows to become a priest when some old friends arrive and want to have a little fun.
One of his friends accidentally drops a picture and discovers a hidden map, deed and a set of keys to his grandfathers cabin while in the attic of Bretts home. The gang wants to check it out, but Brett is dead set against it, but gives in. Bretts exgirlfriend is invited without his knowledge or consent and adds to the tension.
Strange things start to happen before they even arrive at the cabin and Brett seems to be at the center of all the goings on and he also seems to be holding back on what he does or doesn't know. Now you have a pretty good idea of what this story is about without giving to much away.
As I stated earlier the writing and the lack of development of just what this curse is and how to stop it if it can be stopped leaves a lot to be desired.
The camers work is pretty good and the acting was all over the place from bad to decent. The direction was also spotty and inconsistent. The director was not getting even performances from the cast nor was the fright scenes very well executed.
Two and at times three of Bretts friends are just plain annoying throughout the movie and left me not caring one way or another if they lived or died. Brett's performance as the lead was wooden and hurts the story somewhat along with the writing and direction.
There is some foul language with a few F words, but overall not to bad. There is a non nude sex scene along with some drinking. The blood/gore is kept to a minimum with a decent head shot wound, but other than that not much of anything for this movie.",1397347200,12,2204,4.287769784172662

6062050,5,B00G7A5VYC,"It is a refreshing take on the old, ""going to the cabin in the woods for the weekend,"" horror movie. I highly recommend it.  It is worth the time invested for a few chuckles, a few, ""made you jump's,"" and a few creepy moments. I've read the negative reviews and all I can say is, ""Really people?""  It isn't supposed to be taken that seriously!  There is no intent to seek an Academy Award here!  It is a B horror movie!  Yes, there are unanswered questions.  Yes, there are a couple of plot holes.  Yes, there are a couple of weak moments in the script. And, YES, it is a fun movie.  If you want a major multi-million dollar Hollywood production, this isn't it.  If you are wanting a very enjoyable, edge of your seat, things that go bump in your cabin but differently than the others horror flick, this one is for you.",1488326400,,819,4.266233766233766

6062066,1,B00G7A5VYC,"poor acting, plot, well actually everything. i like this kind of movie, but the plot/action always hinges on the characters doing something stupid so they can be killed off. Don't go outside, killer is out there. Yep, character runs outside and is killed. One character inexplicably walks off into wood following a dog. Why? Who knows. the usual helpless girls, who can only cry and collapse into a useless pile of emotions. Some kind of mysterious curse going on that the character won't talk about except to say "" Grandfather said not to come to this cabin ever"".  So of course he does and brings his friends........ Slow unfolding of story with the usual stereotypes, the back woods hick, the silent thoughtful indian, stupid arrogant city folk.....

6062076,2,B00G7A5VYC,"I could have let some of the weak script go if it really didn't completely kill it in the end.  The whole movie was a waste.  Who wants to watch a movie where NOTHING is concluded, it was like the movie ended at a dead stop half way through the story, extremely disappointing.  Some reviewers were right in some points they made about the dim witted blonde wanting to know why a phone in a cabin that hasn't been used for decades does not work, really?  I wonder.  Your lead to believe most of the movie that the main character has deep faith and then looses it.  He didn't have it for long before the movie, found it again at the end and I suspect lost it a minute later.  The legend of the curse is so flimsy I can barely explain what it is and why especially would the Indians make such a terrible curse that affects them too and leave it in the hands of the white man, their enemy, to end?  If your going to make a curse aren't you going to have the way to stop it yourself, not make a curse that can only be stopped by your enemy.  So many things in the movie were half done, changed part way through or just not even thought of.  The so called park ranger, was he a park ranger or not, was he there to help them or not.  The movie claims both sides with no clear indication of what is actually the truth.  This has got to be one of the most infuriatingly frustrating movies with no conclusion to be heard of in that I have ever seen.  Save your sanity and skip.",1476489600,,1467,4.052083333333333

6062082,3,B00G7A5VYC,This is a typical horror flick. It had some scary moments but overall was pretty predictable. The characters behaved as usual acting stupid and silly getting themselves in situations that leave you scratching your head. But the story line and the action kept my interest throughout the movie so I give it an okay rating.,1475884800,,320,4.836363636363636
6062083,2,B00G7A5VYC,"This had the makings of a really good indie horror film and somehow it ended up pulling all the stops in relating its story. A man who is soon to be ordained has serious troubles dealing with his faith and the developing situation. He is apparently part of a bloodline that stems from an past attack on Native Americans. The ""curse"" of the bloodline apparently turns people who have been killed in ghastly ways into murderous zombies. So many tropes are used: the cabin in the woods, girls in bikinis, sex, the impending doom outside, everyone getting picked off by some evil force, people being chased and then tripping and falling down, etc. to incredible tedium. The protagonist seems clueless even though he chooses to be the leader to fight this evil and has sound plans that are of course, thwarted. That keeps the energy and fear level up. But it is monotonous and repetitive. For instance, I can not count the times that someone says, ""Get back in the cabin!"" It actually is supposed to be a safe haven and then that pendant that has something to do with saving everyone from the deaths. But the dead don't stay dead. Yet this is not your usual zombie flick. It just takes too many turns and is never developed into a reasonable plot. The actors are also grade-B performers. I can not recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a new and fresh horror film about yet another cabin in the woods with sex and violence.",1475712000,7,1429,4.542635658914729

6062087,2,B00G7A5VYC,"It has some nice vfx and decent acting, but the writing handicaps everything. I wasn't expecting a cerebral masterpiece, but there are so many plot holes you can't help but notice even if you're just trying to have fun. The film lures you in with a promising story and isn't able to tie it together during the second half. This isn't a case where just the ending doesn't make sense (although it doesn't). The entire second half is kind of a mess of running, nonsensical decisions by the characters, and wildly inconsistent lore. That's a shame since I already had pretty low expectations going in that it still managed to disappoint. I hate talking bad about things cos it's clear people put a lot of work into this. Unfortunately, I was super frustrated by their efforts. I really hope if they have a chance to continue this story that it's treated with more care.

There is macho man with his half naked girlfriend on his arm  and the over weight guy  watching porn and making fun of others as he can't get a date.

There is an attempt here to incorporate an appreciable degree of intelligent character and plot development but of course there are the usual convenient logic gaps.
Overall the acting is good and some of these actors show real promise. It's paced well and the there isn't any inane filler type scenes.

6062173,1,B00G7A5VYC,"The premise of this movie is standard:  Young people stranded in a cabin in the woods for the weekend where some evil thing visits itself upon them.  A couple of over-heated chicks and a morbidly obese character to play out a series of fat-jokes for comic relief; only there's no tension to be relieved from.  One would have to care about some person or some outcome to the plot to get tense.
  The hero of the picture has inherited the property from deceased family along with a legendary evil thing that we are introduced to at the beginning of the picture.  As a further twist, he is supposed to be ordained a Deacon in his church the following Monday.  So, a part of the plot is that the other couple has invited one of his old girl friends to come along to convince him that the sins of the flesh are more enticing than the Kingdom of Heaven.
  The acting is adequate enough to advance the plot but the story-line is full of flaws and improbabilities that interfere even in an atmosphere of voluntary suspension of disbelief.  Save your popcorn for something else.",1405209600,4,1069,4.492227979274611

6062185,3,B00G7A5VYC,I agree with the most helpful critical review- the flick needs an iron supplement. I mean the elements were all there There was nothing really wrong with it. The production values were solid. The story was interesting and injected some novelty into a supernatural theme we've seen before. It presented the story well visually. But I felt the pull of boredom while watching it. I had to fight it off. That should NOT have been the case with everything I just said. The story line is my cup of tea. It was executed well. What happened? Someone should take another crack at this. Its got serious potential.,1400889600,2,603,4.644859813084112

6062189,3,B00G7A5VYC,"I liked the acting, and aside from horror movies with a lot of screaming and running, there was sort of a sub-plot about a young man's sour attitude towards religion.  So then, he tells a girl that life is nothing but chance and luck. I wondered why he bothered to go in a seminary for the priesthood.  He holds the secret to some real horror. It's up to the reader of the reviews if they want to spend time and money watching this movie. The ending was the kind that leaves one hanging, wanting more.",1400112000,2,501,4.2631578947368425

6062193,2,B00G7A5VYC,"Honestly the best part of this movie is the music that plays during the ending credits.

But before you get to that you have to sit through a movie that insults your intelligence from one scene to the next.  After reaching the cabin for the first time one of the female characters picks up a phone and tries it just to claim it doesn't work. Shes surprised that the phone doesn't work in a cabin that the main character, in all his years on earth had never been to and had been warned explicitly to never visit, one whose very existence is hidden away behind an old picture in a packed off attic. Yet, miraculously, the cabin is fairly updated inside with still working electricity. Whos keeping up maintenance on the house? The main character is the last remaining member of his family, so whos paying the bills? Theres no dust or cobwebs, though one female character makes a token effort at sweeping the same spot for about 5 mins straight.

The director should have hired better actors and the writers should have spent more time trying to write a better script instead of jotting down a half thought-out storyline on a piece of napkin and spending the remaining time trying to make one poor joke after another in an effort to make the most obnoxious characters ever. You could probably watch this on mute and miss nothing story-wise. Thats how little the dialogue adds to the film. The main characters faith is poorly handled and ham-fisted and serves as a flimsy and easily thrown away plot point. A very important character doesn't even show up until more than half-way through the movie and lasts less than 5 mins, really, less time than it took for the one character to mime sweeping the already clean floors in the beginning. They surely don't miss a thing when it comes to the bad horror movie checklist. They even have the spit hawking, backwards, chauvinistic, hick characterone the writers try to make into a red herring (unsuccessfully) and whose motives or knowledge are never explained.

I watch syfy original movies all the time and I love watching bad horror movies so if you have the time to kill I wouldn't warn against watching this film just know this movie is definitely not worth it's baffling 4 star rating. If however, you only watch a couple of movies a week, I wouldn't recommend wasting your choice with this one.",1398988800,6,2342,4.636144578313253

6062195,2,B00G7A5VYC,"I'm really not one to write very many movie reviews, and I really didn't watch the whole movie because I'm really not one who appreciates self-abuse that much either.  I found this movie to be poorly written with poor acting, and very poor characters.  Yes, it's an ""indie"" movie, or what I call ""low budget"", and glaring-ly so.  About the only good thing about it was that the female actors were stunningly beautiful, however beauty fades but it hardly makes up for the deficiencies in plot, character development, writing, and lack of acting skill.  Perhaps with a well-written script, these actors would be absolutely brilliant, but NO actor can do much with a story which simply makes no logical sense, lame writing, and flat characters.  Those who praised this movie must have been well paid to do that and probably didn't watch it!  Save yourself and watch something, almost ANYthing else.",1398556800,7,895,4.894039735099338

Like a sucker I fell for it. In the middle of watching it I was so bored, I had to sit back & take a break & started reading other peoples reviews. Somebody said that they had trouble sleeping so they got up, started watching Bloodline & fell asleep a few minutes later. So funny yet true. I didn't fall asleep that fast, I fell asleep after 30 minutes. Instead of turning it off & watching something else, I fell asleep, woke up, rewinded it, fell asleep, woke up, rewinded it & repeated a few times. It did start out decent enough but after awhile it became just another demon/evil spirit jumping from body to body movie. Bloodline is a movie I'd only recommend watching if you're fiending for a Horror movie  & you have no other choices.
