8615318,4,B00FFL7W3W,Good source of information and techniques.  The models who do the demos are obviously porn stars so their attributes and abilities will eclipse the average.  It's still useful,1456704000,3,175,5.214285714285714

8615321,1,B00FFL7W3W,"I love Tristans other 2 instructional videos, but this one was a Big Turn Off for me, just looked like typical porn guys love, and did not make me want to try anything covered in the video.  Gag....",1360368000,,198,4.2105263157894735
8615322,3,B00FFL7W3W,"I bought this as a companion to the first video. There are some real strong tips and pointers in this video. We learned how to improve some of our techniques. However all of the actors were professional actors, thus the acting was too ""aggressive"". The first film things were sensual and caring. In this film the scenes were not very sensual nor erotic. Consequently we weren't too impressed by the film.",1356912000,3,404,4.704225352112676
8615323,5,B00FFL7W3W,"Tristan Taormino's expert guide to fellatio, tells, and shows you, in a detailed and thorough way, pretty much everything you need to know about this subject.

If you're lacking at all in confidence in this area of your intimate life, and need either affirmation or instruction, so you can feel you're on the right track, or, if you're just looking for some extra tips and tricks to add to your repertoire, you will get it with this DVD!

It's open and honest so you can really get a feel for what Tristan, and the actors, are talking about and demonstrating. These qualities in general are why I'm such a big fan of Tristan's experts guide DVD series, and this one definitely delivers on that front too.

The DVD approaches this subject from a variety of angles. Starting out with a nice refresher course on the key hotspots of male anatomy, how to get started, and then moving onto a comprehensive review of basic techniques, including a question and answer section with everyday women, covering some common concerns that women may have, but don't usually get the chance to ask about.

And after that? Well, the viewer is taken through a variety of examples including different styles for different moods, important things to keep in mind, and some of the more complex and tricky practices if you feel like adding an extra dimension.

Seriously, when you add in the cast interviews at the end of the DVD, you really do have the feeling that no stone has been left unturned, all that's left for you to do is try it out for yourself if you want to!",1349568000,4,1548,4.594202898550725
