5899350,5,B00E9HPV4U,Great update on 3 people important to the mission of Divine Mercy. Only disappointment is that the movie is older so stops before Pope John Paul II is canonized.,1398470400,,161,4.586206896551724
5899351,5,B00E9HPV4U,"This is a very impressive and well done film.  I was not expecting much, but it really was inspirational and interesting to learn how three people living in a single country became such powerful channels for the Holy Spirit.  Highly recommend.",1393286400,7,243,4.902439024390244
5899352,5,B00E9HPV4U,"A very well researched and presented documentary on 3 Polish saints (JPII come May 2014). The theme of mercy resonated through each segment. Although each saint was richly portrayed the segment on Maximillian Kolbe proved to be the most striking. A great choice of eyewitnesses, particularly those present at Auschwitz (1941), provided remarkable dimension to Kolbe. Next in quality was the segment on JPII, particularly as regarded the Turkish (would be) assassin. The segment on Faustina should have given less attention to a miraculous cure and more attention to Faustina's character. Still, a very high quality documentary.",1390089600,4,627,5.474226804123711
5899353,5,B00E9HPV4U,"Poland was the epicenter of the Holocaust, and for believers this film provides an invaluable glimpse into God's providential response to that horror, set in motion many decades before it occurred and blossoming into fulfillment decades after it ended. God's response to that merciless slaughter of innocents was to reveal His own inexhaustible mercy. The film tells the story of three Poles: Helena Kowalska, (now St. Faustina), August 25, 1905  October 5, 1938; Saint Maximilian Maria Kolbe, January 8, 1894  August 14, 1941; and Karol Jzef Wojtya (Pope John Paul II), May 18, 1920  April 2, 2005, culminating in Pope John Paul II's announcement in his homily at the canonization of St. Faustina on April 30, 2000 of the establishment of the Feast of the Divine Mercy to be celebrated on the Second Sunday of Easter throughout the Church, called ""Divine Mercy Sunday."" These events also led to the fulfillment of the Blessed Virgin Mary's request to the children In her third apparition at Fatima, Portugal, on July 13 1917: ""When you recite the Rosary, say at the end of each decade: Oh My Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, and lead all souls to Heaven, especially those in most need of Your Mercy."" Would it ever occur to any human person to ask Jesus to lead especially the worst sinners among us to heaven?",1388534400,10,1338,4.783549783549783
5899354,4,B00E9HPV4U,"Ocean of Mercy: Three Lives- One Vision - No Limits is a 65 minute documentary on the genesis of the Devotion to the Divine Mercy. However instead of dealing solely on the revelation to Saint Faustina Kowalska, this documentary goes a step further, involving two other persons, namely Saint Maximilian Kolbe and soon to be Saint John Paul II. It gives a much broader perspective of the unfolding of this monumental devotion, with Poland being its epicenter.

This documentary can be separated into 3 Parts; that of Saint Faustina Kowalska, where we see the history of her life, the abject poverty she came from, her spirituality, calling to her religious vocation and the message of the Divine Mercy revealed to her. The same pattern is used for both Saint John Paul II and Saint Maximillian Kolbe. With the latter we learn about his own mystical visions, his great devotion to the Immaculate Conception, his establishment of the Militia of the Immaculate and his ultimate sacrifice at Auswitcz. And in Saint John Paul II, with the above mentioned hagiography we see the fulfillment of the establishing of this said devotion.

Amazingly, these 3 persons, who were so instrumental would never meet, yet separated from each other by a few miles, but united in a strong faith and love of God and neighbor and nation.

This documentary is rich in history and with rare photographs, camera footage and great interviews with peoples who knew these Saints personally and who were greatly affected by the witness of their lives.

My disappointment is that this particular edition though it be a 2013 version has not been updated since the late 90's. Hence we do not see anything about St. Faustina's canonization or the beatification of John Paul II, which, considering the impending circumstances of the latter's canonization, would have been an added plus.

This DVD does NOT have any special features, subtitles or chapter/scene selections

I recommend this DVD to any person who has a devotion to the Divine Mercy, as a wonderful source of following it from its infancy to its glorious triumph.

5899362,5,B00E9HPV4U,"This film is an excellent, brief (roughly and hour and a half) primer on Divine Mercy, and wonderfully highlights three Saints... John Paul II, Maximilian Kolbe, and Maria Faustina -- contemporaries from Poland who never met each other, but all were part of the ""spark from Poland"" that greatly influenced the Catholic face of the 20th Century and beyond.

We used this at our Parish on Divine Mercy Sunday in between the Mass and the 3 pm hour. The people were riveted, and we even had to pull our priest out to begin heading confessions!",1401840000,9,539,4.673684210526316

8602996,3,B00E9HPV4U,"ATTENTION WYD folks...  If you purchased this DVD and it doesn't play, reach out to Ignatius Press, the company who produced this movie. I purchased Ocean of Mercy, Life for Life, and Faustina in preparation for my pilgrimage to Krakow in July, and found that all 3 DVD's wouldn't play.

I tested the DVD's on 2 laptop computers and a media DVD player with the same results. Lets face it, mass producing a CD or DVD will sometimes result in a bad copy or even batch. I've experienced this before and since all 3 DVD's came from the same manufacturer, the risk of receiving 3 more unplayable movies (from Amazon) was pretty high (after all, is it a bad batch of DVD's or are all of my players truly defective).

After speaking to Gene with Ignatius customer support, He indicated that a very small percentage of movies occasionally will not work on a customers player for various reasons. That said, he contacted their manufacturer to insure that I receive copies that do work.

NOTE: I've rated this DVD as a ""3 star"" not for content, but because the DVD doesn't work as expected. That can certainly change depending on the outcome from Ignatius Press. With WYD coming fast, I wanted to let others know, should they be affected as I was. Not a huge deal, but If you will show this with friends, make sure you test your movie first!

Look for my update in the future!",1459987200,6,1366,4.51417004048583

8602998,5,B00E9HPV4U,"Watching the video helped me to understand how these three lives, though separate, worked together to do the Will of God.  Very powerful and a very important part of history, that will never be told in the history books.  These three saints have shown us what it means to live a holy and virteous life.  It is about service, sacifice and surrender.  I believe Saint Pope John Paull II saw how God worked in St. Faustina and St. Maximilian's lives, which influenced this life to be the kind of pope he was - faithful and strong.",1455408000,2,527,4.458333333333333
