3135556,4,B0014VPFHW,"You know him, you love him, you can't eat your spinach without him, it's Popeye the Sailor !

Yes, the salty seaman finally returns to a brand new 2-disc set with 31 classic cartoons remastered and uncut for your enjoyment.  These cartoons continue chronologically, so this set goes from 1938 to 1940.  It's also the only authorized edition by Warner Home Video, which means it's official compared to cheaper Popeye and classic cartoon DVDs found elsewhere.  Either way, more cartoons are here with Popeye, Olive, Bluto, Swee' Pea, Wimpy, and some new friends like Eugene the Jeep and Poopdeck Pappy.  No matter what trouble he gets into, Popeye prevails as long as there's a convenient can of spinach around.

Just like the previous collection, this set drops anchor on the special features with cool commentaries by animators and animation historians and, of course, ""Popeye Popumentaries"" like ""Eugene the Jeep: A Breed of His Own"", ""Poopdeck Pappy: The Nasty Old Man and the Sea"", and ""O-Re-Mi: The Voices of Olive Oyl"".  Other Extras include the amazing documentary ""Out of the Inkwell: The Fleischer Story"" plus behind-the-scenes bonuses from a storyboard reel to an art gallery.  There's even a bonus Superman cartoon produced by Fleischer Studios and some Popeye radio shows, too !

With brilliant marvels of the technological kind used in these cartoons and more, the folks at Fleischer Studios really have their act together on these Popeye episodes and others like Betty Boop.  Still, Popeye is a real superstar in the classic cartoon world.  You gotta love him.

So get this great DVD set as well as the previous set, plus look for ""Popeye and Friends: Volume 1"" also available.  And keep your eyes peeled for ""Popeye the Sailor: Volume 3"" available this fall !",1213920000,3,1773,4.969491525423729
3135557,4,B0014VPFHW,"I thoroughly enjoyed Volume 1 and thought I'd prefer the episodes on Volume 2, as my favorite period is mainly the WWII years (which vol. 2 does not quite get up to). But I was surprised to find that most of these cartoons didn't do much for me, and in fact I remembered surprisingly few of them compared to the set on Volume 1.

That having been said, the restoration work etc. is perfectly fine and the package as a whole lives up to the standard set by volume 1.  I was a little thrown off by what I can only guess are occasional overdubs dropped in to repair soundtrack losses on the originals. You will know them when you hear them - they sound most peculiar and can be a little jarring. You will also notice occasional splices and replacements on the opening credits for some episodes.  I had read that the restoration of this volume took longer than projected, and I think I see why. Who would have guessed that the ""middle years"" would have more technical issues than the earlier years?

I also noticed several instances where sound effects seemed like superimposed, modern additions -- the sound of Swee'pea sniffing in one episode stands out far apart from the rest of the soundtrack. There were about 5 or 6 other instances of this, and I wonder what's up with that.

Overall, a great set and one I'm pleased to own -- just a little peculiar.",1213833600,11,1353,4.439516129032258
3135558,5,B0014VPFHW,"Warner Home Video has issued this disc 1 advisery:

Notice regarding Popeye the Sailor 1938-1940 Volume 2, Disc 1

Warner Home Video is advising consumers who purchased Popeye the Sailor 1938-1940 Volume 2 DVD that two shorts on Disc 1 have an alternate opening credits sequence.

For any consumer who wants to have disc 1 replaced with the original opening credits sequence, please contact Warner Home Video at 1-800-553-6937 so that a self-addressed stamped envelope can be sent to you for return of your current disc. Please note that the replacement discs will be sent to you in approximately 8-10 weeks.

The cartoons in error are:

#9 CUSTOMERS WANTED
#14  HELLO HOW AM I

They start with the Paramount Logo replacing the TV ""aap"" logo, but then jump to the plain white ""Popeye"" TV title card, and then return to the original episode title & credits.  The editor did not realize that the Popeye section needed to be replaced also.

As this is not a disc ""Recall"" but a replacement program, don't expect the stores to send them back for replacement copies.  I would suggest purchasing the DVDs now.  If you are unhappy with the alternate title sections, then call for a replacement.  I would not wait in hopes the new discs will appear on the store shelves.  That would require them to sell out of all existing copies in the distribution warehouses.

Most likely many viewers will not care about this, but historians will want the corrected discs.",1213660800,82,1459,4.78
3135559,5,B0014VPFHW,"In my world of collecting, ""Goonland"" is the single most wonderful cartoon ever made, but that's just my personal taste. I won't give the plot away, but it's just such a cool cartoon! It's on this new set. I own a copy in Super 8 and have been wanting one in 16mm for many years. Another one in this set I love is ""Leave Well Enough Alone"". When I was a kid, that whole Idea killed me. Popeye tries to let all the animals free from a pet store, but bad things happen to them once they get out. A Great lesson for kids to learn in the ""Be Careful What You Wish For"", Category. So for me, those Toons alone are worth the price of this DVD. The first set was amazing. I can't wait for this one to be released.",1209600000,9,706,3.9788732394366195
3135560,5,B0014VPFHW,"The word I hear is that the restoration of the later black and white Popeye cartoons is taking longer than expected.  That is why Volume 2 is a two disc set.  From what I read, future volumes are expected to be two disc sets.",1206403200,7,225,4.090909090909091
3135561,5,B0014VPFHW,"The Fleischers' Popeye series really hit its stride in the late 1930's, and this set contains many classic shorts.  For those poor uninformed folks that think all Popeye cartoons are the same, be sure and show them ""It's the Natural Thing To Do,"" wherein Popeye and Bluto try a more civilized approach at courting Olive.  More characters from the Segar comic strip appear as well, including Eugene the Jeep, Poopdeck Pappy, and the Goons.  ""Females Is Fickle"" is the well-known episode in which Popeye nearly kills himself trying to save Olive's pet goldfish.  And the ""Aladdin"" short is the final color ""2-reeler"" in the series.

As with Volume 1, Warner Bros. has provided a generous set of extras for this release.  These include a lengthy documentary on the Fleischer studios, featurettes on supporting players, various art galleries, audio commentaries on several cartoons, and a Superman cartoon from the Fleischers.  While that last item might seem an odd addition to this set, it's another fine example of what the studio could do with a popular comic character.

There are still a couple of more years' worth of great Popeye cartoons from the Fleischers, before the changeover to Famous Studios. . .and the long, slow death (creatively speaking) of the spinach-eating sailor.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popeye-the-Sailor-1941-43-Volume-3/dp/B001B23ED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popeye the Sailor-1941-43 Volume 3</a>&nbsp;hits the shelves on Sept. 30.

3135562,5,B0014VPFHW,"Popeye the early cartoons cannot be matched today. They are a real treat to watch. Incredible works of art done by the Fliecher Studios. The timing of each shot is perfect. For example, when you see sweetpea crawling through a factory with machinery moving, the 3 D effect and timing, could only be dreamt of in todays CGIs. The cost of making such 7 minute shorts today would be astronomical. I also wonder if they have the skill now to do something like this? Laughs galore and never tire of viewing again. The extras on the set are also well done. With current interviews and interesting antidotes  for many of the popeye toons. The clarity of the first set on upscaled 1080p looks almost HD. This set will be the same and fun for the whole family, in todays world full of inappropriate material. As Popeye appropriately says, ""I am what I am."" People the world over have enjoyed him for decades and will for decades to come. Being somewhat of a collector, this set is prized amongst other well done animation, but none equal the B&W detail and shading of Popeye.",1205280000,19,1066,4.552083333333333
3135563,5,B0014VPFHW,"Someone has already commented in Volume One that these early Popeye cartoons are totally different from what is often seen on TV. Those cartoons were largely made in the 60's and are quite monotonous - Bluto wants Olive as a girlfriend, he initially gets the upper hand, and then Popeye eats his spinach and saves the day. If that were the case here I'd say save your money. However, this is not the case. These early Popeye cartoons feature funnier, more interesting versions of the Popeye characters in a wide variety of plots. The following is the press release indicating the contents of volume 2:

3135588,5,B0014VPFHW,"When the Flisher's moved to Miami they took Popeye with them and made a dazzling bunch of cartoons in the process! Each cartoon is filled to the brim with inventive ideas!

In Mutiny aint nice!  Popeye rescues Olive from a bunch of roughnecks who are against any women on board

 while in Goonland Popeye meets his father Poopdeck pappy and fights a horde of Goons and in ALLADDIN'S MAGIC LAMP Popeye as Alladin is in color and battles a bunch of monsters and a wicked Wazer to save the princess Olive and make her his bride!

3135593,4,B0014VPFHW,"Despite restoration errors (the two cartoons with a.a.p. television intertitles, as well as Paramount logos not fading into main title card on certain cartoons), this set is still a must have. Ordering the set in 2015, I kept thinking either Warner Bros., who now owns the rights to these cartoons even though Paramount was the original distributor, was clearing out old inventory, or they were too ignorant to correct the titles on the sequences, although they said they would correct the issue for future pressings. As for the cartoons, brilliant animation, witty gags, and fluid character movement are some of the things you'll find in these cartoons.",1427414400,2,654,5.121495327102804

3135599,5,B0014VPFHW,"These [mostly] B&W cartoons are nearly eighty years old, at this writing, but still offer plenty of interest. The gags themselves are as silly as ever - and we all have moments when 'silly' is what we want, don't we? Then there's the nostalgia factor, of coming back to cartoons and characters I saw as a kid, closer to the cartoon's origins than to the present day.

But what makes it a classic is that it just keeps getting better. I remember the beautiful background, often hand-painted. But, from the extras, I learned that some of the are actual 3D models, shot with moving cameras. That's not just an illusion of perfect perspective behind the hand-drawn cels, it's real 3D. And, between extras on this and another volume, I learned a bit more about the society these cartoons depict. Disney was the other animation powerhouse of the day, selling a prettified, idealized view of what could be. Popeye lived more on the fringes of society, in places where the Great Depression lingered longer than others. Patched walls and curtains, boarding houses instead of white picket fences, manual labor instead of royal leisure - not the same world at all.

I haven't gone through all the extras and commentaries yet. They usually don't interest me, but these seem very educational. As much as I liked these cartoons already, the extras help me like them even more.

3135619,5,B0014VPFHW,"Ah, Popeye. I remember when Channel 32 WFLD in Chicago had this playing during the 70s. They were playing the color ones from the fifties and late forties for quite a while, when suddenly(at least from my perspective), everything was in black and white. Their lips didn't always move when dialogue sounded, the action was rougher, and after the initial shock wore off...it was FUNNIER. Those sotto voce comments that Jack Mercer made when he took over the voice of Popeye...wow. One I remember in particular(though I can't find where I heard it) was Bluto snarling, 'Make a fool out of me, will ya?' and Popeye's response was 'Nature beat me to it.' Outside of the tobacco use(understandable-who didn't back then), these cartoons would work today. Immediately someone just jumped up and pointed out the violence present. That violence is operatic, and quite obviously fictional.

3135635,5,B0014VPFHW,"There's a subtle shift in this second collection of Popeye cartoons from the Fleischer Studios. The cartoons collected in the first set were marked by extremely elaborate and cutting edge animation (heck, even by today's standards), but by the time of these cartoons some of the top animation guys had moved on to other projects at the studio, leaving the next guys in line in charge of Popeye. As a result, these cartoons loose some (but by no means all) of their inventiveness.

... but this is not a negative review.

Whatever edge the series lost in that respect it makes up in another. These 1938-1940 cartoons largely abandon the simple Popeye v. Bluto scenario and go for more different kinds of stories. The emphasis is more on storytelling and character than before, and several wonderful characters from E.C. Segar's original comic strip are brought on board: Eugene the Jeep, Poopdeck Pappy, and the Goons!

""Goonland"" is my favorite Popeye cartoon, maybe my favorite cartoon period. These first two Popeye DVD collections comprise the golden age of this series, by the time of the toons collected in volume three things just weren't the same anymore.",1334793600,2,1162,4.948717948717949

Part of POPEYE's good-natured charm came via trademark exclamations of ""I yam what I yam!"" and ""Blow me down!"", along with the hilarious, though barely discernable asides he mumbled (often with his mouth closed). He doted on only OLIVE OYL, his spaghetti-limbed, rusty nail-voiced ""goilfriend""...except when burly nemesis BLUTO was around, which was all the time. Perpetual burger moocher J.

A platoon of knowledgeable and articulate animation buffs offer commentaries on many of the titles, and several short documentaries provide further background information on the making of these films.  Whether they will be to everyone's tastes is another matter--a lot of the cartoons, particularly the earlier ones, are essentially Bluto and Popeye beating the stuffing out of each other, until Popeye consumes his spinach and vanquishes his foe.

3135646,4,B0014VPFHW,"After the wonderful 4-disc set Popeye the Sailor Vol. 1, we're given a 2nd. (& 3rd. Volume with half the features. Nevertheless, this is still a great set for Popeye fans.

1938 marks a turning point in the Popeye cartoons; E.C. Segar, the cartoonist who created Popeye passes away. Also the Fleischers moved from New York to Miami & it shows in the cartoons presented here. They're not as dark & gloomy as the ones featured in volume 1. Also Bluto is MIA in a number of cartoons here; that may have to do with the passing of  Gus Wickle who provided his voice. So instant we're introduced to more characters from the comic strip like Poopdeck Pappy (Goonland), Eugene the Jeep (Popeye the Sailor with the Jeep), & Popeye's 4 nephews (the dream sequence in Wimmin is a Myskery despite being called his sons)

Like the first set, the cartoons are greatly remastered. The final color Two-Reeler & the weakest of the 3, Aladdin & His Wonderful Lamp is here as well. As usual, the popumentaries are also well done. The other bonus material, like early art work from Max Fleischer (from 1898!) & 2 non-Popeye Fleischer shorts, one which is a Superman cartoon are a welcome addition. The commentaries are a big improvement over the previous set.

And then there's the documentary on the Fleischers themselves which gives us an interesting look at the family & their company, but is silent on the real reason for their break-up (which many believed has to do Dave, who's married, fooling around whereas Max was committed to the same woman for life.)

The animation in this collection is wonderful, and the DVD quality is damn near perfect; but I was bored watching these cartoons.  The stories lack the punch they packed when I viewed them many years ago on television with much younger eyes. I guess I'm getting old.  Maybe I need to eat more spinach and take some vitamins.  Don't get me wrong; as stated, the quality is great, and the discs are worth owning, especially if you are a collector of classic quality cartoons.  I think I have outgrown the stories, however.  Maybe it's time for me to read ""A Remembrance of Things Past,"" or ""Les Miserables.""  I felt the same way when I viewed the ""Jetsons"" a few years ago.

3135650,5,B0014VPFHW,"The year 1938 marked a big change for the Fleischer Studios. In a move sought to evade union strikes, gain advantage of tax breaks, and begin development of feature films, the studio found itself relocating from New York to Miami. The change in location also brought about a change in the output: The atmosphere of the Fleischers' cartoons ceased to be gritty and urban, and became more sunny and cheerful, possibly in an attempt to get an upper hand in its rivalry to the Walt Disney studio (or maybe just as a reflection of where they were working, but either suggestion seems valid). As a result, their work lost the touches that made it so recognisable in the many years before, but their work was at its peak in this new period. Popeye marks itself a fine example in this statement. The cartoons began to become more creative during this timeframe, now often throwing out the memorably basic Popeye-eating-spinach-to-get-back-at-Bluto premise (as evidenced at the tail end of Volume One) and developing more original stories. From ""I Yam Love Sick"" to ""Goonland"" to ""Never Sock a Baby"" to even ""Popeye the Sailor Meets William Tell"" (a rather oddball cartoon---yet still a personal favorite of mine---placing Popeye out of regular continuity, taking him back in time to meet an historical figure), you never saw the series put out such plots before, and it shows that the series had reached the top of its game. Those peak years are now available in this set, along with a documentary on the Fleischer Studio (as well as a vintage short film giving us a glimpse of the Miami facility), four new Popeye ""Popumentaries"", plus other amazing extras. There's no denying that this is a welcome addition to the home video library of any cartoon lover.",1225670400,3,1749,4.833333333333333
3135651,5,B0014VPFHW,"At the risk of sounding like a snob these aren't cartoons they're classic animation. Here we have a meeting of two 1930's giants, Fleischer Studios and perhaps the most indelible character in entertainment history, Popeye the Sailor Man. A short, balding, toothless, middle aged sailor with a misshapen body, poor grammar and a face only Olive could love. Popeye is less than an everyman, he's a misfit with the strength of a battleship. It's nearly impossible not to like Popeye because he represents the gangly, awkward side in all of us, protected by an inhuman ability to inflict and absorb punishment. Popeye is completely unaware of how he stands apart from the rest of humanity, he simply is who he is and Heaven help anyone who dares taunt the squinty eyed runt.

I have always been a huge fan of Disney but Fleischer Studios produced some of the most entertaining, influential animation ever during their short 21 year existence. At their peak the Popeye cartoons were as good as anything Disney ever put out. This DVD collection contains a very nice retrospective on the history and achievements of Fleischer Studios. I had no idea they produced full length features to compete with Disney. As a special bonus the collection includes an entire Superman cartoon `The Mechanical Monsters' which holds up incredibly well 70 years later.

The second Popeye DVD collection is half the size of the first but the quality remains top notch. We finally get to see the Jeep, Goon Island and even Poopdeck Pappy. There are special features devoted to the background and history of the Jeep and Pappy. There is another feature on Mae Questel, the voice of Olive Oyl for most of the Popeye cartoons, that's worth watching. Oddly enough Bluto doesn't even appear until the ninth episode (Customers Wanted) and that one is mostly just flashbacks to previous episodes. One of my favorite characters, Wimpy, hardly appears at all.

What makes this collection so special for me is the inclusion of commentary on many of the cartoons. It really helps fans to understand details about these cartoons they wouldn't naturally be aware of. For instance Fleischer would use different animators for distant and close up shots (probably a common practice in animation studios). After awhile you can actually start to recognize the style of specific animators. Even if I couldn't match a name to a cartoon I could see that there were more than subtle differences in drawings between episodes and I definitely had my favorites. The episode ""Popeye meets William Tell"" was done by a pair of animators who got their start at Fleischer but had been working for Disney. The cartoon has a very different style that didn't really mesh with the Popeye character (this is admitted by the lead artist from an old interview). You would never know this background if it weren't for the commentary.

Volume 2 is drawn from the years when Fleischer Studios moved from NY to Florida and you can see a difference is tone. I was a little disappointed by the reduced role of Bluto and near disappearance of Wimpy but it does feature perhaps my favorite Popeye cartoon, `Fighin' Pals' where we see that there exists a true friendship between Popeye and Bluto. These cartoons are both timeless and intractably tied to the late 30's early 40's. The humor holds up perfectly but a cartoon like this could never be made today. The rough and tumble, black and white style of Popeye springs from the depression era and the domesticated Popeye of later cartoons just doesn't work. Here is the animated Popeye at his peak. Enjoy.",1222128000,8,3585,4.872131147540983
3135652,4,B0014VPFHW,"The second volume of Popeye shorts has been released, covering the years 1938 - 1940.  The two disc set features 31 shorts along with numerous extras.  There is a misconception that every Popeye short involved him eating spinach and fighting arch-nemesis Bluto but this set seems aimed at disproving that theory.  Many of these shorts are without Bluto and even without that strength-producing green vegetable.  It seems as if the Fleischers were now trying to domesticate their star.  More and more episodes feature Popeye with Olive Owl and Sweet Pea.  Two other family members are introduced in this set:  The magical dog Eugene the Jeep, and Popeye's long lost father, Poopdeck Pappy.

""The Jeep"" is the first appearance of the dog, which has the ability to disappear and move through solid objects.  Popeye enlists his aid to find Sweet Pea who has wandered out of his crib into the city.  This episode is filled with sight gags and Popeye tries to keep up with the Jeep as he walks up, down, and through buildings.  It would be another episode on this set, ""Popeye presents Eugene the Jeep"" that shows us how Popeye first acquired his fantastic pet.

In ""Goonland"", Popeye is out searching for his father who disappeared when he was born.  He discovers him being held captive on Goon Island by the giant Goons.  Popeye and Pappy unite to defeat the Goons and return to civilization.

In another episode that involves no Spinach or Bluto, Popeye keeps getting parking tickets from the same cop as he helps Olive with her Spring-cleaning.  Here's a tip, watch these episodes with the subtitles on so you can read all of Popeye's mutterings that are sometimes hard to hear.  They are hilarious!  He constantly calls the cop ""Occifer"" instead of Officer.

In fact, in one episode, Popeye and Bluto are the best of friends, sort of...Bluto goes off to explore Africa in ""Fighting Pals"".  When his expedition gets lost, Popeye goes to look for him.  Tired and exhausted, Bluto actually gives Popeye some spinach to rejuvenate him and the episode closes with a brawl.

Perhaps the most famous short in this set is ""Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp"" a two-reel short filmed in gorgeous Technicolor.  Popeye is Aladdin, trying to win the hand of Princess Olive and finds the magical lamp but an evil, non-Bluto villain wants the lamp for himself.

The set show just how diversified the Fleischer studio was when it came to Popeye.  They could do riotous slapstick humor without always resorting to Spinach or fighting.  The shorts have been remasterd and are uncut and look gorgeous, especially the Technicolor gem.  Not as much material on this set as the first one, but it's great stuff!",1219363200,5,2684,4.828947368421052

3135654,5,B0014VPFHW,"Even though it's a much smaller box than the first Popeye collection, it's still a must have for fans of the Fleischer ouevre.  The restorations, as in the first set, are meticulous, and there's a pretty good hour doc on the whole Fleischer history, including a couple of things (a 1950s luncheon set up by former arch rival Walt Disney) that I didn't know before.  As with the first box, some of these cartoons are as good as golden age theatrical cartoons ever got.  There are first appearances by the Jeep, the Goons and Pappy, and the third of the three Technicolor specials.  By the way, the early colorized versions of these beautiful black and white cartoons hide much of the detail and quality of these pieces, ironically making them look much more poorly drawn than they are.  Stick with the black and white and you'll have a much better visual experience.",1216944000,4,865,4.6644736842105265
3135655,4,B0014VPFHW,"This set covers a time of change at the Fleischer Studios as they made the decision to move to Coral Gables, Florida where they were given the first air conditioned office building in Florida as an enticement by the state. This move was made more difficult as Mae Questel declined to follow and the voice of Bluto, Gus Wickie, had died the previous year. At the same time, the theaters and distributers were looking for more conformist Disney style animation and less of the rough and tumble weirdness that marked the Fleischer style. The short ""It's The Natural Thing To Do"" makes a great direct commentary on this.

So this is an uneven set with some of the best traditional Popeye cartoons ever made and some rather uninspired films predicting the later Famous Studios Popeye films. The films also have a big variation in style as some are in the classic Fleischer style and others in a softer more rounded design which seems to depend on who was the lead animator listed. The influence of the now very obscure Fleischer Color Classics series (made to compete with Disney's Silly Symphonies) is very evident in the final 2-reel color Popeye. This is the weakest of the three made but is perhaps the most sophisticated in film technique. Greg Ford's excellent commentary will get you thru the first ten minutes.

The Fleischer documentary is very good although one fact is incorrect. Paramount did not ""ask"" the Fleischers to make a feature. The Fleischers had been trying to make a feature for years but were unsuccessful until Paramount saw the success of Snow White. Listen to the commentary on ""Alladin"" for more details. Also reason for the feud between Max and Dave is glossed over. Some people who worked at the Fleischer studios said that Dave's repeated cheating on his wife really galled Max who was happily married to one woman for his whole life. The final straw was when Dave had another affair, this time with the wife of an employee.

There's no real reason not to get this set if you are a Popeye fan. I would hope that one day the Fleischer's other output from the 1920's and 1930's gets restored and released, especially the Song Car Toons and the Screen Songs plus Betty Boop.",1214870400,9,2197,4.701298701298701
3135656,4,B0014VPFHW,"""Hello How Am I"" will be worth the price of the DVD alone.  But generally it's good to have all the classic shorts coming in bit by bit.

3135657,5,B0014VPFHW,"These cartoons were notoriously difficult to restore--where Volume 2 was originally intended to be another four disc set, the restorations on this particular group of films proved to be much more challenging than expected.

With that said, I think the producers did a great job delivering us another high-quality ""official"" Popeye The Sailor release.  There are some instances where the picture jumps during the opening credits or the sound quality swells, but overall the quality and integrity of these cartoons has been restored 99 percent.  In other words, the producers of this set did the best they could to fix what were very damaged originals.

If you enjoyed Popeye The Sailor Vol. 1 you will enjoy Vol. 2 as well.  You definitely see some changes in the Fleischers' direction, as they uprooted their studio and moved to Miami, in some cases placing Popeye in a suburban setting rather than the gritty city of the cartoons in the first volume.  And it's interesting to see all of that off-screen drama manifest itself on-screen.  But as the saying goes, you can take the kid out of the city but you can't take the city out of the kid; even though Popeye may find himself in calmer neighborhoods, he is still the same rough and tumble sailor, ready to crack a can of spinich and throw down with anyone.

What I think is so impressive about these sets is that they don't only rekindle your interest in Popeye--they pull you into the Fleischers' history and they boost your overall interest in animation.  The extras and ""Popumentaries"" give you detailed looks at specific characters and voice-actors, and the packaging is really beautiful, perfectly capturing the era that these films represent.

I would recommend this set to any fan of Popeye, any fan of animation, or any fan of DVD collections, for that matter.  While you may find a spot where the picture shakes in one or two of the cartoons, that is only because the originals are seventy years old and this specific batch of originals was particularly damaged.  The picture isn't perfect, but then again, neither is Popeye--the one-eyed, toothless, middle-aged scrapper--the unlikeliest of heroes.  The producers did the best they could to restore the films--and for me, that grittiness actually adds to the set's authenticity.  Looking forward to Vol. 3.",1214265600,19,2319,4.943298969072165
3135658,3,B0014VPFHW,"I was really disappointed in volume 2. The constant up and down jitter and brightness changes, either from shrinkage or sprocket wear or decomposing prints, is fatiguing to watch. That could have been easily corrected by image stabilzation without causing artifacts. Compare any of the opening credits with those of Volume 1 and there is a HUGE difference.  The sound seemed tinny and lacking a low end. They look no better than the ""Popeye Show"" prints on Cartoon Network. And the 2 or 3 aap title cards were inexcusable! And the shimmery titles on ""the Jeep"" I have never seen even on a dollar store public domain DVD. Didn't they let Jerry Beck or anybody that is remotey familiar with these cartoons preview this set before they started pressing them?

I am not some weenie who looks at DVD releases frame by frame trying to find things to complain about. But this is obvious stuff that I am recalling from memory just from ONE VIEWING",1214265600,15,939,4.684848484848485
3135659,3,B0014VPFHW,"This isn't really a review of the Popeye cartoons, but of one of the bonus cartoons on the set. Namely the Superman cartoon.  There are dozens of different companys putting out the Fleischer Superman cartoons, which are great.  But most of these public domain DVDs are poor quality.  I've been waiting for Warner to put out a collection, but aside from putting them on the complete movie collection they have yet to do so.  I'm not interested in the movies, and wasn't about to spend a fortune on the complete movie collection just to get the cartoons.  So when I saw that one was included on this set I was curious to see how it compared with the Bosko and Bridgestone disks (both distributed by Image) which I have.
  What a disappointment!  The cartoon - ""The Mechanical Monsters"", was the second one made and is one of the best.  But Warner has completely butchered it!  They've taken the beginning portion of the FIRST Superman cartoon (the part about Krypton) and edited it into this one right after the credits, completely eliminating the part about Superman's X-Ray vision on the ONLY cartoon that mentioned it in the opening! And with a horrible splice affecting the dialogue to boot!  Then they tacked on the wrong Paramount end logo!  What's up with that??  Is that Warner's idea of restoration?  Were the ones included in the movie set like this?  I'm sure glad I didn't spend the money to find out!",1214179200,11,1411,4.65587044534413

There is increased digital artifacting all over the place, particularly around all of the edges.
Lower bit rate maybe? I'm upconverting this to a 1080P set, so perhaps that's making the effect more pronounced, but the first set looks much better. I know this ain't Blu-ray, but I we can do better, folks!",1214006400,10,380,4.686567164179104
3135661,5,B0014VPFHW,"POPEYE THE SAILOR: Volume Two 1938-1940: Released: June 17, 2008.
(Partial) DVD Review by Joe Torcivia.

Can you review such a set after just viewing the first eight cartoons?  Let's find out... Warning!  It's Long...

What a great series of Popeye cartoons we have to open Disc One of this new set!

By 1938, Max and Dave Fleischer have clearly broken with the formula they established early on... and the one that the Famous Paramount studio would do to death in their later Popeye cartoons.  You know... Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, triangle, spinach, Sock-o, etc.

In the first EIGHT cartoons on the disc, Bluto - and the formulaic conflict he brings with him - is nowhere in sight, save for a cameo appearance AS A PHOTOGRAPH (!) in the first one.  In these eight alone, we have a diversity of cast that would be unimaginable in later years.  Popeye, Olive, Wimpy, Swee'Pea, Eugene the Jeep, Poopdeck Pappy, the Goons... and, of course, the photograph of Bluto that (not unexpectedly) steals the only scene that it's in!

Before continuing, I should say that, despite my comments above, Bluto is one of the great villains in the history of theatrical animation, and most (if not all) of his appearances on the first POPEYE set (1933-1938) were very enjoyable.  But, in times to come, he will wear out his welcome (at least to me) and it is with this knowledge of what lies ahead that I take this position.  But, if we go much longer than these first eight without him, I'm going to really start missing the big lug!

Here's a (relatively, but not completely) Spoiler-Free recap of those first eight cartoons...

01:  ""I Yam Love Sick"". Enraptured in romance novels, and aided by a huge box of chocolates from Bluto - and that scene-stealing photograph - Olive totally ignores Popeye, to the point where he has to play sick-and-dying to get any attention.  ""I must be losin' me sex repeal, or sumpthin'!"" mutters the sailor man, in one of those famous Jack Mercer ad-libs where Popeye's mouth doesn't move!  She takes him to the hospital, where he continues to play almost-dead... until it's time to operate!

02:  ""Plumbing is a Pipe"".  I'm guessing that, in ye olde-tyme slang, if something was ""a pipe"", it was easy or ""a cinch"".  Olive springs a leak in her kitchen, which she compounds - and Popeye compounds much further.  Wimpy is great as the plumber, who keeps forgetting things or has other excuses like Lunch to keep from getting on the job.  He gets his later!

03: ""The Jeep"".  Swee'Pea keeps trying to escape Olive's very high apartment, by crawling out the window.  She thwarts him (Saying that he's giving her ""Populations of the heart!""), until he finally gets out!  Popeye shows up with Eugene the Jeep (a ""magical dog""!) who can accurately answer any question, disappear and reappear, and track anything with his uncanny abilities to walk through walls, on air, or anywhere else.  He tracks the missing Swee'Pea, leading Popeye on a merry - and painful - chase and to a great ending!

This is one of the two best cartoons on the disc so far!  Though it is not an origin for ""The Jeep""... he's just there with Popeye, visiting Olive.  Oddly, his animated origin occurs in ""Popeye Presents Eugene the Jeep"", which is the LAST cartoon on Disc Two - and was apparently produced by the Fleischers about TWO YEARS after this one.

The latter Jeep cartoon contradicts the former, in dealing with Eugene's origins, but that's to be expected from Golden Age animation.  The presence of the second cartoon, a good explanatory commentary on this cartoon, and an extra feature mini-documentary, ""Eugene the Jeep: A Breed of His Own"", detailing the Jeep's comic strip origins, help ease (...or maybe they ADD TO) the confusion over this odd and wonderful character.

04:  ""Bulldozing the Bull"".  Popeye's in Spain, Mexico, or somewhere that bullfighting is popular.  In this unexpectedly superior cartoon he demonstrates the more modern attitude (...and certainly not the prevailing attitude when this cartoon was made!) that the sport of bullfighting - and especially the killing of the bull - is cruelty to animals!  Olive is the obligatory seniorita (presaging the sort of role-playing she'd often do in later outings), and a seating mix-up leads to Popeye being a reluctant toreador.  Lots of good gags, and a great surprise ending that I will not spoil!  Popeye's steadfast values here left me clapping!  That's the Popeye I love from the comics, unflagging ethics and all!

05: ""Mutiny Ain't Nice"".  One of my general complaints about the POPEYE series is that he isn't shown often enough to be a SAILOR!  Well, here he captains his own cargo sailing ship, with a rough and dangerous crew to boot.  Olive falls into a trunk and is brought aboard as they shove off.  The crew believes that females are bad luck on a ship and, when they find Olive, they mutiny against Captain Popeye and try to kill Olive.  The great thing about this one (...and it's only a small spoiler in the greater scheme of things) is that Olive finds that she ACTUALLY ENJOYS leading the murderous crew on a wild chase!  Popeye, once regaining control, enacts a solution that satisfies everyone - just not the way any of them would like!

06:  ""Goonland"".  The best cartoon on the disc so far - and more of an adventure in the E.C. Segar comic strip tradition than the usual animated comedy.  Popeye sails (Yes, he's a sailor again!) to the mysterious ""Goon Island"", to find his lost ""Poopdeck Pappy"" who left 40 years ago, when Popeye was a baby!  Was Pappy animation's first ""deadbeat dad""? The Goons AND Pappy, from the Segar strip, are introduced in this one!

Pappy is a prisoner of the Goons, and wants no part of his son, until the Goons capture Popeye and try to kill him by staking him at the foot of a cliff and dropping a boulder on him. Pappy downs the spinach, which the Goons removed from Popeye, and saves the day.  The Goons are dealt with by a remarkable fourth-wall-breaking device that is both extremely clever and looks somewhat out of place at the same time.  You judge for yourself.  Its unexpected surprise value goes a long way toward selling it, though!

This is a magnificently designed cartoon!  Everything on Goon Island is eerie looking... especially for a cartoon of this period!  As with the introduction of Eugene the Jeep, a good explanatory commentary on this cartoon, and an extra feature mini-documentary, ""Poopdeck Pappy: The Nasty Old Man and the Sea"" detail Pappy's comic strip origins.

07:  ""A Date to Skate"".  With Bluto still among the missing, Popeye convinces a VERY reluctant Olive to roller skate in one of those old roller skating palaces.  As expected, Olive soon careens out of control, onto the street, wreaking havoc on the outside world!  The Fleischers continue to marvelously play with ""The Formula"" by having Popeye FORGET TO BRING HIS SPINACH on the skating date!  ""I must be gettin' OLD! Don't tell me I left it HOME!"" Don't worry; he gets some though a device we've seen in some other cartoons.  And, as when she was pursued by the crew of murderous mutineers, Olive ends up enjoying her near-death-ride for the sheer thrill of it all!  This is a take on the usually timid Olive that we seldom saw!  I guess THAT'S what Popeye sees in the old scarecrow!

08:  ""Cops is Always Right"".  A funnier than expected cartoon, where Popeye and his little crank-start, puttering car continuously run afoul of a gruff police officer.  And he helps Olive with spring cleaning to boot.  Popeye comes across a little more ignorant of the law than you'd expect even a one-eyed sailor to be, but it works anyway because the officer is such a good one-shot antagonist.

Alas, as was the Fleischer practice of the time, there are no writing credits on any of these first eight cartoons.  Though, story credits begin during the period covered by this DVD set, as the second Jeep cartoon lists a story credit. The lack of credits early-on is a particular shame, as the cartoons discussed in this review comprised a very innovative portion of the series, story-wise.  I'd sure love to know who wrote these!

The Fleischer animation is always tops, and Jack Mercer and Mae Questel (though Questel is replaced in some of these) are magnificent as Popeye and Olive - especially with their frequent and outright funny ad-libs!  Indeed, at this particular point in the history of animation, they would have been the most entertaining animation voice actors of their time.  But, look out for Mel Blanc lurking in the shadows...

So, on the basis of the first eight shorts (...and I have little expectation that this will change over the balance of the set), POPEYE THE SAILOR: Volume Two 1938-1940 is highly recommended by this reviewer!  And... Hey, Bluto?  We'll see ya soon, ol' pal!",1214006400,9,8804,4.753298153034301
3135662,3,B0014VPFHW,"There's no bigger Popeye fan than me and I loved volume 1 - that's why volume 2 is such a disappointment. They claim that the cartoons are remastered but that is hard to  believe. So many of the cartoons are full of scratches and flashes and white dots. Some of them have a jittery picture - ""The Jeep"" is particularly bad. I really expected the quality to be a lot better.",1213920000,10,373,4.253521126760563
3135663,4,B0014VPFHW,"""Popeye the Sailor: 1933-1938"" was a tough act to follow, since the four-DVD set featured most of the classic Fleischer cartoons. Nevertheless, the second volume includes several restored gems from 1938 to 1940: ""Goonland,"" ""A Date to Skate,"" ""It's the Natural Thing to Do,"" ""Fightin' Pals"" and the Technicolor ""Aladdin"" two-reeler. The urban grittiness has been toned down, but the Fleischer spirit survives intact. Unfortunately, these Popeye cartoons lack the distinctive voices of Gus Wickie's Bluto and Mae Questel's Olive Oyl. (Wickie and Questel would not relocate to Miami with the Fleischers.) Though a notch below the first collection, Volume 2 provides spinach-packing fun - plus a generous array of extras and commentary tracks.",1213920000,8,740,5.5
3370053,4,B0014VPFHW,"You know him, you love him, you can't eat your spinach without him, it's Popeye the Sailor !

Yes, the salty seaman finally returns to a brand new 2-disc set with 31 classic cartoons remastered and uncut for your enjoyment.  These cartoons continue chronologically, so this set goes from 1938 to 1940.  It's also the only authorized edition by Warner Home Video, which means it's official compared to cheaper Popeye and classic cartoon DVDs found elsewhere.  Either way, more cartoons are here with Popeye, Olive, Bluto, Swee' Pea, Wimpy, and some new friends like Eugene the Jeep and Poopdeck Pappy.  No matter what trouble he gets into, Popeye prevails as long as there's a convenient can of spinach around.

Just like the previous collection, this set drops anchor on the special features with cool commentaries by animators and animation historians and, of course, ""Popeye Popumentaries"" like ""Eugene the Jeep: A Breed of His Own"", ""Poopdeck Pappy: The Nasty Old Man and the Sea"", and ""O-Re-Mi: The Voices of Olive Oyl"".  Other Extras include the amazing documentary ""Out of the Inkwell: The Fleischer Story"" plus behind-the-scenes bonuses from a storyboard reel to an art gallery.  There's even a bonus Superman cartoon produced by Fleischer Studios and some Popeye radio shows, too !

With brilliant marvels of the technological kind used in these cartoons and more, the folks at Fleischer Studios really have their act together on these Popeye episodes and others like Betty Boop.  Still, Popeye is a real superstar in the classic cartoon world.  You gotta love him.

So get this great DVD set as well as the previous set, plus look for ""Popeye and Friends: Volume 1"" also available.  And keep your eyes peeled for ""Popeye the Sailor: Volume 3"" available this fall !",1213920000,3,1773,4.969491525423729
3370054,4,B0014VPFHW,"I thoroughly enjoyed Volume 1 and thought I'd prefer the episodes on Volume 2, as my favorite period is mainly the WWII years (which vol. 2 does not quite get up to). But I was surprised to find that most of these cartoons didn't do much for me, and in fact I remembered surprisingly few of them compared to the set on Volume 1.

That having been said, the restoration work etc. is perfectly fine and the package as a whole lives up to the standard set by volume 1.  I was a little thrown off by what I can only guess are occasional overdubs dropped in to repair soundtrack losses on the originals. You will know them when you hear them - they sound most peculiar and can be a little jarring. You will also notice occasional splices and replacements on the opening credits for some episodes.  I had read that the restoration of this volume took longer than projected, and I think I see why. Who would have guessed that the ""middle years"" would have more technical issues than the earlier years?

I also noticed several instances where sound effects seemed like superimposed, modern additions -- the sound of Swee'pea sniffing in one episode stands out far apart from the rest of the soundtrack. There were about 5 or 6 other instances of this, and I wonder what's up with that.

Overall, a great set and one I'm pleased to own -- just a little peculiar.",1213833600,11,1353,4.439516129032258

They start with the Paramount Logo replacing the TV ""aap"" logo, but then jump to the plain white ""Popeye"" TV title card, and then return to the original episode title & credits.  The editor did not realize that the Popeye section needed to be replaced also.

As this is not a disc ""Recall"" but a replacement program, don't expect the stores to send them back for replacement copies.  I would suggest purchasing the DVDs now.  If you are unhappy with the alternate title sections, then call for a replacement.  I would not wait in hopes the new discs will appear on the store shelves.  That would require them to sell out of all existing copies in the distribution warehouses.

I won't give the plot away, but it's just such a cool cartoon! It's on this new set. I own a copy in Super 8 and have been wanting one in 16mm for many years. Another one in this set I love is ""Leave Well Enough Alone"". When I was a kid, that whole Idea killed me. Popeye tries to let all the animals free from a pet store, but bad things happen to them once they get out. A Great lesson for kids to learn in the ""Be Careful What You Wish For"", Category. So for me, those Toons alone are worth the price of this DVD. The first set was amazing. I can't wait for this one to be released.",1209600000,9,706,3.9788732394366195

3370058,5,B0014VPFHW,"The Fleischers' Popeye series really hit its stride in the late 1930's, and this set contains many classic shorts.  For those poor uninformed folks that think all Popeye cartoons are the same, be sure and show them ""It's the Natural Thing To Do,"" wherein Popeye and Bluto try a more civilized approach at courting Olive.  More characters from the Segar comic strip appear as well, including Eugene the Jeep, Poopdeck Pappy, and the Goons.  ""Females Is Fickle"" is the well-known episode in which Popeye nearly kills himself trying to save Olive's pet goldfish.  And the ""Aladdin"" short is the final color ""2-reeler"" in the series.

As with Volume 1, Warner Bros. has provided a generous set of extras for this release.  These include a lengthy documentary on the Fleischer studios, featurettes on supporting players, various art galleries, audio commentaries on several cartoons, and a Superman cartoon from the Fleischers.  While that last item might seem an odd addition to this set, it's another fine example of what the studio could do with a popular comic character.

There are still a couple of more years' worth of great Popeye cartoons from the Fleischers, before the changeover to Famous Studios. . .and the long, slow death (creatively speaking) of the spinach-eating sailor.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popeye-the-Sailor-1941-43-Volume-3/dp/B001B23ED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popeye the Sailor-1941-43 Volume 3</a>&nbsp;hits the shelves on Sept. 30.

3370059,5,B0014VPFHW,"Popeye the early cartoons cannot be matched today. They are a real treat to watch. Incredible works of art done by the Fliecher Studios. The timing of each shot is perfect. For example, when you see sweetpea crawling through a factory with machinery moving, the 3 D effect and timing, could only be dreamt of in todays CGIs. The cost of making such 7 minute shorts today would be astronomical. I also wonder if they have the skill now to do something like this? Laughs galore and never tire of viewing again. The extras on the set are also well done. With current interviews and interesting antidotes  for many of the popeye toons. The clarity of the first set on upscaled 1080p looks almost HD. This set will be the same and fun for the whole family, in todays world full of inappropriate material. As Popeye appropriately says, ""I am what I am."" People the world over have enjoyed him for decades and will for decades to come. Being somewhat of a collector, this set is prized amongst other well done animation, but none equal the B&W detail and shading of Popeye.",1205280000,19,1066,4.552083333333333
3370060,5,B0014VPFHW,"Someone has already commented in Volume One that these early Popeye cartoons are totally different from what is often seen on TV. Those cartoons were largely made in the 60's and are quite monotonous - Bluto wants Olive as a girlfriend, he initially gets the upper hand, and then Popeye eats his spinach and saves the day. If that were the case here I'd say save your money. However, this is not the case.

3370096,5,B0014VPFHW,"These [mostly] B&W cartoons are nearly eighty years old, at this writing, but still offer plenty of interest. The gags themselves are as silly as ever - and we all have moments when 'silly' is what we want, don't we? Then there's the nostalgia factor, of coming back to cartoons and characters I saw as a kid, closer to the cartoon's origins than to the present day.

But what makes it a classic is that it just keeps getting better. I remember the beautiful background, often hand-painted. But, from the extras, I learned that some of the are actual 3D models, shot with moving cameras. That's not just an illusion of perfect perspective behind the hand-drawn cels, it's real 3D. And, between extras on this and another volume, I learned a bit more about the society these cartoons depict. Disney was the other animation powerhouse of the day, selling a prettified, idealized view of what could be. Popeye lived more on the fringes of society, in places where the Great Depression lingered longer than others. Patched walls and curtains, boarding houses instead of white picket fences, manual labor instead of royal leisure - not the same world at all.

I haven't gone through all the extras and commentaries yet. They usually don't interest me, but these seem very educational. As much as I liked these cartoons already, the extras help me like them even more.

Those sotto voce comments that Jack Mercer made when he took over the voice of Popeye...wow. One I remember in particular(though I can't find where I heard it) was Bluto snarling, 'Make a fool out of me, will ya?' and Popeye's response was 'Nature beat me to it.' Outside of the tobacco use(understandable-who didn't back then), these cartoons would work today. Immediately someone just jumped up and pointed out the violence present.

3370132,5,B0014VPFHW,"There's a subtle shift in this second collection of Popeye cartoons from the Fleischer Studios. The cartoons collected in the first set were marked by extremely elaborate and cutting edge animation (heck, even by today's standards), but by the time of these cartoons some of the top animation guys had moved on to other projects at the studio, leaving the next guys in line in charge of Popeye. As a result, these cartoons loose some (but by no means all) of their inventiveness.

... but this is not a negative review.

Whatever edge the series lost in that respect it makes up in another. These 1938-1940 cartoons largely abandon the simple Popeye v. Bluto scenario and go for more different kinds of stories. The emphasis is more on storytelling and character than before, and several wonderful characters from E.C. Segar's original comic strip are brought on board: Eugene the Jeep, Poopdeck Pappy, and the Goons!

""Goonland"" is my favorite Popeye cartoon, maybe my favorite cartoon period. These first two Popeye DVD collections comprise the golden age of this series, by the time of the toons collected in volume three things just weren't the same anymore.",1334793600,2,1162,4.948717948717949

Part of POPEYE's good-natured charm came via trademark exclamations of ""I yam what I yam!"" and ""Blow me down!"", along with the hilarious, though barely discernable asides he mumbled (often with his mouth closed). He doted on only OLIVE OYL, his spaghetti-limbed, rusty nail-voiced ""goilfriend""...except when burly nemesis BLUTO was around, which was all the time. Perpetual burger moocher J. WELLINGTON WIMPY, mischievous baby SWEE' PEA, and cantankerous senior citizen POOPDECK PAPPY rounded out the quirky cast from creator ELZIE SEGAR's original comic strip...numerous companies produced hundreds of POPEYE shorts over a fifty year span, but none topped original animators MAX and DAVE FLEISHER's innovative, beautifully rendered, whimsical black & white cartoons of the 30s.

Each cartoon is presented in stunning quality from pristine 35mm source material, with the original main titles restored.  A platoon of knowledgeable and articulate animation buffs offer commentaries on many of the titles, and several short documentaries provide further background information on the making of these films.  Whether they will be to everyone's tastes is another matter--a lot of the cartoons, particularly the earlier ones, are essentially Bluto and Popeye beating the stuffing out of each other, until Popeye consumes his spinach and vanquishes his foe.  But just as Tom and Jerry cartoons provide endless creative variations on cat-chases-mouse, the Popeye cartoons are equally inventive in providing contexts and resolutions for the Popeye vs. Bluto bouts.",1237680000,,1103,5.383720930232558

1938 marks a turning point in the Popeye cartoons; E.C. Segar, the cartoonist who created Popeye passes away. Also the Fleischers moved from New York to Miami & it shows in the cartoons presented here. They're not as dark & gloomy as the ones featured in volume 1. Also Bluto is MIA in a number of cartoons here; that may have to do with the passing of  Gus Wickle who provided his voice. So instant we're introduced to more characters from the comic strip like Poopdeck Pappy (Goonland), Eugene the Jeep (Popeye the Sailor with the Jeep), & Popeye's 4 nephews (the dream sequence in Wimmin is a Myskery despite being called his sons)

Like the first set, the cartoons are greatly remastered. The final color Two-Reeler & the weakest of the 3, Aladdin & His Wonderful Lamp is here as well. As usual, the popumentaries are also well done. The other bonus material, like early art work from Max Fleischer (from 1898!) & 2 non-Popeye Fleischer shorts, one which is a Superman cartoon are a welcome addition. The commentaries are a big improvement over the previous set.

And then there's the documentary on the Fleischers themselves which gives us an interesting look at the family & their company, but is silent on the real reason for their break-up (which many believed has to do Dave, who's married, fooling around whereas Max was committed to the same woman for life.)

The animation in this collection is wonderful, and the DVD quality is damn near perfect; but I was bored watching these cartoons.  The stories lack the punch they packed when I viewed them many years ago on television with much younger eyes. I guess I'm getting old.  Maybe I need to eat more spinach and take some vitamins.  Don't get me wrong; as stated, the quality is great, and the discs are worth owning, especially if you are a collector of classic quality cartoons.  I think I have outgrown the stories, however.  Maybe it's time for me to read ""A Remembrance of Things Past,"" or ""Les Miserables.""  I felt the same way when I viewed the ""Jetsons"" a few years ago.  Perhaps, I was not in the proper mood at the time.  Who knows?  Oh, well.  If you love ""Popeye"" and don't mind watching the basic story line repeatedly, buy this collection.

3370147,5,B0014VPFHW,"The year 1938 marked a big change for the Fleischer Studios. In a move sought to evade union strikes, gain advantage of tax breaks, and begin development of feature films, the studio found itself relocating from New York to Miami. The change in location also brought about a change in the output: The atmosphere of the Fleischers' cartoons ceased to be gritty and urban, and became more sunny and cheerful, possibly in an attempt to get an upper hand in its rivalry to the Walt Disney studio (or maybe just as a reflection of where they were working, but either suggestion seems valid). As a result, their work lost the touches that made it so recognisable in the many years before, but their work was at its peak in this new period. Popeye marks itself a fine example in this statement. The cartoons began to become more creative during this timeframe, now often throwing out the memorably basic Popeye-eating-spinach-to-get-back-at-Bluto premise (as evidenced at the tail end of Volume One) and developing more original stories. From ""I Yam Love Sick"" to ""Goonland"" to ""Never Sock a Baby"" to even ""Popeye the Sailor Meets William Tell"" (a rather oddball cartoon---yet still a personal favorite of mine---placing Popeye out of regular continuity, taking him back in time to meet an historical figure), you never saw the series put out such plots before, and it shows that the series had reached the top of its game. Those peak years are now available in this set, along with a documentary on the Fleischer Studio (as well as a vintage short film giving us a glimpse of the Miami facility), four new Popeye ""Popumentaries"", plus other amazing extras.

Here we have a meeting of two 1930's giants, Fleischer Studios and perhaps the most indelible character in entertainment history, Popeye the Sailor Man. A short, balding, toothless, middle aged sailor with a misshapen body, poor grammar and a face only Olive could love. Popeye is less than an everyman, he's a misfit with the strength of a battleship. It's nearly impossible not to like Popeye because he represents the gangly, awkward side in all of us, protected by an inhuman ability to inflict and absorb punishment. Popeye is completely unaware of how he stands apart from the rest of humanity, he simply is who he is and Heaven help anyone who dares taunt the squinty eyed runt.

I have always been a huge fan of Disney but Fleischer Studios produced some of the most entertaining, influential animation ever during their short 21 year existence. At their peak the Popeye cartoons were as good as anything Disney ever put out. This DVD collection contains a very nice retrospective on the history and achievements of Fleischer Studios. I had no idea they produced full length features to compete with Disney. As a special bonus the collection includes an entire Superman cartoon `The Mechanical Monsters' which holds up incredibly well 70 years later.

The second Popeye DVD collection is half the size of the first but the quality remains top notch. We finally get to see the Jeep, Goon Island and even Poopdeck Pappy. There are special features devoted to the background and history of the Jeep and Pappy. There is another feature on Mae Questel, the voice of Olive Oyl for most of the Popeye cartoons, that's worth watching. Oddly enough Bluto doesn't even appear until the ninth episode (Customers Wanted) and that one is mostly just flashbacks to previous episodes. One of my favorite characters, Wimpy, hardly appears at all.

What makes this collection so special for me is the inclusion of commentary on many of the cartoons. It really helps fans to understand details about these cartoons they wouldn't naturally be aware of. For instance Fleischer would use different animators for distant and close up shots (probably a common practice in animation studios). After awhile you can actually start to recognize the style of specific animators. Even if I couldn't match a name to a cartoon I could see that there were more than subtle differences in drawings between episodes and I definitely had my favorites. The episode ""Popeye meets William Tell"" was done by a pair of animators who got their start at Fleischer but had been working for Disney. The cartoon has a very different style that didn't really mesh with the Popeye character (this is admitted by the lead artist from an old interview). You would never know this background if it weren't for the commentary.

Volume 2 is drawn from the years when Fleischer Studios moved from NY to Florida and you can see a difference is tone. I was a little disappointed by the reduced role of Bluto and near disappearance of Wimpy but it does feature perhaps my favorite Popeye cartoon, `Fighin' Pals' where we see that there exists a true friendship between Popeye and Bluto. These cartoons are both timeless and intractably tied to the late 30's early 40's. The humor holds up perfectly but a cartoon like this could never be made today. The rough and tumble, black and white style of Popeye springs from the depression era and the domesticated Popeye of later cartoons just doesn't work. Here is the animated Popeye at his peak. Enjoy.",1222128000,8,3585,4.872131147540983
3370149,4,B0014VPFHW,"The second volume of Popeye shorts has been released, covering the years 1938 - 1940.  The two disc set features 31 shorts along with numerous extras.  There is a misconception that every Popeye short involved him eating spinach and fighting arch-nemesis Bluto but this set seems aimed at disproving that theory.  Many of these shorts are without Bluto and even without that strength-producing green vegetable.  It seems as if the Fleischers were now trying to domesticate their star.  More and more episodes feature Popeye with Olive Owl and Sweet Pea.  Two other family members are introduced in this set:  The magical dog Eugene the Jeep, and Popeye's long lost father, Poopdeck Pappy.

""The Jeep"" is the first appearance of the dog, which has the ability to disappear and move through solid objects.  Popeye enlists his aid to find Sweet Pea who has wandered out of his crib into the city.  This episode is filled with sight gags and Popeye tries to keep up with the Jeep as he walks up, down, and through buildings.  It would be another episode on this set, ""Popeye presents Eugene the Jeep"" that shows us how Popeye first acquired his fantastic pet.

In ""Goonland"", Popeye is out searching for his father who disappeared when he was born.  He discovers him being held captive on Goon Island by the giant Goons.  Popeye and Pappy unite to defeat the Goons and return to civilization.

In another episode that involves no Spinach or Bluto, Popeye keeps getting parking tickets from the same cop as he helps Olive with her Spring-cleaning.  Here's a tip, watch these episodes with the subtitles on so you can read all of Popeye's mutterings that are sometimes hard to hear.  They are hilarious!  He constantly calls the cop ""Occifer"" instead of Officer.

In fact, in one episode, Popeye and Bluto are the best of friends, sort of...Bluto goes off to explore Africa in ""Fighting Pals"".  When his expedition gets lost, Popeye goes to look for him.  Tired and exhausted, Bluto actually gives Popeye some spinach to rejuvenate him and the episode closes with a brawl.

Perhaps the most famous short in this set is ""Aladdin and his Wonderful Lamp"" a two-reel short filmed in gorgeous Technicolor.  Popeye is Aladdin, trying to win the hand of Princess Olive and finds the magical lamp but an evil, non-Bluto villain wants the lamp for himself.

The set show just how diversified the Fleischer studio was when it came to Popeye.  They could do riotous slapstick humor without always resorting to Spinach or fighting.  The shorts have been remasterd and are uncut and look gorgeous, especially the Technicolor gem.  Not as much material on this set as the first one, but it's great stuff!",1219363200,5,2684,4.828947368421052
3370150,4,B0014VPFHW,"Although not quite as fun and satisfying as the first volume of the original Popeye cartoons, still highly recommended...",1217116800,2,121,5.421052631578948
3370151,5,B0014VPFHW,"Even though it's a much smaller box than the first Popeye collection, it's still a must have for fans of the Fleischer ouevre.  The restorations, as in the first set, are meticulous, and there's a pretty good hour doc on the whole Fleischer history, including a couple of things (a 1950s luncheon set up by former arch rival Walt Disney) that I didn't know before.  As with the first box, some of these cartoons are as good as golden age theatrical cartoons ever got.  There are first appearances by the Jeep, the Goons and Pappy, and the third of the three Technicolor specials.  By the way, the early colorized versions of these beautiful black and white cartoons hide much of the detail and quality of these pieces, ironically making them look much more poorly drawn than they are.  Stick with the black and white and you'll have a much better visual experience.",1216944000,4,865,4.6644736842105265
3370152,4,B0014VPFHW,"This set covers a time of change at the Fleischer Studios as they made the decision to move to Coral Gables, Florida where they were given the first air conditioned office building in Florida as an enticement by the state. This move was made more difficult as Mae Questel declined to follow and the voice of Bluto, Gus Wickie, had died the previous year. At the same time, the theaters and distributers were looking for more conformist Disney style animation and less of the rough and tumble weirdness that marked the Fleischer style. The short ""It's The Natural Thing To Do"" makes a great direct commentary on this.

So this is an uneven set with some of the best traditional Popeye cartoons ever made and some rather uninspired films predicting the later Famous Studios Popeye films. The films also have a big variation in style as some are in the classic Fleischer style and others in a softer more rounded design which seems to depend on who was the lead animator listed. The influence of the now very obscure Fleischer Color Classics series (made to compete with Disney's Silly Symphonies) is very evident in the final 2-reel color Popeye. This is the weakest of the three made but is perhaps the most sophisticated in film technique. Greg Ford's excellent commentary will get you thru the first ten minutes.

The Fleischer documentary is very good although one fact is incorrect. Paramount did not ""ask"" the Fleischers to make a feature. The Fleischers had been trying to make a feature for years but were unsuccessful until Paramount saw the success of Snow White. Listen to the commentary on ""Alladin"" for more details. Also reason for the feud between Max and Dave is glossed over. Some people who worked at the Fleischer studios said that Dave's repeated cheating on his wife really galled Max who was happily married to one woman for his whole life. The final straw was when Dave had another affair, this time with the wife of an employee.

There's no real reason not to get this set if you are a Popeye fan. I would hope that one day the Fleischer's other output from the 1920's and 1930's gets restored and released, especially the Song Car Toons and the Screen Songs plus Betty Boop.",1214870400,9,2197,4.701298701298701
3370153,4,B0014VPFHW,"""Hello How Am I"" will be worth the price of the DVD alone.  But generally it's good to have all the classic shorts coming in bit by bit.

3370154,5,B0014VPFHW,"These cartoons were notoriously difficult to restore--where Volume 2 was originally intended to be another four disc set, the restorations on this particular group of films proved to be much more challenging than expected.

With that said, I think the producers did a great job delivering us another high-quality ""official"" Popeye The Sailor release.  There are some instances where the picture jumps during the opening credits or the sound quality swells, but overall the quality and integrity of these cartoons has been restored 99 percent.  In other words, the producers of this set did the best they could to fix what were very damaged originals.

If you enjoyed Popeye The Sailor Vol. 1 you will enjoy Vol. 2 as well.  You definitely see some changes in the Fleischers' direction, as they uprooted their studio and moved to Miami, in some cases placing Popeye in a suburban setting rather than the gritty city of the cartoons in the first volume.  And it's interesting to see all of that off-screen drama manifest itself on-screen.  But as the saying goes, you can take the kid out of the city but you can't take the city out of the kid; even though Popeye may find himself in calmer neighborhoods, he is still the same rough and tumble sailor, ready to crack a can of spinich and throw down with anyone.

What I think is so impressive about these sets is that they don't only rekindle your interest in Popeye--they pull you into the Fleischers' history and they boost your overall interest in animation.  The extras and ""Popumentaries"" give you detailed looks at specific characters and voice-actors, and the packaging is really beautiful, perfectly capturing the era that these films represent.

I would recommend this set to any fan of Popeye, any fan of animation, or any fan of DVD collections, for that matter.  While you may find a spot where the picture shakes in one or two of the cartoons, that is only because the originals are seventy years old and this specific batch of originals was particularly damaged.  The picture isn't perfect, but then again, neither is Popeye--the one-eyed, toothless, middle-aged scrapper--the unlikeliest of heroes.  The producers did the best they could to restore the films--and for me, that grittiness actually adds to the set's authenticity.  Looking forward to Vol. 3.",1214265600,19,2319,4.943298969072165

The constant up and down jitter and brightness changes, either from shrinkage or sprocket wear or decomposing prints, is fatiguing to watch. That could have been easily corrected by image stabilzation without causing artifacts. Compare any of the opening credits with those of Volume 1 and there is a HUGE difference.  The sound seemed tinny and lacking a low end. They look no better than the ""Popeye Show"" prints on Cartoon Network. And the 2 or 3 aap title cards were inexcusable! And the shimmery titles on ""the Jeep"" I have never seen even on a dollar store public domain DVD. Didn't they let Jerry Beck or anybody that is remotey familiar with these cartoons preview this set before they started pressing them?

3370156,3,B0014VPFHW,"This isn't really a review of the Popeye cartoons, but of one of the bonus cartoons on the set. Namely the Superman cartoon.  There are dozens of different companys putting out the Fleischer Superman cartoons, which are great.  But most of these public domain DVDs are poor quality.  I've been waiting for Warner to put out a collection, but aside from putting them on the complete movie collection they have yet to do so.  I'm not interested in the movies, and wasn't about to spend a fortune on the complete movie collection just to get the cartoons.  So when I saw that one was included on this set I was curious to see how it compared with the Bosko and Bridgestone disks (both distributed by Image) which I have.
  What a disappointment!  The cartoon - ""The Mechanical Monsters"", was the second one made and is one of the best.  But Warner has completely butchered it!  They've taken the beginning portion of the FIRST Superman cartoon (the part about Krypton) and edited it into this one right after the credits, completely eliminating the part about Superman's X-Ray vision on the ONLY cartoon that mentioned it in the opening! And with a horrible splice affecting the dialogue to boot!  Then they tacked on the wrong Paramount end logo!  What's up with that??  Is that Warner's idea of restoration?

3370158,5,B0014VPFHW,"POPEYE THE SAILOR: Volume Two 1938-1940: Released: June 17, 2008.
(Partial) DVD Review by Joe Torcivia.

Can you review such a set after just viewing the first eight cartoons?  Let's find out... Warning!  It's Long...

What a great series of Popeye cartoons we have to open Disc One of this new set!

By 1938, Max and Dave Fleischer have clearly broken with the formula they established early on... and the one that the Famous Paramount studio would do to death in their later Popeye cartoons.  You know... Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, triangle, spinach, Sock-o, etc.

In the first EIGHT cartoons on the disc, Bluto - and the formulaic conflict he brings with him - is nowhere in sight, save for a cameo appearance AS A PHOTOGRAPH (!) in the first one.  In these eight alone, we have a diversity of cast that would be unimaginable in later years.  Popeye, Olive, Wimpy, Swee'Pea, Eugene the Jeep, Poopdeck Pappy, the Goons... and, of course, the photograph of Bluto that (not unexpectedly) steals the only scene that it's in!

Before continuing, I should say that, despite my comments above, Bluto is one of the great villains in the history of theatrical animation, and most (if not all) of his appearances on the first POPEYE set (1933-1938) were very enjoyable.  But, in times to come, he will wear out his welcome (at least to me) and it is with this knowledge of what lies ahead that I take this position.  But, if we go much longer than these first eight without him, I'm going to really start missing the big lug!

Here's a (relatively, but not completely) Spoiler-Free recap of those first eight cartoons...

01:  ""I Yam Love Sick"". Enraptured in romance novels, and aided by a huge box of chocolates from Bluto - and that scene-stealing photograph - Olive totally ignores Popeye, to the point where he has to play sick-and-dying to get any attention.  ""I must be losin' me sex repeal, or sumpthin'!"" mutters the sailor man, in one of those famous Jack Mercer ad-libs where Popeye's mouth doesn't move!  She takes him to the hospital, where he continues to play almost-dead... until it's time to operate!

02:  ""Plumbing is a Pipe"".  I'm guessing that, in ye olde-tyme slang, if something was ""a pipe"", it was easy or ""a cinch"".  Olive springs a leak in her kitchen, which she compounds - and Popeye compounds much further.  Wimpy is great as the plumber, who keeps forgetting things or has other excuses like Lunch to keep from getting on the job.  He gets his later!

03: ""The Jeep"".  Swee'Pea keeps trying to escape Olive's very high apartment, by crawling out the window.  She thwarts him (Saying that he's giving her ""Populations of the heart!""), until he finally gets out!  Popeye shows up with Eugene the Jeep (a ""magical dog""!) who can accurately answer any question, disappear and reappear, and track anything with his uncanny abilities to walk through walls, on air, or anywhere else.  He tracks the missing Swee'Pea, leading Popeye on a merry - and painful - chase and to a great ending!

This is one of the two best cartoons on the disc so far!  Though it is not an origin for ""The Jeep""... he's just there with Popeye, visiting Olive.  Oddly, his animated origin occurs in ""Popeye Presents Eugene the Jeep"", which is the LAST cartoon on Disc Two - and was apparently produced by the Fleischers about TWO YEARS after this one.

The latter Jeep cartoon contradicts the former, in dealing with Eugene's origins, but that's to be expected from Golden Age animation.  The presence of the second cartoon, a good explanatory commentary on this cartoon, and an extra feature mini-documentary, ""Eugene the Jeep: A Breed of His Own"", detailing the Jeep's comic strip origins, help ease (...or maybe they ADD TO) the confusion over this odd and wonderful character.

04:  ""Bulldozing the Bull"".  Popeye's in Spain, Mexico, or somewhere that bullfighting is popular.  In this unexpectedly superior cartoon he demonstrates the more modern attitude (...and certainly not the prevailing attitude when this cartoon was made!) that the sport of bullfighting - and especially the killing of the bull - is cruelty to animals!  Olive is the obligatory seniorita (presaging the sort of role-playing she'd often do in later outings), and a seating mix-up leads to Popeye being a reluctant toreador.  Lots of good gags, and a great surprise ending that I will not spoil!  Popeye's steadfast values here left me clapping!  That's the Popeye I love from the comics, unflagging ethics and all!

05: ""Mutiny Ain't Nice"".  One of my general complaints about the POPEYE series is that he isn't shown often enough to be a SAILOR!  Well, here he captains his own cargo sailing ship, with a rough and dangerous crew to boot.  Olive falls into a trunk and is brought aboard as they shove off.  The crew believes that females are bad luck on a ship and, when they find Olive, they mutiny against Captain Popeye and try to kill Olive.  The great thing about this one (...and it's only a small spoiler in the greater scheme of things) is that Olive finds that she ACTUALLY ENJOYS leading the murderous crew on a wild chase!  Popeye, once regaining control, enacts a solution that satisfies everyone - just not the way any of them would like!

06:  ""Goonland"".  The best cartoon on the disc so far - and more of an adventure in the E.C. Segar comic strip tradition than the usual animated comedy.  Popeye sails (Yes, he's a sailor again!) to the mysterious ""Goon Island"", to find his lost ""Poopdeck Pappy"" who left 40 years ago, when Popeye was a baby!  Was Pappy animation's first ""deadbeat dad""? The Goons AND Pappy, from the Segar strip, are introduced in this one!

Pappy is a prisoner of the Goons, and wants no part of his son, until the Goons capture Popeye and try to kill him by staking him at the foot of a cliff and dropping a boulder on him. Pappy downs the spinach, which the Goons removed from Popeye, and saves the day.  The Goons are dealt with by a remarkable fourth-wall-breaking device that is both extremely clever and looks somewhat out of place at the same time.  You judge for yourself.  Its unexpected surprise value goes a long way toward selling it, though!

This is a magnificently designed cartoon!  Everything on Goon Island is eerie looking... especially for a cartoon of this period!  As with the introduction of Eugene the Jeep, a good explanatory commentary on this cartoon, and an extra feature mini-documentary, ""Poopdeck Pappy: The Nasty Old Man and the Sea"" detail Pappy's comic strip origins.

07:  ""A Date to Skate"".  With Bluto still among the missing, Popeye convinces a VERY reluctant Olive to roller skate in one of those old roller skating palaces.  As expected, Olive soon careens out of control, onto the street, wreaking havoc on the outside world!  The Fleischers continue to marvelously play with ""The Formula"" by having Popeye FORGET TO BRING HIS SPINACH on the skating date!  ""I must be gettin' OLD! Don't tell me I left it HOME!"" Don't worry; he gets some though a device we've seen in some other cartoons.  And, as when she was pursued by the crew of murderous mutineers, Olive ends up enjoying her near-death-ride for the sheer thrill of it all!  This is a take on the usually timid Olive that we seldom saw!  I guess THAT'S what Popeye sees in the old scarecrow!

08:  ""Cops is Always Right"".  A funnier than expected cartoon, where Popeye and his little crank-start, puttering car continuously run afoul of a gruff police officer.  And he helps Olive with spring cleaning to boot.  Popeye comes across a little more ignorant of the law than you'd expect even a one-eyed sailor to be, but it works anyway because the officer is such a good one-shot antagonist.

Alas, as was the Fleischer practice of the time, there are no writing credits on any of these first eight cartoons.  Though, story credits begin during the period covered by this DVD set, as the second Jeep cartoon lists a story credit. The lack of credits early-on is a particular shame, as the cartoons discussed in this review comprised a very innovative portion of the series, story-wise.  I'd sure love to know who wrote these!

The Fleischer animation is always tops, and Jack Mercer and Mae Questel (though Questel is replaced in some of these) are magnificent as Popeye and Olive - especially with their frequent and outright funny ad-libs!  Indeed, at this particular point in the history of animation, they would have been the most entertaining animation voice actors of their time.  But, look out for Mel Blanc lurking in the shadows...

So, on the basis of the first eight shorts (...and I have little expectation that this will change over the balance of the set), POPEYE THE SAILOR: Volume Two 1938-1940 is highly recommended by this reviewer!  And... Hey, Bluto?  We'll see ya soon, ol' pal!",1214006400,9,8804,4.753298153034301

The urban grittiness has been toned down, but the Fleischer spirit survives intact. Unfortunately, these Popeye cartoons lack the distinctive voices of Gus Wickie's Bluto and Mae Questel's Olive Oyl. (Wickie and Questel would not relocate to Miami with the Fleischers.)
