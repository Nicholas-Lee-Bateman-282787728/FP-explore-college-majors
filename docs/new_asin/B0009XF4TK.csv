Even his dog wasn't a close match!",1430438400,,539,4.242718446601942
8069470,4,B0009XF4TK,Kurt Russell was trying to break away from squeaky clean Disney roles and he did an amazing job in this film. After so many years of seeing him in super nice guy roles in Disney it shook me to the bone seeing how convincing he was in the role of mass killer/sniper Charles Whitman,1417392000,,280,4.203703703703703

8069472,5,B0009XF4TK,"The Deadly Tower aka Sniper is chillingly effective TV Movie back in the day when TV Movies actually meant something. This is a TV Movie detailing the massacre from the University Tower of Austin Texas by Charles Whitman, a deranged sociopath and ex-marine.

Kurt Russell who basically want to end his goody goody Disney image really accomplished that as his portrayal of the gun trotting killer. To other actors this might have been a career killer, but Russell made the change to showcase his acting skills, and the rest is history.

The movie even though it's supposed to be factual takes a lot of liberties especially the exclusion of officer Houston McKoy. It also cuts several facts such as Whitman strung out on amphetamines. It only tells us in less than a minute Whitman's letter to ""to whom it may concern"" about the irrational thoughts he is having.

With that said, ignoring all inconsistencies it nonetheless tells the story pretty much as it happen. Whitman was an psycho, being an ex-marine, he was extremely deadly. This happened in 1966 when most people wouldn't fathom such a massacre by an American. Nowadays, these massacres are common. A sad commentary on our society especially with some Americans need to arm themselves to the teeth.

The movie was directed by the great Jerry Jameson who did other notable TV Movie. It has other nice work by stars such as Ned Beatty, John Forsythe, and Pernelle Roberts.

God knows that classic gets thrown around with movies that don't deserve such praise but ""The Deadly Tower"" is a classic TV Movie on a real life incident. Can't believe this is the first review of this movie and why isn't there a DVD out already for this film?
