8091773,4,B000BS6XD4,"This video presented a variety of scientists from different areas of study expressing their analysis of evidence  of a superior intelligence given the structure, order, motion, energy and other phenomenon that are currently observable in the universe.
Various points were illustrated with colorful video graphics. A very helpful presentation.",1258156800,,342,5.979591836734694
8091774,1,B000BS6XD4,"This is based on the ""Intelligent Design Theory"", so for Christians looking to deepen their understanding of the role science plays in their faith...you are left very disappointed. The tile is ironic, because they do not refer to God, rather calling Him an ""Intelligent force/designer"".",1242950400,,286,5.377777777777778
8091775,2,B000BS6XD4,"The fact that I only paid about $4 for this is the only reason I'm not disappointed. This is very short, and does present a few good points by some qualified scientists. But when it ends, it feels abrupt, and you are left thinking, ""That was it?"" I would have appreciated a little more depth and detail, as well as more scientists in different fields. I'm not sure I'd recommend it even for the attention span challenged. As noted in another review, the host gets on your nerves and makes you want to fast forward to the real content. These two DVD's (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Privileged-Planet-Unlocking-the-Mystery-of-Life-2-DVD-Set/dp/B000COET9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Privileged Planet / Unlocking the Mystery of Life 2-DVD Set</a>) are much better. I would recommend those instead.",1193011200,7,849,5.854838709677419
8091776,5,B000BS6XD4,"I saw this when it aired on television and am excited to see that it is now available on DVD.  Like a lot of people, I suppose, I struggled at times with my faith; particularly as a student in college who gets hit all the time by my ""well-educated"" professors with all the reasons smart, scientifically informed people, like Laplace famously said, ""don't need the (God) hypothesis.""  This program does a great job of showing how truly smart, unbiased scientists who study the cosmos are relying upon the ""God hypothesis"" more and more.",1165795200,11,535,4.741935483870968
8091777,1,B000BS6XD4,"I have seen numerous DVDs on quantum physics and research around thought, the universe and matter.  This is the biggest waste of money out there.  The host is annoying, the film is poorly edited and contains nothing but surface information - if you want good material, buy THE SECRET, Your Immortal Brain, What the Bleep Do We Know and many others.  This one is a HUGE rip-off.",1159056000,3,377,4.597014925373134
8091778,5,B000BS6XD4,"I'll never forget reading George Greenstein's ""Symbiotic Universe"" and being stunned by his admission early on in the book:  that the growing mountain of evidence that the universe was designed by some infinite Intelligence (something this DVD wonderfully makes clear)literally sent him into a depression bordering on a psychotic episode.  His final resolution of the evidence ultimately wasn't to do what renowned ex-atheist Anthony Flew had the integrity and/or guts to do -- acknowledge that theism was the most intellectually honest resolution of the facts.  Instead he retreats to the ""just so"" perspective of the Weak Anthropic Principle (WAP) and then proceeds to celebrate the intricacies of the design that really isn't proof of a godlike designer!

What particularly interesting about this DVD is that most of the scientists interviewed (and the line-up is pretty incredible)acknowledge pretty much the same thing: that there sure looks to be a Creator who designed the cosmos but then stop short of saying that there is in fact a God.

Fascinating stuff and a DVD that will sure to provoke all kinds of intreresting discussion and debate.  Highly recommended.",1148256000,12,1170,5.297297297297297
8091779,2,B000BS6XD4,A real Dud... the commentator gets on your nerve real fast... and only has about two minutes of real content.  A missed opportunity to do a meaningful program.... don't approach getting your money worth on this effort.,1145750400,4,218,4.891891891891892
