8593808,2,B003ENHAO4,"As another reviewer implied, despite being billed as a documentary of the Atlanta indie scene in general at the time of its creation, this film is largely centered around the band Black Lips, to the point where I think I would not recommend viewing or purchasing it unless you are a big Black Lips fan.  As someone who is not a huge fan of theirs, and was hoping for a well-rounded, interesting documentary, I was left rather disappointed in several ways.  While quite a few other bands and personalities from the Atlanta indie scene are interviewed, the conversation always inevitably drifted to ""...So how do you feel about Black Lips?"" to the point where it would have been comical if it wasn't so frustrating.  Similarly, while there is concert footage as well as background music from several different Atlanta bands, the vast majority of both are Black Lips performances and songs.

At the risk of sounding judgmental and somewhat puritan, the film was also largely unpleasant for me because several of the people heavily featured came off, to be frank, as self-centered jerks who cared more about having a good time/getting trashed than creating music.  Maybe it was just because the film focused, in my opinion, too much in the way of Atlanta apparently being a great city to have a wild party, but I really don't care about people I've mostly never heard of getting wasted.  I do not know these people, so I don't want to speculate about whether or not they are ""bad"" people or not.  But when the highlights of a band (in a film largely about themselves, no less) include dissing local legends Subsonics for ""not getting out enough"" and ruining a photo shoot by immaturely setting off a fire extinguisher and causing the building to be evacuated, well... let's just say you're not creating the best impression, especially in the eyes of someone who isn't that familiar with you in the first place.

In addition to all of my previous grievances, the biggest issue I have overall is that a great deal of the film simply feels superfluous.  As the same reviewer I mention before said, there is precious little which documents how the scene came to be the way it is presently, how exactly all of these people know and influence each other (unless they are Black Lips), or why exactly the scene is meaningful enough to have a feature-length film dedicated to its existence.  And when the topics I mentioned are covered, the people elaborating upon them are almost always so drunk and/or high that it feels pointless.  As I said before, I came to this film looking for substance, not strangers getting intoxicated.

That being said, the documentary does have a few redeeming moments.  My personal favorite begins when a local concert promoter recounts an anecdote about meeting Deerhunter lead singer Bradford Cox for the first time when Cox was but a precocious 13 year old who loved Nirvana.  The story is a short moment - maybe a minute or so long - but I found it quite endearing, and it is followed by a pretty nifty live performance of Deerhunter's song ""Cavalry Scars.""  (Of course, after that it then cut to the filmmakers more or less asking Cox ""...So how do you feel about Black Lips?"" but for as long as it lasted, it was nice.)  There are also several other moments that are informative or at the very least amusing, but for the most part, the entire documentary comes off as very single-minded and more than a little self-absorbed.",1325376000,,3448,4.721666666666667
8593809,3,B003ENHAO4,"Being someone from Atlanta who actually knows/knew several of the people in this film, I enjoyed seeing this movie for that reason alone. It is a document of a music scene at a particular point in time that basically revolves around a few bands that have become indie rock darlings.

As far as the music goes in this movie, Deerhunter continue to be a great band, that layer a lot of influences together in a psychedelic wash that make words irrelevant. It was great seeing the Subsonics included, an old school Atlanta band who I played some gigs with back in the day. The film touchs on Mastodon (though they couldn't afford to license their music), arguably the most successful rock band to come out of the ATL since the Black Crowes. The film showcases the Black Lips pretty well, with their neo-punk attitude that pretty much outshines their music, they are the bratty kids that changed the Atlanta scene for good or bad, devolving a pretty diverse musical landscape into a distortion laid garage punk mess that it is today.

As a documentary, I think it could have been better. The Black Lips attitude seems to be that of the film makers as well. Every interview that is conducted is done while ""partying"" with the bands and everyone, for the most part, is drunk or high and poorly elaborates on what they think the ""Atlanta scene"" is or what it means to them or the rest of the world. I don't know what questions the interviewers may have been asking but very few of them actually had to do with music. I know that Bradford Cox from Deerhunter has a variety of influences and an interesting perspective on ""the scene"" but all they ever asked him about was the Black Lips. There is very little here that documents how the current Atlanta scene evolved and leaves you feeling like you've been to a party that got you drunk but in the end you don't really remember anything about it other than a couple of catchy tunes.

If you are from Atlanta and you have been paying attention to the music scene here then you will find some enjoyment here but if you are from else where, you might only walk away with a small glimpse of a scene that is much more complex and storied than what is presented here.",1283817600,3,2202,4.486284289276808
