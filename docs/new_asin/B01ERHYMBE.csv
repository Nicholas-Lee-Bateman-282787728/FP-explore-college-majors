7739525,5,B01ERHYMBE,"This is a wonderful movie and a must see for all animal lovers, not just horse people. I loved how the real horses rescued played themselves and were written into the ending credits. I recommend watching the very end through because while this is a sweet story, the ranch where this movie was filmed, Red Bucket Equine is an actual 501(c)3 non-profit organization that relies on donations.",1467849600,12,389,4.82089552238806
7739526,5,B01ERHYMBE,"Great movie, great actors, and the best of all Chance (Willow and Rubix).  This is a great movie for the whole family.  It has a great message about second chances, the bond between a horse and a girl, the peer pressure of school and how to rise above it all.",1467763200,9,259,4.16
7739527,5,B01ERHYMBE,"""Emma's Chance"" is a wonderful, family-friendly horse movie with a great message for us all. Starring Greer Grammer (yes, Kelsey Grammar's daughter), Joey Lawrence, and Missy Pyle, ""Emma's Chance"" tells the story of a young girl who must work at a horse rescue ranch as a punishment for getting into trouble with her mean girl friends. She falls in love with the ranch and the horse Chance and helps save the ranch with her newly-found riding skill. She overcomes the peer pressure of her mean girl friends and shows young girls that it's OK to not to fall in love with the basketball star even when he likes you. Directed by Anna Elizabeth James in her directorial debut, ""Emma's Chance"" is a great evening of entertainment for the entire family.",1467763200,11,747,4.753846153846154
7739528,2,B01ERHYMBE,"A slow moving, mostly boring film, with mediocre acting.

7739580,3,B01ERHYMBE,"It was a very well produced teen drama about redemption - for both horses and people. At the risk of being nostalgic, it reminded me of Flicka, Black Beauty and The Black Stallion. As we are well into the next century, though, I fear that stories about redemption are pass. I recommend this for all adults with some maturity, all pre-teens who are looking for good examples. I am happy that I have the DVD so that I can pass this along to my grandchildren.",1470009600,4,456,4.376470588235295

7739584,5,B01ERHYMBE,The movie was wonderful. It's enjoyable to see a movie the entire family can watch without worrying about sex and violence folded into the story. We thought Emma's Chance was a movie that wanted the viewer to realize that there is a need for compassion. Gandhi was quoted as saying 'The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated.' Emma's Chance send a wonderful message to all of us that our horses are in need of greater compassion.,1469577600,,462,4.511904761904762
7739585,4,B01ERHYMBE,Typical cheesy horse movie. Typical story of the girl who has never seen a horse who goes on to save the day with her riding skills that she somehow develops over a matter of a few weeks instead of the yrs it takes most people. Some inconsistency in that a rescue operation is not going to have one of the most expensive saddles on the market but only horse people are going to see that. Cute enough movie with a decent pace.,1469577600,,425,4.195121951219512
7739586,4,B01ERHYMBE,This was a nice story.  It was enjoyable.  The actress rode the horse well.,1469491200,,75,4.285714285714286

7739594,5,B01ERHYMBE,I love the movie.,1469232000,,17,3.5
7739595,5,B01ERHYMBE,"This movie is inspired by the Red Bucket Equine Rescue in Chino Hills, California.  Emma's Chance is an entertaining and touching movie that
my fifteen year old daughter (who is picky about movies) enjoyed.  She liked that the teens in the movie were not portrayed ""over-dramatically""
as we so often see. It was filmed on site at Red Bucket and even several of the resident horses are featured.  The muscial score is superb.
Emma, played by Greer Grammer  ( Actor Kelsey Grammer's daughter) is required to do community service for having committed a dangerous
prank.  Having no experience with horses she begins barn chores and once she rolls her sleeves up and puts on her boots she realizes
she likes it.  She likes being part of the team and their mission to save horses from slaughter.  Emma develops a special relationship with a horse named Chance.  Together, they rise to the occasion to help the financially strapped Red Bucket Equine rescue.  In the end, all positive acts born of kindness, caring and respect for living creatures (who can not advocate for themselves) make a difference.  Emma's Chance empowers us all.",1468972800,2,1128,4.889473684210526

7739599,5,B01ERHYMBE,"This movie is a great movie for those with families who are looking for an uplifting film about horses and personal growth. The film is set at a horse rescue Red Bucket that truly does exist. The horses in the movie were played by resident rescue horses. This movie tells the story of Red Bucket but contains a fictional ending where a large check is given and the ranch is saved. In reality the ranch is in need of donations.
The movie is definitely worth watching as it teaches some valuable lessons on personal responsibility and the difference between right and wrong. It is a story where a high school girl gets in with the stereotypical popular crowd that try to steer her into making poor choices. Luckily she ends up with community service at a horse rescue and makes a special bond with a horse that was brought in while she was there. Very uplifting ending that brought tears to my eyes!",1468800000,,897,4.50920245398773

7739601,5,B01ERHYMBE,I saw this movie recently and it was excellent.  A family movie with great message.  The Red Bucket is a real Equine Rescue facility in Chino Hills and they do wonderful work saving horses and donkeys from slaughter houses.  I recommend you see the movie and visit the Red Bucket to see for yourself all the good things they do.,1468800000,,328,4.433333333333334
7739602,5,B01ERHYMBE,"My review may be a little biased because my family is involved with the horse rescue, Red Bucket, that is featured in the film, but I have to say that we love this movie! It sheds a much needed light on the plight of our American horses and what fate awaits them if places like Red Bucket didn't exist. The story is very sweet and it sends a positive message about true friendships and the importance of giving back. It is a perfect family film. As parents of young daughters, it is hard to find a movie that is appropriate without violence or sexual undertones. This movie doesn't have any of that. It is a simple story of a teenage girl finding herself through giving to others. Watch it!",1468713600,10,690,4.3565891472868215
