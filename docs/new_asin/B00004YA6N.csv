1374457,1,B00004YA6N,"BLOOD MANIA features an old man who is sick and slowly dying. His daughter, Victoria, lives with him but the two can't seem to stand each other. The man's doctor, Dr. Cooper, is blackmailed by a former colleague for $50,000. It is money he doesn't have and has no idea where he will get it. Victoria has a thing for Dr. Cooper and agrees to give him part of her inheritance if he'll help her get rid of dear old dad. But, there is another daughter, named Gail, who returns home for the reading of her father's will and as it turns out dad leaves her most everything and Victoria just enough to live upon. Well, Victoria goes crazy and Gail falls for Dr. Cooper and things just turn nonsensical. Characters and key subplots (for instance, Dr. Cooper's wife who is featured prominently in the beginning of the movie) disappear as though they never existed. There's very little blood or gore. The dialogue seems like it was written by a native-speaking Chinese person who tried to translate bad Spanish into English. Oh, and the acting is atrocious. The ending does have a bit of a twist, but like most of the rest of the movie it doesn't really make any sense either. The movie is good for a few laughs, but that's about it.",1267574400,,1222,4.459821428571429
1374458,1,B00004YA6N,"This movie is a complete nasty.  Its a total shocker.  Wont ramble on, but if you want any satisfaction out of this, just see it as a comedy and nothing else.  And what was the story behind that carnival sequence ????.  My friend and I were in complete hysterics laughing on the floor because it appeared to just be chucked in amongst all of this nonsense.  A definate no no.",1071532800,,375,4.3
1374459,2,B00004YA6N,"Blood Mania (1970) features surprisingly little blood and not a whole lot of mania, either.  The film does not even have an opening credits scene, so obviously the title's relevance to the story was not overly important to the filmmakers.  There really is not a whole lot to Blood Mania, but to its credit it does manage to throw in a little surprise at the very last minute.  We start with a grouchy old man confined to his bed, trading verbal shots with his daughter Victoria, with whom he seems to share a hate-hate relationship.  The father's friend, colleague, and personal physician Dr. Cooper finds himself owing $50,000 to a blackmailer for some of his youthful medical indiscretions, and Victoria vows to help him and thereby win the equivalent of his up to now unrequited love.  Her plan for getting the money involves claiming some of her inheritance, the only snag being the fact that her father is still alive.  Of course, things are never as simple as they seem, especially when prodigal daughters return home after seven years for the reading of a father's will.  Basically, we have a set of characters who hold some degree of power over each other in turn, the weakest link in the chain being, of course, Victoria; she adds what little mania there is to the story, while everyone else offers up nothing more impressive than ambivalence if not outright boredom.

This film retained my interest throughout, but as I said, there is really nothing special at all about anything that happens.  The film looks its age, the plot is unoriginal and by and large predictable, the several nude scenes are just weird and the opposite of erotic, and there is far from enough blood here to qualify this movie for anything resembling its self-proclaimed Blood Mania status.  Inconvenient Frustrations might be a more appropriate title.",1057968000,3,1836,4.8370607028754
7927225,1,B00004YA6N,"Craig is a young doctor with a promising career until bad choices in his past come back to haunt him in the form of blackmail.  Enter Victoria.  She is the daughter of one of Craig's wealthiest patients, and she wants the good doctor for herself.  She will do anything to have him even to the point of killing her own father for the money Craig needs.  When the plan doesn't go as planned more people are destined to make the transition to lifeless corpse. This is Blood Mania.

One of the biggest things that holds this movie back is the perceived need for vast amounts of nudity.  For one thing it leads to scenes that do nothing for the story.  For another thing the female cast seems to have been hired more for their bust sizes than for their acting ability.  The only girl that's really any good at all is the nurse (who never undresses like the others).  The male cast is better (slightly), but they can't make up for their lacking costars.

Another issue is Craig's wife (or live-in girlfriend, whatever she is, I don't recall the nature of their relationship ever being specified).  She makes a deal with the blackmailer.  He can do the horizontal mambo with her if he'll leave Craig alone.  He agrees but makes it clear he has no intentions of living up to his part of the bargain once her part of the deed is done.  There is no follow up to this, ever.  In fact we never see or hear about this girl again.  Maybe the actress decided she wanted to wear clothes for once and was therefore cut from the cast without the foresight to write a reason for it into the story.  Craig acts like she never existed, and nothing comes from her giving up sex in a failed attempt to put a stop to the blackmail.

At times the film tries to be artistic with its scenes of drugged out sex. Instead of being engaging it slows the already dragging plot to be even more dull. The crappy soundtrack doesn't help.

I guess mostly this just comes across as nothing special unless you have an affinity for grindhouse (which I obviously dont).  There's no strong sense of suspense.  The surprise at the end is stupid.  There's no mystery (we know who the killer is because we see the murders happen).  There's no reason to watch at all unless you just want to see boobs.

Content:
If I was vague before, then let me be clear, there is a ton of nudity in this.  Someone is getting naked every couple of scenes. This includes sex and molestation. There is also some drug use and a couple of scenes of bloody violence.

DVD:
I got mine in a pack of 50 Drive-In Movie Classics.  The audio has some light white noise.  Even without that it is not well mixed: scenes of kissing sound more like sticks breaking.  The video is one of the few in this collection that is widescreen.  It's surprisingly clean compared to the rest of the set but still is not very high quality.  The Mill Creek logo pops up periodically which is insanely annoying.  There are no extras. A TV edit exists. This cut does not look suitable for TV so I believe it is the original, but I don't know any details about the differences in the edits and therefore can't say for sure.

Vinegar Syndrome has a Blu-ray double feature with a high quality transfer and some good-looking extras. There are a few other DVD options with most of them being multi-movie sets, but I couldn't find any others that look like they will offer good quality or anything else.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
Avoid this poorly written bore. Run away! Run away! If you go looking anyway that Blu-ray is far superior to anything else I could find, but the movie itself is not worth the trouble in my opinion. I give it a generous 1*.",1518652800,,3646,4.392537313432836
7927226,2,B00004YA6N,"Midpoint spoilers.

Dr. Craig Cooper (Peter Carpenter) is being blackmailed for $50,000 because he performed abortions to get through med school (1970 film). He ends up sleeping with Victoria (Maria De Aragon) a ""young and evil soul"" who is willing to give him the money after she struck out with the pool boy (Reid Smith). Her daddy (Eric Allison) has a bad heart and is attended to by Cooper who works at his clinic. Meanwhile Craig's girlfriend Cheryl (Reagan Wilson) is sleeping with the blackmailer Larry Mills (Arell Blanton) to try to pay him off.

The film opens up with a scantily clad woman (Vicki Peters) running through the woods being followed and caught by a man walking slowly. The story wasn't put together too well. If not for the evil over-sexed Victoria, it wouldn't be a film.

7927229,2,B00004YA6N,"Okay, so the whole premise of this flick doesn't make a lick of sense. In some ways, this movie reminds me a bit of a 60's version of The Addams Family, as it features a sophisticated, middle-aged couple that lives in a rented castle and are quite open about their vampirism. The dialog between the spooky castle residents and the innocent young couple is so corny, it could have been penned by Ed Wood himself.
 It doesn't matter. What matters is this is good, cheesy fun for the whole family, if your whole family is plenty drunk.",1432080000,2,532,4.484536082474227
7927230,1,B00004YA6N,"The copy on this is wrong.  It is offered as a Gothic horror movie.  No.  It is pornography, with a shallow, nudity-encrusted story line (calling it a story line is actually giving more credit than due), and is not about vampires or whatever, its about skin.  A total piece of please-avoid garbage.  I turned it off after at best 15minutes.",1417219200,,340,4.6

7927232,3,B00004YA6N,"Dr. Craig Cooper (Peter Carpenter) is doing illegal abortions on the side (This is 1970, before Roe v Wade). He's also shagging just about any woman that gets near him! The psychedelic love scenes are a hoot! Dr. Cooper needs $50,000 to pay off a blackmailer. Cooper gets involved w/ a woman named Victoria who says she can get him the money. As it turns out, her ailing dad is loaded, and she wants him dead anyway. How conveeenient! You see, old daddy has a heart condition, so daughter dearest uses amyl nitrate (supplied by Doc Cooper) to send him to heaven.  The look on dad's face when his heart explodes is priceless! Alas, the reading of dad's will turns out to be a supreme downer for Victoria. She loses what little mind she has left when her sister Gail inherits the money. Of course, Cooper immediately makes a play for her. He finds out too late that Victoria is a homicidal maniac. Mega-death ensues. BLOOD MANIA is a rather silly film from CROWN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES. It's also a lot of fun to watch.

7927233,3,B00004YA6N,"Disclaimer: This movie is included in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gorehouse-Greats-Collection/dp/B002DHACSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gorehouse Greats Collection</a>, which is the version that I watched.  Comments concerning this film only apply to the entertainment value of the movie, and not the quality of the film transfer on this disc.

A sexy, psychotic heiress falls for her ailing father's doctor, who is being blackmailed for performing illegal abortions.  In order to snare him, the heiress is willing to commit murder to get at her inheritance, but there's a sister to account for too, one who may end up having a stronger draw on the doctor - over and above the money she stands to gain.  Things go from bad to worse as everyone angles for the best position, until the tension finally breaks in an evening of 'blood mania'.

This films seems to have an identity problem - is it horror? is it a thriller? is it soft-core?  There's enough scenes of a (purported) erotic nature that it could as well have been called 'Sex Mania', although that would make the ending an unexpected downer.  And even though there's little suspense, it seems obvious that that's what director Robert O'Neill was going for.  But the sex isn't steamy enough unless you've never *had* sex before, the tension is thin enough to be ladled out with a spoon, and the 10 minutes of mania at the end hardly justifies sitting around for the previous 78.  However, if the disparate themes had meshed better (more along the lines 'Basic Instinct' - like it or hate it), or if at least the film's title was changed to something less indicative of a slasher film, then the film may have earned a third star.  As it is, both the title and the cover art for the DVD come across as disengenious.

There is also a strange bit of discontinuity to the film - during the opening credits, there is a dream sequence that has the father, Ridgely Waterman (Eric Allison) bloodlessly stalking a young girl in a negligee - a girl that may be his daughter Gail (Vicki Peters).  Later in the film, there is another dream sequence, this time by Gail, which contains shades of the first, and it is almost as if there was another element to the storyline that was never pursued, something that may have indicated that the father visited serious abuse on his daughters.  That might explain the mental makeup of the daughter that remains with him (Maria de Aragon), and also why Gail only returned to the ancestral home after her father was dead, but the bones of this tangent are never fleshed out.  One has to wonder if these scenes weren't added later to pad the story and to make the film more appealing to the horror crowd, or if the budget ran out before the editors could make the film coherent.  Either way, it points to a film that, as a psycho-sexual thriller, is weak in all areas.

The film stars several Crown International Pictures alumni or those who would go on to star in other CIP productions: Peter Carpenter is the young doctor (and who died only a year after the release of this film - no cause listed), Maria de Aragon as the nympho heiress (also was one of the actors to play Greedo in the original - Han shot first - Star Wars), Leslie Simms as the father's nurse, and Arell Blanton and Alex Rocco in bit parts, whom we get to see together again a year later in the atrocious biker flick 'Wild Riders'.  At least here Rocco shows his range, as he plays a character 180 degrees different from the wild rider Stick, but Blanton is just as sleazy and gutter-trash as he would be later.

The picture and sound on the 'Gorehouse Greats collection' is servicable for the type of film that it is, so I assume this individually packaged disc will probably make the grade too.  Mileage will certainly vary on this film, but it will probably be best enjoyed by those who are not looking for horror so much as suspense.  Unfortunately, both on this discs packaging and from being included in a collection called 'Gorehouse Greats', most people won't know that, and think, as I did, that we were about to get a run-of-the-mill slasher flick, as opposed to a run-of-the-mill jealous heiress flick.  Two and 1/2 stars.",1286323200,5,4240,4.7493188010899186
