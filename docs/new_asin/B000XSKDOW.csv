The film is raunchy, but that has more to do with positions than with naughty bits.  Many people say comedy is culture-specific.  Remember that Jackie Chan admitted he had no idea why American audiences like the ""Rush Hour"" franchise.  However, I understood most of the humor here.  By the end of the film, I didn't understand one aspect of the plot and the way it was filmed was poorly done.  There is some girl-girl action near the end that many viewers will like, but if you think hard, it has nothing to do with the storyline.  It's purely there for eye candy.
This did have some jokes that American audiences would have seen in ""There's Something About Mary"" and Jenny McCarthy's film.  Still, I was entertained enough by this.  Timewise, this film was much shorter than your average American film, so even if you despise it, it doesn't last long.
Most sex comedies are not Oscar-worthy, so if you go in knowing this is not ""On Golden Pond"" or whatever, then you may have a decent time with the piece.",1260144000,16,1217,4.490909090909091
