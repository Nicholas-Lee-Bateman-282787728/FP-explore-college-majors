8595374,5,B008P76VV2,"One very good reason to consider this set is the inclusion of ""Solti: The Making of a Maestro"". It's a fascinating glimpse into the evolution of a great musician mainly told in his own words. From its opening in Solti's birthplace in Hungary to its denouement in Chicago, this documentary provides a special insight into a somewhat complex individual. Solti's formative years are covered in detail as is his relentless drive to perfect his craft. Along the way there are stops in Budapest, Munich, Salzburg, Vienna, Lucerne, London, and, ultimately Chicago. As for the performances, each of the five included is the happy amalgam of momentum, intensity and refinement. Here and there Solti drives the proceedings a bit, a tendency which earned the conductor the sobriquet of the fastest baton in the West. The brilliance, rhythmic precision and dramatic acuity more than compensate. The ensemble is uniformly excellent, notably that of the CSO. The video and audio production values are just fine. One complaint regarding the packaging: the poorly designed DVD trays are inadequate. In a word, they stink!",1379462400,3,1105,5.17877094972067
