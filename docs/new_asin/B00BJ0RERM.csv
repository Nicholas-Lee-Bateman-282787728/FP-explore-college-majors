5625344,3,B00BJ0RERM,"I admit, I went into the film thinking this was going to be a total bomb, but a friend had a free ticket for a pre-release showing of the movie, so I thought, why not?

The Croods is a story about one of the last surviving pre-historic families that embark on a road trip looking for a new cave when their old cave is destroyed as the earth is going through many dramatic changes. If that wasn't enough for the Crood family to deal with, there is the father/daughter struggles throughout the storyline that any parent can relate to if they have had teenagers, especially daughters.

When the Croods daughter, Eep (Emma Stone) can't understand her Dad's mentality that ""fear is good; change is bad"" and having to live by his number one rule ""never leave the cave"" she starts to rebel and pushes the boundaries set by her Dad, the over-protective, Grug (Nicolas Cage). One of the characters I got a kick out of was Gran (Cloris Leachman) who is their wisecracking grandma who Grug is constantly hoping that she won't make it through their daily challenges. The rest of the Crood family includes Mom, younger brother and baby sister which are more or less ""extras"" to round out the family dynamic. On their journey to find a new cave, they meet Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who has evolved alot further then the Croods with his ability to make fire and shoes and his pet sloth who doubles as Guy's utility belt. Together they join in their journey in finding a new place to live, which Eep is desperately hoping won't be another cave.

I will admit that there were several moments that the movie was very predictable and the story line could have been a bit better. However,over all the movie was better than I thought it would be. I would suggest paying to see a matinee showing or wait until it comes out on DVD.",1362614400,46,1802,4.504587155963303

Even though I'm kind of ""whatever"" about the whole idea of so-called ""primitive"" man, the story isn't bad and well, you have to Ice Age-up the movie in order to make it watchable.

As for the movie it's self.  I wouldn't have bought it if I didn't like it, and feel my kids would enjoy it as well.

This is the first movie for which I've ever done that. I've introduced the rest of the family to it and sometimes we have it playing on multiple TVs at the same time. It's a totally fun movie!

5625485,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I am a longtime 3-D movie buff and stereo photography hobbyist.

I am afraid I overlooked THE CROODS on its initial release, partly owing to expressions of indifference from some who had seen it. I should learn to ignore the naysayers. THE CROODS is terrific.

Although there is considerable humor, the story feels more like a lighthearted adventure than a comedy. Some of the situations faced by these lovable characters are genuinely harrowing, but the upbeat and hopeful tone of the film makes the whole thing bearable-- and repeatable. I expect to watch THE CROODS again and again.

I will add, if you should choose to visit THE CROODS, make every effort to do so in 3-D. As one who has seen several hundred stereoscopic films over the years-- and some of these repeatedly-- I think the deft use of stereo here, coupled with a very lovely color palette, makes this among the most visually beautiful 3-D films it has been my pleasure to see. I very cheerfully commend THE CROODS.",1493942400,,982,4.730994152046784

5625493,5,B00BJ0RERM,"True, the plot trope of daddy disapproves of the guy his precious daughter wants to date has been used countless times in films. However the Croods puts a fun twist to the reason why Grug is so overprotective: the world is dangerous place where everyone in his tribe has been killed in random accidents. He is just a guy that is trying to keep his family alive, yes, even his mother-in-law which adds to the humor.

Eep believes her father is being overly neurotic and in her enthisasm to explore the world, she meets a funny teenager guy named Guy who just happens to be on a desperate trip to reach a safe place before the continent where they are standing on splits apart. If some aspects of the plot seem to be a rehash Ice Age for utter convinience, I guess the board of directors of 20th Century Fox has some say in this.

In the end, the film is engaging with a huge focus on character development, mainly the growth of Grug and how he relates with Eep. It's definitely a film for fathers to watch with their daughters. It is little surprise they will be releasing a sequel very soon. I hope it doesn't jump the shark like other big budget films have.",1492214400,,1158,4.356481481481482

I think most of us can relate to their struggles to some extent as well, especially the struggle between growing children who want to be more independent and parents who aren't quite ready.  There are some very pretty colors and creative scenes.  A few scenes could possibly scare a child, but I think that would probably be rare, especially since there is so much cominc relief.  Again, really cute.  As an adult, I laugh throughout this movie myself.",1478736000,,578,4.663366336633663

5625731,4,B00BJ0RERM,This film really emphasized the role of a father. Throughout the film the viewer can see how the father is the leader of the family. He's the one that feels responsible for the protection of his family. The reason that he did not want them to leave the cave until he told them to was because if something bad happens to them he would feel responsible. Grug's leadership was tested when Guy appeared because Grug was noticing that his family was agreeing more with Guy than with him. Grug liked making the decision for his family. Grug realizes that trying to protect his family was what led them apart. Something that is shown is that family members argue and many times bud heads but at the end of the day family is more important than any silly argument. Towards the end of the film you were able to see the unity of the family as they did not want to go on with out Grug and Grug used his family as motivation to reunited with them once again.,1478649600,,946,4.320224719101123

Which is better;staying safe or taking risks? This is the premise of ""The Croods"" as the Crood family and Guy, a newcomer, experience tectonic plate shifts and other violent geologic events together. Interspersed with these big changes, though, are Eden-like ecosystems where the colors are vibrant and inviting. Emma Stone, Nicholas Cage, and Ryan Reynolds are perfectly cast.",1474243200,,588,5.26595744680851

5626021,5,B00BJ0RERM,"My grandson is only 2 and LOVES this movie!  I actually think it is pretty good also!  The Croods, about a cavemen family who rarely venture out of their dark cave for fear of dying horrible, prehistoric deaths, has a tight script, inspired voice performances and some unexpectedly tender moments.
  Eep, the teenage daughter of Grug, her paternal warden who lives his life in constant fear of the unknown and has taught the rest of his family to live a routine, reclusive life that only involves emerging from the darkness every few days to hunt down a giant egg to eat. The rebellious daughter who longs for freedom.
  The story picks up once the family meets Guy, a slender young man with a more advanced brain capable of coming up with solutions for common everyday caveman problems (shoes, umbrellas, stilts, fire, etc) and he warns them that, yes, their entire valley is about to get swallowed up by earthquakes and lava. From there, poor Guy is basically, for lack of a better term, thumped on the head and forced to lead them to a higher plateau. The fun here though is Grug's hatred of Guy's intellect and Eep's methods of courting a boy - which mostly involve accidentally pummeling him. Also, through the lens of Guy, we're able to see just how hilariously inept The Croods are at just about everything.

There is a lot of physical humor in The Croods, but - shockingly - none of it involves bodily functions! There's slapstick galore, and a ton of hyperkinetic action-y chase sequences, but they all come together nicely.  In fact, one of the most entertaining sequences in the movie happens within the first five minutes when the Croods head out and try to track down breakfast. You'll still find a lot of animated movie staples in this one; the idiot, the sassy granny, the cute animal sidekick.",1473984000,4,1809,4.684542586750789

But underneath the hilarity and memorability, there is an endearing story that has earned this movie its' place in the ""Classic"" hall of fame (at least IMHO.)

Amazon Digital is wonderful--it's nice to have this movie there in my forever library so I can watch it whenever and wherever I wish. The process was simple--press buy and viola! It showed up in my library.",1472083200,,565,4.755102040816326

5626175,5,B00BJ0RERM,I thought this was a seriously funny movie for kids. It has enough puns and little jokes that adults get that are over the kids heads but doesn't get inappropriate.  The jokes if the kids can figure it out they don't go to far. I hate it when kids movies go a little too far with adult jokes like they can sometimes do. I'm not big on censoring my kids too much but there some cartoons that I think go past the line. However I do like a little bit of humor aimed at adults in my kids cartoons because normally we're watching them for a family movie night.  I think this movie did pretty well on walking that line.,1471910400,,613,4.1

I purchased a player (from Amazon) that was supposed to play all A B C territory movies.  It did not.  Sent the player back yesterday.  So much for wasting my money on this movie that I really like, but can't watch.  I could not send the movie back as I had opened it & tried to watch it.  The moral of this dilemma is to be aware of what territory the movies (you want to buy) are made in.  I feel that Amazon should have made that fact available.  I am so disappointed.",1471910400,,594,4.051724137931035

I personally don't like this type of animation and I guess I'm at that age where I think I'm ""too good"" for feel good kiddie shows, so I'm glad I was physically restrained until I got into it (which wasn't that long surprisingly).  The dad is the typical Neanderthal meathead that you can't not dislike, but the rest of it made up for it.  I really appreciated the moral of the story as I'm a full fledged subscriber to the carpe diem life plan.  Don't just survive, THRIVE!",1470441600,,625,4.356521739130435

The whole family is hilarious but watching the evolution of the family is so much fun as they slowly start to accept Guy's ideas. The hilariousness of watching them interact with Guy is great too.

5626754,4,B00BJ0RERM,"Its a cute movie.  Took my kids to see it in theaters and we all enjoyed the story and funny moments.  As a parent, this movie is acceptable to all ages.  It is placed in the prehistoric era when dinosaurs roamed (although the movie takes some creative license and makes up some other creature, plants, environments) that remind me of Dr. Seuss.  All in all its a story of overcoming fear, taking a risk, learning to trust.

I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because movies are subjective and although this is quite good, it didn't wow me or leave me wanting to immediately watch it again and again.",1468540800,,601,4.378378378378378

5626775,4,B00BJ0RERM,"Show starts out to slow to capture the kids attention. I would blame the instant gratification from their cellphones but it does start slow (I blame their parents buying them the cells). If you can wait for it to pick up, you end up with a sweet father/teenage daughter story -boyfriend & all. Even when the world is blowing up all around, daddy's little girl better not date the only ""Guy"" around, even if he is going to save them all.  Reminds me of the end of 'Battleship' - ""Saving the world is one thing, my daughter is another"" (something like that).  -1star for slow starting beginning cartoon aimed at small kids.",1468454400,,621,4.535714285714286
5626776,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I got stuck watching this with my niece when I was babysitting.  I thought it would be a boring children's movie, but it was MUCH better than I expected!

The setting is fairly original, the characters were approachable and the animation was really well done.  Also, the story line was great and better developed than most children's movies.

The best part?  It was full of humor from start to finish and managed to keep both of our attentions, despite the 25-year age gap between us!

If you're looking for an original, very creative, comedic and visually fulfilling movie to watch with the family, the Croods should be first on your list!

I laughed throughout the movie as did my kids ranging from 4 - 15. It is just one of those movies that is funny to adults and children alike. It was great to see how the writers used fears from modern day and were able to tweak them to how the dad of the clan had fears. Nicholas Cage was the perfect actor to have as the worrying and over-protective dad. He voiced it so well. And the bickering between the dad and the mother-in-law totally comical.",1468368000,2,629,4.206611570247934

They need to change in order to survive the harsh environment. The father then enlists the help of a stranger to help them adapt. Our 4 year old cried at the end but was relieved and ended up okay not to give any spoilers. Not everyone will agree with our opinion but we enjoyed this as much as our kids.

5626994,5,B00BJ0RERM,"You wouldn't want to live with the Croods. Watching them go about their life in this movie is a delight! This is a great movie to teach kids about courage and responsibility and learning to adapt and grow.  Most great kids movies, it seems that one parent or another  is dead, or will soon be! Also it seems many kid based stories if the parent is alive, they are going to be a bad parent.  This is a total twist of the classic old tales. It more about building a family bond as they go about defeating one challenge over another.  You will laugh, maybe even cry a little. Im sure a few times your inner child will laugh at almost every scene.

Animation is great! Dreamworks did a great job. Even though its not in 4k, it looks amazing to watch on my 4k monitor. Color is vivid and sharp. The landscapes come alive, almost seem a little real. The caricatures are cute, silly and funny. From every facial expression to the tiny hairs and fur on the animals. They are seem to come alive. This is one of those movies I love and have watched many times. I think a good chance you will love it too!",1467244800,2,1094,4.215311004784689

5627118,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I love this movie! This is a great family comedy. Its about a curious and adventurous teenage girl (Eep) who lives with her extremely cautious and overprotecting caveman family The Croods! They believe they are the last family left, but Eep discovers Guy a risky teen boy and after The Croods  cave and home is destroyed Eep and her family follow Guy who is full of ideas and plans, one thing The Croods don't have! The journey is full of new discoveries, and lots of typical family issues that will keep you laughing through the whole movie! This is a movie about a family that takes risks together and how they grow through the ups and downs of the risks even if they are scary at first.",1466985600,2,689,4.425196850393701
5627119,5,B00BJ0RERM,"My daughter LOVES this movie. I was so glad that Amazon had a sale on this.

Prehistoric family the Croods live in a particularly dangerous moment in time. Patriarch Grug (Nicolas Cage), his mate, Ugga (Catherine Keener), teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone), son Thunk (Clark Duke) and feisty Gran (Cloris Leachman) gather food by day and huddle together in a cave at night. When a more evolved caveman named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) arrives on the scene, Grug is distrustful, but it soon becomes apparent that Guy is correct about the impending destruction of their world.",1466985600,,566,4.957894736842105

5627421,3,B00BJ0RERM,"The Croods is a big budget animated film with an interesting premise in search of a story. It gives us a sequence after sequence of a cave-dweller family coming to terms with a a very fast changing world that challenges any notions of mortality that we may have about our homo- sapien forefathers. But then its an animated film and death proofness shall not be held against them. Heck! its not the case for any Die Hard film, so a bunch of animated characters have all the right to survive rough landings from zillion foot high cliffs. And since the primary audience for this latest Dreamwork's "" product"" is likely to be children accompanied by guilt ridden parents it can be safely assumed that all the cute slapstick action will hit home with its core tiny- tot audience.

As the cave painting inspired credits roll we are introduced via voice-over to the The Crood family led by a brawny father named Grug, who guards his flock with a fierce adherence to the laws of survival he has learned the hard way. It involves as less interaction with the outside world as possible, which means spending much time in a claustrophobic cave and killing all notions of curiosity, which killed not just the cat but most of his brethren. This goes against the nature of his vivacious daughter Eep who craves to see what lies outside the cave. The premise is as old as the hills and the Neanderthal man. Soon enough her wishes are answered and they find themselves catapulted into a world very different from the one they knew and they must survive and make up new rules along the way. As it turns out the only new rule they need, is that there are no rules, and they must use a part of the body they haven't paid much attention to thus far  namely the brain. Grug says he doesn't need brains and flexes his muscles to illustrate his hair brained point.

His foil in the new psychedelic, dangerous and seductively beautiful world is Guy, who is a young chap with the gumption of Tom Sawyyer and Huck Finn rolled into one, the type that young girls that cant help but fall in love with. Guy and his success in saving their fur covered behinds on countless occasions makes Grug jealous and insecure as the gang stumbles from one deadly animal attack to another. They will discover fire, grey matter and importantly shoes in the process. The cry of ecstasy that Eep lets out when she first wears a pair of boots tells us that in the very distant future a certain Mr Jimmy Choo will become a billionaire and male-kind's nemesis. The Croods examines its characters with the same nonchalance that Grug makes drawings on caves to illustrate his ""put you head in a hole in the ground theories"" and undoubtedly his doodles will not make art loves swoon like they do over the Bulls in the Altamira caves in Spain. The film limits itself to following the escapades of grumpy father, cutie pie daughter and cocky wise Guy at the expanse of the rest of the family and creates only unpredictable nature as the adversary.

The Croods is full of slapstick comedy and has none of the dialogues and word play that will amuse the accompanying adults. It has no story and little character development, not to speak of a background score that could have lifted the film up, when it threatens to sag under the weight of its animation showiness. Small children will love its a gag a minute format but older children, I suspect, will see through its severe limitations. The film has a star cast of big names doing voiceovers but I found none of the distinctiveness of Nicholas Cage in the voice of Grug. The animators do a competent job and the 3D effects are half decent in some sequences which makes the film intermittently bearable.",1466467200,,3699,4.566265060240964

She meets a guy who helps them escape the whole ""earth-destruction"" thing that takes centuries but somehow happens in a matter of minutes. They all travel to safety while the dad is mad at the guy (because of course he is). They learn about each other as they discover the real world, and everyone feels good in the end.

5628123,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Even though I am a 58 years old woman I love this movie! It is a great family movie. There are so few movies now that you can watch that does not have cussing, sex, or violence in them. This is an action packed animated movie that also has romance in it. It is funny and suspenseful with a few surprises along the way. Nicolas Cage  , Ryan Reynolds, and Emma Stone did an excellent job as the voice of the characters. I admit I enjoy most animated movies more than movies with real people in them. If you took the cussing out of some of the movies, they would only be 15 minutes long.  I would recommend The Croods to anyone, any age, adult or child, who enjoys family movies.",1465516800,3,676,4.152671755725191

It has wonderful acting (voice) and the CGI/animation is well done (not the style I adore, but the quality of the work is very apparent).  I saw this movie in 3D when it first came out with my son (6 at the time) and it was the first time he sat through a whole movie.  Plot is clever and the animals are cute.  The ""chemistry"" of the cast is really good.  The HD version on Amazon streamed perfectly and the controls were fine, just not intuitive.  Once I knew where and what the control did it was good.  I personally watch movies with closed caption turned on, Not hard of hearing but like to keep up with clever scripts.",1465430400,,675,4.186046511627907

I would say the movie's strength is its mixture of comedy and heartwarming moments. I found the Croods to be a very relatable family, and the movie definitiely has that classic Dreamworks feeling. A very strong addition to the movie studio's catalog :)",1454371200,,407,4.368421052631579

5628910,5,B00BJ0RERM,I was pleasantly surprised by the colorful scenes that reminded me of Avatars scenery.

The first time we played this movie none of my family which includes my husband my son (3yrs) and daughter (2yrs) wanted to sit a watch a movie so I figured it was nothing great or worth watching. I WAS WRONG. It took a while for me to play it again but when I did it stayed in my DVD player for months playing over and over again.
The fact we now have someone to compare my incomparable daughter too ""release the baby"" isn't the only reason this movie was a hit with my family. This movie has done what few movies can do, it keeps my entire family quite calm and entertained through out. The Croods is a funny exciting and heartwarming adventure that displays an invaluable life lesson.",1448496000,,747,4.297872340425532

Some kids movies are just classics, animated but adult humor.  Like Shrek and Toy Story.  I'm a senior citizen, so most of my video library at home consists of romantic comedies, family humor, and warm-fuzzy holiday stories.  Hey! You don't have to be a kid to like funny movies :)  If you want to laugh and laugh, this family movie has comments that apply to real-life families..... but keep it light :)  If you know ANY kids then you have a great excuse to see this one!

Listen to the theme song, as many times as you can stand it. Then, as with the movie itself, let it go for a few months. Then listen to it again. Keep an open mind.

5629469,5,B00BJ0RERM,"There are a lot of family movies out there.  At least half of them use words we don't allow in our home (brat, hate, etc in reference to another).  I tend to assume anything Nicolas Cage is in will be pretty wholesome (can't be sure haven't watched all his stuff) but he seems to not be your typical hollywood star.

What we loved about this was that it was clean, wholesome, showed unity as a family (what a concept!), showed how you can work through issues as a family and had us laughing and quoting parts later too.

Bought it during Christmas one year, I never buy movies I hadn't watched first, but took the gamble as it was only 5 bucks then.  Well worth it!!!!  We now watch it so many times on Netflix just so we don't have to open the box and get the disc going :)  So yeah, for my kids and myself it's one we can watch several times and not be sick of.",1433808000,2,863,4.071005917159764

5629696,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Set in prehistoric times, this is a story about a queer family who ventures out to see the world as their family home is destroyed. I have never seen so much colour and beautiful animation in an animated movie before, and this movie is testament to how far technology has changed our lives.

Despite the odd setting and the oddball crew of characters, the themes played out in the movie are universal - the head of the family looking out for the rest of the family and restricting the activities of the daughter, because she's the youngest girl.

The discovery of fire in the movie also plays a huge role, though I wouldn't want to spoil the plot by giving it out too much. This is surely a movie for the family to watch - hilarious, entertaining and eye-opening!",1424563200,,763,4.482014388489208

It was a quick, easy story with plenty of moments that found me laughing, despite my reservations going into the movie. And it had plenty of feel good moments without being sappy or dumb. The only thing I didn't like about it is the design of the characters themselves. But the animation itself is top notch in terms of distance, color and textures.

It had good lines here and there and a few funny moments but that is all it had going for it. At times the movie tried too hard to get even a forced laugh out of you. The story got tiring about 30 minutes into it. And the movie became too predictable to give it any more stars.

5629788,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I've seen this before and I loved it, so I got it for Christmas as a family gift. This is a story about a cave girl named Eep, who lived with her family in a cave. They were the only ones left after their neighbors lives ended tragically. She is tired of being in the cave all the time and longs to explore. Her father Grug convinces them that everything outside of the cave is bad. One day when Eep sees a strange light and follows it, she finds there is someone else besides her family. A guy named, well Guy who changes everything when he says they have to go because the world is ending. Eeps family, dad Grug, mom Ugga, her grandmother, gran and younger siblings Thunk and fierce baby sister Sandy are forced to go on an adventure, when their world begins falling apart and Grug is lost, but near the end of their journey finds his way.  I love the message of the movie. You should never be afraid to live. Bad things happen, but you can't hide away in safety. That's wasting your life away.",1421193600,,996,4.242105263157895

Which is saying a lot as theres only 7. Its fairly boring. If they're starving most the time why are the two men in the family fat? And this is something my four year old noticed!

About the movie, this is a great movie with lots of action and funny situations but also with a great message about family and what is important in life. I just can say that as you know, toddlers do not have a long attention span, nevertheless ours made through pretty much all the movie and was hypnotized whenever the big carnivore prehistoric cats made any apparition in the movie.

Regarding the quality of the image/animation... it is excellent!!! We bought the DVD and I only wonder how better could the Blue Ray be, I mean the DVD quality is superb in this movie... maybe we should upgrade to a Blue Ray just to see if there's any difference. We do not have the latest TV set model and anyways the image quality is EXCELLENT!

5629963,5,B00BJ0RERM,"This movie is so much fun. It has a lot of jokes that adults will get, and the characters are perfect. I love the colorful animation.

There's a lot of scary/sad themes which young kids might not ""get""- I watched with my 1 and 3 yr old and they weren't bothered, but the family locks themselves in a cave to stay safe for days at a time, they get one egg for food and there's not enough left for dad and he says ""it's okay, I ate last week"", and the family is really fighting for their survival throughout. I think they did a good job portraying realities that cavemen may have had (although these were some pretty high tech cave men and I'm assuming some very made up creatures) while not being terribly frightening.

I loved how they brought in modern culture, but also gave explanations of how ideas were thought up. It was inflated and most of ideas were way before their time, but it's still beat. Reminded me a lot of Clan of the Cave Bear series.",1415577600,,953,4.288888888888889

It was OK, but I wouldn't buy it as a gift or even re-rent it if I was renting it from RedBox or the local library. It had funny moments, was in no way plausible (of course), and had a lot of jokes that adults would get but kids wouldn't, but even that doesn't save it.

5630111,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Very enjoyable, with good lessons for kids, laced with the current rebellious sensibilities of kids as they may relate, suggesting it's an age-old phenomenon. Voice performances from Nicholas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Catherine Keener, Cloris Leachman and all provide a narrative of strength, intelligence and survival.

Great animation, good story and endearing characters. Dialogue is especially sweet, especially from Cage's befuddled father. He's wonderful.

5630129,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I'm 22 and I love cartoons. My boyfriend on the other hand, is not-so-fond of Disney, Pixar, Nickelodeon, and all of the other magnificent artsy movie creators out there. Needless to say I begged and begged to watch ""The Croods"" because my foster kiddos had seen it with their birth mom and quoted it CONSTANTLY. I wanted to know what all of the hype was about! And on our weekly movie-night date-night, I finally persuaded him to sit down and watch this movie.

By the end, he was swallowing his own words, and definitely agreed that The Croods was one of the more hysterical movies we'd watched in quite some time. This fantastic animated movie is about a caveman family- essentially the last of their kind. The father is stuck in his 'old ways' and refuses to move on and evolve. His eldest daughter, on the other hand, strives to learn knew things. In walks a stranger boy, who not-purposely introduces the eldest daughter to ""fire"" and after that, everything changes. The family ends up going on a magnificent journey where they discover evolution, and even more than that- discover themselves!

This movie is sweet, quirky, funny, and strewn with humor that anyone could appreciate. It has both adult and child comedy that people of all ages will enjoy. Everyone from toddlers to teens to parents will find themselves laughing out loud at some point during this fun film. All of the humor is clean, in fact the entire movie is so darn family friendly! I was so happy to find a film that just had a genuinely upbeat message to it, that wasn't too dramatic, too over-done, or too adult-oriented. The Croods was a child-appropriate film that spans it's targeted audience to fit into the hearts of people of all ages- and genders too!

This movie had me smiling the entire way through, and occasionally laughing out loud. The message is a cute one, of a family learning how much they mean to each other, and how not all changes are bad changes. It's a very beautiful film that will capture the imaginations of children and the hearts of adults. I LOVE children's movies- especially ones that are sweet and innocent. This is definitely one of those movies, and I would highly recommend it to everyone- families, children, and adults alike!",1409011200,2,2240,4.709183673469388

5630207,4,B00BJ0RERM,"I actually am a fully grown adult who loves watching movies like The Croods, How to Train Your Dragon, UP, and so much more...
For some reason movies like these just seems better than most ""adult"" movies these days.

Despite of it's lack of educational value, there were decent moral values about fatherhood in this movie.
This is especially a good movie for dads with daughters.

The monsters are all fantasy monsters that kids like to come up with or imagine. Personally, I love a good imagination. However, if anyone is looking for an dinosuar/caveman movie that is educational this is not it.

I absolutely loved Sandy's character. It was a comical over-exaggeration of an young curious child with imagination. Most kids love acting out their imagination.

Guy and Eep was a well done story about ""young love"". So, I can't complain much about it.

Grug, was the hardworking overprotective dad who in the end of the movie realized there was more to life than all hard work and no play. I really liked the concept for a type of fatherhood experience. (of course there's different fatherhood techniques, experiences, and moral values) I felt it reminded me of my dad a lot actually.  (He is a hardworking man, who will do anything to protect his family)

I do appreciate the humor being towards the whole family, rather than just kids. I love slapstick comedy, a little bit of the humor (between Grug and Gran) and this was it for me.

I do however do not give it all five stars because Thunk is just there so that they could have a son. His character missed any important role in the movie. (he may have been for comical value, but it was more of a miss)

Also last and not least, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE CROCOPUP!",1406678400,,1714,4.593442622950819

But I rate this movie 1 star, not for lack of entertainment, but for pushing a philosophy, if adopted, would, I believe, harm the emotional development of children.

My wife and children had watched the movie several times, raving about how funny it is. But I noticed something, my children were becoming more disobedient, and a loss of peace.

So I watched the movie with them. After watching this movie with my children, and felt I needed to review this movie for mores and philosophy. The movie is beautifully crafted, the animation top notch. But the mores it promulgates are most disturbing.

First off, the movie has no plot. It is a movie showcasing a distorted argument about how rules are bad, and how abandoning the rules and fleeing the world we grew up in will somehow lead to happiness.

Second the movie has no climax other than a bizarrely manufactured one. The movie is a progression of demonstrating how the father is wrong, and the unknown bringer of fire is right, with the real climax (not the destruction of the old continent) being the full demonstration of the validity of the premises of the unknown fire-bringer. At this thought, should we be teaching our children (even indirectly by sanctioning a movie that teaches it) that the strangers we warn our children about our actually not only safe but 'right?'

The movies sole purpose seems to be the justify the writer in personal choices that are contrary to traditional societal mores.  ""My father was wrong!"" screams across every frame of the film. I don't mean the literal writer, but the figurative, collective writer that informs large scale films as a reflection of the cultural and conceptually winds that blow through society. The idea that new technology somehow sends to oblivion (or obliviates) the need for rules, and that somehow if we just approach something extremely dangerous in the right way, the danger will fade away, may be the most dangerous ideas to introduce to young children.

I actually sympathize with the obvious villain, the father, who should be the hero. He creates rules to protect his family. In a world where even a small mistake will leave you dead, strict adherence to strict rules is the only sure protection. We have traffic rules, and safety rules, even home rules. We teach our children to look both ways before crossing the street, to wash and clean up before eating. Each of these is a rule meant to protect and make children happy. Not following these rules could lead to them being hurt or becoming sick.

Every good parents want the best for their children, for them to be happy and healthy, and be prepared for the challenges which will come in their lives. With that, we threw out the movie, and talked about what our family values are. With that, obedience came back, and peace returned in greater measure.",1405641600,19,2962,4.81496062992126

5630257,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Great family movie!  Our kids (ages 3 and 6) both love it, as do my husband and I.  There are deeper, more meaningful themes for the older kids and adults, but plenty of simple comedy for younger kids.

5630272,4,B00BJ0RERM,I love cartoons.  This one kind of investigates the cusp of evolution between Neanderthals and Sapiens or perhaps how that may have all come about? Maybe that is too weighty a topic.  Safe to say a strange human runs into the family of Croods and has some new ideas plus he knows that volcanoes are on their way.

5630297,4,B00BJ0RERM,"First I watched BBC's thought-provoking ""Walking With Cavemen"" series, then, resonating with thoughts about deep time and the sacred march of evolution, I watched ""The Croods"" that same night. The message of both: ""Only the adaptable survive."" I laughed out loud at ""The Croods"" primitive slapstick--where would it be more appropriate? and strangely, the story acquired a sort of mythic power when the family reached a ravine separating them from the Promised Land of the future, and Dad, a neolithic Moses, was forced to hurl his loved ones across the divide but remain to die in his collapsing world. The movie should have ended with his retreating to paint images of his family on the walls of his cave  that's when my eyes welled up ... but alas, the writers find a silly way to rescue Dad and his pet tiger, undercutting a potentially powerful ending with Jack-of-Hearts sentimentality. Remember when Bambi received the news he'd never see his mother again? When Travis had to shoot Old Yeller? Endings like that aren't allowed anymore, not in America. Still I appreciated the film's sly, optimistic commentary on the Old giving way to the New and its compassionate view of human evolution.",1404691200,,1195,4.975

 I really liked it.  It was funny, very well done, great dialog, beautiful and very creative animals and scenery.  Just like the case says it is an ""animated Avatar"" (which most of that movie is).  The animals and flora were so colorful, mixed up designs and imaginative.

I think the whole family would love this movie and the only caveat I would mention is that the family is pretty rough with each other, especially at first.

5630391,5,B00BJ0RERM,"From the ads, I labelled this film ""Avoid At All Cost"", and threw it into the mental dustbin full of recent way overdone, special-effect heavy, super expensive animated films that are not even worth a first look. But I was with some kids who were watching it, so to humor them, I did also. Five minutes in, I was hooked. One of the co-writers is John Cleese from Monty Python, and another did Lilo and Stitch, which was well-written, despite being overdone in the final wrap (notice how much better the cartoon series was when it didn't have the heavy dramatic element hanging over it). I don't know how that makes a difference, but somehow this film came out incredibly witty, well acted, well played, not overstated, not overdone. Some of the animation also was truly amazing for a CGI film. Especially the eyes. Here's a family film that is rated C for Creative.

The next day I was able to view Mr. Peabody and Sherman on a large screen with the same kids (on a military base)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Peabody-Sherman/dp/B00JEK76QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Peabody & Sherman</a>. I really was scared for this one because I love the original segment of the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon (despite the fact that some of the last episodes weren't really very well written)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-Bullwinkle-Friends-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00465I1BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends:  The Complete Series</a>. Once I got used to Peabody being a CGI dog, and there being a sort of backstory to his adopting Sherman (which the cartoons never explored), and even though I'd have liked something simpler and more cel-looking, it started being a pretty good film in spite of these objections, and by the end, was nearly a great one.

I'm not completely sure who the audience is for this film, but it's got something for everyone. Stay and watch the end credits (which is always a good idea), and you'll see a couple tips of the hat to the original cartoon series. I also learned that the original idea came from Ted Key, who wrote kids' books and the Disney movies Escape to Witch Mountain, Gus, and The Cat From Outer Space. I only hope some of the best characters, like Garfield the cat, Yogi Bear, Felix the cat, Snoopy and Peanuts, get such brilliant star treatment next time they hit the big screen.",1401321600,4,2437,5.243589743589744

5630403,5,B00BJ0RERM,The Croods was an unexpected delight. The portrayal of the two teenagers had me in stitches because they sooo resembled my kids at that age. The message was positive and the humor was not at someone else's expense.,1401235200,,214,4.657894736842105

5630427,4,B00BJ0RERM,"I saw the previews and read the reviews, and figured that ""The Croods"" would be a cute, kid-oriented movie with some nice visuals. Which it was--but it was also remarkably charming, funny, and touching. I love stories where Dad is the hero anyway, and this one made me happy. Thunk, the good-natured, always-willing middle child also won a place in my heart. On walking over sharp coral and shells with bare feet: ""Ow! Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly, but..."" Perfect.",1400457600,,474,4.864197530864198
5630428,4,B00BJ0RERM,"The film, ""The Croods,"" is based on the general assumption that humans evolved from sub-human creatures. This is the humorous story of their ascent. While I don't accept this Darwinian explanation of man, the film is worth seeing for several reasons.

First, the computer animation is stunning (at least to me). The characters' expressions and gestures, the landscapes, and the animals (all hybrids of known animals) are so far from the animation that I saw as a child that it seems to come from another civilization. (Maybe it does.)

Second, while the films assumes a naturalist view of the world, it undermines itself wonderfully. The Crood family begin as fear-based pre-humans (or semi-humans) whose only goal is not to die. But their teenage daughter wants more. She wants to live and be curious. By meeting a more evolved character, the Croods begin to think about ""tomorrow"" and end up ""following the light.""

It is all delightfully done, mind you--the hyper-slapstick and constant verbal and physical humor can be nearly hysterical. But it does not fit Darwinism, which allows for no transcendence of the material world. The Croods, you, see begin to act beyond instinct and conditioning. They dream; they explore; they hope. They are not merely evolved animals.

Thus, the human essence, made in God's image and likeness, shines through even this supposedly Darwinian tale, which makes it even better. This also chimes in with a New York Times article which recently related that an atheist group was holding ""services"" and wanted more of a sense of ""transcendence.""",1400371200,,1576,5.096899224806202

I thought the funniest part was when the Croods tried to escape from the fire in dry grass and it got worse. After I was done with it, I decided that it was my second favorite animated movie of all time (after How to Train Your Dragon).

The tale is new and fresh. Yes, there's a bit of romance between the two main characters, but it's less obvious than most Disney movies. This is a tale about survival and family relationships. Lots of cute quirks thrown in - my nephew's is definitely the little sloth saying ""Dun dun duuuuuun!!!"". I am 26 years old, and I love this movie.",1400112000,,510,4.322916666666667

The plot is thin, and as the movie goes along there are a few excessively sentimental scenes which took the movie down a notch or two in my opinion.

The baby had a mad spaz dog personality.  The daughter discovered a boy who resembled aladdin. I got up several times and started baking in the kitchen.  I could not wait for this to be over.

Visually, it was beautiful. The dialogue was surprisingly witty and often hysterical. The story was an almost epic quest to escape the end of the world.

5630535,1,B00BJ0RERM,"Usually this kind of film works for adults but this one is awful.  The pandering writing is nauseating and the whole thing is a train wreck of sickening mommy, daddy, baby family cliches that would, if it weren't for some ""crood-ish"" jokes, be Barney the Dinosaur level.  Either way, the writing is embarrassing (people, presumably adults actually got PAID for this, and worse, others gave it the green light?), the plot moves slower and more painfully than a pound of cheese though the digestive track, and there are barely any laughs.  Unless you're trying to visually opiate a 3 year old, pass on this mess.  I'm only giving this one star because the animation is excellent.",1397088000,2,677,4.810344827586207

5630539,5,B00BJ0RERM,"THE CROODS

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this film. I knew I would like this based on the trailer but I ended up really loving this animated flick. The story is fun and so is the cast of characters they have here. I watched this with my little cuz like I normally do with these animated features and we both loved it. I even liked the song at the end.

The Croods are a family of cavemen living in a cave fearing everything that is new to them. If it is new or exciting then they are staying away from it. That is all of them except oldest daughter of the bunch Eep [Emma Stone], which of course drives her father Grug [Nicolas Cage] crazy. That is all about to change as a chance encounter with a boy named Guy [Ryan Reynolds] that Eep has forces the family to move. They go on a wild adventure looking to escape the end of the world. With Guy as their guide at the reluctance of Grug they just might make it.

I found The Croods to be much better than I thought it would be. The animation is great as are the characters and the story. The voice acting is great as well with Cage cracking me up constantly; dude was made to voice this character. The DVD looks good and the bonus features are cool, plus like I said before the credits song is catchy. Still cant believe I like that song this much, just worked with the theme of the film I guess.",1396742400,5,1382,4.073529411764706

5630586,2,B00BJ0RERM,"I don't think this thing even had a storyline... which is not the worst thing in a kids' movie. Honestly, kids like stuff for very different reasons than adults do, so maybe they'll be caught up in all the pretty colors and scary dinosaurs... but I don't see it.

The only thing I took away from this movie was this: this might be the one time that the loony creationist crowd has a legitimate reason to whine. Aside from laying the groundwork for an evolution argument - with the movie clearly on the side of science and sense - there's just nothing to this movie. Might have made a fun cartoon series, but it just bored me silly.

The beginning didn't necessarily grab me right away, but it quickly became a fun ride. It is chock full of humor and emotion, and the animation is phenomenal. A reviewer called it the ""Avatar"" of animated movies, and they got it right. Emma Stone, I must say, is perfectly suited for voicing animated characters, and I wish she'd do more. I hope there is a sequel in the works, because I would love to follow these characters as their story develops.",1395100800,,661,4.296

I have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised by how much I loved it.  It's actually quite funny and not a little cute, also sweet in an odd sort of way.  The reimagining of the prehistoric creatures is truly inventive (my favorite character is Belt).  I thought the original title was better: Crood Awakening.  I can easily see myself watching this movie many times.  It's no masterpiece but it is fun.  Loved the music too, had to buy the soundtrack.",1394582400,,581,4.58252427184466

I just watched this VIA Netflix, so I came here to add it to my cart.  Worth the buy I think.  Unlike this one reviewer that gave it one star I read I have to thoroughly disagree with their review.  The animation was amazing, the writing was great.  There were time I was laughing so hard I was crying and other moments that just touched my heart so deeply it hurt.  The landscapes were amazingly done, esp the lush areas presented.  The wild life was fantastical and charming.  Each and every character was fabulous and very well fleshed out.  The voice overs were great and some very recognizable like Nick Cage, Ryan Reynolds and Cloris Leachman!  I gave this a very much deserved 5 stars and doesn't matter your age, from 9 to 90 will enjoy this.  Sort of like UP... you think your going to be unimpressed but when it ends you feel like you've watched one of the best in a long time... Go for it....",1393718400,,907,4.313609467455621

Not that the quality of the animation was bad, but the story is essentially non-extistant. And those silly pre-historic creatures. Why in the world did they have to introduce these obnoxious fantasy animals? Would the 'story' not have worked with more realistic renditions of animals that likely lived in this time period? Do we really want to show our kids this nonsense? I cannot fathom why anybody would rate this movie 5 stars.",1393632000,6,531,4.782608695652174

But with the new twist of being in the cave man era.  The characters were well developed and I personally identified with the angst and frustration of a teenage daughter who just want to be herself but doesn't always see the danger or want the help and it is so hard to let them fall on their own at times.  Guy is just hysterical, I loved his character and think this captured the cave man VS todays issues rather well.

5630695,4,B00BJ0RERM,"We saw this movie is theaters and my family loved it. It is one of my son's favorites and I can actually enjoy watching. If you like Ice Age, you'll probably enjoy this movie as well.",1393286400,,183,4.111111111111111
5630696,4,B00BJ0RERM,"One of my recent regrets is not having watched The Croods in the theater; how awesome must it have looked on the giant screen, with its colors that pop and resplendent vistas detailed with such exquisite photorealism they could've been lifted straight off Avatar. And should you never mind the stunning eye candy, maybe the riotous family dynamics will engage you.

I guess it's always been so that teenage girls assume their dads simply can't cope with the advances of an ever-changing world. Take brutish prehistoric patriarch Grug Crood (Nicolas Cage) who at ad nauseam preaches to his family that one should ""never not be afraid."" This maxim may go down solid with his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), his son Thunk (Clark Duke), his granny Gran (Cloris Leachman), and that savage, savage baby - but his restless daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants none of his cautious approach. Like Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Eep pines for adventure, longs to explore what's that over yonder.

While out on an unpermitted excursion from the Croods' cave, Eep runs into a strange (re: more evolved) guy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds), him what's prophesying the end of the world and wearing his pet monkey, whose name is Belt, for a belt (Guy explains: ""...cook, conversationalist, navigator... also, keeps my pants up"").

Truth is, Pangea is breaking apart, and when the latest bit of cataclysm collapses the family cave, there's nothing for it but for the Croods to embark on a desperate cross-country trek to safe haven. Grug the patriarch is pretty freaked out about this.

DreamWorks hasn't yet built up the cachet to match that of Pixar's, but it's not for lack of trying. DreamWorks' How to Train Your Dragon, for my money, stands up to the best in Pixar's body of work. The Croods fall just a notch below that. Saying that isn't a knock on The Croods as much as it is a testament to the superior quality of How to Train Your Dragon and the Pixar classics. It's old hat today to marvel at how flawless the CG animation looks for whatever animated film. With the tech now available, any big time studio can pull off the impeccable visuals. Still, props for the realization of such a vibrant topography. It's a harsh and hostile world the Croods (and Guy) must traipse thru, but oh so pretty to look at.

The humor is plentiful and is the good kind, meaning that both young and old can savor the funny. I like that there are seemingly throwaway gags that come back later on to fill a role. So sue me, the 6-year-old in me busted a gut when the punch monkeys showed up. Admittedly, the pet monkey's catch phrase got old after a while (especially when the dang kids kept repeating it for many days later). Also present and sort of cute are them obligatory comic references to the modern day zeitgeist and how the Croods' behavior and interpersonal conflicts reflect contemporary values. I do like the Croods' version of the camera.

At the core of the movie - what gives it its beating heart - is a tender father-daughter story. We note Grug's discomfort as he feels his leadership slowly slip away as Guy's more progressive methods and ideas begin to latch on to the group. We see his position as Eep's dad threatened as the attraction between Eep and Guy grows. Wow, The Croods is like Father of the Bride. I can totally see Grug losing it in the supermarket and trying to match the hot dogs with the hot dog buns. Wait, can Grug count? Anyway, the back end of the movie reveals a pretty sobering turn of events, and this makes Grug's emotional arc resonate that much more. The Croods is delightful, full of pranks and awesome visuals and even a message that's profound in its simplicity. In protest to what her dad's been preaching, Eep retorts: ""There's a difference between living and not dying."" That's deep, Eep.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- ""Belt's Cave Journal"" (00:06:16 minutes)
- ""Croods' Cuts: Lost Scenes"" - 4 deleted scenes with introductions by co-writers & co-directors Chris Sanders and Kirk DeMicco (totaling 00:08:26 minutes)

The family has it's hard times but they all learn to respect each other's strengths and weaknesses.

After watching countless movies growing up I have seen great, bad, and okay movies. Thats to be expected, I am not going to love every movie I go to see. The movie I want to talk about, on the other hand, I absolutely love. The Croods captured my heart the first time I saw it, and yes I have seen it many times since then.  I know this is a movie geared towards the younger kids, and I am a freshman in college, but I can proudly say that this movie is all around delightful.
This animated film is about a cave family. With big names such as, Emma Stone, Nicolas Cage, and Ryan Reynolds doing voice overs. This family has lived in a cave their whole lives, occasionally going out to search for food. With two teenagers, a baby, the mom, dad, and the grandma all living together life can be challenging. Eep, the daughter just wants to be able to go out and explore and see what else there is in life besides the walls of the cave. Grug, the dad thinks he knows what is best and is protective. One night Eep sneaks out and meets a boy, named Guy, who will change the familys lives.  The next morning the familys cave is destroyed by an earthquake the family must make a decision as what to do next. The journey they must take gets the family to see and do things they never thought they would. The tension between father and daughter makes for a funny, heartwarming, and sometimes tear-jerking adventure.
I said that this movie was geared for little kids but after seeing it I realized that if you are old enough you can take a deeper meaning from the film. The production behind this film is amazing. Animated films can be hard to capture a wide variety of audiences. The Croods have a different story. The imagination and creativity in this movie is perfect. At one point they need some shoes so they end up putting fish on their feet. It is the little things like that that make it a joy to watch. When you are watching the movie it is like you are going along with the family on their adventure. The characters are funny. Since they are cave people venturing out for the first time everything is new to them. So when they have an encounter with fire it is entertaining to watch. The mom calls the sparks baby suns, and they believe that it can be put out by running into tall grass. Most people know that doing that would only make the fire spread but thats what makes it humorous and enjoyable. Of course people can just tell you that the movie is really great and it could turn out to be horrific but The Croods definitely did not disappoint.
The little kids can go see it and love it because there are funny looking cave people, goofy made up animals, and the animation is so bright and lively. There is an oversized colorful tiger with huge fangs and little elephant mice creatures that are just plain cute.  Older people can also love it for the same reasons but they can also take away how important family is and how it is okay to be afraid of living but sometimes you need to just let go and take risks. That you only get one chance in life and sometimes it is perfectly acceptable to change your ways and actually start living. That is what makes this movie so great.
 This movie is not your typical animated film with a crazy villain character, or a princess who needs to be saved. It is about a family, and together they take on the villain of fear.",1392422400,,3379,4.306603773584905

It's a goofy and heart warming film that's not only tolerable, but I actually enjoyed it and might even watch again.  I think the most poignant story arc is the family dynamic, watching the father character (voiced by Nick Cage) try to keep his family safe while abandoning everything that used to be known/safe and heading out into the unknown... into darkness and danger.

While I would not pay full price for this movie (there aren't all that many that I would), if you can find this on special and you want to mix it up a bit you may be in for a surprise as well!",1391990400,,983,4.1798941798941796

5630786,4,B00BJ0RERM,"Nicolas Cage's dad character was truly refreshing to see, surprisingly, since the trailers all made his character seem too cartoonish. He stole the show as a fresh twist to the stereotyped father figure. He was written consistently throughout the movie and was true to the storyline. He is Homer to the Simpsons. He pulled the characters along even when it seemed he was to be left out of their circle and was the one to truly bring humanity to the cavemen.",1391904000,,457,4.654320987654321

5630816,2,B00BJ0RERM,"So, I watched this movie yesterday, and I really didn't enjoy it. First let me tell you about the characters:
Eep is the main character, she is a teenage cavegirl wearing very little clothing, which I will talk about later.
Thunk is Eep's little brother, I think he was just put there so she could have a brother, he is not important and quite stupid.
Sandy is the baby sister, and frankly, she scared me. She tended to act like a rabid dog the entire movie.
Ugga is the mother, she looks exactly like Eep. She doesn't do much in the story.
Gran is Ugga's mother, she is an 80-year-old (cavemen didn't live till 80) who runs really fast and hates her son in law.
Grug is the weird, super-strong, pessimistic dad who never wants to try anything new. The movie centers on his pessimism. Most of the things he does are to try and kill Gran because he hates her. (really???)
Guy is the ""new guy"". He actually looks slightly human. He's got brains, not strength. He thinks up many ideas, such as using a sloth as a belt(great idea!). The best character in the entire movie was the sloth, named...wait for it...Belt. Eep has a crush on Guy.
The movie starts out with this great animation thing where Eep tells us about her family. That is the reason I gave the movie 1 more star.
Anyway, that night, Eep sees a light, she goes out of the cave, she finds a guy named...Guy. He tells her about the end of the world (we don't know why the world is ending) and how they have to travel to a mountain to escape, and then the Croods run away as a giant rock destroys their cave. They realize that just behind their cave was a huge wilderness with a bunch of mutant animals living in it. They apparently didn't know about this their whole lives. So they start walking to the mountain, big journey, blah, blah, blah.
So what did I not like? A lot. First of all, we never get WHY the world is falling apart. WHY does Grug hate Gran so much, and vice versa? We never get why anything. Ever.
Next, I was really annoyed by Grug the entire movie. He was just this stupid pessimistic over-protective guy who never wanted to try new things. Also, he was constantly trying to kill Gran. Whenever he called attendance, he seemed angry that Gran was still there. Also, at one point, Gran says that if Grug ever had an idea, she would have a heart attack. Grug turns into a cave-hippie overnight and spouts of dumb ideas in a hippie voice. Gran repeatedly hits Grug over the head with her cane and then laughs when he says it hurts.
Also, the setting is weird. First they end up in a jungle with a bunch of giant mutants. Next, they go into a maze made out of rocks. Then more forests, more rocks, etc., to get to this mountain that has a hole in the middle. And then there is this weird place and it LOOKS like they are walking on clouds but I am not really sure. And here comes the spoiler. I don't know how to do that open and close spoiler thing, so I will just write it here. Skip to the next paragraph if you actually want to watch the movie (don't) and don't want it ruined for you. {Then, the mountain cracks open, and apparently n the other side there is ""tomorrow"", in Guy's words, so Grug becomes Mr. Perfect Dad, sacrifices himself and throws them all to the other side. He comes back though :(. Then they get to a wonderful beach, all the animals that tried to kill them become friends with them, and they ride them down the beach into the sunset. The end.}
My fourth and last rant is going to be about Eep, the main character. Eep is wearing a strapless tiger-skin dress which looks like it's about to fall off. The dress is also extremely short, and we get a couple views of her backside. Also, she has a crush on Guy, and they try to do some weird things together (which continually fail). It seemed awkward and kind of inappropriate for little kids, even though this is supposed to be a PG movie. I would definitely not recommend anyone watching this, it is dumb and makes no sense.",1391385600,3,3973,4.298666666666667

As far as the movie goes it's entertaining with some parts being very funny, to the point of laugh out loud funny, and also some good quality writing, especially with family dynamics.  It's a movie I would definitely own, especially 3D if that's what you're into.  For me, I really enjoy the 4 different media choices with the Bluray 3D, Bluray 2D, DVD and digital copy.  It allows you to watch it however and whenever you want.  I like them the most when the price is decent. Right now it's still a little pricey, but if you find it on sale or wait for the price to drop or some promotion it becomes an outstanding value.",1391212800,,671,4.379032258064516

When I saw this movie I found myself laughing so hard and also feeling a heartfelt connection towards the meaning of family and that 's what The Croods is all about. We are all different and sometimes we tend to find ourselves pulling away for the people that nurtured us. Yet, when we find our selves backed into a corner it is those very people that will step beside you and give their all to help you. It is a fun movie with a great voice cast including Nicholas Cage, Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds. Still, the highlight of the film is the bright colors and beautiful CGI landscape and the sheer scope of an imaginative beginning of time. The Croods will definitely stand the test of time in my book.",1390521600,,957,4.229508196721311

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: The Croods is a surreal, heart-warming and an intelligent animated adventure-comedy and is just a typical caveman day out, especially showing us the eponymous family of Neanderthals that is forced to leave the relative safety of their cave. This animation cartoon via DreamWorks, is the definition of a sometimes hit-or-miss animation studio. 'Rise of the Guardians' was superb in both substance and style, especially likes of 'Puss in Boots' 3D [that I thought was totally awesome], whereas 'Madagascar 3' and their most recent dreadful animation 'Turbo' have all been definitely thumbs down, big time! At some point all the CGI children's animation films that come out nowadays, sort of blend together. But the occasional release stands out, and it is usually a PIXAR production, but even that's an iffy prospect these days, but mostly it feels like a whole lot of sameness. Most of them are colourful, have simple plots, and have a few funny moments.

Anyway, we're in prehistoric times and the Croods are a loveable family of Neanderthals trying to do what every Neanderthal is trying to do, not get killed. It's a dangerous world out there, so the Croods tend to stay inside their cave cowering in fear. As Grug Crood [Nicolas Cage], papa caveman of this clan, always says, ""Never not be afraid."" The Croods family is taught that curiosity is just about the most dangerous thing a caveman can have, so of course their daughter Eep [Emma Stone] is naturally curious. A good old strained father-daughter relationship is brewing here. But, the movie wouldn't be complete without a few comedic generic characters like the sassy grandmother [Cloris Leachman], the doltish son [Clark Duke], the congenial mother (Catherine Keener), the wacky baby, and the loveable stranger [Ryan Reynolds]. Now that they've got the formula down it's time to run the characters through the predictable paces, picking up a few zany animal friends along the way.

So, now you know what you're in for. As far as a children's animation film goes, there's much worse out there than 'The Croods.' At least the animation is absolutely stunningly and at the same time brilliant to look at. No matter that none of the animals featured appear to have come from this planet since not one of them appears to fit into the evolutionary chain at all. Giant flying turtles, land whales with stubby legs walking around in the desert, and leafy elephants just to name a few of the stranger creations in this film.

At some point you just have to say, ""Hey, if it makes Junior happy, I'm in."" As far as competing with the strongest entries in the DreamWorks catalogue, 'The Croods' is great. The hardnosed father is taught a lesson by his spunky young daughter in acceptance and living life to the fullest. In turn, she discovers that maybe her dad really does care about her and all that paranoid parenting actually meant something.

That said, there's some really fun animation in this film. It's as if they said, screw the geological record, we're making our own evolutionary creations. Because of the inventiveness of the world of 'The Croods' and the creativity applied in the animation, the animation film rises above the other formulaic children's films. Not by much, but enough that it stands out among the rest.

The comedy only gets more inspired and idiosyncratic. While most new cartoons feel as if they've been assembled by committee, the only credited writers and directors here are Chris Sanders and Kirk De Micco, plus, intriguingly, John Cleese, who worked on early drafts of the screenplay and their humour, shines through. They even get laughs from mother-in-law jokes and a banana-skin pratfall, despite those chestnuts being Stone Age. It is also on par with the other brilliant Oscar winning PIXAR/Disney animation cartoon Brave that is also a stunning 3D Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Video Quality  `The Croods' looks absolutely stunning in 3D and there's nearly no difference in brightness or definition between this version and the stand alone 2D image (also included in this set). Colours are just as bold, details are just as fine. The image never appears any darker in 3D, which is a big plus, particularly in the film's more naturally darker scenes. Details still look incredible, right down to the finest terrain textures, whether gritty earthen elements or lush natural vegetation. The 3D effects are brilliant. General depth impresses me greatly. The transfer shows off the sprawling landscapes really good, again both the rocky lands to start and the more colourful vegetation areas later. Shots down on the ground are particularly impressive in terms of realistic spacing and depth. A few odds and ends do stand out; animal beaks and noses sometimes seem to extended beyond the front of the screen, while dust particles and other floating objects on the air seems to drift far back into and well out of the screen. Very little of the dreaded ""crosstalk"" effect was visible throughout the animation film. Overall, this is a brilliant 3D transfer.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  This 3D animation film is provided with a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix, 'The Croods' matches the exceptionality of its video presentation with its audio. This is an immersive, entertaining audio mix that sucks you in and never lets you go. There are plenty of examples where the movie's sound design makes great use of the seven channels. The opening chase scene where the Croods attempt to procure breakfast by stealing an egg and uses every channel in its arsenal. The action zooms from one speaker to another. The sound travels flawlessly back and forth through the sound field. There are other moments, like when the earth starts cracking up, where the surround takes hold, providing deep, rumbling bass. Explosions of lava and smoke erupt from the earth's surface, causing the sub-woofer to roar. The rear channels are equally impressive. The soundscape of 'The Croods' prehistoric world is a lively one. Once they enter the jungle the rear channels are alive with all sorts of far off jungle noises. This is an extremely interactive audio presentation and it is definitely one that the whole family will enjoy.

Finally, `The Croods' offers a hugely satisfying animated film experience, particularly beyond the fairy-tale and predictable superficial dynamics. Under the surface is warm, welcoming story, a fun, honest, heartfelt tale of discovery, of satisfaction, of accepting new things, of understanding the greater world. It's a very sweet and touching experience amidst all of the humour, most of which hits and none of which falls completely flat. To be sure, there's not much room to reinvent the wheel, in this case, being the modern Family animated film, but there's something to be said for sprucing it up and getting the most out of its capabilities, which `The Croods' does very well. The DreamWorks Animation Blu-ray 3D release of `The Croods' delivers an awesome 2D picture as well. The 3D transfer and the amazing sound are a brilliant factor to purchase this 3D extravaganza. A very nice array of extras are included, and the animation is sure to leave audiences of all ages extremely satisfied and all in all I was so happy to get this brilliant 3D package and has gone pride of place in my Blu-ray 3D Collection. Highly Recommended!

5630941,4,B00BJ0RERM,"Firstly, I concur with the other reviewers that the movie was delightfully funny & visually stunning. That being said, having watched the opening monologue relaying the history of the ""Caveman' family, I was immediately thrown off guard at the weirdness of the animals
encountered, having anticipated 'Ice Age' beasts & instead presented with creatures that totally negate Darwin. What with furred Crocodogs , flying pink Piranhas, giant Elephants with giraffe markings and huge headed Macaw-colored Tigers, it was like Cro-Magnon fell down Alice's rabbit hole. I finally concluded that these were cave-people on another planet. Sure, it's an animated cartoon
and all, but even with the suspension of disbelief, there should be some bit of rationality within the world created.",1390348800,,777,5.483333333333333

5630995,3,B00BJ0RERM,The characters were diverse and gave an opportunity to showcase a lead female in a tough as nails role.  The made up creatures and blending of ages allowed the story to progress but leads to misrepresenting how life progressed for early man. Nicholas Cage must have needed another house payment or at least one to the IRS as his character lacked any real passion or believability.

5631116,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I could gush profusely about the qualities and entertainment value of this movie, but instead I'll just point a few crowds to this film. It's worth owning in most people's DVD or digital collections.

Crowd #1: Teenage Girls--Do you ever feel oppressed by your parents? Do you ever roll your eyes at the seemingly illogical demands they put on you? Do you ever wonder why parents ""helicopter"" around your personal life? You will relate to Eep, and you may find answers about your weird family.

Crowd #2: Boys--There is enough action and comedy in this movie to keep you laughing and on the edge of your seat. And when you start dating, you'll begin to understand why parents/fathers act the way they do. A parent's love can be overly protective. Honor it.

Crowd #3: Fathers--There may be times you wonder if what you say is making a difference in your child's or family's life. This movie reminds us that what we say and what we do matters hugely. I believe you will find a kinship with Grug; many of us will share the heart and frustrations of his.

Many other crowds may find a connection to The Croods. There's only one way to find out. Watch it!",1389139200,,1151,4.545893719806763

5631118,5,B00BJ0RERM,"We rented this movie because we thought it would be funny but were very surprised when it was much more than that.  There was a truly touching father-daughter story that shines through.  A father struggling to protect a daughter that is growing up and wanting to leave the nest...or cave, as is the literal case here.  Really a great movie with the bonus of it being quite amusing.",1389139200,,381,4.573529411764706

5631140,3,B00BJ0RERM,"CASTING: Everyone in the cast was great and felt ""right""...except for Nic Cage. Don't get me wrong ~ I like Nic's slick savvy and I loved him in Gone in 60 Seconds and the National Treasure movies....His style just didn't work in the character of a paranoid caveman... and for me it was such a distraction that it took away from an otherwise fun movie.
STORY: It is a typical kids movie with a dash of funny adult humor sprinkled in here and there. The pacing was OK and it kept my interest but I wasn't drawn into it and completely engaged. Although other prehistoric kids movies have been made, this one did have fresh characters and a unique storyline.
FINAL THOUGHTS: We enjoyed watching it as a family and my kids liked but didn't love it. Once was enough for me and my recommendation is pretty simple - Rent it, enjoy it and give it back... it wasn't worth purchasing.",1389052800,,874,4.434782608695652

5631143,5,B00BJ0RERM,Some people might say that this movie starts off a little slow. I thought it started out just fine. I love when they get to the colorful world. I found this to be a great family movie. It is also one I don't mind watching over and over again. A very important thing to think of when purchasing a movie when you have kids.,1389052800,,321,4.03125

5631150,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I had friends tell me that, while good, this was not on par with Dreamworks other hits.  They were wrong.  The animation in this, yet again, raises the bar for the realism that can be accomplished through animation.  The textures make the screen appear slimy or bumpy or hairy with unbelievable realism.  Its just hard to believe that this didn't win every award that there was...the creators and everyone involved should know that they have accomplished a true masterpiece.",1388966400,,474,4.962025316455696

5631165,4,B00BJ0RERM,"You really have to hand it to DreamWorks; often considered second fiddle to the mastery of the CG craft that is Pixar, these guys just continue to release solid family flick after solid family flick.  Known as the money studio, The Croods is a good example of genuinely clever writing and a solid story carrying a piece over just an inflated budget being used to force advertising down our proverbial throats.

Released back in March of 2013 domestically, The Croods was created on a budget of $135-mil, its been a smashing commercial success having taken in well over 587-million and counting.  Never ones to let a franchise opportunity pass them by, DreamWorks already has plans for a sequel and ongoing television series (following in the footsteps of franchises like the Penguins of Madagascar, King-Fu Panda, Monsters Vs. Aliens, How to Train Your Dragon and so on) in the works.

The film loosely follows the exploits of teenage cave-girl Eep (Emma Stone) who, in addition to dealing with all of the nonsense that comes with being a human teenager (including alienation from her family, self-discovery and so on), she has the unfortunate distinction of going through puberty during the stone-age.  Worse still, her family (The Croods) aren't even the sharper of the two quickly evolving human species running around.  Nowhere is this more evident than when the dreamy (to Eep anyway) Guy (Ryan Reynolds) comes on the scene with a more upright walking position, lesser forehead and a whole host of useful inventions/ discoveries to share.

This would be a win/win if not for Eeps father Grug (Nicolas Cage) who, in addition to suddenly discovering his gene pool is in the losing end of the whole survival of the fittest thing; his very manhood becomes threatened when this new hotshot continually shows him up in front of his family.  As you might expect, Grug is frustrated and purposely obstinate to his physical detriment time and time again.

The pace of the film is surprisingly brisk and becomes an action piece right on through to its fruition shortly after were introduced to the characters.  Visually, the film is beautiful with a rich color pallet and textures absolutely rife with the perfect amount of detail to hint toward otherworldliness.  As you might suspect, the scale of many of the yet evolving plants and animals occupying planet earth are, well, off the scale.

Perhaps most interestingly, the film takes us to a land where many fantastical but lethal evolutionary hybrids dwell, stalk and hunt.  Among these the half dog/ crocodilian called a Crocopup or the colorfully feathered and furred half parrot/ half saber tooth tiger Macawnivore (that quite frankly looks like it may have been lifted and transplanted directly from James Camerons alien world in Avatar).  This results in amazing replay value whereby whats going on in the background can be as enjoyable to spot as the main prose for multi-time viewers.

Interestingly, the runaway success that is The Croods actually began life as a proposed five-part film deal from Claymation geniuses Aardman (hilariously titled Crood Awakening).  Its also the first DreamWorks piece to have been distributed by 20th Century Fox (their prior films were distributed by Paramount Pictures).

In conclusion, The Croods will likely appeal to viewers of all interests with its witty writing (especially the subtle scientifically accurate gags), the fast pace and wonderfully unique environments.  While its clear DreamWorks is wasting no time in riding the wave of the films popularity, one can hardly blame them considering the end results here.",1388880000,,3615,5.098305084745762

5631213,2,B00BJ0RERM,"If, like me, you saw the previews and trailers for this film and thought it looked good, you're likely to be disappointed.  All the best moments are shown in the couple minutes of the previews.  There was a lot of potential in the script, but the team at Dreamworks missed the mark most of the time.
The opening scene sets the tone for how the rest of the movie plays outs.  The Croods are ""hunting,""  trying to get an egg for their dinner and having to compete with various other animals.  You would think with the baby acting like wild animal, the fat clumsy son, the crazy old grandma, etc, there would be plenty of opportunity for great slap stick.  Unfortunately, the creative team didn't meet the expectations.
The cast did not bring anything to the movie either. None of the actors (with the exception of Cloris Leachman who did not have a big enough role) has the ad lib talent to bring anything special to their characters.  They simply read their lines in the script.  Most great animated movies have voice actors who are able to add a unique quality to their characters that the writers and animators are able to play off of and punch up the movie.  John Cleese was one of the story creators, but he should have been one of the actors too.  He would have been able to bring a silliness to a character and not simply read his part.
Finally, the movie fell short with subtle adult humor.  Children do not get enough silly cute characters and scenes; and adults do not get enough humor that are the hallmarks in any good family movie.
If you're bored and have nothing better to do and you can get this movie for free, then go ahead and watch it.  It is mildly amusing (very mild).  Otherwise, I recommend you not waste your time.",1388534400,3,1737,4.4245283018867925

I don't expect to enjoy the same movies that my son enjoys, but with Dreamworks movies I find I don't mind them as much because they're good about incorporating some more parent-oriented humor in the film from time to time and creating interesting characters with enough of a plot to keep you entertained.

5631233,4,B00BJ0RERM,The Croods is a fun story that follows (mostly) a teenage girl who happens to live in a caveman family with members who are not the brightest stars in the night sky. It is a lot of fun and her on-going battle with her dad (not surprising for teen girls with dense dads) provides plenty of tension and laughs.,1388448000,,308,4.237288135593221
5631234,5,B00BJ0RERM,"The Croods is a fun movie to watch, filled with action and packed with laughs. This film is great for the entire family. The younger viewers will enjoy the antics of the prehistoric cave family, and will also have the adult viewers chuckling from start to finish. This is the best example of family cohesiveness displayed in a film since Pixar's Incredibles from several years ago. The 3D is excellent in this Blu ray version and is quite a visual feast for the eyes.",1388448000,,467,4.571428571428571
5631235,4,B00BJ0RERM,"It seems like Hollywood has learned that there is money to be made in children's animated features. Perhaps not the time consuming drawn animation but the computer animated feature. Almost every month a new animated film hits the theaters. For fans this turns into something precious with the release of those same films on DVD to own and treasure for years to come. Are all worth it? Perhaps not. But THE CROODS is one that should be.

The movie opens in the early life of a planet much like Earth (with what follows it doesn't appear to be here but close enough). While most families disappear the same can't be said of the Croods. That's because father Grugg lives by a simple rule: don't do anything. The problem is that he has a teenage daughter named Eep who, like most teens, just doesn't seem to want to listen. She wants to explore, to wander the world and see what's out there. Grugg just wants to get by, stay in their cave and go out only as a group to find food. As she points out to him this isn't living, it's existing.

One night Eep sees a light shining outside of their cave. She moves the stone placed in front enough to get out and follows the light. What she finds is someone completely unlike her and her family, a young man named Guy. It's apparent that Guy is a bit further along the evolutionary scale than Eep and her group. Not only does he seem different, the light she saw was something she's never witnessed before, namely fire.

Guy tries to warn Eep that they all need to move because the end of the world that they know is coming. Their only hope is to make their way to higher ground, a mountain he has seen in the distance. When Eep takes this news back to her family they panic and dismiss Guy's warning. That is until the land begins to shift and shake and the lower mountains on either side of their cave collapse. Had they been inside they would have all perished. Instead they find themselves taking Guy's advice and moving on.

This is where most of the story comes from, this fear of the unknown and being willing to take a risk to find out what lies beyond the horizon...literally. While they've always lived their lives in a cave, in fear of any and everything outside of it, there is a whole wide world that the Croods have never seen let alone experienced, a world filled with danger certainly but also with great beauty and mystery as well. Now, with no other options, they will experience this new world first hand.

Along the way there is also a rift that develops between father and daughter. While Grugg only has Eep's best interest in mind, she and the rest of the family begin to look up to Guy instead and follow his lead. A defeated Grugg feels he has lost his family but that soon changes.

The movie is a delight for the eyes and features some hilarious moments as well. The adventure factor involved is spot on and holds your interest from start to finish. Some of the running jokes in the film, especially those involving Grugg's mother in law, work well and remain funny from start to finish. But most importantly the love shared between the members of the Crood family is one that will offer a great lesson to children of all ages.

While the Croods are a far cry from the ""sophisticated"" cavemen seen in the Flintstones, they do offer some amusement for the length of the film. Not only does it entertain it offers life lessons as well and one couldn't ask much more of a children's film these days. This is one that needs to be added to everyone's shelf.",1388448000,,3517,4.409861325115562

5631322,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I have watched it multiple times with my daughter and love it every time. My 18 month old loves this movie, probably all the colors in it. They did a good job with this movie. Hopefully they make a sequel.",1387929600,,205,4.15
5631323,5,B00BJ0RERM,My daughter received this for Christmas. She has been asking for it for ages and was very pleased to get it for Christmas. Has a cute little plushy toy included. Small but hey she thinks its great and you cant beat that!,1387929600,,220,4.261904761904762

5631327,3,B00BJ0RERM,"It's cute, but overly long. Animation was decent. I couldn't really buy Nick Cage as a caveman. Emma Stone was adorable as always. Overall a solid three star movie for me.",1387843200,,171,4.548387096774194

5631329,5,B00BJ0RERM,"This movie's level of comedy is extremely high and it has more of a scientific base in evolution that comes as a surprising relief. While children may enjoy the bright colors and adults may laugh until their tear ducts hurt, the science in this film is phenomenal. All of the creatures and plants in this film are possible creations in terms of traits from the DNA strand. I was very impressed at the level of sophistication placed within this film.",1387843200,,449,4.625
5631330,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Loved the movie. It has all the right moments for a family movie. Sincerely recommended.

5631334,5,B00BJ0RERM,"My husband and our three kids, ages 10 (daughter), 12 (son), and 13 (son) watched The Croods for one of our family nights. It was one of the funniest and cutest family movies to date. Expect a lot of humor, witty ideas, adventure, and of course, a plot that will melt your heart and inspire the bonding of family. Sometimes it's difficult to find that movie where my husband, myself, and my sons and daughter all agree on, but this one managed to meet all of us in the middle and keep us entertained. I'd also like to mention two of my kids have Autism, so its difficult to hold their attention for an entire movie sometimes, again, The Croods captured their attention even after the movie was over and they wanted to go to the croods website! I would recommend this movie to all the families with a variety of tough skinned movie goers. 5 stars!",1387670400,,846,4.3949044585987265

Good animation.  Good little story.  Lots of funny lines.

Nothing more to say. The end.",1387670400,,114,4.55
5631338,5,B00BJ0RERM,"We sat down to watch this with low expectations, it just didn't look all that fantastic. Boy, were we wrong. Super cute, funny, and heartwarming. Loved it!",1387670400,,155,4.777777777777778
5631339,5,B00BJ0RERM,"The Croods was, for me, a happy surprise. Worth seeing for the dazzling, hallucinogenic animation, the story, when it gets manic, provides some gasp-for-a-breath laughs.
Filled with familiar tropes: Headstrong girl meets cute boy, ""out with the old, in with the new,"" and apparently mother-in-law jokes are literally pre-historic. But the script frequently catches the pace of a Robin Williams' routine with jokes coming so fast and word-play so sharp that this movie will hold up to repeated viewings.
Even the musical score gets in on the laughs (an adapted version of Fleetwood Mac's ""Tusk"" is one highlight).
There is more tension and scares than is typical of a PG film, only partly relieved by comfortably familiar character types and enough slapstick to please or bore as your taste may dictate. Younger viewers may find the cute but dangerous creatures that often threaten the Crood clan disturbing.
But oh, the animation. The Croods does not take place in a recognizable version of pre-historic earth and it is much the better for it. The landscapes, creatures and even the weather are simultaneously realistic and surreal, sure to have you reaching often for the pause button to take in images that would make Salvador Dali and Joan Miro wish they were alive and working in animation.
The Croods is the best animated film I've seen this year. That said, I hope I'm not descended from them.",1387670400,,1399,4.982905982905983

5631361,5,B00BJ0RERM,If you looking for something to watch with the kids or just looking for a good story. This is about a prehistorical family who struggles to survive the dawn of Pangaea.,1387584000,,168,4.451612903225806

When the Croods use fire for the first time, everything goes wrong, but it is funny. The color is great and the creatures are just a little but different, which makes is a good animation. It's a light comedy and I enjoyed it.",1387411200,,381,4.366197183098592

Didn't expect much at first, but I really liked it.  Best kids movie I've seen since Wreck it Ralph....Beats Epic and Monsters University.",1387411200,,268,4.5625
5631373,5,B00BJ0RERM,"This was a fun movie! I have 4 kids (7,5,3,2 when we saw this movie)  and it is getting hard to find a movie that appeals to both my 7 year old and my 2 year old! This movie did just that! It was intense in some places but my kids didn't get too scared (and we are a bunch that is easily scared).  My husband laughed out loud in a lot of places.  It is a really excellent movie, and I can recommend it to any age bracket!",1387411200,,421,3.707865168539326

If you have a Croods fan, get this for them.  They won't be disappointed.  If your kids have never seen it, they won't be disappointed with this purchase.",1387324800,2,330,4.4
5631375,3,B00BJ0RERM,"I really don't know what to say on this movie. I think it is just a really middle of the road film. It has moments of action, humor, reflection, etc, but it just has a lot of flaws. I thought the idea of the movie was great. I thought the actors did well.

But the story itself had some real issues. I wasn't big on the artwork or design in the film. It was almost too much for me. My kids enjoyed it, but unlike other movies they have they haven't put this one on more than the one time. This should be a red flag for many. I mean my oldest must have watched Nemo a hundred times!

If you just feel you must watch this film, rent it! That or wait until it hits 5 bucks... Currently at around 15, it is not a good deal...",1387324800,,721,3.864864864864865

5631412,1,B00BJ0RERM,Definitely a take on the garden of Eden and man redeeming himself. The Garden of Eden was representative of Man's doubting God's love while man was in Paradise. If we would have accepted God's forgiveness it would have shown that we truly love God in all his Glory and the world would not be like it is today. Instead Christ had to climb up on a cross and wash the disciples feet to demonstrate His love. You can't ask for forgiveness from someone you do not love ! Not what is told in the Croods!,1386979200,,497,4.242105263157895

5631424,5,B00BJ0RERM,"My whole family loves this movie.  Even the adults find it enjoyable.  They included many plays on words to add humor for adults, but they were clean references.  The dad and eldest daughter butt heads, but in the end they both learn valuable lessons and realize how much they care for each other.

The only word I remember not enjoying is when the father said something ""sucked"". Overall, it's a family film I don't mind watching over and over as some kids tend to do. Having 3D is fun too!",1386288000,,299,4.454545454545454

5631488,4,B00BJ0RERM,"Pretty cute movie. My kids loved it (when my kids love something and it keeps them distracted then mom and dad love it). I liked it, silly movie with a good ""family values"" storyline in there. Not normally a huge fan of the Cage, but I think I was able to get onboard with him in this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie if you're looking for a good family night flick. Heck, I would watch it without the kids to be honest.",1386201600,,434,4.178571428571429

5631490,5,B00BJ0RERM,"This was a cute movie and had lots of action and beautiful colored scenery to keep a young child's attention in the theatre.

I just see it as another cute kid movie.",1386201600,,295,4.481481481481482
5631491,4,B00BJ0RERM,"Definitely funny kids movie that parents can sit down and enjoy with the children as much if not maybe even more than the children (I know for one my wife and I were dying of laughter).

Don't want to give away any details of the movie, but it was most definitely a pleasant surprise.  Much better than I had originally imagined.

Definitely worth watching at least once, hence why I rented it in HD on Amazon Instant Video which streams so much better to my house than Netflix.",1386201600,,478,4.409090909090909

makes me laugh everytime. This is a beautiful movie and is a great present for any young child.",1386115200,,222,4.717948717948718
5631496,3,B00BJ0RERM,"Okay, this was not my favorite animated movie of all time, not even close.  It was watchable, but I doubt I will be sitting down to view it every year like I do with Toy Story or The Incredibles.  Basically, its not a treasure, but a movie you can sit down and see with the kids on some lazy afternoon.

The story is set in some mythological Stone Age.  I say mythological because the creatures we see are pretty unrealistic...cute, but unrealistic.  I mean, a tiger-like creature with parrot colors?  Flying birds that eat someone down to the bone in a few seconds?  Plus, the main predator that is hunting this family, of which I never could figure out what kind of creature that was supposed to be.

Be that as it may, our family includes the father, Grug, who teaches his wife and kids and the grandma to fear the outside world...due to the fact that so many things want to kill and eat you.  They only go out of the cave to find food, which seemed to involve way more work than the calories would give you energy for.  A cute scene that reminded you of a high stakes football game, with an egg instead of a ball, but it honestly made little sense.  Then it all changes and their life (survival really) changes.

Some spoilers below:

Again, be that as it may...Eep is a red-haired daughter who is tired of being told what she can't do, because there is little she can do.  She longs for more.  One night, she creeps out of the cave when she sees a light and discovers...FIRE!  Oh, and the guy who discovered it, curiously named...Guy.  Of course, they end up liking each other and Grug isn't happy with that, or the fact that Guy is encouraging his daughter (and family) to leave behind their safe refuge and go out into the world more.  Of course, this decision is taken away from them due to the impending End Of The World (one imagines it has something to do with the break-up of the continents, but that's never really made too clear).  Guy is intent on leading them to this mountain, where he thinks they will be safe?  Or they are supposed to leave the mountain for the Sun?  Again, unclear.  Got the end of the movie and it was still unclear.

There are plenty of funny bits along the way, colorful (fantasy) creatures, and the invention of wearing (LIVE!) animals as part of your clothing.  The interaction between Grug and Gran remind you that the strife between mother-in-law-and son-in-law go back to the beginnings...apparently.  Sandy, the younger daughter, is also pretty funny as she hardly talks, mostly growls, and can run down most things and take them out.  The older son is much more like Grug, but not half as smart.  He also discovers the first pet!  The mother, on the other hand, was rather forgettable as a character, sadly.

This movie might have been better with more build-up of the characters and an end goal that made more sense.  I did really enjoy their first interaction with fire, though, and the animation was quite well done.  The action scenes were also pretty good and this movie WILL be entertaining enough for the kids, but its not so much for the adults as Toy Story or The Incredibles or even Brave.",1386115200,,3146,4.476274165202109
5631497,5,B00BJ0RERM,"This was a fabulous movie. A great family movie. I love that the Dad is always concerned about keeping his family safe. I also loved the little jokes in it as well.

My wife and I thought it was alright which is why I am giving it 4 stars, wasn't as funny as Shrek.  With the all star cast we expected more.

All in all its a good family movie with some decent humor.  My 10 year old just loved it which is also why it got the 4 stars.

Watching it in 3D is even more fantastic!  You have things flying out at you, the color is phenomenal and the depth of the picture itself is great!

However, once I realized it was Nicholas Cage as Grug, I only see him as Nicholas Cage anymore and I don't like it.  I love the character that plays Thunk.  He was funny on The Office, too.",1384992000,,355,4.268656716417911

5631628,5,B00BJ0RERM,"This comes with a REAL Digital Copy (non-Internet)where as Disney is sending out guessing Digital Copy on some of their movies as you do not know if you will be able to view the movie via ITunes or not until after you buy it, open it, put your code in and then BAM! You can view it only with an internet connection is the only option as Amazon etc might be the only viewer!! A MESS that is what it is, a MESS!!!!

However, THIS DVD can be unlocked in ITunes which can be viewed on the different Apple products without an Internet connection! It should not matter but I purchased the multidisc version.

If Digital Copy (non-Internet) is a factor as it is in our family, then be careful what you purchase because just because it says Digital Copy, it might mean internet connection only!",1384905600,,786,4.376712328767123

5631644,5,B00BJ0RERM,"If a year ago you had told me that there would be an animated movie about cavemen and that I would enjoy it, I would probably have said you have the wrong movie person. But once again the movies I expect not to like or to completely hate, become the movies that I love to see. Much like Disney's Wreck-It-Ralph( and equally as good if not almost better) The Croods is funny, family-oriented, heartwarming, and interesting. Yes I am a guy, I am an adult, but I did shed some tears during certain parts of the movie. Despicable Me 2 is my favorite animated film of the year thus far, but I can definitely put The Croods as my #2. I hope everybody who has/going to watch The Croods enjoys it as much as I do. Great voice acting, great animation, and a positive message with the adventurous storyline.

Starring: Nicholas Cage, Ryan Reynolds, Emma Stone, Catherine Keener",1384819200,,873,4.484276729559748
5631645,5,B00BJ0RERM,So funny!!!!  The animals were especially funny.  Totally unpredictable!  We actually watched it twice.  I would recommend it to all.,1384819200,,133,5.5
5631646,4,B00BJ0RERM,"A Stone Age family of six, The Croods live in a world where life is a nonstop struggle for survival and where anything new is to be feared and avoided at all cost. Or at least that's what young Eep (Emma Stone) has been taught to believe by her well-meaning but over-protective dad, Grug (Nicholas Cage). But Eep is a naturally bright and curious sort, and when she meets a cute boy, Guy, (Ryan Reynolds) living out on his own who's discovered this new-fangled thing called ""fire,"" she makes it her life's mission to start venturing out a bit more on her own. Guy also offers her a more optimistic view of life and the future than she gets from her scaredy-cat dad who prefers to huddle with his family in a tiny cave safe from the threats outside. But when an earthquake destroys the family's cave, they are all forced to hazard out into the big bad scary world of threats by nature and hungry prehistoric predators.

Written and directed by Chris Sanders and Kirk DeMicco, ""The Croods"" is lively and fun and built upon the theme of learning to face one's fears and of finding the courage to move on to bigger and better things in spite of the potential dangers lurking along one's path..

In addition to the amusing, nicely differentiated family members, there's the customary bevy of cute and cuddly prehistoric creatures (even the threatening ones are kind of cuddly) to make this a fine, non-threatening look at life in prehistoric times, fit even for the more impressionable kiddies.

The computer-generated animation is clean, if not exactly envelope-pushing or spectacular, and it makes up in speed what it lacks in sophistication.",1384819200,,1639,4.743859649122807
5631647,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I thought that this movie was going to be awful. And, for the first I don't remember how long, I found myself wishing that my family would lose interest and choose to watch something else. I couldn't stand the character played by Nicolas Cage. However, at some point both that character and the movie redeemed itself. And, I found myself actually enjoying the film... a lot. So, if you can endure both Nicolas cage and the character to whom he gives voice for a seemingly long while, then you may really enjoy this movie. If that is too much to ask, you may not. (In the last case: Run away! Dont walk! Run!)",1384819200,,608,4.389380530973451

5631697,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Preparing to write this review, I can already picture my son (almost 3 years) cracking up as Guy (Ryan Reynolds) introduces Belt, his pet, cook, conversationalist and navigator, who also holds up his pants....""dah duh daaaaahhhhhhh!"" This is a phenomenal film, one of my favorite in the past several years- and I am making this statement across all film genre's rather than limiting to antimated pictures. In brief, the story is a phenomenal tale of the importance of being open-minded and accepting of change, as told through the trials and tribulations of one of the last remaining caveman familes. Disclaimer, I contend that I probably have a tumor sitting on my amygdala, as I am prone to being tearful at most heartfelt movies with a nice musical-score to accompany the climactic moments; and I am probably a therapist's dream patient for dysfunctional family issues. These thoughts in mind- this movie was perfect. The visuals were nothing short of amazing, the 3D is some of the best I have seen (plenty of depth, but also with well implemented pop-out effects that we all claim are gimmicky but secretly love), and the voice actors were phenomenal. I don't say this often, but I actually enjoyed Nicholas Cage in this role (and would welcome him in other animated roles)- his style of overacting(a la The Rock) was perfect for the role. I have thus far only viewed part of the bonus features, but they are enjoyable, and the digital copy works well on my computer and iPad.

5631734,5,B00BJ0RERM,I loved the movie! and the little toy was just the cutest!!! I am glad that I bought it! I would do it again.,1384300800,,109,3.5833333333333335
5631735,3,B00BJ0RERM,"The movie was funny in parts.  We enjoyed watching the movie, but don't have any desire to watch it again.  It's just not one of those movies that you love and want to watch several times.  Some of my Disney favorites include The Incredilbes, Tangled, and The Princess and The Frog.",1384300800,,282,4.490196078431373
5631736,5,B00BJ0RERM,Awesome movie for all ages! Lots of laughs and uplifting with great morals! My three year old's new favorite movie!,1384300800,,115,4.8
5631737,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Fun for the whole family from my 4 year old boy to 8 year old daughter.  Both my wife and I had a blast too.

A few scary moments with the animals but overall very safe for the whole family.  Even my 2 year old watched some of it but he's a little too young for the scary moments(big animals chasing the Croods family).

The movie is a comedy at its heart but plenty of action to keep you interested for young/old, boys/girls.

This movie streamed well in HD without stopping or stuttering. (but this may be variable based on your internet speed!)

Great one for movie night with your kids!",1384214400,,590,4.27027027027027

5631753,1,B00BJ0RERM,"Don't bother. So. Predicable. Teenagers are much smarter than Dad, a tough guy but portrayed as a fearful idiot until more evolved teens, destined to fall in love, force him to change. Humor is partly about Dad hoping Grandma gets knocked off. Ugh. Yawn. Unimpressive waste of time. We rented because a little friend liked it but should have read reviews first. I imagine this isn't the only review of its kind.",1384214400,10,411,4.722222222222222

There have been movies done of the people from the stone age, and if you can remember that one movie were the lady was dress in her cavewomen dress and I think it was  Ms. Welch.....watching the father taking care of his family to keep them out of harms way was funny and interesting as to what was going to happen next.  Their home was falling away, they had to leave and find a new home. Well they did that was better then the last one and even a new family member was added as well as wild cat turn into house cat.  Then the one thing that held this family together that the daughter was the one to know what a family going in and out of one thing to the next.....was LOVE.

5631813,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I don't know why I had avoided watching this; for some reason I had really low expectations. But my wife purchased this and after sitting through it with her I was pleasantly surprised and entertained.

You could call the story somewhat predictable, but the quality of the voice acting and the jokes pull you through a decent family night of entertainment. This is a movie that is safe for kids while still having jokes that an adult will enjoy. There are so many little moments that make this memorable that I don't want to spoil any of it here.

Like I said, the plotline itself you can probably see coming a mile away, but the journey is still fun and we find ourselves using some of the quotes in real life now as in-jokes. If I were to compare it to another animated film, I'd say it's not quite Shrek quality, but really close (and better than some of the Shrek sequels)",1383523200,,876,4.401234567901234

Never been a really big fan of Nick Cage, although he gets into some really interesting films. However, his delivery in this film is really something. A strong and moving film that imagines a scenario from which can be implied emerged the origins of modern humans. In this sense, there is also a sense of nostalgia and positivism as well as an implicit foreboding about the film. Recommended.",1383523200,,560,4.5

But this weekend we were pleasantly surprised with The Croods.  We watched this movie with five kids, ages ranging from 5 to 17, and every one of us laughed at some of the scenes and situations that took place.  The next day, our 12 year old son started quoting lines from the movie (something boys and men tend to do with their favorites), so I knew that this movie was a big hit.  The kids even asked to watch it again the next day.  If you are looking for a movie with humor, adventure, and a sweet message about valuing your family (even if you don't always get along), I highly recommend The Croods!  ~~PringlesGuy's Wife",1383436800,,786,4.386206896551724

5631864,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Watched the Croods tonight. I have to say that this was one of the best animated Family films that I have ever seen. I was amazed at the wonderful story lines. And how it was was created with a lot of imagination as well as a good message. I was also impressed that it was both a film that both Kids and adults might find very entertaining. The most important thing was that it was about family and how to deal with letting fear control your life. And about taking risks. It said a lot about the bonds of a family as well as the love that is there even in the most dire of situations. It was also nice to view a film, that was not riddled with excessive violence or offensive language.

The Croods are a ""caveman"" family who's lifestyle is forced to change as their world begins to self-destruct. It's great family entertainment filled with humor and  emotion, lots of gorgeous scenery, wonderful characters, and a very happy and touching ending. This one goes on my Favorites list.",1383264000,,376,5.163934426229508
5631902,3,B00BJ0RERM,"One thing I really liked is for once the dad became the hero instead of the butt of the joke. It's a cute family movie and I'd watch it again but I have to say the Ice Age movies are better. I didn't see Nicolas Cage as the dad, he needed a bigger voice.",1383264000,,254,3.7222222222222223
5631903,3,B00BJ0RERM,"Animation (technical aspects) outstanding, excellent cast, great voiceovers. Wasn't as funny as I would have expected, feels like the movie was made to sell merchandise more than to tell a story.",1383264000,,195,5.32258064516129

5631909,5,B00BJ0RERM,This was the first animated 3D movie that I had ever seen and it far exceeded my expectations in both the quality of the animation and 3D as well as the plot itself. The storyline itself makes the movie worth watching but the acting (voice) cast and the other aspects of the movie add to make this an excellent choice. The adults enjoyed the movie almost as much as the children did.,1383177600,,383,4.333333333333333

I felt, however, that the whole movie was a clever preachment concerning progressive ideals and the youth over the older generation.

5631930,3,B00BJ0RERM,My six year old daughter liked this but we thought it was really silly and not that great.  The best part of the movie was the beginning in the race for food.,1383091200,,158,3.9375

Wow, was I wrong. This movie was really great! The story was clever, the imagery was interesting, the music was good, and the characters were actually developed in realistic ways. Even the secondary characters weren't forgotten. The humor varied from slapstick to subtle. The pace was good, and the action varied from tense to humorous. It actually made me tear up at one point - which is unusual. Well done, DreamWorks! Another keeper!",1382313600,,609,4.809523809523809

5632207,5,B00BJ0RERM,This movie was great! The characters & story line were great. We watched it again the next day. The whole time we kept watching the movie we kept saying how Eep's character was what we expected the character in Brave to be like and was very disappointed it was not. Dreamwork's does it again. I wish we had just bought it rather than rent it. I will be adding this to the buy list.,1382227200,,381,4.162162162162162

5632223,4,B00BJ0RERM,"I didn't get to the theater to watch this simply due to not knowing what to expect (meaning I didn't want to potentially spend money on a bad movie if it turned out that way).  I was pleased with the movie.  I have two young children (6 & 4) and they really had a great time watching it.  It was good enough that I wanted to watch it again within a couple days.  I see some people don't like it with the role the father figure gets, but it's poking fun at cavemen.  It also includes a modern tension that arises when the father can't stand a boy (Guy) who the daughter is falling for him.",1382054400,,588,4.0344827586206895

Well it finally released on Amazon Instant and I thought I'd finally give it a shot. It was definitely funny, and my family and I were laughing throughout. Nicholas Cage can be hit or miss with me, but he excels as the father role and had me, as a father myself,  understanding the difficulty of watching your kid grow up and developing independence. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with children or someone who enjoys animated features.",1382054400,,615,4.590909090909091
5632228,3,B00BJ0RERM,"I found this movie though entertaining and heart warming near the end, the Croods were a very dysfunctional family... A lot of resentment toward character Guy by the father who believed he was being replaced. The Father wanting to knock off his mother-n-laws. An animalistic baby girl, a half brained son and a very passive mother. The daughter on the other hand was just your typical young girl wanting to see the world and what it offered. Overall I give it acceptable grade to watch with friends or family night.",1382054400,,515,4.733333333333333

5632303,4,B00BJ0RERM,"I've always had a bit of mixed feeling toward Dreamworks' output.  While they've created some amazing films, they've also produced some mediocre, annoying films that I can't really stand to watch.  I rank movies such as ""How To Train Your Dragon,"" ""Rise of the Guardians,"" and ""Megamind"" among my favorite movies ever, while the endless parade of ""Madagascar"" and ""Shrek"" films mostly annoy me.  And while their animation and storytelling abilities have improved greatly over the years, their movies relying less and less on quickly-dated pop culture references and celebrity voice actors to cash in at the theaters, I still prefer Pixar for most of my 3D-animated classics.  Maybe I'm being harsh, but then again, this studio did produce ""Shark Tale...""

When I saw advertisements for ""The Croods,"" I was expecting a film a step down from ""How To Train Your Dragon.""  I was pleasantly surprised to find that, while the film isn't a masterpiece, it's still very entertaining, visually creative, and even sweet.

""The Croods"" follows a family of Neanderthals, the titular Croods, as they fight to survive during the awkward pre-civilized days of the world.  Family patriarch Grug (voiced by Nicholas Cage) goes by the philosophy of ""never not be afraid,"" and he emphasizes this by forbidding the family from leaving the cave at night or from trying to explore beyond their homelands.  Teenage daughter Eep (voiced by Emma Stone) resents her father's rules and longs for adventure and something new, but gets a lot more than she bargained for when an earthquake destroys the family's cave.  Terrified and lost in a strange new world, the family reluctantly accepts the help of a wandering Cro-Magnon boy named Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds), who claims the world is ending and they have to get to ""high ground"" to survive.  Along the way Eep will find the adventure she's looking for, and the entire family, including Grug, will learn that there's far more to life and the world than simple fear.

Like most DreamWorks movies, ""The Croods"" falls back on a big-name cast to carry it's voices, with such names as Nicholas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, and Cloris Leachman.  Thankfully, the ""star power"" of the movie doesn't threaten to overwhelm it, and the voices feel natural coming out of the characters' mouths.  Even Cage, who's notorious for simply playing himself in every movie he's in, does a good job as Grug.  Perhaps playing a voice instead of a face on screen helps him rein himself in a bit more...

The animation in this film is great as well, easily on par with most Pixar films.  The environments are lavishly detailed, both the dry desert where the Croods are shown first living and the lush colorful jungles they traverse through in their search for a new home.  The animals in the film are a wild mix, each a blend of two different animals (turtle birds, land whales, piranha birds, dog lizards, two different big cats that are colored and modeled after an owl and a parrot respectively).  This can be a bit jarring for people who know their prehistoric animals or are used to the somewhat more realistic-looking critters of the ""Ice Age"" movies, but it does make the movie a visual treat.

While not as imaginative a story as some (it's basically ""The Land Before Time"" with cavemen instead of dinosaurs), it's still a fun one, and the antics of the family help carry it.  The Croods are a delightfully, well, crude bunch, still establishing basic social mores and showing amazement and even fear at every new sight, whether it's fire or new animals or even something as simple as the concept of shoes.  And anyone who comes from a good-sized family, especially a multi-generational one, can probably identify with at least one of the characters, whether it's the rebellious Eep or the bumbling brother Thunk or even the stubborn but fiercely protective Grug.  Grug's eagerness to see his mother-in-law die can be a bit off-putting, though, and seemed to be a needlessly harsh running gag throughout the movie.

While it's not on par with ""How To Train Your Dragon,"" ""The Croods"" is still one of Dreamworks' better CGI films.  It's visually fascinating, with fun characters and plenty of humor scattered throughout that doesn't lean heavily on pop-culture references to succeed.  It's definitely worth watching, and a great family film.  Probably best for ages 8 and up due to some scary scenes.",1381881600,,4414,4.90578734858681

5632363,5,B00BJ0RERM,What a pleasant surprise. One of the funniest movies in a long time. Laughed out loud many times. Well worth the money to buy.,1381795200,,126,4.291666666666667

5632367,5,B00BJ0RERM,We loved the croods! My 5 year old picked it out and it was a great movie for the whole family. Great family movie!,1381795200,,115,3.8333333333333335

5632383,2,B00BJ0RERM,"This movie is funny in a cute way, and well made. Sadly, the message it sends to women and girls of all ages is that men and boys - no matter how thick-headed they may be - are the only ones who can come up with a new idea or a solution to a problem. Even when the survival of your own kind is at stake. Further, it paints women as driven mostly by primal hungers whose capacity to judge is always swayed by emotional and sexual attraction. Oh, and that no matter what they should be supportive of whatever ideas the men or boys around them have, however hair-brained. God this is getting old. Parents, please think twice about letting this candy-coated bit of gender programming into your son's and daughter's world view and self-image.",1381708800,2,737,4.426470588235294
5632384,4,B00BJ0RERM,"I rarely if ever give 5 stars, so I won't now. This movie had laughs (cute gags) and a few good 'belly laughs'. Ok, so the creators stretched a few historical 'things/concepts), but it was worth it, it was a cartoon! It even turned into a family movie when my teenage boy decided to watch and enjoy the movie (I caught him laughing). So sit back and enjoy the show, it was entertaining.",1381708800,,386,4.301369863013699
5632385,5,B00BJ0RERM,This was one of the funniest and heart warming movies I have ever seen. The whole family loved it! Great!,1381708800,,105,4.3

5632388,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I recommend this movie for families, couples, or anyone for that matter.  It's entertaining, even heart warming. I even recommend listening to the sound track as it scrolls through the credits.  I also want to thank those who gave their reviews for this flick.  That why I rented it, and it was totally worth it.",1381708800,,312,4.636363636363637
5632389,5,B00BJ0RERM,This was the funniest animated movie about cavemen and their struggle to survive the changing world around them. Emma Stone is the best voice for her teen cave girl character!,1381708800,,175,4.866666666666666
5632390,3,B00BJ0RERM,"I was really hoping to enjoy this more, but then I have to admit, I'd rather watch a good suspense or action flick than cartoons, any day. My husband is the animation fan, so I generally go along for the ride. There was one thing that struck me though, that I absolutely loved about this movie... although it really didn't have anything to do with the movie itself. The leading lady in this animated film wasn't drawn with the body of a barbie doll! She was much more realistic with an athletic body that bordered on being short and almost stocky. I'm sure the only reason they drew her that way was because she was a cave-girl, but since there weren't any non-cave girls in it, I liked it.",1381708800,,690,4.3565891472868215
5632391,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I normally don't watch this type of movie but enjoyed this one enough to buy a Kindle copy for myself!  The characters are very easy to sympathize with and I love the quality of the digital work.  Very colorful, humorous and imaginative!",1381708800,,237,4.619047619047619
5632392,3,B00BJ0RERM,"It's very good and entertainment I really enjoy it, it's good for kids but also parents can enjoy the movie",1381708800,,107,4.4
5632393,5,B00BJ0RERM,What a fun movie. I will enjoy watching this with my grandson for years to come. Wonderful  movie for the whole family.,1381708800,,119,4.409090909090909
5632394,4,B00BJ0RERM,Kids loved it.  It was mostly about a father daughter relationship with the message of anyone can change. Predictable but quite interesting. Had plenty of action and strange creatures which kept both the kids and family entertained.,1381708800,,232,5.27027027027027
5632395,5,B00BJ0RERM,"This was a lot of fun to watch with our 6yr old daughter. Will do again soon.

5632409,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Watched this movie with my husband and kids. My husband is not a ""kid movie"" kind of person but he laughed the whole way through along with the rest of us. My son laughed harder than I've ever seen him laugh at a movie. This is a must see for sure!!!",1381708800,,250,3.9215686274509802
5632410,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I love when my son can't contain his laughter, and this movie had us both going. Funny, and some good teaching points in there for parents who prefer to have productive TV viewing time.",1381708800,,185,4.470588235294118
5632411,4,B00BJ0RERM,I was surprised how funny and clean this movie was. It was great for the little ones in the family to also see and enjoy with the older kids. I recommend it.,1381708800,,157,3.9375

I don't think they have mentioned it since the day we saw it. That being said, it is worth a few bucks.",1381708800,,195,3.6666666666666665

5632416,4,B00BJ0RERM,"This is a fun kids movie that both adults and children can enjoy.  It's your basic caveman family cartoon. I don't think Nicolas Cage's voice was appropriate for the voice of the father, but maybe that's just me.",1381708800,,212,4.578947368421052
5632417,5,B00BJ0RERM,Very funny for adults and children.... The constant talk of them dying was a little off putting but guess all the movies are like that!,1381708800,,135,4.44
5632418,4,B00BJ0RERM,"The Croods is a cute and comical animation. With insights into a world unseen by modern eyes. The cave dwellers resembled our first interpretations of Neanderthals, but at they end of the movie more positive insight was shown. To the more current theories of how neanderthals were smarter then what was first believed.",1381708800,,318,5.018867924528302

5632421,4,B00BJ0RERM,This was a great family movie ...my kids really enjoyed it ages 11 and 8... We give it Four Stars,1381708800,,97,3.9
5632422,4,B00BJ0RERM,"The further I watched the movie I liked the ""morals"" and commentary on how people can withdraw into as safe an environment and not face new Ideas. At the end the Croods were enjoying the new world they were living in.  As to the animals presented, no connections to wildlife in the stone age.",1381708800,,292,4.407407407407407
5632423,4,B00BJ0RERM,Movie whole family will enjoy. Great casting of characters makes it feel authentic and rich. One you'll want to watch again and again.,1381708800,,134,4.869565217391305

5632425,2,B00BJ0RERM,"The acting and animation were fine, but the script was paper-thin. The entire movie is just a series of visual and slapstick gags with an overlay of sappy music. At times it felt like I was watching a Saturday-morning cartoon or a direct-to-DVD show.",1381622400,2,250,4.704545454545454
5632426,3,B00BJ0RERM,"what I liked about it was how hard the story showed it was for cave people to get a meal. That said, they all were so healthy and got so little to eat, no idea how they survived. The dad's extremely cautious nature explains why they weren't eaten by other predators, but story didn't show them as successful enough hunters to maintain their body weight. Liked the dad, mother in law dynamic which I found believable.",1381622400,,416,4.4868421052631575
5632427,1,B00BJ0RERM,DVD worked but Blu-Ray won't load the movie. Want to replace the Blu-Ray only but Amazon does not offer that. Sent the DVD and toy to grandson in Texas and he is happy with that. This is the second item I have ordered from Amazon that I can do nothing about. I'll stop ordering on Amazon.,1381622400,3,288,4.160714285714286

5632439,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I bought this for my daughter and family in the UK for a present. It doesn't come out in the UK until December. The grandchildren don't know I'm sending it, they have been playing or have seen a Croods computer game, they love, so they are bound to like the movie.

I watched the movie first before sending, it was good, I really enjoyed it, but I don't think it's quite as good as the ""Tangled"" movie I sent a couple of years ago, they really loved that one. They've just bought a larger TV, it's going to look great on it. I'm waiting for my little TV to break down before I purchase a large screen TV. The colors and animation are fabulous.",1381622400,,643,4.185483870967742

5632472,3,B00BJ0RERM,"AS THE stars show, it is ok.  Had the potential of being so much better.  The Previews made the movie look so much better than it really was.

Good Luck America",1381449600,,160,4.096774193548387
5632473,4,B00BJ0RERM,This is a cute movie. Great for kids of all ages.  Nicolas Cage voice a draw for big kids too.,1381449600,,94,3.7
5632474,3,B00BJ0RERM,I have to sit through lots of kid movies. Some are mind numbing other are quite funny and engaging. This one was somewhere in the middle. Not painful but definitely not great.,1381449600,,175,4.5

Nothing offensive (except we don't like to say ""that sucks"" -- and the dad says ""sucky"" which I didn't like...but that's being extremely picky).

5632552,5,B00BJ0RERM,"The Croods (in eye popping 3D) Bowling for Movies Score: 239.625 of 300

On a cold, dark day in Houston, mid-summer, a dream was hatched - a dream of creating a way to organize a vast movie collection.  Oh sure, there are movie ""critics"" and manifold movie blogs and periodicals but these so called ""professionals"" often are out of touch with what I like to call ""The Average Dude"" - you know, your standard issue person on the street.  ""Hey,"" I thought, ""I'm just an average dude aaaaand I have way too much time on my hands aaaaaaand an unordinary number of movies at my finger-tips - literally hundreds and hundreds - and I was endowed with a natural proclivity towards gab.""  This brain flower blossom and bore the fruit which is Bowling for Movies.

Like a mad scientist in his lab, I sat down and created an entirely new system for ranking movies.  Utilizing a plastic spatula, I blended both modern and archaic technology in a synergetic explosion of quasi/pseudo-science which renders Hollywood magic down to a comprehensive (if not patentable) bowling score (which actually has nothing to do with bowling).  Should a movie be simple ok, not really good, not really bad it would receive a score of 108 of 300;  crest 192 of 300 and you've got a bona fidable GOOD movie; crack what I like to call The Hot 200 and you've got a real gem.

The Croods - We own the Blu Ray 3D, Blu Ray, DVD, Digital Copy combo pack (dude, that's like every version of the film imaginable, crazy huh?)

Synoptically Speaking - what's it about?
Nicolas Cage leads a star-studded voice cast as the over-protective caveman father Grug Crood in this beautifully rendered story about a family of cave-people who live life by a simple rule: Never be NOT safe.  When rebellious, and frankly quite selfish, daughter Eep (Emma Stone) hits that ""know it all"" stage the entire family's life gets turned upside-down.  Eep has a chance meeting with a ""modern"" human boy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who has a head full of `new' ideas and the ability to make fire... and naturally Eep thinks he's the best thing since sliced bread (which as I think of it probably should be the greatest thing before sliced bread on account of the prehistoric nature of the flick predating bread and therefore slicing of the bread by many millennium).  When tectonic plate drift set off sudden and ever-escalating natural disasters, the family is forced to leave the safety of the cave and set out, with Guy's help, across a strange and dangerous jungle full of every sort of fantastical animal one could imagine - absolutely outside of Grug's safety  zone.  Will the Crood family make it to safety?  Will Guy and Eep's relationship blossom while under her father's watchful eye?  Will Grug's cantankerous mother-in-law outlive them all?  Can a caveman embrace new ideas to save his growing family?  All these questions and more are answered in beautifully creative and masterfully animated 3D.

All things considered I have to claim conscious interference when talking about the latest DreamWorks offering - I'm not too far off from a caveman myself and Little Miss Movie Dude's 14th birthday is like TOMORROW so I found myself identifying with Grug...  my little baby girl is growing up and testing her wings (which naturally means testing my patience) and, clich of clichs, I'm wondering where the time has gone.  I assumed it would be a good movie, DreamWorks has been moving towards high caliber stories for a while - and although they fall just short of Pixar's emotional impact level - this movie had surprising depth of character and more heart than I've seen this side of Disney/Pixar's ""Up"".  There is a rather delicate story here of the love shared between father and daughter and the literal evolution of Grug's role in Eep's life.  This subtle story is set during a period of climatic upheaval which lends itself to many funny scenes which is sure to keep younger audiences entertained.

Hey, Movie Dude - what a gem of a flick, what did you like most?
~  Wonderful coming of age story that gently moves a caveman to evolve to greater heights of understanding and acceptance
~ A great blending of pure cartoon animation with incredibly life-like, photo-realistic surroundings
~ A top notch soundtrack is a staple of any great film but I have to take my hat off to DreamWorks for pulling together a marching band and other instrumental songs to punctuate the emotional soul of this film

Ok Movie Dude, what did you detract points for?
~ I loved the film but it shared a rebellious frizzy haired girl who won't listen to her parents type quality with Disney's Brave - I won't go as far as say it's a Brave clone but I'll say this theme has been used (and used, and used) before

Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.",1381190400,,5232,4.639219934994583

Is fun, entertainment and heart warming too.
I will recomended for the whole family!",1381190400,,130,4.458333333333333
5632554,5,B00BJ0RERM,My grand children enjoy watching this together! Good movie for re watching on a wet and cold winter night!  FUN!,1381190400,,112,4.6
5632555,4,B00BJ0RERM,This is a great movie for kids and the entire movie. My 5 yo son loved the Belt toy (sloth).,1381190400,,92,3.65
5632556,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Eep (Emma Stone) and her family are the classic cave people. They grunt when they get mad, they have never seen fire, and they hunt with their bare hands. They are stuck in a cave by their family leader, Husband and Father, Grug, (Nicolas Cage). The reason Grug is having his family stay in the cave is to keep them safe and away from harm. One night Eep, the oldest daughter, lets curiosity get the best of her and finds out that the earth is starting to end and they have to find higher ground to survive. Will they accept the challenge or will they keep hiding in their cave.

I really like this film. It's very funny and keeps me laughing at the different situations and scenes. I feel a wide range of emotions as I go from hysterically laughing to a little crying. I absolutely love the 3D animation. It's vivid in colors with the scenes of the landscape, nature and animals in great depth. This is such a fantastic plot and I really like the characters. My favorite character is Eep because she is very brave, curious and just wants a real life. My favorite scene is when Eep is introducing herself and her family from her point of view. I like how she is telling the viewers how life is like for them.

""The Croods"" is rated PG with Kirk De Micco (Space Chimps) and Chris Sanders (How to Train your Dragon) directing it. It also stars the voice talents of Ryan Reynolds (Guy), Catherine Keener (Ugga), Cloris Leachman (Gran) and Clark Duke (Thunk). This is DreamWorks 1st animated film about a family going trough and dealing with changes.

A big message in this film is that change is not always a bad thing. In addition, it's always good to listen to your parents because they know what's best for you.

I recommend ""The Croods"" for ages 6 to 15 but adults will also enjoy it too.

I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. It has great detail in the animation and makes me laugh a lot.

It is so thin and it is suppose to hold a dvd and a blu-ray? The first combo pack... I opened it and the cae has popped open-it wasn't taped shut like a normal movie case...  the blu-ray was cracked. I returned it and exchanged it for a different one. I opened the second one and again... the case was open but at least the discs were okay.

5632656,2,B00BJ0RERM,"My recommendation is to just watch the trailer a couple times instead of watching the movie. It has all the funniest parts in it.

This movie felt very manufactured and unoriginal to me. It's like the ""cool guy"" from How to Train Your Dragon in an Avatar-esque world except that he is only a prop for this odd family that is obsessed with caves and being afraid of stuff. I think the main character is the sister but I'm not sure. Add to the mix a lot of big facial expressions and voice inflection to really fit that animated movie stereotype.

They did try to make it meaningful. The moral of the story is that every sunrise can mean a better day than the last and it ties the beginning and end together but again feels manufactured, like that's something a good story should have so let's make up a moral to tie it all together, or something.

Sorry Dreamworks, not very good.

Many of the creatures are absurd enough to lighten up the story and are well placed.

Watched as an instant video, but this may be the first purchase I make that is not physical media (I may still purchase the DVD too, but with younger ones it's safer to have a backup in the cloud when you find yourself handed scratched dvd's with tears with questions like "" why doesn't it play?"").",1381017600,,698,4.658536585365853

The positive role between father and daughter was also a surprise. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with this movie. I was smiling the entire time.

I thought this movie was great.  Funny for kids and adults alike, there were no cheesy parts, yet it captured the attention of my 3 and 8 year old, as well as myself!  Great animation and facial expressions.  Nicholas Cage is the perfect actor to play the idea-less cave man.  I just kept saying to myself, ""That was a really good movie!"".  So much so that I felt the need to give it a good review.  :)",1380931200,,566,4.175925925925926

It's up to you, but it's is it worth the money right now for me if I can find it cheap around five dollars or so, then all would buy it, but the asking price right now know I will buy it just ain't worth it. I me a Few cute  scenes in it. Don't get me wrong. So if I have to give this a rating out of five stars 3 1/2 stars.",1380931200,,459,3.5

What really upset me was  that I ordered it thinking I may get it a little earlier, I didn't and cheaper, I didn't. The movie was being sold at the stores before I received mine and $4.00 cheaper.",1380844800,,299,4.067796610169491
5632721,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I watched this by myself and actually laughed out loud a few times. It's very entertaining throughout. Epic landscapes, really beautiful movie.

The family is barbaric and ignorant and their belief system reflects this. Fear of the unknown and pridefully simple-minded is their way but instead of keeping them safe as it has for so long now it will be their downfall. They meet an innovative character. A real charmer who has skills and intelligence. Their reaction to him at times is absolutely hilarious. The family fire scene is a riot and the one where the boy and girl meet is lovely.

The ""message"" is very naturally weaved into the story. It basically IS the story. In general it observes Man's key survival traits - intelligence and ideas but being curious is a necessity as well. Resentment and jealousy are pitiful traits and this movie deals with them by demanding a change of ways. It's about survival in this case so no time to feel sorry for someone feeling inadequate and petty. It's about RISING to the occasion and boy does he in the most grand fashion.

I can't think of another animated film that I enjoyed as much as this one. I would say Finding Nemo and Monsters vs Aliens are the only other ones that I really liked.",1380844800,,1239,4.622727272727273

5632761,3,B00BJ0RERM,"In DreamWorks ""The Croods"" a prehistoric family embarks on the very first road trip ever!  After their cave is destroyed, they must go in search of a new home - with the help of a handsome stranger named Guy.

Who are The Croods?  They are Dreamwork's rendition of a caveman family - the father, Grug, is always warning his family about the dangers outside.  He wants to keep his family safe - ""in the dark.""

Grug has a wife and a restless teenage daughter named Eep - there is also a not-too-bright overweight son, a strange growling baby, and a crusty grandma character.  Then along comes Guy - a handsome stranger (with a cute pet named Belt) who lives for adventure and ""following the sun.""  Eep is in love.  Grug is none too thrilled.

Guy leads the Crood family through a very colorful prehistoric CG landscape filled with all sorts of neon bright fanciful and furry critters that happen to have very large teeth.  Adventures ensues - despite the fact Grug is completely against them ensuing.  Will the family find a new home?  Or will they get eaten up by one of the many weird surrealistic creatures?  Will Grug and Guy ever get along?  After all, Guy is so different.  He uses his brain and comes up with brand new ideas.  Grug believes in just relying on his brawn.  Well, to find the answers to these questions, you'll just have to watch the movie and see.

The visuals in this movie are fantastic.  Lots of interesting and colorful ""eye candy"" to keep little kids transfixed.  However.....and it's a BIG however...I feel the story leaves a bit to be desired - from an adult standpoint.  Like I said, little kids will no doubt love it.  But the plot is just so clich and typical....the humor is so lazy and un-clever it makes you want to yawn (think:  Hotel Transylvania).  I think I chuckled twice during the whole film - and I thought it was going to be an outrageous comedy!!!  Not so.  The Croods is not clever and sophisticated like the Shrek movies.  It is even less sophisticated than the Ice Age movies, in my opinion.

The characters are not very unique - you never really warm up to any of them, like you do with Shrek or Donkey or even Sid the Sloth.  Eep as the teenage daughter is so woefully predictable.  And what's with the weird hourglass figure and overly shapely legs?  Is that really necessary for a kid's movie?

Certain comments Grug makes about ""killing the grandma"" struck me as disturbing.  I know it's just supposed to be comedy, but still...

The thing that bothered me the most about the movie, is that it literally hits you over the head with too much sappy family ""I love you's""....it seemed forced.

Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the movie - as you can probably tell!  I recommend you see it once - just for the visuals...but maybe rent before buying.  Unless you have a child under 10 - then go ahead and purchase the movie.  They'll love it!",1380758400,2,2888,4.503861003861004
5632762,4,B00BJ0RERM,"I loved the graphics on this movie. I did like the subtle hints of more ""adult"" humor. My 2 year old and 6 year old boys loved this movie! And the good thing is mommy and daddy didn't fall asleep while watching!",1380758400,,211,4.0476190476190474

5632767,5,B00BJ0RERM,"My family loved this movie! It was hilarious and who would not love an overbearing father and a monkey belt that talks (in his own way). The story was fun and touching and has some great messages to share about family in general. I did not know what to expect from the movie as I did not see it in the theater but I have to say that now after seeing it here on Blu-ray, I wish that I had seen it on the big screen. One of the other things that I enjoyed was that the movie was still geared toward kids, and not specifically adults with kids as ancillary (as many cartoons are today). Overall, this was a great movie that all families should watch together and everyone in general should watch for the fun that it will provide and the smiles that will last long into the future!

 no juvenile jokes or stupid characters to keep the kiddies in their seats. It was very sophisticated and kept me enthralled. I am 48 years old, by the way. I didn't need an excuse to watch it. The Amazon trailer was very intriging. I am so glad I watched it.",1380585600,,479,4.139784946236559

5632816,4,B00BJ0RERM,The film is a very clever and funny look at family interactions but mainly looks at the father daughter relationship and her coming of age.  There are many inside jokes based on Cro-Magon/Neanderthal interactions with an upbeat take on the topic.  There is a sub plot regarding discovery and experimentation which works for me.  The animation is gorgeous,1380412800,2,354,5.068965517241379

5632905,3,B00BJ0RERM,"Seeing as how this movie has received four and five stars for the most part, I feel it my responsibility to give my differing opinion. This was not one of the best cartoons of the year, which to me, five stars would imply. I did not like the Ice Age movies very much. That being said, I think this was equal or slightly better than those movies. It wasn't amazing, but it was enjoyable enough. My kids didn't love it either. The main girl wasn't super likeable in my opinion. It's not a good thing when you prefer the supporting characters. And whenever a producer attempts a long journey throughout the movie, they risk the viewer getting antsy and even bored. So it did drag out for me a bit. But it still had a bit of comedy and even heart with these barbaric humans. The Croods was a, ""meh"" movie for me. But you may love it.",1379894400,,829,4.253164556962025

The way the artists created the creatures, different geography, different regions was five stars!  The colors, imagination and visuals are pushing the animation limit for this season.

5632945,5,B00BJ0RERM,"Well, I want to write a review, but I'm afraid you will think I'm a Dreamworks plant, or something.

This movie makes me hate watching movies with my kids...for the first 10 run-throughs. The reason? My kids won't stop repeating the lines and laughing and saying, ""Dad, did you hear that part when he said 'blah blah blah'?""

This movies has it all. It is funny. It is inventive. It has cave drawings. It has unrefined, crazy, cave-man behavior. It has touching, heart-warming moments. It has action. It has death-defying feats. It has monsters, but interestingly no real villains...except the subtle Earth-Apocalypse hint. It has weird creatures and never-before-seen extinct species. It has politically-correct free/wild pets. It has family dinners, for the old fashioned, but less-than-perfect manners for the non-prude. It has dreams. It has in-laws (great for laughs). It has little side jokes and stories that make kids laugh, but they aren't stupid or simiple, so adults laugh too. (Kind of like Shrek: intelligent humor for adults wrapped in silly stuff for the kids = cha-ching!) I have watched it 3 times now to catch all the quick one-liners that I missed or forgot. You'll never guess how it ends because it never gives away the plot like most movies do. It is very fast paced. There are enough jokes and funny comments to fill 3 movies. You literally can't catch it all and savor the ""funny"" in just one viewing.

Just good, relaxing fun for all ages. If you like movies, you'll like this one...",1379376000,91,1508,4.8599221789883265
5632946,4,B00BJ0RERM,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

Actually, the eponymous family in Dreamworks' ""The Croods"" doesn't really have all that much in common with the Flintstones.  For example, they don't have the Flintstones' primitive technological conveniences like the Flintmobile.  The Croods don't even have primitive weapons like spears and clubs, and sometimes they even run on all fours like gorillas or chimpanzees.  What's worse, they live in an otherworldly, dangerous prehistoric environment that makes ""Jumanji"" look like a petting zoo.  Therefore, in a way, you really can't blame burly Crood father/leader Grug (voice of Nicolas Cage) for being maniacally preoccupied with keeping his family safe.

This bunch of pre-Neanderthals - Grug's wife Ugga (voice of Catherine Keener), slow-witted and klutzy middle son Thunk (Clark Duke), fierce and animalistic toddler daughter Sandy (voice of Randy Thom), caustic Gran (voice of Cloris Leachman), and especially independent-minded elder daughter Eep (voice of Emma Stone) - are all agile, swift and strong fighters.  Even so, the Croods are so cautious and fearful that they venture out into the wild only long enough to forage for food (as in the energetic keep-away/football game they play with a wild bird-type to capture its egg toward the film's start).  Then, it's off to the safety of the cave, with a boulder door to keep the beasts out.  Following Grug's motto of ""Life is fear, all the time"", the family even sleeps curled up in a ball for mutual safety.  Except for teenage daughter Eep, who increasingly resents her family's lack of daring, curiosity, and eagerness to explore and learn.

One night, breaking curfew, Eep literally runs into a good-looking Cro-Magnon type named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and his all-purpose miniature sloth Belt (voice of Chris Sanders). Though somewhat inferior to Eep in power and athletic prowess, Guy is inventive, self-reliant, and keen on learning new things.  All of Guy's qualities attract Eep to him, although Guy is a bit put-off by Eep's rough and yes, crude, manner.  But Guy really doesn't have a choice; Eep brings Guy to meet the fam, who manage to appall Guy even more.  Grug is equally unimpressed and a bit wary of Guy in turn, not only because of a budding relationship with Eep, but also because Guy's intelligent and adventuresome boldness reflects badly on Grug's ignorant timidity. Taken aback, Guy at first tries to leave.

But natural, seismic upheavals and the terrain change caused by Pangea's splintering force Guy and the Croods to work together to cross the treacherous landscape to find a new home.  Can Guy's ideas and experience coupled with the Croods' brawn and agility get them through?  Can Grug surmount his shortcomings to help his family get through?  Will Grug realize - as Eep and Guy do - that courage as well as exposure to new ideas will help them not only survive, but also prosper?

""The Croods"" answers these questions with an unexpected blend of knockabout slapstick, sharp but not harsh verbal humor (not even the death fantasies Grug harbors for his mother-in law Gran), and relevant life lessons about survival, facing your inhibitions, maturing, using both strength and intelligence to move ahead and expand your horizons.  Therefore, ""The Croods"" will probably enthrall all family members, from fidgety toddlers to thoughtful, sophisticated adults, as they watch the Croods, especially stick-in-the-mud Grug, tackle the challenge of evolution in all senses of the word.",1378684800,,3509,5.209964412811388
5632947,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I cannot WAIT to watch it again. It's such an adorable movie but has a lot of elements that children can enjoy and learn from.

The CGI is pretty good and the story pace is enjoyable.

5632959,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I went to see this with my kids, with the only expectation that when it got too boring I could quietly slip on my iPod earbuds and listen to a book.  Instead, I laughed for over an hour.  The movie was fun, silly, heartwarming and a great way to spend a couple hours with my boys. We still talk about the movie.  It's not serious drama, but isn't meant to be.  In the same way, Monty Python isn't Shakespeare - there is a time and place for both.  Just grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy.  Note:  The M. Python reference is for silliness not borderline content - this movie has nothing bad, but still isn't ""sugary sweet"".  My elem school aged boys loved it.",1378166400,,656,4.192
5632960,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I really loved THE CROODS.  A family comedy/adventure from DreamWorks Animation, I had been waiting to see this one - the story of caveman Grug (Nicolas Cage) and his family, as they struggle to survive when both their home and way of life are change forever.

Grug has spent his entire parental life teaching his wife and children to be careful.  Change is BAD, darkness is to be feared, and you never ever stray too far from home.  This makes life a little difficult in their prehistoric desert landscape - even fighting for the smallest scraps of food is just that, a fight.  As hard as Grug has worked to maintain safety, he still constantly butts heads with his eldest daughter Eep (Emma Stone), whose natural sense of over-curiosity puts, Grug feels, the family at risk.  When Eep sneaks out of the cave one night and accidentally runs into the free spirit Guy (Ryan Reynolds), she is at first frightened but also very intrigued of him.  And when Guy informs her of the impending end of the world, Eep is as fearful as Grug is skeptical ... until the family's cave is destroyed (in a great action sequence), and the Croods are forced to leave their home and trek across the vast landscape (led by Guy, much to Grug's chagrin and terror), staying just ahead of the destruction as Guy steers them toward safety, and Grug becomes more and more jealous of Guy's taking over as the alpha male of the group.

'The Croods' is really funny, the humor leaning toward pratfalls and slapstick - but the film also has its share of tender/real moments that ring true.  The animation is stunning, the film a feast for the eyes, and by the end you will be rooting like hell for the clan all the way.  Nothing really new here, but the characters and story and humor and animation make it all feel fresh, funny and enjoyable, with positive messages for kids about sticking by your family and not being afraid to get out there and explore life and the world around you.

Yeah, I got sucked in - I loved it.",1377388800,2,1994,4.49584487534626
5632961,4,B00BJ0RERM,"`The Croods' tells a primitive story (in more than one sense) or a family of cavemen who are thrust from the normality of their lives (and by normal, I mean abnormal routine) into a world of the unknown when their cave is destroyed during `The End'.  The family consists of a caring mother, a dopey son, a savage baby daughter, a gross grandmother, a curious teenage girl name Eep and an overprotective father, Grug.  We are introduced to the family as they hunt for food (in the most comical of manners) and are rushed back into their cave, where they spend most of their days and nights, by the threat of anything new.  When Eep ventures off one night and meets another human, the family's life is forever changed and they begin to `live'.

As a whole, I rather enjoyed this.  It was pretty funny from start to finish, which is a plus with child centered animated films.  One thing that my daughter mentioned, and that I thought was pretty interesting, was that there is no villain here.  I really enjoyed this aspect of the film.  I'm so tired of these animated films with vicious enemies who fight against good until the death.  Why are we teaching these kinds of things to our children?  Breaking the mold, `The Croods' has the elements (and some wildlife) as the only enemy and eventually uses those very things for good.  Even Grug's constant rambling about certain death is played up for laughs.  The development of character is a tad formulaic and yet it really works as a whole.

I do take issue with some lazy aspects of the film.  The stereotyping of the caveman himself was somewhat lazy, especially when you have this massive caveman who, as he points out, eats maybe a drip of egg a week.  He should have been skrawney and malnourished but he was unbelievably strong and quite fat.  The treatment of days was also kind of bizarre.  The family would wake up and find and egg and next thing you know it is nighttime and they are racing to hide from some kind of predator.  The conceptualized prehistoric era was fun, if not a tad `Avatar' like, and it certainly popped, so that was nice.

In the end I give it a B-.  My family enjoyed this.  Oh, and this was easily Nicolas Cage's finest performance in a decade or two.",1376524800,3,2232,4.488833746898263

It reminds me of a Avatar for kids, with it's stunning visuals, sound, and music. I saw it and 3D and felt it was not tacky or over used. It just enhanced the movie just that much more. The voice acting was great, but nothing special. Anyone could have played Eep and Eep's mom, but that is not saying they didn't fit. There are some monuments in this movie that will warm your heart and then break it. I really enjoyed this movie, bit it is not for everyone. If you take your kids or don't you would still enjoy it.

Who knows how many times we will watch it before we finally slow but I can tell you it will be a lot.

I really feel like to get the most enjoyment you have to have kids to truly appreciate many of the jokes.  Now mind you, you can enjoy the movie even if you don't have kids but I have noticed that a lot of the reviews that call this movie sub-par are without children.

Yes the cavemen are predictable but hey who cares.  It was a fun, enjoyable, happy movie.  I liked this movie from the beginning to the end.  And probably my favorite part of the movie is how they sleep in a big ball.",1372896000,2,881,3.8555555555555556

Actually everyone in the theater watching it was cracking up, it has a ton of hilarious lines from every character in it. Best part, it was consistently funny throughout, not just in a couple of scenes, with jokes geared for all ages. A very creative story too with the family obviously (The Croods) who are the last surviving cavemen family. Their curious teenage daughter Eep runs into a more humanly ""evolved"" guy, actually whose name is Guy who lets her know the world is coming to an end. The Croods are afraid of life where animals hunt you at all times, but when their cave is destroyed in an earthquake, they are forced on a journey with their survival guide, Guy to stay alive. A MUST WATCH ANIMATED MOVIE!!!! Best one I've seen in a long time! The writer/director -Chris Sanders, who made Lilo & Stitch & also How To Train Your Dragon did this one!

Some of the humor is directed at the adults in the audience, as when the patriarch of the family would like to rid the unit of his mother-in-law.

And that chase scene with the egg was hilarious - ""Release the baby!""

In many ways, though, it came across as predictable. Over-protective parents, teenage daughter who finds a really nice boy, family rapprochement in the end. You know, the usual.

This time, the family appeared to be Neandertals (the girl had shoulders on her like a blacksmith) and the really nice boy might have been a more modern human type. There's a nice intersection with recent science there: modern humans apparently interbred with Neandertals, and there was every indication of some breeding in the young couple's future. Also, the girl (named Eep) had red hair, and at least some Neandertals are known from DNA analysis to have had red hair.

Other than those few points, however, I found this utterly forgettable. I won't ask for those two hours of my life back, but I can't think of a reason to see it again.

5632990,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I must say this animated feature film really tugs on your heart strings. It's about a family, albeit in a prehistoric setting, that is normal. An over protective father, a not-so-smart teenage brother, a baby sister with temper issues, a teenage daughter who can't express her own identity, a cranky mother-in-law and the mother trying to keep them all together. This is Dreamworks' ""The Croods"".

Directors Kirk Di Micco (Spacechimps) and Chris Sanders (How to Train Your Dragon) teamed up with Monty Python alumni John Cleese (A Fish Called Wanda, Harry Potter) to also co-write this wonderful story. It is filled with imagination, color, heart and lots and lots of humor.

Nicolas Cage  (National Treasure, Face Off) plays the father Grug and is having a hard keeping his family happy. His main mission is to protect them by staying in a cave and fearing everything all the time everywhere to stay alive. His daughter Eep, voiced by Emma Stone (The Help, The Amazing Spider-Man), is trying learn more about her prehistoric world she lives in. She loves color, nature, exploring and so much more. Her brother Thunk, voiced by Clark Duke (The Office, Kick-Ass), is not much more intelligent than a rock and certainly prevents his sister from letting her family know the world outside is not all fear and danger. Why, because Thunk is a walking disaster.

Now throw in the mother whose main concern is keeping the peace in the family. The father-daughter relationship is maturing and changing and it seems to be driving the family apart with their different world views - albeit it is 50 million years ago. The mother is Ugga who is compassionately voiced by Catherine Keener (40 Year Old Virgin, Into The Wild) who has a tough job playing the family referee. Now enter her mother Gran, voiced by Cloris Leachman, who adds a whole other level of comedy and compassion to the mix. She hates the dad (so it may seem) and the dad hates her (so it may seem). It is a typical mother-in-law family relationship and boy do you see it, hear it and the adults will have the most fun watching these two interact because of the very funny real humor they add.

Its Eep who loves exploration and one day she ventures out and meets a young guy named Guy, voiced by Ryan Reynolds (The Green Lantern, The Proposal) who teaches her that there is color and amazing interesting things out in the world they live it. He also knows that they must travel away quickly to run from their environment which is changing and evolving due to the volcanic shifts the Earth is making. It's a fantasy, sci-fi premise that they took on a humanizing, if in a fun and fanciful way. Oh did I mention that one of the funniest characters is belt that Guy wears? It's hysterical!

What surprised me most was the amazing heart this film has. Not only is it hysterically funny with the imaginative prehistoric creatures they've created, but the relationships of the family are real. You'll feel for each of them. You'll laugh out loud several times. Most amazingly you'll be touched by their actions and you might even shed a happy tear or two or three.

Alan Silvestri (Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit) did an amazing score for the films and the kids will love the colors, action and creatures. The adults will love the story, relationships and the very clever humor that is sprinkled throughout the movie. You got to see this one if you love animated films  Check out Dreamworks ""The Croods""  with all your friends and especially your family.",1366761600,5,3517,4.705691056910569
5632991,1,B00BJ0RERM,"At some point during the pre-production of The Croods, someone had to have said, ""All right, we've got a large male caveman character, who performance mostly involves grunts and yelling loudly.  Who do we cast?""  At some point, someone suggested Nicholas Cage.  There's a joke here, but it's so obvious I'm not going to bother making it.

In all fairness to Cage, his brand of overacting is perfectly suited to this cartoon.  The Croods problems lie with the film itself - it's simply boring.  Despite some amazing animation, and a talented group of voice actors, it meanders as purposelessly as the Cro-Magnon's in the starring roles.
The Croods are the last cavemen in their world, surviving only by following their credo, ""Never try anything new"", the irony of which seems to be lost on Hollywood.  By day, they attempt to scrounge food up from whatever source they can, and hide in their cave by night.  Eep, played by the talented Emma Stone, is sick of this lifestyle, and sneaks out at night, meeting the intelligent human Guy.  Guy plans on high-tailing it out of the gorge, as the world is evidently ending, rather spectacularly and for no particular reason.

While father figure Grug (played by Cage) is initially against the idea of escape, a couple landslides is enough to change his mind.  According to Guy, a distant mountain represents safety from the impending volcano-landslide-flood apocalypse, so he and the family set off in that direction, with a jungle full of weird creatures the only thing in between them and survival.  The creature design is competent, but often seems a bit too garish compared to the often stark beauty of the prehistoric world's landscapes.  If Jurassic Park has starred large cartoon chickens instead of dinosaurs, it would have quite closely resembled The Croods.

Unlike other movies of its persuasion - Ice Age comes to mind - The Croods resembles more of a series of vignettes than an actual plot.  The invention of shoes, an encounter with swarms of birds that eat like piranha, tar pits - it's all there, but not much of it really ends up mattering.  It's a loud movie rather than a truly funny one, which makes it clear the young audience it's targeting.  If you're older than 8, The Croods is not for you.  Those caveman toys that those 8-year-olds are going to expect you to buy them, however, are.",1366588800,20,2353,4.79652605459057

5632993,5,B00BJ0RERM,"This is an animated tale of a teen girl and her natural desire to explore the world and the angst that it causes the father who wants to keep the family safe in a cave...in this case it is not a metaphor. Emma Stone was perfect for our on screen teen girl Eep, complete with her signature crackling voice. The world around them is falling apart and their only chance for survival is to follow the new Guy (Ryan Reynolds) to the objection of Grug (Nicolas Cage).

In spite of what sounds like an adult theme, it is aimed at the kids. The comedy is slapstick and simple jokes. The animals are wildly colorful so as to not be frightening as they chase humans. As an adult I didn't find the film boring, yet its lack of depth allowed me to have frequent breaks and not miss any plot points. Eep provides girls with a positive role model, something that is finally becoming the norm in these animated sagas.

Cloris Leachman played the voice of Gran, most likely because Betty White was too busy playing football. Great film for the kids, so-so for adults.",1365292800,,1051,4.412371134020619

5632996,4,B00BJ0RERM,"If The Croods has a familiar feel to it, it's because it deals with familiar themes - coming of age, fish-out-of-water experiences, confronting one's fears, and of course, the most familiar theme of all, family. That said, there's a lot to be said for the ways in which The Croods takes on these themes. The animation is beautifully done, the voice cast highly talented, and, unlike most other 3D films, the 3D is put to good use here, both of which should not be surprising when you consider that a lot of the same talent that made How To Train Your Dragon, one of the best 3D animated films ever made, was also behind the making of The Croods.

Set somewhere in an imagined prehistoric past, the film starts with a pelt-wearing girl named Eep (engagingly voiced by Emma Stone), talking about her family of cave-dwellers living deep in a rocky canyon, who apparently survive by adhering to the strict rules of the head of the family, her over-protective, over-cautious and over-bearing father Grug (Nicolas Cage), the number one rule being 'Never leave the cave!' Back in their cave, Grug is telling a story to the rest of the family - wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), younger daughter Sandy (Randy Thom), son Thunk (Clark Duke), and mother-in-law (the inimitable Cloris Leachman) - using a prop that represents Eep and her curious nature. None too subtly, Grug uses his story - and the unfortunate prop - to warn the family that curiosity, exploration and 'new things' are all threats to their survival and therefore to be avoided at all costs. While the rest of the family are appropriately chastened by Grug's bluntly cautionary tale, it only irritates Eep who longs to see what lies beyond their cave.  And particularly above their cave, where a sliver of blue sky beckons. So when night comes and the rest of the family falls asleep, Eep decides to ignore her father's advice and she leaves the cave.

While she's out exploring, Eep unexpectedly meets another another human, a caveboy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) whose intelligence and adventurous nature are a refreshing change from her cautious risk-averse father. She becomes fascinated when Guy shows her fire for the first time and she immediately wants to learn more.  It also doesn't hurt that Guy is something of a prehistoric hottie who has also apparently invented fashion, aided by his pet/sidekick/accessory, a long-armed mini-sloth named Belt (voiced by Chris Sanders, who was also the voice for Stitch in Lilo & Stitch). Guy ends up telling Eep though about his belief that their world is reaching its 'end' and wants Eep to come with him, but Eep cannot forsake her family.  Before he leaves, Guy gives Eep a horn made from a conch shell which she can use to call him if she feels the need for help. Eep is then found by Grug who had been frantically searching for her, even though it meant leaving the safety and security of the cave. But just as they are returning home, an earthquake brings down the rock walls of the canyon they inhabit, destroying the cave.  Grug and the rest of the family are distraught, but Eep ventures to an opening in the rock walls that the earthquake has created, and there she discovers a new land just beyond, a land filled with lush brightly-colored vegetation and teeming with wildlife, at once beautiful and strange. And in some cases, it turns out, quite, quite dangerous.

Venturing reluctantly into this new world, Grug and Eep and the others must learn how to survive in it. And later, when they meet up with Guy, Grug has the additional unwelcome challenge of dealing with the threat (to his authority, anyway) of a younger male whom his daughter is obviously attracted to but who stands for everything he deems dangerous and to be avoided.

All of the characters are well done and distinctive, both in their look and in their voicing, but one of the things I particularly liked about the way Eep was drawn was that she actually has the kind of solid, athletic build it would take to engage in the kinds of activities she does - like climbing up rock walls unassisted. You have no trouble believing that she can do the things she does in the film.

If, as some people have noted, the quality of the story-telling in The Croods tends to be uneven in places, I think this is due to the film's rather convoluted production history, which is worth relating here. Originally, back in 2005, the film was intended to be a stop-motion animation film to be produced by Aardman Animations as part of a deal with DreamWorks Animation, working from a screenplay by John Cleese (yes, that John Cleese) and Kirk DeMicco, based on a short story called ""The Twits"" by Roald Dahl. Cleese and DeMicco reworked the script to fit a film idea DreamWorks had about two cavemen on the run, one an inventor-type while the other was suspicious of anything new.  But Aardman dropped out of the project in 2007, with the rights to the film reverting to DreamWorks. Chris Sanders, the director of Lilo & Stitch, was brought in by DreamWorks to direct the film, and began making significant rewrites to the script.  But then in September 2008, Sanders took over directing How to Train Your Dragon, which resulted in The Croods being put on the back-burner and its release date pushed back a year. In May 2009, DeMicco was brought back on as co-director, but further delays results in the release date being pushed by yet another year.

In the end, the story was something of a mixed result with Sanders and DeMicco as the primary influences. The best parts are clearly the work of Sanders, who not only wrote and directed both Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon but also worked as writer on notable films like Mulan, The Lion King, Aladdin and Beauty & the Beast. DeMicco, on the other hand, has a somewhat less stellar record consisting of films like Space Chimps, Racing Stripes and Quest for Camelot.  All things considered, it's remarkable that The Croods turned out as well as it did.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good story with engaging characters coupled with well-done animation where the 3D actually adds something to the feel of the movie.",1364515200,35,6149,4.713221601489758
5632997,1,B00BJ0RERM,"The Croods, as stated by many, is similar to Ice Age. That is an understatement. Dreamworks pretty much took Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Continental Drift, gave it a caveman theme instead of an icecap, and called it done. The characters are nothing original. The daughter is just another girl looking to change her fate (against her father's will), the father is the overprotective type, and Guy is just another adventurer. Talk about typical. I guess I could explain more, but you've already seen most of the plot in Ice Age and other movies. I will say this, a lot of the jokes were stupid and repeated. The father smiles when the grandmother mentions how she might die (expressing his hatred of her), and he does this throughout the movie. It is incredibly wrong, and when he does this for like the 5th time it gets really old. He even says it directly to her face. The baby is basically is a pet. Seriously, not like a pet... an actual pet. She growls, barks, shreds stuff, and pretty much was the opposite of funny. The visuals were average.

5633010,5,B00BJ0RERM,"It's a rough and tumble world for cave-dwelling Croods, especially as they fight for survival with daily violent tag-team matches just to snag a precious bird egg for breakfast.

Teenage Eep has blossomed into a curious young woman, but one of the main rules of her father, Grug, is to NOT be curious! In fact, his motto--pummeled into his brood's heads every night during storytime--is Fear is Good! Change is Bad! Never not be afraid!

But oh, a change is a comin'...in the form of cataclysmic weather and geographic upheaval.

When Eep sneaks out one night and meets a boy with fire--and ideas--Grug is furious. But when the Croodses cave is destroyed from seismic explosions, Grug soon realizes that his family needs something other than his talent for brute force to navigate unfamiliar territory. Cue testosteronic jealousy and jockeying for position...especially for a place in Eep's heart.

I don't want to give away any more of the plot, because The Croods is a special movie deserving of discovery...not play-by-play spoilers.

Let me just say that my husband, our 14 year old and I all LOVED this movie. Just loved it. The animation was stunning (especially all the cool plant and animal hybrids, not to mention the tropical scenes near water), the voice acting pitch-perfect and the script outstanding. I was surprised (probably shouldn't have been) when I saw John Cleese credited for co-writing the screenplay. The fact that there are several laugh-out-loud scenes are a testament to his comic genius.

Arguably the best part, though, is the HEART in this movie. Yes, I was actually crying during an incredible scene of paternal sacrifice. And I was relieved that it turned out OK. But some scenes are pretty intense, so The Croods earns its PG rating quite honestly.

After the movie was over and we got into the car, we were almost breathless. ""What a great movie!"" we kept saying. And, of course, we ""replayed"" the comedic scenes!

Seriously, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time--animated or otherwise. It's worth every penny to see in the theater, and we eagerly look forward to the DVD!",1364342400,10,2125,4.883333333333334
5633011,4,B00BJ0RERM,"""The Croods"" is one of those rare family films that is actually about a family.  Like so many of these animated flicks, the plot is supposedly about slapstick humor but is actually about the erosion of father figure Grug's (Nicolas Cage) authority as leader of the family unit.  Throw in a burgeoning romance between his eldest daughter Eep (Emma Stone) with stranger Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and you have...well you have the exact same plot of ""Hotel Transylvania."" Only better.

In the world of the Neanderthal, the Croods have to work hard to stay alive, a fact the film never shies away from.  A thrilling hunt sequence concludes with barely enough food to feed wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), baby Sandy (Randy Thom), son Thunk (Clark Duke) and arch-nemesis/mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman). Their brutal world involves spending most of the day hunting for eggs in the desert, and then cowering in a heap in a cave at night. In case it's not clear, ""The Croods"" demonstrates that Grug's over-protectiveness is well-earned by throwing, get this, a bearowl at the family over and over.  This is probably the closest gamers are ever going to see the Dungeons & Dragons equivalent of an owlbear on screen.

The true threat turns out to be both physical and existential: first in the inevitable separation of Pangea and then the arrival of a boy.  That boy happens to be homo sapien Guy and his pet sloth, Belt (Chris Sanders).  Guy has lots of interesting ideas like fire, puppets, and an apocalyptic vision that piques cute redhead Neanderthal Eep's interest in him.  You can guess where this is going, right?

When the apocalypse destroys the cavemen's cave, the family is forced into a land lush with vegetation, animals, food - and predators.  Lots and lots of predators. Where and when the Croods live is undefined, but it's a lot like ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" in that fauna is a mix of two or more animals: mousephants, piranhakeets, liyotes, jackrobats...you get the idea.  Grug discovers that his usual fight or flight tactics are not enough in this strange new world.  It will require flexibility, courage, and no small amount of imagination to reach their new home.

Along the way, ""The Croods"" isn't afraid to make fun of family dynamics. Grug routinely trains Thunk to take the lead in the hunt even though it's obvious Eep is the superior of just about every character on screen, including the physically weaker object of her affection, Guy.  Much of Grug's motivation is determined by the possibility that elderly Gran will finally kick the bucket. And Eep must learn how to separate herself from her family without losing her identity.  It's heavy stuff for a kid's film.

Most of the time the film rumbles along at a breakneck pace, careening from natural disasters to bizarre animals and back again.  But then there's a lot of talk about feelings, Grug threatens Guy, and Guy comes up with a solution involving genre-stretching puppets.  This happens not once, but twice, and during those talky moments my son fidgeted in his seat.

But then more explosions happen, the family rallies, and Belt shouts his trademark, ""Dun, dun, DUNNNN!"" Kids were repeating it in the audience, so mission accomplished.  Although it's not always a smooth ride, any film where the female protagonist is smarter, stronger, and more creative than her male counterparts is a great evolutionary step forward.",1364256000,12,3404,4.936842105263158

5633014,3,B00BJ0RERM,"I won't give away any spoilers, so don't worry about that. The Croods is the most visually stunning animated feature I think I have ever seen, and the 3D was equally superb, so 5 stars on that front. The voice-actors were very good as well and deserve to be recognized for their work. It was the writing behind the movie that left me bored and uninspired. Sort of like the Ice-Age series, The Croods is the story of a journey to a safe zone after the family of cavemen's ""natural habitat"" becomes unstable due to out-to-get-you seismic activity. Always with the earthquakes. However, unlike the Ice-Age franchise, The Croods lacked entertaining, plot-helping side stories. It's the family's journey and some pride issues with the clan's father figure (voiced by Nicholas Cage). That's pretty much it. Predictable. Yawn.

However, if you are primarily interested in this movie for your kids, I think it deserves at least 4 stars. There's plenty visual excitement and cuteness for younger viewers to enjoy, and there's no inappropriate humor or innuendo. There were a crew of 3 little kids in front of us at the theatre, I'd guess between ages 3-6, and they were mostly spell-bound for the entire motion picture. That says something good for a kids' movie.

5633016,3,B00BJ0RERM,"It seems like the animated films of yesterday were so much more tame compared to the animated films of today.  Yes, this a reference to the violence used in animated films, which typically goes overlooked and receives a free pass - because it's animated.  Apparently, animated violence must not translate the same way as authentic, realistic violence - because violence, whether it's slapstick or not, is clearly visible in the majority of modern animated films.  For instance, when one of the minions playfully hits one of his workmates in Despicable Me, it makes for a good laugh.  If you watch the teaser trailer for Despicable Me 2 (coming this summer), you'll notice one good punch at the end - and it's funny.  It's funny to adults, so children will find it equally as funny, but it's not exactly the proper message to be sending impressionable children.  DreamWorks' newest film, The Croods, also depicts much of the same playful, slapstick violence.

The Croods is the story about a family of cavemen living their lives constantly in fear of anything outside of their home - a cave.  Eep Crood (Emma Stone), the oldest of the Crood children, is in her adolescence and at an age where she wants to explore outside the safety zone of her family's cave.  However, her father, Grug (Nicholas Cage) is the fearful leader of the family that believes nothing outside of the cave is safe, and everything leads to death.  One night, Eep meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds) - an adolescent boy (roughly her same age) that tells her the end of the world is upon them and they should be preparing for it.  True enough, a series of unexplained earthquakes destroy the family's cave, forcing the entire family on the run - thrusting them on an adventure to find paradise, which they believe is called, ""tomorrow.""  Catherine Kenner, Clark Duke, and Cloris Leachman also provide voices for the film.

Much like an Ice Age film, The Croods begins with a less than humorous chase scene in which the family is trying to steal an egg from some turkey/flamingo creature (as a source of food).  It's instantly reminiscent of an all too familiar squirrel that works tirelessly to recover his nut, only to be constantly thwarted by various coincidental interruptions.  Several similar occurrences take place throughout the film, providing for only a few outstanding moments of humor - one of which includes The Crood's first interaction with fire, where essentially everything in sight ends up being lit on fire.

In the character development department, there are very few traits about these characters that haven't been established in other animated films.  Clearly, this is a film about family, featuring the father vs. daughter dynamic, not to mention the father dealing with losing her daughter to a male suitor.  As far as the supporting cast goes, they serve as nothing more than family clichs - including the irritating mother-in-law, a moronic fat son, and a baby that acts like the family dog.  And, while there are moments where these characters provide a few laughs (mostly via the previously mentioned slapstick violence), there's still very little that's memorable about them.

Early on, the film establishes itself as a theme driven film - depicting The Croods as fearful humans that lack any sensible knowledge about the world around them.  As the film progresses, the father and daughter clash about the nature of living life - with Eep arguing there has to be more to life than living a life filled with fear, hidden away in a cave, while Grug believes there shouldn't be a moment that doesn't include fear.  Over the course of the film, Grug becomes more of the focal point, since he is the one that has to learn to fight his fears, take chances in life, and accept certain risks.

Overall, The Croods is your average animated film, yet severely lacks memorability.  Nevertheless, the animation is sharp, colorful, and eye-pleasing, and easily contains enough light-heated adventure to sustain the attention of most children.

Overall Film Grade:  C-

5633017,5,B00BJ0RERM,"I saw this movie at a prescreening event at my local theater. I went in without any expectations as I hadn't seen any of the advertisements other than movie posters. When I left the theater, I was more than pleased. The version showed at the event was in 3D. I found it to be very exceptional as I noticed it the whole way through without getting lost in it. It enhanced my movie going experience with the amount of depth that was perceived. It literally felt like looking into a box.

This is a movie that succeeds as a family movie. In my opinion, there weren't any questionable content at any point in the film. My kids enjoyed it and asked if we could buy it when it comes out.

One thing I did notice about this movie is there many elements taken from the Ice Age franchise. I don't want to divulge too much as to include spoilers but when watching the movie, I recommend you matching this movie against each of the Ice Ages and you will see many similarities.

Overall, the movie had heart and a lot of funny moments. I wouldn't be surprised if it was followed by a sequel.",1363737600,54,1079,4.279411764705882
