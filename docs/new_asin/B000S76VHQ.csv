2883223,4,B000S76VHQ,"I  recommend Amongst white clouds. The movie was well made and the scenery was nice. There are Monks and a Nun practicing  in the remote mountains of China. The interviews are short but do offer some teachings and you get a brief look at how and where they live. This is most likely not going to be seen at the local multi screen theater. If you liked the book Road to Heaven by Bill Porter you will Probably like this  also.

This one is ok...  I was expecting to see some insight into their training...what do they do... didn't really dive into any of that.  It more about daily life in the places they live and living with nature with out outside help.

I found the other movies about the Zen monks / tibetan monks / Indian gurus much more interesting...

What I did find fascinating was the story behind the young man finding these monks.  That was a great story just flying to China and trying to find these people.  But once he got there it didn't deliver for me.  I'm an acupuncturist/energy worker/long time mediation and have to say that the other monk videos, the practitioners, had much more energetic presence.

I was expecting to hear or see actual translation of what the hermits were saying about the practice, yet there were very few lines translated.  I got more wisdom from watching Kung Fu Panda with my son, than I got from this movie. To say I was dissapointed, is an understatement.  I don' think I will ever watch this movie again.  I purchased this film, in part, to share with friends and family who were not familiar with Buddhism.

2883233,4,B000S76VHQ,"I have seen this movie at least five or six times and have enjoyed each viewing.  Some have complained about the inclusion of the filmmaker in the narrative, but I actually found his personal story interesting and entertaining.  In many ways, Burger seems to fit right in with the subject matter, and I found him a credible participant searching for genuine Buddhist spirituality.

Did he find it?  I'm not so sure.  The film lacks a certain intellectual catharsis--the ""aha"" moment really isn't there.  But perhaps that was intentional given the Buddhist propensity to live in the moment and find in the common the depths of salvation.  Certainly the monks in the film are rigorous ascetics. Living in rough terrain, ramshackle huts, well-worn clothes, and only the basics in food supplies, the monks are quite clearly what they purport to be--hermit monks.  They are certainly far removed from the tidy and refined monastics of Japanese and Korean zendos and the elegant and colorful Shaolin martial artists often depicted in other documentary films.  Though intellectual stimulation isn't the thrust of the film, a little more theory presented with the recluses' practice would have given this documentary some heft.  In the end, the monks seeking enlightenment could easily pass for eccentrics or the insane.  The ""why"" for their rigors, perhaps intentionally obscured, does not define them, and the viewer, though informed, is left puzzled by their efforts.

Beautiful scenery abounds. Nice musical touches give the film a personal feel.  The film has a very relaxing pace, which is probably why I continue to pop it in the player.  I would encourage the purchase.",1333238400,4,1669,5.133333333333334

The hermit monks live plainly and they show us personalities that are elegant, industrious and charming. Much Buddhist wisdom is offered. Multiple viewings are definitely recommended.

That said, this is not really a film ""about"" Buddhism; it's more like having tea with a succession of people who have dedicated themselves to the practice. The hermits, men and women of various ages, are depicted as individuals with personalities and pasts, and their practice as worthwhile.

A really fine document; makes you feel like you're hiking the trail yourself.

2883240,5,B000S76VHQ,"AMONGST WHITE CLOUDS ultimately impressed me. This is filmmaker/Zen Student Edward Burger's interview documentary with Ch'an (Zen) hermits living in seclusion in the Zhongnan Mountains of China in keeping with an ancient tradition of Chinese Buddhist hermitage. Most of them live alone or in small communities.

This tradition was thought to have been undone in Mao's Cultural Revolution, but it clearly survived that period of repression as it has since time immemorial.

Although the film starts out slowly and is a little tiresome to listen to (for non-Chinese speakers there are English subtitles to follow), it builds on itself as we are introduced to more and more of the monks and we become more immersed in their state of existence and way of thought.

From the 20-ish monk whose family came three times to kidnap him back to town to the 90 year old man who looks and acts like a sage of antiquity, we discover a wide divergence in the types of men and women who elect this life. At the same time, we find a striking similarity in the fact that most of these practitioners outright reject the hurly-burly of daily life in favor of quiet contemplation. Most of the monks do not live in caves. They live in well-built huts. Some have electric lights and running water. Some go to town (apparently within walking distance) regularly, while others refuse to leave their bucolic setting. Comparing and contrasting the views Burger gives us of the natural environment of the mountains with the mad rush of city life, it is not hard to understand why.

A previous reviewer states that the film is short on the ""Why"" of Zen practice:  WHY do they choose this life, WHY do they feel impelled toward Enlightenment? The answer is that there is no answer. Zen is like that. There is no ""Why"" to practice, merely the doing of it.

AMONGST WHITE CLOUDS answers no questions, it merely invites us to be amongst white clouds.",1295654400,8,1917,4.759036144578313

I have read many stories about the mountain monks of China. This film shows us first, that they really do exist and second the type of life style the have.

2883244,5,B000S76VHQ,"A meditative and quite absorbing look at hermit monks and nuns living on a remote mountain top in China, this film had me thinking throughout it ""I could do something like this.""
Of course, I almost certainly couldn't, but I actually think it is a testimony to the film-makers art that he can create such an intimate and unpretentious piece. The camera lingers on the hermits' faces and their simple dwellings, for the most part allowing the hermits to speak and tell their stories. Inspired in part by the wonderful book by Bill Porter (Road to Heaven - an absolute must-read), this is a fascinating insight into a way of life that is ancient and, I fear, endangered.
And what a charming bunch they are. A cheerful, chubby-faced old nun takes us up to a mountain spring while she siphons her drinking water, and a half-mad old monk admonishes a junior member of his community to speak up so that the camera crew can hear him better.
This is a film free from didacticism or any clumsy attempt to create some sort of artificial narrative. It is a simple journey amongst hermits, going from one to another as any pilgrim would, sitting at their feet and absorbing heir wisdom, at times profound and at times mundane.
I absolutely loved it, and found that watching this film was itself a meditative process, and exercise in contemplation. Wonderful stuff.",1272326400,5,1352,4.708860759493671
2883245,5,B000S76VHQ,"Most scholars assumed long ago that the Taoist/Buddhist hermit tradition in China had died out with the coming of the Communist regime. Renowned author and scholar John Blofeld always lamented this loss in his numerous books on the subjects.

Inspired by the ground breaking work of American Chan and Taoist author/scholar, Red Pine, ""Amongst White Clouds"" has given us solid film evidence that the hermit tradition is very much alive in China and had, in fact, never disappeared completely.

It was wonderful to see that the profiled hermits also included a woman.  Although the interview format is very basic, the spiritual nature of each recluse is readily perceived by the viewer.

Everything that is said during these short ""interviews"" with the Buddhist monks and nuns is almost worthy of writing down for future reference. Many of us have wanted to take off and find solitude, and the maker of this film has done just that. He packed it all up, moved to China, learned Chinese, and spent months tracking down the whereabouts of the elusive mountain hermits, and thats only the first 5 minutes of the film.

And i really could have totally done without the director, story-teller and center stage character (same person) also performing his own music in this film.

2883250,4,B000S76VHQ,"Film documents the lives of Buddhist monks and a nun living in seclusion on China's Zhongnan mountain range. Perspective is from the young American writer/director who stayed and studied with a wise-looking elderly monk for a few years on the mountain.

Filmmaker prudently stayed out of the way by keeping shots of himself to a minimum. Other than one sound bite at the beginning when he talks about being inspired by Bill Porter's book Road To Heaven to take on a similar journey of his own in search of present-day mountain hermits, we see him mostly in long shots walking along mountain paths. The primary narrative belongs to the hermits, and rightly so.

Poems of seclusion give us a romanticized image of hermits. But theirs is a hard and lonely life. The nun ate wild grass to survive when she first came to the mountain. Once every few days, she ran a thin plastic tube some distance up the craggy slope to a small well to funnel fresh water back to her hut.

It's unimportant whether the hermits are enlightened or not. They're probably in various stages of enlightenment. But one thing is for sure--most of them seem at peace with themselves and the natural world they inhabit, and they're not comfortable talking about enlightenment.

One of the last hermits featured is particularly reticent when asked about the subject. He wraps himself in a sheaf of deep silence, his eyes shining luminous on leathery skin.",1256688000,17,1423,4.795918367346939

One criticism I have is that it is short on sharing the wisdom of those featured in the film.  The reason could be that these monks are not necessarily wise, but have just chosen a way of life in pursuit of insight and wisdom.

2883257,4,B000S76VHQ,"Amongst White Clouds is an amazing document of the human adventure revealed not only in it's principle subject, but also in the making of the film.

First-time American director Edward A. Burger went to India in the late 90's to study Buddhism but found a greater connection to China. A book about Buddhist hermits pulled from an Indian monastery library led him north in search of an ancient way of life. Arriving in Beijing, he studied Chinese and began asking around for contacts that could introduce him to a mountain meditator. He ended up in the Zhongnan range of Shaanxi Province, where he lived and practiced for four years with one of these hermit masters. In 2003 he took a small film crew into the mountains to interview half a dozen of these practitioners and document their lives.

What comes across clearly in the interviews is that all of these men and one woman are serious about perfecting themselves, revealing their true natures and escaping from the suffering of mundane reality. What isn't always clear, and what many refuse to discuss, is their motivation for removing themselves from society and monastic communities. Besides footage of fetching water, working in the garden, or working on their huts, there is very little film of actual spiritual practice, no tantric rituals, no sitting zazen, no chanting of mantras. The recluses exhibit a few noticeable differences. Some live alone, while others reside in pairs or small groups. Some have electricity and running water. Others lead sparser lives, for example refusing to accept offerings of food. But still, we don't really get any idea of what kind of practices these hermits engage in - do they meditate most of the day? On what? Do they copy sutras? Recite mantras or the names of the Buddhas?

The most interesting questions are left unasked. How is the daily life of a mountain recluse - which consists in meditating, working around the hut, preparing the day's meals, washing, and perhaps a little study - different from the life of a village lay practitioner? What exactly is ""the practice"" and why is it necessary to isolate oneself from society in order to do it? Once realized, what then? Is there any obligation to return to society, or is ""practice"" an excuse to escape from the pressures of living with other people?

Despite the lack of probing questions, this remains a film worth watching for the light it shines on a little documented corner of the human experience.
