5371133,5,B009XICWA6,"I  enjoyed this video. Even though I had to read the englsh subtitles, I found this to be very fun to watch. I believe it is a Korean made film but I did not have any problem following what was going on. After watching Hearty Paws2 I looked for the first one but could not find it...still looking. Amazon, are you listening?",1445558400,,324,4.225806451612903
5371134,5,B009XICWA6,"Watched this mainly because of Song Joon-Ki...one of his first films.  It's hard to relate this young cutie to the tough young man in Nice Guy (awesome movie).  Great movie to watch with kids. It's sort of like a Home Alone, but with a smart mommy dog instead of a kid.  Couple of inventive maneuvers for the mom trying to save her pup.  Cute.  Enjoyable.",1443657600,,355,4.4

5371139,5,B009XICWA6,"excellent movie about the smartness and emotional nature of dogs. This is much better ending than Hearty Paws 1. Although some scenes and reactions of dog (Dolly) are over the top, but worth a one time watch with family!",1419811200,,220,4.666666666666667

5371142,4,B009XICWA6,"Get your tissues ready.  'Hearty Paws 2' is an emotional rollercoaster that is at times heartwarming, funny, sad and a real nail biter.  I would have given this film five stars except for an episode when the jewelry thieves encounter wild boars where the narrative lags a bit and some of their over the top antics.

If you like dogs and dog films, I would definitely recommend this Korean gem.  You will immediately loose your heart to Maeumee and her pups and be rooting for them all the way.",1360800000,5,493,4.50561797752809

8545048,3,B009XICWA6,"Sweet to see the mommy dog going to great lengths to save her pup. But at times I didn't like seeing how the thieves handled the pup, seemed a bit careless & rough at times.",1477353600,,173,3.9714285714285715

8545050,5,B009XICWA6,"Very cute. Of course, the actors are adorable, too! If you're a fan of Song Joong Ki, you must watch this movie. My child, who cannot read, also enjoyed this movie, with my paraphrasing and summarizing some, not all, of the subtitles.",1468540800,,234,4.595238095238095
8545051,1,B009XICWA6,"Terrible, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Made my daughter cry, and was obnoxious, implausible and stressful throughout.",1467417600,,130,5.238095238095238
8545052,5,B009XICWA6,"This movie was one of the best dog movies I have watched this year. It's a story about a mother dog's amazing affection to her puppy and devotion to her owner. Simple, funny, but very emotional. I strongly recommend this film, especially for all dog lovers.",1464998400,,257,4.608695652173913

8545056,3,B009XICWA6,"This movie is primarily aimed at a really young audience, as it is a mix between a Benji movie and Home Alone (the bumbling thieves are a carbon copy). There's not much for adults however, as the story line is very formulaic and contrived. That being said, the dog in the movie is very well trained, and the puppies couldn't be any cuter or fluffier. If you haven't seen the first movie, Hearty Paws (no relation to the plot or characters from this movie), it is a far superior film in every way and a must-watch.",1451692800,,513,4.354166666666667
