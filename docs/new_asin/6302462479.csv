7826209,5,6302462479,"This seven video set, hosted by Robert Conquest, provides an excellent history of the Soviet Union from its birth to the eve of its collapse. The videos contain lots of archival film footage and witness interviews to bring the Soviet Union's story to life. The era of the last Tsar, the Revolutions, the Civil War, the revolts, the economic plans, the terror, collectivization, the famine, the German invasion, and the Soviet Union in the Cold War are all covered in-depth.
I have only a couple of quibbles: The video totally ignores the Soviet invasion of Poland following the end of the Civil War, as well as the Soviet invasion of Finland following the signing of the Hitler-Stalin pact. Both events are important, given that many have tried to excuse post-WWII Soviet expansionism on their fear on invasion. (The Soviet's smaller neighbors were the ones who had reason to fear invasion.)",1027641600,2,891,4.946666666666666
