2701488,5,B000LBX7WG,Great way to shape.  Not too hard. She does tell you how to make it harder once you've mastered it. I normally don't like tape workouts but I do like this one. Reshape your body and GET SOME MUSCLE!,1408320000,2,198,4.076923076923077
2701489,4,B000LBX7WG,"When I was first starting out with kickboxing, I enjoyed Turbo Jam Cardio Party, but as I became more experienced, I moved on to other things. However, I recently had the opportunity to re-acquire a used copy of the Turbo Jam set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beachbody-Turbo-Jam-5-Workouts-Dvd/dp/B00H13JKWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beachbody Turbo Jam (5 Workouts Dvd)</a>) and decided to go for it.

TURBO SCULPT is the strength-focused workout from this set.  As with all of the other Turbo Jam workouts, instructor Chalene Johnson teaches in front of a large class.  Her usual modifiers, Mindy and Anna-Rita, perform the routine without weights.  The only equipment used is a single set of dumbbells (more than one set would be helpful, but Johnson does not allow time to switch weights) and a mat for the floorwork at the end.

This workout starts with an approximately 3-minute warm-up.  Johnson does moves such as slow lunges to the side, and she does incorporate the weights here, including some overhead presses.  She also briefly does a few dynamic stretches for the hip flexors and hamstrings.  Keeping hold of the weights, Johnson moves into the first series, a lunge-focused sequence (7.5 minutes).  She begins here by doing lunges with bicep curls, moves into lateral raises with leg abduction, curtsy with bicep curl, plie with lateral raise, and bicep curl with both rear leg curl and rear leg lift.  She then repeats the entire sequence of moves on the second side, finishing with additional overhead presses.  The second series (7 minutes) is a squat sequence.  Johnson first cues narrow, medium, wide, and plie squats, taking these into pulses.  Next, she performs triceps kickbacks, also adding pulses here.  There are also bent over rows,  additional plies with lateral raises, and additional lateral/front raises with one leg balance work.

The next standing series is 6.5 minutes long and involves traveling lunges.  Johnson takes the lunges forward, back, and then performs a tapping version.  After brief stretching the hamstrings, she alternates a one-arm row with a posterior delt row.  There is some VERY brief standing core work with a single weight, including a move called ""water toss"" and then a row; finally, Johnson does a pulsing lunge to the center and to either side.  Before moving to the floor, Johnson concludes the standing exercises with some inner thigh work (5 minutes).  She starts with plies, adding in variations and an overhead press.  The last move is a single leg squat variation.  With 7.5 minutes left, Johnson moves to the floor.  There is a short (1.5 minutes) sequence of chest flies followed by about 3 minutes of abs work (plank, side crunches).  Johnson concludes with a quick 2-minute stretch, bringing in the total time for the workout at just under 40 minutes.

This was a decent routine that did start getting my heart rate up a bit towards the end of the standing work.  I did think that it over-emphasized the shoulders--there are A LOT of shoulder presses!  I would have liked to have seen a bit more focus on the glutes/hamstrings.  Another negative was not being able to switch to different weights for different exercises (if you want to do this, you're probably going to have to pause the DVD).  In the end, if you are looking for a relatively short, full-body strength routine using light weights, this might be a good option.",1407024000,2,3440,5.123877917414721
2701490,5,B000LBX7WG,"This is the workout I keep coming back to. Works the arms but also abs, butt, thighs, etc. My arms definitely got more toned & defined after using it regularly. Chelene is informative & pays regular attention to form and safety, but she's also encouraging and sometimes goofy. It allows you to work nearly all muscle groups in 40 minutes, and I always feel it for at least 2 days afterwards. Highly recommend!",1394064000,,409,4.616438356164384
2701491,2,B000LBX7WG,"Well I really can't say that I didn't like it, because I never used it, because it was a gift for my daughter & she didn't want it. Well I can say that I LOVED the price that I paid for it.",1376784000,,189,3.5238095238095237

2701493,5,B000LBX7WG,This is a great weight training workout.  Only takes about 40 minutes.  Can use no hand weights up to 5 lbs or so.  Chalene is upbeat without being annoying like so many other workouts.  Will definitely make you sweat and you will feel the muscles you've worked long after you've finished working out.,1373846400,3,301,4.622641509433962

2701496,5,B000LBX7WG,"This is a great DVD that really gets your muscles burning with the same fun attitude of the Turbo Jam cardio workouts!  This 40 min routine is all muscle toning using weights ~ mostly standing ~ with some floorwork which includes chest work and core/abs, and ends with a final stretch. This is one great and fun sculpting workout!",1227398400,11,330,4.593220338983051
8160651,5,B000LBX7WG,"I have always loved this workout, but I misplaced my set in the move- so ordered the VHS b/c I have a dual machine and it is great. This workout is great because it engages the whole body for toning!",1509321600,,199,4.0

8160655,5,B000LBX7WG,I love this woman...she has the most positive vibe about her and she always looks like she is having so much fun how can anyone help but get hyped and jazzed.... I found this video tape at a garage sale and played it so much ...I had to get another one.... she sure makes working out fun,1429488000,,287,4.052631578947368
8160656,5,B000LBX7WG,love it! I had bought the turbo jam series and  I gave my turbo sculpt to a friend who needed to do exercise. this one I will not be giving or lending out!!!!,1422403200,,158,3.787878787878788
8160657,5,B000LBX7WG,"I had Turbo Jam way back when and eventually got rid of it. After several years, I tried Turbo Sculpt and found that I really enjoyed it. This is a workout I can do many times and still reach for it.

It is the strength workout from this set and actually moves at a moderate pace. This was surprising to me given Chalene's energy, but it works. I tried using two sets of weights with this workout, but it just doesn't work. The moves flow one into another and there isn't time to switch things around. Also, most of the moves are compound moves - something I enjoy, but some don't. There are several sections in the workout and there is a countdown timer that counts down both the section and the workout as a whole. Chalene is in front of a large group of background exercisers and there are two modifiers. They don't make many modifications though other than not using weights. Once in awhile, they'll do something that is a little less intense like doing regular lunges rather than curtsy lunges.

She hits the legs and glutes hard in this workout. Most of the sections are based on a lower body focus and then she throws in upper body moves to do with them. Her cueing isn't perfect since she cues with the moves and that sometimes puts me behind. Overall, I find Chalene incredibly motivating in this workout and it just flows for me. It is one that I am motivated to work on to try to improve my strength and stamina. You need to use light weights in it, but given my strength losses in the past year, that's where I am right now.",1420675200,2,1536,4.329861111111111
