8217127,5,B000V7HFNW,"As a teacher of English to Hispanic immigrant children, I have made excellent use of this DVD for years. My students love it, and contrary to what some may think, the Latin beat combined with a broad overview of basic English topics makes the DVD a winner! All of the RockNLearn tapes make learning fun and more accessible. Studies have shown that students learn faster when they are relaxed and enjoying the learning. This DVD is a great success at making the learning of English fun!",1507507200,,485,4.651162790697675
8217128,1,B000V7HFNW,"I purchased this DVD for my class of middle school English language learners. Thank God I watched it before they got their hands on it. It is BAD. First of all, the ""songs"" are not melodic AT ALL, and don't even rhyme really. It's basically a looped midi beat with slow phrases repeated over and over. ""My name is Juan... me llamo Juan.""

Then, there are the absolutely awful computer-generated graphics upon a trippy, swirling tie-dyed background. It is difficult to look at. The colors are so bright, and the editing is very cheap so the edges are sort of blurred.

Also, the females in the video could be from a paid telephone hotline. The look, the over-sexualized and throaty pronunciation... *sigh* Definitely not appropriate for a middle school class of hormonal teens and pre-teens. The random girl dancing at periodic intervals does NOT help.

I might like this video despite all the cheap and inappropriate craziness, but the fact is, it's just not educational or entertaining at all. It's definitely not a teaching tool. Don't watch it, just take my word for it. My original review title was, ""Are you SERIOUS???"" but I figured that wasn't informative enough.",1271376000,7,1170,4.869346733668341
