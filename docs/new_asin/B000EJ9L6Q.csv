The film itself is historically and emotionally interesting, although not a ""great"" movie.  The movie opens not in East or West Germany, but in Los Angeles of all places, first on Sunset Blvd (Angelyne billboard & KFC), and then to Griffith Park where cruising is going on.  I've read about the cruising in Griffith Park of past decades but I've never actually seen it in a movie, so even though it didn't show much it was still very interesting.

As you probably know (if you've gotten this far), the rest of this film was shot in East and West Berlin (as well as Prague).  The exteriors in East Germany were filmed secretly with a Super-8 camera, and there is no attempt to fill in the sound on a few lines of dialog (it could have been post-dubbed).  But also, the color of the Super-8 footage isn't good - perhaps East Germany did not allow you to bring in film, forcing you to buy film there (more western currency) and perhaps you even had to let them develop your film in East Germany and they'd mail it back to you if (and only if) they didn't find any prohibited images.  (I'm just speculating here).

Okay so this movie won't win any prizes for cinematography (the LA footage is also really shaky), but, both the love story and the story of circumstances were interesting.  Early in the story, the East-guy (amazing green eyes) tries to make a phonecall to his friend in the west.  He goes to an international hotel where a friend works at the desk.  Because it's an international hotel, it's possible to get a connection outside Berlin, although it takes several tries.  But, when our lover-boy reaches his friend in the West, he gets a surprise when someone else answers the phone - and he learns that his friend lives with three roommates.  He probably imagined that everyone in the west was a king with his own castle - reality in the west has its problems too.

Slight spoiler here: the ending, like many indie films, ends before the action really happens, because ""it would just be too expensive to film all that.""  Of course this also leaves us without knowing for sure what will happen.  Let me just say, the ending as presented is devastating and emotional.

The sex and nudity in this film, made for West German television, is almost tame enough for American television, but the naughtiest scene is a flashback to the East German's army barracks.  Apparently all East German men were conscripted in their youth, but with no wars going on, spent most of their time incredibly bored.

Again, for anyone who enjoys German cinema, this is a must-see addition to the catalogue.",1523836800,,2718,4.587991718426501
