6097627,5,B00GOYC3EW,I haven't seen these movies since I was just a little girl.. I was happy to see them again and share with the rest of my family.. thanks,1396828800,,136,3.892857142857143
6097628,5,B00GOYC3EW,"I've loved these movies for years, and have long hoped to see them in better quality.  This Blu-ray release is gorgeous.  The English audio track sounds better than ever and the Japanese track is beautiful too.  The only way this could be possibly be improved on would be a full high-budget cleanup of the dust and scratches from the master print.

If you've never seen the Unico movies, you're in for a treat.  These are great kids' movies from a quieter and less in-your-face time.  They're quirky and fun, highly stylized, lovely and cute, and full of beautiful music.  And personally, I still think Isle of Magic is wonderfully scary.

They follow the adventures of Unico, a ridiculously cute young unicorn who just wants to make friends.  Unfortunately the gods don't like the little guy.  To keep him safe, the West Wind is always carrying him away somewhere new.",1394496000,2,869,4.771812080536913
6097629,5,B00GOYC3EW,"I don't normally write reviews, but the Unico movies were a special part of my childhood. As I got older, I was able track down VHS copies and eventually a bootleg DVD. At the time these were the only option I had to watch the movies. Until now. This Blu-ray has a beautiful picture that blows away my previous copies. It seems that they went back to the original print/Japanese Print and it shows. Though there is some dust/scratches/noise in the image, trust me, these movies have never looked better. Well worth the purchase and a MUST buy for any Unico fan. It even includes the rare Unico short movie, which was never released outside of Japan. This alone makes the extra money for the Blu-ray worth it.  Share it with your own sons and daughters, they will love it. Enjoy.",1392163200,31,778,4.5177304964539005

6097632,5,B00GOYC3EW,"Unico was a half remembered movie from my childhood.  I was going to visit my aunt for the night and she asked what movie I wanted to watch.  Being all of 7 years old, I said 'The Unicorn movie' meaning The Last Unicorn.  My aunt brought Unico home.  It wasn't what I had wanted, but I loved it all the same.  Now I have a daughter of my own, and I've been collecting all the older movies/cartoons from my childhood that shaped my love of Fantasy.",1437782400,7,447,4.151162790697675

6097634,5,B00GOYC3EW,I looked all over for this movie set. I remember watching Unico  on vhs  as a child. I was exited to find it. But the fact that it was on Blu-ray  was an instant selling point for me. I still love it!,1435190400,2,200,3.7142857142857144
6097635,5,B00GOYC3EW,"I've been keeping track of several old movies from my younger years, and Unico was a must-have that I have always treasured. For a long time I thought I'd never be able to relive the candid magic of this series, but pleasantly surprised, I was wrong. For anyone who wants to relish in gritty fantasy that inspires hope and determination, especially for a starry-eyed child, this collection is crucial!!",1429920000,2,402,4.840579710144928
6097636,5,B00GOYC3EW,I still love this movie and now my children do as well.,1426723200,2,55,3.6666666666666665

6097638,5,B00GOYC3EW,"I first saw these movies on Disney Channel when I was a kid in the 80s. They were among my very favorite things to watch at that time along with Godzilla, Transformers, Ninja Turtles and so on. Since then I hadnt seen them again until my friend told me both Unico movies had recently been released on Blu-ray. It was a true pleasure to see them again. It really brought me back to a different time and place in my life. What a blast!

  The video quality is a mixed bag. The first movie looks beautifully re-mastered in spots but in others its grainy. The second movie looks awesome the whole way through. The sound is nice on both  good stereo from an era when sound quality on animated features was often suspect. All and all, I was left wondering if the first movie was mastered from a poor copy or if it hadnt been cared for as well as the second. The occasional grain may simply be the result of whatever encrypting process they used to format for Blu-ray. Still, it looked and sounded good.

  The extra features are standard fare for an older anime release. Included are the pre-release trailers for the movies and a promotional of some sort for the first one. The best extra included is the pilot for the Unico series that never took off. It is obviously older than the two movies and in it Unico looks quite a bit different from the later works. Still, it was nice to see as it was (I believe) the only other Unico animation ever created for television. All in all, if you want something cute and uplifting to watch with your kids or if you just want to reminisce about the things you watched as a kid, buy this movie. I paid about $20 for it and feel like I got a good price.",1399334400,11,1685,4.279874213836478
6097639,4,B00GOYC3EW,"I watched The Island of Magic probably around 5-6 years old on the Disney Channel a lot as a kid.  I even taped to VHS to watch many times later.  It's really sort of a scary movie for a kid, honestly.  But I think it's good to have stuff like that in your young memories.  It definitely doesn't sugar coat anything.  I have not watched the Fantastic Adventures yet but I will.  I watched half of TIOM so far and as far as video/audio goes, it's widescreen (never released before?) and a very good sharp transfer of animation with solid colors and lines.  Very impressed.  There are occasional edge discolorations and white dust, but nothing that detracts from the experience, especially considering the age and obscurity of this movie.  I'm very surprised it's in such good shape as it is.  The audio is clean stereo.  If you're a fan of either movie I'd say this is a no brainer purchase.",1399248000,,890,4.5

8625872,5,B00GOYC3EW,"This was my favorite childhood movie. My mom taped these off of the Disney channel, and I watched them until the tape wore out. Then I found some bootlegs online a while ago, and they were poorly made but the best I could do. I didn't ask for much from these, but they're amazing! Fantastic quality, and sound. So very happy that my daughter can fall in love with Unico too. If you're on the fence, go ahead and order these. Looked great on my 55"" hd tv!",1463356800,2,454,4.170454545454546
8625873,5,B00GOYC3EW,"I was watching an old dvd...and realized it didn't have the Unico story line I was looking for (the one with Toby).  I found this on Amazon, ordered it, received it the next day and watched it immediately with my nieces.  Great quality and fantastic service!",1462147200,,258,4.586956521739131
8625874,5,B00GOYC3EW,I never forgot this movie from my childhood. I was around 8 years when I used to watch it on the Disney Channel. My Blu-ray will arrive today and I will give it to my 8 year old son as a surprise. I already showed him some of the YouTube videos so he could get familiar with the characters and see how he would like it. He kept asking me a lot of questions about the movie with such interest in which he will shortly find the answers. Have a great day.,1460678400,2,452,3.9239130434782608
8625875,5,B00GOYC3EW,"'Unico' was one of the first experiences with Japanese animation I had as a kid. At the time, I didn't know any better, but it ultimately led me down the road of being a big fan of anime as a teenager. It took me a while to finally order this, but I'm really glad I did. Both films are honestly gorgeous and great examples of anime of its time period. This is especially so with 'Unico and the Island of Magic', which really shines in a lot of areas. The BD format makes these films shine and Discotek did a great job with the transfers. The plots of either film aren't the strongest, but are still enjoyable for all ages. Whether you are young or old, these are easy watches, and are a great way to spend an afternoon.",1459036800,2,719,4.179856115107913

8625877,5,B00GOYC3EW,Great childhood memories. Although many people have told me it's the nightmares of their childhood. I guess either my parents wanted to scare me or knew I loved unicorns and that unico was adorable.,1439596800,2,198,4.852941176470588
