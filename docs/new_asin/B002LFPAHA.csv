8372713,4,B002LFPAHA,"This volume of the Arts Magic series of Model Railroad videos emphasizes the HOW TO BUILD phase of layout construction. The program is not intended for the experienced cabinetmaker, but for the average railway enthusiast who already knows how to use a jigsaw, electric drill, screwdriver, soldering iron and other basic household tools.

The program begins with a father and son operating their model train on the floor, then explains why the hobby is so more enjoyable when elevated to a permanent home at tabletop height. Nearly one-third of the program is devoted to step-by-step construction of the ""baseboard"" construction (also known as ""benchwork"" in North America). After the supporting 4-foot by 8-foot table is completed, the trackplan is drawn on the surface and portions to be elevated are cut and raised, tracklaying, wiring the 15-volt electric connections and scenery development take up the remainder of the 45-minute video.

One exception that I take to the video is that the chipboard or particleboard used for the table top is much heavier than plywood or the modern foam bases used by North American modelers in the 21st Century. The video we are reviewing was filmed more than 20 years ago.

The first reviewer of this DVD apparently did not realize that he was buying a British-produced program, designed for a British audience. All of the trains pictured and much of the terminology is British, although narrator Bob Symes' enthusiasm for the subject is contagious. If you are seeking a video of completed model railway layouts, there are dozens to choose among, including the same producer's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Model-Railways-A-Lineside-Look-at-Model-Railways/dp/B002IJQ348/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Model Railways: A Lineside Look at Model Railways</a>. This, too, features only British models, but all are completed, exhibition-quality works of art.

For the North American modeler who wants to know how to build his first layout, this video can be supplimented by the numerous Carstens Publications and Kalmbach Publications how-to books as advertised in Model Railroader&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Model-Railroader/dp/B000PUAI8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Model Railroader</a>&nbsp;and Railroad Model Craftsman&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Railroad-Model-Craftsman/dp/B00007B100/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Railroad Model Craftsman</a>&nbsp;magazines.

all narrated by a heavily accented english guy (Bob Symes)complete rubbish if your looking to get ideas or 'railfan' layouts.",1260921600,4,257,4.608695652173913
