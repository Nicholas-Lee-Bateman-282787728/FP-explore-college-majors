8059690,1,B0009E27QW,"If I could give a movie a quarter of a star.....this would be the one!! You could make a better movie on your cell phone!(ReallyReally.......you could)
The story of the friends going to make a moviemovie is not anything new, but how they found the worst crew of actors known to man is beyond me! I mean bad.....really, really, REALLY BAD!!! The sound is horrible, the music is horrible, and I kept expecting this movie to turn into an 80's porno!
Please save yourself! There is nothing worth saving in this movie except your sight!",1442016000,,531,4.6
8059691,1,B0009E27QW,Complete bomb never ever ever again would I/ we watch this again it really was a terrible film to watch,1391990400,,103,4.2
8059692,1,B0009E27QW,"Oh my gosh - one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Poor B rated - crappy effects and I think they used an iPhone to record the sound.  The FX looked like some 80's TV show, well I hate to put down 80's TV shows now that I think about it.  OK, they were worse than that.  So - so story, but that is it.  Nothing much to say except don't waste your money and don't be fooled by the cool looking movie poster.  You know, there is a reason there is no preview with this one...  Oh yea, and don't even ask me about the Wear-Monkey in the movie.  Got to go wash my eyes after that one.",1340496000,2,584,3.768595041322314
8059693,2,B0009E27QW,"This is a low budget film which looks like it was filmed on super VHS using some bad CG special effects. Before the credits we see the killer vampire, so it really isn't a who-dun-it BUT it does have a plot twist that comes about a third of the way into the film, making it not much of a twist at all. The big huge cross shown during the credits made me think this was some kind of Christian movie plus the guy with the ""GOD"" baseball cap. But then Jessica (Michelle Craine) takes a shower and there is nudity! She is attacked by a black paw. (Nice to know Black Tooth is still alive, but what about White Fang?) Oh Wait! This is for a low budget motion picture being filmed within a low budget motion picture...using a camera worse than my nephew uses to record his kids Kindergarten graduation.

The gang heads up to a well kept summer home to film the rest of the movie, ""Curse of the Weremonkey."" Lynne Jacobellis teases us by running around most of the movie in a bra and unbuttoned Daisy Dukes, but that wasn't enough to carry the film. Killing and Blood? Yes. But the acting and dialouge was really bad. The premise for the movie and the twist was a basically sound idea, but it was poorly executed.

PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex nudity (Valentina Castellani, Michelle Craine) 1 star normally, Michelle Craine not liking clothing adds a star.",1325289600,2,1348,4.431451612903226

8059695,1,B0009E27QW,"This film is dull. It did however remind me of Shadow of the Vampire, in that a film director makes a pact with a vampire to do a film.

This is the basics; a group of 20 somethings go to an isolated house to finish off a horror film. The house is the scene of some grusome vampire murders. One of the vampires is still hanging around and he attacks them. All of this is then filmed by a guy who's made a deal with him, but he can't film vampires anyway, because their image doesn't appear on camera!!

That's it.",1138320000,4,513,4.069306930693069
8059696,1,B0009E27QW,"It still amazes me that people will put up money and that a studio will release films like THE HORROR WITHIN.  There is nothing highly professional about this movie:  the effects are laughably inept; the performances are straight out of high school, and the plotline is so convoluted it reeks of garbage.  The story such as it is follows eight college students (who all look over 30) who are making a student film called..HOLD ON TO YOUR MOUSE!) CURSE OF THE WEREMONKEY.  The rich son of a faded actor is producing the student film hoping to sell it through his dad to a major studio; the others are simply wanting to make a student film.  Ho hum...still with me?  Anyway, they end up in this deserted beach house and find themselves at the mercy of the stupidest vampires ever to grace the screen.  This is a bad movie and not a ""good"" bad movie..it's not even good enough to be called ""cheesy""...it's just horrible.",1137024000,3,917,4.554878048780488
